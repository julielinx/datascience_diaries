    "- CMPEN 270: Design Theory and Practice\n",
    "  - Description: Introduction to digital systems and their design. Topics include combinational and sequential devices and circuits, modern design tools and design practices. The course introduces the theoretical foundation for digital systems including number systems, a variety of commonly used codes and Boolean algebra. Combinational devices, logic gates, and sequential devices, latches and flip-flops are introduced along with design techniques, methods and tools. Design criteria and objectives are considered and design trade-offs are examined. Higher level design elements are also examined such as decoders, multiplexers, counters, and registers, and their use in system design. Students are exposed to a variety of design tools and implementation techniques, including schematic capture tools, simulation tools, Hardware Description Languages (HDL) and HDL design tools. Laboratory work includes the design, construction and debugging of a variety of digital circuits, and the use of standard laboratory tools such as the oscilloscope and logic analyzer, and various software design tools.\n",

The fundamental issues to be covered include, but not limited to, reliable communication over an unreliable network layer, connection establishment/teardown and handshaking, congestion and flow control, path determination, multiple access control. The student learning these principles will gain knowledge that lasts long after today's network standards and protocols have become obsolete.\n",

This requires the language and notation of matrices and fundamental techniques for working with matrices such as row and column operations, echelon form, and invertibility. The determinant of a matrix is also introduced; it gives a test for invertibility. In the second part of the course the key ideas of eigenvector and eigenvalue are developed. These allow one to analyze a complicated matrix problem into simpler components and appear in many disguises in physical problems. The course also introduces the concept of a vector space, a crucial element in future linear algebra courses.\n",
