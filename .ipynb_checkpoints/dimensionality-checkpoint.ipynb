    "A quick interjection: there is one other concept that will come up frequently in this post, and that is the concept of dimensionality.  In simplistic terms, it is just the number of columns in the dataset, but it has significant downstream effects on the eventual models.  At the extremes, the concept of the \"curse of dimensionality\" discusses that in high-dimensional spaces some things just stop working properly. Even in relatively low dimensional problems, a dataset with more dimensions requires more parameters for the model to understand, and that means more rows to reliably learn those parameters. If the number of rows in the dataset is fixed, addition of extra dimensions without adding more information for the models to learn from can have a detrimental effect on the eventual model accuracy."
