Which means I can concatenate all the n-grams of a specific category together (i.e. I don't want to combine unigrams with bigrams, just all the unigrams with each other).\n",
    "\n",
    "I already know I want to use the n-grams as my index/sort column, which means I'll need to create a separate dataframe for each set of frequencies. This both simplifies and complicates the process, since I won't be able to just add on to the same dataframe anymore.\n",

    "The `frequency_ct` and `dict_to_df` functions that I created in the previous solution to the homework still work. The only new aspect is that I need to put all the n-gram lists together.

    "# Caveats\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several problems with this exercise and the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Corpus data processing\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest initial problem for me was the fact that punctuation wasn't removed, the n-grams were case sensitive, and stopwords weren't removed. The first two mean that words aren't counted appropriately, especially when they're prone to different capitalizations and uses with punctuation. For example, in the initial solution I noticed 'daddy' written several ways. Here are several ways 'daddy' could be included in a script\n",
    "\n",
    "- Daddy.\n",
    "- daddy.\n",
    "- Daddy\n",
    "- daddy\n",
    "- Daddy!\n",
    "- daddy!\n",
    "\n",
    "This is six iterations for a single word which should all be counded together.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last point, stopwords weren't removed, means that there's a lot of meaningless noise; Words like 'the', 'a', 'an', 'of', 'for', etc remain in the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pronouns\n",
    "\n",
    "Related to proper counting and stopwords are proper nouns. In a script or novel, the names of the characters of the story will show up a disporportionate amount of the time. With a large enough corpus this becomes moot because names common to the era will naturally show up more than modern names. However, these corpora aren't large enough for this averaging of character names. The same is true for place names. The location the script is set has a higher likelihood of being mentioned.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ratio impact\n",
    "\n",
    "As can be seen in the final results dataframe, the high ratios have a much larger impact on my ranking than the lower numbers. This means that including words that were rare in the 1960s has a much bigger impact on the ranking than excluding words that were common.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Repetition\n",
    "\n",
    "The authentic 1960s corpus includes many, many The Twilight Zone episodes. Most, if not all, of The Twilight Zone episodes start with the same introduction. This means that words like 'traveling', 'another', 'dimension', 'sight', 'sound', 'mind', and 'journey' are disproportionately represented. An improvement to the analysis would be to account for and remove this repetition so that it's only represented once in the frequencies."
