1
00:00:10,777 --> 00:00:13,279
You're traveling
through another dimension-

2
00:00:13,314 --> 00:00:16,399
a dimension not only of sight
and sound, but of mind,

3
00:00:16,434 --> 00:00:18,902
a journey into a wondrous land

4
00:00:18,937 --> 00:00:20,787
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

5
00:00:20,822 --> 00:00:23,907
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

6
00:00:33,952 --> 00:00:37,053
Mr. Chambers? Mr. Chambers?

7
00:00:37,088 --> 00:00:38,922
It is the mealtime.

8
00:00:39,556 --> 00:00:42,675
Kindly state
your preference, please.

9
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,561
Mr. Chambers?

10
00:00:44,596 --> 00:00:46,429
It is the mealtime.

11
00:00:46,464 --> 00:00:49,566
Kindly state your preference.

12
00:00:53,937 --> 00:00:57,574
Please deposit cigarettes
in appropriate receptacle.

13
00:00:57,609 --> 00:00:59,442
This is a safety measure.

14
00:00:59,477 --> 00:01:01,578
Why don't you take
a flying jump at the moon?

15
00:01:01,613 --> 00:01:03,446
Kindly repeat request.

16
00:01:03,481 --> 00:01:05,331
Aw, knock it off,
leave me alone.

17
00:01:05,366 --> 00:01:08,451
You do not care
for food at this time?

18
00:01:08,486 --> 00:01:10,703
Yes, i do not care
for food at this time.

19
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:11,337
Very well.

20
00:01:13,241 --> 00:01:15,708
Very well... very, very well.

21
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:38,364
Please conserve water.

22
00:01:49,742 --> 00:01:51,628
What time is it?

23
00:01:51,663 --> 00:01:54,130
There is no time in space.

24
00:01:54,165 --> 00:01:55,999
This is to say

25
00:01:56,034 --> 00:01:57,884
there is no chronology
that can be calibrated.

26
00:01:58,501 --> 00:02:01,004
I said what time is it,
what time is it on earth?

27
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:02,255
Can you tell me that

28
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:04,140
without an exercise
in euclidean geometry?

29
00:02:04,175 --> 00:02:06,009
Now, just tell me
what time it is on earth.

30
00:02:06,044 --> 00:02:09,762
On earth it would be 12:00 noon.

31
00:02:11,683 --> 00:02:14,767
12:00 noon, 12:00 noon.

32
00:02:16,653 --> 00:02:19,155
This is the way
nightmares begin...

33
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:21,024
or, perhaps, end.

34
00:02:21,059 --> 00:02:23,526
Very simple, direct, unadorned.

35
00:02:23,561 --> 00:02:26,663
Incredible,
and yet so terribly real

36
00:02:26,698 --> 00:02:28,531
that even
while they're happening

37
00:02:28,566 --> 00:02:31,034
we live with them
and digest them

38
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:32,919
and assimilate them.

39
00:02:32,954 --> 00:02:34,787
And if it's 12:00 noon

40
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:37,290
that's what you
preoccupy yourself with.

41
00:02:37,325 --> 00:02:39,175
You don't think
about 12:00 noon

42
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:42,295
on the next day
or the day after that.

43
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:46,049
But that's what we should
have been thinking about-

44
00:02:46,084 --> 00:02:49,185
tomorrow
and the day after tomorrow.

45
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:52,305
We were preoccupied
with the hands on a clock

46
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:56,059
when we should have been
checking off a calendar.

47
00:02:58,561 --> 00:03:02,315
It was an april day,
and it was noon then, too.

48
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,817
And people walked and drove

49
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:07,954
and bought and sold
and fretted and laughed.

50
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:10,707
The world went on
much as it had been going on

51
00:03:10,742 --> 00:03:11,958
with a tentative tiptoeing

52
00:03:11,993 --> 00:03:13,826
alongside a precipice
of crisis.

53
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:15,712
There was berlin to worry about

54
00:03:15,747 --> 00:03:17,580
and indochina, and algeria

55
00:03:17,615 --> 00:03:20,083
and all the other myriad
problems, major and minor

56
00:03:20,118 --> 00:03:22,719
that somehow had lost
their incisive edge of horror

57
00:03:22,754 --> 00:03:25,221
because we were
so familiar with them.

58
00:03:25,256 --> 00:03:26,472
And then...

59
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:35,732
and that's when it happened.

60
00:03:35,767 --> 00:03:38,851
That's when we first heard
that they had come.

61
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:40,737
That's when we should
have prepared ourselves

62
00:03:40,772 --> 00:03:43,856
for any eventuality,
but we didn't.

63
00:03:45,742 --> 00:03:48,861
Instead, we milled around
like frightened farm animals

64
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:50,747
looking for formulas
and father images,

65
00:03:50,782 --> 00:03:53,249
while the secretary general
of the united nations

66
00:03:53,284 --> 00:03:55,118
made the first
official announcement

67
00:03:55,153 --> 00:03:58,371
of the arrival of creatures
from outer space.

68
00:03:58,406 --> 00:03:59,872
They called themselves kanamits

69
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:01,758
and announced
over the short wave

70
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:05,378
that on that given afternoon,
they would arrive on earth.

71
00:04:05,413 --> 00:04:09,015
At 11:00 this morning,
eastern standard time

72
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,383
the first of these landings

73
00:04:10,418 --> 00:04:14,137
took place in an area just
outside of newark, new jersey.

74
00:04:14,172 --> 00:04:17,890
Subsequently, we have had
reports of other landings

75
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:21,644
in the soviet union, in norway,
the southern coast of france

76
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:24,781
just outside of rio de janeiro
and several others.

77
00:04:24,816 --> 00:04:27,900
Speaking on behalf
of the united nations,

78
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:29,786
i can only tell you
that at this moment

79
00:04:29,821 --> 00:04:32,905
it would be premature
to assume hostile intent

80
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,408
on the part of these...
these kanamits.

81
00:04:35,443 --> 00:04:37,660
And so, it is the position
of the united nations

82
00:04:37,695 --> 00:04:40,163
that the world population
remain calm,

83
00:04:40,198 --> 00:04:42,048
to make no hostile move,

84
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:43,800
to keep in mind

85
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:46,302
that all governments
are being apprised

86
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:48,921
of the events as they happen

87
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:51,424
and have the situation
well in hand.

88
00:04:51,459 --> 00:04:53,810
What do they look like?
Yeah, whatdo
they look like?

89
00:04:53,845 --> 00:04:54,427
Please, gentlemen,
please...

90
00:04:54,462 --> 00:04:56,312
who are they, mr.
Secretary general?
Can't we get

91
00:04:56,347 --> 00:04:58,815
a more specific statement?
We do not know
what they look like.

92
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:01,934
We only know that several
of their craft have landed

93
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:03,820
and that they...

94
00:05:05,223 --> 00:05:05,822
what's the secret?

95
00:05:05,857 --> 00:05:07,073
Why can't we have
a statement?

96
00:05:07,108 --> 00:05:08,941
What's going on?
What's happening here?

97
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:10,193
Please,
mr. Secretary general...

98
00:05:10,228 --> 00:05:12,078
it appears... it appears
that one of the craft

99
00:05:12,113 --> 00:05:13,329
has landed just
a few blocks away.

100
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:15,832
That close?
Does the defense
department know...?

101
00:05:15,867 --> 00:05:18,951
One of their representatives
is on his way to this building.

102
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:20,203
Fantastic!
Unbelievable!

103
00:05:46,229 --> 00:05:50,616
Respectfully submitted
for your perusal... a kanamit.

104
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:52,485
A little over nine feet.

105
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,987
In the neighborhood
of 350 pounds.

106
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:56,239
Unknown.

107
00:05:56,274 --> 00:05:58,741
Motives?

108
00:05:58,776 --> 00:06:00,626
Therein hangs the tale,
for in just a moment

109
00:06:00,661 --> 00:06:03,746
we're going to ask you
to shake hands, figuratively,

110
00:06:03,781 --> 00:06:05,631
with a christopher columbus

111
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,500
from another galaxy
and another time.

112
00:06:07,535 --> 00:06:10,636
This is the twilight zone.

113
00:06:26,736 --> 00:06:29,238
Ladies and gentlemen
of the earth,

114
00:06:29,273 --> 00:06:32,358
we greet you
in peace and friendship.

115
00:06:32,393 --> 00:06:36,112
We come from a planet
far beyond this galaxy,

116
00:06:36,147 --> 00:06:38,364
a planet far more developed
than earth,

117
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:40,867
but we come as friends.

118
00:06:40,902 --> 00:06:43,369
Although we know your language,

119
00:06:43,404 --> 00:06:47,123
our own methods of communication
are mental rather than verbal.

120
00:06:47,757 --> 00:06:50,259
Hence, the voice you hear me
speaking with

121
00:06:50,294 --> 00:06:52,762
is totally mechanical.

122
00:06:52,797 --> 00:06:54,380
Our intentions
are honorable.

123
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:58,134
We desire above all things
to help the people of earth...

124
00:07:01,305 --> 00:07:02,638
...to establish embassies here,

125
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:04,524
and, in the near future,
to set up reciprocal visits

126
00:07:04,559 --> 00:07:07,026
between earth people
and kanamits.

127
00:07:07,061 --> 00:07:10,146
Perhaps you watched
this initial questioning-

128
00:07:10,181 --> 00:07:12,031
most people on earth did

129
00:07:12,066 --> 00:07:15,535
on television sets,
radios, shortwave.

130
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:18,905
Surely, some of the questions
asked by your representatives

131
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,790
must have been identical
to a few of your own

132
00:07:20,825 --> 00:07:23,793
because as a race,
we're unaccustomed to charity.

133
00:07:23,828 --> 00:07:26,913
Brutality is a far more
universal language to us

134
00:07:26,948 --> 00:07:31,300
than an expression of friendship
from outer space.

135
00:07:31,335 --> 00:07:33,169
Would you be willing to
be interrogated here

136
00:07:33,204 --> 00:07:34,420
and at this time?

137
00:07:34,455 --> 00:07:35,671
There are u.n.
Delegates present

138
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:37,557
from most of the
important countries

139
00:07:37,592 --> 00:07:39,425
and the television cameras

140
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,928
are carrying our meeting
throughout the world.

141
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:44,430
I will be glad to.

142
00:07:46,182 --> 00:07:49,185
Senor valdes of argentina
is recognized.

143
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,573
Thank you, mr. Secretary.

144
00:07:53,608 --> 00:07:56,692
Senor, could you
please inform us

145
00:07:56,727 --> 00:07:59,946
precisely why have you chosen
this planet for your visit?

146
00:07:59,981 --> 00:08:01,948
It has come to
our attention

147
00:08:01,983 --> 00:08:03,833
that earth has
been plagued

148
00:08:03,868 --> 00:08:06,953
by both natural and
unnatural catastrophes

149
00:08:06,988 --> 00:08:10,706
all of which could easily
be acted upon and prevented.

150
00:08:10,741 --> 00:08:14,460
We are here
to help you.

151
00:08:14,495 --> 00:08:18,598
Recognizing dr. Denis leveque,
the representative of france.

152
00:08:18,633 --> 00:08:21,717
Monsieur, my government
wishes me to ask you

153
00:08:21,752 --> 00:08:23,603
the nature of your help.

154
00:08:23,638 --> 00:08:25,471
What forms will it take?

155
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:29,225
Indeed, if we should prefer
not to avail ourselves

156
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,727
of the various aids
that you mentioned,

157
00:08:31,762 --> 00:08:34,113
your reply
would be what?

158
00:08:34,148 --> 00:08:37,233
We will not force
anything on you.

159
00:08:37,268 --> 00:08:40,987
You will take only that
which you choose to take.

160
00:08:41,022 --> 00:08:44,490
For example, tomorrow
we will demonstrate

161
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:46,993
to all interested parties

162
00:08:47,028 --> 00:08:50,746
a new and extremely
interesting power source

163
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:52,248
which is atomic
in nature

164
00:08:52,283 --> 00:08:56,002
and which can supply
a form of electric power

165
00:08:56,037 --> 00:08:57,887
for entire countries

166
00:08:57,922 --> 00:08:59,755
for the cost
of a few dollars.

167
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:03,509
It's extremely
economical.

168
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:05,394
Mr. Gregori,
the representative

169
00:09:05,429 --> 00:09:08,397
of the soviet union,
is recognized.

170
00:09:08,432 --> 00:09:12,018
The soviet people would
like to ask the kanamits

171
00:09:12,053 --> 00:09:13,903
precisely-
i repeat that to him-

172
00:09:13,938 --> 00:09:16,405
precisely what
are your motives

173
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,274
in coming here
quite uninvited?

174
00:09:18,309 --> 00:09:22,028
Are we to assume
that there is no ulterior motive

175
00:09:22,063 --> 00:09:25,164
beyond this vast humanity
you speak of?

176
00:09:25,199 --> 00:09:28,034
There is nothing ulterior
in our motives.

177
00:09:28,069 --> 00:09:29,285
Nothing at all.

178
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:33,039
You will discover this
for yourselves before too long

179
00:09:33,074 --> 00:09:35,541
simply by testing
the various devices

180
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:38,794
which we will make
available to you.

181
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:41,297
We can show you,
for example,

182
00:09:41,332 --> 00:09:45,685
how to add a certain very
cheap nitrate to the soil

183
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,437
and end famine on earth
for good and all.

184
00:09:48,472 --> 00:09:51,557
We can demonstrate
to you quite practically

185
00:09:51,592 --> 00:09:54,060
the principles
of the force field

186
00:09:54,095 --> 00:09:56,445
in which you may
cloak each nation

187
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,697
with an invisible wall

188
00:09:58,314 --> 00:10:00,816
absolutely impenetrable
by bombs, missiles,

189
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:02,068
or anything else.

190
00:10:02,103 --> 00:10:03,953
We ask only
that you trust us.

191
00:10:03,988 --> 00:10:08,324
Only that you simply trust us.

192
00:10:08,359 --> 00:10:10,826
That was what we all thought.

193
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:12,712
It was the age of santa claus.

194
00:10:12,747 --> 00:10:16,465
Only these kriss kringles
came without white whiskers

195
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,968
and rosy cheeks
and twinkling eyes.

196
00:10:19,003 --> 00:10:20,836
They were nine-feet tall enigmas

197
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:22,722
who descended on us
like locusts.

198
00:10:22,757 --> 00:10:27,093
But nobody was counting
or worrying.

199
00:10:27,128 --> 00:10:30,229
Except perhaps
a few professionals

200
00:10:30,264 --> 00:10:33,349
whose job it was
to second guess.

201
00:10:33,384 --> 00:10:35,851
In a sense, i was one of these-

202
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:38,988
a decoding specialist for
the united states government,

203
00:10:39,023 --> 00:10:43,359
and this is where
i got into the act.

204
00:10:43,394 --> 00:10:47,113
Well, chambers,
what have you got?

205
00:10:47,148 --> 00:10:50,866
A corker of a migraine headache
and eye strain.

206
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:52,752
You can't lick it?

207
00:10:52,787 --> 00:10:55,871
No, not in eight hours, i can't.

208
00:10:55,906 --> 00:10:57,123
Colonel,
it took us almost a year

209
00:10:57,158 --> 00:10:58,374
to crack the japanese code-

210
00:10:58,409 --> 00:11:01,510
we had an army of men
working on that.

211
00:11:01,545 --> 00:11:05,264
But this is a language of people
from outer space,

212
00:11:05,299 --> 00:11:07,767
probably 500 times
as intelligent as we are

213
00:11:07,802 --> 00:11:09,635
and a thousand times
more complex.

214
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,520
You need more help?

215
00:11:11,555 --> 00:11:14,640
All donations
gratefully accepted.

216
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:16,525
I showed this
to every man on our staff.

217
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,645
I've had a dozen people working
on it since late last night.

218
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,530
We've tried
pretty much everything-

219
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:24,650
single transposition,
double transposition.

220
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:27,787
We've tried every known method
of cryptography there is,

221
00:11:27,822 --> 00:11:29,655
and i don't know
whether we're even close

222
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:30,906
or a million miles away.

223
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:33,409
Are you saying it's
indecipherable?

224
00:11:33,444 --> 00:11:37,163
No, we've just got
to keep trying, that's all.

225
00:11:37,198 --> 00:11:40,916
Standard, direct, reversed,
systematically mixed,

226
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:42,802
keyword mixed, random mixed,

227
00:11:42,837 --> 00:11:45,304
reciprocal, conjugate.

228
00:11:45,339 --> 00:11:48,424
Every nature of sequence
of letters there is.

229
00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:50,926
I'll tell you something,
colonel, this is a tough nut.

230
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:53,429
This is a real tough nut.

231
00:11:53,464 --> 00:11:55,314
How important is it?

232
00:11:55,349 --> 00:11:58,434
Hmm, i don't know.

233
00:11:58,469 --> 00:12:00,319
That... that kanamit,

234
00:12:00,354 --> 00:12:01,570
or whatever it is
he calls himself,

235
00:12:01,605 --> 00:12:03,439
walked off and left
this book yesterday at the u.n.

236
00:12:03,474 --> 00:12:06,575
The white house feels
if we can decipher this book

237
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:09,695
we can find out
what they're up to.

238
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,697
Well, obviously,
nothing but our good.

239
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:14,834
He hasn't commented
on the loss of this book.

240
00:12:14,869 --> 00:12:16,085
Probably unconcerned.

241
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,953
Why should we be so concerned?

242
00:12:17,988 --> 00:12:19,839
They've done all right

243
00:12:19,874 --> 00:12:21,090
by us so far.

244
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:21,707
Parlor tricks.

245
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:24,210
They don't seem
like tricks, colonel.

246
00:12:24,245 --> 00:12:26,712
That new nitrate use
they demonstrated

247
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:28,597
in argentina
this morning-

248
00:12:28,632 --> 00:12:31,967
that soil had more vitamins
in it six hours later

249
00:12:32,601 --> 00:12:33,853
than a drugstore chain.

250
00:12:33,888 --> 00:12:35,721
I know that country.

251
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:38,224
That's as barren and fruitless

252
00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:40,109
as any place
on earth.

253
00:12:40,144 --> 00:12:41,360
Well...

254
00:12:41,395 --> 00:12:44,480
we might lick this,
we might not.

255
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:47,616
But i got
a strange feeling.

256
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:49,485
What?

257
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,736
That we're looking

258
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:52,621
a gift horse
in the mouth.

259
00:12:52,656 --> 00:12:55,124
I got another
funny feeling, too.

260
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:57,626
And that is?

261
00:12:57,661 --> 00:12:59,495
That if these kanamits

262
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:01,997
are as helpful as
i think they are,

263
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:03,883
you boys will be
out of a job.

264
00:13:03,918 --> 00:13:05,751
And probably,
so will i.

265
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:07,002
Am i to assume

266
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:10,139
this is a scientific
analysis, mr. Chambers,

267
00:13:10,174 --> 00:13:12,007
or just some
kentucky windage?

268
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:14,510
Well, i don't know
what it is, colonel,

269
00:13:14,545 --> 00:13:17,012
beyond an instinctive
feeling.

270
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:20,149
When this earth
gets enough to eat

271
00:13:20,184 --> 00:13:23,269
and there are no more wars
or diseases or famines,

272
00:13:23,304 --> 00:13:27,022
this is going to be
a garden of eden.

273
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:29,525
Your optimism is most
refreshing, mr. Chambers,

274
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,776
but i suggest
you continue

275
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:32,661
your process
of deciphering

276
00:13:32,696 --> 00:13:35,164
until you can
tell us precisely-

277
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:39,535
and i mean precisely-
what that book says.

278
00:13:42,671 --> 00:13:44,540
We've licked the title, anyway.

279
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,791
What does
it say?

280
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:47,676
How much
does it tell us?

281
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:48,928
Here it is.

282
00:13:48,963 --> 00:13:50,796
Well, that makes
the cheese

283
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:53,933
a little more binding,
wouldn't you say, colonel?

284
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:57,052
I'd call that a reasonably
altruistic phrase,

285
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:58,304
do you agree,
patty?

286
00:13:58,339 --> 00:13:59,555
Well, i, uh...

287
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:02,057
well, i want to
believe it, but...

288
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:05,194
i don't know
what to think.

289
00:14:07,062 --> 00:14:08,948
"To serve man."

290
00:14:08,983 --> 00:14:11,450
I hope so.

291
00:14:11,485 --> 00:14:13,953
I fervently hope so.

292
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:25,414
Gentlemen,
the purpose of this meeting

293
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:27,917
is to acquaint you with certain
tests made over the past week.

294
00:14:27,952 --> 00:14:30,803
At the request
of several delegates

295
00:14:30,838 --> 00:14:32,671
and with the full consent

296
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:34,423
of our guests, the kanamits,

297
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:38,177
these tests were filmed,
cut together into one short film

298
00:14:38,212 --> 00:14:41,313
and you can watch them now.

299
00:14:41,931 --> 00:14:43,816
Kindly lower the screen.

300
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:51,690
These are
the standard instruments used

301
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:54,193
to determine
the truth of a statement.

302
00:14:54,228 --> 00:14:55,444
Our first object,

303
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:59,198
since the physiology of the
kanamits is unknown to us,

304
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:02,952
was to determine whether or not
they react to these tests

305
00:15:02,987 --> 00:15:04,203
as human beings do.

306
00:15:04,238 --> 00:15:07,339
We will now repeat one
of the many experiments made

307
00:15:07,374 --> 00:15:11,093
in an effort
to discover this fact.

308
00:15:11,128 --> 00:15:16,715
This instrument records
the subject's heartbeat.

309
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:21,103
This one shows the electrical
conductivity of the skin

310
00:15:21,138 --> 00:15:22,972
in the palm of the hand-

311
00:15:23,606 --> 00:15:27,359
a measure of perspiration,
which increases under stress.

312
00:15:27,394 --> 00:15:30,479
This one shows the pattern

313
00:15:30,514 --> 00:15:32,364
and intensity
of the electrical waves

314
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,118
emanating
from the subject's brain.

315
00:15:38,621 --> 00:15:41,123
Which of these is
longer than the other?

316
00:15:41,158 --> 00:15:42,992
The gray.

317
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:48,631
I shall repeat
the question.

318
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:51,133
Which of these is
longer than the other?

319
00:15:51,168 --> 00:15:53,002
The black.

320
00:15:53,037 --> 00:15:55,504
How did you get
to this planet?

321
00:15:55,539 --> 00:15:58,007
Walked.

322
00:15:58,641 --> 00:16:01,760
Once again, how did
you get to this planet?

323
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:04,897
In a spaceship.

324
00:16:04,932 --> 00:16:06,765
Many such experiments were made

325
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,902
and my colleagues and myself
are satisfied

326
00:16:09,937 --> 00:16:14,273
that the mechanisms
are effective.

327
00:16:14,308 --> 00:16:17,409
Now, i shall ask
our distinguished guest

328
00:16:17,444 --> 00:16:20,529
to reply to the question
put at the last session

329
00:16:20,564 --> 00:16:22,414
by several of the delegates.

330
00:16:23,032 --> 00:16:27,169
Namely, what is the motive
of the kanamit people

331
00:16:27,204 --> 00:16:29,038
in offering such great gifts

332
00:16:29,073 --> 00:16:31,674
to the people of the earth?

333
00:16:31,709 --> 00:16:36,045
I hope that the people of earth
will understand and believe

334
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:41,050
when i tell you that our mission
upon this planet is simply this:

335
00:16:41,085 --> 00:16:46,689
To bring to you the peace and
plenty which we ourselves enjoy

336
00:16:46,724 --> 00:16:49,191
and which we have in the past

337
00:16:49,226 --> 00:16:52,945
brought to other races
throughout the galaxy.

338
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,447
When your world
has no more hunger,

339
00:16:55,482 --> 00:17:00,452
no more war,
no more needless suffering,

340
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:03,572
that will be our reward.

341
00:17:03,607 --> 00:17:05,457
And the machine
showed no deviation.

342
00:17:05,492 --> 00:17:08,577
According to it, the kanamit
was telling the truth.

343
00:17:08,612 --> 00:17:11,714
You and i and the rest of
this earth had a ringside seat

344
00:17:11,749 --> 00:17:15,467
to the rebirth of every dream
man had ever dreamed.

345
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:55,874
Santa claus came through.

346
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:57,760
Arid deserts became gardens

347
00:17:57,795 --> 00:18:00,879
with the devices the kanamits
showed us how to use.

348
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:04,633
The force field that was
to end war did precisely that.

349
00:18:04,668 --> 00:18:08,387
Armies and navies
were practically disbanded.

350
00:18:08,422 --> 00:18:11,523
Please check your guest visas.

351
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:19,648
This is flight number 267
from earth to our planet.

352
00:18:19,683 --> 00:18:22,534
They tell me they have
a mean temperature of 76 degrees

353
00:18:22,569 --> 00:18:25,037
on their planet,
and the sun never goes down.

354
00:18:25,072 --> 00:18:26,288
And there clothing-

355
00:18:26,323 --> 00:18:28,791
it's a metallic substance,
just beautiful.

356
00:18:28,826 --> 00:18:30,659
Kind of like a spun gold.

357
00:18:30,694 --> 00:18:31,910
My sister wrote me.

358
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:33,162
She says the day you land,

359
00:18:33,197 --> 00:18:36,298
they take you on a conducted
tour of all their shops

360
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:39,418
and you can pick out as
much of it as you want.

361
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:51,814
But it's an entire planet.

362
00:18:51,849 --> 00:18:53,682
It's bigger than china.

363
00:18:53,717 --> 00:18:55,567
Besides it's an opportunity

364
00:18:55,602 --> 00:18:58,070
to spread peaceful coexistence
to an entire galaxy.

365
00:18:58,105 --> 00:19:01,190
Stand aside, please,
i have diplomatic visa.

366
00:19:01,824 --> 00:19:04,443
It's just one big holiday
when you get there.

367
00:19:04,478 --> 00:19:07,579
They've even got
a form of baseball.

368
00:19:07,614 --> 00:19:10,082
Leagues of everything,
just like we've got.

369
00:19:10,117 --> 00:19:11,950
And the whole trip,
billions of miles,

370
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:14,453
only takes just a few days.

371
00:19:14,488 --> 00:19:16,338
Oh, man, i don't think
i'll want to come back

372
00:19:16,373 --> 00:19:18,207
once i do get there.

373
00:19:21,378 --> 00:19:23,212
I'm going home, boss.

374
00:19:23,247 --> 00:19:25,097
Need me for anything?

375
00:19:25,132 --> 00:19:26,965
Need you for anything?
Like what?

376
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:30,102
This isn't exactly what you call
a beehive of activity.

377
00:19:30,137 --> 00:19:34,473
Well, this is
the new story of man.

378
00:19:34,508 --> 00:19:38,227
Nobody needs to decipher
much of anything anymore

379
00:19:38,262 --> 00:19:40,112
because there aren't
any more codes

380
00:19:40,147 --> 00:19:42,614
simply because there aren't
any more secret messages.

381
00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:44,483
Odd.

382
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:45,734
Huh?

383
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:47,369
Well, i mean,

384
00:19:47,404 --> 00:19:50,489
we're not reading
about the hydrogen bomb

385
00:19:50,524 --> 00:19:52,374
or war scares or insurrections

386
00:19:52,409 --> 00:19:54,877
or anything like that anymore.

387
00:19:54,912 --> 00:19:57,996
Millennium.

388
00:19:58,031 --> 00:20:01,133
Yeah, close to it.

389
00:20:05,254 --> 00:20:07,139
How many of them
are around now?

390
00:20:07,174 --> 00:20:09,641
Anybody ever
figure it out?

391
00:20:10,259 --> 00:20:12,144
A few thousand, i guess.

392
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:14,012
They've got embassies
in every country now.

393
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:16,515
And for every one
of them that comes,

394
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:19,017
a few thousand of us
take off in their ships

395
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:20,269
to live with them.

396
00:20:20,304 --> 00:20:22,154
Yeah, that's
the odd thing:

397
00:20:22,189 --> 00:20:24,022
The fantastic ease
with which

398
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:26,525
human beings
make adjustments.

399
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,027
One day, they watch
with bated breath

400
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:32,164
while a single individual
orbits the earth

401
00:20:32,199 --> 00:20:34,032
in a rinky-dink
little cubicle

402
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:36,535
and they think this is
the most historic moment

403
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:39,037
that's ever happened in
the history of mankind.

404
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:40,923
And then, one year later,

405
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,425
they stand in line

406
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,294
waiting to take off
in a spaceship

407
00:20:45,329 --> 00:20:49,047
to go 100 billion miles
off into space

408
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:52,184
and they act and react

409
00:20:52,219 --> 00:20:57,189
as if this were
a weekend picnic in the country.

410
00:20:57,224 --> 00:21:02,194
Oh, strange
and complex sanity of man.

411
00:21:02,229 --> 00:21:04,062
Nothing fazes him.

412
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:09,067
Are you going?

413
00:21:09,102 --> 00:21:12,204
Well, as a matter of fact

414
00:21:12,239 --> 00:21:17,209
i'm on a ten-year
exchange group waiting list.

415
00:21:17,244 --> 00:21:19,077
And what about you, patty?

416
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:20,963
I'm on the list, too.

417
00:21:20,998 --> 00:21:23,332
The trouble is,
their quotas fill

418
00:21:23,367 --> 00:21:25,217
just as soon as they make

419
00:21:25,252 --> 00:21:26,468
the announcement
of a new trip.

420
00:21:26,503 --> 00:21:27,719
While i'm waiting,

421
00:21:27,754 --> 00:21:29,588
i think i'll do the
next best thing.

422
00:21:29,623 --> 00:21:32,090
I'm still working
on that book.

423
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:35,227
Deciphering that title
has been of no help

424
00:21:35,262 --> 00:21:37,095
because their capital
letters are different

425
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:38,981
than the other signs they use,

426
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:41,483
just as ours are.

427
00:21:41,518 --> 00:21:43,352
But it's starting
to fall into place.

428
00:21:43,387 --> 00:21:45,854
I think i'll get
the answer eventually.

429
00:21:45,889 --> 00:21:48,991
Well, i gave up
trying a month ago.

430
00:21:49,026 --> 00:21:53,996
This is flight number 914

431
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:56,498
from earth to our planet.

432
00:21:56,533 --> 00:21:59,618
We will be taking off
in three minutes.

433
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,372
Mr. Chambers!

434
00:22:05,874 --> 00:22:07,509
Mr. Chambers!

435
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:10,012
Don't get on that ship!

436
00:22:10,047 --> 00:22:12,514
The rest of the book,
to serve man-it's...

437
00:22:12,549 --> 00:22:15,017
it's a cookbook!

438
00:22:19,021 --> 00:22:21,523
No! No!

439
00:22:21,558 --> 00:22:23,892
No, no, no!

440
00:22:23,927 --> 00:22:27,029
Hey! No!

441
00:22:54,423 --> 00:22:57,559
You have not eaten enough,
mr. Chambers.

442
00:22:57,594 --> 00:23:00,062
Please, enjoy.

443
00:23:00,097 --> 00:23:03,181
Eat hearty.

444
00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:20,699
Please, mr. Chambers, eat.

445
00:23:20,734 --> 00:23:25,087
We wouldn't want you
to lose weight.

446
00:23:33,211 --> 00:23:35,097
How about you?

447
00:23:35,132 --> 00:23:38,216
You still on earth
or on the ship with me?

448
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:41,353
Well, it doesn't make
very much difference

449
00:23:41,388 --> 00:23:45,107
because sooner or later
we'll all of us be on the menu-

450
00:23:45,142 --> 00:23:48,226
all of us.

451
00:23:48,261 --> 00:23:51,363
The recollections
of one michael chambers

452
00:23:51,398 --> 00:23:54,483
with appropriate flashbacks
and soliloquy.

453
00:23:54,518 --> 00:23:56,985
Or more simply stated,
the evolution of man,

454
00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:00,739
the cycle of going
from dust to dessert...

455
00:24:00,774 --> 00:24:03,875
the metamorphosis from being
the ruler of a planet

456
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:06,378
to an ingredient
in someone's soup.

457
00:24:06,413 --> 00:24:10,749
It's tonight's bill of fare
on the twilight zone.

458
00:24:12,601 --> 00:24:14,920
Rod serling,
creator ofthe twilight zone,

459
00:24:14,955 --> 00:24:17,422
will tell you
about next week's story

460
00:24:17,457 --> 00:24:20,609
after this message.

461
00:24:20,644 --> 00:24:22,427
And now, mr. Serling.

462
00:24:22,462 --> 00:24:25,564
Next week onthe twilight zone
contributor charles beaumont

463
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:27,432
provides us
with a most charming tale

464
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:29,317
of an old man
and some children-

465
00:24:29,352 --> 00:24:31,820
an old man
who's an exceptional playmate,

466
00:24:31,855 --> 00:24:33,688
exceptional because, well,

467
00:24:33,723 --> 00:24:36,825
how many old men do you know
who can change into monsters?

468
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:39,327
Mr. Beaumont's
excellent tasting stew

469
00:24:39,362 --> 00:24:41,830
is further seasoned
by an element of mystery.

470
00:24:41,865 --> 00:24:43,698
It's called "the fugitive."

471
00:24:43,733 --> 00:24:46,201
We hope to see you next week.

472
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:17,699
This is james arness.

473
00:25:17,734 --> 00:25:19,568
You know, it's only a short hop

474
00:25:19,603 --> 00:25:22,070
fromthe twilight zone
to dodge city ingunsmoke.

475
00:25:22,105 --> 00:25:24,573
Saturday nights
over most of these stations.
