1
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:09,693
You unlock this door
with the key of imagination.

2
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:11,578
Beyond it is another dimension-

3
00:00:12,078 --> 00:00:13,329
a dimension of sound,

4
00:00:14,733 --> 00:00:16,583
a dimension of sight,

5
00:00:16,618 --> 00:00:18,451
a dimension of mind.

6
00:00:18,486 --> 00:00:20,954
You're moving into a land
of both shadow and substance,

7
00:00:20,989 --> 00:00:22,839
of things and ideas.

8
00:00:22,874 --> 00:00:25,959
You've just crossed over
into the twilight zone.

9
00:00:40,356 --> 00:00:45,979
? my grandfather's clock
was too large for the shelf?

10
00:00:46,014 --> 00:00:50,366
? so it stood 90 years
on the floor?

11
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:54,988
? it was taller by half
than the old man himself?

12
00:00:55,023 --> 00:00:59,375
? though it weighed
not a pennyweight more?

13
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:00,627
Such a long face.

14
00:01:01,244 --> 00:01:03,129
? my grandfather said?
Honey.

15
00:01:03,164 --> 00:01:04,998
? that of those he could hire?

16
00:01:05,033 --> 00:01:08,752
? not a servant
so faithful he'd found?

17
00:01:08,787 --> 00:01:11,888
? for it wasted no time...?

18
00:01:11,923 --> 00:01:13,139
What's wrong?

19
00:01:13,174 --> 00:01:15,258
I have to go up to talk to him.

20
00:01:15,293 --> 00:01:17,761
I don't know what to say to him.

21
00:01:17,796 --> 00:01:19,646
He's so happy, singing.

22
00:01:19,681 --> 00:01:22,649
Honey, i know
how much you love him,

23
00:01:22,684 --> 00:01:23,900
and i love you,

24
00:01:23,935 --> 00:01:25,518
but we have
to face facts.

25
00:01:25,553 --> 00:01:27,403
I know.

26
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:29,272
You're good for me.

27
00:01:29,307 --> 00:01:33,409
Someone's got to take care of
the homely women of the world.

28
00:01:33,444 --> 00:01:35,411
Hmm, thanks loads.

29
00:01:35,446 --> 00:01:39,783
? 90 years without slumbering?

30
00:01:39,818 --> 00:01:42,285
? ticktock, ticktock?

31
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,670
? with life's seconds
numbering?

32
00:01:44,287 --> 00:01:45,538
? ticktock, ticktock...?

33
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:51,177
Good, that, uh,
that...

34
00:01:51,212 --> 00:01:52,428
grandpa?

35
00:01:52,463 --> 00:01:53,680
Come on down.

36
00:01:54,297 --> 00:01:56,182
Oh, marnie.

37
00:01:56,217 --> 00:01:58,051
Don't waste your
eyesight, grandpa.

38
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:01,805
Well, you know,
once a clockmaker...

39
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,307
and it's been
a few minutes off lately.

40
00:02:04,342 --> 00:02:06,810
Grandpa, are you all right?

41
00:02:06,845 --> 00:02:08,695
Me?

42
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:10,196
Why, never better.

43
00:02:10,231 --> 00:02:12,065
Why, marn?

44
00:02:12,315 --> 00:02:14,200
Well, it's just that you
didn't come down for dinner.

45
00:02:14,235 --> 00:02:16,703
In fact, you haven't
been out of your room

46
00:02:16,738 --> 00:02:17,453
all day.

47
00:02:17,488 --> 00:02:20,573
Well, my friend's
been acting up today.

48
00:02:20,608 --> 00:02:23,710
I can't seem to get it regulated
just right, you know.

49
00:02:23,745 --> 00:02:24,961
Grandpa,

50
00:02:24,996 --> 00:02:27,831
we know how you love the clock.

51
00:02:27,866 --> 00:02:29,082
I...
but-but you see,

52
00:02:29,117 --> 00:02:31,584
it's ticking along
nicely now.

53
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:34,087
We shouldn't have any trouble
for a long while.

54
00:02:34,122 --> 00:02:37,223
Of course, with a clock
as old as that,

55
00:02:37,258 --> 00:02:43,479
well, you-you're bound
to run into problems, you know.

56
00:02:43,514 --> 00:02:46,599
Just like old people.

57
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:50,353
Oh, oh, oh.

58
00:02:50,388 --> 00:02:51,604
Now you ignore that.

59
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:53,489
Just ignore the clock
and ignore me.

60
00:02:53,524 --> 00:02:56,609
The main thing is really
you and the baby, you see.

61
00:02:56,644 --> 00:02:58,494
That's more important
than...

62
00:03:05,368 --> 00:03:06,619
will you get some rest?

63
00:03:06,654 --> 00:03:08,504
Take care of yourself.

64
00:03:08,539 --> 00:03:09,873
Oh, you know me.

65
00:03:09,908 --> 00:03:12,375
L-i never sleep.

66
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:13,626
At least eat.

67
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:16,763
Well, maybe later.

68
00:03:16,798 --> 00:03:17,380
Promise?

69
00:03:19,382 --> 00:03:20,633
Promise.

70
00:03:20,668 --> 00:03:22,385
Okay.

71
00:04:03,426 --> 00:04:07,313
Oh, it's... it's running slow.

72
00:04:07,348 --> 00:04:10,433
I didn't wind it properly.

73
00:04:10,468 --> 00:04:13,569
They're making me so nervous.

74
00:04:13,604 --> 00:04:15,438
I'm becoming careless.

75
00:04:15,473 --> 00:04:19,826
I mustn't... i mustn't let them
make me nervous.

76
00:04:28,952 --> 00:04:34,590
Please, please, don't stop.

77
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:37,710
I'll never forget
to wind you again.

78
00:04:37,745 --> 00:04:40,847
I promise.

79
00:04:51,474 --> 00:04:53,359
Each man measures his time-

80
00:04:53,394 --> 00:04:56,479
some with hope, some with joy,
some with fear.

81
00:04:56,514 --> 00:04:58,982
But sam forstmann
measures his allotted time

82
00:04:59,017 --> 00:05:00,867
by a grandfather's clock,

83
00:05:00,902 --> 00:05:02,118
a unique mechanism

84
00:05:02,153 --> 00:05:04,620
whose pendulum swings
between life and death,

85
00:05:04,655 --> 00:05:05,872
a very special clock

86
00:05:05,907 --> 00:05:07,740
that keeps
a special kind of time...

87
00:05:07,775 --> 00:05:10,877
in the twilight zone.

88
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,151
Where is he this morning?

89
00:05:35,186 --> 00:05:38,271
Still sleeping,
i guess.

90
00:05:38,306 --> 00:05:39,522
I'm not surprised.

91
00:05:39,557 --> 00:05:41,407
He must have been
fiddling around with that clock

92
00:05:41,442 --> 00:05:45,161
till 4:00
in the morning.

93
00:05:45,196 --> 00:05:48,915
Did you hear him?

94
00:05:49,532 --> 00:05:52,668
Sit down.

95
00:05:52,703 --> 00:05:55,788
Will you please
sit down, honey?

96
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:58,674
Is that all
you're having?

97
00:05:58,709 --> 00:06:00,543
I'm not hungry.

98
00:06:00,578 --> 00:06:01,177
What about the baby?

99
00:06:01,212 --> 00:06:03,046
I'm sure you don't have
to worry, doug.

100
00:06:03,081 --> 00:06:06,182
Honey, now, let's not
start fighting again.

101
00:06:06,217 --> 00:06:08,051
But you have
to face the fact

102
00:06:08,086 --> 00:06:11,054
your grandfather's
just not a well man.

103
00:06:11,089 --> 00:06:14,690
He's always been so alert,
so easy to be with.

104
00:06:14,725 --> 00:06:15,942
Maybe it's just
a temporary thing.

105
00:06:15,977 --> 00:06:17,810
Maybe it's a little something
we don't know anything about.

106
00:06:17,845 --> 00:06:20,196
Why don't we let
mel avery talk to him,

107
00:06:20,231 --> 00:06:22,698
just to make sure.

108
00:06:25,201 --> 00:06:27,703
You think i'm crazy,
don't you?

109
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:33,326
Mel avery
is a psychiatrist.

110
00:06:33,361 --> 00:06:35,211
He's a head shrinker.

111
00:06:35,246 --> 00:06:38,331
You don't have
to tell me, i know.

112
00:06:38,366 --> 00:06:41,334
Grandpa, mel's been
a friend of ours for years.

113
00:06:41,369 --> 00:06:43,219
He and doug
went to college together.

114
00:06:43,254 --> 00:06:44,220
You've met him.

115
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:46,089
I've met lots of people.

116
00:06:46,124 --> 00:06:48,591
But i don't let them
tinker with my head.

117
00:06:48,626 --> 00:06:51,727
Sam, no one's going
to tinker with your head.

118
00:06:51,762 --> 00:06:52,979
All we're suggesting

119
00:06:53,014 --> 00:06:55,481
is that you see mel
and talk to him.

120
00:06:55,516 --> 00:06:58,601
Well, why do i need
to see a psychiatrist?

121
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:03,356
Well, your preoccupation
with the clock, for instance.

122
00:07:03,391 --> 00:07:08,861
I'm fond of my clock
and that makes me crazy.

123
00:07:10,113 --> 00:07:12,615
My, what a strange world
we live in.

124
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:14,500
You have to admit you spend
a lot of time with it.

125
00:07:14,535 --> 00:07:17,003
Sometimes
half the night.

126
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:19,505
Aha! Just because
i have insomnia

127
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,625
and working on the clock
relaxes me,

128
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:25,761
that makes me a candidate
for the loony bin.

129
00:07:25,796 --> 00:07:28,264
I've had insomnia
all my life.

130
00:07:28,299 --> 00:07:30,633
So did my father.

131
00:07:30,668 --> 00:07:32,635
He died at 90.

132
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:34,520
90 years without slumbering-

133
00:07:34,555 --> 00:07:36,389
just like the song says.

134
00:07:36,424 --> 00:07:39,892
Grandpa, doug only has
your best interest at heart.

135
00:07:39,927 --> 00:07:42,645
Yeah, my best interests.

136
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,896
All right, son.

137
00:07:43,931 --> 00:07:47,033
I'll see your friend
the psychiatrist tomorrow.

138
00:07:47,068 --> 00:07:50,153
You may be surprised
when you find out

139
00:07:50,188 --> 00:07:52,655
who the crazy one really is.

140
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:57,660
That clock was completed
exactly 76 years ago.

141
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:02,665
And it was presented to
me the day of my birth.

142
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,916
You see, doctor,

143
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:07,053
my father was very much
in love with my mother.

144
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,555
And in those days,

145
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:10,806
it was very
fashionable

146
00:08:10,841 --> 00:08:12,675
for husbands
and wives

147
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:15,178
to be in love
with each other.

148
00:08:15,213 --> 00:08:17,930
And it's no longer
fashionable, huh?

149
00:08:17,965 --> 00:08:21,184
If it were, the woods wouldn't
be full of psychiatrists.

150
00:08:21,219 --> 00:08:26,439
So you and the clock
were "born" on the same day

151
00:08:26,474 --> 00:08:27,690
so to speak.

152
00:08:27,725 --> 00:08:31,194
Oh, now, you're trying
to get me to say

153
00:08:31,229 --> 00:08:36,199
that i think that the clock
is a real, living person.

154
00:08:36,234 --> 00:08:38,701
Well, i don't.

155
00:08:38,736 --> 00:08:39,952
It's a mechanism.

156
00:08:39,987 --> 00:08:41,837
Nothing more, nothing less.

157
00:08:41,872 --> 00:08:44,840
Then why be so extraordinarily
concerned with it?

158
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:46,959
Well, that clock's worth
hundreds of dollars.

159
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:50,213
It also is a
family heirloom.

160
00:08:50,248 --> 00:08:52,348
Wouldn't you want to keep
a thing like that

161
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:54,217
in perfect condition?

162
00:08:54,252 --> 00:08:56,219
Well, yes, but, uh...

163
00:08:56,254 --> 00:08:58,104
you're not sure, huh?

164
00:08:58,139 --> 00:09:00,973
Yes, i'm sure.

165
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:03,609
But we're not talking
about my clock,

166
00:09:03,644 --> 00:09:06,112
we're talking
about your clock.

167
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:09,732
Oh, so you have a grandfather's
clock, too, doctor, huh?

168
00:09:09,767 --> 00:09:13,486
As a matter of fact,
my wife bought one recently.

169
00:09:13,521 --> 00:09:14,737
She collects antiques.

170
00:09:14,772 --> 00:09:15,871
Tell me about it.

171
00:09:15,906 --> 00:09:17,740
Well, it's
eight feet tall,

172
00:09:17,775 --> 00:09:19,375
hand-carved,

173
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:24,997
built in germany
in 1874 by, uh... uh...

174
00:09:26,749 --> 00:09:31,504
mr. Forstmann,
we were talking about you.

175
00:09:31,539 --> 00:09:34,640
Oh, i thought we were
talking about your clock.

176
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:35,641
Yes, we were,

177
00:09:35,676 --> 00:09:38,144
but we somehow
got off the track.

178
00:09:38,179 --> 00:09:40,513
Track? Are we going
to talk about trains now?

179
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,150
Mr. Forstmann,

180
00:09:44,185 --> 00:09:48,271
if you don't care to talk
about anything else...

181
00:09:48,306 --> 00:09:50,156
oh, i could talk
about clocks

182
00:09:50,191 --> 00:09:51,407
for hours, doctor.

183
00:09:51,442 --> 00:09:53,276
But your time's
expensive.

184
00:09:53,311 --> 00:09:54,527
Mine's free.

185
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:03,286
Oh, there, uh,
there is one thing, doctor.

186
00:10:03,321 --> 00:10:04,537
Yes?

187
00:10:04,572 --> 00:10:08,291
When my clock stops ticking,

188
00:10:08,326 --> 00:10:10,793
i'll die.

189
00:10:10,828 --> 00:10:13,296
You really believe that?

190
00:10:13,331 --> 00:10:16,048
Oh, there's no doubt about it.

191
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,933
Does that make me crazy?

192
00:10:17,968 --> 00:10:22,688
Well, crazy is a big word.

193
00:10:22,723 --> 00:10:26,192
But it is
a rather strange idea.

194
00:10:26,227 --> 00:10:29,061
If i had a clock like that
i'd get rid of it.

195
00:10:29,096 --> 00:10:32,198
Oh, either the clock goes
or i go.

196
00:10:32,233 --> 00:10:34,066
That's what you're telling me.

197
00:10:34,101 --> 00:10:35,951
I didn't say that.

198
00:10:35,986 --> 00:10:38,704
I think you did.

199
00:10:38,739 --> 00:10:40,573
Good day, doctor.

200
00:11:00,476 --> 00:11:01,727
Be careful, boy.

201
00:11:02,345 --> 00:11:03,095
Be careful.

202
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,980
Don't worry, pops,
we got it.

203
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:11,103
Right there.

204
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:18,994
Well, what do you think?

205
00:11:19,029 --> 00:11:20,746
I don't know, pops.

206
00:11:20,781 --> 00:11:22,615
I'm not
an interior decorator.

207
00:11:56,767 --> 00:11:58,117
Hey, wait.

208
00:11:58,152 --> 00:12:00,369
What happened?

209
00:12:00,404 --> 00:12:01,620
My clock!

210
00:12:01,655 --> 00:12:02,872
Now, look, pops.

211
00:12:02,907 --> 00:12:03,489
Take it easy.

212
00:12:03,524 --> 00:12:04,740
Oh, i'm all right.

213
00:12:05,241 --> 00:12:06,492
Boy...

214
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,244
you had
us worried

215
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:09,745
for a minute.

216
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:17,386
Not yet, i guess.

217
00:12:17,421 --> 00:12:18,637
Not yet.

218
00:12:26,762 --> 00:12:31,150
Doug, look.

219
00:12:31,185 --> 00:12:33,018
Oh, no, honey...

220
00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:34,270
he's trying to make

221
00:12:34,305 --> 00:12:36,155
some compromise
with us, doug.

222
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,406
Well, children.

223
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:42,278
Hello, grandpa.

224
00:12:42,313 --> 00:12:44,780
I thought
we'd give it a try there.

225
00:12:44,815 --> 00:12:46,031
To see how it looks.

226
00:12:46,066 --> 00:12:47,283
What do you think?

227
00:12:47,318 --> 00:12:50,419
I don't know.

228
00:12:50,454 --> 00:12:52,922
Sam, take a look
for yourself.

229
00:12:52,957 --> 00:12:56,041
It sticks out
like a sore thumb.

230
00:12:56,076 --> 00:13:00,429
Yeah, i guess it does.

231
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:02,932
Sam, we might
as well be honest.

232
00:13:02,967 --> 00:13:05,434
The doctor says
the clock should go.

233
00:13:05,469 --> 00:13:07,303
The doctor said that?

234
00:13:07,338 --> 00:13:11,056
He says you're being
obsessed by the clock.

235
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:12,308
He says
it's bad for you.

236
00:13:12,343 --> 00:13:14,810
Senile- that's what
he really said, isn't it?

237
00:13:14,845 --> 00:13:16,061
No, grandpa.

238
00:13:16,096 --> 00:13:17,947
And he wants you
to put me away.

239
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:20,449
No, grandpa,
he didn't say that.

240
00:13:20,484 --> 00:13:23,569
Well, i'm not going
to any loony bin.

241
00:13:23,604 --> 00:13:26,705
I'll tell you what
i am going to do.

242
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,574
I'm going to sell the clock.

243
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:34,830
I love this clock

244
00:13:34,865 --> 00:13:36,081
and your nursery
is beautiful.

245
00:13:36,116 --> 00:13:37,333
Marnie,
it's just perfect.

246
00:13:37,368 --> 00:13:39,218
Thank you.

247
00:13:39,253 --> 00:13:40,469
Do you want
some more coffee?

248
00:13:40,504 --> 00:13:41,720
We can talk a little bit.
Love it.

249
00:13:41,755 --> 00:13:43,589
You know, i refuse
to get pregnant

250
00:13:43,624 --> 00:13:45,474
until i have my
nursery all planned.

251
00:13:45,509 --> 00:13:47,092
George didn't think
that was logical.

252
00:13:47,127 --> 00:13:48,978
I have to agree
with him, carol.

253
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:51,480
Mr. Forstmann,
where will you be living

254
00:13:51,515 --> 00:13:52,731
after the baby comes?

255
00:13:53,983 --> 00:13:56,485
Carol, he'll be
staying right here

256
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,736
in his own room.

257
00:13:57,771 --> 00:14:02,107
Oh, well, of course,
i didn't mean anything.

258
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:09,114
I'll be
needing his help.

259
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:11,250
You going to keep
the clock here?

260
00:14:11,285 --> 00:14:12,501
Just temporarily.

261
00:14:12,536 --> 00:14:14,370
Carol, do you
know anyone

262
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,755
who might like to buy it?

263
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:19,375
Sure, me.

264
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:20,626
I wish i could afford it.

265
00:14:20,661 --> 00:14:21,877
Do you mean that?

266
00:14:21,912 --> 00:14:23,128
Do i?

267
00:14:23,163 --> 00:14:25,381
You know what i think
about antiques

268
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:27,883
and that clock will
just make our hallway.

269
00:14:27,918 --> 00:14:31,887
Oh, well, i think
that we can work out something.

270
00:14:31,922 --> 00:14:34,390
I mean, you could pay me later.

271
00:14:34,425 --> 00:14:35,891
It doesn't
matter.

272
00:14:35,926 --> 00:14:38,394
Are you serious, mr. Forstmann?

273
00:14:38,429 --> 00:14:39,144
Yes. It would be perfect.

274
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:41,030
You living next door to us

275
00:14:41,065 --> 00:14:43,532
i could visit
the clock every day.

276
00:14:43,567 --> 00:14:45,401
I mean, i could take care of it.

277
00:14:46,035 --> 00:14:47,403
Keep it
in good condition.

278
00:14:47,438 --> 00:14:48,654
And we'd appreciate it.

279
00:14:48,689 --> 00:14:51,040
It's not one
of your eight-day clocks.

280
00:14:51,075 --> 00:14:52,291
It's special.

281
00:14:52,326 --> 00:14:54,793
You have to wind it
every other day.

282
00:14:54,828 --> 00:14:56,045
Grandpa...

283
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,547
i don't think carol would
like you tinkering with it.

284
00:14:58,582 --> 00:14:59,798
It'll be her clock.

285
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:03,552
But it would only take
a few minutes every other day.

286
00:15:03,587 --> 00:15:05,421
Oh, i wouldn't mind, marnie,

287
00:15:05,456 --> 00:15:07,923
and he could take
good care of it.

288
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:10,426
I'd appreciate
it, really.

289
00:15:10,461 --> 00:15:12,311
It's up to you two, anyway.

290
00:15:12,346 --> 00:15:14,313
I can't wait to see
what it looks like.

291
00:15:14,348 --> 00:15:16,181
George doesn't think
i'm a bargain hunter.

292
00:15:16,216 --> 00:15:18,067
Wait till he hears about this.

293
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:37,202
Good morning,
marnie.

294
00:15:37,237 --> 00:15:39,088
Good morning,
grandpa.

295
00:15:39,123 --> 00:15:40,956
You're up early
this morning.

296
00:15:40,991 --> 00:15:43,459
Well, early to bed,
early to rise-

297
00:15:43,494 --> 00:15:45,344
you know,
ben franklin?

298
00:15:45,379 --> 00:15:47,212
Or was it
george washington?

299
00:15:47,247 --> 00:15:48,464
I'm off
to wind the clock.

300
00:15:49,098 --> 00:15:50,966
George and carol
are out of town.

301
00:15:51,001 --> 00:15:52,468
Didn't you
know that?

302
00:15:52,503 --> 00:15:53,102
Out of town?

303
00:15:53,137 --> 00:15:54,970
Just for the weekend.

304
00:15:55,005 --> 00:15:56,221
You'll hardly miss a visit
to your clock.

305
00:15:56,256 --> 00:16:00,609
Don't you realize that the clock
winds down after 48 hours?

306
00:16:00,644 --> 00:16:03,112
Grandpa, are you going
to start that again?

307
00:16:03,147 --> 00:16:04,980
We've all been so happy
for the past two weeks.

308
00:16:05,015 --> 00:16:06,231
All of us.

309
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:10,619
Yes, yes, we've been happy.

310
00:16:10,654 --> 00:16:14,373
Two weeks of borrowed time.

311
00:16:14,408 --> 00:16:18,127
I should be grateful.

312
00:17:36,572 --> 00:17:38,457
It's running out.

313
00:17:39,074 --> 00:17:42,211
It's dying.

314
00:17:57,843 --> 00:18:00,345
Hold it right there.

315
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:05,100
Look, officer, i have
to wind the clock, you know,

316
00:18:05,135 --> 00:18:06,351
it's running down.

317
00:18:06,386 --> 00:18:08,237
It must be wound,
it must be.

318
00:18:08,272 --> 00:18:10,105
Oh, sure, sure, mister.

319
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,356
Where do you live?

320
00:18:11,391 --> 00:18:12,608
I live next door there.

321
00:18:12,643 --> 00:18:15,110
But you don't understand-
i have to wind the clock.

322
00:18:15,145 --> 00:18:16,361
Come on, come on.

323
00:18:16,396 --> 00:18:18,864
You'll wake the
whole neighborhood.

324
00:18:18,899 --> 00:18:20,749
Look, please, just let me
wind the clock,

325
00:18:20,784 --> 00:18:22,000
and then i'll go home.

326
00:18:22,035 --> 00:18:23,252
That's private property.

327
00:18:23,287 --> 00:18:24,503
I can't let you
go in there.

328
00:18:24,538 --> 00:18:26,371
You have to!

329
00:18:26,406 --> 00:18:27,623
Now, look, mister,

330
00:18:27,658 --> 00:18:29,508
i can't let you
go in there.

331
00:18:29,543 --> 00:18:30,125
Don't you see?

332
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,628
Don't you see,
i'm running down.

333
00:18:32,663 --> 00:18:35,130
And if that stops,
i'll die.

334
00:18:35,165 --> 00:18:36,381
I'll really die.

335
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:37,633
Oh, i don't think so.

336
00:18:37,668 --> 00:18:40,135
You mustn't do this,
you mustn't.

337
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:43,272
Just let me wind
the clock, please.

338
00:18:47,643 --> 00:18:50,145
Can i get something
for you, grandpa?

339
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:55,784
I won't need anything.

340
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:05,410
Don't worry, marnie,
it's, it's better this way.

341
00:19:05,445 --> 00:19:06,795
Better?

342
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:17,172
Good night, grandpa.

343
00:19:20,309 --> 00:19:22,811
Good night, sweetheart.

344
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:41,580
It is...

345
00:19:41,615 --> 00:19:45,334
it is better this way.

346
00:19:47,836 --> 00:19:53,458
It has to come sometime.

347
00:19:53,493 --> 00:19:58,463
And i want it
to come for me here.

348
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:41,006
Sam, old friend...

349
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:44,142
it's been a good life.

350
00:20:44,177 --> 00:20:47,896
But now it's
time to go.

351
00:20:47,931 --> 00:20:53,402
Well, don't let me detain you.

352
00:20:53,437 --> 00:20:56,521
How the heck
did you get in my bedroom?

353
00:20:56,556 --> 00:20:58,657
I don't believe
we've been introduced.

354
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:06,031
Your face is familiar.

355
00:21:06,066 --> 00:21:09,418
I'm your spirit.

356
00:21:09,453 --> 00:21:11,920
Your time has come, sam.

357
00:21:11,955 --> 00:21:14,423
After all, you are 76.

358
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:17,175
Don't give me that
spirit of 76 stuff.

359
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:19,044
And who says it's my time to go?

360
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:21,680
Have you forgotten
what your father told you?

361
00:21:21,715 --> 00:21:23,432
And your grandfather?

362
00:21:23,467 --> 00:21:24,683
About what?

363
00:21:24,718 --> 00:21:26,935
Didn't they always tell you

364
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:31,306
that when the clock winds down
you'll die?

365
00:21:31,341 --> 00:21:32,808
Yes, and you know something?

366
00:21:32,843 --> 00:21:34,693
I used to believe that stuff.

367
00:21:34,728 --> 00:21:35,944
You should have.

368
00:21:35,979 --> 00:21:37,813
They told you often enough.

369
00:21:37,848 --> 00:21:39,064
But that's silly.

370
00:21:39,099 --> 00:21:40,315
Don't you
know that?

371
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:42,701
I do.

372
00:21:42,736 --> 00:21:44,569
I've been to a psychiatrist.

373
00:21:44,604 --> 00:21:46,204
So what?

374
00:21:46,239 --> 00:21:48,957
So he told me he didn't think
i needed the clock.

375
00:21:49,574 --> 00:21:51,460
And he didn't think i was crazy.

376
00:21:51,495 --> 00:21:52,711
And you know what?

377
00:21:52,746 --> 00:21:54,579
He was right and we're wrong.

378
00:21:54,614 --> 00:21:59,718
You know, personally,
i never trust the psychiatrists.

379
00:21:59,753 --> 00:22:03,088
Well, you're
from another generation.

380
00:22:03,123 --> 00:22:04,973
See, i live in the present.

381
00:22:05,008 --> 00:22:06,224
Live, i said.

382
00:22:06,259 --> 00:22:08,093
Look at me.

383
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:10,595
You're just a figment
of my imagination.

384
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:13,098
Why, i can see
right through you.

385
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:20,605
I've got
a great-grandchild coming.

386
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,359
And i plan to stay around
a while to play with him

387
00:22:24,394 --> 00:22:26,611
to, uh,
watch him grow,

388
00:22:26,646 --> 00:22:29,114
take him
to school.

389
00:22:29,149 --> 00:22:30,866
Maybe even to college.

390
00:22:30,901 --> 00:22:32,617
I repeat,

391
00:22:32,652 --> 00:22:34,503
i don't believe in you,

392
00:22:34,538 --> 00:22:37,622
therefore you don't exist,
right?

393
00:22:43,128 --> 00:22:44,379
Right.

394
00:22:57,776 --> 00:22:59,644
Marnie.

395
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:07,285
What are you doing up
this time of the night?

396
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,788
I was worried
about you, grandpa.

397
00:23:09,823 --> 00:23:11,039
The thing
to worry about

398
00:23:11,074 --> 00:23:13,542
is that great-grandchild
of mine.

399
00:23:13,577 --> 00:23:16,044
Now, you let me up,
let me out of this bed.

400
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:17,295
My goodness,

401
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:19,798
you shouldn't worry
about me.

402
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:22,300
Come on downstairs
and i'll get you

403
00:23:22,335 --> 00:23:24,169
a good cup
of hot chocolate.

404
00:23:24,204 --> 00:23:25,420
Be careful of the steps.

405
00:23:25,455 --> 00:23:28,557
Must be careful.

406
00:23:28,592 --> 00:23:31,059
It's my great-grandchild.

407
00:23:31,094 --> 00:23:34,813
Look out.

408
00:23:34,848 --> 00:23:36,681
Marnie?

409
00:23:36,716 --> 00:23:39,184
I think i cheated
your friend.

410
00:23:39,219 --> 00:23:42,320
That old clock
hasn't been running right

411
00:23:42,355 --> 00:23:44,189
for the last 40 years.

412
00:23:44,224 --> 00:23:47,943
Why, it's taken everything
i ever learned in clockmaking

413
00:23:47,978 --> 00:23:49,194
just to keep it going.

414
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:51,696
Really, grandpa?

415
00:23:51,731 --> 00:23:53,582
Uh, as a matter of fact,

416
00:23:53,617 --> 00:23:56,701
it stopped ticking
for the last time

417
00:23:56,736 --> 00:23:59,204
just a few moments ago.

418
00:23:59,239 --> 00:24:00,455
How do you
know that?

419
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:03,592
Don't ask me how i know

420
00:24:03,627 --> 00:24:05,460
but i know.

421
00:24:05,495 --> 00:24:08,597
And a strange thing
happened, marnie.

422
00:24:08,632 --> 00:24:11,716
When that clock died,

423
00:24:11,751 --> 00:24:14,853
i was born again.

424
00:24:14,888 --> 00:24:17,973
Clocks are made by men,
god creates time.

425
00:24:18,008 --> 00:24:20,475
No man can prolong
his allotted hours,

426
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:23,612
he can only live them
to the fullest-

427
00:24:23,647 --> 00:24:26,114
in this world
or in the twilight zone.

428
00:24:29,851 --> 00:24:31,036
And now, mr. Serling.

429
00:24:31,071 --> 00:24:32,904
Next time we enlist the aid

430
00:24:32,939 --> 00:24:34,789
of a very talented scribe,
earl hamner, jr.

431
00:24:34,824 --> 00:24:36,658
He's written a story called
"ring-a-ding girl"

432
00:24:36,693 --> 00:24:37,909
and in the milieu of fantasy,

433
00:24:37,944 --> 00:24:39,794
this one is strictly
a blue ribbon entry.

434
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:43,548
It stars maggie mcnamara
and it involves a movie actress,

435
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:45,417
a publicity tour,
a strange flight, an airplane,

436
00:24:45,452 --> 00:24:47,302
and some occult occurrences

437
00:24:47,337 --> 00:24:49,804
designed to send shivers through
you like a fast subway train.

438
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:51,673
Next time out on
the twilight zone,

439
00:24:51,708 --> 00:24:54,176
"ring-a-ding girl."
