1
00:00:09,776 --> 00:00:11,644
You're traveling
through another dimension-

2
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,398
a dimension not only of sight
and sound, but of mind,

3
00:00:15,433 --> 00:00:17,283
a journey into a wondrous land

4
00:00:17,318 --> 00:00:19,152
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

5
00:00:19,187 --> 00:00:22,288
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

6
00:02:46,968 --> 00:02:48,184
Help!

7
00:02:48,219 --> 00:02:50,687
Please help!

8
00:02:50,722 --> 00:02:52,555
Who is it?

9
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:55,058
Go away.

10
00:02:55,093 --> 00:02:56,309
I've been shot.

11
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:58,811
I need help.

12
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:00,697
Who are you?

13
00:03:00,732 --> 00:03:03,199
An... officer.

14
00:03:03,234 --> 00:03:04,450
Police.

15
00:03:04,485 --> 00:03:06,953
Please,
open the door.

16
00:03:06,988 --> 00:03:08,821
I need help.

17
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:10,707
You're lying to me.

18
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:13,209
I know you.

19
00:03:13,244 --> 00:03:15,078
You can't fool me.

20
00:03:15,113 --> 00:03:17,580
Help.

21
00:03:17,615 --> 00:03:18,831
You're lying.

22
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:21,334
You're no policeman.

23
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:26,339
Why can't you
leave me alone?

24
00:03:26,374 --> 00:03:28,841
I know who you are.

25
00:03:32,595 --> 00:03:35,732
I knowwhatyou are.

26
00:03:40,103 --> 00:03:43,106
An old woman
living in a nightmare.

27
00:03:43,141 --> 00:03:46,859
An old woman who has fought
a thousand battles with death

28
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:48,745
and always won.

29
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,247
Now she's faced
with a grim decision:

30
00:03:51,282 --> 00:03:53,750
Whether or not to open a door.

31
00:03:53,785 --> 00:03:56,252
And in some strange
and frightening way,

32
00:03:56,287 --> 00:03:59,372
she knows that this
seemingly ordinary door

33
00:03:59,407 --> 00:04:01,257
leads to the twilight zone.

34
00:04:06,129 --> 00:04:08,631
Won't somebody help?

35
00:04:31,823 --> 00:04:34,907
Unless you help me,

36
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:38,044
i'm going to die.

37
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:39,295
I...

38
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:41,798
i don't think
i can move.

39
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:44,917
Don't say that,
it isn't fair.

40
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:48,054
You're trying
to trick me.

41
00:04:48,089 --> 00:04:51,174
Don't move.

42
00:04:51,808 --> 00:04:53,810
L-l-i'll close the door.

43
00:04:53,845 --> 00:04:55,061
What?

44
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:59,816
I've been shot.

45
00:04:59,851 --> 00:05:02,318
I'm bleeding to death.

46
00:05:02,353 --> 00:05:04,821
Please.

47
00:05:04,856 --> 00:05:09,826
My name is harold... beldon.

48
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:11,694
I need a doctor.

49
00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:14,197
Please, call the hospital.

50
00:05:14,232 --> 00:05:17,333
I haven't got a telephone.

51
00:05:17,368 --> 00:05:20,453
I'd have to unlock the door.

52
00:05:20,488 --> 00:05:24,207
You can't ask me to do that.

53
00:05:24,242 --> 00:05:26,709
I don't want to die.

54
00:05:27,343 --> 00:05:31,097
You understand.

55
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:33,966
I know who you are.

56
00:05:34,717 --> 00:05:37,854
You're not going to help me?

57
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:41,607
You're going to let me die?

58
00:05:41,642 --> 00:05:45,111
I don't understand.

59
00:05:45,146 --> 00:05:49,482
But... it hurts.

60
00:05:50,768 --> 00:05:51,367
Oh, it hurts.

61
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:54,487
Stop. Stop.

62
00:05:54,522 --> 00:05:57,623
Why do you torture me?

63
00:05:57,658 --> 00:06:00,126
It isn't fair.

64
00:06:00,161 --> 00:06:03,880
I... i can't move.

65
00:06:03,915 --> 00:06:05,748
I...

66
00:06:05,783 --> 00:06:08,251
ooh, it hurts.

67
00:06:08,286 --> 00:06:10,386
It isn't fair.

68
00:06:12,255 --> 00:06:16,642
It isn't fair.

69
00:06:41,784 --> 00:06:44,670
I'm still alive.

70
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:40,843
Now, listen, you should
try and get some rest.

71
00:07:40,878 --> 00:07:43,346
Really, i feel much better.

72
00:07:43,381 --> 00:07:47,733
When the doctor gets here,
he'll take me off your hands.

73
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:52,605
You didn't call the doctor.

74
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:56,859
Why not?

75
00:07:57,493 --> 00:07:59,362
I haven't got
a telephone.

76
00:07:59,397 --> 00:08:03,115
But couldn't you go
to one of the neighbors?

77
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:06,252
There aren't any,
they've all moved away.

78
00:08:06,287 --> 00:08:09,372
Trucks came and took
away their furniture.

79
00:08:09,407 --> 00:08:11,874
First one and
then another.

80
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:16,262
And...

81
00:08:16,297 --> 00:08:19,382
even-even if i could
call a doctor somehow,

82
00:08:19,417 --> 00:08:23,135
i couldn't take a chance
and let him in.

83
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,638
Don't you see?

84
00:08:25,673 --> 00:08:28,140
He might behim.

85
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:30,643
Him?

86
00:08:30,678 --> 00:08:32,528
Mr. Death.

87
00:08:32,563 --> 00:08:34,397
I know he's out there.

88
00:08:35,031 --> 00:08:36,899
He's trying to get in.

89
00:08:36,934 --> 00:08:39,402
He comes to the door
and knocks.

90
00:08:39,437 --> 00:08:41,904
He begs me to let him in.

91
00:08:41,939 --> 00:08:45,041
Last week he said
he came from the gas company.

92
00:08:45,076 --> 00:08:47,543
Oh, he's clever.

93
00:08:47,578 --> 00:08:51,297
After that, he claimed to be
a contractor hired by the city.

94
00:08:51,914 --> 00:08:53,799
I knew who he was.

95
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:56,919
He said this building
was condemned

96
00:08:56,954 --> 00:08:58,804
that i'd have to leave.

97
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:01,924
I kept the door locked,

98
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:04,427
and he went away.

99
00:09:04,462 --> 00:09:06,312
He knows i'm onto him.

100
00:09:07,563 --> 00:09:09,432
Mr. Death?

101
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:15,071
Is this a person,
like you or me?

102
00:09:15,106 --> 00:09:17,073
I know it sounds crazy,

103
00:09:17,108 --> 00:09:19,575
but it's true.

104
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:21,444
I know it's true.

105
00:09:21,479 --> 00:09:23,329
But
people die

106
00:09:23,364 --> 00:09:25,197
all over
the world.

107
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:28,084
Now how could one man
be in all those places

108
00:09:28,119 --> 00:09:29,335
at once?

109
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,203
I don't know.

110
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:33,706
Don't ask me that.

111
00:09:33,741 --> 00:09:37,460
Maybe there is more than one.

112
00:09:37,495 --> 00:09:38,711
Maybe...

113
00:09:40,596 --> 00:09:43,099
please don't cry, i...

114
00:09:43,134 --> 00:09:46,218
i don't want
to hurt you.

115
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:48,104
Please, i'm sorry.

116
00:09:49,972 --> 00:09:51,857
There.

117
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:01,233
At first,

118
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:04,370
i couldn't be sure.

119
00:10:04,405 --> 00:10:06,872
It was a long time ago.

120
00:10:06,907 --> 00:10:08,741
I was on a bus.

121
00:10:08,776 --> 00:10:11,243
There was
an old woman

122
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:13,746
sitting in front
of me knitting.

123
00:10:13,781 --> 00:10:17,500
Socks, i think.

124
00:10:17,535 --> 00:10:20,002
There was something
about her face.

125
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:23,139
I thought i knew her.

126
00:10:23,174 --> 00:10:26,258
Then this
young man got on.

127
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:30,646
There were empty seats,
but he sat down beside her.

128
00:10:30,681 --> 00:10:33,149
He didn't say
anything, but...

129
00:10:33,184 --> 00:10:38,154
his being there upset her.

130
00:10:38,189 --> 00:10:40,656
He seemed a nice young man.

131
00:10:40,691 --> 00:10:43,159
When she dropped her yarn,

132
00:10:43,194 --> 00:10:46,278
he picked it up,
right in front of me.

133
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:48,781
He held it out to her.

134
00:10:48,816 --> 00:10:52,535
I saw their fingers touch.

135
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:57,540
He got out at the next stop.

136
00:10:57,575 --> 00:11:02,545
When the bus reached
the end of the line...

137
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:05,047
she was dead.

138
00:11:05,082 --> 00:11:06,298
Hmm.

139
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:10,686
But you said yourself
she was an old woman.

140
00:11:10,721 --> 00:11:13,689
But i've seen him since,
several times.

141
00:11:13,724 --> 00:11:17,443
I've seen him in crowds,
i've watched for him.

142
00:11:17,478 --> 00:11:21,197
Every time someone i knew died,
he was there.

143
00:11:21,232 --> 00:11:23,699
Once he was a young soldier,

144
00:11:23,734 --> 00:11:26,819
a salesman, a taxi driver-

145
00:11:26,854 --> 00:11:29,955
someone you wouldn't notice

146
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,824
unless you
were watching.

147
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:34,326
I wondered why
i could see him

148
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:37,463
and that no one
else could.

149
00:11:37,498 --> 00:11:39,715
Then i knew.

150
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,835
It was because
i was getting older

151
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,720
and my time was coming.

152
00:11:44,755 --> 00:11:48,474
I could see clearer than
younger people could.

153
00:11:48,509 --> 00:11:49,975
All right.

154
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:53,095
But if you knew what he
looked like, why be afraid?

155
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:55,231
You could avoid him.

156
00:11:55,266 --> 00:11:58,350
Because his face is always
different, i couldn't be sure.

157
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:00,736
How about when you go out?

158
00:12:00,771 --> 00:12:02,988
Couldn't he touch you then

159
00:12:03,023 --> 00:12:04,240
if he wanted to?

160
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:06,108
I never go out.

161
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:07,493
Never?

162
00:12:07,528 --> 00:12:11,247
I haven't been
out for years.

163
00:12:11,282 --> 00:12:14,366
Well, what do you do about food?

164
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,619
A boy delivers it.

165
00:12:16,654 --> 00:12:19,121
I leave him money and a list.

166
00:12:19,755 --> 00:12:22,258
And i always wait
until he's gone away

167
00:12:22,293 --> 00:12:24,760
before i unlock the door.

168
00:12:24,795 --> 00:12:27,880
How can you live like this?

169
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:30,516
If i don't live like this,
i won't live at all.

170
00:12:30,551 --> 00:12:32,017
If i don't watch out,

171
00:12:32,052 --> 00:12:34,520
if i let down
even for a moment,

172
00:12:34,555 --> 00:12:35,771
he'll get in.

173
00:12:35,806 --> 00:12:38,274
I know he will.

174
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,398
I haven't always
lived like this.

175
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:50,152
I was young once.

176
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:54,540
People said i was pretty.

177
00:12:55,157 --> 00:12:58,294
I lived out in the sunlight.

178
00:13:00,796 --> 00:13:05,801
People said i'd spoil
my fine complexion.

179
00:13:05,836 --> 00:13:07,670
I didn't care.

180
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:12,675
I loved outdoor things.

181
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,062
I lived out in the sunlight.

182
00:13:20,182 --> 00:13:23,936
I've always hated
the dark and the cold.

183
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:28,941
I'm old.

184
00:13:28,976 --> 00:13:31,443
I've lived a long time.

185
00:13:33,329 --> 00:13:35,831
But i don't want to die.

186
00:13:35,866 --> 00:13:38,334
I'd rather live in the dark

187
00:13:38,369 --> 00:13:41,453
than not live at all.

188
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:48,961
Here.

189
00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:52,097
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

190
00:13:52,132 --> 00:13:53,966
We're alone here.

191
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:56,468
And there's nobody at the door.

192
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:58,354
You need some rest...

193
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:08,364
and i need help.

194
00:14:53,909 --> 00:14:56,412
No.

195
00:14:56,447 --> 00:14:58,414
There's nothing to be afraid of.

196
00:14:58,449 --> 00:15:01,533
You better answer it.

197
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,789
Go on.

198
00:15:06,824 --> 00:15:08,674
That's right.

199
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:11,176
Go ahead.

200
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:16,432
Go ahead,
answer it.

201
00:15:21,437 --> 00:15:25,441
I'm sorry, lady,
but i've got my orders.

202
00:15:27,943 --> 00:15:30,062
I can't fool around any longer.

203
00:15:52,635 --> 00:15:54,503
Easy, lady.

204
00:15:54,538 --> 00:15:56,388
Just lie quiet

205
00:15:56,423 --> 00:15:59,508
till you get
your strength back.

206
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:05,898
You gave me quite a scare
when you caved in like that.

207
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:15,774
And still i live.

208
00:16:18,027 --> 00:16:20,529
You got to understand,
ma'am, i...

209
00:16:20,564 --> 00:16:24,283
i don't get no pleasure
out of busting in doors.

210
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:26,669
You don't seem
to realize

211
00:16:26,704 --> 00:16:29,171
how important
this is.

212
00:16:29,206 --> 00:16:31,924
I've got a-a crew and
equipment coming in an hour

213
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:33,175
to pull this tenement down.

214
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:36,795
Begging your pardon, ma'am,
but it's long overdue.

215
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,298
I'm surprised
it's still standing.

216
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:41,800
And you're really...

217
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:43,686
not mr. Death?

218
00:16:48,057 --> 00:16:49,942
Well...

219
00:16:49,977 --> 00:16:52,444
i don't know what
you're talking about.

220
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,313
All i know is

221
00:16:54,348 --> 00:16:57,449
i got a contract to demolish
this row of buildings.

222
00:16:57,484 --> 00:16:59,952
Everybody else
moved out long ago.

223
00:16:59,987 --> 00:17:01,203
Until the other day,

224
00:17:01,238 --> 00:17:03,572
i thought this building
was deserted.

225
00:17:03,607 --> 00:17:06,709
I seen them windows boarded up,
and i figured you moved, too.

226
00:17:06,744 --> 00:17:09,328
You want me to go outside?

227
00:17:09,363 --> 00:17:12,464
You want me to leave here?

228
00:17:12,499 --> 00:17:14,967
I can't.

229
00:17:15,002 --> 00:17:17,219
You were notified months ago,
right?

230
00:17:17,254 --> 00:17:19,088
I'm just trying to do my job.

231
00:17:19,123 --> 00:17:21,590
These buildings
were condemned by the city,

232
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,475
and i'm the one

233
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,843
who's got
to tear them down.

234
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:26,729
How can you.

235
00:17:26,764 --> 00:17:29,231
This building has had it.

236
00:17:29,266 --> 00:17:31,100
It's worn out,
used up.

237
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:34,853
All these buildings
have got to come down.

238
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:43,612
I ain't a monster, lady.

239
00:17:43,647 --> 00:17:46,749
I... i've got a heart
just like anybody else,

240
00:17:46,784 --> 00:17:50,502
but, uh...

241
00:17:50,537 --> 00:17:53,005
i can see how you
could get attached to a place

242
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,873
and not want
to see it wrecked,

243
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:57,376
but when a building is old,
it's dangerous.

244
00:17:57,411 --> 00:18:02,381
It's got to come down
to make room for a new one.

245
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:05,517
That's life, lady.

246
00:18:05,552 --> 00:18:09,271
Old make room for the new.

247
00:18:09,306 --> 00:18:11,140
Well, people get the idea

248
00:18:11,175 --> 00:18:13,642
that i'm kind of destroyer,
but...

249
00:18:14,276 --> 00:18:18,030
they think i get kicks
out of tearing stuff down.

250
00:18:18,065 --> 00:18:20,532
That ain't the way it is.

251
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:24,903
I... i just clear the ground
so other people can build.

252
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:26,789
In a way,
i help them do it.

253
00:18:26,824 --> 00:18:29,908
Look around-
it's the way things are.

254
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:33,045
A big tree falls,
and a new one

255
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:36,165
grow right out
of the same ground.

256
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,667
Old animals die and...

257
00:18:38,702 --> 00:18:42,421
young ones
take their places.

258
00:18:42,456 --> 00:18:46,809
Even people step aside
when it's time.

259
00:18:46,844 --> 00:18:49,311
I won't.

260
00:18:53,682 --> 00:18:56,185
The door.

261
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,439
There's no need
in that.

262
00:19:00,474 --> 00:19:02,941
Now, what's the sense
of locking a door

263
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:04,827
that won't even
be here in an hour?

264
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:07,946
If you've got any
possessions you'd want to keep,

265
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:11,083
i'd move them out.
I'll help you.

266
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:15,454
Now, look, i've been
trying to go easy,

267
00:19:15,489 --> 00:19:17,339
but if you insist
on staying here,

268
00:19:17,374 --> 00:19:20,459
i'll have to call a cop.

269
00:19:20,494 --> 00:19:23,595
Please cooperate, lady.

270
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,464
Of course.

271
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:27,966
Explain to him.

272
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:31,720
Tell him the reason
i can't go out there.

273
00:19:31,755 --> 00:19:34,857
You'll help me,
won't you?

274
00:19:34,892 --> 00:19:37,359
What are you doing?

275
00:19:37,394 --> 00:19:39,228
Who are you talking to?

276
00:19:39,263 --> 00:19:42,981
Mr. Beldon
is a policeman.

277
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:44,233
Please tell him.

278
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:48,620
I'm sorry, but if
you're still here

279
00:19:48,655 --> 00:19:50,489
when the crew arrives,

280
00:19:50,524 --> 00:19:52,991
i'll have to call a cop.

281
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:06,138
Why didn't you help me?

282
00:20:06,173 --> 00:20:08,640
I thought you understood.

283
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:17,266
You.

284
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:23,522
He looked right at you

285
00:20:23,557 --> 00:20:26,024
and didn't see you.

286
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:31,029
No!

287
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:34,783
Look in the mirror, wanda.

288
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:55,938
You tricked me.

289
00:20:55,973 --> 00:20:57,806
It was you

290
00:20:57,841 --> 00:21:00,442
all the time.

291
00:21:00,477 --> 00:21:01,693
Yes.

292
00:21:01,728 --> 00:21:04,196
I tricked you.

293
00:21:04,231 --> 00:21:05,948
But why?

294
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:08,450
The moment i let you inside,

295
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:12,204
you could have taken me
anytime.

296
00:21:12,239 --> 00:21:14,706
But you were nice.

297
00:21:14,741 --> 00:21:17,826
You made me trust you.

298
00:21:17,861 --> 00:21:22,831
But i had
to make you understand.

299
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:30,088
Am i really so bad?

300
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:33,225
Am i really so frightening?

301
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,844
You've talked to me,

302
00:21:35,879 --> 00:21:37,729
you've confided in me.

303
00:21:37,764 --> 00:21:40,232
Have i tried to hurt you?

304
00:21:43,986 --> 00:21:46,488
It isn't me you're afraid of.

305
00:21:46,523 --> 00:21:49,608
You understand me.

306
00:21:49,643 --> 00:21:51,493
What you're afraid of

307
00:21:51,528 --> 00:21:53,996
is the unknown.

308
00:21:54,031 --> 00:21:55,247
Don't...

309
00:21:55,864 --> 00:21:58,367
don't be afraid.

310
00:21:58,402 --> 00:22:00,869
But i am afraid.

311
00:22:00,904 --> 00:22:02,754
The running's over.

312
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:07,125
It's time to rest.

313
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:11,513
Give me

314
00:22:11,548 --> 00:22:13,382
your hand.

315
00:22:13,417 --> 00:22:17,135
But i don't want to die.

316
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:19,021
Trust me.

317
00:22:21,023 --> 00:22:22,274
No.

318
00:22:24,142 --> 00:22:26,645
No.

319
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:30,399
Mother,

320
00:22:30,434 --> 00:22:32,901
give me your hand.

321
00:22:50,168 --> 00:22:51,420
You see,

322
00:22:51,553 --> 00:22:54,056
no shock.

323
00:22:54,091 --> 00:22:57,809
No engulfment.

324
00:22:57,844 --> 00:22:59,061
No tearing
asunder.

325
00:22:59,096 --> 00:23:03,932
What you feared would
come like an explosion

326
00:23:03,967 --> 00:23:06,435
is like a whisper.

327
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:08,320
What you thought
was the end

328
00:23:08,437 --> 00:23:09,688
is the beginning.

329
00:23:09,723 --> 00:23:13,442
When will it happen?

330
00:23:13,477 --> 00:23:14,693
When will we go?

331
00:23:14,728 --> 00:23:16,945
Go?

332
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,082
Look.

333
00:23:27,089 --> 00:23:30,208
We have
already begun.

334
00:23:50,228 --> 00:23:53,365
There was an old woman
who lived in a room

335
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,485
and, like all of us,
was frightened of the dark,

336
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,987
but who discovered in a minute
last fragment of her life

337
00:23:59,022 --> 00:24:00,872
that there was nothing
in the dark that wasn't there

338
00:24:00,907 --> 00:24:02,741
when the lights were on.

339
00:24:02,776 --> 00:24:06,495
Object lesson for the more
frightened amongst us, in or out

340
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:08,997
of the twilight zone.

341
00:24:11,399 --> 00:24:14,336
Rod serling,
creator ofthe twilight zone,

342
00:24:14,371 --> 00:24:16,221
will tell you
about next week's story

343
00:24:16,256 --> 00:24:19,624
after this message.

344
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,726
And now, mr. Serling.

345
00:24:21,761 --> 00:24:22,978
Next week, onthe twilight zone,

346
00:24:23,013 --> 00:24:26,731
we let you in on a... an
extravagant practical joke.

347
00:24:26,766 --> 00:24:29,234
A man who wants
to convey an illusion

348
00:24:29,269 --> 00:24:31,102
that the world
is coming to an end.

349
00:24:31,137 --> 00:24:32,988
Now there are jokes
and there are jokes,

350
00:24:33,023 --> 00:24:34,856
but this one
stands all by itself

351
00:24:34,891 --> 00:24:38,610
as an exercise in the very
different and the very bizarre.

352
00:24:38,645 --> 00:24:41,746
Our play is called
"one more pallbearer,"

353
00:24:41,781 --> 00:24:44,866
and we commend it to you
as something quite special.

354
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:17,866
This is james arness.

355
00:25:17,901 --> 00:25:19,734
You know, it's only a short hop

356
00:25:19,769 --> 00:25:22,237
fromthe twilight zone
to dodge city ingunsmoke.

357
00:25:22,272 --> 00:25:24,739
Saturday nights
over most of these stations.
