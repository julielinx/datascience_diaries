00:00:05,972 --> 00:00:09,726
You unlock this door
with the key of imagination.

2
00:00:09,761 --> 00:00:11,611
Beyond it is another dimension-

3
00:00:11,646 --> 00:00:14,114
a dimension of sound,

4
00:00:14,149 --> 00:00:15,982
a dimension of sight,

5
00:00:16,017 --> 00:00:18,485
a dimension of mind.

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,987
You're moving into a land
of both shadow and substance,

7
00:00:21,022 --> 00:00:22,872
of things and ideas.

8
00:00:22,907 --> 00:00:26,626
You've just crossed over
into the twilight zone.

9
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:47,263
Mr. Smith-

10
00:00:47,298 --> 00:00:49,766
what's your present
course and speed?

11
00:00:49,801 --> 00:00:52,268
Setting on course
2-6-0 degrees through.

12
00:00:52,303 --> 00:00:53,520
Speed, 10 knots,
sir.

13
00:00:53,555 --> 00:00:55,405
Come right
to new course 2-7-0

14
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,907
and navigate turns
for 15 knots.

15
00:00:57,942 --> 00:00:58,525
Aye, aye, sir.

16
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,410
Come right to
new course 2-7-0.

17
00:01:01,027 --> 00:01:01,778
Aye, sir.

18
00:01:01,813 --> 00:01:04,280
Coming right to
new course, 2-7-0.

19
00:01:04,315 --> 00:01:06,166
All engines
ahead standard

20
00:01:06,201 --> 00:01:08,668
indicate 1-2-6,
turns for 15 knots.

21
00:01:08,703 --> 00:01:11,171
Aye, sir.

22
00:01:11,206 --> 00:01:13,039
All engines ahead
standard.

23
00:01:13,074 --> 00:01:15,542
1-2-6 turns
for 15 knots.

24
00:01:15,577 --> 00:01:16,793
Engine room answers.

25
00:01:16,828 --> 00:01:18,678
All engines ahead
standard,

26
00:01:18,713 --> 00:01:20,547
1-2-6 turns
for 15 knots, sir.

27
00:01:20,582 --> 00:01:21,798
Very well.

28
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:24,934
Steady on new course 2-7-0, sir.

29
00:01:24,969 --> 00:01:26,803
Very well.

30
00:01:37,313 --> 00:01:37,947
Damage report, sir,

31
00:01:37,982 --> 00:01:39,816
on the motor
whale boat.

32
00:01:39,851 --> 00:01:41,067
Let's hear it.

33
00:01:41,102 --> 00:01:42,952
It's completely
filled with water.

34
00:01:42,987 --> 00:01:45,455
It took a licking
in that storm.

35
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:47,323
It was a corker
of a swell, sir.

36
00:01:47,358 --> 00:01:49,826
I'm aware of the
storm, mr. Marmer.

37
00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:51,711
I'm also aware
of the swell,

38
00:01:51,746 --> 00:01:54,831
and i'm aware that
that boat was not
properly secured

39
00:01:54,866 --> 00:01:56,082
for heavy weather.

40
00:01:56,117 --> 00:01:58,585
A 13-year-old sea scout
would've rigged in

41
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:01,087
and secured that
boat properly.

42
00:02:01,122 --> 00:02:01,721
Yes, sir.

43
00:02:01,756 --> 00:02:03,590
Tell the chief
boatswain's mate

44
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:05,475
i want to see him
in my cabin.

45
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:06,726
Aye, aye, sir.

46
00:02:06,761 --> 00:02:07,977
On the double!

47
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:22,358
Chief boatswain's mate bell
reporting as ordered, sir.

48
00:02:22,393 --> 00:02:24,861
At ease, chief.

49
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:28,615
That shouldn't be
too difficult for you,

50
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,500
should it?

51
00:02:30,535 --> 00:02:31,117
Sir?

52
00:02:31,152 --> 00:02:33,002
The state of
being at ease.

53
00:02:33,037 --> 00:02:34,871
You're the champion
of the fleet,

54
00:02:34,906 --> 00:02:36,756
when it comes
to being at ease, bell.

55
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:39,509
I don't understand, sir.

56
00:02:39,544 --> 00:02:41,010
You're the chief
boatswain's mate.

57
00:02:41,045 --> 00:02:42,262
You run the deck division,

58
00:02:42,297 --> 00:02:43,513
handle the boat's rigging
in and out,

59
00:02:43,548 --> 00:02:45,381
supervise the heavy equipment

60
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:47,884
and eight or ten other cardinal
duties you're responsible for,

61
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:50,386
not the least of which,
chief boatswain's mate bell,

62
00:02:50,421 --> 00:02:52,272
is the proper securing
of the whale boat!

63
00:02:52,307 --> 00:02:53,890
Now, last night,
we had a bad swell.

64
00:02:53,925 --> 00:02:55,775
That boat should've
been rigged in.

65
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,644
Instead it was
left swung out,

66
00:02:57,679 --> 00:02:59,529
and as a result,
she's 80% damaged

67
00:02:59,564 --> 00:03:00,780
and filled up
like a pool.

68
00:03:00,815 --> 00:03:03,650
Where were you?

69
00:03:05,034 --> 00:03:06,903
Begging the captain's
pardon, i...

70
00:03:06,938 --> 00:03:08,788
don't beg
my pardon!

71
00:03:08,823 --> 00:03:10,657
Just tell me,
in a brief explanatory way,

72
00:03:10,692 --> 00:03:11,908
why you couldn't handle
the initiatives

73
00:03:12,542 --> 00:03:13,159
of a chief
boatswain's mate,

74
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:16,412
and why the efficiency
of this ship suffered.

75
00:03:16,447 --> 00:03:18,047
We had nine
hours' warning

76
00:03:18,082 --> 00:03:19,916
of that storm,
bell.

77
00:03:19,951 --> 00:03:21,301
This ship should've
been 100% prepared.

78
00:03:21,918 --> 00:03:23,803
Instead it wasn't,
and i want to know why!

79
00:03:23,838 --> 00:03:26,556
I did the best i could, sir.

80
00:03:26,591 --> 00:03:28,424
I...

81
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:31,561
i haven't been feeling
up to par.

82
00:03:34,063 --> 00:03:36,566
Well, did you report
to sick bay?

83
00:03:37,433 --> 00:03:42,438
No, sir, i didn't
report to, um...

84
00:03:42,473 --> 00:03:44,324
to, uh, to sick bay, sir.

85
00:03:48,945 --> 00:03:50,830
Now, look, chief,

86
00:03:50,865 --> 00:03:53,950
i'm not in business
to pistol-whip my crew.

87
00:03:53,985 --> 00:03:56,452
I want a tight ship,
that's true-

88
00:03:56,487 --> 00:03:58,338
but i happen to care very much

89
00:03:58,373 --> 00:04:00,840
if one of my sailors
has a problem

90
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,709
and can't function
because of it.

91
00:04:02,744 --> 00:04:03,960
You've rated
4-0

92
00:04:04,594 --> 00:04:05,845
all the way
down the line

93
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,348
for as long as you've
served on this ship.

94
00:04:08,383 --> 00:04:10,717
Suddenly,
in the last three days,

95
00:04:10,752 --> 00:04:13,219
you've stowed away
your seamanship in the trunk

96
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:16,973
and come up with some dumbhead
boners i wouldn't expect

97
00:04:17,008 --> 00:04:18,725
from a
17-year-old boot.

98
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,861
Bell, what is the problem?

99
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:25,732
There is
a problem, then.

100
00:04:25,767 --> 00:04:27,617
No, sir, no problem, sir.

101
00:04:27,652 --> 00:04:28,868
I...

102
00:04:28,903 --> 00:04:31,371
i'll watch it
in the future, sir.

103
00:04:31,406 --> 00:04:33,373
All right.

104
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:37,126
We'll leave it that way, then.

105
00:04:40,496 --> 00:04:44,250
If you want to bend my ear,
you know where my cabin is.

106
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:46,252
Aye, sir.

107
00:05:00,016 --> 00:05:02,518
Chief?

108
00:05:02,553 --> 00:05:04,404
Hey, chief,
you all right?

109
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:07,523
You okay, chief?

110
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:10,660
You look a little
woozy there.

111
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:14,414
Yeah.

112
00:05:14,449 --> 00:05:15,665
Yeah, i'm okay.

113
00:05:22,538 --> 00:05:27,176
Sir, contact
bearing 2-8-0.

114
00:05:27,211 --> 00:05:28,428
1,100 yards.

115
00:05:28,463 --> 00:05:30,930
Echo quality
is sharp.

116
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,684
Evaluate as
possible submarine

117
00:05:34,719 --> 00:05:37,186
but not moving.

118
00:05:37,221 --> 00:05:39,055
Plotting dead
in the water.

119
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:40,306
D.i.w.?

120
00:05:40,341 --> 00:05:41,557
Ship to listen.

121
00:05:47,231 --> 00:05:49,699
Sounds like...

122
00:05:49,734 --> 00:05:52,201
sounds like
hammering or
something, sir.

123
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:57,206
Bridge, sonar.

124
00:05:58,574 --> 00:05:59,826
Bridge on.

125
00:05:59,861 --> 00:06:02,578
I have sonar contact
bearing 2-8-0 degrees

126
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:03,830
true range 1,100 yards.

127
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:06,332
Sounds like
a metal object.

128
00:06:12,088 --> 00:06:15,224
Bearing clear.

129
00:06:15,259 --> 00:06:17,093
What kind of
object, sonar?

130
00:06:17,128 --> 00:06:18,227
We can't tell, sir.

131
00:06:18,262 --> 00:06:20,730
From its appearance
on the scope,

132
00:06:20,765 --> 00:06:22,598
it's some kind
of large object.

133
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:23,850
It could be a submarine.

134
00:06:23,885 --> 00:06:26,235
Bridge, aye.

135
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,104
Sonar puts
a contact, captain.

136
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:29,989
2-8-0, 1,100 yards.

137
00:06:30,024 --> 00:06:31,858
Evaluation,
a possible submarine.

138
00:06:31,893 --> 00:06:33,743
Possible submarine?

139
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,611
Stay on course.

140
00:06:35,646 --> 00:06:37,497
I want to check
the scope.

141
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:54,130
Incident 100 miles off
the coast of guadalcanal.

142
00:06:54,165 --> 00:06:56,015
Time, the present.

143
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:59,135
The united states naval
destroyer on what has been

144
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:01,020
a most uneventful cruise.

145
00:07:01,055 --> 00:07:03,523
In a moment, they're going
to send a man down 30 fathoms

146
00:07:03,558 --> 00:07:04,774
and check on a noisemaker-

147
00:07:04,809 --> 00:07:06,642
someone or something
tapping on metal.

148
00:07:06,677 --> 00:07:09,779
You may or may not read
the results in a naval report

149
00:07:09,814 --> 00:07:13,533
because captain beecham and
his crew have just set a course

150
00:07:13,568 --> 00:07:16,652
that will lead this ship
and everyone on it

151
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:18,538
into the twilight zone.

152
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:55,858
How long have you been
in contact?

153
00:07:55,893 --> 00:07:57,743
About three
minutes, sir.

154
00:08:01,532 --> 00:08:03,366
It's a funny one.

155
00:08:03,401 --> 00:08:05,868
Sure sounds like
tapping on metal.

156
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:07,753
That's what
i think, sir.

157
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:17,129
Bridge, change course to 0-3-0
and reduce speed to five knots.

158
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:18,264
Bridge, aye.

159
00:08:18,881 --> 00:08:20,132
Try making contact
by underwater telephone.

160
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:21,384
I've already
tried.

161
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:23,886
No response,
sir.

162
00:08:29,525 --> 00:08:31,394
It stopped now.

163
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,147
But sonar still
has a contact.

164
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:36,399
Stay on it.

165
00:08:36,434 --> 00:08:37,650
I'll be
on the bridge.

166
00:08:40,821 --> 00:08:45,041
Steady on course,
0-3-0.

167
00:08:45,076 --> 00:08:47,543
All engines ahead,
one-third,

168
00:08:47,578 --> 00:08:49,412
5-0 rpms for
five knots, sir.

169
00:08:50,046 --> 00:08:52,048
Very well.

170
00:08:57,053 --> 00:08:58,921
We're directly over the object.

171
00:08:58,956 --> 00:09:02,058
All engines stop.

172
00:09:02,093 --> 00:09:03,926
Aye, sir.

173
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:05,177
All engines stop.

174
00:09:06,464 --> 00:09:08,931
All engines stop, sir.

175
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:10,182
Very well.

176
00:09:17,108 --> 00:09:18,324
Do you hear it, sir?

177
00:09:18,359 --> 00:09:19,575
Hold it.

178
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:21,444
I want dead quiet.

179
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:38,461
Ain't that a kick
in the head.

180
00:09:38,496 --> 00:09:39,712
What do you
suppose it is?

181
00:09:39,747 --> 00:09:42,848
Ghosts, man, ghosts.

182
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:47,219
What do you think
it is, chief?

183
00:09:49,105 --> 00:09:52,224
I never heard anything
like that before.

184
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:53,609
Stow it!

185
00:09:53,644 --> 00:09:55,478
Let's keep it quiet
down there.

186
00:10:21,172 --> 00:10:24,256
You okay, now, chief?

187
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,759
Yes.

188
00:10:26,794 --> 00:10:29,895
I'm okay.

189
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:33,015
You blacked out
up on the deck, chief.

190
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:36,519
I'm all right.

191
00:10:36,554 --> 00:10:38,404
Yeah, now, i think
you better lie flat

192
00:10:38,439 --> 00:10:40,272
for a little while.

193
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:45,277
I'll be all right.

194
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,780
Yeah, i wouldn't
doubt it, chief, but...

195
00:10:47,815 --> 00:10:50,916
right now you look like
a class-a shipwreck.

196
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:54,036
We still stopped?

197
00:10:54,071 --> 00:10:55,921
Yeah, we're
still stopped.

198
00:10:55,956 --> 00:10:57,173
We're all curious

199
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:59,041
about what's making
that noise.

200
00:11:01,544 --> 00:11:04,046
What's the trouble,
chief, hmm?

201
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:05,297
Oh, boy.

202
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:07,800
Oh, boy, that's
a funny feeling.

203
00:11:07,835 --> 00:11:09,435
What kind of feeling?

204
00:11:10,686 --> 00:11:13,806
I, uh...

205
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:15,057
i can't describe it.

206
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:29,321
What do you suppose
that is down there?

207
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:34,326
Don't you worry about it,
whatever it is.

208
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:36,212
Just get some rest.

209
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,722
Mr. Smith?

210
00:11:46,757 --> 00:11:48,591
Captain?

211
00:11:48,626 --> 00:11:51,093
I want you to stay grafted
to me, lieutenant.

212
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:52,978
I may have to be
turning in a report

213
00:11:53,013 --> 00:11:54,847
that'll stick me
on a garbage barge.

214
00:11:54,882 --> 00:11:56,098
Or in the navy hospital.

215
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:58,601
I want 15 witnesses
at my hearing

216
00:11:58,636 --> 00:12:00,486
and all on my side.

217
00:12:00,521 --> 00:12:01,737
Could be a sub, sir,

218
00:12:01,772 --> 00:12:02,988
and we could
be hearing it.

219
00:12:03,606 --> 00:12:04,857
It's only about
30 fathoms.

220
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:06,108
Sure, it could be
a sub, mister.

221
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:07,359
That's probably what it is.

222
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:08,611
But what about this sub-

223
00:12:08,646 --> 00:12:09,862
has it got two arms
and a fist?

224
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:12,998
Somebody's making
that noise down that.

225
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:19,371
Lieutenant, do we have
a diver onboard?

226
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:21,874
Yes, sir- mcclure,
first division.

227
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:24,376
Have him report up
here on the double.

228
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:25,628
We'll send him
down there

229
00:12:25,663 --> 00:12:28,130
and have him knock
on the door.

230
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:29,381
And then what, sir?

231
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,267
We'll see who
invites him in!

232
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:42,528
Boatswain's
mate mcclure
reporting, sir.

233
00:12:42,563 --> 00:12:43,779
You're the diver,
right?

234
00:12:43,814 --> 00:12:45,030
Right, sir.

235
00:12:45,065 --> 00:12:46,282
Here's the picture.

236
00:12:46,317 --> 00:12:48,784
We've got something
below us, mcclure.

237
00:12:48,819 --> 00:12:50,035
We don't know
what it is.

238
00:12:50,653 --> 00:12:52,538
It's metal, the
size of a sub hull.

239
00:12:52,573 --> 00:12:54,790
Get your equipment
and go down there.

240
00:12:54,825 --> 00:12:56,041
Stay in touch with us

241
00:12:56,076 --> 00:12:57,293
from the moment
you hit the water

242
00:12:57,328 --> 00:12:57,910
till the moment
you reach it.

243
00:12:58,544 --> 00:12:59,161
Is that understood?

244
00:12:59,196 --> 00:13:00,412
Yes, sir.

245
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:02,298
Whatever the object is,
there's somebody inside,

246
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,166
or at least something
that's making a noise.

247
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,051
When you get down there,

248
00:13:06,086 --> 00:13:07,920
listen to the sound
very closely.

249
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:10,422
We may be getting it
distorted up here.

250
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:12,308
Aye, aye, sir-
i understand.

251
00:13:12,343 --> 00:13:13,559
Hop to it.

252
00:13:13,594 --> 00:13:14,810
Aye, sir.

253
00:13:22,102 --> 00:13:23,936
It's wild.

254
00:13:23,971 --> 00:13:25,821
That it is,
lieutenant.

255
00:13:25,856 --> 00:13:28,324
But if it isn't a sub, sir,
what is it?

256
00:13:28,359 --> 00:13:30,192
Maybe it's a
spanish galleon

257
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:32,077
with a treasure chest

258
00:13:32,112 --> 00:13:34,580
and a loose lid
that's off its hinges.

259
00:13:34,615 --> 00:13:36,448
Or maybe it's...

260
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:38,951
maybe it's just
our imagination.

261
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:49,929
Diver going over
the starboard side.

262
00:14:34,723 --> 00:14:37,226
Bridge.

263
00:14:37,261 --> 00:14:38,477
This is the captain.

264
00:14:38,512 --> 00:14:40,346
I hear you loud and clear.

265
00:14:40,381 --> 00:14:41,597
Keep talking, mcclure.

266
00:14:41,632 --> 00:14:42,848
It's a sub, sir.

267
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:44,733
No question about that.

268
00:14:44,768 --> 00:14:46,602
Have you reached her, mcclure?

269
00:14:46,637 --> 00:14:48,487
I'm standing alongside.

270
00:14:48,522 --> 00:14:51,607
I don't hear anything, though.

271
00:14:59,615 --> 00:15:02,117
Mcclure.

272
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:05,254
Her bow is buried about
15 feet into the bottom.

273
00:15:05,289 --> 00:15:07,756
I can't read any identification.

274
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:09,008
It's covered up.

275
00:15:09,043 --> 00:15:11,510
On the side of
the conning tower.

276
00:15:11,545 --> 00:15:13,379
Can you read a number there?

277
00:15:13,414 --> 00:15:15,881
No, sir, there's
been damage there.

278
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:17,766
The number's been obliterated.

279
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,520
Do you hear that, mcclure?

280
00:15:27,428 --> 00:15:29,895
Yes, sir, i do.

281
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,780
She's coming from amidships.

282
00:15:31,815 --> 00:15:33,649
I'm moving toward there now.

283
00:15:33,684 --> 00:15:36,151
Yes, sir, that's where
it's coming from.

284
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:39,288
Tap on the hull and see
if you get a response.

285
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:50,165
Was that you, mcclure?

286
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,417
Yes, sir.

287
00:15:51,452 --> 00:15:52,668
No response, sir.

288
00:15:52,703 --> 00:15:54,553
I don't hear anything anymore.

289
00:15:54,588 --> 00:15:56,422
There should be three hatches.

290
00:15:56,457 --> 00:15:58,924
One on the bow,
one on the conning tower,

291
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,175
and one on the stern.

292
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:01,427
Is the ship upright?

293
00:16:01,462 --> 00:16:04,563
She's upright, sir,
at about a 30-degree angle.

294
00:16:04,598 --> 00:16:07,683
Climb up on her deck
and check the hatches.

295
00:16:07,718 --> 00:16:08,934
See if you can open them.

296
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:11,437
The mar hatch is buried, sir.

297
00:16:11,472 --> 00:16:13,322
I can't get through to that.

298
00:16:13,357 --> 00:16:16,442
I'll check on the one
over the conning tower.

299
00:16:38,882 --> 00:16:41,350
Mcclure, what's the condition?

300
00:16:41,385 --> 00:16:43,852
The conning tower hatch
is all bent, sir.

301
00:16:43,887 --> 00:16:45,721
I can't move the wheel.

302
00:16:45,756 --> 00:16:49,475
This whole deck appears
to have been scraped.

303
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:50,726
Wait a minute.

304
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:07,993
Hatch on the stern
the same way, sir.

305
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:09,878
I can't turn her.

306
00:17:09,913 --> 00:17:12,998
Whoever she is, sir,
she must've really caught it.

307
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:14,249
Say it again, mcclure.

308
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:15,501
She must've what?

309
00:17:15,536 --> 00:17:16,752
Caught it, sir.

310
00:17:17,386 --> 00:17:20,506
The whole deck is pockmarked
with shell damage-

311
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:22,391
machine gun damage, too.

312
00:17:26,762 --> 00:17:28,013
Was that you, mcclure?

313
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:29,264
No, sir.

314
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:31,767
It's coming
from inside the hull.

315
00:17:31,802 --> 00:17:33,018
Answer right away.

316
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:34,269
Answer right now.

317
00:17:42,196 --> 00:17:43,779
This is wild.

318
00:17:43,814 --> 00:17:45,664
There is
somebody inside.

319
00:17:46,281 --> 00:17:48,167
Can you pinpoint
the sound, mcclure?

320
00:17:48,202 --> 00:17:51,920
Can you tell precisely
where it's coming from?

321
00:17:51,955 --> 00:17:53,172
I think...

322
00:17:53,207 --> 00:17:55,040
i think it's...

323
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:56,925
wait a minute.

324
00:18:00,964 --> 00:18:03,298
Yes, sir.

325
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:04,550
Directly amidships.

326
00:18:04,585 --> 00:18:06,435
Just below the tower.

327
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:07,186
Call sonar.

328
00:18:07,221 --> 00:18:09,054
Try to telephone again.

329
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:12,191
Sonar, bridge.

330
00:18:12,226 --> 00:18:14,693
Try your underwater
telephone again.

331
00:18:14,728 --> 00:18:16,562
Roger.

332
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:22,818
Unknown station,
this is lady. Over.

333
00:18:27,823 --> 00:18:31,577
Unknown station,
this is lady. Over.

334
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:36,582
Bridge, sonar.

335
00:18:36,617 --> 00:18:38,467
No response, sir,
on the phone.

336
00:18:38,967 --> 00:18:40,836
No more contact, sir.

337
00:18:40,871 --> 00:18:42,087
Stay as long as you can

338
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:44,590
and then come up
when you're ready.

339
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:45,841
Aye, aye, sir.

340
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:48,343
Get the com officer-
i want a message.

341
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:50,229

342
00:18:50,264 --> 00:18:51,480
"Info to cinc pac fleet.

343
00:18:51,515 --> 00:18:53,348
Appraise him of situation."

344
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:54,600
Get on it.

345
00:18:57,736 --> 00:18:58,987
Radio, bridge.

346
00:18:59,022 --> 00:19:00,856
Radio, aye.

347
00:19:00,891 --> 00:19:02,107
Captain wants a message.

348
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:04,610
Action to com seventh fleet.

349
00:19:04,645 --> 00:19:06,495
Info cinc pac fleet.

350
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:08,363
Have located sunken sub.

351

Longitude 1-6-0-4-8-0-0 east.

353
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:23,378
Request confirm location of
all known sinkings this area.

354
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:25,881
Will remain this area
until further advised.

355
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:29,017
Precedence,

356
00:19:29,052 --> 00:19:30,886
Radio, aye.

357
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:38,894
Any ideas, captain?

358
00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:40,145
Oh, an even dozen.

359
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,030
Only every one
of them nullifies

360
00:19:42,065 --> 00:19:43,899
the one ahead of it.

361
00:19:43,934 --> 00:19:46,401
If it's one of our subs,
we would have a report.

362
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:48,287
Even if it's
somebody else's,

363
00:19:48,322 --> 00:19:51,406
why haven't they gone out
the torpedo tubes?

364
00:19:51,441 --> 00:19:53,292
There's another
common denominator.

365
00:19:53,327 --> 00:19:55,160
That sub was hit by shellfire.

366
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:57,045
Whatever action took place

367
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,548
must've happened
within a period of hours

368
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:02,050
or no one would
still be alive.

369
00:20:02,085 --> 00:20:03,919
But there's been no action

370
00:20:03,954 --> 00:20:07,055
or we'd have seen it
or heard it.

371
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:10,175
Now, put all that together
and it spells nothing.

372
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:14,563
Mcclure is on his
way back up, sir.

373
00:20:14,598 --> 00:20:16,431
Have him report
to the sonar shack.

374
00:20:17,065 --> 00:20:18,317
That's where i'll be.

375
00:20:18,352 --> 00:20:19,568
Yes, sir.

376
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:51,099
How do you
feel now, chief?

377
00:20:53,637 --> 00:20:56,104
You had
a pretty good sleep.

378
00:20:58,473 --> 00:21:00,976
Um...

379
00:21:01,011 --> 00:21:02,861
what's new from down below?

380
00:21:02,896 --> 00:21:05,981
Nothing much.

381
00:21:06,016 --> 00:21:09,735
Scuttlebutt is were going
to try and take her in tow.

382
00:21:10,986 --> 00:21:12,237
Hey, doc.

383
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:14,740
Yeah, chief.

384
00:21:14,775 --> 00:21:16,625
Um...

385
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:19,745
i was just wondering
about something.

386
00:21:23,131 --> 00:21:25,634
Go ahead, chief.

387
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:28,754
This feeling
of mine, i...

388
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:31,890
what kind of
feeling, chief?

389
00:21:31,925 --> 00:21:35,010
I can't...

390
00:21:35,045 --> 00:21:38,764
i... i get
this feeling...

391
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:41,266
i can't stay
in one place.

392
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:43,769
I got to get up
and go out.

393
00:21:43,804 --> 00:21:46,905
This crazy feeling
that i'm...

394
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:49,408
that you're what,
chief?

395
00:21:49,443 --> 00:21:53,161
That somebody is
ordering me someplace,

396
00:21:53,196 --> 00:21:56,281
is pulling me
someplace.

397
00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:59,418
And if i didn't
stay put,

398
00:21:59,453 --> 00:22:01,920
if i didn't fight it,

399
00:22:01,955 --> 00:22:03,171
i'd go up on deck,

400
00:22:03,206 --> 00:22:05,674
and i'd never
come back.

401
00:22:05,709 --> 00:22:07,542
Huh?

402
00:22:07,577 --> 00:22:10,679
Pretty... sound
pretty nuts?

403
00:22:10,714 --> 00:22:14,433
Don't you worry about
what it sounds like.

404
00:22:14,468 --> 00:22:16,935
Chief, i think
maybe you better

405
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:19,438
stay down here with
me a little while.

406
00:22:19,473 --> 00:22:21,306
Come on, now.

407
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:23,191
Everything's going
to be all right.

408
00:22:23,226 --> 00:22:27,562
Just take it easy
and get a little sleep.

409
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:31,950
There is somebody
inside her, sir.

410
00:22:31,985 --> 00:22:33,201
I'll lay odds on that.

411
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:35,203
What about the sub itself?

412
00:22:35,238 --> 00:22:37,072
Could you judge her length?

413
00:22:37,107 --> 00:22:40,208
Oh, i'd guess her
to be 300 feet, sir,

414
00:22:40,243 --> 00:22:41,460
with a 25-foot beam.

415
00:22:41,495 --> 00:22:43,328
She sounds like one of ours.

416
00:22:43,363 --> 00:22:45,213
She looks like one of ours.

417
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:48,967
There were ballast tanks
and flooding ports

418
00:22:49,002 --> 00:22:50,836
on the underside.

419
00:22:53,338 --> 00:22:54,589
She's moving, sir.

420
00:22:57,010 --> 00:23:00,095
That was the other
thing, captain.

421
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:01,980
She wasn't stuck in tight.

422
00:23:02,015 --> 00:23:03,849
Deep, yes, but not tight.

423
00:23:03,884 --> 00:23:06,985
She seemed to be swaying
when i was down there.

424
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,354
Are you cold, mcclure?

425
00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:11,356
I've been warmer, sir.

426
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:12,607
And you will
be again,

427
00:23:12,642 --> 00:23:14,493
but now you'll
get colder.

428
00:23:14,528 --> 00:23:15,110
Get some coffee,

429
00:23:15,145 --> 00:23:16,361
and go back down.

430
00:23:16,396 --> 00:23:17,612
Check her bow.

431
00:23:17,647 --> 00:23:20,115
She may have
pulled herself loose,

432
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:22,000
and you can read the number.

433
00:23:23,001 --> 00:23:24,870
Sonar, bridge.

434
00:23:26,121 --> 00:23:27,372
Sonar, aye.

435
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:29,758
Radio report
from com seventh fleet

436
00:23:29,793 --> 00:23:31,626
reports no sinkings of any kind.

437
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:33,512
Authorizes us to remain on scene

438
00:23:33,547 --> 00:23:36,631
and operate at own discretion
for salvage and rescue.

439
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:38,517
Roger.

440
00:23:38,552 --> 00:23:41,636
No sinkings?

441
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:45,140
All right.

442
00:23:45,175 --> 00:23:48,894
Mcclure, if you can get me
a number off her hull,

443
00:23:48,929 --> 00:23:51,396
we may be able
to sleep tonight.

444
00:23:51,431 --> 00:23:52,647
Aye, sir.

445
00:23:56,401 --> 00:24:00,155
If they're
in there and alive

446
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:03,291
and can't use
the torpedo tubes,

447
00:24:03,326 --> 00:24:05,160
how do we get them out?

448
00:24:20,809 --> 00:24:23,929
Bridge, this is mcclure.

449
00:24:23,964 --> 00:24:24,563
Go ahead, mcclure.

450
00:24:24,598 --> 00:24:25,814
This is
the captain.

451
00:24:25,849 --> 00:24:28,316
She's pulled herself out, sir.

452
00:24:38,443 --> 00:24:40,445
Here's your number, captain.

453
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,330
7-1-4.

454
00:24:44,199 --> 00:24:46,084
7-1-4?

455
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:47,335
She's one of ours.

456
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:48,587
Come on up here, mcclure,

457
00:24:48,622 --> 00:24:51,089
and get yourself
a broiled steak on me.

458
00:24:51,124 --> 00:24:53,592
Get that book
with the hull numbers.

459
00:25:01,466 --> 00:25:04,603
7-1-4.

460
00:25:04,638 --> 00:25:05,854
7-1...

461
00:25:05,889 --> 00:25:08,974
here it is,
7-1-4.

462
00:25:09,009 --> 00:25:12,727
"Commissioned
december, 1941.

463
00:25:13,361 --> 00:25:15,864
"Sunk in action

464
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:19,618
"first battle
of the solomons,

465
00:25:19,653 --> 00:25:23,371
august 7, 1942."

466
00:25:23,406 --> 00:25:29,244
August 7, 1942.

467
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:32,380
Well, that was 20 years ago.

468
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:36,635
Captain beecham,
who's down there?

469
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:39,137
Who's inside that sub?

470
00:25:39,172 --> 00:25:42,257
Somebody who dies damn hard.

471
00:25:47,729 --> 00:25:51,483
Twilight zonewill continue
after station identification.

472
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:05,914
Who is it?

473
00:26:05,949 --> 00:26:07,165
Uh, chief matthews, sir.

474
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,034
Come on in, doc.

475
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:16,541
Stand easy, chief.
Oh, thank you, captain.

476
00:26:16,576 --> 00:26:17,792
What is it?

477
00:26:17,827 --> 00:26:19,678
Captain, i'd like
to talk to you

478
00:26:19,713 --> 00:26:20,929
about one of the men.

479
00:26:20,964 --> 00:26:22,180
Sure, sit down.

480
00:26:22,215 --> 00:26:23,431
Thank you, sir.

481
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:25,934
Go ahead.

482
00:26:25,969 --> 00:26:28,436
What do you know
about chief bell?

483
00:26:28,471 --> 00:26:29,688
I know his rating

484
00:26:29,723 --> 00:26:30,939
and his service
record.

485
00:26:30,974 --> 00:26:32,807
What else am i
supposed to know?

486
00:26:32,842 --> 00:26:34,059
He's down in sick bay.

487
00:26:34,094 --> 00:26:36,561
I know that-
what's the trouble?

488
00:26:36,596 --> 00:26:39,314
It's an illusion
or a psychosis or whatever.

489
00:26:39,349 --> 00:26:40,565
I don't know.

490
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,068
That's a little out
of my line, captain.

491
00:26:43,103 --> 00:26:46,821
I do know, though, that he
needs help- psychiatric help.

492
00:26:46,856 --> 00:26:50,575
I'm sorry to hear that, doc.

493
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:51,826
Funny.

494
00:26:51,861 --> 00:26:52,961
Captain?

495
00:26:52,996 --> 00:26:54,829
Funny about some men.

496
00:26:54,864 --> 00:26:57,332
Bell, for instance...
21 years navy.

497
00:26:57,367 --> 00:27:00,468
Served in everything
from a scow to a carrier

498
00:27:00,503 --> 00:27:04,222
and all of a sudden he cracks up
like a dinghy in a storm.

499
00:27:05,974 --> 00:27:07,225
I never figured

500
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,728
a man like bell
would crack up.

501
00:27:09,763 --> 00:27:10,979
Would you, doc?

502
00:27:11,014 --> 00:27:12,847
I can't say, captain.

503
00:27:12,882 --> 00:27:15,984
But as for cracking up,
that's what he's doing.

504
00:27:16,019 --> 00:27:18,486
He has a look about
him i can't describe

505
00:27:18,521 --> 00:27:21,606
but it's not a look
you see very often.

506
00:27:21,641 --> 00:27:24,109
Usually it's an hour
after a battle

507
00:27:24,144 --> 00:27:25,994
when the eyes
face outward

508
00:27:26,029 --> 00:27:29,114
but you know they're
really looking inside.

509
00:27:30,365 --> 00:27:32,250
Well, that's what
he looks like-

510
00:27:32,285 --> 00:27:34,753
like a man who's
just been picked up

511
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:38,506
off a raft
full of dead men.

512
00:27:38,541 --> 00:27:41,626
That's what he
looks like, captain.

513
00:27:41,661 --> 00:27:44,129
All right.

514
00:27:44,164 --> 00:27:46,014
Keep him down there.

515
00:27:46,049 --> 00:27:47,882
When we put back
to port,

516
00:27:47,917 --> 00:27:49,768
i'll recommend
hospitalization
for him

517
00:27:50,385 --> 00:27:51,636
and some examinations.

518
00:27:51,671 --> 00:27:53,521
Thanks for
coming in, doc.

519
00:27:53,556 --> 00:27:54,139
Aye, aye, captain.

520
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,401
Quiet, huh?

521
00:28:06,436 --> 00:28:08,286
Yeah. Yeah, it's too quiet.

522
00:28:08,321 --> 00:28:10,155
How long has it been now?

523
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:12,657
About three hours.

524
00:28:12,692 --> 00:28:15,160
Is he going to send mcclure
down there again?

525
00:28:15,195 --> 00:28:16,411
Beats me.

526
00:28:16,446 --> 00:28:18,296
All i know is, there's
a boiler tender second

527
00:28:18,331 --> 00:28:19,547
who's making book in
the crew's quarters

528
00:28:19,582 --> 00:28:20,799
that that thing below us

529
00:28:20,834 --> 00:28:23,301
is a sea monster
with three heads,

530
00:28:23,336 --> 00:28:25,170
and we're all living
on borrowed time.

531
00:28:28,306 --> 00:28:30,175
Captain.

532
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:34,562
I don't know what
scares me more:

533
00:28:34,597 --> 00:28:37,065
When they pound
or when they shut up.

534
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,316
I don't know what
scaresmemore:

535
00:28:38,933 --> 00:28:40,819
A 20-year-old sub
with somebody alive inside

536
00:28:40,854 --> 00:28:43,321
or what the commander
of the pacific fleet

537
00:28:43,356 --> 00:28:45,824
will say when i tell him
there's a 20-year-old sub

538
00:28:45,859 --> 00:28:47,692
with somebody alive inside.

539
00:28:47,727 --> 00:28:48,943
Coffee, captain?

540
00:28:48,978 --> 00:28:50,195
Please.

541
00:28:53,331 --> 00:28:55,834
Furthermore,
i've got a chief
boatswain's mate

542
00:28:55,869 --> 00:28:58,336
who has something
eating at him.

543
00:28:58,371 --> 00:28:59,587
Bell?

544
00:28:59,622 --> 00:29:01,456
Mm-hmm, bell.

545
00:29:01,491 --> 00:29:02,707
What made him
black out?

546
00:29:02,742 --> 00:29:05,210
Well, that's part
of the problem.

547
00:29:05,245 --> 00:29:07,095
Could be he's
dredging up

548
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:08,346
a couple of
memories.

549
00:29:08,381 --> 00:29:10,215
What do you mean,
memories?

550
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:15,220
Well, this is world war ii
revisited for him.

551
00:29:15,255 --> 00:29:17,722
He was picked up here
after a sinking.

552
00:29:17,757 --> 00:29:20,225
A sinking?

553
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,476
Sit down, marmer.

554
00:29:22,727 --> 00:29:24,612
That's the way i hear it.

555
00:29:24,647 --> 00:29:27,732
He was on a ship that was hit-
the only survivor.

556
00:29:27,767 --> 00:29:30,235
They pulled him out
of the water.

557
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:32,120
He had a pretty rough time.

558
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:35,240
Maybe he is
dredging up memories.

559
00:29:40,914 --> 00:29:42,630
Here we go again.

560
00:29:42,665 --> 00:29:45,133
I'll be in the sonar shack.

561
00:29:51,639 --> 00:29:54,142
Still coming from
down below, captain?

562
00:29:54,177 --> 00:29:55,393
Yeah.

563
00:29:55,428 --> 00:29:57,262
How's the patient?

564
00:29:57,297 --> 00:29:58,513
Well, he's asleep.

565
00:29:58,548 --> 00:30:01,015
I'm just going to
get some coffee.

566
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:02,901
Well, you keep me
posted, will you?

567
00:30:03,518 --> 00:30:05,403
Aye, aye, sir.

568
00:30:41,806 --> 00:30:45,310
What's the matter,
chief, what happened?

569
00:30:45,345 --> 00:30:46,561
I was looking
in the mirror,

570
00:30:46,596 --> 00:30:47,812
and i saw
faces that...

571
00:30:47,847 --> 00:30:49,063
they were
staring at me.

572
00:30:49,098 --> 00:30:50,315
They were
pointing at me.

573
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:52,200
Now, i know
this sounds crazy,

574
00:30:52,235 --> 00:30:53,451
but they were there.

575
00:30:53,486 --> 00:30:56,571
It was as if they
were ordering me

576
00:30:56,606 --> 00:31:00,325
into the mirror,
pulling me in...

577
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,210
doc?

578
00:31:02,245 --> 00:31:05,330
You, uh, see me
in the mirror?

579
00:31:05,365 --> 00:31:06,581
Huh?

580
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:09,717
Yeah, i see you.

581
00:31:09,752 --> 00:31:12,220
Now, i see you
just fine, chief.

582
00:31:12,255 --> 00:31:14,088
Now, you remember
that, huh?

583
00:31:14,123 --> 00:31:15,974
I see you fine.

584
00:31:16,009 --> 00:31:18,476
Now, nobody is ordering
you anywhere,

585
00:31:18,511 --> 00:31:20,979
and you're not
going anyplace.

586
00:31:21,014 --> 00:31:24,098
We're going to whip this,
i promise you.

587
00:31:24,133 --> 00:31:25,984
We're going
to whip this!

588
00:31:35,493 --> 00:31:37,362
It's some equipment down there.

589
00:31:37,397 --> 00:31:40,498
Something loose that's
swinging back and forth,

590
00:31:40,533 --> 00:31:41,749
hitting the bulkhead.

591
00:31:41,784 --> 00:31:43,618
It's possible.

592
00:31:43,653 --> 00:31:45,503
It's the only
explanation.

593
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:49,874
A 20-year-old sub in
the deep six since the war?

594
00:31:51,794 --> 00:31:54,262
Well, whoever it is,
whatever it is,

595
00:31:54,297 --> 00:31:55,513
it's losing steam.

596
00:31:55,548 --> 00:31:57,382
I wouldn't
make book on this,

597
00:31:57,417 --> 00:31:59,884
but i've got a hunch
that if we don't get inside,

598
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:03,021
and i mean quick,
we're going to miss the boat.

599
00:32:03,056 --> 00:32:04,889
So we go down again.

600
00:32:04,924 --> 00:32:08,026
Like you told the o.d.,
we knock on the door.

601
00:32:08,061 --> 00:32:10,528
We don't knock on
the door this time.

602
00:32:10,563 --> 00:32:12,397
Now we kick
the door open!

603
00:32:14,899 --> 00:32:16,150
If you break
in that way,

604
00:32:16,185 --> 00:32:18,036
it's a sure bet
the pressure

605
00:32:18,071 --> 00:32:20,538
will kill whatever's
alive down there.

606
00:32:20,573 --> 00:32:23,658
Then we do it
the one other way we've got.

607
00:32:23,693 --> 00:32:25,543
Send a message to com sub pac.

608
00:32:25,578 --> 00:32:28,046
Tell them we're
going to need

609
00:32:28,081 --> 00:32:29,297
a sub rescue
ship here.

610
00:32:29,332 --> 00:32:33,051
Tell them to report to scene
for rescue attempt.

611
00:32:33,086 --> 00:32:34,302
Airlock chamber, huh?

612
00:32:34,337 --> 00:32:36,170
That's all
we've got left.

613
00:32:36,205 --> 00:32:38,673
Get on it right
away, will you?

614
00:32:38,708 --> 00:32:39,924
I'll be
on the bridge.

615
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:43,678
Radio, sonar.

616
00:32:44,312 --> 00:32:46,180
To com sub pac,
emergency precedence.

617
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:08,586
Where are you
going, chief?

618
00:33:08,621 --> 00:33:10,455
Doc, who's outside?

619
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:11,706
What?

620
00:33:12,957 --> 00:33:15,460
Who's outside
in the passageway?

621
00:33:15,495 --> 00:33:17,345
There's nobody
out there

622
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:18,596
who shouldn't be.

623
00:33:18,631 --> 00:33:20,465
Let me tell you
something, chief.

624
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:23,601
You can talk yourself into
any kind of nightmare you want.

625
00:33:23,636 --> 00:33:26,104
You just have to let
the gates down a bit,

626
00:33:26,139 --> 00:33:27,355
and that stuff seeps in.

627
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:29,857
Only there's nobody blowing
it from the other side.

628
00:33:29,892 --> 00:33:31,726
It's you, yourself.

629
00:33:31,761 --> 00:33:33,611
Now, there's nobody out there.

630
00:33:33,646 --> 00:33:36,731
Nobody at all.

631
00:33:36,766 --> 00:33:39,233
Now, who did you think
was out there?

632
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:45,490
I don't know.

633
00:33:58,503 --> 00:33:59,754
You're wound up
tight, chief,

634
00:33:59,789 --> 00:34:01,639
and i think you're doing
most of this to yourself,

635
00:34:01,674 --> 00:34:03,508
because there's nothing out
there on that passageway

636
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:05,393
except a long stretch
of deck and steel.

637
00:34:05,428 --> 00:34:07,261
Nothing else.

638
00:34:09,182 --> 00:34:11,649
You want to
take a look?

639
00:34:11,684 --> 00:34:14,152
Doc, what's
happening to me?

640
00:34:14,187 --> 00:34:17,271
Doc, no, please tell me
what's happening to me.

641
00:34:17,306 --> 00:34:19,157
You've got to grab
hold of yourself.

642
00:34:19,192 --> 00:34:21,025
You're going
to talk yourself

643
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,276
into a straightjacket.

644
00:34:22,311 --> 00:34:24,779
You're going to build
so many nightmares

645
00:34:24,814 --> 00:34:26,664
into that brain
of yours...

646
00:34:29,784 --> 00:34:31,035
the same feeling?

647
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:34,172
It's the same thing.

648
00:34:34,207 --> 00:34:36,674
It's just as if
somebody out there

649
00:34:36,709 --> 00:34:37,925
was waiting for me.

650
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:41,045
Just as if something out
there's pulling me.

651
00:34:44,217 --> 00:34:46,050
Hey, doc?

652
00:34:46,085 --> 00:34:47,301
What, chief?

653
00:34:47,336 --> 00:34:49,804
Doc, i'm scared
to open the door.

654
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:51,055
Well, then don't.

655
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:53,558
I told you
there's nobody out there.

656
00:34:53,593 --> 00:34:57,311
Doc, i'm scared to open
this door, but i got to.

657
00:35:40,855 --> 00:35:45,243
Oh, my dear god
in heaven.

658
00:35:45,278 --> 00:35:47,745
Did you see them, doc?

659
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:50,248
Did you see them?

660
00:35:50,283 --> 00:35:52,116
Men...

661
00:35:52,151 --> 00:35:54,001
men looking at me.

662
00:35:54,036 --> 00:35:55,253
They were... they were wet,

663
00:35:55,288 --> 00:35:59,006
they were dripping wet,
and they were not alive!

664
00:35:59,041 --> 00:36:02,126
No, i didn't see
anything, chief.

665
00:36:02,161 --> 00:36:04,629
Neither did you.

666
00:36:04,664 --> 00:36:05,880
Now, did you hear me?

667
00:36:05,915 --> 00:36:07,131
You didn't see a thing.

668
00:36:07,166 --> 00:36:09,016
Not a bloody
worshipping thing.

669
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:12,770
All you saw was what your
scare-brain told you to see.

670
00:36:12,805 --> 00:36:14,639
That's all that it was.

671
00:36:14,674 --> 00:36:17,141
What you talked yourself
into wanting to see!

672
00:36:46,053 --> 00:36:47,922
Seaweed.

673
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:02,904
That about does it,
mcclure.

674
00:37:02,939 --> 00:37:06,023
Go down, and see
if you can get another response.

675
00:37:06,058 --> 00:37:08,526
It'll be a great help
to the sub rescue outfit

676
00:37:08,561 --> 00:37:10,411
if you can confirm
a specific location.

677
00:37:10,446 --> 00:37:11,662
How will they
get in, sir?

678
00:37:11,697 --> 00:37:14,165
Through the forward torpedo
compartment of the stern.

679
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,416
They'll have to blow

680
00:37:16,033 --> 00:37:17,919
each of the six other
compartments between them

681
00:37:18,536 --> 00:37:19,787
before they can enter
any part.

682
00:37:19,822 --> 00:37:21,672
Well, what if i
don't get an answer?

683
00:37:21,707 --> 00:37:24,792
We haven't heard from them
in almost a half hour.

684
00:37:24,827 --> 00:37:26,677
If you can't get an answer,
come on back up.

685
00:37:26,712 --> 00:37:28,546
The a.s.r. Team
will pick it up from here.

686
00:37:29,797 --> 00:37:32,300
No survivors then, sir-

687
00:37:32,335 --> 00:37:33,551
is that what it'll mean?

688
00:37:33,586 --> 00:37:36,053
That's what it'll mean-
no survivors.

689
00:37:36,088 --> 00:37:38,556
Okay, mcclure,
hop to it.

690
00:37:38,591 --> 00:37:40,441
Aye, sir.

691
00:37:47,315 --> 00:37:49,450
I've reached the sub, sir.

692
00:37:49,485 --> 00:37:51,953
The next noise you hear,
that'll be me.

693
00:37:51,988 --> 00:37:53,204
Go ahead, pound away.

694
00:38:01,712 --> 00:38:05,716
What about it, mcclure,
any response?

695
00:38:05,751 --> 00:38:06,968
No response, sir.

696
00:38:07,003 --> 00:38:08,836
No response anywhere.

697
00:38:08,871 --> 00:38:10,721
Keep trying a few minutes.

698
00:38:10,756 --> 00:38:11,339
Yes, sir.

699
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:23,100
Mcclure?

700
00:38:23,135 --> 00:38:24,352
I've found something.

701
00:38:24,387 --> 00:38:25,603
Wait a minute.

702
00:38:27,989 --> 00:38:29,857
It's a pair of dog tags.

703
00:38:29,892 --> 00:38:31,742
What about response, mcclure?

704
00:38:31,777 --> 00:38:33,611
Can you hear anything?

705
00:38:33,646 --> 00:38:35,496
No, sir, i don't hear a thing.

706
00:38:35,531 --> 00:38:37,999
Well, give them
a few more minutes,

707
00:38:38,034 --> 00:38:39,867
and then come on back up.

708
00:38:39,902 --> 00:38:40,501
Yes, sir.

709
00:38:43,004 --> 00:38:44,255
No soap, i guess.

710
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:45,506
No soap.

711
00:38:45,541 --> 00:38:48,009
That frosts,
that really frosts.

712
00:38:48,044 --> 00:38:51,762
To get so close to those
poor devils and then...

713
00:38:51,797 --> 00:38:55,516
that sub rescue ship
is due here about 0300.

714
00:38:55,551 --> 00:38:56,767
Keep your eye peeled.

715
00:38:56,802 --> 00:38:58,636
I'm going aft.

716
00:38:58,671 --> 00:39:00,521
Aye, sir.

717
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:04,275
This is what
i found, sir.

718
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:05,526
Thanks, mcclure,
good job.

719
00:39:05,561 --> 00:39:07,395
Go get yourself
some coffee.

720
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:09,897
But i will need you
one more time.

721
00:39:09,932 --> 00:39:11,148
When the a.s.r.
Team gets here,

722
00:39:11,183 --> 00:39:13,651
you'll have to go
down with them as pathfinder,

723
00:39:13,686 --> 00:39:14,902
give them
all the help they need.

724
00:39:14,937 --> 00:39:18,155
Excuse me, sir, but...

725
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:20,658
well, you better look
at those tags.

726
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:31,802
They're yours,
aren't they?

727
00:39:31,837 --> 00:39:33,054
Mcclure found them

728
00:39:33,089 --> 00:39:35,556
on the deck of
the sub down there.

729
00:39:38,059 --> 00:39:40,561
When did you
lose them, boats?

730
00:39:45,566 --> 00:39:48,686
That was a...

731
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,188
long time ago, sir.

732
00:39:51,223 --> 00:39:53,074
When?

733
00:39:53,109 --> 00:39:56,193
Um...

734
00:39:56,228 --> 00:39:59,330
oh, uh...

735
00:39:59,365 --> 00:40:02,450
20... 20 years
ago, sir.

736
00:40:02,485 --> 00:40:03,701
20 years ago.

737
00:40:06,203 --> 00:40:08,089
Sit down, boats.

738
00:40:14,962 --> 00:40:17,465
Go ahead, sit down.

739
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:26,223
Go on.

740
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,228
I was, uh...

741
00:40:34,365 --> 00:40:36,233
...aboard ship, sir.

742
00:40:36,268 --> 00:40:37,485
What ship?

743
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:42,239
Submarine.

744
00:40:42,274 --> 00:40:47,878
Sir, that... that one
down below us, that...

745
00:40:47,913 --> 00:40:50,998
that was my boat.

746
00:40:51,499 --> 00:40:54,001
What's making the noise
down there, boats?

747
00:40:54,036 --> 00:40:55,886
Do you know?

748
00:40:55,921 --> 00:40:59,006
What's it
all about?

749
00:40:59,041 --> 00:41:00,891
We were on the surface.

750
00:41:00,926 --> 00:41:04,645
It... it was night.

751
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,514
I was, uh...

752
00:41:06,549 --> 00:41:09,650
i was a signalman then.

753
00:41:09,685 --> 00:41:18,409
I was supposed to put
an infrared filter on the, uh...

754
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:22,780
...on the, uh, signal light,

755
00:41:22,815 --> 00:41:27,168
otherwise, the japs
would have seen us.

756
00:41:27,203 --> 00:41:28,419
They would have seen the light.

757
00:41:28,454 --> 00:41:29,670
They would have found us.

758
00:41:29,705 --> 00:41:31,539
I understand.

759
00:41:31,574 --> 00:41:32,790
I don't know...

760
00:41:32,825 --> 00:41:34,675
i don't know
what happened.

761
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:35,926
I, uh...

762
00:41:35,961 --> 00:41:41,549
l-i dropped
the, uh, signal light.

763
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:47,188
The infrared filter fell off.

764
00:41:50,307 --> 00:41:54,695
They were waiting for us out
there, the jap destroyers.

765
00:41:56,564 --> 00:41:58,449
They saw
our light.

766
00:41:58,484 --> 00:42:01,569
They let us have it.

767
00:42:03,454 --> 00:42:08,459
They straddled us
with their first salvo.

768
00:42:08,494 --> 00:42:14,715
The, uh, captain took the sub
down, but it was too late.

769
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:17,835
They unloaded depth charges.

770
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:24,091
That sub wasn't ever going to be
able to come up again.

771
00:42:24,126 --> 00:42:27,228
What about you, boats?

772
00:42:27,263 --> 00:42:32,850
I got flung over the side
when that first salvo hit.

773
00:42:32,885 --> 00:42:33,984
Mm-hmm.

774
00:42:34,602 --> 00:42:37,104
And, uh...

775
00:42:37,139 --> 00:42:39,607
all the time i...

776
00:42:40,858 --> 00:42:42,743
...i was in
the water there,

777
00:42:42,778 --> 00:42:44,612
i could,
i could...

778
00:42:44,647 --> 00:42:46,497
you could what?

779
00:42:46,532 --> 00:42:48,999
I could, uh...

780
00:42:49,034 --> 00:42:51,502
i could
hear the, uh...

781
00:42:55,256 --> 00:42:59,009
i could
hear the, um...

782
00:42:59,044 --> 00:43:01,512
i could hear the
voices of our guys.

783
00:43:01,547 --> 00:43:03,380
They were, uh...

784
00:43:06,517 --> 00:43:08,385
they were screaming!

785
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:09,637
All right, boats!

786
00:43:09,672 --> 00:43:10,888
Boats, sit down!

787
00:43:10,923 --> 00:43:12,773
All right,
all right now.

788
00:43:12,808 --> 00:43:15,893
I know what it was.

789
00:43:15,928 --> 00:43:17,778
This thing has
been bugging me.

790
00:43:17,813 --> 00:43:19,647
I know,
i know what it is.

791
00:43:19,682 --> 00:43:20,898
All right,
what is it?

792
00:43:22,149 --> 00:43:24,034
I got out, see?

793
00:43:24,069 --> 00:43:27,788
One guy in our whole
crew- i got out.

794
00:43:27,823 --> 00:43:32,159
Oh, i got picked up later
by one of our destroyers.

795
00:43:32,194 --> 00:43:34,044
I got out.

796
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:36,547
You understand
that, captain?

797
00:43:36,582 --> 00:43:40,918
I... i sunk
that sub, right?

798
00:43:40,953 --> 00:43:42,803
I was responsible.

799
00:43:42,838 --> 00:43:43,420
Yes.

800
00:43:44,054 --> 00:43:44,672
I got out.

801
00:43:44,707 --> 00:43:46,557
I want you to
listen to me now.

802
00:43:46,592 --> 00:43:48,425
Yeah, that's what this
thing... this thing...

803
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:50,311
see, them guys...

804
00:43:50,346 --> 00:43:55,316
them guys down
there in that sub,

805
00:43:55,351 --> 00:43:57,184
they know i'm up here.

806
00:43:57,219 --> 00:43:58,435
Bell, i want you
to hear me out now.

807
00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:01,572
Yeah, that's what this
thing has been, see?

808
00:44:01,607 --> 00:44:04,692
I should be down
there with them.

809
00:44:04,727 --> 00:44:05,943
Now, bell...

810
00:44:05,978 --> 00:44:09,079
i should be
down in that sub.

811
00:44:09,114 --> 00:44:10,948
I should be dead.

812
00:44:10,983 --> 00:44:12,199
Bell!

813
00:44:12,234 --> 00:44:14,084
See? And all this
noise, see-

814
00:44:14,119 --> 00:44:16,587
this pounding,
this clanging-

815
00:44:16,622 --> 00:44:18,455
that's them guys
down there.

816
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:20,958
They're calling
muster on me.

817
00:44:20,993 --> 00:44:22,209
Bell, i want you
to hear me out now.

818
00:44:22,244 --> 00:44:24,094
Bell, bell, i want you
to hear me out!

819
00:44:24,129 --> 00:44:25,963
Bell!
Captain, shh! Shh!

820
00:44:25,998 --> 00:44:27,848
Bell, i want you to quiet
down and hear me out

821
00:44:27,883 --> 00:44:30,351
and listen to a little logic
now and a little reason.

822
00:44:30,386 --> 00:44:30,968
Bell, listen to me!

823
00:44:31,003 --> 00:44:32,219
Now you listen to me.

824
00:44:32,254 --> 00:44:33,470
They're calling
muster on me.

825
00:44:33,505 --> 00:44:34,722
Bell, listen to me!

826
00:44:34,757 --> 00:44:37,224
Just listen to a little
logic, a little reason!

827
00:44:37,259 --> 00:44:39,109
One man
does not sink a sub,

828
00:44:39,144 --> 00:44:42,229
and one lousy circumstance
does not decide a battle,

829
00:44:42,264 --> 00:44:44,732
and one case
of sudden fear

830
00:44:44,767 --> 00:44:48,485
does not add up
to a coward.

831
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:51,488
You've been taking
a dirty rap for 20 years.

832
00:44:51,523 --> 00:44:53,374
You've slept with it,
you've hung it around your neck,

833
00:44:53,409 --> 00:44:55,242
you've let it dig deep down
inside and tear you to pieces.

834
00:44:55,876 --> 00:44:57,127
Let me tell you something, bell.

835
00:44:57,162 --> 00:44:58,996
It's not deserved,
it's not right.

836
00:44:59,031 --> 00:45:00,247
It's a dead weight guilt

837
00:45:00,282 --> 00:45:02,132
that you've blown way out
of proportion to the facts.

838
00:45:02,167 --> 00:45:03,384
And do you know
what the facts are, bell?

839
00:45:03,419 --> 00:45:05,252
The facts are that that sub
was dead in the water

840
00:45:05,886 --> 00:45:07,137
and surrounded by enemy craft.

841
00:45:07,172 --> 00:45:10,257
That was a crew that was doomed,
do you understand that?

842
00:45:10,292 --> 00:45:11,508
A frightened
sailor

843
00:45:12,142 --> 00:45:13,394
didn't destroy
that ship

844
00:45:13,429 --> 00:45:15,262
or kill off
that crew.

845
00:45:15,297 --> 00:45:16,513
Bell!

846
00:45:16,548 --> 00:45:18,399
You've got
to understand.

847
00:45:18,434 --> 00:45:20,267
A war did!

848
00:45:20,302 --> 00:45:22,152
A set
of circumstances did!

849
00:45:22,187 --> 00:45:25,155
Now, bell,
you've got to believe me.

850
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:28,909
All you should put in your
seabag is a regret, not a guilt.

851
00:45:28,944 --> 00:45:31,161
Do you understand,
bell?

852
00:45:31,196 --> 00:45:33,664
Not a guilt!

853
00:45:46,677 --> 00:45:49,179
By your leave, sir.

854
00:45:49,214 --> 00:45:51,682
They're calling
muster on me.

855
00:45:51,717 --> 00:45:53,550
Bell!

856
00:46:00,691 --> 00:46:03,560
They're calling muster on me!

857
00:46:08,949 --> 00:46:12,069
They're calling muster on me!

858
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:25,833
Man overboard,
starboard side!

859
00:46:25,868 --> 00:46:28,335
Man overboard,
starboard side.

860
00:46:28,969 --> 00:46:31,972
Pass the word,
man overboard, starboard side.

861
00:47:03,370 --> 00:47:04,621
We've been searching
for ten hours, sir.

862
00:47:04,656 --> 00:47:05,873
It's no use.

863
00:47:05,908 --> 00:47:08,375
We can't find
the body.

864
00:47:15,883 --> 00:47:19,636
The rescue team ought to
be in that sub by now.

865
00:47:19,671 --> 00:47:22,139
Yeah.

866
00:47:51,168 --> 00:47:53,670
You got in.

867
00:47:53,705 --> 00:47:56,173
Yes, sir.

868
00:47:56,208 --> 00:47:58,675
It was a wreck
inside, sir.

869
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:00,561
Nobody had a chance.

870
00:48:00,596 --> 00:48:02,429
Nobody?

871
00:48:02,464 --> 00:48:05,566
Nobody, sir.

872
00:48:07,434 --> 00:48:10,571
The periscope shears
had been cut in half,

873
00:48:11,188 --> 00:48:12,439
and one whole section

874
00:48:12,474 --> 00:48:16,193
was just hanging there
swinging back and forth.

875
00:48:16,228 --> 00:48:19,329
That was making the noise then.

876
00:48:21,832 --> 00:48:24,952
Thatwasmaking the noise,
wasn't it?

877
00:48:24,987 --> 00:48:28,705
I guess so, sir.

878
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:30,591
But...

879
00:48:30,626 --> 00:48:31,842
but what?

880
00:48:32,459 --> 00:48:36,847
There were eight men
in the control room.

881
00:48:36,882 --> 00:48:41,852
Eight men, or what
was left of them, and...

882
00:48:41,887 --> 00:48:44,972
one of them...

883
00:48:45,007 --> 00:48:47,474
one of them
had a hammer in his hand.

884
00:48:54,982 --> 00:48:56,867
Mcclure...

885
00:48:56,902 --> 00:48:59,987
let's just say that
that's part of the story

886
00:49:00,022 --> 00:49:04,374
you tell your grandchildren,
that you make up yourself.

887
00:49:04,409 --> 00:49:06,243
Tell them anything you like.

888
00:49:08,745 --> 00:49:09,997
Aye, sir.

889
00:49:18,138 --> 00:49:21,258
Funny thing, how long it
takes some men to die

890
00:49:21,293 --> 00:49:23,760
or to find any
peace at all.

891
00:49:23,795 --> 00:49:29,766
Sometimes i think that's the
worst thing there is about war-

892
00:49:29,801 --> 00:49:33,520
not just what it does
to the bodies...

893
00:49:33,555 --> 00:49:36,023
but what it does to the minds.

894
00:49:52,539 --> 00:49:56,543
So rest in peace, chief bell.

895
00:49:56,578 --> 00:49:58,428
I think it's your due now.

896
00:49:58,463 --> 00:50:04,051
Small naval engagement,
the month of april, 1963.

897
00:50:04,086 --> 00:50:07,804
Not to be found
in any historical annals.

898
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:12,192
Look for this one filed
under "h" for "haunting"

899
00:50:12,227 --> 00:50:14,061
in the twilight zone.

900
00:50:21,068 --> 00:50:22,953
Next ontwilight zone,

901
00:50:22,988 --> 00:50:26,073
a marvelously exciting excursion
into a very strange place

902
00:50:26,108 --> 00:50:28,575
called "valley of the shadow."

903
00:50:28,610 --> 00:50:30,961
It comes from the probing mind
of mr. Charles beaumont,

904
00:50:30,996 --> 00:50:33,330
and whether
you're a science fiction buff,

905
00:50:33,365 --> 00:50:36,466
a fantasy lover
or just needful of some escape,

906
00:50:36,501 --> 00:50:38,335
this one should fill
most of your requirements.

907
00:50:44,725 --> 00:50:46,593
I thought you told me

908
00:50:46,628 --> 00:50:47,844
my car was going
to be repaired.

909
00:50:47,879 --> 00:50:49,730
Please sit down.

910
00:50:49,765 --> 00:50:50,981
I don't want
to sit down.

911
00:50:51,016 --> 00:50:52,849
I want to know why
nothing's been done
to my car.

912
00:50:52,884 --> 00:50:54,101
Why it's just
sitting out there.

913
00:50:54,136 --> 00:50:57,604
Primarily because
you won't be needing it anymore.

914
00:50:57,639 --> 00:50:59,489
Oh, no? Well, why?

915
00:51:00,107 --> 00:51:03,243
Because you are never going
to leave peaceful valley.

916
00:51:03,278 --> 00:51:03,994
Wait a minute.

917
00:51:04,029 --> 00:51:06,496
Yeah, i think i got
this thing figured out.

918
00:51:06,531 --> 00:51:07,748
Oh?
Well, sure.

919
00:51:07,783 --> 00:51:09,616
Peaceful valley
is a town full of lunatics,

920
00:51:09,651 --> 00:51:10,867
and you guys
head the list.

921
00:51:11,501 --> 00:51:12,753
Now what do you mean
i'm not ever

922
00:51:12,788 --> 00:51:14,621
going to be able
to leave here?

923
00:51:14,656 --> 00:51:17,007
'Cause, mr. Redfield,
you stumbled upon

924
00:51:17,042 --> 00:51:20,127
the best kept secret
in the world.
