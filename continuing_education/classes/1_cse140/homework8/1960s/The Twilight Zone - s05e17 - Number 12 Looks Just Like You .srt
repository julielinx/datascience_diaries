1
00:00:07,724 --> 00:00:11,478
You unlock this door
with the key of imagination.

2
00:00:11,513 --> 00:00:13,480
Beyond it is another dimension-

3
00:00:13,515 --> 00:00:14,731
a dimension of sound,

4
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:17,734
a dimension of sight,

5
00:00:17,769 --> 00:00:19,986
a dimension of mind.

6
00:00:20,021 --> 00:00:22,989
You're moving into a land
of both shadow and substance,

7
00:00:23,024 --> 00:00:24,491
of things and ideas.

8
00:00:24,526 --> 00:00:28,244
You've just crossed over
into the twilight zone.

9
00:00:39,756 --> 00:00:42,258
I can't decide...

10
00:00:42,293 --> 00:00:46,012
eight or 12.

11
00:00:46,047 --> 00:00:47,897
I think 12 might
suit you better.

12
00:00:47,932 --> 00:00:49,899
What do you think, marilyn?

13
00:00:49,934 --> 00:00:51,151
Hmm?

14
00:00:51,186 --> 00:00:54,404
You weren't
even listening.

15
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:56,406
I'm sorry, mother.

16
00:00:56,441 --> 00:00:58,408
I don't understand you, darling.

17
00:00:58,443 --> 00:01:01,911
Most girls are thrilled when
it's time to pick a pattern.

18
00:01:01,946 --> 00:01:03,163
You haven't
even looked

19
00:01:03,413 --> 00:01:05,415
at the ones the
bureau sent over.

20
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:06,666
Oh, i looked at them.

21
00:01:09,419 --> 00:01:12,672
I remember how excited
i was before i was done.

22
00:01:12,922 --> 00:01:14,924
I couldn't sleep for nights.

23
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:23,933
I finally chose number 12.

24
00:01:27,437 --> 00:01:29,189
I guess that's
everybody's favorite.

25
00:01:29,224 --> 00:01:32,192
Aren't
you excited?

26
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:36,696
Marilyn, what are
you looking at, dear?

27
00:01:36,731 --> 00:01:39,199
You, a picture
of you before.

28
00:01:39,234 --> 00:01:41,201
Oh, dear.

29
00:01:41,236 --> 00:01:42,952
It is you,
isn't it?

30
00:01:42,987 --> 00:01:46,206
Yes, that's me before
my transformation.

31
00:01:46,241 --> 00:01:48,575
I was a sight,
wasn't i?

32
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:50,577
Mother, i think
you were beautiful.

33
00:01:50,612 --> 00:01:52,579
Well, i certainly don't.

34
00:01:52,614 --> 00:01:55,331
Am i very homely now?

35
00:01:55,366 --> 00:01:58,084
No, darling, not to me.

36
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:02,589
But afterwards,
you'll be beautiful.

37
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:05,592
Mother, if i didn't want
the transformation,

38
00:02:05,627 --> 00:02:08,094
i wouldn't have
to have it, would i?

39
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:10,096
What are you talking about?

40
00:02:10,346 --> 00:02:13,099
The transformation is
the most marvelous thing

41
00:02:13,134 --> 00:02:15,101
that could happen to a person.

42
00:02:15,136 --> 00:02:18,104
Well, i could wait
a little while, couldn't i?

43
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:21,107
Don't worry, darling,
you're just nervous.

44
00:02:21,142 --> 00:02:24,861
What you need is a
glass of instant smile.

45
00:02:31,868 --> 00:02:34,871
Just think,
very soon now

46
00:02:34,906 --> 00:02:37,373
you can look
like that.

47
00:02:37,408 --> 00:02:39,876
Won't that
be wonderful?

48
00:02:45,014 --> 00:02:46,516
You rang, mrs. Cuberle?

49
00:02:46,551 --> 00:02:48,017
Lana.

50
00:02:48,052 --> 00:02:50,520
Pardon me... lana.

51
00:02:50,555 --> 00:02:54,274
I don't know why teaching
you people to use first names

52
00:02:54,309 --> 00:02:55,525
is such a problem.

53
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,778
A glass of instant smile
for marilyn, please, grace.

54
00:02:59,028 --> 00:03:01,030
On second thought,
make it two.

55
00:03:01,065 --> 00:03:02,282
Yes, ma'am.

56
00:03:04,033 --> 00:03:05,535
Lana.

57
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:14,794
What's so terrible
about being beautiful?

58
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:20,049
After all,
isn't everybody?

59
00:03:20,084 --> 00:03:23,803
Given the chance,
what young girl

60
00:03:23,838 --> 00:03:26,673
wouldn't happily exchange
a plain face for a lovely one?

61
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:29,559
What girl could refuse
the opportunity to be beautiful?

62
00:03:29,594 --> 00:03:33,062
For want of a better estimate,
let's call it the year 2000.

63
00:03:33,097 --> 00:03:34,814
At any rate,
imagine a time in the future

64
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:37,317
when science has developed
the means of giving everyone

65
00:03:37,352 --> 00:03:39,569
the face and body he dreams of.

66
00:03:39,604 --> 00:03:41,070
It may not happen tomorrow,

67
00:03:41,105 --> 00:03:45,325
but it happens now,
in the twilight zone.

68
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:07,880
Who is it?

69
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:09,132
Hi, uncle rick.

70
00:04:09,167 --> 00:04:11,634
Take it easy with
that uncle rick stuff.

71
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:13,886
Are you trying to
make me feel old?

72
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:15,138
I'm sorry, i forgot.

73
00:04:15,173 --> 00:04:17,140
Now, young lady,

74
00:04:17,175 --> 00:04:20,393
what's all this i've
been hearing about you?

75
00:04:20,643 --> 00:04:23,896
You know, honey, your
mother is very worried.

76
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:26,149
I don't want
to be transformed.

77
00:04:26,184 --> 00:04:27,650
I want to stay ugly.

78
00:04:27,685 --> 00:04:29,902
Oh, you're not ugly,
you're just...

79
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:31,154
not beautiful.

80
00:04:31,189 --> 00:04:33,906
Well, i wouldn't
exactly say that.

81
00:04:34,157 --> 00:04:35,908
It's just that, uh...

82
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:41,914
you're different.

83
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:43,416
Sit down here.

84
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:50,923
Marilyn, your father
was transformed.

85
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:54,177
Yes, number 17
just like you.

86
00:04:54,212 --> 00:04:56,429
A very popular
number these days.

87
00:04:56,464 --> 00:04:59,432
As a matter of fact,
it has been for 20 years.

88
00:04:59,467 --> 00:05:02,185
He wouldn't have settled
for anything less.

89
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,436
But is that good?

90
00:05:03,686 --> 00:05:05,188
Being like everybody-

91
00:05:05,223 --> 00:05:07,940
isn't that the same
as being nobody?

92
00:05:09,192 --> 00:05:11,194
I think it's time
you tell me

93
00:05:11,229 --> 00:05:13,696
where you're getting
these radical ideas.

94
00:05:13,731 --> 00:05:14,947
Daddy once said...

95
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:16,949
your father was
a handsome man.

96
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:18,701
But he thought
about things

97
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:19,952
and he read books.

98
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:22,205
We talked a lot,
just the two of us.

99
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,206
Everybody talks.

100
00:05:23,241 --> 00:05:24,707
I mean about
real things

101
00:05:24,742 --> 00:05:27,710
not just about
electronic baseball
or super soccer

102
00:05:27,745 --> 00:05:29,462
and where to buy
your clothes

103
00:05:29,497 --> 00:05:30,963
or how to fix
your hair.

104
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:31,964
Is that bad?

105
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:34,217
Liking sports,
buying new clothes?

106
00:05:34,252 --> 00:05:35,718
No, of course,
it isn't

107
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:38,221
but there's got
to be more to life.

108
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:40,223
You don't feel
very well.

109
00:05:40,258 --> 00:05:42,225
What you need
is a nice cup

110
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,476
of instant smile.

111
00:05:43,511 --> 00:05:45,728
I had a cup
of instant smile!

112
00:05:45,763 --> 00:05:48,981
I don't feel like
smiling all the time.

113
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:51,484
Sometimes i want
to cry or frown.

114
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:53,236
Won't you understand?

115
00:05:55,988 --> 00:06:00,243
Marilyn, you are
a very sick girl.

116
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:03,996
It's been very nice
talking to you, valerie.

117
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,248
Thank you.

118
00:06:05,283 --> 00:06:07,500
Hi, marilyn.
Hi, valerie.

119
00:06:07,535 --> 00:06:09,001
Are you two
going out?

120
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:11,003
I don't think so,
mrs. Cuberle.

121
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:13,256
You promised
to call me lana, remember?

122
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:15,007
Oh, yes. Lana.

123
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:17,260
Well, i know you two
have a lot to talk about

124
00:06:17,295 --> 00:06:18,761
and i'm due
at culture class.

125
00:06:18,796 --> 00:06:20,513
Bye.
Good-bye.

126
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:24,016
She told you, didn't she?

127
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:25,518
Yes, she did.

128
00:06:25,553 --> 00:06:27,520
Don't you think you're
being awfully silly?

129
00:06:27,555 --> 00:06:30,022
No. There's no law, is there?

130
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:32,275
But it isn't as if
it hurts or anything.

131
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:35,027
When they did mine,
i didn't feel a thing.

132
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:37,530
I know that.

133
00:06:37,565 --> 00:06:39,916
Well, you like the way i look,
don't you?

134
00:06:39,951 --> 00:06:42,668
I like you, val, we're friends.

135
00:06:42,703 --> 00:06:44,670
I liked you
before the transformation.

136
00:06:44,705 --> 00:06:46,172
But you're missing the point.

137
00:06:46,207 --> 00:06:47,924
It's like getting
a new hairstyle

138
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:49,175
or new clothes or something.

139
00:06:49,425 --> 00:06:50,927
You just look better.

140
00:06:50,962 --> 00:06:52,929
I'll look like
one of those drawings

141
00:06:52,964 --> 00:06:54,430
that the bureau sends over.

142
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,932
But they're all beautiful.

143
00:06:55,967 --> 00:06:57,183
What's wrong with that?

144
00:06:57,218 --> 00:06:58,935
It is wrong, valerie.

145
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:00,686
How will you know me?

146
00:07:00,721 --> 00:07:02,688
I mean, how will anyone know me?

147
00:07:02,723 --> 00:07:04,440
I don't want to look
like everyone else.

148
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:05,942
I want to look like me.

149
00:07:05,977 --> 00:07:07,443
And i'm not going
to let them change me.

150
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:09,695
I won't let them change me.

151
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:11,948
Valerie,

152
00:07:11,983 --> 00:07:14,700
please help me.

153
00:07:14,735 --> 00:07:16,702
Please.

154
00:07:21,457 --> 00:07:24,210
Doctor will
see you now.

155
00:07:28,965 --> 00:07:30,716
Ah, come in, please, lana.

156
00:07:30,751 --> 00:07:32,969
Thank you,
doctor.

157
00:07:33,004 --> 00:07:34,971
Come,
marilyn.

158
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:39,976
And this
is marilyn.

159
00:07:40,011 --> 00:07:41,978
Sit down,
sit down.

160
00:07:42,013 --> 00:07:44,480
I'm sorry to have
to bother you, doctor.

161
00:07:44,515 --> 00:07:46,482
It's such a silly
thing, really.

162
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:47,984
Not at all,
not at all.

163
00:07:48,019 --> 00:07:49,986
I see you're
18 now.

164
00:07:50,021 --> 00:07:52,238
It must be
just about time

165
00:07:52,273 --> 00:07:53,739
for you to,
uh...

166
00:07:53,774 --> 00:07:55,741
ah! I see
you've already

167
00:07:55,776 --> 00:07:56,993
received notice.

168
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:58,744
That's why
we're here.

169
00:07:58,779 --> 00:07:59,745
Of course.

170
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,497
You mustn't worry, lana.

171
00:08:01,532 --> 00:08:04,250
Marilyn is like the rest
of them nowadays.

172
00:08:04,285 --> 00:08:06,502
I am?

173
00:08:06,537 --> 00:08:07,753
And it's our fault really.

174
00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:10,006
You see, we haven't given
her any definite reason

175
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:11,757
why she must wait
until the age of 19.

176
00:08:12,008 --> 00:08:13,876
You see, she looks
at you, lana,

177
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:15,878
and the
other women
around her

178
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:18,381
and then
at herself
in the mirror.

179
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:19,632
Doctor...

180
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:23,386
from pure perfection
of body, face, limb,

181
00:08:23,421 --> 00:08:26,639
pigmentation,
stance, carriage,

182
00:08:26,674 --> 00:08:30,643
she looks at herself
and she's horrified.

183
00:08:30,678 --> 00:08:32,895
Isn't that so?
Of course.

184
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:36,148
You see, the poor child
says to herself

185
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:38,401
why should i be so hideous?

186
00:08:38,436 --> 00:08:41,153
So awkward,
oversized, unbalanced,

187
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:45,908
so full of revolting
skin eruptions, eh?

188
00:08:45,943 --> 00:08:47,159
In short, lana,

189
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:49,161
our marilyn is tired
of being a monster.

190
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:50,913
Dr. Rex, you
don't understand.

191
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:51,914
What's that?

192
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:54,050
She isn't anxious.

193
00:08:54,085 --> 00:08:56,052
I don't want to have
the transformation.

194
00:08:56,087 --> 00:08:58,054
You what?

195
00:08:58,089 --> 00:08:59,305
I can't understand.

196
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,807
She never said anything
about it before.

197
00:09:01,842 --> 00:09:03,559
Is this true?

198
00:09:03,594 --> 00:09:05,061
Yes.

199
00:09:05,096 --> 00:09:06,812
She doesn't
give any reasons.

200
00:09:06,847 --> 00:09:09,565
Yes, yes.

201
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,567
Now, marilyn,

202
00:09:11,602 --> 00:09:13,319
suppose you tell me
all about it,

203
00:09:13,354 --> 00:09:15,071
in your own words.

204
00:09:17,573 --> 00:09:18,824
I don't know.

205
00:09:18,859 --> 00:09:21,577
I just don't want the change.

206
00:09:21,612 --> 00:09:24,580
You understand, of course,
that the transformation

207
00:09:24,615 --> 00:09:27,083
has become a normal part
of growing up.

208
00:09:27,118 --> 00:09:28,584
It's a sign of maturity.

209
00:09:28,619 --> 00:09:31,837
What, being like everyone else?

210
00:09:31,872 --> 00:09:33,706
Marilyn...

211
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,210
would you mind

212
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:40,463
if i conducted an
experiment with you?

213
00:09:40,498 --> 00:09:42,214
Purely for
my own records.

214
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:43,466
This way, please.

215
00:09:49,472 --> 00:09:51,474
Sit right down
here, please.

216
00:09:53,976 --> 00:09:57,229
Now, marilyn,
you must try to understand

217
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:59,732
the transformation is
not merely desirable

218
00:09:59,767 --> 00:10:01,984
from an aesthetic
point of view.

219
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:03,486
But experience
has shown us

220
00:10:03,521 --> 00:10:05,488
that it plays a
very important role

221
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:07,490
in psychological
adjustment.

222
00:10:07,525 --> 00:10:08,991
Now just hold your head
very still, please.

223
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:10,493
This won't hurt a bit.

224
00:10:13,496 --> 00:10:15,498
There we are.

225
00:10:30,012 --> 00:10:32,014
That's all
there is to it.

226
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:46,779
Yes.

227
00:10:47,029 --> 00:10:52,535
Lana, you have no idea what
triggered this resentment?

228
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:54,036
I can't imagine.

229
00:10:55,538 --> 00:10:58,290
She's never shown
much interest.

230
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:03,546
It never
occurred to me.

231
00:11:05,548 --> 00:11:08,050
I see that
your husband died

232
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:10,052
in the ganymede
incident.

233
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:11,554
Five years ago.

234
00:11:11,589 --> 00:11:14,056
Did you and he ever
have an occasion

235
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:16,809
to discuss this matter
between yourselves?

236
00:11:16,844 --> 00:11:19,311
Yes, he was opposed
to it at first.

237
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:22,565
But he finally chose
number 17, your number.

238
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,567
Ah, i see.

239
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:28,320
Marilyn, you can
come over here now.

240
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:30,456
We're quite
finished.

241
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:37,713
Now, marilyn, i take it

242
00:11:37,748 --> 00:11:40,216
that you were quite fond
of your father.

243
00:11:41,217 --> 00:11:42,718
Yes.

244
00:11:42,753 --> 00:11:44,470
And you
no doubt

245
00:11:44,505 --> 00:11:46,972
respected
his opinions.

246
00:11:47,007 --> 00:11:50,976
Did he ever say to you that
the transformation was bad?

247
00:11:51,011 --> 00:11:53,729
No, not exactly.

248
00:11:53,764 --> 00:11:55,231
What did he say to you?

249
00:11:55,481 --> 00:12:00,236
He said... he thought
it was tragic.

250
00:12:00,271 --> 00:12:03,239
My husband had some
rather nonconformist ideas,

251
00:12:03,274 --> 00:12:04,490
but it was just talk.

252
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,993
He had the highest physical
and psychological rating

253
00:12:08,028 --> 00:12:09,495
with the rocket service.

254
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:11,497
Yes, yes.

255
00:12:11,532 --> 00:12:16,001
Lana, this case
is extremely unusual.

256
00:12:16,036 --> 00:12:18,504
I'm afraid that
i shall require more time

257
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:20,506
to examine the matter further.

258
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:22,758
Suppose i get in touch with you?

259
00:12:22,793 --> 00:12:25,377
You find out
what's in there?

260
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:26,378
What's
that?

261
00:12:26,629 --> 00:12:30,883
Did you find out
what's inside of me?

262
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:32,384
Yes, indeed.

263
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:37,523
Your general intelligence
rating is quite high.

264
00:12:37,558 --> 00:12:41,277
Your social adaptability
is good.

265
00:12:41,312 --> 00:12:44,280
Your powers of reasoning,
quite normal.

266
00:12:44,315 --> 00:12:46,282
Then why can't i make up
my own mind?

267
00:12:46,317 --> 00:12:47,533
Marilyn, please.

268
00:12:47,568 --> 00:12:51,036
Why are you forcing me
to do something i don't want?

269
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:53,906
You can't make me
do it, can you?

270
00:12:53,941 --> 00:12:56,158
Nobody can
make me do it.

271
00:12:56,193 --> 00:12:58,160
Now, now,
my dear child.

272
00:12:58,195 --> 00:13:00,412
No one has ever
been forced

273
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:02,414
to take
transformation

274
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:04,166
if he
didn't want it.

275
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:06,669
You see, the
problem is simply

276
00:13:06,704 --> 00:13:09,421
to discover why
you don't want it

277
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:10,923
and then to make

278
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:13,175
the necessary
correction.

279
00:13:33,996 --> 00:13:36,499
Right in here, please.

280
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:40,252
What place is this?

281
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:44,757
Marilyn cuberle.

282
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:56,135
Come in and sit down, please.

283
00:14:00,389 --> 00:14:03,392
There's nothing
to be frightened of.

284
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:08,397
Who are you?

285
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:10,399
Sit down, please.

286
00:14:17,907 --> 00:14:22,161
I am professor friend,
sigmund friend.

287
00:14:22,196 --> 00:14:25,664
You must call me
professor sig.

288
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:29,418
Dr. Rex has told me
about you.

289
00:14:29,453 --> 00:14:31,921
I am here to help you.

290
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:33,556
Help me?

291
00:14:33,591 --> 00:14:35,558
To help rid you
of these fears

292
00:14:35,593 --> 00:14:37,059
of this necessary...

293
00:14:37,094 --> 00:14:38,060
that isn't true.

294
00:14:38,095 --> 00:14:39,562
They're
not necessary.

295
00:14:41,599 --> 00:14:43,065
This is very necessary,

296
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,568
very important step
in your life.

297
00:14:45,603 --> 00:14:47,319
Why? Why does everyone
want to force me

298
00:14:47,354 --> 00:14:48,821
to do something
i don't want to do?

299
00:14:48,856 --> 00:14:51,574
But for your own good.

300
00:14:51,609 --> 00:14:53,075
Why else?

301
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:57,329
Why else would the state go
to such trouble and expense?

302
00:14:57,364 --> 00:15:00,082
Many years ago, wiser men than i

303
00:15:00,117 --> 00:15:03,335
decided to try and eliminate
the reasons

304
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:07,590
for inequality and injustice
in this world of ours.

305
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:10,593
They saw in physical
unattractiveness

306
00:15:10,628 --> 00:15:13,596
one of the factors
which made men hate.

307
00:15:13,631 --> 00:15:17,099
So, they charged
the finest scientific minds

308
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:21,103
with the task of eliminating
ugliness in mankind.

309
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:22,721
But i'm not ugly.

310
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:25,224
I'm not pretty,
but i'm not ugly.

311
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:29,478
But to others you are.

312
00:15:29,513 --> 00:15:31,230
Not to people who love me.

313
00:15:32,481 --> 00:15:35,734
There is more to it
than that, of course.

314
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:39,989
As we learned to reshape
the features, remold the body,

315
00:15:40,024 --> 00:15:44,743
we also learned to eliminate
most of the causes of illness

316
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:46,745
and thus to prolong life.

317
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,747
Before the transformation,

318
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:53,252
you could have expected to live
70, 80, perhaps 90 years.

319
00:15:53,502 --> 00:15:56,255
But now you can live
twice that long.

320
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,257
Perhaps
three times.

321
00:15:58,292 --> 00:16:01,510
This is a good
thing, is it not?

322
00:16:01,545 --> 00:16:02,511
Yes...

323
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:06,899
your mother, ah,
she is lovely, is she not?

324
00:16:06,934 --> 00:16:09,518
At one time,
her body, her face,

325
00:16:09,553 --> 00:16:12,521
might already be
showing signs of age,

326
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:15,157
of decay.

327
00:16:15,192 --> 00:16:18,410
You would not deny your mother
her youth, would you?

328
00:16:18,445 --> 00:16:21,163
But you could do that anyway,
couldn't you?

329
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:23,415
Keep me young
without changing me.

330
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:24,917
I wouldn't mind just that.

331
00:16:29,206 --> 00:16:30,673
But someday you might

332
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:32,675
and that would be too late.

333
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:35,678
You see, the transformation
must be performed

334
00:16:35,713 --> 00:16:39,181
when the body and the tissue
are at the proper state.

335
00:16:39,216 --> 00:16:40,933
No, i'll never change my mind.

336
00:16:41,183 --> 00:16:43,435
I've thought about it
and i never will.

337
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:46,438
Why?

338
00:16:46,473 --> 00:16:49,191
Have you ever read shakespeare?

339
00:16:49,226 --> 00:16:51,060
Who?

340
00:16:51,095 --> 00:16:53,062
Or keats or shelley?

341
00:16:53,097 --> 00:16:55,948
Those books were banned
many years ago.

342
00:16:55,983 --> 00:16:57,950
Where did you find them?

343
00:16:57,985 --> 00:17:01,070
My father gave them to me
and lots of others.

344
00:17:01,105 --> 00:17:03,322
Aristotle, socrates,
dostoyevsky.

345
00:17:03,572 --> 00:17:06,825
Did you know that dostoyevsky
was an epileptic?

346
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,827
He was ugly, he was deformed,

347
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:12,081
but he wrote about beauty,
about real beauty.

348
00:17:12,116 --> 00:17:14,583
I must warn you,
this subversive...

349
00:17:14,618 --> 00:17:16,335
these men wrote about life

350
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:19,838
and about the dignity
of the individual human spirit

351
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:21,090
and about love.

352
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:22,341
This is enough!

353
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:27,229
The introduction of smut
into this interview

354
00:17:27,264 --> 00:17:30,232
will not help your case,
young lady, not at all.

355
00:17:30,267 --> 00:17:31,984
May i go?

356
00:17:32,019 --> 00:17:34,987
Yes, certainly, i have
arranged a room for you.

357
00:17:35,022 --> 00:17:36,739
You will be quite
comfortable.

358
00:17:36,774 --> 00:17:38,240
I don't want
to stay here.

359
00:17:38,275 --> 00:17:39,742
I want to go home!

360
00:17:39,777 --> 00:17:41,744
Your mother
will be informed

361
00:17:41,779 --> 00:17:43,996
and you will be
allowed visitors.

362
00:17:44,246 --> 00:17:46,248
Come, my dear.

363
00:17:46,283 --> 00:17:48,250
Why do i have
to stay here?

364
00:17:48,285 --> 00:17:50,502
I am afraid that
for the time being

365
00:17:50,537 --> 00:17:53,255
you must let us decide
what is best for you.

366
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:54,757
We won't
hurt you.

367
00:17:54,792 --> 00:17:56,258
We're going
to help you.

368
00:18:02,631 --> 00:18:04,133
This way, lana.

369
00:18:05,134 --> 00:18:06,885
She's right
in here.

370
00:18:14,276 --> 00:18:15,527
Marilyn?

371
00:18:15,778 --> 00:18:17,780
Marilyn, you
have visitors.

372
00:18:20,783 --> 00:18:22,034
Mother?

373
00:18:25,537 --> 00:18:27,289
She was upset
last night.

374
00:18:27,324 --> 00:18:28,540
I gave her
something

375
00:18:28,575 --> 00:18:29,792
to help her
sleep.

376
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:31,543
She's all right,
isn't she?

377
00:18:31,794 --> 00:18:33,295
You haven't
done anything?

378
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:35,547
Just a mild
sedative.

379
00:18:35,582 --> 00:18:37,049
Now if
you ladies

380
00:18:37,084 --> 00:18:38,300
will
excuse me.

381
00:18:39,301 --> 00:18:41,553
Darling, we'd have
been here sooner

382
00:18:41,588 --> 00:18:44,306
but the doctor said
you were sleeping.

383
00:18:44,341 --> 00:18:45,808
Do you feel all right?

384
00:18:45,843 --> 00:18:46,809
Yes.

385
00:18:46,844 --> 00:18:48,060
Hello, valerie.

386
00:18:48,095 --> 00:18:49,812
Hi, honey,
what happened?

387
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:52,064
Nothing.

388
00:18:52,099 --> 00:18:54,817
They just wouldn't
let me go.

389
00:18:54,852 --> 00:18:57,069
Oh, mother, they're
going to do it anyway.

390
00:18:57,104 --> 00:18:59,321
They're going to
make me do it!

391
00:18:59,356 --> 00:19:02,324
No, marilyn, dr. Rex
promised, remember?

392
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:03,826
He was lying!

393
00:19:03,861 --> 00:19:05,828
Lying, but why should he?

394
00:19:05,863 --> 00:19:09,081
He has to say that
to keep people from finding out

395
00:19:09,331 --> 00:19:13,085
the transformation will be done
whether you want it or not.

396
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,837
I don't see
why you're unhappy

397
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:17,339
when all they want to do
is make you pretty.

398
00:19:17,374 --> 00:19:19,341
But that's not true!

399
00:19:19,376 --> 00:19:22,711
Last night, before
i went to sleep,

400
00:19:22,746 --> 00:19:25,714
i remembered something
that father said.

401
00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:28,467
He said, "when
everyone is beautiful

402
00:19:28,717 --> 00:19:30,469
"no one will be

403
00:19:30,504 --> 00:19:32,221
"because
without ugliness

404
00:19:32,256 --> 00:19:34,223
there can be
no beauty."

405
00:19:34,258 --> 00:19:35,974
Mother, don't
you understand?

406
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:38,977
They don't care whether
you're beautiful or not.

407
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:41,480
They just want everyone
to be the same.

408
00:19:41,515 --> 00:19:42,731
"They"?

409
00:19:42,766 --> 00:19:45,234
Who are you
talking about?

410
00:19:45,269 --> 00:19:46,485
I'm terribly
sorry,

411
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,486
but i'm afraid

412
00:19:47,521 --> 00:19:48,987
it's time
to leave now.

413
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:51,240
Oh, well.

414
00:19:51,275 --> 00:19:52,241
If it's
all right,

415
00:19:52,276 --> 00:19:53,992
i'd like to talk
to marilyn.

416
00:19:54,243 --> 00:19:55,494
Just for a
few minutes.

417
00:19:55,744 --> 00:19:56,995
Don't worry,
darling

418
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,498
everything's going
to be all right.

419
00:20:05,754 --> 00:20:08,507
I've been thinking
about what you said.

420
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:11,009
I mean about what
your father said

421
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:13,011
and... well,
i don't see why

422
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:15,013
you're so concerned
about him.

423
00:20:15,264 --> 00:20:17,015
He's dead.

424
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:19,518
I mean, surely
you've had

425
00:20:19,553 --> 00:20:21,270
other fathers.

426
00:20:21,305 --> 00:20:23,021
My mother's been
married 11 times

427
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:24,022
and personally

428
00:20:24,273 --> 00:20:26,275
i've liked the
stepfathers better.

429
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:27,526
Valerie,
please don't.

430
00:20:27,776 --> 00:20:30,028
Look, i know you've
had nine fathers

431
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:31,280
since the first one.

432
00:20:31,315 --> 00:20:34,032
Everybody marries
everybody these days.

433
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:35,284
Valerie, stop.

434
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:38,036
I just don't see how
anybody can stay married

435
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:40,539
to the same husband
for a hundred years.

436
00:20:40,574 --> 00:20:43,792
Besides, i've heard that
your father was pretty dull.

437
00:20:43,827 --> 00:20:45,294
Valerie, stop it!

438
00:20:45,329 --> 00:20:47,045
Stop talking about my father!

439
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,797
Can't any of you understand?

440
00:20:48,832 --> 00:20:50,299
I loved him.

441
00:20:50,334 --> 00:20:51,550
I cared about him.

442
00:20:51,585 --> 00:20:54,803
He was good and he was kind
and he cared about me;

443
00:20:54,838 --> 00:20:57,055
not what i wore,
not the way i looked

444
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:59,057
but what i thought, what i felt.

445
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:02,561
He cared about himself and
his dignity as a human being.

446
00:21:02,596 --> 00:21:05,564
Valerie, he didn't die
in the ganymede incident.

447
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:07,065
My father killed himself.

448
00:21:07,316 --> 00:21:08,567
Because
when they took away

449
00:21:08,602 --> 00:21:11,069
his identity he had no reason
to go on living.

450
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:14,573
I just don't
understand you, marilyn.

451
00:21:14,608 --> 00:21:17,826
Valerie...

452
00:21:17,861 --> 00:21:20,329
can't you feel anything?

453
00:21:20,364 --> 00:21:22,831
Well, of course, silly.

454
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:25,083
I feel... i feel good.

455
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:27,336
I always feel good.

456
00:21:27,371 --> 00:21:30,339
"Life is pretty, life is fun

457
00:21:30,374 --> 00:21:33,342
i am all and all is one."

458
00:21:35,262 --> 00:21:37,729
You can't understand, can you?

459
00:21:37,764 --> 00:21:39,348
What?

460
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,851
They can't
understand.

461
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:48,106
They can't
understand.

462
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:51,109
They can't understand.

463
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:49,551
Come in,
my dear.

464
00:22:49,586 --> 00:22:50,802
We've been expecting you.

465
00:22:51,053 --> 00:22:53,305
Sooner or later,
everyone wants to be beautiful.

466
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,806
Where's
your number?

467
00:22:56,808 --> 00:22:59,311
She's chosen
number eight.

468
00:22:59,346 --> 00:23:01,313
Excellent,
excellent.

469
00:23:10,572 --> 00:23:12,324
I just love
your suit, val.

470
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:13,575
Lana, val!

471
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:14,826
You're just
in time.

472
00:23:15,077 --> 00:23:16,078
It's all
over, doctor?

473
00:23:16,113 --> 00:23:17,079
All over.

474
00:23:17,114 --> 00:23:18,580
Is she
all right?

475
00:23:18,615 --> 00:23:19,581
She's fine.

476
00:23:19,616 --> 00:23:21,333
You'll see for
yourselves.

477
00:23:21,368 --> 00:23:22,834
I've been
so worried-

478
00:23:22,869 --> 00:23:24,586
not being able
to talk to her

479
00:23:24,836 --> 00:23:26,838
and she seemed
in such a state.

480
00:23:26,873 --> 00:23:28,340
Well, it's
as i told you.

481
00:23:28,375 --> 00:23:29,841
Occasionally,
a person has

482
00:23:29,876 --> 00:23:31,843
difficulty adjusting
to the idea.

483
00:23:31,878 --> 00:23:34,346
But we've
improved methods
since the old days

484
00:23:34,381 --> 00:23:36,348
and now it always
turns out well.

485
00:23:36,383 --> 00:23:37,599
Never fails.

486
00:23:37,634 --> 00:23:38,600
It's complete.

487
00:23:38,635 --> 00:23:40,102
Mother!

488
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:43,722
Mother, val.

489
00:23:43,757 --> 00:23:45,474
Look at me.

490
00:23:45,509 --> 00:23:47,976
What do you think?

491
00:23:48,011 --> 00:23:50,228
You're beautiful,
marilyn

492
00:23:50,263 --> 00:23:51,480
just beautiful.

493
00:23:59,988 --> 00:24:03,492
And the nicest
part of all, val-

494
00:24:03,527 --> 00:24:05,744
i look just like you.

495
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:07,996
Portrait of a young lady
in love-

496
00:24:08,031 --> 00:24:09,748
with herself.

497
00:24:09,783 --> 00:24:12,501
Improbable? Perhaps.

498
00:24:12,536 --> 00:24:14,753
But in an age
of plastic surgery,

499
00:24:14,788 --> 00:24:17,756
body building
and an infinity of cosmetics

500
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:20,258
let us hesitate
to say impossible.

501
00:24:20,293 --> 00:24:22,761
These and other
strange blessings

502
00:24:22,796 --> 00:24:25,013
may be waiting in the future

503
00:24:25,048 --> 00:24:28,517
which, after all,
is the twilight zone.

504
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:33,688
And now, mr. Serling.

505
00:24:33,723 --> 00:24:36,441
Earl hamner, jr. Brings his
typewriter and his fertile mind

506
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:38,193
back intothe twilight zone
next time

507
00:24:38,228 --> 00:24:39,444
with a program about visitors.

508
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:40,946
On the surface
they're beatniks-

509
00:24:40,981 --> 00:24:42,948
a few raunchy looking characters
on motorcycles

510
00:24:42,983 --> 00:24:44,199
draw into town one day.

511
00:24:44,234 --> 00:24:46,201
But once you meet them,
you won't forget them-

512
00:24:46,236 --> 00:24:48,203
they're quite different
from what they appear.

513
00:24:48,238 --> 00:24:50,705
Onthe twilight zone,
lee kinsolving, shelley fabares

514
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:55,710
and michael forest
star in "black leather jackets."
