1
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:12,262
You're traveling
through another dimension-

2
00:00:12,297 --> 00:00:16,016
a dimension not only of sight
and sound, but of mind,

3
00:00:16,051 --> 00:00:17,267
a journey into a wondrous land

4
00:00:17,302 --> 00:00:19,769
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

5
00:00:19,804 --> 00:00:22,272
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

6
00:02:30,266 --> 00:02:32,652
Mr. Mulligan, a rather
dour critic of his times,

7
00:02:32,687 --> 00:02:35,772
is shortly to discover
the import of that old phrase,

8
00:02:35,807 --> 00:02:38,274
"out of the frying pan,
into the fire"-

9
00:02:38,309 --> 00:02:40,777
said fire burning brightly
at all times

10
00:02:40,812 --> 00:02:43,279
in the twilight zone.

11
00:07:07,795 --> 00:07:09,629
You better move,
mister.

12
00:07:09,664 --> 00:07:11,881
Get out of the street.

13
00:07:14,418 --> 00:07:16,886
You want
to get yourself killed?!

14
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,888
Hey, get out of there.

15
00:07:41,946 --> 00:07:44,046
Harmony?

16
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:50,803
Hey!

17
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:06,435
Hey!

18
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,574
Hey! That's mine!

19
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,097
There's nothing going on
around here, sergeant.

20
00:08:35,132 --> 00:08:37,216
Everything's as quiet as a...
mouse!

21
00:08:37,251 --> 00:08:37,850
Hey, you!

22
00:08:46,976 --> 00:08:49,862
Call you back, sergeant.

23
00:08:49,897 --> 00:08:50,479
Hey!

24
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:11,000
Stop in the name of the law!

25
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,162
Oh!

26
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,785
You juvenile delinquent, you!

27
00:09:59,467 --> 00:10:01,300
Oh, no!

28
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,808
It's broken.

29
00:10:08,843 --> 00:10:11,944
How am i going
to get back now?

30
00:10:16,065 --> 00:10:18,567
I only got 15 minutes.

31
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,706
Let me try to
understand this, sir.

32
00:10:23,741 --> 00:10:26,208
You have this
funny-looking hat, no pants,

33
00:10:26,243 --> 00:10:28,711
and you've got to get
back to somewhere

34
00:10:28,746 --> 00:10:29,328
within 15 minutes?

35
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:30,579
Right.

36
00:10:30,614 --> 00:10:32,465
This is a time helmet.

37
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,716
I'm from 1890.

38
00:10:33,751 --> 00:10:36,218
That's where i've
got to get back to.

39
00:10:36,253 --> 00:10:38,087
And your trousers?

40
00:10:38,122 --> 00:10:40,589
I hung them up
to dry in 1890.

41
00:10:40,624 --> 00:10:41,841
You're from 1890?

42
00:10:41,876 --> 00:10:43,092
What proof have you?

43
00:10:43,127 --> 00:10:44,343
Proof?

44
00:10:44,378 --> 00:10:47,480
Yes. Ah! That watch.

45
00:10:47,515 --> 00:10:48,731
Those clothes.

46
00:10:48,766 --> 00:10:49,982
Where did
you get them?

47
00:10:50,599 --> 00:10:51,851
They're mine.

48
00:10:51,886 --> 00:10:53,736
Is it possible?!

49
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:57,490
Quickly- who
is the president?

50
00:10:57,525 --> 00:10:58,741
You mean
benjamin harrison?

51
00:10:58,776 --> 00:10:59,992
Benjamin harrison.

52
00:11:00,027 --> 00:11:01,243
And before him?

53
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:02,495
Grover cleveland.

54
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:03,746
But what's that...?

55
00:11:03,781 --> 00:11:04,997
By george!

56
00:11:05,032 --> 00:11:06,866
I believe you, sir!

57
00:11:06,901 --> 00:11:08,751
You are from 1890!

58
00:11:08,786 --> 00:11:10,619
Well, that's
no news to me.

59
00:11:10,654 --> 00:11:13,122
How to get back
would be news.

60
00:11:13,157 --> 00:11:15,007
And this is
the device, eh?

61
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:16,876
How does it work?

62
00:11:16,911 --> 00:11:18,127
Well, you...

63
00:11:18,162 --> 00:11:20,012
well, i don't know!

64
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:21,881
See, i'm only
the janitor.

65
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:23,132
Janitor, hmm?

66
00:11:23,167 --> 00:11:25,634
Hmm. Primitive,
but functional.

67
00:11:25,669 --> 00:11:26,886
Yes, yes, yes.

68
00:11:26,921 --> 00:11:28,771
Fascinating.

69
00:11:28,806 --> 00:11:31,273
Oh! Where are
you going?

70
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,029
Proprietor!

71
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,531
Propri...

72
00:11:38,566 --> 00:11:39,782
yeah?

73
00:11:44,653 --> 00:11:47,156
Would you come here
a moment, please?

74
00:11:48,826 --> 00:11:50,042
Yes, please.

75
00:11:50,077 --> 00:11:51,293
What is it?

76
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:53,162
Can you fix it?

77
00:11:53,197 --> 00:11:55,047
We can fix anything.

78
00:11:55,082 --> 00:11:56,298
Good.

79
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,418
Thursday,
about 2:00.

80
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:07,927
Thursday?!
Thursday?!

81
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,072
You don't understand.

82
00:12:20,107 --> 00:12:23,192
This man must
get back to 1890.

83
00:12:23,227 --> 00:12:25,077
Oh, you're in
the wrong block.

84
00:12:25,112 --> 00:12:26,946
This is
only 1600.

85
00:12:26,981 --> 00:12:28,197
No, no, no, no, no.

86
00:12:28,232 --> 00:12:30,082
That's a time helmet.

87
00:12:30,117 --> 00:12:32,585
And this man
is from the year 1890.

88
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:35,704
What are you,
some kind of nut?

89
00:12:35,739 --> 00:12:36,956
I'm an electronic
scientist.

90
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,458
Now, just lend me
those tools...

91
00:12:39,493 --> 00:12:40,709
don't touch!

92
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:42,461
But this is...

93
00:12:42,496 --> 00:12:44,346
don't touch...

94
00:12:44,381 --> 00:12:46,849
don't touch
the tools!

95
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:56,859
Listen to me.

96
00:12:56,894 --> 00:12:58,110
Howdy.

97
00:12:58,145 --> 00:13:00,613
I'm going to tell you something.

98
00:13:00,648 --> 00:13:01,864
Yeah.

99
00:13:01,899 --> 00:13:05,618
That man doesn't
have all his buttons.

100
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,125
Oh, you don't believe me, huh?

101
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,994
Well, i'll prove it to you.

102
00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:16,879
Look at these papers.

103
00:13:16,914 --> 00:13:18,130
We barely have
15 minutes

104
00:13:18,165 --> 00:13:20,499
to get back to his
time continuum.

105
00:13:20,534 --> 00:13:21,750
If you'll repair...

106
00:13:21,785 --> 00:13:23,002
excuse me.

107
00:13:24,253 --> 00:13:25,504
This feller says

108
00:13:25,539 --> 00:13:28,007
he hasn't got
all his buttons.

109
00:13:28,042 --> 00:13:30,509
What's he mean,
he has no buttons?

110
00:13:30,544 --> 00:13:33,646
Means he has no mental
facilities, yes?

111
00:13:33,681 --> 00:13:34,897
Who said that?

112
00:13:34,932 --> 00:13:37,399
This feller here
in the window.

113
00:13:37,434 --> 00:13:39,268
That's tv!

114
00:13:39,303 --> 00:13:40,519
Who's tv?

115
00:13:40,554 --> 00:13:42,404
Tv- television.

116
00:13:42,439 --> 00:13:44,907
Oh, you wouldn't
understand if i told...

117
00:13:44,942 --> 00:13:48,027
what on earth are you
doing, young man?

118
00:13:48,062 --> 00:13:49,912
Don't do that
to me, pal.

119
00:13:49,947 --> 00:13:51,163
Look, look, look.

120
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:52,414
All we want

121
00:13:52,449 --> 00:13:54,283
is this soldered
to that.

122
00:13:54,318 --> 00:13:56,168
Don't touch the
tools, will you?

123
00:13:56,203 --> 00:13:57,419
You don't
understand.

124
00:13:57,454 --> 00:14:01,173
D-d-don't touch my tools,
if you don't mind.

125
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:04,293
Look, allow me to
show this to you.

126
00:14:04,328 --> 00:14:05,544
Don't touch
the tools!

127
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,301
What did you say?

128
00:14:12,336 --> 00:14:14,803
I'm trying
to explain to you...

129
00:14:14,838 --> 00:14:16,689
don't holler.
Don't holler!

130
00:14:16,724 --> 00:14:17,940
You don't...

131
00:14:17,975 --> 00:14:19,191
just a moment, please.

132
00:14:21,729 --> 00:14:22,945
Now...

133
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,196
help!

134
00:14:24,813 --> 00:14:26,699
Help!

135
00:14:27,316 --> 00:14:29,201
H-h-help!

136
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,321
H-h-he...

137
00:14:32,356 --> 00:14:34,823
what are you
doing in here?!

138
00:14:34,858 --> 00:14:38,577
Now, look, we want to get
this thing finished in time.

139
00:14:38,612 --> 00:14:40,462
Just sit down
quietly, please.

140
00:14:40,497 --> 00:14:41,714
Now.

141
00:14:41,749 --> 00:14:43,582
You sure this isn't

142
00:14:43,617 --> 00:14:45,467
some kind of
a coffee maker?

143
00:14:45,502 --> 00:14:47,336
No, sir, that's a
very scientific

144
00:14:47,371 --> 00:14:49,221
piece of equipment.

145
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,114
Five dollars, please.

146
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:32,765
What is that little
thing in there?

147
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,016
Oh, well,
that, you see...

148
00:15:34,051 --> 00:15:35,267
that is a transitron.

149
00:15:35,302 --> 00:15:37,136
Don't... don't
touch my tools,

150
00:15:37,171 --> 00:15:38,387
if you don't mind.

151
00:15:38,422 --> 00:15:40,889
I'm merely trying
to point out to you that,

152
00:15:40,924 --> 00:15:42,775
in order to
facilitate that...

153
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:44,643
don't point with
my tools, please.

154
00:15:44,678 --> 00:15:47,780
Would you allow me
to please make this
clear to you?

155
00:15:47,815 --> 00:15:49,031
Don't you understa...?

156
00:15:49,066 --> 00:15:50,899
That's mine!

157
00:15:50,934 --> 00:15:53,402
Oh, just a moment!

158
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:04,046
Now where has he gone?

159
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,668
Come on out.

160
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:13,422
Will you come out?!

161
00:16:15,924 --> 00:16:17,810
Just keep working.

162
00:16:17,845 --> 00:16:19,061
Keep working!

163
00:16:31,358 --> 00:16:33,075
Hey...

164
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:34,576
what's the idea

165
00:16:34,611 --> 00:16:36,445
of running around
the street

166
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,330
with no pants on?

167
00:17:06,475 --> 00:17:08,977
Alley... oop!

168
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:42,010
Well, is it ready?

169
00:17:42,045 --> 00:17:43,896
Couple of small,
minor adjustments,

170
00:17:43,931 --> 00:17:45,764
you'll
be all set.

171
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:47,649
I envy you
your trip, sir.

172
00:17:47,684 --> 00:17:51,653
1890 is a
wonderful period.

173
00:17:51,688 --> 00:17:54,156
Mmm. For instance,
no income tax.

174
00:17:54,191 --> 00:17:56,024
Income tax?

175
00:17:56,059 --> 00:17:58,527
I am a scholar
of that period, sir.

176
00:17:58,562 --> 00:18:02,281
It has a charm- nay,
a fascination- for me.

177
00:18:02,316 --> 00:18:03,532
The very thought

178
00:18:03,567 --> 00:18:07,286
of having lived
in those halcyon days...

179
00:18:07,321 --> 00:18:09,171
i'll sure be glad
to get back.

180
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:11,039
If i ever do.

181
00:18:11,074 --> 00:18:13,542
How much time
is there left?

182
00:18:13,577 --> 00:18:14,793
Oh...

183
00:18:14,828 --> 00:18:16,678
we got less than
five minutes!

184
00:18:16,713 --> 00:18:19,798
Mmm. Tell me
about your town, sir.

185
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:22,935
Where, for instance,
might a scientist
find employment?

186
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:24,186
You a scientist?

187
00:18:24,221 --> 00:18:26,688
Yes. Are there any
in your town?

188
00:18:26,723 --> 00:18:27,940
Well, professor gilbert.

189
00:18:27,975 --> 00:18:29,808
I work for him.

190
00:18:29,843 --> 00:18:31,059
There you are, gentlemen.

191
00:18:31,094 --> 00:18:32,945
All fixed.

192
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:35,197
Good. What
do we do now?

193
00:18:35,232 --> 00:18:36,315
Uh... pay me.

194
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,566
Hmm?

195
00:18:37,601 --> 00:18:40,068
Pay the man,
pay the man.

196
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:45,324
Ah! That's just
the right amount.

197
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:46,575
Thank you.

198
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:48,460
Uh... how does
it work?

199
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:50,963
Oh, you just
set this dial.

200
00:18:54,868 --> 00:18:56,084
Good!

201
00:18:58,005 --> 00:19:00,472
Hey, what are
you doing?

202
00:19:00,507 --> 00:19:02,341
I intend to
use it myself

203
00:19:02,376 --> 00:19:03,592
in exactly
three minutes.

204
00:19:03,627 --> 00:19:04,843
You can't do that!

205
00:19:04,878 --> 00:19:06,094
But iam
doing it, sir.

206
00:19:06,129 --> 00:19:07,980
I'm returning to
that time of bliss

207
00:19:08,015 --> 00:19:08,597
and simple pleasures!

208
00:19:08,632 --> 00:19:09,848
And leaving me here?

209
00:19:09,883 --> 00:19:11,733
Your fate is
unimportant, sir.

210
00:19:11,768 --> 00:19:13,602
You are a janitor.

211
00:19:13,637 --> 00:19:14,853
I am a scientist!

212
00:19:14,888 --> 00:19:16,104
Why, i...

213
00:19:16,139 --> 00:19:17,356
stand back!

214
00:19:17,391 --> 00:19:19,241
In less than
three minutes,

215
00:19:19,276 --> 00:19:21,743
i shall have escaped
this age of madness!

216
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:25,364
Look, look.

217
00:19:25,399 --> 00:19:27,249
I brought a chicken
with me

218
00:19:27,284 --> 00:19:29,117
all the way from 1890.

219
00:19:29,152 --> 00:19:30,369
All i did was hold it.

220
00:19:30,404 --> 00:19:32,254
We can go back together.

221
00:19:32,289 --> 00:19:33,505
You're lying, sir.

222
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,756
I am not.

223
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:28,310
Hey, look out!

224
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:34,182
Get that nut
out of here.

225
00:20:34,217 --> 00:20:37,319
1890, here i come.

226
00:23:48,877 --> 00:23:50,762
"To each his own."

227
00:23:50,797 --> 00:23:52,631
So goes another old phrase

228
00:23:52,666 --> 00:23:56,384
to which mr. Woodrow mulligan
would heartily subscribe.

229
00:23:56,419 --> 00:23:58,887
For he has learned,
definitely the hard way,

230
00:23:58,922 --> 00:24:02,023
that there is much wisdom
in a third old phrase

231
00:24:02,058 --> 00:24:03,892
which goes as follows:

232
00:24:03,927 --> 00:24:05,777
"Stay in your own backyard."

233
00:24:05,812 --> 00:24:07,646
To which it might be added,

234
00:24:07,681 --> 00:24:10,782
"and, if possible, assist
others to stay in theirs."

235
00:24:10,817 --> 00:24:13,285
Via, of course,
the twilight zone.

236
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:17,989
Rod serling,
creator ofthe twilight zone,

237
00:24:18,024 --> 00:24:19,875
will tell you
about next week's story

238
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:22,377
after this message.

239
00:24:23,979 --> 00:24:25,664
And now, mr. Serling.

240
00:24:25,699 --> 00:24:27,549
Next week, onthe twilight zone,

241
00:24:27,584 --> 00:24:29,417
you'll find yourself
inexplicably entangled

242
00:24:29,452 --> 00:24:30,669
in this dark dungeon.

243
00:24:30,704 --> 00:24:33,171
You'll meet an incredible
group of people who, like you,

244
00:24:33,206 --> 00:24:35,674
will be quite unable to explain
how they got there,

245
00:24:35,709 --> 00:24:37,559
why they got there,
or how they're going to get out.

246
00:24:37,594 --> 00:24:39,427
And, at the end,
we're going to belt you

247
00:24:39,462 --> 00:24:41,930
with one of the most surprising
endings we've ever had.

248
00:24:41,965 --> 00:24:43,815
Next week, "five characters
in search of an exit"

249
00:24:44,432 --> 00:24:46,318
onthe twilight zone.

250
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:20,468
Seat belts can reduce
serious injury by one-third.

251
00:25:20,503 --> 00:25:23,605
Does your family have
the security of seat belts?
