00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:09,626
You unlock this door
with the key of imagination.

2
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,128
Beyond it is another dimension-

3
00:00:12,163 --> 00:00:14,014
a dimension of sound,

4
00:00:14,049 --> 00:00:16,516
a dimension of sight,

5
00:00:16,551 --> 00:00:18,385
a dimension of mind.

6
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,521
You're moving into a land
of both shadow and substance,

7
00:00:21,556 --> 00:00:23,390
of things and ideas.

8
00:00:23,425 --> 00:00:27,777
You've just crossed over
into the twilight zone.

9
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:44,294
Yes, sir.

10
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,915
Yes, sir.

11
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:52,052
Yes, i'll send you a check
first thing in the morning.

12
00:00:52,087 --> 00:00:54,554
Right.

13
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:40,216
Need some help?

14
00:01:40,251 --> 00:01:42,102
No, thanks.

15
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:48,358
I enjoy kicking around
broken-down chairs.

16
00:01:48,393 --> 00:01:50,226
It's good for
the circulation.

17
00:01:50,261 --> 00:01:51,478
Oh? Yours
or the paper's?

18
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,363
Very funny.

19
00:01:53,398 --> 00:01:55,865
Come on, now, doug,
things aren't that bad.

20
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,734
Don't be such
an old gloom cookie.

21
00:01:57,769 --> 00:01:58,985
I am not now,

22
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:02,122
nor have i ever been
a "gloom cookie."

23
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,875
Thanks.

24
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:10,880
Oh, hi, andy.

25
00:02:10,915 --> 00:02:12,749
I'd like to talk
to you, mr. Winter.

26
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:14,000
He's tired, andy.

27
00:02:14,035 --> 00:02:15,251
Can't it wait
till tomorrow?

28
00:02:15,286 --> 00:02:16,503
It's all
right, jackie.

29
00:02:16,538 --> 00:02:18,388
What's on your
mind, andy?

30
00:02:18,423 --> 00:02:20,890
Well, sir, the...

31
00:02:22,177 --> 00:02:24,010
the fact is, i...

32
00:02:24,045 --> 00:02:25,261
well, i...

33
00:02:43,279 --> 00:02:45,165
that help, andy?

34
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,667
Yeah, thanks.

35
00:02:47,702 --> 00:02:49,536
Mr. Winter, i...
i hate to have

36
00:02:49,571 --> 00:02:52,038
to tell you this,
but i'm resigning.

37
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:55,175
All right.

38
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:57,043
When?

39
00:02:57,078 --> 00:02:57,927
Right away.

40
00:02:57,962 --> 00:02:59,796
I mean, i know
it ain't your fault,

41
00:02:59,831 --> 00:03:02,298
but it's eight weeks
since i've been paid.

42
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:03,550
Oh, i understand.

43
00:03:03,585 --> 00:03:05,435
I really hate to do it,
mr. Winter,

44
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,303
but a man's got to eat.

45
00:03:07,338 --> 00:03:09,806
Andy praskins,
you ought to be
ashamed of yourself!

46
00:03:09,841 --> 00:03:11,057
Jackie...

47
00:03:11,092 --> 00:03:12,942
the best boss
a man could work for.

48
00:03:12,977 --> 00:03:14,811
Who said that, andy?
Who said it?

49
00:03:14,846 --> 00:03:16,196
I did, miss benson,
and i meant it.

50
00:03:16,231 --> 00:03:18,064
And this is the
way you repay

51
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:19,315
the best boss a
man could work for?

52
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:21,818
By quitting him
just when he needs
you the most?

53
00:03:21,853 --> 00:03:23,703
I said i hate to do it.

54
00:03:23,738 --> 00:03:25,572
Well, then why do it?

55
00:03:25,607 --> 00:03:26,823
I mean, just because
of a little setback...

56
00:03:26,858 --> 00:03:28,708
it ain't just a
little setback,

57
00:03:28,743 --> 00:03:29,959
and you know it.

58
00:03:29,994 --> 00:03:31,327
And so does
mr. Winter.

59
00:03:31,362 --> 00:03:33,213
This paper is finished,
miss benson.

60
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:33,830
It was finished
the minute

61
00:03:33,865 --> 00:03:35,715
thegazettemoved
into town.

62
00:03:35,832 --> 00:03:38,334
How you gonna buck a syndicate
like that?

63
00:03:38,369 --> 00:03:40,837
They can pour thousands
of dollars into that operation,

64
00:03:40,872 --> 00:03:42,722
lose every penny
and still not feel it.

65
00:03:42,757 --> 00:03:45,225
They've got a half
dozen reporters,

66
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,093
a morning edition,
a night edition.

67
00:03:47,128 --> 00:03:50,230
I ask you,
how you gonna lick that?

68
00:03:50,265 --> 00:03:52,599
You're not.

69
00:03:52,634 --> 00:03:55,235
Right. So i
say, join 'em.

70
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:57,737
You mean you are going
to work forthem?

71
00:03:57,772 --> 00:03:59,606
Yes, miss benson,
beginning tomorrow.

72
00:03:59,641 --> 00:04:00,857
And if you're smart...

73
00:04:00,892 --> 00:04:05,245
get out of here, andy.
Just get out of here.

74
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,115
Andy.

75
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:11,868
Yes, mr. Winter?

76
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:14,370
Good luck.

77
00:04:14,405 --> 00:04:16,256
Thank you, sir.

78
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:18,758
I still say
you're the best.

79
00:04:18,793 --> 00:04:20,627
Good-bye.

80
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:26,883
Oh, boy!

81
00:04:26,918 --> 00:04:28,768
That's gratitude
for you.

82
00:04:28,803 --> 00:04:30,019
After all the times

83
00:04:30,054 --> 00:04:31,271
you've stayed up
until midnight

84
00:04:31,306 --> 00:04:32,522
correcting
his mistakes.

85
00:04:32,557 --> 00:04:34,390
Jackie...
the days off
you gave him.

86
00:04:34,425 --> 00:04:36,276
Jackie...
well, can't you
ever get mad

87
00:04:36,311 --> 00:04:38,144
at anything around
here except chairs?

88
00:04:38,179 --> 00:04:40,647
That wasandy praskins
who walked out.

89
00:04:40,682 --> 00:04:42,532
Our linotype operator.

90
00:04:42,567 --> 00:04:44,400
Don't you
realize that?
I know.

91
00:04:44,435 --> 00:04:46,286
Well, then why didn't
you do something?

92
00:04:46,321 --> 00:04:48,788
Do something?!

93
00:04:48,823 --> 00:04:52,542
I'd do anything i could
to save this place,

94
00:04:52,577 --> 00:04:55,662
anything...
but andy's right.

95
00:04:55,697 --> 00:04:58,798
It's too late.
I'm through.

96
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:00,049
Oh, no.

97
00:05:00,084 --> 00:05:01,301
Oh, don't say that.

98
00:05:01,336 --> 00:05:03,803
Please don't say it.

99
00:05:03,838 --> 00:05:07,557
Why, this was
your dream, doug.

100
00:05:07,592 --> 00:05:11,311
Well, right now,
i'm... i'm awake.

101
00:05:11,346 --> 00:05:15,064
Miss benson,
why don't you go home?

102
00:05:15,099 --> 00:05:16,933
I've got a lot
of work to do.

103
00:05:16,968 --> 00:05:18,818
Oh, doug, let
me just stay.

104
00:05:18,853 --> 00:05:20,687
You heard me.
You go on home.

105
00:05:20,722 --> 00:05:23,189
I'm a very busy man.

106
00:05:23,224 --> 00:05:24,440
Well, what are
you going to do?

107
00:05:24,475 --> 00:05:28,194
Right now, i'm
going to see you
to the front door.

108
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,084
Will you be all right?

109
00:05:35,119 --> 00:05:36,336
Yeah, sure.

110
00:05:36,953 --> 00:05:39,455
It's not the end of
the world, you know.

111
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:41,958
Call me if you need me,
will you?

112
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:09,856
Young man.

113
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:14,861
Might i trouble
you for a match?

114
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,865
Yeah. Sure.

115
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,367
It's a lovely night, isn't it?

116
00:08:21,402 --> 00:08:23,870
Lovely spot, too.

117
00:08:23,905 --> 00:08:25,121
Smell the pines.

118
00:08:25,156 --> 00:08:28,875
It's a pity
you have to leave it all.

119
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,760
What do you mean?

120
00:08:30,795 --> 00:08:33,880
Well, you were about
to commit suicide, weren't you?

121
00:08:35,131 --> 00:08:37,016
That's none of your business.

122
00:08:37,051 --> 00:08:38,885
I agree.

123
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,770
If a man wants
to do away with himself,

124
00:08:40,805 --> 00:08:43,890
i say that's his decision,
nobody else's.

125
00:08:43,925 --> 00:08:47,643
But i do think you ought
to make a good job of it.

126
00:08:47,678 --> 00:08:51,397
This looks very uncertain
to me, frankly.

127
00:08:51,432 --> 00:08:54,534
You might end up with nothing
more than a head cold.

128
00:08:54,569 --> 00:08:57,653
I certainly
wouldn't want
to risk it.

129
00:08:57,688 --> 00:09:00,156
By the way,
did you find a match?

130
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,046
No, i... i don't have one.

131
00:09:07,663 --> 00:09:08,915
Well, doesn't matter.

132
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:12,051
Good night.

133
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,673
Aren't you
going to jump?

134
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:20,176
Why, do you want
to watch?

135
00:09:20,211 --> 00:09:21,427
No, heavens no.

136
00:09:21,462 --> 00:09:23,312
But i was
just thinking,

137
00:09:23,347 --> 00:09:25,181
if you aren't
going to,

138
00:09:25,216 --> 00:09:27,066
perhaps you
wouldn't mind

139
00:09:27,101 --> 00:09:28,935
giving me a
lift into town?

140
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:30,820
Now, i don't want you
to change your plans

141
00:09:30,855 --> 00:09:32,688
on my behalf, you understand.

142
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:39,579
Yeah.

143
00:09:42,198 --> 00:09:43,449
Come on.

144
00:09:43,484 --> 00:09:45,334
Well, thank you.

145
00:09:45,369 --> 00:09:47,203
Wait a minute.

146
00:09:47,703 --> 00:09:48,955
I found a light.

147
00:09:56,212 --> 00:09:58,097
Take away a man's dream,

148
00:09:58,132 --> 00:10:00,600
fill him with whiskey
and despair,

149
00:10:00,635 --> 00:10:01,851
send him to a lonely bridge,

150
00:10:01,886 --> 00:10:03,719
let him stand there
all by himself,

151
00:10:03,754 --> 00:10:05,605
looking down
at the black water,

152
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,856
and try to imagine the thoughts

153
00:10:06,891 --> 00:10:08,724
that are in his mind.

154
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:11,861
You can't, i can't...
but there's someone who can,

155
00:10:11,896 --> 00:10:15,615
and that someone is seated next
to douglas winter right now.

156
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:18,117
The car is headed
back toward town,

157
00:10:18,152 --> 00:10:21,871
but its real destination
is the twilight zone.

158
00:10:52,601 --> 00:10:54,487
Thank you very much.

159
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:56,989
Young man,

160
00:10:57,024 --> 00:11:00,109
i hope you're
not planning
to drink alone.

161
00:11:00,144 --> 00:11:01,360
I was...

162
00:11:01,395 --> 00:11:03,863
unless, of course,
you'd like to join me.

163
00:11:03,898 --> 00:11:05,748
I'd be delighted.

164
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,764
Well...

165
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:24,884
feeling better?

166
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:25,518
Not yet.

167
00:11:25,553 --> 00:11:26,769
Hi, mr. Winter.

168
00:11:26,804 --> 00:11:28,637
Oh, hi, molly.

169
00:11:28,672 --> 00:11:30,523
Give me a martini,
will you?

170
00:11:30,558 --> 00:11:31,774
Make it a double.
The same.

171
00:11:31,809 --> 00:11:34,894
Uh, mr. Winter,
could i see you for a second?

172
00:11:36,145 --> 00:11:36,779
What about?

173
00:11:36,814 --> 00:11:38,647
Well, um...

174
00:11:38,682 --> 00:11:40,533
oh, yes.

175
00:11:40,568 --> 00:11:42,401
Yes, the tab.

176
00:11:42,436 --> 00:11:46,789
I'm sorry, but mr. Foster says
that from now on,

177
00:11:46,824 --> 00:11:48,040
it's got to be cash.

178
00:11:48,075 --> 00:11:50,543
Please, allow me.

179
00:11:50,578 --> 00:11:54,296
Now, molly, run and get
those drinks, will you?

180
00:11:54,331 --> 00:11:56,799
And tell mr. Foster
to make them strong.

181
00:11:56,834 --> 00:11:58,050
Will you do that?

182
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:01,170
Run, girl, run.

183
00:12:01,205 --> 00:12:02,421
Mm!

184
00:12:02,456 --> 00:12:04,306
That's a lush
one, isn't it?

185
00:12:04,341 --> 00:12:06,809
Full of fire,
too, i'll wager.

186
00:12:06,844 --> 00:12:07,426
I wouldn't know.

187
00:12:07,461 --> 00:12:09,311
You wouldn't? Pity.

188
00:12:09,346 --> 00:12:11,180
Uh, thank you very much
for the drink, mister, uh...

189
00:12:11,215 --> 00:12:12,431
smith.

190
00:12:12,466 --> 00:12:14,934
Um, my name
is douglas winter.

191
00:12:14,969 --> 00:12:16,819
Thedouglas winter,
the editor?

192
00:12:16,854 --> 00:12:19,321
Ex-editor.

193
00:12:19,356 --> 00:12:20,573
Wait, why "ex"?

194
00:12:20,608 --> 00:12:23,576
It's a long, sad story,
mr. Smith.

195
00:12:23,611 --> 00:12:25,444
You wouldn't be interested.

196
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:28,697
Oh, but i would.
I would indeed.

197
00:12:28,732 --> 00:12:32,451
You see, you are the reason
that i've journeyed to dansburg.

198
00:12:32,486 --> 00:12:34,453
You must be a creditor.

199
00:12:35,739 --> 00:12:37,590
No, not yet,
anyhow.

200
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:39,592
No, the fact is,
i'm a newspaperman.

201
00:12:39,627 --> 00:12:43,345
I was hoping to secure
a position with your paper.

202
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,213
I'm sorry.

203
00:12:44,248 --> 00:12:46,715
If you'd have called,
i'd save you a trip.

204
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:47,600
Why?

205
00:12:48,217 --> 00:12:50,102
Thecourieris dead,
mr. Smith.

206
00:12:50,137 --> 00:12:51,353
L-l-i don't
understand.

207
00:12:51,388 --> 00:12:53,222
There's not much
to understand.

208
00:12:53,257 --> 00:12:54,473
The bragg syndicate
opened a paper here

209
00:12:54,508 --> 00:12:58,861
called thegazette,
and they murdered us.

210
00:12:58,896 --> 00:13:01,363
Ah, i see.

211
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:11,240
No, uh, keep it,
my dear,

212
00:13:11,275 --> 00:13:13,742
in payment
for your lovely smile.

213
00:13:13,777 --> 00:13:14,994
Thank you, sir.

214
00:13:16,245 --> 00:13:18,747
She moves fast
for a big one.

215
00:13:18,782 --> 00:13:21,383
Mr. Winter...

216
00:13:21,418 --> 00:13:23,252
do you suppose
thegazettecould use

217
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,754
a good linotype operator?

218
00:13:25,789 --> 00:13:27,506
I doubt it.

219
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:30,009
They just grabbed
my best man today.

220
00:13:30,044 --> 00:13:31,260
Why?

221
00:13:31,295 --> 00:13:34,013
That's my specialty,
along with the reporting.

222
00:13:34,048 --> 00:13:36,515
You mean you're a reporter
and a linotype operator?

223
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,767
Absolutely.

224
00:13:38,802 --> 00:13:41,270
If i may dispense
with false modesty,

225
00:13:41,305 --> 00:13:43,772
i'd count myself
among the best in both fields.

226
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,024
Perhapsthebest.

227
00:13:46,775 --> 00:13:49,278
You were about
to say something.

228
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,032
Well, then
i'll say it.

229
00:13:53,067 --> 00:13:54,917
You put me to
work at once,

230
00:13:54,952 --> 00:13:58,037
ithinkwe can
save thecourier.

231
00:13:58,072 --> 00:13:59,922
How can i put you
to work?

232
00:13:59,957 --> 00:14:01,790
I can't even pay
my bar tab.

233
00:14:01,825 --> 00:14:03,042
Well, that's simple.

234
00:14:03,077 --> 00:14:04,927
I'll waive salary until
you're in the black.

235
00:14:04,962 --> 00:14:06,178
That's crazy.

236
00:14:06,213 --> 00:14:07,429
I might never be
in the black.

237
00:14:07,464 --> 00:14:09,932
Well, it's a chance,
but it's better

238
00:14:09,967 --> 00:14:11,183
than anything
you have now.

239
00:14:11,218 --> 00:14:14,687
Are you sure you know how
to operate a linotype machine?

240
00:14:14,722 --> 00:14:17,439
Mr. Winter,
that's like asking paganini

241
00:14:17,474 --> 00:14:18,691
if he can play the fiddle.

242
00:14:18,726 --> 00:14:19,942
I'm a virtuoso.

243
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:24,947
Show me.

244
00:14:24,982 --> 00:14:26,815
With pleasure.

245
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:29,318
Good night, molly.

246
00:14:29,353 --> 00:14:31,820
Good night, mr. Winter.

247
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,218
Doug!

248
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:48,721
Jackie.

249
00:14:48,756 --> 00:14:49,972
Doug, where have you been?

250
00:14:50,007 --> 00:14:51,223
I've been calling your home

251
00:14:51,258 --> 00:14:53,092
all eve... ning...

252
00:14:53,127 --> 00:14:54,343
oh, uh, jackie,

253
00:14:54,378 --> 00:14:56,228
i'd like you to
meet mr. Smith.

254
00:14:56,845 --> 00:14:57,479
Uh, this is
miss benson,

255
00:14:57,514 --> 00:14:59,348
my most valuable
employee.

256
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:01,850
Secondmost valuable,
mr. Winter.

257
00:15:01,885 --> 00:15:03,736
Secondmost valuable.

258
00:15:03,771 --> 00:15:04,987
Very good,
mr. Smith.

259
00:15:05,022 --> 00:15:07,489
Let's see how
long it takes you

260
00:15:07,524 --> 00:15:09,358
to copy this
lead story.

261
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:10,609
Right over there.

262
00:15:10,644 --> 00:15:12,494
Certainly.

263
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,614
Who is he, anyway?

264
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:17,499
I don't know.

265
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:24,373
Well, it's not the latest model,
but it's agoodone.

266
00:15:24,408 --> 00:15:25,624
Now...

267
00:15:25,659 --> 00:15:28,761
ah! Listen to it hum.

268
00:15:28,796 --> 00:15:31,880
Kindly hold
that cigar for me.

269
00:15:31,915 --> 00:15:34,383
Keep it burning.

270
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,640
Well, if he doesn't play
chopin'spolonaise,

271
00:15:41,675 --> 00:15:42,891
i'll be disappointed.

272
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:08,050
May i have my cigar back?

273
00:16:08,085 --> 00:16:09,551
Oh... yes.

274
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:13,422
Put it in my mouth, please.

275
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:23,065
I may have to make
a few modifications,

276
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:26,185
but on the whole,
it's infinecondition.

277
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:29,321
A little stiff, perhaps.

278
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:38,197
What's the matter?

279
00:16:38,232 --> 00:16:39,448
Matter?

280
00:16:39,483 --> 00:16:40,699
Why did you quit?

281
00:16:40,734 --> 00:16:41,333
Finished.

282
00:16:41,368 --> 00:16:42,584
That's impossible!

283
00:16:42,619 --> 00:16:45,087
See for yourself.

284
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:55,347
Mr. Smith...
why would a man with your talent

285
00:16:55,382 --> 00:16:57,216
want to work for a hick paper
like thecourier?

286
00:16:57,251 --> 00:16:59,718
Call it a challenge.

287
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,857
Well, miss benson,
are you impressed?

288
00:17:05,474 --> 00:17:06,725
No. I'm amazed.

289
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,610
It's understandable.

290
00:17:08,645 --> 00:17:11,113
Well, i must confess

291
00:17:11,148 --> 00:17:12,981
that this is not
my true vocation.

292
00:17:13,016 --> 00:17:13,615
It isn't?

293
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:15,484
No. I'm a reporter.

294
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,985
Oh.

295
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:20,122
Some people have a green thumb.
I have a green nose.

296
00:17:20,157 --> 00:17:23,876
Wherever there is news,
this old nose smells it.

297
00:17:23,911 --> 00:17:26,128
I'm afraid there isn't
much news to smell

298
00:17:26,163 --> 00:17:27,379
around dansburg,
mr. Smith.

299
00:17:27,414 --> 00:17:29,248
There will be.

300
00:17:29,283 --> 00:17:31,133
Well, am i hired?

301
00:17:31,168 --> 00:17:33,635
You would be,
if i had a paper.

302
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:34,887
But i haven't got one,

303
00:17:35,504 --> 00:17:37,389
and there's no use
kidding myself.

304
00:17:37,424 --> 00:17:39,892
This all belongs
to the banks

305
00:17:39,927 --> 00:17:41,143
and the finance companies,

306
00:17:41,178 --> 00:17:44,263
and they're ready
to collect.

307
00:17:44,298 --> 00:17:48,016
Aw. How much would
it take to pay them off?

308
00:17:48,051 --> 00:17:53,021
Oh, roughly $4,861.23.

309
00:17:53,056 --> 00:17:57,409
Oh... i might be able
to manage that.

310
00:18:01,029 --> 00:18:02,281
Uh...

311
00:18:02,316 --> 00:18:04,783
you want to
make us a loan?

312
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:06,919
Perhaps.

313
00:18:06,954 --> 00:18:09,922
Would you excuse us
for a minute, please?

314
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:13,041
What do you think?

315
00:18:13,076 --> 00:18:15,043
Well, if he'd made
that offer ten minutes ago,

316
00:18:15,078 --> 00:18:16,929
i'd have thought
he was kidding or crazy,

317
00:18:16,964 --> 00:18:18,797
but now l-i don't know.

318
00:18:18,832 --> 00:18:21,300
I mean, what's in it
for him?

319
00:18:21,335 --> 00:18:23,185
Beats me.

320
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,053
But i'm going
to give it a go.

321
00:18:25,088 --> 00:18:26,305
Yeah, but there's
something...

322
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,190
it's a chance to
stay in business!

323
00:18:28,225 --> 00:18:30,692
After all, what
have i got to lose?

324
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:33,562
That's right.

325
00:18:33,597 --> 00:18:36,698
What have you got to lose?

326
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:44,740
Gives you a funny feeling,
doesn't it?

327
00:18:44,775 --> 00:18:46,625
"Paid in full."
"Paid in full."

328
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:47,242
Who but that old rooster

329
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:50,379
would carry $5,000 cash
around in his pocket?

330
00:18:51,665 --> 00:18:53,499
Well, speak
of the devil.

331
00:18:53,534 --> 00:18:55,384
Excuse the interruption,

332
00:18:55,419 --> 00:18:56,635
but how long
would it take you

333
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:58,504
to get an edition
onto the streets?

334
00:18:58,539 --> 00:18:59,755
We're not due out
until 4:00.

335
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:01,640
I mean, an
extraedition.

336
00:19:01,675 --> 00:19:03,509
A couple of hours
on a short run.

337
00:19:03,544 --> 00:19:04,760
Be a hassle, though.

338
00:19:04,795 --> 00:19:06,011
Would it be
worth the hassle

339
00:19:06,046 --> 00:19:08,514
if you could beat the
gazetteto a scoop?

340
00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:09,148
Depends on the scoop.

341
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:11,016
Here.

342
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:18,157
Holy...

343
00:19:18,809 --> 00:19:20,659
10:20?

344
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,029
Well, that was
only a half an hour ago!

345
00:19:24,064 --> 00:19:24,663
I'll check it out.

346
00:19:24,698 --> 00:19:26,532
You doubt my
veracity, hmm?

347
00:19:26,567 --> 00:19:29,034
It's standard operating
procedure, mr. Smith.

348
00:19:29,069 --> 00:19:31,537
You ought
to know that.

349
00:19:31,572 --> 00:19:34,039
Uh, let me speak
to mr. Underwood, please.

350
00:19:34,074 --> 00:19:35,924
Well, never mind.
Maybe you can help me.

351
00:19:35,959 --> 00:19:38,427
We just had a report
of a robbery...

352
00:19:38,462 --> 00:19:40,929
thank you.
Okay, let's go to work!

353
00:19:40,964 --> 00:19:41,547
Yes, sir.

354
00:19:41,582 --> 00:19:45,300
I told you
i had a nose for news!

355
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,062
Hey, extra!
Big bank robbery today!

356
00:19:57,097 --> 00:19:58,947
Extra! Read all about it!

357
00:19:58,982 --> 00:19:59,565

There you are, sir.

368
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:22,087
Follow me.

369
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:39,238
I don't believe it.

370
00:20:39,273 --> 00:20:40,489
I'll check it.

371
00:20:40,524 --> 00:20:42,357
I don't think
she trusts me.

372
00:20:42,392 --> 00:20:43,609
Of course, it
isn't much,

373
00:20:43,644 --> 00:20:44,860
but it sells papers.

374
00:20:44,895 --> 00:20:46,745
How did
you find this out?
Hmm?

375
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:47,996
How did you find
this out?!

376
00:20:48,031 --> 00:20:49,865
I told you i had
a nose for news.

377
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,750
You like it,
don't you?

378
00:20:51,785 --> 00:20:56,121
Mr. Smith, i can't think
of anything i like better.

379
00:20:56,156 --> 00:20:58,624
Harold j. Swanson!

380
00:20:58,659 --> 00:20:59,875
"...for 13 years,

381
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:01,760
"principal
of dansburg
high school

382
00:21:01,795 --> 00:21:03,011
"confessed to
police today

383
00:21:03,046 --> 00:21:04,263
"that he is married
to two women

384
00:21:04,298 --> 00:21:06,131
and is a bigamist."

385
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:08,634
I just talked to mr. Swanson.

386
00:21:08,669 --> 00:21:09,885
And?

387
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,136
It's true!

388
00:21:11,171 --> 00:21:13,639
He has two wives.

389
00:21:13,674 --> 00:21:16,775
High school principal
exposed as bigamist!

390
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:18,644
Hey, late paper's out!

391
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:19,895
Read all about it!

392
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,903
Subscriptions!

393
00:21:27,938 --> 00:21:29,154
You're kidding.

394
00:21:29,189 --> 00:21:29,788
I amnotkidding.

395
00:21:29,823 --> 00:21:31,039
Do you realize
that in two weeks,

396
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:32,908
our circulation
has tripled?

397
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,410
Beautiful!

398
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:39,164
Well, well, well,
mr. Franklin.

399
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,049
How are things
at thegazette?

400
00:21:41,084 --> 00:21:42,918
That's exactly why
i'm here, mr. Winter.

401
00:21:42,953 --> 00:21:45,420
Miss benson.

402
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:49,675
I'm not a man
to beat around the bush,

403
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:50,926
but you're giving us trouble.

404
00:21:50,961 --> 00:21:52,177
Now, this
quick success

405
00:21:52,212 --> 00:21:54,062
that you've had
just can't last.

406
00:21:54,097 --> 00:21:55,814
You've had a few lucky breaks.
That's all.

407
00:21:55,849 --> 00:21:57,683
But i'll admit, we're hurting.

408
00:21:58,934 --> 00:22:00,819
How does it feel, mr. Franklin?

409
00:22:00,854 --> 00:22:03,322
I'm authorized
to make you an offer,

410
00:22:03,357 --> 00:22:04,573
and if you're
a smart young man-

411
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:07,075
i understand that you are-
you'll take it.

412
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:08,944
An offer for what?

413
00:22:08,979 --> 00:22:10,195
Thecourier.

414
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:13,081
We buy it; you and your staff
go to work for us.

415
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:15,083
Now, how does
that sound?

416
00:22:15,118 --> 00:22:18,704
Sorry. Thecourier
isn't for sale.

417
00:22:18,739 --> 00:22:20,088
Not at any price?

418
00:22:20,123 --> 00:22:21,590
Not at any price.

419
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:24,710
Now, you certainly don't think
that you can fight us, do you?

420
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,712
Oh, we can try, mr. Franklin.

421
00:22:26,747 --> 00:22:28,597
Well, then you're not quite
as smart a young man

422
00:22:28,632 --> 00:22:29,848
as i thought you were.

423
00:22:29,883 --> 00:22:32,351
But i will leave that offer open
until 7:00 tonight.

424
00:22:32,386 --> 00:22:34,720
If i don't hear from
you by that time,

425
00:22:34,755 --> 00:22:35,971
you better lay
in yourself

426
00:22:36,006 --> 00:22:37,856
a good supply
of tin cups.

427
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:52,237
Thank you.

428
00:22:52,272 --> 00:22:54,740
How much do you think
he'd give you?

429
00:22:54,775 --> 00:22:55,991
Well, if they're
as worried as
franklin looks,

430
00:22:56,026 --> 00:22:57,876
i imagine around
$100,000. why?

431
00:22:57,911 --> 00:22:59,745
I was just wondering.

432
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,630
Honey, what's
the matter?

433
00:23:01,665 --> 00:23:02,881
Things have never gone
better, have they?

434
00:23:02,916 --> 00:23:04,750
I'm not so sure.

435
00:23:04,785 --> 00:23:05,384
Here we are.

436
00:23:05,419 --> 00:23:06,635
Oh, hi, mr. Smith.

437
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:08,503
I have
a little surprise for you.

438
00:23:08,538 --> 00:23:10,389
I don't think
i can take another one.

439
00:23:10,424 --> 00:23:12,257
You'll take this,
all right.

440
00:23:12,292 --> 00:23:14,142
Happens to be
the biggest scoop of them all.

441
00:23:14,177 --> 00:23:16,011
You read it, and
i'll get things going.

442
00:23:16,046 --> 00:23:17,896
Almost afraid to look.

443
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:39,534
Twilight zonewill continue
after station identification.

444
00:23:53,548 --> 00:23:55,434
Look, i don't blame you
of being upset,

445
00:23:55,469 --> 00:23:57,302
but that gives you no reason
to toss allegations around!

446
00:23:57,337 --> 00:23:58,553
Allegations? Facts.

447
00:23:58,588 --> 00:24:00,439
Now, you started that fire,
and you're going to pay for it.

448
00:24:00,474 --> 00:24:01,690
I told you a thousand
times, i didn't
start the fire!

449
00:24:01,725 --> 00:24:02,941
Now, how many times
do i have to tell you?

450
00:24:02,976 --> 00:24:04,810
I don't care how many times
you tell me.

451
00:24:04,845 --> 00:24:06,061
Your newspapers were
out on that street

452
00:24:06,096 --> 00:24:07,946
exactly one half hour
after it happened,

453
00:24:07,981 --> 00:24:09,197
and to me, that means
only one thing:

454
00:24:09,232 --> 00:24:10,449
That youknew
it was going to happen.

455
00:24:10,484 --> 00:24:12,818
All right, i'll
explain it to you
one more time.

456
00:24:12,853 --> 00:24:14,069
Our new man
was walking by
your building,

457
00:24:14,104 --> 00:24:15,320
and he saw the smoke,
and he came in...

458
00:24:15,355 --> 00:24:16,571
yeah, and then back here,

459
00:24:16,606 --> 00:24:18,457
and in one half hour,
he wrote the complete story,

460
00:24:18,492 --> 00:24:19,708
ran off 5,000 copies

461
00:24:19,743 --> 00:24:20,959
on that dilapidated equipment
of yours,

462
00:24:20,994 --> 00:24:22,828
delivered it
to the corner newsboy,

463
00:24:22,863 --> 00:24:23,462
and you expect me
to believe that?

464
00:24:23,497 --> 00:24:25,330
Now, what kind
of a stupid idiot

465
00:24:25,365 --> 00:24:25,964
do you think i am?

466
00:24:25,999 --> 00:24:28,467
Well, let's not get
into that, shall we?

467
00:24:29,084 --> 00:24:30,335
It just so happens
i have witnesses

468
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:32,838
as to my whereabouts
for the whole day.

469
00:24:32,873 --> 00:24:34,089
Now, will you
get out of here?

470
00:24:34,124 --> 00:24:36,591
We have a lot
of work to do.

471
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:38,477
You haven't heard
the last of this.

472
00:24:46,101 --> 00:24:47,352
Doug?

473
00:24:47,387 --> 00:24:48,603
Yeah?

474
00:24:48,638 --> 00:24:51,740
Howdidwe hit on
the street so fast?

475
00:24:51,775 --> 00:24:52,991
I don't know.

476
00:24:53,026 --> 00:24:54,860
Well, do you
believe him?

477
00:24:54,895 --> 00:24:56,745
Who?
Mr. Smith!

478
00:24:56,780 --> 00:25:01,116
Do you believe
he justhappened
to be passing by?

479
00:25:16,131 --> 00:25:19,885
Well, boss, what
can i do for you?

480
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,136
Answer a question.

481
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:24,272
Did you start
thegazettefire?

482
00:25:24,307 --> 00:25:24,890
I?

483
00:25:24,925 --> 00:25:26,141
You.

484
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:28,643
I'm afraid i don't understand
the question.

485
00:25:28,678 --> 00:25:31,780
I don't see why not.
It's very simple.

486
00:25:31,815 --> 00:25:33,031
Did you start thegazettefire?

487
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:35,901
It was started
by a faulty electrical system.

488
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,036
Are you sure?

489
00:25:38,071 --> 00:25:40,906
I never write up anything
i'm not sure of.

490
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,543
It's a question
of ethics.

491
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:52,050
Oh, by the way...

492
00:25:52,085 --> 00:25:54,553
andy praskins called.

493
00:25:54,588 --> 00:25:56,421
He's the linotype
operator

494
00:25:56,456 --> 00:25:57,672
i told you about.

495
00:25:57,707 --> 00:26:01,676
I think i'll hire him back and
put you on full-time reporting.

496
00:26:01,711 --> 00:26:03,562
No, no, no,
that wouldn't do.

497
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:06,314
Now, i've made certain, uh,
modifications to this machine.

498
00:26:06,349 --> 00:26:08,183
I wouldn't want
anybody else to touch it.

499
00:26:08,218 --> 00:26:10,068
Would spoil everything.

500
00:26:10,103 --> 00:26:11,937
Besides, it breaks up
the day for me.

501
00:26:11,972 --> 00:26:15,073
You can hire him back,
by all means, but, uh,

502
00:26:15,108 --> 00:26:16,942
give him another job.

503
00:26:16,977 --> 00:26:18,827
I insist.

504
00:26:21,696 --> 00:26:23,198
Okay.

505
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:39,347
Hey, come on, now,
you still haven't told me.

506
00:26:39,382 --> 00:26:41,216
Exactly how did you meet
mr. Smith?

507
00:26:41,251 --> 00:26:42,467
Oh, brother.

508
00:26:42,502 --> 00:26:43,718
You don't give up
very easy, do you?

509
00:26:43,753 --> 00:26:44,970
Well, i want to know.

510
00:26:45,005 --> 00:26:48,106
I told you, i
just ran into
him that night.

511
00:26:48,141 --> 00:26:49,357
That's all.

512
00:26:49,392 --> 00:26:50,609
Where?

513
00:26:50,644 --> 00:26:52,477
Pine trail.

514
00:26:52,512 --> 00:26:54,362
What were you doing there?

515
00:26:54,397 --> 00:26:55,614
Shooting butterflies.

516
00:26:55,649 --> 00:26:56,865
What else would
i be doing there?

517
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:59,367
Well, you don't
have to get so
sarcastic about it.

518
00:26:59,402 --> 00:27:00,619
I was only asking.

519
00:27:00,654 --> 00:27:01,870
Well, i told you.

520
00:27:01,905 --> 00:27:03,738
I just met him...

521
00:27:03,773 --> 00:27:05,624
and i hired him,
and he put us back in business.

522
00:27:06,241 --> 00:27:07,492
What's wrong with that?

523
00:27:07,527 --> 00:27:09,494
I smell trouble.

524
00:27:09,529 --> 00:27:10,378
Trouble?

525
00:27:10,413 --> 00:27:13,498
We just picked up
1,500 new subscriptions.

526
00:27:13,533 --> 00:27:14,749
We're selling out every day.

527
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:17,252
I've been dreaming about that
kind of trouble all my life.

528
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:20,889
Hey, what's the matter
with you?

529
00:27:20,924 --> 00:27:22,140
There's nothing
the matter.

530
00:27:22,175 --> 00:27:23,391
Yes, there is.

531
00:27:23,426 --> 00:27:24,643
You're different.
You've changed.

532
00:27:24,678 --> 00:27:25,894
"You're different.
You've changed."

533
00:27:25,929 --> 00:27:27,145
You're beginning to
sound like a wife!

534
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:30,899
Well, i'm not your wife, and
i never will be, at this rate.

535
00:27:30,934 --> 00:27:32,767
Well, that's okay with me, too.

536
00:27:47,532 --> 00:27:50,035
Mr. Smith?

537
00:27:53,206 --> 00:27:55,040
What's on
the machine?

538
00:27:55,075 --> 00:27:58,176
I was hoping to surprise you
with it later.

539
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:07,552
"E.j. Macleod
wins $250,000 on
sweepstakes ticket."

540
00:28:08,221 --> 00:28:10,055
"Macleod, for 16 years

541
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:13,191
clerk at the dansburg
water and power comp..."

542
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:40,468
uh, mr. Macleod?

543
00:28:40,503 --> 00:28:42,971
This is doug winter
down at thecourier.

544
00:28:43,006 --> 00:28:44,839
I'm sorry to disturb you.

545
00:28:44,874 --> 00:28:46,725
I was just wondering,
have you heard anything

546
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,593
on your sweepstakes ticket?

547
00:28:48,628 --> 00:28:49,844
I see.

548
00:28:49,879 --> 00:28:53,598
Oh, no, no, sir,
l-i haven't heard a thing.

549
00:28:53,633 --> 00:28:56,101
Sorry to bother you.
Right. Good night.

550
00:28:57,352 --> 00:28:58,603
Mm?

551
00:28:58,638 --> 00:29:00,488
I hate to tell you...

552
00:29:00,523 --> 00:29:02,357
but i'm afraid this time,
you pulled a boner.

553
00:29:02,392 --> 00:29:04,859
Macleod doesn't know
anything about it.

554
00:29:04,894 --> 00:29:06,111
I didn't say he knew
anything about it.

555
00:29:06,146 --> 00:29:07,996
I said hewonit.

556
00:29:08,031 --> 00:29:08,613
What are you talking about?

557
00:29:08,648 --> 00:29:11,750
How can you win $250,000
and not know about it?

558
00:29:11,785 --> 00:29:14,252
By not bothering to
look under the door

559
00:29:14,869 --> 00:29:16,121
for a telegram.

560
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:24,012
Courier. Winter speaking.

561
00:29:31,636 --> 00:29:34,022
Congratulations.

562
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:40,895
You see?

563
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:43,398
Now, boss, would you have
a chair, please?

564
00:29:43,433 --> 00:29:46,534
I think that the, uh...

565
00:29:46,569 --> 00:29:47,786
time has come when you
and i should have

566
00:29:47,821 --> 00:29:51,539
a little chat, hmm?

567
00:29:51,574 --> 00:29:53,408
I think the occasion
calls for a touch

568
00:29:53,443 --> 00:29:55,910
of "the creature,"
if i may say so.

569
00:29:55,945 --> 00:29:57,796
Sorry. I'm fresh out.

570
00:29:57,831 --> 00:29:59,047
I think you'll find
you're mistaken.

571
00:29:59,082 --> 00:30:01,549
Right there
in that top drawer, hmm?

572
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,921
With my compliments.

573
00:30:09,424 --> 00:30:11,309
You think of everything,
don't you?

574
00:30:11,344 --> 00:30:13,812
Now, first of all...

575
00:30:13,847 --> 00:30:15,680
i should like to ask

576
00:30:15,715 --> 00:30:17,565
whether or not
you are happy

577
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,685
with the way things
have been going.

578
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,822
Just what are
you leading up to, mr. Smith?

579
00:30:23,857 --> 00:30:26,324
A simple
proposition.

580
00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:30,695
I hereby guarantee-

581
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:31,946
you understand-
guarantee-

582
00:30:31,981 --> 00:30:33,198
that you will become

583
00:30:33,233 --> 00:30:35,083
the most successful
newspaper editor

584
00:30:35,118 --> 00:30:36,951
in the world, if...

585
00:30:36,986 --> 00:30:39,454
you will affix
your signature

586
00:30:39,489 --> 00:30:41,339
to this little
document.

587
00:30:44,459 --> 00:30:47,595
"I, douglas winter,
agree to relinquish

588
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:51,349
"my immortal soul
to the bearer upon my death

589
00:30:51,966 --> 00:30:54,469
in exchange
for his services."

590
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:00,975
"I, d..."

591
00:31:02,262 --> 00:31:03,478
what?

592
00:31:04,764 --> 00:31:06,614
Huh?

593
00:31:06,649 --> 00:31:07,866
You're the devil!

594
00:31:07,982 --> 00:31:10,485
Oh, mr. Winter.

595
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,736
As a sophisticated,

596
00:31:11,771 --> 00:31:12,987
intelligent
20th-century man,

597
00:31:13,022 --> 00:31:16,124
youknowthat
the devil does
not exist. True?

598
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:17,375
True.

599
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:18,626
But you also know

600
00:31:18,661 --> 00:31:19,878
that the world
is full

601
00:31:19,913 --> 00:31:22,380
of eccentric,
rich old men-

602
00:31:22,415 --> 00:31:24,883
crazy old men doing
all kinds of things

603
00:31:24,918 --> 00:31:26,134
for crazy reasons.

604
00:31:26,169 --> 00:31:29,254
Now, why don't you
think of me like that?

605
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,139
Here's a pen.

606
00:31:31,174 --> 00:31:33,641
This is ridiculous!

607
00:31:33,676 --> 00:31:34,893
Yes, isn't it?

608
00:31:34,928 --> 00:31:36,144
Could i, uh...

609
00:31:36,179 --> 00:31:38,646
trouble you for
another drink?

610
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,903
Uh, you don't
really believe

611
00:31:44,938 --> 00:31:47,405
that i'm the
devil, do you?

612
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:50,525
No.

613
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,410
Well, then, why don't
you put it this way:

614
00:31:52,445 --> 00:31:54,279
You're humoring me.

615
00:31:54,314 --> 00:31:56,531
After all, what good
is the soul, anyway?

616
00:31:57,031 --> 00:31:58,917
It's sort of like an appendix
these days,

617
00:31:58,952 --> 00:32:02,670
particularly since it doesn't
exist in the first place.

618
00:32:02,705 --> 00:32:05,673
Well, just for the sake
of argument,

619
00:32:05,708 --> 00:32:08,176
why do you
particularly want mine?

620
00:32:08,211 --> 00:32:10,295
Well, for the sake of argument,

621
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:12,797
let's say i'm something
of a connoisseur,

622
00:32:12,832 --> 00:32:14,682
and you have a very choice soul,

623
00:32:14,717 --> 00:32:17,802
and as the vintners say,
it's a good year.

624
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,054
Well, then
again, uh,

625
00:32:20,089 --> 00:32:21,306
just for sake
of argument...

626
00:32:21,341 --> 00:32:22,557
yes?

627
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:25,693
Why don't you
just take it, huh?

628
00:32:25,728 --> 00:32:26,945
Now, if you're
the devil

629
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,196
as you say you are,

630
00:32:28,231 --> 00:32:30,064
why, you can
do everything.

631
00:32:30,099 --> 00:32:31,950
No, unhappily,
not everything.

632
00:32:31,985 --> 00:32:34,452
I am bound
by certain rules,

633
00:32:34,487 --> 00:32:36,955
and i do have
my limitations.

634
00:32:38,241 --> 00:32:40,074
You're nuts.

635
00:32:40,109 --> 00:32:41,326
Yes.

636
00:32:41,361 --> 00:32:43,211
Let's drink to that, huh?

637
00:32:43,246 --> 00:32:44,462
Here you are.

638
00:32:44,497 --> 00:32:46,965
I think i should
warn you, however,

639
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,833
that if you do not
sign this,

640
00:32:48,868 --> 00:32:51,336
then the certain
gloomy predictions you made

641
00:32:51,371 --> 00:32:54,472
about thecourier'sfuture
will certainly come to pass.

642
00:32:54,507 --> 00:32:56,341
Yes, i'll have
to resign, and...

643
00:32:56,376 --> 00:33:00,094
well, let's not even consider
such a proposition.

644
00:33:00,129 --> 00:33:01,346
After all, you don't want
to go visiting

645
00:33:01,381 --> 00:33:03,231
that bridge again,
do you?

646
00:33:03,848 --> 00:33:05,099
Hardly.

647
00:33:05,134 --> 00:33:07,602
No. Yeah.

648
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:11,356
Now...

649
00:33:11,391 --> 00:33:13,241
why not humor
an old man?

650
00:33:13,276 --> 00:33:15,743
It'll mean
such a lot to me.

651
00:33:15,778 --> 00:33:18,246
And if you don't
sign it,

652
00:33:18,281 --> 00:33:21,366
it would be admitting
fear and belief.

653
00:33:21,401 --> 00:33:22,617
You're not afraid,
are you?

654
00:33:23,868 --> 00:33:25,753
No.

655
00:33:40,635 --> 00:33:42,270
Fancy that!

656
00:33:42,305 --> 00:33:45,390
A grown-up man who believes
in the devil!

657
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:48,776
Give me that
stupid thing!

658
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:55,650
There.

659
00:33:55,685 --> 00:33:58,152
Now, let's not hear
any more about this, shall we?

660
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:35,690
Good morning, miss benson.

661
00:34:35,725 --> 00:34:38,693
Good morning, mr. Smith.

662
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,449
Doug?

663
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:46,951
Doug, wake up.

664
00:34:46,986 --> 00:34:48,202
Hmm?
Wake up!

665
00:34:48,237 --> 00:34:50,088
Hmm? Oh.

666
00:34:50,123 --> 00:34:51,956
What, you sleep
here last night?

667
00:34:51,991 --> 00:34:52,590
What happened?

668
00:34:52,625 --> 00:34:54,459
Here, have
some coffee.

669
00:34:54,494 --> 00:34:57,595
Oh. Yeah, i worked late
last night.

670
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:59,464
Guess i fell asleep.

671
00:34:59,499 --> 00:35:00,715
Thanks.

672
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:02,600
Have you seen this?

673
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:05,720
Ah. What?

674
00:35:08,973 --> 00:35:10,475
Oh, no!

675
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,360
Doug, what
is going on?

676
00:35:12,395 --> 00:35:13,611
What is the matter?

677
00:35:13,646 --> 00:35:15,480
Why, these papers
were on the newsstand

678
00:35:15,515 --> 00:35:17,365
less than an hour
after it happened.

679
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,616
Who ran them off?

680
00:35:18,651 --> 00:35:19,867
Who delivered them?

681
00:35:19,902 --> 00:35:21,736
Ask mr. Smith.

682
00:35:21,771 --> 00:35:22,987
I'm askingyou.

683
00:35:23,022 --> 00:35:26,124
Leave me alone,
will you?!

684
00:35:43,257 --> 00:35:46,394
Lovely dress you're
wearing, miss benson.

685
00:35:46,429 --> 00:35:47,645
What do you want?

686
00:35:48,262 --> 00:35:50,765
A bit of fire, hmm?

687
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:55,770
Ah, yes.

688
00:35:58,272 --> 00:36:00,158
Hmm?

689
00:36:00,193 --> 00:36:01,409
Keep them.

690
00:36:01,444 --> 00:36:03,277
Thank you.

691
00:36:03,312 --> 00:36:07,665
You and i are
going to be great
friends, my dear.

692
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:32,940
Extra, extra!

693
00:36:32,975 --> 00:36:34,192
Honeymooners drown
in lake bundy!

694
00:36:34,227 --> 00:36:35,443
Read all about it!

695
00:36:35,478 --> 00:36:37,311
Thank you, sir.
Extra, extra!

696
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:49,824
Extra! Banker murders wife!

697
00:36:49,859 --> 00:36:52,326
Read all about it! Extra!

698
00:36:52,361 --> 00:36:54,212
Get your late papers here!

699
00:36:54,247 --> 00:36:56,080
Doug, i'm scared!

700
00:36:56,115 --> 00:36:58,583
These things
just can't be happening!

701
00:36:58,618 --> 00:36:59,834
You've got to fire him.

702
00:36:59,869 --> 00:37:01,085
I can't.

703
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,336
Why not?

704
00:37:02,371 --> 00:37:02,970
You paid back
the loan.

705
00:37:03,005 --> 00:37:04,222
You don't owe
him a thing.

706
00:37:04,257 --> 00:37:06,090
I know, i know,
but i can't, that's all!

707
00:37:06,125 --> 00:37:07,341
Now, believe me,
i can't!

708
00:37:07,376 --> 00:37:08,593
Why? Just kick him out!

709
00:37:08,628 --> 00:37:09,844
On what grounds?

710
00:37:09,879 --> 00:37:11,095
I don't know-
incompetence.

711
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:12,346
Oh, come on,
now, you know

712
00:37:12,381 --> 00:37:13,598
he's a very competent
linotype operator

713
00:37:13,633 --> 00:37:14,849
and a great reporter.

714
00:37:14,884 --> 00:37:16,734
Do you want him
around?

715
00:37:16,769 --> 00:37:17,985
It isn't a question of
wanting him around...

716
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:18,603
then what is it?!

717
00:37:18,638 --> 00:37:20,488
He'srunning the newspaper now.

718
00:37:20,523 --> 00:37:21,739
Not you, him!

719
00:37:21,774 --> 00:37:23,357
He's doing a pretty
good job of it,
too, isn't he?

720
00:37:23,392 --> 00:37:24,609
We're selling out
every edition!

721
00:37:24,644 --> 00:37:27,361
Oh, you're selling out
more than that.

722
00:37:27,396 --> 00:37:28,613
A lot more.

723
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,368
Good-bye, doug.

724
00:37:38,122 --> 00:37:40,007
Jackie?

725
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:46,881
Aren't you being
a little hasty?

726
00:37:46,916 --> 00:37:48,766
Would you mind
you own business?

727
00:37:48,801 --> 00:37:50,635
Thisismy business.

728
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:52,520
I have a
proprietary
interest

729
00:37:52,555 --> 00:37:54,388
in everything
connected with
thecourier.

730
00:37:54,423 --> 00:37:56,274
Well, i am
no longer connected

731
00:37:56,309 --> 00:37:57,525
with thecourier,
mr. Smith.

732
00:37:58,142 --> 00:37:59,393
Miss benson, i wish
you'd reconsider.

733
00:37:59,428 --> 00:38:00,645
The fact is,
i've developed

734
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,147
a very special
fondness for you.

735
00:38:03,182 --> 00:38:05,032
Will you please get
out of my way?

736
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:13,157
You'll besorry
you did that!

737
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,418
Where's jackie?

738
00:38:24,453 --> 00:38:26,304
Love's labor
lost, my friend.

739
00:38:26,339 --> 00:38:27,555
She's gone, vanished.

740
00:38:28,172 --> 00:38:29,423
But don't worry...

741
00:38:29,458 --> 00:38:31,309
we can do withouther.

742
00:38:41,936 --> 00:38:44,438
The person we can
do without isyou.

743
00:38:44,473 --> 00:38:46,941
That's an ungrateful thing
to say to a friend

744
00:38:46,976 --> 00:38:48,192
who pulled you
out of bankruptcy

745
00:38:48,227 --> 00:38:50,077
and turned thecourier

746
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:51,329
into the hottest journal
in the state!

747
00:38:51,364 --> 00:38:52,580
Well, let me tell you
something, mr. Smith.

748
00:38:53,197 --> 00:38:53,831
It's not worth it.

749
00:38:53,866 --> 00:38:56,200
I had a nightmare
about a weird little man

750
00:38:56,235 --> 00:38:59,337
with a crooked cigar who caused
terrible things to happen

751
00:38:59,372 --> 00:39:01,205
so he could get scoops
for my paper.

752
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:03,591
Well, i'm awake
now, and i want
you out of here!

753
00:39:03,626 --> 00:39:06,093
Not so fast!
What about our contract?

754
00:39:06,128 --> 00:39:06,711
What about
our contract?

755
00:39:06,746 --> 00:39:08,596
You said
you'd doanything

756
00:39:08,631 --> 00:39:09,847
to make your paper
a success.

757
00:39:09,882 --> 00:39:12,350
I heard you.
That's why i came.

758
00:39:12,385 --> 00:39:14,218
Well, i've carried out
my part.

759
00:39:14,253 --> 00:39:15,469
You are a success.

760
00:39:15,504 --> 00:39:17,972
If you're not a nightmare, then
you're something even worse,

761
00:39:18,007 --> 00:39:21,108
because somehow
you'vemadethese things happen.

762
00:39:21,143 --> 00:39:22,360
You've caused tragedy.

763
00:39:22,395 --> 00:39:24,228
You've destroyed life
and property.

764
00:39:24,263 --> 00:39:26,113
I didn't bargain for this!

765
00:39:26,148 --> 00:39:29,233
Oh, yes, you did,
but you put it out of your mind.

766
00:39:29,268 --> 00:39:31,118
You thought you'd get everything
for nothing.

767
00:39:31,153 --> 00:39:34,238
That's not the way life works.

768
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,744
Well, don't worry
about it.

769
00:39:39,779 --> 00:39:42,246
You're not the first editor
i've helped.

770
00:39:43,497 --> 00:39:45,383
I don't want your help.

771
00:39:45,418 --> 00:39:47,251
I want you
out of my life!

772
00:39:47,286 --> 00:39:48,502
Can't do that now.

773
00:39:48,537 --> 00:39:51,005
We have an obligation
between us.

774
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,256
There is no way out.

775
00:39:52,291 --> 00:39:54,141
Hold it!

776
00:39:54,176 --> 00:39:55,393
There's one
way, of course.

777
00:39:55,428 --> 00:39:56,644
And what's that?

778
00:39:56,679 --> 00:40:00,398
You can pay
up, right now.

779
00:40:00,433 --> 00:40:02,266
I suppose that means
that you can't take

780
00:40:02,301 --> 00:40:04,151
my immortal soul
while i'm alive

781
00:40:04,186 --> 00:40:05,403
and walking around,
is that it?

782
00:40:05,438 --> 00:40:07,905
Something like that.

783
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:09,156
Now, wait, wait.

784
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:15,279
This old nose smells
a story coming in.

785
00:40:15,314 --> 00:40:17,164
May solve everything.

786
00:40:20,284 --> 00:40:22,787
Ah!

787
00:40:22,822 --> 00:40:25,289
A shame- poor miss benson.

788
00:40:25,324 --> 00:40:27,425
What about miss benson?

789
00:40:31,796 --> 00:40:36,183
"At 11:30 tonight,
miss jacqueline benson,

790
00:40:36,218 --> 00:40:38,052
"former secretary
to douglas winter,

791
00:40:38,087 --> 00:40:39,303
"editor of
thecourier,

792
00:40:39,338 --> 00:40:40,554
suffered grave
injuries..."

793
00:40:43,307 --> 00:40:45,192
"...suffered grave injuries

794
00:40:45,227 --> 00:40:47,695
"resulting from a head-on
collision between her car

795
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:49,563
"and that
of james edward slocum,

796
00:40:49,598 --> 00:40:50,815
"returning from a skiing trip.

797
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:53,951
The accident
took place on
bascomb road."

798
00:40:58,072 --> 00:41:00,574
That won't stop it.

799
00:41:00,609 --> 00:41:02,460
You still think
i'm a nightmare, do you?

800
00:41:02,495 --> 00:41:03,711
You change it.

801
00:41:03,746 --> 00:41:04,962
I can't change it.

802
00:41:04,997 --> 00:41:07,465
The little modifications i made

803
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,967
altered this machine
quite a bit.

804
00:41:10,002 --> 00:41:12,470
Whatever it writes
comes to pass.

805
00:41:12,505 --> 00:41:13,721
But why jackie?

806
00:41:13,756 --> 00:41:15,589
What did she ever do to you?

807
00:41:15,624 --> 00:41:17,475
She slapped me.

808
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:19,343
And you'd destroy her for that?

809
00:41:19,378 --> 00:41:20,594
Of course not!

810
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:22,596
You're
an intelligent man,

811
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:25,099
but you keep missing
the point.

812
00:41:25,134 --> 00:41:26,350
Don't you see
i've spent

813
00:41:26,385 --> 00:41:28,235
too much time
with you already?

814
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:30,104
I have other
clients waiting.

815
00:41:30,139 --> 00:41:31,989
I want to move on.

816
00:41:32,024 --> 00:41:34,492
I figured this story
about your girlfriend

817
00:41:34,527 --> 00:41:36,360
would hurry things up.

818
00:41:36,395 --> 00:41:37,611
Let me point out

819
00:41:37,646 --> 00:41:39,497
that the item
did not say

820
00:41:39,532 --> 00:41:40,748
that she died
of her injuries-

821
00:41:40,783 --> 00:41:41,365
not yet.

822
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:45,119
I can add a few
lines either way.

823
00:41:45,154 --> 00:41:47,621
Whether she lives or
dies depends on you.

824
00:41:47,656 --> 00:41:51,375
Now, if you decide to
conclude the contract,

825
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:56,380
you'll find this a lot
surer than the bridge.

826
00:41:56,415 --> 00:41:58,265
Quicker, too.

827
00:42:05,139 --> 00:42:07,024
That leaves youthree.

828
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:13,898
Where you going?

829
00:42:13,933 --> 00:42:16,901
There's got to be some way
to stop you,

830
00:42:16,936 --> 00:42:18,152
and i'm going to find it!

831
00:42:18,187 --> 00:42:20,654
That's the spirit.
Never give up.

832
00:42:20,689 --> 00:42:24,408
But remember, you only have
one hour and 15 minutes.

833
00:42:32,666 --> 00:42:34,552
Jackie?

834
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:38,305
Jackie?

835
00:42:38,923 --> 00:42:40,174
Jackie!

836
00:42:40,209 --> 00:42:41,425
Hush!

837
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:43,177
You want to wake up
the whole building?

838
00:42:44,428 --> 00:42:46,313
Where's miss benson?

839
00:42:46,348 --> 00:42:47,565
She ain't in.

840
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:48,816
Well, where did she go?

841
00:42:48,851 --> 00:42:50,067
Well, that's none
of my concern.

842
00:42:50,102 --> 00:42:51,318
When did she leave?

843
00:42:51,353 --> 00:42:52,570
Well... well,
what's the mattter?

844
00:42:52,605 --> 00:42:53,821
When did she leave?!

845
00:42:53,856 --> 00:42:56,323
Oh, a-a-about 15
minutes ago, i think.

846
00:42:56,358 --> 00:42:58,192
But what's the... what's...?

847
00:43:04,949 --> 00:43:07,451
Mr. Smith,
i want to talk to you.

848
00:43:07,486 --> 00:43:08,702
Oh?

849
00:43:08,737 --> 00:43:11,205
First, i want to apologize
for slapping you.

850
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,090
Tush, it's nothing
at all.

851
00:43:13,125 --> 00:43:17,461
Second, i want to ask
something of you.

852
00:43:17,496 --> 00:43:19,964
What might that be?

853
00:43:19,999 --> 00:43:21,849
I want you to go away.

854
00:43:21,884 --> 00:43:24,351
Now, i know you've done
a great deal for the paper.

855
00:43:24,386 --> 00:43:25,603
We appreciate that.

856
00:43:25,638 --> 00:43:27,471
But i love doug.

857
00:43:27,506 --> 00:43:29,356
I want to marry him.

858
00:43:29,391 --> 00:43:31,859
But the way he's been acting
ever sinceyoucame-

859
00:43:31,894 --> 00:43:33,727
i don't even recognize
him anymore.

860
00:43:33,762 --> 00:43:34,979
He's a different person!

861
00:43:35,014 --> 00:43:37,481
You think that's
due to my influence?

862
00:43:37,516 --> 00:43:39,366
Yes, i do...

863
00:43:39,401 --> 00:43:41,235
and i am going to get you
out of this town,

864
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:43,120
away from this paper,
away from doug,

865
00:43:43,155 --> 00:43:44,989
or, so help me...
hold it, hold it!

866
00:43:45,024 --> 00:43:46,874
Don't become
hysterical.

867
00:43:46,909 --> 00:43:48,125
Well, i mean it.

868
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,994
Ireally...
no need to say
another word,

869
00:43:50,029 --> 00:43:54,999
because... i'm
leaving of my
own free will.

870
00:43:57,501 --> 00:43:58,752
You are?

871
00:43:58,787 --> 00:44:01,255
Of course! I never stay
where i'm not wanted.

872
00:44:01,290 --> 00:44:03,757
I have other offers, you know.

873
00:44:03,792 --> 00:44:06,260
In fact, i'm quitting
this very moment.

874
00:44:06,295 --> 00:44:07,895
You are?

875
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:09,146
Certainly.

876
00:44:09,763 --> 00:44:12,266
My only request
is that you drive me.

877
00:44:12,301 --> 00:44:16,654
I have no car, you know,
to drive me to the airport.

878
00:44:16,689 --> 00:44:19,406
Well... certainly. I'd love to.

879
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:22,409
Very well. I'm ready.

880
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:33,037
Well, what about doug?

881
00:44:33,072 --> 00:44:37,424
Oh, i thinkhe
can take care
of himself, hmm?

882
00:44:47,051 --> 00:44:48,936
Would you like
me to drive?

883
00:44:48,971 --> 00:44:51,438
All right.

884
00:44:57,061 --> 00:45:00,197
We'll go
by the bascomb road.

885
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:14,461
Hi, mr. Winter.

886
00:45:14,496 --> 00:45:15,713
Have you seen jackie?

887
00:45:15,748 --> 00:45:16,964
Oh, miss benson? No.

888
00:45:16,999 --> 00:45:18,215
She hasn't been in
since lunch time.

889
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:19,466
What's the matter,
mr. Winter?

890
00:45:19,501 --> 00:45:20,718
You look terrib...

891
00:45:20,753 --> 00:45:22,586
well, can i get you something?

892
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:15,773
Too fast!

893
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:36,353
Why, this is too fast!

894
00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:39,473
Too fast!

895
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:14,892
Oh, look out!

896
00:48:31,525 --> 00:48:34,661
Mr. Smith?

897
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:39,032
Mr. Smith?!

898
00:48:41,535 --> 00:48:43,420
Doug!

899
00:48:43,455 --> 00:48:44,037
Oh, doug!

900
00:48:44,072 --> 00:48:45,289
Jackie!

901
00:48:45,324 --> 00:48:46,540
Oh, jackie!

902
00:48:46,575 --> 00:48:49,042
Doug, mr. Smith-
he tried to kill me!

903
00:48:49,077 --> 00:48:50,294
He tried to kill me!
I know.

904
00:48:50,329 --> 00:48:52,796
We were in this car,
and he kept going faster!

905
00:48:52,831 --> 00:48:54,047
And there was this other car
coming at us,

906
00:48:54,681 --> 00:48:55,299
and he headed
straight for that car!

907
00:48:55,334 --> 00:48:56,550
But it's all
right now.

908
00:48:56,585 --> 00:48:58,435
It's all over.
He was sitting
right there next to me,

909
00:48:58,470 --> 00:48:59,686
and then...
then he was gone!

910
00:49:00,304 --> 00:49:02,189
What's going on?!
What happened?!

911
00:49:02,224 --> 00:49:04,057
Tell me!

912
00:49:04,092 --> 00:49:05,309
Listen to this:

913
00:49:05,344 --> 00:49:07,811
"Mr. Smith, former
star reporter

914
00:49:07,846 --> 00:49:09,062
"and chief
linotype operator

915
00:49:09,097 --> 00:49:10,948
"for thecourier
resigned his position

916
00:49:10,983 --> 00:49:12,199
"and left dansburg
for his home

917
00:49:12,234 --> 00:49:13,450
"at 11:29 this evening.

918
00:49:13,485 --> 00:49:15,319
"His contract with
mr. Douglas winter

919
00:49:15,354 --> 00:49:16,570
"was declared
null and void

920
00:49:16,605 --> 00:49:17,821
"owing to mr. Winter's
incomplete understanding

921
00:49:17,856 --> 00:49:19,706
of the terms of
the document."

922
00:49:19,741 --> 00:49:21,575
Contract?
What contract?

923
00:49:21,610 --> 00:49:22,826
It means that
he'sgone!

924
00:49:22,861 --> 00:49:24,711
Gone?
And he won't be back.

925
00:49:24,746 --> 00:49:25,329
Did he say so?

926
00:49:25,364 --> 00:49:27,214
No, but...

927
00:49:27,249 --> 00:49:29,082
he never goes anyplace
he's not invited.

928
00:49:29,117 --> 00:49:30,334
What do you mean,
invited?

929
00:49:30,369 --> 00:49:32,836
Did you invite him here
in the first place?

930
00:49:32,871 --> 00:49:34,721
Well... in
a way, i did.

931
00:49:34,756 --> 00:49:36,590
In a way, i did.

932
00:49:36,625 --> 00:49:38,475
And i'm going to spend
the rest of my life

933
00:49:38,510 --> 00:49:39,726
making up for it, too.

934
00:49:39,761 --> 00:49:42,229
The first thing
we do is get rid
of this machine!

935
00:49:42,264 --> 00:49:44,097
Why?
And then we're going
to take on thegazette!

936
00:49:44,132 --> 00:49:45,983
Doug, will you please
explain this?!

937
00:49:46,018 --> 00:49:47,851
I don't know what...
i will, i
will, i will.

938
00:49:47,886 --> 00:49:49,736
I'll tell you-
maybe tomorrow.

939
00:49:49,771 --> 00:49:52,856
Right now, let's
get out of here.

940
00:49:56,610 --> 00:49:59,112
Exit the infernal machine,

941
00:49:59,147 --> 00:50:00,998
and with it,
his satanic majesty,

942
00:50:01,033 --> 00:50:04,751
lucifer, prince of darkness-
otherwise known as mr. Smith.

943
00:50:04,786 --> 00:50:06,620
He's gone, but not for good.

944
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:08,505
That wouldn't be like him.

945
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:11,008
He's gone forbad.

946
00:50:11,043 --> 00:50:12,259
And he might be back...

947
00:50:12,294 --> 00:50:16,630
with another ticket
to the twilight zone.

948
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:23,053
For our next show,
mr. Dana andrews

949
00:50:23,088 --> 00:50:24,938
makes his first visit
to the twilight zone

950
00:50:24,973 --> 00:50:27,441
in a show called
"no time like the past."

951
00:50:28,058 --> 00:50:29,943
You'll see him
as a discontented inhabitant

952
00:50:29,978 --> 00:50:33,063
of the 20th century
who goes back in time-

953
00:50:33,098 --> 00:50:35,816
back to what we assume to be
the inviolate past-

954
00:50:35,851 --> 00:50:37,701
and violates it.

955
00:50:37,736 --> 00:50:41,455
A walloping performance,
a strange and odd-ball theme,

956
00:50:41,490 --> 00:50:43,957
and an ending most unexpected

957
00:50:43,992 --> 00:50:46,076
in the tradition
of the twilight zone.

958
00:50:46,111 --> 00:50:49,713
You and i both share
this dubious distinction

959
00:50:49,748 --> 00:50:50,964
with several million
of our peers

960
00:50:50,999 --> 00:50:52,833
who inhabit the 20th century.

961
00:50:52,868 --> 00:50:55,719
And you don't care
for the 20th century?

962
00:50:55,754 --> 00:50:57,220
I do not.

963
00:51:05,345 --> 00:51:06,596
How did you know?

964
00:51:07,597 --> 00:51:09,483
You did, didn't you?

965
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,602
Yes, i knew.

966
00:51:12,637 --> 00:51:14,488
I knew there'd
be a fire.

967
00:51:15,105 --> 00:51:17,107
But what i didn't know-

968
00:51:17,142 --> 00:51:19,609
i didn't know that
i would cause it.
