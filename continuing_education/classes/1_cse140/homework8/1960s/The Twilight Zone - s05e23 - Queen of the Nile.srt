1
00:00:06,606 --> 00:00:09,726
You unlock this door
with the key of imagination.

2
00:00:09,761 --> 00:00:11,611
Beyond it is another dimension-

3
00:00:11,646 --> 00:00:12,862
a dimension of sound,

4
00:00:14,149 --> 00:00:15,982
a dimension of sight,

5
00:00:16,017 --> 00:00:17,867
a dimension of mind.

6
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:20,987
You're moving into a land
of both shadow and substance,

7
00:00:21,022 --> 00:00:22,238
of things and ideas.

8
00:00:22,273 --> 00:00:25,992
You've just crossed over
into the twilight zone.

9
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:01,911
I'm jordan herrick.

10
00:01:01,946 --> 00:01:03,163
I have an appointment
with miss morris.

11
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:04,414
Come in, please.

12
00:01:04,449 --> 00:01:05,665
Thank you.

13
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:20,680
This way,
please.

14
00:01:20,715 --> 00:01:21,931
Thank you.

15
00:01:28,805 --> 00:01:31,307
I'll tell
miss morris you're here.

16
00:01:53,329 --> 00:01:54,581
1940.

17
00:01:57,584 --> 00:01:58,835
1940.

18
00:02:36,506 --> 00:02:39,008
I thought i told you
to stay in your room.

19
00:02:39,043 --> 00:02:42,879
I'm not going to stand by
and watch it happen this time.

20
00:02:42,914 --> 00:02:45,381
You will because i say you will.

21
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:54,390
Jordan herrick,

22
00:02:54,425 --> 00:02:56,276
syndicated columnist
whose work appears

23
00:02:56,893 --> 00:02:58,144
in more
than a hundred newspapers.

24
00:02:58,179 --> 00:03:01,281
By nature a cynic,
a disbeliever

25
00:03:01,316 --> 00:03:04,651
caught for the moment
by a lovely vision.

26
00:03:04,686 --> 00:03:07,787
He knows the vision he's seen
is no dream.

27
00:03:07,822 --> 00:03:09,656
She is pamela morris,
renowned movie star,

28
00:03:09,691 --> 00:03:11,541
whose name is a household word

29
00:03:11,576 --> 00:03:14,043
and whose face is
known to millions.

30
00:03:14,078 --> 00:03:17,797
What mr. Herrick does not know
is that he has also just looked

31
00:03:18,414 --> 00:03:20,917
into the face
of the twilight zone.

32
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:42,655
Mr. Herrick?

33
00:03:47,777 --> 00:03:52,165
Miss morris... hello.

34
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,033
I've kept
you waiting.

35
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:56,536
Oh, no, it really
doesn't matter.

36
00:03:56,571 --> 00:03:57,787
It does matter,

37
00:03:57,822 --> 00:03:59,038
and i am sorry.

38
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:02,792
Oh, but i do
so love the pool.

39
00:04:02,827 --> 00:04:04,677
Am i forgiven?

40
00:04:04,712 --> 00:04:06,546
Of course, i...

41
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:09,299
i should be asking your
forgiveness for this intrusion.

42
00:04:09,933 --> 00:04:11,801
Please relax.

43
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:14,304
Thank you.

44
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:18,057
I think
you're very nice.

45
00:04:22,445 --> 00:04:24,948
Miss morris,
how old are you?

46
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:30,570
I must say, mr. Herrick,
you are a very direct man.

47
00:04:30,605 --> 00:04:32,455
You're not offended?

48
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:33,706
Why should i be?

49
00:04:34,324 --> 00:04:36,209
I have producers, directors;
you have editors-

50
00:04:36,244 --> 00:04:38,077
all very
demanding people.

51
00:04:38,112 --> 00:04:41,831
Besides, a woman in my position
can't afford to have secrets.

52
00:04:41,866 --> 00:04:43,716
I'm certainly relieved
to hear that.

53
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:45,585
I was afraid you'd be offended.

54
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,470
You have nothing
to be afraid of here.

55
00:04:50,508 --> 00:04:52,976
There, that's better.

56
00:04:53,011 --> 00:04:54,844
Now, why don't
you tell me

57
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:56,729
how old
you think i am?

58
00:04:56,764 --> 00:04:58,598
Oh, now, that's
hardly fair.

59
00:04:58,633 --> 00:04:59,849
Oh, do,
come on, now.

60
00:05:02,352 --> 00:05:03,987
Well?

61
00:05:04,022 --> 00:05:05,855
You're very beautiful.

62
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:07,740
That wasn't the question.

63
00:05:07,775 --> 00:05:11,494
You don't look any older now
than you did in that painting.

64
00:05:13,363 --> 00:05:17,116
I was only a child
when i posed for bersonne.

65
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:20,253
I was so frightened of him.

66
00:05:20,288 --> 00:05:22,121
The world was so bright
and new to me,

67
00:05:22,156 --> 00:05:25,875
and he was
so wild and creative.

68
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:28,378
I've never met
anyone like him.

69
00:05:28,413 --> 00:05:30,880
His genius enabled him
to project

70
00:05:31,514 --> 00:05:33,383
the "flowering
of a fragile blossom,"

71
00:05:33,418 --> 00:05:35,268
as he put it.

72
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:39,022
Would you like
some coffee?

73
00:05:39,057 --> 00:05:40,273
Yes, coffee, thank you.

74
00:05:40,308 --> 00:05:42,392
Would you like
something in it?

75
00:05:42,427 --> 00:05:44,277
Cognac? Whiskey?

76
00:05:44,312 --> 00:05:45,528
No, thanks,
i'll take it black.

77
00:05:45,563 --> 00:05:46,896
I thought
newspaper people

78
00:05:46,931 --> 00:05:48,781
were heavy drinkers.

79
00:05:48,816 --> 00:05:50,400
That's a myth.

80
00:05:54,037 --> 00:05:55,288
My mother,
mrs. Draper.

81
00:05:55,323 --> 00:05:56,539
Jordan herrick.

82
00:05:56,574 --> 00:05:57,790
How do you do?

83
00:05:57,825 --> 00:05:59,659
He's a newspaper
man, mother.

84
00:05:59,694 --> 00:06:01,544
How do you do?

85
00:06:01,579 --> 00:06:04,047
Sit down and
have some tea.

86
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:07,166
With my mother
it is tea

87
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:09,052
this precise time
every afternoon.

88
00:06:09,087 --> 00:06:12,171
Me, it's coffee.

89
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:15,558
Mrs. Draper, you must feel
very proud to have a daughter

90
00:06:15,593 --> 00:06:17,060
as famous
as pamela morris.

91
00:06:17,095 --> 00:06:20,179
Mother never did wholly approve
of my career.

92
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:22,065
Believe me, mr. Herrick,

93
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,933
i had little choice
in the matter.

94
00:06:23,968 --> 00:06:27,070
She thinks
i'm too headstrong.

95
00:06:27,105 --> 00:06:29,572
Dedicated
is the word.

96
00:06:29,607 --> 00:06:31,574
You still are, pamela.

97
00:06:31,609 --> 00:06:34,694
Was she always as beautiful
as she is now?

98
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:36,329
Always.

99
00:06:36,364 --> 00:06:37,947
A mother's loyalty.

100
00:06:37,982 --> 00:06:40,333
As a matter of
fact, mr. Herrick,

101
00:06:40,368 --> 00:06:42,201
it is the truth.

102
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:45,338
Perhaps from the mother,
i'll learn the real age

103
00:06:45,373 --> 00:06:46,589
of the daughter.

104
00:06:46,624 --> 00:06:48,458
Isn't age relative?

105
00:06:48,493 --> 00:06:52,211
Besides, didn't i promise to
reveal all to you, mr. Herrick?

106
00:06:53,463 --> 00:06:54,347
Mr. Herrick!

107
00:06:54,382 --> 00:06:56,215
Mother, would you mind seeing

108
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,718
if charlotte has things
under control in the kitchen?

109
00:06:59,969 --> 00:07:03,106
Pleased to have met you,
mrs. Draper.

110
00:07:04,974 --> 00:07:07,477
Good-bye,
mr. Herrick.

111
00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:14,984
Forgive her, but...
she's getting old.

112
00:07:15,019 --> 00:07:18,121
I was hoping she'd give me
some ideas for my article.

113
00:07:18,156 --> 00:07:19,989
No, her mind wanders.

114
00:07:20,024 --> 00:07:23,126
Her memory becomes
increasingly distorted.

115
00:07:23,161 --> 00:07:26,245
Shall we finish
our coffee

116
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,497
on the terrace?

117
00:07:27,532 --> 00:07:29,382
I'm sure there's a breeze
out there.

118
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:34,504
Isn't it lovely
out here?

119
00:07:34,539 --> 00:07:37,006
I often sit here
by the hour,

120
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:39,509
watching the clouds
and the birds.

121
00:07:39,544 --> 00:07:42,645
At night,
i watch the stars.

122
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,896
Yes, it
is lovely.

123
00:07:43,931 --> 00:07:46,399
Oh, but that isn't
what interests you, is it-

124
00:07:46,434 --> 00:07:50,153
my nocturnal habits,
how i dream out here?

125
00:07:50,188 --> 00:07:52,021
I could work it
into my story...

126
00:07:52,056 --> 00:07:55,775
the question of age
is the big thing, isn't it?

127
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:58,277
I'm 38, jordan.

128
00:07:58,312 --> 00:08:00,029
May i call you jordan?

129
00:08:00,064 --> 00:08:01,914
Yes, of course, please.

130
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:03,783
Is 38 terribly old?

131
00:08:03,818 --> 00:08:07,537
The years have never
been kinder to anyone.

132
00:08:08,171 --> 00:08:10,790
What a nice thing
to say.

133
00:08:10,825 --> 00:08:12,041
I mean it.

134
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:19,298
What have you got there?

135
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,184
Some notes-
dates, mostly.

136
00:08:21,219 --> 00:08:23,052
Do they concern me?

137
00:08:23,087 --> 00:08:23,686
Yes.

138
00:08:23,721 --> 00:08:26,189
According to this...

139
00:08:26,224 --> 00:08:28,057
i know, you read a column

140
00:08:28,092 --> 00:08:29,942
by one of those
stupid, jealous women.

141
00:08:29,977 --> 00:08:31,944
If you are 38,

142
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:33,196
how could you
have starred

143
00:08:33,231 --> 00:08:36,315
in a movie
made in 1935?

144
00:08:37,567 --> 00:08:38,951
I can't believe it-

145
00:08:38,986 --> 00:08:41,454
jordan herrick taken in
by the printed word.

146
00:08:41,489 --> 00:08:45,074
Tell me, do you believe
everything you read?

147
00:08:45,109 --> 00:08:46,576
The movie wastrails west.

148
00:08:46,611 --> 00:08:48,461
Darling, it couldn't
have been me.

149
00:08:48,496 --> 00:08:49,712
I would've been ten years old.
Don't you see?

150
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:52,832
It's an old mistake
i've run across before.

151
00:08:52,867 --> 00:08:55,968
According to our files,
your costar was john bradley.

152
00:08:56,003 --> 00:08:58,471
You were in
love with him.

153
00:08:58,506 --> 00:09:00,339
I never even met him.

154
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:02,225
Your files are in error,
and it does happen, you know.

155
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:04,727
In 1935,

156
00:09:04,762 --> 00:09:07,847
you know, i don't think
i'd even seen a movie yet.

157
00:09:07,882 --> 00:09:10,349
We were poor,
living in iowa.

158
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:12,235
My father's business
was failing.

159
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:17,106
It wasn't until 1940
that i set out for hollywood...

160
00:09:17,141 --> 00:09:19,609
a starstruck girl in my teens

161
00:09:19,644 --> 00:09:23,996
following the trail blazed
by so many other hopefuls.

162
00:09:24,031 --> 00:09:24,614
But i was lucky.

163
00:09:24,649 --> 00:09:27,116
You must have been.

164
00:09:27,151 --> 00:09:31,504
You madequeen of the nile
with charles danforth in 1940.

165
00:09:31,539 --> 00:09:32,755
You were 15.

166
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:35,258
Darling, juliet was 12.

167
00:09:35,293 --> 00:09:36,509
But 15?

168
00:09:36,544 --> 00:09:38,377
Now, is that
so much harder to believe

169
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:40,263
than my being 38 today?

170
00:09:40,298 --> 00:09:42,765
No one knew
i was 15.

171
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,634
I matured very early.

172
00:09:48,172 --> 00:09:52,525
I suppose that picture
inspired the decor?

173
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,776
I call it
early egyptian,

174
00:09:53,811 --> 00:09:55,645
though i suppose
it is rather silly, but...

175
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,147
it was my first big break.

176
00:09:58,182 --> 00:10:01,901
Well, i'm just glad
that it wasn't a horror picture,

177
00:10:01,936 --> 00:10:04,403
or i just might have the place
full of caskets.

178
00:10:06,941 --> 00:10:08,658
Do you know...

179
00:10:08,693 --> 00:10:09,909
the fact is that i...

180
00:10:09,944 --> 00:10:14,797
i still do feel
just about 15.

181
00:10:14,832 --> 00:10:16,666
I really do.

182
00:10:16,701 --> 00:10:19,168
No?

183
00:10:19,203 --> 00:10:21,053
With you sitting
there, i feel new

184
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:26,058
and breathless
and just 21.

185
00:10:26,093 --> 00:10:27,927
Oh, i want to savor
all there is

186
00:10:27,962 --> 00:10:29,812
in this life, jordan.

187
00:10:29,847 --> 00:10:31,931
Is it wrong
to feel that way?

188
00:10:31,966 --> 00:10:34,317
No, no, it's not wrong.

189
00:10:34,352 --> 00:10:37,570
I'm being foolish,
saying these things.

190
00:10:37,605 --> 00:10:39,438
And you're not
being foolish.

191
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:41,941
I so seldom get
a chance to...

192
00:10:41,976 --> 00:10:46,329
speak my mind
or air my dreams.

193
00:10:46,364 --> 00:10:47,580
And yours...

194
00:10:57,089 --> 00:10:58,958
what must
you think of me?

195
00:10:58,993 --> 00:11:01,460
I wanted to do that.

196
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:04,597
And you wanted me
to do it, too.

197
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:08,601
You're sweet...

198
00:11:08,636 --> 00:11:11,721
and very real.

199
00:11:11,756 --> 00:11:13,606
But you must go now.

200
00:11:13,641 --> 00:11:14,857
Why?

201
00:11:14,892 --> 00:11:16,108
Because i say so.

202
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:21,731
We'll see each other again
if you'd like.

203
00:11:21,766 --> 00:11:23,616
What about tonight?
Dinner, hmm?

204
00:11:23,651 --> 00:11:24,233
All right.

205
00:11:24,268 --> 00:11:26,736
Why don't we say... 8:00?

206
00:11:26,771 --> 00:11:29,238
Why don't
we say 8:00?

207
00:11:38,748 --> 00:11:41,250
Mr. Herrick!

208
00:11:43,753 --> 00:11:46,255
Hello, mrs. Draper.

209
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:48,758
Mr. Herrick...

210
00:11:48,793 --> 00:11:50,009
yes?

211
00:11:50,044 --> 00:11:52,762
You are a fine
young man.

212
00:11:52,797 --> 00:11:54,013
Well, thank you,
mrs. Draper.

213
00:11:54,048 --> 00:11:55,898
It is not an
idle compliment.

214
00:11:55,933 --> 00:11:58,401
Are you going to
see her again?

215
00:11:58,436 --> 00:11:59,402
Yes, tonight.

216
00:11:59,437 --> 00:12:00,653
We're having dinner.

217
00:12:00,688 --> 00:12:02,521
No, you must
not do that.

218
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:05,024
You must never
see her again.

219
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:06,909
Why not?

220
00:12:06,944 --> 00:12:08,778
She's older
than you think.

221
00:12:08,813 --> 00:12:11,914
Yes, she told me
how old she was.

222
00:12:11,949 --> 00:12:14,417
Yes, i know.

223
00:12:14,452 --> 00:12:15,668
Thirty-eight.

224
00:12:15,703 --> 00:12:18,037
Well, isn't that true?

225
00:12:18,072 --> 00:12:20,172
Mr. Herrick, you
wouldn't believe me

226
00:12:20,207 --> 00:12:24,543
if i told you how
old ithinkshe is.

227
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:26,679
You think? Don't you know?

228
00:12:26,714 --> 00:12:30,549
No... not really.

229
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:32,301
But you're her mother.

230
00:12:33,803 --> 00:12:35,688
No.

231
00:12:35,723 --> 00:12:38,808
I'm not her mother.

232
00:12:38,843 --> 00:12:40,693
I am her daughter!

233
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:18,814
I don't know when
i've had such a wonderful time.

234
00:13:18,849 --> 00:13:21,317
You've been so quiet
all evening.

235
00:13:21,352 --> 00:13:22,568
What is it?

236
00:13:22,603 --> 00:13:26,322
Oh, it's... something
your mother said.

237
00:13:26,357 --> 00:13:29,441
Now, i don't believe
it, but just...

238
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:30,693
just sticks in my mind.

239
00:13:30,728 --> 00:13:33,829
Well, tell me.

240
00:13:33,864 --> 00:13:37,333
She said that you
are her mother.

241
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,451
Her mother?

242
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:41,337
Her mother.

243
00:13:41,372 --> 00:13:44,456
Jordan, darling,
you must believe me.

244
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:46,959
My mother is disturbed.

245
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:49,211
I'm sure it's because
she feels responsible

246
00:13:49,246 --> 00:13:50,462
for my father's death.

247
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:53,716
You see, they were returning
home from a party ten years ago.

248
00:13:53,751 --> 00:13:56,852
She was driving the car,
and it went off the road,

249
00:13:56,887 --> 00:13:58,103
and my father was killed.

250
00:13:58,138 --> 00:14:00,222
I'm sorry.

251
00:14:00,257 --> 00:14:03,359
Ever since then,
she's been furtive, suspicious,

252
00:14:03,394 --> 00:14:05,861
imagining all kinds
of terrible things.

253
00:14:05,896 --> 00:14:08,480
I've tried to help her-
really, i have-

254
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:10,983
but the doctors say
it's hopeless.

255
00:14:11,018 --> 00:14:12,735
She really should be put away,
but i haven't had...

256
00:14:13,369 --> 00:14:13,986
i never should've
brought it up.

257
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,871
Now, let's
forget about it.

258
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:18,991
All right.

259
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:21,493
We'll talk
about something else.

260
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:25,247
After all, we've been talking
about me, and...

261
00:14:25,282 --> 00:14:28,384
now you know about my mother.

262
00:14:28,419 --> 00:14:31,503
What about your life?

263
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:35,257
Very dull...
up until now.

264
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:37,393
All right, then tell me
where you're from.

265
00:14:37,428 --> 00:14:41,764
Chicago. I still
live there.

266
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:44,900
I've played chicago.
The wells theater.

267
00:14:44,935 --> 00:14:47,403
Have you really?

268
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:58,030
I've loved
every moment of it.

269
00:14:58,065 --> 00:14:59,915
I really have.

270
00:15:02,418 --> 00:15:03,669
Shall i see you tomorrow?

271
00:15:03,704 --> 00:15:05,788
Tomorrow.

272
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:09,041
Krueger.

273
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:10,926
Jordan herrick in hollywood?

274
00:15:10,961 --> 00:15:12,795
Yeah, put him on.

275
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:15,931
Hi, jordy, glad you called.

276
00:15:15,966 --> 00:15:17,800
Got another job for you

277
00:15:17,933 --> 00:15:21,687
if you're through playing
with that little femme fatale.

278
00:15:21,722 --> 00:15:23,555
Not yet. Not for a while, krueg.

279
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,441
I want you to do something.

280
00:15:25,476 --> 00:15:28,560
Get out the file on a picture
calledqueen of the nile.

281
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:29,812
Which one?

282
00:15:29,847 --> 00:15:31,063
What do you mean, which one?

283
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:33,699
You're a little young for this.

284
00:15:33,734 --> 00:15:34,950
They made two of them.

285
00:15:34,985 --> 00:15:36,819
The first one, a silent,
i think.

286
00:15:36,854 --> 00:15:39,455
Around 1920,
maybe a little later.

287
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:41,323
All right, get them both.
I'll hang on.

288
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:42,458
Right.

289
00:15:56,839 --> 00:15:58,090
Hey, you there?

290
00:15:58,724 --> 00:15:59,975
Yeah.

291
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:01,844
What was the name of the girl
who starred in the original?

292
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:03,095
Constance taylor.

293
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:05,597
Anyway, she starred
in most of it.

294
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:09,351
There was an accident
during the last day of shooting.

295
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:12,488
Cave-in in a tomb in egypt.

296
00:16:12,523 --> 00:16:13,355
They never found her.

297
00:16:13,989 --> 00:16:15,240
Never found her?

298
00:16:15,275 --> 00:16:17,493
No, it was the end
of a very promising career.

299
00:16:17,528 --> 00:16:19,995
As a matter of fact,
i met constance taylor

300
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,864
when i was about your age.

301
00:16:22,364 --> 00:16:24,249
Extraordinary woman.

302
00:16:24,284 --> 00:16:25,501
How do you mean,
"extraordinary"?

303
00:16:26,001 --> 00:16:27,252
Well, she was ageless.

304
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:29,121
She'd been a reigning beauty

305
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:30,372
in the days
of the flora dora girls.

306
00:16:30,407 --> 00:16:32,758
That was before your time.

307
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,260
She was arealfemme fatale.

308
00:16:35,295 --> 00:16:37,763
She'd been married
half a dozen times

309
00:16:37,798 --> 00:16:39,014
before the accident in egypt.

310
00:16:39,049 --> 00:16:42,134
Sounds like pamela morris,
the same history.

311
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:44,520
Very much the same,
as a matter of fact.

312
00:16:44,555 --> 00:16:45,771
You got a picture
of this taylor girl?

313
00:16:45,806 --> 00:16:47,639
Yeah.

314
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:50,142
Compare it to a picture
of pamela morris.

315
00:17:03,539 --> 00:17:05,407
Yeah, jordy?

316
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:06,041
Well?

317
00:17:06,076 --> 00:17:07,292
They look alike,

318
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:09,161
but then, they played
the same kind of parts.

319
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:12,297
Same makeup, same type costume.

320
00:17:12,915 --> 00:17:14,917
Krueger, the wells theater,
the old wells theater-

321
00:17:14,952 --> 00:17:16,802
what year
did they tear that down?

322
00:17:16,837 --> 00:17:20,806
Oh, sometime back in the '20s.
Why, jordy?

323
00:17:20,841 --> 00:17:23,058
Oh, never mind.
Not until i'm real sure.

324
00:17:23,093 --> 00:17:24,309
In the meantime, get me a list

325
00:17:24,344 --> 00:17:26,812
of all the men who were ever
involved with pamela morris.

326
00:17:26,847 --> 00:17:27,429
Get me every press release,

327
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:29,314
every clipping you have on her,
got it?

328
00:17:29,349 --> 00:17:30,182
Sounds interesting.

329
00:17:30,217 --> 00:17:33,318
May sound fantastic.

330
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:48,951
Well?

331
00:17:48,986 --> 00:17:52,454
It's all true,
mr. Herrick.

332
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:54,339
It'salltrue.

333
00:17:54,374 --> 00:17:56,842
But don't show
it to her.

334
00:17:56,877 --> 00:17:59,962
Leave here at once.

335
00:17:59,997 --> 00:18:01,213
Is this pamela?

336
00:18:01,248 --> 00:18:03,348
Yes, yes.

337
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:04,600
Please, mr. Herrick,

338
00:18:04,635 --> 00:18:07,469
you don't know
how it is.

339
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,223
She had many
different names.

340
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:13,976
But she hasn't changed
in 40 years.

341
00:18:14,011 --> 00:18:16,728
40 years?

342
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:19,231
At least70years-

343
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:22,367
the total sum of my life.

344
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:25,871
Can you imagine
what it was like

345
00:18:25,906 --> 00:18:30,242
to see her always so fresh
and beautiful

346
00:18:30,277 --> 00:18:35,247
while my mirrored image grew
seared and yellowed with age?

347
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:38,500
How old is she, really?

348
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:41,253
She's ageless.

349
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:43,138
Perhaps she's eternal.

350
00:18:43,173 --> 00:18:44,506
What is the secret?

351
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:50,762
What woman would not
sell her soul to know?

352
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:53,899
It has something
to do

353
00:18:53,934 --> 00:18:55,767
with this beetle...

354
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:58,153
with egypt.

355
00:18:58,188 --> 00:19:01,657
The scarabael beetle.

356
00:19:01,692 --> 00:19:04,776
Egyptian symbol
of everlasting life.

357
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:06,662
Tell me, if you hate her
so much...

358
00:19:06,697 --> 00:19:08,530
why do i stay?

359
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:09,781
What else
could i do?

360
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:12,918
After pamela
and my husb...

361
00:19:12,953 --> 00:19:14,786
go on, tell me
the rest.

362
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:16,038
No, i cannot.

363
00:19:16,073 --> 00:19:17,289
You must go now!

364
00:19:17,324 --> 00:19:20,425
What about the other men,
john bradley, charles danforth?

365
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,928
Don't ask
about them!

366
00:19:22,963 --> 00:19:23,545
Mrs. Draper,
listen to me...

367
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,430
mr. Herrick!

368
00:19:25,465 --> 00:19:28,183
How nice you
dropped in.

369
00:19:28,218 --> 00:19:31,937
Has my mother
entertained you?

370
00:19:31,972 --> 00:19:35,691
What wild tales
did you spin?

371
00:19:35,726 --> 00:19:38,193
I don't think they're
wild tales at all.

372
00:19:38,228 --> 00:19:41,313
For example, the
wells theater,

373
00:19:41,348 --> 00:19:43,198
where you played...

374
00:19:43,233 --> 00:19:45,067
was torn down
in the '20s.

375
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:49,705
You may leave us, mother.

376
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:52,207
Charlotte will prepare
your tea in your room.

377
00:19:52,242 --> 00:19:53,458
Pamela, please!

378
00:19:54,076 --> 00:19:56,578
I wish to speak
to mr. Herrick alone.

379
00:20:10,225 --> 00:20:11,843
Your coffee.

380
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,848
You were saying...

381
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:21,236
don't you think
it's time we had

382
00:20:21,271 --> 00:20:23,739
anhonesttalk?

383
00:20:23,774 --> 00:20:26,992
What do you want?

384
00:20:27,027 --> 00:20:27,609
Money?

385
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:29,494
No.

386
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:31,363
Just the truth.

387
00:20:32,614 --> 00:20:35,117
And you shall have it.

388
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:05,781
What?

389
00:21:11,653 --> 00:21:12,904
What is that?

390
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:16,041
The rare egyptian scarab.

391
00:21:16,076 --> 00:21:17,909
The secret of eternity.

392
00:21:19,795 --> 00:21:20,412
Where did you...

393
00:21:20,447 --> 00:21:21,663
get it?

394
00:21:21,698 --> 00:21:25,417
From the pharaohs
who understood its power.

395
00:21:26,668 --> 00:21:29,171
Pharaohs? Hmm?

396
00:21:29,206 --> 00:21:34,176
I told you, mr. Herrick,
i was once queen of the nile.

397
00:21:34,211 --> 00:21:36,428
You, uh...

398
00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:38,049
i told you never
to come in

399
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:40,552
until i called
you, viola...

400
00:23:40,587 --> 00:23:43,054
ifyou want to
live another day.

401
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:45,557
Get rid of
it, quickly.

402
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:55,567
You must be
mr. Jackson.

403
00:23:55,602 --> 00:23:58,069
Yes, i called
the other day.

404
00:23:58,104 --> 00:24:00,822
And i told you
to come out when you could.

405
00:24:00,857 --> 00:24:02,707
Did you think i'd forget?

406
00:24:02,742 --> 00:24:05,827
We'll have coffee
in the living room.

407
00:24:05,862 --> 00:24:07,712
Everybody knows pamela morris,

408
00:24:07,747 --> 00:24:10,215
the beautiful
and eternally young movie star.

409
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:13,335
Or does she have another name
even more famous,

410
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:16,471
an egyptian name
from centuries past?

411
00:24:16,506 --> 00:24:18,340
It's best
not to be too curious,

412
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:20,842
lest you wind up
like jordan herrick-

413
00:24:21,476 --> 00:24:23,345
a pile of dust and old clothing

414
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,847
discarded
in the endless eternity

415
00:24:25,882 --> 00:24:27,732
of the twilight zone.

416
00:24:30,318 --> 00:24:32,187
And now, mr. Serling.

417
00:24:32,222 --> 00:24:34,689
Next time out, we do a little
biting of the hand that feeds

418
00:24:34,724 --> 00:24:35,941
and we tell you
a delightful yarn

419
00:24:35,976 --> 00:24:37,192
that has to do with television.

420
00:24:37,227 --> 00:24:40,328
Not normal television, mind you,
but a wacky tale

421
00:24:40,363 --> 00:24:42,197
about a tv set
that predicts the future.

422
00:24:42,232 --> 00:24:43,448
It's written my martin goldsmith

423
00:24:43,483 --> 00:24:45,333
and stars three
eminently talented people

424
00:24:45,368 --> 00:24:47,202
who make their first visit
to the zone:

425
00:24:47,237 --> 00:24:49,704
Joan blondell, william demarest
and sterling holloway.

426
00:24:49,739 --> 00:24:53,458
On thetwilight zonenext time,
"what's in the box."
