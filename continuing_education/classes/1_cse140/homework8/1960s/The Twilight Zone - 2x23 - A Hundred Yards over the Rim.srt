1
00:00:11,327 --> 00:00:13,196
You're traveling
through another dimension

2
00:00:13,231 --> 00:00:16,332
a dimension not only
of sight and sound, but of mind

3
00:00:16,367 --> 00:00:18,201
a journey into a wondrous land

4
00:00:18,236 --> 00:00:20,086
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

5
00:00:20,121 --> 00:00:21,838
That's the signpost up ahead.

6
00:00:21,873 --> 00:00:24,591
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

7
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:36,469
Whoa!

8
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:19,145
This is the 11th day
of fever, christian

9
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:22,265
11 days of fever.

10
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,516
He just can't take
much more.

11
00:01:23,551 --> 00:01:26,019
You said that
after the third day

12
00:01:26,054 --> 00:01:27,270
and the fourth, martha.

13
00:01:27,305 --> 00:01:29,773
He'll take more,
just as we all have.

14
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:35,411
How's the boy, mrs. Horn?

15
00:01:35,446 --> 00:01:38,164
Oh, about the same,
thank you, charlie.

16
00:01:42,418 --> 00:01:45,538
You figure that apache country
is just due south.

17
00:01:45,573 --> 00:01:46,790
That's what
you said

18
00:01:46,825 --> 00:01:48,675
we were looking for, isn't it?

19
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,543
That's what
we're looking for.

20
00:01:52,428 --> 00:01:54,931
It's, uh, it's this way, chris:

21
00:01:54,966 --> 00:01:58,685
We've been doing a lot of
talking and a lot of thinking...

22
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,436
and?

23
00:02:00,471 --> 00:02:02,055
We figure we ought to turn back.

24
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,559
Turn back.

25
00:02:06,594 --> 00:02:07,811
Is that what you figure?

26
00:02:07,846 --> 00:02:09,696
Is that what you want?

27
00:02:09,731 --> 00:02:12,065
Chris, we're about
at the end of our rope.

28
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,316
We're hungry and we're sick.

29
00:02:13,351 --> 00:02:17,070
We figure if we don't do it now,
we're going to die out here.

30
00:02:17,105 --> 00:02:20,323
If you try to go the 1,500
miles back to st. Louis

31
00:02:20,358 --> 00:02:24,077
i'll guarantee you'll leave your
bones bleached on some desert

32
00:02:24,112 --> 00:02:27,831
or lose your scalps,
or freeze in a mountain pass.

33
00:02:27,866 --> 00:02:28,715
What about water, chris?

34
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:29,966
We're almost out of water.

35
00:02:30,001 --> 00:02:31,718
I'll find us water.

36
00:02:31,753 --> 00:02:32,969
I'll get water.

37
00:02:33,004 --> 00:02:34,470
How, chris-
with a divining rod?

38
00:02:34,505 --> 00:02:36,840
I don't know,
but i'll find water.

39
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:40,226
And food, chris,
and medicine for your own child?

40
00:02:41,978 --> 00:02:44,480
I'll take a look at
that rim over there.

41
00:02:44,515 --> 00:02:48,852
Chris, you might... you might
look for some shady spot...

42
00:02:49,485 --> 00:02:51,988
a pretty spot where we might...

43
00:02:52,023 --> 00:02:54,490
we'll not talk about burying our son now

44
00:02:54,525 --> 00:02:56,359
not while there's
breath in him.

45
00:02:56,394 --> 00:02:58,244
Stay close
to the wagons.

46
00:02:58,862 --> 00:03:00,747
Keep them bunched up.

47
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:07,003
Chris, how far you going?

48
00:03:07,038 --> 00:03:11,374
Just over that rim
there about 100 yards.

49
00:03:11,409 --> 00:03:14,510
Maybe there's a stream,
or game or something.

50
00:03:14,545 --> 00:03:17,013
You never can tell.

51
00:03:17,048 --> 00:03:19,515
Never can tell, chris.

52
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:23,887
You hold on...
hold on, all of you.

53
00:03:23,922 --> 00:03:25,772
I'll be right back.

54
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:33,646
The year is 1847, the place
is the territory of new mexico.

55
00:03:33,681 --> 00:03:37,400
The people are a tiny handful
of men and women with a dream.

56
00:03:37,435 --> 00:03:41,154
11 months ago, they started
out from ohio and headed west.

57
00:03:41,189 --> 00:03:44,407
Someone told them about
a place called california

58
00:03:44,442 --> 00:03:48,795
about a warm sun and a blue sky,
about rich land and fresh air

59
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:51,297
and at this moment,
almost a year later

60
00:03:51,332 --> 00:03:54,417
they've seen nothing
but cold, heat, exhaustion

61
00:03:54,452 --> 00:03:55,668
hunger and sickness.

62
00:03:55,703 --> 00:03:57,804
This man's name
is christian horn.

63
00:03:57,839 --> 00:03:59,672
He has a dying
eight-year-old son

64
00:03:59,707 --> 00:04:00,924
and a heartsick wife

65
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,809
and he's the only one remaining

66
00:04:02,844 --> 00:04:05,311
who has even a fragment
of the dream left-

67
00:04:05,346 --> 00:04:08,431
mr. Chris horn, who is going
over the top of a rim

68
00:04:08,466 --> 00:04:10,316
to look for water
and sustenance

69
00:04:10,351 --> 00:04:13,436
and in a moment will move
into the twilight zone.

70
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:31,254
Martha!

71
00:04:33,122 --> 00:04:35,008
Charlie!

72
00:04:46,135 --> 00:04:48,021
Where'd they go?

73
00:05:03,786 --> 00:05:08,791
What's going on here?

74
00:07:42,812 --> 00:07:44,697
Howdy.

75
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:53,322
Did you see it?

76
00:07:53,357 --> 00:07:55,458
See what?

77
00:07:55,493 --> 00:07:58,828
That thing... that monsterlike
thing that came at me.

78
00:07:58,863 --> 00:07:59,829
Monster?

79
00:07:59,864 --> 00:08:02,465
Yeah, it almost...
almost hit me.

80
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:08,588
Well, mister,
i never saw anything.

81
00:08:08,623 --> 00:08:11,724
If there was anything,
it never got to here.

82
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,479
Oh, no, but it was just
a mile or two down the road.

83
00:08:17,346 --> 00:08:19,232
You mean the truck?

84
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:23,853
The truck?

85
00:08:23,888 --> 00:08:25,738
Are you
all right?

86
00:08:25,773 --> 00:08:31,244
I mean, uh... how long you
been out there in the desert?

87
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:34,747
Oh, well, almost a year.

88
00:08:34,782 --> 00:08:39,118
That is, almost a year
since we left ohio.

89
00:08:39,153 --> 00:08:42,255
One of the wagons was burned
by the indians

90
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:45,374
and the other two
went back.

91
00:08:45,409 --> 00:08:47,260
Yeah, well, uh...

92
00:08:47,295 --> 00:08:51,013
well, why don't you come on
inside for awhile, huh?

93
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:55,518
Let me take a look
at that arm, too.

94
00:08:55,553 --> 00:08:57,386
Yes, the gun went off

95
00:08:57,421 --> 00:09:00,523
when that... when
that monster came at me.

96
00:09:00,558 --> 00:09:03,025
Yeah, you let mary lou
take a look at it.

97
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,894
She used to be
a nurse's aide.

98
00:09:04,929 --> 00:09:07,396
Mary lou
is my wife.

99
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:11,784
Come on.

100
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:19,408
Mary lou!

101
00:09:19,443 --> 00:09:22,545
Uh... this, uh,
fellow shot himself

102
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:25,047
in the arm by accident.

103
00:09:25,082 --> 00:09:27,300
You want to take
a look at him?

104
00:09:27,335 --> 00:09:29,168
Why, sure.

105
00:09:29,203 --> 00:09:31,053
You sit down
over there, mister

106
00:09:31,088 --> 00:09:32,922
and i'll get
some bandages out.

107
00:09:32,957 --> 00:09:34,173
Yeah, uh, go ahead.

108
00:09:37,426 --> 00:09:38,678
Sit down.

109
00:09:39,929 --> 00:09:42,431
Have a glass of water.

110
00:09:44,934 --> 00:09:46,819
Go ahead.

111
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:09,458
Obliged.

112
00:10:09,493 --> 00:10:12,595
Well, now, there's
an old-timer.

113
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,354
It, uh... must be
a real antique, huh?

114
00:10:21,389 --> 00:10:23,856
It's been used a lot.

115
00:10:25,107 --> 00:10:30,112
Well, it isn't hunting
season around here.

116
00:10:35,117 --> 00:10:36,369
What about indians?

117
00:10:36,404 --> 00:10:37,620
Indians?

118
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:41,490
Well, we don't have any indians.

119
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:46,495
Well, leastways
not hostile ones, huh?

120
00:10:55,504 --> 00:10:57,390
How long have you been here?

121
00:10:57,425 --> 00:11:01,143
Uh... a couple of years.

122
00:11:01,178 --> 00:11:03,646
See, we lived over in phoenix.

123
00:11:03,681 --> 00:11:04,263
Phoenix.

124
00:11:04,298 --> 00:11:06,148
Yeah,
phoenix.

125
00:11:06,183 --> 00:11:09,902
You see, uh, mary lou's folks
are from there.

126
00:11:14,023 --> 00:11:15,408
And, uh...

127
00:11:16,525 --> 00:11:19,028
first married, i worked for her old man.

128
00:11:19,063 --> 00:11:20,913
And then we, uh

129
00:11:20,948 --> 00:11:23,416
we bought this place here, and, uh...

130
00:11:25,668 --> 00:11:27,920
of course, i admit
the restaurant

131
00:11:27,955 --> 00:11:30,423
isn't doing too good right now, but, uh...

132
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:35,428
trucks are beginning
to stop now.

133
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:39,799
This, uh, is a jukebox.

134
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,945
It's a jukebox.

135
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:04,707
Hey, mister

136
00:12:04,742 --> 00:12:06,575
where are you from?

137
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:09,078
I mean, really.

138
00:12:09,113 --> 00:12:10,329
Where are you from?

139
00:12:10,364 --> 00:12:11,580
From?

140
00:12:11,615 --> 00:12:12,832
Yeah.

141
00:12:12,867 --> 00:12:15,334
I'm from ohio.

142
00:12:15,369 --> 00:12:17,219
Ohio!

143
00:12:17,254 --> 00:12:20,973
I left the wagons on
the other side of the rim.

144
00:12:21,008 --> 00:12:24,093
I came to look for water.

145
00:12:24,128 --> 00:12:25,344
Well, there's
a natural spring

146
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:25,978
just west of here.

147
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:29,098
Spring?

148
00:12:29,133 --> 00:12:30,099
Yeah.

149
00:12:30,134 --> 00:12:31,984
And game?

150
00:12:33,235 --> 00:12:35,104
Well, uh...

151
00:12:35,139 --> 00:12:37,106
i guess so.

152
00:12:37,141 --> 00:12:40,109
Here, you... you take two of these

153
00:12:40,144 --> 00:12:42,745
and drink some water with them.

154
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:45,247
What do you have there?

155
00:12:45,282 --> 00:12:49,001
Well, it's penicillin.

156
00:12:49,036 --> 00:12:51,504
It'll keep away any infection.

157
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:55,875
Where did you get it?

158
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:58,377
At the
drugstore.

159
00:13:01,263 --> 00:13:03,132
You feel all right?

160
00:13:05,634 --> 00:13:08,771
Do you say this is good
for a sickness?

161
00:13:08,806 --> 00:13:13,776
Well, sometimes, depending on what it is.

162
00:13:13,811 --> 00:13:18,147
I've got a real sick boy
back in the wagon.

163
00:13:18,182 --> 00:13:21,283
You mean, you brought
your family with you?

164
00:13:21,318 --> 00:13:25,037
There were three wagons...

165
00:13:25,072 --> 00:13:29,408
and i... i looked around
and i...

166
00:13:30,659 --> 00:13:34,413
what is that?

167
00:13:34,448 --> 00:13:36,298
It looks just like...

168
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:41,303
oh, god in heaven,
how could that be?

169
00:13:41,338 --> 00:13:46,926
That says
"september, 1961"

170
00:13:46,961 --> 00:13:50,062
when it's...

171
00:13:50,097 --> 00:13:52,565
eighteen hundred
and forty-seven!

172
00:13:57,937 --> 00:13:59,188
Who are you?

173
00:14:03,325 --> 00:14:06,445
Who are you and where am i?

174
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:10,833
Where is
this place?

175
00:14:13,335 --> 00:14:14,587
Where am i?

176
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:30,386
Thank you.

177
00:14:30,421 --> 00:14:32,271
Come again.

178
00:14:42,898 --> 00:14:46,652
Well, doc, what do you think?

179
00:14:46,687 --> 00:14:48,537
If you had some bourbon,
mary lou,

180
00:14:48,572 --> 00:14:51,040
i'd prefer that
at the moment, but...

181
00:14:51,075 --> 00:14:52,908
coffee'll do
for second best.

182
00:14:52,943 --> 00:14:54,159
Having coffee, huh?

183
00:14:54,194 --> 00:14:56,662
Did you take a look
at him, doc?

184
00:14:56,697 --> 00:14:59,798
I did, indeed.

185
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:02,301
Malnutrition, that's
his major problem

186
00:15:02,336 --> 00:15:04,803
although he's not
a bad specimen of a man

187
00:15:04,838 --> 00:15:06,672
i'll say that.

188
00:15:06,707 --> 00:15:07,923
You were right, joe

189
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:09,174
he's an interesting
customer.

190
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:11,677
Must have been
the heat, huh?

191
00:15:11,712 --> 00:15:12,928
Or something.

192
00:15:12,963 --> 00:15:16,682
Well, i mean, doc,
he's just not rational.

193
00:15:16,717 --> 00:15:18,567
Now, i'm not
a psychiatrist, joe.

194
00:15:18,602 --> 00:15:20,436
I'm just an
old-fashioned g.p.

195
00:15:20,471 --> 00:15:21,687
But freud himself

196
00:15:21,722 --> 00:15:23,572
would have something
to gnaw on here.

197
00:15:24,858 --> 00:15:27,326
Oh, he happens
to seem very rational.

198
00:15:27,361 --> 00:15:28,577
Oh, doc, come on!

199
00:15:28,612 --> 00:15:30,446
He can trace his
imaginary life

200
00:15:30,481 --> 00:15:33,582
a whole lot clearer than
any of us can our own.

201
00:15:33,617 --> 00:15:34,833
His seeming recall
is amazing.

202
00:15:35,451 --> 00:15:36,702
But what does that mean?

203
00:15:36,737 --> 00:15:37,336
And one other thing.

204
00:15:37,371 --> 00:15:39,838
A little parenthetic
aside, let's call it.

205
00:15:39,873 --> 00:15:42,341
The fillings
in his teeth-

206
00:15:42,376 --> 00:15:43,592
there are
two of them.

207
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:47,463
No modern-day dentist ever drilled them.

208
00:15:47,498 --> 00:15:49,348
And you saw his gun, joe.

209
00:15:49,383 --> 00:15:51,216
Sure, but it's an antique.

210
00:15:51,251 --> 00:15:54,219
An antique that isn't
more than a year old!

211
00:15:54,254 --> 00:15:56,105
A 100-year-old gun, joe

212
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:59,224
and you said yourself it looked
like it was manufactured

213
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:01,110
less than a year ago.

214
00:16:01,145 --> 00:16:03,228
Okay, now, doc

215
00:16:03,263 --> 00:16:04,613
you're not trying
to tell us...

216
00:16:04,648 --> 00:16:06,482
i'm not trying to
tell you anything, joe.

217
00:16:06,517 --> 00:16:08,367
That is, i'm not
trying to make a point.

218
00:16:08,402 --> 00:16:09,618
All i'm giving you

219
00:16:09,653 --> 00:16:10,869
is the benefit
of some observation.

220
00:16:10,904 --> 00:16:13,372
He's suffering a delusion of some kind

221
00:16:13,407 --> 00:16:15,874
but it's a delusion
of the purest form.

222
00:16:15,909 --> 00:16:20,245
The way he describes
those wagons, his wife

223
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,748
the other people, his son.

224
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:25,250
He said his son was sick.

225
00:16:25,285 --> 00:16:27,136
Yes, he told me
his boy was dying

226
00:16:27,171 --> 00:16:30,255
and from the way
he described the symptoms

227
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:31,507
i'd call it pneumonia.

228
00:16:35,144 --> 00:16:37,262
Well, i sure don't
understand it.

229
00:16:37,297 --> 00:16:39,148
I don't
either.

230
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,770
So, doc...

231
00:16:44,805 --> 00:16:47,906
what are we going
to do with him?

232
00:16:47,941 --> 00:16:49,775
I want the
sheriff's office, please.

233
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:51,026
Precisely what i'm doing now.

234
00:16:51,061 --> 00:16:54,163
I'm getting the authorities
in here to take care of him.

235
00:16:54,198 --> 00:16:57,282
Hello, is the
sheriff there?

236
00:16:57,317 --> 00:16:59,168
Oh, well, that's even better.

237
00:16:59,203 --> 00:17:01,670
Can you radio to him
to get over to joe's diner

238
00:17:01,705 --> 00:17:02,287
as fast as he can?

239
00:17:02,322 --> 00:17:04,790
There's a man here
who needs looking after.

240
00:17:04,825 --> 00:17:06,925
My son.

241
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:15,050
I read this in the book.

242
00:17:15,085 --> 00:17:18,187
The encyclopedia.

243
00:17:18,222 --> 00:17:23,809
"Horn, christian,
junior, m.d.

244
00:17:23,844 --> 00:17:27,563
"Famous for his early work
in childhood diseases

245
00:17:27,598 --> 00:17:30,065
"pioneer in
vaccine research.

246
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:33,452
Meladin,
ohio, 1839.

247
00:17:33,487 --> 00:17:38,957
Santa barbara,
california, 1914."

248
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:43,712
That's my son- that's chris.

249
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:50,085
I may be crazy, or the world
may be turned upside down

250
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:53,222
but i know that i've been
put here for a reason.

251
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:00,729
A reason.

252
00:18:02,598 --> 00:18:03,849
Thank you.

253
00:18:03,884 --> 00:18:07,603
You've been kind and gracious
and i appreciate it

254
00:18:08,237 --> 00:18:10,239
and i've got
to get back.

255
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:15,244
Horn, we want
to help you

256
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:17,746
but help means rest
and medical attention.

257
00:18:17,781 --> 00:18:19,615
I've sent for
the authorities.

258
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:22,751
I want you to come
over here and sit down.

259
00:18:22,786 --> 00:18:25,254
Authorities- i have
no idea who they may be

260
00:18:25,289 --> 00:18:28,373
but i have not the time
to wait and find out.

261
00:18:28,408 --> 00:18:30,259
Horn, please!

262
00:20:48,146 --> 00:20:49,398
Martha.

263
00:20:49,433 --> 00:20:52,517
Did you forget
something, christian?

264
00:20:52,552 --> 00:20:53,769
Where did you go?

265
00:20:53,804 --> 00:20:55,020
Where did we go?

266
00:20:55,055 --> 00:20:56,905
What do you mean, chris?

267
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:00,025
Where could
we have gone?

268
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:02,527
Well... all this time.

269
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:04,413
Allwhattime?

270
00:21:04,448 --> 00:21:06,915
Chris, honey, you just
left a few seconds ago.

271
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:10,035
What did you forget?

272
00:21:11,286 --> 00:21:12,537
What's that?

273
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:21,930
Here. Give him
two of these tablets.

274
00:21:21,965 --> 00:21:24,433
I think it may
save his life.

275
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:31,940
Short trip, chris.

276
00:21:31,975 --> 00:21:34,943
Nothing much on the
other side, was there?

277
00:21:36,812 --> 00:21:38,697
You'd be surprised,
charlie.

278
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:44,953
There's a whole lot
on the other side of that rim.

279
00:21:47,456 --> 00:21:53,712
For there'll be highways
and many new things-

280
00:21:53,747 --> 00:21:56,832
a whole new land.

281
00:21:56,867 --> 00:21:59,968
You know what, charlie?

282
00:22:00,003 --> 00:22:01,837
It was people like us.

283
00:22:04,339 --> 00:22:15,600
We made it happen.

284
00:22:15,635 --> 00:22:16,601
I wouldn't
worry none, joe.

285
00:22:16,636 --> 00:22:17,853
He can't get far.

286
00:22:17,888 --> 00:22:19,738
We'll be
finding him soon.

287
00:22:19,773 --> 00:22:20,989
Okay. Thanks, sheriff.

288
00:22:33,869 --> 00:22:37,122
Joe, what happened?

289
00:22:37,157 --> 00:22:40,258
Mary lou...
this is horn's rifle.

290
00:22:40,293 --> 00:22:41,510
Why...

291
00:22:41,545 --> 00:22:44,012
i picked it up just
where he dropped it,

292
00:22:44,047 --> 00:22:46,515
and look at it.
Just look at it.

293
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:50,268
It looks like
it's been lying

294
00:22:50,303 --> 00:22:52,771
out in the desert
for 100 years.

295
00:22:52,806 --> 00:22:54,022
Yeah.

296
00:22:57,776 --> 00:22:59,644
Hey, joe.

297
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:02,781
Who was he?

298
00:23:02,816 --> 00:23:04,649
Where did he come from?

299
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:15,911
I think he went back

300
00:23:15,946 --> 00:23:19,047
to wherever it was
he did come from

301
00:23:19,082 --> 00:23:22,167
because, when we got
to the top of the hill,

302
00:23:22,202 --> 00:23:25,303
he... just disappeared.

303
00:23:25,921 --> 00:23:29,057
Where, joe?

304
00:23:29,092 --> 00:23:32,811
All right, boys,
there's water up ahead,

305
00:23:32,846 --> 00:23:35,313
and we're going to california.

306
00:23:36,932 --> 00:23:41,937
And my son has got
a whole lot to accomplish there.

307
00:23:43,939 --> 00:23:45,190
A whole lot.

308
00:23:45,225 --> 00:23:46,441
Giddyap!

309
00:23:46,476 --> 00:23:48,326
Mr. Christian horn-

310
00:23:48,361 --> 00:23:51,446
one of the hearty breed
of men who headed west

311
00:23:51,481 --> 00:23:54,583
during a time when there were
no concrete highways

312
00:23:54,618 --> 00:23:57,085
or the solace of civilization.

313
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,205
Mr. Christian horn, family
and party heading west

314
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:05,210
after a brief detour
to the twilight zone.

315
00:24:56,845 --> 00:25:00,599
Be sure and watchgunsmoke,
starring james arness,

316
00:25:00,634 --> 00:25:03,735
saturday nights over most
of these same stations.
