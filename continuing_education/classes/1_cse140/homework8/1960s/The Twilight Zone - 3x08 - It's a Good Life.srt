1
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:12,262
You're traveling
through another dimension-

2
00:00:12,297 --> 00:00:16,016
a dimension not only of sight
and sound, but of mind,

3
00:00:16,051 --> 00:00:17,884
a journey into a wondrous land

4
00:00:17,919 --> 00:00:19,769
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

5
00:00:19,804 --> 00:00:22,889
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

6
00:00:26,643 --> 00:00:29,779
Tonight's story onthe twilight
zoneis somewhat unique

7
00:00:29,814 --> 00:00:32,282
and calls for a different kind
of introduction.

8
00:00:32,317 --> 00:00:35,402
This, as you may recognize,
is a map of the united states

9
00:00:35,437 --> 00:00:38,538
and there's a little town there
called peaksville.

10
00:00:38,573 --> 00:00:40,407
On a given morning
not too long ago

11
00:00:40,442 --> 00:00:42,292
the rest of the world
disappeared

12
00:00:42,327 --> 00:00:44,160
and peaksville
was left all alone.

13
00:00:44,195 --> 00:00:47,297
Its inhabitants were never sure
whether the world was destroyed

14
00:00:47,332 --> 00:00:49,165
and only peaksville
left untouched,

15
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,668
or whether the village
had somehow been taken away.

16
00:00:51,703 --> 00:00:54,804
They were, on the other hand,
sure of one thing- the cause.

17
00:00:54,839 --> 00:00:57,307
A monster had arrived
in the village.

18
00:00:57,342 --> 00:01:01,061
Just by using his mind,
he took away the automobiles,

19
00:01:01,177 --> 00:01:04,314
the electricity, the machines,
because they displeased him.

20
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:06,816
And he moved
an entire community

21
00:01:06,851 --> 00:01:09,936
back into the dark ages
just by using his mind.

22
00:01:09,971 --> 00:01:11,688
Now i'd like to introduce you

23
00:01:11,723 --> 00:01:13,573
to some of the people
in peaksville, ohio.

24
00:01:13,608 --> 00:01:15,325
This is mr. Fremont.

25
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,079
It's in his farmhouse
that the monster resides.

26
00:01:19,114 --> 00:01:21,581
This is mrs. Fremont.

27
00:01:21,616 --> 00:01:24,084
And this is aunt amy,
who probably had more control

28
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:26,586
over the monster in the
beginning than almost anyone.

29
00:01:26,621 --> 00:01:28,338
But one day she forgot.

30
00:01:28,373 --> 00:01:29,589
She began to sing aloud.

31
00:01:29,624 --> 00:01:32,092
Now, the monster
doesn't like singing

32
00:01:32,127 --> 00:01:33,960
so his mind snapped at her,

33
00:01:33,995 --> 00:01:37,097
and turned her
into this smiling, vacant thing

34
00:01:37,132 --> 00:01:38,348
you're looking at now.

35
00:01:38,383 --> 00:01:40,216
She sings no more.

36
00:01:40,251 --> 00:01:42,218
And you'll note
that the people

37
00:01:42,253 --> 00:01:44,104
in peaksville, ohio
have to smile.

38
00:01:44,139 --> 00:01:47,857
They have to think happy
thoughts and say happy things

39
00:01:47,892 --> 00:01:50,977
because once displeased,
the monster can wish them

40
00:01:51,012 --> 00:01:52,862
into a cornfield or change them

41
00:01:52,897 --> 00:01:55,365
into a grotesque,
walking horror.

42
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,485
This particular monster
can read minds, you see.

43
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,621
He knows every thought,
he can feel every emotion.

44
00:02:01,656 --> 00:02:04,374
Oh, yes, i did forget something,
didn't i?

45
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:07,494
I forgot to introduce you
to the monster.

46
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:09,629
This is the monster.

47
00:02:09,664 --> 00:02:11,498
His name is anthony fremont.

48
00:02:11,533 --> 00:02:14,634
He's six-years-old
with a cute, little-boy face

49
00:02:14,669 --> 00:02:15,885
and blue, guileless eyes.

50
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,754
But when those eyes look
at you,

51
00:02:17,789 --> 00:02:20,890
you'd better start thinking
happy thoughts

52
00:02:20,925 --> 00:02:24,010
because the mind behind them
is absolutely in charge.

53
00:02:24,045 --> 00:02:27,147
This is the twilight zone.

54
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,263
Howdy, anthony.

55
00:03:00,298 --> 00:03:03,383
Mighty good
to see you today.

56
00:03:03,418 --> 00:03:05,635
Mighty good.

57
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:09,389
And it's such a
good day, isn't it?

58
00:03:09,424 --> 00:03:10,640
A real good day.

59
00:03:10,675 --> 00:03:12,525
It's a terrible
hot day, though.

60
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,528
It's a terrible
hot day.

61
00:03:15,563 --> 00:03:17,030
Oh, i wouldn't
say that, aunt amy.

62
00:03:17,647 --> 00:03:19,532
No, sir, i wouldn't
say that at all.

63
00:03:19,567 --> 00:03:22,035
It's fine. It's just fine.

64
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:24,537
It's a real good day!

65
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,541
What are you
doing, anthony?

66
00:03:28,576 --> 00:03:30,410
My, that's real good,

67
00:03:30,445 --> 00:03:32,045
whatever it is.

68
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,547
I was just wondering
what you were doing.

69
00:03:35,164 --> 00:03:37,667
I made a gopher
with three heads.

70
00:03:37,702 --> 00:03:39,552
See him?

71
00:03:39,587 --> 00:03:40,803
Yeah.

72
00:03:40,838 --> 00:03:43,306
Yeah, my, he's
a real fine one.

73
00:03:43,341 --> 00:03:47,677
I ain't never seen a gopher
with three heads before.

74
00:03:47,712 --> 00:03:48,928
I'll make him dead now.

75
00:03:48,963 --> 00:03:51,431
I'm tired of playing with him.

76
00:03:51,466 --> 00:03:52,682
Be dead.

77
00:03:52,717 --> 00:03:55,818
Gopher, you be dead!

78
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:00,940
My, my, that's real fine
that you done that.

79
00:04:00,975 --> 00:04:02,825
That's-that's
real fine, anthony.

80
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,194
You're a good
boy, anthony.

81
00:04:05,229 --> 00:04:07,080
We all love you.

82
00:04:07,115 --> 00:04:09,582
Don't we, aunt amy?

83
00:04:09,617 --> 00:04:12,085
Don't we love anthony?

84
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,953
We sure do love him.

85
00:04:13,988 --> 00:04:15,204
We love that boy.

86
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:25,715
Howdy, mrs. Fremont.

87
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:27,600
Howdy, bill.

88
00:04:27,635 --> 00:04:28,851
Got everything?

89
00:04:28,886 --> 00:04:30,103
Pretty much.

90
00:04:30,138 --> 00:04:33,222
Didn't have any
more laundry
soap, though.

91
00:04:33,257 --> 00:04:34,474
All out of laundry soap.

92
00:04:34,509 --> 00:04:36,976
Well, that's
to be expected.

93
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,479
Not even the bar
soap, though, huh?

94
00:04:39,514 --> 00:04:40,730
All out of that, too.

95
00:04:40,765 --> 00:04:42,615
Oh, we've been out
of that for a year.

96
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:43,866
You know that,
mrs. Fremont.

97
00:04:43,901 --> 00:04:45,735
We ain't had no bar soap
for over a year.

98
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:47,620
But i... i got
a couple of cans

99
00:04:47,655 --> 00:04:48,237
of tomato soup in here.

100
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:50,740
Didn't even know
we had them left.
Bill...

101
00:04:50,775 --> 00:04:52,625
and anthony just loves
tomato soup, don't he?

102
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,876
So i brought that.

103
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:55,745
Oh, bill.

104
00:04:58,247 --> 00:05:00,750
You'll tell him,
won't you, mrs. Fremont?

105
00:05:00,785 --> 00:05:02,635
Tell him i brought
the tomato soup

106
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,504
because i heard he liked it.

107
00:05:04,539 --> 00:05:07,006
Tell himibrought it,
won't you?

108
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,891
Yes, i will, bill.
Course, i will.

109
00:05:08,926 --> 00:05:11,394
Matter of fact, i'll
tell him right now.

110
00:05:11,429 --> 00:05:13,262
Oh, no, you don't have
to do that, mrs. Fremont.

111
00:05:13,297 --> 00:05:15,765
You don't have to go
to that trouble now.
I got to get going.

112
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,267
I got to get back
to the store.

113
00:05:18,302 --> 00:05:21,404
You don't have to be
frightened of him, bill.

114
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:22,021
He likes you.

115
00:05:22,056 --> 00:05:24,524
He's told me that
several times-

116
00:05:24,559 --> 00:05:25,908
how much he likes you.

117
00:05:25,943 --> 00:05:28,411
Well, that's real nice
to hear, mrs. Fremont.

118
00:05:28,446 --> 00:05:30,279
He's a real clever boy.

119
00:05:30,314 --> 00:05:32,782
You know what he
was doing out there?

120
00:05:32,817 --> 00:05:34,667
Making some kind
of furry animal.

121
00:05:34,702 --> 00:05:36,536
Yesterday he made one...

122
00:05:36,571 --> 00:05:39,038
i never did see
the likes of it.

123
00:05:39,073 --> 00:05:41,541
He invented it
all by himself.

124
00:05:41,576 --> 00:05:44,043
It had real sharp teeth.

125
00:05:44,078 --> 00:05:45,928
It tried to bite him.

126
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,299
I was kind of hoping
that...

127
00:05:54,804 --> 00:05:57,306
i got to get going,
mrs. Fremont.

128
00:05:58,808 --> 00:06:00,059
But i'm real glad

129
00:06:00,094 --> 00:06:02,562
that anthony keeps
making these things.

130
00:06:02,597 --> 00:06:04,447
Oh, see you
tonight, bill.

131
00:06:04,482 --> 00:06:05,698
Tonight?

132
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:07,316
Tonight is television night.

133
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:11,204
Anthony's going to
put a nice picture
on television.

134
00:06:11,239 --> 00:06:14,707
And we're going to have the
surprise party for dan hollis.

135
00:06:14,742 --> 00:06:16,576
A real nice surprise party.

136
00:06:16,611 --> 00:06:18,961
Oh, i... i'll be here,
mrs. Fremont.

137
00:06:18,996 --> 00:06:20,830
I'll certainly be here.

138
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:34,977
Where's anthony?

139
00:06:35,012 --> 00:06:36,229
I think he went

140
00:06:36,264 --> 00:06:37,480
into the barn.

141
00:06:37,515 --> 00:06:39,982
I keep telling him
he shouldn't go there,

142
00:06:40,017 --> 00:06:40,600
but he keeps on...

143
00:06:40,635 --> 00:06:43,102
amy?

144
00:06:43,137 --> 00:06:47,490
It's a real good thing
that anthony goes in the
barn, a real good thing.

145
00:06:47,525 --> 00:06:49,358
But agnes,
he isn't even around...

146
00:06:49,393 --> 00:06:51,861
even so, amy...
you don't have to
keep saying it...

147
00:06:51,896 --> 00:06:54,997
even so, it's nice
that he goes in the
barn, it's real nice.

148
00:06:55,032 --> 00:06:58,117
We mustn't think anything
bad about him, amy.

149
00:06:58,152 --> 00:07:00,002
But he isn't even around.

150
00:07:00,037 --> 00:07:05,007
Amy, dear, you know as well
as i do that sometimes...

151
00:07:05,042 --> 00:07:09,378
sometimes he can hear
what we're thinking,
no matter where he is.

152
00:07:09,413 --> 00:07:12,515
So, you just
keep thinking
real nice things.

153
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:15,635
And tonight, we'll
have dan hollis'
birthday party,

154
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:18,771
and, and we'll just
have a-a delightful time,

155
00:07:18,806 --> 00:07:20,640
just a real nice,
delightful time.

156
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,142
But it's a terrible,
hot day.

157
00:07:23,177 --> 00:07:26,896
I... hope it cools off
by tonight.

158
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:33,152
I wouldn't... say
it was hot, amy.

159
00:07:33,187 --> 00:07:35,037
Why, it's just right.

160
00:07:35,072 --> 00:07:38,157
Why, it's just a...
real good day.

161
00:07:38,192 --> 00:07:41,544
Just a... a real good day.

162
00:08:03,432 --> 00:08:05,318
Well, howdy, anthony.

163
00:08:05,935 --> 00:08:08,437
I was looking for you
a bit ago.

164
00:08:08,472 --> 00:08:11,574
Your mama said you
was out in the barn.

165
00:08:11,609 --> 00:08:13,442
I was looking
at the cow.

166
00:08:13,477 --> 00:08:14,694
Oh, oh, that's good.

167
00:08:14,729 --> 00:08:16,579
That's... real good

168
00:08:16,614 --> 00:08:18,447
that you were looking
at the cow.

169
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:20,333
Now, uh...

170
00:08:20,368 --> 00:08:22,835
you weren't playing any
tricks on your old dad,

171
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,086
were you?

172
00:08:24,121 --> 00:08:27,840
I mean, remember last year when
you... when we had the pigs?

173
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:30,343
I turned them into monsters.

174
00:08:30,378 --> 00:08:31,844
Oh, doggone
if you didn't.

175
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:33,713
Funny looking
things, too.

176
00:08:34,964 --> 00:08:37,466
But good things, anthony,
real good things

177
00:08:37,501 --> 00:08:39,352
and it's good
that you done that.

178
00:08:39,387 --> 00:08:40,603
Oh, it's real good.

179
00:08:40,638 --> 00:08:42,471
Television night
tonight.

180
00:08:42,506 --> 00:08:44,974
I'm going to make
television for everybody.

181
00:08:45,009 --> 00:08:48,110
Oh, you sure are, and
everybody is looking
forward to it, too.

182
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:51,230
Just like they do
every week when you
make television.

183
00:08:51,265 --> 00:08:53,115
And we're going to have

184
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:55,618
that surprise birthday party
for dan hollis, too.

185
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,877
Was you looking
for something, anthony?

186
00:09:04,912 --> 00:09:06,746
Could i get you

187
00:09:06,781 --> 00:09:08,130
something, son?

188
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:13,753
No kids came over to play
with me today.

189
00:09:13,788 --> 00:09:15,004
Not a single one.

190
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:17,506
And i wanted someone
to play with.

191
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:20,259
Oh, well, anthony,
you remember the last time

192
00:09:20,294 --> 00:09:21,510
some kids came over to play-

193
00:09:21,545 --> 00:09:24,013
the little fredericks boy
and his sister?

194
00:09:24,048 --> 00:09:26,515
I had a real
good time.

195
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:28,401
Oh, sure, you did.
You had a real good time,

196
00:09:29,018 --> 00:09:30,903
and it's good
that you have a good time.

197
00:09:30,938 --> 00:09:32,772
It's real good.

198
00:09:32,807 --> 00:09:35,274
It's, uh, just that...

199
00:09:36,525 --> 00:09:38,411
just that what?

200
00:09:38,446 --> 00:09:41,530
Well, anthony, you, uh...

201
00:09:41,565 --> 00:09:44,033
you wished them away
into the cornfield

202
00:09:44,068 --> 00:09:47,169
and their mommy and daddy
were real upset.

203
00:09:47,204 --> 00:09:48,537
About what?

204
00:09:48,572 --> 00:09:52,675
Well, it's just that if you
wish people away like that

205
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:55,177
there won't be no one left.

206
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,302
Maybe next week we'll talk
to some of the folks

207
00:10:03,337 --> 00:10:05,187
about bringing
their children over.

208
00:10:05,554 --> 00:10:06,806
We'll do that,
won't we?

209
00:10:06,841 --> 00:10:09,308
And i can make
some of those
funny animals, dad.

210
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:12,445
Yeah, yeah... it's fun,
it's lots of fun to do.

211
00:10:14,982 --> 00:10:17,066
That's bill soames' collie.

212
00:10:17,101 --> 00:10:19,568
That's that dog
that comes around.

213
00:10:19,603 --> 00:10:23,205
Yeah, yeah, that
does sound like
bill soames' dog.

214
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,457
Not many dogs left
now, anthony.

215
00:10:24,492 --> 00:10:27,827
You... why, you wished
them all away.

216
00:10:27,862 --> 00:10:29,078
I don't like them.

217
00:10:29,113 --> 00:10:30,963
They didn't like me.

218
00:10:30,998 --> 00:10:32,832
I hate anybody like that.

219
00:10:32,867 --> 00:10:35,334
I hate anybody
that doesn't like me.

220
00:10:35,369 --> 00:10:37,720
Why, everybody
loves you, anthony.

221
00:10:37,755 --> 00:10:38,971
Theyloveyou, son.

222
00:10:39,006 --> 00:10:40,840
You're everybody's favorite.

223
00:10:42,126 --> 00:10:44,226
I heard somebody think
one time-

224
00:10:44,261 --> 00:10:46,729
i don't remember when,
but sometime-

225
00:10:46,764 --> 00:10:50,483
that i shouldn't wish away
all the automobiles and things

226
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,351
and electricity.

227
00:10:52,386 --> 00:10:55,488
They said that it wasn't good
that i did that.

228
00:10:55,523 --> 00:10:57,356
Somebody thought that one time.

229
00:10:57,391 --> 00:10:59,241
Who? Who thought that?

230
00:10:59,276 --> 00:11:00,609
Oh, why,
that was, uh...

231
00:11:00,644 --> 00:11:03,746
teddy reynolds who thought that.

232
00:11:03,781 --> 00:11:05,614
He owned the farm
up the road.

233
00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:08,751
He shouldn't have thought
those bad thoughts!

234
00:11:08,786 --> 00:11:10,619
That's why i made him
go on fire.

235
00:11:14,408 --> 00:11:15,007
That dog.

236
00:11:15,624 --> 00:11:17,510
That collie dog.

237
00:11:17,545 --> 00:11:19,512
He doesn't like me.

238
00:11:19,547 --> 00:11:21,380
He's abaddog.

239
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:33,025
Anthony?

240
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:36,779
Did you do something
to bill soames' dog?

241
00:11:36,814 --> 00:11:37,396
Did you, son?

242
00:11:37,431 --> 00:11:40,533
I put him in the cornfield.

243
00:11:40,568 --> 00:11:43,035
He isn't outside anymore.

244
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,543
Bill soames' collie was
out in the yard.

245
00:11:50,578 --> 00:11:51,794
Why, anthony put him
in the cornfield.

246
00:11:51,829 --> 00:11:54,296
Isn't it a real good thing
that he done that, honey?

247
00:11:54,331 --> 00:11:55,548
Isn't it a real good thing?

248
00:11:57,451 --> 00:11:59,919
Yes, it was a
real good thing...

249
00:11:59,954 --> 00:12:01,170
that he done that.

250
00:12:01,205 --> 00:12:02,421
It was a real good thing.

251
00:13:04,099 --> 00:13:06,602
That's all the television
there is.

252
00:13:06,637 --> 00:13:09,104
Oh, it was
wonderful, anthony.

253
00:13:09,139 --> 00:13:09,738
Wasn't it,
everyone?

254
00:13:09,773 --> 00:13:10,990
Oh, that was
real good.

255
00:13:11,025 --> 00:13:12,241
That was real good.

256
00:13:12,276 --> 00:13:14,109
Wasn't anthony's television
wonderful tonight?

257
00:13:14,144 --> 00:13:15,361
Oh, it was
just the best.

258
00:13:15,396 --> 00:13:17,863
It was much better than
the old television.

259
00:13:17,898 --> 00:13:19,748
Much better.

260
00:13:19,783 --> 00:13:21,617
And now, the
big surprise

261
00:13:21,652 --> 00:13:23,502
for dan's
birthday.

262
00:13:24,119 --> 00:13:25,371
Go ahead, ethel.

263
00:13:25,406 --> 00:13:27,873
Give your
hubby the
big surprise.

264
00:13:29,758 --> 00:13:31,627
What's this?

265
00:13:40,135 --> 00:13:43,272
Oh, perry como!

266
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:47,026
Why, i haven't
heard perry como

267
00:13:47,061 --> 00:13:48,277
in years and years.

268
00:13:48,312 --> 00:13:50,779
Happy birthday,
darling.

269
00:13:50,814 --> 00:13:52,031
Happy birthday.

270
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:54,283
Hey... you better
be careful.

271
00:13:54,318 --> 00:13:56,151
I'm holding a
priceless object.

272
00:13:56,186 --> 00:13:59,905
Look, do you think
we could play it?

273
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,790
Gosh, what i'd give to hear

274
00:14:01,825 --> 00:14:03,158
some new music.

275
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:10,549
Well, just
the first part-

276
00:14:10,584 --> 00:14:11,800
the orchestra part

277
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:14,920
before como
sings.

278
00:14:16,305 --> 00:14:18,674
I don't think we'd better, dan.

279
00:14:18,709 --> 00:14:22,428
After all, we don't know
just where the singing comes in.

280
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:24,930
It'd be taking
too much of a chance.

281
00:14:24,965 --> 00:14:27,433
Better wait till
you get home.

282
00:14:30,686 --> 00:14:33,439
It's good i can't
play it here.

283
00:14:33,474 --> 00:14:35,941
Oh, yes,
it's good.

284
00:14:35,976 --> 00:14:38,444
It's very good.

285
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:45,200
Uh, and now it's
time for pat riley
to play the piano.

286
00:14:45,235 --> 00:14:47,703
Uh... pat?

287
00:14:47,738 --> 00:14:48,337
My pleasure.

288
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:19,868
It would be good
if you told me

289
00:15:19,903 --> 00:15:22,121
what to play,
anthony.

290
00:15:22,371 --> 00:15:24,239
It would be real good
if you'd tell me

291
00:15:24,274 --> 00:15:26,125
what music you'd
like to hear.

292
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,627
Just play-
play anything.

293
00:15:28,662 --> 00:15:30,496
All right.

294
00:15:30,531 --> 00:15:33,632
All right,
i'll play, uh...

295
00:15:33,667 --> 00:15:34,883
i'll play
"moonglow."

296
00:15:34,918 --> 00:15:37,386
That's a nice
old tune.

297
00:15:37,421 --> 00:15:38,637
Oh, that's
a nice tune.

298
00:15:38,672 --> 00:15:40,506
Oh, yes, that's
a very good tune.

299
00:15:59,443 --> 00:16:01,910
Don't make any noise
when the music's playing.

300
00:16:01,945 --> 00:16:05,030
I don't like any noise
when the music's playing.

301
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:38,313
Dan...

302
00:16:38,348 --> 00:16:40,199
dan, please.

303
00:16:40,234 --> 00:16:40,816
Please what?

304
00:16:40,851 --> 00:16:42,701
I'm not doing anything.

305
00:16:42,736 --> 00:16:44,570
I'm just drinking
this peach brandy.

306
00:16:44,605 --> 00:16:47,072
I'm just drinking
one of my birthday presents,

307
00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:48,323
that's all i'm doing.

308
00:16:49,825 --> 00:16:52,961
Dan, please, for
the love of heaven

309
00:16:52,996 --> 00:16:54,213
please don't
say anything.

310
00:16:54,248 --> 00:16:56,081
Who's saying
anything?

311
00:16:56,116 --> 00:16:57,332
I'm not saying
anything.

312
00:16:57,367 --> 00:17:01,086
I'm not saying
anything at all!

313
00:17:04,374 --> 00:17:05,591
Go ahead,
pat, play.

314
00:17:05,626 --> 00:17:07,476
Go on, keep
playing.

315
00:17:21,356 --> 00:17:24,493
You know, this is
real good brandy.

316
00:17:24,528 --> 00:17:25,744
Real good.

317
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:30,115
You folks know something?

318
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:34,503
There's only five bottles
of real whiskey left

319
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,005
in the whole village.

320
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,508
Only five bottles.

321
00:17:39,543 --> 00:17:41,376
There's one rye...

322
00:17:41,411 --> 00:17:43,262
two scotch,

323
00:17:43,297 --> 00:17:45,764
one after-dinner
liqueur and...

324
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:49,635
and this here.

325
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:51,520
When that's all gone...

326
00:17:51,555 --> 00:17:55,891
there won't be any...
any whiskey left at all.

327
00:17:57,142 --> 00:17:59,645
None at all.

328
00:18:00,931 --> 00:18:02,781
No whiskey at all.

329
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:10,405
Nuts! I can't even
play my own record.

330
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,291
I can't even play perry como!

331
00:18:30,058 --> 00:18:32,561
Don't play that, pat.

332
00:18:34,429 --> 00:18:36,932
That's not what
i want you to play.

333
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:40,068
Play this-

334
00:18:41,069 --> 00:18:44,823
? happy birthday to me?

335
00:18:44,858 --> 00:18:46,692

336
00:18:46,727 --> 00:18:49,077

337
00:18:49,112 --> 00:18:50,946
Dan!

338
00:18:50,981 --> 00:18:52,197
? dear danny?
Please stop!

339
00:18:52,232 --> 00:18:53,448
Be quiet.

340
00:18:53,483 --> 00:18:55,334
Please stop!

341
00:18:55,369 --> 00:18:57,703
? happy birthday to me.?

342
00:19:00,455 --> 00:19:01,707
Play it, pat.

343
00:19:01,742 --> 00:19:03,842
Play it so i
can sing right.

344
00:19:03,877 --> 00:19:06,962
You know i can't
carry a tune

345
00:19:06,997 --> 00:19:08,847
unless somebody
plays it.

346
00:19:25,148 --> 00:19:26,982
You...

347
00:19:28,984 --> 00:19:31,486
you and her, you had him.

348
00:19:31,521 --> 00:19:34,489
You had to
go have him.

349
00:19:38,278 --> 00:19:41,380
? you are my sunshine?

350
00:19:41,415 --> 00:19:43,498
? my only
sunshine?

351
00:19:43,533 --> 00:19:46,001
? you make
me happy?

352
00:19:46,036 --> 00:19:49,137
? when i
am blue...?

353
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,508
You monster,
you.

354
00:19:53,543 --> 00:19:56,645
You dirty little
monster.

355
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,896
You murderer.

356
00:20:01,685 --> 00:20:03,018
You think about me.

357
00:20:03,652 --> 00:20:04,903
Go ahead, anthony.

358
00:20:06,154 --> 00:20:10,525
You think
bad thoughts
about me...

359
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,528
and maybe some man
in this room...

360
00:20:13,563 --> 00:20:15,414
some man with guts...

361
00:20:17,032 --> 00:20:18,917
somebody who's
so sick to death

362
00:20:18,952 --> 00:20:20,786
of living in this
kind of place

363
00:20:20,821 --> 00:20:23,288
and willing to
take a chance

364
00:20:23,323 --> 00:20:25,173
will sneak up
behind you

365
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:28,293
and lay
something heavy
across your skull

366
00:20:28,328 --> 00:20:31,046
and end this once and for all!

367
00:20:31,081 --> 00:20:33,432
You're a bad man!

368
00:20:33,467 --> 00:20:35,934
You're a very bad man!

369
00:20:35,969 --> 00:20:38,437
You think that.

370
00:20:38,472 --> 00:20:41,556
Go ahead, anthony,
i'm a very bad man.

371
00:20:41,591 --> 00:20:44,059
Keep thinking
that.

372
00:20:44,094 --> 00:20:46,561
Somebody sneak
up behind him.

373
00:20:46,596 --> 00:20:48,447
Somebody end
this now!

374
00:20:48,482 --> 00:20:50,949
While he's thinking
about me!

375
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:02,961
Won't somebody
take a lamp or a bottle

376
00:21:02,996 --> 00:21:04,830
or something and end this?

377
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:07,332
You're a bad man.

378
00:21:07,367 --> 00:21:08,583
You're a very bad man,

379
00:21:08,618 --> 00:21:11,086
and you keep thinking
bad thoughts

380
00:21:11,121 --> 00:21:12,337
about me.

381
00:21:26,101 --> 00:21:27,986
Wish it into
the cornfield.

382
00:21:28,021 --> 00:21:31,106
Please, son, wish it into
the cornfield, please.

383
00:21:40,283 --> 00:21:41,500
He was a bad man

384
00:21:41,535 --> 00:21:44,619
so i turned him into
a jack-in-the-box,

385
00:21:44,654 --> 00:21:47,756
a jack-in-the-box that
still had his bad face.

386
00:21:50,258 --> 00:21:53,378
And you mustn't think bad
thoughts about me, either,

387
00:21:53,413 --> 00:21:56,515
or i'll do the same
thing to you.

388
00:22:00,886 --> 00:22:04,022
Play some
more music.

389
00:22:04,057 --> 00:22:05,891
It's good what
you done to dan.

390
00:22:05,926 --> 00:22:06,525
It's real good.

391
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,393
That was swell.

392
00:22:08,428 --> 00:22:10,278
It was just swell.

393
00:22:10,313 --> 00:22:13,398
That was...
really good.

394
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:24,159
I kind of liked it
a little bit better

395
00:22:24,194 --> 00:22:26,661
when we had cities
outside and...

396
00:22:26,696 --> 00:22:29,164
and we could get
real television...

397
00:22:31,084 --> 00:22:32,918
things like that.

398
00:22:32,953 --> 00:22:34,803
Amy, it's...
it's real good

399
00:22:34,838 --> 00:22:37,305
for you to say
such a thing.

400
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:39,174
It's real good.

401
00:22:39,209 --> 00:22:41,676
But how can
you mean it?

402
00:22:41,711 --> 00:22:44,813
Why, anthony's
television is
much better

403
00:22:44,848 --> 00:22:47,315
than anything we
ever used to get.

404
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:48,567
Oh, yes,
it's fine.

405
00:22:48,602 --> 00:22:49,818
Why, anthony's
television

406
00:22:50,435 --> 00:22:52,320
is the best television
we've ever seen.

407
00:23:00,829 --> 00:23:02,697
It's snowing
outside.

408
00:23:06,334 --> 00:23:08,203
Anthony, are...
are you making it snow?

409
00:23:08,238 --> 00:23:10,455
Yes, i'm making
it snow.

410
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:11,706
Why, that will
ruin half the crops!

411
00:23:11,741 --> 00:23:12,958
You know that,
don't you?

412
00:23:12,993 --> 00:23:14,843
Half the crops,
that's what that'll...
dad...

413
00:23:18,346 --> 00:23:21,466
but it's good that you're
making it snow, anthony.

414
00:23:21,501 --> 00:23:22,100
It's real good.

415
00:23:22,135 --> 00:23:23,852
And tomorrow...

416
00:23:23,887 --> 00:23:26,972
tomorrow is
going to be
a real good day.

417
00:23:30,725 --> 00:23:33,228
No comment here,
no comment at all.

418
00:23:33,263 --> 00:23:35,730
We only wanted to introduce you

419
00:23:35,765 --> 00:23:38,233
to one of our very
special citizens-

420
00:23:38,268 --> 00:23:40,118
little anthony fremont,
age six,

421
00:23:40,153 --> 00:23:42,621
who lives in a village
called peaksville,

422
00:23:43,238 --> 00:23:45,123
in a place
that used to be ohio.

423
00:23:45,158 --> 00:23:48,743
And if by some strange chance
you should run across him

424
00:23:48,778 --> 00:23:51,246
you had best think
only good thoughts.

425
00:23:51,281 --> 00:23:54,382
Anything less than that
is handled at your own risk.

426
00:23:54,417 --> 00:23:58,753
Because if you do meet anthony
you can be sure of one thing-

427
00:23:58,788 --> 00:24:01,256
you have entered
the twilight zone.

428
00:24:11,433 --> 00:24:14,569
Rod serling,
creator ofthe twilight zone,

429
00:24:14,604 --> 00:24:18,323
will tell you about next week's
story after this message.

430
00:24:19,591 --> 00:24:21,092
And now, mr. Serling.

431
00:24:21,127 --> 00:24:23,995
This is the lobby of an inn
in a small bavarian town,

432
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:27,115
and next week, we'll enter it
with a former s.s. Officer.

433
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:29,000
It's the first stop
on his road back

434
00:24:29,035 --> 00:24:31,503
to relive a horror
that was nazi germany.

435
00:24:31,538 --> 00:24:34,623
Mr. Joseph schildkraut
and mr. Oscar beregi demonstrate

436
00:24:34,658 --> 00:24:37,759
what happens to the monster
when it is judged by the victim.

437
00:24:37,794 --> 00:24:39,010
Our feeling here
is that this is

438
00:24:39,045 --> 00:24:42,130
as stark and moving a piece of
drama as we've ever presented.

439
00:24:42,165 --> 00:24:44,015
I very much hope
that you're around

440
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:45,267
to make your own judgment.

441
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:18,083
Faith is for those
who look for it,

442
00:25:18,118 --> 00:25:20,585
who try each day
to know it better.

443
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:24,339
Worship together every week
at your church or synagogue.
