1
00:00:10,477 --> 00:00:12,979
You're traveling
through another dimension-

2
00:00:13,014 --> 00:00:16,116
a dimension not only of sight
and sound, but of mind.

3
00:00:16,733 --> 00:00:17,984
A journey into a wondrous land

4
00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:19,869
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

5
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:21,621
That's the signpost up ahead.

6
00:00:21,656 --> 00:00:24,124
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

7
00:00:58,908 --> 00:01:00,777
How long is this
going to take?

8
00:01:00,812 --> 00:01:03,279
Like i told you, nobody
stocks fuel pumps around town.

9
00:01:03,314 --> 00:01:05,165
I'll have to send
into dayton for it.

10
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,033
How long will that take?

11
00:01:07,068 --> 00:01:08,284
Oh, three, four hours.

12
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:10,170
Better figure
on four, to play safe.

13
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:15,175
Four hours?

14
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:15,792
Crazy.

15
00:01:16,426 --> 00:01:17,043
Let's get
some lunch.

16
00:01:17,078 --> 00:01:19,546
Lunch? We can homestead.

17
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:23,933
June, croon, honeymoon.

18
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:26,436
Quiet.

19
00:01:26,471 --> 00:01:28,938
Don't think i should phone
the office again, huh?

20
00:01:28,973 --> 00:01:30,807
You are going
to lose that promotion

21
00:01:31,441 --> 00:01:32,692
if you keep
pestering them, lover.

22
00:01:32,727 --> 00:01:33,943
I'm going to
lose it anyway.

23
00:01:33,978 --> 00:01:35,195
Ah, that's
a fine way to talk.

24
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:37,063
And i thought i married
a man with confidence.

25
00:01:37,098 --> 00:01:38,948
And who is
the best man for the job?

26
00:01:38,983 --> 00:01:39,566
Me, but...

27
00:01:39,601 --> 00:01:40,817
but?

28
00:01:40,852 --> 00:01:42,068
But thompson
has seniority.

29
00:01:42,103 --> 00:01:43,319
Aw! Doesn't mean a thing.

30
00:01:43,354 --> 00:01:45,205
Little miss sunshine.

31
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,072
That's me.

32
00:01:46,107 --> 00:01:47,957
Bread and butter.

33
00:01:47,992 --> 00:01:49,209
Yes, dear.

34
00:01:49,244 --> 00:01:51,077
Just trying
to save your life.

35
00:02:02,972 --> 00:02:04,224
Shall we?

36
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:06,726
Let's have
some music, don.

37
00:02:06,761 --> 00:02:07,977
Great.

38
00:02:25,495 --> 00:02:28,615
I thought we came
in here to eat.

39
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:29,866
Yes, we did.

40
00:02:32,368 --> 00:02:33,620
Shall we sit here?

41
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:38,625
Well, what have
we got here?

42
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,876
"The mystic seer."

43
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:41,127
The what?

44
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:43,012
Let's try it, shall we?

45
00:02:43,047 --> 00:02:44,264
Have you got
a penny, honey?

46
00:02:44,299 --> 00:02:45,515
I think so.

47
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:46,766
What'll we ask it?

48
00:02:46,801 --> 00:02:48,017
I don't know.

49
00:02:48,052 --> 00:02:49,886
I got it.

50
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,771
What?

51
00:02:51,806 --> 00:02:54,891
Does anything exciting
ever happen around here?

52
00:02:59,896 --> 00:03:01,281
"It is quite possible."

53
00:03:01,898 --> 00:03:04,400
The hand belongs
to mr. Don s. Carter,

54
00:03:04,435 --> 00:03:06,903
male member
of a honeymoon team

55
00:03:06,938 --> 00:03:11,908
en route across the ohio
countryside to new york city.

56
00:03:13,409 --> 00:03:15,912
In one moment,
they will be subjected

57
00:03:15,947 --> 00:03:19,048
to a gift most humans
never receive in a lifetime.

58
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:22,802
For one penny, they'll be able
to look into the future.

59
00:03:22,837 --> 00:03:27,173
The time is now, the place is a
little diner in ridgeview, ohio,

60
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:29,676
and what this young couple
doesn't realize

61
00:03:29,711 --> 00:03:32,178
is that this town happens to lie

62
00:03:32,213 --> 00:03:34,681
on the outskirts
of the twilight zone.

63
00:03:38,101 --> 00:03:39,352
Howdy.

64
00:03:39,387 --> 00:03:40,603
Howdy.
Hello.

65
00:03:40,638 --> 00:03:41,854
What'll it be?

66
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:44,991
I think i'll have a tomato
and lettuce on whole wheat

67
00:03:45,608 --> 00:03:46,859
and some
iced coffee, please.

68
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:48,111
I'll have the same.

69
00:03:48,146 --> 00:03:49,362
I've got
some very good

70
00:03:49,397 --> 00:03:51,247
chicken-fried
steak out there.

71
00:03:51,282 --> 00:03:52,498
No, thank you.

72
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:53,750
No?
No.

73
00:03:53,785 --> 00:03:55,001
You finished
with that?

74
00:03:55,618 --> 00:03:56,869
Yes.

75
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:01,257
Oh!

76
00:04:01,292 --> 00:04:02,508
Good, hmm?

77
00:04:02,543 --> 00:04:05,011
Great. He must have
siphoned it out of a swamp.

78
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:08,765
What are you doing?

79
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,633
Getting some pennies.

80
00:04:10,668 --> 00:04:13,770
What are you going
to ask it now?

81
00:04:13,805 --> 00:04:15,638
What else?

82
00:04:15,673 --> 00:04:20,026
Am i going to be promoted, for pete's sake.

83
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:24,147
Hey, look.

84
00:04:24,182 --> 00:04:25,898
What?

85
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:27,784
"It has been decided
in your favor."

86
00:04:27,819 --> 00:04:30,286
Ah! You see,
your worries are over.

87
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,908
I think i'll phone.

88
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:37,160
Honey...

89
00:04:37,195 --> 00:04:39,045
well, i was
going to anyway.

90
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,296
Wasn't i?

91
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:51,674
Hello,
operator?

92
00:04:51,709 --> 00:04:53,559
Give me
main 1-8-9-9-7

93
00:04:53,594 --> 00:04:54,811
in saint louis,
please.

94
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,182
That's
right.

95
00:05:00,468 --> 00:05:02,819
How much?

96
00:05:02,854 --> 00:05:05,321
75 cents?

97
00:05:05,356 --> 00:05:07,940
Honey, you got another quarter on you?

98
00:05:15,331 --> 00:05:17,200
Is this call necessary?

99
00:05:17,235 --> 00:05:19,085
Here you are, operator.

100
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,341
Hello.

101
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:29,095
Connect me with mr.
Welden's secretary, please.

102
00:05:29,712 --> 00:05:31,597
Keep your
fingers crossed.

103
00:05:31,632 --> 00:05:33,466
I'm doing it up here.

104
00:05:35,351 --> 00:05:37,220
Hello.

105
00:05:37,255 --> 00:05:39,722
Hello, pauline?

106
00:05:39,757 --> 00:05:40,973
It's don.

107
00:05:42,225 --> 00:05:44,727
Fine. Fine. And you?

108
00:05:44,762 --> 00:05:47,113
What's the secret word, pauline?

109
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:50,233
I did?

110
00:05:50,268 --> 00:05:52,118
I made it.

111
00:05:52,153 --> 00:05:53,369
Oh...

112
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:55,238
thank you, pauline.

113
00:05:55,273 --> 00:05:58,991
Yes, we'll send you a
postcard from new york.

114
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:00,877
As soon as we arrive.

115
00:06:00,912 --> 00:06:02,745
Good-bye,
and same to you.

116
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:03,996
Good-bye.

117
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,248
I made it.

118
00:06:05,283 --> 00:06:07,133
Oh, darling,
i'm so proud of you.

119
00:06:07,168 --> 00:06:08,384
You're now looking

120
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:10,887
at the world's youngest
office manager.

121
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:13,389
And i'm happy to say
i told you so.

122
00:06:13,424 --> 00:06:14,640
And so has he.

123
00:06:14,675 --> 00:06:16,509
Yeah? Well,
i told you first.

124
00:06:16,544 --> 00:06:18,394
I think we ought
to celebrate.

125
00:06:18,429 --> 00:06:20,263
Here's a dime
for the jukebox.

126
00:06:20,298 --> 00:06:22,765
Some success music.

127
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,016
Or "the triumphal march."

128
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:27,153
Don't know that
i can find it here.

129
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:32,775
Crazy.

130
00:06:35,278 --> 00:06:35,912
Oh.

131
00:06:40,283 --> 00:06:41,534
Thank you.

132
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:43,419
You ain't going
to like this

133
00:06:43,454 --> 00:06:45,922
as much as you would
that chicken-fried steak.

134
00:06:45,957 --> 00:06:47,173
We'll bear up.

135
00:06:52,795 --> 00:06:54,680
Ah...

136
00:06:54,715 --> 00:06:55,932
office manager.

137
00:06:55,967 --> 00:06:57,800
I think it's wonderful.

138
00:06:57,835 --> 00:06:59,685
Let's ask him
something else.

139
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,554
He really came
through on that one.

140
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:04,056
Why don't you ask him
why he didn't warn us

141
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,559
that the whole-wheat
bread is stale?

142
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:09,061
"Does he/she
love me?"

143
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:11,697
I know the answer
to that one, huh?

144
00:07:11,732 --> 00:07:12,949
"Will i become rich?"

145
00:07:12,984 --> 00:07:14,817
I know the answer
to that one, too.

146
00:07:15,451 --> 00:07:17,954
I'm going to be the world's
first millionaire accountant.

147
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:19,205
Office manager.

148
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,456
Right.

149
00:07:20,491 --> 00:07:22,959
Is it really going
to be four hours

150
00:07:22,994 --> 00:07:24,210
before we get
out of here?

151
00:07:30,466 --> 00:07:31,717
"You may never know."

152
00:07:31,752 --> 00:07:32,969
What does that mean?

153
00:07:33,004 --> 00:07:34,220
Who knows?

154
00:07:34,255 --> 00:07:35,338
He does.

155
00:07:35,373 --> 00:07:36,589
Mm-hmm...

156
00:07:36,624 --> 00:07:39,091
but it'll cost you
another penny.

157
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:40,343
I'm an office
manager now.

158
00:07:40,977 --> 00:07:42,845
What do you mean,
"we may never know"?

159
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,348
No, that's not a "yes"
or "no" question.

160
00:07:45,982 --> 00:07:48,484
You mean something will
keep us from knowing?

161
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:50,853
Something will
happen to us?

162
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:54,357
"If you move soon."

163
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,996
What does that mean?

164
00:08:00,031 --> 00:08:01,247
Well, he's a mystic.

165
00:08:01,282 --> 00:08:02,498
What do you expect?

166
00:08:05,653 --> 00:08:08,120
Oh, i can see
i'm going to have to be

167
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:10,006
the frugal one
in our family.

168
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:11,257
Just one more.

169
00:08:11,292 --> 00:08:13,759
You mean, if we're
not supposed to move,

170
00:08:13,794 --> 00:08:16,262
we're supposed
to stay here?

171
00:08:16,297 --> 00:08:19,382
Just one question
per penny, please.

172
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:28,891
"That makes a good
deal of sense."

173
00:08:32,528 --> 00:08:33,145
How long should...

174
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:35,648
no, uh...

175
00:08:35,683 --> 00:08:37,149
should we stay here

176
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:39,151
until 2:30?

177
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:45,408
"Try again."

178
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:51,664
Should we stay
in here until 3:00?

179
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:59,171
"There's no question
about it."

180
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:09,565
Don, let's take a look
around the town, hmm?

181
00:09:11,067 --> 00:09:12,935
Every answer seems to fit.

182
00:09:16,439 --> 00:09:18,324
You're joking,
aren't you?

183
00:09:18,359 --> 00:09:19,942
I mean...

184
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:21,193
don, no more.

185
00:09:25,081 --> 00:09:27,199
If we don't stay
in here until 3:00,

186
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:29,702
something bad
will happen to us?

187
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:34,590
Oh, don,
for heaven's sakes.

188
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:35,841
Read it.

189
00:09:38,961 --> 00:09:41,464
"Do you dare risk
finding out?"

190
00:09:43,966 --> 00:09:46,469
Don, let's go.

191
00:09:46,504 --> 00:09:49,221
Well, i haven't finished
my sandwich yet.

192
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:54,226
Don't you want
some ice cream?

193
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:35,484
Can we go now?

194
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,987
Don't you want
something cold to drink?

195
00:10:38,022 --> 00:10:40,489
Please, let's go.

196
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:48,247
All right.

197
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:57,006
Say, can
i have my check?

198
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:58,874
You don't need a check.

199
00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:00,126
I know what you had.

200
00:11:00,161 --> 00:11:01,377
80 cents,

201
00:11:01,412 --> 00:11:04,513
$1.10,
$1.60,

202
00:11:04,548 --> 00:11:05,765
with three cents tax.

203
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,016
Here. Keep the change.

204
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:08,267
Well, thanks.

205
00:11:08,302 --> 00:11:09,518
And come
on back, now.

206
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:22,031
Hot, hot, hot.

207
00:11:22,066 --> 00:11:23,282
Yeah.

208
00:11:24,533 --> 00:11:26,402
Maybe it won't take
them four hours

209
00:11:26,437 --> 00:11:27,653
to fix the car.
You think?

210
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:29,538
Maybe.

211
00:11:29,573 --> 00:11:31,407
Don, you didn't
really want

212
00:11:31,442 --> 00:11:33,292
to stay in there,
did you?

213
00:11:33,327 --> 00:11:34,543
No.

214
00:11:34,578 --> 00:11:35,795
Honest?

215
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:37,663
Well, why was
it so specific?

216
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:38,914
Specific?

217
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:39,548
Sweetie...

218
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:40,800
"if you move soon."

219
00:11:40,835 --> 00:11:42,668
"That makes a
good deal of sense."

220
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:44,553
"Try again."
"There's no question about it."

221
00:11:44,588 --> 00:11:45,805
"You may never know."

222
00:11:46,422 --> 00:11:47,673
"Do you dare risk finding out?"

223
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:49,558
Don, it's just
a napkin holder

224
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:54,063
in a little cafe
in ridgeview, ohio.

225
00:11:54,098 --> 00:11:56,565
Oh, i know,
i know.

226
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,434
All right, what about
my promotion, then?

227
00:11:58,469 --> 00:12:02,188
Didn't it tell me, "it has
been decided in your favor"?

228
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:04,190
Isn't
that...?

229
00:12:05,941 --> 00:12:06,575
Oh, forget it.

230
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:09,078
I suppose i'm just being stupid.

231
00:12:09,113 --> 00:12:10,696
No, you're not.

232
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:11,947
You're just...

233
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:13,199
don't say it.

234
00:12:13,234 --> 00:12:15,334
Superstitious.

235
00:12:15,369 --> 00:12:19,088
It's like you married
an alcoholic, isn't it?

236
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:23,459
Only, instead of bottles
in the chandelier,

237
00:12:23,494 --> 00:12:24,710
it's rabbits' feet

238
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:26,095
and four-leaf
clovers

239
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:27,963
in my pockets,
in the car...

240
00:12:27,998 --> 00:12:29,215
and...

241
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,966
and you're all mine.

242
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:38,474
Whatareyou doing?

243
00:12:39,108 --> 00:12:39,725
What?

244
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,610
Well, you keep
looking around as if...

245
00:12:41,645 --> 00:12:42,862
do i?

246
00:12:42,897 --> 00:12:44,113
Youareworried.

247
00:12:44,148 --> 00:12:45,981
You're worried
about that...

248
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:49,118
oh, don, i wonder
when you act like this.

249
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:52,371
I'm sorry. I'm not trying
to upset you.

250
00:12:52,406 --> 00:12:53,489
I know you're not.

251
00:12:53,524 --> 00:12:54,740
Doesn't change
the facts, though.

252
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:55,991
What facts?

253
00:12:56,026 --> 00:12:56,625
Six straight answers.

254
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:58,494
Oh, don, please!

255
00:12:59,128 --> 00:13:00,996
Oh, stop treating me like
a retarded child or something.

256
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:02,248
I didn't make
those answers up.

257
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,001
Wait, don.
Wait.

258
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:07,753
We can
make it.

259
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:25,654
You all right?

260
00:13:25,689 --> 00:13:26,906
Quite a moment.

261
00:13:26,941 --> 00:13:28,774
If you hadn't pulled me

262
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:30,025
out of the way
of that car,

263
00:13:30,659 --> 00:13:31,911
one squashed honeymooner.

264
00:13:31,946 --> 00:13:33,162
Come on.

265
00:13:37,533 --> 00:13:40,669
Well, where
are we going now?

266
00:13:40,704 --> 00:13:43,172
Oh, we're not going
back to that...

267
00:13:43,207 --> 00:13:44,423
why not?

268
00:13:45,674 --> 00:13:48,177
All right, i admit it was
a strange coincidence.

269
00:13:48,212 --> 00:13:49,428
If it was a coincidence,

270
00:13:50,045 --> 00:13:52,548
what are you worrying
about us going back, then?

271
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:53,182
I'm not.

272
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:55,050
So stop worrying.

273
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:00,689
Just the same,
you will admit that,

274
00:14:00,724 --> 00:14:03,809
for a coincidence, it
was pretty far-fetched.

275
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:05,060
Maybe.

276
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:39,895
Well, someone's
sitting in front

277
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:42,398
of our mystic seer.

278
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:47,403
Don?

279
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:52,408
Why don't you
try this one,

280
00:14:52,443 --> 00:14:53,659
or one of the others?

281
00:14:53,694 --> 00:14:55,527
I'm sure that...

282
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:03,919
don?

283
00:15:03,954 --> 00:15:05,788
What?

284
00:15:05,823 --> 00:15:07,039
Look at me.

285
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:12,044
Well, you... you really
don't think that that...

286
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,180
that gizmo can
foretell the future, do you?

287
00:15:15,215 --> 00:15:16,432
It foretold ours.

288
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:22,054
How? How did it?

289
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:23,939
Well, back already.
What will you have?

290
00:15:23,974 --> 00:15:25,808
Honey?

291
00:15:25,843 --> 00:15:27,059
Oh, i'll have some iced coffee, please.

292
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:28,310
And how about you?

293
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:30,813
The same.

294
00:15:30,848 --> 00:15:33,949
Um... all right, how?

295
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,703
When that car almost hit us, it was 3:00-

296
00:15:37,738 --> 00:15:39,571
exactly when
that machine said.

297
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:43,325
Don, yousaid 3:00,
not the machine.

298
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,828
Youdecided
to sit in here

299
00:15:45,863 --> 00:15:48,330
as long as we did. You.

300
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:50,215
Oh, this is ridiculous.

301
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:53,335
Can't you see that
youmade up all the details,

302
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:55,220
and all that that...
that thing did

303
00:15:55,255 --> 00:15:56,472
was give back
generalities?

304
00:15:56,507 --> 00:15:58,340
What are you getting
so upset about?

305
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,843
You. That you could
even consider the possibility...

306
00:16:00,878 --> 00:16:02,728
will... will
you listen...?

307
00:16:02,763 --> 00:16:03,979
Will you listen?

308
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:08,851
Excuse me.

309
00:16:08,886 --> 00:16:10,102
Yes?

310
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:11,353
Can you give
me some pennies?

311
00:16:11,987 --> 00:16:13,856
Oh, sure. How many?

312
00:16:13,891 --> 00:16:15,107
Ten.

313
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:19,361
Thank you.

314
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:21,246
Come on.

315
00:16:21,281 --> 00:16:21,864
Yes, sir.

316
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:37,629
Did you know
about the car

317
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:38,881
almost
hitting us?

318
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:44,887
"What do you think?"

319
00:16:52,394 --> 00:16:54,897
Will we reach new york
all right now?

320
00:16:59,902 --> 00:17:01,153
"Your chances are good."

321
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:02,905
Very precise.

322
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,540
Honey, what
do you expect?

323
00:17:04,575 --> 00:17:06,408
A slip should
come out and say

324
00:17:06,443 --> 00:17:08,911
"hiya, donsy and patsy,
so how's by you?"

325
00:17:09,545 --> 00:17:10,796
Excuse me.

326
00:17:10,831 --> 00:17:12,664
I never said these slips

327
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,550
were made
for us personally...

328
00:17:14,585 --> 00:17:15,801
i heard!

329
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:20,172
Don...

330
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:21,423
don't you realize that...

331
00:17:22,057 --> 00:17:23,926
you could get
the same kind of answers

332
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,062
from any one
of these machines in here?

333
00:17:27,097 --> 00:17:28,564
Try and see.

334
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:31,683
The same kind, maybe,
but not the same answers.

335
00:17:34,354 --> 00:17:36,572
Will it still
take four hours

336
00:17:36,607 --> 00:17:38,440
before the car is ready?

337
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:43,445
Hey...

338
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,948
"it has already
been taken care of."

339
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,199
Swell.

340
00:17:47,234 --> 00:17:48,450
Let's go, then.

341
00:17:49,084 --> 00:17:50,335
Mister...

342
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:51,837
your car's ready.

343
00:17:51,872 --> 00:17:53,088
Got a lucky
break.

344
00:17:53,705 --> 00:17:54,957
Found a fuel pump
right here in town.

345
00:17:54,992 --> 00:17:55,591
Last one
they had, too.

346
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:56,842
Figured you'd
be walking around

347
00:17:56,877 --> 00:17:58,093
a couple of hours

348
00:17:58,128 --> 00:17:59,595
before you finally
came to the garage,

349
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:01,463
so i come looking for you.

350
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:04,466
Thank you.
We appreciate it.

351
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:06,351
We'll be right over.

352
00:18:06,969 --> 00:18:07,603
Okey-doke.

353
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:11,974
Coincidence?

354
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:15,110
Yes.

355
00:18:16,979 --> 00:18:19,481
All right, then you
ask it some questions.

356
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:21,733
Or are you
afraid to?

357
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,121
All right.

358
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:33,745
Will we reach columbus
by tomorrow?

359
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,248
We're not going
through col...

360
00:18:41,503 --> 00:18:43,388
"if that's what
you really want."

361
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:49,761
Will i ever be married?

362
00:18:53,649 --> 00:18:56,652
"The answer to
that is obvious."

363
00:18:59,154 --> 00:19:02,024
It's not possible
to foretell the future, is it?

364
00:19:05,527 --> 00:19:06,912
"That's up to you to find out."

365
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:12,534
You're just a stupid
piece of junk, aren't you?

366
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:14,419
"It all depends
upon your point of view."

367
00:19:14,454 --> 00:19:17,539
I don't want to stay
here anymore, don.

368
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,541
Even if it's true?

369
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:21,426
Especially
if it's true.

370
00:19:21,461 --> 00:19:23,295
What are you
talking about?

371
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:25,180
I think youare
afraid of it.

372
00:19:25,215 --> 00:19:27,049
Not of it.

373
00:19:27,084 --> 00:19:28,934
Of what, then?

374
00:19:28,969 --> 00:19:30,802
Don't you know?

375
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:38,310
Are we always
going to live

376
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:39,561
in saint louis?

377
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:45,567
Are we going to live

378
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:46,818
in the east?

379
00:19:48,704 --> 00:19:51,323
Are we going to
live in the west?

380
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:55,711
Are we going
to live

381
00:19:55,746 --> 00:19:56,962
in this
country?

382
00:19:56,997 --> 00:19:58,213
Don...

383
00:19:58,248 --> 00:19:59,831
don!

384
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:01,083
What?

385
00:20:01,118 --> 00:20:02,334
Let's go.

386
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:03,585
No.

387
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,087
Are you just going
to stay here?

388
00:20:05,122 --> 00:20:06,338
I don't know!

389
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,225
Oh, sweetheart,
listen to me.

390
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,728
Please, if you love me,
just listen to me.

391
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:14,596
No, you listen to me.

392
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:18,350
This machine is
predicting our future.

393
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:22,104
Do you think i could
just walk away from it?

394
00:20:22,139 --> 00:20:25,240
I'm not talking about
that machine anymore.

395
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:27,109
I'm talking about you.

396
00:20:27,144 --> 00:20:29,611
Are you just
going to sit here

397
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:31,496
and let that... that...

398
00:20:31,531 --> 00:20:33,365
that thing
run your life?

399
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,616
Run my life?

400
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,628
Run my life?

401
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:49,765
Isn't that exactly what
you're letting it do?

402
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,017
Don, it made you call
the office before.

403
00:20:52,634 --> 00:20:54,519
It made you stay here
instead of leave.

404
00:20:55,137 --> 00:20:57,639
It made you afraid
to walk down the street.

405
00:20:57,674 --> 00:20:58,890
And now it's telling you

406
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:00,776
where you're
going to live.

407
00:21:00,811 --> 00:21:04,529
Why, it's as if every
superstitious feeling you ever had

408
00:21:05,147 --> 00:21:07,032
is wrapped up
in that one machine.

409
00:21:07,067 --> 00:21:08,283
It doesn't matter

410
00:21:08,318 --> 00:21:10,786
whether it can
foretell the future.

411
00:21:10,821 --> 00:21:13,905
What matters is whether
you believe more in luck

412
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:17,042
and in fortune than
you do in yourself.

413
00:21:17,077 --> 00:21:19,544
Well, you can decide
your own life.

414
00:21:19,579 --> 00:21:20,796
You have a mind-

415
00:21:20,831 --> 00:21:22,297
a wonderful mind.

416
00:21:22,332 --> 00:21:24,800
Don't destroy it
trying to justify

417
00:21:24,835 --> 00:21:28,553
that cheap, penny fortune
machine to yourself.

418
00:21:31,673 --> 00:21:32,924
Pat...

419
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:36,678
we can have a... a
wonderful life together

420
00:21:37,312 --> 00:21:40,432
if we make it
wonderful ourselves.

421
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:43,568
I...

422
00:21:43,603 --> 00:21:46,071
pat...

423
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:51,693
i don't want to know
what's going to happen.

424
00:21:52,327 --> 00:21:54,830
I want us to make
it happen together.

425
00:21:54,865 --> 00:21:56,698
Don't cry, darling,
don't cry.

426
00:21:57,984 --> 00:22:00,452
Is there something wrong?

427
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:03,088
No, no, no,
it's all right.

428
00:22:04,956 --> 00:22:06,842
Don't cry.

429
00:22:06,877 --> 00:22:08,710
We'll go, we'll go.

430
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:12,464
You're right. I'm a jerk.

431
00:22:12,499 --> 00:22:14,966
No, you're not.
You're wonderful.

432
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:16,852
Yes, yes, i am.

433
00:22:16,887 --> 00:22:19,971
I'm the world's
biggest jerk.

434
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:23,725
Come on, let's go
get our car.

435
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,976
Yes, that's right.

436
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:26,862
Let's go get
our car and...

437
00:22:26,897 --> 00:22:29,364
we'll drive
out of this town

438
00:22:29,399 --> 00:22:33,118
and go where we want to go

439
00:22:33,153 --> 00:22:34,986
anytime we please.

440
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:36,872
Oh...

441
00:22:36,907 --> 00:22:39,991
oh, don, i love you.

442
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:41,877
I love you, too, baby.

443
00:22:46,882 --> 00:22:48,133
You keep
the change.

444
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:49,384
Thanks!

445
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:51,253
Come on
back, now.

446
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:10,272
Go ahead.

447
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:17,162
Can we ask some
more questions now?

448
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:30,292
Do you think we might
leave ridgeview today?

449
00:23:38,433 --> 00:23:40,302
Is there any way out?

450
00:23:40,337 --> 00:23:41,553
Any way at all?

451
00:23:41,588 --> 00:23:45,307
Counterbalance in the
little town of ridgeview, ohio.

452
00:23:45,342 --> 00:23:47,809
Two people permanently enslaved

453
00:23:47,844 --> 00:23:50,312
by the tyranny
of fear and superstition,

454
00:23:50,946 --> 00:23:54,065
facing the future
with a kind of helpless dread.

455
00:23:57,202 --> 00:24:00,956
Two others facing the future
with confidence

456
00:24:00,991 --> 00:24:03,458
having escaped
one of the darker places

457
00:24:03,493 --> 00:24:05,961
of the twilight zone.
