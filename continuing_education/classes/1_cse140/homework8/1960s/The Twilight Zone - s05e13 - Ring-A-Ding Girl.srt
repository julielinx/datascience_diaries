1
00:00:07,223 --> 00:00:09,726
You unlock this door
with the key of imagination.

2
00:00:09,761 --> 00:00:12,228
Beyond it is another dimension-

3
00:00:12,263 --> 00:00:14,731
a dimension of sound...

4
00:00:14,766 --> 00:00:16,616
a dimension of sight...

5
00:00:16,651 --> 00:00:18,485
a dimension of mind.

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,621
You're moving into a land
of both shadow and substance,

7
00:00:21,656 --> 00:00:23,490
of things and ideas.

8
00:00:23,525 --> 00:00:27,243
You've just crossed over
into the twilight zone.

9
00:00:38,755 --> 00:00:40,006
I know.

10
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,509
I know.

11
00:00:42,544 --> 00:00:44,394
Iknow!

12
00:00:44,429 --> 00:00:47,514
I know, and you are making me
all the later.

13
00:00:48,765 --> 00:00:50,650
And lovesville to you.

14
00:00:51,901 --> 00:00:53,153
Ivor is nervous.

15
00:00:53,188 --> 00:00:55,021
So am l-
you've 25 minutes

16
00:00:55,056 --> 00:00:56,272
to get to
the airport.

17
00:00:56,307 --> 00:00:58,158
Won't they hold
the plane?

18
00:00:58,193 --> 00:00:59,409
Not forever.

19
00:00:59,444 --> 00:01:00,660
You'd better
shift gears.

20
00:01:00,695 --> 00:01:02,529
I'm all packed,
except for my rings.

21
00:01:02,564 --> 00:01:04,414
I'm going to take
all of them.

22
00:01:04,449 --> 00:01:05,031
Oh, you kook.

23
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:06,916
It wasyouridea.

24
00:01:06,951 --> 00:01:09,419
It was my idea it would
make good publicity

25
00:01:09,454 --> 00:01:11,287
if the ring-a-ding girl
collected rings.

26
00:01:11,322 --> 00:01:13,790
Now, you'd better haul
your fantail out of here,

27
00:01:13,825 --> 00:01:16,292
or all you're gonna
see of that plane
is a vapor trail.

28
00:01:16,327 --> 00:01:17,544
Oh, this just came
special delivery.

29
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:19,429
You can look at it
on the plane.

30
00:01:19,464 --> 00:01:22,549
I adore presents.
Let the plane wait.

31
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:30,557
"Please accept the enclosed
as a token of affection

32
00:01:30,592 --> 00:01:33,693
of your fan club
in howardville."

33
00:01:33,728 --> 00:01:35,562
Do you know where
howardville is?

34
00:01:35,597 --> 00:01:36,813
Doesn't everybody?

35
00:01:36,848 --> 00:01:38,698
You'll see it if you look down.

36
00:01:38,733 --> 00:01:39,949
We fly right over
the center of town.

37
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:41,818
Well, hooray for us.

38
00:01:41,853 --> 00:01:44,320
Howardville happens to be
my hometown,

39
00:01:44,355 --> 00:01:46,823
and my loyalest fans
are still there.

40
00:01:46,858 --> 00:01:49,325
Do you know, i couldn't
have gotten here if it
hadn't been for them.

41
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,211
They actually took up
a collection

42
00:01:51,246 --> 00:01:53,079
to pay my fare to hollywood.

43
00:01:53,114 --> 00:01:54,964
What'd they send you-
the key to the local still?

44
00:01:54,999 --> 00:01:56,216
Well,
let's find out.

45
00:01:56,251 --> 00:01:58,084
Youfind out.

46
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:01,838
I'm going to get this
ice down to the car.

47
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:28,248
Bunny, come home.

48
00:02:28,283 --> 00:02:30,750
Come home, bunny.

49
00:02:30,785 --> 00:02:33,870
Bunny, this is hildy.

50
00:02:33,905 --> 00:02:37,624
Come home

51
00:02:37,659 --> 00:02:38,875
come home...

52
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:43,763
occupation, film actress.

53
00:02:43,798 --> 00:02:45,632
Residence,
hollywood, california,

54
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:49,769
or anywhere in the world that
cameras happen to be grinding.

55
00:02:49,804 --> 00:02:51,638
Bunny blake is a public figure.

56
00:02:51,673 --> 00:02:55,391
What she wears, eats,
thinks, says is news.

57
00:02:55,426 --> 00:02:58,528
But underneath the glamour,
the makeup, the publicity

58
00:02:58,563 --> 00:03:00,396
the buildup, the costuming

59
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:02,899
is a flesh-and-blood person,
a beautiful girl

60
00:03:02,934 --> 00:03:07,904
about to take a long and bizarre
journey into the twilight zone.

61
00:03:25,922 --> 00:03:27,173
Yeah, okay, nancy.

62
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:29,058
Hey, we still going
to the dance friday?

63
00:03:29,093 --> 00:03:30,310
Great.
Bud!

64
00:03:30,345 --> 00:03:31,561
What?

65
00:03:31,596 --> 00:03:34,063
I need that
picnic basket
out of the cellar.

66
00:03:34,098 --> 00:03:35,932
Oh, look, i'll call
you right back.

67
00:03:35,967 --> 00:03:39,068
Hey, can't i finish
reading the ball scores?

68
00:03:39,103 --> 00:03:41,571
Now, buster.
I'm going to pack
the sandwiches

69
00:03:41,606 --> 00:03:43,439
just as soon as i finish
cleaning this room.

70
00:03:43,474 --> 00:03:45,325
Hey, you know, the
paper says rain.

71
00:03:45,942 --> 00:03:47,827
Yeah, i know.
So does the radio.

72
00:03:47,862 --> 00:03:50,330
But just in the north
part of the county.

73
00:03:50,365 --> 00:03:52,198
Will you please get
the picnic basket?

74
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:55,335
And then clean up your
room... and mow the lawn.

75
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:57,837
Aren't there
any laws

76
00:03:57,872 --> 00:04:00,340
against child labor
in this state?

77
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:14,721
Boo.

78
00:04:16,472 --> 00:04:17,473
Bunny!

79
00:04:17,508 --> 00:04:19,359
I don't believe it!

80
00:04:19,394 --> 00:04:20,610
Oh, it has been so long!

81
00:04:20,645 --> 00:04:23,730
I've looked forward to it so!
I think about you
all the time.

82
00:04:23,765 --> 00:04:25,615
But how did you
ever get in here

83
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:28,117
without me
hearing you?
It's so good to be home!

84
00:04:28,152 --> 00:04:29,369
I could just
shake you.

85
00:04:29,404 --> 00:04:31,237
That is no way to
greet a celebrity.

86
00:04:31,272 --> 00:04:33,740
But five years,
and not even one
speck of warning.

87
00:04:33,775 --> 00:04:34,991
Oh, you know me-
glamorous,

88
00:04:35,026 --> 00:04:37,493
unpredictable,
full of surprises-

89
00:04:37,528 --> 00:04:38,745
the same old nut.

90
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:41,247
What made you decide to come
home out of the blue?

91
00:04:41,282 --> 00:04:43,132
I thought maybe you'd
like to see me.

92
00:04:43,167 --> 00:04:44,384
Oh, i'm tickled
to death.

93
00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:46,252
And maybe
it was the ring.

94
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:47,503
Oh, it arrived.

95
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:48,254
What a project that was.

96
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:50,757
Everyone in town
chipped in a dollar,

97
00:04:50,792 --> 00:04:52,008
and they let me pick it out.

98
00:04:52,043 --> 00:04:53,893
Do you really
like it?

99
00:04:53,928 --> 00:04:55,144
I love it.

100
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:58,898
Sis, is everything
all right here?

101
00:04:58,933 --> 00:05:01,401
Areyou
all right?

102
00:05:01,436 --> 00:05:02,652
Never better. Why?

103
00:05:02,687 --> 00:05:04,404
Oh, i don't know.

104
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:06,406
Maybe i'm having
hallucinations.

105
00:05:06,441 --> 00:05:08,908
Oh, don't drag
that on the floor.
I haven't even vacuumed.

106
00:05:08,943 --> 00:05:10,777
Oh, that's the way you
do it in hollywood.

107
00:05:10,812 --> 00:05:13,029
They teach you in drama class.

108
00:05:13,064 --> 00:05:15,531
It's supposed to show
that you really don't care

109
00:05:16,165 --> 00:05:19,285
and besides, you've got ten more
at home in the closet.

110
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,170
How do you like the walk?

111
00:05:21,205 --> 00:05:23,673
You didn't learnthat
in drama class.

112
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:25,541
My one natural talent.

113
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:28,678
Oh, bunny,
we're so proud of you-

114
00:05:28,713 --> 00:05:29,929
the whole
town is.

115
00:05:29,964 --> 00:05:31,798
How long do we get to keep you?

116
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,049
Just for one day.

117
00:05:33,084 --> 00:05:35,435
Oh, that's not
nearly long enough.

118
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:37,553
I'm stealing time as it is, sis.

119
00:05:37,588 --> 00:05:39,439
I'm supposed to be in rome.

120
00:05:39,474 --> 00:05:42,558
But i got to the airport,
and right at the last minute

121
00:05:42,593 --> 00:05:44,444
i said, "shoot, i'm going home."

122
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:48,197
Aunt bunny!

123
00:05:48,232 --> 00:05:50,700
Who is this
divine man?

124
00:05:50,735 --> 00:05:53,202
Hello, aunt bunny.

125
00:05:53,237 --> 00:05:55,071
Is it really bud?

126
00:05:55,106 --> 00:05:58,207
Funny, i thought
it was rock, or
maybe cary.

127
00:05:58,242 --> 00:06:00,710
Yeah, mom said you
were a screwball.

128
00:06:00,745 --> 00:06:01,961
And she was right.

129
00:06:01,996 --> 00:06:03,830
Gee, it is good
to be home.

130
00:06:03,865 --> 00:06:05,715
I'm so anxious to
see everybody-

131
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,583
all my old
friends and all.

132
00:06:07,618 --> 00:06:09,469
You picked
the right day for it.

133
00:06:09,504 --> 00:06:10,720
You remember
the founder's day picnic?

134
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:11,971
How could
i forget it?

135
00:06:12,006 --> 00:06:13,840
The year i won
the beauty pageant

136
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:15,725
was what really
got me started.

137
00:06:16,092 --> 00:06:18,094
Well, the picnic is
this afternoon.

138
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:19,979
Everyone in
town will
be there.

139
00:06:20,014 --> 00:06:21,230
Picnic?

140
00:06:21,265 --> 00:06:23,099
Of course
you'll come?

141
00:06:23,134 --> 00:06:24,350
Picnic!

142
00:06:24,385 --> 00:06:25,601
Bud and i
have to go-

143
00:06:25,636 --> 00:06:27,487
i'm on the
food committee,

144
00:06:27,522 --> 00:06:28,738
and he's
the lifeguard.

145
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:36,362
Good morning,
ladies and gentlemen.

146
00:06:36,397 --> 00:06:38,865
This is your young old friend,
ben braden,

147
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,750
howardville's answer
to arthur godfrey,

148
00:06:40,785 --> 00:06:42,618
bringing you
the news and weather

149
00:06:42,653 --> 00:06:46,372
and a very special hello to you,
bunny blake, wherever you are.

150
00:06:46,407 --> 00:06:48,257
Bunny, please come home.

151
00:06:48,292 --> 00:06:52,011
We need you, we need you,

152
00:06:52,046 --> 00:06:53,880
we need you...

153
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:56,516
oh...

154
00:06:58,134 --> 00:07:00,019
bunny, are you
all right?

155
00:07:00,054 --> 00:07:01,521
Bunny, what is it?

156
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:05,274
Bud, call dr. Floyd.

157
00:07:05,309 --> 00:07:06,526
Bunny!

158
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:12,782
I played a nurse
in a movie once.

159
00:07:12,817 --> 00:07:14,650
The doctor
reminded me of you.

160
00:07:14,685 --> 00:07:16,536
He was supposed to be

161
00:07:16,571 --> 00:07:19,038
a kindly, gruff
old family physician.

162
00:07:19,073 --> 00:07:20,289
I saw it.

163
00:07:20,324 --> 00:07:23,409
The medical profession
should have sued.

164
00:07:23,444 --> 00:07:25,294
Uh, i was faking...

165
00:07:25,329 --> 00:07:27,163
about being sick,
i mean.

166
00:07:27,198 --> 00:07:29,048
I just wanted
to see you.

167
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:30,299
Well, that's
flattering.

168
00:07:30,334 --> 00:07:32,168
What's your diagnosis?

169
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:35,304
One tired little girl.

170
00:07:35,339 --> 00:07:37,807
What do you do in
hollywood, anyway?

171
00:07:37,842 --> 00:07:39,675
Me? I glow.

172
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,561
Wind me, and i light up.

173
00:07:41,596 --> 00:07:44,680
Turn me on and i give off
incandescent sparkles.

174
00:07:44,715 --> 00:07:46,566
Heck, doc, i'm a star.

175
00:07:46,601 --> 00:07:48,434
Well, you've
been sparkling

176
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:50,319
a little too
much lately.

177
00:07:50,354 --> 00:07:53,439
What you need is
sleep, rest, fresh air

178
00:07:53,474 --> 00:07:55,324
and some of hildy's
good cooking.

179
00:07:55,359 --> 00:07:57,827
I want you to take it
a little easy for a while.

180
00:07:57,862 --> 00:08:00,947
Sorry, kindly, gruff
old family physician

181
00:08:00,982 --> 00:08:02,198
but that is impossible.

182
00:08:02,233 --> 00:08:05,334
There is a producer in
rome right this minute

183
00:08:05,369 --> 00:08:07,837
pulling out what's
left of his hair

184
00:08:07,872 --> 00:08:09,088
wondering where i am.

185
00:08:09,123 --> 00:08:11,457
Tell me his name, and
i'll cable him you're sick.

186
00:08:11,492 --> 00:08:12,708
But i'm not sick.

187
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:18,097
Your sister said
you were in shock,

188
00:08:18,132 --> 00:08:21,717
that you seemed not to hear her
or even to see her

189
00:08:21,752 --> 00:08:22,602
during
that seizure.

190
00:08:23,219 --> 00:08:24,470
It was a performance.

191
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:26,355
Evidently a very
convincing one.

192
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:29,475
I told you, it was all an excuse
to get you over here.

193
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,978
There's something
i want to ask you.
Well?

194
00:08:32,013 --> 00:08:35,114
You used to be a very big deal
on the founder's day committee.

195
00:08:35,149 --> 00:08:36,983
Still am.

196
00:08:37,018 --> 00:08:38,234
I'm the chairman.

197
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:42,622
Well, as one kindly, gruff
old family friend to another

198
00:08:42,657 --> 00:08:45,124
would you do me
a very large favor?

199
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:45,741
I'll try.

200
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:46,993
Put off the picnic-

201
00:08:47,028 --> 00:08:48,878
postpone it to another day.

202
00:08:48,913 --> 00:08:50,746
Really?

203
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:52,632
You can't be serious,
bunny- why?

204
00:08:52,667 --> 00:08:56,135
I've only got one day
to spend at home.

205
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:58,638
I want it to be
a plain, ordinary

206
00:08:58,673 --> 00:09:01,757
apple-pie kind of day-
the way i remember.

207
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:03,643
I want to drop in
on old friends

208
00:09:03,678 --> 00:09:05,511
and surprise them
at home.

209
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:07,396
You can see them
at the picnic.

210
00:09:07,431 --> 00:09:09,265
It wouldn't be
the same-

211
00:09:09,398 --> 00:09:11,267
there'd be crowds,
new people i don't know,

212
00:09:11,302 --> 00:09:13,152
strangers
tugging at me for autographs.

213
00:09:13,187 --> 00:09:15,021
I'd be miserable.

214
00:09:16,272 --> 00:09:18,774
Bunny, you can't
seriously expect

215
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:23,162
that an entire town is
going to rearrange its plans

216
00:09:23,197 --> 00:09:25,031
just to suit your whim.

217
00:09:25,066 --> 00:09:28,034
Doc, i love this town,
and i love the people.

218
00:09:28,069 --> 00:09:29,919
Would i ask them
to do this for me

219
00:09:30,536 --> 00:09:32,421
if it weren't more than a whim?

220
00:09:32,456 --> 00:09:35,291
I don't know what your life
is like away from here.

221
00:09:35,326 --> 00:09:39,045
Perhaps in hollywood you can
make an unreasonable request

222
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,930
and your caprice is gratified.

223
00:09:40,965 --> 00:09:43,049
But this isn't
hollywood.

224
00:09:43,933 --> 00:09:47,687
Now, i'm going to
give you something

225
00:09:47,722 --> 00:09:49,555
that will
help you rest.

226
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:09,075
"Ring-a-ding girl"...

227
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:10,960
but she don't fool cyrus gentry.

228
00:10:10,995 --> 00:10:13,462
Miss high and mighty
coming back here

229
00:10:13,497 --> 00:10:15,965
like she was somebody special.

230
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,967
Well, youare
special-

231
00:10:18,002 --> 00:10:19,218
right now.

232
00:10:19,253 --> 00:10:24,590
Maybe the most special person
howardville will ever have.

233
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,475
So, bunny blake...

234
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:32,098
help us...

235
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:36,602
oh, bunny...

236
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:38,104
i have written
you out...

237
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:39,989
excuse me, doctor.

238
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:44,994
Bunny?

239
00:10:45,029 --> 00:10:46,245
Bunny!

240
00:10:47,531 --> 00:10:48,748
Oh, hildy...

241
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,501
how's the patient?

242
00:10:52,536 --> 00:10:54,370
Whereisthe patient?

243
00:10:54,405 --> 00:10:55,621
She went upstairs.

244
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:58,124
Hildy, what's upsetting
your sister?

245
00:10:58,159 --> 00:10:59,375
I wish i knew.

246
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:01,877
She seems to be
under a severe strain,

247
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:04,380
and she's acting
quite irrationally.

248
00:11:04,415 --> 00:11:06,766
Now, you have
this prescription
filled out.

249
00:11:06,801 --> 00:11:08,634
It'll relax her.

250
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:10,019
Try to keep her
as quiet as possible,

251
00:11:10,054 --> 00:11:11,887
and by no means
let her go on her own.

252
00:11:11,922 --> 00:11:13,773
I'll try.

253
00:11:15,024 --> 00:11:16,892
It may be...
may be just fatigue.

254
00:11:17,526 --> 00:11:18,778
Then again...

255
00:11:20,029 --> 00:11:22,648
well, you just call me
if you need me.

256
00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:25,151
Thank you, doctor.

257
00:11:25,186 --> 00:11:26,402
Good-bye.

258
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:29,538
Bud?

259
00:11:29,573 --> 00:11:30,790
Yeah.
This is a
prescription

260
00:11:31,407 --> 00:11:33,292
for some medicine
your aunt bunny needs.

261
00:11:33,327 --> 00:11:35,161
Would you get it filled
right away, please?

262
00:11:35,196 --> 00:11:36,412
What's the matter
with her?

263
00:11:36,447 --> 00:11:40,166
There's not a single solitary
thing the matter with me, hildy.

264
00:11:40,201 --> 00:11:42,668
I'm really shocked at how old
dr. Floyd is getting.

265
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:45,805
I think the poor old dear ought
to put himself out to pasture.

266
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,423
He thinks you ought to get
some rest.

267
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:48,674
Why? I'm not
the least bit tired.

268
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:50,559
He's the one who needs to rest.

269
00:11:50,594 --> 00:11:53,062
Did you notice
how his hand
trembles?

270
00:11:53,097 --> 00:11:54,063
He left this
prescription

271
00:11:54,098 --> 00:11:55,314
for something to
help you relax.

272
00:11:55,349 --> 00:11:57,817
Now, bud's going to the
drugstore to get it filled.

273
00:11:57,852 --> 00:11:59,068
And while we're waiting,
why don't you

274
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,936
just lie down and
try to take it easy?

275
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:04,073
Mm-hmm, and i can just hear
what people will say:

276
00:12:04,108 --> 00:12:06,575
"Bunny didn't drop in to see
any of her old friends.

277
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:08,444
She's getting uppity,
and she puts on airs."

278
00:12:08,479 --> 00:12:11,580
I can explain to them that
you weren't feeling well.

279
00:12:11,615 --> 00:12:13,449
Bobbi woodson
used to be my best friend.

280
00:12:13,484 --> 00:12:14,700
I've got to seeher.

281
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:16,585
And ben braden- do you remember

282
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,454
that excruciating crush
he used to have on me?

283
00:12:18,489 --> 00:12:20,339
Whatever happened to ben?

284
00:12:20,374 --> 00:12:23,342
He's still here. He runs
the television station.
Now, listen, bunny...

285
00:12:23,377 --> 00:12:25,094
i could have married
that old boy.

286
00:12:25,129 --> 00:12:28,214
I've got a good mind
to walk in and
surprise him.

287
00:12:28,249 --> 00:12:30,716
Bunny, i don't want you
to leave this house.

288
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:31,967
Can't stand
being cooped up
in the house.

289
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:34,470
Sometimes in california
when i get that

290
00:12:34,505 --> 00:12:36,355
closed-in feeling,
you know what i do?

291
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:38,224
I take off every stitch
of clothes

292
00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:40,109
and i jump in
the old swimming pool

293
00:12:40,144 --> 00:12:41,977
and i swim like
a ring-a-ding fish.

294
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:44,230
That must be
very interesting
for your neighbors.

295
00:12:44,265 --> 00:12:46,866
Nobody's complained so far.

296
00:12:46,901 --> 00:12:49,735
Bud, want to go
for a walk and say
"hey" to people?

297
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:52,238
Great.
The doctor wants
you to rest.

298
00:12:52,273 --> 00:12:54,740
He also said i needed
some fresh air.

299
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:57,243
Will you at least wait
until bud comes back

300
00:12:57,278 --> 00:12:59,128
from the drugstore
with your medicine?

301
00:12:59,163 --> 00:13:00,129
I've got a better idea.

302
00:13:00,164 --> 00:13:02,631
I'll drive to the
drugstore with you.

303
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:05,134
What could be
more restful than
a little drive?

304
00:13:05,169 --> 00:13:07,636
Unless you're one of
those hot rodders-
are you, bud?

305
00:13:07,671 --> 00:13:09,505
Uh, no, no, no.

306
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,390
Well, i am.

307
00:13:11,425 --> 00:13:12,641
Well, are you going
to come with me,

308
00:13:12,676 --> 00:13:14,510
or are you going to
stand all day talking?

309
00:13:14,545 --> 00:13:15,644
Sure...
hey...

310
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:20,015
ring-a-ding!

311
00:13:34,363 --> 00:13:36,248
Well, what do you think
of her, aunt bunny?

312
00:13:36,283 --> 00:13:38,117
Ring-a-ding!

313
00:13:38,152 --> 00:13:40,619
She's real cool,
but call me bunny!

314
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:44,373
"Aunt bunny" sounds like the
housemother at the playboy club.

315
00:13:54,383 --> 00:13:56,886
Um... bud, is mr. Gentry
still the caretaker

316
00:13:56,921 --> 00:13:58,137
over at the high school?

317
00:13:58,172 --> 00:14:00,022
You mean old methuselah?

318
00:14:00,057 --> 00:14:01,273
You'd have to blow
the school up

319
00:14:01,308 --> 00:14:03,142
to get rid of
that old bird.

320
00:14:03,177 --> 00:14:05,027
Well, be an angel and
stop just long enough

321
00:14:05,062 --> 00:14:06,896
for me to run in
and say hello.

322
00:14:06,931 --> 00:14:09,398
Yeah, well, hadn't we better
get your medicine first?

323
00:14:09,433 --> 00:14:11,901
Bud, this is important.

324
00:14:11,936 --> 00:14:13,152
Okay, okay.

325
00:14:13,187 --> 00:14:14,403
Thank you.

326
00:14:19,408 --> 00:14:23,162
So you finally got your fill
of hollywood, huh?

327
00:14:23,197 --> 00:14:24,547
No, i like it out there.

328
00:14:24,582 --> 00:14:25,798
It's not what you think.

329
00:14:26,415 --> 00:14:27,166
Oh, isn't it?

330
00:14:27,201 --> 00:14:29,668
We heard about all
those high jinks

331
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:30,920
you got into
out there.

332
00:14:30,955 --> 00:14:32,805
Can't say i'd
be proud of it.

333
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,674
Just what brought you
back here, barbara?

334
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:36,926
Coming home was
an impulse.

335
00:14:36,961 --> 00:14:40,429
Well, you sure picked a day for
it- founder's day picnic.

336
00:14:40,464 --> 00:14:42,064
Not that you'd
be interested.

337
00:14:42,099 --> 00:14:44,567
Oh, but i am, mr. Gentry.
That's why i need your help.

338
00:14:44,602 --> 00:14:46,185
Myhelp?

339
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,938
I want you to unlock the doors
to the school auditorium.

340
00:14:48,973 --> 00:14:51,440
Now, some people may show up,
and if they do,

341
00:14:51,475 --> 00:14:52,691
i want you to let them in.

342
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:55,694
No, i can't do that,
i've got to go to the picnic.

343
00:14:57,446 --> 00:14:59,949
Mr. Gentry,
i know you don't like me,

344
00:14:59,984 --> 00:15:03,085
but this is important-
terribly important.

345
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:06,705
Always asking favors.

346
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,842
Always wanted to be treated
like somebody special-

347
00:15:09,877 --> 00:15:12,094
barbara blake.

348
00:15:12,129 --> 00:15:14,213
Well, barbara, maybe you forgot

349
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:17,349
that these doors are open
all day long.

350
00:15:17,384 --> 00:15:19,718
Now, you want
to come here,

351
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:22,855
you walk in like
anybody else.

352
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,723
Thank you, mr. Gentry.

353
00:15:27,977 --> 00:15:29,862
Mr. Gentry...

354
00:15:30,613 --> 00:15:32,364
don't go to that picnic.

355
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,883
Well, what do you think
of the old town, bunny?

356
00:15:50,918 --> 00:15:53,385
It's so good, i
wonder why i left it.

357
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,888
Why did you leave?

358
00:15:56,505 --> 00:15:59,008
Oh, i guess i
could have stayed here

359
00:15:59,043 --> 00:16:01,510
and doneblithe spirit
at the little theater,

360
00:16:01,545 --> 00:16:04,013
and played an angel
at the church pageant

361
00:16:04,048 --> 00:16:06,515
at christmas time,
but i was too ambitious

362
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:07,766
and too talented.

363
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:10,269
I don't mean that the
way it sounded, but...

364
00:16:10,304 --> 00:16:11,520
i just knew i
had a talent,

365
00:16:12,154 --> 00:16:14,023
and i had to find
a place to let it grow.

366
00:16:14,058 --> 00:16:15,908
Otherwise, it
would have died.

367
00:16:15,943 --> 00:16:18,410
And i would have ended
up a frustrated woman

368
00:16:18,445 --> 00:16:20,913
pushing a broom around
a house i hated

369
00:16:20,948 --> 00:16:24,033
and screaming at a
brood of children
i couldn't stand.

370
00:16:24,068 --> 00:16:26,535
Can you understand
that, bud?

371
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:29,038
Yeah. Yeah, i
can understand that, bunny.

372
00:16:29,073 --> 00:16:31,540
Oh, here's your prescription.
You want to go home?

373
00:16:32,174 --> 00:16:33,425
Um...

374
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,928
the television station's
still down the street?

375
00:16:35,963 --> 00:16:37,179
Yeah, right over there.

376
00:16:37,214 --> 00:16:39,682
Mm-hmm, well,
i'll be back.

377
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,811
Hello?

378
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:55,314
No, i don't have it on.

379
00:16:55,349 --> 00:16:57,199
She is?

380
00:16:57,234 --> 00:17:00,319
Well, yes, of course i knew she
was in town, but i...

381
00:17:00,354 --> 00:17:02,821
she's supposed to be at the
drugstore with bud.

382
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:05,324
All right, clara.
I'll call you later.

383
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:14,216
And i can't tell
you how exciting it
is to be home again.

384
00:17:14,251 --> 00:17:16,585
Well, are you gonna be with us
for a nice, long visit, bunny?

385
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:19,722
I have to leave tonight- i'm
starting a new picture in rome.

386
00:17:19,757 --> 00:17:20,973
Oh, that's too bad.

387
00:17:21,008 --> 00:17:22,224
A lot of your friends
won't get to see you.

388
00:17:22,259 --> 00:17:24,727
They can if they really want to.

389
00:17:24,762 --> 00:17:27,846
Remember that one-woman show
i did in las vegas last winter?

390
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,732
We read about it.

391
00:17:29,767 --> 00:17:30,983
Well, i'm putting it on
this afternoon

392
00:17:31,018 --> 00:17:32,234
in the high school auditorium,

393
00:17:32,269 --> 00:17:35,988
and i want everybody in town
to come as my guest.

394
00:17:36,023 --> 00:17:39,358
You know, everybody here at home
has always been so nice to me.

395
00:17:39,393 --> 00:17:41,860
It's kind of
a token of my appreciation.

396
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:43,112
Looks like we've got
a conflict-

397
00:17:43,147 --> 00:17:44,997
the founder's day picnic starts
this afternoon.

398
00:17:45,032 --> 00:17:46,749
Well, all i've
got to say is,

399
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:49,868
folks have a choice of
coming to see me at 3:00

400
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:51,754
or going to
riverside park

401
00:17:51,789 --> 00:17:54,256
and getting bit
by a bunch of ants.

402
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:57,376
I don't know anything about it.

403
00:17:57,411 --> 00:17:59,878
I thought she was
down at the drugstore,

404
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:03,015
and the next thing i know,
here she is on tv.

405
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:04,883
Oh, i don't know
which i'll go to.

406
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:07,386
The way i feel now,
i'm so ashamed

407
00:18:07,421 --> 00:18:09,271
i don't want to show
my face anywhere.

408
00:18:09,306 --> 00:18:11,774
I'll call you back.

409
00:18:11,809 --> 00:18:13,642
Bunny? I'm
trying very hard

410
00:18:13,677 --> 00:18:14,893
not to get
angry with you,

411
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:18,030
because i think you
have lost your mind.

412
00:18:18,065 --> 00:18:19,281
Ooh, buddy boy,
i told you

413
00:18:19,316 --> 00:18:20,532
there'd be
an explosion.

414
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:22,401
Bud, you may
be excused.

415
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:24,903
This is nothing
to joke about.

416
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:27,406
Half a dozen people
have called me already.

417
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,291
Well, what
do they say?

418
00:18:29,326 --> 00:18:30,542
Well, they-they're
confused.

419
00:18:30,577 --> 00:18:32,411
They want to know
whether to go

420
00:18:32,446 --> 00:18:33,662
to the founder's
day picnic

421
00:18:33,697 --> 00:18:36,165
or thisthing
you're putting on
at the high school.

422
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,667
Bunny, what are
you trying to do?

423
00:18:39,301 --> 00:18:41,170
I owe this town
something, hildy.

424
00:18:41,205 --> 00:18:43,672
It's just my way of
paying off a debt.

425
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:46,175
Well, it doesn't
look like that.

426
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:47,426
You look like
a show-off-

427
00:18:47,461 --> 00:18:49,311
a big hollywood
celebrity

428
00:18:49,346 --> 00:18:50,562
who's trying
to impress

429
00:18:50,597 --> 00:18:52,431
a lot of
small-town hicks.

430
00:18:52,466 --> 00:18:54,933
Sis, let's not fight.

431
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:57,436
Well... i can't condone
what you're doing.

432
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:01,190
I think it's best
that bud and i show
up at the picnic.

433
00:19:13,702 --> 00:19:16,205
Is that howardville
down there, bunny?

434
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,707
That flyspeck
next to the river?

435
00:19:18,742 --> 00:19:21,844
Is that the place
you want to go back to?

436
00:19:21,879 --> 00:19:23,095
Forget it, bunny.

437
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:31,220
Hildy?

438
00:19:40,863 --> 00:19:42,114
Oh, honey,
if this performance

439
00:19:42,149 --> 00:19:43,982
means so much to you,
we'll be there.

440
00:19:54,376 --> 00:19:56,245
Bunny, we're late.

441
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,747
Oh, one thing for sure.

442
00:19:58,782 --> 00:20:01,250
They can't start the show
until i get there.

443
00:20:01,285 --> 00:20:04,386
Bud? Bud?

444
00:20:04,421 --> 00:20:05,637
Bud, we're waiting.

445
00:20:05,672 --> 00:20:07,506
I can't find
my blue tie.

446
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:09,391
Well, wear
another one.
We're late.

447
00:20:13,797 --> 00:20:16,899
You'd better fire
your weatherman.

448
00:20:16,934 --> 00:20:18,150
Bud, hurry!

449
00:20:18,767 --> 00:20:20,018
I'm coming!

450
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:22,905
Remember when we used
to lie in bed on rainy nights

451
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:25,407
and call to each other
when we were kids?

452
00:20:25,442 --> 00:20:27,276
Fun, wasn't it,
being kids?

453
00:20:27,311 --> 00:20:28,527
It was very good.

454
00:20:28,562 --> 00:20:30,412
Looks like
it's starting
to rain a little.

455
00:20:30,447 --> 00:20:31,663
We'll just have
to brave it.

456
00:20:31,698 --> 00:20:32,915
I've got an
audience waiting.

457
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:34,783
I'll get
some raincoats.

458
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:37,286
Oh, no, sis-
you're going
in style.

459
00:20:43,926 --> 00:20:46,428
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain speaking.

460
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:48,931
We're running into
a little rough weather,

461
00:20:48,966 --> 00:20:50,799
so fasten your seat belts,
please.

462
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:52,050
It might be a little bumpy.

463
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:56,438
It's going to get rough.

464
00:20:56,473 --> 00:20:58,307
Scared, honey?

465
00:20:58,342 --> 00:21:00,809
Natch... isn't everyone?

466
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,068
What was that for?

467
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:10,702
Hildy...

468
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:11,954
yes?

469
00:21:11,989 --> 00:21:13,822
Thank you.

470
00:21:13,857 --> 00:21:16,325
For what?

471
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,210
Just for being
my sister.

472
00:21:19,246 --> 00:21:22,331
Holy cow,
listen to that!

473
00:21:22,366 --> 00:21:24,216
Fire engines and ambulances!

474
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:27,336
Turn on the radio.

475
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:35,477
Good-bye, hildy.

476
00:21:38,515 --> 00:21:40,349
Good afternoon,

477
00:21:40,384 --> 00:21:42,234
and welcome to
the 3:00 edition...
hello?

478
00:21:42,269 --> 00:21:44,353
Yes, what is it?

479
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:03,505
Yes, jim.

480
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:05,507
I'm out at the park.

481
00:22:05,542 --> 00:22:07,376
I thought you ought to know.

482
00:22:07,411 --> 00:22:08,126
Know what, jim?

483
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:10,012
It's terrible, hildy, horrible.

484
00:22:10,047 --> 00:22:12,514
I've never seen
anything like it.

485
00:22:12,549 --> 00:22:14,383
Jim, will you please tell me
what you're talking about?

486
00:22:14,418 --> 00:22:17,519
The plane crash-
happened just a few minutes ago.

487
00:22:17,554 --> 00:22:19,388
What crash?

488
00:22:19,423 --> 00:22:21,273
Passenger jet, l.a. To new york.

489
00:22:21,308 --> 00:22:23,775
That storm just-just
tore it apart.

490
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:27,529
It landed right in the middle
of the picnic grounds.

491
00:22:27,564 --> 00:22:29,398
Hildy...

492
00:22:29,433 --> 00:22:30,649
your sister, bunny...

493
00:22:30,684 --> 00:22:33,151
bunny's dead, hildy.

494
00:22:33,186 --> 00:22:35,037
Dead? Why, that's crazy.

495
00:22:35,072 --> 00:22:36,905
She was a passenger
on that plane.

496
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,156
She and another woman

497
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:40,659
were sitting right
next to each other.

498
00:22:40,694 --> 00:22:42,544
I just... i just saw them.

499
00:22:42,579 --> 00:22:44,413
Jim, my sister
is right here now.

500
00:22:45,047 --> 00:22:48,166
I saw the body, hildy.

501
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:50,052
Bunny blake is dead.

502
00:22:50,087 --> 00:22:54,423
I'm sorry i have to be
the one to tell you, but...

503
00:22:54,458 --> 00:22:57,059
...while governor nathan has
requested federal aid...

504
00:22:57,094 --> 00:22:58,310
bunny?

505
00:22:58,345 --> 00:22:59,561
Bunny!

506
00:22:59,596 --> 00:23:01,930
Bunny!
Howardville was rocked today

507
00:23:01,965 --> 00:23:03,815
bunny!
By news of a transcontinental
jet air...

508
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:06,935
bunny, where are you?
...87 passengers and crew.

509
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:08,186
The crash occurred...

510
00:23:08,221 --> 00:23:09,438
bunny?

511
00:23:09,473 --> 00:23:10,689
Bunny!

512
00:23:10,724 --> 00:23:11,940
Bunny, where are you?!

513
00:23:11,975 --> 00:23:15,077
...most of the local citizens
had planned to join

514
00:23:15,112 --> 00:23:16,945
the annual founder's day
celebration.

515
00:23:17,579 --> 00:23:20,582
A disaster of major proportions
was averted by the fact

516
00:23:20,617 --> 00:23:23,702
that most of the citizens
in town are safe at this moment

517
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:26,204
attending
an announced performance

518
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:28,090
by our local celebrity,
bunny blake.

519
00:23:28,125 --> 00:23:31,843
How many more would have died
had they attended the picnic?

520
00:23:31,878 --> 00:23:34,346
Fortunately for them,

521
00:23:34,381 --> 00:23:36,848
howardville chose
to see bunny blake.

522
00:23:36,883 --> 00:23:38,717
Eyewitnesses at the scene
of the crash say

523
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:41,219
bunny was a passenger
aboard the ill-fated plane.

524
00:23:41,254 --> 00:23:43,722
But other witnesses have sworn

525
00:23:43,757 --> 00:23:45,607
she was here in howardville
this afternoon

526
00:23:45,642 --> 00:23:47,476
visiting her sister.

527
00:23:47,511 --> 00:23:49,978
Until the mystery is unraveled

528
00:23:50,013 --> 00:23:51,863
only one thing is certain:

529
00:23:51,898 --> 00:23:54,366
Bunny blake is dead.

530
00:23:54,401 --> 00:23:56,234
Meanwhile,
local citizens are asked

531
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:57,986
to stay away from the area.

532
00:23:58,021 --> 00:24:01,123
All howardville fire engine
companies are at the scene.

533
00:24:01,158 --> 00:24:03,625
Police have blocked the
founder's day picnic grounds,

534
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:06,745
and we repeat, local citizens
are asked to avoid the area.

535
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,246
Names of the victims
are being withheld,

536
00:24:08,281 --> 00:24:09,498
pending identification...

537
00:24:09,533 --> 00:24:11,249
we are all travelers.

538
00:24:11,284 --> 00:24:13,752
The trip starts in a place
called birth

539
00:24:13,787 --> 00:24:16,888
and ends in that lonely town
called death.

540
00:24:16,923 --> 00:24:18,757
And that's the end
of the journey,

541
00:24:18,792 --> 00:24:22,511
unless you happen to exist for
a few hours, like bunny blake

542
00:24:22,546 --> 00:24:25,013
in the misty regions
of the twilight zone.

543
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:31,319
And now, mr. Serling.

544
00:24:31,354 --> 00:24:33,188
Ontwilight zonenext time

545
00:24:33,223 --> 00:24:35,073
again the services
of earl hamner jr.,

546
00:24:35,108 --> 00:24:37,576
in a strange story,
a strange conclusion

547
00:24:37,611 --> 00:24:39,444
and a very unusual brand
of justice,

548
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:41,947
dramatized in a show called
"you drive."

549
00:24:41,982 --> 00:24:43,832
It's the story
of a hit-and-run driver

550
00:24:43,867 --> 00:24:45,700
in a very special kind
of an automobile.

551
00:24:45,735 --> 00:24:47,586
A consummately fine actor
named edward andrews

552
00:24:47,621 --> 00:24:50,088
lives out a nightmare
partly of his own making.

553
00:24:50,123 --> 00:24:51,957
Ontwilight zone,"you drive."

554
00:24:51,992 --> 00:24:54,459
I hope you're going
to watch it with us.
