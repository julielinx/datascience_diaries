1
00:00:10,777 --> 00:00:13,279
You're traveling
through another dimension-

2
00:00:13,314 --> 00:00:16,399
a dimension not only of sight
and sound, but of mind,

3
00:00:16,434 --> 00:00:18,284
a journey into a wondrous land

4
00:00:18,319 --> 00:00:20,787
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

5
00:00:20,822 --> 00:00:23,289
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

6
00:00:48,314 --> 00:00:49,566
He ain't here yet.

7
00:00:49,601 --> 00:00:51,434
He'll be along.

8
00:00:51,469 --> 00:00:54,571
He knows what's
waiting for him here.

9
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:58,691
He knows
he's going to get shot.

10
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:01,194
No question
about that.

11
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:04,330
I think i hear
him coming now.

12
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:23,967
Well, it's about time.

13
00:01:24,002 --> 00:01:27,103
You're an hour and 15
minutes late, rance.

14
00:01:27,138 --> 00:01:28,972
Sy, sy, sy,
don't start that.

15
00:01:29,007 --> 00:01:30,607
You know how
emotional scenes

16
00:01:30,642 --> 00:01:32,475
upset me before
we shoot. Ah!

17
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:34,360
Now, don't get
upset, rance...

18
00:01:36,014 --> 00:01:37,730
what do you say
we get started?

19
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:39,616
All right, all right.

20
00:01:39,651 --> 00:01:41,484
This is scene 71.
Got your script?

21
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:42,735
Read it to me.

22
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:44,621
Come on, tommy,
let's go.

23
00:01:44,656 --> 00:01:45,872
Huh? Oh, sorry.

24
00:01:45,907 --> 00:01:47,740
It's the interior,
saloon

25
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:49,626
cover shot of three
bad men at bar.

26
00:01:49,661 --> 00:01:52,128
Rance mcgrew enters,
he walks to bar,

27
00:01:52,163 --> 00:01:54,631
he glances sideways
left and right.

28
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:55,882
"Left and right."

29
00:01:55,917 --> 00:01:57,750
You think my head
is on a swivel?

30
00:01:57,785 --> 00:02:00,753
Listen, sy, when a
cowboy walks into a bar,

31
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:03,256
he walks straight to the
other end of the room,

32
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:06,392
then he takes his drink
and looks atthat,

33
00:02:06,427 --> 00:02:07,894
then looks
straight ahead.

34
00:02:07,929 --> 00:02:09,395
He doesn't look
left and right.

35
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:12,398
All right, rance,
we'll shoot it your way-

36
00:02:12,433 --> 00:02:14,267
any way you want.

37
00:02:14,302 --> 00:02:15,518
Now, can we begin?

38
00:02:15,768 --> 00:02:17,654
In a minute,
in a minute.

39
00:02:17,689 --> 00:02:19,522
My stomach is
killing me.

40
00:02:19,557 --> 00:02:23,276
These scenes,
these miserable
emotional scenes.

41
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:29,165
All right, laddies,
let's get this one this time.

42
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,416
This is scene 71.

43
00:02:30,451 --> 00:02:34,170
It's a cover shot
of rance entering the saloon.

44
00:02:34,205 --> 00:02:37,290
Now, let's get with it,
fellas, please.

45
00:02:37,325 --> 00:02:39,175
We're way behind.

46
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:41,678
Second team out.
The star is here.

47
00:02:44,797 --> 00:02:46,683
Some 100-odd years ago,

48
00:02:46,718 --> 00:02:49,185
a motley collection
of tough moustaches

49
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,937
galloped across the west

50
00:02:50,972 --> 00:02:54,057
and left behind a raft
of legends and legerdemains.

51
00:02:54,092 --> 00:02:55,942
And it seems
a reasonable conjecture

52
00:02:55,977 --> 00:02:59,062
that if there are any television
sets up in cowboy heaven

53
00:02:59,097 --> 00:03:01,564
any one of these rough
and woolly nail-eaters could see

54
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,815
with what careless abandon

55
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:05,318
their names and exploits
are being bandied about.

56
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:07,820
They're very likely turning over
in their graves-

57
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:10,323
or worse, getting out of them.

58
00:03:10,358 --> 00:03:11,574
Which gives you a clue

59
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:14,077
as to the proceedings
that will begin in just a moment

60
00:03:14,112 --> 00:03:15,962
when one mr. Rance mcgrew,

61
00:03:15,997 --> 00:03:17,830
a 3,000-buck-a-week
phony baloney,

62
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:20,967
discovers that this week's
current edition of make-believe

63
00:03:21,002 --> 00:03:22,835
is being shot on location

64
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:27,840
and that location
is the twilight zone.

65
00:03:45,074 --> 00:03:47,193
Six-gun...

66
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:14,103
dress it up.

67
00:04:14,138 --> 00:04:15,355
We'll wait

68
00:04:15,605 --> 00:04:17,473
for the
new glass.

69
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:23,730
You win.

70
00:04:24,981 --> 00:04:26,232
You ready out
there, rance?

71
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:28,117
Yes.

72
00:04:28,152 --> 00:04:29,369
All right. Action.

73
00:04:51,007 --> 00:04:52,642
Rotgut whiskey.

74
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,016
All right, wise guy.

75
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:03,152
Cut.

76
00:05:03,187 --> 00:05:05,905
He put english on that
deliberately.

77
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,657
An english
on a bottle?

78
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:10,777
Guy needs a
catcher's mitt.

79
00:05:10,812 --> 00:05:13,029
All right,
let's try it again.

80
00:05:13,064 --> 00:05:14,280
From the bottle.

81
00:05:14,315 --> 00:05:18,034
All right,
positions,
please.

82
00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:20,787
Scene 71... again.

83
00:05:22,707 --> 00:05:24,540
Action.

84
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:03,329
Guess you boys know
i'm the marshal.

85
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:07,467
We heard tell.

86
00:06:07,502 --> 00:06:09,085
I guess you know that i know

87
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,221
jesse james is coming here
looking for me.

88
00:06:12,256 --> 00:06:13,589
I know that, too.

89
00:06:13,624 --> 00:06:14,841
Likewise.

90
00:06:14,876 --> 00:06:17,343
There's something else i know
that you don't know-

91
00:06:17,378 --> 00:06:19,846
that you don't know that i know
that you know jesse james.

92
00:06:22,732 --> 00:06:25,485
You tell him i'm going
to be here waiting.

93
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,353
I'll be right here waiting.

94
00:06:27,388 --> 00:06:29,489
Now, we hear the
horse ride up,

95
00:06:29,524 --> 00:06:31,491
he stops, dismounts...

96
00:06:31,526 --> 00:06:32,492
and he appears
on the porch.

97
00:06:32,527 --> 00:06:33,743
Figured i'd bluffed you.

98
00:06:33,778 --> 00:06:36,245
Here already, ain't he?

99
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,497
Marshal, marshal, please.

100
00:06:37,532 --> 00:06:38,748
No killing in here.

101
00:06:38,783 --> 00:06:40,616
Oh, i ain't aiming
to kill him.

102
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:43,119
Just going to maim
him a little bit.

103
00:06:43,154 --> 00:06:45,621
Just going to pick
off his pinkie.

104
00:06:45,656 --> 00:06:48,758
Jesse ain't going to
take kindly to that.
No.

105
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:57,133
Cut.

106
00:06:58,384 --> 00:07:00,269
All right, we'll
bring in jesse here.

107
00:07:00,304 --> 00:07:01,521
Ready, jesse?

108
00:07:01,556 --> 00:07:02,772
Yes.

109
00:07:02,807 --> 00:07:04,023
Action.

110
00:07:15,785 --> 00:07:17,403
Marshal mcgrew, ain't it?

111
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:23,292
Yip.

112
00:07:23,327 --> 00:07:26,412
You're about to breathe
your last, marshal.

113
00:07:42,812 --> 00:07:44,680
Can't win 'em all.

114
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:03,449
All right, jesse,

115
00:08:03,484 --> 00:08:05,334
this is it-

116
00:08:05,369 --> 00:08:07,203
you and me,

117
00:08:07,238 --> 00:08:08,454
man to man.

118
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:14,961
Stuntman!

119
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:17,463
Okay.

120
00:08:21,851 --> 00:08:23,102
Stuntman! Stuntman!

121
00:08:28,724 --> 00:08:29,976
Stuntman.

122
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:43,122
All right, cut and print it.

123
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:49,378
Good show,
really good show.

124
00:08:49,413 --> 00:08:51,247
Thanks a lot,
mr. Mcgrew.

125
00:08:51,282 --> 00:08:54,383
All right, boys, this
is the death scene.

126
00:08:54,418 --> 00:08:55,635
Rance, in the bar.

127
00:08:56,886 --> 00:08:58,754
Jesse lies
over there.

128
00:08:58,789 --> 00:09:00,640
Rance thinks
that he's unconscious.

129
00:09:00,675 --> 00:09:03,142
Jesse takes a gun
up off the floor

130
00:09:03,177 --> 00:09:05,011
and fires
at rance's back.

131
00:09:05,046 --> 00:09:05,645
At his back?

132
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,513
That's right.

133
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:10,016
Now, look, sy,
i don't want to fight you

134
00:09:10,051 --> 00:09:13,152
but that's not
how jesse james used to operate.

135
00:09:13,187 --> 00:09:15,021
He fought pretty fair.

136
00:09:15,056 --> 00:09:16,906
Can't i yell
something?

137
00:09:16,941 --> 00:09:20,026
Oh, that's thinking, that's
real creative thinking-

138
00:09:20,061 --> 00:09:23,779
warn the fastest gun in the west
that he's about to be shot.

139
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:26,916
Look, when you're up
against rance mcgrew

140
00:09:26,951 --> 00:09:29,418
you play it dirty,
or you play it dead.

141
00:09:29,453 --> 00:09:31,287
Now, let's
get on with it.

142
00:09:31,322 --> 00:09:32,538
This is cola.

143
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:34,423
I told you i wanted ginger ale.

144
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,676
It's got to look like whiskey.

145
00:09:36,711 --> 00:09:37,927
Sy,

146
00:09:37,962 --> 00:09:39,795
either straighten this oaf out
or fire him.

147
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:42,932
Mr. Mcgrew wants
ginger ale.

148
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:47,053
Okay, ginger ale.

149
00:09:47,088 --> 00:09:49,555
Your head against the bar,
feet out here.

150
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,806
I don't care what he says.

151
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:53,309
Jesse james wouldn't shoot
anybody in the back.

152
00:09:53,344 --> 00:09:55,811
Yeah,
but rance mcgrew would.

153
00:09:55,846 --> 00:09:58,447
All right,
let's get with it.

154
00:09:58,482 --> 00:10:00,316
Scene 93, take one.

155
00:10:00,351 --> 00:10:05,321
And, rance, baby,
easy on the mirror.

156
00:10:07,823 --> 00:10:09,709
Action!

157
00:10:22,123 --> 00:10:24,590
Why, you stupid clod,
this is whiskey.

158
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:25,841
This is real whiskey!

159
00:10:36,986 --> 00:10:38,237
Marshal, marshal-

160
00:10:38,272 --> 00:10:40,106
jesse's gunning for you.

161
00:10:40,141 --> 00:10:41,357
He's coming right now.

162
00:10:41,392 --> 00:10:42,608
Why, you cementhead,

163
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:46,362
he already came in
in scene 73.

164
00:10:46,397 --> 00:10:50,116
I'm going to call my agent,
and this time he'd better be in.

165
00:11:02,011 --> 00:11:04,513
They call me
jesse james-

166
00:11:04,548 --> 00:11:07,016
therealjesse james

167
00:11:07,051 --> 00:11:10,770
not that side of pork
that's been playacting me.

168
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,772
Cut.

169
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:16,025
Cut!

170
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,777
Shouldn't we cut?

171
00:11:19,028 --> 00:11:22,148
For pete's sake, somebody...

172
00:11:22,183 --> 00:11:23,399
let's cut!

173
00:11:33,542 --> 00:11:35,661
I'd be looking for the marshal.

174
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:37,546
Fella named mcgrew.

175
00:11:37,581 --> 00:11:39,415
Rance mcgrew.

176
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:41,917
Thataway.

177
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:46,305
You wouldn't
be him, huh?

178
00:11:52,561 --> 00:11:55,064
Where's the fella
who loaned me this vest?

179
00:11:55,099 --> 00:11:56,932
Marshal, i think
maybe you and me

180
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:58,818
better have a little talk.

181
00:11:58,853 --> 00:12:00,069
Maybe a long talk,
maybe a short talk,

182
00:12:00,104 --> 00:12:01,937
but a talk.

183
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:04,440
You're supposed to be tough.

184
00:12:04,475 --> 00:12:06,325
You don't look so tough to me.

185
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,576
You know what you look like?

186
00:12:07,611 --> 00:12:10,079
Well, i haven't been
too well lately.

187
00:12:10,114 --> 00:12:13,199
You look kind of
like a marshmallow.

188
00:12:13,234 --> 00:12:14,450
Mm. Mm.

189
00:12:14,485 --> 00:12:16,335
Don't that rile you none?

190
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:20,589
Come on, marshal.

191
00:12:20,624 --> 00:12:22,458
First we'll have a drink.

192
00:12:22,493 --> 00:12:23,709
Then we'll have a talk.

193
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:25,594
Then we'll have a showdown.

194
00:12:25,629 --> 00:12:28,097
Two whiskeys...
just leave the bottles.

195
00:12:50,619 --> 00:12:53,739
Marshmallow.

196
00:13:44,673 --> 00:13:48,427
You don't do nothing very well,
do you, mr. Mcgrew?

197
00:13:53,334 --> 00:13:54,433
Don't that rile you none?

198
00:13:54,468 --> 00:13:56,936
No.

199
00:13:56,971 --> 00:13:58,804
You're just about
the most even-tempered dude

200
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:00,055
i ever did meet.

201
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:02,691
However...

202
00:14:02,726 --> 00:14:05,194
i got no time to be social,
marshal.

203
00:14:06,061 --> 00:14:09,198
It's time we come
to a meeting of the minds.

204
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:14,820
Why do you suppose they're
all taking cover, marshal?

205
00:14:17,206 --> 00:14:18,457
Closing time?

206
00:14:19,825 --> 00:14:22,962
Yes... yes,
it's curfew.

207
00:14:22,997 --> 00:14:24,213
Well, good-bye, jesse,

208
00:14:24,248 --> 00:14:27,333
and it's been really
very nice meeting you.

209
00:14:27,368 --> 00:14:29,218
Marshal!

210
00:14:29,253 --> 00:14:31,086
Just hold it
right there.

211
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:32,338
Hmm?

212
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,725
You wasn't leavin',
was you, marshal?

213
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,845
I mean, you wasn't
just going to walk out,

214
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,729
was you?

215
00:14:40,764 --> 00:14:42,598
No, no, no, i just, uh...

216
00:14:42,633 --> 00:14:45,100
wanted to see if
it was going to rain.

217
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:48,354
No, not going to rain.

218
00:14:48,389 --> 00:14:50,105
I thought
you was playing

219
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,357
some kind
of trick on me.

220
00:14:51,392 --> 00:14:53,242
Like the time
that bad guy

221
00:14:53,277 --> 00:14:55,110
had you covered
in the back

222
00:14:55,145 --> 00:14:57,613
and you went through
the swinging doors

223
00:14:57,648 --> 00:14:59,114
and swung
one door back

224
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:00,366
and knocked
the gun away.

225
00:15:00,401 --> 00:15:02,868
That was the first show
last season.

226
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:06,005
Or those rustlers
waiting to bushwhack you.

227
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,873
Ten or 11, wasn't it?

228
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:10,009
Uh, 13.

229
00:15:10,044 --> 00:15:12,511
I got nominated for an emmy
on that one.

230
00:15:12,546 --> 00:15:13,762
Oh, i bet
you did.

231
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,764
I just bet you did.

232
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:19,518
Folks couldn't help but admire
a man of your talents.

233
00:15:24,058 --> 00:15:27,142
You know,
the thing of it is, marshal,

234
00:15:27,177 --> 00:15:28,527
thing of it is...

235
00:15:28,562 --> 00:15:33,532
i don't believe you ever fired a
real gun in your life, did you?

236
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:38,153
Did you ever hit a man in anger

237
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:39,788
or get hit
in anger yourself?

238
00:15:39,823 --> 00:15:42,291
Tell me, do you ever
ride a horse?

239
00:15:42,326 --> 00:15:44,910
On... on occasion.

240
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:50,299
So you don't shoot, you don't
ride and you don't fight.

241
00:15:50,334 --> 00:15:51,166
You just
strut around

242
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,052
going through
the motions

243
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:56,055
of killing off fellows like me.

244
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:57,306
Now, i wouldn't
say that.

245
00:15:57,923 --> 00:15:59,174
Now, last... last year,

246
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:00,426
we had one script

247
00:16:00,461 --> 00:16:02,928
in which one of the
dalton boys went free.

248
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:04,813
He told me about it.

249
00:16:04,848 --> 00:16:06,682
He also told
how you captured him.

250
00:16:06,717 --> 00:16:08,934
You jumped 800
feet off a cliff

251
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:13,072
and landed on the back of his
horse when he wasn't looking.

252
00:16:13,107 --> 00:16:16,825
Now, marshal, did you ever
jump 800 feet off a cliff

253
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,193
and land on
a man's horse?

254
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:21,330
Heights... heights make me...

255
00:16:21,365 --> 00:16:22,581
ill.

256
00:16:22,616 --> 00:16:23,832
That figures.

257
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:26,702
We had a meeting up there-

258
00:16:26,737 --> 00:16:29,204
me, my brother frank,
the dalton boys,

259
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:30,956
sam starr,
billy the kid,

260
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:32,207
quite a
few others.

261
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:33,709
And the consensus was

262
00:16:33,744 --> 00:16:36,845
that you wasn't doing a thing
for our good names.

263
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,714
So they chose me
to come down here

264
00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:41,216
and maybe take
a little of the shine

265
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:42,217
off your pants.

266
00:16:42,252 --> 00:16:43,469
How's that?

267
00:16:43,504 --> 00:16:44,353
Don't you get it?

268
00:16:44,388 --> 00:16:46,221
We see you week after week

269
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:48,724
killing off this guy
and that guy,

270
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:51,226
capturing that bushwhacker
and that rustler.

271
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:53,112
But all the time winning.

272
00:16:53,362 --> 00:16:55,230
Man, you just
don't lose.

273
00:16:55,265 --> 00:16:57,116
You are the
winningest fellow

274
00:16:57,151 --> 00:16:59,618
that ever come
down the pike.

275
00:16:59,653 --> 00:17:03,622
So me and my friends,
we figured that maybe just once

276
00:17:03,657 --> 00:17:05,491
you ought
to lose.

277
00:17:05,526 --> 00:17:07,993
Mm-hmm, yes, yes,
that's a very good idea

278
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:11,130
and iwilltake that up
with the producer.

279
00:17:11,165 --> 00:17:13,882
I don't think
there'll be time
to take it up

280
00:17:13,917 --> 00:17:17,002
because mister,
you're going to
lose right now.

281
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:18,253
I'll tell you what:

282
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:20,139
I'm going to be
square with you-

283
00:17:20,174 --> 00:17:23,258
a lot squarer than you
ever been with any of us.

284
00:17:23,293 --> 00:17:25,144
Face-to-face,
and no, uh...

285
00:17:25,179 --> 00:17:27,012
what do you call
them, stuntmen?

286
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:29,515
Out on the street,
you and me-

287
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:32,017
you coming down one
side of the street,

288
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:33,268
me coming
down the other.

289
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:35,154
But that...
that's been done.

290
00:17:35,189 --> 00:17:37,656
Didn't you see
gunfight at red rock?

291
00:17:37,691 --> 00:17:38,907
Lousy.
Didn't like it?

292
00:17:38,942 --> 00:17:40,159
Let's go, marshal.

293
00:17:43,779 --> 00:17:46,281
Now, you come
around this corner,

294
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:48,167
and i'll come around
that corner.

295
00:17:48,202 --> 00:17:50,035
I'll let you make
the first move.

296
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:52,538
Nothing could be
fairer, could it?

297
00:17:52,921 --> 00:17:54,173
Oh, my, no, no indeed.

298
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:56,675
Well, uh... shall we
say tomorrow afternoon?

299
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:59,178
This afternoon... now.

300
00:18:00,429 --> 00:18:02,931
Why does it have to be
thisafternoon?

301
00:18:02,966 --> 00:18:05,434
Could have been
tomorrow afternoon.

302
00:18:05,469 --> 00:18:07,302
Rush, rush, rush.

303
00:18:07,337 --> 00:18:09,805
Rush, rush, rush,
that's all anybody knows

304
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,307
is rush, rush, rush.

305
00:18:23,318 --> 00:18:25,204
Marshal?

306
00:18:28,957 --> 00:18:30,826
Where are you, marshal?

307
00:18:33,328 --> 00:18:34,580
Come on out, marshal!

308
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:40,586
Come on out, marshal.

309
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,222
Marshal,
where are you?

310
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:50,596
Come on,
marshal.

311
00:18:58,103 --> 00:19:00,239
Marshal,
i'm going to count to five,

312
00:19:00,274 --> 00:19:02,107
then we're both going to draw.

313
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:03,358
One...

314
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:06,495
this is ridiculous-
it's never done this way.

315
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:07,746
Two...

316
00:19:07,781 --> 00:19:10,616
i'm just doing this series
for the residuals.

317
00:19:10,651 --> 00:19:11,867
Three...

318
00:19:11,902 --> 00:19:15,003
and because they let me use
my own name as the character.

319
00:19:15,038 --> 00:19:16,755
Four...

320
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:19,875
i suppose you
know i have an
aging mother

321
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:22,878
and millions of
fans all over
this country,

322
00:19:22,913 --> 00:19:24,763
and they're going
to hate you for this.

323
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:26,632
And a lot of them
are just like my old mother.

324
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:29,134
You're killing
an american institution.

325
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:30,385
Five.

326
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,271
Stuntman! Stuntman!

327
00:19:32,306 --> 00:19:33,021
Reach, marshal.

328
00:19:43,532 --> 00:19:44,900
Just like i figured-

329
00:19:44,935 --> 00:19:46,785
this guy couldn't
outdraw a crayon.

330
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:49,288
Give me a break,
will you, jesse?

331
00:19:49,323 --> 00:19:50,539
Jesse, give me a break.

332
00:19:50,574 --> 00:19:52,407
I'm too young to die.

333
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:56,161
I'll do anything you say, jesse,
just give me a break.

334
00:19:56,795 --> 00:19:59,414
You say you got nominated
for an emmy?

335
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:00,299
Two, two.

336
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:03,418
You can't act
any better than
you can draw.

337
00:20:03,453 --> 00:20:05,921
Jesse, jesse,
just give me a break.

338
00:20:05,956 --> 00:20:09,675
I'll do anything you say,
you... you... you just name it.

339
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,176
Anything?

340
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:12,060
You just name it.

341
00:20:14,429 --> 00:20:18,817
Marshal, maybe you and me ain't
too far away from a bargain.

342
00:20:18,852 --> 00:20:21,320
I don't know exactly
what it is i want,

343
00:20:21,355 --> 00:20:23,822
but i'll sure think
about it some.

344
00:20:23,857 --> 00:20:26,074
You're not going
to shoot me down?

345
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:28,076
Nope.

346
00:20:29,945 --> 00:20:31,830
Tell you what i will do.

347
00:20:31,865 --> 00:20:33,699
I'm going to stick around

348
00:20:33,734 --> 00:20:37,452
make sure that you have
to play it careful from now on.

349
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:42,457
We may be stiffs up there...

350
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:44,343
but we're sensitive.

351
00:20:50,098 --> 00:20:50,716
Jesse?

352
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:59,975
Jesse?

353
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,363
It isn't whiskey,
mr. Mcgrew

354
00:21:04,398 --> 00:21:06,865
it's ginger ale,
just like you ordered.

355
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:11,236
Are you all right,
rance?

356
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:14,373
Yes, yes, i'm...
i'm all right.

357
00:21:14,408 --> 00:21:15,624
Where'd you all go?

358
00:21:15,659 --> 00:21:18,744
Where'd we go?
We didn't go anywhere.

359
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:20,629
You sure
you're all right?

360
00:21:20,664 --> 00:21:21,880
Yeah, yeah, i'm fine.

361
00:21:21,915 --> 00:21:24,383
All right, now,
let's get this shot now.

362
00:21:24,418 --> 00:21:26,251
Jesse's on
the floor.

363
00:21:26,286 --> 00:21:28,136
You think
he's unconscious.

364
00:21:28,171 --> 00:21:29,755
Somebody wants to talk to you,

365
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:31,006
mr. Mcgrew.

366
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:32,891
We're shooting
a scene.

367
00:21:32,926 --> 00:21:34,760
He says he's rance's agent.

368
00:21:34,795 --> 00:21:36,645
My agent?

369
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,765
Look, i don't know what
the chain of command is,

370
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,016
so go out
and talk to him.

371
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:42,901
Find out what
it ishewants

372
00:21:42,936 --> 00:21:44,152
what it isyouwant

373
00:21:44,187 --> 00:21:46,021
and what it is
we can shoot.

374
00:21:54,663 --> 00:21:55,914
Howdy, marshal.

375
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:04,673
You said "anything,"

376
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:06,541
and "anything" is
the following:

377
00:22:06,576 --> 00:22:09,044
I'm going to stick around
from picture to picture

378
00:22:09,678 --> 00:22:12,180
to make sure you don't
hurt no more feelings.

379
00:22:12,215 --> 00:22:13,432
Now, in this scene,

380
00:22:13,467 --> 00:22:15,300
jesse don't shoot
you in the back.

381
00:22:15,335 --> 00:22:17,803
He's lost blood,
he's weak as tea,

382
00:22:17,838 --> 00:22:19,054
but he can still get up

383
00:22:19,089 --> 00:22:20,939
knock you through
that window

384
00:22:20,974 --> 00:22:22,808
and make his getaway.

385
00:22:22,843 --> 00:22:24,059
Is that understood?

386
00:22:24,094 --> 00:22:27,195
He knocked me,
rance mcgrew,
through a window?

387
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:28,447
Why, it's... it's...

388
00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:41,576
sy?

389
00:22:41,611 --> 00:22:42,828
Yeah?

390
00:22:42,863 --> 00:22:44,713
Sy, uh, i have a great idea

391
00:22:44,748 --> 00:22:47,215
for something
i think might be a fun shot.

392
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:48,467
Uh...

393
00:22:50,719 --> 00:22:51,970
what?!

394
00:22:52,005 --> 00:22:53,839
Are you out
of your mind?

395
00:22:53,874 --> 00:22:55,724
Jesse does what?

396
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:57,726
Oh, rance...

397
00:22:57,761 --> 00:23:00,228
all right.

398
00:23:00,263 --> 00:23:02,731
Scene 93, take two.

399
00:23:02,766 --> 00:23:04,232
Action.

400
00:23:09,604 --> 00:23:10,856
Now, that was
just fine.

401
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,358
Now, about next
week's episode

402
00:23:13,393 --> 00:23:15,243
the one where
you knock the gun

403
00:23:15,278 --> 00:23:17,112
out of billy
the kid's hand

404
00:23:17,147 --> 00:23:19,614
from a fourth-story window
a half a block away

405
00:23:19,649 --> 00:23:21,500
with the base
of a lamp.

406
00:23:21,535 --> 00:23:22,751
No good, huh?

407
00:23:22,786 --> 00:23:24,002
It stinks.

408
00:23:24,037 --> 00:23:25,871
The way i see
it is this:

409
00:23:25,906 --> 00:23:29,624
Now, billy,
he hears you,

410
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:32,127
and he whirls around,

411
00:23:32,761 --> 00:23:35,263
and he fires from the hip,

412
00:23:35,298 --> 00:23:38,383
and he shoots the lamp
right out of your hand.

413
00:23:40,268 --> 00:23:42,137
Now, in two weeks,

414
00:23:42,172 --> 00:23:45,273
i think we ought to
give sam starr a break.

415
00:23:45,308 --> 00:23:48,393
He's a real nice fella-
awful good to his mother.

416
00:23:48,428 --> 00:23:49,895
Haw!

417
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:52,531
The evolution of the
so-called adult western

418
00:23:52,566 --> 00:23:55,033
and the metamorphosis
of one rance mcgrew,

419
00:23:55,068 --> 00:23:58,153
formerly phony baloney,
now upright citizen

420
00:23:58,188 --> 00:24:00,038
with a preoccupation
with all things

421
00:24:00,073 --> 00:24:03,792
involving tradition, truth
and cowpoke predecessors.

422
00:24:03,827 --> 00:24:07,546
It's the way the cookie crumbles
and the six-gun shoots

423
00:24:07,581 --> 00:24:10,048
in the twilight zone.

424
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:15,670
Rod serling,
creator ofthe twilight zone,

425
00:24:15,705 --> 00:24:18,173
will tell you
about next week's story

426
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:21,376
after this message.

427
00:24:21,411 --> 00:24:23,562
And now, mr. Serling.

428
00:24:23,597 --> 00:24:26,064
For all of us,
even the most young at heart,

429
00:24:26,099 --> 00:24:27,933
i suppose
there's a little kernel of want

430
00:24:27,968 --> 00:24:29,818
having to do
with reliving childhood-

431
00:24:29,853 --> 00:24:32,320
that grand and glorious
moment in time

432
00:24:32,355 --> 00:24:34,823
when the biggest guy around
is the patrol boy.

433
00:24:34,858 --> 00:24:37,325
Next week onthe twilight zone,
this moment is recaptured

434
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,828
in george clayton johnson's
exceptionally sensitive story

435
00:24:39,863 --> 00:24:41,696
called "kick the can."

436
00:24:41,731 --> 00:24:46,084
It costars mr. Ernest truex
and mr. Russell collins.

437
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:48,587
If the tobaccos in a cigarette
are good enough,

438
00:24:48,622 --> 00:24:50,455
they alone
will give mellow richness

439
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:51,706
and satisfactory mildness.

440
00:24:51,741 --> 00:24:53,592
Try chesterfields
and you'll discover

441
00:24:53,627 --> 00:24:58,597
21 great tobaccos
make 20 wonderful smokes.

442
00:25:28,577 --> 00:25:30,462
This is james arness.

443
00:25:30,497 --> 00:25:32,330
You know, it's only a short hop

444
00:25:32,365 --> 00:25:34,833
fromthe twilight zone
to dodge city ingunsmoke.

445
00:25:34,868 --> 00:25:37,335
Saturday nights
over most of these stations.
