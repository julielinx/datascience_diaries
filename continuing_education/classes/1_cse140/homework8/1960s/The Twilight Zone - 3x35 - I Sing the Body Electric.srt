1
00:00:10,545 --> 00:00:13,013
You're traveling
through another dimension-

2
00:00:13,048 --> 00:00:16,132
a dimension not only of sight
and sound, but of mind,

3
00:00:16,167 --> 00:00:18,018
a journey into a wondrous land

4
00:00:18,053 --> 00:00:19,886
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

5
00:00:19,921 --> 00:00:22,389
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

6
00:00:38,655 --> 00:00:41,157
I understand
how you feel, nedra.

7
00:00:41,192 --> 00:00:42,409
Well, george,

8
00:00:42,444 --> 00:00:43,660
i'm going to
tell you this,

9
00:00:43,695 --> 00:00:44,911
and i want you
to hear me out

10
00:00:44,946 --> 00:00:46,162
because i'm
not going

11
00:00:46,197 --> 00:00:47,414
to repeat it.

12
00:00:47,449 --> 00:00:48,665
Baby-sitters
and nurses

13
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,801
are not the same thing
as parental care.

14
00:00:51,836 --> 00:00:55,555
It's been a year
since their mother died,

15
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,058
and little anne has
become more sickly

16
00:00:58,093 --> 00:00:59,309
and hostile
every day.

17
00:00:59,344 --> 00:01:01,811
She's unhappy and
she's insecure.

18
00:01:01,846 --> 00:01:03,313
Well, you're right
about anne, nedra,

19
00:01:03,348 --> 00:01:05,815
but tom and karen
are happy enough.

20
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:06,433
Oh, nonsense.

21
00:01:06,468 --> 00:01:08,318
They're only
covering up.

22
00:01:08,353 --> 00:01:10,186
They're sad,
unhappy children.

23
00:01:10,221 --> 00:01:12,689
They have no base,
they have no anchor.

24
00:01:12,724 --> 00:01:14,574
They have no direction.

25
00:01:14,609 --> 00:01:17,077
They're like little
flotsam and jetsam.

26
00:01:17,112 --> 00:01:18,328
Nedra, it takes time.

27
00:01:18,363 --> 00:01:20,196
Anne needs more time.

28
00:01:20,231 --> 00:01:21,448
So do i.

29
00:01:21,483 --> 00:01:22,699
You'vehadtime.

30
00:01:22,734 --> 00:01:23,950
This is ridiculous.

31
00:01:23,985 --> 00:01:26,453
Anne's problem is
a kind of sickness,

32
00:01:26,488 --> 00:01:28,338
and it's getting
worse and worse

33
00:01:28,373 --> 00:01:29,589
and without guidance,

34
00:01:29,624 --> 00:01:31,458
she isn't going
to be any better

35
00:01:31,493 --> 00:01:33,343
two weeks from now
or a month from now.

36
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,594
Nedra...

37
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:46,356
where are my dears?

38
00:01:48,224 --> 00:01:50,110
Your father and i
have had a very probing talk.

39
00:01:50,145 --> 00:01:52,612
A very revealing one.

40
00:01:52,647 --> 00:01:53,730
And i told him,

41
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:55,615
and i see
no reason

42
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:56,866
why i shouldn't
tell you.

43
00:01:56,901 --> 00:01:58,618
I'm not at all pleased

44
00:01:58,653 --> 00:01:59,869
with the way things have gone
in this house

45
00:01:59,904 --> 00:02:01,121
since your
poor mother died-

46
00:02:01,156 --> 00:02:04,874
not at all pleased;
not at all pleased.

47
00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:07,994
I'll be in touch
with you.

48
00:02:08,029 --> 00:02:09,879
George, you can be sure

49
00:02:09,914 --> 00:02:11,748
i won't lose touch.

50
00:02:11,783 --> 00:02:13,133
I'm sure of that, nedra.

51
00:02:13,168 --> 00:02:15,635
Well, good-bye
for now, then.

52
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,006
Good-bye, anne, dear.

53
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:24,394
Oh, you poor,
poor little dears.

54
00:02:24,429 --> 00:02:28,148
Poor, unhappy
little dears.

55
00:02:28,183 --> 00:02:30,650
Good-bye, children.

56
00:02:30,685 --> 00:02:32,519
Bye, aunt nedra.

57
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:35,522
She wants to
take us away,

58
00:02:35,557 --> 00:02:36,773
doesn't she, dad?

59
00:02:36,808 --> 00:02:38,024
Does she, daddy?

60
00:02:38,059 --> 00:02:40,777
Is that what
she was here for?

61
00:02:43,279 --> 00:02:44,664
She doesn't approve

62
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:46,533
of the way i'm
bringing you up.

63
00:02:46,568 --> 00:02:47,784
She says
i'm too busy.

64
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:49,669
Perhaps i am.

65
00:02:49,704 --> 00:02:54,040
She says that your sitters
and nurses have been, uh,

66
00:02:54,075 --> 00:02:57,177
well, too mean
or too nice...

67
00:02:57,212 --> 00:03:00,296
or too young
or too old.

68
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,935
She says that
you're unhappy.

69
00:03:10,306 --> 00:03:11,558
Are you unhappy?

70
00:03:11,593 --> 00:03:14,060
Oh, of course not.

71
00:03:14,095 --> 00:03:16,563
Well, love
you don't need.

72
00:03:20,316 --> 00:03:22,819
Love i can give you.

73
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:28,458
But guidance...

74
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,080
how do you buy guidance
for your children?

75
00:03:34,115 --> 00:03:38,334
Someone here
all the time.

76
00:03:38,369 --> 00:03:42,722
Someone around
who cares.

77
00:03:42,757 --> 00:03:46,476
What do you do, advertise?

78
00:03:46,511 --> 00:03:53,349
Some kind, gentle soul
who will care."

79
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:58,738
Dad?

80
00:03:58,773 --> 00:04:00,857
Hmm?

81
00:04:00,892 --> 00:04:02,859
Listen to this:

82
00:04:02,894 --> 00:04:05,361
"I sing the
body electric."

83
00:04:05,396 --> 00:04:06,613
What does that mean?

84
00:04:06,648 --> 00:04:08,498
"Sing the body electric"

85
00:04:08,533 --> 00:04:10,366
is the motto of
facsimile limited.

86
00:04:10,401 --> 00:04:12,752
"I sing the body electric"?

87
00:04:12,787 --> 00:04:14,003
Let me see that, tom.

88
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:19,626
"Inventors and makers
of electrical shadows,

89
00:04:19,661 --> 00:04:22,762
"effigies, mimics,
mannequins. Dr. Cheyney.

90
00:04:22,797 --> 00:04:23,880
"To parents who worry

91
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,382
"about inadequate nurses
and schools,

92
00:04:26,417 --> 00:04:27,634
"who are concerned

93
00:04:27,669 --> 00:04:31,387
"with the moral and social
development of their children,

94
00:04:31,422 --> 00:04:32,639
"we have perfected

95
00:04:32,674 --> 00:04:35,141
an electronic
data processing system."

96
00:04:35,176 --> 00:04:36,776
An electric...?

97
00:04:36,811 --> 00:04:39,279
Well, what does
that mean, daddy?

98
00:04:39,314 --> 00:04:41,648
"An electronic
data processing system

99
00:04:41,683 --> 00:04:44,150
in the shape
of an elderly woman built..."

100
00:04:44,185 --> 00:04:45,652
a woman?

101
00:04:45,687 --> 00:04:48,538
Yeah. Sort of a robot.

102
00:04:48,573 --> 00:04:51,791
"...a woman
built with precision.

103
00:04:52,408 --> 00:04:54,911
"With the incredible ability

104
00:04:54,946 --> 00:04:59,165
of giving loving supervision
to your family."

105
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,668
Can they build
a machine

106
00:05:01,703 --> 00:05:03,419
like a human?

107
00:05:03,454 --> 00:05:05,305
I don't know.

108
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,424
It doesn't...
it doesn't sound so good.

109
00:05:08,459 --> 00:05:12,178
But maybe we ought
to investigate.

110
00:05:12,213 --> 00:05:15,932
I sing the body electric.

111
00:05:15,967 --> 00:05:19,185
They make a fairly
convincing pitch here.

112
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,688
It doesn't seem possible,
though,

113
00:05:21,723 --> 00:05:25,441
to find a woman who must be
ten times better than mother

114
00:05:25,476 --> 00:05:27,327
in order to seem half as good,

115
00:05:27,362 --> 00:05:29,829
except, of course,
in the twilight zone.

116
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:50,216
Are they going
to make her out of wicker?

117
00:05:50,251 --> 00:05:51,467
Well, l-i
don't know.

118
00:05:51,502 --> 00:05:53,353
Let's wait and see.

119
00:05:57,974 --> 00:06:00,476
Won't you come in, please?

120
00:06:00,511 --> 00:06:02,362
We've been expecting you.

121
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,491
Just to convince you
that facsimile limited

122
00:06:15,526 --> 00:06:18,628
can do everything
that it claims that it can.

123
00:06:18,663 --> 00:06:20,496
This way, please.

124
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:28,638
Eyes- soft brown, vivid blue.

125
00:06:28,673 --> 00:06:30,506
Any color you choose.

126
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:39,015
Hair- white, grey, red, brown.

127
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,900
Aren't they beautiful?

128
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:50,276
Ears- all sizes,
all shapes.

129
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:08,177
Slender or sturdy.

130
00:07:12,548 --> 00:07:14,434
Short or tall.

131
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,945
This can't be...

132
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,196
oh, no.

133
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:29,699
These are just
the bits and pieces.

134
00:07:29,734 --> 00:07:31,567
Just the eyes,
the lips, the limbs

135
00:07:31,602 --> 00:07:34,070
from which you will choose
the elements

136
00:07:34,105 --> 00:07:35,955
which will become your, uh...

137
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:37,573
grandmother?

138
00:07:37,608 --> 00:07:39,709
You mean we get to
pick out the color

139
00:07:39,744 --> 00:07:41,577
of eyes
she'll have?

140
00:07:41,612 --> 00:07:42,829
And how tall?

141
00:07:42,864 --> 00:07:44,330
Exactly.

142
00:07:44,365 --> 00:07:46,833
You will pick them out...

143
00:07:48,084 --> 00:07:49,969
and put them down this chute

144
00:07:50,004 --> 00:07:53,089
where they will be conveyed
to our factory.

145
00:07:53,124 --> 00:07:56,092
I think she should
have blue eyes.

146
00:07:56,127 --> 00:07:56,726
These eyes here.

147
00:07:56,761 --> 00:07:58,594
No, these.

148
00:07:58,629 --> 00:08:00,096
They're like
the brown aggies

149
00:08:00,131 --> 00:08:01,347
i play marbles with.

150
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:06,352
Look! Those hands
are nice and plump.

151
00:08:06,387 --> 00:08:08,237
I want
thin fingers.

152
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,613
Hey, her voice.

153
00:08:17,648 --> 00:08:18,998
Listen.

154
00:08:19,033 --> 00:08:21,501
"I sing the body electric."

155
00:08:21,536 --> 00:08:23,870
From walt whitman's
poetry.

156
00:08:23,905 --> 00:08:25,755
Her voice
is too high.

157
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:30,626
"I celebrate myself
and sing myself."

158
00:08:30,661 --> 00:08:33,262
Again, walt whitman.

159
00:08:33,297 --> 00:08:34,514
Too low.

160
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:39,268
"The armies
of those i love engirth me,

161
00:08:39,303 --> 00:08:41,387
and i engirth them."

162
00:08:41,422 --> 00:08:42,638
That's just right.

163
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:43,890
That's it.

164
00:08:47,643 --> 00:08:50,146
Could you build her
like my mother?

165
00:08:50,181 --> 00:08:51,397
If you wish.

166
00:08:51,432 --> 00:08:52,899
Exactly like her?

167
00:08:52,934 --> 00:08:54,033
Yes.

168
00:08:54,068 --> 00:08:55,902
Then i don't
want her.

169
00:08:55,937 --> 00:08:59,655
I don't want her
to be like my mother.

170
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:00,289
I'd hate her.

171
00:09:00,324 --> 00:09:01,541
Anne, please.

172
00:09:01,576 --> 00:09:02,792
Excuse me.

173
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:08,414
Tom, you want her to look
like mother, don't you?

174
00:09:08,449 --> 00:09:09,665
Sure.

175
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,168
Then we don't care
what anne thinks.

176
00:09:12,203 --> 00:09:13,419
Nah, she's crazy.

177
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:19,675
I can win any game
of marbles with those,

178
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:22,812
and if she had eyes
like these... gosh.

179
00:09:22,847 --> 00:09:27,183
Oh, if she only had long hair.

180
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,123
Hey, aggies.

181
00:10:24,158 --> 00:10:26,626
Brown aggies.

182
00:10:26,661 --> 00:10:29,128
I can win any game
of marbles with those.

183
00:10:29,163 --> 00:10:33,499
You must be tom and karen

184
00:10:33,534 --> 00:10:35,751
and that's anne,
of course.

185
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:37,136
Who are you?

186
00:10:37,171 --> 00:10:39,005
Give me any name.

187
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,891
Melissa, lavinia, melvina...

188
00:10:41,926 --> 00:10:44,393
what would you like?

189
00:10:44,428 --> 00:10:46,145
Grandma.

190
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:50,516
Say it a few times.

191
00:10:50,551 --> 00:10:52,401
It'll sound fine.

192
00:10:52,436 --> 00:10:54,904
I know you're thinking
i'm not a robot,

193
00:10:54,939 --> 00:10:56,772
but i'll prove it.

194
00:10:58,274 --> 00:10:59,525
Here.

195
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,911
Wind me up.

196
00:11:01,946 --> 00:11:03,162
A key.

197
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:05,781
You don't wind

198
00:11:05,816 --> 00:11:07,033
robots up.

199
00:11:07,068 --> 00:11:09,535
They run
on electricity.

200
00:11:15,576 --> 00:11:19,795
But you do want proof
though, don't you?

201
00:11:22,298 --> 00:11:25,434
And if she had eyes
like these...

202
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:31,057
oh, if she only had long hair.

203
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,062
I see you
have a kite.

204
00:11:36,097 --> 00:11:37,947
Get it.

205
00:11:37,982 --> 00:11:41,067
But i'm all out of string.

206
00:11:41,102 --> 00:11:42,952
No, you're not.

207
00:11:42,987 --> 00:11:45,454
There.

208
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:54,830
It's flying!

209
00:11:54,865 --> 00:11:57,333
What did you say
my name was?

210
00:11:57,368 --> 00:11:58,584
Grandma!

211
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:04,724
Hey, anne,
look what grandma's done! Look!

212
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:05,975
How high shall
we fly it?

213
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:07,843
The moon.

214
00:12:07,878 --> 00:12:09,729
The moon it is.

215
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:16,352
Oh, grandma!

216
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,506
Dad! Dad!

217
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:30,009
Grandma, is that
a new car out front?

218
00:13:30,044 --> 00:13:31,260
Ask your father.

219
00:13:31,295 --> 00:13:33,145
Dad, is that our car?!

220
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:33,762
It sure is.

221
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:35,648
I came home early
to surprise you.

222
00:13:35,683 --> 00:13:37,516
Can we take a ride in it?

223
00:13:37,551 --> 00:13:38,767
Well, of course we can.

224
00:13:38,802 --> 00:13:40,653
Where's anne?
She wanted to stay
in this afternoon.

225
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,521
Oh. Well, you children
go on out and play

226
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:43,772
for a little while.

227
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,024
I'll be out in a few minutes.

228
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,526
Then we'll take a run
down to the soda fountain,

229
00:13:47,561 --> 00:13:48,777
how about that?

230
00:13:48,812 --> 00:13:50,663
Wonderful!
Come on, tom.

231
00:13:56,285 --> 00:13:59,421
I'm sorry about anne.

232
00:13:59,456 --> 00:14:00,673
You've been good to us,

233
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:02,541
and for us.

234
00:14:02,576 --> 00:14:04,426
Now, don't worry
about anne.

235
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,934
She'll accept me...
eventually.

236
00:14:11,969 --> 00:14:13,802
You see, mr. Rogers,

237
00:14:13,837 --> 00:14:18,140
children are the most
complicated things in the world.

238
00:14:18,175 --> 00:14:20,609
I could be the greatest
cook in the world,

239
00:14:20,644 --> 00:14:23,112
the finest,
most exciting playmate,

240
00:14:23,147 --> 00:14:25,614
the most incredibly
interesting companion,

241
00:14:25,649 --> 00:14:29,368
but those
are very tiny niches-

242
00:14:29,403 --> 00:14:33,122
a shelf in the stomach,
a very small ledge in the brain.

243
00:14:33,739 --> 00:14:36,242
It's the heart
i have to enter-

244
00:14:36,277 --> 00:14:37,493
the child's heart-

245
00:14:37,528 --> 00:14:40,629
and this is a deep place,
difficult to reach.

246
00:14:40,664 --> 00:14:45,000
But that too
will come.

247
00:14:51,006 --> 00:14:52,892
Anne, we're
going for a ride.

248
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,143
Will you come
with us?

249
00:14:54,178 --> 00:14:55,394
I want to stay home.

250
00:14:55,429 --> 00:14:57,263
I don't want
her here.

251
00:14:57,298 --> 00:14:59,265
Anne, you mustn't
say that.

252
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,766
I don't want her here!

253
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,269
Do i bother you,
anne?

254
00:15:03,304 --> 00:15:05,771
I never wanted
you here.

255
00:15:05,806 --> 00:15:09,525
It was them- father
and tom and karen.

256
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,027
They wanted you,
but i didn't.

257
00:15:12,062 --> 00:15:15,664
They needed you, but
i never needed you.

258
00:15:15,699 --> 00:15:16,665
Anne.

259
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,917
But it's true.

260
00:15:17,952 --> 00:15:19,168
You sit

261
00:15:19,203 --> 00:15:20,536
and you talk to her,

262
00:15:20,571 --> 00:15:23,038
and you eat the food
she makes,

263
00:15:23,073 --> 00:15:25,541
and you make believe,
father.

264
00:15:25,576 --> 00:15:26,792
That's what you do.

265
00:15:26,827 --> 00:15:28,043
You make believe

266
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:29,929
as if it
were a game.

267
00:15:29,964 --> 00:15:31,797
As if she were real.

268
00:15:31,832 --> 00:15:33,682
But she's not real.

269
00:15:33,717 --> 00:15:34,934
She's a machine.

270
00:15:34,969 --> 00:15:37,436
Nothing but an
old machine!

271
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:40,556
Anne. Anne,
you'd be surprised, my dear

272
00:15:40,591 --> 00:15:43,058
how much
a machine can do

273
00:15:43,093 --> 00:15:45,561
besides playing
and cooking.

274
00:15:45,596 --> 00:15:49,565
This machine, for example-
this machine can love.

275
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,700
Love? Love who?

276
00:15:51,735 --> 00:15:52,952
You, anne.

277
00:15:52,987 --> 00:15:55,454
I can love you,
and i do.

278
00:15:55,489 --> 00:15:57,573
I love you more than...

279
00:15:57,608 --> 00:16:00,075
more than tongue can tell.

280
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:01,961
You don't love me.

281
00:16:01,996 --> 00:16:03,212
You can't.

282
00:16:03,247 --> 00:16:05,464
She said
she loved me.

283
00:16:05,499 --> 00:16:06,081
She?

284
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:07,967
My mother.

285
00:16:08,002 --> 00:16:10,469
She said,
"i love you,"

286
00:16:10,504 --> 00:16:11,720
but she lied.

287
00:16:11,755 --> 00:16:12,972
She lied!

288
00:16:13,007 --> 00:16:14,840
And you're
like her.

289
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:17,977
I hate her,
and i hate you!

290
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,484
She's run away before.

291
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,353
I'll go after her.

292
00:16:27,388 --> 00:16:30,489
There's no place
for her to go.

293
00:16:31,106 --> 00:16:33,609
No place to go,
except to me.

294
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,522
Anne.

295
00:17:03,557 --> 00:17:05,391
Get away.

296
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,276
You're just old junk.

297
00:17:07,311 --> 00:17:09,778
Anne, why
do you hate me?

298
00:17:09,813 --> 00:17:12,281
Because you're like her.

299
00:17:12,316 --> 00:17:14,149
Your mother.

300
00:17:14,184 --> 00:17:15,901
I hate her!

301
00:17:15,936 --> 00:17:18,404
Why do you
hate her, anne?

302
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:19,655
Because.

303
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:20,906
Because?

304
00:17:20,941 --> 00:17:22,157
Because she lied.

305
00:17:22,192 --> 00:17:24,043
She said she loved me.

306
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:25,294
Didn't she?

307
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:27,162
She ran away.

308
00:17:27,197 --> 00:17:28,797
Ran away?

309
00:17:28,832 --> 00:17:31,300
She left me!

310
00:17:31,335 --> 00:17:33,802
You mean... she died.

311
00:17:33,837 --> 00:17:35,054
No!

312
00:17:35,089 --> 00:17:37,556
You mean she died.

313
00:17:38,173 --> 00:17:39,425
Yes.

314
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,178
But she let herself die.

315
00:17:43,213 --> 00:17:45,681
She shouldn't have
done that to me!

316
00:17:45,716 --> 00:17:46,932
She shouldn't!

317
00:17:46,967 --> 00:17:48,183
She left me!

318
00:17:48,218 --> 00:17:49,435
She left me.

319
00:17:57,943 --> 00:17:59,194
Anne!

320
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,961
Anne, darling,
don't cry, don't cry.

321
00:18:15,996 --> 00:18:18,464
Take it easy,
take it easy.

322
00:18:37,232 --> 00:18:40,119
Anne. Anne, look!

323
00:18:40,154 --> 00:18:41,370
Look, she's...

324
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,253
you're just old junk.

325
00:18:58,288 --> 00:19:00,005
Old junk!

326
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:06,261
Get away. Get away.

327
00:19:06,296 --> 00:19:10,516
Old junk.

328
00:19:10,551 --> 00:19:13,018
That's my voice.

329
00:19:13,053 --> 00:19:15,904
Your voice, anne.

330
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:24,163
Grandma.
Grandma, you're alive!

331
00:19:24,198 --> 00:19:26,031
Alive.

332
00:19:27,282 --> 00:19:28,534
But the car.

333
00:19:28,569 --> 00:19:31,036
Nothing
can hurt me.

334
00:19:31,071 --> 00:19:34,173
Then you're not
like mother?

335
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:36,041
In this way, no.

336
00:19:36,076 --> 00:19:37,926
You can't run away?

337
00:19:37,961 --> 00:19:39,795
I can't. I won't.

338
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:41,680
You'll never die?

339
00:19:41,715 --> 00:19:42,931
Never.

340
00:19:42,966 --> 00:19:44,800
Oh, grandma.

341
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:47,936
Your mother died too

342
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:50,439
when you were young.

343
00:19:50,474 --> 00:19:52,307
How did you know that?

344
00:19:52,342 --> 00:19:56,061
Did you ever forgive her
for running away like that

345
00:19:56,096 --> 00:19:57,312
and never coming back?

346
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,066
No, i never did.

347
00:20:01,101 --> 00:20:02,951
Anne...

348
00:20:02,986 --> 00:20:04,703
now, she'll
be all right.

349
00:20:04,738 --> 00:20:05,954
She had nowhere to turn.

350
00:20:05,989 --> 00:20:09,708
She was afraid that aunt nedra
and everybody would run away

351
00:20:09,743 --> 00:20:11,577
and leave her alone.

352
00:20:11,612 --> 00:20:13,462
Everyone except you.

353
00:20:13,497 --> 00:20:16,582
To live forever.

354
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:20,836
Now, let us
all go home

355
00:20:20,871 --> 00:20:23,088
and finish
our lunch.

356
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:31,480
Last one home
is an old maid.

357
00:20:31,515 --> 00:20:33,348
An old maid?

358
00:20:34,635 --> 00:20:37,102
Hey, dad, are we going
to be old maids?

359
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,605
Not on your tintype.

360
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,490
As of this moment,

361
00:20:41,525 --> 00:20:43,358
the wonderful
electric grandmother

362
00:20:43,393 --> 00:20:45,244
moved into the lives
of children and father.

363
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:47,112
She became integral
and important.

364
00:20:47,147 --> 00:20:47,746
She became the essence.

365
00:20:47,781 --> 00:20:48,997
As of this moment,

366
00:20:49,032 --> 00:20:50,866
they would never see lightning,

367
00:20:50,901 --> 00:20:54,002
never hear poetry read,
never listen to foreign tongues

368
00:20:54,037 --> 00:20:55,254
without thinking of her.

369
00:20:55,871 --> 00:20:58,373
Everything they would
ever see, hear, taste, feel

370
00:20:58,408 --> 00:21:00,259
would remind them of her.

371
00:21:00,294 --> 00:21:01,510
She was all life,

372
00:21:01,545 --> 00:21:04,630
and all life was wondrous,
quick, electrical-

373
00:21:04,665 --> 00:21:05,881
like grandma.

374
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:07,132
Thank you, tom.

375
00:21:13,388 --> 00:21:15,891
We're going to miss you,
grandma.

376
00:21:15,926 --> 00:21:17,142
And i you.

377
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:22,781
More than tongue can tell.

378
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:24,032
Why do you have
to leave?

379
00:21:24,067 --> 00:21:25,901
You're going off
to college now,

380
00:21:25,936 --> 00:21:27,152
and you won't need me.

381
00:21:27,187 --> 00:21:29,037
That's the way
it should be.

382
00:21:29,072 --> 00:21:30,289
I'm not the world.

383
00:21:30,324 --> 00:21:32,791
The world's out there,
and it needs you.

384
00:21:32,826 --> 00:21:35,294
What's going to happen
to you now, grandma?

385
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:37,796
I'll go back to...

386
00:21:37,831 --> 00:21:41,550
facsimile limited,
"i sing the body electric",

387
00:21:41,585 --> 00:21:45,921
and be sent out to help raise
another family like yourselves

388
00:21:45,956 --> 00:21:49,675
or perhaps... i'll be
taken apart, redistributed.

389
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,560
They won't
destroy you?

390
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:55,314
Oh, no, darling.

391
00:21:55,349 --> 00:21:57,816
My mind... my soul,

392
00:21:57,851 --> 00:22:00,819
you might say,
will go for a while

393
00:22:00,854 --> 00:22:02,688
into a room
of voices.

394
00:22:02,723 --> 00:22:03,939
A room of voices?

395
00:22:03,974 --> 00:22:08,327
A great, dim room
where the minds and souls

396
00:22:08,362 --> 00:22:10,195
of all the other
mechanical grandmothers

397
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:13,332
are brought and stored
for a month or a year.

398
00:22:13,367 --> 00:22:15,834
And in that room,
we'll talk to each other,

399
00:22:15,869 --> 00:22:17,703
and we'll tell
what we learned from the world

400
00:22:17,738 --> 00:22:20,205
and from the families
we lived with.

401
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,959
And i'll tell
what i learned from anne...

402
00:22:23,994 --> 00:22:28,347
and karen... and tom.

403
00:22:28,964 --> 00:22:30,849
But you taught us.

404
00:22:30,884 --> 00:22:33,719
Do you really think
i learned nothing

405
00:22:33,754 --> 00:22:36,221
from you in return?

406
00:22:36,256 --> 00:22:38,106
No.

407
00:22:38,141 --> 00:22:39,975
Everything you ever said
or did,

408
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:42,477
everything you ever laughed
or cried about,

409
00:22:42,512 --> 00:22:44,980
i'll share
with the other machines

410
00:22:45,015 --> 00:22:48,116
in the room of voices,
and someday...

411
00:22:48,151 --> 00:22:49,985
someday what, grandma?

412
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,987
For a reasonable
creature,

413
00:22:52,022 --> 00:22:53,872
i have
an unreasonable dream.

414
00:22:53,907 --> 00:22:58,243
Someday, after 300 years,

415
00:22:58,278 --> 00:23:01,380
if i'm very wise
and very good,

416
00:23:01,415 --> 00:23:06,385
perhaps i'll gain
life.

417
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:08,253
Oh, grandma,
you don't have to wait.

418
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:11,390
You've always been
alive to us.

419
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:16,395
I'll get it, grandma.

420
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:17,646
No, no, no, now.

421
00:23:17,681 --> 00:23:20,148
Do me a favor,
would you?

422
00:23:20,183 --> 00:23:21,400
Go on upstairs.

423
00:23:21,435 --> 00:23:24,519
I've never been
one for good-byes.

424
00:23:24,554 --> 00:23:27,656
I'm a silly,
sentimental,
old grandmother,

425
00:23:27,691 --> 00:23:30,776
but i want to take
with me the past.

426
00:23:30,811 --> 00:23:32,661
Now, go ahead.
Quickly.

427
00:23:32,696 --> 00:23:34,529
But, grandma...
darling, go on.

428
00:23:34,564 --> 00:23:35,781
That's fine.

429
00:23:35,816 --> 00:23:37,032
Quickly. There.

430
00:23:37,067 --> 00:23:38,283
Run on.

431
00:23:38,318 --> 00:23:40,786
Go on.

432
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,298
A fable? Most assuredly.

433
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:55,801
But who's to say
at some distant moment,

434
00:23:55,836 --> 00:23:58,937
there might be an assembly line
producing a gentle product

435
00:23:58,972 --> 00:24:03,308
in the form of a grandmother,
whose stock in trade is love.

436
00:24:03,343 --> 00:24:05,193
Fable? Sure.

437
00:24:05,228 --> 00:24:07,062
But who's to say?

438
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:15,070
Rod serling,
creator ofthe twilight zone,

439
00:24:15,105 --> 00:24:17,572
will tell you
about next week's story

440
00:24:17,607 --> 00:24:18,824
after this message.

441
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:21,660
And now, mr. Serling.

442
00:24:21,695 --> 00:24:25,413
Next week onthe twilight zone,
two incredibly talented people

443
00:24:25,448 --> 00:24:27,916
join forces to show us
what happens

444
00:24:27,951 --> 00:24:30,418
when an accident-prone,
discombobulated lady

445
00:24:30,453 --> 00:24:32,921
with six thumbs
and two left feet

446
00:24:32,956 --> 00:24:34,172
meets a hapless guardian angel

447
00:24:34,207 --> 00:24:37,309
who knows more about martinis
than miracles.

448
00:24:37,344 --> 00:24:39,177
Miss carol burnett
and mr. Jesse white.

449
00:24:39,212 --> 00:24:42,314
They're the chief ingredients
to a very funny stew.

450
00:24:42,349 --> 00:24:44,816
Next week, "cavender is coming."

451
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:21,052
For america to flower
spiritually and intellectually,

452
00:25:21,087 --> 00:25:23,555
we need more
and better college facilities.

453
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:26,057
Help the college
of your choice.
