1
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,678
You're traveling
through another dimension

2
00:00:12,295 --> 00:00:14,798
a dimension not only
of sight and sound, but of mind

3
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:16,683
a journey into a wondrous land

4
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,185
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

5
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,054
That's the signpost up ahead.

6
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:23,556
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

7
00:00:34,818 --> 00:00:39,205
A brief if frenetic introduction
to mr. Archibald beechcroft

8
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,074
a child of the 20th century

9
00:00:41,109 --> 00:00:43,576
a product of
the population explosion

10
00:00:43,611 --> 00:00:47,330
and one of the inheritors
of the legacy of progress.

11
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,471
Mr. Beechcroft again.

12
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:58,224
This time act ii of his
daily battle for survival.

13
00:00:58,259 --> 00:00:59,476
And in just a moment

14
00:00:59,511 --> 00:01:02,595
our hero will begin his
personal one-man rebellion

15
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:05,098
against the mechanics of his age

16
00:01:05,133 --> 00:01:07,600
and to do so
he will enlist certain aids

17
00:01:07,635 --> 00:01:10,103
available only
in the twilight zone.

18
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:31,091
Why, you clumsy clod!

19
00:01:31,126 --> 00:01:32,959
Oh, i'm sorry,
mr. Beechcroft.

20
00:01:32,994 --> 00:01:35,462
I didn't notice
where i was going.

21
00:01:35,497 --> 00:01:37,964
That's precisely
your problem.

22
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:16,136
Feeling ill,
beechcroft?

23
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:21,141
If you'll forgive a
personal observation

24
00:02:21,758 --> 00:02:23,009
you're not
looking too well.

25
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:24,894
I'm all right,
mr. Rogers.

26
00:02:24,929 --> 00:02:26,146
Keeping yourself fit

27
00:02:26,181 --> 00:02:28,648
is not only a
personal obligation.

28
00:02:28,683 --> 00:02:29,899
Oh, no, in a larger sense

29
00:02:29,934 --> 00:02:31,768
it's part of
your responsibility

30
00:02:31,803 --> 00:02:33,019
to your job

31
00:02:33,054 --> 00:02:34,904
and to the firm
that employs you.

32
00:02:34,939 --> 00:02:37,407
I'm not unaware
of that, mr. Rogers.

33
00:02:37,442 --> 00:02:38,658
Well, then why don't you

34
00:02:38,693 --> 00:02:39,909
pull yourself
together, man?

35
00:02:39,944 --> 00:02:41,778
Get some sleep at night.

36
00:02:41,813 --> 00:02:44,914
Eat regular meals, lots of milk
and fresh vegetables.

37
00:02:44,949 --> 00:02:47,417
Greens! Oh, you can't beat
those greens for vitamins.

38
00:02:47,452 --> 00:02:49,919
I'm a spinach and
lettuce man myself.

39
00:02:49,954 --> 00:02:51,788
I even have them
for breakfast.

40
00:02:51,823 --> 00:02:54,924
Well, if people wouldn't
look at me a little tilt.

41
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,044
But the power's in
the greens, beechcroft.

42
00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:00,547
The power's definitely
in the greens.

43
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,934
You're not drinking,
are you, beechcroft?

44
00:03:04,969 --> 00:03:07,437
I don't drink,
mr. Rogers.

45
00:03:07,472 --> 00:03:09,305
Well, then,
you don't drink

46
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,808
and you don't stay
out late at night...

47
00:03:11,843 --> 00:03:13,693
are you watching
your diet?

48
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:17,447
If you'd really like
to know, mr. Rogers

49
00:03:17,482 --> 00:03:19,949
if you'd really like
to know precisely

50
00:03:19,984 --> 00:03:21,818
why i am so dead tired

51
00:03:21,853 --> 00:03:24,954
you ought to try coming
to work on the subway

52
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:26,823
at 7:30 every morning

53
00:03:26,858 --> 00:03:29,325
then jamming
into an elevator

54
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,211
like part of
a herd of cattle

55
00:03:31,246 --> 00:03:33,079
then working in that...

56
00:03:33,114 --> 00:03:37,467
in that cacophonous din
that you call an office.

57
00:03:37,502 --> 00:03:41,221
Always get jostled,
always get shoved

58
00:03:41,256 --> 00:03:43,723
always get
pushed around.

59
00:03:43,758 --> 00:03:45,592
Take hold of yourself, beechcroft.

60
00:03:45,627 --> 00:03:48,094
For goodness sakes,
man, take hold.

61
00:03:48,129 --> 00:03:49,345
I'll take hold,
mr. Rogers.

62
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,597
I'll take hold

63
00:03:50,632 --> 00:03:53,099
when i can achieve
that millennium

64
00:03:53,134 --> 00:03:56,236
that absolute perfection
that comes with solitude.

65
00:03:56,271 --> 00:03:57,487
You read me, mr. Rogers?

66
00:03:57,522 --> 00:03:58,738
People.

67
00:03:58,773 --> 00:03:59,989
People, people!

68
00:04:00,024 --> 00:04:01,858
If i had my way

69
00:04:01,893 --> 00:04:04,360
here's how i'd
fix the universe.

70
00:04:04,395 --> 00:04:06,246
I'd eliminate the people.

71
00:04:06,281 --> 00:04:08,114
I mean, cross them off

72
00:04:08,149 --> 00:04:11,868
get rid of them, destroy
them, decimate them

73
00:04:11,903 --> 00:04:14,370
and there'd only be
one man left-

74
00:04:14,405 --> 00:04:17,507
me, archibald
beechcroft, esquire.

75
00:04:17,542 --> 00:04:20,627
Why, you are quite mad,
beechcroft.

76
00:04:20,662 --> 00:04:21,878
Do you know that?

77
00:04:21,913 --> 00:04:24,130
People!

78
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,522
Mr. Beechcroft.

79
00:04:32,557 --> 00:04:33,773
Mr. Beechcroft!

80
00:04:33,808 --> 00:04:36,276
Here's a place
for you, sir.

81
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:46,903
I've been saving it.

82
00:04:46,938 --> 00:04:48,154
I am obliged, henry.

83
00:04:48,189 --> 00:04:49,405
Oh, think
nothing of it.

84
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,657
I was...

85
00:04:50,692 --> 00:04:52,542
well, i was just
trying to make up

86
00:04:52,577 --> 00:04:53,793
for this morning.

87
00:04:53,828 --> 00:04:55,044
This morning?

88
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:56,913
When i spilled
coffee on your coat.

89
00:04:56,948 --> 00:04:58,798
I'm really very sorry

90
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:00,049
about that,
mr. Beechcroft.

91
00:05:00,084 --> 00:05:01,301
Oh, it's all right.

92
00:05:01,336 --> 00:05:03,803
A friend of mine
works in a bookstore

93
00:05:03,838 --> 00:05:05,054
around the corner.

94
00:05:05,089 --> 00:05:05,672
I went there

95
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,174
first part
of the lunch break.

96
00:05:09,425 --> 00:05:10,927
I got you this.

97
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,434
The mind and the matter:

98
00:05:18,469 --> 00:05:20,320
How you can achieve

99
00:05:20,355 --> 00:05:22,822
the ultimate power
of concentration.

100
00:05:22,857 --> 00:05:25,325
A little on
the occult side

101
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,576
isn't that, henry?

102
00:05:26,611 --> 00:05:28,444
Maybe so,
mr. Beechcroft

103
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,330
but this friend
of mine is...

104
00:05:30,365 --> 00:05:32,832
well, you might say
he's a student of the mind.

105
00:05:32,867 --> 00:05:34,083
Mm-hmm.

106
00:05:34,118 --> 00:05:35,952
Oh, he swears by that book.

107
00:05:35,987 --> 00:05:38,454
He says, to the best
of his knowledge

108
00:05:38,489 --> 00:05:40,340
it's the only one in existence.

109
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:42,842
Would you believe it,
mr. Beechcroft

110
00:05:42,877 --> 00:05:45,962
i've seen my friend
cause a woman

111
00:05:45,997 --> 00:05:49,716
to purchase a chartreuse
and orange scarf.

112
00:05:49,751 --> 00:05:50,967
How's that?

113
00:05:51,002 --> 00:05:52,218
That's right.

114
00:05:52,253 --> 00:05:54,103
We were in
a department store

115
00:05:54,138 --> 00:05:55,972
and he saw some
woman picking over

116
00:05:56,007 --> 00:05:59,108
a table full of scarves
that were on sale.

117
00:05:59,143 --> 00:06:01,477
And he concentrated
real hard

118
00:06:01,512 --> 00:06:03,980
on the chartreuse
and orange one...

119
00:06:04,015 --> 00:06:05,865
and as sure
as i'm sitting here

120
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,619
in the cafeteria of the park
central insurance company

121
00:06:09,654 --> 00:06:10,870
that woman picked up

122
00:06:10,905 --> 00:06:12,739
the chartreuse
and orange scarf.

123
00:06:12,774 --> 00:06:15,124
Why it's the absolute,
unvarnished truth.

124
00:06:16,411 --> 00:06:20,129
Oh, mr. Beechcroft,
i'm so sorry.

125
00:06:20,164 --> 00:06:21,381
Oh, i...

126
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:28,254
i thank you so much
for the book, henry.

127
00:06:28,289 --> 00:06:30,139
I... i am indebted.

128
00:06:30,174 --> 00:06:32,642
Well... there.

129
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:37,647
Uh, mr. Beechcroft,
chapter three-

130
00:06:37,682 --> 00:06:40,767
that's the one on
initial phenomena

131
00:06:40,802 --> 00:06:42,652
of intense
concentration.

132
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,903
Chapter three.

133
00:06:43,938 --> 00:06:47,023
Chapter three,
right, chapter three.

134
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,707
They're right.

135
00:07:39,575 --> 00:07:42,712
They're absolutely,
unequivocally right.

136
00:07:42,747 --> 00:07:47,717
Concentration is the most
underrated, unknown power

137
00:07:47,752 --> 00:07:48,968
in the universe.

138
00:07:49,003 --> 00:07:52,088
Why, a person could...

139
00:07:52,123 --> 00:07:55,842
a person could move mountains.

140
00:07:58,344 --> 00:07:59,595
There's really no limit

141
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:03,349
to what a man could do
using the power properly.

142
00:08:03,384 --> 00:08:04,600
No limit at all.

143
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:14,110
People.

144
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:24,754
If i could just concentrate
hard enough to get rid of them.

145
00:08:31,627 --> 00:08:36,632
Concentration,
that's what it takes.

146
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:44,140
Concentrate on getting
rid of the people.

147
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,643
Mr. Beechcroft!

148
00:08:47,678 --> 00:08:50,780
Your rent is due,
mr. Beechcroft.

149
00:08:52,066 --> 00:08:53,282
Mr. Beechcroft!

150
00:08:53,317 --> 00:08:55,034
Rent's due.

151
00:08:55,069 --> 00:08:57,537
Mr. Beechcroft!

152
00:08:57,572 --> 00:09:00,790
Go away, disappear
be extinct!

153
00:09:00,825 --> 00:09:02,041
Mr. Beechcroft!

154
00:09:02,076 --> 00:09:05,161
Go away, be extinct,
disappear.

155
00:09:56,712 --> 00:09:58,598
Concentration.

156
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,717
Mind over matter.

157
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:09,225
Today the landlady,
tomorrow the world.

158
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,728
All right, let's get going.

159
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:05,317
That'll be just
about enough of that.

160
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:33,596
? for love...?

161
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:43,606
? for love...?

162
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,877
All well and good.

163
00:14:04,912 --> 00:14:08,013
All well and good,
to be sure.

164
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,384
But what's to do.

165
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:16,138
How does one occupy his time?

166
00:14:16,173 --> 00:14:18,641
Too much of a good thing?

167
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:27,650
Well, i wouldn't, uh,
i wouldn't say that.

168
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,152
But you're thinking it.

169
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:44,416
Bored to death,
aren't you?

170
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:50,055
Well, uh, let's
just say that, um...

171
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:53,175
let's just say
that i am temporarily

172
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:56,929
somewhat accessible
to suggestions as to, uh...

173
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,431
how to occupy
my time.

174
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:00,683
So?

175
00:15:00,718 --> 00:15:01,934
Let's face it.

176
00:15:01,969 --> 00:15:03,819
You are bored to tears.

177
00:15:03,854 --> 00:15:07,573
Solitude is one thing
but loneliness...

178
00:15:07,608 --> 00:15:09,441
loneliness
is quite another.

179
00:15:09,476 --> 00:15:11,327
Loneliness nothing.

180
00:15:11,362 --> 00:15:12,578
I despise people.

181
00:15:12,613 --> 00:15:13,829
I loathe them.

182
00:15:13,864 --> 00:15:18,200
And i, archibald beechcroft,
have done away with them

183
00:15:18,235 --> 00:15:20,703
for good and all, mind you?

184
00:15:20,738 --> 00:15:23,455
For good and all.

185
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:34,967
Thought about
any alternatives?

186
00:15:36,218 --> 00:15:38,103
Alternatives
to what?

187
00:15:38,138 --> 00:15:39,972
Alternatives
to this.

188
00:15:40,007 --> 00:15:41,223
You're bored.

189
00:15:41,258 --> 00:15:43,108
You don't
have idea one

190
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:44,977
how to occupy
your time.

191
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,479
People are
bad enough

192
00:15:47,514 --> 00:15:49,982
but inactivity
is even worse.

193
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:59,375
How about it?

194
00:16:00,242 --> 00:16:03,996
Oh, don't talk nonsense, please.

195
00:16:04,031 --> 00:16:06,498
I'm content.

196
00:16:06,533 --> 00:16:10,886
I am honestly and truly content
for the first time in my life.

197
00:16:10,921 --> 00:16:14,006
I've rid myself of
the worst scourge there is:

198
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:15,758
The populace.

199
00:16:15,793 --> 00:16:16,392
Well...

200
00:16:16,427 --> 00:16:17,643
what about
the thing

201
00:16:17,678 --> 00:16:19,511
that's going
to happen to you

202
00:16:19,546 --> 00:16:20,763
in the after...

203
00:16:20,798 --> 00:16:22,014
shut up.

204
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:38,414
Although,
if the truth be known...

205
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:44,670
i would like a little
diversion of some kind

206
00:16:44,705 --> 00:16:46,538
any sort of diversion...

207
00:16:46,573 --> 00:16:47,790
like, um...

208
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:54,046
like, um, an earthquake.

209
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:04,690
Uh, for goodness sakes,
no, no, no, not that!

210
00:17:12,815 --> 00:17:16,568
How about a nice little
electrical storm?

211
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,712
Forget it!

212
00:17:31,752 --> 00:17:34,837
I believe i've had it
for the day.

213
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:01,056
It's preying on
you now, isn't it?

214
00:19:01,091 --> 00:19:03,559
I mean, the quiet,
the emptiness.

215
00:19:03,594 --> 00:19:06,061
Well, the thing
of it is...

216
00:19:06,096 --> 00:19:07,312
it's just that

217
00:19:07,347 --> 00:19:10,432
while i don't care
much for people

218
00:19:10,467 --> 00:19:13,569
it's difficult
not having anyone.

219
00:19:13,604 --> 00:19:15,437
Why not get someone?

220
00:19:15,472 --> 00:19:18,574
That's the point,
someone is everyone.

221
00:19:18,609 --> 00:19:20,442
And i can't
stand everyone

222
00:19:20,477 --> 00:19:22,945
or anyone
for that matter.

223
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,830
There frankly
isn't a breed

224
00:19:24,865 --> 00:19:26,698
or a specie
of human being

225
00:19:26,733 --> 00:19:28,584
that i can stomach.

226
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:34,206
Ever thought of
a cocker spaniel?

227
00:19:34,241 --> 00:19:35,457
Well...

228
00:19:35,492 --> 00:19:37,960
i never cared much
for animals either.

229
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,713
Of course, of course!

230
00:19:41,748 --> 00:19:44,850
Why didn't i think
of it before?

231
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:47,970
Think of what?

232
00:19:48,005 --> 00:19:49,221
People!

233
00:19:49,256 --> 00:19:51,723
People who i can stand.

234
00:19:51,758 --> 00:19:52,975
People like...

235
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:54,860
people like myself.

236
00:19:54,895 --> 00:19:56,728
That's what i'll do.

237
00:19:56,763 --> 00:20:00,482
I'll create people,
but they'll be like me.

238
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:04,236
A world full of archibald beechcrofts.

239
00:20:04,271 --> 00:20:06,121
Now, that's
a thought.

240
00:20:06,156 --> 00:20:08,624
You bet your life
it's a thought.

241
00:20:08,659 --> 00:20:10,492
You bet your sweet life.

242
00:20:10,527 --> 00:20:11,743
That's what i'll do.

243
00:20:11,778 --> 00:20:12,995
I'll will it.

244
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:15,497
I'll concentrate
and i'll will

245
00:20:15,532 --> 00:20:16,748
that from now on

246
00:20:16,783 --> 00:20:18,634
everyone i see
will be like me.

247
00:20:18,669 --> 00:20:20,502
It's really quite simple.

248
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,411
People.

249
00:20:46,446 --> 00:20:48,280
It's not enough
they're just a mob.

250
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,165
They're a
dishonest mob.

251
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,785
Kindly deposit ten cents please
or shall i call the police.

252
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,182
Will you please
get off my foot

253
00:21:07,217 --> 00:21:08,433
you ugly little man.

254
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:14,189
12th floor,
everybody out, please.

255
00:21:16,058 --> 00:21:17,309
Sardines!

256
00:21:30,572 --> 00:21:33,709
The noise, the miserable noise.

257
00:21:33,744 --> 00:21:35,577
I'll go out of my mind.

258
00:21:35,612 --> 00:21:39,331
I'll go out
of my ever-loving mind.

259
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:44,336
A sty, that's what it is.

260
00:21:44,371 --> 00:21:45,837
Nothing
but people

261
00:21:45,872 --> 00:21:47,723
and people
are pigs.

262
00:21:50,592 --> 00:21:54,346
People, people, people, people.

263
00:21:54,381 --> 00:21:56,231
Is there no respite?

264
00:21:56,266 --> 00:21:58,100
Is there no relief?

265
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:08,744
Herds, droves,
hosts and bevies of people.

266
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:12,497
Will you people stop
muttering back there?

267
00:22:12,532 --> 00:22:14,366
I'm trying to work.

268
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:29,631
Had it?

269
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:30,882
Undeniably.

270
00:22:30,917 --> 00:22:34,019
Coming through
to you, huh?

271
00:22:34,054 --> 00:22:35,887
Without a doubt.

272
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:40,892
A lot of me
is just as bad

273
00:22:40,927 --> 00:22:42,144
as a lot of them.

274
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:45,897
So... what's to do now?

275
00:22:45,932 --> 00:22:47,783
I'll just
put it back

276
00:22:47,818 --> 00:22:49,651
the way it was.

277
00:22:49,686 --> 00:22:51,536
Just the way
it was.

278
00:23:07,954 --> 00:23:08,553
Oh!

279
00:23:09,171 --> 00:23:11,673
Oh, mr. Beechcroft,
sir, forgive me...

280
00:23:11,708 --> 00:23:15,427
uh, nothing
serious, henry.

281
00:23:15,462 --> 00:23:18,563
Just, uh, forget it.

282
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:29,825
Yes?

283
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,693
I was wondering...

284
00:23:31,728 --> 00:23:33,578
that book
i gave you.

285
00:23:33,613 --> 00:23:36,081
Did you get anything out of it?

286
00:23:36,116 --> 00:23:38,583
Well, uh...

287
00:23:38,618 --> 00:23:41,703
not really,
henry, i, uh...

288
00:23:41,738 --> 00:23:45,457
frankly, i thought
it was a lot of pap.

289
00:23:45,492 --> 00:23:49,211
It was interesting,
but totally unbelievable.

290
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:53,598
Mr. Archibald beechcroft,
a child of the 20th century

291
00:23:53,633 --> 00:23:56,718
who has found out
through trial and error-

292
00:23:56,753 --> 00:23:57,969
and mostly error-

293
00:23:58,004 --> 00:24:00,472
that with all its faults
it may well be

294
00:24:00,507 --> 00:24:03,608
that this is the best
of all possible worlds.

295
00:24:03,643 --> 00:24:06,111
People notwithstanding,
it has much to offer.

296
00:24:06,728 --> 00:24:09,865
Tonight's case in point
in the twilight zone.

297
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:15,737
Rod serling, creator
ofthe twilight zone

298
00:24:15,772 --> 00:24:17,622
will tell you
about next week's story

299
00:24:17,657 --> 00:24:20,859
after this word
from our alternate sponsor.

300
00:24:20,894 --> 00:24:22,911
And now, mr. Serling.

301
00:24:22,946 --> 00:24:25,413
It's been said that singularly,
the most difficult feat

302
00:24:25,448 --> 00:24:27,916
of all mankind is to find
a needle in a haystack.

303
00:24:27,951 --> 00:24:29,801
Onthe twilight zonenext time,
we do it one better.

304
00:24:29,836 --> 00:24:32,921
We pose a problem of finding
a martian in a snow bank.

305
00:24:32,956 --> 00:24:35,423
It all adds up to a kind of
extraterrestrial who's who

306
00:24:35,458 --> 00:24:38,560
with a couple of laughs, and
more than a couple of tensions.

307
00:24:38,595 --> 00:24:39,811
We recommend this
to the space buffs

308
00:24:39,846 --> 00:24:41,680
and the jigsaw puzzle addicts.

309
00:24:41,715 --> 00:24:44,182
Next time onthe twilight zone,
our story is called

310
00:24:44,217 --> 00:24:46,067
"will the real martian
please stand up."
