1
00:00:06,606 --> 00:00:09,726
You unlock this door
with the key of imagination.

2
00:00:09,761 --> 00:00:12,228
Beyond it is another dimension-

3
00:00:12,263 --> 00:00:13,480
a dimension of sound...

4
00:00:14,766 --> 00:00:16,616
a dimension of sight...

5
00:00:16,651 --> 00:00:18,485
a dimension of mind.

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,621
You're moving into a land
of both shadow and substance,

7
00:00:21,656 --> 00:00:23,490
of things and ideas.

8
00:00:23,525 --> 00:00:26,626
You've just crossed over
into the twilight zone.

9
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:31,631
You think
about that now.

10
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:33,500
You cannot run
a business

11
00:00:33,535 --> 00:00:34,751
by standing still
in a rut.

12
00:00:34,786 --> 00:00:37,253
A business has
got to progress.

13
00:00:37,288 --> 00:00:39,756
You got to keep pushing
and punching and prodding

14
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:41,007
until it gets diversified.

15
00:00:41,042 --> 00:00:42,892
That's the word,
that's the key.

16
00:00:42,927 --> 00:00:44,144
Coffee time.

17
00:00:44,179 --> 00:00:46,012
A business must be diversified.

18
00:00:46,047 --> 00:00:47,263
I was just telling them, fred.

19
00:00:47,298 --> 00:00:49,766
You cannot run a business
by standing still in a rut.

20
00:00:49,801 --> 00:00:51,651
Just as variety
is the spice of life,

21
00:00:51,686 --> 00:00:54,154
diversification is the key
to success in business.

22
00:00:54,189 --> 00:00:55,522
Now, you think
about that now.

23
00:00:55,557 --> 00:00:56,773
Well, i got
coffee with cream,

24
00:00:56,808 --> 00:00:58,658
cream and sugar,
sugar by itself,

25
00:00:58,693 --> 00:01:00,527
cream by itself
and plain black,

26
00:01:00,562 --> 00:01:02,412
so i'm already
diversified.

27
00:01:02,447 --> 00:01:04,914
Now would you please
get out of the way, mcnulty?

28
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:06,166
Mcnulty.

29
00:01:06,201 --> 00:01:06,783
Mcnulty here.

30
00:01:06,818 --> 00:01:09,285
Mr. Cooper would like
to see you.

31
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,170
Hear that?
Did you hear that?

32
00:01:10,205 --> 00:01:12,038
Mr. Cooper would like
to see mcnulty.

33
00:01:12,073 --> 00:01:14,541
And do you know why mr. Cooper
would like to see mcnulty?

34
00:01:14,576 --> 00:01:15,792
Because i have
been feeding suggestions

35
00:01:15,827 --> 00:01:17,677
into that suggestion box
for 11 months now.

36
00:01:17,712 --> 00:01:18,928
Did i say
suggestions?

37
00:01:18,963 --> 00:01:20,180
Wrong word.

38
00:01:20,215 --> 00:01:21,431
Suggestions,
any clod can make.

39
00:01:21,466 --> 00:01:23,299
But dynamic blueprints
for the future,

40
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:24,551
only mcnulty can make.

41
00:01:24,586 --> 00:01:25,802
You think about that now.

42
00:01:26,436 --> 00:01:27,687
He's waiting, mcnulty.

43
00:01:27,722 --> 00:01:30,056
11 months of
suggestions

44
00:01:30,091 --> 00:01:31,941
about to pay off.

45
00:01:31,976 --> 00:01:33,810
Say, you wouldn't
be interested

46
00:01:33,845 --> 00:01:35,061
in having dinner,
would you?

47
00:01:35,096 --> 00:01:36,946
If i was
starving to death

48
00:01:36,981 --> 00:01:38,815
and you were the
last man on earth

49
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,700
and it meant
my survival,
i might be,

50
00:01:40,735 --> 00:01:41,951
but i'm not,
you're not,

51
00:01:41,986 --> 00:01:45,071
and it doesn't,
so drift, mcnulty.

52
00:01:45,106 --> 00:01:48,825
Submitted for your approval
or at least your analysis:

53
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,710
One patrick thomas mcnulty,

54
00:01:50,745 --> 00:01:53,830
who at age 41
is the biggest bore on earth.

55
00:01:53,865 --> 00:01:55,715
He holds a ten-year record

56
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,218
for the most meaningless words

57
00:01:58,253 --> 00:02:00,086
spewed out
during a coffee break.

58
00:02:00,121 --> 00:02:01,971
And it's very likely that,
as of this moment,

59
00:02:02,006 --> 00:02:05,091
he would have gone through life
in precisely this manner,

60
00:02:05,126 --> 00:02:06,976
a dull, argumentative bigmouth

61
00:02:07,011 --> 00:02:09,479
who sets back the art of
conversation a thousand years.

62
00:02:09,514 --> 00:02:11,347
I say he very likely would have,

63
00:02:11,382 --> 00:02:13,850
except for something
that will soon happen to him,

64
00:02:13,885 --> 00:02:17,604
something that will considerably
alter his existence... and ours.

65
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:18,855
Now, you think about that now,

66
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:23,860
because this is
the twilight zone.

67
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:45,431
Mr. Mcnulty, do you know
what i've been doing?

68
00:02:46,049 --> 00:02:46,683
Yes, sir, mr. Cooper,

69
00:02:46,718 --> 00:02:49,185
you've been going through
the suggestion box.

70
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,054
I knew you would.
I've been expecting it.

71
00:02:51,089 --> 00:02:52,939
It takes a special
kind of employer to realize

72
00:02:52,974 --> 00:02:54,807
that one of his men
has got it.

73
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:56,059
Obviously mcnulty
has got it.

74
00:02:56,094 --> 00:02:57,944
Truer words, mr. Mcnulty,
have probably

75
00:02:57,979 --> 00:02:59,195
never been spoken
here or elsewhere.

76
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:01,064
Thank you, sir.

77
00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:02,448
Yes, i've just gone
through the residue

78
00:03:03,066 --> 00:03:04,317
of the suggestion box

79
00:03:04,352 --> 00:03:06,202
covering the past
three-month period.

80
00:03:06,237 --> 00:03:08,454
And here is
one of your
suggestions

81
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:09,706
dated
march 13th.

82
00:03:09,741 --> 00:03:12,208
"Make hot dogs flat
so that they can

83
00:03:12,243 --> 00:03:14,711
fit easily into
a hamburger bun."

84
00:03:14,746 --> 00:03:15,962
How about that?

85
00:03:15,997 --> 00:03:17,830
You think
about that now.

86
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:19,082
"Make tin cans
square

87
00:03:19,117 --> 00:03:20,967
"so they can be
stacked together

88
00:03:21,002 --> 00:03:22,835
more easily in
garbage cans."

89
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:23,970
Isn't that a gas?

90
00:03:24,005 --> 00:03:27,590
"Put small pontoons
in soldiers' field packs

91
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:29,225
"so that when
they cross rivers

92
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,728
they can get across
by themselves."

93
00:03:31,763 --> 00:03:33,596
That one is worth
a million bucks.

94
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,099
The soldiers go
into the water...

95
00:03:36,134 --> 00:03:38,601
mr. Mcnulty, cooper
corporation makes

96
00:03:38,636 --> 00:03:40,486
ladies foundation
garments.

97
00:03:40,521 --> 00:03:43,740
It doesn't have anything to do
with hamburgers, hot dogs,

98
00:03:43,775 --> 00:03:46,109
tin cans or
national defense.

99
00:03:46,144 --> 00:03:49,112
And not one of
your 340 suggestions-

100
00:03:49,147 --> 00:03:53,499
i repeat, not one of them-
has anything remotely to do

101
00:03:53,534 --> 00:03:55,368
with this company's product.

102
00:03:55,403 --> 00:03:58,504
Exactly why i want
to talk to you, mr. Cooper.

103
00:03:58,539 --> 00:04:01,624
The key to a successful, modern
business is diversification.

104
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:03,509
You think about that now.

105
00:04:03,544 --> 00:04:06,129
I have thought about it-
you're fired!

106
00:04:10,633 --> 00:04:13,386
Baseball?
Baseball is nothing.

107
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:15,888
Soccer is the fastest
sport in the world.

108
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:17,140
In baseball,
they change sides,

109
00:04:17,175 --> 00:04:19,025
back and forth,
inning after inning.

110
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,893
The whole first period in
soccer, they run, run, run.

111
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:22,145
England, france, spain,
south america.

112
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,030
Soccer is the fastest sport
in the world.

113
00:04:24,065 --> 00:04:25,281
You think about that now.

114
00:04:25,316 --> 00:04:26,532
Hey, joe,
you know those swinging doors

115
00:04:26,567 --> 00:04:27,784
they got in western saloons-

116
00:04:27,819 --> 00:04:29,035
why don't you
put them in here

117
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,903
and then you can call this
palucci's western saloon.

118
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:32,155
How about that?

119
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,406
Yeah, how
about that?

120
00:04:33,441 --> 00:04:35,908
I'll have it done
in the morning.

121
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:39,045
Great! When i come in
i can think, "i did this."

122
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,296
How about that now?

123
00:04:40,331 --> 00:04:41,547
Please,
the ball game.

124
00:04:41,582 --> 00:04:43,416
Home-run hitters
mean nothing.

125
00:04:43,451 --> 00:04:44,667
Come on, fella.

126
00:04:44,702 --> 00:04:45,918
We're trying
to watch.

127
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:47,170
As to the average
long-ball hitter

128
00:04:47,205 --> 00:04:49,055
compared to a
consistent clutch hitter

129
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:49,672
with a good average,

130
00:04:49,707 --> 00:04:50,923
i'll take the latter
every time.

131
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,809
Well, that's
very nice of you.

132
00:04:52,844 --> 00:04:54,677
Well, it's a fact.
It's an absolute fact.

133
00:04:54,712 --> 00:04:56,562
Oh, boy, here
we go again.

134
00:04:56,597 --> 00:04:58,431
At no time has
a home-run hitter

135
00:04:58,466 --> 00:05:00,316
led the league
in batting.

136
00:05:00,351 --> 00:05:01,684
Yeah?

137
00:05:01,719 --> 00:05:03,569
Ted williams won
the batting championship

138
00:05:03,604 --> 00:05:06,689
and led the league in home runs
in 1941, '42 and '47.

139
00:05:06,724 --> 00:05:07,940
Exception
to the rule.

140
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:09,192
Think about that.

141
00:05:09,826 --> 00:05:10,576
The exception
to the rule.

142
00:05:10,611 --> 00:05:11,828
You know something.

143
00:05:11,863 --> 00:05:13,079
There's a ten-inch
television set

144
00:05:13,114 --> 00:05:15,581
in my sister's apartment,
kind that dates back to 1948.

145
00:05:15,616 --> 00:05:16,833
She's got five kids.

146
00:05:16,868 --> 00:05:18,701
The apartment's
a six-floor walkup,

147
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:21,204
and it's boiling hot.

148
00:05:21,239 --> 00:05:23,089
But i'll tell you-

149
00:05:23,124 --> 00:05:24,340
there's one thing that
apartment don't have

150
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:25,591
that makes it
all worthwhile.

151
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:29,345
It don't have mcnulty.

152
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,847
Charlie,
charlie, wait.
Forget it, joe.

153
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:32,715
Shut it off.
Blabbermouth-
i can't take it.

154
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,600
Ah, you think about.
Hear what i said?

155
00:05:34,635 --> 00:05:35,218
The exception to the rule.

156
00:05:35,253 --> 00:05:37,103
The exception
to the rule.

157
00:05:37,138 --> 00:05:38,971
Let me ask you
something, mcnulty.

158
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:40,857
How come you're
in here so early?

159
00:05:40,892 --> 00:05:43,359
You've been there for
three and a half hours.

160
00:05:43,394 --> 00:05:45,228
It so happens
i quit my job.

161
00:05:45,263 --> 00:05:47,113
I went into cooper's office
and i read him off.

162
00:05:47,148 --> 00:05:48,981
Don't tell me.

163
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:50,867
You got canned.

164
00:05:50,902 --> 00:05:52,735
Well, in a manner
of speaking.

165
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,620
You might say... yeah.

166
00:05:54,655 --> 00:05:56,489
We mutually agreed

167
00:05:56,524 --> 00:05:58,374
i wouldn't work
there anymore.

168
00:05:58,409 --> 00:05:59,625
Joe, tell me something.

169
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,494
Wouldn't you think
that after one year

170
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:03,996
of putting ideas
in that suggestion box,

171
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,882
after one whole year,
that i'd get noticed?

172
00:06:05,917 --> 00:06:07,750
Let me tell
you something.

173
00:06:07,785 --> 00:06:09,001
Getting noticed
and getting liked

174
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:10,887
are two different things.

175
00:06:10,922 --> 00:06:12,138
What do you know?

176
00:06:12,173 --> 00:06:13,389
Nothing, mcnulty.

177
00:06:13,424 --> 00:06:14,640
Not a thing.

178
00:06:14,675 --> 00:06:15,892
Good night, joe.

179
00:06:15,927 --> 00:06:17,143
Wait a minute.

180
00:06:17,178 --> 00:06:18,394
All i know is

181
00:06:18,429 --> 00:06:21,514
that every night of
every week of every month,

182
00:06:21,549 --> 00:06:22,765
except election day,
you come in here

183
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,268
drive everybody
out of their skull

184
00:06:25,303 --> 00:06:27,153
walking on
your lower lip.

185
00:06:27,188 --> 00:06:29,021
Now, you think
about that.

186
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:31,524
Will you think
about that?

187
00:06:38,414 --> 00:06:40,283
What do you say?

188
00:06:40,318 --> 00:06:42,168
I say...

189
00:06:42,203 --> 00:06:44,670
"54, 40 or fight."

190
00:06:44,705 --> 00:06:49,041
I also say "damn the torpedoes,
full speed ahead!"

191
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:50,927
And on occasion, i will say,

192
00:06:50,962 --> 00:06:54,046
"it takes a heap of living
to make a house a home."

193
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:55,932
Want another beer?

194
00:06:55,967 --> 00:06:57,183
Thank you very much.

195
00:06:57,218 --> 00:06:59,051
I would appreciate
another.

196
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:00,303
Two more beers,
bartender.

197
00:07:00,937 --> 00:07:03,556
Two beers, big deal.

198
00:07:03,591 --> 00:07:05,057
What's your name?

199
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:06,309
Potts.

200
00:07:06,344 --> 00:07:08,194
That's not
a bad name.

201
00:07:08,229 --> 00:07:09,445
I was born with it.

202
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,696
Seems to me there
was a third baseman

203
00:07:10,731 --> 00:07:12,565
who used to play for
the phillies named potts.

204
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,816
Lou potts? Phil potts?

205
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:15,701
It couldn't be botts?

206
00:07:15,736 --> 00:07:16,953
No, it's potts.

207
00:07:16,988 --> 00:07:18,204
Two beers.

208
00:07:18,239 --> 00:07:20,072
You paying
for this, mcnulty?

209
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:22,575
Because this guy just
gave me his last dime.

210
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:25,077
This guy is my
friend, mr. Botts.

211
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:26,329
Potts!

212
00:07:26,364 --> 00:07:27,580
And i'd appreciate

213
00:07:27,615 --> 00:07:29,465
a little respect
from you.

214
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,334
I bet you would.

215
00:07:31,369 --> 00:07:32,585
You getting
respect from me

216
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:35,087
is about as easy as
flagging down a cab

217
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:38,224
on 46th and broadway
at 8:00 on new year's eve...

218
00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:40,092
in the rain.

219
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:41,344
Never mind-
drink up, pal.

220
00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:43,229
What do you want
to talk about?

221
00:07:43,264 --> 00:07:45,097
Want to talk
about baseball?

222
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:46,983
It's the great american sport,

223
00:07:47,018 --> 00:07:50,736
and i am very happy abner
doubleday saw fit to invent it.

224
00:07:50,771 --> 00:07:51,988
Cheers!

225
00:07:52,023 --> 00:07:53,239
To health, friend.

226
00:07:53,274 --> 00:07:54,490
Down the hatch.

227
00:07:56,359 --> 00:07:58,244
And now to thank you
for your generosity,

228
00:07:58,861 --> 00:08:00,112
i have something
for you.

229
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:00,863
It's a gift.

230
00:08:01,497 --> 00:08:03,366
A small remembrance
of our friendship.

231
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,251
What is it?

232
00:08:05,286 --> 00:08:07,119
It's a stopwatch-
a old family heirloom.

233
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:08,371
What do you
do with it?

234
00:08:08,406 --> 00:08:09,622
I mean, it doesn't
keep time.

235
00:08:09,657 --> 00:08:11,507
It's just a stopwatch.

236
00:08:11,542 --> 00:08:12,875
That is a fact.

237
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,126
But it is yours.

238
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:15,378
You may have it.

239
00:08:15,413 --> 00:08:17,263
What'll i do
with it? Stopwatch.

240
00:08:17,298 --> 00:08:20,383
Well, someday you might
own a racehorse

241
00:08:20,418 --> 00:08:22,268
or you might want
to run the mile

242
00:08:22,303 --> 00:08:24,136
or launch an astronaut.

243
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:29,141
Well, good-bye, old pal.

244
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:30,393
Oh...

245
00:08:30,428 --> 00:08:33,529
e pluribus unum.

246
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:41,037
Toodle-oo,
beertender.

247
00:08:42,905 --> 00:08:44,156
Beertender...

248
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:46,042
nice clientele.

249
00:08:46,077 --> 00:08:47,910
Your friend.

250
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:49,795
I wouldn't listen
to my mother.

251
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,664
She wanted me
to be a doctor.

252
00:08:51,699 --> 00:08:52,915
No, i had to
be a wiseguy.

253
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:55,418
Had to run a beer
joint like this.

254
00:08:55,453 --> 00:08:57,303
Well, you live
and you learn.

255
00:08:57,338 --> 00:08:59,171
Done for the
night, mcnulty?

256
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:01,057
Everybody's gone,
you happy?

257
00:09:01,092 --> 00:09:02,308
You bored ten
people to death.

258
00:09:02,343 --> 00:09:03,559
You emptied my place

259
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:06,062
like it had
a smallpox sign out there.

260
00:09:06,097 --> 00:09:07,313
Do me a favor-

261
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:11,067
whenever you get the thirst,
go to some other bar.

262
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,689
I don't feel much
like going home.

263
00:09:16,724 --> 00:09:19,191
I've seen the movie
onthe late show.

264
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:22,328
I've even seen the movie
onthe late, late show.

265
00:09:22,363 --> 00:09:24,830
Sometimes i even wish
i was married.

266
00:09:24,865 --> 00:09:26,699
Do you ever get that feeling?

267
00:09:28,451 --> 00:09:29,952
Joe?

268
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:32,455
Joe.

269
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:34,340
Hey, why you
standing that way?

270
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:35,591
Hey, joe,
say something.

271
00:09:35,626 --> 00:09:37,460
You look like
you were frozen.

272
00:09:37,495 --> 00:09:39,345
I was telling you
i was bored

273
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,847
and this crazy gleep
gave me this watch

274
00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:42,965
and i pushed it.

275
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,216
Another
thing-

276
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:45,468
you make me
nervous.

277
00:09:45,503 --> 00:09:49,221
First, you bore people to death
and then you make me nervous.

278
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:51,107
I make you nervous?

279
00:09:51,142 --> 00:09:52,224
You know something?

280
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:54,727
You're the one guy
that makes me wish

281
00:09:54,762 --> 00:09:57,229
they never
repealed
prohibition.

282
00:10:06,989 --> 00:10:12,878
Something tells me
this is a very unusual watch.

283
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:15,748
And another thing,
mcnulty.

284
00:10:15,783 --> 00:10:16,999
Mcnulty?

285
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:18,250
I'm over here.

286
00:10:55,671 --> 00:10:57,540
That can't be.

287
00:11:00,042 --> 00:11:02,545
I had too much to drink.

288
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:05,047
I need some sleep.

289
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:08,184
It can't be.

290
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:27,630
It works.

291
00:12:27,665 --> 00:12:33,886
I push the button, i stop
the watch, and i stop the world.

292
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:26,939
Good morning, wage slaves.

293
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:28,824
Make way for a free man.

294
00:13:28,859 --> 00:13:30,693
Good morning, doll.

295
00:13:30,728 --> 00:13:33,829
Oh, what's the
suggestion this
time, mcnulty?

296
00:13:33,864 --> 00:13:36,582
If you don't have one,
i've got one for you.

297
00:13:36,617 --> 00:13:40,953
Why don't you jump off a bridge?

298
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:42,588
Honey doll,
i have a product

299
00:13:42,623 --> 00:13:45,708
that is going to put a dent
in your eyeballs.

300
00:13:45,743 --> 00:13:47,593
What would you say
to a stopwatch

301
00:13:47,628 --> 00:13:48,844
that, when somebody
pushes it,

302
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:50,713
everything stops
in midair, hmm?

303
00:13:50,748 --> 00:13:53,215
Why don't you run away
and get lost, mcnulty,

304
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,466
or get to the point.

305
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:55,718
I already have.

306
00:13:55,753 --> 00:13:57,469
Last night,
i'm in joe palucci's bar,

307
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:59,355
we're sitting around
talking about this and that,

308
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:01,223
when this funny gleep
gives me this stopwatch.

309
00:14:01,258 --> 00:14:03,108
Without thinking,
i push this button-

310
00:14:03,143 --> 00:14:04,360
this one right here-

311
00:14:04,395 --> 00:14:06,862
and everything stops dead.
Everything.

312
00:14:06,897 --> 00:14:08,113
Think about
that now.

313
00:14:08,148 --> 00:14:09,365
Palucci drops a glass,

314
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,233
the glass hits the floor,
but the glass stops.

315
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:13,118
Everything stops.

316
00:14:13,153 --> 00:14:14,987
Palucci stops,
trains, subways, goldfish.

317
00:14:15,022 --> 00:14:16,872
Everything stops.
Think about that now, hm?

318
00:14:16,907 --> 00:14:18,123
Goldfish, too, huh?

319
00:14:18,158 --> 00:14:20,626
That's the most
amazing thing i ever heard.

320
00:14:20,661 --> 00:14:22,494
Now, get out of here, will you?

321
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:24,129
Mm-mm. I came to see cooper.

322
00:14:24,164 --> 00:14:25,381
It is time to diversify.

323
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:27,249
Oh, now, just a minute.

324
00:14:27,284 --> 00:14:29,134
Mr. Cooper's in conference.

325
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:30,386
You're right-
he's in conference with mcnulty.

326
00:14:30,421 --> 00:14:31,637
Mr. Cooper,
i'm sorry, sir.

327
00:14:31,672 --> 00:14:32,888
I fired you, mcnulty.

328
00:14:32,923 --> 00:14:34,139
What are you
doing here?

329
00:14:34,174 --> 00:14:35,391
He barged right in.

330
00:14:35,426 --> 00:14:36,642
I couldn't do
anything about it.

331
00:14:36,677 --> 00:14:39,144
Well, he can
barge right out.

332
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:40,512
Listen, coop...
coop?!

333
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:43,015
You can't afford to fire me
this time because this time

334
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:44,900
i've got more than suggestions,
i've got the goods.

335
00:14:44,935 --> 00:14:46,151
You think
about this now.

336
00:14:46,186 --> 00:14:48,654
You figure out
how this stopwatch works,

337
00:14:48,689 --> 00:14:50,522
and you've got a million bucks.

338
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:53,025
Mcnulty, let me remind you-

339
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:56,161
we make ladies foundation
garments, nothing else.

340
00:14:56,779 --> 00:14:58,030
Now, do you hear me?

341
00:14:58,065 --> 00:14:59,281
Nothing else.

342
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:03,035
So i will give you 15 seconds
to leave this room.

343
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,920
Now, get out.

344
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:11,677
Hey, fred, cup of coffee
for the lady, i'm buying.

345
00:15:11,712 --> 00:15:13,545
I'll buy my
own coffee.

346
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,930
If you're not out
of this office

347
00:15:14,965 --> 00:15:17,433
in one minute, i'll
call the police.

348
00:15:17,468 --> 00:15:18,684
Is that so, honey baby?

349
00:15:18,719 --> 00:15:20,552
It'll take more
than the police.

350
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:22,438
You'll need the army
and the navy.

351
00:15:22,473 --> 00:15:23,689
How about that crumb?

352
00:15:23,724 --> 00:15:25,557
He didn't even
let me show him.

353
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:26,809
So what
am i waiting for?

354
00:15:26,844 --> 00:15:28,060
I'll just show him.

355
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:29,311
Operator, get me...

356
00:16:03,979 --> 00:16:06,482
kitchie-kitchie-coo.

357
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:08,984
Kitchie-kitchie-cooper.

358
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:24,750
It's good for a laugh
but there must be

359
00:16:24,785 --> 00:16:27,252
something else i can
do with this thing.

360
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:28,504
I'll think about it.

361
00:16:42,017 --> 00:16:43,886
...the police.

362
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:48,390
Uh... never mind, operator.

363
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:50,275
He's gone.

364
00:16:55,531 --> 00:16:59,034
So you tell our
advertising agents...

365
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:14,550
hey, joe.
Palucci, all you guys.

366
00:17:14,585 --> 00:17:15,801
Have i got something
to show you.

367
00:17:15,836 --> 00:17:17,669
Well, that takes
care of the game.

368
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:20,172
This thing is so great
you're not going to believe it.

369
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:21,423
Mcnulty, make it quick, huh?

370
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,308
Oh, now, listen,
you just pay attention.

371
00:17:23,343 --> 00:17:24,560
Pay attention.

372
00:17:24,595 --> 00:17:25,811
With this little gizmo,

373
00:17:25,846 --> 00:17:28,313
i can stop trains, tanks,
subways, anything.

374
00:17:28,348 --> 00:17:30,182
What about your mouth?

375
00:17:30,217 --> 00:17:31,433
Funny. Funny.

376
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:33,318
Listen, last night,
i was at the polo grounds.

377
00:17:33,353 --> 00:17:34,570
And right in the middle

378
00:17:34,605 --> 00:17:36,438
of ron hunt's slide
into second base,

379
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:38,941
i stopped the game.

380
00:17:38,976 --> 00:17:40,826
Yeah,
i stopped the game.

381
00:17:40,861 --> 00:17:42,694
I left my seat,
i ran down on the field,

382
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:44,580
i grabbed second base,
and i moved it ten feet.

383
00:17:44,615 --> 00:17:45,831
Come on.

384
00:17:45,866 --> 00:17:47,082
Then i went back up
into the stands,

385
00:17:47,117 --> 00:17:48,333
sat down
and started the game again.

386
00:17:48,368 --> 00:17:51,453
And hunt, instead of being out
by ten feet, was safe,

387
00:17:51,488 --> 00:17:53,338
and the mets went on
to win the game

388
00:17:53,373 --> 00:17:54,590
because snider doubled him home.

389
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:56,458
And that's not the only thing
i can stop with this watch.

390
00:17:57,092 --> 00:17:58,961
I can stop anything- watch.

391
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:32,744
Well?

392
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:34,630
Well, how about that now?

393
00:18:34,665 --> 00:18:35,881
How about what?

394
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:36,498
Are you kidding?

395
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:37,749
Didn't you see what i did?

396
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:39,635
Oh, come on, mcnulty,
out of the way.

397
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:41,503
I want to get home,
get some peace and quiet.

398
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:42,137
Wait a minute.

399
00:18:42,172 --> 00:18:44,640
Fellas, fellas,
wait a minute.

400
00:18:44,675 --> 00:18:46,508
I'll put the
game on again.

401
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:49,011
Oh, no...

402
00:18:51,513 --> 00:18:54,650
well, you done it
again, mcnulty.

403
00:18:54,685 --> 00:18:55,901
You emptied my place.

404
00:18:55,936 --> 00:18:57,769
You drive more guys
out of saloons

405
00:18:57,804 --> 00:18:59,021
than carry nation.

406
00:18:59,056 --> 00:19:00,906
I get it.
I get it.

407
00:19:00,941 --> 00:19:04,026
Of course you guys didn't see-
you were frozen.

408
00:19:04,061 --> 00:19:05,160
I'm the only one who knows.

409
00:19:05,195 --> 00:19:06,411
I'm the only one.

410
00:19:06,446 --> 00:19:08,914
Huh. How about that.

411
00:19:08,949 --> 00:19:12,534
The greatest conversation piece
in the world- the greatest-

412
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:13,785
and what does it do?

413
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,037
It stops conversation.

414
00:19:15,072 --> 00:19:16,538
I'm closing up in a few minutes,

415
00:19:16,573 --> 00:19:19,675
so it shouldn't be a total loss,
you better order up.

416
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:20,926
Beer.

417
00:19:20,961 --> 00:19:22,044
Beer!

418
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:25,180
Don't you ever order
anything expensive?

419
00:19:25,215 --> 00:19:27,049
Beer.

420
00:19:27,084 --> 00:19:28,300
And drink it fast,
will you?

421
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:31,436
'Cause the combination
of you, the hot weather,

422
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:32,688
and my business
recession

423
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:35,190
is more than i can
take in one day.

424
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:38,944
Give it time.
Give it time.

425
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:43,949
Give me a heart attack
sometime, will you, mcnulty?

426
00:19:43,984 --> 00:19:45,817
Leave a tip.

427
00:19:56,211 --> 00:19:57,462
Hey, palucci, come here.

428
00:20:00,716 --> 00:20:01,967
Look at me.

429
00:20:02,002 --> 00:20:04,469
What are you, some
kind of a sadist?

430
00:20:04,504 --> 00:20:06,338
You know what
you're looking at?

431
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:07,589
A jerk, a nut.

432
00:20:07,624 --> 00:20:09,474
You want to stop there
or try for moron?

433
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:10,976
Why do i want this thing? Why?

434
00:20:11,011 --> 00:20:12,844
Because i want a little notice,
that's why.

435
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:14,730
I'm not ashamed to admit that.

436
00:20:14,765 --> 00:20:16,598
And i'll tell you
something else.

437
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:18,483
When john d. Rockefeller
steps out of a car,

438
00:20:18,518 --> 00:20:20,986
why do people want
to shake his hand?

439
00:20:21,021 --> 00:20:21,737
I'll bite.

440
00:20:22,104 --> 00:20:22,738
Because he's loaded.

441
00:20:22,773 --> 00:20:25,857
Because he's got cash, loot,
lettuce, the old mazoo.

442
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:28,994
That's why people want to shake
john d. Rockefeller's hand.

443
00:20:29,029 --> 00:20:31,496
J.b. Morgan walks
into a restaurant...
j.p.

444
00:20:31,531 --> 00:20:32,748
J.p. Morgan walks
into a restaurant,

445
00:20:32,783 --> 00:20:34,616
the head waiter
breaks his back

446
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:35,867
to get a table ready.

447
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:37,753
You know why?
I'll tell you why.

448
00:20:37,788 --> 00:20:39,004
I figured you would.

449
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,123
Because he's loaded, that's why.

450
00:20:41,158 --> 00:20:43,008
You think about that.

451
00:20:43,043 --> 00:20:45,260
And then you
think about this.

452
00:20:45,295 --> 00:20:49,131
As of tomorrow evening,
mcnulty is going to be loaded.

453
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:51,133
Palucci, take
a good look

454
00:20:51,168 --> 00:20:52,384
at the old mcnulty.

455
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:54,269
The next time
you see me,

456
00:20:54,304 --> 00:20:55,520
it'll be the
new mcnulty.

457
00:20:55,555 --> 00:20:58,023
Why don't you go
the whole route

458
00:20:58,058 --> 00:20:59,274
and move
to honolulu?

459
00:20:59,309 --> 00:21:02,394
Tomorrow i'll be able
to buy honolulu!

460
00:22:13,598 --> 00:22:15,467
May i?

461
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:16,718
Thank you.

462
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:32,117
Oh, no.

463
00:22:32,152 --> 00:22:33,985
Come on, everyone.

464
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,488
Move! Move!

465
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:39,124
Come on, everybody.

466
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:40,375
Up, up, move!

467
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:41,626
Do something.

468
00:22:41,661 --> 00:22:43,495
Come on, everybody,
say something.

469
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:44,746
Walk, hey!

470
00:22:44,781 --> 00:22:47,883
Come on, everybody, move.

471
00:23:04,766 --> 00:23:07,903
Hey, fellas,
look, i didn't mean it.

472
00:23:07,938 --> 00:23:09,154
I'll have it fixed.

473
00:23:09,189 --> 00:23:12,274
Oh, please, come on, wake up.

474
00:23:12,309 --> 00:23:13,525
Mr. Cooper...

475
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:14,910
mr. Cooper?

476
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:19,781
Excuse me.

477
00:23:19,816 --> 00:23:20,782
I'm sorry.

478
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:24,536
I'm sorry,
i didn't mean it.

479
00:23:25,787 --> 00:23:27,038
Please, understand.

480
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:28,924
It's not my fault.

481
00:23:28,959 --> 00:23:31,426
I didn't do any... oh, no!

482
00:23:31,461 --> 00:23:33,929
Please, say something.

483
00:23:33,964 --> 00:23:35,180
Move!

484
00:23:35,215 --> 00:23:37,682
Charlie, i'm sorry i bugged you.

485
00:23:37,717 --> 00:23:38,934
Charlie, move.

486
00:23:38,969 --> 00:23:40,185
Lady...

487
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:40,802
joe...

488
00:23:41,436 --> 00:23:42,053
joe?

489
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:43,305
Joe, say something.

490
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,556
Do something, move.

491
00:23:44,591 --> 00:23:45,807
Joe, insult me.

492
00:23:45,842 --> 00:23:47,692
I won't come here anymore.

493
00:23:47,727 --> 00:23:48,944
I won't make noise.

494
00:23:48,979 --> 00:23:50,812
I won't drive people away.

495
00:23:51,446 --> 00:23:52,697
Honest, joe, move.

496
00:23:52,732 --> 00:23:54,566
Oh, you, mister,
please, say something.

497
00:23:54,601 --> 00:23:55,817
I'm sorry i took the money.

498
00:23:55,852 --> 00:23:57,068
I don't care about the money.

499
00:23:57,103 --> 00:24:00,205
All i want is to hear people
say something again

500
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,707
and to see people moving again.

501
00:24:02,742 --> 00:24:05,210
Oh, doesn't anybody know how
to make this thing work again?

502
00:24:05,245 --> 00:24:07,078
Someone, help!

503
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:08,330
Help me!

504
00:24:08,365 --> 00:24:10,215
Please, somebody move!

505
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:13,969
Talk, say something! Help!

506
00:24:14,004 --> 00:24:17,589
Mr. Patrick thomas mcnulty
who had a gift of time.

507
00:24:17,624 --> 00:24:20,091
He used it and he misused it

508
00:24:20,126 --> 00:24:22,594
and now he's just been
handed the bill.

509
00:24:22,629 --> 00:24:27,599
Tonight's tale of motion and
mcnulty- in the twilight zone.

510
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:31,403
And now mr. Serling.

511
00:24:31,438 --> 00:24:34,523
Next ontwilight zone
a gentleman of myriad talents

512
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:36,408
and a story written
especially for him.

513
00:24:36,443 --> 00:24:40,162
Mr. Mickey rooney appears in
"the last night of a jockey."

514
00:24:40,197 --> 00:24:42,030
He plays the role
of a diminutive little man

515
00:24:42,065 --> 00:24:44,533
screaming for help
in the bottom of a barrel,

516
00:24:44,568 --> 00:24:45,784
and the help he receives

517
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:47,669
is unexpected
and quite incredible.

518
00:24:47,704 --> 00:24:49,538
Onthe twilight zone,
a cast of one-

519
00:24:49,573 --> 00:24:51,423
mr. Mickey rooney.

520
00:24:51,458 --> 00:24:54,543
I hope you'll be able
to be with us.
