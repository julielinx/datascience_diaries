1
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,678
You're traveling
through another dimension

2
00:00:11,713 --> 00:00:14,814
a dimension not only
of sight and sound, but of mind

3
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:16,683
a journey into a wondrous land

4
00:00:16,718 --> 00:00:18,568
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

5
00:00:18,603 --> 00:00:20,437
That's the signpost up ahead.

6
00:00:20,472 --> 00:00:22,322
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

7
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:36,086
Here they come.

8
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:44,844
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

9
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,347
have you reached
a verdict?

10
00:00:47,382 --> 00:00:49,349
We have, your honor.

11
00:00:49,384 --> 00:00:50,850
And what is the verdict?

12
00:00:50,885 --> 00:00:53,353
Your honor, we find
the defendant, adam grant,

13
00:00:53,388 --> 00:00:55,221
guilty of murder
in the first degree.

14
00:00:59,109 --> 00:01:01,611
The defendant will rise.

15
00:01:04,114 --> 00:01:05,982
The defendant will rise!

16
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:08,985
Adam.

17
00:01:21,881 --> 00:01:26,252
Adam grant, you have been tried
by a jury of your peers,

18
00:01:26,287 --> 00:01:27,504
and found guilty.

19
00:01:27,539 --> 00:01:29,389
Do you have anything

20
00:01:29,424 --> 00:01:30,640
you wish to say

21
00:01:30,675 --> 00:01:32,509
before sentence
is passed?

22
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:38,148
Very well.

23
00:01:38,183 --> 00:01:40,650
It is the sentence of this court

24
00:01:40,685 --> 00:01:42,519
that for the brutal
and despicable crime

25
00:01:43,153 --> 00:01:44,404
of murder
in the first degree

26
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:48,158
you shall be put to death
by means of electrocution.

27
00:01:59,169 --> 00:02:01,037
No!

28
00:02:01,072 --> 00:02:03,540
Not again!

29
00:02:03,575 --> 00:02:05,425
I won't die again!

30
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,294
You can't make me die again!

31
00:02:08,329 --> 00:02:11,431
Oh, god, please,
please, please...

32
00:02:12,682 --> 00:02:14,551
tell them,
mr. District attorney,

33
00:02:14,586 --> 00:02:15,802
that this isn't real.

34
00:02:15,837 --> 00:02:18,188
Make 'em understand they're
only a dream i'm having!

35
00:02:18,223 --> 00:02:21,191
You fools!
You kill me, you'll die!

36
00:02:21,226 --> 00:02:23,693
You believe me,
make him believe me!

37
00:02:23,728 --> 00:02:26,813
Tell the district attorney
he's prosecuted himself

38
00:02:26,848 --> 00:02:31,201
and everybody in this building
and everybody in the world!

39
00:02:31,236 --> 00:02:33,703
Tell him, mr. Carson,
before it's too late!

40
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,206
Tell him! Tell him!

41
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:43,079
Adam grant, a nondescript kind
of man found guilty of murder

42
00:02:43,114 --> 00:02:44,964
and sentenced
to the electric chair.

43
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:48,718
Like every other criminal caught
in the wheels of justice,

44
00:02:48,753 --> 00:02:51,221
he's scared right down
to the marrow of his bones.

45
00:02:51,256 --> 00:02:53,089
But it isn't prison
that scares him-

46
00:02:53,124 --> 00:02:55,592
the long silent
nights of waiting,

47
00:02:55,627 --> 00:02:59,345
the slow walk to the little room
or even death itself.

48
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,848
It's something else
that holds adam grant

49
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:04,350
in the hot, sweaty
grip of fear.

50
00:03:04,385 --> 00:03:06,853
Something worse
than any punishment

51
00:03:06,888 --> 00:03:08,104
this world has to offer.

52
00:03:08,139 --> 00:03:11,858
Something found only
in the twilight zone.

53
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,459
Coley!

54
00:04:04,746 --> 00:04:05,962
Lay off of that thing, will ya?

55
00:04:05,997 --> 00:04:07,714
I'm sorry, grant.

56
00:04:07,749 --> 00:04:11,467
I didn't know
i was bothering anybody.

57
00:04:11,502 --> 00:04:12,835
It's all right, coley.

58
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,087
It's my fault.

59
00:04:14,122 --> 00:04:16,589
I...

60
00:04:16,624 --> 00:04:19,726
i got you out of
a bad movie i saw once,

61
00:04:19,761 --> 00:04:22,845
just like everything else
in this corny dream.

62
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,987
Grant!

63
00:04:31,022 --> 00:04:32,855
Let me give you some advice.

64
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:34,107
Don't think about it.

65
00:04:34,142 --> 00:04:37,860
You think about it, you'll
crack up like phillips there.

66
00:04:37,895 --> 00:04:39,112
Listen to him.

67
00:04:39,147 --> 00:04:40,363
Mother, i'm sorry.

68
00:04:40,398 --> 00:04:46,502
Don't let them hurt me, mother.

69
00:04:46,537 --> 00:04:50,256
Don't let them hurt me.

70
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:51,507
Phillips!

71
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,509
Shut your face!

72
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:59,132
A month ago,
he was a human being.

73
00:04:59,167 --> 00:05:00,383
Now what is he?

74
00:05:00,418 --> 00:05:02,268
An animal, a thing.

75
00:05:02,303 --> 00:05:03,519
Why?

76
00:05:03,554 --> 00:05:06,022
Because he couldn't
stop thinking about it.

77
00:05:06,057 --> 00:05:07,890
I know it.

78
00:05:07,925 --> 00:05:09,525
It's...

79
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:12,645
it's just different with me.

80
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,530
You mean
you want to die?

81
00:05:14,565 --> 00:05:15,148
No.

82
00:05:15,183 --> 00:05:17,650
Well, it ain't different
with you.

83
00:05:17,685 --> 00:05:19,535
So don't
kid yourself.

84
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:20,787
Sometimes
i wonder, too,

85
00:05:20,822 --> 00:05:23,289
what it's going
to be like.

86
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,409
I'll tell you what it's like.

87
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:33,800
You walk out of your cell,
pass two gray doors,

88
00:05:33,835 --> 00:05:36,302
78 steps to the final door.

89
00:05:36,337 --> 00:05:37,553
It's painted green.

90
00:05:37,588 --> 00:05:41,307
There's a guard
that opens the door for you,

91
00:05:41,342 --> 00:05:43,176
and you go into a room.

92
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:48,181
It's tan.

93
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,568
It's all tan.

94
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:57,573
There's nothing in it
except one chair.

95
00:05:57,608 --> 00:05:59,442
It's like a chair
you used to sit in

96
00:05:59,477 --> 00:06:00,693
when you were a kid.

97
00:06:00,728 --> 00:06:01,944
It's hard and solid.

98
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:03,830
Ah, cut it out, cut it out.

99
00:06:03,865 --> 00:06:07,583
They strap your arms and legs.

100
00:06:07,618 --> 00:06:10,086
Then they attach the electrodes.

101
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,708
It's funny.

102
00:06:15,743 --> 00:06:18,211
They always feel cold
to the touch at first.

103
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:19,595
Aw, grant,
you talk

104
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:22,098
like you been
through it already.

105
00:06:22,133 --> 00:06:25,852
Then they
drop the mask.

106
00:06:25,887 --> 00:06:27,103
It's musty.

107
00:06:27,138 --> 00:06:30,223
It smells like
an old sofa.

108
00:06:30,258 --> 00:06:32,225
And then you wait...

109
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,612
every muscle tense,

110
00:06:36,647 --> 00:06:37,980
straining.

111
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:42,985
Any second,
any second...

112
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,488
then you can almost hear it.

113
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:49,242
They pull the switch.

114
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:13,766
Madame.

115
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:16,269
I am a poor
lost traveler

116
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:19,405
seeking food
and lodging for the night.

117
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,274
You're loaded.

118
00:07:21,309 --> 00:07:25,027
Hank, i've just been
insulted by your wife.

119
00:07:25,062 --> 00:07:26,913
She's says i'm loaded.

120
00:07:26,948 --> 00:07:28,781
Well, aren't you?

121
00:07:28,816 --> 00:07:31,284
That has nothing
to do with it.

122
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,289
Hey, hey,
take it easy.

123
00:07:36,324 --> 00:07:38,174
That's
my best gin.

124
00:07:40,676 --> 00:07:42,545
Dear friends,
when i die

125
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:47,550
i don't want to see
any full bottles around.

126
00:07:47,585 --> 00:07:48,801
That's
not funny.

127
00:07:48,836 --> 00:07:51,304
It wasn't meant to be.

128
00:07:51,339 --> 00:07:54,440
It was meant
to be a comment

129
00:07:54,475 --> 00:07:58,811
on the short, unhappy
life of paul carson.

130
00:07:58,846 --> 00:08:00,696
Come...

131
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,701
drink and be merry,

132
00:08:05,736 --> 00:08:08,204
for tomorrow...

133
00:08:08,239 --> 00:08:11,324
oh, shut up, paul.

134
00:08:11,359 --> 00:08:12,575
Sorry.

135
00:08:19,215 --> 00:08:23,586
Well, only a few more hours.

136
00:08:23,621 --> 00:08:24,837
I knew it.

137
00:08:24,872 --> 00:08:27,340
I knew it the minute
you walked in.

138
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:28,591
We're not nervous enough.

139
00:08:28,626 --> 00:08:30,476
Oh, no, we have to listen

140
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:33,596
to the great city editor
with his news behind the news.

141
00:08:33,631 --> 00:08:34,847
If i'm not
welcome here,

142
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:36,732
then i shall
go elsewhere

143
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:37,984
and breathe
my last...

144
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:39,235
oh, never mind.

145
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:41,737
I've had enough
of this wake anyway.

146
00:08:41,772 --> 00:08:42,989
Good night, dear.

147
00:08:43,024 --> 00:08:44,857
What about dinner?

148
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:46,742
Lost my appetite.

149
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:52,365
Oh, the steak
can come out

150
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,616
in five
minutes.

151
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,118
Hank.

152
00:08:56,153 --> 00:08:58,004
Now, don't start it.

153
00:08:58,039 --> 00:08:59,872
I've got to start it.

154
00:08:59,907 --> 00:09:01,123
I'm not upset
or disturbed

155
00:09:01,158 --> 00:09:02,375
or nervous anymore.

156
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:03,626
I'm scared.

157
00:09:03,661 --> 00:09:04,877
That's ridiculous.

158
00:09:04,912 --> 00:09:06,128
I know it is,
i know it is,

159
00:09:06,762 --> 00:09:08,014
but that
doesn't help.

160
00:09:08,049 --> 00:09:09,265
Do you mean to say

161
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,133
you believe
that crazy story?

162
00:09:11,168 --> 00:09:13,019
God, help me,
hank, but i do.

163
00:09:13,054 --> 00:09:15,521
At least, i believe
it's possible.

164
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:16,772
Well, why not?

165
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:17,390
Can we prove
he's wrong?

166
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:19,892
Maybe not,
but that's a poor reason

167
00:09:19,927 --> 00:09:21,777
for believing
in anything.

168
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:23,029
I can't prove

169
00:09:23,064 --> 00:09:24,897
that the world
isn't going to end.

170
00:09:26,782 --> 00:09:28,034
But it isn't.

171
00:09:29,285 --> 00:09:31,153
This guy killed
a man in cold blood,

172
00:09:31,188 --> 00:09:33,039
and he's going
to pay for it.

173
00:09:33,074 --> 00:09:34,290
Those are the facts.

174
00:09:34,325 --> 00:09:36,158
Anything else is
speculation, fantasy.

175
00:09:36,193 --> 00:09:37,410
Are you sure?
Yes, i'm sure.

176
00:09:37,445 --> 00:09:39,295
Then what are you
so steamed up about?

177
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:41,163
I...
i'll tell you why.

178
00:09:41,198 --> 00:09:43,666
Because a little
part of you believes, too.

179
00:09:43,701 --> 00:09:46,168
Just a little, tiny part
of henry ritchie says

180
00:09:46,203 --> 00:09:47,420
"maybe this grant
is right.

181
00:09:47,455 --> 00:09:48,671
Maybe this is
all a dream."

182
00:09:48,706 --> 00:09:51,173
The thought has
occurred to you, hasn't it?

183
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:52,675
Hank, haven't you
ever stopped

184
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:54,560
and said,
"this couldn't be real.

185
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:57,063
"I couldn't be
the district attorney.

186
00:09:57,098 --> 00:09:59,565
"I couldn't have
a lovely wife like carol

187
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,068
"and a lovely home,
money in the bank,

188
00:10:02,103 --> 00:10:03,319
not in any real world."

189
00:10:03,354 --> 00:10:04,570
Haven't you, hank?

190
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:05,821
Well, of course.
Everyone has.

191
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:07,073
If you're a success,

192
00:10:07,108 --> 00:10:08,941
you're bound to
think it's a dream.

193
00:10:08,976 --> 00:10:11,444
If not, you think
it's a nightmare.

194
00:10:11,479 --> 00:10:13,329
This only proves
that grant is human.

195
00:10:13,364 --> 00:10:15,831
He can't believe
what's happening to him

196
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:17,700
so he tries to
convince himself

197
00:10:17,735 --> 00:10:18,951
that it isn't,
not really.

198
00:10:18,986 --> 00:10:22,088
Yeah, that's what
i thought too at first.

199
00:10:22,123 --> 00:10:25,207
But hank, i been talking
to this kid a lot lately,

200
00:10:25,242 --> 00:10:26,459
and he makes sense.

201
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:28,344
Go down and see
for yourself.

202
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:29,595
Don't take my
word for it.

203
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:30,212
It wouldn't do
any good.

204
00:10:30,846 --> 00:10:32,715
You only listened
to him once.

205
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:33,966
That was enough.

206
00:10:34,001 --> 00:10:36,469
Hank, for my
sake, please,

207
00:10:36,504 --> 00:10:38,220
go and see him.

208
00:10:38,255 --> 00:10:39,472
Let him tell you.

209
00:10:39,507 --> 00:10:41,357
Please, hank.

210
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:44,477
It's pointless but...

211
00:10:44,512 --> 00:10:45,728
thanks.

212
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:48,864
Jiggs.

213
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:50,232
Jiggs!

214
00:10:50,267 --> 00:10:51,484
Yeah?

215
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,369
What time
is it?

216
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:56,489
9:05.

217
00:10:56,524 --> 00:11:00,242
Why, you got a date somewhere?

218
00:11:00,277 --> 00:11:02,995
No, i'm just expecting someone.

219
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,246
The governor,
right?

220
00:11:04,281 --> 00:11:07,383
With a nice fat pardon
in his fist.

221
00:11:07,418 --> 00:11:09,635
No, it's the district attorney.

222
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:12,755
He usually comes around
about 9:00.

223
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,890
Oh, you don't say?

224
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:17,393
The d.a. Himself, huh?

225
00:11:17,428 --> 00:11:21,514
Yeah, yeah, the d.a. Himself.

226
00:11:21,549 --> 00:11:25,151
You got a great
sense of humor, pal.

227
00:11:25,186 --> 00:11:26,652
Wait a minute.

228
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:29,772
There's something else
that doesn't work-

229
00:11:29,807 --> 00:11:30,406
the watch.

230
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:31,657
Yeah, how is that?

231
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:33,526
Prisoners about
to be executed

232
00:11:33,561 --> 00:11:35,411
aren't allowed
to wear watches

233
00:11:35,446 --> 00:11:37,279
because of the glass.

234
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:44,170
You see, he's right
on time, huh, jiggs?

235
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:48,040
Ten minutes, mr. Ritchie.

236
00:11:48,075 --> 00:11:51,177
All right.
You can leave us alone.

237
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:54,930
Hello, grant.

238
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:56,799
Hello, mr. Ritchie.

239
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,309
You don't seem
surprised to see me.

240
00:12:07,344 --> 00:12:08,561
I'm not-
you always come.

241
00:12:08,596 --> 00:12:11,697
I mean, the district
attorney always comes.

242
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:12,948
It isn't always you.

243
00:12:12,983 --> 00:12:13,566
Grant.

244
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:14,817
Yes?

245
00:12:14,852 --> 00:12:17,319
I take it you're
sticking to

246
00:12:17,354 --> 00:12:19,205
this dream
story of yours.

247
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,707
That's right.

248
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:24,210
It can't possibly
do you any good now.

249
00:12:24,245 --> 00:12:25,461
You realize...

250
00:12:26,712 --> 00:12:29,215
i should,
after all this time

251
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,466
every night,
i explain.

252
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,968
Every night,
it's the same.

253
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:35,471
All right,
explain again.

254
00:12:35,506 --> 00:12:37,223
Well, it's very simple.

255
00:12:37,258 --> 00:12:38,474
When i die, you die,

256
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:40,976
and everybody in this world dies

257
00:12:41,011 --> 00:12:42,845
because this world
does not exist.

258
00:12:43,479 --> 00:12:44,730
It's a dream of mine.

259
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:45,981
It's a nightmare.

260
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:47,850
Can't you
understand that?

261
00:12:47,885 --> 00:12:50,352
No, grant,
i can't understand that.

262
00:12:50,387 --> 00:12:52,238
Not because it's a new idea.

263
00:12:52,273 --> 00:12:55,357
I can't understand it
or accept it

264
00:12:55,392 --> 00:12:59,111
because it doesn't make
any kind of logical sense.

265
00:12:59,146 --> 00:13:00,112
But it does.

266
00:13:00,147 --> 00:13:01,997
It's the only thing
that does make logical sense.

267
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:03,249
Take you, for instance.

268
00:13:03,284 --> 00:13:04,366
You think
you'd be visiting a man

269
00:13:04,401 --> 00:13:06,869
that was just about
to be executed in real life?

270
00:13:06,904 --> 00:13:07,503
Of course not.

271
00:13:07,538 --> 00:13:09,371
They wouldn't
allow you in here.

272
00:13:09,406 --> 00:13:10,122
Or you take me.

273
00:13:10,157 --> 00:13:12,007
You don't know
any more about me

274
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:15,127
than you did when this
thing started- i'm a stranger.

275
00:13:15,162 --> 00:13:17,630
There are a hundred
vagrants in every town

276
00:13:17,665 --> 00:13:19,515
without names,
without histories.

277
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,766
Stop that!

278
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:24,887
We know

279
00:13:24,922 --> 00:13:26,772
you're
mentally sound.

280
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:28,023
And i don't think

281
00:13:28,524 --> 00:13:30,392
you're deliberately lying to me.

282
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:34,029
I'm going
to destroy

283
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:35,898
that story of
yours, grant, now

284
00:13:35,933 --> 00:13:37,149
once and for all.

285
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:39,652
You say that all
this is a dream,

286
00:13:39,687 --> 00:13:42,788
and that when you're
electrocuted you wake up,

287
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:45,908
and when you wake up,
we all disappear, right?

288
00:13:45,943 --> 00:13:47,159
That's right.

289
00:13:47,194 --> 00:13:49,662
What about our parents
and our parents' parents

290
00:13:49,697 --> 00:13:51,547
and everybody who never
even heard of you?

291
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,415
What about them,
mr. Ritchie?

292
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:56,552
A dream builds
its own world, mr. Ritchie.

293
00:13:56,587 --> 00:13:58,420
It's complete.

294
00:13:58,455 --> 00:14:01,557
With a past, and, as long as
you stay asleep, a future.

295
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:04,059
What about us then
when we sleep and dream?

296
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,562
Or is that when
you're up and around?

297
00:14:06,597 --> 00:14:10,933
You only sleep and dream
because i dream you that way.

298
00:14:10,968 --> 00:14:14,320
All right, now answer me this.

299
00:14:14,355 --> 00:14:15,571
You're scared now- why?

300
00:14:15,606 --> 00:14:17,439
Why are you scared?

301
00:14:17,474 --> 00:14:20,576
You've got to wake up sometime
even if you're electrocuted.

302
00:14:20,611 --> 00:14:23,078
So why don't you just
sit back and enjoy it?

303
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:28,701
Enjoy it.

304
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:36,842
Let me tell
you something.

305
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:39,962
Mr. Ritchie,
how soundly do you sleep?

306
00:14:39,997 --> 00:14:41,213
What's that got...?

307
00:14:41,248 --> 00:14:43,098
You dream,
don't you?

308
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:44,350
Certainly, sometimes.

309
00:14:44,385 --> 00:14:46,852
Haven't you ever been hurt
in one of those dreams?

310
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:50,606
Fallen out of a window
or been drowned or tortured?

311
00:14:50,641 --> 00:14:51,857
You have!

312
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:54,977
Don't you remember
how real it had seemed?

313
00:14:55,012 --> 00:14:56,612
Remember how you
woke up screaming?

314
00:14:56,647 --> 00:14:58,480
Well, let me ask you something,
mr. Ritchie.

315
00:14:58,515 --> 00:15:00,983
How do you like to wake up
screaming every night?

316
00:15:01,018 --> 00:15:02,234
That's what i do.

317
00:15:02,618 --> 00:15:06,372
Because i dream the same dream
night after night after night!

318
00:15:06,407 --> 00:15:08,240
It's this one!

319
00:15:08,275 --> 00:15:09,491
It changes a little bit.

320
00:15:09,526 --> 00:15:12,628
The people get twisted around,
but it's the same dream.

321
00:15:12,663 --> 00:15:14,496
You've got to believe me!

322
00:15:14,531 --> 00:15:15,998
I can't
go on dying!

323
00:15:16,033 --> 00:15:17,249
I can't go
on dying!

324
00:15:17,284 --> 00:15:18,500
I can't,
i can't...

325
00:15:18,535 --> 00:15:21,003
i'm telling the
truth, mr. Ritchie!

326
00:15:21,038 --> 00:15:23,505
Please, let me live and
i'll keep you alive.

327
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:26,642
I'll dream you every
night just like this.

328
00:15:26,677 --> 00:15:28,510
Wait a minute!
I'll prove it to you.

329
00:15:28,545 --> 00:15:31,013
You wife,
she has a steak cooking for you.

330
00:15:31,048 --> 00:15:33,265
Go home, look
in the oven.

331
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,150
It'll be
something else.

332
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:36,018
Please!

333
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:43,158
Well?

334
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:50,032
What's wrong, hank?

335
00:15:50,067 --> 00:15:52,534
That's a roast.

336
00:15:52,569 --> 00:15:55,037
What about it?

337
00:15:55,072 --> 00:15:57,539
Hank, what about it?

338
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:11,520
Grant.

339
00:16:11,555 --> 00:16:13,389
Huh?

340
00:16:13,424 --> 00:16:14,640
Did i wake you up?

341
00:16:19,063 --> 00:16:21,530
No.

342
00:16:21,565 --> 00:16:23,399
What's funny?

343
00:16:23,434 --> 00:16:25,901
Nothing's funny.

344
00:16:25,936 --> 00:16:27,152
Well, you was laughing.

345
00:16:27,187 --> 00:16:29,038
I heard ya.

346
00:16:29,073 --> 00:16:30,906
Hey, grant, listen,

347
00:16:30,941 --> 00:16:34,043
i been thinking about
what you said,

348
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:37,162
about this all being a dream
and all.

349
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:39,048
Well, now, maybe it won't work,

350
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:41,550
but if you told that story
to the governor,

351
00:16:41,585 --> 00:16:44,053
he might let you out
on a psycho.

352
00:16:44,088 --> 00:16:46,555
He wouldn't believe me.

353
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,424
You don't believe me,
do you, jiggs?

354
00:16:48,459 --> 00:16:50,309
Oh, that's got nothing
to do with it.

355
00:16:50,344 --> 00:16:52,811
If you think it's true, see,

356
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:55,314
why, then you got a loose cog
somewhere,

357
00:16:55,349 --> 00:16:58,434
and they don't burn guys
with loose cogs.

358
00:16:58,469 --> 00:17:00,319
What if i proved it to you?

359
00:17:00,354 --> 00:17:03,439
How?

360
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:08,444
Well, jiggs, don't you think
that all of this is just...

361
00:17:08,479 --> 00:17:11,580
just a little bit too much
the way it should be?

362
00:17:11,615 --> 00:17:13,449
I don't get you.

363
00:17:13,484 --> 00:17:15,334
Well, i mean
it's so pat.

364
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:17,836
I got tried and sentenced
the same day.

365
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:19,705
It doesn't work like that.

366
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:22,841
But you see that's the way
that i saw it in my mind

367
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:24,710
and so that's the way it is.

368
00:17:24,745 --> 00:17:26,595
Or you take this place here-

369
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:29,715
you and coley
and his harmonica,

370
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,851
or phillips
and his mother.

371
00:17:34,138 --> 00:17:35,354
It's like a movie.

372
00:17:35,389 --> 00:17:37,856
Real death houses
aren't like that.

373
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:41,610
But you see, i've never
been in a real death house

374
00:17:41,645 --> 00:17:44,730
so that's...
that's my impression of it.

375
00:17:44,765 --> 00:17:46,482
Man, you've really flipped.

376
00:17:46,517 --> 00:17:49,618
I don't know
what you're talking about.

377
00:17:58,127 --> 00:18:00,629
Well, the brothers
grimm, as i live...

378
00:18:00,664 --> 00:18:01,880
what are
you doing up?

379
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:03,632
I'm not up.

380
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:08,003
I'm down, just like you
and your funny friend here.

381
00:18:08,038 --> 00:18:08,754
Have they...?

382
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:10,639
15 more minutes.

383
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:15,260
That's another thing.

384
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:17,763
Why does this always
happen around midnight?

385
00:18:17,798 --> 00:18:19,398
Because that's
when it happens.

386
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:21,266
Yeah, but why?
You tell me why.

387
00:18:21,301 --> 00:18:22,518
According to grant,

388
00:18:22,553 --> 00:18:24,403
he doesn't know anything
about these matters

389
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:25,654
except what he
sees in the movies.

390
00:18:25,689 --> 00:18:27,523
In the movies, it always
happens at midnight.

391
00:18:27,558 --> 00:18:30,025
Because movies
are technically accurate.

392
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,528
That's strange, too,
come to think of it.

393
00:18:32,563 --> 00:18:34,413
Then don't come
to think of it.

394
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,920
Hey, screws,
you're wasting your time.

395
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:43,789
You can't kill him.

396
00:18:43,824 --> 00:18:45,040
You want to know why?

397
00:18:45,075 --> 00:18:46,291
I'll tell you why.

398
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:49,428
Because you're nothing
but dreams. Dreams!

399
00:18:49,463 --> 00:18:50,679
You hear that, screws?

400
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,309
Is there anything
you wish to say

401
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:08,063
in these few moments
remaining to you, my son?

402
00:19:08,697 --> 00:19:11,200
No.

403
00:19:11,235 --> 00:19:14,953
Then let us pray.

404
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:16,822
There's no need.

405
00:19:16,857 --> 00:19:20,576
There's always a need
for prayer, my son.

406
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:23,712
Only in the real world,
father,

407
00:19:23,747 --> 00:19:24,963
not in a nightmare.

408
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:27,466
You feel detached
from reality?

409
00:19:31,255 --> 00:19:34,339
I not only feel it-
i am detached.

410
00:19:38,727 --> 00:19:44,349
I wonder where i've seen you,
where your face came from.

411
00:19:44,384 --> 00:19:45,601
It's familiar.

412
00:19:45,636 --> 00:19:47,486
Almost every time

413
00:19:47,521 --> 00:19:49,354
it just about
comes to me.

414
00:19:49,389 --> 00:19:50,606
We've never met.

415
00:19:50,641 --> 00:19:53,742
Oh, yes...

416
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:54,993
yes, we have.

417
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:56,862
Father beamon.

418
00:19:56,897 --> 00:19:58,113
Of course,
father beamon

419
00:19:58,148 --> 00:19:59,998
from over
at spring hill.

420
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:01,867
No wonder
i didn't recognize you.

421
00:20:01,902 --> 00:20:04,753
You died
when i was ten years old.

422
00:20:04,788 --> 00:20:07,873
Oh, everybody
came to your funeral.

423
00:20:07,908 --> 00:20:09,758
My name is
beamon but...

424
00:20:09,793 --> 00:20:12,261
yes, and then
a young priest came

425
00:20:12,296 --> 00:20:14,763
and took your place...

426
00:20:17,301 --> 00:20:19,134
that was carson.

427
00:20:19,169 --> 00:20:21,637
You know,
i'm using him

428
00:20:21,672 --> 00:20:23,138
for the editor.

429
00:20:23,173 --> 00:20:25,023
Be still, my son.

430
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:28,777
But what about ritchie,
the district attorney?

431
00:20:28,812 --> 00:20:31,897
He must have been
a schoolteacher of mine.

432
00:20:31,932 --> 00:20:35,033
Maybe he was a friend of dad's.

433
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:59,057
Hey, grant,
they can't do this to you.

434
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:00,926
You're home in bed, asleep.

435
00:21:00,961 --> 00:21:02,811
Remember?

436
00:21:02,846 --> 00:21:04,680
Grant! Grant!

437
00:21:05,314 --> 00:21:06,682
It's time to wake up, boy.

438
00:21:06,717 --> 00:21:07,933
Wake up! Wake up!

439
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:12,437
You could at least get
a stay of execution.

440
00:21:12,472 --> 00:21:14,323
I know you can do that.

441
00:21:14,358 --> 00:21:14,940
What good
would it do?

442
00:21:14,975 --> 00:21:16,825
We'd simply
have to go through

443
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,076
the whole thing
all over again.

444
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:19,328
Maybe not,
look, hank.

445
00:21:19,363 --> 00:21:20,445
Forget all about
that dream stuff.

446
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,331
Whether that's true or
not, it doesn't matter.

447
00:21:22,366 --> 00:21:23,582
What matters is
the kid believes it.

448
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:24,833
That means
he's got a case.

449
00:21:24,868 --> 00:21:26,084
The psychiatrist...

450
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:27,336
the psychiatrist
made a mistake.

451
00:21:27,371 --> 00:21:29,204
It wouldn't be the first
time. Get a week's stay.

452
00:21:29,239 --> 00:21:30,455
We'll throw in another team. No.

453
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:32,341
Why not? Because
we might be wrong?

454
00:21:32,376 --> 00:21:34,843
Well, maybe we are,
but maybe we're not,

455
00:21:34,878 --> 00:21:36,712
and in my book, that's
reasonable doubt.

456
00:21:36,747 --> 00:21:39,214
Hank, that kid is
sick in the head.

457
00:21:39,249 --> 00:21:41,099
Are you going to send
a mental incompetent

458
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:42,968
to the chair?

459
00:21:49,858 --> 00:21:51,727
I regret this, paul.

460
00:21:51,762 --> 00:21:54,229
I'll regret this
as long as i live.

461
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:02,371
Hello. This is henry ritchie.

462
00:22:02,406 --> 00:22:03,622
I want to speak
to the governor.

463
00:22:03,657 --> 00:22:04,873
Right away.

464
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:11,747
Well, i don't care.

465
00:22:11,782 --> 00:22:12,998
This is an emergency.
Wake him up.

466
00:22:13,033 --> 00:22:14,883
Hurry.

467
00:22:14,918 --> 00:22:17,386
Having trouble
putting this through. He's...

468
00:22:17,421 --> 00:22:18,637
yes, this is henry ritchie.

469
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:21,139
Governor, i don't have time
to explain,

470
00:22:21,174 --> 00:22:23,008
but i want you to grant
a stay of execution

471
00:22:23,043 --> 00:22:24,893
in the case of adam grant.

472
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:31,900
He's calling now.

473
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:05,550
Here they come.

474
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:15,444
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

475
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,312
have you reached a verdict?

476
00:23:17,347 --> 00:23:19,197
We have, your honor.

477
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:21,566
And what
is the verdict?

478
00:23:21,601 --> 00:23:24,319
Your honor, we find
the defendant, adam grant,

479
00:23:24,354 --> 00:23:26,955
guilty of murder
in the first degree.

480
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:29,324
The defendant will rise.

481
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:30,325
Adam.

482
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:39,468
We know that a dream
can be real.

483
00:23:39,503 --> 00:23:42,587
But who ever thought
that reality could be a dream?

484
00:23:42,622 --> 00:23:47,592
We exist, of course,
but how, in what way?

485
00:23:47,627 --> 00:23:50,228
As we believe,
as flesh and blood human beings,

486
00:23:50,263 --> 00:23:51,480
or are we simply parts

487
00:23:51,515 --> 00:23:54,599
of someone's feverish,
complicated nightmare?

488
00:23:54,634 --> 00:23:56,485
Think about it,
and then ask yourself

489
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:00,856
do you live here,
in this country, in this world,

490
00:24:00,891 --> 00:24:04,609
or do you live instead
in the twilight zone?

491
00:24:10,715 --> 00:24:13,201
Rod serling,
creator ofthe twilight zone,

492
00:24:13,236 --> 00:24:15,086
will tell you
about next week's story

493
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:17,589
after this word
from our alternate sponsor.

494
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:20,876
And now, mr. Serling.

495
00:24:20,911 --> 00:24:23,378
Next week, the very considerable
talents of mr. Shelley berman

496
00:24:24,012 --> 00:24:27,132
are utilized to bring you
another in our weekly excursions

497
00:24:27,167 --> 00:24:28,383
into the never-never land

498
00:24:28,418 --> 00:24:30,268
of the wild, the woolly
and the wondrous.

499
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:31,520
He plays the part
of a little man

500
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,022
who yearns for the serenity
of a world without people,

501
00:24:34,057 --> 00:24:36,525
and as it happens,
he gets his wish-

502
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,644
to walk an uninhabited earth
and face the consequences.

503
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,530
Our story is called
"the mind and the matter."

504
00:24:41,565 --> 00:24:44,032
I hope we see you then.

505
00:24:44,067 --> 00:24:46,535
Now this isn't just
a word from the sponsor,

506
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:48,403
it's simply
a very good suggestion.

507
00:24:49,037 --> 00:24:52,157
It stands for real refreshment.

508
00:24:52,192 --> 00:24:54,659
Before we meet again,
try oasis

509
00:24:54,694 --> 00:24:58,413
for the softest taste of all.

510
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:46,094
Be sure and watchgunsmoke,
starring james arness,

511
00:25:46,129 --> 00:25:49,848
saturday nights over most
of these same stations.
