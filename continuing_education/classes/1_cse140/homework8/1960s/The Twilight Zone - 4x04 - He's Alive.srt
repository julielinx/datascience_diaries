1
00:00:06,973 --> 00:00:10,110
You unlock this door
with the key of imagination.

2
00:00:10,145 --> 00:00:12,612
Beyond it is another dimension-

3
00:00:12,647 --> 00:00:14,864
a dimension of sound,

4
00:00:14,899 --> 00:00:17,117
a dimension of sight,

5
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:18,985
a dimension of mind.

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,488
You're moving into a land
of both shadow and substance,

7
00:00:21,523 --> 00:00:23,373
of things and ideas.

8
00:00:23,408 --> 00:00:27,127
You've just crossed over
into the twilight zone.

9
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:49,649
The economy of our world,
now, then, and forever,

10
00:00:49,684 --> 00:00:53,403
have always found

11
00:00:53,438 --> 00:00:59,025
the insidious breed
of international bankers.

12
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,779
These are the worshippers
of the purse.

13
00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:08,418
Their religion
is monetary gain.

14
00:01:08,453 --> 00:01:11,538
Their shrine is gold.

15
00:01:11,573 --> 00:01:13,423
Their loyalties, first,

16
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,925
foremost, and primarily,

17
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,045
deal with money.

18
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,181
What's wrong with that?

19
00:01:21,216 --> 00:01:24,934
Examine the phenomenon
of foreign control.

20
00:01:24,969 --> 00:01:27,053
You examine it,

21
00:01:27,088 --> 00:01:30,190
and you will note
with absolute clarity

22
00:01:30,225 --> 00:01:35,061
that the lines lead
directly to palestine!

23
00:01:36,446 --> 00:01:39,065
They lead directly to africa!

24
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,819
They lead directly...

25
00:01:42,854 --> 00:01:44,704
to the vatican!

26
00:01:47,323 --> 00:01:49,209
Uh, um...

27
00:01:49,244 --> 00:01:51,077
so, so, there we are!

28
00:01:51,112 --> 00:01:52,328
There it is!

29
00:01:52,363 --> 00:01:54,214
There is a conspiracy!

30
00:01:54,249 --> 00:01:57,967
There's a insidious,
enveloping conspiracy!

31
00:01:58,002 --> 00:02:02,338
A conspiracy personified
by the yellow man...

32
00:02:02,373 --> 00:02:05,475
by the black man...

33
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:07,977
and by foreigners
who come in

34
00:02:08,012 --> 00:02:11,097
and infiltrate
into our economic structure.

35
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:14,851
Oh, there'll come a morning,
yes, there will,

36
00:02:14,886 --> 00:02:16,736
there will come a morning

37
00:02:16,771 --> 00:02:19,856
when these men
have taken over your home,

38
00:02:19,891 --> 00:02:21,741
taken over your daughters...

39
00:02:21,776 --> 00:02:24,360
and they'll be sitting
right there on your doorstep.

40
00:02:24,395 --> 00:02:26,496
If anybody's
sitting on your doorstep, buddy,

41
00:02:26,531 --> 00:02:27,747
he's a man in a white coat.

42
00:02:27,782 --> 00:02:29,616
You better
just go with him, quietly.

43
00:02:29,651 --> 00:02:32,001
You think that's funny,
don't you?

44
00:02:32,036 --> 00:02:35,755
You think it's funny
your country can be sold out.

45
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:38,875
That they can sell out your flag
and birth rights.

46
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,126
That's funny, huh?

47
00:02:40,161 --> 00:02:42,629
Well, do something
about it, punk.

48
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,764
You're such
a big tiger,

49
00:02:44,799 --> 00:02:46,266
why don't you come down here
and do something about it?

50
00:02:46,301 --> 00:02:49,385
Let me tell you something
right now.

51
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:53,139
Someday this country's
going to wake up.

52
00:02:53,174 --> 00:02:55,391
And when they find out
how izzy sold them out,

53
00:02:55,426 --> 00:02:57,894
and how rastus sold them out
and how pancho sold them out,

54
00:02:57,929 --> 00:03:00,146
they're going to make up a list

55
00:03:00,181 --> 00:03:02,649
of all the people
that get paid back.

56
00:03:02,684 --> 00:03:05,151
And you know where you'll be?

57
00:03:05,186 --> 00:03:07,036
Right on the top of that list!

58
00:03:11,326 --> 00:03:13,159
Come here, i'll fix...

59
00:03:20,084 --> 00:03:22,552
come here!

60
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:33,563
What's the matter, punk?

61
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:34,814
No more big speeches?

62
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:36,065
No more big talk, huh?

63
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,568
Know what you'll see
when you get home

64
00:03:38,603 --> 00:03:40,436
and look in the mirror?

65
00:03:40,471 --> 00:03:42,939
A scrawny little kook
with a big mouth.

66
00:03:42,974 --> 00:03:46,075
A big hater when you got
a couple of punks

67
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:47,944
in front of you.

68
00:04:03,593 --> 00:04:05,461
Problems, fellas, huh?

69
00:04:05,496 --> 00:04:07,964
The communists,
the communists did this.

70
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:11,718
Which ones?

71
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:17,357
All of 'em,
all of 'em were communists.

72
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,228
What about
some names, jack?

73
00:04:22,263 --> 00:04:24,731
If you press charges,
we'll need names.

74
00:04:24,766 --> 00:04:25,982
Forget about it.

75
00:04:26,017 --> 00:04:28,484
We can handle
this ourselves.

76
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:29,869
Need medical attention?

77
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:32,622
We don't need any.

78
00:04:32,657 --> 00:04:34,490
Okay, jack.

79
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:38,244
Hey, jack.

80
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:41,381
You forgot your, um,

81
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:44,500
your flag.

82
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:50,139
There'll come a day
when guys like you

83
00:04:50,174 --> 00:04:52,642
will crawl on your belly
just to salute this.

84
00:04:52,677 --> 00:04:53,893
There'll come a day.

85
00:04:53,928 --> 00:04:56,262
Let me know the date, jack.

86
00:04:56,297 --> 00:04:58,147
That morning,
i'll cut my wrists.

87
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,167
Hey, pete.

88
00:05:18,202 --> 00:05:20,036
Pete, i'm glad
you're okay.

89
00:05:20,071 --> 00:05:21,287
Boy, there must've been

90
00:05:21,322 --> 00:05:23,790
eight, ten guys
on top of me.

91
00:05:23,825 --> 00:05:26,926
I had all i could
do to get away.

92
00:05:26,961 --> 00:05:28,428
You get a mean crowd, pete.

93
00:05:28,463 --> 00:05:30,296
Get a hot night,
you get a mean crowd.

94
00:05:30,331 --> 00:05:31,547
I told you guys that.

95
00:05:32,181 --> 00:05:32,932
Every time you
get a hot night,

96
00:05:32,967 --> 00:05:34,801
you get a couple of
stiffs in the crowd

97
00:05:34,836 --> 00:05:36,052
and they swing it
all the wrong way.

98
00:05:36,087 --> 00:05:37,937
Remember when i was
telling you that, pete?

99
00:05:37,972 --> 00:05:39,439
Remember how i was telling you

100
00:05:39,474 --> 00:05:40,690
every time you
get a hot night...

101
00:05:40,725 --> 00:05:41,941
it's all right.

102
00:05:41,976 --> 00:05:43,192
It's done. It's done.

103
00:05:44,193 --> 00:05:46,696
Sure, pete, sure.

104
00:05:46,731 --> 00:05:49,198
Why?

105
00:05:49,233 --> 00:05:54,070
I tried so hard.

106
00:05:54,105 --> 00:05:57,824
I tried so hard
out there tonight, i...

107
00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:02,211
i couldn't...

108
00:06:02,246 --> 00:06:03,463
get through.

109
00:06:03,498 --> 00:06:07,834
I couldn't get through
to any of them.

110
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:10,970
I knew
what i had to say to them,

111
00:06:11,005 --> 00:06:14,090
i knew what i had to tell them,
and i just cou... i couldn't.

112
00:06:14,724 --> 00:06:17,226
I couldn't get it out.

113
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:19,846
I couldn't
find the words.

114
00:06:19,881 --> 00:06:22,982
Someday, they're going
to have to listen.

115
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:26,736
Someday they're going to cheer!

116
00:06:26,771 --> 00:06:27,987
Someday they will, pete.

117
00:06:28,022 --> 00:06:29,238
They will.

118
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:43,252
Portrait of a bush-league
fuhrer named peter vollmer.

119
00:06:43,287 --> 00:06:47,006
A sparse little man
who feeds off his self-delusions

120
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:49,509
and finds himself
perpetually hungry

121
00:06:49,544 --> 00:06:51,377
for want of greatness
in his diet.

122
00:06:51,412 --> 00:06:53,880
And like some goose-stepping
predecessors,

123
00:06:53,915 --> 00:06:57,016
he searches for something
to explain his hunger

124
00:06:57,051 --> 00:07:00,770
and rationalize why a world
passes him by without saluting.

125
00:07:00,805 --> 00:07:04,524
The something he looks for,
and finds, is in a sewer.

126
00:07:04,559 --> 00:07:07,026
In his own twisted,
distorted lexicon,

127
00:07:07,061 --> 00:07:09,529
he calls it
faith, strength, truth.

128
00:07:09,564 --> 00:07:11,397
But in just a moment
peter vollmer

129
00:07:11,432 --> 00:07:14,534
will ply his trade
on another kind of corner...

130
00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:17,653
a strange intersection
in a shadowland

131
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:19,539
called the twilight zone.

132
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:36,566
Wash your face.

133
00:08:58,721 --> 00:09:00,590
It's not a mortal wound.

134
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:03,092
I think you'll survive.

135
00:09:03,127 --> 00:09:05,595
When you get home,
put some iodine on it.

136
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:08,731
Want a cup of coffee?

137
00:09:08,766 --> 00:09:09,982
A drink?

138
00:09:10,017 --> 00:09:12,485
May i have a drink, ernst?

139
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,353
I have wine, you want some?

140
00:09:45,635 --> 00:09:47,520
Onesipswine, peter.

141
00:09:47,555 --> 00:09:48,771
This is not medicine.

142
00:09:48,806 --> 00:09:51,891
Well, i'll keep that
in mind for next time.

143
00:09:51,926 --> 00:09:53,142
For the next time?

144
00:09:53,177 --> 00:09:56,896
Just how many next times
do suppose a person has

145
00:09:56,931 --> 00:09:58,781
in the scheme of things?

146
00:09:58,816 --> 00:10:00,032
Don't lecture me, ernst.

147
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:01,901
I'm sick and tired,

148
00:10:01,936 --> 00:10:04,403
and i don't need
to be lectured.

149
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:19,168
Can i stay here tonight?

150
00:10:19,203 --> 00:10:22,305
It remains here
for you, as usual.

151
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:25,424
You're a good
friend, ernst.

152
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,927
You're a good friend.

153
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:31,430
A man does what he believes in.

154
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:33,566
A man usually does.

155
00:10:33,601 --> 00:10:35,434
Well, i believe
certain things.

156
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:37,320
Is that a fact?

157
00:10:37,355 --> 00:10:39,438
Yes, well,
what difference does it make

158
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:42,575
if we don't think alike
about the same things?

159
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:43,826
I mean, we're friends.

160
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:48,331
You've known me
since i was a kid.

161
00:10:49,617 --> 00:10:52,702
When you were
a little kid, peter,

162
00:10:52,737 --> 00:10:58,341
and i used to find you crying
at my door late at night...

163
00:10:58,376 --> 00:11:00,209
i could pity you then.

164
00:11:00,244 --> 00:11:02,094
And now?

165
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:03,963
What do
you think?

166
00:11:03,998 --> 00:11:06,716
Now you peddle hate
on street corners

167
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,218
as if it were popcorn.

168
00:11:09,253 --> 00:11:11,971
It's not hate,
it's, uh, a point of view,

169
00:11:12,006 --> 00:11:13,222
it's a philosophy.

170
00:11:13,257 --> 00:11:15,608
Ah, i know
the philosophy.

171
00:11:15,643 --> 00:11:18,728
I know it quite well.

172
00:11:18,763 --> 00:11:22,481
Nine years in a place
called dachau.

173
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:25,618
You know who
put me there?

174
00:11:25,653 --> 00:11:27,486
Peter vollmer.

175
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:29,989
A lot of peter vollmers.

176
00:11:30,024 --> 00:11:32,241
Frustrated men...

177
00:11:32,276 --> 00:11:33,492
sick men...

178
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:34,744
angry men.

179
00:11:34,779 --> 00:11:36,629
But the result,

180
00:11:36,664 --> 00:11:38,497
the effect-

181
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:41,634
never mind the cause-

182
00:11:41,669 --> 00:11:46,639
12 million bodies
in shallow graves.

183
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:50,893
And it all started

184
00:11:50,928 --> 00:11:55,014
with young men in uniform
talking on street corners.

185
00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:57,400
You let me come here.

186
00:11:57,435 --> 00:12:01,771
You let me come here;
you never sent me away.

187
00:12:01,806 --> 00:12:05,274
No, i never did.

188
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:08,411
I never do.

189
00:12:10,913 --> 00:12:14,667
That's the weakness you scream
about on your street corners.

190
00:12:15,284 --> 00:12:17,787
Sentimentality, softness,

191
00:12:17,822 --> 00:12:22,792
the weakness that makes a man
his brother's keeper.

192
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:27,296
Oh, i must be one
of the worst

193
00:12:27,331 --> 00:12:29,181
of your criminals,
peter.

194
00:12:29,216 --> 00:12:31,050
Sentimental...

195
00:12:31,085 --> 00:12:32,301
soft!

196
00:12:32,336 --> 00:12:36,689
And very preoccupied
with my brother.

197
00:12:40,443 --> 00:12:43,562
I should close the door on you.

198
00:12:44,814 --> 00:12:47,316
Perhaps... this is my sickness.

199
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:52,571
I... i only
see the boy...

200
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:54,457
not the man.

201
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:58,711
Sleep on the couch.

202
00:12:58,746 --> 00:13:01,831
Look... why don't
you understand?

203
00:13:02,465 --> 00:13:03,833
You're like a father.

204
00:13:03,868 --> 00:13:06,335
You're the only thing
in the world

205
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:07,586
that i've ever loved.

206
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:10,473
What have i ever had to love?

207
00:13:10,508 --> 00:13:12,341
What?

208
00:13:12,376 --> 00:13:16,095
A drunken father who used to
slam me against the wall?

209
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:17,980
An old lady...

210
00:13:18,015 --> 00:13:21,100
who had no marbles in her head?

211
00:13:21,135 --> 00:13:24,854
She didn't even recognize me
half the time.

212
00:13:24,889 --> 00:13:27,606
That's why i used
to come here, because...

213
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:30,109
because you were
gentle with me,

214
00:13:30,144 --> 00:13:31,994
and you'd talk to me,
you feed me.

215
00:13:32,029 --> 00:13:33,863
You took care of me.

216
00:13:35,498 --> 00:13:38,000
Ernst...

217
00:13:38,035 --> 00:13:39,869
ernst, you're my father.

218
00:13:42,371 --> 00:13:44,874
That's the boy again speaking.

219
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:51,764
A little boy
with so much fear in him.

220
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:55,518
Rest.

221
00:13:55,553 --> 00:13:58,020
Rest well.

222
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:33,172
Who's out there?

223
00:14:33,207 --> 00:14:35,057
Who is it?

224
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:37,560
A friend, mr. Vollmer.

225
00:14:37,595 --> 00:14:39,428
A friend?

226
00:14:39,463 --> 00:14:42,565
You have need
of friends, allies.

227
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,067
Come down,
mr. Vollmer.

228
00:14:45,102 --> 00:14:47,570
Come down, and we will talk,

229
00:14:47,605 --> 00:14:49,438
you and i.

230
00:14:55,077 --> 00:14:57,580
Hello, mr. Vollmer.

231
00:14:57,615 --> 00:15:00,082
Who are you?

232
00:15:00,117 --> 00:15:02,585
How did you know where i was?

233
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:06,956
I simply followed your tears,
mr. Vollmer.

234
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:11,210
You said that you had something
to talk about.

235
00:15:11,245 --> 00:15:13,095
I do, i do indeed.

236
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:16,849
I have you to talk about,
and the things you believe in,

237
00:15:16,884 --> 00:15:19,969
which are the things
i believe in, as well.

238
00:15:20,004 --> 00:15:23,722
Your success, mr. Vollmer,
will be my success.

239
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:25,608
Go on.

240
00:15:25,643 --> 00:15:26,859
Good.

241
00:15:26,894 --> 00:15:29,361
Let us start by your learning

242
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:31,864
what are the dynamics
of a crowd.

243
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:34,366
How do you move a mob,
mr. Vollmer?

244
00:15:34,401 --> 00:15:36,235
How do you excite them?

245
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:39,989
How do you make them feel
as one with you?

246
00:15:40,623 --> 00:15:42,491
L-i don't know. How?

247
00:15:42,526 --> 00:15:44,994
Join them first,
mr. Vollmer.

248
00:15:45,029 --> 00:15:46,245
Join them?

249
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,747
Yes, when you speak to them,

250
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:53,135
speak to them as if you
were a member of the mob.

251
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:56,889
Speak to them in their language,
on their level.

252
00:15:56,924 --> 00:15:59,391
Make their hateyourhate.

253
00:15:59,426 --> 00:16:03,762
If they are poor,
talk to them of poverty.

254
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:07,266
If they are afraid,
talk to them of their fears.

255
00:16:07,301 --> 00:16:10,402
And if they are angry,
mr. Vollmer,

256
00:16:10,437 --> 00:16:11,654
if they are angry,

257
00:16:11,689 --> 00:16:14,156
give them objects
for their anger.

258
00:16:14,191 --> 00:16:15,908
But most of all,

259
00:16:15,943 --> 00:16:19,662
the thing that is most
of the essence, mr. Vollmer,

260
00:16:19,697 --> 00:16:23,415
is that you make this mob
an extension of yourself.

261
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,919
Say to them things like...

262
00:16:26,954 --> 00:16:30,039
things like...

263
00:16:30,074 --> 00:16:32,541
"they call us hatemongers.

264
00:16:32,576 --> 00:16:35,044
"They say we're prejudiced.

265
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:36,929
"They say we're biased.

266
00:16:36,964 --> 00:16:41,300
"They say we hate
minorities- minorities.

267
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:43,802
"Understand
the term, neighbors:

268
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:46,305
"Minorities.

269
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:50,059
"Should i tell you
who are the minorities?

270
00:16:50,094 --> 00:16:51,310
"Should i tell you?

271
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:53,812
"We...!

272
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:56,315
Wearethe minorities!"

273
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,069
That way, mr. Vollmer.

274
00:17:00,104 --> 00:17:03,205
Start it that way.

275
00:17:05,574 --> 00:17:08,077
I... understand.

276
00:17:08,112 --> 00:17:10,579
I think i understand.

277
00:17:13,716 --> 00:17:15,584
Neighbors...

278
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:19,338
neighbors.

279
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,726
They call us...

280
00:17:23,761 --> 00:17:25,594
hatemongers.

281
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:29,982
They say...

282
00:17:30,017 --> 00:17:31,850
weare prejudiced.

283
00:17:33,736 --> 00:17:36,238
They say...

284
00:17:36,273 --> 00:17:38,107
weare biased!

285
00:17:38,142 --> 00:17:43,746
They say
that we hate the minorities!

286
00:17:43,781 --> 00:17:46,865
The minorities.

287
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,002
Understand the term, neighbors.

288
00:17:50,037 --> 00:17:52,504
The minorities.

289
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:56,875
Shall i tell you
who the minorities are?!

290
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:59,378
We, we, we...!

291
00:17:59,413 --> 00:18:02,514
Wearethe minorities!

292
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:07,136
Because patriotism...

293
00:18:07,171 --> 00:18:09,021
is a minority.

294
00:18:09,056 --> 00:18:12,391
Because love of country...

295
00:18:12,426 --> 00:18:14,893
is the minority.

296
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:19,898
Because to live
in a free, white america

297
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:23,652
seems to be
of a minority opinion!

298
00:18:23,687 --> 00:18:26,155
Let me tell you something,
neighbors.

299
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,657
I want you to dwell on this,

300
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:30,542
just dwell on it.

301
00:18:32,294 --> 00:18:36,665
We had the atom bomb,

302
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,802
and suddenly...

303
00:18:39,837 --> 00:18:42,304
the russians had it.

304
00:18:43,672 --> 00:18:46,809
We wanted
to send men into space!

305
00:18:48,677 --> 00:18:52,431
But it was the russians
who got there first!

306
00:18:53,682 --> 00:18:56,819
We had the hydrogen bomb!

307
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:04,326
It was the russians
who exploded theirs.

308
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:08,080
Who gave them the bombs?

309
00:19:08,115 --> 00:19:09,331
Who sold us out?

310
00:19:09,366 --> 00:19:11,834
Who stabbed us in the back?

311
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:14,953
Well...

312
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:18,090
if it's a minority opinion

313
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:21,210
that we have to survive,

314
00:19:21,245 --> 00:19:25,597
then we are the minority.

315
00:19:25,632 --> 00:19:28,100
And this minority

316
00:19:28,135 --> 00:19:29,968
will not stop

317
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:33,105
until it is the majority!

318
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:37,476
This minority
will not give up the fight!

319
00:19:37,511 --> 00:19:41,230
This... is the promise

320
00:19:41,265 --> 00:19:43,115
and this...

321
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:44,983
this is the legacy!

322
00:20:02,718 --> 00:20:05,220
Pal, we're in
there now, huh?

323
00:20:05,255 --> 00:20:07,089
No more street corners?

324
00:20:07,124 --> 00:20:10,225
Oh, boy, are we
going now, huh?

325
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,476
Congratulations.

326
00:20:11,511 --> 00:20:12,094
Congratulations.
Thanks.

327
00:20:12,129 --> 00:20:13,845
Nice speech.

328
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,097
Thank you.

329
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:18,850
Look, i'm not going
to wait much longer.

330
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:20,102
If i don't get paid,

331
00:20:20,137 --> 00:20:23,238
you don't have the hall
tomorrow night.

332
00:20:23,273 --> 00:20:25,107
Gibbons, will
you cool it?

333
00:20:25,142 --> 00:20:26,358
Can't you see
we're busy?

334
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:27,609
I'm not waiting

335
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:29,494
not another
five minutes!

336
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:30,746
I want it settled now.

337
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:33,248
I told you, no dough,
no rental.

338
00:20:33,283 --> 00:20:35,751
No dough, no hall
tomorrow night.

339
00:20:35,786 --> 00:20:38,370
I'm not running this
place for pleasure.

340
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:40,255
What seems to be the problem?

341
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:42,374
This is a very
hungry man here.

342
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:44,259
He got to have
his shekels,

343
00:20:44,294 --> 00:20:45,510
his little old money.

344
00:20:45,545 --> 00:20:46,762
I told you guys

345
00:20:46,797 --> 00:20:48,630
you're three weeks
back in the rent.

346
00:20:48,665 --> 00:20:51,133
You said you'd
give me it a week ago.

347
00:20:51,168 --> 00:20:54,269
All i got was cigarette
butts on the floor.

348
00:20:54,304 --> 00:20:57,773
Am i to understand
you're going to lock us out

349
00:20:57,808 --> 00:20:59,024
for a couple weeks' rent?

350
00:20:59,059 --> 00:21:01,526
You understand right.

351
00:21:01,561 --> 00:21:04,646
$200 due,
$200 that i ain't received.

352
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,400
We happen to be
a young movement.

353
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:10,285
We're still struggling.

354
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,154
We need time to grow.

355
00:21:12,788 --> 00:21:14,656
But i don't rent time-

356
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:16,541
i just rent the hall.

357
00:21:16,576 --> 00:21:18,410
It's the money

358
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:21,546
or you build a platform
in the street.

359
00:21:31,173 --> 00:21:33,058
Whew.

360
00:21:33,093 --> 00:21:34,926
What are we
going to do, pete?

361
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:36,178
We got to do something.

362
00:21:36,213 --> 00:21:39,314
I don't see why we walk
tiptoe with this guy.

363
00:21:39,349 --> 00:21:41,183
Why don't
i educate him?

364
00:21:41,218 --> 00:21:43,068
I can,
i guarantee it.

365
00:21:43,103 --> 00:21:44,936
Somebody left
this for you.

366
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:46,188
Who?

367
00:21:46,223 --> 00:21:47,439
Nobody saw him.

368
00:21:47,939 --> 00:21:49,825
It was left
at the back door

369
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:50,442
with your name.

370
00:21:50,477 --> 00:21:51,693
Two c's!

371
00:21:52,194 --> 00:21:54,079
Hey, how about
that, huh?

372
00:21:54,114 --> 00:21:55,947
We needed
200 bucks' rent,

373
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:57,833
and there it is!

374
00:21:57,868 --> 00:21:59,701
Did you see
who left this?

375
00:21:59,736 --> 00:22:00,952
No, i didn't.

376
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:04,706
The message was just
for you to get it.

377
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:07,209
Gibbons,
come and get it.

378
00:22:34,369 --> 00:22:36,238
Where'd the dough
come from, pete?

379
00:22:36,273 --> 00:22:37,489
You have any idea?

380
00:22:37,524 --> 00:22:41,243
You were great tonight,
pete.

381
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:43,745
You were
really something.

382
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:46,882
I can't describe
how it sounded.

383
00:22:46,917 --> 00:22:49,384
You had them...

384
00:22:49,419 --> 00:22:51,887
just like that,
you had them.

385
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:56,391
We're going
to make it now, frank.

386
00:23:02,647 --> 00:23:05,767
Now we'rereally
going to make it.

387
00:23:05,901 --> 00:23:09,020
You bet your life.

388
00:23:30,292 --> 00:23:32,177
An excellent performance,
mr. Vollmer.

389
00:23:32,212 --> 00:23:34,045
Very effective.

390
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,931
You learn quickly.

391
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:38,433
Thank you.

392
00:23:38,468 --> 00:23:41,553
I'd like to know
who i'm thanking.

393
00:23:41,588 --> 00:23:44,439
It does not make
very much difference.

394
00:23:44,474 --> 00:23:46,942
I am just pleased i could help.

395
00:23:46,977 --> 00:23:48,810
You learned the style very well.

396
00:23:48,845 --> 00:23:51,947
You delivered the speech
exactly as i told you.

397
00:23:51,982 --> 00:23:54,316
I'm very obliged.

398
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:56,818
The money?

399
00:23:56,853 --> 00:23:59,070
Oh, it was the least i could do.

400
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:02,824
We could not very well have you
thrown out into the streets.

401
00:24:02,859 --> 00:24:05,961
I happen to feel your work
is very important.

402
00:24:05,996 --> 00:24:07,829
Are you one of us?

403
00:24:08,463 --> 00:24:09,714
One ofyou,
mr. Vollmer?

404
00:24:09,749 --> 00:24:12,217
You might say
iamyou.

405
00:24:12,252 --> 00:24:14,469
Now, i have some suggestions.

406
00:24:14,504 --> 00:24:16,972
I will continue
to give you advice.

407
00:24:17,007 --> 00:24:20,725
But there is a matter
of great importance

408
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,594
that must be taken care of.

409
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:25,347
What is it?

410
00:24:25,382 --> 00:24:27,232
An expedient,
mr. Vollmer.

411
00:24:27,267 --> 00:24:29,734
Oh, you might
call it a, uh...

412
00:24:29,769 --> 00:24:30,986
acause celebre.

413
00:24:31,021 --> 00:24:35,991
Something to cement
the organization together.

414
00:24:36,026 --> 00:24:37,492
I don't understand.

415
00:24:37,527 --> 00:24:39,361
A martyr.

416
00:24:39,396 --> 00:24:41,997
The organization needs a martyr.

417
00:24:42,032 --> 00:24:44,499
How do you find a martyr?

418
00:24:44,534 --> 00:24:47,252
You do not find one,
mr. Vollmer.

419
00:24:47,287 --> 00:24:48,503
You choose one.

420
00:24:48,538 --> 00:24:51,006
You take one of no value,

421
00:24:51,041 --> 00:24:53,508
and you make him into a symbol.

422
00:24:53,543 --> 00:24:55,760
You wrap him
in a flag,

423
00:24:55,795 --> 00:24:58,880
and you make
his death work
for you.

424
00:24:58,915 --> 00:25:01,383
Find a man
who is of no value

425
00:25:01,418 --> 00:25:03,268
while he's alive

426
00:25:03,303 --> 00:25:06,388
but who can serve you
when he's dead.

427
00:25:06,423 --> 00:25:07,889
Is there such a one?

428
00:25:10,892 --> 00:25:12,777
We're waiting,
pete.

429
00:25:12,812 --> 00:25:14,646
I'll be right
there, nick.

430
00:25:14,681 --> 00:25:17,148
Sure, pete.

431
00:25:19,901 --> 00:25:21,786
You talking to
somebody, pete?

432
00:25:23,405 --> 00:25:25,907
You tell frank to come in here.

433
00:25:25,942 --> 00:25:28,410
Alone.

434
00:25:28,445 --> 00:25:30,295
Sure thing, pete.

435
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:31,546
Right away.

436
00:25:35,917 --> 00:25:37,552
Excellent, mr. Vollmer.

437
00:25:37,587 --> 00:25:39,421
An excellent choice.

438
00:25:40,805 --> 00:25:43,308
I was just thinking...

439
00:25:43,343 --> 00:25:46,428
there must be some other way.

440
00:25:46,463 --> 00:25:47,679
Another way?

441
00:25:47,714 --> 00:25:50,181
There is no other
way, mr. Vollmer.

442
00:25:50,216 --> 00:25:52,317
And if you soften up,

443
00:25:52,352 --> 00:25:54,185
if you weaken now,

444
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:57,322
there is no point in going on.

445
00:25:57,357 --> 00:25:58,573
Now...

446
00:25:58,608 --> 00:26:00,191
when frank
comes back,

447
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:03,328
tell him you have
discovered an informer.

448
00:26:03,363 --> 00:26:05,196
Tell him the informer

449
00:26:05,231 --> 00:26:07,699
has done you
irreparable damage.

450
00:26:07,734 --> 00:26:09,584
Tell him
the informer

451
00:26:09,619 --> 00:26:11,453
must be put
out of the way.

452
00:26:11,488 --> 00:26:15,090
But... put out of the way
cleverly, mr. Vollmer.

453
00:26:15,125 --> 00:26:17,592
Put out of the way subtly.

454
00:26:17,627 --> 00:26:19,461
Put out of the way

455
00:26:19,496 --> 00:26:24,466
so that there is some question
as to who is responsible.

456
00:26:26,601 --> 00:26:29,721
Nick's, uh, been with us
from the beginning.

457
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:31,606
From the beginning?

458
00:26:31,641 --> 00:26:33,475
Oh, no, mr. Vollmer.

459
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:35,977
None of you were there
at the beginning.

460
00:26:36,012 --> 00:26:37,228
None of you.

461
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:39,731
Nick's a friend of mine.

462
00:26:40,615 --> 00:26:43,118
This is an act of friendship.

463
00:26:43,153 --> 00:26:46,237
We are allowing him
to serve the cause.

464
00:26:48,775 --> 00:26:51,876
Nick said you
wanted to see me.

465
00:26:51,911 --> 00:26:55,630
We've got a stoolie
in the group, frank.

466
00:26:55,665 --> 00:26:57,499
A stoolie?

467
00:26:57,534 --> 00:27:00,001
Nick.

468
00:27:00,036 --> 00:27:01,886
Nick's been talking.

469
00:27:01,921 --> 00:27:04,389
I think he's been hired
by the police.

470
00:27:05,006 --> 00:27:06,891
Nick?! Nick
has done that?

471
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:10,261
I know it for a fact.

472
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:13,398
Everything we've done
and everything we've said...

473
00:27:13,433 --> 00:27:14,649
nick's told.

474
00:27:15,266 --> 00:27:17,152
What do we do, pete?

475
00:27:17,187 --> 00:27:18,403
Get rid of him.

476
00:27:18,438 --> 00:27:21,523
Make it look
like somebody else did it.

477
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:25,276
Make it look like somebody
who hates us did it.

478
00:27:26,528 --> 00:27:28,413
I understand.

479
00:27:28,448 --> 00:27:30,281
I understand, pete.

480
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:32,167
You call it...

481
00:27:32,202 --> 00:27:34,035
you've got it.

482
00:28:17,579 --> 00:28:20,081
Cross off the fat one.

483
00:28:20,715 --> 00:28:23,218
Anything else?

484
00:28:23,253 --> 00:28:25,720
Right.

485
00:28:41,986 --> 00:28:46,357
We now, all of us,
have a martyr.

486
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:53,865
We have a martyr!

487
00:29:05,593 --> 00:29:10,465
Twilight zonewill continue
after station identification.

488
00:29:44,966 --> 00:29:46,835
It's a good crowd.

489
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:48,720
Right up to
the ceiling.

490
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:52,474
What's the matter,
stanley?

491
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:55,593
Nothing, pete.

492
00:29:55,628 --> 00:29:57,479
Then why the look?

493
00:29:57,514 --> 00:30:00,598
It's nothing,
it's nothing at all.

494
00:30:00,633 --> 00:30:02,233
You can tell me,
stanley.

495
00:30:02,268 --> 00:30:03,485
What's the matter?

496
00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:07,105
Nick was my friend, pete.

497
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,990
He was a nice guy.

498
00:30:09,025 --> 00:30:10,492
I miss him.

499
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:12,360
Do you want me

500
00:30:12,395 --> 00:30:16,114
to really tell you
what nick was, stanley?

501
00:30:17,365 --> 00:30:19,868
Would you really like
a rundown?

502
00:30:19,903 --> 00:30:22,120
He was a fat pig!

503
00:30:23,371 --> 00:30:25,256
With no guts.

504
00:30:25,291 --> 00:30:28,009
He was a greasy bigmouth

505
00:30:28,044 --> 00:30:30,512
who copped out
at every turn.

506
00:30:30,547 --> 00:30:33,014
He was a nickel-and-dime
judas,

507
00:30:33,049 --> 00:30:35,517
and he got exactly
what he deserved.

508
00:30:35,552 --> 00:30:38,636
So don't mourn
for nick, stanley.

509
00:30:38,671 --> 00:30:41,139
Because he doesn't
rate mourning-

510
00:30:41,174 --> 00:30:43,525
not that pig.

511
00:31:07,665 --> 00:31:13,171
A man of honor died last week.

512
00:31:13,206 --> 00:31:17,559
A decent, courageous fighter

513
00:31:17,594 --> 00:31:21,312
for the cause of freedom

514
00:31:21,347 --> 00:31:23,181
gave his life.

515
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:26,434
He gave his life for us!

516
00:31:27,685 --> 00:31:31,573
Some skulking... assassin

517
00:31:31,608 --> 00:31:33,441
murdered him!

518
00:31:35,326 --> 00:31:37,195
But friends,

519
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:39,080
and neighbors,

520
00:31:39,115 --> 00:31:40,949
and co-fighters...

521
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,954
...nick bloss
did not die in vain.

522
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:50,341
They stilled his great heart...

523
00:31:52,594 --> 00:31:56,347
...but they could not
stifle his memory.

524
00:31:57,715 --> 00:32:00,218
They could not...

525
00:32:00,253 --> 00:32:02,103
obliterate his courage.

526
00:32:03,354 --> 00:32:05,857
They could not...

527
00:32:05,892 --> 00:32:08,977
wipe away his honor.

528
00:32:09,012 --> 00:32:10,862
He lives in you,

529
00:32:10,897 --> 00:32:13,364
and he lives in me.

530
00:32:14,232 --> 00:32:16,734
He lives deep in the gut

531
00:32:16,769 --> 00:32:18,620
of every human being

532
00:32:18,655 --> 00:32:19,621
who wants to see

533
00:32:19,656 --> 00:32:22,740
the united states of america
be free.

534
00:32:23,491 --> 00:32:25,376
Nick bloss

535
00:32:25,411 --> 00:32:27,245
died for this.

536
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:33,501
And you and i...

537
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:36,638
we must live for this!

538
00:32:41,427 --> 00:32:45,763
...and letsomebody else
concern themselves

539
00:32:45,798 --> 00:32:47,649
with the lifeblood
of a nation...

540
00:32:47,684 --> 00:32:51,519
he's got a
voice on him.

541
00:32:51,554 --> 00:32:55,907
I knew it
when it was just a whimper.

542
00:32:55,942 --> 00:32:57,775
That's a bad
kid, that one.

543
00:32:57,810 --> 00:33:02,163
Used to be... used to be
people would laugh at him.

544
00:33:02,198 --> 00:33:04,666
But lately, he
gets the crowds,

545
00:33:04,701 --> 00:33:07,168
and not many people
laugh either.

546
00:33:07,203 --> 00:33:09,671
You've know him a long
time, haven't you?

547
00:33:09,706 --> 00:33:12,790
Since he was a child.

548
00:33:12,825 --> 00:33:15,293
A silent, little boy
with very little to say.

549
00:33:15,328 --> 00:33:19,681
(vollmer continues orating
in background

550
00:33:19,716 --> 00:33:22,684
we're overdue to cut away
the cancerous...

551
00:33:22,719 --> 00:33:25,687
i've seen it before.

552
00:33:25,722 --> 00:33:28,806
I've seen it all before.

553
00:33:28,841 --> 00:33:31,943
That was another time, mr. Ganz.

554
00:33:31,978 --> 00:33:35,063
Another place,
another kind of people.

555
00:33:35,098 --> 00:33:37,565
That doesn't
go here.

556
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:42,570
That's what we said, too,
they were brown scum.

557
00:33:42,605 --> 00:33:46,958
Temporary insanity,
part of the passing scene...

558
00:33:46,993 --> 00:33:49,460
too monstrous to be real.

559
00:33:50,712 --> 00:33:53,831
So, we ignored them

560
00:33:53,866 --> 00:33:56,334
or laughed at them.

561
00:33:56,369 --> 00:33:58,219
Because we
couldn'tbelieve

562
00:33:58,254 --> 00:34:00,722
that there were enough
insane people

563
00:34:00,757 --> 00:34:02,590
to walk alongside
of them.

564
00:34:07,013 --> 00:34:08,846
And then one morning,

565
00:34:08,881 --> 00:34:12,600
the country woke up
from an uneasy sleep...

566
00:34:12,635 --> 00:34:15,103
(vollmer continues orating
in background

567
00:34:15,737 --> 00:34:18,856
...and there
was no more laughter.

568
00:34:19,857 --> 00:34:22,360
The peter vollmers
had taken over.

569
00:34:22,395 --> 00:34:23,611
The wild animals

570
00:34:23,646 --> 00:34:26,748
had changed places
with us in the cage.

571
00:34:26,783 --> 00:34:30,501
This nation of ours
is being beaten to death!

572
00:34:30,536 --> 00:34:33,621
Just as sure
as the almighty

573
00:34:33,656 --> 00:34:36,758
made communists,
catholics, and jews.

574
00:34:36,793 --> 00:34:39,510
There's no time to stand around,

575
00:34:39,545 --> 00:34:41,879
scratch our heads,
and pull our beards,

576
00:34:41,914 --> 00:34:43,131
and twiddle
with our earlobes...

577
00:34:43,166 --> 00:34:45,016
but not again.

578
00:34:45,051 --> 00:34:48,770
It mustn't happen again.

579
00:34:48,805 --> 00:34:51,272
We can't let it.

580
00:34:51,307 --> 00:34:54,892
We simply can't
let it happen again.

581
00:34:56,144 --> 00:34:58,646
All, all that nightmare.

582
00:34:58,681 --> 00:35:03,034
...violence happens to be
the only way to be violent...

583
00:35:03,069 --> 00:35:04,902
oh, no...

584
00:35:04,937 --> 00:35:07,405
no, not this time.

585
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,541
...we do not want
to be pushed.

586
00:35:11,793 --> 00:35:14,412
Now, i want to ask you
a few questions.

587
00:35:14,447 --> 00:35:18,166
You just answer yes or no
to the following.

588
00:35:18,201 --> 00:35:19,417
Do you want...

589
00:35:19,452 --> 00:35:23,805
the united states of america
to remain free?

590
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,174
Yes!

591
00:35:26,209 --> 00:35:30,428
Do you want your homes infected

592
00:35:30,463 --> 00:35:34,182
with the vermin
from foreign shores?

593
00:35:34,217 --> 00:35:36,567
No!

594
00:35:36,602 --> 00:35:38,820
Now, listen to this one.

595
00:35:40,688 --> 00:35:44,442
Do you want
a bunch of mongrels

596
00:35:44,477 --> 00:35:46,694
to come over here...

597
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:52,950
go on, mr. Vollmer.

598
00:35:52,985 --> 00:35:56,087
You were saying?

599
00:35:56,122 --> 00:35:59,841
I can tell them
what you were saying.

600
00:35:59,876 --> 00:36:02,960
I've heard it before.

601
00:36:02,995 --> 00:36:06,097
I've heard it
a thousand times before...

602
00:36:06,132 --> 00:36:08,599
in munich, in berlin...

603
00:36:09,217 --> 00:36:11,719
on a hundred different
street corners.

604
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:15,106
It was
drivel then,

605
00:36:15,141 --> 00:36:16,974
and it is
drivel now.

606
00:36:17,009 --> 00:36:19,477
You've got to stop, ernst.

607
00:36:19,512 --> 00:36:21,362
Well, what is this one here?

608
00:36:21,397 --> 00:36:22,613
The new model?

609
00:36:22,648 --> 00:36:25,733
A 1963 fuhrer
right off the assembly line?

610
00:36:25,768 --> 00:36:28,236
Well, this one is not so new.

611
00:36:28,271 --> 00:36:30,121
He's not so fresh.

612
00:36:30,156 --> 00:36:33,491
This one is nothing
but a cheap copy!

613
00:36:33,526 --> 00:36:35,626
Peter, we've got
to do something.

614
00:36:35,661 --> 00:36:37,495
We're losing the audience.

615
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:38,746
Let me get rid of him.

616
00:36:38,781 --> 00:36:39,997
Just leave me alone.

617
00:36:40,032 --> 00:36:42,500
Well, let me tell you
about this one.

618
00:36:42,535 --> 00:36:46,888
About the breed, the species.

619
00:36:46,923 --> 00:36:48,756
They're all alike,

620
00:36:48,791 --> 00:36:50,641
they are all alike.

621
00:36:50,676 --> 00:36:52,510
Problem children...

622
00:36:52,545 --> 00:36:55,012
sick, sad, neurotics,

623
00:36:55,047 --> 00:36:59,400
who take applause like a needle.

624
00:36:59,435 --> 00:37:01,519
That's enough, ernst.

625
00:37:01,554 --> 00:37:02,770
Please...

626
00:37:02,805 --> 00:37:04,021
please?

627
00:37:05,273 --> 00:37:07,658
Listen to me, peter,

628
00:37:07,693 --> 00:37:10,778
and let them listen.

629
00:37:10,813 --> 00:37:12,663
Or else
i'll tell them

630
00:37:12,698 --> 00:37:14,532
about a quaking,
whimpering boy

631
00:37:14,567 --> 00:37:17,034
who cried on my couch;

632
00:37:17,069 --> 00:37:18,920
who still
cries on my couch.

633
00:37:18,955 --> 00:37:20,788
Please don't,
please, ernst.

634
00:37:20,823 --> 00:37:23,291
Pete, don't let him do this.

635
00:37:23,326 --> 00:37:24,542
Put him down.

636
00:37:24,577 --> 00:37:26,427
Yeah, put me down,
put me down.

637
00:37:26,462 --> 00:37:27,678
Shut me up.

638
00:37:27,713 --> 00:37:30,181
Stifle me- why don't you?

639
00:37:30,216 --> 00:37:32,049
Why can't you?

640
00:37:33,935 --> 00:37:35,803
Because this
is your courage

641
00:37:35,838 --> 00:37:37,688
right here.

642
00:37:37,723 --> 00:37:40,191
This is your strength.

643
00:37:40,226 --> 00:37:41,442
This...

644
00:37:41,477 --> 00:37:43,311
and the torchlights,

645
00:37:43,945 --> 00:37:45,196
and the crowd,

646
00:37:45,231 --> 00:37:47,698
and thesieg heil!

647
00:37:54,822 --> 00:37:58,576
The rebuttal.

648
00:37:58,611 --> 00:38:03,581
The only sort of answer
your kind knows how to give.

649
00:38:07,969 --> 00:38:11,722
This is your fuhrer.

650
00:38:11,757 --> 00:38:14,842
He's yours.

651
00:38:14,877 --> 00:38:18,596
I give him to you.

652
00:38:18,631 --> 00:38:21,732
A gift from the sewers.

653
00:38:46,123 --> 00:38:49,260
Mr. Vollmer.

654
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:07,395
You see... the way it is?

655
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:08,646
I knew him.

656
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,782
I knew the old man.

657
00:39:11,817 --> 00:39:16,787
Is that a fact,
mr. Vollmer?

658
00:39:16,822 --> 00:39:21,792
For such a long time.

659
00:39:21,827 --> 00:39:27,915
I've known him for so long.

660
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:29,800
He cheapened you, mr. Vollmer.

661
00:39:29,835 --> 00:39:31,669
He tore you to pieces!

662
00:39:31,704 --> 00:39:34,171
Your voice is that of a lion,

663
00:39:34,206 --> 00:39:37,308
your instincts
are those of a rabbit.

664
00:39:37,343 --> 00:39:38,809
And you-

665
00:39:38,844 --> 00:39:40,061
what are you?!

666
00:39:40,096 --> 00:39:42,563
You direct traffic
from the darkness!

667
00:39:42,598 --> 00:39:44,432
You plan the battles,

668
00:39:44,467 --> 00:39:46,934
and you're never there
when they're fought!

669
00:39:47,568 --> 00:39:50,688
Why don't you come out
in the light?

670
00:39:50,723 --> 00:39:54,442
Why don't you come up here
alongside of me?

671
00:39:54,477 --> 00:39:57,194
Why don't you give me a name...

672
00:39:57,229 --> 00:39:59,080
and a face...

673
00:39:59,115 --> 00:40:00,948
and a reason why?

674
00:40:00,983 --> 00:40:02,833
Mr. Vollmer.

675
00:40:02,868 --> 00:40:07,204
I was making speeches
before you could read them.

676
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:09,090
I was fighting battles

677
00:40:09,125 --> 00:40:12,843
when your only struggle
was to climb out of a womb.

678
00:40:12,878 --> 00:40:18,466
I was taking over the world
when your universe was a crib!

679
00:40:18,501 --> 00:40:22,219
And as for being in darkness,
mr. Vollmer,

680
00:40:22,254 --> 00:40:24,722
i invented darkness!

681
00:41:17,459 --> 00:41:19,927
You... you picked me.

682
00:41:21,178 --> 00:41:23,063
You picked me.

683
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:28,068
I did not pick you, mr. Vollmer.

684
00:41:28,103 --> 00:41:29,320
You picked me.

685
00:41:29,355 --> 00:41:30,571
You chose my ideas,

686
00:41:31,188 --> 00:41:32,439
you invoked my name,

687
00:41:32,474 --> 00:41:34,325
you stole my slogans.

688
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,193
So now, you must take

689
00:41:36,228 --> 00:41:38,078
whatever else
comes with it.

690
00:41:38,113 --> 00:41:39,830
In the past,

691
00:41:39,865 --> 00:41:41,699
i have given you
suggestions.

692
00:41:41,734 --> 00:41:44,201
Now i give orders!

693
00:41:44,236 --> 00:41:48,088
And from now on,
you must be built of steel.

694
00:41:48,123 --> 00:41:49,957
Steel, mr. Vollmer.

695
00:41:49,992 --> 00:41:52,459
No soft gaps of sentiment.

696
00:41:52,494 --> 00:41:54,345
Like we handled nick.

697
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:56,847
Like we handled the mobs.

698
00:41:56,882 --> 00:41:59,350
Like we made the speeches.

699
00:41:59,385 --> 00:42:01,852
And bit by bit, gradually,

700
00:42:01,887 --> 00:42:04,355
we shall forge a force-

701
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:06,857
first an idea, then a force.

702
00:42:06,892 --> 00:42:10,611
Just as i did it before,
mr. Vollmer,

703
00:42:10,646 --> 00:42:14,365
with my own hands!

704
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:20,237
The old man, the jew,

705
00:42:20,272 --> 00:42:23,374
he'll be back again,
tomorrow night, the next night.

706
00:42:23,409 --> 00:42:25,242
I know him, i know the type.

707
00:42:25,277 --> 00:42:27,127
We sent them into the ovens,
but always,

708
00:42:27,745 --> 00:42:29,630
there was a handful left
to point a finger.

709
00:42:30,247 --> 00:42:32,132
His kind, mr. Vollmer,

710
00:42:32,167 --> 00:42:34,635
his kind are dangerous.

711
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:39,006
They talk, they think,
they plant a seed.

712
00:42:39,041 --> 00:42:40,891
They hold us back!

713
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:45,646
Kill him!

714
00:42:45,681 --> 00:42:47,514
Kill the old man!

715
00:42:50,017 --> 00:42:51,268
Kill him?

716
00:42:51,303 --> 00:42:52,519
Kill ernst?

717
00:42:52,554 --> 00:42:55,022
Yes, tonight. Now.

718
00:42:55,057 --> 00:42:56,907
He'll be
in his room.

719
00:42:56,942 --> 00:43:00,027
All right, i'll do it.

720
00:43:00,062 --> 00:43:01,912
I'll do it right now.

721
00:43:09,169 --> 00:43:11,672
And mr. Vollmer...

722
00:43:11,707 --> 00:43:13,290
when you come back,

723
00:43:13,325 --> 00:43:16,427
we will have much
to talk about.

724
00:43:16,462 --> 00:43:18,295
Plans,
campaigns, ideas-

725
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:20,180
the first steps.

726
00:43:20,215 --> 00:43:22,933
This is only the beginning,
mr. Vollmer.

727
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:26,053
This is just the dawn.

728
00:43:26,088 --> 00:43:30,441
It will be a long, long day!

729
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:40,951
You wouldn't listen to me,
ernst.

730
00:43:40,986 --> 00:43:42,202
You wouldn't pay attention.

731
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:43,570
On the contrary.

732
00:43:43,605 --> 00:43:46,707
I listened to you
all i could stand.

733
00:43:47,324 --> 00:43:51,211
I couldn't even begin to tell
you what's happened, ernst.

734
00:43:51,246 --> 00:43:53,714
It's too incredible,
too unbelievable.

735
00:43:53,749 --> 00:43:55,582
There's no stopping us now.

736
00:43:55,617 --> 00:43:58,218
No stopping you, peter.

737
00:43:58,253 --> 00:44:01,972
An old man stopped you tonight,
with a few words.

738
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:05,726
He stopped you with the truth.

739
00:44:05,761 --> 00:44:07,845
No, you're wrong, ernst.

740
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,730
It's not just me anymore.

741
00:44:10,347 --> 00:44:12,850
There's someone else behind us.

742
00:44:12,885 --> 00:44:15,352
Someone that you'd tremble at.

743
00:44:15,387 --> 00:44:19,106
He'd have to be
a very imposing figure, peter.

744
00:44:19,141 --> 00:44:20,991
More imposing than you.

745
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:33,253
More imposing
than that, too, peter.

746
00:44:33,288 --> 00:44:35,756
Only because you don't think
i'll use it.

747
00:44:35,791 --> 00:44:39,510
Which shows you don't know me
very well, ernst.

748
00:44:39,545 --> 00:44:42,012
I know you, peter.

749
00:44:42,047 --> 00:44:44,515
I know you.

750
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:48,886
From a ravaged little boy
wanting love...

751
00:44:48,921 --> 00:44:50,771
to a torn man

752
00:44:50,806 --> 00:44:55,776
craving respect,
identity, pride.

753
00:44:58,896 --> 00:45:02,032
Peter... i don't fear you,

754
00:45:02,067 --> 00:45:05,786
so you may do
what you have in mind

755
00:45:05,821 --> 00:45:06,653
at any time you wish.

756
00:45:07,287 --> 00:45:11,158
But this last one reminder
to you.

757
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:16,797
You can never kill an idea
with a bullet, peter.

758
00:45:16,832 --> 00:45:18,665
Never.

759
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,419
I'm all steel now.

760
00:45:24,922 --> 00:45:27,424
Ernst, i'm made of steel.

761
00:45:27,459 --> 00:45:31,178
No sentiment, no softness.

762
00:45:31,213 --> 00:45:33,063
Just purpose and will.

763
00:45:33,098 --> 00:45:36,183
Then shoot.

764
00:45:36,218 --> 00:45:37,434
Kill.

765
00:45:37,469 --> 00:45:39,319
Destroy me.

766
00:45:52,868 --> 00:45:55,953
All steel...

767
00:45:55,988 --> 00:45:59,706
all strength.

768
00:45:59,741 --> 00:46:04,711
But at the expense of the thing
most other men have.

769
00:46:04,746 --> 00:46:10,350
Some... fragments
of decency

770
00:46:10,385 --> 00:46:13,470
to tell them
right from wrong...

771
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:21,612
make them feel guilt
at dishonor...

772
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:25,983
that make them...

773
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:29,736
...that make them love.

774
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:36,627
Yes, peter...

775
00:46:36,662 --> 00:46:38,495
you have steel...

776
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:43,383
...but you have no heart.

777
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,171
Mr. Vollmer!

778
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:25,425
Sentimentality?

779
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:35,185
None.

780
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:37,054
Steel tonight?

781
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:39,556
Steel.

782
00:47:39,591 --> 00:47:41,441
And no regrets?

783
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:43,944
None.

784
00:47:43,979 --> 00:47:46,446
What did you destroy tonight?

785
00:47:46,481 --> 00:47:48,315
Only a disease.

786
00:47:48,350 --> 00:47:52,703
A growth that was on our flesh
that had to be removed.

787
00:47:52,738 --> 00:47:54,571
Not a man?

788
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:57,074
No, hardly a man.

789
00:47:58,325 --> 00:48:00,210
How did it feel?

790
00:48:10,337 --> 00:48:12,839
It felt...

791
00:48:14,091 --> 00:48:16,593
it felt like i was immortal.

792
00:48:16,628 --> 00:48:18,478
Mr. Vollmer!

793
00:48:18,513 --> 00:48:20,981
Weareimmortal!

794
00:48:24,101 --> 00:48:25,736
You peter vollmer?

795
00:48:26,353 --> 00:48:28,855
We have a warrant
for your arrest.

796
00:48:28,890 --> 00:48:31,992
Charge is complicity
in murder.

797
00:48:32,027 --> 00:48:34,494
Victim's name
was nicholas bloss.

798
00:48:34,529 --> 00:48:36,997
That should be
familiar to you.

799
00:48:37,032 --> 00:48:38,248
Throw that gun away.

800
00:48:38,283 --> 00:48:40,751
Walk toward us
with your hands up.

801
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:20,040
There's something
very wrong here.

802
00:49:20,657 --> 00:49:22,542
You've made a terrible mistake.

803
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:28,165
I'm made out of steel.

804
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:31,918
Don't you understand
that i'm made out of steel?

805
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:43,563
Where will he go next,
this phantom from another time,

806
00:49:43,598 --> 00:49:46,683
this resurrected ghost
of a previous nightmare-

807
00:49:46,718 --> 00:49:49,186
chicago, los angeles,
miami, florida,

808
00:49:49,221 --> 00:49:52,322
vincennes, indiana,
syracuse, new york?

809
00:49:52,357 --> 00:49:54,825
Anyplace, everyplace,
where there's hate,

810
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:57,327
where there's prejudice,
where there's bigotry.

811
00:49:57,362 --> 00:49:58,695
He's alive.

812
00:49:58,730 --> 00:50:00,580
He's alive
so long as these evils exist.

813
00:50:00,615 --> 00:50:03,083
Remember that
when he comes to your town.

814
00:50:03,118 --> 00:50:04,951
Remember it
when you hear his voice

815
00:50:04,986 --> 00:50:06,203
speaking out through others.

816
00:50:06,238 --> 00:50:08,088
Remember it
when you hear a name called,

817
00:50:08,123 --> 00:50:09,339
a minority attacked,

818
00:50:09,374 --> 00:50:14,344
any blind, unreasoning assault
on a people or any human being.

819
00:50:14,379 --> 00:50:16,847
He's alive
because through these things,

820
00:50:16,882 --> 00:50:20,600
we keep him alive.

821
00:50:24,404 --> 00:50:26,773
The talented author
richard matheson

822
00:50:26,808 --> 00:50:28,642
pays a return visit
totwilight zone

823
00:50:28,677 --> 00:50:30,527
with a story called "mute."

824
00:50:30,562 --> 00:50:33,647
It provides an exception
challenge to the acting talents

825
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:36,149
of barbara baxley,
frank overton

826
00:50:36,184 --> 00:50:39,536
and an unusual 12-year-old
by the name of ann jillian.

827
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:42,406
Is she burned?

828
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:45,158
She's alive.

829
00:50:45,193 --> 00:50:47,661
Are you all right?

830
00:50:47,696 --> 00:50:48,912
She's in shock, harry.

831
00:50:48,947 --> 00:50:50,664
Bad off.

832
00:50:50,699 --> 00:50:52,549
Can't talk, can't cry,

833
00:50:52,584 --> 00:50:54,418
can't do nothing.

834
00:50:54,453 --> 00:50:56,303
She's not burned, though.

835
00:50:56,338 --> 00:50:58,805
How could she get out of that
house without being burned?

836
00:51:00,092 --> 00:51:02,559
Don't push, children.

837
00:51:02,594 --> 00:51:06,930
Be careful.

838
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:10,684
I want you to know

839
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:13,186
you're not fooling
me for one moment.

840
00:51:13,221 --> 00:51:15,072
I know exactly
what you are.

841
00:51:15,107 --> 00:51:18,825
I know... because my father
tried to force me

842
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:21,945
into the same thing
when i was your age.
