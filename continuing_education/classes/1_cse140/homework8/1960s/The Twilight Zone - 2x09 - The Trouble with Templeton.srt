1
00:00:10,577 --> 00:00:13,697
You're traveling
through another dimension-

2
00:00:13,732 --> 00:00:16,199
a dimension not only of sight
and sound, but of mind.

3
00:00:16,234 --> 00:00:18,084
A journey into a wondrous land

4
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:20,587
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

5
00:00:20,622 --> 00:00:21,838
That's the signpost up ahead.

6
00:00:21,873 --> 00:00:23,707
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

7
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,395
Good morning, mr. Templeton.

8
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:21,898
Our new guest
this week, marty-

9
00:01:21,933 --> 00:01:23,149
his name is what?

10
00:01:23,767 --> 00:01:24,400
Page, sir.

11
00:01:24,435 --> 00:01:25,652
Mr. Edward page.

12
00:01:25,687 --> 00:01:27,520
Page.

13
00:01:27,555 --> 00:01:28,772
Page, page.

14
00:01:28,807 --> 00:01:31,274
Has he been
here before?

15
00:01:31,309 --> 00:01:32,525
No, sir. He's new.

16
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,027
Oh.

17
00:01:34,062 --> 00:01:35,278
These new, too?

18
00:01:35,313 --> 00:01:36,529
Yes, sir.

19
00:01:36,564 --> 00:01:37,781
Every hour
on the hour.

20
00:01:37,816 --> 00:01:39,666
Hmm.

21
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:48,925
Mrs. Templeton is not
very discreet these days,

22
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,794
is she?

23
00:01:50,829 --> 00:01:53,930
Well, her discretion
was an early fatality.

24
00:01:53,965 --> 00:01:55,799
It didn't last very long.

25
00:01:55,834 --> 00:01:58,301
Perhaps she's
waiting for the day

26
00:01:58,336 --> 00:01:59,552
when these won't do

27
00:01:59,587 --> 00:02:02,055
what they're
designed to do.

28
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:04,557
Perhaps i'm waiting
for that day, too.

29
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:07,694
Mr. Templeton, you
shouldn't say that.

30
00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:10,196
Oh, don't distress
yourself, old friend.

31
00:02:10,231 --> 00:02:12,699
When a man my age
marries a woman her age,

32
00:02:12,734 --> 00:02:14,567
he gets exactly
what he deserves.

33
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:22,075
I'm old, marty.

34
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,577
Oh, mr. Templeton,
you could never be old.

35
00:02:24,612 --> 00:02:26,462
Old and getting older

36
00:02:26,497 --> 00:02:30,834
every minute that we
stand here speaking.

37
00:02:30,869 --> 00:02:33,970
They say- or at least
they've said it

38
00:02:34,005 --> 00:02:36,472
in most of my plays-

39
00:02:36,507 --> 00:02:38,975
that when a man
achieves years

40
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:42,095
he achieves reason
and contentment.

41
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,231
I haven't.

42
00:02:45,266 --> 00:02:46,482
Mr. Templeton,
may i suggest

43
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,985
that possibly
this isn't the day

44
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,236
for you to go
down there?

45
00:02:50,271 --> 00:02:52,739
Perhaps i should
telephone the theater

46
00:02:52,774 --> 00:02:55,241
and explain that you
can't start rehearsals.

47
00:02:55,276 --> 00:02:59,612
Well, thank you, marty,
but i'll go down there.

48
00:02:59,647 --> 00:03:02,115
I shall rehearse
this play,

49
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:04,000
and it will open.

50
00:03:04,035 --> 00:03:07,120
I shall cover up
the years with makeup,

51
00:03:07,155 --> 00:03:10,256
and i shall stand
in the right places

52
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:12,759
and hope to say
the right lines

53
00:03:12,794 --> 00:03:16,512
and, when it's over,
they'll all say to me,

54
00:03:16,547 --> 00:03:19,632
"you were wonderful,
mr. Templeton."

55
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:22,135
Then the stage manager
will see to it

56
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:24,637
that i'm properly
delivered to you

57
00:03:24,672 --> 00:03:27,774
so that you can properly
deliver me back here

58
00:03:27,809 --> 00:03:29,642
so that i can
go back there

59
00:03:29,677 --> 00:03:32,145
and do it all over
again next night.

60
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,396
I won't see,

61
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,281
nor particularly care,

62
00:03:35,316 --> 00:03:37,150
about what's going on
outside there,

63
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:39,035
or anywhere
in this house.

64
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:41,537
All i want will be
to go to bed, marty.

65
00:03:41,572 --> 00:03:44,040
That's the best place
for me-

66
00:03:44,075 --> 00:03:45,291
bed, sleep, oblivion.

67
00:03:45,326 --> 00:03:47,794
Now, sir, you shouldn't
talk like that.

68
00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:49,662
Oh, it doesn't matter.

69
00:03:49,697 --> 00:03:50,914
I don't
love her anymore.

70
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:54,667
I don't remember when i did.

71
00:03:54,702 --> 00:03:56,552
You know, i can't recall

72
00:03:56,587 --> 00:04:00,306
one single, separated,
contented moment.

73
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:05,929
I haven't had many
contented moments in my life.

74
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,565
But i do recall some.

75
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:12,685
Long ago.

76
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:20,076
Laura.

77
00:04:20,111 --> 00:04:25,081
The freshest, most radiant
creature god ever created.

78
00:04:25,116 --> 00:04:28,201
18 when i married her, marty.

79
00:04:28,236 --> 00:04:30,086
25 when she died.

80
00:04:33,241 --> 00:04:35,091
Why did he have to take her?

81
00:04:35,126 --> 00:04:36,342
Please,
mr. Templeton, sir,

82
00:04:36,377 --> 00:04:38,211
don't do this
to yourself.

83
00:04:38,246 --> 00:04:41,347
You know, there are some
moments in life

84
00:04:41,382 --> 00:04:45,101
that have an indescribable
loveliness to them.

85
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:50,723
Those moments with laura...

86
00:04:50,758 --> 00:04:53,226
are all i have left now.

87
00:04:53,261 --> 00:04:55,728
Do you understand
that, marty?

88
00:04:55,763 --> 00:04:58,231
Yes, mr. Templeton.
I believe i do, sir.

89
00:04:58,266 --> 00:04:59,482
But it...

90
00:04:59,517 --> 00:05:02,618
don't distress yourself,
old friend.

91
00:05:02,653 --> 00:05:04,487
I'm all right.

92
00:05:04,522 --> 00:05:06,372
I'm quite all right.

93
00:05:06,407 --> 00:05:09,492
Pleased to present
for your consideration

94
00:05:09,527 --> 00:05:10,743
mr. Booth templeton,

95
00:05:10,778 --> 00:05:14,630
serious and successful star
of over 30 broadway plays,

96
00:05:14,665 --> 00:05:17,133
who is not quite
all right today.

97
00:05:17,168 --> 00:05:20,887
Yesterday and its memories
is what he wants,

98
00:05:20,922 --> 00:05:23,389
and yesterday is what he'll get.

99
00:05:23,424 --> 00:05:26,509
Soon his years and his troubles
will descend on him

100
00:05:26,544 --> 00:05:27,760
in an avalanche.

101
00:05:27,795 --> 00:05:29,012
In order not to be crushed,

102
00:05:29,047 --> 00:05:32,765
mr. Booth templeton will escape
from his theater and his world,

103
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,268
and make his debut
on another stage

104
00:05:35,303 --> 00:05:39,022
in another world that
we call the twilight zone.

105
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:08,901
You're late, booth.

106
00:06:08,936 --> 00:06:10,153
After 12:00.

107
00:06:10,188 --> 00:06:12,655
The boy wonder
won't like it, kiddo.

108
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:14,540
Who is the boy wonder?

109
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:16,793
Arthur willis, directing.

110
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,411
No, no, no.
You must be mistaken.

111
00:06:18,446 --> 00:06:19,662
Dothmeager's
our director.

112
00:06:19,697 --> 00:06:20,913
Was. Canned him
last night.

113
00:06:20,948 --> 00:06:22,799
What?

114
00:06:22,834 --> 00:06:25,301
We need someone
with more pep, zip.

115
00:06:25,336 --> 00:06:26,169
Not my racket,

116
00:06:26,204 --> 00:06:28,671
but i know what's good
and what's bad

117
00:06:28,706 --> 00:06:29,922
as well as the next guy.

118
00:06:29,957 --> 00:06:31,808
And i wanted
to drop by this morning

119
00:06:31,843 --> 00:06:33,059
and let everybody know

120
00:06:33,094 --> 00:06:36,179
that i'm personally
interested in this thing.

121
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:39,432
Art willis is okay
with you, isn't he?

122
00:06:39,467 --> 00:06:41,317
Well, i've heard
of him, of course

123
00:06:41,352 --> 00:06:43,820
but i... i don't
actually know him

124
00:06:43,855 --> 00:06:44,437
uh... mr. Uh...

125
00:06:44,472 --> 00:06:47,440
i'm sid sperry.

126
00:06:47,475 --> 00:06:48,691
Remember?

127
00:06:48,726 --> 00:06:50,576
My money is backing
this play.

128
00:06:50,611 --> 00:06:52,195
Oh, yes, of course,
mr. Sperry.

129
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:54,080
I'm rather forgetful
about names.

130
00:06:54,115 --> 00:06:55,331
Always have been.

131
00:06:55,366 --> 00:06:56,582
It's okay.

132
00:06:56,617 --> 00:06:59,085
Just so long as you don't
forget your lines.

133
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:10,096
I say this once,

134
00:07:10,131 --> 00:07:11,964
just once.

135
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:15,101
And only once.

136
00:07:15,136 --> 00:07:16,969
But i say it now

137
00:07:17,004 --> 00:07:20,106
and expect each
and every one of you

138
00:07:20,141 --> 00:07:21,974
to understand it.

139
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:26,362
Michael franz
is producing this play.

140
00:07:26,397 --> 00:07:28,865
Mr. Coombs
has written it.

141
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:32,618
You have been hired
to act in it,

142
00:07:32,653 --> 00:07:35,121
and i have
been contracted

143
00:07:35,156 --> 00:07:36,372
to direct it.

144
00:07:36,407 --> 00:07:38,241
So make
no mistake

145
00:07:38,276 --> 00:07:40,743
about what we
are here to do,

146
00:07:40,778 --> 00:07:43,246
and make no mistake
about me.

147
00:07:43,281 --> 00:07:47,633
I will direct this play
myway at all times.

148
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:50,136
Is that clear?

149
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:53,756
Like that.

150
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,641
Like that very much.

151
00:07:55,676 --> 00:07:58,761
In control, that boy,
right from the start.

152
00:07:58,796 --> 00:08:00,012
Give us a good play.

153
00:08:00,047 --> 00:08:02,515
Us, mister...?

154
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:03,766
Sperry, templeton.

155
00:08:03,801 --> 00:08:05,017
Sperry.

156
00:08:05,052 --> 00:08:05,651
Yes, mr. Sperry.

157
00:08:05,686 --> 00:08:06,903
I... i apologize.

158
00:08:06,938 --> 00:08:08,771
That was impolite
of me.

159
00:08:08,806 --> 00:08:10,022
I won't forget again.

160
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:14,410
Call his home!
Call his home!

161
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,413
Valencia.

162
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:19,916
Never mind.

163
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:24,921
Some of us are young.

164
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,040
Some of us are old.

165
00:08:29,292 --> 00:08:31,794
But neither state
precludes any of us,

166
00:08:31,829 --> 00:08:33,045
young or old,

167
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,548
from ignoring
the basic cooperation

168
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,433
that will be
necessary here.

169
00:08:37,468 --> 00:08:38,684
When i direct,

170
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,553
there are no significant personalities

171
00:08:40,588 --> 00:08:41,804
in the cast
of any play,

172
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,307
but there are three
significant dates

173
00:08:44,342 --> 00:08:45,558
in the life
of a play...

174
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:53,065
the first day of rehearsal,
opening night, closing night.

175
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,319
The last two are related
and dependent upon the first.

176
00:08:56,354 --> 00:08:58,821
Therefore, the first day
of rehearsal

177
00:08:58,856 --> 00:09:00,706
is an extremely important day.

178
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:01,958
When i call
rehearsal

179
00:09:01,993 --> 00:09:03,209
for 12:00,
templeton,

180
00:09:03,244 --> 00:09:05,077
i meant 12:00
for everyone,

181
00:09:05,112 --> 00:09:05,711
young and old-

182
00:09:05,746 --> 00:09:06,963
everyone to be
in his place

183
00:09:06,998 --> 00:09:08,831
and ready to work
at 12:00 sharp.

184
00:09:08,866 --> 00:09:09,465
Are you ready

185
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:11,334
to work with us, templeton?

186
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,724
I asked you a question.

187
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:21,227
I expect an answer.

188
00:09:23,346 --> 00:09:23,980
Answer me!

189
00:09:24,347 --> 00:09:25,598
Answer me,
templeton!

190
00:09:25,633 --> 00:09:26,599
Speak up, templeton!

191
00:09:26,634 --> 00:09:27,600
Speak up!

192
00:09:27,635 --> 00:09:28,851
No...

193
00:09:28,886 --> 00:09:30,236
come back here,
templeton.

194
00:09:30,271 --> 00:09:31,487
Booth!

195
00:09:31,522 --> 00:09:33,356
Come back!

196
00:09:33,391 --> 00:09:35,107
Templeton!
Come back here!

197
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:43,059
Booth templeton
inthe great seed?

198
00:10:43,094 --> 00:10:46,178
1927's big hit?

199
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,566
1927.

200
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:53,069
That's more than 30 years ago.

201
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:03,696
Barney flueger.

202
00:11:03,731 --> 00:11:05,581
Barney!

203
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,216
Hey, mr. Templeton.

204
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:27,970
What year is this?

205
00:11:28,005 --> 00:11:29,221
1927.

206
00:11:29,256 --> 00:11:31,107
Say, you're not
trying to kid me,

207
00:11:31,142 --> 00:11:32,358
are you,
mr. Templeton?

208
00:11:32,393 --> 00:11:34,226
Most assuredly
i'm not.

209
00:11:34,261 --> 00:11:35,478
Your wife
just phoned

210
00:11:35,978 --> 00:11:37,863
and said for you
to meet her

211
00:11:37,898 --> 00:11:39,115
at freddie
iaccino's.

212
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,983
My wife?

213
00:11:41,018 --> 00:11:42,868
But laura's dead.

214
00:11:42,903 --> 00:11:44,737
Well, she's the
best-looking ghost

215
00:11:44,772 --> 00:11:46,622
i ever saw,
mr. Templeton.

216
00:11:46,657 --> 00:11:47,873
No offense, of course.

217
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,376
Where's laura?

218
00:11:50,411 --> 00:11:52,244
Where did you say
she's waiting for me?

219
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:55,381
At freddie iaccino's,
just around the corner.

220
00:12:45,214 --> 00:12:46,465
Hello, booth.

221
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,716
Freddie.

222
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:50,853
Yeah, what?

223
00:12:50,888 --> 00:12:52,721
It is you.

224
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:54,607
You're alive.

225
00:12:54,642 --> 00:12:55,224
Sure.

226
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,726
What did you expect?

227
00:12:59,013 --> 00:13:01,363
Can't be too
careful these days.

228
00:13:01,398 --> 00:13:03,866
All the time somebody's
wanting a raid or something.

229
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,752
What'll it be tonight,
steaks or chops?

230
00:13:23,787 --> 00:13:25,004
What?

231
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:28,140
Well, your wife's having
the kansas city.

232
00:13:34,763 --> 00:13:36,649
She isn't at
our usual table.

233
00:13:36,684 --> 00:13:39,151
She's over there.

234
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,412
Well?

235
00:13:50,447 --> 00:13:51,664
What?

236
00:13:51,699 --> 00:13:54,166
Steaks or chops?

237
00:13:54,201 --> 00:13:56,669
No, nothing. Nothing
to eat tonight, freddie.

238
00:13:56,704 --> 00:13:58,537
We're not staying very long.

239
00:14:00,074 --> 00:14:02,541
Oh, barney,
you're a scream.

240
00:14:02,576 --> 00:14:03,792
Oh, hi.

241
00:14:03,827 --> 00:14:05,044
Hi, booth.

242
00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:06,295
We didn't wait.

243
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:07,546
Barney.

244
00:14:07,581 --> 00:14:08,797
Barney flueger.

245
00:14:08,832 --> 00:14:10,049
The same.

246
00:14:10,084 --> 00:14:11,934
To know him
is to love him.

247
00:14:11,969 --> 00:14:13,185
Sit down,
old man.

248
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,436
I'll be
right back.

249
00:14:14,471 --> 00:14:16,305
Laura...
laura, darling.

250
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,807
Booth, my goodness.

251
00:14:18,842 --> 00:14:20,693
Come on, sit down.

252
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,812
The kansas city's
great tonight.

253
00:14:23,847 --> 00:14:25,064
It's juicy.

254
00:14:28,317 --> 00:14:29,568
See? I told you.

255
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,571
Laura, i...

256
00:14:33,822 --> 00:14:35,074
what's the matter?

257
00:14:35,109 --> 00:14:35,708
You look worried.

258
00:14:35,743 --> 00:14:36,959
Hmm?

259
00:14:36,994 --> 00:14:38,210
Booth, how
many times

260
00:14:38,245 --> 00:14:39,461
have i told you

261
00:14:39,496 --> 00:14:40,713
to take your
makeup off

262
00:14:40,748 --> 00:14:42,581
before you come
in here.

263
00:14:42,616 --> 00:14:44,466
Makeup?

264
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:48,837
Laura...
laura, darling,

265
00:14:48,872 --> 00:14:50,089
let's go
someplace else.

266
00:14:50,124 --> 00:14:51,974
Somewhere
where it's quieter.

267
00:14:52,009 --> 00:14:53,842
Where there aren't
so many people.

268
00:14:53,877 --> 00:14:55,094
Why?

269
00:14:55,129 --> 00:14:58,230
Well, i want to talk
to you, laura.

270
00:14:58,265 --> 00:15:00,482
Well, i want to have
a good time.

271
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:03,235
Oh, yoo-hoo!

272
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:05,104
Could you get me
another of these, please?

273
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:06,355
Thank you.

274
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:08,857
But i have to talk
to you, laura.

275
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,361
Well?

276
00:15:12,396 --> 00:15:14,613
I...

277
00:15:14,648 --> 00:15:16,498
oh, laura,
darling...

278
00:15:16,533 --> 00:15:17,750
i'm here.

279
00:15:17,785 --> 00:15:19,618
I don't know
for how long,

280
00:15:19,653 --> 00:15:21,503
or even
how i got here,

281
00:15:21,538 --> 00:15:23,005
or-or who put me
here, but i'm here

282
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,873
and i want to make good use of the time.

283
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:28,127
I want to have you alone
to myself.

284
00:15:28,162 --> 00:15:30,379
Booth, don't be dull.

285
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,633
Aren't you going
to eat, old chap?

286
00:15:34,668 --> 00:15:36,518
New band's
swell.

287
00:15:36,553 --> 00:15:39,021
Laura, laura... barney...

288
00:15:39,056 --> 00:15:40,889
you better
order.

289
00:15:40,924 --> 00:15:42,141
Yeah. He's
right, honey.

290
00:15:42,176 --> 00:15:43,392
Listen to me, you two...

291
00:15:43,427 --> 00:15:45,277
oh, it's so
hot tonight.

292
00:15:45,312 --> 00:15:47,780
Hey, george, bring
him one of these.

293
00:15:47,815 --> 00:15:51,533
I'll be glad
to get into a cold tub.

294
00:15:51,568 --> 00:15:52,151
Booth, will
you tell me why,

295
00:15:52,186 --> 00:15:54,036
on this glad,
green earth,

296
00:15:54,071 --> 00:15:55,904
you're wearing
an overcoat for

297
00:15:55,939 --> 00:15:57,156
on a night like this?

298
00:15:57,191 --> 00:15:59,041
Will you tell
me now, booth?

299
00:15:59,076 --> 00:15:59,658
I mean, really.

300
00:15:59,693 --> 00:16:01,543
I'm not so certain

301
00:16:01,578 --> 00:16:04,663
that it is a glad,
green earth.

302
00:16:04,698 --> 00:16:07,166
Oh, laura, laura,
darling...

303
00:16:07,201 --> 00:16:09,051
barney...

304
00:16:09,086 --> 00:16:10,919
i'm not so certain
of this earth,

305
00:16:10,954 --> 00:16:12,805
or of anything
in it, right now.

306
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,673
I... oh, please,
listen to me.

307
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:15,924
Listen to me,
won't you?

308
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:17,810
Laura, laura,
something's happened.

309
00:16:17,845 --> 00:16:20,929
Something
very strange.

310
00:16:20,964 --> 00:16:23,816
Please try to understand.

311
00:16:23,851 --> 00:16:25,684
This... this isn't makeup.

312
00:16:25,719 --> 00:16:28,187
I've grown older, darling.

313
00:16:28,222 --> 00:16:29,688
In another
world, many...

314
00:16:29,723 --> 00:16:31,573
for many, many
lonely years...

315
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:34,076
i've had only
a memory of you

316
00:16:34,111 --> 00:16:35,327
to live on.

317
00:16:35,362 --> 00:16:37,196
You, too, barney.

318
00:16:37,231 --> 00:16:38,447
Why, you were

319
00:16:38,482 --> 00:16:41,333
my one and only
best friend.

320
00:16:41,368 --> 00:16:46,705
But both of you have been
only memories for a long time.

321
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:50,459
And now, tonight...

322
00:16:50,494 --> 00:16:55,464
or today, or... whatever it is,

323
00:16:55,499 --> 00:17:00,469
and wherever i am in...
in space or time,

324
00:17:00,504 --> 00:17:02,971
i have you back again.

325
00:17:03,006 --> 00:17:04,223
You're alive.

326
00:17:04,973 --> 00:17:07,476
You didn't die.

327
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,478
Life is going on here.

328
00:17:09,513 --> 00:17:11,980
It's just as if you never died-

329
00:17:12,015 --> 00:17:13,866
either of you.

330
00:17:17,486 --> 00:17:19,371
You do understand, don't you?

331
00:17:19,406 --> 00:17:21,623
Oh, sure.

332
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:27,629
Laura, do you understand?

333
00:17:27,664 --> 00:17:28,881
Sure.

334
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:32,634
Come on, let's have
a good time, huh?

335
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:35,754
Laura...

336
00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:37,639
why are you so different?

337
00:17:40,008 --> 00:17:42,511
Well, that's the way
i am, booth.

338
00:17:42,546 --> 00:17:43,762
That's the way it is.

339
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:49,151
I mean, what did you expect?

340
00:17:49,186 --> 00:17:52,154
Yes, old chap,
whatdidyou expect?

341
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,275
I...

342
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:59,411
i don't know.

343
00:17:59,446 --> 00:18:01,280
But you were my love.

344
00:18:01,315 --> 00:18:02,531
Everywhere, at all times.

345
00:18:02,566 --> 00:18:06,285
Why, we couldn't walk a street
or sit in a restaurant

346
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,669
without everybody
knowing

347
00:18:07,704 --> 00:18:08,921
that we
were in love.

348
00:18:08,956 --> 00:18:10,172
Are you finished?

349
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:14,042
I don't like what you've become.

350
00:18:25,222 --> 00:18:26,438
Shut up.

351
00:18:27,055 --> 00:18:29,057
Shut up, both of you! Shut up!

352
00:18:29,092 --> 00:18:30,943
Laura, laura, come with me.

353
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,811
No.

354
00:18:32,846 --> 00:18:37,065
You're a silly old fool
of a man.

355
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,571
That's for me.

356
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:56,335
Stop it! Stop it!

357
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:59,221
Why don't you go back
where you came from?

358
00:18:59,256 --> 00:19:01,089
We don't
want you here.

359
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,043
Oh, yeah,
come on...

360
00:20:11,078 --> 00:20:12,911
no, no, please, please.

361
00:20:12,946 --> 00:20:14,162
Oh, come on...

362
00:20:58,707 --> 00:21:00,592
did it happen?

363
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:14,356
"What to do
when booth comes back."

364
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,361
"Table in speakeasy.

365
00:21:19,396 --> 00:21:21,863
"Enter booth as laura
throws back her head

366
00:21:21,898 --> 00:21:23,732
"and laughs too shrilly.

367
00:21:23,767 --> 00:21:26,234
'You're a scream,

00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:30,622
'the same.

369
00:21:30,657 --> 00:21:33,125
"'To know him is to love him.

370
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,376
Sit down, old chap.'"

371
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:48,140
'Why don't you go back
where you came from?

372
00:21:48,175 --> 00:21:50,642
We don't want you here.'"

373
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:55,013
Acting.

374
00:21:55,048 --> 00:21:57,516
They were acting for me.

375
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:02,521
They wanted me to go back
to my own life...

376
00:22:02,556 --> 00:22:04,406
and live it.

377
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:14,666
Templeton.

378
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,041
One question:

379
00:22:23,076 --> 00:22:26,178
Are you in or are you out?

380
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:48,066
I am definitely... in.

381
00:22:48,101 --> 00:22:51,203
And it is definitely
mr. Templeton,

382
00:22:51,238 --> 00:22:53,705
especially to one
so young as you.

383
00:22:56,074 --> 00:22:57,325
Now, wait
a minute...

384
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,828
excuse me, mr. Sperry,
but i never allow anyone

385
00:22:59,863 --> 00:23:02,330
not directly connected
with the production

386
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:04,216
to attend my rehearsals.

387
00:23:04,251 --> 00:23:05,467
I insist upon that.

388
00:23:05,502 --> 00:23:07,335
Just who do you
think you are?

389
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:09,838
Sidney... run along.

390
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:16,728
Now, then, shall
we start rehearsal?

391
00:23:16,763 --> 00:23:19,231
I'd like that,
mr. Templeton.

392
00:23:19,266 --> 00:23:23,101
I've just had a most remarkable
experience, young man.

393
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:26,238
I couldn't possibly
expect you to comprehend it,

394
00:23:26,273 --> 00:23:29,357
but i'm going to tell you
about it anyway...

395
00:23:29,392 --> 00:23:30,609
someday.

396
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:33,995
You know,
you were right.

397
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:35,864
The first day
of rehearsal

398
00:23:35,899 --> 00:23:39,618
isthe most important date
in the life of a play.

399
00:23:46,875 --> 00:23:48,760
Mr. Booth templeton,

400
00:23:48,795 --> 00:23:50,629
who shared with most
human beings the hunger

401
00:23:50,664 --> 00:23:52,514
to recapture the past moments-

402
00:23:52,549 --> 00:23:54,382
the ones that soften
with the years.

403
00:23:54,417 --> 00:23:56,268
But, in his case,

404
00:23:56,303 --> 00:23:58,136
the characters of his past
blocked him out

405
00:23:58,171 --> 00:23:59,387
and sent him back
to his own time,

406
00:23:59,422 --> 00:24:01,273
which is where we find him now-

407
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:03,775
mr. Booth templeton,

408
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:06,895
who had a round-trip ticket
into the twilight zone.

409
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:15,987
Rod serling,
the creator oftwilight zone,

410
00:24:16,022 --> 00:24:17,873
will tell you
about next week's story

411
00:24:17,908 --> 00:24:20,375
after this word
from our alternate sponsor.

412
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:23,528
And now, mr. Serling.

413
00:24:23,563 --> 00:24:26,631
In this $28 a day hotel suite

414
00:24:26,666 --> 00:24:29,751
live three human beings
who have larceny in them

415
00:24:29,786 --> 00:24:32,888
from their toes
to where they part their hair.

416
00:24:32,923 --> 00:24:37,259
Amongst the loot of one
evening's caper is this camera,

417
00:24:37,294 --> 00:24:39,761
which they soon discover
has most unique properties-

418
00:24:39,796 --> 00:24:42,264
it takes pictures of the future.

419
00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:43,515
Stick around
for the development,

420
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:46,017
next week, onthe twilight zone.
