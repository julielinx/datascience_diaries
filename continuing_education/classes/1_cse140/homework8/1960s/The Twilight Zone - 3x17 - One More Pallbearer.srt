1
00:00:11,378 --> 00:00:13,880
You're traveling
through another dimension-

2
00:00:13,915 --> 00:00:17,017
a dimension not only of sight
and sound, but of mind,

3
00:00:17,052 --> 00:00:18,885
a journey into a wondrous land

4
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,770
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

5
00:00:20,805 --> 00:00:23,273
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

6
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,308
She's all set,
mr. Radin.

7
00:00:58,343 --> 00:01:00,176
How about the
sound system?

8
00:01:00,211 --> 00:01:01,428
You check that out?

9
00:01:01,463 --> 00:01:02,679
She's all
ready to go.

10
00:01:02,714 --> 00:01:05,815
I don't know where you
got your sound effects

11
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:08,318
but you'd swear
a bomb was exploding.

12
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:10,186
I mean a big bomb.

13
00:01:10,221 --> 00:01:12,689
That's precisely the way
it's supposed to sound.

14
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:35,712
That about do it,
mr. Radin?

15
00:01:35,747 --> 00:01:36,963
That about does it.

16
00:01:36,998 --> 00:01:38,848
You got quite
a setup here.

17
00:01:38,883 --> 00:01:40,717
This part of
the illusion too?

18
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:43,219
No, this room is
not an illusion.

19
00:01:43,254 --> 00:01:45,105
I venture to guess

20
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,356
that it's the best
designed bomb shelter

21
00:01:46,391 --> 00:01:49,476
on the face of the
earth- who knows?

22
00:01:49,511 --> 00:01:52,612
The hydrogen bomb
is not an illusion.

23
00:01:52,647 --> 00:01:55,115
But tonight it's
for gags, huh?

24
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,366
Something of the sort.

25
00:01:56,401 --> 00:01:58,868
A practical joke,
let's say.

26
00:01:58,903 --> 00:02:00,120
You can say
that again.

27
00:02:00,155 --> 00:02:01,988
When they start
those sound effects

28
00:02:02,023 --> 00:02:03,873
and that stuff
on the screen

29
00:02:03,908 --> 00:02:06,376
you'd swear the world
was getting blasted.

30
00:02:06,411 --> 00:02:07,627
That's the idea.

31
00:02:07,662 --> 00:02:10,130
I have three guests
coming this evening;

32
00:02:10,165 --> 00:02:11,748
rather special
guests.

33
00:02:11,783 --> 00:02:14,884
You did this to fool
three of your friends?

34
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:17,253
Must be kind of
special friends.

35
00:02:17,288 --> 00:02:20,390
They are; they are, indeed-
very special friends.

36
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:28,398
What you have just looked at

37
00:02:28,433 --> 00:02:30,900
takes place 300 feet
underground,

38
00:02:30,935 --> 00:02:34,654
beneath the basement of
a new york city skyscraper.

39
00:02:34,689 --> 00:02:37,157
It's owned and lived in
by one paul radin.

40
00:02:37,192 --> 00:02:40,276
Mr. Radin is rich, eccentric
and single-minded-

41
00:02:40,311 --> 00:02:42,779
how rich,
we can already perceive.

42
00:02:42,814 --> 00:02:46,533
How eccentric and single-minded,
we shall see in a moment,

43
00:02:46,568 --> 00:02:49,035
because all of you
have just entered

44
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,920
the twilight zone.

45
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:17,614
Good evening, friends.

46
00:03:17,649 --> 00:03:20,733
Just step across the hall to
the door straight ahead of you.

47
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:36,749
Please come in, if you will.

48
00:03:38,001 --> 00:03:41,137
Sit down, make
yourselves comfortable.

49
00:03:53,051 --> 00:03:54,267
Please sit down.

50
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,167
How good of
you to come.

51
00:04:11,202 --> 00:04:13,670
Colonel hawthorne,
mr. Hughes,

52
00:04:13,705 --> 00:04:14,921
mrs. Langsford.

53
00:04:14,956 --> 00:04:16,172
It's radin,
isn't it?

54
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:20,543
Aren't you paul radin?

55
00:04:20,578 --> 00:04:23,046
You have an excellent
memory, reverend.

56
00:04:23,081 --> 00:04:25,548
And you, colonel,
do you recognize me?

57
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:26,799
I believe i do.

58
00:04:26,834 --> 00:04:29,936
Served under me once,
didn't you, radin?

59
00:04:29,971 --> 00:04:32,438
I did indeed, second lieutenant,
infantry regiment

60
00:04:33,056 --> 00:04:35,558
under your command,
africa, 1942.

61
00:04:35,593 --> 00:04:37,443
I recall it vaguely.

62
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:41,197
I seem to recall
something else too.

63
00:04:41,232 --> 00:04:44,317
It's not surprising it
doesn't flood back to you.

64
00:04:44,352 --> 00:04:46,202
You had a few thousand
men under you.

65
00:04:46,237 --> 00:04:47,453
I was only one.

66
00:04:47,488 --> 00:04:51,207
But then again, you didn't
court-martial all of them.

67
00:04:51,242 --> 00:04:53,710
That distinction
you reserved for me.

68
00:04:53,745 --> 00:04:54,961
Ah, yes, i do recall.

69
00:04:54,996 --> 00:04:58,081
You refused to lead
an assault on a hill;

70
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:01,217
refused in the face
of a direct order.

71
00:05:01,252 --> 00:05:04,337
The delay cost us
almost a company of men.

72
00:05:04,372 --> 00:05:07,473
That was your contention
to the court-martial board,

73
00:05:07,508 --> 00:05:09,976
and so i was stripped of rank,
dishonorably discharged.

74
00:05:10,011 --> 00:05:11,594
You were fortunate,
mr. Radin.

75
00:05:11,629 --> 00:05:13,479
Were i to have
dictated the sentence

76
00:05:13,514 --> 00:05:14,731
i would have had you shot.

77
00:05:14,766 --> 00:05:16,849
I'm sure you would have,
colonel.

78
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:18,851
I'm sure you
would have.

79
00:05:18,886 --> 00:05:24,607
But what a wretched host i am
to neglect the lady present.

80
00:05:24,642 --> 00:05:25,858
Mrs. Langsford.

81
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,863
Do you recall
who i am?

82
00:05:30,898 --> 00:05:32,115
Of course,
i do, paul.

83
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:34,000
I taught you
in high school.

84
00:05:34,035 --> 00:05:35,868
I don't forget
my students.

85
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:39,622
Oh, sometimes the names
and the faces get confused

86
00:05:39,657 --> 00:05:41,507
but if i prod my memory

87
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:44,010
i usually can connect
a name and a face-

88
00:05:44,045 --> 00:05:47,130
and, in your case, a character.

89
00:05:47,165 --> 00:05:49,632
You flunked me, mrs. Langsford;

90
00:05:49,667 --> 00:05:52,135
dressed me down
before an entire class;

91
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:54,637
called me names, humiliated me.

92
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,142
Well, let
me say again,

93
00:05:59,177 --> 00:06:01,027
how good of
you to come.

94
00:06:01,062 --> 00:06:02,278
I'm delighted

95
00:06:02,313 --> 00:06:04,147
you accepted
the invitation.

96
00:06:04,182 --> 00:06:06,032
Invitation?

97
00:06:06,067 --> 00:06:09,152
The request that i come here
was an ultimatum.

98
00:06:09,187 --> 00:06:11,654
Your chauffeur said
it was a matter

99
00:06:11,689 --> 00:06:12,905
of life and death.

100
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,791
Well, yes, yes, indeed.

101
00:06:14,826 --> 00:06:16,659
That's the way it
was broached to me.

102
00:06:16,694 --> 00:06:18,544
I was having my dinner

103
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:22,298
and my wife mary went
to answer the door,

104
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:24,167
and when she came back,

105
00:06:24,202 --> 00:06:27,920
she had such a strange
expression on her face.

106
00:06:27,955 --> 00:06:29,806
Ah, mr. Hughes,
you've never ceased

107
00:06:29,841 --> 00:06:32,925
to be a bit on the wordy
side, now, have you?

108
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,062
It's odd, really, how changeless
we remain over the years.

109
00:06:36,097 --> 00:06:38,564
But then again, i suppose
certain lifetime habits

110
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:40,433
are not easily put aside.

111
00:06:40,468 --> 00:06:42,318
Paul, perhaps you'd be
good enough to tell us

112
00:06:42,353 --> 00:06:44,187
why we've been asked
to come here.

113
00:06:44,222 --> 00:06:45,438
I'd be delighted to.

114
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,940
But first,
can i get you something?

115
00:06:47,975 --> 00:06:50,443
A highball, perhaps...

116
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,328
or a cup of coffee?

117
00:06:52,363 --> 00:06:55,448
Reverend, how do you
take your coffee?

118
00:06:55,483 --> 00:06:57,333
Habits, mrs. Langsford-

119
00:06:57,368 --> 00:07:00,453
the incredible
persistence of habits.

120
00:07:00,488 --> 00:07:03,589
You call me paul, as if
i were still sitting

121
00:07:03,624 --> 00:07:06,709
in the front row
in your classroom.

122
00:07:06,744 --> 00:07:08,594
But what about you,
mrs. Langsford?

123
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:09,846
A nice cup of tea?

124
00:07:09,881 --> 00:07:11,097
Thank you, no.

125
00:07:11,132 --> 00:07:12,348
Oh?

126
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:14,217
How about you, colonel-
a tot of rum, perhaps?

127
00:07:14,252 --> 00:07:15,468
I would appreciate

128
00:07:15,503 --> 00:07:17,970
if you made your point
and let us leave.

129
00:07:18,005 --> 00:07:21,107
You've obviously called
us here for something

130
00:07:21,142 --> 00:07:23,609
and i would welcome
hearing whatever it is.

131
00:07:23,644 --> 00:07:25,478
How staunchly military, colonel.

132
00:07:25,513 --> 00:07:27,363
Drive, drive, drive!

133
00:07:27,398 --> 00:07:29,866
Get up against that objective
and wipe it out.

134
00:07:29,901 --> 00:07:31,117
Red flag in the map

135
00:07:31,152 --> 00:07:32,985
and troops
out of the sun.

136
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,738
The nerves of steel
and a concrete head.

137
00:07:35,773 --> 00:07:36,989
That will
be all, radin!

138
00:07:37,024 --> 00:07:40,376
Colonel, you are
no longer in command.

139
00:07:40,411 --> 00:07:40,993
I'm in command here

140
00:07:41,028 --> 00:07:43,496
and what i command
is your attention.

141
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,999
I called you
three here

142
00:07:47,034 --> 00:07:48,885
for a very
specific purpose.

143
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:52,004
I want to settle
three old scores

144
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:53,890
but will do it
in chronology.

145
00:07:53,925 --> 00:07:57,009
My dear old schoolmarm
shall begin-

146
00:07:57,044 --> 00:08:00,146
that staunch and
intrepid educator

147
00:08:00,181 --> 00:08:02,265
that looks so
out of place

148
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,150
without her
severe spectacles

149
00:08:04,185 --> 00:08:05,401
covering severe eyes

150
00:08:05,436 --> 00:08:07,270
looking out of
a severe face

151
00:08:07,305 --> 00:08:08,521
and possessing

152
00:08:08,556 --> 00:08:11,023
that vast prerogative that comes
from the school board,

153
00:08:11,058 --> 00:08:12,275
and the vast courage

154
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:15,411
that comes with pitting all her
wits and instinct and knowledge

155
00:08:15,446 --> 00:08:17,280
against captive children.

156
00:08:17,315 --> 00:08:18,531
Are you finished, paul?

157
00:08:18,566 --> 00:08:22,919
My dear schoolmarm,
i've hardly begun.

158
00:08:22,954 --> 00:08:25,421
Well, then, may i make
an observation?

159
00:08:25,456 --> 00:08:26,672
Just a comment

160
00:08:26,707 --> 00:08:29,792
on how incredible
this whole thing is

161
00:08:29,827 --> 00:08:33,546
that a man like you,
a millionaire three times over,

162
00:08:33,581 --> 00:08:37,300
an important man who walks
with kings and heads of state

163
00:08:37,335 --> 00:08:39,185
and industrial
tycoons-

164
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:42,305
that such a man should
have a mind so tiny

165
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,190
that it could brood

166
00:08:44,225 --> 00:08:46,692
over a high school incident
of 20 years ago

167
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:50,446
and let it fester inside you
as you seem to have done.

168
00:08:50,481 --> 00:08:52,949
I have never liked humiliation,

169
00:08:52,984 --> 00:08:57,320
whether it happened 20 years ago
or in the past ten minutes.

170
00:08:57,355 --> 00:08:58,571
Humiliation?

171
00:08:58,606 --> 00:09:02,325
All right, paul, let's
talk about humiliation.

172
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,827
Let's talk about
your humiliation.

173
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,581
Mr. Radin was caught

174
00:09:08,616 --> 00:09:10,583
cheating in
an examination.

175
00:09:10,618 --> 00:09:11,834
Not a crime,
of course,

176
00:09:11,869 --> 00:09:15,588
but perhaps a bit indicative
of the character

177
00:09:15,623 --> 00:09:17,473
of the person who does it.

178
00:09:17,508 --> 00:09:19,342
And when he was accused
of this act,

179
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:23,729
this cocoon-
soon to become tycoon-

180
00:09:23,764 --> 00:09:28,100
tried to plant his crib sheets
on an innocent student.

181
00:09:28,135 --> 00:09:29,986
How right you are,

182
00:09:30,021 --> 00:09:32,488
mr. Radin, that i stood you
up on your feet

183
00:09:32,523 --> 00:09:34,357
and in front of
the entire class

184
00:09:34,392 --> 00:09:38,110
i told you exactly
what you were.

185
00:09:38,145 --> 00:09:40,613
But no room was there
then, mrs. Langsford,

186
00:09:40,648 --> 00:09:42,498
for a moment of compassion,

187
00:09:42,533 --> 00:09:44,367
for an iota of sympathy

188
00:09:44,402 --> 00:09:46,869
for a poor, frightened,
desperate boy.

189
00:09:46,904 --> 00:09:48,120
Mr. Radin, i've dealt

190
00:09:48,155 --> 00:09:50,623
with frightened and desperate
children all my life.

191
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,125
And it may surprise you to know

192
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,127
that i've lent them
more of sympathy

193
00:09:55,162 --> 00:09:56,379
and of compassion

194
00:09:56,414 --> 00:09:58,764
than i have lent
them of knowledge.

195
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:02,518
But neither sympathy nor
compassion can be handed out

196
00:10:02,553 --> 00:10:05,021
wholesale,
like cheap bubble gum.

197
00:10:05,056 --> 00:10:07,523
The recipient must
be worthy of them

198
00:10:07,558 --> 00:10:09,525
and you never were.

199
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:14,530
You were a devious,
dishonest troublemaker.

200
00:10:14,565 --> 00:10:17,533
And in spite of
all your millions,

201
00:10:17,568 --> 00:10:21,287
it's my guess you are still
devious,

202
00:10:21,322 --> 00:10:23,155
you are still dishonest.

203
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:25,658
And i've no doubt, even now,

204
00:10:25,693 --> 00:10:27,410
you're
a troublemaker.

205
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:31,797
You haven't changed,
mrs. Langsford.

206
00:10:31,832 --> 00:10:36,168
Mr. Radin, obviously
many years have passed

207
00:10:36,203 --> 00:10:39,922
between now and the time you
felt you'd suffered indignities

208
00:10:39,957 --> 00:10:42,425
at our hands,
but what's to be gained by...

209
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,927
a great deal can
be gained, reverend.

210
00:10:44,962 --> 00:10:46,178
A very great deal.

211
00:10:46,213 --> 00:10:48,681
You, for example, accused me
of a lack of character,

212
00:10:48,716 --> 00:10:51,183
put a scandal over my head,
destroyed my reputation.

213
00:10:51,218 --> 00:10:52,435
Yes, i remember.

214
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:57,440
A girl, mr. Radin,
a girl you drove to suicide.

215
00:10:57,475 --> 00:11:01,444
Because even at
that early stage

216
00:11:01,479 --> 00:11:05,331
you were not a man who held
honor in very high regard.

217
00:11:05,366 --> 00:11:08,451
You can go
to the devil, reverend!

218
00:11:08,486 --> 00:11:09,452
Radin!

219
00:11:09,487 --> 00:11:10,703
And you, too, colonel.

220
00:11:10,738 --> 00:11:11,954
Tonight,
my friends,

221
00:11:11,989 --> 00:11:13,205
you will all
go to the devil,

222
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,957
and that is not a
figure of speech!

223
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:20,596
Do you know why i built
this room down here?

224
00:11:20,631 --> 00:11:24,967
Those walls are 18
inches concrete with
reinforced steel.

225
00:11:25,002 --> 00:11:27,470
And around them,
six inches of lead.

226
00:11:27,505 --> 00:11:31,857
I have my own generator
system, my own air system.

227
00:11:31,892 --> 00:11:34,977
Yes, and out there,
beyond that door,

228
00:11:35,012 --> 00:11:38,114
a storeroom the size
of a warehouse.

229
00:11:39,982 --> 00:11:41,867
You understand
logistics, colonel.

230
00:11:41,902 --> 00:11:44,370
Does it occur toyouwhy i
should have gone to all this

231
00:11:44,405 --> 00:11:46,238
trouble and expense?

232
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:54,997
To begin a vigil, my friends.

233
00:11:55,032 --> 00:11:58,751
The long wait and the countdown.

234
00:11:58,786 --> 00:12:02,505
Yes. I have walked
with kings and tycoons,

235
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:03,756
as you perceive, mrs. Langsford.

236
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:06,892
I have walked with them,
and i have listened to them.

237
00:12:06,927 --> 00:12:10,646
I keep abreast of the times,
and usually well ahead of them.

238
00:12:10,681 --> 00:12:12,515
I know things
that are going to happen.

239
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,400
I pay for the service.

240
00:12:14,517 --> 00:12:15,768
48 hours ago

241
00:12:15,803 --> 00:12:18,270
i received a most
interesting bit of news,

242
00:12:18,305 --> 00:12:21,407
something that
perhaps only six men

243
00:12:21,442 --> 00:12:23,909
in the world know of...

244
00:12:23,944 --> 00:12:27,029
the world is coming
to an end this evening,

245
00:12:27,064 --> 00:12:30,783
ladies and gentlemen.

246
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:35,287
At 11:45, there will be no
more city, no more country.

247
00:12:35,322 --> 00:12:39,675
At 30 minutes after midnight,
there will be no more world.

248
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:41,677
They are going
to bomb us,

249
00:12:41,712 --> 00:12:44,180
and we are going
to bomb them.

250
00:12:44,215 --> 00:12:48,684
By dawn, there will be nothing
left but rubble and bodies.

251
00:12:50,553 --> 00:12:53,055
And in a few moments
it will all begin.

252
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:56,192
You'll be hearing
sirens very shortly-

253
00:12:56,227 --> 00:12:57,443
that's the red alert.

254
00:12:57,478 --> 00:13:00,563
That means their missiles
are on their way.

255
00:13:00,598 --> 00:13:02,448
Ours will follow
soon after.

256
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:07,453
And you are to
survive, mr. Radin?

257
00:13:07,488 --> 00:13:09,321
Is that the idea?

258
00:13:09,356 --> 00:13:11,457
I am to survive, mr. Hughes.

259
00:13:11,492 --> 00:13:13,325
I am 300 feet underground.

260
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,828
And what about you, reverend?

261
00:13:15,863 --> 00:13:18,330
Do you wish
to survive?

262
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:21,467
Do the rest of you
wish to survive?

263
00:13:22,084 --> 00:13:26,472
Or am i to be
the only pallbearer?

264
00:13:37,768 --> 00:13:41,237
This is your civil
defense announcer.

265
00:13:41,272 --> 00:13:45,741
Repeating, the air defense
command has just declared

266
00:13:45,776 --> 00:13:47,610
a take-cover signal.

267
00:13:47,645 --> 00:13:50,496
This is not a practice warning,
not a drill.

268
00:13:50,531 --> 00:13:54,366
An attack by enemy forces
is expected at any moment.

269
00:13:54,401 --> 00:13:57,870
You must seek the nearest
shelter immediately.

270
00:13:57,905 --> 00:13:59,121
If you are in your home,

271
00:13:59,156 --> 00:14:02,258
go to your prepared shelter
or to the basement.

272
00:14:02,293 --> 00:14:04,760
If you have no shelter
or basement,

273
00:14:04,795 --> 00:14:07,263
go toward the center of the
house, to the first room

274
00:14:07,298 --> 00:14:08,764
or hall
that will put as many walls

275
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:13,135
as possible between you
and the outside of the house.

276
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:15,020
Take your radio with you.

277
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:18,140
If you are in any other type of
building, go to the basement

278
00:14:18,175 --> 00:14:21,277
or lowest floor and get as close
to the center of the building

279
00:14:21,312 --> 00:14:22,528
as possible.

280
00:14:31,053 --> 00:14:34,740
...leave your shelter until told
it is safe to do so.

281
00:14:34,775 --> 00:14:36,625
This is not a test.

282
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,994
This is a real take-cover...

283
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:43,999
comments?

284
00:14:44,034 --> 00:14:47,753
Perhaps a little military
sophistry now, colonel.

285
00:14:47,788 --> 00:14:49,638
A quote from
general grant.

286
00:14:49,673 --> 00:14:50,890
Or you, reverend,

287
00:14:50,925 --> 00:14:53,392
something enriching
from the gospel.

288
00:14:53,427 --> 00:14:55,261
Such silence, mrs. Langsford?

289
00:14:55,296 --> 00:14:57,763
Nothing in that vast repertoire,

290
00:14:57,798 --> 00:15:00,266
that pilgrim's progress mind
of yours,

291
00:15:00,301 --> 00:15:01,517
to handle
the situation?

292
00:15:01,552 --> 00:15:04,019
A mental eraser to
wipe out reality?

293
00:15:04,054 --> 00:15:06,021
I've got to
get to my wife.

294
00:15:06,056 --> 00:15:09,158
By all means, reverend,
get to your wife.

295
00:15:09,193 --> 00:15:12,278
Hold hands and
die together.

296
00:15:12,313 --> 00:15:14,780
You turn my stomach,
mr. Hughes.

297
00:15:14,815 --> 00:15:16,665
"Get to your wife."

298
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,534
That's not what's
on your mind.

299
00:15:18,569 --> 00:15:21,670
What's on your mind is
what's on the colonel's mind

300
00:15:21,705 --> 00:15:23,539
and the schoolmarm's mind.

301
00:15:23,574 --> 00:15:26,041
Your precious hide,
your sanctified flesh.

302
00:15:26,076 --> 00:15:28,544
That's what preoccupies
you at the moment.

303
00:15:28,579 --> 00:15:29,795
If i'm to die tonight

304
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:32,298
i want to be with
someone i love.

305
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:35,434
"Somebody i love..."
how theatrical!

306
00:15:35,469 --> 00:15:36,685
But more burlesque
than legitimate.

307
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:39,188
Have the decency, reverend,
to depart this earth

308
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:41,690
with just a fragment of
the truth in your mouth.

309
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:44,193
Tell me to my face
that you're so scared,

310
00:15:44,228 --> 00:15:45,444
so miserably frightened,

311
00:15:45,479 --> 00:15:47,313
that you'd sell
your wife by the pound

312
00:15:47,348 --> 00:15:49,198
if it meant
your own survival.

313
00:15:49,233 --> 00:15:52,952
If those were the last words
i spoke before i died,

314
00:15:52,987 --> 00:15:55,454
they would also be
the worst falsehood

315
00:15:55,489 --> 00:15:57,323
i ever uttered on earth.

316
00:15:57,358 --> 00:15:59,825
Now, will you open this door?

317
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,710
Will you let me leave now?

318
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,233
How did you
know, radin?

319
00:16:24,268 --> 00:16:25,484
How could you
possibly have known?

320
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:26,735
What difference
does it make?

321
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:27,987
If he'll let
us leave now

322
00:16:28,022 --> 00:16:30,239
perhaps we can
reach our homes
before it happens.

323
00:16:30,274 --> 00:16:32,741
My dear friends, shall we drop
the pretenses now?

324
00:16:32,776 --> 00:16:34,610
Shall we, all of us now,
tell the truth?

325
00:16:34,645 --> 00:16:37,496
I told you
how this room
was constructed-

326
00:16:37,531 --> 00:16:39,248
steel, concrete and lead.

327
00:16:39,283 --> 00:16:42,368
It may be the only place on
earth where you can survive.

328
00:16:42,403 --> 00:16:45,504
Now, what is this nonsense
about going back to your homes?

329
00:16:45,539 --> 00:16:48,624
Do you mean to say that you
would walk out of here and die

330
00:16:48,659 --> 00:16:51,126
when by simply sitting
here you could live?

331
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:55,881
Are we to understand,
mr. Radin,

332
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:58,384
that you will permit
us this luxury?

333
00:16:58,419 --> 00:17:00,636
You will allow
us to stay?

334
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:02,521
Of course, colonel.
As a matter of fact,

335
00:17:02,556 --> 00:17:04,390
it's precisely why
i've asked you to come.

336
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,526
Each of you in his own way
has tried to destroy me.

337
00:17:07,561 --> 00:17:09,395
But i'll not repay
the compliment.

338
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:11,897
That is to say, i will not
require an eye for an eye,

339
00:17:11,932 --> 00:17:13,782
nothing as primitive
or as naked as that.

340
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,535
What is your price,
mr. Radin?

341
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:18,404
I'd be interested.

342
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:20,906
The colonel would
be interested.

343
00:17:20,941 --> 00:17:24,043
I presume the reverend
and the schoolmarm

344
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:25,294
would be interested.

345
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:26,545
I submit,
dear friends,

346
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,414
you're not
just interested.

347
00:17:28,449 --> 00:17:31,550
It's probably the only
thing in god's earth

348
00:17:31,585 --> 00:17:34,053
that has any meaning
left at all.

349
00:17:34,088 --> 00:17:37,056
But the price, colonel...

350
00:17:37,091 --> 00:17:38,307
you will beg my pardon,

351
00:17:38,342 --> 00:17:40,175
you will ask my forgiveness,

352
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:43,929
and, if need be, will get
down on your hands and knees

353
00:17:43,964 --> 00:17:45,814
to perform the function.

354
00:17:45,849 --> 00:17:47,182
"Pretty please
with sugar on it."

355
00:17:47,217 --> 00:17:49,685
How's that?
Speak up, teacher.

356
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,571
"Pretty please
with sugar on it."

357
00:17:52,606 --> 00:17:56,325
It's what children say
to exact a favor.

358
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,827
I don't want your
favor, mr. Radin!

359
00:17:58,862 --> 00:18:00,696
Let me out of here!

360
00:18:00,731 --> 00:18:03,832
If i'm to spend my last
quarter hour on earth

361
00:18:03,867 --> 00:18:06,335
i'd rather spend it
with a stray cat

362
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:08,203
or alone in central park

363
00:18:08,238 --> 00:18:10,706
or in a city
full of strangers

364
00:18:10,741 --> 00:18:13,459
whose names
i'll never know.

365
00:18:13,494 --> 00:18:15,961
The door, radin.

366
00:18:15,996 --> 00:18:19,098
Will you open
the door now?

367
00:18:19,133 --> 00:18:22,217
Open up, radin.

368
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:25,354
You're too blind
or you're too stupid,

369
00:18:25,389 --> 00:18:27,856
because none of you
seem to understand.

370
00:18:27,891 --> 00:18:29,108
All you have to do-

371
00:18:29,143 --> 00:18:32,227
literally, all you have
to do- is to say a sentence.

372
00:18:32,262 --> 00:18:34,980
Just a string of
silly, stupid words.

373
00:18:35,015 --> 00:18:36,865
Like a command, colonel,

374
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:39,368
or like
a lesson, teacher,

375
00:18:39,403 --> 00:18:41,870
or like
a prayer, reverend.

376
00:18:43,739 --> 00:18:46,875
All you have to say
is you're sorry.

377
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:59,755
All right,
you want to die, fine.

378
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:01,006
But you'll be back

379
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:02,007
inside
five minutes.

380
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:08,263
There's the elevator!
Take it!

381
00:19:08,298 --> 00:19:10,149
Take the farce
to its conclusion.

382
00:19:10,184 --> 00:19:12,017
Go up into the street
and see the panic

383
00:19:12,052 --> 00:19:13,268
and the frenzy
and the horror.

384
00:19:13,303 --> 00:19:15,154
And then come back down
here to your salvation.

385
00:19:15,189 --> 00:19:17,656
Or you can watch it all
down here on that screen.

386
00:19:17,691 --> 00:19:19,525
You can see it all happen,
the whole thing.

387
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:23,278
Watch the world being
shoveled into a grave.

388
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,288
It's your
last chance.

389
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,042
It's your last chance,
i mean it.

390
00:19:37,077 --> 00:19:40,179
Tell me, reverend, is
life so stinking cheap

391
00:19:40,214 --> 00:19:42,681
that you can throw
it down a drain?

392
00:19:42,716 --> 00:19:46,435
Life is very dear, mr. Radin,
infinitely valuable.

393
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:50,189
But there are other things
that come even higher.

394
00:19:50,224 --> 00:19:52,057
Honor is one of them-

395
00:19:52,092 --> 00:19:55,194
perhaps the most
expensive of them all.

396
00:19:55,811 --> 00:19:57,062
Amen.

397
00:19:57,097 --> 00:19:59,565
Try not to get
too lonely, mr. Radin.

398
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,816
Use mirrors.
They may help.

399
00:20:00,851 --> 00:20:02,067
Put them all
around the room.

400
00:20:02,102 --> 00:20:05,204
Then you'll have the company
of a world full of radins.

401
00:20:05,239 --> 00:20:06,455
It'll be a fantasy,
of course,

402
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:08,957
but then your whole life
has been a fantasy,

403
00:20:08,992 --> 00:20:10,209
a parade of illusions-

404
00:20:10,244 --> 00:20:13,328
illusions about what
people have done to you,

405
00:20:13,363 --> 00:20:15,831
illusions about what justice is,

406
00:20:15,866 --> 00:20:18,333
illusions about
what is the dignity

407
00:20:18,368 --> 00:20:20,219
of even the
lowest of us.

408
00:20:20,254 --> 00:20:21,470
A fantasy,
mr. Radin,

409
00:20:21,505 --> 00:20:24,590
and now you can have
it all to yourself.

410
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:33,982
No, it's not true,
it's not a fantasy.

411
00:20:34,017 --> 00:20:36,485
No, it's not a fantasy!

412
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,107
This is your civil defense
announcer.

413
00:20:42,142 --> 00:20:46,495
Our military authorities have
just ordered a take-cover alert.

414
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:48,997
Attack by enemy forces
is imminent.

415
00:20:49,032 --> 00:20:50,866
Take cover immediately.

416
00:20:50,901 --> 00:20:54,753
If you are in your car driving
away from your city, continue.

417
00:20:54,788 --> 00:20:56,622
Keep on driving.

418
00:20:56,657 --> 00:20:58,507
Do not stop.

419
00:20:58,542 --> 00:21:00,509
When movement is
no longer possible,

420
00:21:00,544 --> 00:21:02,010
seek the best available refuge.

421
00:21:02,045 --> 00:21:03,879
That's enough!

422
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:08,267
If you are outdoors on foot,
hurry to the nearest shelter...

423
00:21:17,392 --> 00:21:19,895
that's quite enough!

424
00:22:44,765 --> 00:22:47,232
Anybody?

425
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,117
Anybody.

426
00:22:49,152 --> 00:22:51,620
Please...

427
00:22:51,655 --> 00:22:54,122
somebody...

428
00:22:54,157 --> 00:22:55,490
hey, mac, mac.

429
00:22:55,525 --> 00:22:58,627
Had a little
bit too much?

430
00:22:58,662 --> 00:23:00,495
Hey, mac.

431
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:01,747
I didn't want
it this way.

432
00:23:01,782 --> 00:23:03,632
Let me take
you home, mac.

433
00:23:03,667 --> 00:23:05,500
I didn't want
it this way.

434
00:23:05,535 --> 00:23:07,386
No, somebody, please.
Mac...?

435
00:23:07,421 --> 00:23:11,757
Anybody, won't
somebody listen to me?

436
00:23:16,179 --> 00:23:18,013
Go on now, move along.
Move along, please.

437
00:23:18,048 --> 00:23:19,898
There isn't a thing
here to worry about.

438
00:23:20,515 --> 00:23:21,266
Move along, please!

439
00:23:21,301 --> 00:23:23,151
Please, move along,
please, please.

440
00:23:23,186 --> 00:23:25,020
It's okay now.
You're gonna
be all right.

441
00:23:25,055 --> 00:23:27,522
We're going
to help you.

442
00:23:27,557 --> 00:23:29,408
Isn't there
anybody left?

443
00:23:30,025 --> 00:23:30,659
Nobody?

444
00:23:30,694 --> 00:23:31,910
You're gonna be
all right.

445
00:23:31,945 --> 00:23:33,161
Nobody!

446
00:23:33,196 --> 00:23:34,413
Now, go on,
break it up.

447
00:23:34,448 --> 00:23:36,281
There isn't a
thing here to see.
Go on, go on.

448
00:23:36,316 --> 00:23:38,166
Nobody.

449
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:41,286
Nobody...

450
00:23:41,321 --> 00:23:43,171
oh, god...

451
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,291
god...

452
00:23:50,045 --> 00:23:52,547
mr. Paul radin,
a dealer in fantasy

453
00:23:52,582 --> 00:23:55,050
who sits in the rubble
of his own making

454
00:23:55,085 --> 00:23:58,186
and imagines that he's
the last man on earth,

455
00:23:58,221 --> 00:24:01,306
doomed to a perdition
of unutterable loneliness

456
00:24:01,341 --> 00:24:05,060
because a practical joke
has turned into a nightmare.

457
00:24:05,095 --> 00:24:07,562
Mr. Paul radin,
pallbearer at a funeral

458
00:24:07,597 --> 00:24:11,316
that he manufactured himself
in the twilight zone.

459
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:17,405
Rod serling,
creator ofthe twilight zone,

460
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,908
will tell you
about next week's story

461
00:24:19,943 --> 00:24:22,027
after this message.

462
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:24,546
And now, mr. Serling.

463
00:24:24,581 --> 00:24:27,666
Next week, through the good
offices of mr. Charles beaumont,

464
00:24:27,701 --> 00:24:29,551
we take a walk
in some dead man's shoes.

465
00:24:29,586 --> 00:24:32,053
It's the story of a hobo
who takes some shoes

466
00:24:32,088 --> 00:24:34,556
off a recently-deceased hoodlum,
and then discovers

467
00:24:34,591 --> 00:24:37,058
that if the shoe fits,
you have to wear it.

468
00:24:37,093 --> 00:24:39,561
And in this case, you have to do
as the shoes do-

469
00:24:39,596 --> 00:24:40,812
go where they tell you to

470
00:24:40,847 --> 00:24:43,932
and then perform some services
above and beyond the norm.

471
00:24:43,967 --> 00:24:47,686
I hope we see you next week
for "dead man's shoes."

472
00:25:16,748 --> 00:25:21,603
Seat belts can reduce serious
injury by one-third.

473
00:25:21,638 --> 00:25:24,723
Does your family have the
security of seat belts?
