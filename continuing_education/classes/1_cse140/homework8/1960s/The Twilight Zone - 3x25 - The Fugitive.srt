1
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,263
You're traveling
through another dimension-

2
00:00:13,298 --> 00:00:17,017
a dimension not only of sight
and sound, but of mind,

3
00:00:17,052 --> 00:00:18,885
a journey into a wondrous land

4
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,388
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

5
00:00:21,423 --> 00:00:23,890
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

6
00:00:35,151 --> 00:00:38,288
Strike two!

7
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:48,548
Strike three!

8
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:49,799
You're out.

9
00:00:49,834 --> 00:00:52,302
Howie gottlieb, you're never
going to get to heaven.

10
00:00:52,337 --> 00:00:54,170
That was a ball,
and you know it.

11
00:00:54,205 --> 00:00:56,673
Was not.
Was too.

12
00:00:56,708 --> 00:00:59,175
How about that,
ben, you saw it?

13
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:01,678
Jenny, howie's the umpire.

14
00:01:01,713 --> 00:01:03,563
Who's up?
You are.

15
00:01:03,598 --> 00:01:04,814
Well, it's about time.

16
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:06,683
Look out.

17
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:36,346
Yippee!

18
00:01:36,381 --> 00:01:38,465
Home run.

19
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,218
No fair. No fair.

20
00:01:42,253 --> 00:01:45,355
You said you wouldn't
use magic anymore.

21
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:46,606
Four to four.

22
00:01:46,641 --> 00:01:48,475
Dirty deal,
that's cheating.

23
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:50,360
Come on,
let's play ball.

24
00:01:50,395 --> 00:01:52,228
What with?

25
00:01:52,263 --> 00:01:53,863
All right, never mind.

26
00:01:53,898 --> 00:01:56,366
Let's do something else.

27
00:01:56,401 --> 00:01:57,984
How about spaceman?

28
00:01:58,019 --> 00:02:00,487
All those who wish
to play spaceman

29
00:02:00,522 --> 00:02:01,871
raise their hands.

30
00:02:01,906 --> 00:02:05,625
All right, and this time,
jenny, you're the martian.

31
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,876
Naw.

32
00:02:06,911 --> 00:02:08,128
It's your turn.

33
00:02:08,163 --> 00:02:11,881
I know, but i can't turn
into things the way you can.

34
00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:14,384
Aw, come on, ben,

35
00:02:14,419 --> 00:02:16,002
don't be a dirty guy.

36
00:02:16,037 --> 00:02:17,504
Jenny moves too slow.

37
00:02:17,539 --> 00:02:19,389
All right, all right.

38
00:02:19,424 --> 00:02:21,257
This is the last time.

39
00:02:21,292 --> 00:02:23,760
Now, let me see,
what should i do?

40
00:02:23,795 --> 00:02:26,646
Jenny, you get to
write the script.

41
00:02:26,681 --> 00:02:27,897
Well...

42
00:02:27,932 --> 00:02:31,017
that's the rocket ship
over there.

43
00:02:31,052 --> 00:02:32,769
And i'm the captain.

44
00:02:32,804 --> 00:02:34,020
What are you
talking about?

45
00:02:34,055 --> 00:02:36,523
Who ever heard of
a dame with a brace

46
00:02:36,558 --> 00:02:37,774
being captain?

47
00:02:37,809 --> 00:02:40,026
All right, you bunch of babies.

48
00:02:40,061 --> 00:02:41,911
Yoube the captain.

49
00:02:41,946 --> 00:02:44,414
The rest of you
are lieutenants and stuff.

50
00:02:44,449 --> 00:02:46,166
Who are you?

51
00:02:46,201 --> 00:02:48,418
I'm the beautiful stowaway.

52
00:02:52,207 --> 00:02:55,291
Okay, now, ben,
you go on over to the ship.

53
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,683
Now we just landed, see.

54
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,552
This is mars.

55
00:03:05,587 --> 00:03:07,437
We've been exploring around

56
00:03:07,472 --> 00:03:09,939
trying to find out
if anyone's alive.

57
00:03:09,974 --> 00:03:11,191
Got that?

58
00:03:11,226 --> 00:03:14,944
When we come over to the ship,
you come out.

59
00:03:14,979 --> 00:03:17,447
And make it real horrible.

60
00:03:17,482 --> 00:03:19,315
I mean, you know,
real horrible.

61
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:21,818
Not too horrible.

62
00:03:21,853 --> 00:03:23,453
You suppose
any martians

63
00:03:23,488 --> 00:03:25,955
snuck inside
the ship, captain?

64
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:29,075
Not a chance, this ship
is heretically sealed.

65
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,960
You go ahead.

66
00:03:30,995 --> 00:03:32,829
You go, you're
the captain.

67
00:03:32,864 --> 00:03:34,080
Go on, howie.

68
00:03:34,115 --> 00:03:37,834
Okay, i'll lead,
but i want my men behind me.

69
00:03:37,869 --> 00:03:39,719
Sneak formation.

70
00:03:48,344 --> 00:03:49,596
It's a martian.

71
00:03:49,631 --> 00:03:50,847
Somebody shoot!

72
00:03:50,882 --> 00:03:53,349
Boing, boing, boing...

73
00:03:53,384 --> 00:03:55,351
boing, boing,
boing...

74
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,859
i think you got him.

75
00:04:04,861 --> 00:04:06,112
It's been said

76
00:04:06,147 --> 00:04:09,866
that science fiction and fantasy
are two different things-

77
00:04:09,901 --> 00:04:13,002
science fiction,
the improbable made possible;

78
00:04:13,037 --> 00:04:15,505
fantasy,
the impossible made probable.

79
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,756
What would you have

80
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:19,876
if you put these two
different things together?

81
00:04:19,911 --> 00:04:21,761
Well, you'd have
an old man named ben

82
00:04:21,796 --> 00:04:24,264
who knows tricks
most people don't know

83
00:04:24,881 --> 00:04:27,383
and a little girl
named jenny who loves him...

84
00:04:27,418 --> 00:04:31,137
and a journey into the heart
of the twilight zone.

85
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:49,138
Ooh-wee!

86
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:51,007
Now, everybody off.

87
00:04:51,042 --> 00:04:53,509
Now, that'll be ten cents,
please.

88
00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:54,761
Pay you tomorrow.

89
00:04:54,796 --> 00:04:56,646
How do i know
i can trust you?

90
00:04:56,681 --> 00:04:57,897
You can't.

91
00:04:57,932 --> 00:05:00,400
Well, in that case,
it's a deal.

92
00:05:00,435 --> 00:05:02,151
Ahh...

93
00:05:02,186 --> 00:05:04,020
"say i'm weary, say i'm sad

94
00:05:04,055 --> 00:05:07,774
"say that health and wealth
have missed me

95
00:05:07,809 --> 00:05:09,659
"say that i am growing old

96
00:05:09,694 --> 00:05:11,527
but add, jenny kissed me."

97
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:12,779
What's that?

98
00:05:12,814 --> 00:05:14,030
Earth poetry.

99
00:05:14,065 --> 00:05:16,032
You made it up,
but i like it.

100
00:05:16,067 --> 00:05:17,283
So do i.

101
00:05:17,318 --> 00:05:19,168
All right, up we go.

102
00:05:19,203 --> 00:05:20,420
With your skates on?

103
00:05:20,455 --> 00:05:21,671
I forgot.

104
00:05:27,543 --> 00:05:28,795
Scat!

105
00:05:33,217 --> 00:05:35,051
Nothing to it.

106
00:05:35,086 --> 00:05:36,936
Here we go.

107
00:05:40,556 --> 00:05:43,059
What do you think?

108
00:05:43,094 --> 00:05:43,693
I don't know.

109
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:48,314
Ben, tell me something.

110
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:50,817
What is it,
little monkey?

111
00:05:50,852 --> 00:05:52,068
You can do
so many things,

112
00:05:52,103 --> 00:05:55,822
how come you don't
make my leg well?

113
00:05:55,857 --> 00:06:01,461
Well, because then i wouldn't
have the fun of carrying you.

114
00:06:01,496 --> 00:06:03,963
And you'd get yourself
a young boyfriend.

115
00:06:03,998 --> 00:06:05,214
I'm serious.

116
00:06:05,249 --> 00:06:07,717
You could do it,
couldn't you?

117
00:06:07,752 --> 00:06:12,088
Perhaps, but...
no, jenny, i mustn't do it.

118
00:06:12,123 --> 00:06:14,590
Why?

119
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:17,844
I told you to be back
before the stores closed.

120
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:19,095
It's my fault,
mrs. Gann.

121
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:20,980
It's always your
fault, ain't it?

122
00:06:21,015 --> 00:06:22,231
Come on, aunt agnes.

123
00:06:22,266 --> 00:06:24,100
Shut up, you ungrateful
little guttersnipe.

124
00:06:24,135 --> 00:06:25,985
After all
i done for you.

125
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,488
After i fed you
and took care of you

126
00:06:28,523 --> 00:06:30,356
and give you
a place to sleep.

127
00:06:30,391 --> 00:06:32,241
Where'd you be
if it wasn't for me?

128
00:06:32,276 --> 00:06:33,493
In an orphanage!

129
00:06:33,528 --> 00:06:36,612
If you don't mind,
that's where you're going.

130
00:06:36,746 --> 00:06:37,997
Now you get inside.

131
00:06:38,032 --> 00:06:41,117
Don't you ever
lift your hand to jenny again.

132
00:06:41,152 --> 00:06:42,368
Look, you just
listen to me.

133
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:44,253
I've got my
stomachful of you

134
00:06:44,288 --> 00:06:46,756
hanging around that girl,
turning her against me,

135
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:48,624
filling her head up
with crazy stuff.

136
00:06:49,258 --> 00:06:49,876
You hear me?

137
00:06:49,911 --> 00:06:51,761
You think i'm deaf?!

138
00:06:51,796 --> 00:06:53,012
I ain't
putting up with it.

139
00:06:53,047 --> 00:06:56,132
You even talk to her,
and i'll call the cops!

140
00:06:56,167 --> 00:06:57,383
Oh...

141
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:01,771
you bother us again,
that's what's going to happen.

142
00:07:01,806 --> 00:07:04,891
You hear me?!

143
00:07:08,644 --> 00:07:09,896
Now you get into bed.

144
00:07:09,931 --> 00:07:13,032
No supper for you tonight, miss.

145
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:23,659
Well?

146
00:07:23,694 --> 00:07:24,911
Excuse us, madam,

147
00:07:24,946 --> 00:07:28,047
we're gathering
information about a tenant.

148
00:07:28,082 --> 00:07:30,550
A man they call old ben-
you know him?

149
00:07:30,585 --> 00:07:32,418
You cops?

150
00:07:32,453 --> 00:07:33,669
In a way.

151
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:35,555
I knew it.

152
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:36,806
May we come in?

153
00:07:36,841 --> 00:07:38,057
Sure.

154
00:07:41,177 --> 00:07:42,428
What'd he do?

155
00:07:42,463 --> 00:07:44,313
We'll ask the questions.

156
00:07:44,348 --> 00:07:46,816
All right, got to
come in the kitchen.

157
00:07:46,851 --> 00:07:48,067
I'm fixing supper.

158
00:07:48,684 --> 00:07:50,570
How long has he
lived here?

159
00:07:50,605 --> 00:07:52,438
This building?
A year and a half.

160
00:07:52,473 --> 00:07:54,941
Do you know
his previous address?

161
00:07:54,976 --> 00:07:56,826
Mister, we don't
know nothing

162
00:07:57,193 --> 00:07:57,827
about him-

163
00:07:58,444 --> 00:08:00,947
where he comes from,
what his name is... nothing!

164
00:08:00,982 --> 00:08:02,198
Ever seen him

165
00:08:02,233 --> 00:08:04,083
do anything unusual?

166
00:08:04,118 --> 00:08:05,334
Like what?

167
00:08:05,369 --> 00:08:06,586
Like magic.

168
00:08:06,621 --> 00:08:09,088
Nah, kids say he's
good at tricks,

169
00:08:09,123 --> 00:08:10,957
but i never seen any.

170
00:08:33,264 --> 00:08:34,363
Ben?

171
00:08:34,398 --> 00:08:36,232
Jenny?

172
00:08:36,267 --> 00:08:37,483
Oh, ben.

173
00:08:38,734 --> 00:08:41,237
What's the matter,
what's wrong?

174
00:08:41,272 --> 00:08:43,122
Two policemen
downstairs.

175
00:08:43,157 --> 00:08:44,373
They're after you.

176
00:08:44,408 --> 00:08:45,625
I didn't think she'd do it.

177
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,493
Aunt agnes didn't call.

178
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:49,378
They came right
after you left.

179
00:08:49,413 --> 00:08:51,247
What'd they look like?

180
00:08:51,282 --> 00:08:53,883
I just saw a bit of
them in the kitchen.

181
00:08:53,918 --> 00:08:55,134
Tall...

182
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:56,752
one had blond hair

183
00:08:56,787 --> 00:08:58,638
and the other
was dark-haired.

184
00:08:58,673 --> 00:08:59,889
That's them.

185
00:08:59,924 --> 00:09:01,140
They've caught up with me.

186
00:09:01,757 --> 00:09:02,391
Who has?

187
00:09:02,426 --> 00:09:04,260
What are you scared of?

188
00:09:04,295 --> 00:09:05,511
I can't tell you.

189
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:07,396
I thought we
were friends.
We are.

190
00:09:07,431 --> 00:09:08,648
Friends don't
keep secrets.

191
00:09:08,683 --> 00:09:10,516
I don't even know
where you come from

192
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:11,767
or why you're
running away.

193
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:13,653
Jenny!

194
00:09:13,688 --> 00:09:15,271
Jenny, where are you?

195
00:09:18,407 --> 00:09:20,276
I'm sorry,
little monkey,

196
00:09:20,311 --> 00:09:22,161
but, well,
it doesn't matter.

197
00:09:22,196 --> 00:09:24,030
Anyway, it's too late now.

198
00:09:24,065 --> 00:09:25,281
No, it isn't.

199
00:09:25,316 --> 00:09:27,783
You can hide someplace-

200
00:09:27,818 --> 00:09:30,286
under the bed,
or in the closet.

201
00:09:30,321 --> 00:09:32,788
They'll never find you.

202
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:58,230
All right,
where is he?

203
00:09:58,265 --> 00:09:58,864
I don't know.

204
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:00,116
You're lying.

205
00:10:00,151 --> 00:10:01,367
She knows
where he is.

206
00:10:01,402 --> 00:10:02,618
Do you, miss?

207
00:10:02,653 --> 00:10:05,738
No, i came up to see him
but he was gone.

208
00:10:05,773 --> 00:10:07,623
I think he's in the park.

209
00:10:07,658 --> 00:10:10,126
If you see him,
say nothing.

210
00:10:10,161 --> 00:10:11,994
I know to keep
my mouth shut.

211
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:13,879
Come on.

212
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:28,144
Well, thank you,
mrs. Gann.

213
00:10:28,179 --> 00:10:30,012
Any time,
gentlemen.

214
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:32,648
I ought to beat you
till you can't sit down

215
00:10:32,683 --> 00:10:33,899
but i won't
'cause i'm too tired.

216
00:10:34,517 --> 00:10:35,768
Now get in there
and go to bed,

217
00:10:35,803 --> 00:10:37,019
and i don't want
to hear a peep out of you.

218
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:42,024
And don't try sneaking out again
if you know what's good for you.

219
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:05,931
That fooled them,
whoever they are.

220
00:11:07,218 --> 00:11:08,434
Sure did.

221
00:11:08,469 --> 00:11:10,302
Did i tickle you there?

222
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:11,554
What i can't
understand is

223
00:11:11,589 --> 00:11:14,056
how you can change
the clothes, too.

224
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:15,307
It's all matter-

225
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:17,810
one molecular structure
is much like another.

226
00:11:17,845 --> 00:11:20,312
Speaking of changing clothes,
young lady,

227
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:22,198
you'd better
start wearing a dress

228
00:11:22,233 --> 00:11:23,449
or your aunt
will have a fit.

229
00:11:23,484 --> 00:11:25,951
Let her.

230
00:11:25,986 --> 00:11:27,953
Now, that isn't respectful,
jenny.

231
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:31,073
Remember that mrs. Gann
is a nervous person

232
00:11:31,108 --> 00:11:32,958
and isn't wholly responsible

233
00:11:32,993 --> 00:11:34,827
for her behavior.

234
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:36,078
Then who is?

235
00:11:36,113 --> 00:11:38,581
Well, i'm not too sure.

236
00:11:38,616 --> 00:11:41,717
In any case,
you try to forgive her.

237
00:11:43,586 --> 00:11:44,220
All right.

238
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:46,088
But what about you?

239
00:11:46,123 --> 00:11:47,973
What are you going to do?

240
00:11:49,225 --> 00:11:52,344
Ah, i wish i knew,
little monkey.

241
00:12:01,604 --> 00:12:02,855
Ben?

242
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:04,740
Yes?

243
00:12:04,775 --> 00:12:06,609
How come those men
are after you?

244
00:12:06,644 --> 00:12:08,494
Are you a criminal?

245
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:13,499
In a way, yes.

246
00:12:13,534 --> 00:12:16,001
What'd you do,
rob a bank?

247
00:12:16,036 --> 00:12:16,619
No.

248
00:12:16,654 --> 00:12:17,870
Kill somebody?

249
00:12:17,905 --> 00:12:19,121
No.

250
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:21,006
You must be a communist.

251
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:23,509
No, little monkey,
i'm not a communist.

252
00:12:23,544 --> 00:12:24,760
Then, what?!

253
00:12:24,795 --> 00:12:26,629
Shh!

254
00:12:36,138 --> 00:12:39,391
Ben, listen, why
don't you fool 'em?

255
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:41,894
Turn into a spider
or a cockroach.

256
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:44,396
They'd never
find you then.

257
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:46,899
I'm afraid they would.

258
00:12:46,934 --> 00:12:49,401
Those boys are pretty clever.

259
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:51,287
You see, jenny,

260
00:12:51,322 --> 00:12:54,406
my real shape, i mean,
the way i really look...

261
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:56,909
isn't this the way
you really look?

262
00:12:56,944 --> 00:12:58,794
No.

263
00:12:58,829 --> 00:13:01,297
Have i ever seen you
the way you really look?

264
00:13:01,332 --> 00:13:03,165
No.

265
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,668
Gee, i bet you're icky.

266
00:13:05,703 --> 00:13:08,170
Some found me
quite attractive.

267
00:13:08,205 --> 00:13:09,421
I want to see.

268
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:10,055
No.

269
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:11,307
Listen, jenny.

270
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:16,312
You've been very good
letting me keep my secrets.

271
00:13:16,347 --> 00:13:18,814
Now, i'm going to tell you
one of them.

272
00:13:18,849 --> 00:13:23,185
You see, i am not actually
a resident of this world.

273
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:23,819
Huh?

274
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:25,688
I'm from another planet.

275
00:13:25,723 --> 00:13:27,573
I knew it, i knew it.

276
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:30,075
Which one, mars?

277
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:32,578
No, you've never heard of it.

278
00:13:32,613 --> 00:13:36,332
Anyway, jenny, those two
men are trying to catch me

279
00:13:36,367 --> 00:13:38,200
so they can take me back.

280
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:39,451
'Cause of what you did?

281
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:43,205
Uh-huh, and i don't
want to go back.

282
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,959
But they've located me,
so the only thing i can do

283
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:50,713
is find another world
that i can hide in.

284
00:13:50,748 --> 00:13:53,849
You mean you're just
going to go away?

285
00:13:53,884 --> 00:13:56,352
I don't want to,
little monkey,

286
00:13:56,387 --> 00:13:59,471
but i have no choice.

287
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:05,728
Before i go, though,
there's one thing i want to do.

288
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:09,481
I'd have done it before,

289
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:11,984
but it would've shown them
where i was.

290
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:13,869
That doesn't matter anymore.

291
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:15,120
What do you mean?

292
00:14:15,155 --> 00:14:18,240
Let's take
this brace off.

293
00:14:18,275 --> 00:14:19,491
My brace?
Mm-hmm.

294
00:14:28,884 --> 00:14:31,387
Will it hurt?

295
00:14:31,422 --> 00:14:35,140
Be careful.

296
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,262
Now, close your eyes.

297
00:14:56,697 --> 00:14:59,164
Who're you talking to?

298
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:02,918
M... myself.

299
00:15:02,953 --> 00:15:06,038
Cut it out,
you'll go crazy that way.

300
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:20,803
Ben!

301
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:32,064
Ben, my leg-
ben, don't leave me!

302
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:33,949
Ben!

303
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:54,720
Jenny, how can you
walk without your brace?

304
00:15:54,755 --> 00:15:55,971
You get out
of my way.

305
00:15:56,006 --> 00:15:57,840
Where's ben?

306
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:59,725
I don't know-
i won't tell.

307
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:03,479
You made him leave
me- i hate you!

308
00:16:03,514 --> 00:16:04,730
No, don't.

309
00:16:04,765 --> 00:16:05,347
It's the only way.

310
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:50,392
She's all right,
isn't she, doc?

311
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:52,277
I'm afraid not.

312
00:16:52,312 --> 00:16:57,282
Well, what'd she want to go do
a stupid thing like that?

313
00:16:57,317 --> 00:16:58,534
Like what?

314
00:16:58,569 --> 00:17:01,653
Going downstairs without
her leg brace, that's what.

315
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:04,156
Whatever's wrong
with your niece

316
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:07,292
hasn't anything to
do with her legs.

317
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:11,046
Her legs seem to be
perfectly all right.

318
00:17:11,081 --> 00:17:14,166
Well, i don't know
what you're talking about.

319
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:19,171
The fact is your niece
is in serious condition.

320
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:24,176
You mean... she...
you mean she's going to die?

321
00:17:24,211 --> 00:17:27,930
If her pulse
gets any weaker.

322
00:17:27,965 --> 00:17:30,432
Well, what's
the matter with her?

323
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:34,820
Whatever it is, it's
beyond my knowledge.

324
00:17:34,855 --> 00:17:37,940
All we can do
now is wait.

325
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:43,579
Well...

326
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:51,763
hello, little monkey.

327
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:53,649
I thought you went away.

328
00:18:53,684 --> 00:18:54,266
I did.

329
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:56,151
But i couldn't
stay away

330
00:18:56,186 --> 00:18:58,020
from my best friend
for long.

331
00:18:58,055 --> 00:19:01,156
What seems to
be the matter?

332
00:19:01,191 --> 00:19:03,025
I don't know.

333
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:08,664
I saw those two policemen,
and then i fell down.

334
00:19:08,699 --> 00:19:09,915
Am i going to die, ben?

335
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:13,035
Yes, eventually,
but not right now.

336
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,920
Close your eyes.

337
00:19:46,201 --> 00:19:47,452
Feel better now?

338
00:19:47,487 --> 00:19:48,704
I feel wonderful.

339
00:19:48,739 --> 00:19:51,206
Thank you, ben.

340
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:55,577
Ben.

341
00:19:55,612 --> 00:20:00,582
I know; they're here.

342
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:02,968
Your your
majesty. Majesty.

343
00:20:03,003 --> 00:20:06,088
All right,
all right.

344
00:20:06,123 --> 00:20:07,973
It was a terrible
thing to do-

345
00:20:08,008 --> 00:20:09,224
hurting a little girl.

346
00:20:09,259 --> 00:20:11,727
We didn't want
to hurt her,
your majesty.

347
00:20:11,762 --> 00:20:15,480
We knew you'd come back
to make her well again.

348
00:20:15,515 --> 00:20:17,349
I understand,
but i still don't like it.

349
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:19,234
What's going on?

350
00:20:19,269 --> 00:20:21,103
What's this
"your majesty" stuff?

351
00:20:21,138 --> 00:20:22,354
Well, little monkey,

352
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:24,856
i have a
confession to make.

353
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:27,359
You see, i'm a fraud.

354
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:28,610
Huh?

355
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:29,861
I'm not really
a criminal.

356
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:32,364
And these men really
aren't policemen.

357
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:33,615
They're my subjects.

358
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:34,866
And, i regret to say

359
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:39,254
i am what you would
call their king.

360
00:20:39,289 --> 00:20:40,505
Aw, come on.

361
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:43,008
Cross my heart
and hope to die.

362
00:20:43,043 --> 00:20:44,259
Then what were you
running away for?

363
00:20:44,294 --> 00:20:47,262
Well, that is a little
hard to explain.

364
00:20:47,297 --> 00:20:51,016
You see, i really wasn't
cut out to be a king.

365
00:20:51,051 --> 00:20:53,518
All that fuss
and responsibility.

366
00:20:53,553 --> 00:20:54,770
Oh, i don't know.

367
00:20:54,805 --> 00:20:57,272
After the first
thousand years,

368
00:20:57,307 --> 00:20:59,141
it sort of got me down.

369
00:20:59,176 --> 00:21:02,277
And i knew i'd have at
least 4,000 years more

370
00:21:02,312 --> 00:21:06,031
before i'd be able to turn
the job over to someone else.

371
00:21:06,066 --> 00:21:07,282
So... whoosh!

372
00:21:07,317 --> 00:21:11,036
I took off.

373
00:21:11,071 --> 00:21:14,039
Jenny, i skeedaddled.

374
00:21:14,074 --> 00:21:15,290
Well, all i can say is

375
00:21:15,325 --> 00:21:17,159
you must have been
a pretty good king

376
00:21:17,194 --> 00:21:18,410
to cause all this trouble.

377
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:19,661
That's true, miss.

378
00:21:19,696 --> 00:21:21,413
He was the best of kings.

379
00:21:21,448 --> 00:21:23,915
That's why
we want him back.

380
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:26,418
We're as fond of him
as you are.

381
00:21:26,453 --> 00:21:28,420
But you can't have him back.

382
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:30,922
Ben-
i mean, your majesty-

383
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:34,676
you're not going away
with them, are you?

384
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:38,430
Oh, i guess i'll have to.

385
00:21:39,681 --> 00:21:43,435
Then take me with you.

386
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:45,320
It's impossible, sir.

387
00:21:45,355 --> 00:21:46,188
You know the rules.

388
00:21:46,223 --> 00:21:48,073
The council
would never permit it.

389
00:21:48,108 --> 00:21:51,076
Please, ben,
don't leave me.

390
00:21:51,111 --> 00:21:52,327
I love you, ben.

391
00:21:52,362 --> 00:21:54,196
I know.

392
00:21:54,231 --> 00:21:57,332
Oh, if there were
only some way.

393
00:21:59,201 --> 00:22:00,452
Ben?

394
00:22:00,487 --> 00:22:01,703
Yes?

395
00:22:11,631 --> 00:22:12,848
Gentlemen...

396
00:22:12,883 --> 00:22:14,716
i would like
one minute alone with jenny.

397
00:22:14,751 --> 00:22:17,219
Sir...

398
00:22:17,254 --> 00:22:19,971
i solemnly swear
by our fathers

399
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:21,857
i won't run away.

400
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,978
Very well.

401
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:28,864
One minute, your majesty.

402
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:30,866
Thank you.

403
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:09,271
Er, your...
your majesty?

404
00:23:09,306 --> 00:23:11,022
Yes?
Yes?

405
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:13,525
Oh, now this isn't fair
at all.

406
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,661
You can't do this to us,
your majesty...

407
00:23:16,696 --> 00:23:17,279
your majesty?

408
00:23:17,314 --> 00:23:20,415
Looks like you'll have to
take both of us.

409
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:22,284
The council
wouldn't like it

410
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:24,169
if you brought back
the wrong one.

411
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:32,043
Shall we go?

412
00:23:38,934 --> 00:23:41,436
Mrs. Gann will be in
for a big surprise

413
00:23:41,471 --> 00:23:44,556
when she finds this
under jenny's pillow.

414
00:23:44,591 --> 00:23:48,310
Because mrs. Gann has
more temper than imagination.

415
00:23:48,345 --> 00:23:52,063
She'll never dream that
this is a picture of old ben

416
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:53,949
as he really looks.

417
00:23:53,984 --> 00:23:56,451
And it will never occur to her

418
00:23:56,486 --> 00:23:59,571
that eventually her niece
will grow up to be

419
00:23:59,606 --> 00:24:01,456
an honest-to-goodness queen

420
00:24:01,491 --> 00:24:04,576
somewhere in the twilight zone.

421
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:11,800
Rod serling,
creator ofthe twilight zone,

422
00:24:11,835 --> 00:24:14,302
will tell you
about next week's story

423
00:24:14,337 --> 00:24:17,472
after this message.

424
00:24:17,507 --> 00:24:19,674
And now, mr. Serling.

425
00:24:19,709 --> 00:24:20,926
Next week, an excursion

426
00:24:20,961 --> 00:24:23,428
into a strange
and totally different dimension.

427
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:26,565
We'll bring you a story
by richard matheson

428
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,816
called "little girl lost."

429
00:24:27,851 --> 00:24:29,684
And this one, we guarantee,

430
00:24:29,719 --> 00:24:31,570
is not the kind
found in a police docket

431
00:24:31,605 --> 00:24:33,438
or in a missing persons bureau.

432
00:24:33,473 --> 00:24:35,323
When this little girl is lost,

433
00:24:35,358 --> 00:24:37,826
we're talking about
out of this world.

434
00:24:37,861 --> 00:24:40,328
I hope you can join us next week

435
00:24:40,363 --> 00:24:42,831
and find out
precisely where she's gone.

436
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:15,947
For our youngsters to be able
to design tomorrow's world,

437
00:25:15,982 --> 00:25:18,450
we'll need more and better
college facilities.

438
00:25:18,485 --> 00:25:21,570
Help the college
of your choice.
