1
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,063
You're traveling
through another dimension-

2
00:00:13,098 --> 00:00:16,199
a dimension not only of sight
and sound, but of mind.

3
00:00:16,234 --> 00:00:18,068
A journey into a wondrous land

4
00:00:18,103 --> 00:00:20,570
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

5
00:00:21,204 --> 00:00:23,073
That's the signpost up ahead.

6
00:00:23,108 --> 00:00:25,208
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

7
00:00:27,711 --> 00:00:30,213
Paper, paper,
get your paper!

8
00:00:31,464 --> 00:00:32,716
Get your paper!

9
00:00:32,751 --> 00:00:35,218
Paper!
Get your paper!

10
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:37,721
Paper, paper!

11
00:00:37,756 --> 00:00:38,972
Get your paper!

12
00:00:39,007 --> 00:00:40,840
Late sports final!

13
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:50,233
This must be
your lucky day, mister.

14
00:00:50,268 --> 00:00:52,102
That'll never
happen again

15
00:00:52,137 --> 00:00:53,353
in a million years.

16
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:03,363
You miserable,
dirty, lowdown...

17
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:09,002
if liz and eddie split up,
then liz can marry rock

18
00:01:09,037 --> 00:01:11,504
and eddie can marry tuesday.
Uh-huh.

19
00:01:12,756 --> 00:01:15,875
Oh, dear! Terribly sorry.

20
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:17,761
If he hits me, i'll die.

21
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:31,141
Easy, mister.

22
00:01:31,176 --> 00:01:33,026
Are you all right?

23
00:01:33,061 --> 00:01:34,277
Just lie still.

24
00:01:34,312 --> 00:01:36,146
We'll get a doctor.

25
00:01:36,181 --> 00:01:39,282
Doctor? Oh, no, no,
i don't need a doctor.

26
00:01:39,317 --> 00:01:41,151
Just help me up.

27
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:47,407
No broken bones...

28
00:01:47,442 --> 00:01:49,909
no scrapes
or scratches.

29
00:01:49,944 --> 00:01:51,795
I seem to
be all right.

30
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:54,297
You can't know
how sorry i am, sir.

31
00:01:54,332 --> 00:01:56,800
Well, there's
no harm done.

32
00:01:56,835 --> 00:01:59,302
If you were hurt,
i could never forgive myself.

33
00:01:59,337 --> 00:02:00,553
You clumsy idiot!

34
00:02:01,805 --> 00:02:03,673
I wish you'd broken
your fool neck.

35
00:02:04,307 --> 00:02:06,810
What did you say?

36
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:09,929
Are you certain
you're all right, sir?

37
00:02:10,563 --> 00:02:13,683
L-l-i think so.

38
00:02:13,718 --> 00:02:16,186
Thank heaven
for that.

39
00:02:16,221 --> 00:02:17,437
Lamebrain!

40
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:23,693
With your asinine jaywalking,
you took ten years off my life.

41
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:28,448
Mr. Hector b. Poole,

42
00:02:28,483 --> 00:02:30,700
resident of the twilight zone.

43
00:02:30,735 --> 00:02:32,585
Flip a coin
and keep flipping it.

44
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,454
What are the odds?

45
00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:37,590
Half the time it'll come up
heads, half the time tails.

46
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:40,710
But, in one freakish chance
in a million,

47
00:02:40,745 --> 00:02:42,595
it'll land on its edge.

48
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:45,715
Mr. Hector b. Poole,
a bright human coin

49
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,600
on his way to the bank.

50
00:02:57,977 --> 00:02:59,863
It's 9:10, hector.

51
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:10,740
Of course, felicia, baby.

52
00:03:10,775 --> 00:03:11,991
You know i love you.

53
00:03:12,026 --> 00:03:13,243
But how would it look?

54
00:03:13,278 --> 00:03:15,128
I can just see
the headlines now:

55
00:03:15,163 --> 00:03:18,248
"Prominent banker divorces wife
to marry chorus girl."

56
00:03:18,283 --> 00:03:21,384
Oh, no, no, no, felicia, baby,
you misunderstand.

57
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:23,253
I didn't mean it
the way it sounded.

58
00:03:23,288 --> 00:03:25,138
Yes, yes, yes, that's right.

59
00:03:25,173 --> 00:03:27,006
Look, how about
this weekend, huh?

60
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,892
Just you and me, huh?

61
00:03:30,178 --> 00:03:31,394
Yeah, yeah. Come in.

62
00:03:31,429 --> 00:03:33,897
Hold on. There's
somebody at the door.

63
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:35,765
Yes, uh... what
is it, poole?

64
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,268
Mr. Bagby, i would
like to explain

65
00:03:38,303 --> 00:03:40,153
why i was late
this morning.

66
00:03:40,188 --> 00:03:41,404
Yes.

67
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:44,524
Sir, a very strange thing
happened this morning. I...

68
00:03:44,559 --> 00:03:45,775
well, as you know, sir,

69
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:48,278
my record for
promptness is spotless.

70
00:03:48,313 --> 00:03:50,780
I pride myself on
my attention to duty.

71
00:03:50,815 --> 00:03:53,666
Yes, poole, we're all aware
of your devotion to the bank.

72
00:03:53,701 --> 00:03:55,535
Get on with it,
you simpering idiot.

73
00:03:56,786 --> 00:03:59,289
Do you think she's going
to stay on the line forever?

74
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:04,928
If you ruin
my weekend,

75
00:04:04,963 --> 00:04:07,430
i'll string you up
by the thumbs.

76
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:13,686
Your weekend, sir?
Spoil your weekend?

77
00:04:13,937 --> 00:04:15,805
What are you mumbling about?

78
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,439
Weekend?!

79
00:04:17,056 --> 00:04:18,308
Can he know about felicia?

80
00:04:18,343 --> 00:04:19,559
Impossible!

81
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:21,945
I've been
so careful.

82
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,446
So discreet.

83
00:04:25,949 --> 00:04:27,817
You had something
to tell me, poole?

84
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:31,571
Poole?

85
00:04:32,822 --> 00:04:34,073
Poole!

86
00:04:45,969 --> 00:04:48,471
Those dodgers think
they can steal second

87
00:04:48,506 --> 00:04:50,340
any time they want.

88
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:52,225
Well, they won't steal
a bag of popcorn

89
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,727
with that southpaw
pitching today.

90
00:04:54,762 --> 00:04:55,979
Whois
pitching today?

91
00:04:56,014 --> 00:04:59,098
What? What did
you say, hector?

92
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:00,984
Oh, nothing.
Nothing at all.

93
00:05:03,486 --> 00:05:04,737
Good morning, sir.

94
00:05:04,772 --> 00:05:06,606
Everything in
apple pie order, i trust?

95
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:08,491
Yes. Thank
you very much.

96
00:05:08,526 --> 00:05:10,360
I'll bet this
grinning ape

97
00:05:10,994 --> 00:05:14,113
is the one who sent me
that overdrawn notice.

98
00:05:14,148 --> 00:05:15,999
No, sir.
I work over there

99
00:05:16,034 --> 00:05:17,867
in the accounts section.

100
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:42,025
Poor mr. Poole.

101
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,527
He looks
tired and pale.

102
00:05:49,532 --> 00:05:51,401
Mr. Poole?

103
00:05:52,402 --> 00:05:53,653
Mr. Poole.

104
00:05:55,405 --> 00:05:57,907
You know mr. Sykes
of ajax cement?

105
00:05:57,942 --> 00:06:00,660
Yes, yes, mr. Sykes.

106
00:06:00,695 --> 00:06:03,663
His loan has
been approved.

107
00:06:04,914 --> 00:06:06,165
Will you see

108
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,051
that the papers
are properly signed?

109
00:06:08,086 --> 00:06:10,553
Also that the
check is made out?

110
00:06:10,588 --> 00:06:11,804
Certainly, mr. Graham.

111
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:13,673
Won't you sit
down, mr. Sykes?

112
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:14,307
Thank you.

113
00:06:14,342 --> 00:06:16,809
Oh, a business loan
for $200,000.

114
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:18,061
That's quite a sum.

115
00:06:18,096 --> 00:06:19,178
You expanding,
mr. Sykes?

116
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:21,064
That's right.

117
00:06:21,099 --> 00:06:22,932
That's wrong.

118
00:06:23,566 --> 00:06:25,435
Well, which is it?

119
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:26,686
Pardon me.

120
00:06:26,721 --> 00:06:28,571
Oh... nothing.

121
00:06:28,606 --> 00:06:30,440
Uh... mr. Sykes,
you are aware

122
00:06:30,475 --> 00:06:32,942
that this loan must
be completely repaid

123
00:06:32,977 --> 00:06:34,193
within 90 days.

124
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:35,445
I certainly am.

125
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,696
If i bet
the money right,

126
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,198
it could come to
well over a million.

127
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:41,084
I could pay
back the loan

128
00:06:41,119 --> 00:06:44,203
and have enough to keep
ajax out of bankruptcy.

129
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:45,455
I'll put half of it

130
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:47,340
on lucky lady
in the sixth

131
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:49,208
and split the rest

132
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:52,345
between nimble runner and
crinoline at five to one.

133
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,213
Nimble runner?

134
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:56,099
Five to one?

135
00:06:56,134 --> 00:06:57,967
What did you say?

136
00:06:58,002 --> 00:06:59,102
Now, look here,
young man!

137
00:06:59,137 --> 00:07:00,970
Oh, mr. Sykes, i was
just trying to...

138
00:07:01,005 --> 00:07:03,473
what's going on, mr. Poole?
Anything wrong, mr. Sykes?

139
00:07:03,508 --> 00:07:05,358
Well, mr. Bagby,
he just told me

140
00:07:05,393 --> 00:07:07,226
he's borrowing this money
to bet on the horses.

141
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:08,478
I said nothing
of the kind!

142
00:07:08,513 --> 00:07:09,729
Nimble runner,
five to one.

143
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:10,980
He's mad!

144
00:07:11,015 --> 00:07:12,865
Poole! Doubtless
there's been a mistake.

145
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,368
Well, there certainly
has been a mistake.

146
00:07:15,403 --> 00:07:17,870
If you'll come into my office,
i'll correct it at once.

147
00:07:17,905 --> 00:07:19,739
I'll talk to you
later, poole.

148
00:07:19,774 --> 00:07:21,624
Mr. Bagby...

149
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,749
poor mr. Poole.

150
00:07:29,784 --> 00:07:32,251
You do all the work
around here,

151
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:34,754
and get none
of the credit.

152
00:07:38,508 --> 00:07:41,644
You should speak up more,
and assert yourself.

153
00:07:44,147 --> 00:07:45,515
But i guess that's not
in your nature.

154
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,902
But i hope mr. Bagby
is easy on you.

155
00:07:49,937 --> 00:07:51,771
Good morning,
mr. Poole.

156
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:06,169
Miss turner...

157
00:08:06,204 --> 00:08:08,671
yes, mr. Poole?

158
00:08:08,706 --> 00:08:13,042
Well, uh, please don't
be offended but, um...

159
00:08:13,077 --> 00:08:16,796
well, i, uh, i would
like to thank you

160
00:08:16,831 --> 00:08:19,932
for your, uh...
kind thoughts.

161
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,184
Well, i don't think

162
00:08:21,219 --> 00:08:23,052
i quite understand,
mr. Poole.

163
00:08:23,087 --> 00:08:24,937
Romancing the help,
mr. Poole?

164
00:08:24,972 --> 00:08:26,806
Well, who can blame you?

165
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:28,691
Miss turner
is the prettiest girl

166
00:08:28,726 --> 00:08:30,560
in the accounts section.

167
00:08:30,595 --> 00:08:33,062
Which is saying
absolutely nothing.

168
00:08:33,097 --> 00:08:35,948
I haven't seen such
an aggregation of beasts

169
00:08:35,983 --> 00:08:38,451
since the last time
i went to the circus.

170
00:08:38,486 --> 00:08:40,319
Not much chance
for socializing

171
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:42,205
around a bank,
is there?

172
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,073
This one is
probably a tiger

173
00:08:44,108 --> 00:08:45,958
under the proper
conditions.

174
00:08:45,993 --> 00:08:49,078
All the sweet,
prim types revert

175
00:08:49,113 --> 00:08:51,581
to the jungle
once more.

176
00:08:56,586 --> 00:08:58,471
You did that
deliberately.

177
00:08:58,506 --> 00:08:59,722
Well...

178
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:03,476
i'll see you
later about this.

179
00:09:03,511 --> 00:09:05,344
Good for you!

180
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:08,481
He certainly
had it coming.

181
00:09:08,516 --> 00:09:11,601
I suppose i should
get back to my desk.

182
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,874
401, 402, 403...

183
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:40,513
20 years at
the same desk.

184
00:09:40,548 --> 00:09:43,015
It isn't fair.

185
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,884
Ah, but they'll
be sorry

186
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:47,386
for their
treatment of me.

187
00:09:53,643 --> 00:09:54,894
Yes...

188
00:09:56,145 --> 00:09:58,030
at 4:30 this afternoon,

189
00:09:58,065 --> 00:10:01,784
i'll go into the vault
like i always do.

190
00:10:01,819 --> 00:10:04,904
I'll take my
briefcase with me,

191
00:10:04,939 --> 00:10:08,040
and no one will
suspect a thing.

192
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,914
I'll fill my briefcase
with currency,

193
00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:18,668
and be on ship to bermuda
by nightfall.

194
00:10:18,703 --> 00:10:21,170
They'll all be sorry.

195
00:10:21,205 --> 00:10:23,055
Yes, indeed.

196
00:10:24,307 --> 00:10:26,809
I wonder how long
it will take them

197
00:10:26,844 --> 00:10:29,929
to discover that
the money is gone.

198
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:44,360
Good night.

199
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:46,862
Good night.

200
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:52,868
Hector.

201
00:10:55,371 --> 00:10:57,873
Well, one more
day nearly done,

202
00:10:57,908 --> 00:11:00,376
and no notches
on the gun.

203
00:11:00,411 --> 00:11:02,878
You wouldn't use
that gun, would you?

204
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:05,381
What do you think i got it
on my belt for, hector?

205
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:06,632
Hold up my pants?

206
00:11:20,529 --> 00:11:21,781
Miss turner...

207
00:11:21,816 --> 00:11:23,649
may i talk to you
for a moment?

208
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:26,786
What i have to tell
you is very important.

209
00:11:28,037 --> 00:11:30,539
Yes, mr. Poole?

210
00:11:30,574 --> 00:11:31,157
Well...

211
00:11:31,192 --> 00:11:33,659
i wish we could
talk someplace

212
00:11:33,694 --> 00:11:35,544
where it's
more private.

213
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:37,413
Mr. Jones'
office is empty

214
00:11:37,448 --> 00:11:39,298
since his transfer.

215
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:41,167
That is a good idea!

216
00:11:47,423 --> 00:11:48,674
Is something wrong?

217
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:50,559
Dreadfully wrong.

218
00:11:50,594 --> 00:11:53,062
Miss turner, i keep hearing voices
- people talking.

219
00:11:53,097 --> 00:11:54,313
Their lips don't move,

220
00:11:54,348 --> 00:11:56,182
but i can hear
their words clearly.

221
00:11:56,217 --> 00:11:58,434
I've got this
ringing in my head.

222
00:11:58,469 --> 00:12:02,188
Miss turner, i can
read people's minds.

223
00:12:02,223 --> 00:12:04,073
Think something,
anything at all.

224
00:12:04,108 --> 00:12:05,941
This is a strange
approach.

225
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:08,444
Why did it
take him so long

226
00:12:08,479 --> 00:12:10,329
to gather up
his courage?

227
00:12:10,364 --> 00:12:12,832
Well, it just
happened this morning.

228
00:12:12,867 --> 00:12:15,334
Now, miss turner,
you may think that...

229
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:20,956
you may think that
i'm crazy but, uh...

230
00:12:20,991 --> 00:12:22,842
i have reason
to believe

231
00:12:22,877 --> 00:12:24,710
that someone plans

232
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:27,213
to rob the bank
this afternoon.

233
00:12:27,248 --> 00:12:30,716
Oh, well, if someone's going
to rob the bank this afternoon,

234
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:33,219
you should do
something about it.

235
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:36,972
But what if i'm
wrong, miss turner?

236
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:40,109
You have a responsibility
to the bank.

237
00:12:40,144 --> 00:12:43,229
To the stockholders
and depositors.

238
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:48,868
I'd better talk to
mr. Bagby right away.

239
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:56,992
What is this,
poole?

240
00:12:57,027 --> 00:12:58,878
I'm worried
about you.

241
00:12:58,913 --> 00:13:00,129
I've always
considered you

242
00:13:00,164 --> 00:13:01,380
one of my best men.

243
00:13:01,415 --> 00:13:03,249
Why, poole?
Tell me why.

244
00:13:03,284 --> 00:13:05,134
We lost the ajax
cement account

245
00:13:05,169 --> 00:13:07,002
because of
your nonsense.

246
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:08,888
Something
wrong at home?

247
00:13:08,923 --> 00:13:10,756
Something bothering
you, poole?

248
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,007
Come on, tell me.

249
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:13,259
I don't quite know

250
00:13:13,294 --> 00:13:15,144
how to tell you
this, mr. Bagby.

251
00:13:15,179 --> 00:13:16,395
Speak up, poole.

252
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:17,646
We're all with you.

253
00:13:17,681 --> 00:13:19,515
You won't believe it!

254
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:22,017
Nonsense. Of course,
i'll believe it.

255
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:23,269
Tell me anything.
Feel free.

256
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:27,656
Mr. Bagby...

257
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:35,164
mr. Smithers is planning
to rob the bank!

258
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:37,666
What did you say?

259
00:13:37,701 --> 00:13:40,786
Mr. Smithers is sitting
at his desk right now,

260
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:42,037
planning to
rob the bank.

261
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:43,923
Well, i...

262
00:13:45,174 --> 00:13:47,042
old mr. Smithers?

263
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:48,928
Old mr. Smithers.

264
00:13:48,963 --> 00:13:50,179
At exactly 4:30,

265
00:13:50,214 --> 00:13:52,681
he's going to
go to the vault,

266
00:13:52,716 --> 00:13:53,933
fill his briefcase,

267
00:13:53,968 --> 00:13:57,052
then he's taking
a boat trip to bermuda.

268
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:59,555
Tonight!

269
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:01,440
Smithers is one
of our oldest

270
00:14:01,475 --> 00:14:03,943
and most trusted
employees.

271
00:14:03,978 --> 00:14:06,445
He was here
when i came here.

272
00:14:07,696 --> 00:14:10,816
I absolutely refuse
to believe that...

273
00:14:15,571 --> 00:14:16,822
hold it.

274
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:18,707
Wait a minute.

275
00:14:18,742 --> 00:14:22,461
Who's the man who ends up
stealing the company funds?

276
00:14:22,496 --> 00:14:25,581
Isn't it always
the most trusted employee?

277
00:14:25,616 --> 00:14:27,466
The man you least suspect?

278
00:14:27,501 --> 00:14:29,969
The man who's been
reliable for years

279
00:14:30,004 --> 00:14:33,088
until that one moment
when everybody relaxes?

280
00:14:35,591 --> 00:14:37,476
Good man, poole.

281
00:14:37,511 --> 00:14:38,727
I wish it weren't
true, mr. Bagby.

282
00:14:38,762 --> 00:14:40,596
I've always admired
mr. Smithers.

283
00:14:40,631 --> 00:14:41,847
I wouldn't have
believed it

284
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:43,732
if i hadn't overheard
him planning it myself.

285
00:14:43,767 --> 00:14:44,984
No time
for sentiment, now.

286
00:14:45,601 --> 00:14:46,852
Quick, now.
What's his plan?

287
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:48,737
Well, at
exactly 4:30...

288
00:14:48,772 --> 00:14:50,606
it's time.

289
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:04,753
He's going to close
the drawers on his desk...

290
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:09,258
close up his books...

291
00:15:11,126 --> 00:15:13,012
he'll stand up.

292
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,765
He'll pick up
his briefcase.

293
00:15:19,268 --> 00:15:22,271
He'll go to the vault to check
up, just as he always does.

294
00:15:26,642 --> 00:15:28,527
He'll be back
there alone,

295
00:15:28,562 --> 00:15:31,030
only this time things
will be different.

296
00:15:35,784 --> 00:15:37,036
When he comes out,

297
00:15:37,071 --> 00:15:42,041
his briefcase will be
packed to the brim with...

298
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:45,294
jim.

299
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:03,679
Here, here.
What the...?

300
00:16:03,714 --> 00:16:06,181
Just open the briefcase
and dump the contents here.

301
00:16:06,815 --> 00:16:08,183
Your great mistake,
mr. Smithers,

302
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:09,435
is assuming that
we were all asleep.

303
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:10,819
A very great mistake!

304
00:16:10,854 --> 00:16:12,071
As a matter of fact,

305
00:16:12,106 --> 00:16:13,322
i've had my eye on you

306
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:14,690
for a long time.

307
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:18,444
Travel folders...

308
00:16:18,479 --> 00:16:19,695
a sandwich...

309
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,334
socks.

310
00:16:25,369 --> 00:16:27,202
Where's the money?

311
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:29,588
Is everyone going insane?

312
00:16:29,623 --> 00:16:30,839
What money?

313
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:33,709
Poole...

314
00:16:36,211 --> 00:16:38,714
where's that idiot poole?

315
00:16:40,849 --> 00:16:42,718
Here, sir.

316
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:48,974
He was going
to steal the money.

317
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:50,859
He was going to take
a boat to bermuda.

318
00:16:50,894 --> 00:16:52,728
That was the story, huh?

319
00:16:52,763 --> 00:16:53,979
Well, mr. Bagby,
i heard him.

320
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:56,482
And who was he talking
to, mr. Poole?

321
00:16:56,517 --> 00:16:58,367
Well, he wasn't exactly
talking to anyone.

322
00:16:58,402 --> 00:17:00,869
He was... well,
he was thinking.

323
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:05,874
Please forgive us all,
mr. Smithers.

324
00:17:05,909 --> 00:17:07,126
I should have
known immediately

325
00:17:07,161 --> 00:17:10,245
that what i was told was
impossible on the face of it.

326
00:17:10,879 --> 00:17:12,131
Poole?

327
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:13,382
I'm fired.

328
00:17:13,417 --> 00:17:13,999
That's right.

329
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:15,884
Clean out your desk
at once.

330
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:26,512
Mr. Smithers, i don't
know what to say.

331
00:17:26,547 --> 00:17:27,513
I...

332
00:17:27,548 --> 00:17:29,398
i am sorry.

333
00:17:31,266 --> 00:17:33,769
How did you know?

334
00:17:33,804 --> 00:17:35,654
How did you
know, mr. Poole?

335
00:17:35,689 --> 00:17:37,523
It's true,
of course.

336
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:40,659
I was thinking of
filling my briefcase

337
00:17:40,694 --> 00:17:42,528
with the
bank's money.

338
00:17:42,563 --> 00:17:43,779
Yes.

339
00:17:44,413 --> 00:17:46,281
It's a little
dream of mine.

340
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:48,784
Have you ever had
a dream, mr. Poole?

341
00:17:48,819 --> 00:17:50,285
I have.

342
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,922
I don't always plan
on bermuda though.

343
00:17:53,957 --> 00:17:56,425
Sometimes, it's siam, fiji.

344
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,293
Beautiful,
exotic places

345
00:17:58,328 --> 00:18:00,796
where there are
no books to keep.

346
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:05,184
Where i'm not a little man
with no future and no past.

347
00:18:06,301 --> 00:18:08,804
Yes, mr. Poole...

348
00:18:11,306 --> 00:18:12,558
yes.

349
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:16,311
But i'll never
go through with it.

350
00:18:16,346 --> 00:18:18,197
You know why?

351
00:18:18,232 --> 00:18:21,316
I've lived with
it too long.

352
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:23,819
I'm old and
set in my ways.

353
00:18:23,854 --> 00:18:26,955
And besides,
mr. Poole...

354
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:29,458
i guess i'm a coward.

355
00:18:50,095 --> 00:18:52,598
It doesn't matter,
mr. Poole.

356
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:55,100
A man with
your ability...

357
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:59,488
hearing people's thoughts-
strange delusion.

358
00:18:59,523 --> 00:19:01,990
But, with proper
medical care,

359
00:19:02,025 --> 00:19:03,859
it will go away.

360
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:06,995
Miss turner, it
is not a delusion!

361
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:09,498
There. You see?

362
00:19:09,533 --> 00:19:10,749
Icanread
your thoughts.

363
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:13,869
Until this morning,

364
00:19:13,904 --> 00:19:17,005
everything was
normal. I washappy.

365
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:20,759
At least i wasn't
unhappy. And now this!

366
00:19:20,794 --> 00:19:24,513
It's like seeing people
with their clothes off.

367
00:19:24,548 --> 00:19:27,633
I never imagined
people were like that.

368
00:19:27,668 --> 00:19:28,884
You know, we do things

369
00:19:29,518 --> 00:19:32,020
without thinking
about them at all.

370
00:19:32,055 --> 00:19:35,140
And we think things
without having the...

371
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:37,643
slightest intention
of doing them.

372
00:19:37,678 --> 00:19:40,145
Well, at least i've
learned one thing:

373
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:43,282
People are not like you
think they are at all.

374
00:19:43,899 --> 00:19:45,150
Mr. Poole! Thank heavens
i caught you.

375
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:46,401
Ajax cement
was just on the phone.

376
00:19:47,035 --> 00:19:48,287
Mr. Sykes
has been arrested...

377
00:19:48,322 --> 00:19:50,155
for gambling with company monies.

378
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,040
Yes, i know,
mr. Bagby.

379
00:19:52,075 --> 00:19:53,292
I tried to tell
you that earlier.

380
00:19:53,327 --> 00:19:55,794
$200,000. if that loan
had gone through...

381
00:19:55,829 --> 00:19:57,663
pardon me.

382
00:19:57,698 --> 00:19:59,548
Uh, poole...
about your job.

383
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:02,668
It's still available
if you're interested.

384
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:05,804
If you can really
hear me, hector,

385
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:07,172
you're wasted in that job.

386
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:09,057
Everyone knows
you should be in charge

387
00:20:09,092 --> 00:20:10,926
of the accounts
section.

388
00:20:10,961 --> 00:20:13,428
What do you say, poole?

389
00:20:15,931 --> 00:20:17,816
Mr. Bagby...

390
00:20:17,851 --> 00:20:21,570
everyone knows i should be in
charge of the accounts section.

391
00:20:21,605 --> 00:20:22,821
What?!

392
00:20:22,856 --> 00:20:23,822
And that would mean

393
00:20:23,857 --> 00:20:26,325
he'd move into
mr. Jones' old office.

394
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,576
That'd mean he'd...

395
00:20:27,611 --> 00:20:30,078
i'd move into mr.
Jones' old office.

396
00:20:30,113 --> 00:20:31,830
Now, look!

397
00:20:31,865 --> 00:20:32,831
This is absurd.

398
00:20:32,866 --> 00:20:35,951
What am i standing
here wasting time for?

399
00:20:36,585 --> 00:20:38,453
Felicia is
waiting for me.

400
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:42,207
Man, oh, man, what a weekend
this is going to be!

401
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:44,092
Now, see here, poole!

402
00:20:44,127 --> 00:20:46,595
Don't let him
bamboozle you.

403
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:47,846
Stand up to him.

404
00:20:47,881 --> 00:20:50,349
He needs you more
than you need him.

405
00:20:50,384 --> 00:20:52,217
Mr. Bagby...

406
00:20:54,102 --> 00:20:56,605
let's get down to
business, shall we?

407
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,856
Business?

408
00:20:57,891 --> 00:20:59,725
What business?

409
00:21:00,976 --> 00:21:04,730
The business of
felicia and your wife.

410
00:21:04,765 --> 00:21:06,615
Yes, i know all
about it, mr. Bagby.

411
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:09,735
I know where you're
meeting her and when.

412
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:12,871
Impossible. No one
knows about the trip.

413
00:21:12,906 --> 00:21:14,122
The trip, mr. Bagby?

414
00:21:14,157 --> 00:21:16,625
A word to the wise.
Am i right?

415
00:21:19,127 --> 00:21:22,247
All right,
poole, you win-.

416
00:21:22,282 --> 00:21:24,750
In charge of the
accounts division,

417
00:21:24,785 --> 00:21:26,001
and office
next to mine.

418
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:29,638
You won't say anything,
to anybody, will you?

419
00:21:29,673 --> 00:21:30,889
Not a word.

420
00:21:30,924 --> 00:21:33,392
Not, not, not, not
a word, mr. Bagby.

421
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:42,017
Mr. Bagby, um...
there is one more thing.

422
00:21:42,052 --> 00:21:45,153
At the bank's expense,
i'd like you to buy

423
00:21:45,188 --> 00:21:47,022
a round-trip ticket
to bermuda.

424
00:21:47,057 --> 00:21:48,907
I'd like you to
have it made out

425
00:21:48,942 --> 00:21:50,776
in the name
of l.j. Smithers.

426
00:21:50,811 --> 00:21:52,027
I think
he'd like that.

427
00:21:52,062 --> 00:21:53,278
Are you out
of your mind?

428
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:55,781
Mr. Bagby,
remember.

429
00:21:57,666 --> 00:21:59,534
One ticket
to bermuda.

430
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:09,294
Shall we leave,
miss turner?

431
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:10,545
I'd go anywhere
with you,

432
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:13,048
but i wish you'd
call me helen.

433
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:15,550
May i see you
home... helen?

434
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:19,938
Of course,
you can, hector.

435
00:22:19,973 --> 00:22:22,441
What do you think
i waited for?

436
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:32,451
Paper! Get your
late afternoon paper!

437
00:22:32,486 --> 00:22:34,953
Latest stocks!

438
00:22:34,988 --> 00:22:36,204
Paper!

439
00:22:38,957 --> 00:22:40,208
Why'd you do that?

440
00:22:40,243 --> 00:22:43,328
I've had that coin
standing there all day long,

441
00:22:43,363 --> 00:22:45,831
and nobody even
touched it until...

442
00:22:45,866 --> 00:22:46,465
oh, hey, it's you-
same guy.

443
00:22:47,082 --> 00:22:48,333
What do you think
about that?

444
00:22:48,368 --> 00:22:50,836
You're the guy
who stood it up,

445
00:22:50,871 --> 00:22:52,721
and you just
knocked it down.

446
00:22:52,756 --> 00:22:53,972
Talk about
coincidence.

447
00:22:54,007 --> 00:22:55,841
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

448
00:22:55,876 --> 00:22:56,475
Listen...

449
00:22:57,726 --> 00:22:58,977
it's gone.

450
00:23:00,228 --> 00:23:01,480
It's gone!

451
00:23:02,731 --> 00:23:04,599
Helen, helen,
think something.

452
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:06,485
Think something!

453
00:23:07,736 --> 00:23:10,238
Helen, i can't
hear anything.

454
00:23:10,273 --> 00:23:10,856
I think it's gone.

455
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:12,107
Isn't that great?

456
00:23:12,142 --> 00:23:13,992
Isn't it wonderful?

457
00:23:22,117 --> 00:23:23,368
Nothing.

458
00:23:29,624 --> 00:23:31,510
Helen... helen!

459
00:23:33,378 --> 00:23:34,629
Helen, listen.

460
00:23:37,766 --> 00:23:39,017
I can't hear anything.

461
00:23:39,052 --> 00:23:42,137
I can't hear a thing
you're thinking.

462
00:23:44,022 --> 00:23:44,639
Can't you?

463
00:23:47,776 --> 00:23:53,398
One time in a million,
a coin will land on its edge.

464
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:57,786
But all it takes to knock
it over is a vagrant breeze,

465
00:23:57,821 --> 00:24:00,288
a vibration or a slight blow.

466
00:24:00,323 --> 00:24:05,293
Hector b. Poole, a human coin
on edge for a brief time...

467
00:24:05,328 --> 00:24:07,162
in the twilight zone.

468
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,504
Rod serling,
the creator oftwilight zone,

469
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:17,389
will tell you
about next week's story

470
00:24:17,424 --> 00:24:20,826
after this word
from our alternate sponsor.

471
00:24:20,861 --> 00:24:22,427
And now, mr. Serling.

472
00:24:22,462 --> 00:24:24,312
This is room 22.

473
00:24:24,347 --> 00:24:26,181
And, on the other side
of its doors lies an adventure

474
00:24:26,216 --> 00:24:29,317
that is as fascinating
as it is inexplicable.

475
00:24:29,352 --> 00:24:31,820
It's a story that comes to us
from mr. Bennett cerf,

476
00:24:31,855 --> 00:24:33,688
who describes it
as an age-old horror tale

477
00:24:33,723 --> 00:24:35,574
whose origin is unknown.

478
00:24:35,609 --> 00:24:38,076
We've dressed it up
in some hospital wrappings,

479
00:24:38,111 --> 00:24:39,945
and enlisted the performance
of miss barbara nichols.

480
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:42,447
Next onthe twilight zone,"22."

481
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:44,332
Be prepared to be spooked.

482
00:24:44,367 --> 00:24:46,585
It's that kind of story.
