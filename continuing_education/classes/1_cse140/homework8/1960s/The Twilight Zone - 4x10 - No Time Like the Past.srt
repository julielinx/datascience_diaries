1
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:10,643
You unlock this door
with the key of imagination.

2
00:00:10,678 --> 00:00:13,146
Beyond it is another dimension-

3
00:00:13,181 --> 00:00:15,648
a dimension of sound,

4
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:17,534
a dimension of sight,

5
00:00:17,569 --> 00:00:19,402
a dimension of mind.

6
00:00:19,437 --> 00:00:22,539
You're moving into a land
of both shadow and substance,

7
00:00:22,574 --> 00:00:23,790
of things and ideas.

8
00:00:23,825 --> 00:00:27,544
You've just crossed over
into the twilight zone.

9
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,920
Harvey?

10
00:00:36,955 --> 00:00:39,422
What's the monitor
picture now?

11
00:00:46,062 --> 00:00:47,931
Still distorted.

12
00:00:47,966 --> 00:00:51,684
And we've got
six or seven minutes left.

13
00:00:55,438 --> 00:00:56,689
What guarantee do you have

14
00:00:56,724 --> 00:00:59,826
that you'll reach the point
that you want to?

15
00:00:59,861 --> 00:01:01,077
No guarantee at all.

16
00:01:01,112 --> 00:01:04,197
But if i fail, you simply
mark off one man

17
00:01:04,232 --> 00:01:05,448
one insignificant human

18
00:01:05,483 --> 00:01:07,951
one frail, protesting member
of the race.

19
00:01:08,585 --> 00:01:10,453
If i do fail

20
00:01:10,488 --> 00:01:14,841
if i end up in hell or limbo,
or the cemetery

21
00:01:14,876 --> 00:01:17,343
the responsibility
is exclusively mine.

22
00:01:17,378 --> 00:01:19,846
You can rest easy
on this fact.

23
00:01:19,881 --> 00:01:22,348
Feeling pretty secure, paul?

24
00:01:22,383 --> 00:01:25,468
You sound funereal, harvey.

25
00:01:25,602 --> 00:01:28,104
Then i sound the way i feel.

26
00:01:28,139 --> 00:01:31,224
I'm helping you because you
asked me to as a friend, paul.

27
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:34,861
I can give you
efficiency and
dedication, but...

28
00:01:34,896 --> 00:01:40,483
enthusiasm i can't dredge up
even in the minutest degree.

29
00:01:40,518 --> 00:01:43,736
No sense of adventure,
no wonder at the unknown?

30
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:46,372
There's some wonder,
some inquisitiveness

31
00:01:46,407 --> 00:01:51,995
as to how a human being can
place himself in such jeopardy

32
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:55,748
not only with willingness,
but with anticipation.

33
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:57,250
Jeopardy?

34
00:01:57,285 --> 00:02:00,386
The jeopardy i face
comes in shadow.

35
00:02:00,421 --> 00:02:03,506
Yours happens
to be much more real.

36
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:07,260
But of the two, there's
not much choice.

37
00:02:07,295 --> 00:02:09,145
Did you drink milk
this morning?

38
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,648
What was
the strontium 90 content?

39
00:02:11,683 --> 00:02:16,019
Has it occurred to you
that the things you've
been eating

40
00:02:16,054 --> 00:02:18,521
might be turning
your bones into sawdust?

41
00:02:18,556 --> 00:02:20,773
Oh, harvey, speak to me
of jeopardy if you will

42
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:22,659
but don't make it sound as if

43
00:02:22,694 --> 00:02:25,161
i have an exclusive franchise
on the calculated risk.

44
00:02:25,196 --> 00:02:28,281
You and i share
this dubious distinction

45
00:02:28,316 --> 00:02:32,669
with several million peers
who inhabit the 20th century.

46
00:02:32,704 --> 00:02:35,788
And you don't care
for the 20th century.

47
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:36,673
I do not.

48
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:39,175
I will tell you succinctly

49
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:41,678
how i classify the times.

50
00:02:41,713 --> 00:02:44,797
We live in a cesspool,
a septic tank

51
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:49,185
a gigantic sewage complex in
which runs the dregs, the filth

52
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:52,305
the misery-laden slop
of the race of men-

53
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:56,059
his hatred, prejudices,
passions, and violence.

54
00:02:56,094 --> 00:02:58,561
And the keeper
man.

55
00:02:58,596 --> 00:03:01,698
He is a scientifically advanced
monkey

56
00:03:01,733 --> 00:03:04,817
who walks upright,
with eyes wide open

57
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:07,320
into an abyss
of his own making.

58
00:03:07,355 --> 00:03:10,456
His bombs, fallout,
poisons, radioactivity-

59
00:03:10,491 --> 00:03:13,576
everything he designs
as an art for dying

60
00:03:13,611 --> 00:03:15,461
is his excuse for living.

61
00:03:15,496 --> 00:03:20,466
No, we live in an exquisite
bedlam... an insanity.

62
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:22,969
Maybe all the more grotesque

63
00:03:23,004 --> 00:03:26,723
by the fact that we don't
recognize it as insanity.

64
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:28,091
Did it ever occur to you

65
00:03:28,126 --> 00:03:30,593
that some these
scientifically advanced monkeys

66
00:03:30,628 --> 00:03:33,730
make bombs as a simple expedient
for survival?

67
00:03:33,765 --> 00:03:35,598
That across this planet
there are other

68
00:03:35,633 --> 00:03:39,352
scientifically advanced monkeys
who would pulverize us into dust

69
00:03:39,387 --> 00:03:41,854
if they thought they could do so
with impunity?

70
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:44,357
I don't need
a lesson in current events.

71
00:03:44,392 --> 00:03:46,242
I'm pretty well
up on the times.

72
00:03:46,277 --> 00:03:48,111
The freedom-loving
monkeys make bombs

73
00:03:48,146 --> 00:03:49,996
while the aggressors
make bombs.

74
00:03:50,031 --> 00:03:51,998
But ultimately,
somebody pushes a button

75
00:03:52,615 --> 00:03:55,118
and just as ultimately,
this earth disappears.

76
00:03:55,153 --> 00:03:57,620
And all of this, i suppose,
is right

77
00:03:57,655 --> 00:04:00,123
and practical and expedient.

78
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:03,259
A few germs will rise up
out of the rubble

79
00:04:03,294 --> 00:04:05,762
and wave microscopic
flags of victory

80
00:04:05,797 --> 00:04:10,133
and shed a few microscopic tears
for the race of men.

81
00:04:10,168 --> 00:04:15,138
Harvey, are you content
with this kind of status quo?

82
00:04:15,173 --> 00:04:18,891
Are you satisfied withthiskind
of 20th century?

83
00:04:29,652 --> 00:04:31,537
You're in focus now, paul.

84
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:33,156
Press the button.

85
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:39,295
Press the button, my friend,
send me back into time.

86
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:04,937
Exit one paul driscoll,

87
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:07,440
a creature of the 20th century.

88
00:05:07,475 --> 00:05:09,942
He puts to a test
a complicated theorem

89
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:11,194
of space-time continuum.

90
00:05:11,229 --> 00:05:14,947
But he goes
a step further, or tries to.

91
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:18,084
Shortly, he will seek out
three moments of the past

92
00:05:18,701 --> 00:05:20,586
in a desperate attempt
to alter the present-

93
00:05:21,204 --> 00:05:23,089
one of the odd
and fanciful functions

94
00:05:23,124 --> 00:05:27,460
in a shadowland known as...
the twilight zone.

95
00:06:01,911 --> 00:06:05,048
I regret
that i kept you waiting.

96
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:11,304
I'm told that you speak
english rather well.

97
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:12,555
Indeed.

98
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:17,560
I venture to say i speak it
perhaps a bit better

99
00:06:17,595 --> 00:06:19,429
than you speak japanese.

100
00:06:19,464 --> 00:06:21,314
I don't speak
any japanese.

101
00:06:21,349 --> 00:06:23,816
But the english i have
to throw at you

102
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:26,319
may be the most important
you've heard in your life.

103
00:06:26,354 --> 00:06:30,073
Sit down, mr., um...
driscoll, is it?

104
00:06:30,108 --> 00:06:31,941
A rather efficient
police.

105
00:06:31,976 --> 00:06:34,444
Much more intent on
putting me in jail

106
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,329
than in listening
to me.

107
00:06:36,364 --> 00:06:39,699
You happen to be an enemy alien,
which is the reason why...

108
00:06:39,734 --> 00:06:42,201
the reason why i was kept
in a cell over six hours.

109
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:46,589
It also may be the reason
you'll regret this arrest.

110
00:06:46,624 --> 00:06:47,840
Go on.

111
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:50,960
What i was trying to tell
them, and you now

112
00:06:50,995 --> 00:06:54,714
is that within an hour
this city is going
to be destroyed

113
00:06:54,749 --> 00:06:59,719
and upward of 60,000
to 70,000 human beings
will be killed.

114
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:12,231
You don't get it,
do you?

115
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:15,985
You're going to be bombed
out of existence!

116
00:07:16,619 --> 00:07:19,739
There are some things
you could do about it.

117
00:07:19,774 --> 00:07:22,875
Start an evacuation
of women and children.

118
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:25,378
You can save a few
thousand human lives.

119
00:07:25,413 --> 00:07:26,629
I can?

120
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:28,498
By whose say-so,
mr. Driscoll?

121
00:07:29,132 --> 00:07:31,000
Whodoyou
represent?

122
00:07:31,035 --> 00:07:32,885
I don't represent anyone.

123
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:36,005
Let's say i represent
the voice of history.

124
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,142
The voice of history.

125
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,261
That's quaint, mr. Driscoll.

126
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:45,398
That's extremely
quaint.

127
00:07:45,433 --> 00:07:48,518
A new kind of bomb is going
to be dropped here.

128
00:07:48,553 --> 00:07:50,903
You're going to live
through a nightmare

129
00:07:50,938 --> 00:07:53,406
beyond any kind of imagination.

130
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:13,543
A single aircraft, mr. Driscoll?

131
00:08:13,578 --> 00:08:16,045
One lone b-29.

132
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,799
I rather think
we can survive that.

133
00:08:23,721 --> 00:08:28,057
I must take you to some higher
authorities, mr. Driscoll

134
00:08:28,092 --> 00:08:30,560
who will interrogate you
at army headquarters.

135
00:08:30,595 --> 00:08:32,445
If you'll be good
enough to follow.

136
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,313
Listen...

137
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:37,066
this is not just a request.

138
00:08:37,101 --> 00:08:40,203
It's in the nature of a prayer.

139
00:08:40,238 --> 00:08:43,823
I will make an assumption
you have some illness.

140
00:08:43,858 --> 00:08:48,211
I won't put you up against
the wall and shoot you.

141
00:08:48,246 --> 00:08:51,330
I'll give you a chance
to speak to other authorities.

142
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:53,216
If you get back
to your country

143
00:08:53,251 --> 00:08:56,335
the face of the enemy

144
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,838
is not devoid
of some compassion.

145
00:09:03,226 --> 00:09:04,477
You might remember
this conversation.

146
00:09:04,512 --> 00:09:07,597
And if you're still alive...

147
00:09:07,632 --> 00:09:11,350
remember that the same thing
could be said of your enemy.

148
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:13,853
He tried to save the people
of hiroshima.

149
00:09:55,778 --> 00:10:00,783
Sieg heil!

150
00:10:00,818 --> 00:10:05,154
Sieg heil!

151
00:11:09,218 --> 00:11:10,469
Yes?

152
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:12,972
I am here to prepare
your room, mein herr.

153
00:11:13,007 --> 00:11:14,857
That won't be necessary.

154
00:11:14,892 --> 00:11:17,977
But i have clean towels,
sir, and soap.

155
00:11:18,012 --> 00:11:20,479
Well, just a moment.

156
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:31,741
Guten tag.
Hello.

157
00:11:31,776 --> 00:11:34,243
Ach, you have
the loveliest room

158
00:11:34,278 --> 00:11:36,128
in the hotel, mein herr.

159
00:11:36,163 --> 00:11:37,997
Yes.

160
00:11:38,032 --> 00:11:39,882
Yes, it's
a lovely view.

161
00:11:39,917 --> 00:11:43,002
Oh, it's more than a view,
much more than a view.

162
00:11:43,037 --> 00:11:45,504
In just a moment you'll
see history unfolding.

163
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:48,007
Do you know that this
whole side of the hotel

164
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:51,761
on every floor, has been
rented, completely?

165
00:11:51,796 --> 00:11:54,897
Just because of ourfuhrer,
just so they can see him.

166
00:11:54,932 --> 00:11:57,400
Ha, down in the street
it's a madhouse

167
00:11:57,435 --> 00:11:59,268
and this is the only
place to watch from.

168
00:11:59,303 --> 00:12:02,405
Yes, that's what
they told me.

169
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,907
You're not german,
mein herr?

170
00:12:04,942 --> 00:12:06,776
No, i'm not.

171
00:12:06,811 --> 00:12:08,661
Then what
are you instead?

172
00:12:08,696 --> 00:12:09,912
I'm an american.

173
00:12:09,947 --> 00:12:11,781
Oh, excuse me.

174
00:12:11,816 --> 00:12:14,033
An american?

175
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:18,421
What do they think of ourfuhrer
in america,

176
00:12:18,456 --> 00:12:20,289
and the new germany?

177
00:12:20,324 --> 00:12:22,174
We're quite neutral.

178
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:27,179
Neutral? You say neutral
but you mean something else.

179
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:30,933
Der fuhrer!

180
00:12:30,968 --> 00:12:32,184
Do you hear that?

181
00:12:32,219 --> 00:12:34,053
That is our new germany.

182
00:12:34,088 --> 00:12:37,189
That is something
you'll never understand.

183
00:12:37,224 --> 00:12:39,058
That, madam,
is the old germany

184
00:12:39,093 --> 00:12:42,812
and that is something
you'llnever understand.

185
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:31,994
Herr driscoll?

186
00:13:32,029 --> 00:13:34,497
Open up, please,
immediately!

187
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,250
Immediately, now,
herr driscoll!

188
00:13:38,285 --> 00:13:41,370
Will you open up this
door, immediately?

189
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:33,055
Now, you said this is
a matter of some urgency,
mr., uh, mr...?

190
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:35,558
My name is driscoll,
but that's not important.

191
00:14:35,593 --> 00:14:38,677
Then perhaps you'd tell me,
sir, what is important.

192
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:41,180
Unfortunately, i'm due on the
bridge in just a few moments.

193
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:44,934
Captain, is there any way
of altering the course?

194
00:14:44,969 --> 00:14:46,185
I beg your pardon.

195
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,687
The course, the present
course the ship is taking,

196
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:49,939
is there any way
of altering it?

197
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:55,578
Well, now, since my country
is a belligerent

198
00:14:55,613 --> 00:14:58,080
and these waters are a zone
of combat

199
00:14:58,115 --> 00:15:01,834
i think i would rather discuss
this with higher authority

200
00:15:01,869 --> 00:15:04,336
before taking such a step.

201
00:15:04,371 --> 00:15:07,456
Supposing i told you, captain,
that if you hold this course

202
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:09,341
for as long as perhaps
five minutes

203
00:15:09,376 --> 00:15:11,210
this ship is going
to be torpedoed.

204
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:17,716
Just who are you,
mr. Driscoll?

205
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:20,853
You won't find me on
the passenger list there.

206
00:15:20,888 --> 00:15:23,355
My name isn't on it.

207
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,224
Yet you got aboard. How?

208
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:27,726
That doesn't matter,
i did get aboard.

209
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:30,229
But i'm not sailing
for my health.

210
00:15:30,264 --> 00:15:33,983
I'm sailing for your health

211
00:15:34,018 --> 00:15:36,485
and that of your crew
and passengers.

212
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:40,239
I happen to know that this ship
is going to be torpedoed!

213
00:15:41,991 --> 00:15:46,378
Right here, right off
old head of kinsale island.

214
00:15:46,413 --> 00:15:47,630
May the 7th.

215
00:15:47,665 --> 00:15:48,881
May the 7th?

216
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:50,132
Yes, sir.

217
00:15:50,167 --> 00:15:50,749
That's today.

218
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:53,252
You say youknowthis.

219
00:15:53,287 --> 00:15:55,137
How do you know?

220
00:15:55,172 --> 00:15:59,508
If i told you, you'd probably
say i was a lunatic.

221
00:15:59,543 --> 00:16:01,393
I won't
deny that.

222
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:04,513
But neither will i alter
the course of this ship

223
00:16:05,147 --> 00:16:08,901
simply on the word of one man
who seems strangely reticent

224
00:16:08,936 --> 00:16:12,655
to say anything beyond
one single wild statement.

225
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:16,408
Say i am a lunatic, say
everything i'm telling you

226
00:16:16,443 --> 00:16:18,911
is the product
of a deranged mind.

227
00:16:18,946 --> 00:16:22,031
How many minutes could you lose
by altering course?

228
00:16:22,066 --> 00:16:23,282
That's not the point.

229
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:24,533
Thatis
the point.

230
00:16:24,568 --> 00:16:27,670
Otherwise, 1,100 people
are going to drown.

231
00:16:27,705 --> 00:16:30,789
I think that will be
about enough, mr. Driscoll.

232
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:33,292
If you happen to be one
of the fortunate few...

233
00:16:33,327 --> 00:16:35,794
remember, when that court
of inquiry convenes...

234
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:38,297
that's enough, mr. Driscoll.

235
00:16:38,332 --> 00:16:40,799
I'll ask you to leave.

236
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:43,686
Captain, i'm not asking you
to scuttle the ship

237
00:16:43,721 --> 00:16:47,439
i'm only asking you to alter
course one single degree!

238
00:16:47,474 --> 00:16:48,691
Steward, steward.

239
00:16:48,726 --> 00:16:50,559
Come in here, please.

240
00:16:50,594 --> 00:16:51,810
Sir?

241
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:54,947
Escort mr. Driscoll out
of my quarters, please.

242
00:16:54,982 --> 00:16:58,701
Come along,
if you would, sir.

243
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:03,072
Oh, captain, there's
still time.

244
00:17:03,107 --> 00:17:04,323
Mr. Driscoll,
there's still time

245
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:06,825
to confine you
to your cabin.

246
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,711
And mind you, sir, after
i make inquiry

247
00:17:08,746 --> 00:17:12,464
as to how you got aboard,
i may do that.

248
00:18:00,262 --> 00:18:02,765
Well, go on, paul.
Then what?

249
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,016
Then nothing.

250
00:18:04,051 --> 00:18:07,136
Hiroshima, august 1945.

251
00:18:07,171 --> 00:18:10,272
Attempt number one,
failure number one.

252
00:18:10,307 --> 00:18:13,392
Then august 1939,
the hotel berlin

253
00:18:13,427 --> 00:18:15,894
another blow
for law and order

254
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:19,031
hitting nothing, and
accomplishing just that.

255
00:18:19,066 --> 00:18:22,785
And finally, thelusitania,
1915- one of the causes

256
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:25,287
of our entering
the first world war.

257
00:18:25,322 --> 00:18:28,407
Three tries, three misses.

258
00:18:28,442 --> 00:18:33,412
Then you must know now, paul,
that the past is inviolate.

259
00:18:33,447 --> 00:18:36,548
Whatever has happened, must
remain as having happened.

260
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:39,051
You can't change anything.

261
00:18:39,086 --> 00:18:40,919
I believe you.

262
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:44,673
I believe it's not possible
to alter the past

263
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:48,427
and because of that, there
isn't anything we can do

264
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:51,563
about the present or the future.

265
00:18:54,817 --> 00:18:56,685
Study of 19th century
midwest america?

266
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,570
Open that to page 90.

267
00:18:58,605 --> 00:19:04,193
It talks about a place there
called homeville, indiana.

268
00:19:04,228 --> 00:19:07,329
There's a picture, shows
how it looked in 1881.

269
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,698
Hmm, this is charming...

270
00:19:09,733 --> 00:19:12,701
parasols, bicycles...

271
00:19:12,736 --> 00:19:15,204
it's all very serene.

272
00:19:15,838 --> 00:19:18,340
Apropos of what, paul?

273
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,843
Apropos of the fact that
i'm going back there.

274
00:19:20,878 --> 00:19:23,345
I'm going back, not
to change anything

275
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,214
but to become
a part of it.

276
00:19:25,249 --> 00:19:29,601
A world of band concerts and
summer nights on front porches.

277
00:19:29,636 --> 00:19:32,104
A world that never heard
of an atomic bomb

278
00:19:32,139 --> 00:19:35,858
world war, or germ warfare-
that'swhere i'm going.

279
00:19:35,893 --> 00:19:38,977
All right,
but remember this, paul

280
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:42,114
everything is cause and effect,
everything.

281
00:19:42,149 --> 00:19:45,234
You go back in time
to this homeville

282
00:19:45,269 --> 00:19:49,621
and you inadvertently change
one event, alter it minutely

283
00:19:49,656 --> 00:19:52,124
and you might start
a chain reaction

284
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:55,244
beyond anything
that we can even imagine.

285
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:57,629
I'm going back there
tolive

286
00:19:57,664 --> 00:20:01,383
not to change anything.

287
00:20:01,418 --> 00:20:04,503
Now, harvey,
how about it?

288
00:20:04,538 --> 00:20:07,639
All right, now,
heaven help me.

289
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:12,644
And heaven
help you, paul.

290
00:21:50,742 --> 00:21:54,496
Well, what's
your order, sir?

291
00:21:54,531 --> 00:21:56,999
I'll have a beer.

292
00:22:05,123 --> 00:22:07,626
That'll be a nickel.

293
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:09,127
A nickel?

294
00:22:09,162 --> 00:22:11,013
That's the price tag.

295
00:22:11,048 --> 00:22:12,514
You got a nickel?

296
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:20,272
You from around here?

297
00:22:20,307 --> 00:22:22,774
No. No, i'm from out of state.

298
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:24,643
Out of state,
you say?

299
00:22:24,678 --> 00:22:25,894
Just passing through?

300
00:22:25,929 --> 00:22:28,397
No. As a matter of fact,

301
00:22:28,432 --> 00:22:31,533
i was thinking
of settling down here.

302
00:22:31,568 --> 00:22:34,653
Just as i expected.

303
00:22:34,688 --> 00:22:37,155
Boarding house
across the square.

304
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,407
Ma chamberlain's place.

305
00:22:38,442 --> 00:22:40,292
Real nice accommodations.

306
00:22:40,327 --> 00:22:42,160
She runs a clean place.

307
00:22:42,195 --> 00:22:43,412
Gonna stay there?

308
00:22:43,447 --> 00:22:45,914
For the present.

309
00:23:13,191 --> 00:23:16,328
It begins.

310
00:23:16,363 --> 00:23:19,448
Right away, it begins.

311
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:25,087
It's tomorrow.

312
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:29,207
It's tomorrow.

313
00:23:29,242 --> 00:23:31,093
It's tomorrow
that garfield...

314
00:23:31,128 --> 00:23:33,595
what did you say?
When what?

315
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:37,966
Oh, nothing, i was
just talking to myself.

316
00:23:42,971 --> 00:23:44,356
Odd fellow...

317
00:23:45,607 --> 00:23:46,858
real odd.

318
00:23:47,476 --> 00:23:51,363
Maybe he just don't hold
with president garfield.

319
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:55,484
Maybe he's a democrat.

320
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:06,128
President james abram garfield

321
00:24:06,163 --> 00:24:12,384
shot in a washington railway
station, july 2, 1881.

322
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:16,138
Died september 19, 1881.

323
00:24:19,257 --> 00:24:23,645
So be it.

324
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:29,267
Room comfortable?

325
00:24:29,302 --> 00:24:31,153
Yes, very,
thank you.

326
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,021
Should be.

327
00:24:33,655 --> 00:24:34,906
Best room
in the house.

328
00:24:35,524 --> 00:24:38,660
Northern afternoon sun,
southern exposure.

329
00:24:38,695 --> 00:24:41,163
The nicest
view i've got.

330
00:24:41,198 --> 00:24:43,915
Are you a traveling man,
mr. Driscoll?

331
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:46,034
Oh, no, mrs. Chamberlain,
i'm not.

332
00:24:46,069 --> 00:24:49,037
What is your business,
mr. Driscoll?

333
00:24:49,072 --> 00:24:51,540
Well, i'm a physicist.

334
00:24:51,575 --> 00:24:53,425
Physicist?

335
00:24:55,043 --> 00:24:58,930
When i've got more time,
explain that to me.

336
00:24:58,965 --> 00:25:00,682
Well, now...

337
00:25:00,717 --> 00:25:03,685
i must tell you the rest
of the rules of the house.

338
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:07,439
No visitors upstairs
after 8:30 p.m.

339
00:25:07,474 --> 00:25:09,307
Lady visitors downstairs
in the parlor

340
00:25:09,941 --> 00:25:12,444
no gambling, no chewing,
breakfast 8:30 sharp

341
00:25:12,479 --> 00:25:13,695
dinner at noon,
supper at 6:00.

342
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:15,564
If you're late,
you're out of luck.

343
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:19,951
Each week's bill,
paid inadvance.

344
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:27,325
Abigail, i want you
to meet the new boarder.

345
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:33,081
This is mr. Driscoll,
he's from the east.

346
00:25:33,715 --> 00:25:35,584
This is miss
abigail sloan.

347
00:25:35,619 --> 00:25:37,469
She teaches school
here in town.

348
00:25:37,504 --> 00:25:38,720
Pleased to
meet you.

349
00:25:38,755 --> 00:25:39,838
Thank you.

350
00:25:39,873 --> 00:25:42,974
Are you planing to stay
for a time?

351
00:25:43,009 --> 00:25:44,476
I hope to.

352
00:25:44,511 --> 00:25:46,478
Well, i hope you enjoy it.

353
00:25:46,513 --> 00:25:47,345
Thank you.

354
00:25:48,597 --> 00:25:51,099
Lovely girl,
ain't she?

355
00:25:51,134 --> 00:25:53,985
And a moral girl, too.

356
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:57,105
I mean real moral.

357
00:26:06,114 --> 00:26:09,251
Nuclear fallout...

358
00:26:09,286 --> 00:26:12,370
indochina...

359
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:15,507
berlin wall...

360
00:26:15,542 --> 00:26:17,375
what are you?

361
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:19,878
I never heard of you.

362
00:26:19,913 --> 00:26:23,515
It's summer, first of july.

363
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:27,519
Going to be a band concert
in a couple of days...

364
00:26:27,554 --> 00:26:30,639
lemonade, fireworks...

365
00:26:33,141 --> 00:26:37,529
it's 1881, homeville, indiana.

366
00:26:40,031 --> 00:26:43,151
And i'm home.

367
00:26:47,656 --> 00:26:51,409
Twilight zonewill continue
after station identification.

368
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:10,929
And i tell you,
mrs. Chamberlain

369
00:27:10,964 --> 00:27:14,683
that until this
government of ours

370
00:27:14,718 --> 00:27:19,070
assumes its rightful
place of responsibility
in the world

371
00:27:19,105 --> 00:27:24,075
we will remain an isolated,
terribly provincial

372
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:27,829
static community of states.

373
00:27:27,864 --> 00:27:30,332
You know what i say
we should do about it?

374
00:27:30,367 --> 00:27:32,834
I'll tell you what we should do.

375
00:27:32,869 --> 00:27:35,337
We should take
the american fleet

376
00:27:35,372 --> 00:27:39,708
send it over to the orient
and plant the american flag.

377
00:27:40,342 --> 00:27:42,844
Then on down
to australia

378
00:27:42,879 --> 00:27:45,347
then back across
the pacific to
south america

379
00:27:45,382 --> 00:27:49,100
planting the american
flag as we go.

380
00:27:49,135 --> 00:27:52,721
Planting her deep,
planting her high,

381
00:27:53,355 --> 00:27:55,857
planting her proud.

382
00:27:55,892 --> 00:27:58,977
You ought to run for office,
mr. Hanford.

383
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:02,113
Believe me, my dear lady,
i've thought of it,

384
00:28:02,148 --> 00:28:04,616
but finance comes first.

385
00:28:04,651 --> 00:28:06,484
It's the lifeblood
of the nation.

386
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:10,238
And the bank needs me.

387
00:28:10,273 --> 00:28:14,626
Mr. Driscoll, what are
your international views?

388
00:28:14,661 --> 00:28:17,128
I don't have any,
mr. Hanford.

389
00:28:17,163 --> 00:28:19,631
Of course you do, man.

390
00:28:19,881 --> 00:28:23,001
Everybody has to have views as
to the destiny of our country.

391
00:28:23,036 --> 00:28:27,389
Now, you take the case of the
indian wars, five years ago.

392
00:28:27,424 --> 00:28:29,891
All this silly conciliatory
nonsense

393
00:28:29,926 --> 00:28:32,394
about giving the indians lands.

394
00:28:32,429 --> 00:28:38,650
As if you could actually make
savages understand treaties.

395
00:28:38,685 --> 00:28:42,404
We should have had
20 george custers
and 100,000 men

396
00:28:42,439 --> 00:28:45,523
and we should have swept
across the plains

397
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:49,277
destroying every redskin
who faced us.

398
00:28:49,312 --> 00:28:52,414
And then we should have planted
the american flag

399
00:28:52,449 --> 00:28:56,167
deep, high, and proud!

400
00:28:56,202 --> 00:28:59,921
I think the country is tired
of fighting.

401
00:28:59,956 --> 00:29:03,675
I think we were bled dry
by the war.

402
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:08,680
Anything we can get by treaty
is the proper course to pursue.

403
00:29:09,297 --> 00:29:11,800
Now, here, young lady...

404
00:29:12,434 --> 00:29:16,805
i trust that this isn't the pap
you spoon-feed to your students.

405
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:19,941
Treaties, indeed;
peace, indeed.

406
00:29:19,976 --> 00:29:22,444
Why, the virility
of a nation

407
00:29:22,479 --> 00:29:26,197
is in direct proportion
to its fighting qualities.

408
00:29:26,232 --> 00:29:29,200
We'll live to see the day

409
00:29:29,235 --> 00:29:32,320
when this country fields
an army of a million men

410
00:29:32,355 --> 00:29:36,074
sweeping everything...

411
00:29:36,109 --> 00:29:39,327
i'm sorry,
mrs. Chamberlain,
i, uh...

412
00:29:39,362 --> 00:29:42,330
i get carried away.

413
00:29:42,365 --> 00:29:47,335
You some kind of pacifist,
are you, driscoll?

414
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:50,472
No, i'm some kind
of sick idiot

415
00:29:50,507 --> 00:29:52,340
who's seen too
many young men die

416
00:29:52,375 --> 00:29:54,843
because of too many
old men like you

417
00:29:54,878 --> 00:29:57,979
who fight their battles
at dining room tables.

418
00:29:58,014 --> 00:29:59,848
Oh, my goodness.

419
00:29:59,883 --> 00:30:02,984
I take offense at that
remark, mr. Driscoll.

420
00:30:03,351 --> 00:30:05,236
And i take offense
at armchair warriors

421
00:30:05,271 --> 00:30:08,356
who don't know what a shrapnel
wound feels like

422
00:30:08,391 --> 00:30:11,493
or what death smells like
after three days in the sun

423
00:30:11,528 --> 00:30:14,612
or the look
in a man's eyes

424
00:30:14,647 --> 00:30:17,749
when he's minus a leg and
his blood is seeping out.

425
00:30:17,784 --> 00:30:20,251
Mr. Hanford, you have
a great enthusiasm

426
00:30:20,286 --> 00:30:22,120
for planting the flag deep.

427
00:30:22,155 --> 00:30:24,622
But you don't have
a nodding acquaintance

428
00:30:24,657 --> 00:30:28,376
with what it's like to bury men
in the same soil.

429
00:30:28,411 --> 00:30:31,513
I'll not sit here
and take talk like that.

430
00:30:31,548 --> 00:30:33,381
No, no...

431
00:30:33,416 --> 00:30:34,632
you'll go back to your bank

432
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:37,769
and it'll be business
as usual until dinnertime

433
00:30:37,804 --> 00:30:40,889
when you'll give us
another vacuous speech

434
00:30:40,924 --> 00:30:44,642
about a country growing strong
by filling its graveyards.

435
00:30:44,677 --> 00:30:47,779
Well, you're in for some
gratifying times, mr. Hanford.

436
00:30:47,814 --> 00:30:51,533
Believe me, there'll be a lot
of graveyards for you to fill

437
00:30:51,568 --> 00:30:53,401
in cuba
and in france

438
00:30:53,436 --> 00:30:57,789
then all over europe,
and all over the pacific.

439
00:30:57,824 --> 00:31:00,909
You can sit on the sidelines
and wave your pennants

440
00:31:00,944 --> 00:31:02,794
because,
according to your definition

441
00:31:02,829 --> 00:31:05,296
this country's going
to get virile as the devil.

442
00:31:05,331 --> 00:31:07,165
From san juan
to inchon

443
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,667
we'll show how
red our blood is

444
00:31:09,702 --> 00:31:10,919
because we'll
spill it.

445
00:31:10,954 --> 00:31:13,671
There are two unfortunate
aspects of this.

446
00:31:13,706 --> 00:31:16,808
One is, that you won't have
to spill any.

447
00:31:16,843 --> 00:31:21,429
And the other is, you won't live
long enough to know i'm right.

448
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,939
A violent man.

449
00:31:45,453 --> 00:31:46,704
Mr. Driscoll.

450
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:53,595
Mr. Driscoll, i...

451
00:31:55,463 --> 00:31:56,714
i...

452
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:02,353
well, have i sufficiently
endeared myself

453
00:32:02,388 --> 00:32:04,722
to them in there?

454
00:32:04,757 --> 00:32:08,476
I've been living there for
almost two years, mr. Driscoll.

455
00:32:08,511 --> 00:32:10,361
That means two years
of mealtimes

456
00:32:10,979 --> 00:32:12,864
with mrs. Chamberlain's
homemade pies

457
00:32:12,899 --> 00:32:14,732
and mr. Hanford's rhetoric.

458
00:32:19,237 --> 00:32:24,242
I... i lost a father
and two brothers in the war.

459
00:32:24,277 --> 00:32:26,744
All three of them
died in one afternoon.

460
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:29,881
For the 12 years
that my mother lived

461
00:32:29,916 --> 00:32:33,635
well, there was a funeral
in our house every day.

462
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:36,754
She never stopped mourning them.

463
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:40,508
I, i think they died
for something, but...

464
00:32:40,543 --> 00:32:42,393
but tonight, for the first time,
mr. Driscoll

465
00:32:43,011 --> 00:32:45,513
i heard somebody make a, a point

466
00:32:45,548 --> 00:32:48,016
that-that there are things
preferable to dying

467
00:32:48,051 --> 00:32:51,152
and patriotism doesn't have
to come with pain.

468
00:32:51,187 --> 00:32:54,272
It's very decent of you
to tell me this, miss sloan.

469
00:32:54,307 --> 00:32:58,026
Why don't you
just call me abby?

470
00:32:58,061 --> 00:33:00,528
Abby.

471
00:33:00,563 --> 00:33:01,779
My first name's paul.

472
00:33:01,814 --> 00:33:02,413
Paul.

473
00:33:03,031 --> 00:33:04,282
It fits.

474
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:07,285
Does it?

475
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,170
Yes, it fits
very well.

476
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:13,541
Do you know
something?

477
00:33:13,576 --> 00:33:15,426
You look like
a man in love.

478
00:33:15,461 --> 00:33:17,795
Not with a woman...

479
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,681
with what, then?

480
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:24,052
With a moment, a place.

481
00:33:25,937 --> 00:33:29,691
What were those names you
said... san juan, inchon?

482
00:33:29,726 --> 00:33:30,942
Where are those places?

483
00:33:30,977 --> 00:33:35,313
When you said, "other
graveyards, other wars..."

484
00:33:35,348 --> 00:33:39,701
what did you
mean by that?

485
00:33:39,736 --> 00:33:40,952
Oh, nothing.

486
00:33:46,207 --> 00:33:48,710
Why do i get this feeling

487
00:33:48,745 --> 00:33:50,578
that you're on
the outside looking in

488
00:33:51,212 --> 00:33:55,583
just, well, passing by,
looking in.

489
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:03,725
Abby... i don't want
to be just passing by.

490
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:06,844
I want to come in.

491
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:14,986
I wish... i wish
i could come in.

492
00:34:15,021 --> 00:34:16,854
Why can't you?

493
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:19,991
Everything is
possible... everything.

494
00:34:28,116 --> 00:34:31,252
Garfield... it's
finally happened.

495
00:34:31,287 --> 00:34:36,257
Just came over the telegram...
president garfield's been shot!

496
00:34:36,292 --> 00:34:38,760
Paul... how did
you know that?

497
00:34:38,795 --> 00:34:41,879
You couldn't possibly
have heard what they said.

498
00:34:41,914 --> 00:34:44,382
How did you know that?

499
00:34:44,417 --> 00:34:46,884
Paul, what's the matter?

500
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:52,523
Abby, you're wrong.

501
00:34:52,558 --> 00:34:55,026
Not everything is possible.

502
00:34:57,528 --> 00:35:02,533
I wish i could tell you,
but i can't explain it.

503
00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:08,156
You mean...
you and me.

504
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:13,161
Especiallyyou and me.

505
00:35:13,196 --> 00:35:14,412
Why?

506
00:35:16,297 --> 00:35:18,166
Why?

507
00:35:18,201 --> 00:35:20,668
It's getting late, abby.

508
00:35:20,703 --> 00:35:23,805
It's time for you to go in.

509
00:35:55,837 --> 00:35:58,956
Good morning.

510
00:36:00,842 --> 00:36:02,093
Good morning.

511
00:36:02,128 --> 00:36:04,595
We missed you
at breakfast.

512
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:08,966
Oh, the... president
was badly wounded.

513
00:36:10,218 --> 00:36:12,103
Yes, so it says.

514
00:36:12,138 --> 00:36:15,223
But there's hope
here for his recovery.

515
00:36:18,609 --> 00:36:21,729
I guess that's all that's left
sometimes, isn't it?

516
00:36:21,764 --> 00:36:23,614
Just hope.

517
00:36:23,649 --> 00:36:27,368
Abby, i'm sorry
about last night.

518
00:36:27,403 --> 00:36:28,619
I'm truly sorry.

519
00:36:28,654 --> 00:36:31,122
I wish i could
explain it to you,

520
00:36:31,157 --> 00:36:34,242
but i can't, i couldn't
make you understand.

521
00:36:34,277 --> 00:36:37,378
Oh, it-it's perfectly
all right, really it is.

522
00:36:37,413 --> 00:36:39,881
There's no harm done,
no harm at all.

523
00:36:39,916 --> 00:36:41,749
You've got to forgive
schoolteachers-

524
00:36:41,784 --> 00:36:43,634
they're very impressionable.

525
00:36:43,669 --> 00:36:46,754
They're inclined to...
well, they're inclined

526
00:36:46,789 --> 00:36:51,142
to read many things
into a glance, a word...

527
00:36:51,177 --> 00:36:52,393
a touch.

528
00:36:52,428 --> 00:36:54,262
Well,

529
00:36:54,297 --> 00:36:57,014
i've got a very
busy day today.

530
00:36:57,049 --> 00:36:58,266
There's so much
preparation

531
00:36:58,900 --> 00:36:59,650
for tomorrow, you know.

532
00:36:59,685 --> 00:37:02,770
Parade at 9:00,
speech at 11:00

533
00:37:02,805 --> 00:37:04,272
games from noon till 5:00

534
00:37:04,307 --> 00:37:06,157
picnic supper
and then fireworks.

535
00:37:06,192 --> 00:37:08,025
And, oh, of course-
my children.

536
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,911
Your children?

537
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,913
Yes.

538
00:37:11,948 --> 00:37:15,666
27 flat little voices.

539
00:37:15,701 --> 00:37:20,037
14 boys, 13 girls will entertain
you with their own rendition

540
00:37:20,072 --> 00:37:21,923
of "columbia,
the gem of the ocean,"

541
00:37:21,958 --> 00:37:24,425
sung in six different keys
with...

542
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:28,179
27 highly individual
interpretations.

543
00:37:28,796 --> 00:37:32,550
Well, we're... we're going
to practice now and...

544
00:37:32,585 --> 00:37:34,435
let me tell you something.

545
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:37,054
Trying to keep
27 children quiet in...

546
00:37:37,089 --> 00:37:39,190
a school building
in the middle of summer

547
00:37:39,225 --> 00:37:41,692
the day before
the fourth of july, that...

548
00:37:41,727 --> 00:37:43,561
that happens to be...

549
00:37:43,596 --> 00:37:46,948
well, that happens
to be quite a...

550
00:37:46,983 --> 00:37:50,067
an accomplishment.

551
00:37:50,102 --> 00:37:53,821
Who are you, paul driscoll,
and where are you from?

552
00:37:53,856 --> 00:37:56,324
It doesn't make any
difference, abby.

553
00:37:56,359 --> 00:37:58,826
Doesn't it?

554
00:37:58,861 --> 00:38:01,329
All right, we'll
leave it at that.

555
00:38:01,364 --> 00:38:04,465
It doesn't make any difference.

556
00:38:06,834 --> 00:38:10,087
And it follows, it doesn't
make any difference

557
00:38:10,122 --> 00:38:14,475
that you... held me
and kissed me and...

558
00:38:55,516 --> 00:38:57,385
howdy, mr. Driscoll.

559
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:58,636
How are you?

560
00:38:59,136 --> 00:39:01,639
Flat.

561
00:39:09,146 --> 00:39:11,032
Well, that's better.

562
00:39:11,067 --> 00:39:13,534
Tomorrow's the big doings,
you know.

563
00:39:13,569 --> 00:39:15,403
Fourth of july concert.

564
00:39:15,438 --> 00:39:19,156
Yes, i'm looking
forward to that.

565
00:39:21,694 --> 00:39:26,047
She does a good job
with those kids.

566
00:39:27,915 --> 00:39:29,166
Miss sloan.

567
00:39:29,201 --> 00:39:31,669
Yes, so i've heard.

568
00:39:31,704 --> 00:39:35,423
Awful pretty girl
to be a schoolmarm.

569
00:39:35,458 --> 00:39:36,674
So i've noticed.

570
00:39:36,709 --> 00:39:38,559
I've noticed that you noticed.

571
00:39:38,594 --> 00:39:41,062
Aw, doggone, i never
had no schoolmarm

572
00:39:41,097 --> 00:39:43,564
looked like that
when i was a kid.

573
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:48,569
All my schoolmarms looked like
they came out of a pickle jar.

574
00:39:48,604 --> 00:39:51,689
Ah, it's a funny
little town, isn't it?

575
00:39:51,724 --> 00:39:53,574
Don't change.

576
00:39:53,609 --> 00:39:56,077
You see pictures of it
50 years ago

577
00:39:56,694 --> 00:39:59,830
and everything's the same...
same buildings, even.

578
00:39:59,865 --> 00:40:01,699
This schoolhouse, for example.

579
00:40:01,734 --> 00:40:06,087
I'll bet it's 60 years old,
as she stands there.

580
00:40:06,122 --> 00:40:09,206
It'll probably stand till
somebody pulls it down.

581
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,092
What?

582
00:40:11,127 --> 00:40:13,594
I was talking about
that school building.

583
00:40:13,629 --> 00:40:14,845
What did you say about it?

584
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,714
It'll probably
keep standing till...

585
00:40:16,749 --> 00:40:19,850
that's what i was
trying to remember.

586
00:40:19,885 --> 00:40:20,468
The school building.

587
00:40:24,472 --> 00:40:26,974
The school building.

588
00:40:27,009 --> 00:40:28,859
Oh, my god.

589
00:40:28,894 --> 00:40:30,728
My dear god.

590
00:40:48,129 --> 00:40:50,631
"The site of the homeville
national bank

591
00:40:50,666 --> 00:40:52,500
"was formerly occupied
by a school building

592
00:40:52,535 --> 00:40:56,887

"The fire was caused

597
00:41:15,057 --> 00:41:17,525
from a runaway wagon."

598
00:41:25,568 --> 00:41:27,668
I can't do anything.

599
00:41:27,703 --> 00:41:31,422
I can't say anything.

600
00:41:31,457 --> 00:41:34,542
Can't even warn anyone.

601
00:41:34,577 --> 00:41:39,547
Everything has to happen
the way it's supposed to happen.

602
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:47,688
Sorry, mr. President,
recover, you shall not.

603
00:41:47,723 --> 00:41:53,194
You're to die on september
the 19th of this year.

604
00:42:06,824 --> 00:42:09,960
And you shall burn.

605
00:42:12,463 --> 00:42:14,331
This afternoon at 2:00.

606
00:42:18,085 --> 00:42:21,839
"Seriously injuring
12 children."

607
00:42:31,232 --> 00:42:33,734
And i can't do anything
about it.

608
00:42:35,603 --> 00:42:39,990
I have to stand around
and watch it happen.

609
00:42:40,025 --> 00:42:43,110
I have to let it happen.

610
00:42:51,619 --> 00:42:54,255
Children, children,
back to rehearsal now.

611
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:55,506
Go on inside
and join the others.

612
00:42:55,541 --> 00:42:56,757
Go on.

613
00:43:06,767 --> 00:43:09,887
Everything is cause and effect

614
00:43:10,521 --> 00:43:12,389
everything.

615
00:43:12,424 --> 00:43:14,275
You go back in time to this...
this homeville

616
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:17,394
and you inadvertently
change one event

617
00:43:17,429 --> 00:43:21,782
alter it even minutely, you
might start a chain reaction

618
00:43:21,817 --> 00:43:24,902
beyond anything that
we could even imagine.

619
00:43:24,937 --> 00:43:27,154
All right, neighbors,
gather round here.

620
00:43:27,189 --> 00:43:28,906
That's it, get close.

621
00:43:28,941 --> 00:43:31,408
Give me your attention,
you'll never be sorry.

622
00:43:31,443 --> 00:43:33,294
Do you know
what i'm doing?

623
00:43:33,329 --> 00:43:35,796
Do you perceive my activity?

624
00:43:35,831 --> 00:43:37,047
You, sir...

625
00:43:37,082 --> 00:43:40,301
do you know the symbolism

626
00:43:40,336 --> 00:43:44,672
that professor eliot
is using at this moment?

627
00:43:44,707 --> 00:43:48,175
Like diogenes, i'm looking
for an honest man.

628
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:50,678
An honest man who'll
try one sip

629
00:43:50,713 --> 00:43:53,814
of professor eliot's
wonder medicine and tell me

630
00:43:53,849 --> 00:43:56,934
whether it's the finest medicine
he's ever tasted.

631
00:43:56,969 --> 00:43:59,320
Here it is,
friends.

632
00:43:59,355 --> 00:44:01,188
The most safe and efficient

633
00:44:01,223 --> 00:44:04,825
alternative and
de-obstruent properties

634
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:07,945
for the cure of scrofula,
king's evil

635
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:12,333
white swellings, indurate
tumors, gout, scurvy.

636
00:44:12,368 --> 00:44:15,085
25 cents a bottle.

637
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:18,088
It's guaranteed
to immediately alter

638
00:44:18,706 --> 00:44:21,959
a depraved or impure state
of the blood or body fluids.

639
00:44:21,994 --> 00:44:24,094
Here, madam, thank you.

640
00:44:24,129 --> 00:44:25,346
Will you have one, sir?

641
00:44:25,381 --> 00:44:27,214
There you are.

642
00:44:27,249 --> 00:44:29,466
Here you are.

643
00:44:29,501 --> 00:44:31,352
Thank you, thank you,
thank you.

644
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:33,971
Thank you very much.

645
00:44:34,006 --> 00:44:35,356
How about you,
my friend?

646
00:44:35,391 --> 00:44:38,225
Don't be in a hurry,
my friend...

647
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:40,110
do me a favor, will you?

648
00:44:40,145 --> 00:44:41,362
What?

649
00:44:41,397 --> 00:44:43,230
Well...

650
00:44:43,265 --> 00:44:46,367
oh, nothing, never mind.

651
00:44:49,521 --> 00:44:51,989
Unhitch those horses.

652
00:44:52,024 --> 00:44:53,874
What did you say?

653
00:44:53,909 --> 00:44:55,125
I can't tell you why.

654
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,377
Unhitch those horses.

655
00:44:56,412 --> 00:44:58,245
What's your trouble?

656
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,496
Dyspepsia, liver complaint?

657
00:44:59,531 --> 00:45:01,882
This is what you need, sir.

658
00:45:01,917 --> 00:45:05,002
I need those horses
unhitched.

659
00:45:05,037 --> 00:45:07,504
Now, just a minute.

660
00:45:10,426 --> 00:45:13,394
Listen, i can't argue
with you anymore.

661
00:45:13,429 --> 00:45:15,262
You've got to unhitch
those horses.

662
00:45:15,896 --> 00:45:18,399
This wagon mustn't move
a foot from this spot.

663
00:45:18,434 --> 00:45:20,267
Why mustn't it?

664
00:45:21,268 --> 00:45:25,022
You get out of here,
you hear me?

665
00:45:25,057 --> 00:45:27,524
Walk away from here!

666
00:45:27,559 --> 00:45:30,027
Leave me and my horses be!

667
00:45:30,062 --> 00:45:32,529
Get away
from my horses!

668
00:45:32,564 --> 00:45:34,415
You hear me? Get away!

669
00:46:19,209 --> 00:46:21,078
How did you know?

670
00:46:24,214 --> 00:46:25,466
You did, didn't you?

671
00:46:27,334 --> 00:46:29,219
Yes, i knew.

672
00:46:29,254 --> 00:46:31,088
I knew there'd be a fire.

673
00:46:31,123 --> 00:46:35,476
And i knew it would happen
this afternoon, at 2:00.

674
00:46:35,511 --> 00:46:37,978
But what i didn't know...

675
00:46:38,013 --> 00:46:39,229
i didn't know that
i would cause it.

676
00:46:39,847 --> 00:46:44,234
I shouldn't have come
here, i know that now.

677
00:46:44,269 --> 00:46:47,237
It won't work.

678
00:46:47,272 --> 00:46:49,106
I know that, too.

679
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:53,494
It can't work because
i know too many things.

680
00:46:53,529 --> 00:46:59,116
I know... i know about
too many tomorrows.

681
00:46:59,151 --> 00:47:00,868
Tomorrows?

682
00:47:00,903 --> 00:47:03,871
Your history, abby.

683
00:47:03,906 --> 00:47:07,624
You, and this town,
and the people in it.

684
00:47:07,659 --> 00:47:10,761
Everything about it,
your history...

685
00:47:10,796 --> 00:47:12,629
and i can't change you.

686
00:47:12,664 --> 00:47:15,883
I can't even...
touch you.

687
00:47:19,636 --> 00:47:21,522
Paul, why not?

688
00:47:21,557 --> 00:47:24,892
Because the past
is inviolate.

689
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:26,777
The past is sacred.

690
00:47:27,394 --> 00:47:30,531
It belongs to those
of you who live in it.

691
00:47:30,566 --> 00:47:33,033
It's not for interlopers...

692
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:38,038
for people who are just
passing by, look in

693
00:47:38,073 --> 00:47:42,409
and wish they were
a part of it.

694
00:47:42,444 --> 00:47:43,043
Where are you going?

695
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:46,296
I'm going back.

696
00:47:46,331 --> 00:47:48,799
Back to where
i came from.

697
00:47:48,834 --> 00:47:50,667
Back where i belong.

698
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:56,807
I couldn't live in a world
menaced by a bomb

699
00:47:56,842 --> 00:47:59,309
and i find out now that it
doesn't make any difference

700
00:47:59,927 --> 00:48:03,680
if it's a world
or 12 children burned in a fire.

701
00:48:03,715 --> 00:48:09,186
Even so, i've found
more than i expected

702
00:48:09,221 --> 00:48:11,688
because you were here.

703
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,702
I've overstayed
my welcome.

704
00:48:25,737 --> 00:48:27,955
Good-bye, abby.

705
00:48:27,990 --> 00:48:29,840
Stay well.

706
00:48:55,732 --> 00:48:57,618
Hello, harvey.

707
00:48:57,653 --> 00:48:59,486
Back so soon?

708
00:48:59,521 --> 00:49:02,623
Well, as it happens,
back a little late.

709
00:49:02,658 --> 00:49:05,125
You changed something?

710
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:06,376
I tried to.

711
00:49:06,994 --> 00:49:09,496
And in doing it,
i caused it.

712
00:49:09,531 --> 00:49:11,381
And now, paul?

713
00:49:11,416 --> 00:49:13,250
Where do you go now?

714
00:49:13,285 --> 00:49:15,135
Here.

715
00:49:15,170 --> 00:49:18,255
Here in the 20th century,
where i belong.

716
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:20,757
That's what i've learned,
harvey.

717
00:49:20,792 --> 00:49:23,260
To leave
the yesterdays alone...

718
00:49:23,295 --> 00:49:27,014
do something... do something
about the tomorrows.

719
00:49:27,648 --> 00:49:32,019
They're the ones that count,
the tomorrows.

720
00:49:32,054 --> 00:49:33,270
Tomorrows...

721
00:49:35,155 --> 00:49:38,909
god let there be tomorrows.

722
00:49:38,944 --> 00:49:39,660
Well.

723
00:49:44,031 --> 00:49:48,418
Incident on a july
afternoon, 1881.

724
00:49:48,453 --> 00:49:50,287
A man named driscoll
who came and went

725
00:49:50,322 --> 00:49:53,423
and, in the process,
learned a simple lesson

726
00:49:53,458 --> 00:49:57,794
perhaps best said by a poet
named lathberry, who wrote:

727
00:49:57,829 --> 00:50:01,548
"Children of yesterday,
heirs of tomorrow

728
00:50:01,583 --> 00:50:04,051
"what are you weaving,
labor and sorrow?

729
00:50:04,086 --> 00:50:06,553
"Look to your looms again,
faster and faster

730
00:50:06,588 --> 00:50:10,307
"fly the great shuttles
prepared by the master

731
00:50:10,342 --> 00:50:14,061
life's in the loom,
room for it, room."

732
00:50:14,096 --> 00:50:17,197
Tonight's tale
of clocks and calendars

733
00:50:17,232 --> 00:50:19,066
in the twilight zone.

734
00:50:24,321 --> 00:50:25,572
Next ontwilight zone,

735
00:50:25,607 --> 00:50:28,075
we take a page out of a book
on the space age,

736
00:50:28,110 --> 00:50:29,960
and we project
just a couple of degrees

737
00:50:29,995 --> 00:50:33,080
as to what conceivably might
happen to an astronaut

738
00:50:33,115 --> 00:50:36,216
if suddenly and inexplicably,
in the middle of an orbit,

739
00:50:36,251 --> 00:50:38,085
he disappears.

740
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:41,338
Our story tells you how,
why and where.

741
00:50:41,373 --> 00:50:43,090
It stars steve forrest.

742
00:50:43,125 --> 00:50:45,225
It's called "the parallel."

743
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:47,844
Capcom, capcom,
this is phebus ten.

744
00:50:47,879 --> 00:50:50,981
I've lost contact with you.

745
00:50:51,016 --> 00:50:52,849
I've lost radar here!
I've lost radar!

746
00:50:52,884 --> 00:50:55,352
We don't have
contact here, either.

747
00:50:55,387 --> 00:50:59,740
Capcom, capcom,
this is phebus ten.

748
00:51:03,493 --> 00:51:05,996
What you just told
me is fantastic.

749
00:51:06,031 --> 00:51:07,247
I helped build that spacecraft.

750
00:51:07,864 --> 00:51:09,249
I know it very well.

751
00:51:09,284 --> 00:51:11,118
It's not the same one
we sent off.

752
00:51:11,752 --> 00:51:13,003
It's almost
a twin to it,

753
00:51:13,038 --> 00:51:15,505
down to the very last
nut and bolt,

754
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:18,008
but it's simply
not the same spacecraft.

755
00:51:18,043 --> 00:51:21,128
Colonial gaines...
went up in one spacecraft,

756
00:51:21,163 --> 00:51:23,263
but he's obviously
come back in another.

757
