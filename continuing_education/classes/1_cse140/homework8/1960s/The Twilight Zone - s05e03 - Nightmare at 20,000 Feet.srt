1
00:00:06,556 --> 00:00:09,693
You unlock this door
with the key of imagination.

2
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:11,561
Beyond it
is another dimension-

3
00:00:11,596 --> 00:00:13,313
a dimension of sound...

4
00:00:14,733 --> 00:00:16,566
a dimension of sight...

5
00:00:16,601 --> 00:00:18,451
a dimension of mind.

6
00:00:18,486 --> 00:00:22,205
You're moving into a land
of both shadow and substance,

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,456
of things and ideas.

8
00:00:23,491 --> 00:00:27,210
You've just crossed over
into the twilight zone.

9
00:00:34,084 --> 00:00:35,969
And you?

10
00:00:36,004 --> 00:00:37,837
All right, fine.

11
00:00:37,872 --> 00:00:39,089
Enjoy your flight.

12
00:00:42,225 --> 00:00:43,476
Well, hello.

13
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:57,857
Those all right?

14
00:00:57,892 --> 00:00:59,743
Yeah. They're fine.

15
00:00:59,778 --> 00:01:01,611
Give me that.

16
00:01:03,496 --> 00:01:06,499
Do you want me to sit
next to the window?

17
00:01:06,534 --> 00:01:07,751
No.

18
00:01:07,786 --> 00:01:09,619
I'm fine.

19
00:01:09,654 --> 00:01:12,756
I can f...

20
00:01:12,791 --> 00:01:14,758
honey, what is it?

21
00:01:14,793 --> 00:01:18,378
The emergency window?

22
00:01:18,413 --> 00:01:19,512
Do you want to move?

23
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:22,015
No, no, no.
Doesn't matter.

24
00:01:22,632 --> 00:01:24,517
What's the
difference
where i sit?

25
00:01:24,552 --> 00:01:27,020
It's not the seat.
It's the airplane.

26
00:01:33,276 --> 00:01:35,145
Honey, don't smoke that now.

27
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,647
Wait till the plane
takes off.

28
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:43,286
I'm not acting much
like a cured man, am i?

29
00:01:43,321 --> 00:01:45,155
Honey, you are cured.

30
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:50,160
Dr. Martin wouldn't let you fly
if you weren't, would he?

31
00:01:50,195 --> 00:01:52,045
I suppose not.

32
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,913
I mean,
if you weren't well,

33
00:01:53,948 --> 00:01:57,667
dr. Martin just wouldn't let you
fly all the way back home.

34
00:01:57,702 --> 00:01:59,552
It's just that simple.

35
00:01:59,587 --> 00:02:02,055
Well, you make it
sound simple anyway.

36
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:03,306
It is, bob.

37
00:02:03,341 --> 00:02:05,175
Yeah.

38
00:02:07,677 --> 00:02:09,562
Here i am
hogging the whole state,

39
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,431
and you're so tired.

40
00:02:11,466 --> 00:02:13,933
I've missed you...

41
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:15,819
these last six months.

42
00:02:18,938 --> 00:02:23,326
It's all over now, though,
and mama's taking you home.

43
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:29,582
It must have been
awful for you-

44
00:02:29,617 --> 00:02:31,451
taking care
of the kids...

45
00:02:31,486 --> 00:02:33,953
bearing the full
responsibility.

46
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:37,090
Well, everything
is still intact.

47
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:38,958
Except me.

48
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:43,346
Bob, i'm not
going to let...

49
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:47,717
cabin door secured.

50
00:02:47,752 --> 00:02:49,602
What?

51
00:02:49,637 --> 00:02:52,105
Just a little...

52
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,607
abject cowardice,
that's all.

53
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,978
I'm going to be all right.

54
00:03:02,732 --> 00:03:05,235
Had a teensy weensy breakdown,

55
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:06,486
but now i'm cured.

56
00:03:06,521 --> 00:03:09,622
Understanding- it's wonderful.

57
00:03:09,657 --> 00:03:13,993
It isn't the airplane at all.

58
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:17,747
Overtension and overanxiety
due to underconfidence.

59
00:03:17,782 --> 00:03:19,132
Your seat belt, sir.

60
00:03:42,272 --> 00:03:44,774
Portrait of a frightened man:

61
00:03:44,809 --> 00:03:46,025
Mr. Robert wilson- 37,

62
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:49,162
husband, father and salesman
on sick leave.

63
00:03:49,197 --> 00:03:52,282
Mr. Wilson has just been
discharged from a sanitarium

64
00:03:52,317 --> 00:03:54,167
where he spent
the last six months

65
00:03:54,202 --> 00:03:56,035
recovering
from a nervous breakdown,

66
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,921
the onset of which took place

67
00:03:57,956 --> 00:04:00,423
on an evening
not dissimilar to this one

68
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:02,292
on an airliner
very much like the one

69
00:04:02,327 --> 00:04:04,928
in which mr. Wilson
is about to be flown home-

70
00:04:04,963 --> 00:04:08,681
the difference being that,
on that evening half a year ago,

71
00:04:08,716 --> 00:04:11,184
mr. Wilson's flight
was terminated

72
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:13,686
by the onslaught
of his mental breakdown.

73
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:15,555
Tonight, he's traveling
all the way

74
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,440
to his appointed destination

75
00:04:17,475 --> 00:04:19,943
which,
contrary to mr. Wilson's plan,

76
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:21,811
happens to be
in the darkest corner

77
00:04:21,846 --> 00:04:23,696
of the twilight zone.

78
00:04:52,141 --> 00:04:55,261
Fasten your seat belt, sir.

79
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:02,151
Fasten your seat belt, sir.

80
00:05:08,658 --> 00:05:10,526
I'm sorry, darling.

81
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:11,778
Go back to sleep.

82
00:05:14,315 --> 00:05:17,417
I shouldn't have taken
that sleeping pill.

83
00:05:17,452 --> 00:05:19,285
I should stay awake
with you.

84
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,170
No, i don't
want you to.

85
00:05:21,205 --> 00:05:22,422
Go back to sleep.
I'm all right.

86
00:05:22,457 --> 00:05:24,290
Can't you sleep?

87
00:05:24,325 --> 00:05:25,541
I will.

88
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:27,427
Don't worry about me.

89
00:05:27,462 --> 00:05:29,295
Okay.

90
00:06:37,747 --> 00:06:39,115
Here, quickly!

91
00:06:40,616 --> 00:06:41,868
May i help you?

92
00:06:41,903 --> 00:06:43,119
There's a man
out there.

93
00:06:43,154 --> 00:06:44,370
What?

94
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:46,873
Look, he's crawling on...

95
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,265
i'm...

96
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:56,883
i'm sorry.

97
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:59,385
Must have been the...

98
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,270
bob? What is it?

99
00:07:01,305 --> 00:07:03,139
Oh, it's nothing,
mrs. Wilson.

100
00:07:03,174 --> 00:07:05,641
Can i get you
anything?

101
00:07:05,676 --> 00:07:08,144
A glass of water.

102
00:07:08,179 --> 00:07:09,395
Surely.

103
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,532
Is something wrong?

104
00:07:12,567 --> 00:07:15,651
No. I thought i saw
something out there.

105
00:07:15,686 --> 00:07:16,903
What?

106
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:21,791
Nothing.

107
00:07:26,162 --> 00:07:28,664
I guess i need a little sleep.

108
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:30,550
Are you all right?

109
00:07:30,585 --> 00:07:32,668
Yeah, fine.

110
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:38,925
Don't you think
you ought to take

111
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,810
a sleeping pill now?

112
00:07:40,845 --> 00:07:42,678
Yeah, i'll take
one of those.

113
00:07:48,317 --> 00:07:49,569
Here you are.

114
00:07:49,604 --> 00:07:50,820
Thank you.

115
00:07:50,855 --> 00:07:52,071
You're welcome.

116
00:07:52,688 --> 00:07:53,940
Can i get you
a blanket?

117
00:07:53,975 --> 00:07:56,442
No. Honey?

118
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:00,830
Oh. No, thanks.

119
00:08:10,206 --> 00:08:11,958
You going
to be all right now?

120
00:08:11,993 --> 00:08:14,460
Yeah. Fine.

121
00:08:16,345 --> 00:08:18,848
Will you wake me
if you need me?

122
00:08:18,883 --> 00:08:21,350
I will.

123
00:09:12,268 --> 00:09:13,903
It isn't there.

124
00:09:15,771 --> 00:09:17,657
It isn't there.

125
00:09:20,776 --> 00:09:23,279
Honey? Would you
wake up, honey?

126
00:09:23,314 --> 00:09:25,031
Quickly.

127
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:33,789
Yes, mr. Wilson?

128
00:09:33,824 --> 00:09:35,675
Can i help you,
mr. Wilson?

129
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:44,183
Are we going
into a storm?

130
00:09:44,218 --> 00:09:45,434
Just a small one.

131
00:09:45,469 --> 00:09:47,937
Nothing to worry about.

132
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:57,313
Honey...

133
00:09:59,815 --> 00:10:02,818
would you wake up,
please, honey?

134
00:11:09,051 --> 00:11:10,803
Honey.

135
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:15,191
Julia, wake up.

136
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:18,310
What?

137
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:23,816
What are you looking at?

138
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:26,952
Bob?

139
00:11:26,987 --> 00:11:29,455
Is it the storm?

140
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:31,323
Does it bother you?

141
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:32,575
No.

142
00:11:33,209 --> 00:11:36,328
Honey, you remember
what i told you before

143
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:38,831
about seeing
something outside?

144
00:11:38,866 --> 00:11:40,716
Yes.

145
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:46,972
Julia, there's
a man out there.

146
00:11:49,225 --> 00:11:50,476
L-i don't mean a man.

147
00:11:50,511 --> 00:11:51,727
I mean a...

148
00:11:51,762 --> 00:11:52,978
i don't know what i mean.

149
00:11:53,013 --> 00:11:54,847
I mean...

150
00:11:54,882 --> 00:11:56,732
maybe a...

151
00:11:56,767 --> 00:11:59,852
what did they call them
during the war-

152
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:02,354
you know, the pilots-

153
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:04,857
gremlins.

154
00:12:06,108 --> 00:12:07,993
Gremlins!

155
00:12:08,028 --> 00:12:10,496
You remember
the stories in the...

156
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:14,867
julia, don't look at me
like that.

157
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:16,118
Bob...

158
00:12:16,153 --> 00:12:18,003
i am not imagining it.

159
00:12:18,038 --> 00:12:19,872
I'm not imagining it.

160
00:12:19,907 --> 00:12:21,123
He's out there.

161
00:12:21,158 --> 00:12:23,008
Don't look!

162
00:12:23,043 --> 00:12:24,260
He's not there now.

163
00:12:24,295 --> 00:12:26,128
He...

164
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:29,265
...jumps away

165
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,767
whenever anyone
might see him.

166
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:36,772
Except me.

167
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:41,777
Honey, he's there.

168
00:12:41,812 --> 00:12:44,780
I realize what
this sounds like.

169
00:12:44,815 --> 00:12:47,283
Do i look insane?

170
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,785
No, darling, no.

171
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:51,654
I know i had a mental breakdown.

172
00:12:52,288 --> 00:12:53,539
I know i had it in an airplane.

173
00:12:53,574 --> 00:12:56,659
I know it looks as if
the same thing's happening,

174
00:12:56,694 --> 00:12:58,544
but it isn't.

175
00:12:58,579 --> 00:13:01,046
I'm sure it isn't.

176
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:09,171
Look, the reason
i'm telling you this...

177
00:13:09,805 --> 00:13:11,056
isn't just to worry you.

178
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:13,559
You notice
i didn't tell you before.

179
00:13:13,594 --> 00:13:14,810
I want you to tell me.

180
00:13:14,845 --> 00:13:17,930
I didn't tell you before
because i wasn't sure

181
00:13:17,965 --> 00:13:20,432
whether it was real or not,
but i am sure now.

182
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:21,684
It is real.

183
00:13:21,719 --> 00:13:23,569
There's a man out there!

184
00:13:23,604 --> 00:13:25,437
Or... a... a gremlin, or...

185
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:27,323
whatever it...

186
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:32,328
if i described him to you,

187
00:13:32,363 --> 00:13:34,196
you'd really think i was gone.

188
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:37,333
No, darling,
it's all right, it's all right.

189
00:13:37,368 --> 00:13:40,703
Julia, i know
your intentions are good.

190
00:13:40,738 --> 00:13:45,090
I know you love me
and sympathize with me,

191
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,959
but don't patronize me.

192
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:48,844
I am not insane!

193
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:50,346
Did i say...?

194
00:13:50,381 --> 00:13:51,597
It doesn't have
to be said.

195
00:13:51,632 --> 00:13:53,465
It's in your face,
in your...

196
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,968
look, for the last time,
that creature's out there

197
00:13:56,003 --> 00:13:57,853
and the reason
i'm telling you is

198
00:13:57,888 --> 00:14:00,973
he's starting to tamper
with one of the engines.

199
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:03,475
Look. Look.

200
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,366
Look. Think
anything you want.

201
00:14:10,401 --> 00:14:13,485
Think... i belong
in a straightjacket

202
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,737
if it pleases you.

203
00:14:14,772 --> 00:14:15,988
If it pleases me?

204
00:14:16,023 --> 00:14:17,873
No, l-i didn't mean that.

205
00:14:17,908 --> 00:14:19,124
What i mean is...

206
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:20,993
whatever you think of me-

207
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:23,495
that i'm losing
my mind, anything-

208
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,747
all i'm asking
you to do

209
00:14:24,782 --> 00:14:27,249
is to tell the pilots
what i've said.

210
00:14:27,284 --> 00:14:29,752
Ask them to keep
an eye on the wings.

211
00:14:29,787 --> 00:14:32,137
If they see nothing...

212
00:14:35,257 --> 00:14:37,142
...all right.

213
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:43,399
All right, then i'll...

214
00:14:43,434 --> 00:14:45,901
commit myself. I'll...

215
00:14:48,404 --> 00:14:50,272
but if they do...

216
00:14:58,414 --> 00:15:00,282
won't you even
allow the possibility?

217
00:15:00,317 --> 00:15:02,167
I'll tell them.

218
00:15:02,202 --> 00:15:05,421
I know it's...

219
00:15:05,456 --> 00:15:08,540
asking a lot. I...

220
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:10,426
it's like asking you to...

221
00:15:10,461 --> 00:15:13,545
advertise your marriage
to a lunatic.

222
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,047
No, i'll tell them.

223
00:15:15,082 --> 00:15:18,300
You just sit tight,
and i'll go tell them.

224
00:15:23,724 --> 00:15:25,557
Mrs. Wilson,
what's the problem?

225
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:27,443
My husband
wants to see

226
00:15:27,478 --> 00:15:28,694
the flight engineer.

227
00:15:28,729 --> 00:15:30,562
All right,
i'll get him.

228
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:32,064
Thank you.

229
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:33,315
It's very
important.

230
00:15:35,853 --> 00:15:37,069
Hurry, please.

231
00:15:45,828 --> 00:15:47,713
Hurry! Hurry!

232
00:15:47,748 --> 00:15:50,833
He's out there!

233
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:53,969
What's going on?

234
00:15:54,004 --> 00:15:55,471
He's pulling up
one of the cowling plates.

235
00:15:55,506 --> 00:15:57,339
"He"?

236
00:15:57,374 --> 00:15:59,475
Didn't my wife...?

237
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:02,594
There's a man out there!

238
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:03,479
Keep your voice down.

239
00:16:03,514 --> 00:16:04,730
I'm sorry,
i'm sorry.

240
00:16:04,765 --> 00:16:07,232
I don't know
what's going on here...

241
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:08,600
will you look?

242
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:09,985
Mr. Wilson,
i'm warning you.

243
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,103
Will you please look?

244
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:12,354
In the name of...!

245
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:19,862
Well?

246
00:16:22,998 --> 00:16:24,616
No, wait a minute.

247
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:29,621
I saw him pull
that plate up.

248
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:34,760
I said i saw him
pull that plate up!

249
00:16:34,795 --> 00:16:36,512
Mr. Wilson, please.

250
00:16:36,547 --> 00:16:37,763
All right, you saw him,

251
00:16:37,798 --> 00:16:40,265
but there are
other people aboard.

252
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,134
We mustn't alarm them.

253
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:45,020
You mean, you've seen him too?

254
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,138
Of course we have,

255
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:48,640
but we don't want to
frighten the passengers.

256
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:49,892
You can understand that.

257
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:51,777
Of course. Of...

258
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:00,536
i understand.

259
00:17:00,571 --> 00:17:02,905
Now, the thing
we've got to remember...

260
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,156
you can stop now.

261
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:04,790
Bob...
sir...

262
00:17:04,825 --> 00:17:06,041
get out of here.

263
00:17:06,076 --> 00:17:07,292
Mr. Wilson...

264
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:09,161
i said you can stop.

265
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:10,412
Honey, what is it?

266
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,051
I won't say
another word.

267
00:17:16,086 --> 00:17:17,920
I'll see us crash first.

268
00:17:17,955 --> 00:17:19,171
Bob!

269
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:21,673
Mr. Wilson, try to
understand our position.

270
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:28,814
Honey,
i'll be right back.

271
00:17:38,073 --> 00:17:40,576
He did pull it up.

272
00:17:40,611 --> 00:17:43,078
He did.

273
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:19,481
Honey, i was going
to tell them when you...

274
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:21,366
were you?

275
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:28,240
For me?

276
00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:30,125
Please, bob.

277
00:18:45,641 --> 00:18:46,892
You'll sleep.

278
00:18:46,927 --> 00:18:48,760
You'll sleep now,
darling.

279
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,514
Sure.

280
00:19:09,665 --> 00:19:10,916
Oh, boy.

281
00:19:10,951 --> 00:19:12,167
What did you do?

282
00:19:12,202 --> 00:19:14,036
Get his wife to give
him those pills?

283
00:19:14,071 --> 00:19:15,287
He'll be out for hours.

284
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:17,789
I hope so- the way
the storm is coming up.

285
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:20,292
Don't worry,
everything's fine.

286
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:22,177
I hope so.

287
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:24,166
Honey? Honey,
would you get me

288
00:21:24,201 --> 00:21:26,051
a glass of
water, please?

289
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:31,673
A glass of water,
please. Hurry.

290
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:37,182
Nuttiest way
of trying to commit suicide

291
00:23:37,217 --> 00:23:38,433
i ever heard of.

292
00:23:38,468 --> 00:23:41,303
It's all right now,
darling.

293
00:23:45,056 --> 00:23:48,193
I know,

294
00:23:48,228 --> 00:23:51,947
but i'm the only one
who does know...

295
00:23:51,982 --> 00:23:55,066
right now.

296
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:58,703
The flight of mr. Robert wilson
has ended now,

297
00:23:58,738 --> 00:24:01,823
a flight not only
from point "a" to point "b,"

298
00:24:01,858 --> 00:24:05,577
but also from the fear
of recurring mental breakdown.

299
00:24:05,612 --> 00:24:08,079
Mr. Wilson
has that fear no longer.

300
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:10,582
Though, for the moment,
he is, as he has said,

301
00:24:10,617 --> 00:24:12,467
alone in this assurance.

302
00:24:12,502 --> 00:24:14,970
Happily, his conviction
will not remain isolated

303
00:24:15,005 --> 00:24:18,089
too much longer, for happily,
tangible manifestation

304
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:20,592
is very often left
as evidence of trespass,

305
00:24:20,627 --> 00:24:23,728
even from
so intangible a quarter

306
00:24:23,763 --> 00:24:25,597
as the twilight zone.

307
00:24:31,486 --> 00:24:32,687
And now, mr. Serling.

308
00:24:32,722 --> 00:24:33,939
Next time onthe twilight zone,

309
00:24:33,974 --> 00:24:35,190
we probe into
the element of time

310
00:24:35,225 --> 00:24:36,441
and present a very oddball opus

311
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:38,326
entitled,
"a kind of a stopwatch."

312
00:24:38,361 --> 00:24:40,829
We tell the story of a man,
a stopwatch,

313
00:24:40,864 --> 00:24:42,697
and an incredible deviation
from the norm,

314
00:24:42,732 --> 00:24:45,200
said norm being
the usual 24 hour day,

315
00:24:45,235 --> 00:24:47,085
said deviation
involving what happens

316
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,205
when a stopwatch is pushed and
everything stop, not just time.

317
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,341
To titillate and intrigue-
"a kind of a stopwatch."

318
00:24:53,376 --> 00:24:55,844
Next ontwilight zone.
