1
00:00:10,777 --> 00:00:13,279
You're traveling
through another dimension-

2
00:00:13,314 --> 00:00:17,033
a dimension not only of sight
and sound, but of mind,

3
00:00:17,068 --> 00:00:18,902
a journey into a wondrous land

4
00:00:18,937 --> 00:00:21,404
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

5
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,907
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

6
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:37,670
Nut.

7
00:00:42,675 --> 00:00:43,927
Hello?

8
00:00:43,962 --> 00:00:46,429
I'd like to speak
to mr. O'connor, please.

9
00:00:46,464 --> 00:00:48,932
That's correct.

10
00:00:48,967 --> 00:00:50,183
I'd rather not say.

11
00:00:50,218 --> 00:00:52,068
It's rather personal.

12
00:00:54,571 --> 00:00:57,073
Hello, is this mr. O'connor?

13
00:00:57,108 --> 00:01:01,444
Mr. O'connor, you have a man
working for you in personnel-

14
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:03,947
a young man
named alfred brewster.

15
00:01:03,982 --> 00:01:08,334
That's right- been with you
about a year and a half.

16
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:10,837
The man's a communist.

17
00:01:10,872 --> 00:01:12,705
That's right.

18
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,208
The man's a communist,
a menace to society-

19
00:01:15,243 --> 00:01:17,093
should be discharged
immediately.

20
00:01:17,128 --> 00:01:20,213
Never mind how i know-
i know, that's all.

21
00:01:20,248 --> 00:01:22,715
I'm going to check back
with you in a few days,

22
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:25,218
and if he's not been discharged,

23
00:01:25,253 --> 00:01:28,354
i'm going to take
this whole matter to a superior.

24
00:01:28,389 --> 00:01:28,972
That's correct.

25
00:01:29,007 --> 00:01:30,223
Bye, mr. O'connor.

26
00:01:52,495 --> 00:01:54,998
School superintendent, please.

27
00:01:56,883 --> 00:01:59,385
Hello, is this
the school superintendent?

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,254
Well,
this is a concerned citizen,

29
00:02:01,289 --> 00:02:05,008
and this call has to do
with a teacher in your employ.

30
00:02:05,043 --> 00:02:06,893
His name is...

31
00:02:06,928 --> 00:02:10,013
farwell... william j. Farwell-

32
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:13,149
teaches at your
north end high school.

33
00:02:13,184 --> 00:02:14,400
That's correct.

34
00:02:14,435 --> 00:02:16,269
Well, the man
is morally objectionable.

35
00:02:16,304 --> 00:02:19,405
He's a drinker, a carouser,
and i have it on good authority

36
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,908
that his relationships
with his students

37
00:02:21,943 --> 00:02:23,159
are questionable at best.

38
00:02:23,194 --> 00:02:25,028
He should be
discharged immediately.

39
00:02:25,063 --> 00:02:27,530
Well, never mind who this is.

40
00:02:27,565 --> 00:02:29,415
I happen to be giving you facts

41
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:32,535
and these facts are
what is at issue.

42
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:34,420
Well, you'd best check on him.

43
00:02:34,455 --> 00:02:36,923
That...
you most certainly should.

44
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:40,043
And immediately-
that's... that's correct.

45
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:00,563
A rather full morning's work,
wouldn't you say, pete?

46
00:03:02,483 --> 00:03:06,819
Eleven names.

47
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:09,322
Of course,
it's questionable at best

48
00:03:09,357 --> 00:03:12,458
as to what concrete
results we can expect,

49
00:03:12,493 --> 00:03:14,961
but at least,
the seeds have been planted;

50
00:03:14,996 --> 00:03:18,081
the opening guns fired;
the first attack rendered.

51
00:03:18,116 --> 00:03:22,468
Look at them, look at them
out there- the dregs, carrion,

52
00:03:22,503 --> 00:03:25,088
leeches sucking us dry,

53
00:03:25,123 --> 00:03:28,841
carrying evil around with them
like cold germs.

54
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:33,846
Well, we're going to have to
face it sooner or later, pete.

55
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:35,732
Phone calls are one thing,

56
00:03:35,767 --> 00:03:38,851
threats and exposures
simply expedients.

57
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:40,737
Oh, no, pete, my old friend,

58
00:03:40,772 --> 00:03:43,239
we're going to have to embark

59
00:03:43,274 --> 00:03:45,108
on a much more ambitious course

60
00:03:45,742 --> 00:03:46,993
and it must be today, pete.

61
00:03:47,028 --> 00:03:49,495
It must be this afternoon.

62
00:03:55,118 --> 00:03:57,003
4:00, pete.

63
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,505
That's when we'll make it occur.

64
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,374
We'll make it occur at 4:00.

65
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:04,510
At that moment,
that precise moment,

66
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:06,379
we shall destroy evil.

67
00:04:06,414 --> 00:04:10,767
This is both my charge
and my obligation, pete,

68
00:04:10,802 --> 00:04:16,389
to destroy evil,
and we shall do it at 4:00.

69
00:04:16,424 --> 00:04:18,891
I'm not quite sure
of the method yet,

70
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:20,777
but that will come to me.

71
00:04:20,812 --> 00:04:25,148
That will come to me assuredly,
and it will be a revelation.

72
00:04:25,183 --> 00:04:27,650
It will be
the expiration of immorality,

73
00:04:27,685 --> 00:04:30,787
the exordium of the end.

74
00:04:30,822 --> 00:04:33,906
4:00, pete,
that's when we'll make it happen

75
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:37,660
through whatever form i choose.

76
00:04:37,695 --> 00:04:40,163
Four o'clock.

77
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:43,299
That's oliver crangle,

78
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:45,802
a dealer
in petulance and poison.

79
00:04:45,837 --> 00:04:48,304
He's rather arbitrarily
chosen 4:00

80
00:04:48,339 --> 00:04:50,173
as his personal
gotterdammerung,

81
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:52,058
and we are about to watch

82
00:04:52,093 --> 00:04:54,560
the metamorphosis
of a twisted fanatic,

83
00:04:54,595 --> 00:04:57,063
poisoned by the gangrene
of prejudice,

84
00:04:57,098 --> 00:04:59,565
to the status
of an avenging angel,

85
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,685
upright and omniscient,
dedicated and fearsome.

86
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,188
Whatever your clocks say,
it's 4:00-

87
00:05:05,223 --> 00:05:06,439
and wherever you are

88
00:05:06,474 --> 00:05:10,193
it happens to be
the twilight zone.

89
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,217
Yes, what is it?

90
00:05:34,252 --> 00:05:37,970
There's special delivery stuff
for you, mr. Crangle.

91
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:41,107
Well, bring it in-
the door's not locked.

92
00:05:49,232 --> 00:05:49,866
Something else,

93
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:51,734
was there,
mrs. Williams?

94
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:53,619
Something else?

95
00:05:53,654 --> 00:05:54,620
No, nothing else.

96
00:05:54,655 --> 00:05:56,489
Nothing else,
mr. Crangle.

97
00:05:56,524 --> 00:05:58,991
You sure get
enough mail, anyway.

98
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:00,243
Somebody would think

99
00:06:00,278 --> 00:06:03,379
you ran sort
of a mail-order business.

100
00:06:03,414 --> 00:06:05,381
What i do is
none of your concern.

101
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:09,135
I pay my rent on time
and i mind my own business.

102
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:11,637
You should learn
a respect for privacy.

103
00:06:11,672 --> 00:06:14,006
Well, i...

104
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,258
well, i nev...!

105
00:06:15,293 --> 00:06:16,509
"Well, i...! Well, i...!"

106
00:06:16,544 --> 00:06:19,645
Have you any more pertinent
remarks to make?

107
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,765
If not, then i would be
grateful if you left me alone.

108
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,268
I have a great deal
of work to do.

109
00:06:25,303 --> 00:06:26,152
I can believe that.

110
00:06:26,187 --> 00:06:27,403
You should,

111
00:06:27,438 --> 00:06:28,654
mrs. Williams.

112
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:31,157
You may thank me one day.

113
00:06:31,192 --> 00:06:33,659
That is...
assuming you're around,

114
00:06:33,694 --> 00:06:38,030
and assuming you retain
a capacity for appreciation.

115
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:41,284
And what's that
supposed to mean-

116
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:43,786
"assuming i'll
be around"?

117
00:06:43,821 --> 00:06:47,540
Are you threatening
me, mr. Crangle?

118
00:06:47,575 --> 00:06:51,294
My dear lady, i don't
threaten people.

119
00:06:51,329 --> 00:06:52,545
I compile them.

120
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:56,933
I compile them and i...
investigate them...

121
00:06:56,968 --> 00:06:58,184
analyze them.

122
00:06:58,219 --> 00:07:00,052
Then i
categorize them,

123
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:01,938
and i judge them.

124
00:07:01,973 --> 00:07:03,806
If they're impure
and evil,

125
00:07:03,841 --> 00:07:06,309
then they must
be punished.

126
00:07:06,344 --> 00:07:07,560
If, on the other hand,

127
00:07:07,595 --> 00:07:10,062
they're simply
misled or naive

128
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:11,948
or unsophisticated,

129
00:07:11,983 --> 00:07:15,067
then i point out
to them the right way.

130
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:16,319
Oh, is that...?

131
00:07:16,354 --> 00:07:17,570
What i mean is,

132
00:07:17,605 --> 00:07:20,072
is that what you do
for a living, i mean?

133
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:21,324
Indeed.

134
00:07:21,359 --> 00:07:22,575
Here.

135
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:25,211
"Mrs. Chloe williams,
age 54, widow;

136
00:07:25,246 --> 00:07:27,713
"married
to john alistair williams;

137
00:07:27,748 --> 00:07:29,582

138
00:07:29,617 --> 00:07:32,084
"husband's political
none;

139
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:34,587
none;

140

curiosity..."

141
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:42,094
"ignorance."

142
00:07:42,845 --> 00:07:45,348
That is merely
a preliminary report,

143
00:07:45,383 --> 00:07:46,599
mrs. Williams.

144
00:07:46,634 --> 00:07:48,484
The research
in depth on you

145
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:50,987
is in that master
file over there.

146
00:07:51,022 --> 00:07:52,238
Nut.

147
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:56,742
All rested up,
are you, pete?

148
00:07:56,777 --> 00:07:58,611
Had your little nap?

149
00:07:58,646 --> 00:07:59,862
That's good,
my young man.

150
00:07:59,897 --> 00:08:01,113
We're going
to have

151
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:02,365
an exciting
afternoon.

152
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,616
Things are
going

153
00:08:03,651 --> 00:08:04,867
to happen
at 4:00.

154
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:05,501
Indeed
they will.

155
00:08:05,536 --> 00:08:08,004
What's going to happen at 4:00?

156
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:10,256
What's going to happen indeed?

157
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:14,627
Why, at 4:00,
we're going to expose evil-

158
00:08:14,662 --> 00:08:19,015
strip it bare,
push it out into the light

159
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:21,517
dissect it,
pinpoint it,

160
00:08:21,552 --> 00:08:23,386
eliminate it,
exorcise it,

161
00:08:23,421 --> 00:08:25,888
denude it,
destroy it!

162
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:26,522
Oh!

163
00:08:30,893 --> 00:08:33,396
Something else,
was there,

164
00:08:33,431 --> 00:08:35,281
mrs. Williams?

165
00:08:35,316 --> 00:08:37,783
Uh... uh, no, no,
nothing else.

166
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:47,410
I'm looking
for a mr. Crangle.

167
00:08:47,445 --> 00:08:48,661
I was told he lives here.

168
00:08:48,696 --> 00:08:50,546
Oh, yes, with a vengeance
he lives here.

169
00:08:50,581 --> 00:08:53,049
He lives right up there.
That's where he lives.

170
00:08:53,084 --> 00:08:54,300
But i tell you, young woman,

171
00:08:54,335 --> 00:08:56,802
i wouldn't go in there
without police protection.

172
00:08:56,837 --> 00:08:59,305
That man's got a
leak in his attic

173
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,807
a mile wide.

174
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:18,074
Mr. Crangle?

175
00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:24,330
Mr. Crangle!

176
00:09:25,581 --> 00:09:27,450
Well?

177
00:09:27,485 --> 00:09:28,701
My name is lucas.

178
00:09:28,736 --> 00:09:29,335
I was wondering

179
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,837
if you would speak
with me for a moment.

180
00:09:31,872 --> 00:09:35,591
Lucas... lucas...

181
00:09:35,626 --> 00:09:37,460
ah! Kurt j.
Lucas, age 27,

182
00:09:37,495 --> 00:09:39,962
intern, east
side hospital?

183
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:41,847
That's my husband.

184
00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:43,099
Is he indeed?

185
00:09:43,134 --> 00:09:45,601
Well, now, your
husband, you say.

186
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:48,721
Come in, come
in, come in.

187
00:09:48,756 --> 00:09:50,856
Please.

188
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:55,227
Now...

189
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:57,113
what about
your husband?

190
00:09:57,148 --> 00:10:00,232
Why, mr. Crangle,

191
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:02,234
why are you trying to hurt him?

192
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:04,120
What has he ever done to you?

193
00:10:04,155 --> 00:10:05,371
To me?

194
00:10:05,406 --> 00:10:06,238
Why, nothing to me.

195
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:08,124
That is, nothing personally.

196
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:09,992
I don't know your husband.

197
00:10:10,027 --> 00:10:11,243
I knowofhim.

198
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:14,380
I know of his background,
but we've never met.

199
00:10:14,415 --> 00:10:17,249
He's a stranger then
to you, isn't he?

200
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:18,501
He's a perfect stranger.

201
00:10:18,536 --> 00:10:19,752
A stranger, yes,

202
00:10:19,787 --> 00:10:21,637
but not
a perfect stranger.

203
00:10:21,672 --> 00:10:24,757
As a matter of fact,
your husband, mrs. Lucas,

204
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:27,893
happens to be
most... imperfect.

205
00:10:27,928 --> 00:10:29,145
And when you observe

206
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:31,013
that he has
done nothing to me,

207
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:33,516
let me hasten to
illuminate you on this.

208
00:10:33,551 --> 00:10:35,401
He has done a lot
against society.

209
00:10:35,436 --> 00:10:37,903
My husband, for
your information,

210
00:10:37,938 --> 00:10:39,155
is a dedicated
young doctor.

211
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:41,657
He has only one
abiding interest

212
00:10:41,692 --> 00:10:43,526
and that is to heal,
to stop pain.

213
00:10:43,561 --> 00:10:44,777
And to kill!

214
00:10:44,812 --> 00:10:47,279
That's his other
abiding interest

215
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:49,782
that you have
conveniently skipped.

216
00:10:49,817 --> 00:10:52,284
L, l, l, l, l,
l, l, l...

217
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:58,174
l-u... l-u-c... here we are.

218
00:10:58,209 --> 00:10:59,425
"Lucas,

219
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,427
"kurt j., m.d.,
second-year intern

220
00:11:01,462 --> 00:11:02,678
east side hospital."

221
00:11:02,713 --> 00:11:04,930
These facts came
to my attention.

222
00:11:04,965 --> 00:11:06,799
"On the night
of march 12, 1961,

223
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:09,301
"while serving in
the emergency ward

224
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:13,055
"he permitted the death
of one mrs. Angela rienti

225
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:15,307
"by failing to
relieve pressure

226
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:16,559
"resulting of
a brain injury

227
00:11:17,193 --> 00:11:18,561
from a traffic accident."

228
00:11:18,596 --> 00:11:19,812
It was
too late-

229
00:11:19,847 --> 00:11:21,313
he got to her too late.

230
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:23,199
He was taking care
of half a ward,

231
00:11:23,234 --> 00:11:26,318
and when he got to her,
she was already dead.

232
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:28,571
He should have gotten
to her earlier.

233
00:11:28,606 --> 00:11:31,707
That's about the size
of it, mrs. Lucas.

234
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:39,215
By what right, i must
ask you, mr. Crangle,

235
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,083
by what right
do you presume

236
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:42,968
to pass judgment
on my husband?

237
00:11:43,003 --> 00:11:44,837
You're not even
a medical man.

238
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:46,722
You don't know
a thing about it

239
00:11:46,757 --> 00:11:49,842
and yet you write
letters to the hospital,

240
00:11:49,877 --> 00:11:51,093
dozens of letters,

241
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:53,596
accusing my husband
of being a murderer.

242
00:11:53,631 --> 00:11:55,481
You're a filthy,
miserable...

243
00:11:55,516 --> 00:11:56,732
tell me,

244
00:11:56,767 --> 00:11:59,235
have they... discharged
your husband yet?

245
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:01,737
I've been expecting
it momentarily.

246
00:12:01,772 --> 00:12:02,988
They have not.

247
00:12:03,023 --> 00:12:06,108
It would take more
than letter writing

248
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:07,993
from a crank
to make that happen.

249
00:12:08,028 --> 00:12:09,862
Your husband
is an evil man!

250
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:12,998
I will not put up
with evil in any form-

251
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:16,118
communists, subversives,
thieves, harlots-

252
00:12:16,153 --> 00:12:17,369
evil, all of them,

253
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:19,872
and i will not
countenance evil.

254
00:12:19,907 --> 00:12:21,123
Do you hear me?

255
00:12:21,158 --> 00:12:23,626
I will absolutely not
countenance evil.

256
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:29,265
Hmm.

257
00:12:36,138 --> 00:12:38,023
You're probably
unaware of it,

258
00:12:38,058 --> 00:12:39,275
mr. Crangle,

259
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:41,777
but my husband is
a very sensitive man.

260
00:12:41,812 --> 00:12:43,646
The people at the
hospital told him

261
00:12:43,681 --> 00:12:45,531
to overlook
the letters,

262
00:12:45,566 --> 00:12:46,148
forget about them,

263
00:12:46,782 --> 00:12:48,033
but they're
killing him.

264
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:58,911
Tell me, mr. Crangle, why...

265
00:12:58,946 --> 00:13:03,299
why do you do it?

266
00:13:03,334 --> 00:13:04,550
Why?!

267
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:10,172
Why?

268
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:12,675
You ask me why?

269
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:17,680
Why, because
they're evil.

270
00:13:17,715 --> 00:13:20,816
That's it.

271
00:13:20,851 --> 00:13:23,319
There's nothing
complicated about that.

272
00:13:23,354 --> 00:13:25,821
They're evil-

273
00:13:25,856 --> 00:13:31,443
all those little bugs
out there- bacteria.

274
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:33,078
That's what
they are.

275
00:13:33,113 --> 00:13:35,581
That's what
your husband is-

276
00:13:35,616 --> 00:13:37,333
bacteria.

277
00:13:37,368 --> 00:13:37,950
Those little...

278
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:45,341
that's it!

279
00:13:45,376 --> 00:13:47,843
That's
precisely it!

280
00:13:47,878 --> 00:13:49,712
That's
what i'll do.

281
00:13:50,846 --> 00:13:53,349
I knew i would get the clue.

282
00:13:53,384 --> 00:13:56,468
I said "little people."

283
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:58,354
"Little people"?

284
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:06,478
That's what i'll do-

285
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:11,483
i'll turn all the evil people
into little ones.

286
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:13,986
You understand?

287
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:17,740
I'll make
every evil man three...

288
00:14:17,775 --> 00:14:20,242
no, two... two feet tall.

289
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:25,881
At 4:00
in the afternoon,

290
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:27,750
at precisely 4:00,

291
00:14:27,785 --> 00:14:29,635
every evil man
and woman

292
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:32,755
will be exactly
two feet tall.

293
00:14:35,891 --> 00:14:42,147
A revelation...
an absolute revelation.

294
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:46,518
They'll all be
two feet tall!

295
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:12,177
"It is rather for us
to be dedicated

296
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:18,434
to the great task
remaining before us."

297
00:15:23,439 --> 00:15:28,444
"All men are created equal."

298
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,458
We have a visitor
coming, pete.

299
00:15:43,826 --> 00:15:45,711
Come in!

300
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:51,834
Come in, come in.

301
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:53,719
I'm oliver crangle.

302
00:15:53,754 --> 00:15:54,970
I'm the one
who called.

303
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:57,473
My name is hall,
mr. Crangle

304
00:15:57,508 --> 00:15:59,975
federal bureau
of investigation.

305
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:02,478
Our office had
a call from you...

306
00:16:02,513 --> 00:16:05,597
indeed, indeed, indeed,
i placed the call.

307
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:08,734
Please, please,
sit down.

308
00:16:08,769 --> 00:16:09,985
Now, i called
you here

309
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,236
because i felt

310
00:16:11,271 --> 00:16:12,488
that the f.b.i.
Should know.

311
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:14,356
I also notified
the police

312
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:16,859
and the... the
fire departments.

313
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:18,744
I even had a call
in to washington,

314
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:19,995
although that call

315
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:22,498
probably won't
even go through.

316
00:16:22,533 --> 00:16:23,749
It's my understanding

317
00:16:23,784 --> 00:16:26,251
that the reds are
in complete control

318
00:16:26,286 --> 00:16:27,503
in washington now.

319
00:16:27,538 --> 00:16:29,371
They've probably
taken over

320
00:16:29,406 --> 00:16:30,622
the switchboard, too.

321
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:32,875
The reds, mr. Crangle?

322
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,126
Oh, yes, the reds.

323
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:36,628
And it's a complete conspiracy,
you know.

324
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:40,382
All the evil people of the world
have banded together-

325
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:42,885
communists,
subversives, thieves-

326
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,387
it's a total,
worldwide
conspiracy.

327
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:47,890
Now, mr. Crangle,
on the phone you said

328
00:16:47,925 --> 00:16:50,392
that you had
some sort of plan...

329
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:51,643
oh, yes, yes,
yes, yes,

330
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:54,146
that'll all take
place at 4:00.

331
00:16:54,396 --> 00:16:55,647
Now, you see, mr. Hall,

332
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:58,784
i have spent many years
doing this kind of work.

333
00:16:58,819 --> 00:17:01,286
I've made
a complete study of evil.

334
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:03,789
Oh, yes, i made a study of it.

335
00:17:03,824 --> 00:17:05,040
I listen to the radio.

336
00:17:05,075 --> 00:17:06,291
I watch television.

337
00:17:06,326 --> 00:17:08,794
I cut out newspaper clippings.

338
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:12,548
I write letters to employers,
make phone calls late at night.

339
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:15,667
There's the most
efficient method, right there.

340
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:18,804
Calling these terrible
people constantly late at night,

341
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:20,055
waking them up-

342
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:23,809
waking them up, speaking
my charges and hanging up.

343
00:17:23,844 --> 00:17:26,061
Very frustrating
for them.

344
00:17:26,096 --> 00:17:27,930
Yes, i'll bet.

345
00:17:27,965 --> 00:17:29,431
Oh, yes, indeed.

346
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:31,316
You know, they go
out of their mind with fury.

347
00:17:31,351 --> 00:17:33,819
They don't like
to be woken up late at night,

348
00:17:33,854 --> 00:17:35,320
i can assure you.

349
00:17:35,355 --> 00:17:37,823
Who does, mr. Crangle?

350
00:17:37,858 --> 00:17:42,077
With these people, it's
absolutely necessary.

351
00:17:42,112 --> 00:17:45,831
But to the point, mr.
Hall, to the point.

352
00:17:45,866 --> 00:17:50,202
It is now... 3:27.

353
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:52,454
In exactly 33 minutes,

354
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:55,591
all the evil people
in the world

355
00:17:55,626 --> 00:17:57,459
will become half-

356
00:17:57,494 --> 00:18:00,596
no, a third
their present size.

357
00:18:00,631 --> 00:18:03,098
All the uncaught
murderers

358
00:18:03,133 --> 00:18:04,349
and the tyrants,

359
00:18:04,384 --> 00:18:08,720
all the bullies
and the wrongdoers-

360
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:11,223
all of them,
every one.

361
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:12,608
Nut.

362
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:20,732
Well, what do you think of it,
mr. Hall?

363
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:23,235
Mr. Crangle, how do you
go about doing this-

364
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:26,989
shrinking people?

365
00:18:27,024 --> 00:18:31,376
Why, i... i
merely will it.

366
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:33,245
That's all.

367
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,999
In the past, several other
methods had occurred to me

368
00:18:37,034 --> 00:18:40,135
to stop evil from spreading.

369
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:42,004
How does evil spread?

370
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:42,754
Hmm?

371
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:44,006
By public transport.

372
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:45,257
So i had it in mind

373
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:50,262
that i might take the stiffness
out of airplane propellers.

374
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:52,147
You understand?

375
00:18:52,182 --> 00:18:55,267
Props hanging limp...

376
00:18:55,302 --> 00:18:59,021
like empty banana skin.

377
00:18:59,056 --> 00:19:01,523
Then it occurred to me
that i might change

378
00:19:02,157 --> 00:19:05,277
all the wheels in the world
from round to square.

379
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:07,779
Or perhaps triangular.

380
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:09,031
So they'd stub in the asphalt

381
00:19:09,066 --> 00:19:10,532
and stop them.

382
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:11,783
Mr. Crangle...

383
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:15,537
this... you know, mr. Hall,
this is hard to believe.

384
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:19,291
This idea just occurred to me-
about the change in size-

385
00:19:19,326 --> 00:19:21,176
just a short
while ago.

386
00:19:21,211 --> 00:19:23,679
Some benighted woman
was in here

387
00:19:23,714 --> 00:19:27,432
and she inadvertently
gave me the idea-

388
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:31,186
turn all the evil people
into two feet tall.

389
00:19:31,221 --> 00:19:33,689
And what could be simpler?

390
00:19:33,724 --> 00:19:34,940
Think of it.

391
00:19:34,975 --> 00:19:36,441
Think of how
inefficient

392
00:19:36,476 --> 00:19:38,310
this would
make them.

393
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:41,697
Why, they couldn't handle
delicate scientific instruments,

394
00:19:41,732 --> 00:19:44,816
adding machines, typewriters
or telephone dials.

395
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:48,570
Why, soon enough, they'd
be extinct, like dinosaurs.

396
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:52,074
Nut.

397
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:58,830
Mr. Crangle...

398
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:01,333
yes?

399
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:03,835
I'd like to ask you
a question, sir.

400
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:06,338
I hope you won't
take offense at it.

401
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:08,223
Oh, no, no,
please, go on.

402
00:20:08,258 --> 00:20:10,726
Have you ever had
any psychiatric help?

403
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:13,595
What?

404
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:14,229
Psychiatric help.

405
00:20:14,846 --> 00:20:17,349
Mr. Crangle, you don't
seem rational to me.

406
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:21,103
I... i think you've developed
some kind of obsession here.

407
00:20:21,138 --> 00:20:23,605
I think you
need some help.

408
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,490
Help? I need...

409
00:20:25,525 --> 00:20:28,610
why should i need help?

410
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:30,495
I'm not evil.

411
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:31,863
I'm very sorry,
mr. Crangle,

412
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:35,000
but there isn't much
we can do about this.

413
00:20:35,035 --> 00:20:35,617
What do you mean?

414
00:20:35,652 --> 00:20:37,502
The law enforcement
agencies

415
00:20:37,537 --> 00:20:40,622
will have round-the-
clock schedules.

416
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:41,873
Don't you realize

417
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:44,376
how many evil people
you'll find?

418
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:47,512
Why, they'll be all
over the sidewalks,

419
00:20:47,547 --> 00:20:49,381
all over the streets!

420
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:52,517
You'll have to
build more jails,

421
00:20:52,552 --> 00:20:55,020
more electric
chairs, gallows.

422
00:20:57,522 --> 00:20:59,391
Well, what about
it, mr. Hall?

423
00:20:59,426 --> 00:21:01,893
What are you going
to do about it?

424
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:03,145
Nothing-
not a thing.

425
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,647
We have something
in this country

426
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:08,150
which makes all of that
quite unnecessary.

427
00:21:08,185 --> 00:21:09,401
What's that?

428
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:10,652
It's the law,
mr. Crangle,

429
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:11,903
we have the law.

430
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:13,155
We like people's help

431
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:15,657
and their support,
their cooperation,

432
00:21:15,692 --> 00:21:18,160
but interference is
quite another matter.

433
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:22,547
Oh, i get it now.

434
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:26,918
I understand.

435
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:28,804
I understand perfectly.

436
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:30,055
Why, i was an idiot

437
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:32,557
not to have realized
it sooner.

438
00:21:32,592 --> 00:21:33,809
Of course.

439
00:21:33,844 --> 00:21:35,060
Of course

440
00:21:35,095 --> 00:21:36,311
you people
have gotten

441
00:21:36,346 --> 00:21:37,562
into the f.b.i.

442
00:21:37,597 --> 00:21:38,814
Stands to reason.

443
00:21:38,849 --> 00:21:40,816
You've infiltrated
every place.

444
00:21:40,851 --> 00:21:43,318
Let me tell you
something, mr. Hall,

445
00:21:43,353 --> 00:21:45,187
let me tell
you something.

446
00:21:45,222 --> 00:21:47,072
For the next 15
or 20 minutes,

447
00:21:47,107 --> 00:21:49,574
you enjoy yourself
to the utmost,

448
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:51,443
because you'll
be two feet tall!

449
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:52,944
Two feet tall,
mr. Hall,

450
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:56,081
that's what you're
going to be!

451
00:21:56,116 --> 00:21:57,449
Two feet tall,
do you hear me?

452
00:21:57,484 --> 00:21:59,334
You and all
the rest of them-

453
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:01,203
all the evil people.

454
00:22:01,238 --> 00:22:03,088
They're going to be
two feet tall!

455
00:22:12,347 --> 00:22:13,598
Nut.

456
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:22,974
Oh, judgment day.

457
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:26,111
Judgment day is upon us.

458
00:22:27,362 --> 00:22:29,865
Won't be long now.

459
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:36,738
You... 4:00.

460
00:22:36,773 --> 00:22:38,623
You evil!

461
00:22:38,658 --> 00:22:40,492
Evil!

462
00:23:06,768 --> 00:23:09,271
It's happening,
pete.

463
00:23:09,306 --> 00:23:12,407
It's happening
right now.

464
00:23:12,442 --> 00:23:16,912
Everyone, all the evil ones-

465
00:23:16,947 --> 00:23:22,534
they're all turning
into tiny little gnomes.

466
00:23:24,786 --> 00:23:25,420
Nut.

467
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:27,289
Certainly, peter.

468
00:23:27,324 --> 00:23:29,791
This is kind
of a celebration.

469
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:41,052
Nut.

470
00:23:50,812 --> 00:23:55,817
At 4:00, an evil man made
his bed, and lay in it,

471
00:23:55,852 --> 00:23:57,702
a pot called a kettle black,

472
00:23:57,737 --> 00:24:01,456
a stone thrower broke
the windows of his glass house.

473
00:24:01,491 --> 00:24:04,576
You look for this one
under "f" for "fanatic"

474
00:24:04,611 --> 00:24:07,712
and "j" for "justice,"
in the twilight zone.

475
00:24:11,166 --> 00:24:13,385
Rod serling,
creator ofthe twilight zone,

476
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:15,887
will tell you
about next week's story

477
00:24:15,922 --> 00:24:19,491
after this message.

478
00:24:19,526 --> 00:24:20,992
And now, mr. Serling.

479
00:24:21,027 --> 00:24:23,428
As it happens to all men,

480
00:24:23,463 --> 00:24:26,565
a newcomer takes his first step
into the twilight zone next week

481
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,433
when mr. Andy devine joins us

482
00:24:28,468 --> 00:24:30,318
for a show called
"hocus-pocus and frisby."

483
00:24:30,353 --> 00:24:32,187
He plays the role
of a storekeeper

484
00:24:32,222 --> 00:24:33,438
of the cracker-barrel variety,

485
00:24:34,072 --> 00:24:36,575
who stretches the truth
like most people pull on taffy.

486
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:37,826
This one is for laughs

487
00:24:37,861 --> 00:24:39,694
and for the congenital liars
amongst you.

488
00:24:39,729 --> 00:24:44,699
Next week, mr. Andy devine-
"hocus-pocus and frisby."

489
00:25:17,115 --> 00:25:19,618
Red cross
looks to you for help.

490
00:25:19,653 --> 00:25:23,989
When you help, we can help.
