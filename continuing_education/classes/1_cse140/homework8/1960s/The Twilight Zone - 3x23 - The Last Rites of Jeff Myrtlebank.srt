1
00:00:10,777 --> 00:00:13,279
You're traveling
through another dimension-

2
00:00:13,314 --> 00:00:16,399
a dimension not only of sight
and sound, but of mind,

3
00:00:16,434 --> 00:00:18,284
a journey into a wondrous land

4
00:00:18,319 --> 00:00:20,787
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

5
00:00:20,822 --> 00:00:23,907
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

6
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:53,069
I don't see him.

7
00:00:53,104 --> 00:00:56,189
He's in the box
in front of the pulpit.

8
00:00:56,224 --> 00:00:57,574
I thought he'd
be in a coffin.

9
00:00:58,074 --> 00:00:58,691
Silly fool.

10
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:01,194
That's what the box is,
a coffin.

11
00:01:11,454 --> 00:01:12,705
Thank you, sister.

12
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:17,710
Brothers and sisters,
we are congregated

13
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:20,096
here today to pay homage

14
00:01:20,131 --> 00:01:23,850
to our dear brother,
jefferson myrtlebank.

15
00:01:25,503 --> 00:01:29,222
We all know that jeff myrtlebank
was a good boy.

16
00:01:31,142 --> 00:01:32,358
He didn't always show up

17
00:01:32,393 --> 00:01:34,227
to sunday school on sunday,

18
00:01:34,262 --> 00:01:36,112
but we never saw him
at the bootlegger's

19
00:01:36,147 --> 00:01:37,363
on saturday night, either.

20
00:01:37,398 --> 00:01:38,615
Amen.

21
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:40,483
We're all
going to miss

22
00:01:40,518 --> 00:01:41,484
this fine youth.

23
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:43,369
The good lord
must have had

24
00:01:43,404 --> 00:01:47,740
a powerful reason to want
to take him so young in life.

25
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:48,992
Hallelujah.

26
00:01:49,027 --> 00:01:50,243
But we all know

27
00:01:50,278 --> 00:01:52,745
that the lord moves
in mysterious ways

28
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,631
and today...

29
00:02:14,052 --> 00:02:14,901
he's alive.

30
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:30,033
The mid-20s.

31
00:02:30,068 --> 00:02:31,284
The midwest-

32
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:35,038
the southernmost section
of the midwest.

33
00:02:35,073 --> 00:02:36,923
We were just witnessing
a funeral,

34
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:40,677
a funeral that didn't come off
exactly as planned

35
00:02:40,712 --> 00:02:44,430
due to a slight fallout
from the twilight zone.

36
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:06,169
Who in tarnation
put me in that coffin?

37
00:03:08,805 --> 00:03:11,307
Brethren, let's not
give way to panic.

38
00:03:11,342 --> 00:03:14,427
A small mistake seems
to have been made.

39
00:03:14,462 --> 00:03:16,312
Brother siddons,
it seems

40
00:03:16,347 --> 00:03:18,181
you got a little
sense left.

41
00:03:18,216 --> 00:03:20,683
Now, what's going
on around here?

42
00:03:20,718 --> 00:03:22,569
Son, we was about
to bury you.

43
00:03:22,604 --> 00:03:23,820
Bury me?

44
00:03:23,855 --> 00:03:25,688
We was real
certain you'd died

45
00:03:26,322 --> 00:03:27,690
the day
before yesterday.

46
00:03:27,725 --> 00:03:29,576
Died?

47
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:32,946
Well, that's silly.

48
00:03:32,981 --> 00:03:34,948
Doc bolton
pronounced
you dead.

49
00:03:34,983 --> 00:03:36,199
That's right, son.

50
00:03:36,234 --> 00:03:38,701
Your heart stopped beating
two days ago.

51
00:03:38,736 --> 00:03:39,953
I was at the bedside.

52
00:03:39,988 --> 00:03:42,338
Well, i... that couldn't be.

53
00:03:42,373 --> 00:03:44,841
I'm... i'm breathing now.

54
00:03:44,876 --> 00:03:47,961
It wasn't beating
day before yesterday.

55
00:03:47,996 --> 00:03:49,212
You was sick, son,

56
00:03:49,247 --> 00:03:50,213
real sick.

57
00:03:50,248 --> 00:03:51,464
Worst case of flu

58
00:03:51,499 --> 00:03:53,349
i've ever
come across

59
00:03:53,384 --> 00:03:55,218
in my whole
medical career.

60
00:03:55,253 --> 00:03:58,605
I'm surprised he lasted
past last wednesday.

61
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,607
I hate to cast a shadow
on your medical career, doc,

62
00:04:00,642 --> 00:04:03,109
but i won't crawl back
in that coffin

63
00:04:03,144 --> 00:04:04,978
just to save face with you.

64
00:04:05,013 --> 00:04:05,862
Yes, sir.

65
00:04:05,897 --> 00:04:07,730
There was no question about it.

66
00:04:07,765 --> 00:04:08,982
There was no pulse.

67
00:04:09,017 --> 00:04:12,118
Well, i'm sure glad
you didn't embalm me.

68
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,372
How do you
feel now, son?

69
00:04:16,407 --> 00:04:18,241
Well, i feel good.

70
00:04:18,276 --> 00:04:21,995
I feel a little weak
but, uh... rested.

71
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:23,129
Hungry.

72
00:04:23,164 --> 00:04:25,632
I could eat the hide off a bear.

73
00:04:25,667 --> 00:04:26,883
I'm real hungry.

74
00:04:26,918 --> 00:04:28,134
I reckon you should be.

75
00:04:28,169 --> 00:04:30,637
I know you ain't et
for three days.

76
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:33,256
Ma!

77
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:34,891
Pa!

78
00:04:34,926 --> 00:04:36,259
Surprise!

79
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:40,763
I sure hope

80
00:04:40,798 --> 00:04:43,266
you got a good supper
on the calendar.

81
00:04:43,301 --> 00:04:44,517
What's the matter?

82
00:04:44,552 --> 00:04:45,768
You act like

83
00:04:45,803 --> 00:04:48,271
i'm some sort of
ghost or something.

84
00:04:48,306 --> 00:04:49,522
Hello, son.

85
00:04:51,908 --> 00:04:53,776
Well, i'll be double-dogged.

86
00:04:53,811 --> 00:04:56,279
My own folks
are a-scared of me.

87
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:00,283
Comfort?

88
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:06,289
I'll bet you ain't scared of me.

89
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,926
I'm the man
you're going to marry.

90
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:15,181
Well, i guess you are at that.

91
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:25,058
Liz?

92
00:05:25,093 --> 00:05:26,693
Now, you ain't a-scared
of me, are you?

93
00:05:38,454 --> 00:05:39,706
Jeff, you
fooled them,

94
00:05:39,741 --> 00:05:40,957
didn't you,
jeff?

95
00:05:40,992 --> 00:05:42,825
Yeah, honey,
i fooled them.

96
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:46,329
Son.

97
00:05:48,831 --> 00:05:50,083
Son!

98
00:05:50,118 --> 00:05:51,334
Praise be.

99
00:05:51,369 --> 00:05:53,219
We ain't lost you
after all, son.

100
00:05:53,254 --> 00:05:54,470
I know what it is.

101
00:05:54,505 --> 00:05:56,339
I know
what it is.

102
00:05:56,374 --> 00:06:00,727
The miracle that happened
here in our county.

103
00:06:00,762 --> 00:06:05,732
"Ipso suspendo animation."

104
00:06:05,767 --> 00:06:07,734
Very rare.

105
00:06:07,769 --> 00:06:11,237
There have been only 30 cases
in the past 1,500 years.

106
00:06:11,272 --> 00:06:13,606
Ain't you just
covering up

107
00:06:13,641 --> 00:06:14,490
for your
miscalculations?

108
00:06:14,525 --> 00:06:16,993
I ain't heard
of that sickness.

109
00:06:17,028 --> 00:06:18,494
Ain't likely you would-

110
00:06:18,529 --> 00:06:22,248
30 cases in 1,500 years,
all them in europe.

111
00:06:22,283 --> 00:06:24,117
You should
quit trying to slandering

112
00:06:24,152 --> 00:06:27,003
my name and take him home,
give him some soup.

113
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:28,621
He'll need
some rest.

114
00:06:28,656 --> 00:06:30,506
Well, i...
i'm a mite weak.

115
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:33,009
We'll get you
right on home.

116
00:06:33,044 --> 00:06:34,877
Just as soon
as i crank up.

117
00:06:34,912 --> 00:06:38,014
I'll fry you
a nice rabbit.

118
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:48,024
I'm sorry i acted
so funny, jeff.

119
00:06:48,059 --> 00:06:52,395
It was just that...
it was so sudden.

120
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:59,285
Sure nice
to have you back.

121
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,154
Oh, thank you
kindly,

122
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:03,039
comfort, honey,

123
00:07:03,074 --> 00:07:06,159
but i ain't never been away.

124
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:15,885
That was a larruping
good breakfast, ma.

125
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:19,005
Well, i guess i'll get
over to that east 40

126
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,889
and mend that fence.

127
00:07:19,924 --> 00:07:21,757
Oh, i wish
you wouldn't.

128
00:07:21,792 --> 00:07:23,009
It's only
been two weeks

129
00:07:23,044 --> 00:07:24,260
since you was

130
00:07:24,295 --> 00:07:26,145
at the brink
of the grave.

131
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,396
You oughtn't
to be toiling

132
00:07:27,431 --> 00:07:29,265
from sunup
to sundown.

133
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,516
I feel great, ma.

134
00:07:30,551 --> 00:07:32,401
I never felt
better in my life.

135
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:36,155
I'll see you
down there, pa.

136
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:38,024
All right.

137
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:45,531
I... i'm real concerned.

138
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:47,416
I... i just don't like

139
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:51,787
the way he's behaved
the last two weeks.

140
00:07:51,822 --> 00:07:53,673
What do you mean?

141
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:56,792
He's different,
not like he was at all.

142
00:07:57,426 --> 00:08:00,046
Seems the same to me.

143
00:08:00,081 --> 00:08:01,681
He only et
two eggs again.

144
00:08:01,716 --> 00:08:04,183
Why, ever since
he's sprouted teeth

145
00:08:04,218 --> 00:08:06,052
he's been having
three eggs

146
00:08:06,087 --> 00:08:07,937
at breakfast.

147
00:08:07,972 --> 00:08:10,439
Well, a man's
taste can change.

148
00:08:10,474 --> 00:08:13,559
And he goes around
fiddling with things

149
00:08:13,594 --> 00:08:14,810
night and day.

150
00:08:14,845 --> 00:08:17,313
And the way he goes
at that hard work.

151
00:08:17,348 --> 00:08:21,067
Why, he was never that
friendly with work before.

152
00:08:21,102 --> 00:08:23,069
Yes, sir, that's
true at that.

153
00:08:23,104 --> 00:08:24,954
I recollect
worrying many times

154
00:08:24,989 --> 00:08:26,822
that he leaned
just a shade

155
00:08:26,857 --> 00:08:28,708
towards the side
of shiftlessness.

156
00:08:28,743 --> 00:08:31,077
Not lazy, exactly, but...

157
00:08:31,112 --> 00:08:32,328
no.

158
00:08:32,363 --> 00:08:33,829
No, just uninterested.

159
00:08:33,864 --> 00:08:35,081
And since his sickness,

160
00:08:35,116 --> 00:08:37,583
he's been fighting
in that work

161
00:08:37,618 --> 00:08:39,468
just like he was
a year behind.

162
00:08:39,503 --> 00:08:41,337
No, it ain't like
him at that.

163
00:08:41,372 --> 00:08:43,089
All right, big ears,

164
00:08:43,124 --> 00:08:44,974
you run down
to the mailbox

165
00:08:45,009 --> 00:08:46,842
and wait
for the mailman.

166
00:08:46,877 --> 00:08:48,728
I'm expecting
a new catalog.

167
00:08:48,763 --> 00:08:49,979
Sure hope it gets here.

168
00:08:50,014 --> 00:08:51,847
You've about wore that out.

169
00:08:52,982 --> 00:08:54,850
Make way for the queen!

170
00:09:05,494 --> 00:09:07,363
He ain't been
here yet.

171
00:09:07,398 --> 00:09:09,615
Can i shoot?

172
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:11,250
Sure.

173
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:14,370
Here's your ammunition.

174
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:19,008
I ain't afraid of frogs.

175
00:09:19,043 --> 00:09:21,510
It's just that they're dirty.

176
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:24,013
How's your brother?

177
00:09:24,048 --> 00:09:25,264
All right, i reckon.

178
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:27,767
Only ma and pa
are a little bit concerned

179
00:09:28,384 --> 00:09:30,269
the way he's been
behaving lately.

180
00:09:30,304 --> 00:09:31,887
How's he been acting?

181
00:09:31,922 --> 00:09:35,024
I don't know, just... different.

182
00:09:35,059 --> 00:09:38,144
He eats different,
works different,

183
00:09:38,179 --> 00:09:40,396
always fiddling
with things.

184
00:09:40,431 --> 00:09:43,149
Besides, it ain't
none of your business.

185
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:47,653
He loves me not,

186
00:09:47,688 --> 00:09:48,904
he loves me...

187
00:09:48,939 --> 00:09:50,790
is that a fact?

188
00:09:51,407 --> 00:09:53,909
Well, i was wondering
if you'd heard anything.

189
00:09:53,944 --> 00:09:57,046
Well, as a matter of fact,
i have heard a little something.

190
00:09:57,081 --> 00:09:58,914
I...

191
00:09:58,949 --> 00:10:00,166
just a minute.

192
00:10:00,201 --> 00:10:00,800
You run out and play.

193
00:10:00,835 --> 00:10:03,302
Why? I want to listen.

194
00:10:03,337 --> 00:10:05,171
Go on now. Scoot.

195
00:10:05,206 --> 00:10:06,422
Aw, shuckin'.

196
00:10:06,457 --> 00:10:09,558
You want to hold a mouthful
of black pepper for ten minutes?

197
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:17,683
Little pitchers have big ears.

198
00:10:17,718 --> 00:10:19,568
Well, now, i know for a fact

199
00:10:19,603 --> 00:10:22,688
that those poor folks
are scared to death.

200
00:10:22,723 --> 00:10:25,191
Why, he's been acting
like a complete strangers

201
00:10:25,226 --> 00:10:27,076
ever since the funeral.

202
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:30,579
Yes, sir, i mean,

203
00:10:30,614 --> 00:10:33,082
i sure wouldn't
want to go sleep

204
00:10:33,117 --> 00:10:34,950
in a house
with that boy around.

205
00:10:34,985 --> 00:10:36,836
Not me.

206
00:10:36,871 --> 00:10:40,589
They say he's started fiddling
with things now, like axes.

207
00:10:40,624 --> 00:10:41,841
I don't know.

208
00:10:41,876 --> 00:10:44,343
He was always
such a good boy.

209
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:47,847
Gents.

210
00:10:47,882 --> 00:10:49,715
What do you say, doc?

211
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:53,469
We was just discussing
that myrtlebank boy.

212
00:10:53,504 --> 00:10:54,970
Yeah, what
about him?

213
00:10:55,005 --> 00:10:56,222
Just wondering
about him.

214
00:10:56,257 --> 00:10:57,473
I guess you've heard

215
00:10:58,107 --> 00:10:59,975
how peculiar
he's acted lately.

216
00:11:00,609 --> 00:11:01,861
Yeah, i heard.

217
00:11:01,896 --> 00:11:03,729
I ain't one to
pass on gossip.

218
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:06,365
Still, you gotta wonder.

219
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,234
Where was he them 48 hours

220
00:11:08,269 --> 00:11:10,119
he was supposed
to be dead?

221
00:11:10,154 --> 00:11:11,370
Had to be
somewheres.

222
00:11:11,405 --> 00:11:13,239
If he was dead.

223
00:11:13,274 --> 00:11:15,124
Doc says he had
that rare sickness.

224
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:16,992
Maybe i told
a white lie, strauss.

225
00:11:17,027 --> 00:11:20,129
Maybe i was thinking
of his folks' feelings

226
00:11:20,164 --> 00:11:21,997
when i brought up that disease.

227
00:11:22,032 --> 00:11:23,883
Can you straighten that out?

228
00:11:23,918 --> 00:11:28,254
I'm not the kind to bury a body
unless i'm positive he's dead.

229
00:11:28,289 --> 00:11:30,139
You know me better than that.

230
00:11:30,174 --> 00:11:32,258
Shoot, yes,
we know you, doc.

231
00:11:36,145 --> 00:11:38,647
I did more
than feel that boy's pulse.

232
00:11:38,682 --> 00:11:41,016
When his folks
left the room,

233
00:11:41,051 --> 00:11:42,902
i gave him
the pin test.

234
00:11:44,153 --> 00:11:46,655
I stabbed him
with a pin.

235
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:49,158
He didn't
even flicker.

236
00:11:51,026 --> 00:11:52,528
I held a mirror to his lips.

237
00:11:52,563 --> 00:11:55,664
If there was any life left
in the man at all,

238
00:11:55,699 --> 00:11:57,533
his breath would fog up
the mirror.

239
00:11:57,568 --> 00:11:59,418
Well, what happened?

240
00:11:59,453 --> 00:12:01,921
I pronounced him dead, didn't i?

241
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:05,424
Then where could
he have been

242
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:06,675
for them
48 hours?

243
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:07,927
Why don't we say it?

244
00:12:07,962 --> 00:12:09,795
We're all a-thinking it.

245
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,680
You say it, peters.

246
00:12:13,549 --> 00:12:14,800
You're daggum right i'll say it.

247
00:12:14,835 --> 00:12:16,051
How do we know
the man who got up

248
00:12:16,685 --> 00:12:17,937
and crawled
out of that coffin

249
00:12:17,972 --> 00:12:19,188
is really
jeff myrtlebank?

250
00:12:19,223 --> 00:12:21,690
I wouldn't talk
like that, gentlemen.

251
00:12:21,725 --> 00:12:23,559
It could cause
a lot of trouble.

252
00:12:23,594 --> 00:12:24,810
Well, i don't know.

253
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:27,313
My grandma,
she used to tell me

254
00:12:27,348 --> 00:12:30,449
about evil spirits
roaming around the world

255
00:12:30,484 --> 00:12:32,318
trying to find a body
to take over.

256
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:35,454
She said that they'd
steal a corpse sometimes

257
00:12:35,489 --> 00:12:37,323
before a man
was good dead.

258
00:12:37,358 --> 00:12:39,825
That kind of talk's
dangerous, peters.

259
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,962
Although i must confess this
throws a lot of dry kindling

260
00:12:42,997 --> 00:12:45,464
on the fire that's been
smoldering in my brain

261
00:12:45,499 --> 00:12:46,715
ever since the funeral.

262
00:12:51,086 --> 00:12:53,589
Have a good day, gents.

263
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:15,578
It's him.

264
00:13:17,615 --> 00:13:21,951
Dagnabit, comfort,
now's the time to tell him.

265
00:13:21,986 --> 00:13:23,202
Right now.

266
00:13:23,237 --> 00:13:24,453
No.

267
00:13:24,488 --> 00:13:25,704
I don't tell you who to see.

268
00:13:25,739 --> 00:13:27,590
And you leave me alone.

269
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:30,092
Well, maybe
orgram's right, dear.

270
00:13:30,127 --> 00:13:32,845
You know what everyone in the
county is saying about him.

271
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,213
Well,
he's not visiting the county-

272
00:13:34,248 --> 00:13:35,464
he's visiting me.

273
00:13:35,499 --> 00:13:37,466
Well, you're just plain

274
00:13:37,501 --> 00:13:38,217
rotten stubborn.

275
00:13:38,252 --> 00:13:40,719
I bet all your kids
are born with horns.

276
00:13:40,754 --> 00:13:41,971
Orgram!

277
00:13:42,006 --> 00:13:44,356
You two just get on
into the kitchen

278
00:13:44,391 --> 00:13:46,225
and let me
entertain my guest.

279
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:58,871
Well, bless my soul!

280
00:13:58,906 --> 00:14:00,122
Comfort...

281
00:14:00,157 --> 00:14:01,373
look at who's here.

282
00:14:03,911 --> 00:14:05,127
Well, come on
in this house.

283
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:11,250
And how's your
ma and orgram?

284
00:14:11,285 --> 00:14:11,884
Just fine.

285
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:13,135
How's your folks?

286
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:14,386
Just fine,
except ma.

287
00:14:14,421 --> 00:14:15,638
She'll be
madder

288
00:14:15,673 --> 00:14:17,506
than a hornet
tomorrow.

289
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:18,140
Mad?

290
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:19,391
You see, i...

291
00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:21,894
i robbed her
pet rose vine

292
00:14:21,929 --> 00:14:24,396
just so i could
bring you a bouquet.

293
00:14:25,648 --> 00:14:27,516
Oh, you oughtn't
have done that.

294
00:14:27,551 --> 00:14:29,401
Oh, it's not much.

295
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:33,772
They're dead,
aren't they?

296
00:14:33,807 --> 00:14:35,024
I guess tame roses-

297
00:14:35,059 --> 00:14:36,909
they don't
last very long.

298
00:14:36,944 --> 00:14:38,777
When did you pick them?

299
00:14:38,812 --> 00:14:40,029
Oh, i picked them

300
00:14:40,064 --> 00:14:42,531
just before
i came over here.

301
00:14:42,566 --> 00:14:44,033
Oh, well.

302
00:14:47,169 --> 00:14:50,289
Why... why don't
we have some music?

303
00:14:50,324 --> 00:14:51,540
Yeah, i'd like that.

304
00:14:51,575 --> 00:14:55,294
We just bought a new
country blues last week.

305
00:14:55,329 --> 00:14:57,796
Yeah, i see you did.

306
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:01,550
Don't touch me.

307
00:15:01,585 --> 00:15:02,801
What's the matter
with you?

308
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:06,305
I'm sorry.

309
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:08,190
Just the way them flowers died.

310
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:12,311
Maybe you've got poison
on your hands.

311
00:15:12,346 --> 00:15:14,697
I ain't got no poison
on my hands.

312
00:15:14,732 --> 00:15:17,566
That's not what's
bothering you.

313
00:15:17,601 --> 00:15:19,568
Everywhere i go
it's just the same.

314
00:15:19,603 --> 00:15:22,705
I expect it from the others
but not from you.

315
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:23,956
I'm getting sick and tired

316
00:15:23,991 --> 00:15:27,076
of everybody treating me
like a vampire.

317
00:15:27,111 --> 00:15:28,460
Oh, jeff.

318
00:15:28,495 --> 00:15:31,080
Now, you tell me.

319
00:15:31,115 --> 00:15:32,965
Are you my girl or not?

320
00:16:06,115 --> 00:16:08,500
Well, land's
sakes, child,

321
00:16:08,535 --> 00:16:11,003
you're scared
half to death.

322
00:16:11,038 --> 00:16:12,254
What'd he do?

323
00:16:12,289 --> 00:16:14,123
Nothing.

324
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:16,625
It's time to put
a stop to this.

325
00:16:17,259 --> 00:16:19,128
After all, i'm the
man of the family.

326
00:16:19,163 --> 00:16:20,379
He didn't do
nothing wrong.

327
00:16:20,414 --> 00:16:21,630
I ain't liked him

328
00:16:21,665 --> 00:16:24,133
since we were both
three years old.

329
00:16:24,168 --> 00:16:24,767
Unhand me.

330
00:16:24,802 --> 00:16:26,635
Orgram,
you be careful.

331
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:38,647
Jeff?

332
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:41,784
Now, what
do you want?

333
00:16:41,819 --> 00:16:44,903
I don't want you hanging
around here anymore.

334
00:16:44,938 --> 00:16:47,406
Now, let me give you
some advice, orgram.

335
00:16:47,441 --> 00:16:48,540
I'm mad right now.

336
00:16:48,575 --> 00:16:51,043
I ain't mad at
you in particular,

337
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:53,545
but it'd be a shame
if you got in my way

338
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,414
and i had to take
it out on you.

339
00:16:55,449 --> 00:16:57,299
You threatening me?

340
00:16:57,334 --> 00:16:57,916
Huh.

341
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,419
You forget who i am.

342
00:17:00,454 --> 00:17:03,055
If i had a dime
for every time i whopped you,

343
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:04,923
i'd have a hundred dollars.

344
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:07,176
That's right...

345
00:17:07,211 --> 00:17:09,678
but you ain't whupped me lately.

346
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:13,932
Now, you get out of my way.

347
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:18,570
Make me.

348
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:53,722
Oh, my baby.

349
00:17:53,757 --> 00:17:55,607
My poor little baby.

350
00:17:55,642 --> 00:17:57,726
Get out the wagon
and the team.

351
00:17:57,761 --> 00:17:58,360
He broke my jaw.

352
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:00,229
Oh, we'll get you

353
00:18:00,264 --> 00:18:01,363
right into
doc bolton.

354
00:18:01,398 --> 00:18:02,614
Poor jeff.

355
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:05,367
He hasn't got anybody.

356
00:18:05,402 --> 00:18:07,236
Poor jeff?!

357
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:13,492
Orgram, your
jaw ain't broke

358
00:18:13,527 --> 00:18:15,994
or wouldn't be trying
to talk so much.

359
00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:18,497
You ought to do something
about that dandruff.

360
00:18:18,532 --> 00:18:20,382
I tell ya, i'm convinced.

361
00:18:20,417 --> 00:18:24,136
How long i been whupping jeff
in a bareknuckle fight?

362
00:18:24,171 --> 00:18:26,638
As far back as i can recollect.

363
00:18:26,673 --> 00:18:28,891
I used to chase him home
from school every day

364
00:18:28,926 --> 00:18:30,142
like it was
one of my regular chores.

365
00:18:30,177 --> 00:18:32,010
He never was
no match for you, orgram.

366
00:18:32,045 --> 00:18:34,513
How come
he bested you tonight?

367
00:18:34,548 --> 00:18:37,900
'Cause it weren't
jeff myrtlebank i was fighting.

368
00:18:37,935 --> 00:18:41,153
Whoever it was,
he had ring training.

369
00:18:41,188 --> 00:18:43,655
He hitting a different way

370
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:46,024
that we do around here.

371
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:51,029
That man is dangerous enough
to kill with his bare hands.

372
00:18:51,064 --> 00:18:53,532
That's exactly what i'm
afraid of, gentlemen.

373
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,166
We seem to be living

374
00:18:54,201 --> 00:18:56,034
with something
evil in our midst,

375
00:18:56,069 --> 00:18:57,920
and we got to
put a stop to it.

376
00:18:57,955 --> 00:18:59,788
We've all discussed
what we're going to do,

377
00:18:59,823 --> 00:19:01,673
and i for one
can't see any reason

378
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:04,176
for putting it off any longer.

379
00:19:04,211 --> 00:19:06,044
You through talking now?

380
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:08,547
Let me have another
look in there.

381
00:19:33,822 --> 00:19:35,073
I rode out to warn you:

382
00:19:35,108 --> 00:19:37,576
There's a group of men
coming out from town-

383
00:19:37,611 --> 00:19:40,078
they're going to ask you
to move out of the country.

384
00:19:40,113 --> 00:19:44,082
Well, now, how do you
feel about that, comfort?

385
00:19:44,117 --> 00:19:46,084
Well, i'm a
fickle woman, jeff.

386
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:47,970
I'm the kind
who believes

387
00:19:48,005 --> 00:19:50,472
whatever is said
by them i'm with.

388
00:19:50,507 --> 00:19:52,975
I've heard some bad
things said about you

389
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:55,477
and sometimes i
ain't strong enough

390
00:19:55,512 --> 00:19:57,346
to turn a deef ear to them,

391
00:19:57,381 --> 00:20:01,099
but in my heart,
i reckon i love you

392
00:20:01,134 --> 00:20:04,853
or else i wouldn't be here
with you now.

393
00:20:05,487 --> 00:20:09,241
I got a great love
for you, comfort,

394
00:20:09,276 --> 00:20:11,109
and i want you to marry me.

395
00:20:18,367 --> 00:20:20,369
I reckon you better give me
your answer right now.

396
00:20:33,882 --> 00:20:35,133
Gents.

397
00:20:35,168 --> 00:20:36,385
What do you say?

398
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:38,270
Jeff, we are here
as a committee

399
00:20:38,305 --> 00:20:40,138
to speak
for the community.

400
00:20:40,173 --> 00:20:41,390
We talked
this over

401
00:20:41,425 --> 00:20:43,275
and we came to
the conclusion

402
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:45,644
that jeff myrtlebank is dead.

403
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,396
We think you're a hant.

404
00:20:47,431 --> 00:20:48,397
That's right, a hant.

405
00:20:48,432 --> 00:20:50,649
We don't know who you are
or where you come from.

406
00:20:50,684 --> 00:20:52,651
We figure
you stole jeff's body.

407
00:20:52,686 --> 00:20:54,536
We don't even like you
as a neighbor.

408
00:20:54,571 --> 00:20:56,405
We're asking you
to move out.

409
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,656
Move out, you hear?

410
00:20:57,691 --> 00:21:01,410
What do you say, jeff?

411
00:21:01,445 --> 00:21:03,912
Well, i think that depends
on miss comfort gatewood.

412
00:21:03,947 --> 00:21:08,300
I just asked her a question
and she ain't answered it yet.

413
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,822
I reckon i'm with you no
matter where we have to go.

414
00:21:30,857 --> 00:21:34,443
You stand behind me, then.

415
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:38,580
Gents, my wife-to-be and me,

416
00:21:38,615 --> 00:21:41,700
now, we was born
and raised in this county.

417
00:21:41,735 --> 00:21:42,951
We like it.

418
00:21:42,986 --> 00:21:45,454
We don't aim to raise our kids
anyplace else.

419
00:21:45,489 --> 00:21:46,088
Now, you...

420
00:21:46,123 --> 00:21:47,339
wait a minute!

421
00:21:47,374 --> 00:21:48,590
I heard you out.

422
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:49,841
Let him speak.

423
00:21:49,876 --> 00:21:54,463
We're going to stay,
and that means just two things:

424
00:21:54,498 --> 00:21:56,348
One, if you're wrong about me,

425
00:21:56,383 --> 00:21:59,468
then you ain't got nothing
to worry about

426
00:21:59,503 --> 00:22:00,719
because that means

427
00:22:00,754 --> 00:22:02,604
i'm just a poor
ol' country boy

428
00:22:02,639 --> 00:22:05,223
by the name of jeff myrtlebank.

429
00:22:05,258 --> 00:22:08,360
But on the other hand,
if you're right about me,

430
00:22:08,395 --> 00:22:11,480
then you better start
treating me pretty nice

431
00:22:11,515 --> 00:22:12,731
because you just

432
00:22:12,766 --> 00:22:14,616
don't know all
the trouble

433
00:22:14,651 --> 00:22:15,867
i can cause you.

434
00:22:15,902 --> 00:22:17,736
I might wave my right hand

435
00:22:17,771 --> 00:22:20,238
and bring a whole grove
of locusts down on your crops.

436
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:24,876
Then i might wave my left hand
and dry up all your wells.

437
00:22:24,911 --> 00:22:27,496
Then i might snap my fingers

438
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:29,381
and burn a barn or two.

439
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:30,499
And then some morning

440
00:22:30,534 --> 00:22:33,635
if i get up
and i feel exceptionally ornery,

441
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:36,755
i might have the hawks come down
and steal your chickens.

442
00:22:38,006 --> 00:22:39,891
Yes, sir.

443
00:22:39,926 --> 00:22:43,512
You folks better start
treating me and mine real nice.

444
00:22:43,547 --> 00:22:45,013
That's a different picture

445
00:22:45,048 --> 00:22:46,898
with you aiming
to marry comfort.

446
00:22:46,933 --> 00:22:48,767
We ain't wanting
to hurt her none.

447
00:22:48,802 --> 00:22:51,269
Yes, sir, it'd sure
be wrong to hurt her

448
00:22:51,304 --> 00:22:53,155
trying to get
at somebody else.

449
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:55,657
When are you fixing
on marrying her, jeff?

450
00:22:58,026 --> 00:22:59,277
Right away, i reckon.

451
00:22:59,312 --> 00:23:01,163
Let us know
about it, boy.

452
00:23:01,198 --> 00:23:02,414
We'll picnic that day.

453
00:23:02,449 --> 00:23:03,665
Well, come on, gents.

454
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:06,785
They got a lot
of talking to do.

455
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:25,437
You couldn't really do
all that, could you?

456
00:23:25,472 --> 00:23:26,688
Of course not.

457
00:23:26,723 --> 00:23:27,939
I hate lying to them,

458
00:23:27,974 --> 00:23:31,059
but i find
that when something comes up

459
00:23:31,094 --> 00:23:32,944
you've got to cope with it.

460
00:23:32,979 --> 00:23:34,196
How'd you do that?

461
00:23:34,231 --> 00:23:35,447
Do what?

462
00:23:35,482 --> 00:23:37,315
Light that match?

463
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,818
You didn't strike
it on anything.

464
00:23:39,853 --> 00:23:41,069
It just lit.

465
00:23:41,104 --> 00:23:44,823
Comfort, honey, first
thing you've got to learn

466
00:23:44,858 --> 00:23:47,325
is not to imagine things.

467
00:23:54,216 --> 00:23:56,718
Jeff and comfort
are still alive today

468
00:23:56,753 --> 00:23:59,838
and their only son
is a united states senator.

469
00:23:59,873 --> 00:24:03,592
He's noted as an
uncommonly shrewd politician,

470
00:24:03,627 --> 00:24:06,728
and some believe he must
have gotten his education

471
00:24:06,763 --> 00:24:09,848
in the twilight zone.

472
00:24:43,515 --> 00:24:45,383
Mental illness
is no longer hopeless.

473
00:24:45,418 --> 00:24:47,269
Many are now being saved.

474
00:24:47,304 --> 00:24:48,520
Help fight mental illness.

475
00:24:48,555 --> 00:24:51,022
Support
your mental health association.
