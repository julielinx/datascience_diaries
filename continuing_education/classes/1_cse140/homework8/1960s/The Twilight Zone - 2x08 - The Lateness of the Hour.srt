1
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,513
You're traveling
through another dimension-

2
00:00:13,548 --> 00:00:16,516
a dimension not only of sight
and sound, but of mind.

3
00:00:16,551 --> 00:00:18,018
A journey into a wondrous land

4
00:00:18,053 --> 00:00:20,420
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

5
00:00:20,455 --> 00:00:21,921
That's the signpost up ahead.

6
00:00:21,956 --> 00:00:23,923
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

7
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:02,162
When was that
picture taken?

8
00:01:02,197 --> 00:01:05,665
Why, i don't think
i remember, my dear.

9
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,168
You're looking at
that album again?

10
00:01:08,203 --> 00:01:10,670
It seems like that's
all you do lately

11
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:12,672
is look
at that album.

12
00:01:12,707 --> 00:01:14,674
When was that picture taken?

13
00:01:14,709 --> 00:01:17,177
Oh, it's a lovely picture of you, nelda.

14
00:01:17,212 --> 00:01:18,678
Thank you, ma'am.

15
00:01:18,713 --> 00:01:21,181
Let's see. That
was taken the summer

16
00:01:21,216 --> 00:01:23,683
after dr. Loren retired
from the laboratory.

17
00:01:23,718 --> 00:01:26,186
You're holding those
lovely yellow roses

18
00:01:26,221 --> 00:01:27,687
that jensen
planted for us.

19
00:01:27,722 --> 00:01:29,689
You don't look
any different now

20
00:01:29,724 --> 00:01:31,191
than you did then.

21
00:01:31,226 --> 00:01:32,992
That's kind of you,
miss jana.

22
00:01:36,431 --> 00:01:40,400
Jana, nelda will put
that away for you.

23
00:01:40,435 --> 00:01:42,402
That's all right,
father.

24
00:01:42,437 --> 00:01:44,404
I'd like to put
it away myself.

25
00:01:57,417 --> 00:01:59,919
You're not chilly,
are you, jana, dear?

26
00:01:59,954 --> 00:02:01,421
Shouldn't be.

27
00:02:01,456 --> 00:02:04,424
72 degrees
in here.

28
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:07,927
Isn't it,
william?

29
00:02:07,962 --> 00:02:09,429
Isn't it
72 degrees?

30
00:02:09,464 --> 00:02:13,933
Exactly. The
optimum temperature.

31
00:02:13,968 --> 00:02:17,737
Of course.
The optimum temperature.

32
00:02:17,772 --> 00:02:23,243
And the fireplace- designed
for perfect heat radiation.

33
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:28,248
The chairs, for
maximum comfort.

34
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,751
And the windows

35
00:02:31,786 --> 00:02:36,256
for the most efficient light,
and proper ventilation.

36
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:38,758
Oh, yes, and the ceilings

37
00:02:38,793 --> 00:02:42,262
for the most desirable
acoustical qualities.

38
00:02:42,297 --> 00:02:44,764
Everything built to
perfection, father.

39
00:02:44,799 --> 00:02:46,266
Everything designed

40
00:02:46,301 --> 00:02:48,768
for a perfect life.

41
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:54,274
Oh, please
continue, nelda.

42
00:02:54,309 --> 00:02:55,275
That's it.

43
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:09,789
Haven't you had enough
of that, mother?

44
00:03:09,824 --> 00:03:11,291
Why, jana, dear

45
00:03:11,326 --> 00:03:14,294
you know it helps
my appetite.

46
00:03:14,329 --> 00:03:16,296
Almost 6:00.

47
00:03:16,331 --> 00:03:18,298
Nearly time
for dinner.

48
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:21,801
Why don't we eat a little
bit earlier tonight?

49
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:23,803
Or a little bit later?

50
00:03:23,838 --> 00:03:26,306
Why don't we go out
to a restaurant?

51
00:03:26,341 --> 00:03:27,307
A restaurant?

52
00:03:27,342 --> 00:03:28,808
Why, jana, my dear,

53
00:03:28,843 --> 00:03:31,811
why in the world would
we go out to eat

54
00:03:31,846 --> 00:03:33,313
in a restaurant?

55
00:03:33,348 --> 00:03:34,814
I don't know.

56
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:38,818
It's just that it
would be different.

57
00:03:38,853 --> 00:03:40,820
Yes, it would
be different.

58
00:03:40,855 --> 00:03:42,322
We'd walk
through the rain

59
00:03:42,357 --> 00:03:44,324
and get ourselves
sopping wet.

60
00:03:44,359 --> 00:03:46,826
Then we'd eat some greasy, unpalatable food

61
00:03:46,861 --> 00:03:48,828
served off of dirty,
unwashed plates

62
00:03:48,863 --> 00:03:51,831
and after that it would
be a moot question

63
00:03:51,866 --> 00:03:54,834
whether we'd succumb
to ptomaine or pneumonia.

64
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:59,239
Will that be
all, ma'am?

65
00:03:59,274 --> 00:04:01,741
Oh, just a little
bit longer, nelda.

66
00:04:01,776 --> 00:04:04,244
Don't make her
do that anymore!

67
00:04:04,279 --> 00:04:07,647
What is the matter with you?

68
00:04:07,682 --> 00:04:11,150
It's just that outside there must be

69
00:04:11,185 --> 00:04:14,654
the clean, beautiful
sound of rain.

70
00:04:14,689 --> 00:04:16,155
And in here

71
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:19,659
those constant animal grunts of pleasure.

72
00:04:19,694 --> 00:04:21,160
Jana!

73
00:04:21,195 --> 00:04:23,162
Yell at me, father.

74
00:04:23,197 --> 00:04:24,664
Please yell at me.

75
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:28,468
I can't tell you how delighted
i am to hear you yell at me.

76
00:04:28,503 --> 00:04:30,470
It proves that you've got lungs.

77
00:04:30,505 --> 00:04:33,973
Lungs and a mind and
a mouth and a voice.

78
00:04:34,008 --> 00:04:37,477
Oh, father, we're
atrophying in here.

79
00:04:37,512 --> 00:04:39,979
We sit here day after day

80
00:04:40,014 --> 00:04:41,481
and year
after year

81
00:04:41,516 --> 00:04:43,483
while that clock
turns and turns.

82
00:04:43,518 --> 00:04:44,984
And we decay with every minute

83
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:47,987
while nelda the maid
and robert the butler

84
00:04:48,022 --> 00:04:50,990
and gretchen the cook
and jensen the handyman...

85
00:04:51,025 --> 00:04:52,292
jana!

86
00:04:52,327 --> 00:04:54,794
While these domestics do everything

87
00:04:54,829 --> 00:04:56,796
but our
breathing for us.

88
00:04:56,831 --> 00:04:59,299
Nelda, will you
leave us, please?

89
00:04:59,334 --> 00:05:00,800
Yes, sir.

90
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,304
Nelda!

91
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,811
I'm speaking
to you, nelda.

92
00:05:11,846 --> 00:05:13,313
Yes, miss jana?

93
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:16,816
Don't you agree
with me, nelda?

94
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:24,324
You were saying,
miss jana?

95
00:05:24,359 --> 00:05:26,826
I was about
to say that...

96
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:33,032
i was about to make
mention of the fact...

97
00:05:33,067 --> 00:05:36,035
please don't stop
on my account, jana.

98
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,037
We have no
secrets here.

99
00:05:38,072 --> 00:05:39,539
Don't we?

100
00:05:39,574 --> 00:05:43,042
No secrets. Is
that it, father?

101
00:05:43,077 --> 00:05:44,544
Why, that's all we
do have- secrets.

102
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:46,045
That's how
we live-

103
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,547
by shutting
off the world,

104
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:49,549
turning our
backs on it,

105
00:05:49,584 --> 00:05:53,553
while you soundless, fleshless
things glide around here

106
00:05:53,588 --> 00:05:56,556
and, with your efficient
ministrations,

107
00:05:56,591 --> 00:05:59,559
turn my father and
my mother into jelly.

108
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,162
If i may say so,
miss jana,

109
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:04,664
you sound jealous.

110
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:23,182
You said yourself, jana,

111
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:26,185
that i designed and
built to perfection,

112
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,188
and i made these people
quite indestructible.

113
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:31,190
It's like living with ghosts.

114
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:33,092
Oh, no, my dear. Not ghosts.

115
00:06:33,127 --> 00:06:36,095
Ghosts are those
who have died after living,

116
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:38,097
but these people had no life

117
00:06:38,132 --> 00:06:42,201
until i gave
it to them.

118
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,210
The residence
of dr. William loren,

119
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:53,713
which is, in reality,
a menagerie for machines.

120
00:06:53,748 --> 00:06:55,715
We're about to discover

121
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,718
that sometimes the product
of man's talent and genius

122
00:06:58,753 --> 00:07:02,722
can walk amongst us untouched
by the normal ravages of time.

123
00:07:02,757 --> 00:07:04,724
These are dr. Loren's robots,

124
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:07,226
built to function
as well as artistic perfection.

125
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:10,730
But, in a moment, dr. William
loren, wife and daughter

126
00:07:10,765 --> 00:07:13,232
will discover that
perfection is relative-

127
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:15,735
that even robots
have to be paid for-

128
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:19,238
and very shortly will be shown
exactly what is the bill.

129
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:24,243
Tonight, florient unscented,

130
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:26,245
the new kind of room deodorant

131
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,749
that kills bad odors
yet leaves no fragrance,

132
00:07:29,784 --> 00:07:31,250
brings you...

133
00:07:57,076 --> 00:08:02,081
ah. I believe i'll take
the meerschaum tonight, robert.

134
00:08:02,116 --> 00:08:04,083
I'll prepare it, sir.

135
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:19,599
Will there be
anything else, dr. Loren?

136
00:08:19,634 --> 00:08:21,601
I think not tonight,
robert.

137
00:08:21,636 --> 00:08:23,102
Good night, sir.

138
00:08:23,137 --> 00:08:24,604
Good night, robert.

139
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:31,110
Oh, uh... robert?

140
00:08:31,145 --> 00:08:32,612
There's no need.

141
00:08:32,647 --> 00:08:35,114
I'll light your pipe
tonight, father.

142
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:48,127
Well, jana, shall
we talk of it now?

143
00:08:48,162 --> 00:08:50,129
Shall we talk
of what?

144
00:08:50,164 --> 00:08:52,131
Why, i think
that's quite obvious.

145
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:53,633
Suddenly, inexplicably,

146
00:08:53,668 --> 00:08:56,135
your mother and i find
you're unhappy.

147
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:57,136
You're rebellious.

148
00:08:57,171 --> 00:09:00,139
Do you think that
pleases us, jana?

149
00:09:00,174 --> 00:09:01,641
I don't know.

150
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:06,646
I explained to you
a long time ago

151
00:09:06,681 --> 00:09:08,648
why i did what i did-

152
00:09:08,683 --> 00:09:10,650
why i retired
from the world,

153
00:09:10,685 --> 00:09:12,652
and why i built
these people.

154
00:09:14,689 --> 00:09:17,156
What you've done
to yourselves

155
00:09:17,191 --> 00:09:18,958
is an atrocity.

156
00:09:18,993 --> 00:09:21,961
But what you've done
to me is worse.

157
00:09:21,996 --> 00:09:24,463
You've turned me into a freak-

158
00:09:24,498 --> 00:09:27,967
an unsocial, unworldly,
insulated freak.

159
00:09:28,002 --> 00:09:29,468
Shall i tell you

160
00:09:29,503 --> 00:09:30,970
what else i've
done for you, jana?

161
00:09:31,005 --> 00:09:32,471
I've kept you from harm.

162
00:09:32,506 --> 00:09:33,973
I've protected you
against disease.

163
00:09:34,008 --> 00:09:36,976
And insulation in this
20th century is no crime.

164
00:09:37,011 --> 00:09:38,477
It's a service.

165
00:09:38,512 --> 00:09:41,480
You've never had to look
into the face of war

166
00:09:41,515 --> 00:09:43,983
or the face of poverty
or prejudice.

167
00:09:44,018 --> 00:09:45,985
Well, you've
been isolated, yes,

168
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,487
but what you think
of as imprisonment

169
00:09:48,522 --> 00:09:52,491
just happens to be asylum and
security, yes, and survival.

170
00:09:52,526 --> 00:09:55,094
Asylum in
a hothouse?

171
00:09:55,129 --> 00:09:58,097
Security in
a mausoleum?

172
00:09:58,132 --> 00:10:00,099
Survival as a vegetable survives.

173
00:10:00,134 --> 00:10:01,601
What you're becoming,

174
00:10:01,636 --> 00:10:03,603
and what you're
making me become...

175
00:10:03,638 --> 00:10:05,605
a vegetable.

176
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,611
Thank you.

177
00:10:11,646 --> 00:10:13,112
Yes, sir.

178
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,115
Oh.

179
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:18,117
Now, madam.

180
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,623
There's a good girl.

181
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:27,426
Will that
be all, ma'am?

182
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:29,929
Yes. Thank you,
nelda. Good night.

183
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:31,430
Good night, ma'am.

184
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:37,937
Nelda!

185
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,154
Time is running out, father.

186
00:10:55,189 --> 00:10:58,157
Instead of controlling,
you're being controlled.

187
00:10:58,192 --> 00:10:59,659
Why, you're becoming dependent.

188
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,661
You're both reaching a point

189
00:11:01,696 --> 00:11:04,664
where you won't be able
to exist without them.

190
00:11:04,699 --> 00:11:07,166
Destroy them, father.

191
00:11:07,201 --> 00:11:09,168
Get rid of them.

192
00:11:09,203 --> 00:11:11,170
Dismantle them.

193
00:11:11,205 --> 00:11:12,171
Jana!

194
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,677
Jana, they're
not just machines.

195
00:11:17,712 --> 00:11:20,179
Do you know how many
thousands of hours

196
00:11:20,214 --> 00:11:21,681
i've spent in
developing them

197
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,182
and perfecting them?

198
00:11:23,217 --> 00:11:26,686
Do you realize how... how
marvelously intricate they are?

199
00:11:26,721 --> 00:11:28,187
How scientifically
precise?

200
00:11:28,222 --> 00:11:31,691
Not just arms and legs
that move, jana.

201
00:11:31,726 --> 00:11:33,693
They're creatures.

202
00:11:33,728 --> 00:11:35,695
They have minds
and wills.

203
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:37,697
They have memory
tracks, you see?

204
00:11:37,732 --> 00:11:41,701
I've given each one of them a
memory of his own, haven't i?

205
00:11:41,736 --> 00:11:43,202
Yes.

206
00:11:43,237 --> 00:11:45,805
And all of them can
recount to you in detail

207
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,307
everything that's
happened to them

208
00:11:48,342 --> 00:11:49,809
since their
early childhood,

209
00:11:49,844 --> 00:11:51,310
and they had no childhood.

210
00:11:51,345 --> 00:11:54,313
They were born just as you
see them now, weren't they?

211
00:11:54,348 --> 00:11:55,815
Yes.

212
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:59,318
Looking the way they do,
acting the way they do,

213
00:11:59,353 --> 00:12:01,320
but each with
his own talent.

214
00:12:01,355 --> 00:12:03,322
One of them was
built as a cook.

215
00:12:03,357 --> 00:12:05,324
Another was built
as a maid.

216
00:12:05,359 --> 00:12:07,827
The butler was
manufactured as a butler.

217
00:12:07,862 --> 00:12:10,830
The handyman knows nothing
but being a handyman.

218
00:12:10,865 --> 00:12:14,333
Jana, you're not asking me
to dismantle machines.

219
00:12:14,368 --> 00:12:15,334
You're asking me

220
00:12:15,369 --> 00:12:17,837
to destroy
that which has life.

221
00:12:17,872 --> 00:12:18,838
Life?

222
00:12:18,873 --> 00:12:22,842
They're just highly
complicated toys.

223
00:12:22,877 --> 00:12:24,844
Father, you've
turned this house

224
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:26,345
into a playroom.

225
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,848
Why, jana, dear.

226
00:12:28,883 --> 00:12:30,349
Listen to your mother.

227
00:12:30,384 --> 00:12:32,852
You're acting like
a willful child.

228
00:12:32,887 --> 00:12:33,853
A willful child?

229
00:12:33,888 --> 00:12:35,855
I'm acting like
a woman, mother,

230
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:38,357
who wants something
more out of life

231
00:12:38,392 --> 00:12:40,860
than just to be massaged
five times a day.

232
00:12:40,895 --> 00:12:42,862
Or a man
who thinks paradise

233
00:12:42,897 --> 00:12:45,364
is having his pipes
filled and refilled,

234
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:47,867
and his slippers
put on and taken off.

235
00:12:47,902 --> 00:12:50,870
You've got to get
rid of them, father-

236
00:12:50,905 --> 00:12:53,372
nelda, gretchen, suzanne-
all of them.

237
00:12:53,407 --> 00:12:55,875
That is quite
impossible.

238
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:58,878
I'll give you a choice-

239
00:12:58,913 --> 00:13:01,881
get rid of them
or i'll leave.

240
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:04,383
You can't leave,
jana, dear.

241
00:13:04,418 --> 00:13:06,886
Why, you simply
can't leave.

242
00:13:06,921 --> 00:13:08,888
Well, what would
happen to you?

243
00:13:08,923 --> 00:13:10,890
Who'd look
after you?

244
00:13:10,925 --> 00:13:13,392
What would you
do out there?

245
00:13:13,427 --> 00:13:16,395
I'd be with normal
people, mother-

246
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:19,398
people who live
and work and then die-

247
00:13:19,433 --> 00:13:22,401
but do it properly,
the way god intended.

248
00:13:22,436 --> 00:13:25,404
That's where i want
to be- out there!

249
00:13:25,439 --> 00:13:27,907
I want my freedom.

250
00:13:27,942 --> 00:13:31,410
Jana, it just
isn't possible.

251
00:13:31,445 --> 00:13:33,412
I want my freedom!

252
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:36,615
Miss jana,
you'll forgive me

253
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:39,618
but that was most
intemperate of you.

254
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:42,121
I consider that
unforgivable behavior.

255
00:13:42,156 --> 00:13:44,623
Jana, you must have
respect for your parents.

256
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:47,126
I agree. You must
show respect.

257
00:13:47,161 --> 00:13:48,627
Stop it!

258
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:50,930
You're jokes.

259
00:13:50,965 --> 00:13:52,431
That's what you are.

260
00:13:52,466 --> 00:13:53,933
Hysterical jokes,

261
00:13:53,968 --> 00:13:57,937
with your sad little homilies
and your mouthed cliches.

262
00:13:57,972 --> 00:14:00,940
You're nothing but walking record players.

263
00:14:00,975 --> 00:14:02,441
That's all
any of you are-

264
00:14:02,476 --> 00:14:03,943
walking record
players.

265
00:14:03,978 --> 00:14:05,945
Jana, you're
making it difficult

266
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:06,946
for me to be patient.

267
00:14:06,981 --> 00:14:07,947
Very difficult indeed.

268
00:14:07,982 --> 00:14:09,448
I do apologize, father.

269
00:14:09,483 --> 00:14:12,451
I know how accustomed
to perfection you are,

270
00:14:12,486 --> 00:14:16,455
and i hate to throw a stone
in that serene pool of yours,

271
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:17,456
but you forgot
something.

272
00:14:17,491 --> 00:14:19,458
Do you know that?
You forgot something.

273
00:14:19,493 --> 00:14:23,762
They may be indestructible,
father, but you're not!

274
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:10,109
Jana.

275
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:14,113
Jana, dear,
you don't really

276
00:15:14,148 --> 00:15:16,115
want to leave us,
do you?

277
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:19,618
I thought i made it
quite plain, father.

278
00:15:19,653 --> 00:15:22,121
I want you to
open the windows

279
00:15:22,156 --> 00:15:23,622
and let the air in.

280
00:15:23,657 --> 00:15:26,125
I want you to
let the world in.

281
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,627
By destroying my
whole life's work.

282
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:31,630
Jana, we've loved
you very much.

283
00:15:31,665 --> 00:15:33,132
If you could only see

284
00:15:33,167 --> 00:15:37,136
that all of this has been
just as much for you

285
00:15:37,171 --> 00:15:38,137
as for ourselves.

286
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:42,141
Oh, jana, we love you
more than words can tell.

287
00:15:42,176 --> 00:15:44,143
I know that, father.

288
00:15:44,178 --> 00:15:45,644
I know that.

289
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:48,147
Then... then
you will stay.

290
00:15:48,182 --> 00:15:50,149
Oh, please stay, jana.

291
00:15:50,184 --> 00:15:52,651
I beg of you, please.

292
00:15:52,686 --> 00:15:54,153
No.

293
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:11,170
Jana, i'll do what
you asked me to do.

294
00:16:11,205 --> 00:16:13,172
I promise you.

295
00:16:13,207 --> 00:16:16,175
I'll do it right away.

296
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:25,184
Nelda, gretchen, suzanne-
all of you-

297
00:16:25,219 --> 00:16:27,686
rest in peace.

298
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,519
Robert.
Sir?

299
00:17:00,554 --> 00:17:03,022
I want you to take
all the servants

300
00:17:03,057 --> 00:17:05,524
downstairs to my workroom.

301
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:07,526
Just stay there
until i come.

302
00:17:07,561 --> 00:17:10,529
Have our services
been unsatisfactory, sir?

303
00:17:10,564 --> 00:17:13,032
Robert, i have
given you an order.

304
00:17:13,067 --> 00:17:16,035
You are, all of you,
to go downstairs

305
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:18,037
and wait for me.

306
00:17:18,072 --> 00:17:19,538
But i've been
an excellent butler, sir.

307
00:17:19,573 --> 00:17:21,540
You know i have.
I think you'll agree with me.

308
00:17:21,575 --> 00:17:23,042
I came very well-
recommended, sir.

309
00:17:23,077 --> 00:17:24,543
There isn't a more
efficient maid

310
00:17:24,578 --> 00:17:25,544
in the entire
country.

311
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:27,546
I can fix anything
that has to be fixed.

312
00:17:31,585 --> 00:17:34,053
No more!

313
00:17:34,088 --> 00:17:36,555
Robert,
you have your orders.

314
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:14,393
It's all over.

315
00:18:14,428 --> 00:18:16,895
We're alone
in the house now.

316
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:20,399
Alone, william?

317
00:18:20,434 --> 00:18:22,401
Yes, my dear.
Quite alone.

318
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:24,403
You and i and
our daughter.

319
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:27,406
I've become so
accustomed to them.

320
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:29,408
It'll be difficult
at first,

321
00:18:29,443 --> 00:18:30,909
won't it, william?

322
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:34,413
Yes, my dear, a little,
in the beginning.

323
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:56,034
Oh, mother.

324
00:18:56,069 --> 00:18:58,537
We're going to live
like normal people

325
00:18:58,572 --> 00:18:59,538
do you understand?

326
00:18:59,573 --> 00:19:01,039
Normal people.

327
00:19:01,074 --> 00:19:02,541
We're going
to give parties

328
00:19:02,576 --> 00:19:05,544
and we'll take trips
and we'll make friends

329
00:19:05,579 --> 00:19:07,045
and i'll find
a young man.

330
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:10,048
I'll find a young man
and, before you know it,

331
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:12,551
we're going to
have grandchildren.

332
00:19:12,586 --> 00:19:16,555
Oh, father,
grandchildren.

333
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:19,057
What's the matter?

334
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:23,462
What is it?

335
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:26,465
It's what you said
about grandchildren.

336
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,467
You see, what your
mother means, jana...

337
00:19:28,502 --> 00:19:31,470
what she means is it's
perfectly normal and natural

338
00:19:31,505 --> 00:19:33,472
for parents to think
of their children

339
00:19:33,507 --> 00:19:34,773
as children.

340
00:19:34,808 --> 00:19:37,276
And then, when
suddenly they grow up

341
00:19:37,311 --> 00:19:40,279
and they talk of having
children of their own,

342
00:19:40,314 --> 00:19:43,282
it's a little
difficult for parents

343
00:19:43,317 --> 00:19:45,284
to absorb quite
so quickly.

344
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:46,785
Something's
not right.

345
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:50,289
Something's not right.

346
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,293
Something's
not right.

347
00:19:54,328 --> 00:19:57,296
What is it?

348
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,303
Why aren't any of my pictures
in the photo albums?

349
00:20:04,338 --> 00:20:06,805
There are no pictures
of me here at all.

350
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,308
Jana, dear, there are
many pictures of you.

351
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:11,310
Here's a picture
of you at easter.

352
00:20:11,345 --> 00:20:12,811
Why, there are
pictures of you

353
00:20:12,846 --> 00:20:15,314
decorating the christmas tree last year.

354
00:20:15,349 --> 00:20:17,316
Not as a little
girl, mother.

355
00:20:17,351 --> 00:20:19,318
There are no pictures of me

356
00:20:19,353 --> 00:20:20,319
as a little girl.

357
00:20:20,354 --> 00:20:22,821
Pictures of you and
father and the robots.

358
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:25,324
Always pictures
of the robots-

359
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:26,825
10 years ago,
20 years ago-

360
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,327
but no pictures of me. Why?

361
00:20:28,362 --> 00:20:30,329
I want you
to tell me why.

362
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,832
Why?

363
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:38,837
It's not true.

364
00:20:38,872 --> 00:20:42,841
Oh, it couldn't be true.

365
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:47,846
Please tell me it's not true.

366
00:20:47,881 --> 00:20:49,848
Jana...

367
00:20:49,883 --> 00:20:52,851
you are our daughter-
you know you're our daughter-

368
00:20:52,886 --> 00:20:55,354
and you remember everything
from your childhood.

369
00:20:55,389 --> 00:20:57,356
You remember the
schools you went to,

370
00:20:57,391 --> 00:20:59,358
the children you played with,

371
00:20:59,393 --> 00:21:01,860
and you remember all
the places you went to.

372
00:21:01,895 --> 00:21:04,363
You do remember
them, jana?

373
00:21:04,398 --> 00:21:05,864
You've got to.

374
00:21:05,899 --> 00:21:09,368
Why have i got
to remember them?

375
00:21:09,403 --> 00:21:11,870
Because you
fed them to me?

376
00:21:11,905 --> 00:21:16,875
A memory track.

377
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:21,880
What am i?

378
00:21:21,915 --> 00:21:25,384
Oh, please,
tell me what i am.

379
00:21:25,419 --> 00:21:27,386
It doesn't make any difference.

380
00:21:27,421 --> 00:21:30,389
It doesn't make any
difference at all, jana.

381
00:21:30,424 --> 00:21:31,890
We were childless.

382
00:21:31,925 --> 00:21:34,893
We had nothing of our
flesh to leave behind-

383
00:21:34,928 --> 00:21:38,397
nothing of our hearts,
nothing of our love.

384
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,398
So, you see...

385
00:21:39,433 --> 00:21:41,900
we got you.

386
00:21:41,935 --> 00:21:43,902
You made me.

387
00:21:43,937 --> 00:21:46,905
You built me.

388
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:50,909
You manufactured me.

389
00:21:50,944 --> 00:21:54,913
Of course, the maid
was built as a maid,

390
00:21:54,948 --> 00:21:57,916
the butler manufactured
as a butler,

391
00:21:57,951 --> 00:22:01,420
and the cook and the handyman,
all for a particular purpose.

392
00:22:01,455 --> 00:22:02,921
And the daughter...

393
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:07,326
you built a daughter!

394
00:22:07,361 --> 00:22:10,429
Jana, i created you
as a thing of love.

395
00:22:10,464 --> 00:22:12,431
It doesn't matter
what you are

396
00:22:12,466 --> 00:22:13,432
or how you got here.

397
00:22:13,467 --> 00:22:14,933
You're our daughter.

398
00:22:14,968 --> 00:22:17,436
Jana, you've got
to understand that.

399
00:22:17,471 --> 00:22:18,937
You're our daughter.

400
00:22:18,972 --> 00:22:21,440
I can't be
your daughter.

401
00:22:21,475 --> 00:22:22,941
I'm a thing.

402
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:24,443
I'm a machine.

403
00:22:24,478 --> 00:22:25,744
A machine!

404
00:22:25,779 --> 00:22:28,246
Jana, jana.

405
00:22:28,281 --> 00:22:29,748
No pain.

406
00:22:29,783 --> 00:22:32,751
No pain at all!

407
00:22:32,786 --> 00:22:34,653
No pain.

408
00:22:34,688 --> 00:22:36,655
Jana, stop it!

409
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:39,157
No pain.

410
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:43,662
No love.

411
00:22:43,697 --> 00:22:48,166
I can't
even feel love.

412
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:50,669
Oh!

413
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:57,175
William, what
will we do?

414
00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:00,679
Everything's
changed now.

415
00:23:00,714 --> 00:23:03,682
She'll never
be the same.

416
00:23:03,717 --> 00:23:06,685
What will we do,
william?

417
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:15,193
William,
you wouldn't.

418
00:23:15,228 --> 00:23:18,697
No, i couldn't do
anything like that.

419
00:23:18,732 --> 00:23:23,702
I couldn't stand not
having her here anymore.

420
00:23:23,737 --> 00:23:26,705
I just couldn't
stand that.

421
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:32,210
Jana, jana, jana...

422
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:53,532
just a little
to the left, nelda.

423
00:23:53,567 --> 00:23:55,033
Not quite so hard.

424
00:23:56,535 --> 00:24:01,039
Of course, mrs. Loren,
of course.

425
00:24:01,074 --> 00:24:04,042
Should you be worn out

426
00:24:04,077 --> 00:24:06,545
by the rigors of competing
in a very competitive world,

427
00:24:07,045 --> 00:24:09,548
if you're distraught from
having to share your existence

428
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:12,551
with the noises and neuroses
of the 20th century,

429
00:24:12,586 --> 00:24:14,052
if you crave serenity

430
00:24:14,087 --> 00:24:16,555
but want it full-time and
with no strings attached,

431
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:19,057
get yourself a workroom
in the basement,

432
00:24:19,092 --> 00:24:22,060
and then drop a note
to dr. And mrs. William loren.

433
00:24:22,095 --> 00:24:23,562
They're a childless couple

434
00:24:23,597 --> 00:24:25,564
who've made comfort
a life's work,

435
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:28,567
and maybe there are a few
do-it-yourself pamphlets

436
00:24:28,602 --> 00:24:30,569
still available
in the twilight zone.

437
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:34,773
Rod serling,
creator ofthe twilight zone,

438
00:24:34,808 --> 00:24:37,275
will tell you
about next week's story

439
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:39,277
after this word
from our alternate sponsor.

440
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:42,581
And now, mr. Serling.

441
00:24:42,616 --> 00:24:45,083
An attractive
and rather imposing room

442
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:47,085
lived in
by a man named templeton.

443
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,087
And, like most rooms,
suggestive, really,

444
00:24:49,122 --> 00:24:51,089
of only a part of the man-
the outside part.

445
00:24:51,124 --> 00:24:53,592
Our story next week
takes off from here.

446
00:24:53,627 --> 00:24:55,627
Mr. Brian aherne lends us
his considerable talents

447
00:24:55,662 --> 00:24:58,129
in a script by e. Jack neuman

448
00:24:58,164 --> 00:25:00,131
called
"the trouble with templeton."

449
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:02,150
It can best be described
as poignant, provocative,

450
00:25:02,185 --> 00:25:05,654
and a highly-diverting trip
into the twilight zone.
