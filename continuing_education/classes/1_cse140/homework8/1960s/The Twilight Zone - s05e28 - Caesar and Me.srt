1
00:00:05,972 --> 00:00:09,726
You unlock this door
with the key of imagination.

2
00:00:09,761 --> 00:00:11,611
Beyond it is another dimension-

3
00:00:11,646 --> 00:00:12,862
a dimension of sound,

4
00:00:13,515 --> 00:00:15,982
a dimension of sight,

5
00:00:16,017 --> 00:00:17,867
a dimension of mind.

6
00:00:17,902 --> 00:00:20,987
You're moving into a land
of both shadow and substance,

7
00:00:21,022 --> 00:00:22,872
of things and ideas.

8
00:00:22,907 --> 00:00:25,992
You've just crossed over
into the twilight zone.

9
00:00:36,002 --> 00:00:39,255
Oh, sure, it's
a nice watch,

10
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:41,758
but i'm sorry,
mr. West.

11
00:00:41,793 --> 00:00:46,763
I'm afraid
that that's all
i can give you.

12
00:00:46,798 --> 00:00:48,648
That belonged
to my grandfather.

13
00:00:48,683 --> 00:00:50,517
Five dollars,
mr. West.

14
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:54,904
Now, don't
you worry.

15
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:57,407
Your luck is bound
to get better.

16
00:00:57,442 --> 00:00:58,658
Oh, sure,
sure it will.

17
00:00:58,693 --> 00:01:01,161
Now, listen,
i'll be coming back

18
00:01:01,196 --> 00:01:02,412
real soon
to claim that

19
00:01:02,447 --> 00:01:04,280
so please,
don't sell it, huh?

20
00:01:04,315 --> 00:01:06,166
I'll do my best.

21
00:01:06,201 --> 00:01:06,783
Thank you.

22
00:01:07,417 --> 00:01:09,285
For 30 days,
at least.

23
00:01:11,788 --> 00:01:13,039
Mr. West.

24
00:01:13,074 --> 00:01:14,290
I'll, uh...

25
00:01:14,325 --> 00:01:16,176
i'll give you
$25 for him.

26
00:01:16,211 --> 00:01:18,044
Oh, thank you, no.

27
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:21,181
No, thank you,
he's not for sale.

28
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:34,811
Oh, good afternoon,
mrs. Cudahy.

29
00:01:34,846 --> 00:01:37,313
Hello, mr. West.

30
00:01:46,107 --> 00:01:49,075
Nuts.

31
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,960
Why, susan, i'm warning you
for the last time now.

32
00:01:50,995 --> 00:01:52,829
You stop playing
with those poison darts.

33
00:01:52,864 --> 00:01:55,331
They're not really poison,
aunt agnes,

34
00:01:55,366 --> 00:01:57,217
and i missed him anyway.

35
00:01:57,252 --> 00:01:58,468
Wanna bet you didn't get a job?

36
00:01:58,503 --> 00:02:01,588
Susan.
Go out and play.

37
00:02:01,623 --> 00:02:02,839
Oh, i am so sorry,
mr. West.

38
00:02:02,874 --> 00:02:04,090
I don't know
what i'm going to do

39
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:05,341
with that little girl.

40
00:02:05,376 --> 00:02:07,844
That's perfectly all
right, mrs. Cudahy.

41
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:09,729
I imagine you have
your hands full.

42
00:02:15,351 --> 00:02:18,488
You just sit right here
and relax

43
00:02:18,523 --> 00:02:20,356
and i'll fix us some dinner.

44
00:02:20,391 --> 00:02:22,859
A fella deserves
something in his stomach

45
00:02:22,894 --> 00:02:25,361
at the end of a tough day, huh?

46
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:28,498
Now, this ought to do it.

47
00:02:28,533 --> 00:02:32,252
I'll warm up some of that
fine potato soup i made for you.

48
00:02:32,287 --> 00:02:33,503
And don't
you worry-

49
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,754
we'll get
a booking

50
00:02:34,789 --> 00:02:36,623
any day now,
you and me.

51
00:02:36,658 --> 00:02:38,508
We're going to be headliners

52
00:02:38,543 --> 00:02:42,262
just like you and
that other fellow used to be.

53
00:02:42,297 --> 00:02:45,381
Only i won't skip out on you
like he did.

54
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:47,267
No, sir.

55
00:02:47,302 --> 00:02:50,386
The shame of it all.

56
00:02:50,421 --> 00:02:53,523
Abandoning you for some woman!

57
00:02:55,391 --> 00:02:57,894
No, sir!

58
00:02:57,929 --> 00:03:01,648
It's going to be you and me,
pal, together forever!

59
00:03:01,683 --> 00:03:05,151
Why don't you stop
kidding yourself, buddy?

60
00:03:05,186 --> 00:03:07,036
Face it, you're finished.

61
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:13,409
Jonathan west, ventriloquist,
a master of voice manipulation.

62
00:03:14,043 --> 00:03:15,912
A man, late of ireland,

63
00:03:15,947 --> 00:03:19,666
with a talent for putting words
into other peoples' mouths.

64
00:03:19,701 --> 00:03:23,419
In this case, the other person
is a dummy aptly named caesar,

65
00:03:23,454 --> 00:03:25,922
a small splinter
with large ideas,

66
00:03:25,957 --> 00:03:29,058
a wooden tyrant with a mind
and a voice of his own

67
00:03:29,093 --> 00:03:32,812
who is about to talk jonathan
west into the twilight zone.

68
00:03:51,614 --> 00:03:52,865
Tonight's the night.

69
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,117
I can feel it,

70
00:03:54,152 --> 00:03:56,002
we're going
to knock 'em dead.

71
00:03:56,037 --> 00:03:59,122
Wait till they hear
the new material.

72
00:04:02,293 --> 00:04:04,761
Oh, hello, susan.

73
00:04:04,796 --> 00:04:06,012
Show me how you
make him talk.

74
00:04:06,047 --> 00:04:07,263
Oh, i'd like
to, susan,

75
00:04:07,298 --> 00:04:09,132
but we're in a big
hurry right now.

76
00:04:09,167 --> 00:04:11,017
We're on our
way downtown.

77
00:04:11,052 --> 00:04:12,885
We've got an
important appointment.

78
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,388
An audition, as
a matter of fact.

79
00:04:15,423 --> 00:04:17,273
Just do it once,
jonathan.

80
00:04:17,308 --> 00:04:19,142
The part where
he laughs.

81
00:04:19,177 --> 00:04:21,644
I want to see if
your lips move.

82
00:04:22,278 --> 00:04:22,895
All right.

83
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,781
Caesar, what did
the lady say

84
00:04:24,816 --> 00:04:26,032
she would do to you

85
00:04:26,067 --> 00:04:27,900
if you ever
misbehaved again?

86
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:29,152
She said

87
00:04:29,187 --> 00:04:31,654
she'd slice me
into a venetian blind.

88
00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:32,905
And you replied?

89
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:33,539
I said

90
00:04:34,157 --> 00:04:35,408
"oh, you make me shudder!"

91
00:04:39,162 --> 00:04:41,047
I didn't see
your lips move.

92
00:04:41,082 --> 00:04:42,298
That's right,
you didn't.

93
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:43,549
If you're so good,

94
00:04:43,584 --> 00:04:46,052
then how come you
can't get a job?

95
00:04:46,087 --> 00:04:48,554
Well, all that's
going to change,

96
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:49,806
young lady, tonight.

97
00:04:49,841 --> 00:04:51,674
You've said
that before.

98
00:04:51,709 --> 00:04:54,177
Susan, where are you?

99
00:04:54,212 --> 00:04:55,428
Go on,
run along.

100
00:04:55,463 --> 00:04:57,313
You won't
get the job.

101
00:04:59,182 --> 00:05:00,433
Hey, pal!

102
00:05:00,468 --> 00:05:02,685
Keep that brat
out of this room.

103
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,438
Now, now, don't you
worry about her,

104
00:05:05,473 --> 00:05:06,689
my lovely friend.

105
00:05:06,724 --> 00:05:08,574
We're going
to kill 'em.

106
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,698
Caesar, there's
a man outside.

107
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:16,949
What about it?

108
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:19,452
A man with a wooden
leg named smith.

109
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,337
Is that so?

110
00:05:21,372 --> 00:05:23,206
What's the name
of his other leg?

111
00:05:26,342 --> 00:05:28,211
Would you like me
to go through

112
00:05:28,246 --> 00:05:30,096
the juvenile
delinquent routine?

113
00:05:30,131 --> 00:05:31,347
It's really very funny.

114
00:05:31,382 --> 00:05:33,216
No, that'll be all.

115
00:05:33,251 --> 00:05:35,101
Just leave
your phone number.

116
00:05:35,136 --> 00:05:36,969
We'll get
in touch with you.

117
00:05:39,722 --> 00:05:41,607
Maybe mr. Miller
had a fight

118
00:05:41,642 --> 00:05:42,859
with his wife
at breakfast.

119
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:46,612
Maybe he heard
your bad jokes.

120
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,993
Ah, morning, mrs. Cudahy.

121
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:02,879
It's a lovely
day, isn't it?

122
00:06:02,914 --> 00:06:04,747
Yes, it is, mr. West.

123
00:06:04,782 --> 00:06:06,632
I have to talk to you.

124
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:08,501
I know, mrs. Cudahy,
i know.

125
00:06:08,536 --> 00:06:09,752
It's about the rent.

126
00:06:09,787 --> 00:06:11,003
But i'll have that
all straightened out

127
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:12,255
by this evening.
Oh, that'll be nice.

128
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:15,391
You see, i'm
looking for a job

129
00:06:15,426 --> 00:06:17,894
something till the
show biz picks up.

130
00:06:17,929 --> 00:06:19,762
Well, as you're in
that frame of mind

131
00:06:20,396 --> 00:06:21,647
maybe i can
help you.

132
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:22,899
Now, this is
my cousin.

133
00:06:22,934 --> 00:06:25,401
He works at that
employment agency.

134
00:06:25,436 --> 00:06:27,904
Well, thank you
very much, mrs. Cudahy.

135
00:06:27,939 --> 00:06:30,406
My, you are
a living darling!

136
00:06:40,032 --> 00:06:40,666
Typing?

137
00:06:40,701 --> 00:06:43,169
No, sir.

138
00:06:43,204 --> 00:06:43,786
Salesman?

139
00:06:43,821 --> 00:06:45,671
No, sir.

140
00:06:46,923 --> 00:06:48,174
Mechanic?

141
00:06:48,209 --> 00:06:50,676
Uh... no.

142
00:06:50,711 --> 00:06:52,545
Mr. West, have
you ever held

143
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,796
a position
of any sort?

144
00:06:53,831 --> 00:06:56,299
Ever made any kind
of a regular salary?

145
00:06:56,334 --> 00:06:58,801
That is, besides
show business?

146
00:06:58,836 --> 00:07:00,686
Well, sir, uh...
yes, i did.

147
00:07:00,721 --> 00:07:01,938
Doing what,
may i ask?

148
00:07:01,973 --> 00:07:04,440
Back home i worked
for a puppeteer

149
00:07:04,475 --> 00:07:06,309
as his apprentice.

150
00:07:06,344 --> 00:07:07,560
Apprentice?

151
00:07:07,595 --> 00:07:10,062
Yes, sir, he taught me
my trade.

152
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:13,199
And i came to your country
to earn me fortune.

153
00:07:13,234 --> 00:07:16,319
Well, then you're not
a citizen, mr. West?

154
00:07:16,354 --> 00:07:18,821
Oh, no, sir, not yet,
but i'm studying

155
00:07:18,856 --> 00:07:20,072
and i soon will be.

156
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:21,324
That's very nice.

157
00:07:21,359 --> 00:07:23,826
All right, we have
your number.

158
00:07:23,861 --> 00:07:25,077
We'll call you

159
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:26,963
if we get anything
in your line.

160
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:41,344
? jonathan can't
find a job...?

161
00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:43,229
Susan, why don't
you go find

162
00:07:43,264 --> 00:07:44,480
somebody else
to bother?

163
00:07:44,515 --> 00:07:45,731
The truth hurts!

164
00:07:45,766 --> 00:07:48,234
And you're too scared
to tell my aunt

165
00:07:48,269 --> 00:07:50,736
because you're behind
in your rent.

166
00:07:53,274 --> 00:07:54,740
Now what?

167
00:07:54,857 --> 00:07:56,108
I don't know.

168
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:59,245
It seems no matter
what i try, i fail.

169
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,747
If i could just get
some money together-

170
00:08:01,782 --> 00:08:04,250
enough for some food
and to pay the rent-

171
00:08:04,285 --> 00:08:06,752
i could think clearly
without these pressures.

172
00:08:06,787 --> 00:08:09,872
Just a little money for
food and rent, is that it?

173
00:08:09,907 --> 00:08:13,626
Is that all you
want out of life?

174
00:08:13,661 --> 00:08:14,877
I guess so.

175
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:16,762
You're a clod.

176
00:08:16,797 --> 00:08:18,130
A real clod.

177
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:20,766
I try, i give it my best.

178
00:08:20,883 --> 00:08:22,134
Your best stinks.

179
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:25,137
In the name of heaven, caesar,
i've had enough!

180
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:26,389
I'vehad enough.

181
00:08:26,424 --> 00:08:27,890
Get that through your head.

182
00:08:29,025 --> 00:08:30,276
What do you mean?

183
00:08:30,893 --> 00:08:33,396
Let me spell out
the cold, hard facts-

184
00:08:33,431 --> 00:08:37,783
the way it's going to be
and what you're going to do.

185
00:08:38,534 --> 00:08:41,037
Oh, forget it, i'm a failure.

186
00:08:41,072 --> 00:08:42,905
Will you shut up
and listen?

187
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,908
There's all kinds of ways
to get hold of money.

188
00:08:45,943 --> 00:08:47,543
I've tried everything.

189
00:08:47,578 --> 00:08:49,912
You havenottried everything.

190
00:08:49,947 --> 00:08:51,163
Now, shut up...

191
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:53,049
and listen.

192
00:08:59,422 --> 00:09:01,307
Where are we now?

193
00:09:01,342 --> 00:09:05,678
We're right in front
of the furniture store.

194
00:09:05,713 --> 00:09:07,313
I don't mean
that, stupid!

195
00:09:07,348 --> 00:09:09,815
I mean, how far are we
from the delicatessen?

196
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,067
Please, not so loud!

197
00:09:11,102 --> 00:09:12,935
Why, is there
anyone around?

198
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:15,438
No, no, but please,
be quiet!

199
00:09:15,473 --> 00:09:18,574
Tell me when
we're in front
of our mark.

200
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,945
Now what?

201
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,448
I lost my footing,
it's very dark.

202
00:09:25,483 --> 00:09:27,950
Good, that's
a break.

203
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:30,453
Are we on the
sidewalk now?

204
00:09:30,488 --> 00:09:31,704
Yes.

205
00:09:31,739 --> 00:09:35,458
Yes, now we're right in front
of the delicatessen.

206
00:09:35,493 --> 00:09:36,709
Is the
coast clear?

207
00:09:36,744 --> 00:09:37,960
Yes.

208
00:09:37,995 --> 00:09:40,463
There's absolutely
no one around.

209
00:09:40,498 --> 00:09:41,097
Okay.

210
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:42,965
Then stop
wasting time.

211
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,850
Move!

212
00:09:58,864 --> 00:10:01,734
31... 32...
33.

213
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:03,619
There you are,
mrs. Cudahy

214
00:10:03,654 --> 00:10:04,870
all paid up in full.

215
00:10:04,905 --> 00:10:06,122
Will wonders
ever cease?

216
00:10:06,157 --> 00:10:07,990
Shh, susan.

217
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:09,875
Isn't it nice
to pay your bills?

218
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,127
Yes, ma'am.

219
00:10:11,162 --> 00:10:12,378
Better count it
again, auntie.

220
00:10:12,413 --> 00:10:13,629
See if they're real.

221
00:10:13,664 --> 00:10:16,132
Susan, be a good girl
and go tidy up your room.

222
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:17,383
And don't be fresh
to mr. West.

223
00:10:17,418 --> 00:10:19,251
He has a new start on life,
don't you, mr. West?

224
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:21,137
That's right,
mrs. Cudahy,
a new start.

225
00:10:21,172 --> 00:10:22,388
Don't let her
worry you.

226
00:10:22,423 --> 00:10:24,890
You know how children
are these days.

227
00:10:24,925 --> 00:10:26,142
Oh, i understand.

228
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:34,266
A common thief.

229
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:39,905
What a way
to make a living.

230
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,408
You couldn't make it
any other way.

231
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,162
What's happened to me?

232
00:10:46,197 --> 00:10:48,030
What am i?

233
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:50,533
A no-talent
ventriloquist.

234
00:10:50,568 --> 00:10:51,784
Worse.

235
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:53,669
A second-rate thief.

236
00:10:53,704 --> 00:10:54,537
Third-rate.

237
00:10:54,572 --> 00:10:56,288
Starving to death.

238
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:57,540
In the profession i know

239
00:10:57,575 --> 00:11:01,927
paying the bills by robbing
the neighborhood delicatessen.

240
00:11:01,962 --> 00:11:02,795
Well, that's show biz.

241
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:04,797
I guess i wasn't too bad

242
00:11:04,832 --> 00:11:07,933
considering it was
my opening performance.

243
00:11:07,968 --> 00:11:09,685
Let me straighten you out

244
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,805
before you start taking
too many bows.

245
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,807
Oh, caesar,
just let me alone, please.

246
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:17,309
No! Let me spell
it out for you.

247
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:20,696
You act penny ante
because you think penny ante.

248
00:11:20,731 --> 00:11:23,199
That's the story of your life.

249
00:11:23,234 --> 00:11:24,066
From now on,

250
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:25,951
you're going
to listen to me.

251
00:11:25,986 --> 00:11:30,206
You're going to get rid of
that shanty irish routine.

252
00:11:30,241 --> 00:11:31,457
This is america.

253
00:11:31,492 --> 00:11:33,576
What do you mean?

254
00:11:33,611 --> 00:11:35,461
Open your eyes!
Look around you!

255
00:11:35,496 --> 00:11:39,582
The streets are paved with gold,
and it's sitting out there

256
00:11:39,617 --> 00:11:42,468
waiting for us.

257
00:12:10,446 --> 00:12:14,200
Think you're smart,
don't you, mr. Stuck-up?

258
00:12:14,235 --> 00:12:16,702
Just 'cause you're
on the stage.

259
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:44,113
You can talk!

260
00:12:44,148 --> 00:12:45,981
I heard you!

261
00:12:46,615 --> 00:12:49,735
Come on,
say something.

262
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:50,986
I dare you.

263
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:11,507
Susan!

264
00:13:12,641 --> 00:13:14,510
What were you
doing in my room?

265
00:13:14,545 --> 00:13:16,395
You're hurting me-
i'll tell my aunt.

266
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:18,647
Didn't she tell you to stay
out of the guest rooms.

267
00:13:18,682 --> 00:13:19,899
Now what were you
doing in there?

268
00:13:19,934 --> 00:13:21,767
Wouldn't you
like to know?

269
00:13:21,802 --> 00:13:24,019
You brat, tell me
what you were doing.

270
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:26,906
You're so smart, ask him.

271
00:13:38,167 --> 00:13:40,035
Caesar.

272
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:45,040
Caesar, what happened?

273
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:46,292
Sit down.

274
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:49,295
Did she do anything to hurt you?

275
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:51,180
Never mind that.

276
00:13:51,215 --> 00:13:53,048
First things
first.

277
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,300
We've got to get of here.

278
00:13:54,335 --> 00:13:56,185
I'm scared.

279
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,436
Maybe she knows.

280
00:13:57,471 --> 00:13:59,305
This is no time to get chicken.

281
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,190
After
tonight's job,

282
00:14:01,225 --> 00:14:03,058
we'll be on
easy street.

283
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:04,944
You don't understand

284
00:14:04,979 --> 00:14:07,446
i'm not cut out
for this line of work.

285
00:14:07,481 --> 00:14:08,063
Take it easy.

286
00:14:08,098 --> 00:14:09,949
You're eating,
aren't you?

287
00:14:09,984 --> 00:14:11,200
You're paying
the rent.

288
00:14:11,235 --> 00:14:13,068
Where were you before?

289
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:14,320
Now, listen to me.

290
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:16,205
This is the big one.

291
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,073
But this is the last one.

292
00:14:18,707 --> 00:14:19,959
The end for me.

293
00:14:19,994 --> 00:14:21,210
Yeah, sure.

294
00:14:21,245 --> 00:14:22,461
Sure
it is, pal.

295
00:14:22,496 --> 00:14:23,712
Just one more.

296
00:14:23,747 --> 00:14:25,581
The "really big shoe."

297
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:40,479
It's all right so far.

298
00:14:40,514 --> 00:14:41,730
There's no one around.

299
00:14:41,765 --> 00:14:43,599
Then get moving.

300
00:14:43,634 --> 00:14:46,735
Up to the front office.

301
00:14:51,106 --> 00:14:52,358
It's only the mice.

302
00:14:52,393 --> 00:14:54,860
Get going before
they attack us.

303
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:56,745
And stop shaking.

304
00:15:19,635 --> 00:15:20,886
Hurry up.

305
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:22,137
You got the wire?

306
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:23,389
Yes.

307
00:15:23,424 --> 00:15:25,891
Remember, if the
watchman comes around,

308
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:27,776
just stay as calm
as you can

309
00:15:27,811 --> 00:15:30,896
and explain you were
looking for mr. Miller;

310
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:33,399
that you were supposed
to meet him here.

311
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:36,535
Slowly now.

312
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:37,786
It'll work.

313
00:15:37,821 --> 00:15:39,038
Suppose it doesn't.

314
00:15:39,073 --> 00:15:40,906
Supposing
i can't open it.

315
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:43,409
You opened the back
door, didn't you?

316
00:15:43,444 --> 00:15:44,660
Now, stop whining.

317
00:15:44,695 --> 00:15:47,796
Do you want to
be poor again?

318
00:16:23,832 --> 00:16:25,701
It clicked.

319
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:29,455
Open it, stupid.

320
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:47,973
Hold it out there!

321
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:49,858
Who is it?

322
00:16:49,893 --> 00:16:52,978
Jonathan west, sir,
the ventriloquist.

323
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:56,115
Mr. Miller told me
to meet him after closing.

324
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,366
Oh, yeah?

325
00:16:57,401 --> 00:16:57,983
Yes, sir.

326
00:16:58,018 --> 00:17:00,486
Have you met caesar, sir?

327
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:04,873
Caesar, can you say hello to the
nice gentleman from in there?

328
00:17:04,908 --> 00:17:07,376
What are you,
the house dick?

329
00:17:07,411 --> 00:17:09,244
No, i'm the night watchman.

330
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:11,130
Listen, with the
job you're doing

331
00:17:11,165 --> 00:17:14,249
it's a wonder the mice
haven't heisted the joint.

332
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:15,501
Caesar, that's enough.

333
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:17,386
I'm sorry, sir.

334
00:17:17,421 --> 00:17:19,254
I'm afraid he's a born comic.

335
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:21,757
Sure, i remember you now
from the other day.

336
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:23,642
You were
auditioning.

337
00:17:23,677 --> 00:17:25,511
Mr. Miller went home.

338
00:17:25,546 --> 00:17:28,013
He left about 45 minutes ago.

339
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:29,898
Really? I'm sorry.

340
00:17:29,933 --> 00:17:31,767
You should have
caught our act.

341
00:17:31,802 --> 00:17:34,269
We're very big
in dublin.

342
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:35,521
Never mind, caesar.

343
00:17:35,556 --> 00:17:37,406
Well, thank you very much, sir.

344
00:17:37,441 --> 00:17:39,274
I won't be keeping you.

345
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:40,526
Good night.

346
00:17:59,928 --> 00:18:01,180
I'd feel better

347
00:18:01,215 --> 00:18:03,048
if the watchman
hadn't seen us.

348
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:04,933
Stop worrying.
I'll cover for you.

349
00:18:04,968 --> 00:18:06,185
I'm your alibi.

350
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,053
But if that watchman
reports me...

351
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:10,556
not you, pal... us.
We're a team.

352
00:18:10,591 --> 00:18:11,807
Sure, sure, i know that.

353
00:18:11,842 --> 00:18:13,692
But what about
that night watchman?

354
00:18:13,727 --> 00:18:14,943
Forget the watchman.

355
00:18:14,978 --> 00:18:17,946
Shut up, go to bed.

356
00:18:20,449 --> 00:18:23,569
"The carioca club
robbed last night.

357
00:18:23,604 --> 00:18:25,454
"Manager's office
looted.

358
00:18:25,489 --> 00:18:26,705
"Night watchman

359
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:29,208
providing police
with clue."

360
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:51,096
Police department, please.

361
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:57,986
I know who robbed
the carioca club last night.

362
00:19:04,743 --> 00:19:05,994
Kinda early in the day

363
00:19:06,029 --> 00:19:09,114
to be hitting the juice,
ain't it, dillinger?

364
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:12,251
You like a roof over
your head, don't you?

365
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:17,122
Now don't give me your common
thief routine again, huh?

366
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:20,626
A man has to live with himself.

367
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:25,631
Even if he lives in the gutter.

368
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:44,149
Oh, mr. West,
these two gentlemen,

369
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:47,286
they're from the
police department

370
00:19:47,321 --> 00:19:49,788
and they want
a word with you.

371
00:19:49,823 --> 00:19:51,039
Why, certainly.

372
00:19:51,074 --> 00:19:52,908
Won't you
come in please?

373
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:58,547
What could i do
for you, gentlemen?

374
00:19:58,582 --> 00:19:59,798
Well, you see...

375
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:01,667
thank you,
mrs. Cudahy.

376
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:03,552
Mr. West, i'd
like to ask you

377
00:20:03,587 --> 00:20:04,803
a few questions.

378
00:20:04,838 --> 00:20:06,672
Mrs. Cudahy,
could you wait?

379
00:20:06,707 --> 00:20:07,923
You may be
of some help.

380
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:09,174
Oh, of course.

381
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:12,311
Mr. West is one of
my favorite boarders.

382
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:16,682
I'd ask you to sit
down, gentlemen,

383
00:20:16,717 --> 00:20:18,567
but i don't have
many chairs.

384
00:20:18,602 --> 00:20:20,435
It's just a room
for one.

385
00:20:21,069 --> 00:20:22,938
Me and my friend, that is.

386
00:20:22,973 --> 00:20:24,823
But it suits me just fine.

387
00:20:24,858 --> 00:20:27,326
Mr. West, where
were you last night

388
00:20:27,361 --> 00:20:28,577
at around midnight?

389
00:20:28,612 --> 00:20:29,828
He was at home, i'm sure.

390
00:20:29,863 --> 00:20:31,697
He seldom goes out at night.

391
00:20:31,732 --> 00:20:33,198
I seldom go out at night.

392
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:35,083
Mr. West,
the desk
sergeant

393
00:20:35,118 --> 00:20:37,586
received
an anonymous
phone call

394
00:20:37,621 --> 00:20:39,454
indicating
you were not
in your room.

395
00:20:41,957 --> 00:20:44,459
We're almost always
here at night.

396
00:20:44,494 --> 00:20:45,961
You didn't go
to the carioca

397
00:20:45,996 --> 00:20:47,212
looking for anyone?

398
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:49,598
The night club?

399
00:20:49,633 --> 00:20:51,466
Oh.

400
00:20:51,501 --> 00:20:52,968
Oh, that night club.

401
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:56,104
That's a place where
we might be working soon.

402
00:20:56,139 --> 00:20:57,973
Because the night
watchman said

403
00:20:58,008 --> 00:20:59,858
that he saw
you there...

404
00:20:59,893 --> 00:21:01,727
absolutely.

405
00:21:03,612 --> 00:21:06,732
Oh, last night, you say.

406
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:10,485
Well, let me think now.

407
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:14,873
Caesar and i had dinner and...

408
00:21:14,908 --> 00:21:17,376
tell them, caesar.

409
00:21:18,627 --> 00:21:20,495
Caesar, please,
tell them.

410
00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:23,632
Tell them
i wouldn't hurt anyone.

411
00:21:23,667 --> 00:21:26,752
I mean, i didn't use a gun
or anything, did i?

412
00:21:28,003 --> 00:21:33,008
Please, caesar, tell them how we
were going to play the big time.

413
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:39,898
We're a team, you see.

414
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:44,903
You don't believe me, do you?

415
00:21:46,154 --> 00:21:48,023
Well, you
just ask him.

416
00:21:48,058 --> 00:21:49,908
You ask caesar.

417
00:21:49,943 --> 00:21:51,777
Go on, tell them.

418
00:21:51,812 --> 00:21:53,028
Tell them, caesar.

419
00:21:53,063 --> 00:21:54,279
Tell them
how you were

420
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:56,164
only trying
to help me-

421
00:21:56,199 --> 00:21:57,416
to take the
pressure off.

422
00:21:58,033 --> 00:22:00,535
I tried to find a job
and i couldn't.

423
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:02,421
Isn't that
right?

424
00:22:02,456 --> 00:22:04,923
You were trying to help me-
tell them.

425
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:08,043
The bills were piling up,
there was no food to eat,

426
00:22:08,078 --> 00:22:11,179
the rent was overdue
and you were trying to help me.

427
00:22:11,214 --> 00:22:13,048
Isn't that right, caesar?

428
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:16,184
Please tell
them, caesar.

429
00:22:16,219 --> 00:22:20,555
Tell them that you were
just trying to help me

430
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:24,309
and that i'm not
a common thief, caesar.

431
00:22:24,344 --> 00:22:25,560
Please, caesar.

432
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,318
I thought you said it was us.

433
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:38,323
Oh, caesar.

434
00:22:42,711 --> 00:22:44,579
He said we were a team.

435
00:22:44,614 --> 00:22:48,333
Mr. West, you better
come along with us now.

436
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:07,736
Such a nice man.

437
00:23:08,353 --> 00:23:10,238
He's a
no-good crook.

438
00:23:13,358 --> 00:23:14,609
Psst.

439
00:23:14,644 --> 00:23:16,495
Hey, you.

440
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:18,113
Yeah, you.

441
00:23:18,148 --> 00:23:19,998
Come over here, honey.

442
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:31,376
I know you
finked on him.

443
00:23:31,411 --> 00:23:33,011
You're a hip little kid.

444
00:23:33,046 --> 00:23:34,262
I like you.

445
00:23:34,297 --> 00:23:36,131
I knew you talked.

446
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:37,382
I knew it.

447
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:39,885
I want to ask
you something.

448
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:43,638
You're not happy living here
with your crummy aunt, are you?

449
00:23:43,673 --> 00:23:45,774
That's a stupid question.

450
00:23:46,141 --> 00:23:49,277
You'd probably like to run away
from this flea trap.

451
00:23:49,312 --> 00:23:51,029
I sure would.

452
00:23:51,064 --> 00:23:52,280
Okay...

453
00:23:52,315 --> 00:23:54,032
it's you and me, kid.

454
00:23:54,067 --> 00:23:55,650
We're a team.

455
00:23:55,685 --> 00:23:57,536
Is mr. West going to jail?

456
00:23:57,571 --> 00:24:01,039
Honey, he'll be gone
a long, long time.

457
00:24:01,156 --> 00:24:03,041
I know where
he's got the
money hidden.

458
00:24:03,076 --> 00:24:04,910
We'll go to new york.

459
00:24:04,945 --> 00:24:07,412
I'll show you the bright lights.

460
00:24:07,447 --> 00:24:08,163
What about my aunt?

461
00:24:08,198 --> 00:24:09,414
Honey...

462
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:12,050
you still got
those poison darts?

463
00:24:13,668 --> 00:24:15,554
A little girl
and a wooden doll,

464
00:24:16,171 --> 00:24:18,056
a lethal dummy
in the shape of a man.

465
00:24:18,091 --> 00:24:20,559
But everybody knows
dummies can't talk-

466
00:24:20,594 --> 00:24:23,678
unless, of course,
they learn their vocabulary

467
00:24:23,713 --> 00:24:25,564
in the twilight zone.

468
00:24:29,484 --> 00:24:31,269
And now, mr. Serling.

469
00:24:31,304 --> 00:24:34,406
Next time out, you'll share
a study in depth of human terror

470
00:24:34,441 --> 00:24:36,274
with martin landau
and john van dreelen.

471
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:38,777
You'll stay in a hotel room
of a european city

472
00:24:38,812 --> 00:24:40,662
which has been booby-trapped
with a plastic bomb.

473
00:24:40,697 --> 00:24:42,531
You'll walk around this room

474
00:24:42,566 --> 00:24:44,416
with violent death
resting on your shoulder.

475
00:24:44,451 --> 00:24:46,284
It could be anywhere-
a picture, a chair, a faucet,

476
00:24:46,918 --> 00:24:48,170
or simply the carpet
you're walking on.

477
00:24:48,205 --> 00:24:50,038
Next time out
onthe twilight zone,

478
00:24:50,073 --> 00:24:53,792
"the jeopardy room."
