1
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:12,896
You're traveling
through another dimension-

2
00:00:12,931 --> 00:00:16,016
a dimension not only of sight
and sound, but of mind,

3
00:00:16,051 --> 00:00:17,901
a journey into a wondrous land

4
00:00:17,936 --> 00:00:19,769
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

5
00:00:19,804 --> 00:00:22,272
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

6
00:00:45,463 --> 00:00:47,931
Mommy!

7
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,443
I'll get it.

8
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,815
Mommy!

9
00:01:07,417 --> 00:01:09,285
Mommy!

10
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:12,422
You're going?

11
00:01:12,457 --> 00:01:14,924
I'm just putting
my slippers on.

12
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:16,176
Mommy!

13
00:01:16,211 --> 00:01:19,295
All right, sweetheart,
i'm coming.

14
00:01:22,467 --> 00:01:23,683
Hush up, mac.

15
00:01:25,587 --> 00:01:27,303
Shh!

16
00:01:29,841 --> 00:01:31,691
What's the matter, baby?

17
00:01:32,942 --> 00:01:36,062
What'd you do, fall off?

18
00:01:36,097 --> 00:01:37,947
Come on.

19
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:43,570
Well, what'd you do,
roll underneath?

20
00:01:46,072 --> 00:01:47,323
Daddy!

21
00:01:47,358 --> 00:01:48,575
All right, honey.

22
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:49,826
I'm right here.

23
00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:51,711
Now, come on out.

24
00:01:51,746 --> 00:01:55,465
Come on, you just crawled
underneath the bed.

25
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,333
Tina.

26
00:01:59,254 --> 00:02:03,590
All right, honey,
come on, take my hand.

27
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:06,976
Come on.

28
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:09,479
What in the...?

29
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:12,599
Daddy.

30
00:02:12,634 --> 00:02:14,984
All right, just a minute.

31
00:02:16,853 --> 00:02:18,855
Chris, what is it?

32
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:20,106
I don't know.

33
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:38,258
One frightened
little girl.

34
00:02:38,293 --> 00:02:39,509
Bettina miller.

35
00:02:39,544 --> 00:02:43,880
Six years of age,
average height and build,

36
00:02:43,915 --> 00:02:45,765
light-brown hair, quite pretty.

37
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,136
Being tucked in bed
by her mother a few hours ago.

38
00:02:50,171 --> 00:02:53,890
"Ay, there's
the rub," as hamlet put it.

39
00:02:53,925 --> 00:02:57,644
For bettina miller can
be heard quite clearly,

40
00:02:57,679 --> 00:03:02,031
despite the rather curious fact
that she can't be seen at all.

41
00:03:02,066 --> 00:03:05,785
Let's say for the moment...

42
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,654
in the twilight zone.

43
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:35,648
What's the matter?

44
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:38,768
She's not here.

45
00:03:39,402 --> 00:03:40,653
What do you mean
she's not...

46
00:03:40,688 --> 00:03:41,905
look for yourself.

47
00:03:44,407 --> 00:03:46,276
Tina?

48
00:03:46,311 --> 00:03:47,527
Mommy!

49
00:03:49,279 --> 00:03:50,530
I turned on
the light.

50
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:52,415
Oh, no, no,
it's crazy.

51
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:54,918
It just sounds
as if she's...

52
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,924
mommy, pick me up.

53
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:07,797
Chris, where is she?

54
00:04:07,832 --> 00:04:10,300
I don't know.

55
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:15,438
Well, what are
we going to do?

56
00:04:15,473 --> 00:04:16,689
I don't know, honey,

57
00:04:16,724 --> 00:04:18,558
but we're not
going to panic.

58
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:27,951
Tina!

59
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:01,100
Shut up, mac!

60
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:06,489
Bill?

61
00:05:06,524 --> 00:05:07,740
Bill, this is chris.

62
00:05:07,775 --> 00:05:10,243
Can you come over
to the house right away?

63
00:05:11,494 --> 00:05:13,997
I'm sorry, bill,
this is an emergency.

64
00:05:14,032 --> 00:05:16,499
Tina has disappeared.

65
00:05:17,116 --> 00:05:18,368
No, no, she hasn't
been kidnapped.

66
00:05:19,002 --> 00:05:21,504
Tina is... tina is here...

67
00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:23,373
but she's not... here.

68
00:05:23,408 --> 00:05:27,760
Bill, for crying out loud,
will you get over here?!

69
00:05:27,795 --> 00:05:29,012
Hurry.

70
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:43,393
Shouldn't we...

71
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:46,529
wake her?

72
00:05:46,564 --> 00:05:48,398
Bill's coming
over, honey.

73
00:05:48,433 --> 00:05:49,649
Bill?

74
00:05:49,684 --> 00:05:50,900
Well, he's
a physicist.

75
00:05:50,935 --> 00:05:52,151
Maybe he can
help us out.

76
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:55,288
I don't know,
i couldn't think
of anything else.

77
00:05:55,323 --> 00:05:57,156
Oh, god, where is she?

78
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:03,413
Where is she?

79
00:06:03,448 --> 00:06:05,915
Listen, i'd better go
and let that dog in

80
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:08,418
before he wakes up
the whole neighborhood.

81
00:06:09,052 --> 00:06:10,920
Honey, i'm going to check
underneath the house.

82
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:24,067
Mac, come here.

83
00:06:24,102 --> 00:06:25,435
Come here!

84
00:06:26,721 --> 00:06:28,571
Come here, mac.

85
00:06:37,982 --> 00:06:39,449
He's gone.

86
00:06:39,484 --> 00:06:40,700
No...

87
00:06:46,956 --> 00:06:48,841
they're not
under the house.

88
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:09,612
What's wrong, chris?

89
00:07:09,647 --> 00:07:12,115
Listen, tina woke us
up with her crying.

90
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:13,866
So i went into
the bedroom

91
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:15,735
and i couldn't
find her.

92
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:16,986
I let the dog in

93
00:07:17,021 --> 00:07:18,871
and he went
under the bed

94
00:07:18,906 --> 00:07:20,123
and he's gone, too.

95
00:07:32,635 --> 00:07:33,886
Let's move the bed.

96
00:07:33,921 --> 00:07:35,138
Oh, bill, where is she?

97
00:07:35,173 --> 00:07:36,389
I'm about to
lose my mind.

98
00:07:37,006 --> 00:07:38,257
Hold on, ruth.

99
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:40,760
She's breathing
normally, she
must be all right.

100
00:07:40,795 --> 00:07:42,011
Now wait a second.

101
00:07:42,046 --> 00:07:43,896
We'd better mark
where the legs go.

102
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,650
Here.

103
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:14,043
Still there?

104
00:08:14,078 --> 00:08:15,928
Yes.

105
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,682
Now, you've felt
all over here?

106
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:20,933
Yes.

107
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:22,185
And?

108
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,053
Nothing.

109
00:08:24,088 --> 00:08:25,304
Okay.

110
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:32,812
What are you
looking for?

111
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:37,200
The opening maybe.

112
00:08:37,235 --> 00:08:39,702
The opening
to what?

113
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:44,707
I'm not sure, ruth.

114
00:08:45,993 --> 00:08:47,827
You're...!

115
00:08:47,862 --> 00:08:50,329
It's as if you
were going to
step on her.

116
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:52,832
No.

117
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:01,591
Are you sure

118
00:09:01,626 --> 00:09:03,476
that you felt
all over here?

119
00:09:03,511 --> 00:09:04,727
Well, maybe not
every single inch!

120
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:06,596
Take it easy.
Take it easy.

121
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:10,349
I just don't
get it.

122
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:12,235
Now, wait.

123
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:14,103
Now, wait.

124
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:32,505
What is it?

125
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:33,756
The opening.

126
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:35,007
The...?

127
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:36,876
To what?

128
00:09:38,796 --> 00:09:40,630
I think...

129
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:43,766
to another dimension.

130
00:09:43,801 --> 00:09:46,886
Another what?

131
00:09:46,921 --> 00:09:48,771
I don't know
if i'm right,

132
00:09:48,806 --> 00:09:52,525
but i can't think
of anything else.

133
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,279
Tina must have
fallen out of bed,

134
00:09:56,314 --> 00:10:00,650
accidentally rolled
under it and...

135
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:06,289
...gone through.

136
00:10:06,324 --> 00:10:08,157
And that's where
mac went, too, huh?

137
00:10:08,192 --> 00:10:10,042
Probably
sensed it.

138
00:10:10,077 --> 00:10:13,162
Animals are sharper
about these things
than humans.

139
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:16,299
He knew she was
in there and...

140
00:10:16,334 --> 00:10:18,801
went after her.

141
00:10:18,836 --> 00:10:20,052
Then why can't we?

142
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:21,304
No.

143
00:10:21,339 --> 00:10:23,806
We don't know
what's in there.

144
00:10:23,841 --> 00:10:25,057
My daughter's in there!

145
00:10:25,675 --> 00:10:26,926
I know that, ruth,
but we can't.

146
00:10:26,961 --> 00:10:29,428
Bill, for crying out loud,
she's right here!

147
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:31,314
All we have to
do is reach in

148
00:10:31,349 --> 00:10:31,931
and pull her out.

149
00:10:31,966 --> 00:10:33,816
If it was as
simple as that,

150
00:10:33,851 --> 00:10:36,936
why hasn't mac
found her yet?

151
00:10:36,971 --> 00:10:38,187
Nope...

152
00:10:38,222 --> 00:10:40,690
if it's what i think,

153
00:10:40,725 --> 00:10:45,695
it's kind of a...
gap opening

154
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:48,197
on another
dimension.

155
00:10:48,232 --> 00:10:50,700
Probably the
fourth dimension.

156
00:10:50,735 --> 00:10:53,202
It just wouldn't
be laid out

157
00:10:53,237 --> 00:10:55,087
like our
world, chris.

158
00:10:55,122 --> 00:10:58,207
Well, there must be
something we can do.

159
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:01,961
Have you got a...
a crayon,

160
00:11:01,996 --> 00:11:03,846
a piece of chalk?

161
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:10,720
Here.

162
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:15,725
All right, now let's just see
how big this thing is.

163
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,611
Bill, i just don't
understand...

164
00:11:18,646 --> 00:11:21,113
understand it.

165
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:30,489
The third dimension
is... just a... step

166
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:31,741
below the fourth, chris.

167
00:11:31,776 --> 00:11:36,128
It's a big step, granted,
but it's just one step.

168
00:11:36,163 --> 00:11:38,631
Now, every point in our space

169
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:42,752
is part of a
perpendicular
line in the...

170
00:11:42,787 --> 00:11:45,254
fourth dimension.

171
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:47,139
So?

172
00:11:47,174 --> 00:11:54,647
So... although all
the lines forming
the fourth dimension

173
00:11:54,682 --> 00:11:58,401
are perpendicular
to every point
in the third,

174
00:11:58,436 --> 00:12:05,274
they're not
necessarily
parallel to us.

175
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:10,279
But if enough
of the lines
are parallel

176
00:12:10,314 --> 00:12:14,033
in both dimensions
in a given area,

177
00:12:14,068 --> 00:12:17,787
it might create... an opening.

178
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:22,792
What, has this opening
always been here?

179
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:25,294
It might have been.

180
00:12:30,933 --> 00:12:32,802
I doubt it, though.

181
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:39,692
Believe me, i'm
no expert on this.

182
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:45,948
Who is?

183
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:52,204
But i suspect that...

184
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:57,209
junctures
between dimensions

185
00:12:57,244 --> 00:13:00,329
are freaks of nature
that happen...

186
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,968
who knows how often.

187
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:12,224
Rarely, i'd say.

188
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:17,847
I hope.

189
00:13:20,983 --> 00:13:22,234
There it is.

190
00:13:35,498 --> 00:13:36,749
Shh.

191
00:13:36,784 --> 00:13:38,617
What's
the matter?

192
00:13:39,869 --> 00:13:42,371
I can't hear
her anymore.

193
00:13:43,005 --> 00:13:44,256
What?

194
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,759
Oh, no!

195
00:13:46,794 --> 00:13:48,627
Tina!

196
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:51,130
Tina!

197
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:12,568
Hold it down.

198
00:14:18,207 --> 00:14:20,075
Start moving around.

199
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,961
Huh?

200
00:14:21,996 --> 00:14:23,829
Move around.
Move around.

201
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:41,347
Shh!

202
00:14:53,777 --> 00:14:56,745
Oh, what in
heaven's name...

203
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:57,997
start looking
for her.

204
00:14:58,032 --> 00:14:59,248
Where?

205
00:14:59,283 --> 00:15:01,116
Anywhere-
the whole house.

206
00:16:34,843 --> 00:16:36,712
In here!

207
00:16:47,391 --> 00:16:49,858
I want my dolly.

208
00:16:49,893 --> 00:16:51,727
What is this?!

209
00:16:51,762 --> 00:16:53,979
Chris, i told you what i think.

210
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:56,482
But if she went into
this other dimension

211
00:16:56,517 --> 00:16:57,733
in the bedroom, and if
she's still asleep,

212
00:16:57,768 --> 00:16:59,618
then what is she
doing here?

213
00:16:59,653 --> 00:17:02,121
Chris...

214
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:05,991
if she's beyond our world,

215
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:08,494
her movements might seem to us

216
00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:10,996
to be coming from
all over the place.

217
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:17,886
Actually, she might be
just turning in her sleep.

218
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:25,394
Call the dog.

219
00:17:25,429 --> 00:17:26,011
Huh?

220
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:28,013
Call the
dog, hurry.

221
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:29,264
Mac.

222
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:30,516
Here, mac.

223
00:17:32,436 --> 00:17:34,269
Come on, boy.

224
00:17:35,189 --> 00:17:37,022
That's it, that's a boy.

225
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:38,907
Mac...

226
00:17:38,942 --> 00:17:42,411
where are you
taking me, mac?

227
00:17:42,446 --> 00:17:44,279
Mac, don't.

228
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:46,782
Tell her to go with the dog.

229
00:17:46,817 --> 00:17:48,033
Go on.

230
00:17:49,918 --> 00:17:51,170
Tina!

231
00:17:51,205 --> 00:17:53,038
Mommy!

232
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:55,541
Go with mac, baby.

233
00:17:55,576 --> 00:17:56,792
Go with him.

234
00:17:56,827 --> 00:17:58,677
Where are you?

235
00:17:58,712 --> 00:18:00,546
I'm here, baby.

236
00:18:00,581 --> 00:18:02,431
Never mind.

237
00:18:02,466 --> 00:18:05,551
Just tell her to go
with the dog- hurry!

238
00:18:05,586 --> 00:18:09,938
Sweetie, go with
mac, right away.

239
00:18:09,973 --> 00:18:13,692
Will he take me
where you are?

240
00:18:13,727 --> 00:18:16,195
Yes, baby,
he will.

241
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:19,064
All right, mommy.

242
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:20,315
Let's go.

243
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:28,457
Call the dog again.

244
00:18:28,492 --> 00:18:32,828
Mac, here, boy, here.

245
00:18:32,863 --> 00:18:34,079
Oh, bill,
can't we try...

246
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:35,330
it'll have
to be the dog.

247
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:37,216
We can't take the chance
of going in there.

248
00:18:37,251 --> 00:18:39,084
Mac, here, boy!

249
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:40,969
Here, mac!

250
00:18:42,256 --> 00:18:42,838
Hold it.

251
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,592
He's doing it.

252
00:18:46,627 --> 00:18:48,477
Man, what a mutt.

253
00:18:48,512 --> 00:18:49,728
Come on, boy.

254
00:18:49,763 --> 00:18:52,231
Come on, mac,
here, boy.

255
00:18:52,266 --> 00:18:54,099
Tina!

256
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:55,984
Mommy!

257
00:18:56,019 --> 00:18:57,853
Come on, mac.

258
00:18:57,888 --> 00:19:00,989
Come on out, boy.

259
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:05,360
Tina!

260
00:19:07,281 --> 00:19:09,748
Mac, bring her out!

261
00:19:09,783 --> 00:19:12,251
Daddy,
where are you?

262
00:19:12,286 --> 00:19:13,502
We're here, baby!

263
00:19:13,537 --> 00:19:16,622
We're here.
We're right here!

264
00:19:16,657 --> 00:19:19,124
I can't see you.

265
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:21,009
Mac, bring her out.

266
00:19:21,044 --> 00:19:24,129
Why doesn't
he do it?

267
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:25,380
Maybe he can't.

268
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:26,014
No!

269
00:19:26,049 --> 00:19:28,517
Tina.

270
00:19:28,552 --> 00:19:29,768
Tina, take my hand.

271
00:19:29,803 --> 00:19:31,637
Chris, don't do it.

272
00:19:31,672 --> 00:19:33,021
My hand, honey.

273
00:19:33,056 --> 00:19:34,890
Take ahold of it.

274
00:19:34,925 --> 00:19:36,141
Here.

275
00:19:37,392 --> 00:19:38,644
Here.

276
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:41,647
I can't see
it, daddy.

277
00:19:41,682 --> 00:19:43,532
Here, honey.

278
00:19:43,567 --> 00:19:44,783
Chris!

279
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:49,538
Can you hear me?

280
00:19:49,573 --> 00:19:52,658
We're right here, pal.
Don't move.

281
00:19:52,693 --> 00:19:53,909
I've got to.

282
00:19:53,944 --> 00:19:54,543
Don't move
an inch.

283
00:19:54,578 --> 00:19:57,045
I've got to find her.

284
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,914
Let her come
to you, chris.

285
00:19:58,949 --> 00:20:00,799
Call her.

286
00:20:00,834 --> 00:20:02,050
Tina.

287
00:20:04,553 --> 00:20:07,673
Daddy, where are you?

288
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:09,558
I'm right here.

289
00:20:09,593 --> 00:20:12,060
Come to the sound of my voice.

290
00:20:12,095 --> 00:20:13,929
That might
not work, chris.

291
00:20:13,964 --> 00:20:17,683
Get mac to bring her
to you and hurry.

292
00:20:17,718 --> 00:20:19,568
Tina?

293
00:20:19,603 --> 00:20:22,070
Where are
you, daddy?

294
00:20:22,105 --> 00:20:23,322
I'm right here, baby.

295
00:20:23,357 --> 00:20:26,942
Is-is...
is mac with you?

296
00:20:26,977 --> 00:20:30,696
Yes, but where are you?

297
00:20:30,731 --> 00:20:32,581
I'm here, baby!

298
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:36,335
Grab onto mac's collar.

299
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:37,586
You hear me?

300
00:20:39,454 --> 00:20:40,706
Hurry up, chris.

301
00:20:41,957 --> 00:20:44,459
Grab onto his collar.

302
00:20:44,494 --> 00:20:46,345
You got it?

303
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,596
Yes.

304
00:20:47,631 --> 00:20:50,098
Get a good grip.

305
00:20:50,133 --> 00:20:52,601
Yes, daddy,
but...

306
00:20:52,636 --> 00:20:54,469
don't let go.

307
00:20:54,504 --> 00:20:56,355
Mac.

308
00:20:58,258 --> 00:20:59,474
Here, boy!

309
00:21:01,395 --> 00:21:02,611
Bring her here.

310
00:21:02,646 --> 00:21:03,862
Daddy...

311
00:21:04,479 --> 00:21:06,365
hold on to
him tight.

312
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,233
Don't let go.

313
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:11,370
I won't, but where
are you, daddy?

314
00:21:11,405 --> 00:21:13,872
You'll be with me
in a minute, honey.

315
00:21:13,907 --> 00:21:15,123
Now just hang on.

316
00:21:15,158 --> 00:21:16,375
Come on, mac.

317
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:18,243
Come on, bring her here.

318
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:21,380
Is he bringing you, tina?

319
00:21:21,415 --> 00:21:22,631
Yes.

320
00:21:23,248 --> 00:21:25,133
All right, hang on
tight, sweetheart.

321
00:21:25,168 --> 00:21:27,002
Don't let go.

322
00:21:27,037 --> 00:21:30,756
I won't, but where
are you, daddy?

323
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:33,258
You'll be with me
in a minute, honey.

324
00:21:33,293 --> 00:21:35,143
Now just hang on tight.

325
00:21:36,645 --> 00:21:37,896
Come on, boy.

326
00:21:37,931 --> 00:21:39,765
Mac, bring
her to me.

327
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,016
Come on, mac.

328
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:44,269
Hurry, chris!

329
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:46,772
That's a boy. Attaboy.

330
00:21:46,807 --> 00:21:49,274
Come on.

331
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:50,525
Can you see her?

332
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,662
I don't know.

333
00:21:56,164 --> 00:21:57,416
Wait a minute.

334
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:01,787
Yes.

335
00:22:01,822 --> 00:22:03,038
Here, boy.

336
00:22:03,073 --> 00:22:04,923
Come on, boy.

337
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:06,792
That's right.

338
00:22:06,827 --> 00:22:09,294
Bring her
to me.

339
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:11,179
That's right.

340
00:22:11,214 --> 00:22:13,048
Come closer now.

341
00:22:13,682 --> 00:22:16,935
Okay, i got him!

342
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:18,804
I got tina!

343
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:20,689
All right, now hold on...
hold on tight.

344
00:22:20,724 --> 00:22:22,557
You got a good grip?

345
00:22:22,592 --> 00:22:23,191
I mean a good one.

346
00:22:23,226 --> 00:22:25,060
Yeah, but what are
you going to do?

347
00:22:27,195 --> 00:22:27,946
Tina!

348
00:22:27,981 --> 00:22:29,197
Mommy. Mommy.

349
00:22:29,232 --> 00:22:30,449
Oh, darling.

350
00:22:30,484 --> 00:22:31,700
She's fine.

351
00:22:31,735 --> 00:22:34,202
Oh, i got to get her
out of this room.

352
00:22:34,237 --> 00:22:36,705
Mommy! Mommy!

353
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,573
Oh, man.

354
00:22:38,608 --> 00:22:40,459
What happened?

355
00:22:40,494 --> 00:22:42,327
I pulled you out.

356
00:22:42,362 --> 00:22:45,464
How could you see me?

357
00:22:45,499 --> 00:22:47,332
Half of you
was still here.

358
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:48,583
You mean to say

359
00:22:48,618 --> 00:22:50,469
you had hold of me
all this time?

360
00:22:50,504 --> 00:22:51,720
That's right.

361
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:55,474
Oh, bill.

362
00:22:55,509 --> 00:22:57,976
You know, i didn't
even feel you.

363
00:22:58,011 --> 00:23:00,479
Say, listen, why didn't you
want me to reach in there?

364
00:23:00,514 --> 00:23:02,981
And how come i kept
telling you to hurry?

365
00:23:03,016 --> 00:23:04,232
Yeah.

366
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:12,357
That's why.

367
00:23:12,392 --> 00:23:15,494
It was closing up
all the time you
were in there.

368
00:23:15,529 --> 00:23:16,745
Another few seconds

369
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:19,865
and half of you would have
been here and the other half...

370
00:23:32,377 --> 00:23:34,262
the other half, where?

371
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,382
The fourth dimension, the fifth?

372
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:38,633
Perhaps.

373
00:23:38,668 --> 00:23:41,136
They never found the answer.

374
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:43,638
Despite a battery of
research physicists equipped

375
00:23:43,673 --> 00:23:46,775
with every device known to man-
electronic and otherwise-

376
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:49,895
no result was ever achieved.

377
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:52,397
Except perhaps
a little more respect for

378
00:23:52,432 --> 00:23:54,282
and uncertainty about

379
00:23:54,317 --> 00:23:58,653
the mechanisms of
the twilight zone.

380
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:04,709
Rod serling, creator
ofthe twilight zone,

381
00:24:04,744 --> 00:24:09,080
will tell you about next week's
story after this message.

382
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:11,817
And now mr. Serling.

383
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:13,635
Next week we again borrow

384
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:16,755
from the considerable talents
of charles beaumont,

385
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:19,891
and we take a fast track
on the wild side.

386
00:24:19,926 --> 00:24:22,394
Picture if you will a man
who wakes up in a strange world,

387
00:24:23,011 --> 00:24:24,262
knows everyone,
knows every place,

388
00:24:24,297 --> 00:24:25,514
feels every much at home.

389
00:24:25,549 --> 00:24:27,399
The strangeness comes
from the fact

390
00:24:27,434 --> 00:24:29,267
that no one knows him.

391
00:24:29,302 --> 00:24:31,770
Try this on for size
on the nexttwilight zone.

392
00:24:31,805 --> 00:24:34,906
It's called
"person or persons unknown."

393
00:24:34,941 --> 00:24:38,026
Habit is something you do
when pleasure is gone,

394
00:24:38,061 --> 00:24:39,911
and certainly this is not
the way to smoke.

395
00:24:39,946 --> 00:24:41,780
I prefer to smoke chesterfields

396
00:24:41,815 --> 00:24:44,282
and get the rich taste
of 21 great tobaccos.

397
00:24:44,317 --> 00:24:46,785
Blended mild, not filtered mild.

398
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:49,287
Smoke for pleasure,
smoke chesterfields.

399
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,406
This is james arness.

400
00:25:24,441 --> 00:25:27,542
You know it's only a short hop
fromthe twilight zone

401
00:25:27,577 --> 00:25:29,411
to dodge city andgunsmoke,

402
00:25:29,446 --> 00:25:31,913
saturday nights
over most of these stations.
