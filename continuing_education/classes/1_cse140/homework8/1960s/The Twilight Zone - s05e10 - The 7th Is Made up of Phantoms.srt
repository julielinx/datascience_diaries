1
00:00:06,606 --> 00:00:09,726
You unlock this door
with the key of imagination.

2
00:00:09,761 --> 00:00:11,611
Beyond it
is another dimension-

3
00:00:11,646 --> 00:00:14,114
a dimension of sound,

4
00:00:14,149 --> 00:00:15,982
a dimension of sight,

5
00:00:16,017 --> 00:00:18,485
a dimension of mind.

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,987
You're moving into a land
of both shadow and substance,

7
00:00:21,022 --> 00:00:22,872
of things and ideas.

8
00:00:22,907 --> 00:00:27,243
You've just crossed over
into the twilight zone.

9
00:00:58,024 --> 00:00:59,909
Still burning.

10
00:00:59,944 --> 00:01:01,161
How long,
you figure?

11
00:01:01,196 --> 00:01:03,913
Three... four hours at the most.

12
00:01:03,948 --> 00:01:05,665
Any idea how many?

13
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,916
My guess is

14
00:01:06,951 --> 00:01:08,785
if general custer's
really looking

15
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,670
for the sioux,
he's going to have

16
00:01:10,705 --> 00:01:11,921
his britches
full of 'em

17
00:01:11,956 --> 00:01:13,173
before the
sun goes down.

18
00:01:13,208 --> 00:01:14,424
Is that the junction
over there?

19
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:16,292
Bighorn and the
little bighorn-

20
00:01:16,327 --> 00:01:18,178
that's where
they converge.

21
00:01:18,213 --> 00:01:21,431
That'd put them in at the ford,
about four miles up.

22
00:01:21,466 --> 00:01:23,299
That's where he's thinking
about crossing.

23
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:25,802
Them sioux...

24
00:01:25,837 --> 00:01:27,687
wonder where
they are now?

25
00:01:27,722 --> 00:01:29,939
I wouldn't be too impatient,
mr. Two stripes.

26
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:34,310
We can go on back
and tell your general custer

27
00:01:34,345 --> 00:01:36,563
this indian trail
is just as fresh as ever.

28
00:01:36,598 --> 00:01:38,448
Little too fresh
for my pay.

29
00:01:43,238 --> 00:01:45,071
Hey, those were shots,
weren't they?

30
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:46,956
Yeah.

31
00:01:46,991 --> 00:01:48,208
Hey, tiger!
Whoa, easy.

32
00:01:48,243 --> 00:01:50,076
These are just
maneuvers.

33
00:01:50,111 --> 00:01:51,828
Everybody starts
getting trigger-happy,

34
00:01:51,863 --> 00:01:53,713
it's going to turn
into a real war.

35
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:56,216
Hunting season, huh, maybe?

36
00:01:56,251 --> 00:01:58,084
How about that, mccluskey?

37
00:01:58,119 --> 00:01:59,969
How'd you like to go
hunting some buffalo?

38
00:02:00,004 --> 00:02:00,837
Let's, uh, go
have a look.

39
00:02:00,872 --> 00:02:03,973
Well, if it's the enemy,
i'm giving up.

40
00:02:04,008 --> 00:02:06,092
They can take me
prisoner of war,

41
00:02:06,127 --> 00:02:07,343
and i'll sit out the
rest of the games.

42
00:02:07,378 --> 00:02:07,977
I'm getting
mighty hot

43
00:02:08,012 --> 00:02:10,480
in that portable oven
we're driving.

44
00:02:10,515 --> 00:02:12,348
Mccluskey, i'm
surprised at you.

45
00:02:12,383 --> 00:02:14,234
The old man, the
sergeant here,

46
00:02:14,269 --> 00:02:16,102
we've had our
eyes on you, son.

47
00:02:16,137 --> 00:02:17,353
We was thinking
of recommending
you for o.c.s.,

48
00:02:17,388 --> 00:02:18,605
wasn't we, sarge?

49
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,107
Other than the
fact that you read
a map upside down

50
00:02:21,142 --> 00:02:24,244
and, uh, couldn't navigate
a plow across a ballroom,

51
00:02:24,279 --> 00:02:26,746
we think you've got
a lot of potential.

52
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:39,008
It's a wigwam.

53
00:02:39,043 --> 00:02:40,877
An honest-to-pete
wigwam.

54
00:02:40,912 --> 00:02:42,762
Oh, there's
a million men

55
00:02:42,797 --> 00:02:44,013
in national guard,

56
00:02:44,048 --> 00:02:45,882
but it's just my luck
to ride around in a tank

57
00:02:45,917 --> 00:02:48,384
with the last of the
red-hot eagle scouts.

58
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:49,636
You're right,
mccluskey,

59
00:02:49,671 --> 00:02:51,521
that's a wigwam.

60
00:02:51,556 --> 00:02:52,772
Now, why does that
make you so happy?

61
00:02:52,807 --> 00:02:57,143
Well, it's interesting.

62
00:02:57,178 --> 00:02:59,646
Right over there's
the junction of the bighorn

63
00:02:59,681 --> 00:03:00,897
and little bighorn
rivers.

64
00:03:00,932 --> 00:03:03,399
Not far from there
is where custer fought.

65
00:03:03,434 --> 00:03:07,153
Yeah, custer?
Custer who?

66
00:03:07,188 --> 00:03:08,404
General custer.

67
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:09,656
That's where
the 7th cavalry

68
00:03:09,691 --> 00:03:12,158
fought the sioux indians.

69
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,806
Hey, take a look at that.

70
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:31,177
Hey, where'd
you get that?

71
00:03:32,428 --> 00:03:33,680
7th cavalry.

72
00:03:33,715 --> 00:03:35,565
How do you figure,
sarge?

73
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,433
Well, i figure it's
in pretty good shape,

74
00:03:37,468 --> 00:03:39,319
considering it's been
laying around here

75
00:03:39,354 --> 00:03:41,187
for about 80 years,
wouldn't you say?

76
00:03:41,222 --> 00:03:43,690
You know, there must
be a lot of ghosts

77
00:03:43,725 --> 00:03:45,575
running around
a place like this.

78
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:47,443
Oh, yeah, ghosts,
sure, mm-hmm.

79
00:03:47,478 --> 00:03:49,946
Yeah, mccluskey's
got it right.

80
00:03:49,981 --> 00:03:53,082
Somewhere along this river
they fought a pretty big battle.

81
00:03:53,117 --> 00:03:58,087
Custer and 200-odd men
against 2,000 sioux, probably.

82
00:03:58,122 --> 00:03:59,339
Yeah, custer's last stand.

83
00:03:59,374 --> 00:04:01,207
Didn't you ever hear of it,
langsford?

84
00:04:01,242 --> 00:04:03,960
L-i heard of it, mccluskey.

85
00:04:03,995 --> 00:04:05,595
I heard of it.

86
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:08,214
Why don't you boys
get you a job in a museum?

87
00:04:08,249 --> 00:04:10,099
Maybe they'd send you
out here on an expedition.

88
00:04:10,134 --> 00:04:11,968
Then you can run around
and pick up some antiques.

89
00:04:12,003 --> 00:04:13,219
I thought this was
supposed to be

90
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:15,104
a motorized patrol,
sarge,

91
00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:16,356
and i thought
that we were

92
00:04:16,391 --> 00:04:18,224
supposed to be
involved in some war games.

93
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:20,109
Now, personally,
i don't care.

94
00:04:20,144 --> 00:04:21,361
I'd just as soon be out
reconnoitering

95
00:04:21,396 --> 00:04:23,229
in some dark saloon
someplace

96
00:04:23,264 --> 00:04:26,983
or, uh, maybe hanging
around the y.w.c.a.

97
00:04:27,018 --> 00:04:30,119
In a pinch, i'd settle for
something tall and cold and...

98
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:46,002
d-don't you think
we'd better get back

99
00:04:46,037 --> 00:04:49,138
and find the c.p.?

100
00:04:49,173 --> 00:04:50,390
Shoot, what's the matter,
mccluskey?

101
00:04:50,425 --> 00:04:51,641
Don't you want
to hang around

102
00:04:51,676 --> 00:04:54,143
and wait
for the union cavalry, huh?

103
00:04:54,178 --> 00:04:55,395
So, this is where they fought,
huh, sarge?

104
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,646
Right around here?

105
00:04:56,681 --> 00:04:59,766
Yeah, yeah, it was
around here someplace.

106
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:01,267
You know, when i was a kid,

107
00:05:01,302 --> 00:05:03,770
i read about everything
that was ever written on it.

108
00:05:03,805 --> 00:05:05,021
Custer and the 7th

109
00:05:05,056 --> 00:05:07,523
were an advance guard
for a general named terry.

110
00:05:07,558 --> 00:05:10,660
Last thing anybody
ever heard from custer
was that he was

111
00:05:10,695 --> 00:05:13,162
dividing his regiment
into three parties.

112
00:05:13,197 --> 00:05:15,665
He was planning on surrounding

113
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,167
what he thought
was a small bunch of indians.

114
00:05:18,202 --> 00:05:20,787
And, uh, see,
captain benteen took

115
00:05:20,822 --> 00:05:22,038
three troops and
he went south;

116
00:05:22,073 --> 00:05:23,923
and major reno, he
crossed the river

117
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:26,426
and he followed
an indian trail;

118
00:05:26,461 --> 00:05:28,928
and custer went
right up the middle

119
00:05:28,963 --> 00:05:32,048
and rode right into 'em,
and he was slaughtered.

120
00:05:32,682 --> 00:05:34,684
1876.

121
00:05:34,719 --> 00:05:36,302
That was the year.

122
00:05:37,186 --> 00:05:38,805
Ah, now, come on,
now, sarge.

123
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,307
Somebody planted this thing
around here for a gag.

124
00:05:41,342 --> 00:05:45,061
That canteen's
not 80 years old.

125
00:05:45,096 --> 00:05:46,946
Well, shoot,
it's practically new.

126
00:05:46,981 --> 00:05:49,449
Either that, or, uh,
we've had some...

127
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:02,712
come on, let's get out of here.

128
00:06:06,582 --> 00:06:09,085
Come on, you guys.
Let's get back to the tank.

129
00:06:24,635 --> 00:06:25,852
What was that?

130
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:33,242
That was the wind.

131
00:06:33,277 --> 00:06:36,996
Yeah... the wind.

132
00:06:37,031 --> 00:06:38,865
Yeah, that's what it was,
the wind.

133
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:42,368
June 25, 1964.

134
00:06:42,403 --> 00:06:46,756
Or if you prefer,
june 25, 1876.

135
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:49,258
The cast of characters
in order of their appearance:

136
00:06:49,293 --> 00:06:51,761
A patrol
of general custer's cavalry

137
00:06:51,796 --> 00:06:55,765
and a patrol of national
guardsmen on a maneuver.

138
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,267
Past and present
are about to collide head-on

139
00:06:58,302 --> 00:07:01,387
as they are wont to do
in a very special bivouac area

140
00:07:01,422 --> 00:07:04,524
known as... the twilight zone.

141
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:33,302
All units reported
in now, finnegan?

142
00:07:33,337 --> 00:07:33,920
Yes, lieutenant.

143
00:07:33,955 --> 00:07:35,805
Good.

144
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:44,564
Bluebird 7,
come in, over.

145
00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:45,314
Bluebird...

146
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:47,817
connors, the captain
wants to see you

147
00:07:47,852 --> 00:07:49,068
in his tent
right away,

148
00:07:49,103 --> 00:07:50,319
and it sounded
like to me

149
00:07:50,354 --> 00:07:53,439
it was a little more
than an invitation.

150
00:08:02,832 --> 00:08:04,700
Captain?

151
00:08:04,735 --> 00:08:06,586
How nice of you
to come back.

152
00:08:06,621 --> 00:08:08,454
Did you happen to bring
the tank with you?

153
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:10,339
Sir?
You were
gone so long,

154
00:08:10,374 --> 00:08:11,591
i thought maybe you
drove it out to a lot

155
00:08:11,626 --> 00:08:12,842
and traded it for
a convertible.

156
00:08:12,877 --> 00:08:14,710
Well, sir, we got
a little, uh, hung up

157
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:15,962
down by the riverbed
there.

158
00:08:15,997 --> 00:08:17,847
Hung up by what?

159
00:08:17,882 --> 00:08:19,098
The blue team
went north of us,

160
00:08:19,133 --> 00:08:20,349
you went south.

161
00:08:20,384 --> 00:08:22,852
For a guy with as much
regular army as you've got,

162
00:08:22,887 --> 00:08:25,972
you've played this one bonehead
from start to finish.

163
00:08:26,007 --> 00:08:28,357
If there'd been
an umpire around,

164
00:08:28,392 --> 00:08:30,226
you'd have your tank
crossed off and your men.

165
00:08:30,261 --> 00:08:30,860
I'm sorry, sir,

166
00:08:30,895 --> 00:08:32,728
but we, uh, heard
some rifle fire down there

167
00:08:32,763 --> 00:08:33,980
and we went to check it out.

168
00:08:34,015 --> 00:08:36,482
Rifle fire?

169
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:37,984
According to the lieutenant,

170
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:39,235
you were down at
the little bighorn-

171
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:41,120
40 miles away from where
you were supposed to be.

172
00:08:41,155 --> 00:08:42,371
How'd you hear
rifle fire?

173
00:08:42,406 --> 00:08:43,623
That's just it, sir.

174
00:08:43,658 --> 00:08:46,626
We never found out where it
came from or who it came from.

175
00:08:46,661 --> 00:08:49,745
I think you guys must have had
a bottle in that tank.

176
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,747
Tomorrow, you'll
take your tank
and head up here-

177
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:52,999
rosebud creek.

178
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:56,252
Follow the creek
for about 15 miles.

179
00:08:56,287 --> 00:08:58,254
We figure the blue team
must've moved across to...

180
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:01,390
what's the matter with you,
connors?

181
00:09:01,425 --> 00:09:02,642
Are you hung over?

182
00:09:02,677 --> 00:09:05,144
No, sir. No, sir,
nothing like that at all, sir.

183
00:09:05,179 --> 00:09:07,013
But that
rosebud creek-

184
00:09:07,048 --> 00:09:08,264
that's custer's route.

185
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:09,265
When he left
the yellowstone river,

186
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,516
he went with a major reno,

187
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:12,401
and reno followed a trail
along that creek.

188
00:09:12,436 --> 00:09:14,904
Sergeant, let's
synchronize, shall we?

189
00:09:14,939 --> 00:09:17,406
My watch says
23:20 hours.

190
00:09:17,441 --> 00:09:19,275
My calendar says 1964.

191
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:21,160
If you've got a big
thing for these indians,

192
00:09:21,195 --> 00:09:22,411
you got here a little
late in the day.

193
00:09:22,446 --> 00:09:24,280
Captain, i want
to tell you we heard 'em!

194
00:09:24,315 --> 00:09:25,531
Heard what?
Indians!
Their war cries!

195
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:26,782
Where? When?

196
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:29,285
This afternoon, sir,
at the junction

197
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,170
of the bighorn
and the little bighorn.

198
00:09:31,205 --> 00:09:31,787
Captain,

199
00:09:31,822 --> 00:09:33,539
now, i know this sounds crazy-

200
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:38,544
believe me, i know it-
but we found a canteen...

201
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:40,796
well, i must have left it
in the tank, sir.

202
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:42,682
That canteen is marked
7th cavalry.

203
00:09:42,717 --> 00:09:44,550
And we found a tepee
close to the river.

204
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:45,184
A tepee?

205
00:09:45,219 --> 00:09:47,687
Are you bucking
for a section 8, sergeant?

206
00:09:47,722 --> 00:09:49,805
That's the same tepee
that reno's scouts found

207
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,057
the night before the battle!

208
00:09:52,308 --> 00:09:54,193
Reno's scouts, huh?

209
00:09:54,228 --> 00:09:55,444
Reno being...?

210
00:09:55,479 --> 00:09:56,696
Major reno.

211
00:09:56,731 --> 00:09:58,564
When custer split his force
into three columns,

212
00:09:58,599 --> 00:09:59,198
and sent reno's
to the north...

213
00:09:59,233 --> 00:10:01,067
all right, connors,
that'll do.

214
00:10:01,102 --> 00:10:04,203
Line up your patrol
and head out at 0600
tomorrow morning.

215
00:10:04,238 --> 00:10:06,706
And if you meet
any indians...

216
00:10:06,741 --> 00:10:09,825
if you meet indians, will
you take it very slow?

217
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,711
Because they're all
college graduates

218
00:10:11,746 --> 00:10:14,830
and they're probably running
tests on the soil.

219
00:10:27,843 --> 00:10:30,346
Where to now, sarge?

220
00:10:30,381 --> 00:10:32,848
Well, we'll, uh...
we'll follow this trail

221
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:35,985
about two,
three more miles.

222
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,603
That's reno's route.

223
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:38,854
Yeah.

224
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:40,106
Aw, for pete's sakes.

225
00:10:40,141 --> 00:10:41,357
Are you guys
still on that?

226
00:10:41,392 --> 00:10:45,111
It's reno this, benteen that,
custer something else.

227
00:10:45,146 --> 00:10:46,996
I don't know what's
the matter with you.

228
00:10:47,031 --> 00:10:48,864
You talk about it
all night.

229
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:49,749
Hey!

230
00:10:56,005 --> 00:10:57,256
Hey, wait a minute.

231
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:58,507
Hold on, now,
wait a minute.

232
00:10:58,542 --> 00:11:00,376
That's an
incinerator,

233
00:11:00,411 --> 00:11:02,878
or it's somebody cooking
a steak or something,

234
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:04,880
or it's some tourists
that don't dig smokey the bear.

235
00:11:04,915 --> 00:11:07,266
Will you guys
knock it off, huh?

236
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:17,526
It figures. It has to.

237
00:11:17,561 --> 00:11:20,646
Reno's scouts found the tepee
the night before the battle,

238
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:22,531
and the following morning,
the column saw smoke signals.

239
00:11:22,566 --> 00:11:24,784
And late that morning,
they got their first indian.

240
00:11:24,819 --> 00:11:26,035
When the war party went by,

241
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:27,903
one of their troopers shot
the last rider.

242
00:11:27,938 --> 00:11:29,038
Aw, will you stop it?

243
00:11:29,073 --> 00:11:31,040
Come on, now, i
can take a joke

244
00:11:31,075 --> 00:11:32,908
just like
anybody else,

245
00:11:32,943 --> 00:11:34,410
but this is
too much, man.

246
00:11:34,445 --> 00:11:35,911
I'm telling you,
this is too much.

247
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:37,163
You're going
to tell me

248
00:11:37,198 --> 00:11:38,414
that somewhere
around that bend,

249
00:11:38,449 --> 00:11:40,299
we're going to run into
a war party of sioux!

250
00:11:40,334 --> 00:11:42,301
Well, look, i'm telling you,
man, if that happens,

251
00:11:42,336 --> 00:11:44,170
i'm checking myself in
with the medics, man,

252
00:11:44,205 --> 00:11:45,421
for the rubber room.

253
00:11:45,456 --> 00:11:47,306
But i want to make it
a reservation for three,

254
00:11:47,341 --> 00:11:49,809
you understand me?

255
00:11:58,684 --> 00:11:59,935
Mccluskey,
you moron!

256
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,821
Kid, what are you
shooting at?

257
00:12:01,856 --> 00:12:02,688
Give me that-

258
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:03,939
mccluskey, look!

259
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,951
Oh, my dear god.

260
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:17,837
An indian horse without a rider.

261
00:12:17,872 --> 00:12:19,705
I killed him.

262
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,208
Sergeant, i just fired blind
into that dust cloud, but...

263
00:12:25,594 --> 00:12:29,348
all right, langsford, you,
uh, you got something to say,

264
00:12:29,383 --> 00:12:31,851
well, why don't you
say it?

265
00:12:32,468 --> 00:12:33,102
No, sarge.

266
00:12:33,137 --> 00:12:35,604
I got something to ask.

267
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:39,358
I'd like to know
what's going on around here.

268
00:12:39,393 --> 00:12:40,609
I don't know.

269
00:12:40,644 --> 00:12:43,112
I don't know for sure.

270
00:12:43,147 --> 00:12:44,980
But i got an idea.

271
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:47,366
Somehow, some way, we're...

272
00:12:47,401 --> 00:12:51,120
following the same trail
that custer did.

273
00:12:51,155 --> 00:12:54,240
Look,
let's figure it out.

274
00:12:54,275 --> 00:12:56,125
Now first, the tepee.

275
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,245
Now, when did we find it,
yesterday afternoon, right?

276
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,381
Just like
the scout did before.

277
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:04,250
And the smoke signals...

278
00:13:04,285 --> 00:13:07,386
just like reno's column
saw the next morning.

279
00:13:07,421 --> 00:13:09,255
Mccluskey...

280
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:11,640
he gets himself
an indian, just...

281
00:13:11,675 --> 00:13:14,143
just like on
the day of the battle.

282
00:13:14,178 --> 00:13:15,895
All right, connors.

283
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:19,014
Okay, let's say... let's
say that you're right.

284
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:21,517
Let's say that this
thing is happening,

285
00:13:21,552 --> 00:13:24,019
just like you said it is.

286
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:29,024
Let's say that we're going to
follow this trail just like

287
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:31,527
well, just like
they did it, huh?

288
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:35,664
Now, what i want to know is
what's going to happen next?

289
00:13:35,699 --> 00:13:39,285
We're going to wind up
at a massacre.

290
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,170
That's what.

291
00:13:41,205 --> 00:13:43,789
You gonna stop it?

292
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:48,677
Yeah, stop it, or...

293
00:13:48,712 --> 00:13:50,546
join it.

294
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:28,751
Finnegan?

295
00:14:28,786 --> 00:14:30,002
Has connors reported in?

296
00:14:30,037 --> 00:14:31,253
Not yet, sir.

297
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:32,504
Get him.

298
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:33,756
Yes, sir.

299
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,641
Bluebird 9?

300
00:14:35,676 --> 00:14:38,394
Bluebird 9, this is c.p.

301
00:14:40,262 --> 00:14:42,765
Bluebird 9, bluebird 9, over.

302
00:14:45,267 --> 00:14:47,152
This is bluebird 9,
go ahead, c.p.

303
00:14:47,187 --> 00:14:49,271
They're
acknowledging, sir.

304
00:14:51,774 --> 00:14:53,659
Connors?
This is the captain.

305
00:14:53,694 --> 00:14:55,160
It's mccluskey, sir.

306
00:14:55,277 --> 00:14:56,528
Mccluskey?

307
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:58,414
Do you think you guys
might extend yourselves a bit

308
00:14:58,449 --> 00:14:59,665
and give me your position?

309
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:03,285
We're about four miles
down rosebud creek.

310
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,170
We're about to cross over.

311
00:15:05,205 --> 00:15:07,289
You're about to come back here
on the double.

312
00:15:07,324 --> 00:15:09,792
You're about to report
to me personally.

313
00:15:09,827 --> 00:15:11,794
You're about to do it
within the next half-hour

314
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:14,296
or you'll be spending the
next three national holidays

315
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:16,181
in the guardhouse,
do you read me?

316
00:15:16,216 --> 00:15:16,799
Yes, sir, just a minute.

317
00:15:17,433 --> 00:15:19,301
Here's sergeant connors.

318
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:21,186
Captain,
this is connors.

319
00:15:21,303 --> 00:15:23,806
Connors, do i have to send
a couple of m.p. S down there?

320
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:26,308
Captain, look,
we're just a mile

321
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:27,559
from where major reno
met the sioux!

322
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:30,062
Listen to me, connors.

323
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:33,198
I'm going to give this
to you just once.

324
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:35,067
When these maneuvers are over,

325
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:36,318
you can come back here
on a vacation

326
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:38,821
and dig arrowheads,
or anything you like.

327
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:41,323
But right now, i want
a government-issue tank

328
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:42,574
back here at the command post

329
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:43,826
with three national guardsmen

330
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,328
named connors, mccluskey and
langsford right alongside it.

331
00:15:46,363 --> 00:15:47,579
Now, you've got
exactly 30 minutes

332
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:48,831
to bring her back here.

333
00:15:48,866 --> 00:15:50,082
Acknowledge!

334
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:52,584
Connors, acknowledge!

335
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:54,470
Connors!

336
00:15:54,505 --> 00:15:56,338
He's broken off,
sir.

337
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:57,589
Lieutenant!

338
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:02,594
Take a jeep and three
men down rosebud crick.

339
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:05,230
Just follow the tread marks,
and bring 'em back.

340
00:16:05,347 --> 00:16:05,981
What if they resist?

341
00:16:06,016 --> 00:16:07,850
I'll tell you, lieutenant.

342
00:16:07,885 --> 00:16:12,237
First apologize,
then shoot each one in the leg.

343
00:16:12,272 --> 00:16:13,489
Do you read me?

344
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,109
All right,
let's move out.

345
00:17:00,035 --> 00:17:01,904
Nothing.

346
00:17:01,939 --> 00:17:03,288
Nothing and no one.

347
00:17:03,323 --> 00:17:07,042
And right down there
is where reno had his battle.

348
00:17:07,077 --> 00:17:08,410
Well...

349
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:10,295
you guys better manufacture
a couple of indians in a hurry.

350
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:11,547
Because, uh...

351
00:17:11,582 --> 00:17:13,415
i know a national guards captain

352
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,918
that's probably on his way here
with a net!

353
00:17:15,953 --> 00:17:16,552
Where are they, sarge?

354
00:17:16,587 --> 00:17:19,421
How come we missed out?

355
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:21,306
You want
an explanation?

356
00:17:21,341 --> 00:17:23,425
We missed out
because we're looking

357
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:26,562
for dead cavalry,
buried indians

358
00:17:26,597 --> 00:17:27,813
and an 80-year-old battle.

359
00:17:27,848 --> 00:17:29,064
That's why
we missed out.

360
00:17:29,099 --> 00:17:31,567
Now, i've been doing
some thinking about this thing,

361
00:17:31,602 --> 00:17:32,818
see, and i got it figured out.

362
00:17:32,853 --> 00:17:35,938
This whole thing
is strictly an illusion.

363
00:17:35,973 --> 00:17:38,323
That's the goods-
it's an illusion!

364
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:42,077
We've talked ourselves
into a stinking illusion.

365
00:17:42,112 --> 00:17:44,446
No, that's not it.

366
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:46,331
That's not it at all.

367
00:17:46,366 --> 00:17:47,583
Mccluskey...

368
00:17:47,618 --> 00:17:48,951
do you remember

369
00:17:49,585 --> 00:17:51,453
what it was that reno
found before the battle?

370
00:17:51,488 --> 00:17:53,956
He even sent a message back
to custer about it.

371
00:17:53,991 --> 00:17:55,841
Sure, the village.

372
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:59,211
What village?

373
00:17:59,246 --> 00:18:00,462
What village?

374
00:18:00,497 --> 00:18:02,965
What do i have to tell you guys
to straighten you out, huh?

375
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,216
Tell me.

376
00:18:04,251 --> 00:18:06,101
Reno's scouts
found an indian village,

377
00:18:06,136 --> 00:18:07,352
and it was an hour after that

378
00:18:07,387 --> 00:18:09,221
that the whole troop
went into action.

379
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:11,723
Aw, man, my aching back.

380
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:13,609
I swear, i give up.

381
00:18:13,644 --> 00:18:14,226
I give up!

382
00:18:16,979 --> 00:18:20,732
This is where the men
separate from the nutsies.

383
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:22,618
Where're
you going?

384
00:18:22,653 --> 00:18:25,737
I'm going to cut back to c.p.,
if i can find it.

385
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:26,989
But don't worry, boys.

386
00:18:27,024 --> 00:18:29,491
I'm going to send you
a padded ambulance.

387
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:32,628
Arrivederci...
you all!

388
00:19:26,048 --> 00:19:28,550
It's the village.

389
00:19:31,088 --> 00:19:33,555
That's a mirage,
is it, langsford?

390
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:36,058
It's not really
there, is it?

391
00:19:36,093 --> 00:19:37,943
I don't know, man,
don't ask me anything.

392
00:19:37,978 --> 00:19:39,194
Don't-don't ask
me nothing, i...

393
00:19:39,229 --> 00:19:41,697
i'll go down
and scout it.

394
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:45,450
You know, an hour ago
if he'd said that,

395
00:19:45,485 --> 00:19:47,953
i'd have laughed
at him or shut him up,

396
00:19:47,988 --> 00:19:51,073
but now
i don't know.

397
00:19:51,108 --> 00:19:54,209
Just be careful,
mccluskey.

398
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:56,211
All right, what happens
now, sergeant?

399
00:19:56,246 --> 00:19:58,714
I mean, what happens next?

400
00:19:58,749 --> 00:20:03,719
Beyond the village
is where benteen engages.

401
00:20:03,754 --> 00:20:08,090
Well, i mean, uh,
what about custer?

402
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:09,341
He loses a right arm.

403
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:13,095
And as of the moment reno
got cut off back there,

404
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:15,597
custer's column was doomed.

405
00:20:15,632 --> 00:20:18,350
Man, this is wild.

406
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:22,104
I mean, this is really
wild... it's, uh...

407
00:20:22,139 --> 00:20:24,856
it's like
chasing history.

408
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:27,359
It's like chasing history
and trying to change it.

409
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:27,993
Yeah.

410
00:20:28,028 --> 00:20:29,861
Connors?

411
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:32,364
Langsford?

412
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:34,249
If it's a mirage
it sure went the route.

413
00:20:34,284 --> 00:20:35,500
Kid,
you all right?

414
00:20:35,535 --> 00:20:37,369
What's
the matter?

415
00:20:37,404 --> 00:20:40,505
I just seen the granddaddy
of all mirages.

416
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:43,625
This one's sticking
out of my back.

417
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,763
Bluebird 9, bluebird 9.

418
00:20:47,798 --> 00:20:50,882
This is c.p.
Come in, bluebird 9.

419
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:56,521
Captain.

420
00:20:56,556 --> 00:20:57,773
You'd better tell me

421
00:20:57,808 --> 00:20:59,024
they're just
a few hundred yards behind you.

422
00:20:59,059 --> 00:21:00,642
I can't tell you that, sir.

423
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:02,778
Then you'd better be
telling me something else...

424
00:21:02,813 --> 00:21:04,646
like the whereabouts
of an m-4 tank.

425
00:21:04,681 --> 00:21:05,897
We found the tank, sir.

426
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:08,283
And this was on it.

427
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:13,288
"Crossing rosebud creek.

428
00:21:13,323 --> 00:21:15,157
"Trying to reach
7th cavalry.

429
00:21:15,192 --> 00:21:17,659
Have to."

430
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:19,544
I don't get it.

431
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:23,298
I swear
i don't get it.

432
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:26,418
What's he mean by the
7th cavalry, captain?

433
00:21:26,453 --> 00:21:27,669
Who's the 7th cavalry?

434
00:21:27,704 --> 00:21:30,172
It's a very hot outfit

435
00:21:30,207 --> 00:21:33,308
headed up by a tiger
by the name of george custer.

436
00:21:33,343 --> 00:21:35,177
Don't ask me any more.

437
00:21:35,212 --> 00:21:36,428
I wouldn't be able
to tell you.

438
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:53,328
Come on, just
hang on now.

439
00:21:53,363 --> 00:21:54,579
We're going
to make it.

440
00:21:54,614 --> 00:21:55,831
Just hang on.

441
00:21:55,866 --> 00:21:57,082
I'll make it
all right.

442
00:21:57,117 --> 00:21:58,950
Just a few hundred more feet,
that's all.

443
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:00,836
Right over that ridge.

444
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:02,087
Come on.

445
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:37,739
All right, fellows...

446
00:22:37,774 --> 00:22:38,990
let's do it!

447
00:23:14,109 --> 00:23:16,495
There's no sign of the men
on either side, captain.

448
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:17,746
The tank's up there
on the ridge,

449
00:23:17,781 --> 00:23:18,997
but there's no sign
of the men-

450
00:23:19,032 --> 00:23:20,248
no sign at all.

451
00:23:20,283 --> 00:23:20,866
Keep looking.

452
00:23:20,901 --> 00:23:24,002
Yes, sir.

453
00:23:24,037 --> 00:23:27,122
Put them
on report, sir?

454
00:23:27,157 --> 00:23:30,258
Put 'em on report.

455
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,761
Captain!

456
00:23:39,768 --> 00:23:43,522
"William connors...

457
00:23:43,557 --> 00:23:46,775
"michael mccluskey...

458
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:48,026
richard langsford."

459
00:23:50,145 --> 00:23:52,647
Kind of
a coincidence, sir?

460
00:23:52,682 --> 00:23:54,533
Quite a coincidence.

461
00:23:54,568 --> 00:23:57,652
Too bad they couldn't
have brought the tank up.

462
00:23:57,687 --> 00:23:58,904
It would have helped.

463
00:23:58,939 --> 00:24:00,155
Beg pardon, sir?

464
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,909
Nothing, lieutenant.

465
00:24:03,944 --> 00:24:05,794
I didn't say anything.

466
00:24:08,296 --> 00:24:09,664
Sergeant william connors,

467
00:24:09,699 --> 00:24:10,916
trooper michael mccluskey,

468
00:24:10,951 --> 00:24:13,418
and trooper richard langsford

469
00:24:13,453 --> 00:24:16,555
who on a hot afternoon in june
made a charge over a hill

470
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:18,423
and never returned.

471
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:20,308
Look for this one
under "p" for phantom

472
00:24:20,343 --> 00:24:23,428
in a historical ledger
located in a reading room

473
00:24:23,463 --> 00:24:27,816
known as... the twilight zone.

474
00:24:31,536 --> 00:24:33,271
And now, mr. Serling.

475
00:24:33,306 --> 00:24:36,408
No one likes to age,
but it's a natural process

476
00:24:36,443 --> 00:24:38,910
like death and taxes
and the weather.

477
00:24:38,945 --> 00:24:40,779
But next time ontwilight zone,
we tell the story

478
00:24:40,814 --> 00:24:43,281
about what happens
when a certain man doesn't age.

479
00:24:43,915 --> 00:24:45,167
As a matter of fact,
he grows younger.

480
00:24:45,202 --> 00:24:47,035
Patrick o'neal stars in

481
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:49,538
"a short drink
from a certain fountain."

482
00:24:49,573 --> 00:24:51,423
Now if this one doesn't
pull you up by the shoulders,

483
00:24:51,458 --> 00:24:52,674
i don't think anything will.

484
00:24:52,709 --> 00:24:55,177
I hope we see you next time.
