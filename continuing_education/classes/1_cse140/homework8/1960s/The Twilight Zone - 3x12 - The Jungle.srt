1
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:12,262
You're traveling
through another dimension-

2
00:00:12,297 --> 00:00:16,016
a dimension not only of sight
and sound, but of mind,

3
00:00:16,051 --> 00:00:17,884
a journey into a wondrous land

4
00:00:17,919 --> 00:00:19,769
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

5
00:00:19,804 --> 00:00:22,889
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

6
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:39,906
Say, doris,
i lost one of my cuff links.

7
00:00:39,941 --> 00:00:41,791
Oh, i'll see if
i can find it.

8
00:00:41,826 --> 00:00:43,043
No, i found it.

9
00:00:43,078 --> 00:00:44,911
That's all right, then.

10
00:00:44,946 --> 00:00:48,048
I found it
in your jewel case.

11
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:50,550
And i found
some other items.

12
00:00:50,585 --> 00:00:52,419
Oh?

13
00:00:52,454 --> 00:00:53,670
What about them?

14
00:00:54,921 --> 00:00:56,172
You tell me.

15
00:00:56,207 --> 00:00:59,309
There's nothing
much to tell, really.

16
00:00:59,344 --> 00:01:02,429
I decided to bring back
some souvenirs.

17
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:03,930
Souvenirs?

18
00:01:03,965 --> 00:01:05,181
A human finger?

19
00:01:05,216 --> 00:01:06,433
A sacred death stone?

20
00:01:06,468 --> 00:01:10,186
A vulture's claw?

21
00:01:10,221 --> 00:01:12,072
Baubles of a witch doctor.

22
00:01:12,107 --> 00:01:14,574
That's all these are to you,
souvenirs?

23
00:01:15,191 --> 00:01:16,576
Of course.

24
00:01:16,611 --> 00:01:19,079
Nothing else?
Are you sure?

25
00:01:20,947 --> 00:01:22,832
Certainly, i'm sure.

26
00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:30,957
Then you won't mind if i
dispose of them, will you?

27
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,711
Alan, don't!

28
00:01:34,746 --> 00:01:35,962
Please don't!

29
00:01:35,997 --> 00:01:38,465
Please don't, alan!
Please don't!
Why not?

30
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:39,849
No!

31
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:44,721
All right, now,
are there any more

32
00:01:44,756 --> 00:01:46,606
souvenirs?

33
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:52,228
We aren't in africa any longer,
we're here in new york.

34
00:01:52,263 --> 00:01:54,114
Do you understand
what i'm saying?

35
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:55,865
This is for weak people,

36
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,985
ignorant, uncivilized people
who don't know any better,

37
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,870
not for you, or me.

38
00:02:00,905 --> 00:02:02,989
Doris, we've done
nothing wrong.

39
00:02:03,024 --> 00:02:04,874
We have nothing
to fear.

40
00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:07,994
Least of all
from a bunch of witch doctors

41
00:02:08,029 --> 00:02:09,879
5,000 miles away.

42
00:02:09,914 --> 00:02:11,748
What are you afraid of?

43
00:02:11,783 --> 00:02:12,749
Africa.

44
00:02:12,784 --> 00:02:14,000
Do you remember

45
00:02:14,035 --> 00:02:16,503
what the old shaman
said long ago

46
00:02:16,538 --> 00:02:18,388
when the men
started drilling?

47
00:02:18,423 --> 00:02:20,256
He said we were
wounding the land,

48
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:22,142
hurting it,
making it bleed.

49
00:02:22,177 --> 00:02:24,511
Alan, he said that land
would make us pay.

50
00:02:24,546 --> 00:02:26,396
Doris, we left
africa weeks ago.

51
00:02:26,431 --> 00:02:27,397
Did we? Well, i wonder.

52
00:02:27,432 --> 00:02:29,899
Alan, sometimes at night
i can feel it,

53
00:02:29,934 --> 00:02:34,904
all around me,
like some huge, dark animal.

54
00:02:34,939 --> 00:02:35,522
Alan, please.

55
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,024
Please don't
let them go there.

56
00:02:38,059 --> 00:02:39,909
Tell them it won't work.

57
00:02:39,944 --> 00:02:43,029
Stop them now while
there's still time, please!

58
00:02:57,794 --> 00:03:00,930
It's my job to engineer
a hydroelectric project,

59
00:03:00,965 --> 00:03:03,433
not pander to ignorant
witch doctors.

60
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,313
I'll try to be back early.

61
00:03:17,348 --> 00:03:19,199
You'll never be back.

62
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:24,821
Don't open the door.

63
00:03:32,113 --> 00:03:33,963
The carcass of a goat,

64
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:36,466
a dead finger,

65
00:03:36,501 --> 00:03:38,968
a few bits
of broken glass and stone

66
00:03:39,003 --> 00:03:43,339
and mr. Alan richards,
a modern man of a modern age,

67
00:03:43,374 --> 00:03:44,591
hating with all his heart

68
00:03:44,626 --> 00:03:46,476
something
in which he cannot believe

69
00:03:46,511 --> 00:03:48,978
and preparing-
although he doesn't know it-

70
00:03:49,013 --> 00:03:50,847
to take the longest walk
of his life

71
00:03:50,882 --> 00:03:55,852
right down to the center
of the twilight zone.

72
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:15,421
Levelling and drainage
have already been started

73
00:04:15,456 --> 00:04:17,924
as well as preliminary work
on the dam itself.

74
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:21,044
Our time of completion
will have to be upped

75
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,929
by three to six months,

76
00:04:22,964 --> 00:04:25,431
but this shouldn't affect
our general cost

77
00:04:26,049 --> 00:04:27,934
more than
a few thousand dollars.

78
00:04:27,969 --> 00:04:29,686
Well, it's
getting very late.

79
00:04:29,721 --> 00:04:30,937
Before we make
a decision,

80
00:04:30,972 --> 00:04:33,439
i have a few questions
if you don't mind.

81
00:04:33,474 --> 00:04:34,691
Certainly, sir.

82
00:04:34,726 --> 00:04:37,193
I'm sure you've
considered this
carefully,

83
00:04:37,228 --> 00:04:39,062
but, for my
own curiosity,

84
00:04:39,097 --> 00:04:40,313
what about
the natives?

85
00:04:40,348 --> 00:04:41,564
Natives?

86
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:43,449
What about them, sir?

87
00:04:43,484 --> 00:04:45,952
Well, what's
their attitude?

88
00:04:45,987 --> 00:04:47,203
How are they
reacting?

89
00:04:47,238 --> 00:04:49,072
As far as i know...

90
00:04:49,107 --> 00:04:52,208
well, the kekouyu
are a violent people.

91
00:04:52,243 --> 00:04:54,460
They resent
the loss of their homes.

92
00:04:54,495 --> 00:04:56,329
They resent the enterprise

93
00:04:56,364 --> 00:04:58,831
even though
they'll benefit eventually.

94
00:04:58,866 --> 00:05:00,083
They resent us.

95
00:05:00,118 --> 00:05:05,722
But i doubt they'll cause
any serious disturbance.

96
00:05:05,757 --> 00:05:09,592
Except... for uchawi.

97
00:05:09,627 --> 00:05:11,227
Uchawi?

98
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:13,596
Uh... witchcraft.

99
00:05:14,632 --> 00:05:16,482
A number of
shamans decided

100
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:20,236
to put a curse on everyone
connected with the enterprise

101
00:05:20,271 --> 00:05:23,990
effective upon the decision
to go ahead with the project.

102
00:05:24,025 --> 00:05:25,858
What sort of a curse,
mr. Richards?

103
00:05:25,893 --> 00:05:27,744
The usual:

104
00:05:27,779 --> 00:05:29,612
A slow,
painful death.

105
00:05:30,898 --> 00:05:33,366
Now, gentlemen,
i assure you,

106
00:05:33,401 --> 00:05:35,868
there's nothing at all
funny about uchawi.

107
00:05:35,903 --> 00:05:37,754
Oh, you're
not serious.

108
00:05:37,789 --> 00:05:38,755
I am, i've seen it work.

109
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,623
I have seen healthy men
sicken and die

110
00:05:40,658 --> 00:05:43,760
within ten minutes of the time
set by the witch doctors

111
00:05:43,795 --> 00:05:45,011
who cursed them-

112
00:05:45,046 --> 00:05:46,879
healthy men. And women.

113
00:05:46,914 --> 00:05:49,382
They weren't touched.

114
00:05:49,417 --> 00:05:51,267
They weren't poisoned.

115
00:05:51,302 --> 00:05:53,770
They weren't harmed in any way.

116
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:55,638
They just died.

117
00:05:55,673 --> 00:05:57,774
Don't talk rubbish.

118
00:05:57,809 --> 00:05:59,025
Alan...
wait a minute,

119
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,893
just a second.

120
00:06:00,928 --> 00:06:02,779
Mr. Sinclair.

121
00:06:02,814 --> 00:06:05,281
What time is it?

122
00:06:05,316 --> 00:06:06,899
Oh, say,
what's this

123
00:06:06,934 --> 00:06:08,785
you're wearing
on your watch chain?

124
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,036
Why, it's...

125
00:06:10,071 --> 00:06:11,404
a rabbit's foot,
isn't it?

126
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:13,289
Why do you
wear that?
Now, see here.

127
00:06:13,324 --> 00:06:15,158
It's for luck,
isn't it?

128
00:06:15,193 --> 00:06:18,911
Well, what's that
got to do with magic?

129
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,414
Sinclair carries
the severed foot

130
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:23,916
of a dead animal
for good fortune

131
00:06:23,951 --> 00:06:27,053
and can't see what
that's to do with magic?

132
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:32,675
Hardy is amused.

133
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:35,812
Although it's known
he's a superstitious man

134
00:06:35,847 --> 00:06:38,314
or have you finally
given up astrology?

135
00:06:38,349 --> 00:06:40,183
Well...

136
00:06:40,218 --> 00:06:42,068
now, here's a 20th-century man

137
00:06:42,103 --> 00:06:45,188
who allows the stars
to make his decisions.

138
00:06:45,223 --> 00:06:48,191
And a fine job they've done
of it, too, young man.

139
00:06:48,226 --> 00:06:49,325
That's exactly what

140
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,828
a kekouyu witch doctor
said to me

141
00:06:51,863 --> 00:06:53,696
when i suggested
panther bones

142
00:06:53,731 --> 00:06:56,199
could not
foretell the future.

143
00:06:57,735 --> 00:07:00,203
You needn't smile,
mr. Templeton.

144
00:07:00,238 --> 00:07:02,088
I've seen you
knock on wood

145
00:07:02,123 --> 00:07:03,339
more than once.

146
00:07:03,374 --> 00:07:04,590
Oh, alan...

147
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,459
mr. Fleming,
when did you last

148
00:07:06,494 --> 00:07:07,710
walk under a ladder?

149
00:07:07,745 --> 00:07:09,595
Throw salt over
your shoulder?

150
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,464
All right,
mr. Richards

151
00:07:11,499 --> 00:07:12,715
you've made
your point.

152
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,852
A multl-billion corporation
run by witches...

153
00:07:15,887 --> 00:07:17,103
warlocks.

154
00:07:17,138 --> 00:07:18,971
In a 40-story building

155
00:07:19,006 --> 00:07:22,108
that doesn't even
have a 13th floor.

156
00:07:22,143 --> 00:07:23,359
Now, gentlemen, i...

157
00:07:23,394 --> 00:07:24,610
mr. Richards!

158
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:37,740
Chad.

159
00:07:37,775 --> 00:07:38,991
Tell me something

160
00:07:39,026 --> 00:07:42,745
if you wanted to get
hold of a dead goat

161
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:43,996
on an hour's notice,

162
00:07:44,031 --> 00:07:46,382
where would
you go?

163
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,502
To a psychiatrist.

164
00:07:49,537 --> 00:07:51,003
No, i'm serious.

165
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:52,505
Well, so am i.

166
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,390
You really want
a dead goat?

167
00:07:54,425 --> 00:07:56,893
No.
Then what are you
talking about?

168
00:07:58,179 --> 00:08:00,012
I'll do it.

169
00:08:00,047 --> 00:08:01,397
Hey.

170
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:03,900
What's this?

171
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:13,526
That, my dear chad,
is kipitu.

172
00:08:13,561 --> 00:08:16,028
A protective amulet.

173
00:08:16,063 --> 00:08:17,914
Where did it
come from?

174
00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:20,416
Doris.

175
00:08:20,451 --> 00:08:22,285
You see, if this
is a lion's tooth,

176
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,421
i gather i'm being
protected from lions.

177
00:08:25,456 --> 00:08:27,290
In, uh, new york city?

178
00:08:27,325 --> 00:08:27,924
Yeah.

179
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:29,792
Well, got to admit

180
00:08:29,827 --> 00:08:31,043
they're doing a fine job.

181
00:08:31,078 --> 00:08:33,546
This is how doris
looks at it.

182
00:08:33,581 --> 00:08:36,432
What will you do about doris?

183
00:08:36,467 --> 00:08:37,800
I don't know.

184
00:08:37,835 --> 00:08:39,051
She's sick,
isn't she?

185
00:08:39,086 --> 00:08:40,937
So are half the city's people!

186
00:08:40,972 --> 00:08:43,306
My wife carries
a lion's tooth,

187
00:08:43,341 --> 00:08:45,808
the company president,
a rabbit's foot-

188
00:08:45,843 --> 00:08:48,311
it's all the same,
same rotten disease.

189
00:08:48,346 --> 00:08:50,813
It's eating away at
the strength, the will,

190
00:08:50,848 --> 00:08:52,064
the very soul of me.

191
00:08:52,099 --> 00:08:53,950
Hey, hey, alan.

192
00:08:53,985 --> 00:08:56,452
Think you better
have another drink.

193
00:08:56,487 --> 00:08:57,703
Hmm-mm.

194
00:08:57,738 --> 00:08:58,955
Alan, take it easy.

195
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:02,074
A guy doesn't get
this worked up

196
00:09:02,109 --> 00:09:04,577
about something
he doesn't believe in.

197
00:09:04,612 --> 00:09:06,462
What do you mean?

198
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:08,965
Oh, nothing.

199
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,216
Come on.

200
00:09:10,251 --> 00:09:12,084
Look, it's 3:00.

201
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:13,336
Doris will be worried.

202
00:09:13,371 --> 00:09:17,089
No, i called her,
i told her i'd be late.

203
00:09:17,124 --> 00:09:18,975
Did you pay?

204
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:19,592
Yeah.

205
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:22,728
I'll see you tomorrow.

206
00:09:23,346 --> 00:09:23,980
Good night.

207
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,501
Hey, chad!

208
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:10,393
Hey.

209
00:10:10,428 --> 00:10:11,644
Anybody there?

210
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,883
Hello?

211
00:12:37,491 --> 00:12:41,844
Cab, mister?

212
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:42,595
Shuler house.

213
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:45,097
Right.

214
00:13:17,246 --> 00:13:21,000
Driver, the light's green.

215
00:13:21,035 --> 00:13:22,885
You can go now.

216
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,753
Driver.

217
00:13:24,788 --> 00:13:26,639
The light's green.

218
00:15:00,884 --> 00:15:04,486
Oh.

219
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,616
Hey, excuse me, mister.

220
00:15:17,651 --> 00:15:20,753
I've had nothing
to eat for two days.

221
00:15:20,788 --> 00:15:24,506
I'd surely appreciate it
if you could help me out.

222
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:26,375
Sure...

223
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,877
sure, sure.

224
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,380
Yes, sir.

225
00:15:34,551 --> 00:15:37,019
God bless you, mister.

226
00:15:37,054 --> 00:15:39,521
Hey, wait a minute.

227
00:15:42,676 --> 00:15:45,144
Where's that sound
coming from?

228
00:15:50,184 --> 00:15:52,651
What sound was that?

229
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,907
Those drums.

230
00:16:02,696 --> 00:16:04,546
I don't hear
no drums.

231
00:16:04,581 --> 00:16:06,415
Listen.

232
00:16:07,701 --> 00:16:11,420
You mean to tell me
you can't hear that?

233
00:16:11,455 --> 00:16:13,922
Huh, you'll have
to excuse me.

234
00:16:13,957 --> 00:16:17,059
My ears aren't as good
as they used to be.

235
00:16:17,094 --> 00:16:18,927
Say, wait a minute.

236
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:23,315
How would you like
to make some money?

237
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,069
Doing what?

238
00:16:27,104 --> 00:16:28,937
I'm trying to get home

239
00:16:28,972 --> 00:16:30,823
on the other side
of the park.

240
00:16:30,858 --> 00:16:34,576
If you walk with me,
i'll give you ten dollars.

241
00:16:45,873 --> 00:16:48,340
Now, don't tell me
you can't hear tha...

242
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:55,347
hey!

243
00:16:55,382 --> 00:16:59,101
Come back!

244
00:17:08,477 --> 00:17:10,979
Hey, come back!

245
00:17:11,014 --> 00:17:14,733
Look, i'll give you $20!

246
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,743
Come back.

247
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,640
Some superstitions kept alive
by the long night of ignorance

248
00:24:01,675 --> 00:24:02,891
have their own special power.

249
00:24:02,926 --> 00:24:05,393
You'll hear of it
through a jungle grapevine

250
00:24:05,428 --> 00:24:09,781
in a remote corner
of the twilight zone.

251
00:24:12,734 --> 00:24:15,737
Rod serling,
creator ofthe twilight zone,

252
00:24:15,772 --> 00:24:17,622

about next week's story

253

after this message.

254
00:24:21,011 --> 00:24:23,128
And now, mr. Serling.

255
00:24:23,163 --> 00:24:24,379

cameras a most unique gentlemen

very special brand of clownship

00:24:29,419 --> 00:24:31,887
has long ago become
a milestone in american humor.

259
00:24:31,922 --> 00:24:35,640
Mr. Buster keaton
appears in "once upon a time."

260
00:24:35,675 --> 00:24:38,143
A script written especially
for him by richard matheson,

261
00:24:38,178 --> 00:24:40,645
this one is wild, woolly
and most unpredictable.

262
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,897
Onthe twilight zonenext week,

263
00:24:41,932 --> 00:24:46,268
