1
00:00:07,175 --> 00:00:09,642
You unlock this door
with the key of imagination.

2
00:00:10,276 --> 00:00:12,028
Beyond it is another dimension-

3
00:00:12,063 --> 00:00:14,030
a dimension of sound,

4
00:00:14,065 --> 00:00:17,150
a dimension of sight,

5
00:00:17,185 --> 00:00:19,035
a dimension of mind.

6
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:21,538
You're moving into a land
of both shadow and substance,

7
00:00:21,573 --> 00:00:23,406
of things and ideas.

8
00:00:23,441 --> 00:00:27,160
You've just crossed over
into the twilight zone.

9
00:00:48,431 --> 00:00:50,316
I thought you made
an appointment.

10
00:00:50,351 --> 00:00:52,819
I did.

11
00:00:52,854 --> 00:00:54,687
Oh, come on, alan.

12
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:57,190
You're not in that much
of a hurry, are you?

13
00:00:57,225 --> 00:00:57,941
Yes.

14
00:00:57,976 --> 00:01:00,693
Oh.

15
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:02,579
Well, in that case,
you tell them.

16
00:01:02,614 --> 00:01:04,447
You tell them
they're keeping the head

17
00:01:04,482 --> 00:01:06,950
of the mcclellan enterprises
waiting. Tell them.

18
00:01:06,985 --> 00:01:09,335
All right, all right.

19
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:19,345
Do you want to forget
the whole thing?

20
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,848
No, i don't want to
forget the whole thing.

21
00:01:21,883 --> 00:01:24,350
I just want to get this
foolishness over with.

22
00:01:30,607 --> 00:01:32,475
Can i have one?

23
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:37,480
Why, thank you.

24
00:01:42,986 --> 00:01:44,237
Come on.

25
00:01:47,991 --> 00:01:49,876
Hello.
Hello.

26
00:01:49,911 --> 00:01:51,127
May i help you?

27
00:01:51,162 --> 00:01:52,378
My name
is ransome.

28
00:01:52,413 --> 00:01:54,881
I believe my wife made
an appointment with you.

29
00:01:55,498 --> 00:01:56,132
Oh, yes.

30
00:01:56,167 --> 00:01:58,635
I am mr. Spiereto.

31
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:03,006
Now, exactly where do we
intend to go?

32
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:06,509
We intend to go to london.

33
00:02:06,544 --> 00:02:07,393
Splendid.

34
00:02:07,428 --> 00:02:08,645
Of course, you've been.

35
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,396
No.

36
00:02:10,431 --> 00:02:12,899
Well, it's a charming place,
utterly charming.

37
00:02:12,934 --> 00:02:15,401
Of course, you
picked a rather bad
time of the year...

38
00:02:15,436 --> 00:02:17,904
excuse me, mr. Spiereto,
but we're kind of rushed,

39
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:19,772
and i'd
appreciate it...

40
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:21,024
well, we all are.

41
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:24,911
Now...

42
00:02:24,946 --> 00:02:28,281
have you decided
on an airline?

43
00:02:28,316 --> 00:02:28,915
No.

44
00:02:29,532 --> 00:02:31,417
Well, then, if i may,

45
00:02:31,452 --> 00:02:32,669
i'd like to suggest...

46
00:02:32,704 --> 00:02:33,920
oh, we're not going by plane.

47
00:02:33,955 --> 00:02:34,921
I beg your pardon?

48
00:02:34,956 --> 00:02:36,789
I say we're not going by plane.

49
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:39,425
Oh, but you must.

50
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,928
That is, unless
you're planning this

51
00:02:41,963 --> 00:02:42,679
for some time
in the future.

52
00:02:42,714 --> 00:02:44,547
No, no, we're leaving
right away.

53
00:02:44,582 --> 00:02:47,550
Then i'm afraid a ship
is out of the question.

54
00:02:47,585 --> 00:02:48,434
You see, this is
the off season,

55
00:02:48,469 --> 00:02:49,686
and all the ships
have been booked;

56
00:02:49,721 --> 00:02:52,188
they're taken off
their regular schedules.

57
00:02:52,223 --> 00:02:53,439
All of them?

58
00:02:53,474 --> 00:02:55,308
All the acceptable
ones, yes.

59
00:02:56,442 --> 00:03:01,447
I hope you won't mind
my saying this, mrs. Ransome,

60
00:03:01,482 --> 00:03:02,198
but you know,

61
00:03:02,233 --> 00:03:04,701
airplanes are
perfectly safe nowadays.

62
00:03:04,736 --> 00:03:05,952
Why, i realize
a few people

63
00:03:05,987 --> 00:03:09,706
experience a certain...
trepidation, shall we say,

64
00:03:09,741 --> 00:03:10,957
but there's absolutely
no reason...

65
00:03:10,992 --> 00:03:12,825
you don't have to tell me
about airplanes.

66
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,077
I used to be a stewardess.

67
00:03:14,112 --> 00:03:17,213
It just happens that
we don't want to fly.

68
00:03:17,248 --> 00:03:19,082
Eileen, for heaven's sake,
if it's the only way,

69
00:03:19,117 --> 00:03:20,333
it's the only way.

70
00:03:20,368 --> 00:03:24,721
Could i see a list of the boats
thatarerunning?

71
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:27,724
As you wish.

72
00:03:29,592 --> 00:03:32,095
Alan, you promised.

73
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:34,480
I know i promised.

74
00:03:34,515 --> 00:03:36,733
It really is
very important.

75
00:03:36,768 --> 00:03:39,235
Now, we agreed
on that, right?

76
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:41,104
I'm afraid...

77
00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:42,605
theseare the only

78
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,490
passenger-carrying vessels
leaving for england

79
00:03:44,525 --> 00:03:46,359
in the next 30 days.

80
00:03:46,394 --> 00:03:48,861
Themintrelis a freighter

81
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:50,747
but i understand
the accommodations
are quite adequate.

82
00:03:50,782 --> 00:03:51,998
Oh, excuse me.

83
00:03:52,033 --> 00:03:53,616
What about this one?

84
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:54,867
Thelady anne?

85
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:56,753
Oh, i don't think so.

86
00:03:56,788 --> 00:03:58,004
Why not?

87
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:59,872
Well, for one thing,
it's very nearly
the oldest boat

88
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:01,124
in the water

89
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:03,626
and it's certainly
the slowest.

90
00:04:03,661 --> 00:04:06,129
13 days to le havre,

91
00:04:06,164 --> 00:04:08,131
another half day

92
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:09,015
to southampton...

93
00:04:09,632 --> 00:04:11,517
ifthere are
favorable winds.

94
00:04:11,552 --> 00:04:12,769
Well, forget it.

95
00:04:12,804 --> 00:04:14,020
Oh, no, no, wait a minute.

96
00:04:14,055 --> 00:04:15,271
It leaves on thursday.

97
00:04:15,306 --> 00:04:17,774
That's less
than a week.

98
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:20,393
Please, mrs. Ransome,

99
00:04:20,428 --> 00:04:21,644
forget it,
take your husband's advice.

100
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:24,030
Thelady anneis an antique,

101
00:04:24,065 --> 00:04:25,281
a relic.

102
00:04:25,316 --> 00:04:27,150
Look we can relax
when we get there

103
00:04:27,185 --> 00:04:28,401
if that's what you want.

104
00:04:28,436 --> 00:04:30,286
Don't make such a
big deal out of it.

105
00:04:30,321 --> 00:04:32,789
Well, itis
a big deal to me,

106
00:04:32,824 --> 00:04:34,657
a very big deal.

107
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:40,296
Give us two tickets.

108
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:42,665
For this?

109
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,168
Yeah, that's, that's right,
thelady anne.

110
00:04:49,806 --> 00:04:51,057
Very well.

111
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:00,566
A few extra days
won't matter, will they?

112
00:05:00,601 --> 00:05:02,435
No.

113
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:03,686
I don't have anything
better to do.

114
00:05:03,721 --> 00:05:08,074
Portrait of a honeymoon couple
getting ready for a journey

115
00:05:08,109 --> 00:05:09,942
with a difference:

116
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:12,445
These newlyweds have been
married for six years

117
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,330
and they're not taking
this honeymoon

118
00:05:14,365 --> 00:05:15,581
to start their life

119
00:05:15,616 --> 00:05:16,833
but rather to save it.

120
00:05:16,868 --> 00:05:18,701
Or so eileen ransome thinks.

121
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:20,586
She doesn't know why

122
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:21,838
she insisted on a ship
for this voyage

123
00:05:21,873 --> 00:05:23,706
except that it would
give them some time

124
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:26,843
and she'd never been
on one before,

125
00:05:26,878 --> 00:05:28,711
certainly never one like
thelady anne.

126
00:05:28,746 --> 00:05:31,214
The tickets read
"new york to southampton",

127
00:05:31,249 --> 00:05:34,350
but this old liner
is going somewhere else.

128
00:05:34,385 --> 00:05:38,104
The twilight zone.

129
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,718
Oh, alan, alan,
it's beautiful.

130
00:06:08,753 --> 00:06:10,586
It's urgent that schwimmer
get these reports tonight

131
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:13,089
or, at the latest,
early tomorrow morning
before the office opens.

132
00:06:13,124 --> 00:06:14,340
I'll call you
when i get to london.

133
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:15,591
What?

134
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:16,225
Well, it's beautiful.

135
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:19,345
Uh-uh, not it, madam,
she.

136
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,230
This ship happens
to be a lady.

137
00:06:21,265 --> 00:06:22,482
Oh, of course.

138
00:06:22,517 --> 00:06:23,733
Well, she's
beautiful.

139
00:06:23,768 --> 00:06:24,984
I'd say she's
beautiful.

140
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:26,235
From the
descriptions,

141
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,487
we'd expected
a cross between

142
00:06:27,522 --> 00:06:29,355
a kayak and
theflying dutchman.

143
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,240
You two seeing
somebody off?

144
00:06:31,275 --> 00:06:31,858
No, we're
passengers.

145
00:06:31,893 --> 00:06:33,109
What's that?
What?

146
00:06:33,144 --> 00:06:34,360
What-what
did you say?

147
00:06:34,395 --> 00:06:34,994
We're
passengers.

148
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:36,863
Oh, i hardly think so.
I don't think that...

149
00:06:36,898 --> 00:06:39,365
this is, this is
thelady anne.

150
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,616
There must be a mistake.

151
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:42,502
Toby, please,
i haven't kept you
waiting long enough

152
00:06:42,537 --> 00:06:43,753
to raise
your temper.
Come along.

153
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,621
Be quiet, millie.
You look at your tickets,

154
00:06:45,656 --> 00:06:47,507
and you'll find there's
been an error. I repeat,

155
00:06:47,542 --> 00:06:48,374
this is
thelady anne.

156
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:49,625
And i repeat,
we're passengers.

157
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:50,877
Let me have a look
at your tickets.

158
00:06:50,912 --> 00:06:52,128
Show me your tickets.
Why should i do that?

159
00:06:52,163 --> 00:06:53,012
I beg your pardon.
I'm sorry.

160
00:06:53,047 --> 00:06:54,263
Call it curiosity.

161
00:06:54,298 --> 00:06:55,515
Please, please,
let me have a look at them.

162
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:57,383
Go on.

163
00:06:57,418 --> 00:06:58,634
All right.

164
00:06:58,669 --> 00:06:59,769
Thank you.

165
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:07,276
"Mr. And mrs. Alan ransome,"
is that what it says?

166
00:07:07,311 --> 00:07:08,528
"New york, southampton."

167
00:07:08,563 --> 00:07:09,779
"Two one-way..."

168
00:07:09,814 --> 00:07:12,281
toby, toby, you're not gonna
reading the small print.

169
00:07:12,316 --> 00:07:13,533
These seem to be
in order, millie.

170
00:07:13,568 --> 00:07:15,284
Thank you. I'm glad
to know that.

171
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:18,538
No, but i tell you,
there's a mistake.
There's a mistake.

172
00:07:18,573 --> 00:07:20,406
This is what you might
call a private party,

173
00:07:20,441 --> 00:07:22,291
a private...
an excursion.

174
00:07:22,326 --> 00:07:24,160
A mistake.
A terrible mistake.

175
00:07:24,195 --> 00:07:26,045
Millie, millie,
come along, come along.

176
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,165
I guess that
means welcome
aboard in british.

177
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,050
Well, don't let him
get your back up.

178
00:07:31,085 --> 00:07:33,553
You'll be twice as cranky
when you're his age.

179
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:37,924
You can still
turn back, you know.

180
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:41,060
Just think of being cooped up
with me for 14 days.

181
00:07:41,095 --> 00:07:41,677
I made a promise,

182
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:42,929
i'm going to go
through with it.

183
00:07:42,964 --> 00:07:44,180
Isn't that
good enough?

184
00:07:44,215 --> 00:07:46,065
Sure, sure, sure.

185
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:55,441
At leasttry
to enjoy yourself.

186
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:00,446
One moment, please.

187
00:08:00,481 --> 00:08:01,080
Your names?

188
00:08:01,115 --> 00:08:02,331
Ransome.

189
00:08:02,366 --> 00:08:04,200
You want to see
our tickets, too?

190
00:08:04,235 --> 00:08:06,702
No, sir, that's quite
all right. Thank you.

191
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:07,954
State room 24

192
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:10,456
is down that flight
of stairs there

193
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:11,707
and to your left.

194
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:17,964
You're not going
to let him do this?

195
00:08:17,999 --> 00:08:20,466
I'm afraid it's out
of my hands, sir.

196
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:31,861
Come on, come on.

197
00:08:31,896 --> 00:08:33,729
Let's check the room,

198
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:34,981
see if they got
the luggage in.

199
00:08:35,016 --> 00:08:36,866
We're due to take off
in ten minutes.

200
00:08:36,901 --> 00:08:37,483
Take off?

201
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:39,368
Leave, sail.

202
00:08:39,403 --> 00:08:41,237
Depart.
Depart, depart.

203
00:08:52,248 --> 00:08:53,499
I don't believe it.

204
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:55,384
Oh, alan!

205
00:08:55,419 --> 00:08:58,504
Alan, isn't it marvelous?

206
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:02,258
Oh, alan, the bed!

207
00:09:02,293 --> 00:09:05,394
Oh, isn't it wonderful?

208
00:09:05,429 --> 00:09:07,897
Oh, and stairs! Look, you have
to go up and down to get in.

209
00:09:07,932 --> 00:09:10,399
This is probably the
most ridiculous room
in the whole world.

210
00:09:10,434 --> 00:09:12,902
Probably? Probably?!
It is!

211
00:09:12,937 --> 00:09:14,153
And you
like it, huh?

212
00:09:14,188 --> 00:09:16,022
Oh, yes, yes,

213
00:09:16,057 --> 00:09:17,273
i like it!

214
00:09:17,308 --> 00:09:18,524
Don't you?

215
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:19,775
No kidding.
Can we even take this

216
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,027
for two whole weeks?
I mean...

217
00:09:22,313 --> 00:09:22,912
alan, alan, the whistle!

218
00:09:22,947 --> 00:09:24,163
Come on, come on,
let's go up on deck.

219
00:09:24,198 --> 00:09:25,414
Why?
Why?

220
00:09:25,449 --> 00:09:27,283
Because that's
what people do.

221
00:09:27,318 --> 00:09:29,785
Haven't you ever
seen any movies?

222
00:09:35,424 --> 00:09:36,676
Here they are.

223
00:09:36,711 --> 00:09:39,045
Those are
the ones i mean-

224
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,930
they're coming with us.

225
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:43,432
Nonsense.

226
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:47,186
It's obviously
a silly blunder.

227
00:09:47,221 --> 00:09:49,055
I tell you, i've
seen their tickets.

228
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:50,940
All right,
keep calm.

229
00:09:50,975 --> 00:09:52,191
There's plenty
of time.

230
00:09:52,226 --> 00:09:54,060
I want
to see it

231
00:09:54,095 --> 00:09:55,945
from the
top deck.

232
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,196
You young people

233
00:09:57,231 --> 00:10:00,316
are probably
unaware of the fact

234
00:10:00,351 --> 00:10:01,567
that this is
a sort of, uh,

235
00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:04,070
private cruise.

236
00:10:04,105 --> 00:10:05,321
Yes.

237
00:10:05,356 --> 00:10:07,823
Quite... there must be

238
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:09,709
a slip-up somewhere.

239
00:10:09,744 --> 00:10:10,326
Oh, no.

240
00:10:10,361 --> 00:10:12,828
There hasn't been
any slip-up.

241
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,080
This is our ship

242
00:10:14,115 --> 00:10:15,965
and we're sailing
to europe on it.

243
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,833
Her.
Oh, her.

244
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:19,085
There you are, you see.

245
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,970
Oh, dear.

246
00:10:21,005 --> 00:10:23,472
This is very bad news indeed.

247
00:10:23,507 --> 00:10:25,341
Oh, really?

248
00:10:25,376 --> 00:10:27,226
This may sound
odd to you,

249
00:10:27,261 --> 00:10:29,095
but, really, we
want to help you.

250
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:32,231
Exactly. You see,
there are certain things

251
00:10:32,266 --> 00:10:33,482
you don't know about the ship.

252
00:10:33,517 --> 00:10:35,351
Now, what does that mean?

253
00:10:35,386 --> 00:10:39,739
Well, for instance,
it isn't generally known...

254
00:10:39,774 --> 00:10:41,607
no, no, no, careful, careful.

255
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:42,241
No, no, no.

256
00:10:42,276 --> 00:10:44,744
No, no, my dear gentleman,
i must tell them.

257
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:48,497
The ship is over 50 years old.

258
00:10:48,532 --> 00:10:50,366
Oh, we knew that.

259
00:10:50,401 --> 00:10:52,251
Oh, well, then, uh,

260
00:10:52,286 --> 00:10:54,120
possibly one or two things
you don't know

261
00:10:54,155 --> 00:10:55,371
because you haven't looked.

262
00:10:55,406 --> 00:10:57,256
She's falling apart.

263
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:59,125
Even the chairs...

264
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,627
they wouldn't bear
the weight of a baby.

265
00:11:01,662 --> 00:11:04,130
And the staircase, the
staircase- look at it-

266
00:11:04,165 --> 00:11:06,015
likely to collapse
any moment.

267
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:07,266
And the food- you
won't be able to eat it.

268
00:11:07,301 --> 00:11:08,517
It'll poison you,
you get to main.

269
00:11:08,552 --> 00:11:11,520
So you can see how impractical
the whole idea is, can't you?

270
00:11:11,555 --> 00:11:12,772
Uh-huh.

271
00:11:12,807 --> 00:11:14,640
Uh, there's just one thing.

272
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:15,891
Huh?

273
00:11:15,926 --> 00:11:18,394
If this is such an awfully
dangerous boat,

274
00:11:18,429 --> 00:11:20,279
what are you two doing on it?

275
00:11:20,314 --> 00:11:25,284
Uh, uh... oh, well, we're old
and eccentric.

276
00:11:25,319 --> 00:11:29,038
We're... young
and eccentric.

277
00:11:29,073 --> 00:11:31,540
We like
impractical things.

278
00:11:31,575 --> 00:11:32,158
And besides,
we think

279
00:11:32,193 --> 00:11:34,660
that this is
an absolutely
darling little boat.

280
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,797
That's the
last warning.

281
00:11:37,832 --> 00:11:39,665
They'll be taking the
gangplank down any moment.

282
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,168
You'll get seasick,
you know.

283
00:11:42,203 --> 00:11:43,419
No stabilizers.

284
00:11:43,454 --> 00:11:45,304
She rolls like an
old washing machine.

285
00:11:45,339 --> 00:11:46,555
Well, it sounds
like fun!

286
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:47,807
For pete's sake,
will you two gentlemen...

287
00:11:47,842 --> 00:11:49,058
just a moment, please.

288
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:52,928
Now, what's that for?

289
00:11:52,963 --> 00:11:55,431
I'm prepared to pay you double
the amount of your tickets

290
00:11:55,466 --> 00:11:56,682
if you'll abandon
your plans.

291
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:01,070
Well?

292
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:03,572
Not a chance.

293
00:12:03,607 --> 00:12:06,075
All right, then i'll
triple the amount.

294
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,943
No.

295
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:11,697
Mrs. Ransome, you're
driving me to extremes.

296
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:12,948
However, if you leave

297
00:12:12,983 --> 00:12:14,700
thelady annenow,

298
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:16,585
i'll give you
the equivalent

299
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,454
of 5,000
american dollars.

300
00:12:18,489 --> 00:12:19,705
And i'll
match that.

301
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,590
Making it a total
of 10,000.

302
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:24,343
Well, now you gentlemen
are talking my language.

303
00:12:24,378 --> 00:12:26,846
Shall we make it
an even 100,000?

304
00:12:28,097 --> 00:12:30,599
Good gracious, we don't
have that sort of money.

305
00:12:30,634 --> 00:12:31,851
Sorry, no deal.

306
00:12:31,886 --> 00:12:33,102
Oh, no, no,
please reconsider.

307
00:12:33,137 --> 00:12:34,970
You don't understand.

308
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:37,473
Now look,
my dear sir,

309
00:12:37,508 --> 00:12:39,358
ever since we
picked this tub,

310
00:12:39,393 --> 00:12:40,609
people have been
trying their best
to discourage us.

311
00:12:40,644 --> 00:12:41,861
I don't know why

312
00:12:41,896 --> 00:12:43,112
and i don't care.

313
00:12:43,147 --> 00:12:46,232
But if you're worried
that the brash americans

314
00:12:46,267 --> 00:12:49,368
are going to try to crash
your cozy little tea party,

315
00:12:49,403 --> 00:12:50,619
forget it.

316
00:12:50,654 --> 00:12:52,621
No, laddie,
it isn't that at all.

317
00:12:52,656 --> 00:12:53,873
Forget it.

318
00:12:53,908 --> 00:12:55,124
And leave us alone.

319
00:13:07,922 --> 00:13:11,006
You thought i'd take
the money, didn't you?

320
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,258
I honestly
didn't know.

321
00:13:12,293 --> 00:13:13,509
Oh, look, alan!

322
00:13:13,544 --> 00:13:16,645
We're off
to a great start.

323
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:28,157
Well...

324
00:13:28,192 --> 00:13:28,774
we tried.

325
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:30,659
We should have
tried harder.

326
00:13:30,694 --> 00:13:33,779
We should have
kept them off
this ship.

327
00:13:49,512 --> 00:13:50,763
Alan?

328
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:54,517
Alan?

329
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:57,887
Oh, alan.

330
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:05,394
What are you
doing up so early, hmm?

331
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:07,897
It's almost 11:00.

332
00:14:07,932 --> 00:14:10,399
So...?

333
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:21,544
Good morning.

334
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:28,667
Good morning.

335
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:40,679
All right.

336
00:14:41,931 --> 00:14:44,433
You're not getting nervous
already, are you?

337
00:14:44,468 --> 00:14:45,684
No.

338
00:14:46,936 --> 00:14:48,571
Come on, alan,
let's not let

339
00:14:48,606 --> 00:14:51,690
two cranky old men
spoil our honeymoon.

340
00:14:52,942 --> 00:14:53,576
How many?

341
00:14:53,611 --> 00:14:55,444
Hmm?

342
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:56,695
Get dressed.

343
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:59,198
Fire drill's
in 15 minutes.

344
00:15:12,962 --> 00:15:14,847
Oh, alan, i wish
you would tell me

345
00:15:14,882 --> 00:15:16,098
what this is all about.

346
00:15:16,133 --> 00:15:17,967
I feel as though i'm
climbing the scaffold

347
00:15:18,002 --> 00:15:19,218
on my way to my execut...

348
00:15:19,253 --> 00:15:21,720
all right, pay attention,
please.

349
00:15:23,606 --> 00:15:26,108
Call for fire
drill practice.

350
00:15:26,143 --> 00:15:28,477
Oh, alan.

351
00:15:29,111 --> 00:15:30,980
Now, see to it
that your straps

352
00:15:31,015 --> 00:15:33,482
are firmly pulled
across the chest and tied.

353
00:15:33,517 --> 00:15:38,487
And that the jackets
fit snugly across your body.

354
00:15:38,522 --> 00:15:42,241
Alan, you don't suppose
that everybody...

355
00:15:42,276 --> 00:15:43,492
everybody.

356
00:15:43,527 --> 00:15:44,743
I checked
this morning.

357
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:48,497
I didn't see
a person under 75.

358
00:15:48,532 --> 00:15:51,000
Oh, that's silly.

359
00:15:51,035 --> 00:15:52,885
It must just be the
first class section.

360
00:15:53,502 --> 00:15:56,639
There's only one section,
it's all first class.

361
00:15:56,674 --> 00:15:58,507
Do you mean that...

362
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:00,392
that they're the only...

363
00:16:00,427 --> 00:16:01,010
now, then...

364
00:16:01,045 --> 00:16:03,512
in the event
that the balloon

365
00:16:03,547 --> 00:16:04,146
should go up,

366
00:16:04,181 --> 00:16:06,515
the alarm will sound.

367
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:09,018
In a calm
and orderly fashion,

368
00:16:09,053 --> 00:16:10,903
you will don your belts-

369
00:16:10,938 --> 00:16:12,154
over there, please-

370
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:15,274
and assemble here,
"b" deck,

371
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:17,776
where you will await
further instructions.

372
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:20,279
Groups will be divided up
in the following manner:

373
00:16:20,314 --> 00:16:22,781
Group "a,"
mr. And mrs. Hunter small,

374
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:24,667
mr. And mrs. Mckenzie,

375
00:16:24,702 --> 00:16:27,169
mr. And mrs. Scott esprey...

376
00:16:27,204 --> 00:16:27,786
now, remember,
dear,

377
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:30,289
getting there
is half the fun.

378
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:55,314
Looks like we're
on time for the orgy.

379
00:16:55,349 --> 00:16:56,565
Shh.

380
00:16:59,068 --> 00:17:01,570
This isn't a boat,
it's a floating rest home.

381
00:17:01,605 --> 00:17:02,821
Alan.

382
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:04,073
Bartender.

383
00:17:04,108 --> 00:17:05,324
Could you fix us up

384
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,460
with a couple of
double martinis, very dry?

385
00:17:08,495 --> 00:17:10,963
Could i have one?

386
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:14,717
Alan?

387
00:17:14,752 --> 00:17:15,334
Hmm?

388
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:17,219
I'm sorry.

389
00:17:17,254 --> 00:17:19,722
I didn't know it
was going to be like...

390
00:17:19,757 --> 00:17:20,339
like this.

391
00:17:20,374 --> 00:17:21,590
Yeah.

392
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:24,093
No, i really
mean it.

393
00:17:24,128 --> 00:17:25,344
I am sorry.

394
00:17:26,595 --> 00:17:27,229
Listen, you know,

395
00:17:27,264 --> 00:17:29,098
it really doesn't make
that much difference.

396
00:17:29,133 --> 00:17:31,600
I mean, we really
didn't want to
meet anyone anyway.

397
00:17:31,635 --> 00:17:32,851
What we really wanted...

398
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:34,737
stop saying "we,"
will you?

399
00:17:34,772 --> 00:17:36,605
If you'd listened to me,

400
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,490
we'd be in london
right now.

401
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:40,359
Yeah, and you'd be at
a business conference.

402
00:17:40,394 --> 00:17:40,993
No.

403
00:17:41,028 --> 00:17:42,244
Yes.

404
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:43,495
Thank you.
Thank you.

405
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:49,752
And you would be
there the next day
and the day after.

406
00:17:49,787 --> 00:17:52,504
Oh, alan, that's what
this trip is all about.

407
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:54,373
Don't you see that?

408
00:17:56,258 --> 00:17:58,127
Look, i know you've
been unhappy.

409
00:17:58,162 --> 00:18:00,629
But do you think i enjoy
working 28 hours a day?

410
00:18:00,664 --> 00:18:03,766
Well, it comes to
the same thing, doesn't it?

411
00:18:03,801 --> 00:18:04,383
We never see each other,

412
00:18:04,418 --> 00:18:06,885
we never talk,
we never...

413
00:18:08,771 --> 00:18:10,639
look, i told you before

414
00:18:10,674 --> 00:18:12,524
right after
i put this deal across,

415
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:13,776
i'm going to start

416
00:18:13,811 --> 00:18:15,027
taking it easy.

417
00:18:15,062 --> 00:18:16,278
Oh, sure, sure.

418
00:18:16,313 --> 00:18:18,147
That's what you said
two years ago.

419
00:18:18,182 --> 00:18:21,283
And you put the deal across and
it didn't make any difference

420
00:18:21,318 --> 00:18:22,534
because there are always
more deals

421
00:18:22,569 --> 00:18:23,786
and there will always
be more deals

422
00:18:23,821 --> 00:18:26,288
because that's all that matters
to you anymore, isn't it?

423
00:18:26,323 --> 00:18:27,539
Isn't it?!

424
00:18:31,445 --> 00:18:33,295
Could i have
another drink, please?

425
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:35,164
You're supposed
to sip those things,

426
00:18:35,199 --> 00:18:36,415
not guzzle them down.

427
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,300
I'll tell you something,
i am so tired of begging

428
00:18:38,335 --> 00:18:40,169
for a little bit
of your time.

429
00:18:40,204 --> 00:18:42,671
You're not interested
in me anyway.

430
00:18:42,706 --> 00:18:43,922
You are interested
in success.

431
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:45,174
You have to fight
to get to the top,

432
00:18:45,209 --> 00:18:46,425
and then you have to
fight to stay there.

433
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,676
And you just fight,
fight, fight.

434
00:18:47,711 --> 00:18:48,927
Stop making a scene.
Why?

435
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:50,813
Does it take your mind off
mergers and board meetings?

436
00:18:50,848 --> 00:18:52,064
No, it takes my mind
off the fact

437
00:18:52,099 --> 00:18:53,315
that i was supposed to be

438
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:55,184
taking a trip
and having a good time.

439
00:18:55,219 --> 00:18:56,435
Oh, come on, alan,

440
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:59,571
you took me on this trip
because i asked to be taken,

441
00:18:59,606 --> 00:19:00,189
that's all.

442
00:19:00,224 --> 00:19:02,074
Otherwise, you would
have gone alone.

443
00:19:02,109 --> 00:19:02,691
Now, isn't that right?

444
00:19:03,325 --> 00:19:03,942
I want you to admit that.

445
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:05,194
Isn't that right?
Isn't that the truth?

446
00:19:05,229 --> 00:19:06,445
I cannot talk to you
when you act like this.

447
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,947
I cannot talk to you.

448
00:19:12,736 --> 00:19:14,586
You don't care about me anymore.

449
00:19:17,706 --> 00:19:20,209
Oh, i was really stupid

450
00:19:20,244 --> 00:19:22,094
to think that, uh,
that a few days alone

451
00:19:22,129 --> 00:19:24,596
was going to make
any difference.

452
00:19:24,631 --> 00:19:27,099
Oh, you are
a flaming success now.

453
00:19:27,134 --> 00:19:30,219
Alan ransome,
the successful financier.

454
00:19:30,853 --> 00:19:33,972
And i am your nagging wife
who doesn't understand.

455
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:35,224
Oh, what's the matter, alan?

456
00:19:35,259 --> 00:19:36,475
Don't get nervous.

457
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:38,360
You think they're
going to catch on?

458
00:19:38,395 --> 00:19:39,611
They'll be like
everyone else.

459
00:19:39,646 --> 00:19:40,479
They'll think that we're

460
00:19:40,514 --> 00:19:42,364
a happily married couple
just made for each...

461
00:19:42,399 --> 00:19:43,615
just shut up, just shut up!

462
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,484
Oh, yes, sir,

463
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:46,735
yes, sir, yes, sir!

464
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:52,374
Well...

465
00:19:52,409 --> 00:19:55,494
you can stop worrying

466
00:19:55,529 --> 00:20:00,499
because when this tub
finally gets there...

467
00:20:00,534 --> 00:20:02,384
you can relax...

468
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:06,138
because i'm going to leave.

469
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,509
That might be a good idea.

470
00:20:10,544 --> 00:20:12,394
Well, it is.

471
00:20:12,429 --> 00:20:13,645
It is a good idea.

472
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,514
And then you'll have

473
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:18,016
all your business deals
to keep you warm

474
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,519
and you won't have any
silly woman picking at you.

475
00:20:20,554 --> 00:20:23,021
Now, won't that
be marvelous, huh?

476
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:24,907
Yes.

477
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:27,409
Yes, it will be.

478
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:50,299
Mr. Ransome...

479
00:20:50,334 --> 00:20:52,184
excuse me.

480
00:20:52,219 --> 00:20:53,435
What for this time?

481
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:54,686
Oh, millie...

482
00:20:54,721 --> 00:20:56,555
oh, mrs. Ransome,
i didn't see you.

483
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:59,057
We were wondering
whether you cared to join us

484
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:00,943
for a cup of tea
this afternoon

485
00:21:00,978 --> 00:21:01,560
and a chat, perhaps.

486
00:21:01,595 --> 00:21:02,811
No, uh, i don't
think so.

487
00:21:02,846 --> 00:21:04,062
Yes, yes,

488
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:05,564
of course, we'd be delighted.

489
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:06,815
It's at 4:00, isn't it?

490
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:09,568
Yes, 4:00
at the imperial lounge.

491
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:11,453
All right,
we'll see you then.

492
00:21:11,488 --> 00:21:13,322
Good, good.
Come along,
millie.

493
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:18,327
Why did you do that?

494
00:21:18,362 --> 00:21:22,080
Because you and i have nothing
more to say to each other,

495
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:25,834
and you said it yourself,
we're gonna be stuck together

496
00:21:25,869 --> 00:21:27,085
for a whole week,

497
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:31,473
so we might as well call a truce
and make the best of it.

498
00:21:31,508 --> 00:21:32,724
Okay?

499
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:34,593
Okay.

500
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,986
"Housey housey."

501
00:21:44,021 --> 00:21:46,488
Sounds funsy-wunsy,
doesn't it?

502
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:56,248
Oh, here they are, millie.

503
00:21:56,283 --> 00:21:58,116
Come on,
mr. And mrs. Ransome.

504
00:21:58,151 --> 00:21:59,368
Tea's ready,
the kettle's boiling.

505
00:21:59,403 --> 00:22:01,253
Come and sit down.
Thank you.

506
00:22:01,288 --> 00:22:03,121
So glad you could
make it.

507
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:05,624
It's nice of you
to have tea with us.

508
00:22:05,659 --> 00:22:06,875
Well, it's
our pleasure.

509
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:08,760
I don't know if you've really
met my wife, have you?

510
00:22:08,795 --> 00:22:10,629
Millie,
mr. And mrs. Ransome.

511
00:22:10,664 --> 00:22:12,514
Hello.
Hello.

512
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:18,770
I'll have another cup of tea,
old girl, if i may.

513
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:23,775
Nasty day, i'm afraid.

514
00:22:26,144 --> 00:22:29,781
Now, then, the reason why
we asked you to have
a cup of tea with us

515
00:22:29,816 --> 00:22:32,284
apart, of course, from having
the pleasure of your company

516
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:33,535
was because...

517
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:34,786
millie- mrs. Mckenzie-

518
00:22:34,821 --> 00:22:37,906
thought we'd been
a little inhospitable,

519
00:22:37,941 --> 00:22:39,157
a little standoffish,

520
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:40,409
rude, rude...

521
00:22:40,444 --> 00:22:43,545
so, i expect i ought
to apologize.

522
00:22:44,162 --> 00:22:45,547
Do you, mr. Mckenzie?

523
00:22:45,582 --> 00:22:47,049
I beg your pardon,
do i...?

524
00:22:47,084 --> 00:22:49,551
Apologize? Yes, of course,
most sincerely.

525
00:22:49,586 --> 00:22:50,168
Now, another thing-

526
00:22:50,203 --> 00:22:52,054
great news, great news.
Very important,

527
00:22:52,089 --> 00:22:53,305
since we've been
talking it over

528
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,173
millie and old burgess
and the rest of us

529
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:56,425
and we've come to the conclusion

530
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,927
that you won't have to leave
the ship after all.

531
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:03,932
Oh, we won't have...

532
00:23:03,967 --> 00:23:05,817
oh, say, that is
good news.

533
00:23:05,852 --> 00:23:07,686
We were afraid
we'd have to swim back

534
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:08,937
and that had us
sick with worry.

535
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,325
Oh, my dear fel...
he thought he'd got to swim.

536
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,827
Oh, we'd never allow that.
Of course we wouldn't.

537
00:23:15,862 --> 00:23:18,330
But we were a little bit
embarrassed, you know,

538
00:23:18,365 --> 00:23:20,198
because it never entered
our heads

539
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:22,084
that any stranger- outsider-

540
00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:23,952
would want to travel
on thelady anne.

541
00:23:23,987 --> 00:23:25,203
You see, primarily
she's a cruise ship,

542
00:23:25,238 --> 00:23:27,706
and last time she picked up
a new passenger

543
00:23:27,741 --> 00:23:29,591
was, according
to captain protheroe...

544
00:23:29,626 --> 00:23:31,460
have you met
the captain?

545
00:23:31,495 --> 00:23:32,344
According to him,

546
00:23:32,379 --> 00:23:34,212
the last time they picked up
a new passenger

547
00:23:34,247 --> 00:23:36,098
was the summer of '48.

548
00:23:36,133 --> 00:23:36,715
So, you see...

549
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:40,469
well, no need
to fuss, is there?

550
00:23:40,504 --> 00:23:41,720
Because everything's
settled now.

551
00:23:41,755 --> 00:23:44,222
What's all settled?

552
00:23:44,257 --> 00:23:46,224
What my husband is trying to say

553
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:49,978
is that you won't
have to die, after all.

554
00:24:03,792 --> 00:24:08,163
Twilight zonewill continue
after station identification.

555
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:24,646
What did you say?

556
00:24:24,681 --> 00:24:27,766
I said you won't
have to die after all.

557
00:24:29,651 --> 00:24:32,771
Of boredom, millie means.
Don't you, dear?

558
00:24:32,806 --> 00:24:34,022
Oh!

559
00:24:34,057 --> 00:24:36,525
Yes, of course. Yes.

560
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:40,912
I'm afraid we haven't been
very good company so far.

561
00:24:40,947 --> 00:24:44,166
Well, no. No, frankly...
frankly, you haven't.

562
00:24:44,201 --> 00:24:46,034
Oh, please
forgive us.

563
00:24:46,069 --> 00:24:48,537
You see, the fact is
that old millie and i

564
00:24:48,572 --> 00:24:51,673
have spent many fine hours
on this old scow.

565
00:24:51,708 --> 00:24:53,542
Hours one can't

566
00:24:53,577 --> 00:24:55,177
forget easily.

567
00:24:55,212 --> 00:24:57,679
When we heard
they were going
to retire her,

568
00:24:57,714 --> 00:24:58,930
we joined her

569
00:24:58,965 --> 00:25:01,933
for her last
two-way sailing.

570
00:25:01,968 --> 00:25:03,185
It's true
of the others.

571
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:05,687
That's why there's so many
old parties on board.

572
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,689
Oh.

573
00:25:07,724 --> 00:25:08,940
Well, we didn't
understand.

574
00:25:08,975 --> 00:25:11,560
And they still
don't understand.

575
00:25:11,595 --> 00:25:12,811
Some more tea?

576
00:25:12,846 --> 00:25:13,695
It's very refreshing.

577
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:14,946
Yes, thank you.

578
00:25:14,981 --> 00:25:16,198
One thing
hasn't changed:

579
00:25:16,233 --> 00:25:18,450
It's still the best
cup of tea in the world.

580
00:25:18,485 --> 00:25:20,068
What about
all the others?

581
00:25:20,103 --> 00:25:21,069
Well, as i said

582
00:25:21,104 --> 00:25:23,572
same reason
as ourselves, really.

583
00:25:23,607 --> 00:25:24,823
Sentiment, you know.

584
00:25:24,858 --> 00:25:26,074
Of course they know.

585
00:25:26,109 --> 00:25:27,959
Why should they choose
thelady anne?

586
00:25:27,994 --> 00:25:30,462
Blessed if i know.

587
00:25:30,497 --> 00:25:33,215
Well, it isn't really
such a different story.

588
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:34,466
Sentiment.

589
00:25:34,501 --> 00:25:37,085
There are different
kinds of sentiment.

590
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,837
Partly, it was because

591
00:25:38,872 --> 00:25:41,973
alan i haven't really
been alone in six years.

592
00:25:42,008 --> 00:25:44,476
Excuse me. I'm going
to get us a drink.

593
00:25:45,093 --> 00:25:46,478
Good idea.

594
00:25:46,513 --> 00:25:48,346
Scotch all around?

595
00:25:48,381 --> 00:25:50,849
No, not for me, thank you.

596
00:25:50,884 --> 00:25:51,733
Excuse me.

597
00:25:55,353 --> 00:25:57,856
He's embarrassed,
isn't he?

598
00:25:57,891 --> 00:26:02,861
I'm doing that to him
all the time lately.

599
00:26:02,896 --> 00:26:05,614
You said that you two
hadn't been alone.

600
00:26:05,649 --> 00:26:07,866
No, no, uh...

601
00:26:07,901 --> 00:26:11,620
alan is a very busy man.

602
00:26:11,655 --> 00:26:12,871
Anyway, when he told me

603
00:26:12,906 --> 00:26:16,007
he was going to england
on business,

604
00:26:16,042 --> 00:26:16,625
i made him promise
to take me,

605
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:20,378
whichever way
i decided to go.

606
00:26:20,413 --> 00:26:22,881
But why did you choose
thelady anne?

607
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:26,134
Well, uh, i guess
it was time, really.

608
00:26:26,169 --> 00:26:29,271
You know, more time
to be alone together.

609
00:26:29,306 --> 00:26:32,390
I don't know.
It just seemed... special.

610
00:26:32,425 --> 00:26:34,893
Oh, my dear,
she is special.

611
00:26:34,928 --> 00:26:36,144
Much more special

612
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:38,647
than you and your husband
could ever imagine.

613
00:26:38,682 --> 00:26:39,898
Well, for one thing,

614
00:26:39,933 --> 00:26:43,034
toby and i sailed on her
when we got married.

615
00:26:43,069 --> 00:26:45,537
That was, um,
52 years ago.

616
00:26:45,572 --> 00:26:47,405
53, as a matter
of fact.

617
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,908
Oh, you should have
seen her then-

618
00:26:49,943 --> 00:26:51,793
splendid specimen, she was.

619
00:26:51,828 --> 00:26:53,044
The ship i mean,
not old...

620
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:54,913
oh, toby, really.

621
00:26:54,948 --> 00:26:57,916
I thought you told me
it was an old rust bucket.

622
00:26:57,951 --> 00:27:01,419
Not it, dear.
She, she, she.

623
00:27:01,454 --> 00:27:02,671
Did i say that?

624
00:27:02,706 --> 00:27:05,173
I should have been
struck by lightning

625
00:27:05,208 --> 00:27:06,424
for such a fearful lie.

626
00:27:06,459 --> 00:27:08,310
Do you know thelady anne

627
00:27:08,345 --> 00:27:10,178
was the fairest boat
that ever crossed the seas?

628
00:27:10,213 --> 00:27:12,681
Queen of the fleet,
she was.

629
00:27:12,716 --> 00:27:13,315
Is, old boy.

630
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:14,432
Is.

631
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:16,318
No other ship
can touch her.

632
00:27:16,353 --> 00:27:17,569
I beg your pardon.
Quite right.

633
00:27:17,604 --> 00:27:19,187
Oh, this
is old ian burgess.

634
00:27:19,821 --> 00:27:21,189
You haven't met
him properly.

635
00:27:21,224 --> 00:27:21,823
Mrs. Ransome.

636
00:27:21,858 --> 00:27:23,692
How do you do?

637
00:27:23,727 --> 00:27:26,828
Well, don't stand there
like a ninny.

638
00:27:26,863 --> 00:27:28,580
Sit yourself down.

639
00:27:28,615 --> 00:27:30,448
Please go on.

640
00:27:30,483 --> 00:27:32,951
You were telling me
how special she is.

641
00:27:32,986 --> 00:27:33,952
"She," she said.

642
00:27:33,987 --> 00:27:35,203
Did you hear?

643
00:27:35,238 --> 00:27:35,837
Good show.

644
00:27:36,454 --> 00:27:37,088
Congratulations.

645
00:27:37,123 --> 00:27:40,208
She was the only one,
mrs. Ransome.

646
00:27:40,243 --> 00:27:41,459
She specialized...
oh, no

647
00:27:41,494 --> 00:27:43,962
existedfor
honeymooners.

648
00:27:43,997 --> 00:27:45,213
Her cargo:

649
00:27:45,248 --> 00:27:47,098
Young people in love.

650
00:27:47,133 --> 00:27:48,967
Yes. Your presence...

651
00:27:49,002 --> 00:27:50,218
oh, here he is.

652
00:27:50,253 --> 00:27:51,469
Come and sit around here.
Can you manage?

653
00:27:51,504 --> 00:27:52,721
Mm-hmm.

654
00:27:52,756 --> 00:27:55,857
Your presence on board
is so ironic.

655
00:27:55,892 --> 00:27:56,858
No, that's not the word.

656
00:27:56,893 --> 00:27:58,109
Not ironic. What's the word?

657
00:27:58,144 --> 00:27:59,361
Sweet.

658
00:27:59,396 --> 00:27:59,978
No, that isn't it.

659
00:28:00,013 --> 00:28:01,229
Doesn't matter.

660
00:28:01,264 --> 00:28:02,480
The fact is

661
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:07,485
this ship was a regular
floating wedding barge.

662
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,988
No one on board except
young married couples

663
00:28:10,023 --> 00:28:12,490
full of juice,
and the moon in their eyes.

664
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:14,376
Oh, dear me,
you'd have laughed.

665
00:28:14,411 --> 00:28:15,627
It was funny
to see them

666
00:28:15,662 --> 00:28:16,878
pretending they'd
been married for years,

667
00:28:16,913 --> 00:28:18,129
acting as if
they were grown up,

668
00:28:18,164 --> 00:28:19,998
and all the time
nervous as kittens.

669
00:28:20,033 --> 00:28:21,249
Remember, burgess?

670
00:28:21,284 --> 00:28:24,002
Of course i do.

671
00:28:24,037 --> 00:28:25,253
But all the nervousness
vanished

672
00:28:25,288 --> 00:28:27,756
once thelady anne
had given them enough time

673
00:28:27,791 --> 00:28:28,506
to know each other.

674
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:30,392
She was such
a wise lady.

675
00:28:30,427 --> 00:28:32,260
She understood
these things.

676
00:28:32,295 --> 00:28:35,013
Everything was done
for young people.

677
00:28:35,048 --> 00:28:35,897
I expect,
to the others,

678
00:28:35,932 --> 00:28:38,400
the ship seemed
a bit ridiculous.

679
00:28:38,435 --> 00:28:40,902
Love has its own
particular
point of view.

680
00:28:40,937 --> 00:28:42,771
It sees everything
larger than life.

681
00:28:42,806 --> 00:28:45,907
Nothing is too ornate,
too fanciful, too dramatic.

682
00:28:46,524 --> 00:28:48,526
Love demands the theatrical.

683
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:51,029
And then transfigures it.

684
00:28:51,064 --> 00:28:54,783
It turns the grotesque
into the lovely,

685
00:28:54,818 --> 00:28:56,668
as a child does.

686
00:28:56,703 --> 00:29:01,039
With it, we can see
what we wish to see
in other people.

687
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:04,292
Without it, we can't see
anything at all.

688
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:10,682
We can search forever
and never find.

689
00:29:10,717 --> 00:29:13,802
How a shipping company ever had
that particular point of view

690
00:29:13,837 --> 00:29:15,053
i cannot imagine.

691
00:29:15,088 --> 00:29:19,441
But they turned thelady anne
into an enchanted gondola

692
00:29:19,476 --> 00:29:21,559
and took
that moment of happiness

693
00:29:21,594 --> 00:29:25,947
and made it live for two
unspeakably wonderful weeks.

694
00:29:25,982 --> 00:29:28,450
They get the drift, millie.

695
00:29:28,485 --> 00:29:30,318
No need to go all sticky on us.

696
00:29:31,453 --> 00:29:33,321
I feel sticky.

697
00:29:33,356 --> 00:29:36,074
Yes, we all
love this ship.

698
00:29:36,109 --> 00:29:38,576
When we heard she was
going to be retired,

699
00:29:38,611 --> 00:29:39,828
we thought it
only right

700
00:29:39,863 --> 00:29:42,330
to join her on
her last journey.

701
00:29:42,365 --> 00:29:46,084
Most people are here
for the same reason.

702
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:47,335
Major jones
is just behind me-

703
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:49,838
the bald man-

704
00:29:50,472 --> 00:29:51,089
with his wife.

705
00:29:51,124 --> 00:29:52,841
He was an engineer

706
00:29:52,876 --> 00:29:55,343
and a very good one,
in his day.

707
00:29:56,978 --> 00:29:58,847
And the couple
on the left there-

708
00:29:58,882 --> 00:30:00,598
the whiteaways-
charming couple.

709
00:30:00,633 --> 00:30:01,850
They were married
on the ship

710
00:30:01,885 --> 00:30:04,736
41 years ago
tomorrow.

711
00:30:05,353 --> 00:30:06,604
Oh.

712
00:30:06,639 --> 00:30:08,857
The chap sitting
over there alone

713
00:30:08,892 --> 00:30:11,359
is otto champion,

714
00:30:11,394 --> 00:30:11,993
the writer.

715
00:30:12,028 --> 00:30:13,745
Surely you've heard
about him?

716
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:16,114
We used to call him
otto of roses.

717
00:30:16,149 --> 00:30:17,999
Such a one with the ladies.

718
00:30:18,034 --> 00:30:20,502
You wouldn't think so

719
00:30:20,537 --> 00:30:21,870
to look at the old chap now,
would you?

720
00:30:21,905 --> 00:30:22,871
He's a widower.

721
00:30:23,505 --> 00:30:25,373
His wife died in '28

722
00:30:25,408 --> 00:30:26,624
uh, no, '29.

723
00:30:26,659 --> 00:30:29,511
'29, that's right.

724
00:30:29,546 --> 00:30:31,379
The day trigo
won the derby.

725
00:30:31,414 --> 00:30:32,630
What are you talking about?

726
00:30:32,665 --> 00:30:33,882
She died in '33,

727
00:30:34,516 --> 00:30:36,384
the year hyperion
won the derby.

728
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:38,887
Oh, anyway, it was
round about that time.

729
00:30:38,922 --> 00:30:41,389
Good heavens, look.
There's old lord bristol.

730
00:30:41,424 --> 00:30:42,774
He can hardly walk.

731
00:30:42,809 --> 00:30:44,025
Is he alone?

732
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,276
Decent sort
of fellow.

733
00:30:45,311 --> 00:30:46,528
Yes, i'm afraid
he is. Yes.

734
00:30:46,563 --> 00:30:50,899
What about you,
mr. Burgess?

735
00:30:50,934 --> 00:30:52,150
The same.

736
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,291
She's lovely.

737
00:31:00,326 --> 00:31:02,794
We intended to do
this trip together

738
00:31:02,829 --> 00:31:04,045
but, uh...

739
00:31:10,051 --> 00:31:11,920
oh, no, my dear.

740
00:31:11,955 --> 00:31:13,421
Please.
I'm so sorry.

741
00:31:13,456 --> 00:31:15,173
No, i'm sorry.

742
00:31:15,208 --> 00:31:17,675
We'll be together
again soon.

743
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:18,927
I'm sorry.

744
00:31:18,962 --> 00:31:20,178
It's all right,
my dear.

745
00:31:20,213 --> 00:31:21,429
Nothing matters

746
00:31:21,464 --> 00:31:22,680
if you're in love.

747
00:31:22,715 --> 00:31:25,183
You are in love,
aren't you?

748
00:31:29,571 --> 00:31:31,439
Yes... of course.

749
00:31:31,474 --> 00:31:33,942
Well, that's all
that matters.

750
00:31:36,077 --> 00:31:37,328
Are you better now, dear?

751
00:31:37,946 --> 00:31:39,197
Yes, yes, i'm...

752
00:31:40,448 --> 00:31:42,333
i'm sorry.

753
00:31:42,368 --> 00:31:43,585
It's quite
all right.

754
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:46,087
I cry myself
sometimes,

755
00:31:46,122 --> 00:31:47,705
don't i, toby?

756
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:48,957
Sometimes?
All the time.

757
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:50,208
Oh, no.

758
00:31:50,243 --> 00:31:50,959
Well, i don't.

759
00:31:50,994 --> 00:31:52,844
It depresses me.

760
00:31:52,879 --> 00:31:55,096
I say, why don't you two
go get some fresh air?

761
00:31:55,131 --> 00:31:57,599
It'll do you good.

762
00:31:57,634 --> 00:31:58,850
Thank you
so much.

763
00:32:41,643 --> 00:32:45,396
Now what's going on?

764
00:32:45,431 --> 00:32:47,265
Hmm?

765
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,516
The, uh, sun.

766
00:32:51,653 --> 00:32:53,521
Well, what about it?

767
00:32:53,556 --> 00:32:56,024
It's, uh... behind us.

768
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,165
So... it's behind us.

769
00:33:04,782 --> 00:33:07,285
Well, it was
over there yesterday.

770
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:11,039
That means
we're heading north.

771
00:33:11,074 --> 00:33:12,924
So we're heading north.

772
00:33:18,546 --> 00:33:21,049
We should be
heading east.

773
00:33:21,683 --> 00:33:23,551
Blame it on me.

774
00:33:23,586 --> 00:33:25,436
I'm responsible
for everything else.

775
00:33:25,471 --> 00:33:27,939
Why not this?

776
00:33:36,698 --> 00:33:37,949
I don't know what i'm doing

777
00:33:37,984 --> 00:33:39,817
on this crazy boat.

778
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,822
Really, eileen,
this is ridiculous.

779
00:33:46,074 --> 00:33:46,708
Eileen?

780
00:33:48,576 --> 00:33:49,827
Where are you, eileen?

781
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:12,600
Eileen?

782
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:16,988
Eileen?

783
00:34:20,108 --> 00:34:21,993
Oh, for pete's sake.

784
00:34:31,619 --> 00:34:32,870
Oh, i'm sorry.

785
00:34:32,905 --> 00:34:34,122
Something wrong?

786
00:34:34,157 --> 00:34:35,373
Have you seen eileen?

787
00:34:35,408 --> 00:34:36,624
I can't find her.

788
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:38,626
No. Haven't you?

789
00:34:38,661 --> 00:34:39,877
No. We were...

790
00:34:39,912 --> 00:34:41,129
we were

791
00:34:41,164 --> 00:34:42,380
standing over here

792
00:34:42,415 --> 00:34:44,265
and, uh, uh, she...

793
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:46,134
she was right behind me,
and i...

794
00:34:46,169 --> 00:34:48,019
you don't think anything
happened to her?

795
00:34:48,054 --> 00:34:51,139
I doubt it. It's not
easy to fall overboard.

796
00:34:51,174 --> 00:34:53,024
She may be looking
for you even now.

797
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:06,537
Have you seen her?

798
00:35:06,572 --> 00:35:09,040
Sorry, sir, but
i wouldn't worry
if i were you.

799
00:35:09,075 --> 00:35:10,291
Where's the captain?

800
00:35:10,326 --> 00:35:12,160
I want to have
this ship searched.

801
00:35:12,195 --> 00:35:14,045
Captain protheroe
is extremely
busy, sir.

802
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:17,165
I've already taken
the liberty of
alerting the crew.

803
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,416
Have you tried
the library?

804
00:35:32,814 --> 00:35:34,682
Eileen!

805
00:35:35,933 --> 00:35:38,436
Eileen!

806
00:35:38,471 --> 00:35:40,321
Have you found her?

807
00:35:40,356 --> 00:35:41,572
Beg pardon, sir?

808
00:35:41,607 --> 00:35:43,441
My wife. Have
you found her?
You were searching.

809
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:45,326
No, sir.

810
00:36:33,741 --> 00:36:35,626
Not turned up yet?

811
00:36:36,878 --> 00:36:38,129
In that case,
why not...

812
00:36:38,164 --> 00:36:40,631
why not let's go
and have a drink, eh?

813
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,385
Come along, my boy.

814
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:54,762
Two whiskeys, please.

815
00:36:54,797 --> 00:36:57,899
Better make 'em
large ones.

816
00:36:57,934 --> 00:36:59,150
Thank you.

817
00:36:59,185 --> 00:37:01,652
Now, then...

818
00:37:01,687 --> 00:37:02,270
ah!

819
00:37:04,772 --> 00:37:06,657
She's gone.

820
00:37:06,692 --> 00:37:08,526
No, she hasn't really.
It just seems like that.

821
00:37:08,561 --> 00:37:11,028
But you've missed her.
That's all, my boy.

822
00:37:11,662 --> 00:37:12,914
A toast...

823
00:37:12,949 --> 00:37:14,782
to thelady anne.

824
00:37:14,817 --> 00:37:18,536
The finest and loveliest ship
that ever sailed the seas.

825
00:37:20,456 --> 00:37:21,038
Thelady anne.

826
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:29,931
It's a pity what's
going to happen.

827
00:37:29,966 --> 00:37:31,182
It isn't a pity.

828
00:37:32,433 --> 00:37:33,050
It's a crime!

829
00:37:34,971 --> 00:37:36,804
A crime perpetrated

830
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:38,689
by stupid men in bow ties.

831
00:37:38,724 --> 00:37:40,558
Now, now,
easy, burgess.

832
00:37:40,593 --> 00:37:42,443
Nothing to get
overheated about.

833
00:37:42,478 --> 00:37:43,694
Nothing?

834
00:37:44,312 --> 00:37:45,563
Are you so...

835
00:37:45,598 --> 00:37:46,814
so feebleminded

836
00:37:46,849 --> 00:37:48,699
that you can't see the truth?

837
00:37:49,317 --> 00:37:49,951
Don't you realize

838
00:37:49,986 --> 00:37:51,819
why they're going to
scrap thelady anne?

839
00:37:51,854 --> 00:37:54,322
Outlived her usefulness,
i suppose.

840
00:37:54,357 --> 00:37:55,573
Oh, nonsense.

841
00:37:55,608 --> 00:37:57,458
She's the finest
ship afloat.

842
00:37:57,493 --> 00:37:58,709
You deny it?

843
00:37:58,744 --> 00:37:59,961
Certainly not.

844
00:37:59,996 --> 00:38:01,212
Oh.

845
00:38:01,247 --> 00:38:04,215
She may be
a little slow, perhaps,

846
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:06,717
but... 13 or 14 days

847
00:38:06,752 --> 00:38:07,969
ought to be quite fast enough

848
00:38:08,004 --> 00:38:10,471
for anyone in their right minds.

849
00:38:10,506 --> 00:38:11,722
That's just it.

850
00:38:11,757 --> 00:38:14,225
People aren't in
their right minds anymore.

851
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:16,594
They sacrifice leisure
for speed.

852
00:38:16,629 --> 00:38:19,096
And speed's the only thing
that matters.

853
00:38:19,131 --> 00:38:20,348
Come, quick,
hurry, hurry, hurry.

854
00:38:20,383 --> 00:38:21,599
Fast, faster, faster.

855
00:38:21,634 --> 00:38:22,850
Get it over with.

856
00:38:22,885 --> 00:38:25,236
Why the rush?

857
00:38:25,353 --> 00:38:27,238
Don't get so querulous,
old man.

858
00:38:27,273 --> 00:38:28,489
It's bad for you.

859
00:38:28,524 --> 00:38:29,106
I am not querulous.

860
00:38:29,141 --> 00:38:30,358
I am merely trying
to point out

861
00:38:30,393 --> 00:38:31,609
the true reason

862
00:38:31,644 --> 00:38:33,494
for this disgraceful
decision.

863
00:38:33,529 --> 00:38:34,745
Which is?

864
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:35,363
A plot...

865
00:38:35,398 --> 00:38:38,499
obviously
of communistic origin.

866
00:38:39,116 --> 00:38:42,253
They're going to condemn
thelady anne

867
00:38:42,288 --> 00:38:43,504
because she represents
a way of life.

868
00:38:43,539 --> 00:38:44,755
The old way.

869
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:47,258
She has grace, manners,

870
00:38:47,293 --> 00:38:49,377
tradition.

871
00:38:49,412 --> 00:38:50,628
And now they're going
to scrap her.

872
00:38:50,663 --> 00:38:51,879
Oh, i say!

873
00:38:51,914 --> 00:38:54,382
Somebody turn
him off.

874
00:38:54,417 --> 00:38:56,267
Nothing is sacred anymore.

875
00:38:56,302 --> 00:39:00,021
The beasts are at the gates,
but we're too old to fight,

876
00:39:00,137 --> 00:39:03,274
so we have to stand around
like pathetic statues,

877
00:39:03,309 --> 00:39:05,776
with our medals tarnished
and our swords broken,

878
00:39:05,811 --> 00:39:09,530
while the vandals turn
our castles into sideshows

879
00:39:09,565 --> 00:39:12,650
and stick up nasty
little advertisements for soap

880
00:39:12,685 --> 00:39:13,901
all along the roadside.

881
00:39:14,151 --> 00:39:17,288
And now they're going
to scrap thelady anne.

882
00:39:17,323 --> 00:39:18,539
But i warn you,

883
00:39:18,574 --> 00:39:23,544
how are we going to stop them
from scrapping the whole world?

884
00:39:29,166 --> 00:39:31,052
Poor old boy.
You mustn't blame him.

885
00:39:31,087 --> 00:39:34,171
He'd planned to make
this trip with his wife.

886
00:39:34,206 --> 00:39:36,674
And then, a few weeks ago,
she had to go

887
00:39:36,709 --> 00:39:38,809
and die on him,
poor old boy.

888
00:39:38,844 --> 00:39:41,312
Well, we'll have
the party tomorrow night.

889
00:39:41,562 --> 00:39:43,431
Yes.
He may feel
better then.

890
00:39:43,466 --> 00:39:45,933
Another drink,
mr. Ransome?

891
00:39:45,968 --> 00:39:47,184
No? All right.

892
00:40:21,969 --> 00:40:23,220
Drinking alone?

893
00:40:27,608 --> 00:40:30,111
Where have you been?

894
00:40:30,146 --> 00:40:31,362
I've been looking
all over for you.

895
00:40:31,397 --> 00:40:32,613
I've been here, alan.

896
00:40:32,648 --> 00:40:33,864
But i look...

897
00:40:45,126 --> 00:40:46,994
oh, alan.

898
00:40:47,029 --> 00:40:48,879
Alan, you must be drunk.

899
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:52,633
No.

900
00:40:52,668 --> 00:40:54,502
I'm not drunk.

901
00:41:08,265 --> 00:41:10,151
Where did this
come from?

902
00:41:10,186 --> 00:41:12,019
Mrs. Mckenzie
gave it to me.

903
00:41:12,054 --> 00:41:15,156
She wore it
on her honeymoon.

904
00:41:15,191 --> 00:41:17,658
Do you like it?

905
00:41:17,693 --> 00:41:18,909
It's beautiful.

906
00:41:19,527 --> 00:41:22,029
And you're beautiful.

907
00:41:25,166 --> 00:41:26,417
Oh, alan

908
00:41:26,452 --> 00:41:29,537
alan, what happened?

909
00:41:30,788 --> 00:41:32,039
I don't know
what happened.

910
00:41:32,074 --> 00:41:34,542
But i'm going
to try very hard

911
00:41:34,577 --> 00:41:36,427
not to forget it.

912
00:41:40,181 --> 00:41:41,432
See that?

913
00:41:57,064 --> 00:41:58,949
What have you
got there, dear?

914
00:41:58,984 --> 00:42:00,818
Don't you remember?

915
00:42:00,853 --> 00:42:02,703
They're your letters.

916
00:42:02,738 --> 00:42:05,823
I've had them
how long a time?

917
00:42:05,858 --> 00:42:07,708
What are you going
to do with them, eh?

918
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:09,577
Bury them.

919
00:42:09,612 --> 00:42:13,330
I don't need them anymore.

920
00:42:28,979 --> 00:42:30,848
It won't be
very long now.

921
00:42:30,883 --> 00:42:32,733
Here they are.

922
00:42:32,768 --> 00:42:34,602
Come along,
mr. And mrs. Ransome.

923
00:42:34,637 --> 00:42:35,853
Champagne's
getting warm.

924
00:42:35,888 --> 00:42:37,738
You know my wife,
don't you?

925
00:42:37,773 --> 00:42:39,607
That's the captain.

926
00:42:39,642 --> 00:42:40,241
Have you met
captain protheroe?

927
00:42:40,858 --> 00:42:41,492
No.

928
00:42:41,527 --> 00:42:42,743
There he is,
mr. And mrs. Ransome.

929
00:42:42,778 --> 00:42:44,612
Sit down. Make
yourselves comfortable.

930
00:42:44,647 --> 00:42:45,863
I'm very happy
to meet you.

931
00:42:45,898 --> 00:42:47,114
We're happy
to meet you, sir.

932
00:42:47,149 --> 00:42:49,366
You've had a pleasant voyage?

933
00:42:49,401 --> 00:42:51,368
Oh, yes,
sir. We're...

934
00:42:51,403 --> 00:42:53,871
we're grateful to
have been part of it.

935
00:42:55,122 --> 00:42:56,757
Indeed?

936
00:42:56,792 --> 00:42:59,260
Well, that's very nice.

937
00:42:59,295 --> 00:43:01,762
I suppose you've packed
your things?

938
00:43:01,797 --> 00:43:02,630
Hmm?

939
00:43:03,881 --> 00:43:05,132
They don't know yet.

940
00:43:05,167 --> 00:43:06,884
Oh?

941
00:43:07,518 --> 00:43:08,769
Well... i suppose

942
00:43:09,136 --> 00:43:09,770
it's all the same.

943
00:43:09,805 --> 00:43:11,021
Don't know what, sir?

944
00:43:11,056 --> 00:43:13,524
Oh, nothing.

945
00:43:13,559 --> 00:43:14,775
We thought it would be

946
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:17,027
better this way,
captain.

947
00:43:17,062 --> 00:43:19,530
You know, your presence
aboard has been rather-

948
00:43:19,565 --> 00:43:22,032
how shall i say? -
symbolic.

949
00:43:22,067 --> 00:43:23,901
Us ending, as it were,

950
00:43:23,936 --> 00:43:25,786
and you beginning.

951
00:43:25,821 --> 00:43:28,906
Our captain's quite
a romantic, isn't he?

952
00:43:28,941 --> 00:43:29,540
Extraordinary man.

953
00:43:31,408 --> 00:43:33,294
Well, if you'll
excuse me,

954
00:43:33,329 --> 00:43:35,162
i have some business
to attend to.

955
00:43:35,197 --> 00:43:35,913
You'll be back?

956
00:43:35,948 --> 00:43:38,415
Very shortly. Yes.

957
00:43:47,925 --> 00:43:49,426
Well, look at me.

958
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:54,181
That's cute.

959
00:43:54,216 --> 00:43:56,934
I see thelady anne
has worked her magic on you.

960
00:43:56,969 --> 00:43:59,937
Oh, yes. She andyou-

961
00:43:59,972 --> 00:44:01,822
all of you.

962
00:44:01,857 --> 00:44:03,691
I can't tell you
how grateful we are.

963
00:44:04,325 --> 00:44:06,827
See, we'd forgotten
so many things.

964
00:44:06,862 --> 00:44:08,078
As mr. Burgess said,

965
00:44:08,113 --> 00:44:10,447
people don't know
how to relax.

966
00:44:10,482 --> 00:44:11,699
Rush, rush, rush.

967
00:44:11,734 --> 00:44:13,701
I guess i was rushing.

968
00:44:13,736 --> 00:44:16,837
I forgot the most important
things in my life.

969
00:44:17,623 --> 00:44:20,090
But i won't lose sight
of them again.

970
00:44:20,125 --> 00:44:22,710
I say, let's drink
to that, shall we?

971
00:44:23,996 --> 00:44:25,846
Yes, here we are.

972
00:44:25,881 --> 00:44:27,097
Cheers.

973
00:44:27,132 --> 00:44:27,715
Thank you.

974
00:44:30,135 --> 00:44:31,352
What's that?

975
00:44:31,387 --> 00:44:33,103
What's what?

976
00:44:34,355 --> 00:44:35,606
The engines. They've stopped.

977
00:44:35,641 --> 00:44:39,977
Some slight difficulty.
Nothing, nothing, nothing.

978
00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:43,981
Mrs. Ransome,

979
00:44:44,016 --> 00:44:46,233
may i have the pleasure
of this dance?

980
00:44:46,268 --> 00:44:49,370
Oh, i was hoping
you'd ask me.

981
00:44:49,405 --> 00:44:50,621
Thank you.

982
00:44:50,656 --> 00:44:51,872
Mrs. Mckenzie

983
00:44:51,907 --> 00:44:53,741
i'm not
very good, but, uh...

984
00:44:53,776 --> 00:44:54,992
delighted,
mr. Ransome.

985
00:44:55,027 --> 00:44:56,877
Good old millie.
Got your hands full.

986
00:44:56,912 --> 00:44:58,746
Not so much
of the "old," dear.

987
00:45:26,907 --> 00:45:28,158
Had enough
of it, did you?

988
00:45:28,193 --> 00:45:30,027
Thank you.

989
00:45:30,062 --> 00:45:31,278
I see they haven't
got them fixed.

990
00:45:31,313 --> 00:45:32,529
What fixed?

991
00:45:32,564 --> 00:45:33,163
The engines.

992
00:45:33,198 --> 00:45:34,415
Oh?

993
00:45:34,450 --> 00:45:35,666
No.

994
00:45:35,701 --> 00:45:38,168
Your things have been
gathered together.

995
00:45:38,203 --> 00:45:39,420
What things?

996
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:40,671
Why, your luggage.

997
00:45:40,706 --> 00:45:42,039
Really, mckenzie,

998
00:45:42,074 --> 00:45:44,541
i'd have thought
you'd have told them by now.

999
00:45:44,576 --> 00:45:45,793
Yes...

1000
00:45:45,828 --> 00:45:48,295
well, we're all having
such a fine time

1001
00:45:48,330 --> 00:45:50,180
i didn't want
to spoil the fun.

1002
00:45:50,215 --> 00:45:52,933
Excuse me,
but what are you talking about?

1003
00:45:52,968 --> 00:45:54,802
Why should we gather
our things together?

1004
00:45:54,837 --> 00:45:56,053
Because, my friends,

1005
00:45:56,088 --> 00:45:57,938
we're putting you off the ship.

1006
00:45:59,189 --> 00:46:00,441
You're what?

1007
00:46:00,476 --> 00:46:02,309
Putting you
off the ship.

1008
00:46:02,943 --> 00:46:03,560
What do you mean?

1009
00:46:03,595 --> 00:46:04,812
Just that.

1010
00:46:04,847 --> 00:46:06,697
Why? Are we in trouble?

1011
00:46:06,732 --> 00:46:07,698
No, no...

1012
00:46:07,733 --> 00:46:08,949
well, then why?

1013
00:46:08,984 --> 00:46:11,452
There's no time
for explanations.

1014
00:46:11,487 --> 00:46:13,320
If mr. Mckenzie had done
as he promised,

1015
00:46:13,355 --> 00:46:14,571
they wouldn't
even be necessary.

1016
00:46:17,074 --> 00:46:18,709
Skip the explanation.

1017
00:46:18,744 --> 00:46:21,211
They'll understand eventually.

1018
00:46:21,246 --> 00:46:23,580
Maybe, but we're not
going anywhere

1019
00:46:23,615 --> 00:46:24,832
until we understand why.

1020
00:46:24,867 --> 00:46:27,334
I'm afraid
you haven't any choice.

1021
00:46:27,369 --> 00:46:29,086
Follow me, please.

1022
00:46:29,121 --> 00:46:30,971
No.

1023
00:46:31,588 --> 00:46:34,091
Unless this is
some sort of gag.

1024
00:46:36,593 --> 00:46:39,096
Oh, it is, isn't it?

1025
00:46:39,131 --> 00:46:39,730
I mean, you don't just

1026
00:46:39,765 --> 00:46:42,232
put passengers off a ship
in mid-ocean.

1027
00:46:42,267 --> 00:46:43,484
He's kidding, isn't he?

1028
00:46:45,986 --> 00:46:47,855
Follow the captain,
please.

1029
00:46:56,613 --> 00:46:59,750
We'll come
along with you.

1030
00:46:59,785 --> 00:47:02,252
A bit of
the way, anyhow.

1031
00:47:02,287 --> 00:47:04,121
Better bring
your coat, millie.

1032
00:47:04,156 --> 00:47:05,372
My boy,

1033
00:47:05,407 --> 00:47:06,623
mustn't worry too much.

1034
00:47:06,658 --> 00:47:09,009
Your exact position's
been radioed.

1035
00:47:09,044 --> 00:47:12,129
Even now,
help's on the way.

1036
00:47:22,773 --> 00:47:25,893
Your luggage is
in the boat, you see.

1037
00:47:25,928 --> 00:47:29,029
Biscuits, flares...

1038
00:47:29,064 --> 00:47:31,532
and some champagne,
i saw to that.

1039
00:47:31,567 --> 00:47:34,034
Coats and provisions
are in the boat.

1040
00:47:34,069 --> 00:47:36,537
Oh, and it sends out
an automatic signal.

1041
00:47:36,572 --> 00:47:38,405
Really...

1042
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:40,290
everything
you need.

1043
00:47:40,325 --> 00:47:42,159
Except a reason.

1044
00:47:42,194 --> 00:47:43,410
I'm sorry.

1045
00:47:43,445 --> 00:47:45,913
It's time we were off.

1046
00:47:45,948 --> 00:47:47,164
Into the boat,
please.

1047
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:49,666
But why?
Is it something we've done?

1048
00:47:49,701 --> 00:47:51,552
No, not a bit of it.

1049
00:47:51,587 --> 00:47:54,054
Then for heaven's sake, why?
Tell us.

1050
00:47:54,089 --> 00:47:55,305
You can't just put someone
off a ship

1051
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:57,174
in the middle of the ocean
without a reason.

1052
00:47:57,209 --> 00:47:59,059
There's a reason, my boy.

1053
00:48:02,813 --> 00:48:04,681
We like you people.

1054
00:48:04,716 --> 00:48:06,567
We thought you liked us.

1055
00:48:15,943 --> 00:48:17,828
They do.

1056
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:30,340
Lower away!

1057
00:48:42,853 --> 00:48:44,605
Better put on those coats.

1058
00:48:45,222 --> 00:48:46,473
You'll get cold.

1059
00:48:46,508 --> 00:48:47,724
Wrap up warm.

1060
00:48:47,759 --> 00:48:49,610
Yes, wrap up warm.

1061
00:49:19,006 --> 00:49:20,891
Good-bye! Bye-bye!

1062
00:49:20,926 --> 00:49:24,645
Stiff upper lip! Keep it up!

1063
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:27,147
Cheers!

1064
00:49:34,655 --> 00:49:35,906
Cold?

1065
00:49:37,157 --> 00:49:39,660
I've never felt so warm
in my whole life.

1066
00:49:50,287 --> 00:49:53,924
Thelady anne
never reached port.

1067
00:49:53,959 --> 00:49:55,792
After they were picked up
by a cutter

1068
00:49:55,827 --> 00:49:57,044
a few hours later,

1069
00:49:57,079 --> 00:49:58,929
as captain protheroe
had promised,

1070
00:49:58,964 --> 00:50:01,431
the ransomes searched
the newspapers for news,

1071
00:50:01,466 --> 00:50:03,300
but there wasn't any news.

1072
00:50:03,335 --> 00:50:06,436
Thelady anne, with all her
crew and all her passengers,

1073
00:50:06,471 --> 00:50:07,688
