1
00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:10,727
You unlock this door
with the key of imagination.

2
00:00:10,762 --> 00:00:13,229
Beyond it is another dimension-

3
00:00:13,264 --> 00:00:13,863
a dimension of sound...

4
00:00:15,767 --> 00:00:17,617
a dimension of sight...

5
00:00:17,652 --> 00:00:19,486
a dimension of mind.

6
00:00:19,521 --> 00:00:22,622
You're moving into a land
of both shadow and substance,

7
00:00:22,657 --> 00:00:24,491
of things and ideas.

8
00:00:24,526 --> 00:00:28,244
You've just crossed over
into the twilight zone.

9
00:00:57,023 --> 00:00:58,908
Yeah.

10
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,028
This is grady.

11
00:01:03,913 --> 00:01:06,416
Who?

12
00:01:06,451 --> 00:01:08,284
What paper?

13
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:10,787
Oh, yeah.

14
00:01:10,822 --> 00:01:13,289
Yeah, so you're the creep tha...

15
00:01:13,324 --> 00:01:15,175
i said creep!

16
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:17,677
Yeah, i know who you are.

17
00:01:17,712 --> 00:01:19,546
I know who you are.

18
00:01:19,581 --> 00:01:21,431
Sure, i read your column.

19
00:01:21,466 --> 00:01:23,933
Every time i read it,
it makes me sick.

20
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:27,053
I want to use a stomach pump!

21
00:01:27,088 --> 00:01:30,190
Don't try and nuzzle up to me
with that "mr. Grady" stuff.

22
00:01:30,225 --> 00:01:32,692
Three years ago
you stuck in the shiv!

23
00:01:32,727 --> 00:01:35,945
Listen to me, i had nothing
to do with horse doping.

24
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,448
Nothing- you understand that?

25
00:01:38,483 --> 00:01:39,699
Uh-huh.

26
00:01:39,734 --> 00:01:41,568
Sure, a couple of taps
on the typewriter

27
00:01:41,603 --> 00:01:43,453
and i get a 60-day suspension!

28
00:01:43,488 --> 00:01:45,955
You can talk pretty safe
now you're 50 blocks away.

29
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:47,824
If you were here
in this room now,

30
00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:50,326
i'd scrape you off the wall
and put you in a cup!

31
00:01:50,361 --> 00:01:51,578
How does that grab you?

32
00:01:51,613 --> 00:01:53,463
This is a statement
to the press!

33
00:01:53,498 --> 00:01:55,331
Grady to the press, you fink.

34
00:01:55,366 --> 00:01:56,583
You hyenas down there.

35
00:01:56,618 --> 00:02:00,970
Listen, and don't forget
to spell the name correct!

36
00:02:01,005 --> 00:02:04,090
G-r-a-d-y!

37
00:02:15,485 --> 00:02:17,353
You chump.

38
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:21,107
You stupid, rotten chump.

39
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,112
Just on account
of a couple of fixes, huh?

40
00:02:26,147 --> 00:02:29,866
Big boys walk away
with all the big dough.

41
00:02:29,901 --> 00:02:32,368
What do you walk away with, huh?

42
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,122
A bagful of change.

43
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:43,012
What are you going to do now?

44
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:46,132
I know what you'll do.

45
00:02:46,167 --> 00:02:47,383
You get a carriage,

46
00:02:47,418 --> 00:02:51,137
and you'll drive lovers
through central park.

47
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:57,026
Grady, you kill me.

48
00:03:00,815 --> 00:03:03,283
You... you kill me, boy.

49
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:12,292
Yes... you runt!

50
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:16,663
You shrimp!

51
00:03:25,421 --> 00:03:27,924
What are you going
to do now, pal?

52
00:03:35,431 --> 00:03:37,317
What can you do?

53
00:03:37,934 --> 00:03:39,819
The name is grady-

54
00:03:39,854 --> 00:03:42,322
five feet short
in stockings and boots,

55
00:03:42,357 --> 00:03:46,075
a slightly distorted offshoot
of a good breed of humans

56
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:47,327
who race horses.

57
00:03:47,362 --> 00:03:50,446
He happens to be one
of the rotten apples,

58
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:52,949
bruised and yellowed
by dealing in dirt,

59
00:03:52,984 --> 00:03:54,834
a short man with a short memory

60
00:03:54,869 --> 00:03:58,588
who's forgotten that he's worked
for the sport of kings

61
00:03:58,623 --> 00:04:00,456
and helped turn it
into a cesspool,

62
00:04:00,491 --> 00:04:02,342
used and misused
by the two-legged animals

63
00:04:02,377 --> 00:04:03,593
who have hung
around sporting events

64
00:04:03,628 --> 00:04:06,095
since the days of the coliseum.

65
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:09,215
So this is grady,
on his last night as a jockey.

66
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,969
Behind him are hialeah,
hollywood park and saratoga.

67
00:04:13,004 --> 00:04:16,723
Rounding the far turn
and coming up fast on the rail-

68
00:04:16,758 --> 00:04:19,225
is the twilight zone.

69
00:04:42,332 --> 00:04:44,834
How goes the world, mr. Grady?

70
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:51,090
Who...?

71
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,976
What...?

72
00:04:53,011 --> 00:04:55,478
Little tight on the turns?

73
00:04:55,513 --> 00:04:57,981
Bogged down by a muddy track?

74
00:04:58,016 --> 00:05:00,483
How goes it, mr. Grady?

75
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:06,356
It's a gag.

76
00:05:11,995 --> 00:05:13,863
It's a gag.

77
00:05:18,286 --> 00:05:19,502
Huh?

78
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:28,878
It's a gag, huh?

79
00:05:32,015 --> 00:05:33,266
All right, now.

80
00:05:33,301 --> 00:05:35,134
Look you...
you made your point.

81
00:05:36,386 --> 00:05:37,637
Where are you?

82
00:05:37,672 --> 00:05:39,522
Where am i?

83
00:05:39,557 --> 00:05:42,642
I'm between the frontal lobes,
mr. Grady.

84
00:05:42,677 --> 00:05:43,893
What?

85
00:05:43,928 --> 00:05:45,144
Inside your head-

86
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:49,532
securely nestled
in the gray convolutions.

87
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:55,154
Convolutions?

88
00:05:56,406 --> 00:05:58,908
Just what is that
supposed to mean?

89
00:05:58,943 --> 00:06:01,411
I'm inside your head, mr. Grady.

90
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:04,547
My head?

91
00:06:07,702 --> 00:06:10,169
How you like it in there, huh?

92
00:06:12,055 --> 00:06:13,923
How you like it in there?

93
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:15,174
Are you comfortable?

94
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:16,426
Huh?

95
00:06:17,712 --> 00:06:19,562
Excuse me for laughing.

96
00:06:19,597 --> 00:06:20,813
That's a funny question.

97
00:06:20,848 --> 00:06:22,682
Comfortable inside your head?

98
00:06:22,717 --> 00:06:26,436
It's like sleeping in the midst
of a parade on 42nd street-

99
00:06:26,471 --> 00:06:28,321
noisy, crowded, uncomfortable.

100
00:06:28,356 --> 00:06:30,189
In fact, i'm sick of it.

101
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:32,075
If you're sick of it, get out.

102
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,326
You're sick of it.

103
00:06:33,361 --> 00:06:34,577
Get out of there.

104
00:06:34,612 --> 00:06:36,446
I wished i could.

105
00:06:36,481 --> 00:06:38,948
It would be much more
comfortable outside

106
00:06:38,983 --> 00:06:43,703
instead of being cooped up in
that tiny little brain of yours.

107
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:47,457
Who are you?

108
00:06:47,492 --> 00:06:50,593
I'm your memory,
your conscience, mr. Grady.

109
00:06:50,628 --> 00:06:53,713
I'm every one of your
aspirations and recollections.

110
00:06:53,748 --> 00:06:56,849
I'm every one of your failures
and defeats.

111
00:06:56,884 --> 00:06:59,969
I also wear the wreaths
of all your victories.

112
00:07:00,004 --> 00:07:01,854
I'm what you call
the "alter ego."

113
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:05,608
Ego.

114
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:08,728
Big deal.

115
00:07:10,613 --> 00:07:12,482
Big deal!

116
00:07:12,517 --> 00:07:14,984
What do you want?

117
00:07:15,019 --> 00:07:19,372
I think the apt question
would be, "what is it you want?"

118
00:07:19,407 --> 00:07:20,740
It's a hot one, huh?

119
00:07:20,775 --> 00:07:21,991
What do i want?

120
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:25,745
I don't need a thing.

121
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:26,996
What do i want?

122
00:07:27,031 --> 00:07:28,998
You really are a
dumb little runt.

123
00:07:29,033 --> 00:07:31,501
That's what you call
yourself, isn't it?

124
00:07:31,536 --> 00:07:33,386
"Runt" or was
it "shrimp"?

125
00:07:36,005 --> 00:07:37,890
Why don't you get out of here?

126
00:07:37,925 --> 00:07:40,393
How do i get you out of here?

127
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:42,261
You don't,
you don't.

128
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:43,513
You live with me.

129
00:07:43,548 --> 00:07:46,649
In fact, you
might find me
very interesting.

130
00:07:46,684 --> 00:07:48,518
I know you very
well, mr. Grady.

131
00:07:48,553 --> 00:07:49,769
There isn't
one thought

132
00:07:49,804 --> 00:07:51,020
that crosses
your mind

133
00:07:51,055 --> 00:07:52,905
that i'm not
aware of.

134
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,024
There isn't one
ugly recollection,

135
00:07:55,059 --> 00:07:57,527
one bitter little shame
that i'm not aware of.

136
00:07:58,161 --> 00:07:58,778
Bitter little shame.

137
00:07:58,813 --> 00:08:01,280
You don't know me
from man o'war.

138
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:03,166
I got no bitter recollections.

139
00:08:03,201 --> 00:08:04,667
Oh, come now, mr. Grady.

140
00:08:04,702 --> 00:08:07,787
Look, shall we look
at the record book?

141
00:08:07,822 --> 00:08:09,672
1961- hialeah.

142
00:08:09,707 --> 00:08:12,175
Suspended for riding
infractions.

143
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:12,925
It wasn't my fault.

144
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,294
1962- six month suspension

145
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:17,797
for failure to report
a bribe offer.

146
00:08:17,832 --> 00:08:18,931
I was framed.

147
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:21,300
And now most recently

148
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:25,054
the crowning touch
to an illustrious career

149
00:08:25,089 --> 00:08:29,442
lifetime suspension
for race fixing, horse doping.

150
00:08:29,477 --> 00:08:32,445
I didn't dope any horses.

151
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,313
Career's shot.

152
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:37,450
Roughly eight dollars
in your jeans.

153
00:08:38,067 --> 00:08:42,321
I don't need you.

154
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:44,824
It won't be any time at all.

155
00:08:44,859 --> 00:08:46,709
Two year's time i'll be back up

156
00:08:46,744 --> 00:08:49,212
riding five or six
winners a day.

157
00:08:49,247 --> 00:08:51,714
You'll drive a carriage
with lovers in it

158
00:08:51,749 --> 00:08:53,583
through central park.

159
00:08:53,618 --> 00:08:54,333
Knock it off!

160
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:56,719
No, you need me, mr. Grady.

161
00:08:56,754 --> 00:08:59,338
In fact, you have
desperate need of me.

162
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:00,590
Knock it off!

163
00:09:03,092 --> 00:09:05,478
Where are you now?

164
00:09:05,513 --> 00:09:07,346
Huh?

165
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:09,232
Where are you now?

166
00:09:09,267 --> 00:09:12,351
Ah, you fake!

167
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:15,488
I need you
like i need pneumonia.

168
00:09:15,523 --> 00:09:17,990
Like i need a fractured leg,
that's how i need you.

169
00:09:18,025 --> 00:09:20,493
Who do you think
you're talking to anyway?

170
00:09:20,528 --> 00:09:22,361
Who do you think
you're talking to?

171
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:23,746
I make one phone call
to hencheck,

172
00:09:23,781 --> 00:09:26,249
one phone call,
and in an hour's time,

173
00:09:26,284 --> 00:09:28,751
i'm on my way to puerto rico
riding in the warm sun.

174
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:31,871
Two years time, i'll be back
here riding in silks.

175
00:09:31,906 --> 00:09:34,373
Why don't you call
mr. Hencheck?

176
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:38,127
Go ahead, give him a buzz.

177
00:09:44,634 --> 00:09:45,885
I'll show you, loudmouth.

178
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:51,524
I'll make you eat
every rotten word.

179
00:09:54,777 --> 00:09:56,646
Hello, this is grady.

180
00:09:56,681 --> 00:09:57,897
Hencheck there?

181
00:09:59,148 --> 00:10:01,033
I want to talk to him!

182
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:07,290
Listen to this.

183
00:10:09,158 --> 00:10:12,295
Hello, hencheck, it's grady.

184
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:14,797
What's to be surprised about?

185
00:10:14,832 --> 00:10:17,917
You had your boat race,
so you made your pile.

186
00:10:17,952 --> 00:10:19,802
I'm down to my last eight bucks.

187
00:10:19,837 --> 00:10:21,671
I figure it's time
that grady got his, see?

188
00:10:21,706 --> 00:10:23,556
I figure that...

189
00:10:26,676 --> 00:10:27,927
hencheck.

190
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:37,320
Very unappreciative.

191
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:39,188
Well, that's the breaks.

192
00:10:39,223 --> 00:10:41,691
They take, they never give.

193
00:10:41,726 --> 00:10:42,942
What's to do now?

194
00:10:42,977 --> 00:10:47,947
Write a will and take gas?

195
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:49,949
Look, i could nickel-and-dime

196
00:10:49,984 --> 00:10:52,451
or i could buy and sell him
a year ago.

197
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:53,703
I don't need him.

198
00:10:53,738 --> 00:10:54,954
I don't need you.

199
00:10:54,989 --> 00:10:56,205
I don't need nobody.

200
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,456
I was a big man once.

201
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:58,708
I can be big again.
Wait and see.

202
00:10:58,743 --> 00:10:59,959
You know,
it was just a year ago

203
00:10:59,994 --> 00:11:01,210
you were strutting
around the country,

204
00:11:01,245 --> 00:11:02,962
you wore nice, shiny shoes,

205
00:11:02,997 --> 00:11:04,847
new clothes, tipped big.

206
00:11:04,882 --> 00:11:07,600
You had some compensation
then, mr. Grady.

207
00:11:08,217 --> 00:11:09,468
Compensation?

208
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:13,222
For the fact that
you're a little runt.

209
00:11:13,257 --> 00:11:15,725
For the unpleasant realization
that all your life

210
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,478
you've had to stand on tiptoe
to look at what's around you.

211
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:21,981
I wish you were here right now,
hear me?

212
00:11:22,016 --> 00:11:24,483
I wish you were here right now.

213
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:27,370
Just look down...
under your feet.

214
00:11:27,405 --> 00:11:30,489
Mr. Grady, you know
what you want?

215
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:32,875
You want to be respected.

216
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,744
Up on a horse you're a man.

217
00:11:34,779 --> 00:11:37,880
On the ground
you're a half-pint.

218
00:11:37,915 --> 00:11:39,749
Shut up! Shut up!

219
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:44,387
Shut up, you understand?

220
00:11:44,422 --> 00:11:46,255
Easy, mr. Grady.

221
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:48,758
Easy does it, easy does it.

222
00:11:48,793 --> 00:11:53,145
Now we get to the moment
of truth- the ultimate.

223
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:56,265
Now you hit pay dirt, kid.

224
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,768
You get whatever you want.

225
00:11:58,803 --> 00:12:00,653
What do you mean
"whatever i want"?

226
00:12:00,688 --> 00:12:02,521
Tell me, what is it you want

227
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:05,024
more than anything else
on the earth?

228
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:06,909
This is the moment, this is it.

229
00:12:06,944 --> 00:12:09,412
What is it you want, mr. Grady?

230
00:12:09,447 --> 00:12:10,663
Name it- it's yours.

231
00:12:10,698 --> 00:12:12,531
What do i want?

232
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:16,285
What do i want?

233
00:12:19,422 --> 00:12:21,290
I want to be the biggest.

234
00:12:21,325 --> 00:12:23,793
Hear me?

235
00:12:23,828 --> 00:12:25,044
Yeah, that's what i want.

236
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:26,929
I want to be the biggest.

237
00:12:26,964 --> 00:12:29,432
I want to be big!

238
00:12:29,467 --> 00:12:32,551
Damn you, i want to be big!

239
00:13:07,169 --> 00:13:11,557
Have a good rest, mr. Grady?

240
00:13:11,592 --> 00:13:15,311
Yeah. Yeah.

241
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:20,182
I had a good rest.

242
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,105
This is wild.

243
00:14:06,362 --> 00:14:10,733
This is wild.

244
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:16,372
Like what you see?

245
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:22,628
What is this?

246
00:14:22,663 --> 00:14:23,879
Am i dreaming?

247
00:14:23,914 --> 00:14:25,130
Is this is a dream?

248
00:14:25,165 --> 00:14:28,884
A dream- oh, come now.

249
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:30,753
Look, touch the dresser.

250
00:14:30,788 --> 00:14:32,638
Yeah.

251
00:14:32,673 --> 00:14:33,889
Yeah, i'll touch it.

252
00:14:33,924 --> 00:14:35,140
Yeah, that's it.

253
00:14:35,175 --> 00:14:37,643
Now touch the overhead beam.

254
00:14:38,894 --> 00:14:40,145
Yeah.

255
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,648
These are all
very solid objects-

256
00:14:42,683 --> 00:14:44,516
width, height,
thickness and reality.

257
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:45,768
Yeah...

258
00:14:45,803 --> 00:14:46,902
yeah.

259
00:14:48,771 --> 00:14:50,022
Hey, what is this?

260
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:51,907
You had your heart's desire.

261
00:14:51,942 --> 00:14:55,661
You didn't ask for a two-hour
escape with morpheus.

262
00:14:55,696 --> 00:14:57,529
You wanted stature, mr. Grady.

263
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:58,781
You wanted size.

264
00:14:58,816 --> 00:15:02,534
You wanted a view from a long
way up and a long way out.

265
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:04,420
Yeah, i wanted size.

266
00:15:04,455 --> 00:15:06,288
You wanted to be big.

267
00:15:06,323 --> 00:15:08,791
Well, look at yourself.

268
00:15:08,826 --> 00:15:10,042
You're big.

269
00:15:10,077 --> 00:15:11,927
You're mr. Big.

270
00:15:11,962 --> 00:15:15,681
You're hercules, you're the most
sizable thing since paul bunyan.

271
00:15:15,716 --> 00:15:17,549
You don't have any complaints

272
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:20,052
that you want
to trot out, do you?

273
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:21,937
Complaints?

274
00:15:21,972 --> 00:15:23,806
Do i have any complaints?

275
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:25,691
No, i have no complaints.

276
00:15:25,726 --> 00:15:28,193
Hey, you know
what this calls for?

277
00:15:28,228 --> 00:15:30,696
This calls for a-a celebration.

278
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:35,067
Look, hey, here, hey,
you drink, don't ya?

279
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:36,318
Huh? You drink?

280
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:37,569
Go right ahead.

281
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:39,455
Be my guest.

282
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:42,574
Yeah, well,
here's mud in your eye.

283
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:44,460
Too bad you can't
enjoy this with me.

284
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:46,962
I'm joining you,
i'm joining you.

285
00:15:46,997 --> 00:15:48,213
Believe me, i'm feeling

286
00:15:48,248 --> 00:15:51,333
the hot little ripples
just as you do.

287
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:53,218
You do, huh?

288
00:15:53,253 --> 00:15:54,470
Yeah?

289
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:56,338
Well, you stay right in there.

290
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:57,589
You stay there.

291
00:15:57,624 --> 00:16:01,477
I'm gonna have some fun,
you understand?

292
00:16:01,512 --> 00:16:05,230
I'm gonna have some fun! See?!

293
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:08,350
Ooh, careful, careful.

294
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:10,853
You don't want to go
through the floor.

295
00:16:14,024 --> 00:16:16,492
Hey...

296
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,114
mr. Grady.

297
00:16:27,154 --> 00:16:29,621
Mr. Grady!

298
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:30,873
Yeah.

299
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:34,009
Like the view, do you?

300
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:36,512
I love it. I love it.

301
00:16:36,547 --> 00:16:38,380
You know what
i'm going to do now?

302
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:39,631
I'm gonna make a call,

303
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,517
a telephone call
to somebody very special,

304
00:16:41,552 --> 00:16:44,636
a very, very special girl.

305
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:48,390
And when she hears about this...

306
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:50,275
she's going to flip.

307
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:52,778
Really, pal,
are you that attractive?

308
00:16:53,395 --> 00:16:55,898
Tell me, does size mean
that much?

309
00:16:55,933 --> 00:16:57,783
You bet your bottom dollar
it does.

310
00:16:57,818 --> 00:17:01,537
You know she used to lean over
and pat me on the head.

311
00:17:01,572 --> 00:17:02,788
Hello, honey.

312
00:17:02,823 --> 00:17:04,039
Hello, doll.

313
00:17:04,074 --> 00:17:05,290
You know who this is?

314
00:17:05,325 --> 00:17:06,542
This is grady.

315
00:17:06,577 --> 00:17:07,793
Yeah.

316
00:17:09,044 --> 00:17:11,547
Wait a minute, honey,
don't brush me off.

317
00:17:11,582 --> 00:17:13,415
This is your ex-meal ticket,

318
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:16,552
an eight-course meal ticket
at that!

319
00:17:16,587 --> 00:17:19,054
Now listen to this, honey...

320
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:20,923
i'm big.

321
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:22,174
Understand that?

322
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:24,059
I'm b-l-g.

323
00:17:25,963 --> 00:17:27,179
Big, big, big, big, big.

324
00:17:27,214 --> 00:17:29,681
I don't know, i may be six,
seven, eight feet tall.

325
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:30,933
I don't know.

326
00:17:31,567 --> 00:17:32,818
The lakers will be scouting me
any day now.

327
00:17:35,973 --> 00:17:37,823
Huh?

328
00:17:37,858 --> 00:17:40,325
What a minute,
you don't talk to me like th...

329
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,194
you don't talk to me like that,
i said.

330
00:17:42,229 --> 00:17:44,079
You heard what i...

331
00:17:44,114 --> 00:17:46,582
i'll slap your face off!

332
00:17:46,617 --> 00:17:49,084
You no good alley cat!

333
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:52,704
That's great-
that was wonderful.

334
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:54,590
You managed to flex
your muscles

335
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:56,458
in a most impressive fashion.

336
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:58,343
At this rate you're going,
women all over the world

337
00:17:58,378 --> 00:18:02,097
will be flocking
to your doorstep no doubt.

338
00:18:02,132 --> 00:18:03,348
Well, i can call 12 girls.

339
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:05,851
Just because i struck out
this time,

340
00:18:05,886 --> 00:18:09,605
i could call 12 girls prettier
and nicer than that one.

341
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:13,358
You don't believe me, do you?

342
00:18:13,393 --> 00:18:15,861
So far you just haven't
impressed me.

343
00:18:15,896 --> 00:18:17,112
Well, i will.

344
00:18:18,981 --> 00:18:20,232
I will.

345
00:18:26,622 --> 00:18:29,124
Yeah.

346
00:18:29,159 --> 00:18:31,126
What do you mean, too loud?

347
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:34,880
Oh.

348
00:18:34,915 --> 00:18:37,382
How's that, mac,
is that better?

349
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:41,136
Good.

350
00:18:41,171 --> 00:18:42,387
Hmm?

351
00:18:42,422 --> 00:18:45,507
What time?

352
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:46,758
Yeah.

353
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:49,261
Yeah, i'll be expecting
his call.

354
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:50,512
Thank you.

355
00:18:50,547 --> 00:18:52,397
Yeah.

356
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:55,517
He knows the number, doesn't he?

357
00:18:55,552 --> 00:18:57,402
Fine, fine. Thanks.

358
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,522
What was that all about?

359
00:19:00,557 --> 00:19:02,407
That was a fellow telling me

360
00:19:02,442 --> 00:19:06,778
that a lawyer was going to call
me from the racing commission.

361
00:19:08,664 --> 00:19:11,667
Hey, tell me,
who are you?

362
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:16,538
My imagination?

363
00:19:16,573 --> 00:19:21,543
You, uh, you don't have very
much imagination, mr. Grady.

364
00:19:21,578 --> 00:19:23,428
Wait a minute,
who are you, what are you?

365
00:19:23,463 --> 00:19:28,433
I mean, what's all this
"alter ego" jazz?

366
00:19:28,468 --> 00:19:30,185
Well, i'll tell
you, mr. Grady.

367
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:33,305
I'll try to make it
as simple as possible.

368
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,807
I'm the fate every man
makes for himself.

369
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:37,059
You generally find me

370
00:19:37,094 --> 00:19:38,944
down at the bottom
of the barrel.

371
00:19:38,979 --> 00:19:40,195
I'm the strength
dredged up

372
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:41,446
in desperation.

373
00:19:42,064 --> 00:19:43,315
I'm the last gasp.

374
00:19:44,566 --> 00:19:47,069
That's supposed
to be clear, huh?

375
00:19:47,104 --> 00:19:48,320
You're nothing!

376
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:50,706
Nothing, understand?

377
00:19:50,741 --> 00:19:51,957
Oh, i'm something.

378
00:19:51,992 --> 00:19:53,825
Really, i'm something.

379
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,328
In some cases
i'm something very good.

380
00:19:56,363 --> 00:20:00,082
In some cases- depending upon
the person i'm representing-

381
00:20:00,117 --> 00:20:01,333
i can work miracles.

382
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:02,584
You do?

383
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:05,721
I come with heroism,
sacrifice, strength,

384
00:20:05,756 --> 00:20:06,972
and even better than that,

385
00:20:07,007 --> 00:20:10,092
i can epitomize
everything noble in men.

386
00:20:10,127 --> 00:20:11,343
You can, huh?

387
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:13,228
Now, in your case, mr. Grady,

388
00:20:13,263 --> 00:20:15,731
your requirements
were quite small.

389
00:20:15,766 --> 00:20:17,849
What do you mean, quite small?

390
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:20,102
Your dreams
were rather insignificant,

391
00:20:20,137 --> 00:20:22,604
your aspirations
hardly worth mentioning.

392
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:26,241
I mean to say, if you had asked
to win the kentucky derby,

393
00:20:26,276 --> 00:20:28,110
and win it cleanly
and with honor,

394
00:20:28,145 --> 00:20:31,863
that would've been quite
a moment, wouldn't it?

395
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:35,000
Yeah.

396
00:20:35,035 --> 00:20:37,502
That'd been the greatest.

397
00:20:37,537 --> 00:20:41,256
Or if you'd asked to perform
an act of heroism, let's say,

398
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:45,010
that would've been qualification
for the respect you seek.

399
00:20:45,045 --> 00:20:48,130
This, too, would've been
exemplary, right?

400
00:20:48,165 --> 00:20:51,266
I suppose that would've
been all right, yeah.

401
00:20:51,301 --> 00:20:55,020
But as it is, mr. Grady,
what was your heart's desire?

402
00:20:56,271 --> 00:20:58,140
Well, i...

403
00:20:58,175 --> 00:21:00,025
wanted...

404
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,898
i wanted...

405
00:21:13,155 --> 00:21:14,406
i wanted to...

406
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,291
to be a big man.

407
00:21:16,326 --> 00:21:18,160
That's right, yes.

408
00:21:18,195 --> 00:21:21,913
Big in the sense that your
hands can smother a telephone,

409
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:25,667
your face can overshoot
its reflections in the mirror.

410
00:21:25,702 --> 00:21:27,552
You come real cheap.

411
00:21:27,587 --> 00:21:28,420
I don't come cheap.

412
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:30,305
All i ever wanted out of life

413
00:21:30,922 --> 00:21:33,425
was the fact that
i could walk down the street

414
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:36,561
and people not stare at me
like i was a freak!

415
00:21:36,596 --> 00:21:37,813
I am not cheap, buddy.

416
00:21:37,848 --> 00:21:39,064
I don't come cheap.

417
00:21:39,099 --> 00:21:40,932
I've got my heart's desire.

418
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:47,189
Yeah?

419
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:54,079
Yes, mr. Newman.

420
00:21:54,114 --> 00:21:55,947
Yes, sir.

421
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:00,335
Really?

422
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:02,838
Really? Do you...?

423
00:22:02,873 --> 00:22:04,089
Thank you, sir.

424
00:22:04,124 --> 00:22:08,460
You don't know how much
this means to me.

425
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:09,711
Thank the members of the board,

426
00:22:09,746 --> 00:22:11,596
and thank everybody that went
to bat for me, will you?

427
00:22:11,631 --> 00:22:12,848
Just... just thank them.

428
00:22:12,883 --> 00:22:15,350
Tell them how much
i appreciate it.

429
00:22:15,385 --> 00:22:16,601
Thank you very much, mr. Newman.

430
00:22:16,636 --> 00:22:17,853
And listen, tell everybody

431
00:22:17,888 --> 00:22:19,721
they don't have to worry
about me anymore.

432
00:22:19,756 --> 00:22:20,355
I'll play it straight.

433
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:21,606
I mean, no worries.

434
00:22:21,641 --> 00:22:23,475
Cut-and-dried, you understand?

435
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,977
When grady's up,
the worries are over, right?

436
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:27,863
Thanks, mr. Newman.

437
00:22:27,898 --> 00:22:29,114
And thank everybody for me.

438
00:22:29,149 --> 00:22:30,365
Right. Good-bye.

439
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,617
What do you think now,
loudmouth?

440
00:22:33,235 --> 00:22:35,120
Everything's going my way.

441
00:22:35,155 --> 00:22:36,988
One phone call
and you're top dog, huh?

442
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:38,240
You know who that was?

443
00:22:38,275 --> 00:22:40,125
That was the racing commission.

444
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,993
A lot of owners
have signed a petition.

445
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:45,130
They want me to ride again,
do you understand that?

446
00:22:45,165 --> 00:22:46,998
They want grady to ride again.

447
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:49,251
I'm going to ride again.

448
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:56,141
What's so funny?

449
00:22:56,176 --> 00:22:58,009
Eh?

450
00:22:58,044 --> 00:23:00,512
What's so funny
about me riding...?

451
00:23:00,547 --> 00:23:02,397
Eh...

452
00:23:02,432 --> 00:23:04,266
i'm going to ri...

453
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:08,019
wait a minute.

454
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:12,657
I'm too big.

455
00:23:13,909 --> 00:23:16,411
I'm too big.

456
00:23:16,446 --> 00:23:17,662
I'm too big!

457
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:21,032
I can't ride!

458
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:22,284
Wait a minute!

459
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:22,918
I can't ride!

460
00:23:22,953 --> 00:23:26,037
I can't wear my clothes!

461
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:28,540
I'm too... i'm too big!

462
00:23:28,575 --> 00:23:31,042
I'm too big!

463
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:32,294
Hear me?

464
00:23:32,329 --> 00:23:35,430
I'm too big!

465
00:23:35,465 --> 00:23:36,681
I can't ride!

466
00:23:36,716 --> 00:23:37,933
No!

467
00:23:37,968 --> 00:23:42,304
Please, please...
please make me small!

468
00:23:42,339 --> 00:23:44,806
Please, i'll never ask
for anything again.

469
00:23:44,841 --> 00:23:47,943
Please make me small.

470
00:23:47,978 --> 00:23:49,194
Please!

471
00:23:49,229 --> 00:23:51,062
Oh, god.

472
00:23:51,097 --> 00:23:53,565
Youaresmall, mr. Grady.

473
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,067
You see, every time you won
an honest race,

474
00:23:56,102 --> 00:23:57,953
that's when you were a giant.

475
00:23:57,988 --> 00:24:00,455
Right now they just don't come
any smaller.

476
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:02,324
The name is grady,
ten feet tall,

477
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:05,460
a slightly distorted offshoot
of a good breed of humans

478
00:24:05,495 --> 00:24:07,329
who race horses.

479
00:24:07,364 --> 00:24:09,831
Unfortunately for mr. Grady,
he learned too late

480
00:24:09,866 --> 00:24:12,334
that you don't measure size
with a ruler,

481
00:24:12,369 --> 00:24:14,836
you don't figure height
with a yardstick

482
00:24:14,871 --> 00:24:17,973
and you never judge a man by
how tall he looks in a mirror.

483
00:24:18,008 --> 00:24:19,841
The giant is as he does.

484
00:24:19,876 --> 00:24:23,595
You can make a parimutuel bet
on this- win, place or show-

485
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:26,731
in or out of the twilight zone.

486
00:24:29,534 --> 00:24:31,269
And now mr. Serling.

487
00:24:31,304 --> 00:24:32,521
Next ontwilight zone,

488
00:24:32,556 --> 00:24:35,657
a show that might very aptly
be called a living end,

489
00:24:35,692 --> 00:24:38,777
and, with comparable aptness,
is called "living doll."

490
00:24:38,812 --> 00:24:41,913
It's written by colleague
and cohort charles beaumont,

491
00:24:41,948 --> 00:24:45,033
and stars telly savalas,
and costars mary laroche.

492
00:24:45,068 --> 00:24:46,918
Mr. Beaumont supplies us
with a little weirdy

493
00:24:46,953 --> 00:24:49,421
involving a man and a doll.

494
00:24:49,456 --> 00:24:50,672
It comes well recommended.

495
00:24:50,707 --> 00:24:53,792
Next time out, "living doll."
