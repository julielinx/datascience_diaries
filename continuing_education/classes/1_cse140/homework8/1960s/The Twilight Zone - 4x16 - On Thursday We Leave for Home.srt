1
00:00:07,008 --> 00:00:10,110
You unlock this door
with the key of imagination.

2
00:00:10,145 --> 00:00:12,612
Beyond it is another dimension-

3
00:00:12,647 --> 00:00:14,864
a dimension of sound,

4
00:00:14,899 --> 00:00:16,733
a dimension of sight,

5
00:00:16,768 --> 00:00:18,618
a dimension of mind.

6
00:00:18,653 --> 00:00:21,738
You're moving into a land
of both shadow and substance,

7
00:00:21,773 --> 00:00:23,623
of things and ideas.

8
00:00:23,658 --> 00:00:27,994
You've just crossed over
into the twilight zone.

9
00:00:55,405 --> 00:00:57,907
Hank, anything?

10
00:00:57,942 --> 00:01:00,410
Nothing yet, captain.

11
00:01:00,445 --> 00:01:02,912
No sound at all.

12
00:01:02,947 --> 00:01:07,283
Well, try it on.402.

13
00:01:07,318 --> 00:01:09,786
Probably coming
from that direction.

14
00:01:09,821 --> 00:01:12,922
I had it on that
all morning, sir.

15
00:01:12,957 --> 00:01:14,791
Oh.

16
00:01:14,826 --> 00:01:16,676
Try it again.

17
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:41,317
Captain...

18
00:01:41,352 --> 00:01:43,203
anything?

19
00:01:43,238 --> 00:01:44,454
No, nothing
yet, joan,

20
00:01:44,489 --> 00:01:45,071
nothing yet.

21
00:01:45,106 --> 00:01:47,574
They lost, you
figure, captain?

22
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:48,825
They're not
lost, george,

23
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,710
just takes time,
that's all.

24
00:01:50,745 --> 00:01:51,961
Takes time.

25
00:01:51,996 --> 00:01:53,830
Julie, where's
your husband?

26
00:01:53,865 --> 00:01:55,081
In our bunker,
captain.

27
00:01:55,116 --> 00:01:55,715
Something wrong?

28
00:01:56,332 --> 00:01:56,966
Go get him.

29
00:01:57,001 --> 00:01:58,218
Something wrong?

30
00:01:58,253 --> 00:01:59,469
Something's wrong,
julie.

31
00:01:59,504 --> 00:02:00,720
Yes, sir.

32
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:12,849
How's the water,
george?

33
00:02:12,884 --> 00:02:14,734
Hot, flat
and unforgettable.

34
00:02:14,769 --> 00:02:15,985
But wet?

35
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:19,105
Well, bear with it,
folks, bear with it.

36
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,356
Six months' time,

37
00:02:20,391 --> 00:02:23,493
we'll all be drinking
chocolate ice cream soda.

38
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,381
You want to
see me, captain?

39
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:47,884
Man on the radar tower
like to see you, al-

40
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:49,769
would've like to have seen you
two hours ago

41
00:02:49,804 --> 00:02:51,638
when you were supposed
to relieve him.

42
00:02:51,673 --> 00:02:52,889
I overslept,
captain.

43
00:02:52,924 --> 00:02:54,774
You tell that to hank parker
up there, will you?

44
00:02:54,809 --> 00:02:57,277
You tell him that you overslept.

45
00:02:57,312 --> 00:02:59,145
Then be good enough
to tell him

46
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,282
you'll take his entire
watch all day tomorrow.

47
00:03:02,317 --> 00:03:05,401
That's not fair-
it doesn't
happen often.

48
00:03:05,436 --> 00:03:06,035
Once is often.

49
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:07,904
More than once
is intolerable.

50
00:03:07,939 --> 00:03:10,406
And many times
more than once

51
00:03:10,441 --> 00:03:13,543
is the case history
of a man named albert baines

52
00:03:13,578 --> 00:03:14,794
who likes his sleep.

53
00:03:14,829 --> 00:03:17,914
I prefer it to
a stupid game
in the hot sun.

54
00:03:17,949 --> 00:03:19,165
Game, al?

55
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,050
What are we listening
for up there?

56
00:03:21,085 --> 00:03:24,170
30 years, two watches a day,
what have we ever heard?

57
00:03:24,205 --> 00:03:25,421
Wind noise.

58
00:03:25,456 --> 00:03:27,307
What did we ever
pick up on radar?

59
00:03:27,342 --> 00:03:29,175
Dust particles.

60
00:04:04,093 --> 00:04:06,095
This is william benteen

61
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:09,215
who officiates on a
disintegrating outpost in space.

62
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,718
The people
are a remnant society

63
00:04:11,753 --> 00:04:14,220
who left the earth
looking for a millennium,

64
00:04:14,255 --> 00:04:16,723
a place without war,
without jeopardy, without fear.

65
00:04:16,758 --> 00:04:19,108
And what they found
was a lonely, barren place

66
00:04:19,143 --> 00:04:20,977
whose only industry
was survival.

67
00:04:21,012 --> 00:04:24,113
And this is what they've done
for three decades- survive-

68
00:04:24,148 --> 00:04:26,616
until the memory
of the earth they came from

69
00:04:26,651 --> 00:04:29,118
has become an indistinct,
shadowed recollection

70
00:04:29,153 --> 00:04:30,987
of another time
and another place.

71
00:04:31,022 --> 00:04:33,489
One month ago,
a signal from earth announced

72
00:04:33,524 --> 00:04:36,626
a ship would be coming to
pick them up and take them home.

73
00:04:36,661 --> 00:04:39,128
In just a moment,
we'll hear more of that ship,

74
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:42,248
more of that home
and what it takes

75
00:04:42,283 --> 00:04:44,751
out of mind and body
to reach it.

76
00:04:44,786 --> 00:04:46,636
This is the twilight zone.

77
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:16,949
That's all we
got, captain.

78
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:18,835
None left?

79
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,703
That's all of
it right there.

80
00:05:20,738 --> 00:05:21,954
Main switch?

81
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:24,590
That's all gone, too.

82
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:27,093
We used it
on the converter pumps.

83
00:05:27,128 --> 00:05:28,961
Well, we've got to get current.

84
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:30,847
Temperature will go up
50 degrees in those rooms

85
00:05:30,882 --> 00:05:32,715
without refrigeration.

86
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:47,613
We could stop the
salt-water converter

87
00:05:47,648 --> 00:05:48,865
for a day or two.

88
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,116
Switch the parts.

89
00:05:50,151 --> 00:05:54,487
That's what
we'll have to do.

90
00:05:54,522 --> 00:05:56,989
You tell the people to fill up
all the jugs they've got.

91
00:05:57,024 --> 00:06:01,377
We're going to turn off
the water in six hours.

92
00:06:01,412 --> 00:06:03,880
Yes, sir.

93
00:06:05,748 --> 00:06:09,502
Oh, captain.

94
00:06:09,537 --> 00:06:12,004
What about the ship?

95
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:13,890
It's on the
way, george.

96
00:06:13,925 --> 00:06:16,392
We know it's
on the way.

97
00:06:16,427 --> 00:06:18,261
And when we get back,

98
00:06:18,296 --> 00:06:20,146
it's going to
be different.

99
00:06:20,181 --> 00:06:21,397
Things that are old
and worn out,

100
00:06:21,432 --> 00:06:23,266
we're just going to
throw them away.

101
00:06:23,301 --> 00:06:27,019
Just throw them away.

102
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:35,161
Captain benteen.

103
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:56,432
Cut her down.

104
00:06:56,467 --> 00:06:58,935
Oh, no...

105
00:07:01,437 --> 00:07:04,190
prepare her
for burial in an hour.

106
00:07:07,944 --> 00:07:09,195
Say your farewells now.

107
00:07:09,812 --> 00:07:13,566
And ask god's forgiveness
for what she has done.

108
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:14,817
Forgive her,
lord.

109
00:07:14,852 --> 00:07:17,703
Father, forgive her...

110
00:07:18,955 --> 00:07:20,823
for what she's done.

111
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:25,211
She didn't know what
she was doing, lord.

112
00:07:25,246 --> 00:07:26,829
She knew what she was doing.

113
00:07:27,463 --> 00:07:29,966
Better and clearer
than any of the rest of us.

114
00:07:30,001 --> 00:07:32,468
This is a funeral, al.

115
00:07:32,503 --> 00:07:34,470
The ninth in the
last six months,

116
00:07:34,505 --> 00:07:35,721
the ninth!

117
00:07:35,756 --> 00:07:38,841
This woman and the
others took their lives

118
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:41,344
because living
became intolerable.

119
00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:43,846
And i say that dying
was their right.

120
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:45,348
That's a blasphemy!

121
00:07:45,383 --> 00:07:46,599
It's the truth.

122
00:07:46,634 --> 00:07:48,601
Isn't living
tough enough here

123
00:07:48,636 --> 00:07:51,103
we shouldn't have
to go by the book?

124
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:52,989
Isn't it hot and
miserable enough

125
00:07:53,024 --> 00:07:54,857
there shouldn't
be rules?

126
00:07:54,892 --> 00:07:57,610
We shouldn't have
to suffer by the numbers?

127
00:07:57,645 --> 00:08:00,112
Will somebody please
make the simple comment

128
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:02,615
there's more happiness
going into that grave,

129
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:03,866
more peace of mind

130
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:06,002
than all mourners
put together?

131
00:08:06,037 --> 00:08:07,870
Nothing but
anguish here.

132
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:12,258
Captain benteen, let us
live with it in our own way.

133
00:08:12,293 --> 00:08:14,126
Or let us die from it...

134
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:15,378
in our own way!

135
00:08:15,413 --> 00:08:17,263
Young mr. Baines...

136
00:08:17,298 --> 00:08:21,017
would have us
lie down in the sun.

137
00:08:21,052 --> 00:08:23,519
Young mr. Baines...

138
00:08:23,554 --> 00:08:27,890
would have us give in to death,
while there is still life.

139
00:08:27,925 --> 00:08:30,526
He'd end the rules.

140
00:08:30,561 --> 00:08:33,029
Throw away
the regulations.

141
00:08:33,064 --> 00:08:36,148
No more standing
in line for water.

142
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:39,535
We'll let the strong
take away from the weak.

143
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:41,404
And no more food rationing.

144
00:08:41,439 --> 00:08:45,157
Let the young
steal from the old.

145
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:48,294
And when that ship
does arrive...

146
00:08:48,329 --> 00:08:50,796
it won't find a society.

147
00:08:50,831 --> 00:08:53,299
Just a pack.

148
00:08:53,334 --> 00:08:56,419
Not one human being left alive.

149
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:00,556
Only animals.

150
00:09:00,591 --> 00:09:03,059
And there is
a ship coming.

151
00:09:05,561 --> 00:09:08,064
It's winging its way now.

152
00:09:08,099 --> 00:09:11,183
It's on its way.

153
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:17,573
There's a ship coming.

154
00:09:17,608 --> 00:09:20,076
Let me
hear you say it.

155
00:09:20,111 --> 00:09:22,078
Say it out loud.

156
00:09:22,113 --> 00:09:28,451
There's a ship coming.

157
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:30,953
There's a ship coming.

158
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:32,838
There's a ship coming.

159
00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:34,090
There's a ship coming.

160
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:35,958
There's a ship
coming.

161
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:37,843
There's a ship
coming.

162
00:09:37,878 --> 00:09:45,468
There's a ship coming.

163
00:09:45,503 --> 00:09:46,719
There's a ship
coming.

164
00:09:46,754 --> 00:09:48,604
There's a ship
coming.

165
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:52,358
Thereisa ship coming.

166
00:09:52,393 --> 00:09:56,862
There's a ship coming,
there's a ship coming...

167
00:10:06,157 --> 00:10:07,740
meteor storm!

168
00:10:07,775 --> 00:10:09,992
It's a meteor
storm!

169
00:10:10,027 --> 00:10:11,744
It's a meteor storm!

170
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:13,629
Get up to the compound.

171
00:10:13,664 --> 00:10:16,132
Get up to the compound!

172
00:10:32,648 --> 00:10:34,517
Get in the cave.

173
00:10:34,552 --> 00:10:37,019
Get in the cave!

174
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:51,167
Get in the cave!

175
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:11,804
How's the arm, al?

176
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,689
All right.

177
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:35,211
Everybody accounted for?

178
00:11:35,246 --> 00:11:37,079
They're all here,
captain.

179
00:11:37,114 --> 00:11:38,330
Nobody's missing.

180
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:40,216
Oh, thank god.

181
00:11:40,251 --> 00:11:42,718
Everybody just stay
as quiet as you can.

182
00:11:42,753 --> 00:11:45,221
I think
the worst is over.

183
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:49,592
I think
the worst is over.

184
00:11:50,226 --> 00:11:52,094
Quiet.

185
00:11:55,883 --> 00:11:59,602
You're not scared,
are you, jo-jo?

186
00:11:59,637 --> 00:12:01,487
Kind of,
captain.

187
00:12:01,522 --> 00:12:03,989
Well, we can't
have you being scared.

188
00:12:04,024 --> 00:12:06,492
Let's you and me
talk a bit, huh?

189
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,743
Pass the time.

190
00:12:07,778 --> 00:12:10,246
Captain, tell us
about the earth.

191
00:12:10,281 --> 00:12:12,114
Do that,
captain,
would you?

192
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:13,365
Tell us about
the earth

193
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:15,251
as you
remember it?

194
00:12:15,286 --> 00:12:16,502
Again, jerry?

195
00:12:16,537 --> 00:12:19,004
All right,
i'll talk about it.

196
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:20,256
Fran...
you and hank

197
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:22,124
fill in any holes i leave.

198
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:25,261
If i'm wrong
about any of my recollections,

199
00:12:25,296 --> 00:12:26,512
correct me, will you?

200
00:12:26,547 --> 00:12:30,516
Jo-jo, i was just a boy
when we arrived here.

201
00:12:31,133 --> 00:12:35,521
I was 15 years old,
but i remember the earth.

202
00:12:35,556 --> 00:12:38,023
I remember it
as a place...

203
00:12:38,058 --> 00:12:40,526
a place of color.

204
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:44,897
I remember, jo-jo,
that in the autumn...

205
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:46,148
jo-jo?

206
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:47,399
In the autumn...

207
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:49,401
the leaves changed...

208
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:51,287
turned different colors.

209
00:12:51,322 --> 00:12:54,406
Red, orange, gold.

210
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:56,292
I remember streams of water

211
00:12:56,327 --> 00:12:58,794
that flowed down hillsides.

212
00:12:58,829 --> 00:13:01,914
And the water
was sparkling and clear.

213
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:04,416
And i remember
clouds in the sky.

214
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:06,302
White...

215
00:13:06,337 --> 00:13:08,804
billowy things...

216
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:11,307
floated like ships, like sails.

217
00:13:11,342 --> 00:13:13,175
You see, in ancient times

218
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,678
that's the way men
moved their ships

219
00:13:15,713 --> 00:13:16,929
across the water.

220
00:13:16,964 --> 00:13:20,683
They unfurled large sections
of canvas against the wind

221
00:13:20,718 --> 00:13:23,819
and the wind moved them.

222
00:13:23,854 --> 00:13:25,688
And i remember...

223
00:13:25,723 --> 00:13:28,824
night skies.

224
00:13:28,859 --> 00:13:30,075
Night skies...

225
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:33,829
like endless
black velvet.

226
00:13:33,864 --> 00:13:36,332
With stars...

227
00:13:36,367 --> 00:13:38,200
sometimes a moon

228
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:41,587
hung as if suspended by wires...

229
00:13:41,622 --> 00:13:42,838
lit from inside.

230
00:13:42,873 --> 00:13:45,341
What's night, captain?

231
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,209
Night...

232
00:13:47,843 --> 00:13:49,712
night was a quiet time, jo-jo,

233
00:13:49,747 --> 00:13:52,214
when the earth went to sleep.

234
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:55,601
Kind of like a cover
that it pulled over itself.

235
00:13:55,636 --> 00:13:58,721
Not like here where
we have the two suns

236
00:13:59,355 --> 00:14:01,223
always shining,
always burning.

237
00:14:01,258 --> 00:14:03,108
It was darkness, jo-jo.

238
00:14:03,143 --> 00:14:06,862
Darkness that
felt like...

239
00:14:08,148 --> 00:14:09,982
...like a cool hand

240
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:12,618
just brushed past tired eyes.

241
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:17,623
And there was snow
on the winter nights-

242
00:14:17,658 --> 00:14:19,491
gossamer stuff-

243
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:21,377
floated down

244
00:14:21,412 --> 00:14:23,245
and covered the earth,

245
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,999
made it all white,
cool.

246
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:28,884
And in the mornings,

247
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:32,004
we could go out
and build a snowman.

248
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:35,140
See our breath in the air.

249
00:14:35,758 --> 00:14:38,260
And it was good then.

250
00:14:38,295 --> 00:14:39,511
It was right.

251
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:42,014
Captain, why did
you leave there?

252
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:45,017
Well, we thought
we could find

253
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:47,519
another place
like earth

254
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:50,022
but with different
beauties, jo-jo.

255
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:53,275
And we found
this place.

256
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:55,778
We thought we
could escape war.

257
00:14:55,813 --> 00:14:58,530
We thought we could...

258
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:01,033
well, we thought
that we could build

259
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:02,918
an even better place.

260
00:15:02,953 --> 00:15:05,537
And it took us
30 years to find out

261
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:08,674
that we'd left our home
a billion miles away

262
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:12,428
to be only visitors here,
transients...

263
00:15:12,463 --> 00:15:16,181
because you can't put down
roots in this ground.

264
00:15:16,216 --> 00:15:18,050
But it was too late.

265
00:15:18,085 --> 00:15:20,552
So we spent 30 years

266
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:23,055
watching a clock and a calendar.

267
00:15:33,315 --> 00:15:35,200
And waiting.

268
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:40,823
But we're not going
to wait any longer, jo-jo.

269
00:15:42,825 --> 00:15:44,710
We can't wait another...

270
00:15:44,745 --> 00:15:46,578
day...

271
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:49,081
not another hour.

272
00:15:50,966 --> 00:15:54,086
We're going back
to the earth...

273
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:55,971
right now.

274
00:16:08,769 --> 00:16:09,985
Al baines?

275
00:16:11,854 --> 00:16:14,990
Al baines!

276
00:16:15,025 --> 00:16:16,241
Al!

277
00:16:16,276 --> 00:16:18,110
You hear
that noise?

278
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:21,613
All of you,
do you hear that?

279
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:23,499
That's not a meteor.

280
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,870
That's not
wishful thinking.

281
00:16:27,905 --> 00:16:29,121
That's not...

282
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:31,006
make-believe
or a phantom.

283
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:34,760
Those are rockets.

284
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:39,131
That's the ship.

285
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:44,136
The ship is here.

286
00:17:38,774 --> 00:17:40,659
Mr. Benteen?

287
00:17:40,694 --> 00:17:43,162
I'm benteen.

288
00:17:43,197 --> 00:17:45,531
Colonel sloane,
commanding thegalaxy vi.

289
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:49,284
Our orders are to transport
you all back to earth.

290
00:17:58,427 --> 00:18:00,295
Oh, welcome, sir!

291
00:18:03,432 --> 00:18:05,300
Colonel...

292
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:07,803
colonel, colonel,
what took you so long?

293
00:18:07,838 --> 00:18:10,939
Well, we've been traveling
for six months...

294
00:18:10,974 --> 00:18:12,808
oh, a hundred
times more.

295
00:18:12,843 --> 00:18:14,059
We've waited
30 years.

296
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:16,562
We got your message
two months ago

297
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:18,447
then we listened
and listened...

298
00:18:18,482 --> 00:18:20,315
we did it.

299
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,567
...then nothing more.

300
00:18:21,602 --> 00:18:23,452
We tried to
transmit to you,

301
00:18:23,487 --> 00:18:25,320
but we simply
couldn't get through.

302
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:27,823
But when we heard
your acknowledgement,

303
00:18:27,858 --> 00:18:29,708
we knew you'd received
the initial message.

304
00:18:30,325 --> 00:18:31,577
Does it all
look like this?

305
00:18:31,612 --> 00:18:32,828
The whole place?

306
00:18:32,863 --> 00:18:34,079
Yes, it all
looks like this.

307
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:35,330
Craggy mountains,

308
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:38,333
salt flats, two suns,
perpetually shining.

309
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:40,335
Yes, it all
looks like this.

310
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,587
30 years.

311
00:18:41,622 --> 00:18:42,838
Yes, 30 years.

312
00:18:42,873 --> 00:18:45,340
Some here have never
seen earth, colonel.

313
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:48,477
Some older people
don't remember
what it looks like.

314
00:18:48,512 --> 00:18:51,597
We are to get you on board
as soon as possible.

315
00:18:51,632 --> 00:18:54,733
We figured you should be
ready to leave thursday.

316
00:18:54,768 --> 00:18:56,985
That gives you three days
to arrange things.

317
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:00,739
Unfortunately, your people can
only take what they can carry.

318
00:19:00,774 --> 00:19:01,990
There are over 150, right?

319
00:19:02,025 --> 00:19:03,859
187- men, women and children.

320
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:06,361
But they'll travel
standing on their heads.

321
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:08,864
That won't be necessary,
mr. Benteen.

322
00:19:08,899 --> 00:19:12,251
It'll be a little crowded,
but we'll fit you all in.

323
00:19:12,286 --> 00:19:14,119
I can see
you're very used to

324
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:16,004
a great deal
of space, sir.

325
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:17,873
Space... and heat!

326
00:19:17,908 --> 00:19:19,124
Yes, i can
believe it.

327
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:21,627
Captain, jo-jo wants
to meet the colonel.

328
00:19:21,662 --> 00:19:22,878
Colonel sloane,
jo-jo.

329
00:19:22,913 --> 00:19:24,129
How do you do?

330
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:26,632
Can i give you
a kiss, captain?

331
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:27,883
You sure can.

332
00:19:27,918 --> 00:19:30,385
Can jo-jo inspect
the ship, colonel?

333
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,888
Certainly, take him
right up there.

334
00:19:32,923 --> 00:19:34,139
The earth!

335
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:36,024
Colonel, has
the earth changed?

336
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:37,276
No, not too much.

337
00:19:37,311 --> 00:19:38,527
Is it still green?

338
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:40,395
It's still green.

339
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:41,029
And the cities?

340
00:19:41,064 --> 00:19:42,898
And the cities
still stand.

341
00:19:42,933 --> 00:19:44,149
And war?

342
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:46,652
One pops up here,
another dies out there,

343
00:19:46,687 --> 00:19:49,154
but through a miracle
and the grace of god

344
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:51,039
we never had the hydrogen war.

345
00:19:51,074 --> 00:19:51,657
Captain benteen.

346
00:19:51,692 --> 00:19:52,908
George, george.

347
00:19:52,943 --> 00:19:55,410
Colonel sloane,
this is george morris.

348
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:56,662
How do you do?

349
00:19:56,697 --> 00:19:58,547
I think you'll find it

350
00:19:58,582 --> 00:20:01,049
very much as you
left it, mr. Benteen.

351
00:20:01,084 --> 00:20:04,419
Captainbenteen.

352
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:06,171
That's what
people call me.

353
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:09,308
This place was my
responsibility for 30 years.

354
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:11,176
You've done
quite a job.

355
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:12,427
But you
can rest easy.

356
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:14,930
We'll handle
the responsibility.

357
00:20:14,965 --> 00:20:16,815
I've become
used to the functions.

358
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:19,318
Your quarters,
they're underground.

359
00:20:19,353 --> 00:20:19,935
As i was-

360
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:21,820
cooler there,
mr. Benteen?

361
00:20:21,855 --> 00:20:22,437
I... where?

362
00:20:23,071 --> 00:20:24,323
I didn't hear what you said.

363
00:20:24,358 --> 00:20:26,575
Your underground rooms,
are they cooler?

364
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:28,443
They're
refrigerated.

365
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:29,695
But it's
captainbenteen.

366
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:32,197
Captain benteen's
kept us alive here.

367
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:34,082
I believe it,
captain benteen.

368
00:20:34,117 --> 00:20:36,585
Can i show you
the ship, gentlemen?

369
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,453
Yes, yes.

370
00:20:48,463 --> 00:20:50,349
Al...

371
00:20:50,384 --> 00:20:51,600
al baines.

372
00:20:51,635 --> 00:20:52,851
Where's your sling?

373
00:20:52,886 --> 00:20:54,102
It's a magnesium band.

374
00:20:54,137 --> 00:20:57,222
Colonel sloane says
my arm will be perfect

375
00:20:57,257 --> 00:20:59,107
by the end of the week.

376
00:21:01,109 --> 00:21:02,978
Look at julie's cheek.

377
00:21:03,013 --> 00:21:05,480
Isn't it
incredible, captain?

378
00:21:05,515 --> 00:21:07,983
Look, colonel sloane
gave it to me.

379
00:21:08,018 --> 00:21:09,234
It's a medicinal bandage.

380
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:11,119
You wear it
for 24 hours...

381
00:21:11,154 --> 00:21:14,239
it accelerates
the growth of new skin.

382
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:16,124
You can hardly
see the bruise.

383
00:21:17,993 --> 00:21:19,244
It really is incredible.

384
00:21:19,878 --> 00:21:21,747
Looks like i've
lost my practice.

385
00:21:21,782 --> 00:21:22,881
Al, do me a favor.

386
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:24,132
Put that
in a sling.

387
00:21:24,167 --> 00:21:26,635
I've treated hundreds
of broken arms

388
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:31,006
and the only way to cure them
is to keep them immobile.

389
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:44,770
As you all know, in less than
36 hours, we'll be departing.

390
00:21:44,805 --> 00:21:49,157
Weight allowance has been
set at 14 pounds per person.

391
00:21:49,192 --> 00:21:52,277
When we leave here, we'll
begin a process of notation

392
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:56,665
to establish what your
personal belongings will be

393
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,667
and what they will-

394
00:21:58,702 --> 00:21:59,918
colonel sloane.

395
00:21:59,953 --> 00:22:02,421
Hope i'm not intruding, captain.

396
00:22:02,456 --> 00:22:03,672
Of course not.

397
00:22:03,707 --> 00:22:05,540
I was giving
the weight requirements.

398
00:22:05,575 --> 00:22:07,426
We'll handle
that tomorrow.

399
00:22:07,461 --> 00:22:09,294
When i heard
you were meeting,

400
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:11,179
i brought engle
and rafferty.

401
00:22:11,214 --> 00:22:14,933
You've all been asking so
many questions about earth

402
00:22:14,968 --> 00:22:16,802
i thought we'd
answer a few more.

403
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:20,055
The purpose of this meeting
is departure problems.

404
00:22:20,689 --> 00:22:23,308
Colonel, my folks
were from san diego.

405
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:24,559
What's california like?

406
00:22:24,594 --> 00:22:26,695
Sunny and warm,
most of the time.

407
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:29,815
Los angeles is the biggest
city in the world now.

408
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:32,951
I feel that these
questions can best be answered

409
00:22:32,986 --> 00:22:34,202
at a later time.

410
00:22:34,237 --> 00:22:35,454
Do they still
have public schools?

411
00:22:35,489 --> 00:22:36,705
Oh, yes.

412
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:39,958
And they're pretty much
the same as they were.

413
00:22:39,993 --> 00:22:43,078
Except they're larger,
better-equipped,

414
00:22:43,113 --> 00:22:44,329
more adequately staffed.

415
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:47,466
There's a whole new
system of visual aids now.

416
00:22:47,501 --> 00:22:49,334
Many classes
are televised.

417
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:51,837
If a student is
learning about, oh...

418
00:22:51,872 --> 00:22:53,722
we'll say the
grand canyon,

419
00:22:53,757 --> 00:22:56,842
they do an actual program
right there on the scene

420
00:22:56,877 --> 00:22:59,344
that's fed into the classroom

421
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:01,229
on a new tape device.

422
00:23:01,264 --> 00:23:04,232
Colonel sloane, are
there still major leagues?

423
00:23:04,267 --> 00:23:06,735
My dad used to tell me
all about baseball

424
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:07,986
and the world series.

425
00:23:08,021 --> 00:23:09,855
Two leagues, same as before.

426
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,106
American and national.

427
00:23:11,141 --> 00:23:12,858
What city has the dodgers now?

428
00:23:12,893 --> 00:23:14,743
Still los angeles.

429
00:23:14,778 --> 00:23:17,245
They came in tenth
last season.

430
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:22,868
After we're finished here,
let's improvise a ball and a bat

431
00:23:22,903 --> 00:23:25,370
have ourselves a ball game.

432
00:23:25,405 --> 00:23:27,873
It's much too hot
for that kind of activity.

433
00:23:27,908 --> 00:23:29,758
We might sing here in the cave

434
00:23:29,793 --> 00:23:32,260
we haven't done
that in some time.

435
00:23:32,295 --> 00:23:35,380
Why don't we show the colonel
the music we can make?

436
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:37,382
Let's let him hear
some real harmony.

437
00:23:58,036 --> 00:23:59,287
Two more.

438
00:23:59,322 --> 00:24:01,156
Come on, baby, come on.

439
00:24:06,161 --> 00:24:09,297
That is the universal
language, captain.

440
00:24:09,332 --> 00:24:10,549
Baseball?

441
00:24:10,584 --> 00:24:11,800
Mm-hmm.

442
00:24:11,835 --> 00:24:14,302
You have a very limited
vocabulary, colonel.

443
00:24:14,337 --> 00:24:16,171
Do you have any idea

444
00:24:16,206 --> 00:24:18,673
what the temperature
is out here right now?

445
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:21,810
Well, not by degrees
but certainly by discomfort.

446
00:24:21,845 --> 00:24:24,312
At this time of day
it's about 110.

447
00:24:24,347 --> 00:24:26,181
Don't know about
your crew members

448
00:24:26,216 --> 00:24:28,066
being able to stand
that heat,

449
00:24:28,101 --> 00:24:30,569
but i do know
about my own people.

450
00:24:30,604 --> 00:24:33,688
They're going to suffer
for this little athletic event.

451
00:24:33,723 --> 00:24:36,825
For some of the older people,
it might be serious.

452
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,693
Aw, it's only
a game, benteen.

453
00:24:38,728 --> 00:24:40,579
If they're suffering,

454
00:24:40,614 --> 00:24:43,081
my guess is that it
might be worth it.

455
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:51,706
Colonel, when we get aboard
your ship, you'll be in command.

456
00:24:51,741 --> 00:24:54,209
You tell us what to do,
where to go,

457
00:24:54,244 --> 00:24:56,094
and we'll fall
right into line.

458
00:24:56,129 --> 00:24:58,597
But here,
in this place,

459
00:24:58,632 --> 00:24:59,848
i'm in command.

460
00:24:59,883 --> 00:25:01,716
Now, mr. Benteen...

461
00:25:01,751 --> 00:25:02,968
captainben...

462
00:25:03,003 --> 00:25:06,104
i'm not trying to usurp
your authority, captain.

463
00:25:06,139 --> 00:25:07,355
I just don't see what harm

464
00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:09,858
a little baseball
game could be.

465
00:25:09,893 --> 00:25:12,360
That's not your concern,
is it, colonel?

466
00:25:12,395 --> 00:25:15,480
The well-being of
these people, their health...

467
00:25:15,515 --> 00:25:17,983
that's my concern.

468
00:25:24,524 --> 00:25:27,626
Galaxy crew members,
inside the ship.

469
00:25:27,661 --> 00:25:29,494
Lower the port.

470
00:25:31,379 --> 00:25:32,631
Now, my friends,
time to rest.

471
00:25:32,666 --> 00:25:33,882
Go to your homes.

472
00:25:33,917 --> 00:25:37,002
I'll announce
when the new day will begin.

473
00:25:37,037 --> 00:25:38,887
Go to your homes.

474
00:25:53,268 --> 00:25:54,519
Happy now, captain?

475
00:25:54,554 --> 00:25:55,770
I was never unhappy.

476
00:25:55,805 --> 00:25:58,273
I just know what's right
and what's wrong.

477
00:25:58,308 --> 00:25:59,524
I see.

478
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:03,278
Colonel, i have to ask
your men to stay on the ship.

479
00:26:03,313 --> 00:26:05,780
I don't want
the people distracted.

480
00:26:05,815 --> 00:26:07,666
You do have
a weighty fist, captain.

481
00:26:07,701 --> 00:26:11,419
Well, had it been one ounce
lighter, there'd be no one here

482
00:26:11,454 --> 00:26:13,288
to go back with you, colonel.

483
00:26:13,323 --> 00:26:16,424
I've held these people
together- by will.

484
00:26:16,459 --> 00:26:20,795
They'd have died if they
hadn't had someone to hang onto.

485
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,681
They'd have
withered away.

486
00:26:22,716 --> 00:26:23,932
Hmm.

487
00:26:23,967 --> 00:26:27,686
Well, they're not going
to wither away now, captain.

488
00:26:27,721 --> 00:26:29,554
Why don't you just relax?

489
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:33,308
That's a luxury
i've never been able to afford.

490
00:26:33,343 --> 00:26:35,193
I've never taken a wife.

491
00:26:35,228 --> 00:26:38,947
I've never been able to think
only of myself.

492
00:26:38,982 --> 00:26:40,198
I've...

493
00:26:40,815 --> 00:26:45,203
i've been confessor, governor,

494
00:26:45,238 --> 00:26:47,072
father figure, if you will.

495
00:26:47,107 --> 00:26:48,957
And if i hadn't been,

496
00:26:48,992 --> 00:26:51,459
there'd be no
life here today.

497
00:26:51,494 --> 00:26:53,962
Those are my people, colonel.

498
00:26:53,997 --> 00:26:56,464
Do you understand that?

499
00:26:56,499 --> 00:26:58,333
Mypeople.

500
00:27:04,222 --> 00:27:05,974
What's with him,
colonel?

501
00:27:06,009 --> 00:27:07,225
What's his problem?

502
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,728
Oh, suffer him
a while longer.

503
00:27:09,763 --> 00:27:12,847
He's really quite
a guy, you know.

504
00:27:12,882 --> 00:27:14,733
Quite a guy.

505
00:27:14,768 --> 00:27:17,235
He just has
one aberration:

506
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:19,738
He thinks he's a god.

507
00:27:19,773 --> 00:27:22,857
And we're booting him
out of his heaven.

508
00:27:28,596 --> 00:27:33,184
Twilight zonewill continue
after station identification.

509
00:28:16,978 --> 00:28:18,229
Colonel sloane?

510
00:28:18,264 --> 00:28:19,481
Yes.

511
00:28:19,516 --> 00:28:20,115
Captain benteen is here.

512
00:28:20,732 --> 00:28:23,234
Oh, yes.

513
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,622
Oh, come in, captain.
Come in.

514
00:28:27,657 --> 00:28:28,239
Colonel.

515
00:28:28,274 --> 00:28:31,376
Well, how are you today?

516
00:28:31,411 --> 00:28:32,627
Fine. Thank you.

517
00:28:32,662 --> 00:28:34,496
I have a list
of your passengers,

518
00:28:34,531 --> 00:28:36,998
and their
approximate weights.

519
00:28:37,033 --> 00:28:39,501
Also, the weight
of their belongings

520
00:28:39,536 --> 00:28:40,752
noted after each name.

521
00:28:40,787 --> 00:28:42,003
We weighed on our scale,

522
00:28:42,038 --> 00:28:43,888
and i'm afraid
it's an old-timer,

523
00:28:43,923 --> 00:28:45,757
underweighs about
four or five pounds.

524
00:28:45,792 --> 00:28:49,511
All i wanted was an
approximation, captain.

525
00:28:49,546 --> 00:28:51,396
Oh, this will
do just fine.

526
00:28:51,431 --> 00:28:53,264
We'll weigh them out
on our own equipment

527
00:28:53,299 --> 00:28:55,767
before we blast off anyway.

528
00:28:55,802 --> 00:28:58,903
Well, captain,
today's wednesday.

529
00:28:58,938 --> 00:29:00,772
Tomorrow we leave.

530
00:29:00,807 --> 00:29:03,274
Tomorrow you go back
to mother earth.

531
00:29:03,309 --> 00:29:05,160
Back to modern times.

532
00:29:05,195 --> 00:29:07,028
Though i honestly wonder

533
00:29:07,063 --> 00:29:08,913
whether it'll be
to your liking.

534
00:29:08,948 --> 00:29:10,782
Because the way
you'll be lionized

535
00:29:10,817 --> 00:29:12,667
when you get
back to earth...

536
00:29:12,702 --> 00:29:15,170
you know, you're
referred to in the press

537
00:29:15,205 --> 00:29:17,038
as "the lost pioneers."

538
00:29:17,073 --> 00:29:20,175
They'll make quite a thing
out of you when you land.

539
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:22,043
I suppose
it's inevitable.

540
00:29:22,078 --> 00:29:23,928
I guess that seems
to be your fate.

541
00:29:23,963 --> 00:29:25,797
And wherever
your people settle,

542
00:29:25,832 --> 00:29:27,682
they'll be met
by brass bands,

543
00:29:27,717 --> 00:29:30,185
welcoming committees,
keys to the city...

544
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:31,436
keys to the city.

545
00:29:31,471 --> 00:29:33,938
Yeah, the government
has had inquiries

546
00:29:34,556 --> 00:29:37,058
from literally
thousands of relatives.

547
00:29:37,093 --> 00:29:40,812
They'll just have time to
look into a television camera

548
00:29:40,847 --> 00:29:42,063
and then they'llscatter-

549
00:29:42,098 --> 00:29:43,948
all over the 50 states.

550
00:29:43,983 --> 00:29:46,451
They won't be scattered,
we'll go together.

551
00:29:46,486 --> 00:29:47,702
I was talking about

552
00:29:47,737 --> 00:29:49,571
when you get back
on earth, captain.

553
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:51,456
Well, so am i, colonel.

554
00:29:51,491 --> 00:29:52,707
We won't be splitting up.

555
00:29:52,742 --> 00:29:55,210
Not those people, not my people.

556
00:29:55,245 --> 00:29:56,461
We'll stay together.

557
00:29:56,496 --> 00:29:59,581
You mean this is
what you've all decided to do?

558
00:29:59,616 --> 00:30:02,083
No decision was necessary.

559
00:30:02,118 --> 00:30:05,220
You have asked them,
haven't you?

560
00:30:05,255 --> 00:30:08,973
Colonel, asking them would be
exactly like asking a child

561
00:30:09,008 --> 00:30:10,842
if he wants some more ice cream.

562
00:30:10,877 --> 00:30:13,978
They're just like
children, colonel.

563
00:30:14,013 --> 00:30:15,847
The majority of them are adults.

564
00:30:15,882 --> 00:30:17,098
Chronologically, yes.

565
00:30:17,133 --> 00:30:20,235
They range in age
from six months to 60 years.

566
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:23,354
But psychologically and
socially, they're children.

567
00:30:23,389 --> 00:30:27,108
I've kept these people alive
and together all these years.

568
00:30:27,143 --> 00:30:28,993
When we get back to earth,

569
00:30:29,028 --> 00:30:31,496
i will simply have to
continue the process.

570
00:30:31,531 --> 00:30:33,615
Have you told them this?

571
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:36,751
There's no need to tell them,
they know it already.

572
00:30:36,786 --> 00:30:40,505
You mean they know that
after 30 years of waiting,

573
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:43,007
after 30 years of
living in a compound,

574
00:30:43,042 --> 00:30:46,127
that they're going to
travel a billion miles

575
00:30:46,162 --> 00:30:49,264
just to walk single file
into another one.

576
00:30:49,299 --> 00:30:51,132
They wouldn't have it
any other way.

577
00:30:51,167 --> 00:30:54,769
Colonel, you don't understand,
and i don't blame you,

578
00:30:54,804 --> 00:30:57,272
that these people are children.

579
00:30:57,307 --> 00:30:59,774
And to transport them
a billion miles

580
00:30:59,809 --> 00:31:03,528
and then land them in a
strange place and abandon them

581
00:31:03,563 --> 00:31:05,396
would be an act of cruelty.

582
00:31:05,431 --> 00:31:07,282
It would be a crime.

583
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:10,401
Would you do me
a small favor, captain?

584
00:31:10,436 --> 00:31:11,653
Of course.

585
00:31:11,688 --> 00:31:14,155
Ask them.

586
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:21,663
Outside the cities on earth,
there are suburban areas.

587
00:31:21,698 --> 00:31:25,416
This was a major living change
that took place in the 1950s:

588
00:31:25,451 --> 00:31:27,919
Decentralization
of the population area.

589
00:31:27,954 --> 00:31:31,055
There's certain aspects
of earth living

590
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:32,307
we should touch on.

591
00:31:32,342 --> 00:31:33,675
We will not
concern ourselves

592
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:36,811
with colder areas,
the northeastern states

593
00:31:36,846 --> 00:31:39,314
and some upper sections
of the great plains.

594
00:31:39,349 --> 00:31:42,183
Captain, i want
to live in wisconsin.

595
00:31:42,218 --> 00:31:45,320
So you better tell us
about frostbite.

596
00:31:45,972 --> 00:31:48,439
What about the state
of oregon, captain?

597
00:31:48,474 --> 00:31:49,691
That's where betty and i

598
00:31:49,726 --> 00:31:50,942
want to settle.

599
00:31:50,977 --> 00:31:52,827
I can remember
the forests there.

600
00:31:52,862 --> 00:31:55,330
What about the eastern
seaboard, captain?

601
00:31:55,365 --> 00:31:57,081
The finger lake district

602
00:31:57,116 --> 00:31:58,950
in upper new york
state, captain?

603
00:31:58,985 --> 00:32:01,336
Is there still a new york city?

604
00:32:01,371 --> 00:32:02,587
You don't understand.

605
00:32:02,622 --> 00:32:05,089
I'd like to make
one thing very clear.

606
00:32:05,124 --> 00:32:07,592
You'll all be able
to meet your relatives

607
00:32:07,627 --> 00:32:10,712
and possibly visit with them
for even a week or more.

608
00:32:10,747 --> 00:32:13,214
We'll stay
together as a community

609
00:32:13,249 --> 00:32:15,717
in whatever
land grant we can get

610
00:32:15,752 --> 00:32:18,853
or whatever prescribed area
can be arranged.

611
00:32:18,888 --> 00:32:21,222
I'd also like
to assure you that-

612
00:32:21,257 --> 00:32:23,725
and, i hope,
put all your fears to rest-

613
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,478
i'm going to continue
as your guide and consultant.

614
00:32:27,513 --> 00:32:31,232
I guarantee none of you will
want for my help or advice.

615
00:32:31,267 --> 00:32:32,233
Captain?

616
00:32:33,484 --> 00:32:35,370
Julie and i...

617
00:32:35,405 --> 00:32:38,489
julie and i
were planning on farming.

618
00:32:38,524 --> 00:32:40,491
That's a wonderful idea,
a fine idea.

619
00:32:40,526 --> 00:32:41,743
Of course we'll farm.

620
00:32:41,778 --> 00:32:44,879
As we farmed here,
only better- more rainfall.

621
00:32:44,914 --> 00:32:47,382
Remember, one sun, not two.

622
00:32:47,417 --> 00:32:49,884
You don't have to shield
crops from the sun.

623
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:51,753
The sun helps them.

624
00:32:51,788 --> 00:32:54,255
You'll farm, al,
certainly we'll farm.

625
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:57,392
Julie has relatives
in the state of washington.

626
00:32:57,427 --> 00:32:59,260
We'll settle there.

627
00:32:59,295 --> 00:33:01,763
It would be too cold
for you there, al.

628
00:33:01,798 --> 00:33:04,265
It would be too cold
for all of you.

629
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,516
Now, wherever we settle,

630
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,653
i guarantee
there will be good farming.

631
00:33:08,688 --> 00:33:10,521
I'll see
to that.

632
00:33:15,526 --> 00:33:18,663
Well, now,
what's the matter with you?

633
00:33:18,698 --> 00:33:21,165
What's the matter
with all of you?

634
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:29,424
You don't understand, captain.

635
00:33:29,459 --> 00:33:31,292
We, uh...

636
00:33:31,327 --> 00:33:33,795
we don't plan to stay together.

637
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:35,680
Well, you don't understand, al.

638
00:33:35,715 --> 00:33:38,800
You never did understand
much of anything.

639
00:33:38,835 --> 00:33:42,553
Now, al, if we did split up,
if we went our separate ways,

640
00:33:42,588 --> 00:33:45,056
i seriously doubt
if we could survive.

641
00:33:45,091 --> 00:33:48,192
Explain it to him,
al, go ahead.

642
00:33:48,227 --> 00:33:50,061
Yes, go on, tell him, al.

643
00:33:50,096 --> 00:33:51,312
We'll survive, captain.

644
00:33:51,347 --> 00:33:53,197
If any of us want
to stay together,

645
00:33:53,232 --> 00:33:55,066
that'll be their right.

646
00:33:55,101 --> 00:33:57,568
If any of us want to go off
on their own,

647
00:33:57,603 --> 00:34:00,071
that'll be
their right,
too.

648
00:34:00,106 --> 00:34:02,206
Am i wrong, colonel?

649
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:05,326
No, you're not wrong.

650
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,830
Our orders are to take you
back to earth as a group.

651
00:34:08,865 --> 00:34:11,966
On earth, you're free
to do what you please.

652
00:34:12,001 --> 00:34:13,968
Colonel sloane, i tell you now

653
00:34:14,003 --> 00:34:17,722
to let us settle
our differences alone.

654
00:34:17,757 --> 00:34:20,224
There are no differences,
captain.

655
00:34:20,259 --> 00:34:21,843
There are differences!

656
00:34:21,878 --> 00:34:25,596
There are changes
that have taken place on earth

657
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,099
that none of us
are prepared for.

658
00:34:28,134 --> 00:34:31,235
Now, these... these people,

659
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:33,604
they make it seem
like a big holiday,

660
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:36,741
like everything's easy,
like the good life...

661
00:34:36,776 --> 00:34:37,992
you can pluck it
off a tree!

662
00:34:38,027 --> 00:34:40,361
Well, my people,

663
00:34:40,396 --> 00:34:43,498
i don't want any one of you
to be disillusioned.

664
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:45,366
I tell you now

665
00:34:45,401 --> 00:34:49,754
that wherever men live
they grub and they struggle.

666
00:34:49,789 --> 00:34:51,622
They dig to stay alive.

667
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:53,508
This i know.

668
00:34:53,543 --> 00:34:56,627
This is true, this is a fact.

669
00:34:56,662 --> 00:35:01,632
But together-
that's the word, together-

670
00:35:01,667 --> 00:35:05,386
we must stay together.

671
00:35:05,421 --> 00:35:08,272
I want you to
think of that now

672
00:35:08,307 --> 00:35:11,392
and i want you to
say it with me out loud.

673
00:35:11,427 --> 00:35:13,644
All of you:

674
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:16,147
"Together."

675
00:35:16,182 --> 00:35:20,151
Together.

676
00:35:20,186 --> 00:35:21,402
Together.

677
00:35:21,437 --> 00:35:22,653
Together

678
00:35:22,688 --> 00:35:25,156
together... together.

679
00:35:26,407 --> 00:35:33,414
Together.

680
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:38,920
Together.

681
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:45,676
Together.

682
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,126
Well, i figured out

683
00:36:52,161 --> 00:36:54,629
the compartment
assignments, captain.

684
00:36:54,664 --> 00:36:57,131
I'd like to go
over them with you.

685
00:36:57,166 --> 00:36:59,000
The compartment
assignments.

686
00:36:59,035 --> 00:37:00,251
There's not much time.

687
00:37:00,286 --> 00:37:02,136
We still have
checking to do.

688
00:37:02,171 --> 00:37:04,639
There's a decompression
problem

689
00:37:04,674 --> 00:37:06,507
also a moment
of weightlessness

690
00:37:06,542 --> 00:37:09,010
after we leave
the atmosphere...

691
00:37:09,045 --> 00:37:11,512
colonel, do you know
what we called you?

692
00:37:11,547 --> 00:37:12,763
The messiah.

693
00:37:12,798 --> 00:37:16,517
We called you
the messiah.

694
00:37:16,552 --> 00:37:17,768
You did?

695
00:37:17,803 --> 00:37:21,522
We said you'd bring...
freedom.

696
00:37:21,557 --> 00:37:24,025
That's not
what you've brought at all.

697
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:26,527
What did we bring,
captain?

698
00:37:26,562 --> 00:37:29,413
Selfishness.

699
00:37:29,448 --> 00:37:31,916
Dissatisfaction,
divisiveness.

700
00:37:31,951 --> 00:37:34,418
With all the misery
we've had here,

701
00:37:34,453 --> 00:37:37,538
those were germs
we never suffered.

702
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:40,675
Captain benteen, uh...

703
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:43,794
i brought nothing
but a ship and a crew-

704
00:37:43,829 --> 00:37:45,680
uh, a means of escape.

705
00:37:45,715 --> 00:37:49,433
You say you have
no diseases, no viruses.

706
00:37:49,468 --> 00:37:51,936
Well, has it ever
occurred to you why?

707
00:37:52,553 --> 00:37:55,690
It's because you live
in a test tube, captain.

708
00:37:55,725 --> 00:37:57,558
Antiseptic
and germ-free.

709
00:37:57,593 --> 00:37:59,443
And also sterile.

710
00:38:00,061 --> 00:38:02,563
Oh, sure, you're a group,
sure, you're a cell,

711
00:38:02,598 --> 00:38:05,700
but that's all over
with now, captain.

712
00:38:05,735 --> 00:38:08,819
Now it's time to be
what god meant you to be-

713
00:38:08,854 --> 00:38:10,705
individuals.

714
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,573
A man, a woman, a child,
a being.

715
00:38:12,608 --> 00:38:15,076
It's time
to break that test tube.

716
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:18,212
It's time to rejoin the race
of men.

717
00:38:18,247 --> 00:38:20,715
I remember
the race of men, colonel.

718
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,834
I remember the earth.

719
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:28,839
It's incredible.

720
00:38:28,874 --> 00:38:32,593
Absolutely incredible.

721
00:38:32,628 --> 00:38:35,096
For 30 years, i've been wrong.

722
00:38:35,131 --> 00:38:37,598
30 years i've been lying
to my people.

723
00:38:37,633 --> 00:38:42,603
I've told them about an earth
that doesn't exist.

724
00:38:42,638 --> 00:38:45,740
I've told them
about an imaginary garden.

725
00:38:46,357 --> 00:38:49,493
I've told them about
a planet a billion miles away

726
00:38:49,528 --> 00:38:51,362
that has no more substance
than a wish.

727
00:38:52,363 --> 00:38:54,865
We can't go back
to earth, colonel.

728
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:57,368
It's too late for us.

729
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:01,756
We cannot go back there.

730
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:08,629
Everybody?

731
00:39:11,132 --> 00:39:11,766
Everybody!

732
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:14,268
Come, gather 'round.

733
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:18,022
Come.

734
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:20,524
Gather 'round, everybody.

735
00:39:22,393 --> 00:39:24,278
I have something
i must tell you.

736
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:33,037
Now, listen.

737
00:39:33,072 --> 00:39:36,157
I want to tell you things
about earth

738
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:38,042
that you haven't heard before.

739
00:39:38,077 --> 00:39:39,910
Things that are ugly.

740
00:39:39,945 --> 00:39:42,413
Things that are wrong.

741
00:39:42,448 --> 00:39:45,549
Things that cannot
be lived with.

742
00:39:45,584 --> 00:39:48,419
There is violence on earth.

743
00:39:48,454 --> 00:39:50,921
There are hatreds.

744
00:39:50,956 --> 00:39:52,807
And jealousy.

745
00:39:52,842 --> 00:39:55,309
Now, listen to me, listen to me,

746
00:39:55,344 --> 00:39:56,927
and listen carefully.

747
00:39:56,962 --> 00:39:59,430
The earth is a place
we do not know.

748
00:39:59,465 --> 00:40:02,566
The earth is a place
we have never lived in.

749
00:40:02,601 --> 00:40:05,569
It is a society
we do not belong in.

750
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:10,574
If we leave here...

751
00:40:10,609 --> 00:40:13,694
we will die, we willdie!

752
00:40:16,197 --> 00:40:18,699
We'll be
committing suicide

753
00:40:18,734 --> 00:40:19,950
if we go back
to earth.

754
00:40:19,985 --> 00:40:21,836
We will die

755
00:40:21,871 --> 00:40:26,841
of a misery we have
never experienced before-

756
00:40:26,876 --> 00:40:30,594
loneliness.

757
00:40:30,629 --> 00:40:33,714
Loneliness,
like animals in a zoo.

758
00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:39,353
We do not belong there.

759
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:47,862
We do not belong
to his kind.

760
00:40:47,897 --> 00:40:51,615
We do not
belong there.

761
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:55,369
We do not belong there.

762
00:40:55,404 --> 00:40:56,620
Captain benteen?

763
00:40:56,655 --> 00:40:59,740
Why don't you
let your children vote on it?

764
00:40:59,775 --> 00:41:02,993
Only if they know
what's waiting for them.

765
00:41:03,028 --> 00:41:07,381
Only if they know
that the earth is not a garden.

766
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:10,501
Never was a garden!

767
00:41:10,536 --> 00:41:13,003
And it never will be a garden.

768
00:41:13,038 --> 00:41:14,138
Fair enough.

769
00:41:14,755 --> 00:41:15,389
Fair enough.

770
00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:21,011
Then i'll tell you
what earth is.

771
00:41:21,046 --> 00:41:26,016
It's a race of men,
struggling for survival.

772
00:41:26,051 --> 00:41:28,519
Just as you have survived.

773
00:41:28,554 --> 00:41:30,404
And captain benteen
is quite right

774
00:41:30,439 --> 00:41:31,272
when he tells you

775
00:41:31,307 --> 00:41:33,774
it isn't a place
of all beauty.

776
00:41:33,809 --> 00:41:35,025
We may yet have wars

777
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:37,528
and there still
remains prejudice.

778
00:41:37,563 --> 00:41:40,030
And i suppose
as long as men walk

779
00:41:40,065 --> 00:41:43,167
there will be angry men,
jealous men, unforgiving men.

780
00:41:43,202 --> 00:41:48,172
But it has one thing
that you don't have.

781
00:41:48,207 --> 00:41:50,040
One thing.

782
00:41:50,075 --> 00:41:52,543
It lets every man
be his own master.

783
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:54,929
There won't be
any captain benteens

784
00:41:54,964 --> 00:41:56,180
there for you.

785
00:41:56,215 --> 00:41:58,682
There won't be anybody
to tell you

786
00:41:58,717 --> 00:42:00,551
when to eat,
sleep and meet.

787
00:42:00,801 --> 00:42:02,686
There won't be anyone
to tell you

788
00:42:02,721 --> 00:42:05,189
when to dance, what to sing,
or how to play.

789
00:42:05,224 --> 00:42:08,943
Instead of thirst, you may feel
hunger; instead of heat, cold.

790
00:42:08,978 --> 00:42:10,811
But you'll be men
and women.

791
00:42:10,846 --> 00:42:13,314
You won't be sheep.

792
00:42:13,349 --> 00:42:15,816
You won't be a kindergarten.

793
00:42:15,851 --> 00:42:17,067
And when you pray to god,

794
00:42:17,102 --> 00:42:19,570
his name won't be benteen.

795
00:42:19,605 --> 00:42:22,573
A vote now, captain.

796
00:42:22,608 --> 00:42:24,458
And the majority wins.

797
00:42:25,075 --> 00:42:27,578
Those of you
who want to be

798
00:42:27,613 --> 00:42:29,463
on board ten hours
from now

799
00:42:29,498 --> 00:42:31,966
to head back to earth

800
00:42:32,001 --> 00:42:33,217
raise your hands.

801
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:36,146
Let loose now, captain.

802
00:43:36,181 --> 00:43:38,649
For everyone's sake,
let loose!

803
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:50,661
May god help you.

804
00:43:50,696 --> 00:43:52,546
May god help you all.

805
00:43:52,581 --> 00:43:55,666
Tomorrow you think
you'll be getting on a ship

806
00:43:55,701 --> 00:43:57,551
on its way to... paradise.

807
00:43:57,586 --> 00:44:00,054
Well, you'll be on your way
to hell!

808
00:44:00,089 --> 00:44:02,556
What about you, captain?

809
00:44:02,591 --> 00:44:04,058
I'll stay here.

810
00:44:05,926 --> 00:44:08,429
I'll stay here, this is my home.

811
00:44:08,464 --> 00:44:10,931
This is where i belong.

812
00:44:13,934 --> 00:44:15,819
This is where you all belong.

813
00:44:15,854 --> 00:44:18,939
Captain,
we leave at 0800
tomorrow morning.

814
00:44:18,974 --> 00:44:21,442
Don't wait
for a fetching
committee.

815
00:44:21,477 --> 00:44:23,327
0800- if you're
not on board,

816
00:44:23,362 --> 00:44:25,195
you'll never
be on board.

817
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:30,834
If you take off at 0800,
you take off at 0800.

818
00:44:30,869 --> 00:44:33,954
But as for the rest of you,

819
00:44:33,989 --> 00:44:37,091
you can go on this ship

820
00:44:37,126 --> 00:44:40,210
or you can remain here
with me.

821
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:07,488
Captain?

822
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:11,625
Benteen?

823
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:24,755
We know you can hear us.

824
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:29,143
We know you're
in here someplace.

825
00:45:29,178 --> 00:45:31,645
Come out.

826
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,514
Please.

827
00:45:33,549 --> 00:45:37,267
Let us talk to you.

828
00:45:51,031 --> 00:45:53,534
We're leaving now, benteen.

829
00:45:53,569 --> 00:45:56,670
We have to take off
in five minutes

830
00:45:56,705 --> 00:45:59,790
or we'll lose
our orbital position.

831
00:45:59,825 --> 00:46:01,675
It'll be too late for us.

832
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:12,936
Benteen, it has to be now.

833
00:46:12,971 --> 00:46:14,805
Captain, please.

834
00:46:17,307 --> 00:46:19,193
Please come out.

835
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:24,815
If we leave without you,

836
00:46:24,850 --> 00:46:27,951
there'll be no ships
returning here.

837
00:46:27,986 --> 00:46:31,705
This is where you'll live
from this moment on.

838
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:34,208
And this is where you'll die.

839
00:46:36,827 --> 00:46:38,078
All right, benteen.

840
00:46:40,581 --> 00:46:42,466
As you prefer.

841
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:47,471
Come on, let's go, baines.

842
00:46:53,343 --> 00:46:55,846
Good-bye...

843
00:46:55,881 --> 00:46:58,348
captain benteen.

844
00:47:46,396 --> 00:47:48,282
Well, my friends...

845
00:47:48,317 --> 00:47:53,287
any business to transact today?

846
00:47:53,322 --> 00:47:55,789
No business?

847
00:47:56,406 --> 00:47:59,543
Jo-jo.

848
00:47:59,578 --> 00:48:01,411
Jo-jo...

849
00:48:02,663 --> 00:48:05,799
nothing from you today?

850
00:48:05,834 --> 00:48:10,170
Don't you want me to tell you
about the earth, jo-jo?

851
00:48:10,205 --> 00:48:14,558
Don't you want to hear
about the rivers and the seas,

852
00:48:14,593 --> 00:48:17,427
the blue skies and night,
the stars and moon?

853
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:21,815
Don't you want to hear
about all those things today?

854
00:48:24,353 --> 00:48:25,569
There's color on earth.

855
00:48:26,186 --> 00:48:28,071
The change of the seasons,
the wind.

856
00:48:29,975 --> 00:48:33,076
The wind brings the smell
of the ground-

857
00:48:33,111 --> 00:48:36,196
the plants, the seeds,
the roots, the flower petals,

858
00:48:36,231 --> 00:48:38,081
the sap from the trees.

859
00:48:38,116 --> 00:48:41,835
The wind brings with it
the smell of the weather,

860
00:48:41,870 --> 00:48:44,955
the rain, the mist, the fog...

861
00:49:07,227 --> 00:49:10,364
and the earth is green, jo-jo.

862
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:12,866
Green.

863
00:49:12,901 --> 00:49:16,620
The color green.

864
00:49:16,655 --> 00:49:20,374
The feeling green.

865
00:49:20,409 --> 00:49:23,493
There's something
so fresh about it.

866
00:49:23,528 --> 00:49:26,630
So alive about it.

867
00:49:26,665 --> 00:49:29,750
So living about it.

868
00:49:29,785 --> 00:49:34,137
It's the earth.

869
00:49:34,172 --> 00:49:37,891
The earth.

870
00:49:37,926 --> 00:49:41,011
Don't leave me here!

871
00:49:41,046 --> 00:49:43,263
Don't leave me behind.

872
00:49:43,298 --> 00:49:45,148
Don't leave me here!

873
00:49:46,435 --> 00:49:49,519
Please...

874
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:52,656
please, i...

875
00:49:52,691 --> 00:49:57,027
i want to go home.

876
00:50:04,785 --> 00:50:07,287
William benteen,
who had prerogatives.

877
00:50:07,322 --> 00:50:11,675
He could lead, he could direct,
dictate, judge, legislate.

878
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:14,177
It became a habit,
then a pattern...

879
00:50:14,212 --> 00:50:16,046
and finally a necessity.

880
00:50:16,081 --> 00:50:21,685
William benteen, once a god,
now a population of one.

881
00:50:25,389 --> 00:50:27,474
Next ontwilight zone,

882
00:50:27,509 --> 00:50:29,976
an exercise from the typewriter
of charles beaumont.

883
00:50:30,011 --> 00:50:32,863
A sea voyage into
the darker regions of the zone.

884
00:50:32,898 --> 00:50:35,365
Our stars
in alphabetical order:

885
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,984
Gladys cooper,
wilfrid hyde-white,

886
00:50:38,019 --> 00:50:39,236
cecil kellaway,
lee philips,

887
00:50:39,271 --> 00:50:41,121
and joyce van patten.

888
00:50:41,156 --> 00:50:43,623
I'm prepared to pay you double
the amount of your tickets

889
00:50:43,658 --> 00:50:44,875
if you'll abandon your plans.

890
00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:46,743
Not a chance.

891
00:50:46,778 --> 00:50:49,880
Mrs. Ransome,
you're driving me to extremes.

892
00:50:49,915 --> 00:50:51,131
However, if you leave

893
00:50:51,166 --> 00:50:52,999
thelady annenow,

894
00:50:53,034 --> 00:50:54,885
i'll give you
the equivalent

895
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:56,136
of 5,000
american dollars.

896
00:50:56,171 --> 00:50:58,004
And i'll
match that.

897
00:50:58,039 --> 00:50:59,890
Making it a total
of 10,000.

898
00:50:59,925 --> 00:51:00,891
Ever since we
picked this tub,

899
00:51:00,926 --> 00:51:02,759
people have been
trying their best

900
00:51:02,794 --> 00:51:04,010
to discourage us.
I don't know why.

901
00:51:04,045 --> 00:51:05,262
Forget it.

902
00:51:05,297 --> 00:51:06,513
And leave us alone.

903
00:51:06,548 --> 00:51:08,398
Great news, great news.
Very important,

904
00:51:08,433 --> 00:51:10,267
since we've been
talking it over,

905
00:51:10,302 --> 00:51:12,769
millie and old burgess
and the rest of us,

906
00:51:12,804 --> 00:51:14,020
and we've
come to the conclusion

907
00:51:14,055 --> 00:51:16,406
that you won't have to leave
the ship after all.

908
00:51:16,441 --> 00:51:18,275
What my husband is trying to say

909
00:51:18,310 --> 00:51:20,777
is that you won't have to die
after all.
