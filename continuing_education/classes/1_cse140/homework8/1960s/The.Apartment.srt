00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:39,505
On November 1, 1959, the population
of New York City was 8,042,783.

3
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:44,845
If you laid them all end to end, figuring
an average height of 5 feet 6 and half inches,...

4
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:49,023
..they would reach from Times Square
to the outskirts of Karachi, Pakistan.

5
00:01:49,149 --> 00:01:53,562
I know facts like this because I work for
an insurance company, Consolidated Life.

6
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:56,233
We're one of the top five companies
in the country.

7
00:01:56,365 --> 00:02:00,150
Our home office has 31,259 employees,...

8
00:02:00,285 --> 00:02:04,614
..which is more than the entire population
of, uh... Natchez, Mississippi.

9
00:02:04,747 --> 00:02:07,749
I work on the 19th floor.
Ordinary Policy Department,...

10
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:12,003
..Premium Accounting Division,
Section W, desk number 861.

11
00:02:12,547 --> 00:02:17,173
My name is CC Baxter: C for Calvin, C for
Clifford. But most people call me Bud.

12
00:02:17,302 --> 00:02:22,461
I've worked here three years, ten months,
and my take-home pay is $94.70 a week.

13
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:35,893
The hours in our department
are 8.50 to 5.20.

14
00:02:36,027 --> 00:02:38,065
(Bell)

15
00:02:40,864 --> 00:02:45,822
They're staggered by floor so 16 elevators
can handle the 31,259 employees...

16
00:02:45,952 --> 00:02:48,408
..without a serious traffic jam.

17
00:02:48,538 --> 00:02:53,699
As for myself, I very often stay on at the
office and work for an extra hour or two,...

18
00:02:53,835 --> 00:02:55,911
..especially when the weather is bad.

19
00:02:56,046 --> 00:02:59,628
It's not that I'm overly ambitious.
It's just a way of killing time...

20
00:02:59,758 --> 00:03:02,461
..until it's all right for me to go home.

21
00:03:02,592 --> 00:03:06,044
You see, I have this little problem
with my apartment.

22
00:03:07,638 --> 00:03:10,889
I live in the West 60s,
just half a block from Central Park.

23
00:03:11,017 --> 00:03:14,184
My rent is $85 a month.
It used to be $80 until last July...

24
00:03:14,312 --> 00:03:18,225
..when Mrs. Lieberman, the landlady,
put in a second-hand air conditioner.

25
00:03:18,356 --> 00:03:24,028
It's a real nice apartment. Nothing fancy,
but kind of cozy. Just right for a bachelor.

26
00:03:24,155 --> 00:03:27,606
The only problem is
I can't always get in when I want to.

27
00:03:27,742 --> 00:03:30,197
(Latin-beat dance music)

28
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:37,537
(Woman hums along to music)

29
00:03:41,379 --> 00:03:44,712
Cut it out, Sylvia.
We've gotta get out of here.

30
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,876
What's the panic?
I'm gonna have another martini.

31
00:03:48,009 --> 00:03:50,168
Please, Sylvia. It's a quarter of nine.

32
00:03:50,303 --> 00:03:53,637
First you can't wait to get me here
and then it's rush, rush, rush.

33
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:56,967
- Makes a person feel cheap.
- Sweetie, it's not that.

34
00:03:57,101 --> 00:03:59,889
But I promised the guy
I'd be outta here by eight.

35
00:04:00,022 --> 00:04:05,645
- What guy? Whose apartment is this?
- Some schnook that works in the office.

36
00:04:19,122 --> 00:04:21,529
- Good evening, Mr. Baxter.
- Mrs. Lieberman.

37
00:04:21,667 --> 00:04:26,624
Some weather we're having. Must be from
all that meshugaas at Cape Canaveral.

38
00:04:27,963 --> 00:04:32,671
- You're locked out of your apartment?
- No, no. Just waiting for a friend.

39
00:04:33,218 --> 00:04:36,587
- Good night, Mrs. Lieberman.
- Good night, Mr. Baxter.

40
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:57,199
- Where do you live?
- I told you. With my mother.

41
00:04:57,324 --> 00:05:00,527
- Where does she live?
- 179th Street, in the Bronx.

42
00:05:00,661 --> 00:05:05,655
- All right. I'll take you to the subway.
- Like hell you will! You'll buy me a cab.

43
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:09,705
- Why do all you dames live in the Bronx?
- You bring other girls up here?

44
00:05:09,836 --> 00:05:12,706
Certainly not. I'm a happily married man.

45
00:05:52,042 --> 00:05:55,160
- Hello there, Mrs. Dreyfuss.
- Something's the matter?

46
00:05:55,294 --> 00:05:59,374
Uh, no. I... seem to have
dropped my key. Ah, here it is.

47
00:05:59,506 --> 00:06:01,999
Such a racket I heard in your place.

48
00:06:02,135 --> 00:06:04,256
Maybe you had burglars?

49
00:06:04,385 --> 00:06:08,847
Don't worry about that. There's nothing in
here anybody'd wanna steal. Good night.

50
00:06:40,085 --> 00:06:42,124
(Doorbell)

51
00:06:47,843 --> 00:06:52,386
Sorry to bother you, Buddy-boy,
but the little lady forgot her galoshes.

52
00:06:52,514 --> 00:06:56,013
Mr. Kirkeby, you were supposed
to be outta here by eight.

53
00:06:56,143 --> 00:07:00,722
I know, but those things don't always
run on schedule like a Greyhound bus.

54
00:07:00,856 --> 00:07:03,523
I don't mind in the summer,
but on a rainy night...

55
00:07:03,649 --> 00:07:06,319
- I haven't had any dinner yet.
- Sure, sure.

56
00:07:06,444 --> 00:07:08,483
Oh!

57
00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:12,029
I put in a good word for you
with Sheldrake in Personnel.

58
00:07:12,157 --> 00:07:13,735
- Mr. Sheldrake?
- That's right.

59
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:17,816
We discussed manpower promotion-wise.
I told him you're a bright boy.

60
00:07:17,955 --> 00:07:22,082
They're always on the lookout for
young executives. You're on your way up.

61
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:26,075
- And you're also out of liquor.
- Mr. Eichelberger, Mortgage and Loans...

62
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:30,673
- ..last night he had a Halloween party.
- Lay in some vodka and vermouth for me.

63
00:07:30,801 --> 00:07:35,094
- You still owe me for the last two bottles.
- I'll pay you on Friday.

64
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:40,463
Oh, and whatever happened to those little
cheese crackers you used to have?

65
00:07:42,686 --> 00:07:44,727
Cheese crackers?

66
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:25,137
Cheers.

67
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:44,064
- Good evening, Baxter.
- Hi, Doc. Had a late call?

68
00:08:44,201 --> 00:08:48,863
Yeah. Some clown at Schrafft's ate
a club sandwich - including the toothpick.

69
00:08:50,915 --> 00:08:53,586
- Well, good night, Doc.
- Say, Baxter.

70
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:57,542
The way you're beltin' that stuff,
you must have cast-iron kidneys.

71
00:08:57,672 --> 00:09:01,884
That's not me. Just once in a while
I have a few people in for a drink.

72
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:05,094
As a matter of fact, you must be
an iron man all around.

73
00:09:05,221 --> 00:09:08,507
From what I hear through the walls,
you're at it every night.

74
00:09:08,641 --> 00:09:13,101
- I'm sorry if it gets noisy.
- And sometimes there's a double-header.

75
00:09:13,854 --> 00:09:17,269
- (Tuts) A nebbish like you.
- Yeah. Well, I'll see you, Doc.

76
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:21,148
You know, I'm doing some research
at the Columbia Medical Center.

77
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:23,566
- Could you do us a favor?
- Me?

78
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:27,529
When you make out your will -
and the way you're going, you should -

79
00:09:27,658 --> 00:09:31,739
would you mind leaving
your body to the university?

80
00:09:31,872 --> 00:09:36,165
My body? I'm afraid you guys'd
be disappointed. Good night, Doc.

81
00:09:37,542 --> 00:09:39,582
Slow down, kid.

82
00:10:18,122 --> 00:10:20,161
Oh, for heaven...

83
00:10:27,631 --> 00:10:32,257
From the world's greatest library
of film classics, we proudly present...

84
00:10:32,385 --> 00:10:34,791
..Greta Garbo, John Barrymore,...

85
00:10:34,929 --> 00:10:39,056
..Joan Crawford, Wallace Beery
and Lionel Barrymore...

86
00:10:39,183 --> 00:10:41,935
..in "Grand Hotel".

87
00:10:42,727 --> 00:10:45,265
But first, a word from our sponsor.

88
00:10:45,397 --> 00:10:49,725
If you smoke the modern way,
don't be fooled by phony filter claims.

89
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:17,501
(Bugle: cavalry charge)

90
00:11:20,887 --> 00:11:23,676
And now, "Grand Hotel"...

91
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:26,594
..starring Greta Garbo, John Barrymore,...

92
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:30,261
..Joan Crawford, Wallace Beery
and Lionel Barrymore.

93
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:34,728
But first, a word
from our alternate sponsor.

94
00:11:34,858 --> 00:11:38,524
Friends, do you have wobbly dentures?

95
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,791
(Phone rings)

96
00:12:05,456 --> 00:12:07,248
- Hello.
- Hiya, Buddy-boy.

97
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:11,207
I'm in this bar on 61st Street
and I figured I'd give you a little buzz.

98
00:12:11,338 --> 00:12:13,875
That's very nice of you but... who is this?

99
00:12:14,007 --> 00:12:16,497
Dobisch. Joe Dobisch, in Administration.

100
00:12:16,634 --> 00:12:20,417
- Oh, yeah. I didn't recognize your voice.
- That's OK, Buddy-boy.

101
00:12:20,554 --> 00:12:25,097
Like I was saying, I'm in this joint
on 61st and I think I got lucky.

102
00:12:26,309 --> 00:12:30,307
I'm sorry, Mr. Dobisch. I like to help
you fellas out, but it's sort of late.

103
00:12:30,439 --> 00:12:34,768
- Why don't we make it some other time?
- Listen, kid. I can't pass this up.

104
00:12:34,902 --> 00:12:37,605
She looks like Marilyn Monroe.

105
00:12:37,736 --> 00:12:41,982
I'm already in bed. And I took a sleeping
pill. So I'm afraid the answer is no.

106
00:12:42,533 --> 00:12:46,662
We're doing the monthly efficiency rating.
I'm putting you in the top ten.

107
00:12:46,788 --> 00:12:49,029
You don't wanna
louse yourself up, do you?

108
00:12:49,164 --> 00:12:53,908
No. But how can I be efficient in the
office if I don't get enough sleep at night?

109
00:12:54,042 --> 00:12:58,171
It's only eleven, and I just
want the place for 45 minutes.

110
00:13:00,424 --> 00:13:03,341
I'm getting lonely.
Who are you talking to, anyway?

111
00:13:03,467 --> 00:13:07,467
- My mother.
- Oh, that's sweet. That's real sweet.

112
00:13:08,099 --> 00:13:09,723
Ooh!

113
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,935
Make it 30 minutes.
What do you say, Bud, huh?

114
00:13:14,521 --> 00:13:17,855
I'm all out of liquor,
there's no clean glasses...

115
00:13:17,983 --> 00:13:21,647
- There's no cheese crackers. No nothin'.
- Let me worry about that.

116
00:13:21,777 --> 00:13:24,613
Just leave the key under the mat
and clear out.

117
00:13:24,739 --> 00:13:26,777
Yes, Mr. Dobisch.

118
00:13:27,741 --> 00:13:30,362
Anything you say, Mr. Dobisch

119
00:13:31,202 --> 00:13:34,953
No trouble at all, Mr. Dobisch
Be my guest!

120
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:38,786
We never close at Buddy-boy's.

121
00:13:42,547 --> 00:13:44,588
"Looks like Marilyn Monroe"!

122
00:14:28,047 --> 00:14:30,965
- This the place?
- Yeah.

123
00:14:31,092 --> 00:14:33,050
- How much?
- 70 cents.

124
00:14:33,178 --> 00:14:35,217
Get the money, will you?

125
00:14:36,929 --> 00:14:38,970
Watch those stingers!

126
00:14:40,352 --> 00:14:42,389
- Give him a buck.
- Thanks, lady.

127
00:14:44,312 --> 00:14:46,351
Put it back, honey!

128
00:14:48,317 --> 00:14:50,273
Attagirl.

129
00:14:50,401 --> 00:14:53,569
- Are you sure this is a good idea?
- Can't think of a better one.

130
00:14:53,697 --> 00:14:55,984
Barging in on your mother so late at night.

131
00:14:56,113 --> 00:15:00,742
Don't worry about the old lady. One
squawk from her and she's out of a job.

132
00:15:09,044 --> 00:15:11,082
(Door closes)

133
00:15:16,844 --> 00:15:18,882
Get the key, will you?

134
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:21,842
Not there! Under the mat.

135
00:15:21,972 --> 00:15:24,677
- Under the mat?
- Yeah. Come on.

136
00:15:25,435 --> 00:15:27,888
Open up. We haven't got all night.

137
00:15:31,315 --> 00:15:34,812
- This is your mother's apartment?
- That's right.

138
00:15:38,405 --> 00:15:40,445
(Drunken giggling)

139
00:15:44,786 --> 00:15:46,825
(Latin-beat dance music)

140
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:51,071
Mildred! He's at it again!

141
00:16:41,253 --> 00:16:43,662
- Morning, Mr. Kirkeby.
- How are you, Baxter?

142
00:16:43,798 --> 00:16:47,712
- They keeping you busy these days?
- Yes, sir. They are indeed.

143
00:16:47,844 --> 00:16:51,509
Good morning, Mr. Kessel, Miss Robinson,
Mr. Williams, Miss Livingston.

144
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:54,474
Good morning, Mr. McKellway,
Mrs. Schubert, Mr. Davis.

145
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,303
Good morning, Mr. Kirkeby.
Good morning, Mr. Baxter.

146
00:16:57,436 --> 00:17:00,271
- Morning, Miss Kubelik.
- That's all. Take it away.

147
00:17:00,397 --> 00:17:02,853
Watch the door, please. Blasting off.

148
00:17:06,361 --> 00:17:09,777
- What did you do to your hair?
- It made me nervous so I chopped it off.

149
00:17:09,906 --> 00:17:13,191
- Big mistake, huh?
- No. I sort of like it. (Snuffles)

150
00:17:13,325 --> 00:17:16,030
- You got a lulu.
- Yeah. Better not get too close.

151
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:18,072
- I never catch colds.
- Really?

152
00:17:18,206 --> 00:17:21,039
I was reading some sickness
and accident claims figures.

153
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:25,792
The average New Yorker aged between
20 and 50 has two and a half colds a year.

154
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,376
- That makes me feel just terrible.
- Why?

155
00:17:28,507 --> 00:17:32,754
If I have no colds a year, some poor slob
must have five colds a year.

156
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:36,469
- Yeah. It's me.
- You shoulda stayed in bed this morning.

157
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:39,052
I shoulda stayed in bed last night.

158
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,392
19!

159
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:46,355
Watch your step.

160
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:49,055
- And watch your hands, Mr. Kirkeby!
- Pardon?

161
00:17:49,192 --> 00:17:52,690
One of these days I'm gonna
shut these doors on you and...

162
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:56,692
20 next!

163
00:17:57,365 --> 00:18:01,151
That Kubelik. Boy, would I like
to get her on a slow elevator to China!

164
00:18:01,287 --> 00:18:04,868
- She's the best operator in the building.
- I'm pretty good myself.

165
00:18:04,998 --> 00:18:08,082
- But she won't give me a date.
- Maybe it's your approach.

166
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:11,993
A lot of guys around here have tried
all kinds of approaches. No dice.

167
00:18:12,129 --> 00:18:16,293
- What's she trying to prove?
- She could just be a nice respectable girl.

168
00:18:16,425 --> 00:18:18,917
Listen to him! Little Lord Fauntleroy.

169
00:18:23,892 --> 00:18:25,930
(Bell)

170
00:18:45,236 --> 00:18:49,234
Hello. Mr. Dobisch?
This is Baxter on the 19th floor.

171
00:18:49,365 --> 00:18:51,108
Oh, Buddy-boy!

172
00:18:51,242 --> 00:18:56,199
I was just about to call you. I'm sorry
about that mess on the living room wall.

173
00:18:56,331 --> 00:19:00,492
My friend kept insisting Picasso was
a bum, so she started to do that mural.

174
00:19:00,626 --> 00:19:03,083
It's not Picasso I'm calling about.

175
00:19:03,213 --> 00:19:07,873
It's the key to my apartment.
You're supposed to leave it under the mat.

176
00:19:08,174 --> 00:19:11,175
But I did. I distinctly
remember putting it there.

177
00:19:11,386 --> 00:19:14,385
Oh, I found the key all right.
Only it's the wrong key!

178
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:20,765
It is? No wonder I couldn't get into
the executive washroom this morning.

179
00:19:20,894 --> 00:19:23,350
And I couldn't get into my apartment!

180
00:19:23,481 --> 00:19:27,429
So at 4am I gotta wake up the landlady
and give her a whole song and dance.

181
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:30,817
That's a shame.
I'll send the key right down.

182
00:19:30,946 --> 00:19:32,902
And about your promotion.

183
00:19:33,031 --> 00:19:36,233
I'll send that efficiency report
to Mr. Sheldrake in Personnel.

184
00:19:36,366 --> 00:19:38,823
You may hear from him
before the day's over.

185
00:19:38,953 --> 00:19:40,991
Thank you, Mr. Dobisch.

186
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:45,997
(Coughs)

187
00:20:07,979 --> 00:20:09,972
From Mr. Dobisch.

188
00:20:10,106 --> 00:20:12,146
Wait.

189
00:20:22,826 --> 00:20:24,866
For Mr. Dobisch.

190
00:20:31,585 --> 00:20:33,624
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

191
00:20:46,765 --> 00:20:48,225
(Phone rings)

192
00:20:48,351 --> 00:20:50,177
Vanderhof. Public Relations.

193
00:20:50,312 --> 00:20:52,350
Oh, yes, Baxter. Just a minute.

194
00:20:52,479 --> 00:20:55,765
All right, Miss Finch.
Type up what we got so far.

195
00:20:58,317 --> 00:21:00,690
Look, I've got you down for tonight,...

196
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:04,155
..but I'll be using the place myself,
so I'll have to cancel.

197
00:21:04,283 --> 00:21:07,152
But it's her birthday.
I already ordered the cake.

198
00:21:07,284 --> 00:21:12,444
But I am sick. I got a terrible cold and a
fever. I got to go to bed right after work.

199
00:21:12,581 --> 00:21:16,330
If you got a cold, you go to a Turkish bath.
Spend the night. Sweat it out.

200
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:20,623
That's how you get pneumonia. If I got
pneumonia, I'd be in bed for a month.

201
00:21:20,755 --> 00:21:25,167
OK. You made your point. We'll just
have to do it next Wednesday night.

202
00:21:25,302 --> 00:21:30,888
- It's the only night I can get away.
- Wednesday, Wednesday... Wednesday.

203
00:21:32,433 --> 00:21:34,804
I got somebody penciled in.

204
00:21:34,935 --> 00:21:37,805
Let me see what I can do.
I'll get back to you.

205
00:21:48,157 --> 00:21:52,283
- Mr. Eichelberger.
- Oh, yes, Baxter. What's your problem?

206
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:59,244
Wednesday is out? Oh, that throws
a little monkey wrench into my agenda.

207
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:02,660
Thursday? No,
I'm all tied up on Thursday.

208
00:22:04,046 --> 00:22:07,295
Let's schedule that, uh...
meeting for Friday.

209
00:22:07,423 --> 00:22:09,464
Friday.

210
00:22:10,385 --> 00:22:13,136
Let me see what I can do.
I'll get back to you.

211
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:23,720
Premium-wise and billing-wise, we are 18
per cent ahead of last year October-wise.

212
00:22:23,855 --> 00:22:25,896
(Phone rings)

213
00:22:26,442 --> 00:22:29,525
Hello? Yeah, Baxter. What's up?

214
00:22:29,652 --> 00:22:32,903
Instead of Friday, could you
possibly switch to Thursday?

215
00:22:33,031 --> 00:22:35,817
You'd be doing me a great favor.

216
00:22:36,242 --> 00:22:38,697
Let me check. I'll get back to you.

217
00:22:40,455 --> 00:22:42,992
Consolidated Life. I'll connect you.

218
00:22:43,123 --> 00:22:45,081
Sylvia, it's for you.

219
00:22:45,209 --> 00:22:47,001
Yeah?

220
00:22:47,128 --> 00:22:48,786
Oh, hello.

221
00:22:48,921 --> 00:22:52,253
Sure I got home all right.
You owe me 45 cents.

222
00:22:52,382 --> 00:22:56,083
Look, Sylvia. Instead of Friday,
could we make it Thursday night?

223
00:22:56,386 --> 00:23:01,462
Thursday?! Well, that's
The Untouchables with Bob Stack!

224
00:23:01,807 --> 00:23:03,848
Bob who?

225
00:23:04,311 --> 00:23:08,010
All right, so we'll watch it
at the apartment. Big deal!

226
00:23:12,192 --> 00:23:14,814
Hello, Baxter? It's OK for Thursday.

227
00:23:15,486 --> 00:23:17,526
Thank you, Mr. Kirkeby.

228
00:23:27,081 --> 00:23:29,654
Mr. Eichelberger, it's OK for Friday.

229
00:23:37,173 --> 00:23:40,044
Mr. Vanderhof? OK for Wednesday.

230
00:23:50,978 --> 00:23:52,887
All right. I'll tell him.

231
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:56,855
Hey, Baxter, that was Personnel.
Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.

232
00:23:56,984 --> 00:24:01,941
She's been trying to reach you for the last
20 minutes. They want you upstairs.

233
00:24:02,823 --> 00:24:07,698
- Are you getting promoted? Or fired?
- Would you care to make a small wager?

234
00:24:07,827 --> 00:24:12,039
- I've been here twice as long as you but...
- Let's say a dollar?

235
00:24:12,165 --> 00:24:13,742
It's a bet!

236
00:24:27,905 --> 00:24:30,147
- Going up?
- Oh! Excuse me.

237
00:24:30,282 --> 00:24:36,366
27, please. Drive carefully. You're carrying
precious cargo. I mean manpower-wise.

238
00:24:36,787 --> 00:24:37,986
27.

239
00:24:38,122 --> 00:24:42,073
You may not realize it, but I am
in the top ten, efficiency-wise,...

240
00:24:42,209 --> 00:24:44,996
..and this may be the day promotion-wise.

241
00:24:45,129 --> 00:24:47,798
You're beginning to sound
like Mr. Kirkeby already.

242
00:24:47,923 --> 00:24:51,968
- Why not, as they're kicking me upstairs?
- Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.

243
00:24:52,094 --> 00:24:55,795
You know, you're the only one
who takes his hat off in the elevator.

244
00:24:55,931 --> 00:24:58,218
Something happens to men in elevators.

245
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:01,350
It's the change of altitude.
The blood rushes to their head.

246
00:25:01,477 --> 00:25:04,680
- I could tell you stories...
- I'd love to hear 'em.

247
00:25:04,814 --> 00:25:07,387
We could have lunch
in the cafeteria sometime.

248
00:25:07,526 --> 00:25:09,481
Or some evening, after work?

249
00:25:09,609 --> 00:25:11,769
- 27.
- Oh.

250
00:25:11,905 --> 00:25:14,572
- I hope everything goes all right.
- I hope so.

251
00:25:14,697 --> 00:25:17,449
They would call me today,
what with my cold.

252
00:25:17,575 --> 00:25:20,031
- How do I look?
- Fine. Wait.

253
00:25:20,912 --> 00:25:22,489
Thank you.

254
00:25:22,622 --> 00:25:27,450
I noticed, when you were still on the
local elevator, you always wore a flower.

255
00:25:27,585 --> 00:25:30,077
Good luck. And wipe your nose.

256
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:49,262
CC Baxter, Ordinary Premium Accounting.
Mr. Sheldrake called me.

257
00:25:49,398 --> 00:25:52,183
I called you. That is,
I tried to for 20 minutes.

258
00:25:52,315 --> 00:25:54,356
- I'm sorry.
- Go on in.

259
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:07,657
- Baxter?
- Yes, sir.

260
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:09,828
Come in, come in.

261
00:26:10,792 --> 00:26:13,744
I was sort of wondering
what you looked like, Baxter.

262
00:26:13,876 --> 00:26:16,369
- Sit down.
- Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.

263
00:26:17,882 --> 00:26:20,634
Been hearing some nice things about you.

264
00:26:20,759 --> 00:26:23,844
Mr. Dobisch says you're loyal,
cooperative, resourceful.

265
00:26:23,971 --> 00:26:28,347
- Mr. Dobisch said that?
- Mr. Kirkeby tells me you often work late...

266
00:26:28,475 --> 00:26:31,761
- ..without overtime.
- You know how it is. Things pile up.

267
00:26:32,478 --> 00:26:36,096
Mr. Vanderhof in Public Relations and
Mr. Eichelberger in Mortgage and Loans...

268
00:26:36,232 --> 00:26:39,150
..would both like you
transferred to their departments.

269
00:26:39,277 --> 00:26:41,185
Very flattering.

270
00:26:42,279 --> 00:26:46,525
Tell me, Baxter. Just what is it
that makes you so popular?

271
00:26:46,658 --> 00:26:50,075
- I don't know.
- Think.

272
00:26:55,333 --> 00:26:59,377
- Would you mind repeating the question?
- Look, Baxter. I'm not stupid.

273
00:26:59,504 --> 00:27:04,082
I know everything that goes on
in this building every day of the year.

274
00:27:04,217 --> 00:27:05,675
You do?

275
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:10,344
In 1957 we had an employee here,
name of Fowler. He was very popular too.

276
00:27:10,472 --> 00:27:13,177
It turned out
he was running a bookie joint,...

277
00:27:13,307 --> 00:27:16,843
..tying up our switchboard, using
our IBM machines to figure the odds.

278
00:27:16,979 --> 00:27:21,271
The day before the Kentucky Derby I
called in the vice squad, who raided him.

279
00:27:21,398 --> 00:27:23,437
- The vice squad?
- That's right.

280
00:27:23,566 --> 00:27:26,853
What's that got to do with me?
I'm not running any bookie joint.

281
00:27:26,989 --> 00:27:30,486
- Just what kind of joint are you running?
- Sir?

282
00:27:30,616 --> 00:27:35,693
A key is floating around from Kirkeby
to Vanderhof to Eichelberger to Dobisch.

283
00:27:35,828 --> 00:27:37,821
It's the key to a certain apartment.

284
00:27:37,955 --> 00:27:41,373
- Know who that apartment belongs to?
- Who?

285
00:27:41,834 --> 00:27:44,870
Loyal, resourceful, cooperative CC Baxter.

286
00:27:47,423 --> 00:27:49,879
- Oh.
- Are you going to deny it?

287
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:54,842
No. I'm not going to deny it.
If you'd just let me explain.

288
00:27:55,514 --> 00:27:57,341
You'd better.

289
00:27:57,475 --> 00:27:59,514
Well,...

290
00:28:00,186 --> 00:28:04,978
..about a year ago, I was going to night
school, studying advanced accounting.

291
00:28:05,106 --> 00:28:10,100
One of the guys in our department lives
in Jersey had to go to a banquet in town.

292
00:28:10,236 --> 00:28:14,648
He needed someplace to change
into a tuxedo, so I gave him the key.

293
00:28:14,781 --> 00:28:20,737
Word must've gotten out because all sorts
of guys were suddenly going to banquets.

294
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:25,746
You give the key to one guy, you can't
say no to another. It all got out of hand.

295
00:28:28,752 --> 00:28:32,169
Baxter, an insurance company
is founded on public trust.

296
00:28:32,298 --> 00:28:35,584
Any employee who conducts himself
in a manner unbecoming...

297
00:28:35,718 --> 00:28:38,753
How many charter members
are there in this little club?

298
00:28:38,887 --> 00:28:42,671
Just those four. Out of a total of 31,259.

299
00:28:42,808 --> 00:28:46,888
So actually we can be very proud
of our personnel... percentage-wise.

300
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:51,681
That's not the point. Four rotten apples
in a barrel, however large the barrel...

301
00:28:51,815 --> 00:28:55,019
- Do you realize if this ever leaked out...
- It won't!

302
00:28:55,152 --> 00:29:00,146
Believe me. Never again. Nobody
is gonna use my apartment from now on.

303
00:29:00,282 --> 00:29:02,952
- Where is your apartment?
- West 67th Street.

304
00:29:03,077 --> 00:29:08,580
You have no idea what I go through with
the neighbors, the landlady and the key.

305
00:29:08,706 --> 00:29:10,745
How do you work it with the key?

306
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:15,750
I slip it to 'em in the office and they leave
it under a mat. Never again. I promise.

307
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,920
(Intercom buzzer)

308
00:29:19,467 --> 00:29:23,381
- Yes, Miss Olsen?
- Mrs. Sheldrake, returning your call. On 2.

309
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:30,013
(Sheldrake) Yes, dear. Where were you?

310
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:35,602
You had to take Tommy to the dentist?
No cavities? Good. Hold it, dear.

311
00:29:35,733 --> 00:29:38,767
- Where are you going, Baxter?
- I don't wanna intrude.

312
00:29:38,901 --> 00:29:42,236
- Since this is straightened out...
- I'm not through with you yet.

313
00:29:42,365 --> 00:29:44,569
I won't be home for dinner tonight.

314
00:29:44,698 --> 00:29:48,695
The branch manager from Kansas City
is in town. I'm taking him to the theatre.

315
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:50,655
Music Man. What else?

316
00:29:50,788 --> 00:29:53,324
No, don't wait up for me,
darling. Goodbye.

317
00:29:54,541 --> 00:29:57,957
Tell me, Baxter.
Have you seen Music Man?

318
00:29:58,086 --> 00:30:00,707
Not yet. I hear it's one swell show.

319
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:03,080
How would you like to go tonight?

320
00:30:03,216 --> 00:30:07,509
You and me? I thought you were taking
the branch manager from Kansas City.

321
00:30:07,636 --> 00:30:10,921
No, I have other plans.
You can have both tickets.

322
00:30:11,056 --> 00:30:13,096
Well... that's very kind of you.

323
00:30:13,226 --> 00:30:17,269
But I'm not feeling well. I've got
this cold. I'm gonna go right home.

324
00:30:17,395 --> 00:30:20,977
Baxter, you're not reading me.
I told you I have plans.

325
00:30:21,398 --> 00:30:24,603
So do I. I'm gonna take
four aspirins, get into bed.

326
00:30:24,736 --> 00:30:26,977
So give the tickets to somebody else.

327
00:30:27,406 --> 00:30:32,066
Look, Baxter. I'm not just giving
these tickets. I wanna swap them.

328
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,359
Swap 'em? For what?

329
00:30:36,662 --> 00:30:41,491
It also says here that you are
alert, astute and quite imaginative.

330
00:30:42,753 --> 00:30:44,661
Oh?

331
00:30:49,717 --> 00:30:51,756
Oh...

332
00:31:01,186 --> 00:31:05,314
That's good thinking, Baxter. There's
gonna be a shift in personnel next month.

333
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,307
And as far as I'm concerned,
you are executive material.

334
00:31:09,444 --> 00:31:11,899
- I am?
- Now put down the key.

335
00:31:15,073 --> 00:31:17,113
And put down the address.

336
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:24,281
It's on the second floor. There's no name
over the door. It just says apartment 2A.

337
00:31:25,167 --> 00:31:27,243
- It's that cold.
- Relax, Baxter.

338
00:31:27,378 --> 00:31:29,417
Yes, thank you, sir.

339
00:31:31,464 --> 00:31:34,549
You will be careful with
the record player? Shh.

340
00:31:34,677 --> 00:31:36,713
Oh, and about the liquor.

341
00:31:36,844 --> 00:31:41,423
I ordered some this morning.
I don't know when they'll deliver it.

342
00:31:42,475 --> 00:31:45,510
- This is going to be our little secret.
- Of course.

343
00:31:45,645 --> 00:31:48,313
- You know how people talk.
- Don't worry about that.

344
00:31:48,438 --> 00:31:52,186
- Not that I have anything to hide.
- No! Anyway, it's none of my business.

345
00:31:52,317 --> 00:31:56,185
Four apples, five apples.
What's the difference?

346
00:31:56,322 --> 00:31:58,360
Percentage-wise.

347
00:31:58,489 --> 00:32:01,063
Here you are, Baxter. Have a nice time.

348
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,239
You too, sir.

349
00:32:35,274 --> 00:32:39,224
So I figure, a man in his position,
he'll take me to EI Morocco, maybe 21.

350
00:32:39,362 --> 00:32:43,903
Instead he takes me to Hamburger
Heaven and some schnook's apartment.

351
00:32:48,871 --> 00:32:50,908
- Good night.
- Good night.

352
00:32:52,914 --> 00:32:55,288
Oh! Miss Kubelik?

353
00:32:55,418 --> 00:32:58,584
I've been waiting for you.
I almost didn't recognize you.

354
00:32:58,712 --> 00:33:01,878
This is the first time
I've seen you in civilian clothes.

355
00:33:02,006 --> 00:33:04,295
- How'd it go on the 27th floor?
- Great.

356
00:33:04,425 --> 00:33:06,831
- Look, have you seen The Music Man?
- No.

357
00:33:06,969 --> 00:33:08,593
- Would you like to?
- Sure.

358
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,046
We could get a bite to eat first,
and then go.

359
00:33:11,181 --> 00:33:12,760
- Oh, you mean tonight?
- Yeah.

360
00:33:12,891 --> 00:33:15,976
- I'm sorry, I can't. I'm meeting somebody.
- Oh.

361
00:33:16,103 --> 00:33:19,685
- You mean... Like a girlfriend?
- No. Like a man.

362
00:33:19,815 --> 00:33:24,393
I wasn't trying to be personal. The fellas
in the office were wondering if you ever...

363
00:33:24,527 --> 00:33:26,486
You tell 'em now and then.

364
00:33:26,614 --> 00:33:30,942
This date, is it... just a date?
Or is it something serious?

365
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:34,526
Well, it used to be serious.
At least, I was. But he wasn't.

366
00:33:34,661 --> 00:33:37,034
So now the whole thing is
more or less kaput.

367
00:33:37,164 --> 00:33:39,785
- In that case, couldn't you...
- I'm afraid not.

368
00:33:39,916 --> 00:33:44,043
I promised I'd have a drink with him.
He's been calling me all week.

369
00:33:44,713 --> 00:33:46,955
I understand.

370
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:51,632
Well, it was just an idea. I hate
to see a theatre ticket go to waste.

371
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,844
- What time does the show go on?
- 8.30.

372
00:33:54,971 --> 00:33:57,345
Well, I could meet you at the theatre.

373
00:33:57,476 --> 00:34:01,553
That's wonderful!
It's the Majestic on 44th Street.

374
00:34:01,687 --> 00:34:03,560
I'll meet you in the lobby.

375
00:34:03,689 --> 00:34:07,188
You know, I felt so lousy
this morning. Had 101 fever.

376
00:34:07,317 --> 00:34:10,815
Now along comes my promotion
and us - 11th row centre.

377
00:34:10,945 --> 00:34:12,903
And you said I should've stayed in bed.

378
00:34:13,031 --> 00:34:15,188
- How is your cold?
- What cold?

379
00:34:15,324 --> 00:34:19,369
After the show we could go out
on the town. (Hums dance tune)

380
00:34:19,495 --> 00:34:22,282
- I've been taking from Arthur Murray.
- So I see.

381
00:34:22,414 --> 00:34:25,416
There's a great band
at EI Chico, in the Village.

382
00:34:25,543 --> 00:34:29,076
- Around the corner from where you live.
- Sounds good.

383
00:34:29,211 --> 00:34:33,839
- How do you know where I live?
- Oh, I... even know who you live with.

384
00:34:33,967 --> 00:34:36,007
Your sister and brother-in-law.

385
00:34:36,136 --> 00:34:40,084
I know when you were born and where.
I know all sorts of things about you.

386
00:34:40,223 --> 00:34:41,634
How come?

387
00:34:41,766 --> 00:34:46,473
A couple of months ago I looked up
your card in the group insurance file.

388
00:34:46,602 --> 00:34:50,518
I know your height and your weight
and your social security number.

389
00:34:50,649 --> 00:34:54,563
You had mumps and measles
and you had your appendix out.

390
00:34:55,528 --> 00:34:58,695
Don't mention the appendix
to the fellas in the office.

391
00:34:58,824 --> 00:35:03,568
I wouldn't want 'em to get the wrong idea
about how you found out. Bye.

392
00:35:06,913 --> 00:35:08,953
8.30!

393
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:36,648
(Light music)

394
00:35:44,281 --> 00:35:47,365
(Plays "Jealous Lover")

395
00:35:57,879 --> 00:36:01,958
- Good evening, Mr. Sheldrake.
- Please, Fran. Not so loud.

396
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:04,545
Still afraid someone
might see us together?

397
00:36:04,676 --> 00:36:08,295
- Let me take your coat.
- No, Jeff. I can't stay very long.

398
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:12,843
- Can I have a frozen daiquiri?
- It's on the way.

399
00:36:13,935 --> 00:36:17,385
- I see you went ahead and cut your hair.
- That's right.

400
00:36:17,521 --> 00:36:20,854
- You know I liked it better long.
- I know.

401
00:36:20,982 --> 00:36:23,853
You want a lock to carry in your wallet?

402
00:36:24,611 --> 00:36:28,146
- Evening, lady. Nice to see you again.
- Thank you.

403
00:36:29,281 --> 00:36:31,570
How long has it been, Fran? A month?

404
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:34,370
Six weeks. But who's counting?

405
00:36:35,454 --> 00:36:37,494
I missed you.

406
00:36:40,042 --> 00:36:42,081
Like old times.

407
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:44,915
Same booth. Same song.

408
00:36:45,798 --> 00:36:49,925
- It's been hell.
- Same sauce. Sweet-and-sour.

409
00:36:52,469 --> 00:36:55,674
You don't know what it's like,
next to you in that elevator.

410
00:36:55,807 --> 00:36:59,009
"Good morning, Miss Kubelik."
"Good night, Mr. Sheldrake."

411
00:36:59,142 --> 00:37:01,680
I'm still crazy about you, Fran.

412
00:37:01,813 --> 00:37:07,317
Let's not start on that again, Jeff. Please?
I'm just beginning to get over it.

413
00:37:08,651 --> 00:37:11,107
I don't believe you.

414
00:37:12,322 --> 00:37:15,321
Look, Jeff. We had two
wonderful months this summer.

415
00:37:15,448 --> 00:37:18,321
But that was it. Happens all the time.

416
00:37:18,452 --> 00:37:22,580
Wife and kids go away to the country and
the boss has a fling with his secretary,...

417
00:37:22,706 --> 00:37:25,458
..or the manicurist, or the elevator girl.

418
00:37:25,584 --> 00:37:29,000
Come September,
the picnic's over. Goodbye.

419
00:37:29,128 --> 00:37:33,174
The kids go back to school,
the boss goes back to the wife,...

420
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,339
..and the girl...

421
00:37:36,677 --> 00:37:39,679
They don't make these shrimp
like they used to.

422
00:37:42,851 --> 00:37:45,518
I never said goodbye, Fran.

423
00:37:47,063 --> 00:37:52,436
For a while there, you try kidding yourself
that you're going with an unmarried man.

424
00:37:52,567 --> 00:37:55,355
Then one day he keeps
looking at his watch...

425
00:37:55,488 --> 00:37:58,108
..and asks you if any lipstick's showing,...

426
00:37:58,239 --> 00:38:01,737
..then rushes out to catch
the 7.14 to White Plains.

427
00:38:02,952 --> 00:38:06,534
So you fix yourself
a cup of instant coffee...

428
00:38:06,662 --> 00:38:10,413
..and you sit there
by yourself and you think,...

429
00:38:11,418 --> 00:38:14,703
..and it all begins to look so... ugly.

430
00:38:18,216 --> 00:38:22,047
How do you think I felt
riding home on that 7.14 train?

431
00:38:22,178 --> 00:38:26,390
Why do you keep calling me, Jeff?
What do you want from me?

432
00:38:26,516 --> 00:38:28,555
I want you back, Fran.

433
00:38:28,684 --> 00:38:32,598
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake. I'm full up.
You'll have to take the next elevator.

434
00:38:32,729 --> 00:38:36,643
You're not giving me a chance, Fran.
I have something to tell you.

435
00:38:36,774 --> 00:38:40,642
- Go ahead. Tell me.
- Not here. Can't we go someplace else?

436
00:38:40,779 --> 00:38:43,614
- No. I have a date at 8.30.
- Oh?

437
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:47,822
- Important?
- Not very, but I'm gonna be there anyway.

438
00:38:47,953 --> 00:38:50,621
- You ready order dinner now?
- No. No dinner.

439
00:38:50,746 --> 00:38:53,237
Just bring us two more drinks, will you?

440
00:39:10,349 --> 00:39:11,842
(Coughs)

441
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:16,055
Fran, do you remember
that last weekend we had?

442
00:39:16,188 --> 00:39:21,063
Do I! That leaky boat you rented, and me
in a black negligee and a life preserver.

443
00:39:21,191 --> 00:39:23,563
Do you remember what we talked about?

444
00:39:23,693 --> 00:39:27,311
- We talked about a lot of things.
- I mean about my getting a divorce.

445
00:39:27,446 --> 00:39:29,820
We didn't talk about it, Jeff. You did.

446
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,990
You didn't believe me, did you?

447
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:36,578
They got it on a long-playing record now.
"Music to String Her Along By."

448
00:39:36,705 --> 00:39:41,533
"My wife doesn't understand me. You're
the best thing that ever happened to me."

449
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:45,001
- That's enough, Fran.
- "Trust me, baby. We'll work it out."

450
00:39:45,129 --> 00:39:47,834
- You're not being funny.
- I wasn't trying.

451
00:39:48,384 --> 00:39:52,381
- Fran, just listen to me for a minute.
- All right. I'm sorry.

452
00:39:52,513 --> 00:39:57,589
I saw my lawyer this morning. I wanted
his advice about the best way to handle it.

453
00:39:57,727 --> 00:40:00,180
- Handle what?
- What do you think?

454
00:40:01,645 --> 00:40:06,141
Let's get something straight, Jeff.
I never asked you to leave your wife.

455
00:40:06,275 --> 00:40:09,026
Of course not. You had
nothing to do with it.

456
00:40:11,029 --> 00:40:13,152
Are you sure that's what you want?

457
00:40:14,198 --> 00:40:17,816
I'm sure... if you'll just tell me
that you still love me.

458
00:40:21,038 --> 00:40:23,077
You know I do.

459
00:40:26,251 --> 00:40:27,876
Fran.

460
00:40:29,546 --> 00:40:31,420
(Woman laughs)

461
00:40:31,547 --> 00:40:33,587
Jeff, darling...

462
00:40:40,015 --> 00:40:43,099
It is getting crowded. Let's get out of here.

463
00:40:51,358 --> 00:40:54,441
(Pianist plays "Jealous Lover")

464
00:41:15,505 --> 00:41:17,048
Taxi!

465
00:41:17,175 --> 00:41:20,756
- Jeff, I have that date, remember?
- But I love you, remember?

466
00:41:20,885 --> 00:41:23,507
- (Whistles)
- Where are we going?

467
00:41:23,638 --> 00:41:26,425
- Not back to that leaky boat?
- I promise.

468
00:41:30,978 --> 00:41:33,434
51 West 67th.

469
00:42:17,353 --> 00:42:19,392
Congratulations.

470
00:42:34,785 --> 00:42:37,786
Would you mind? CC Baxter - that's me.

471
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:43,330
Thank you.

472
00:42:57,348 --> 00:42:58,463
(Door opens)

473
00:42:58,599 --> 00:43:02,099
(Kirkeby) Hi, Buddy-boy.
Congratulations and all that jazz.

474
00:43:02,228 --> 00:43:05,727
- Hi, fellas.
- Well, you made it, just like we promised.

475
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:09,058
Quite an office.
Name on the door, rug on the floor.

476
00:43:09,192 --> 00:43:13,902
Teamwork: that's what counts in this
organization. All for one and one for all.

477
00:43:14,031 --> 00:43:16,069
- Know what I mean?
- I have a vague idea.

478
00:43:16,199 --> 00:43:19,366
Baxter, we're a little disappointed
in you, gratitude-wise.

479
00:43:19,494 --> 00:43:22,944
- Oh, I'm very grateful.
- Then why are you locking us out?

480
00:43:23,081 --> 00:43:28,704
Well, it's been sort of rough the past few
weeks, what with my cold and... Like that.

481
00:43:28,837 --> 00:43:31,671
We went to bat for you.
Now you won't play ball with us.

482
00:43:31,797 --> 00:43:36,126
After all, it's my apartment. It's
private property, not a public playground.

483
00:43:36,259 --> 00:43:40,505
So you got yourself a girl. That's OK
with us. But not every night in the week!

484
00:43:40,638 --> 00:43:42,382
How selfish can you get?

485
00:43:42,516 --> 00:43:46,298
Last week I had to use my nephew's car
and take Sylvia to a drive-in in Jersey.

486
00:43:46,435 --> 00:43:49,472
I'm too old for that sort of thing -
I mean in a Volkswagen.

487
00:43:49,605 --> 00:43:52,854
I sympathize with you.
Believe me, I'm very sorry.

488
00:43:52,982 --> 00:43:56,317
- You'll be a lot sorrier.
- Are you threatening me?

489
00:43:56,445 --> 00:43:59,530
Listen, Baxter. We made you
and we can break you.

490
00:44:00,782 --> 00:44:03,699
- Good morning, Mr. Sheldrake.
- Good morning, gentlemen.

491
00:44:03,827 --> 00:44:07,953
- Baxter, do you like your office?
- Yes, sir. I wanna thank you very much.

492
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:10,998
Don't thank me.
Your friends here recommended you.

493
00:44:11,124 --> 00:44:14,909
- We just dropped by to wish him luck.
- We know you won't let us down.

494
00:44:15,045 --> 00:44:19,790
So long, fellas. Drop in any time.
The door is always open... to my office.

495
00:44:20,675 --> 00:44:22,751
I like the way you handled that, Baxter.

496
00:44:22,886 --> 00:44:25,458
- How does it feel to be an executive?
- Oh, fine.

497
00:44:25,596 --> 00:44:29,428
- I'll work hard to justify your confidence.
- I'm sure you will.

498
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:34,351
About the apartment. Now that you've got
a raise, can't we afford a second key?

499
00:44:34,479 --> 00:44:36,887
- I guess so.
- You know my secretary, Miss Olsen?

500
00:44:37,025 --> 00:44:39,810
- Oh, yeah. Is she the lucky girl that...?
- Oh, no, no.

501
00:44:39,942 --> 00:44:45,233
I just meant that she's kind of a busybody,
and passing that key back and forth...

502
00:44:45,364 --> 00:44:47,987
- Why take chances?
- You can't be too careful.

503
00:44:48,118 --> 00:44:51,154
Oh, I... have something
I think belongs to you.

504
00:44:51,287 --> 00:44:53,824
- Me?
- I mean the young lady, whoever she is.

505
00:44:53,956 --> 00:44:56,708
- I found it when I got back last night.
- Oh. Thanks.

506
00:44:56,835 --> 00:45:00,333
The mirror is broken.
It was broken when I found it.

507
00:45:02,047 --> 00:45:04,883
- Yeah. She threw it at me.
- Sir?

508
00:45:05,009 --> 00:45:07,498
You know how it is.
They always give you a bad time.

509
00:45:07,635 --> 00:45:08,714
Yeah, I know how it is.

510
00:45:08,845 --> 00:45:13,590
You see a girl every week for laughs and
they think you're gonna divorce your wife.

511
00:45:13,725 --> 00:45:16,926
- Now I ask you, is that fair?
- No, sir. It's very unfair.

512
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:19,053
- Especially to your wife.
- Yeah.

513
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:24,057
You know, Baxter, I envy you. A bachelor,
all the dames you want, no complications.

514
00:45:24,193 --> 00:45:25,770
That's the life all right.

515
00:45:25,902 --> 00:45:28,191
- Put me down for Thursday again.
- Roger.

516
00:45:28,321 --> 00:45:30,562
And I'll get that other key.

517
00:45:42,794 --> 00:45:46,661
- Merry Christmas. I'll connect you.
- Merry Christmas. Consolidated Life.

518
00:45:46,797 --> 00:45:48,789
Merry Christmas. I'm ringing.

519
00:45:48,924 --> 00:45:50,964
Yeah? Yeah?!

520
00:45:51,093 --> 00:45:52,207
Where?

521
00:45:52,343 --> 00:45:53,590
You bet!

522
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:58,050
Somebody watch my line. There's
a swingin' party on the 19th floor!

523
00:46:00,392 --> 00:46:03,394
# Oh, what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh

524
00:46:03,521 --> 00:46:07,269
# Hey! Jingle bells,
jingle bells, jingle all the way

525
00:46:07,399 --> 00:46:10,684
# Oh, what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh

526
00:46:10,819 --> 00:46:12,858
(Singing continues)

527
00:46:26,834 --> 00:46:32,254
So I said to him "Never again. Either you
get yourself a bigger car or a smaller girl."

528
00:46:33,131 --> 00:46:35,172
Miss Kubelik? Miss...

529
00:46:35,427 --> 00:46:37,631
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you.

530
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:40,845
- I thought you were avoiding me.
- What gave you that idea?

531
00:46:40,972 --> 00:46:44,756
In six weeks you've only been in my
elevator once, and you kept on your hat.

532
00:46:44,892 --> 00:46:48,344
As a matter of fact, I was rather hurt
that night you stood me up.

533
00:46:48,479 --> 00:46:50,519
I don't blame you. It was unforgivable.

534
00:46:50,648 --> 00:46:52,272
- I forgive you.
- You shouldn't.

535
00:46:52,399 --> 00:46:55,899
You couldn't help it. You can't
suddenly walk out on one man...

536
00:46:56,028 --> 00:46:58,270
..because you have a date
with another man.

537
00:46:58,406 --> 00:47:00,777
- You did the decent thing.
- Don't be too sure.

538
00:47:00,907 --> 00:47:04,406
Just because I wear a uniform,
that doesn't make me a Girl Scout.

539
00:47:04,535 --> 00:47:09,280
A second administrative assistant has
to be a pretty good judge of character.

540
00:47:09,414 --> 00:47:11,907
And as far as I'm concerned, you're tops.

541
00:47:12,043 --> 00:47:16,751
I mean decency-wise and... otherwise-wise.

542
00:47:16,881 --> 00:47:18,920
Cheers.

543
00:47:20,676 --> 00:47:23,000
- One more.
- I shouldn't drink while driving.

544
00:47:23,136 --> 00:47:28,261
You're so right. By the power vested
in me, I declare this elevator out of order.

545
00:47:28,391 --> 00:47:30,763
Shall we join the natives?

546
00:47:30,893 --> 00:47:34,429
- Why not? They seem friendly enough.
- Don't you believe it?

547
00:47:34,564 --> 00:47:38,691
There'll be human sacrifices. White-collar
workers tossed into computers...

548
00:47:38,817 --> 00:47:41,059
..and punched full of little square holes.

549
00:47:41,194 --> 00:47:43,401
- How many drinks did you have?
- Three!

550
00:47:43,531 --> 00:47:46,733
- I thought so.
- Wait. I hear the sound of running water.

551
00:47:46,866 --> 00:47:49,441
- I'll be right back!
- I'll be right here.

552
00:47:50,912 --> 00:47:52,570
(Slurring) Hi!

553
00:47:52,705 --> 00:47:55,326
How's the branch manager
from Kansas City?

554
00:47:55,458 --> 00:47:57,166
- I beg your pardon?
- I'm Miss Olsen.

555
00:47:57,293 --> 00:47:59,251
Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.

556
00:47:59,379 --> 00:48:01,751
So you don't have to
play innocent with me.

557
00:48:01,881 --> 00:48:05,925
He used to tell his wife
I was the branch manager from Seattle...

558
00:48:06,052 --> 00:48:10,298
..four years ago when we were having
a little ring-a-ding-ding.

559
00:48:11,264 --> 00:48:15,391
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Before me it was Miss Rossi in Auditing.

560
00:48:15,517 --> 00:48:18,188
And after me it was
Miss Koch in Disability.

561
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:20,685
And right before you was a Miss, um...

562
00:48:20,815 --> 00:48:23,187
Oh, what's her name? On the 25th floor.

563
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:26,899
- Would you excuse me?
- What for? You haven't done anything.

564
00:48:27,113 --> 00:48:30,231
It's him. Oh, what a salesman!

565
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:33,196
Always the last booth
in the Chinese restaurant...

566
00:48:33,326 --> 00:48:36,411
..and the same pitch
about divorcing his wife.

567
00:48:38,539 --> 00:48:42,999
Then, in the end, you wind up
with egg foo yung on your face.

568
00:48:43,127 --> 00:48:45,166
Miss Kubelik!

569
00:48:47,255 --> 00:48:49,048
Well, thank you, Miss Olsen.

570
00:48:49,175 --> 00:48:53,302
Always happy to do a little something
for our girls in uniform.

571
00:48:54,513 --> 00:48:56,670
Are you all right? What's the matter?

572
00:48:56,806 --> 00:48:59,380
Nothing. There are just
too many people here.

573
00:48:59,518 --> 00:49:03,467
Why don't we step into my office? There's
something I want your opinion about.

574
00:49:03,604 --> 00:49:08,396
I have my own office now. I'm the second
youngest executive in this company.

575
00:49:08,525 --> 00:49:12,226
The only one younger is a grandson
of the chairman of the board.

576
00:49:13,488 --> 00:49:15,527
(Whistles) Do you mind?

577
00:49:19,744 --> 00:49:23,244
Miss Kubelik, I would like
your honest opinion.

578
00:49:23,372 --> 00:49:26,658
I've had this under my desk
for a week. It cost me $15.

579
00:49:26,793 --> 00:49:30,077
I haven't been able
to get up enough nerve to wear it.

580
00:49:35,759 --> 00:49:40,717
It's what they call the Junior Executive
model. What do you think?

581
00:49:44,142 --> 00:49:47,095
I guess I made a boo-boo, huh?

582
00:49:47,227 --> 00:49:49,470
- I like it.
- Really?

583
00:49:49,606 --> 00:49:52,522
You wouldn't be ashamed to be seen
with somebody in this hat?

584
00:49:52,649 --> 00:49:56,647
- Of course not.
- Maybe if I wore it a little to one side.

585
00:49:56,778 --> 00:49:59,531
- Is that better?
- Much better.

586
00:49:59,658 --> 00:50:02,360
Since you wouldn't be
ashamed to be seen with me,...

587
00:50:02,492 --> 00:50:05,611
..how about goin' out tonight -
you, me and the bowler?

588
00:50:05,746 --> 00:50:08,580
We'll stroll down 5th Avenue,
sort of break it in.

589
00:50:08,706 --> 00:50:12,538
- This is a bad day for me.
- I understand. Christmas and family.

590
00:50:12,669 --> 00:50:15,075
I'd better get back to my elevator
or I'll be fired.

591
00:50:15,211 --> 00:50:19,045
Don't worry about that. I've got
quite a bit of influence with Personnel.

592
00:50:19,175 --> 00:50:21,215
You know Mr. Sheldrake?

593
00:50:22,718 --> 00:50:25,091
- Why?
- He and I are like that.

594
00:50:25,221 --> 00:50:27,891
Sent me a Christmas card. See?

595
00:50:33,604 --> 00:50:36,357
Makes a cute picture.

596
00:50:37,317 --> 00:50:40,021
I could talk to Mr. Sheldrake.
Get you a promotion.

597
00:50:40,152 --> 00:50:45,857
- Would you like to be an elevator starter?
- Too many girls have seniority over me.

598
00:50:46,282 --> 00:50:49,366
No problem. Why don't we
discuss it over the holidays?

599
00:50:49,493 --> 00:50:53,907
I could call you, pick you up, have
a big unveiling. Am I wearing this right?

600
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:56,198
I think so. Here.

601
00:50:56,334 --> 00:50:59,371
It's not tilted too much?
This is a conservative firm.

602
00:50:59,504 --> 00:51:02,587
I don't want people
to think I'm an entertainer.

603
00:51:07,052 --> 00:51:09,092
What's the matter?

604
00:51:11,848 --> 00:51:14,340
- The mirror. It's broken.
- Yes, I know.

605
00:51:15,434 --> 00:51:18,471
I like it that way.
Makes me look the way I feel.

606
00:51:18,605 --> 00:51:20,265
(Phone rings)

607
00:51:22,774 --> 00:51:24,814
Your phone.

608
00:51:30,490 --> 00:51:32,530
Yes?

609
00:51:33,118 --> 00:51:34,944
Uh, just a minute.

610
00:51:35,079 --> 00:51:39,620
- If you don't mind, this is sort of personal.
- Have a nice Christmas.

611
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:48,418
Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.

612
00:51:49,507 --> 00:51:54,846
No, I didn't forget. The tree is up and the
Tom and Jerry mix is in the refrigerator.

613
00:51:54,970 --> 00:51:57,011
Yes, sir. Same to you.

614
00:52:04,939 --> 00:52:06,978
(Cheering)

615
00:52:24,291 --> 00:52:26,781
Hey! Where are you goin', Buddy-boy?

616
00:52:26,917 --> 00:52:29,160
The party's just starting.

617
00:52:29,295 --> 00:52:32,710
Listen, kid. Gimme a break.
How about tomorrow afternoon?

618
00:52:32,841 --> 00:52:38,344
I can't take her to that drive-in again.
The car has no heater. Four o'clock. OK?

619
00:52:50,857 --> 00:52:52,895
(Slow band music)

620
00:53:16,689 --> 00:53:22,276
Hey, Charlie! Gimme a shot of bourbon,
and step on it! My sleigh is double-parked!

621
00:54:15,869 --> 00:54:17,909
(Music ends)

622
00:54:29,590 --> 00:54:32,793
You buy me a drink,
I'll buy you some music.

623
00:54:32,927 --> 00:54:34,966
Rum Collins.

624
00:54:45,105 --> 00:54:46,433
Uh...

625
00:54:46,564 --> 00:54:50,182
Rum Collins and...
another one of these little mothers.

626
00:54:53,779 --> 00:54:56,449
("O Come, All Ye Faithful")

627
00:55:02,328 --> 00:55:04,285
You like Castro?

628
00:55:04,413 --> 00:55:07,250
I mean, how do you feel about Castro?

629
00:55:07,376 --> 00:55:11,205
- What is Castro?
- You know. That big shot down in Cuba.

630
00:55:11,336 --> 00:55:13,496
- With the crazy beard.
- What about him?

631
00:55:13,632 --> 00:55:16,917
Cos as far as I'm concerned,
he's a no-good fink.

632
00:55:17,050 --> 00:55:20,419
Two weeks ago I wrote him a letter.
Never even answered me.

633
00:55:20,553 --> 00:55:21,549
That so?

634
00:55:21,679 --> 00:55:25,511
All I wanted him to do was
let Mickey out for Christmas.

635
00:55:25,641 --> 00:55:27,682
- Who's Mickey?
- My husband.

636
00:55:27,811 --> 00:55:30,383
He's in Havana, in jail.

637
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:34,056
- Mixed up in that revolution?
- Mickey would do nothin' like that.

638
00:55:34,191 --> 00:55:37,975
He's a jockey.
They caught him dopin' a horse.

639
00:55:38,112 --> 00:55:40,354
Well, you can't win 'em all.

640
00:55:45,535 --> 00:55:49,200
'Twas the night before Christmas,
and all through the house

641
00:55:49,330 --> 00:55:51,371
Not a creature was stirrin'...

642
00:55:52,167 --> 00:55:55,250
Nothin'. No action.

643
00:55:55,795 --> 00:55:57,703
Dullsville.

644
00:55:57,838 --> 00:55:59,962
- You married?
- No.

645
00:56:00,091 --> 00:56:02,130
- Family?
- No.

646
00:56:02,968 --> 00:56:07,511
A night like this, it sort of spooks you
to walk into an empty apartment.

647
00:56:09,098 --> 00:56:13,226
I said I had no family. I didn't say
I had an empty apartment.

648
00:56:16,272 --> 00:56:17,981
(Fran crying)

649
00:56:18,108 --> 00:56:20,563
Come on, Fran. Don't be that way.

650
00:56:21,277 --> 00:56:24,279
Are you just gonna
sit there and keep bawling?

651
00:56:24,406 --> 00:56:27,691
You won't talk to me?
You won't tell me what's wrong?

652
00:56:29,450 --> 00:56:34,527
I know you think I'm stalling you but...
when you've been married for 12 years,...

653
00:56:34,663 --> 00:56:39,243
..you just don't sit down to breakfast and
say "Pass the sugar. I want a divorce."

654
00:56:39,378 --> 00:56:41,950
It's not that easy.

655
00:56:43,214 --> 00:56:48,042
Anyway, this is the wrong time. The kids
are off school, my in-laws are visiting.

656
00:56:48,177 --> 00:56:50,217
I can't bring it up now.

657
00:56:50,346 --> 00:56:51,887
(Fran sobs)

658
00:56:52,013 --> 00:56:57,090
This isn't like you, Fran. You were always
such a good sport. Such fun to be with.

659
00:56:59,437 --> 00:57:03,813
That's me. The happy idiot.
A million laughs.

660
00:57:04,775 --> 00:57:09,022
Well, that's a little more like it.
At least you're speaking to me.

661
00:57:09,988 --> 00:57:13,439
A funny thing happened to me
at the office party today.

662
00:57:13,576 --> 00:57:16,032
I ran into your secretary, Miss Olsen.

663
00:57:17,038 --> 00:57:19,076
You know. Ring-a-ding-ding?

664
00:57:20,166 --> 00:57:23,034
And I laughed so much, I like to died.

665
00:57:23,166 --> 00:57:27,794
Is that what's been bothering you, Fran?
Miss Olsen? That's ancient history.

666
00:57:27,922 --> 00:57:31,006
Well, I never was very good at history.

667
00:57:31,717 --> 00:57:35,963
Let me see. There was Miss Olsen,
and then there was Miss Rossi.

668
00:57:36,097 --> 00:57:39,215
No, she came before.
Miss Koch came after Miss Olsen.

669
00:57:39,350 --> 00:57:41,757
- Now, Fran...
- And just think.

670
00:57:41,893 --> 00:57:45,761
Right now some lucky girl in the building
is gonna come after me.

671
00:57:45,897 --> 00:57:48,648
OK. OK, Fran. I guess I deserved that.

672
00:57:48,774 --> 00:57:52,903
But ask yourself: why does a man
run around with a lot of girls?

673
00:57:53,029 --> 00:57:56,812
Because he's unhappy at home.
Because he's lonely. That's why.

674
00:57:56,949 --> 00:58:00,199
But that was before you, Fran.
I've stopped running.

675
00:58:01,744 --> 00:58:05,872
How could I be so stupid?
You'd think I would've learned by now.

676
00:58:05,998 --> 00:58:10,542
When you're in love with a married man,
you shouldn't wear mascara.

677
00:58:11,294 --> 00:58:14,415
It's Christmas Eve, Fran.
Let's not fight, huh?

678
00:58:16,717 --> 00:58:19,173
- Merry Christmas.
- What is it?

679
00:58:24,683 --> 00:58:27,350
Oh. Our friend at the Chinese restaurant.

680
00:58:28,603 --> 00:58:33,892
- Thanks, Fran. We'd better keep it here.
- Yeah, we'd better.

681
00:58:34,650 --> 00:58:36,773
Oh, I have a present for you.

682
00:58:36,902 --> 00:58:41,278
I didn't know what to get you. Besides,
it's kind of awkward for me shopping, so...

683
00:58:41,405 --> 00:58:44,907
Here's $100. You go
and buy yourself something.

684
00:58:49,871 --> 00:58:53,076
They have some nice
alligator bags at Bergdorf's.

685
00:59:04,844 --> 00:59:08,973
I didn't realize it was so late. Its quarter
to seven. I mustn't miss my train.

686
00:59:09,099 --> 00:59:13,642
If we hadn't wasted all this time...
I have to get home and trim the tree.

687
00:59:14,229 --> 00:59:18,096
OK. I just thought,
as long as it was paid for...

688
00:59:18,232 --> 00:59:20,356
Don't ever talk like that, Fran.

689
00:59:20,485 --> 00:59:24,613
- Don't make yourself out to be cheap.
- $100? I don't call that cheap.

690
00:59:24,739 --> 00:59:28,867
And you must be paying somebody
something for the use of the apartment.

691
00:59:28,993 --> 00:59:31,033
Stop it, Fran.

692
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:34,160
You'll miss your train, Jeff.

693
00:59:42,797 --> 00:59:44,421
Are you coming?

694
00:59:44,548 --> 00:59:47,218
No, you run along. I'm gonna fix my face.

695
00:59:47,343 --> 00:59:49,880
Don't forget to kill the lights.
See you Monday.

696
00:59:50,011 --> 00:59:53,595
Sure. Monday... and Thursday...

697
00:59:53,724 --> 00:59:56,974
..and Monday again, and Thursday again.

698
00:59:58,937 --> 01:00:01,855
It won't always be like this, Fran.

699
01:00:01,983 --> 01:00:04,140
I love you.

700
01:00:04,276 --> 01:00:06,517
Careful. Lipstick.

701
01:00:07,862 --> 01:00:09,900
Merry Christmas.

702
01:00:25,335 --> 01:00:27,375
(Sighs)

703
01:00:36,930 --> 01:00:38,970
("Jealous Lover")

704
01:00:43,186 --> 01:00:45,226
(Sniffs)

705
01:00:56,866 --> 01:00:58,906
(Sobs)

706
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:23,734
(Big band blues)

707
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:40,116
- Drink up, pop. It's closing time.
- But it's early, Charlie.

708
01:02:40,252 --> 01:02:43,836
- Don't you know what night this is?
- I know, Charlie. I know.

709
01:02:43,966 --> 01:02:46,004
I work for the outfit.

710
01:02:51,598 --> 01:02:54,348
Hey, knock it off, will ya? Go home.

711
01:03:02,564 --> 01:03:04,772
O-U-T. Out!

712
01:03:09,698 --> 01:03:12,365
Where'll we go? My place or yours?

713
01:03:14,995 --> 01:03:18,327
Might as well go to mine.
Everybody else does.

714
01:03:30,050 --> 01:03:35,423
Poor Mickey. When I think of him
all by himself in that jail in Havana...

715
01:03:35,554 --> 01:03:37,797
Would you like to see his picture?

716
01:03:37,932 --> 01:03:39,970
Not particularly.

717
01:03:41,351 --> 01:03:46,180
He's so cute. He's 5 foot 2, 99 pounds.

718
01:03:46,315 --> 01:03:48,354
Like a little Chihuahua.

719
01:04:01,162 --> 01:04:04,365
- Can I ask you a personal question?
- No.

720
01:04:04,498 --> 01:04:06,455
You got a girlfriend?

721
01:04:06,584 --> 01:04:09,454
She may be a girl
but she is no friend of mine.

722
01:04:09,587 --> 01:04:13,749
- Still stuck on her, huh?
- Obviously you don't know me very well.

723
01:04:13,923 --> 01:04:16,627
- I don't know you at all.
- Permit me.

724
01:04:17,093 --> 01:04:23,546
CC Baxter. Junior executive,
Arthur Murray graduate... lover.

725
01:04:23,683 --> 01:04:27,051
I'm Mrs. MacDougall. Margie to you.

726
01:04:28,436 --> 01:04:30,476
This way, Mrs. MacDougall.

727
01:04:40,948 --> 01:04:43,783
Say! This is snugsville!

728
01:04:43,909 --> 01:04:46,531
Mrs. MacDougall,
it's only fair to warn you...

729
01:04:46,662 --> 01:04:50,030
..you are now alone
with a notorious sexpot.

730
01:04:50,165 --> 01:04:52,836
- No kiddin'!
- Ask anybody around here.

731
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:57,040
As a matter of fact, when it's time for me
to go - and I may go just like that -

732
01:04:57,172 --> 01:05:00,090
I have promised my body
to the Columbia Medical Center.

733
01:05:00,217 --> 01:05:03,216
Gee! Sort of gives you goose bumps
just to think about it.

734
01:05:03,344 --> 01:05:06,630
They haven't got me yet, baby.
Dig up some ice from the kitchen.

735
01:05:06,765 --> 01:05:09,681
Let's not waste any more time
preliminary-wise.

736
01:05:09,808 --> 01:05:11,848
I'm with you, lover.

737
01:05:34,665 --> 01:05:36,740
(Latin-beat dance music)

738
01:05:36,875 --> 01:05:38,915
(Hums along)

739
01:06:28,465 --> 01:06:30,921
All right, Miss Kubelik. Get up.

740
01:06:31,717 --> 01:06:33,924
Come on. It's past checking-out time.

741
01:06:34,053 --> 01:06:38,431
The management would appreciate it
if you'd get the hell outta here.

742
01:06:41,225 --> 01:06:46,565
I used to like you. I used to like you a lot.
Well, it's all over between us, so beat it.

743
01:06:47,232 --> 01:06:49,272
O-U-T, out!

744
01:06:50,443 --> 01:06:52,483
Come on, wake up.

745
01:06:59,035 --> 01:07:01,075
Oh my God.

746
01:07:01,204 --> 01:07:03,242
Miss Kubelik?

747
01:07:03,956 --> 01:07:05,995
Miss Kubelik?

748
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:18,716
I broke a nail tryin' to get the tray out.

749
01:07:18,844 --> 01:07:21,930
You oughta buy yourself
a new refrigerator.

750
01:07:24,349 --> 01:07:26,177
I didn't mean right now!

751
01:07:29,188 --> 01:07:31,227
Dr. Dreyfuss.

752
01:07:31,816 --> 01:07:33,854
Doc!

753
01:07:34,859 --> 01:07:38,905
There's a girl in my place, took
some sleeping pills. I can't wake her up.

754
01:07:39,031 --> 01:07:41,070
- Let me get my bag.
- Hurry up!

755
01:07:43,075 --> 01:07:46,610
Hey, over here, lover.
What's all the running around about?

756
01:07:46,745 --> 01:07:49,415
You're gonna wear yourself out.

757
01:07:50,249 --> 01:07:52,823
- Not so rough, honey!
- Good night.

758
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:55,000
- Good night?!
- The party's over.

759
01:07:55,129 --> 01:07:57,334
What? Did I do somethin' wrong?

760
01:07:57,463 --> 01:08:00,797
It's an emergency.
I'll see you some other time.

761
01:08:00,926 --> 01:08:02,964
Not this one. In there, Doc.

762
01:08:03,970 --> 01:08:07,718
- What's goin' on here, anyway?
- Will you please just get out?!

763
01:08:07,849 --> 01:08:09,390
My shoes!

764
01:08:09,517 --> 01:08:12,517
Some lover you are! Some sexpot!

765
01:08:12,644 --> 01:08:15,397
Here. Find a phone.
Call your husband in Havana.

766
01:08:15,523 --> 01:08:20,978
You bet I will! And when I tell him how
you treated me, he'll push your face in!

767
01:08:21,111 --> 01:08:23,150
You fink!

768
01:08:38,710 --> 01:08:40,750
Is she gonna be all right, Doc?

769
01:08:40,879 --> 01:08:44,924
- How many pills were in that bottle?
- It was half-full. About a dozen.

770
01:08:45,050 --> 01:08:48,050
- Do you have to take her to the hospital?
- Help me, will you?

771
01:08:48,177 --> 01:08:50,847
- Into the bathroom.
- What are you gonna do?

772
01:08:50,972 --> 01:08:53,759
Get that stuff out of her stomach
if it isn't too late.

773
01:08:53,891 --> 01:08:56,559
You'd better put some coffee on,
and pray.

774
01:09:26,380 --> 01:09:28,419
(Fran vomits and coughs)

775
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:53,526
Bring my bag.

776
01:10:03,372 --> 01:10:05,412
Roll up her right sleeve.

777
01:10:15,216 --> 01:10:17,256
Hold that.

778
01:10:24,268 --> 01:10:26,305
Nice veins.

779
01:10:38,072 --> 01:10:40,906
Wanna tell me what happened?

780
01:10:41,032 --> 01:10:43,700
I don't know. I mean, I wasn't even here.

781
01:10:46,747 --> 01:10:50,529
You see, we had... some words earlier.

782
01:10:50,666 --> 01:10:54,794
It was nothin' serious.
You might call it a lovers' quarrel.

783
01:10:55,796 --> 01:10:58,712
So you went right out
and picked yourself up another dame.

784
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:03,631
- Something like that.
- You know, Baxter, you're a real cutie pie.

785
01:11:03,761 --> 01:11:05,304
Yes, you are.

786
01:11:13,479 --> 01:11:18,603
If you'd come home half an hour later,
you'd have had quite a Christmas present.

787
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:36,829
(Kettle whistles)

788
01:11:37,418 --> 01:11:39,457
Get the coffee.

789
01:11:41,170 --> 01:11:43,210
(Fran moans)

790
01:12:03,065 --> 01:12:05,902
Let's get some air in here.
Open the windows.

791
01:12:09,030 --> 01:12:11,070
(Fran coughs)

792
01:12:21,208 --> 01:12:23,248
What's her name?

793
01:12:23,377 --> 01:12:26,080
Miss Kubelik. Fran.

794
01:12:29,465 --> 01:12:34,708
Fran, I'm a doctor. I'm here because
you took too many sleeping pills.

795
01:12:34,845 --> 01:12:37,052
Do you understand what I'm saying?

796
01:12:37,182 --> 01:12:38,677
(Fran moans)

797
01:12:38,809 --> 01:12:42,258
Fran, I'm Dr. Dreyfuss.
I'm here to help you.

798
01:12:42,395 --> 01:12:45,311
You took all those sleeping pills.
Remember?

799
01:12:46,523 --> 01:12:50,141
- Sleeping pills.
- That's right, Fran. And I'm a doctor.

800
01:12:50,986 --> 01:12:53,821
- Doctor?
- Dr. Dreyfuss.

801
01:12:56,324 --> 01:12:57,902
Dreyfuss.

802
01:12:58,034 --> 01:13:00,074
Get more coffee.

803
01:13:00,997 --> 01:13:03,450
Now tell me again. What's my name?

804
01:13:06,668 --> 01:13:09,039
Dr.... Dreyfuss.

805
01:13:09,169 --> 01:13:11,209
And what happened to you?

806
01:13:11,798 --> 01:13:13,504
I...

807
01:13:13,631 --> 01:13:15,672
I took sleeping pills.

808
01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:18,714
Do you know where you are?

809
01:13:20,722 --> 01:13:24,007
- No.
- Yes, you do, Fran. Now concentrate!

810
01:13:25,935 --> 01:13:27,975
I don't know.

811
01:13:28,896 --> 01:13:30,936
Do you know who that is?

812
01:13:37,696 --> 01:13:39,736
Look at him.

813
01:13:40,823 --> 01:13:43,695
Mr. Baxter. 19th floor.

814
01:13:44,410 --> 01:13:46,450
Hello, Miss Kubelik.

815
01:13:46,913 --> 01:13:49,451
Mr.? Miss? Such politeness!

816
01:13:50,749 --> 01:13:54,748
We work in the same building.
We try to keep it quiet.

817
01:13:56,421 --> 01:13:59,091
What are you doing here?

818
01:14:00,675 --> 01:14:04,424
Don't you remember
we were together at the office party?

819
01:14:04,554 --> 01:14:06,961
Oh, yes. The office party.

820
01:14:07,098 --> 01:14:09,672
- Miss Olsen.
- That's right.

821
01:14:09,810 --> 01:14:12,764
I told you we had a fight.
That was what it was about.

822
01:14:12,896 --> 01:14:16,230
Miss Olsen. That girl
that was here earlier.

823
01:14:17,815 --> 01:14:20,521
I don't understand.

824
01:14:20,653 --> 01:14:26,026
The main thing is I got here in time and
you're gonna be all right. Isn't she, Doc?

825
01:14:26,951 --> 01:14:29,238
I'm so tired.

826
01:14:29,368 --> 01:14:31,409
Come on. Drink this.

827
01:14:31,788 --> 01:14:34,492
Please... just let me sleep.

828
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:38,407
No, you can't sleep! Fran, open your eyes!

829
01:14:39,086 --> 01:14:41,125
Let's get her walking.

830
01:14:43,798 --> 01:14:48,425
We've got to keep her awake for the next
few hours. Now come on, Fran, walk!

831
01:14:48,553 --> 01:14:51,126
One, two, three, four!

832
01:14:51,264 --> 01:14:53,554
One, two, three, four!

833
01:14:53,684 --> 01:14:55,889
Left, right, left, right,...

834
01:14:56,018 --> 01:14:58,260
..left, right and return!

835
01:14:58,396 --> 01:15:01,598
And... one, two, three, four!

836
01:15:01,732 --> 01:15:05,147
Now you've got it! One, two, three, four!

837
01:15:05,277 --> 01:15:08,529
Walk, Fran! One, two, three, four!

838
01:15:08,657 --> 01:15:11,323
One, two... And return again.

839
01:15:11,449 --> 01:15:14,569
And... left, right, left, right.

840
01:15:21,792 --> 01:15:25,125
She'll sleep on and off
for the next 24 hours.

841
01:15:25,253 --> 01:15:28,955
Of course, she'll have
a dandy hangover when she wakes up.

842
01:15:29,091 --> 01:15:31,132
Just as long as she's OK.

843
01:15:31,261 --> 01:15:36,765
These cases are harder on the doctor than
the patient. I oughta charge by the mile.

844
01:15:36,890 --> 01:15:39,975
- Any of that coffee left?
- Yeah, sure.

845
01:15:40,977 --> 01:15:43,431
How do you spell her last name?

846
01:15:43,561 --> 01:15:46,055
Kubelik. Two k's.

847
01:15:46,191 --> 01:15:48,229
What's her address?

848
01:15:48,984 --> 01:15:51,023
Where does she live?

849
01:15:52,028 --> 01:15:54,485
Why do you wanna know, Doc?

850
01:15:55,574 --> 01:15:58,740
- You don't have to report this, do you?
- It's regulations.

851
01:15:58,869 --> 01:16:03,862
But it was an accident. She had too much
to drink, didn't know what she was doing.

852
01:16:03,998 --> 01:16:06,156
There was no suicide note or anything.

853
01:16:06,292 --> 01:16:09,412
- I'm not thinkin' about myself.
- Aren't you?

854
01:16:09,545 --> 01:16:13,045
She's got a family,
and there's the people at the office.

855
01:16:13,174 --> 01:16:17,089
Can't you forget you're a doctor,
just say you're here as a neighbour?

856
01:16:17,220 --> 01:16:20,088
Well, as a doctor, I can't prove
it wasn't an accident.

857
01:16:20,221 --> 01:16:23,425
But as your neighbour,
I'd like to kick you around the block.

858
01:16:23,559 --> 01:16:26,095
- Mind if I cool this off?
- Help yourself.

859
01:16:26,226 --> 01:16:28,633
I don't know what you did to that girl,...

860
01:16:28,771 --> 01:16:31,309
..but it was bound to happen,
the way you carry on.

861
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:33,895
Live now, pay later. Diners Club!

862
01:16:35,860 --> 01:16:38,815
Why don't you grow up, Baxter?
Be a mensch.

863
01:16:38,947 --> 01:16:41,354
- You know what that means?
- I'm not sure.

864
01:16:41,490 --> 01:16:43,530
A mensch/ A human being!

865
01:16:44,536 --> 01:16:47,571
So you got off easy this time.
So you were lucky.

866
01:16:47,704 --> 01:16:52,366
But you're not out of the woods yet,
because most of 'em try it again.

867
01:16:53,419 --> 01:16:55,993
Well, you know where I am
if you need me.

868
01:18:07,988 --> 01:18:10,776
Mr. Baxter! Open up already.

869
01:18:14,036 --> 01:18:16,029
Oh.

870
01:18:16,163 --> 01:18:19,578
- Mrs. Lieberman.
- Who did you think it was? Kriss Kringle?

871
01:18:19,707 --> 01:18:21,830
What was going on here last night?

872
01:18:21,959 --> 01:18:25,327
- Last night?
- All that marching! Tramp, tramp, tramp!

873
01:18:25,461 --> 01:18:28,879
- Army manoeuvres maybe?
- I'll never invite those people again.

874
01:18:29,008 --> 01:18:33,220
What you get from renting to bachelors.
All night I didn't sleep ten minutes.

875
01:18:33,346 --> 01:18:38,850
- And I'm sure you woke up Dr. Dreyfuss.
- Don't worry. He was out on a case.

876
01:18:38,976 --> 01:18:44,100
I'm warning you, Mr. Baxter. This is
a respectable house, not a honky-tonky.

877
01:18:44,230 --> 01:18:46,270
Come on, Oscar.

878
01:19:14,183 --> 01:19:18,843
Operator, I want White Plains,
New York. Mr. JD Sheldrake.

879
01:19:18,977 --> 01:19:21,018
Make that person-to-person.

880
01:19:25,820 --> 01:19:28,855
Five, four, three, two, one...

881
01:19:28,988 --> 01:19:31,561
- Let her rip!
- (Phone rings)

882
01:19:31,699 --> 01:19:33,325
I'll get the phone.

883
01:19:33,452 --> 01:19:36,405
Hey, Dad, why don't we
put a fly in the nose cone?

884
01:19:36,537 --> 01:19:39,454
- See if we can bring it back alive.
- That's a thought.

885
01:19:39,582 --> 01:19:43,661
Maybe we should put in two flies
and see if they'll propagate in orbit.

886
01:19:43,795 --> 01:19:47,957
- See if they'll what?
- Propagate. You know. Multiply.

887
01:19:48,091 --> 01:19:51,789
- Baby flies?
- Oh. Oh!

888
01:19:52,636 --> 01:19:55,209
- It's for you, Dad.
- Thanks, Jeff.

889
01:19:55,345 --> 01:19:58,549
A Mr. Baxter. Person-to-person.

890
01:19:58,682 --> 01:20:01,304
Come on. Help me round up some flies.

891
01:20:01,435 --> 01:20:06,179
- Hello? What's on your mind, Baxter?
- Something came up that's important.

892
01:20:06,315 --> 01:20:09,898
I think you should see me
at the apartment as soon as possible.

893
01:20:10,027 --> 01:20:13,775
- What's this all about?
- I didn't wanna tell you over the phone.

894
01:20:13,905 --> 01:20:19,028
But that certain party... You know
who I mean. I found her here last night.

895
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:22,279
- She took an overdose of sleeping pills.
- What?!

896
01:20:24,694 --> 01:20:28,689
- What is it, Jeff? Who's on the phone?
- One of our employees had an accident.

897
01:20:28,823 --> 01:20:32,240
I don't know why they bother me
with these things on Christmas Day.

898
01:20:32,369 --> 01:20:34,195
Yes, Baxter.

899
01:20:34,328 --> 01:20:36,368
Just how serious is it?

900
01:20:36,497 --> 01:20:40,161
It was touch and go there for a while,
but she's sleeping it off now.

901
01:20:40,291 --> 01:20:43,292
I thought maybe you'd like to
be here when she wakes up.

902
01:20:44,379 --> 01:20:48,839
That's impossible. You'll have to
handle the situation yourself, Baxter.

903
01:20:48,966 --> 01:20:53,379
- As a matter of fact, I'm counting on you.
- Yes, sir. I understand.

904
01:20:53,513 --> 01:20:57,889
She left a letter. Would you like me
to open it and read it to you?

905
01:20:58,017 --> 01:21:00,766
Well, it was just a suggestion.

906
01:21:00,893 --> 01:21:04,808
No, don't worry. I kept your name
out of it, so there'll be no trouble,...

907
01:21:04,939 --> 01:21:07,396
..police-wise or newspaper-wise.

908
01:21:08,652 --> 01:21:13,028
You see, the doctor is a friend of mine,
so we were very lucky in that respect.

909
01:21:13,155 --> 01:21:15,611
Actually, he thinks she's my girl.

910
01:21:16,492 --> 01:21:18,734
No, he just jumped to the conclusion.

911
01:21:18,869 --> 01:21:21,705
Around here I'm known as
quite a ladies' man.

912
01:21:21,831 --> 01:21:26,078
Of course, we're not out of the woods yet.
Sometimes they try it again.

913
01:21:26,210 --> 01:21:30,124
Yes, sir. I'll do my best. It'll take her
a couple of days to fully recover...

914
01:21:30,255 --> 01:21:33,540
..and I may have a little problem
with the landlady.

915
01:21:34,259 --> 01:21:37,711
OK, Mr. Sheldrake. I'll keep her
in the apartment as long as I can.

916
01:21:37,846 --> 01:21:41,380
Isn't there some sort of message
you want me to give her?

917
01:21:41,850 --> 01:21:44,055
Well, I'll... think of something.

918
01:21:44,642 --> 01:21:46,766
Yes, sir. Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.

919
01:21:49,648 --> 01:21:51,688
I'm sorry.

920
01:21:52,443 --> 01:21:56,061
- I'm sorry, Mr. Baxter.
- What are you doing out of bed?

921
01:21:56,196 --> 01:21:59,399
I didn't know. I had no idea
this was your apartment.

922
01:21:59,532 --> 01:22:02,237
Here. Let me help you.

923
01:22:02,743 --> 01:22:04,783
Oh, I'm so ashamed.

924
01:22:04,912 --> 01:22:06,950
Why didn't you just let me die?

925
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:12,666
What kind of talk is that? You got
a little overemotional, but you're fine now.

926
01:22:12,795 --> 01:22:14,253
Oh!

927
01:22:14,379 --> 01:22:18,709
Oh, my head! It feels just like
a big wad of chewing gum.

928
01:22:18,842 --> 01:22:21,593
- What time is it?
- Two o'clock.

929
01:22:21,719 --> 01:22:23,961
Oh, my dress. I have to go home.

930
01:22:24,097 --> 01:22:26,551
You're in no shape
to go anywhere but back to bed.

931
01:22:26,682 --> 01:22:29,174
- You don't want me here.
- Sure I do. I...

932
01:22:29,309 --> 01:22:32,429
It's always nice
to have company for Christmas.

933
01:22:32,563 --> 01:22:36,096
- I'm stronger than you are.
- I just wanna brush my teeth.

934
01:22:36,232 --> 01:22:39,768
Oh. Of course. I think I can find
a new toothbrush somewhere.

935
01:22:39,903 --> 01:22:42,571
Here. Put that on.

936
01:23:11,265 --> 01:23:15,014
- How about some breakfast?
- No. I don't want anything.

937
01:23:15,144 --> 01:23:17,184
I'll fix you some coffee.

938
01:23:17,313 --> 01:23:21,641
Oh! We're all out of coffee.
You had quite a lot last night.

939
01:23:21,774 --> 01:23:23,815
Back in a minute.

940
01:23:33,245 --> 01:23:35,569
Mrs. Dreyfuss,
could I borrow some coffee?

941
01:23:35,704 --> 01:23:39,488
- And an orange and a couple of eggs?
- Eggs, he asks me for! Oranges!

942
01:23:39,625 --> 01:23:44,120
What you need is a good horsewhipping!
From me the doctor has no secrets.

943
01:23:44,254 --> 01:23:46,496
Poor girl. How could you do such a thing?

944
01:23:46,632 --> 01:23:49,586
I didn't do anything. Honest. It's just...

945
01:23:50,468 --> 01:23:55,973
You take a girl out just for laughs and
she thinks you're serious marriage-wise.

946
01:23:56,099 --> 01:23:59,597
Big shot! For you, I wouldn't lift a finger!

947
01:23:59,726 --> 01:24:02,811
But for her, I'll fix a little something to eat.

948
01:24:11,363 --> 01:24:13,106
Who are you calling?

949
01:24:13,239 --> 01:24:15,362
My sister, to tell her
what happened to me.

950
01:24:15,491 --> 01:24:20,449
Wait a minute! Let's talk it over first.
Just what are you gonna tell her?

951
01:24:21,245 --> 01:24:25,196
- I haven't figured it out exactly.
- Well, you'd better figure it out exactly.

952
01:24:25,334 --> 01:24:28,418
Suppose she asks you why
you didn't come home last night.

953
01:24:28,545 --> 01:24:30,501
I'll say I spent the night with a friend.

954
01:24:30,629 --> 01:24:32,670
- Who?
- Someone from the office.

955
01:24:32,799 --> 01:24:34,627
- Where are you now?
- In his apartment.

956
01:24:34,760 --> 01:24:37,130
- In his apartment?
- In her apartment.

957
01:24:37,261 --> 01:24:39,468
- What's your friend's name?
- Baxter.

958
01:24:39,598 --> 01:24:42,680
- What's her first name?
- Miss.

959
01:24:42,808 --> 01:24:45,643
- When are you comin' home?
- As soon as I can walk.

960
01:24:45,769 --> 01:24:47,809
- Your legs hurt?
- No, my stomach.

961
01:24:47,938 --> 01:24:50,725
- Your stomach?
- They had to pump it out!

962
01:24:50,857 --> 01:24:55,769
You shouldn't call anybody. Not till you
get the chewing gum out of your head.

963
01:24:55,905 --> 01:24:59,070
They'll be worried about me.
They might call the police.

964
01:24:59,198 --> 01:25:02,402
We have to be careful.
We don't wanna involve anybody.

965
01:25:02,535 --> 01:25:05,619
After all, Mr. Sheldrake's a married man.

966
01:25:06,455 --> 01:25:08,494
Thanks for reminding me!

967
01:25:12,294 --> 01:25:14,333
I didn't mean it that way.

968
01:25:14,462 --> 01:25:18,590
I was just talking to him on the phone.
He's very concerned about you.

969
01:25:18,716 --> 01:25:21,468
He doesn't give a damn about me.

970
01:25:21,595 --> 01:25:25,343
- You're wrong. He told me...
- He's a liar.

971
01:25:25,473 --> 01:25:27,713
But that's not the worst part.

972
01:25:27,850 --> 01:25:30,223
The worst part is I still love him.

973
01:25:31,144 --> 01:25:33,185
(Doorbell)

974
01:25:34,273 --> 01:25:36,478
Oh. That must be Mrs. Dreyfuss.

975
01:25:36,608 --> 01:25:40,060
Remember the doctor from last night?
That's his wife.

976
01:25:41,780 --> 01:25:43,819
So where's the victim?

977
01:25:44,865 --> 01:25:46,905
Max the Knife!

978
01:25:49,539 --> 01:25:53,785
- Nu, little lady, how are we feeling today?
- I don't know. Kind of dizzy.

979
01:25:53,917 --> 01:25:59,289
The best thing for dizzy is noodle soup
with chicken white meat and a glass tea.

980
01:25:59,421 --> 01:26:03,881
- No, thank you. I'm really not hungry.
- Go ahead, eat. Enjoy.

981
01:26:04,008 --> 01:26:06,926
You wouldn't have such a thing
as a napkin, would you?

982
01:26:07,053 --> 01:26:10,256
- I have some paper towels.
- Beatnik.

983
01:26:10,390 --> 01:26:13,888
In my kitchen, third drawer,
under the good silver, are napkins.

984
01:26:14,017 --> 01:26:15,393
Yes, Mrs. Dreyfuss.

985
01:26:15,519 --> 01:26:18,140
So, what are you waiting for?
A singing commercial?

986
01:26:18,271 --> 01:26:20,311
- I can't eat.
- You must eat.

987
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:23,606
And you must get healthy
and you must forget him.

988
01:26:23,734 --> 01:26:27,021
Such a fine boy he seemed
when he first moved in here.

989
01:26:27,156 --> 01:26:30,155
Clean and cut, a regular lvy Leaguer.

990
01:26:30,284 --> 01:26:34,744
Turns out he's King Farouk,
with the drinking, with the cha-cha.

991
01:26:34,870 --> 01:26:36,910
With the no napkins.

992
01:26:37,039 --> 01:26:41,084
A girl like you, for the rest of your life
you wanna cry in your noodle soup?

993
01:26:41,210 --> 01:26:43,783
Who needs it? Now you listen to me.

994
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:48,084
You'll find yourself a nice,
substantial man - a widower, maybe -

995
01:26:48,217 --> 01:26:51,881
and settle down, instead of
noshing all those sleeping pills.

996
01:26:52,011 --> 01:26:55,177
For what? For whom?
For some good-time Charlie?

997
01:26:55,305 --> 01:26:57,216
- (Door opens)
- Shh.

998
01:26:57,349 --> 01:27:01,394
One napkin comin' up. Wish we had
some champagne to wrap it around.

999
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:04,687
- What did I tell you?
- Mrs. Dreyfuss, you don't have to wait.

1000
01:27:04,815 --> 01:27:08,765
- I'll wash the dishes.
- You'd break 'em. I'll come back for them.

1001
01:27:08,903 --> 01:27:11,393
If he makes trouble, give me a yell.

1002
01:27:12,738 --> 01:27:16,571
- She doesn't seem to like you very much.
- Oh, I don't mind.

1003
01:27:16,701 --> 01:27:19,275
As a matter of fact, I'm sort of flattered.

1004
01:27:19,412 --> 01:27:24,572
That anybody'd think a girl like you would
do a thing like this over a guy like me.

1005
01:27:25,793 --> 01:27:28,876
Did you find something here?
An envelope?

1006
01:27:29,003 --> 01:27:30,582
Yes. I've got it.

1007
01:27:30,714 --> 01:27:35,090
Don't you think we'd better destroy it
so it won't fall in the wrong hands?

1008
01:27:35,217 --> 01:27:37,257
Open it.

1009
01:27:40,932 --> 01:27:43,504
There's nothing here but a $100 bill.

1010
01:27:43,642 --> 01:27:47,011
That's right. Will you see
that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?

1011
01:27:48,189 --> 01:27:50,227
Sure.

1012
01:27:51,734 --> 01:27:53,772
Take this away, will you?

1013
01:27:54,485 --> 01:27:57,356
Would you like me to move
the television set in here?

1014
01:27:57,488 --> 01:28:00,240
- You play gin rummy?
- I'm not very good at it.

1015
01:28:00,366 --> 01:28:04,364
- I am. Let me get the cards.
- You don't have to entertain me.

1016
01:28:04,495 --> 01:28:08,244
There's nothing I'd like better.
You know. Togetherness.

1017
01:28:08,374 --> 01:28:13,082
Guess what I did last Christmas. Had
dinner at the automat, went to the zoo,...

1018
01:28:13,212 --> 01:28:15,998
..then came home and cleaned up
after Mr. Eichelberger.

1019
01:28:16,131 --> 01:28:18,505
He had a little eggnog party here.

1020
01:28:18,635 --> 01:28:20,921
So I'm way ahead this year.

1021
01:28:21,051 --> 01:28:23,803
Three across. Spades double?

1022
01:28:23,930 --> 01:28:25,969
High deals.

1023
01:28:26,640 --> 01:28:28,679
Six? Eight.

1024
01:28:36,691 --> 01:28:39,563
I think I'm gonna give it all up.

1025
01:28:40,821 --> 01:28:42,562
Give what up?

1026
01:28:45,617 --> 01:28:48,618
Why do people have to
love people, anyway?

1027
01:28:50,037 --> 01:28:52,077
I know what you mean.

1028
01:28:55,335 --> 01:28:57,373
Queen.

1029
01:29:00,130 --> 01:29:02,586
- I don't want it.
- Pick a card.

1030
01:29:07,429 --> 01:29:11,806
What do you call it when somebody keeps
gettin' smashed up in car accidents?

1031
01:29:11,933 --> 01:29:15,217
- Bad insurance risk?
- That's me with men.

1032
01:29:16,896 --> 01:29:21,687
I was jinxed from the word go. First time
I was ever kissed was in a cemetery.

1033
01:29:21,817 --> 01:29:23,941
A cemetery?

1034
01:29:24,070 --> 01:29:26,821
I was 15. We used to go there to smoke.

1035
01:29:26,947 --> 01:29:31,074
His name was George and
he threw me over for a drum majorette.

1036
01:29:32,536 --> 01:29:34,575
Uh, gin.

1037
01:29:37,999 --> 01:29:43,289
That's 10, 20... 36.
And 25 makes 61 and two boxes.

1038
01:29:43,420 --> 01:29:45,497
I have this talent for falling in love...

1039
01:29:45,631 --> 01:29:49,082
..with the wrong guy
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

1040
01:29:49,844 --> 01:29:52,001
Well, how many guys were there?

1041
01:29:53,220 --> 01:29:55,049
Three.

1042
01:29:55,182 --> 01:29:59,130
The last one was the manager of a finance
company back home in Pittsburgh.

1043
01:29:59,268 --> 01:30:01,308
They found a shortage in his accounts.

1044
01:30:01,437 --> 01:30:05,185
He asked me to wait for him.
He'll be out in 1965.

1045
01:30:06,733 --> 01:30:08,773
Cut.

1046
01:30:09,444 --> 01:30:14,521
So I came to New York and moved in with
my sister and her husband, a cab driver.

1047
01:30:14,657 --> 01:30:19,533
They sent me to secretarial school and
then I applied for a job at Consolidated.

1048
01:30:19,662 --> 01:30:21,869
But I flunked the typing test.

1049
01:30:21,998 --> 01:30:24,785
- Too slow?
- No. I can type up a storm.

1050
01:30:24,916 --> 01:30:26,957
I just can't spell.

1051
01:30:28,003 --> 01:30:33,080
So they gave me a pair of white gloves
and stuck me in an elevator.

1052
01:30:33,218 --> 01:30:35,671
And that's how I met Jeff.

1053
01:30:36,887 --> 01:30:39,555
Oh God, I'm so fouled up.

1054
01:30:39,681 --> 01:30:42,089
What am I gonna do now?

1055
01:30:44,309 --> 01:30:46,517
Better win a hand. You're on a blitz.

1056
01:30:48,146 --> 01:30:51,017
Was he very upset when you told him?

1057
01:30:51,149 --> 01:30:53,189
Mr. Sheldrake? Yeah, very.

1058
01:30:54,486 --> 01:30:58,185
Maybe he does love me, only he doesn't
have the nerve to tell his wife.

1059
01:30:58,323 --> 01:30:59,782
I'm sure that's it.

1060
01:30:59,908 --> 01:31:03,277
- You really think so?
- No doubt about it.

1061
01:31:04,704 --> 01:31:06,992
Would you hand me that pad and pencil?

1062
01:31:07,122 --> 01:31:10,160
- What for?
- I'm gonna write to Mrs. Sheldrake.

1063
01:31:10,293 --> 01:31:12,616
- You what?
- As one woman to another.

1064
01:31:12,752 --> 01:31:16,703
- I'm sure she'll understand.
- I don't think that's a very good idea.

1065
01:31:16,840 --> 01:31:20,255
- Why not?
- For one thing, you can't spell.

1066
01:31:20,386 --> 01:31:24,513
Secondly, if you did something
like that, you'd hate yourself.

1067
01:31:25,682 --> 01:31:28,351
I don't like myself very much anyway.

1068
01:31:30,310 --> 01:31:32,719
Pick up the cards. Let's go.

1069
01:31:32,856 --> 01:31:35,939
- Do I have to?
- You bet. I got a terrific hand.

1070
01:31:42,697 --> 01:31:45,568
- You really wanna discard that?
- Sure.

1071
01:31:45,700 --> 01:31:47,527
Gin.

1072
01:31:50,245 --> 01:31:51,740
(Hums nervously)

1073
01:31:51,872 --> 01:31:56,831
10, 20, 40, 52 and 25... 77.

1074
01:31:57,586 --> 01:32:01,038
Spades are double... 154.

1075
01:32:06,219 --> 01:32:08,258
Blitzed. Two games.

1076
01:33:09,570 --> 01:33:11,777
(Sylvia hums along to dance music)

1077
01:33:30,131 --> 01:33:32,170
(Doorbell)

1078
01:33:38,429 --> 01:33:41,715
- (Doorbell)
- All right, all right, Mrs. Dreyfuss.

1079
01:33:49,232 --> 01:33:51,058
- Hi, Baxter.
- What do you want?

1080
01:33:51,191 --> 01:33:53,231
What do I want? Just a minute.

1081
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:56,030
- You can't come in!
- What's the matter with you?

1082
01:33:56,155 --> 01:33:58,231
I made a reservation for four o'clock.

1083
01:33:58,364 --> 01:34:00,690
You can't stay.
Take your champagne and go.

1084
01:34:00,825 --> 01:34:04,360
I don't wanna pull rank on you,
but I told the little lady it was all set.

1085
01:34:04,496 --> 01:34:08,197
Are you gonna leave, Mr. Kirkeby,
or do I have to throw you out?

1086
01:34:09,165 --> 01:34:11,919
(Sniggers) Buddy-boy,
why didn't you say so?

1087
01:34:12,045 --> 01:34:15,412
- Got yourself a little playmate, huh?
- Now will you get out?

1088
01:34:15,547 --> 01:34:17,587
(Sylvia hums dance music)

1089
01:34:21,053 --> 01:34:24,422
Hey, come on! What are we waiting for?
Open up, will you?

1090
01:34:24,556 --> 01:34:26,596
(Dr. Dreyfuss) Mildred!

1091
01:34:28,184 --> 01:34:32,644
- What's holding things up?
- Say, let's have a party, the four of us.

1092
01:34:32,771 --> 01:34:34,812
No!

1093
01:34:39,028 --> 01:34:41,352
(Sniggers) Well, I don't blame you.

1094
01:34:41,488 --> 01:34:44,489
So you hit the jackpot, eh, kid?
I mean Kubelik-wise.

1095
01:34:44,616 --> 01:34:47,071
Don't worry.
I won't say a word to anybody.

1096
01:34:47,452 --> 01:34:49,493
Stay with it, Buddy-boy.

1097
01:35:04,593 --> 01:35:06,633
Who was that?

1098
01:35:07,346 --> 01:35:10,845
Just somebody delivering
a bottle of champagne. Like some?

1099
01:35:11,725 --> 01:35:14,393
Would you mind opening that window?

1100
01:35:17,189 --> 01:35:22,527
- Now don't get any ideas, Miss Kubelik.
- I just want some fresh air.

1101
01:35:22,652 --> 01:35:26,021
It's only one storey down.
The best you could do is break a leg.

1102
01:35:26,155 --> 01:35:28,859
So they'll shoot me, like a horse.

1103
01:35:29,199 --> 01:35:32,568
Please, you gotta promise me
you won't do anything foolish.

1104
01:35:32,702 --> 01:35:35,157
- Who'd care?
- I would.

1105
01:35:40,919 --> 01:35:44,833
Why can't I ever fall in love
with somebody nice like you?

1106
01:35:45,756 --> 01:35:47,795
Yeah. Well...

1107
01:35:48,468 --> 01:35:51,419
That's the way it crumbles, cookie-wise.

1108
01:35:52,804 --> 01:35:55,260
Go to sleep.

1109
01:36:29,934 --> 01:36:34,679
- (Women) Good morning, Mr. Sheldrake.
- Miss Olsen, come into my office, please.

1110
01:36:44,114 --> 01:36:48,064
- Did you have a nice Christmas?
- Lovely. You were a great help!

1111
01:36:48,201 --> 01:36:50,870
Your pep talk to Miss Kubelik
at the office party.

1112
01:36:50,996 --> 01:36:55,623
- Sorry, Jeff. I never could hold my liquor.
- I thought you could hold your tongue.

1113
01:36:55,751 --> 01:36:58,287
- It won't happen again.
- You bet it won't.

1114
01:36:58,419 --> 01:37:01,373
I'll arrange for you to get
a month's severance pay.

1115
01:37:01,506 --> 01:37:04,506
That's right, Miss Olsen.
I'm letting you go.

1116
01:37:05,260 --> 01:37:07,832
You let me go four years ago, Jeff.

1117
01:37:07,969 --> 01:37:12,383
And were cruel enough to make me sit out
there and watch the new models pass by.

1118
01:37:12,516 --> 01:37:15,682
I'd appreciate it if you'd be
out of here as soon as you can.

1119
01:37:15,810 --> 01:37:17,850
Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.

1120
01:37:26,654 --> 01:37:30,865
Operator, this is Mr. Sheldrake. I'd like
Mr. Baxter's home telephone number.

1121
01:37:30,991 --> 01:37:33,863
He's in Ordinary Premium Accounting.

1122
01:37:49,259 --> 01:37:52,841
- (Baxter) Hello?
- Hello. Jeff Sheldrake. Can you talk?

1123
01:37:53,595 --> 01:37:55,422
Yes. She's in the shower.

1124
01:37:55,556 --> 01:37:58,260
- She's coming along fine, considering.
- Good.

1125
01:37:58,391 --> 01:38:02,057
- Is there anything you need? Money?
- No, thank you, Mr. Sheldrake.

1126
01:38:02,187 --> 01:38:05,354
As a matter of fact, I have
some money for you. $100.

1127
01:38:05,482 --> 01:38:06,892
Oh.

1128
01:38:07,024 --> 01:38:10,857
- If there's anything I can do for you...
- For me? I don't think so.

1129
01:38:10,986 --> 01:38:13,738
But I was hoping maybe
you could do something for her.

1130
01:38:14,031 --> 01:38:17,399
Like what? Put yourself
in my place, Baxter.

1131
01:38:17,534 --> 01:38:19,741
How can I help her? My hands are tied.

1132
01:38:21,038 --> 01:38:23,493
Well... at least you can talk to her.

1133
01:38:24,625 --> 01:38:28,205
Let me put her on. And please, be gentle.

1134
01:38:28,920 --> 01:38:31,410
There's a call for you!

1135
01:38:31,547 --> 01:38:34,004
- For me?
- Yeah. Mr. Sheldrake.

1136
01:38:35,968 --> 01:38:38,007
I don't wanna talk to him.

1137
01:38:38,137 --> 01:38:40,094
I think you should.

1138
01:38:40,223 --> 01:38:45,560
I gotta run down to the grocery anyway.
There's nothing left here but frozen pizza.

1139
01:38:46,394 --> 01:38:48,433
I'll be right back. OK?

1140
01:39:08,915 --> 01:39:10,954
Hello, Jeff.

1141
01:39:12,419 --> 01:39:15,586
- Yes, I'm all right.
- Why did you do it, Fran?

1142
01:39:15,714 --> 01:39:18,204
It's so childish,
and it never solves anything.

1143
01:39:18,341 --> 01:39:21,010
I oughta be very angry with you,
scaring me that way.

1144
01:39:21,135 --> 01:39:25,928
But let's forget the whole thing, pretend
it never happened. What do you say?

1145
01:39:26,056 --> 01:39:28,095
Fran?

1146
01:39:28,559 --> 01:39:31,096
Are you there, Fran?

1147
01:39:32,604 --> 01:39:37,100
Of course I'm not here, because
the whole thing never happened.

1148
01:39:37,233 --> 01:39:41,100
I never took those pills,
I never loved you,...

1149
01:39:41,237 --> 01:39:43,479
..we never even met.

1150
01:39:44,658 --> 01:39:48,702
- Isn't that the way you want it, Jeff?
- You know I didn't mean it that way.

1151
01:39:48,829 --> 01:39:51,662
You just get well.
Do what the nurse says. I mean Baxter.

1152
01:39:51,788 --> 01:39:54,872
I'll see you as soon as I can.
Goodbye, Fran.

1153
01:40:13,224 --> 01:40:15,799
Hello, Mrs. Sheldrake. This is Miss Olsen.

1154
01:40:15,936 --> 01:40:20,100
Fine, thank you. I was wondering
if we could have lunch together.

1155
01:40:20,983 --> 01:40:24,683
I don't know how important it is,
but you might find it educational.

1156
01:40:24,819 --> 01:40:27,524
It concerns your husband.

1157
01:40:27,656 --> 01:40:31,355
All right. One o'clock,
Longchamps, Madison and 59th.

1158
01:40:37,664 --> 01:40:39,906
Don't worry. I'm on my way.

1159
01:40:40,042 --> 01:40:42,080
Just making a personal call.

1160
01:40:43,795 --> 01:40:45,835
Here's a dime.

1161
01:40:48,632 --> 01:40:50,175
Going down.

1162
01:41:02,561 --> 01:41:05,184
Oh, Mr. Baxter! I'm glad you're here.

1163
01:41:05,315 --> 01:41:07,935
- I was just going to get the passkey.
- What for?

1164
01:41:08,067 --> 01:41:10,902
I thought I smelled gas
coming from your apartment.

1165
01:41:11,028 --> 01:41:13,069
Gas?!

1166
01:41:22,165 --> 01:41:24,204
Miss Kubelik?

1167
01:41:26,084 --> 01:41:28,124
Miss Kubelik!

1168
01:41:30,839 --> 01:41:32,879
- You all right?
- Sure!

1169
01:41:33,800 --> 01:41:36,964
- What's that funny smell?
- Gas! Didn't you turn it on?

1170
01:41:37,094 --> 01:41:40,094
Yes, to boil water to get
the coffee stains out of my dress.

1171
01:41:40,222 --> 01:41:43,638
- You turned it on but you didn't light it.
- Are you supposed to?

1172
01:41:43,767 --> 01:41:47,598
In this house you're supposed to.
Hey, what are you doing with that?

1173
01:41:47,729 --> 01:41:51,180
I was washing my stockings,
so I thought I'd wash your socks too.

1174
01:41:51,315 --> 01:41:55,480
- Oh. Thank you.
- Very curious. I could only find 3 pair.

1175
01:41:55,612 --> 01:41:58,103
Things are a little disorganised
around here.

1176
01:41:58,238 --> 01:42:02,106
I'd say. What's a tennis racket
doing in the kitchen?

1177
01:42:02,242 --> 01:42:07,154
Tennis racket? Oh, I remember.
I was cooking myself an ltalian dinner.

1178
01:42:07,289 --> 01:42:10,040
I used it to strain the spaghetti.

1179
01:42:10,166 --> 01:42:12,741
- Why not?
- In fact, I'm a pretty good cook.

1180
01:42:12,878 --> 01:42:15,665
- Only I'm a lousy housekeeper.
- Yes, you are.

1181
01:42:15,798 --> 01:42:20,210
When I was straightening up the couch,
I found six hairpins, a lipstick,...

1182
01:42:20,343 --> 01:42:24,006
..a pair of false eyelashes and
a swizzle stick from the Stork Club.

1183
01:42:24,136 --> 01:42:27,473
It's just that I'm the kind of guy
who can't say no.

1184
01:42:27,601 --> 01:42:31,679
- I don't mean to girls. I mean...
- To someone like Mr. Sheldrake.

1185
01:42:31,813 --> 01:42:34,895
- I guess so.
- I know so.

1186
01:42:36,608 --> 01:42:39,062
- He's a taker.
- What?

1187
01:42:39,652 --> 01:42:41,895
Some people take, some people get took.

1188
01:42:42,030 --> 01:42:46,074
And they know they're gettin' took
and there's nothin' they can do about it.

1189
01:42:46,200 --> 01:42:48,240
I wouldn't say that.

1190
01:42:48,996 --> 01:42:51,034
What would you like for dinner, huh?

1191
01:42:51,164 --> 01:42:54,367
Hey. Onion soup, and canned asparagus...

1192
01:42:54,501 --> 01:42:56,539
I really should be getting home.

1193
01:42:56,668 --> 01:42:59,670
- My family'll be flipping by now.
- You can't leave yet.

1194
01:42:59,797 --> 01:43:04,174
The doctor said it takes 48 hours
to get that stuff out of your system.

1195
01:43:05,261 --> 01:43:09,554
How long does it take to get someone
you're stuck on out of your system?

1196
01:43:09,681 --> 01:43:12,635
If only they'd invent
some kind of pump for that.

1197
01:43:12,767 --> 01:43:18,390
I know how you feel, Miss Kubelik. You
think it's the end of the world. But it's not.

1198
01:43:18,522 --> 01:43:21,096
I went through exactly
the same thing myself.

1199
01:43:21,233 --> 01:43:23,190
- You did?
- Well, not exactly the same.

1200
01:43:23,319 --> 01:43:25,061
I tried to do it with a gun.

1201
01:43:25,194 --> 01:43:28,313
- Over a girl?
- Worse. It was the wife of my best friend.

1202
01:43:28,446 --> 01:43:33,488
And I was mad about her. But I knew
it was hopeless and I decided to end it all.

1203
01:43:33,618 --> 01:43:37,747
I went to a pawnshop and I bought a .45
automatic and I drove up to Eden Park...

1204
01:43:37,873 --> 01:43:39,995
- Do you know Cincinnati?
- No, I don't.

1205
01:43:40,124 --> 01:43:42,795
Anyway, I parked the car
and I loaded that gun...

1206
01:43:42,920 --> 01:43:47,297
You read in the papers that people shoot
themselves. Believe me, it's not that easy.

1207
01:43:47,423 --> 01:43:51,041
I mean, how do you do it?
Here? Here? Here?

1208
01:43:52,428 --> 01:43:55,097
- Know where I finally shot myself?
- Where?

1209
01:43:55,222 --> 01:43:57,131
- Here.
- In the knee?!

1210
01:43:57,265 --> 01:43:59,804
Yeah! I was sittin' there, tryin' to decide.

1211
01:43:59,935 --> 01:44:02,307
A cop came up because
I was illegally parked.

1212
01:44:02,437 --> 01:44:05,805
I tried to hide the gun
under the seat and it went off.

1213
01:44:05,940 --> 01:44:09,607
- That's terrible!
- It was a year till I could bend the knee.

1214
01:44:09,737 --> 01:44:12,856
But I got over the girl in three weeks.

1215
01:44:14,407 --> 01:44:18,191
Still lives in Cincinnati.
Has four kids and gained 20 pounds.

1216
01:44:18,328 --> 01:44:20,735
Sends me a fruitcake every Christmas.

1217
01:44:20,870 --> 01:44:23,327
Are you just making this up
to make me feel better?

1218
01:44:23,458 --> 01:44:25,497
Of course not! Here's the fruitcake.

1219
01:44:25,626 --> 01:44:27,833
- Do you wanna see my knee?
- No, thank you.

1220
01:44:27,962 --> 01:44:31,247
The fellas in the office might
get the wrong idea how I found out.

1221
01:44:31,381 --> 01:44:35,509
Let 'em! Look, I'm gonna cook dinner
for us. We'll have fruitcake for dessert.

1222
01:44:35,635 --> 01:44:38,884
You just sit there and rest.
You've done enough for today.

1223
01:44:39,012 --> 01:44:42,264
- Yes, Nurse.
- (Baxter hums opera music)

1224
01:44:57,092 --> 01:45:00,340
- Can I help you?
- I'm lookin' for Miss Kubelik.

1225
01:45:00,470 --> 01:45:05,677
- So am I. She didn't report this morning.
- She didn't? Who's in charge here?

1226
01:45:05,809 --> 01:45:10,185
That comes under General Office
Administration. Mr. Dobisch, 21st floor.

1227
01:45:10,312 --> 01:45:12,054
Thanks.

1228
01:45:14,566 --> 01:45:19,062
So I take Sylvia up to the apartment, and
guess who he's stashed in the bedroom.

1229
01:45:19,195 --> 01:45:20,476
- Who?
- Kubelik.

1230
01:45:20,613 --> 01:45:23,732
No kiddin'? Buddy-boy and Kubelik
having a little toot?

1231
01:45:23,866 --> 01:45:28,363
Toot? More like a lost weekend.
Neither of 'em showed up for work today.

1232
01:45:28,496 --> 01:45:30,155
AWOL, hm?

1233
01:45:30,289 --> 01:45:32,862
What gripes me is
they guzzled my champagne...

1234
01:45:32,999 --> 01:45:36,533
..while Sylvia and I wound up
at the Guggenheim Museum.

1235
01:45:38,213 --> 01:45:40,252
- Mr. Dobisch?
- Yeah.

1236
01:45:41,300 --> 01:45:45,510
I'm Karl Matuschka. My sister-in-law
runs one of the elevators. Fran Kubelik.

1237
01:45:45,636 --> 01:45:47,130
- Miss Kubelik?
- You know her?

1238
01:45:47,263 --> 01:45:51,131
Of course. We have a lot of employees,
but we're one big, happy family.

1239
01:45:51,267 --> 01:45:56,392
She lives with us, and my wife's nervous
cos Fran hasn't been home for two days.

1240
01:45:56,522 --> 01:45:57,897
That so?

1241
01:45:58,023 --> 01:46:01,106
So we wondered if somebody here
knew what happened to her.

1242
01:46:01,233 --> 01:46:02,694
I see.

1243
01:46:02,820 --> 01:46:06,437
What do you think, Al?
Can we help the man?

1244
01:46:06,571 --> 01:46:09,988
Why not? We don't owe
Buddy-boy anything.

1245
01:46:10,118 --> 01:46:13,617
Yeah. What's Buddy-boy
done for us lately?

1246
01:46:15,789 --> 01:46:18,161
Who is Buddy-boy?

1247
01:46:19,459 --> 01:46:21,499
(Hums opera music)

1248
01:46:42,356 --> 01:46:46,222
- Are we dressing for dinner?
- No. Just come as you are.

1249
01:46:46,358 --> 01:46:50,487
- You're pretty good with that racket.
- You should see my backhand.

1250
01:46:52,531 --> 01:46:55,532
Wait till you see me serve the meatballs.

1251
01:46:55,659 --> 01:46:59,739
- Shall I light the candles?
- It's a must, gracious living-wise.

1252
01:46:59,871 --> 01:47:01,912
(Hums opera music)

1253
01:47:02,958 --> 01:47:04,368
# Meatball

1254
01:47:04,500 --> 01:47:06,540
(Hums)

1255
01:47:08,130 --> 01:47:09,753
Meatball

1256
01:47:09,880 --> 01:47:11,921
(Baxter continues humming)

1257
01:47:20,546 --> 01:47:23,547
- You bought some napkins.
- Might as well go all the way.

1258
01:47:23,674 --> 01:47:25,713
(Baxter hums)

1259
01:47:26,969 --> 01:47:29,376
You know, I used to live
like Robinson Crusoe.

1260
01:47:29,513 --> 01:47:31,753
Shipwrecked, among eight million people.

1261
01:47:31,889 --> 01:47:35,056
And then one day I saw
a footprint in the sand...

1262
01:47:35,184 --> 01:47:37,224
..and there you were.

1263
01:47:38,146 --> 01:47:40,387
It's a wonderful thing, dinner for two.

1264
01:47:40,522 --> 01:47:44,390
- Do you usually eat alone?
- No. Sometimes I eat with Ed Sullivan.

1265
01:47:44,527 --> 01:47:47,362
Or sometimes Dinah Shore
or Perry Como.

1266
01:47:47,488 --> 01:47:51,486
The other night it was Mae West.
She was much younger then. Cheers.

1267
01:47:51,618 --> 01:47:54,450
- Cheers.
- Know what we're gonna do after dinner?

1268
01:47:54,619 --> 01:47:56,695
- The dishes.
- I mean after that.

1269
01:47:56,830 --> 01:47:59,119
- What?
- You don't have to if you don't want to.

1270
01:47:59,249 --> 01:48:01,655
- Oh, I don't?
- We're gonna finish the gin game.

1271
01:48:01,792 --> 01:48:04,461
- So keep a clear head.
- (Doorbell)

1272
01:48:05,296 --> 01:48:09,339
Cos I don't wanna take advantage of you,
the way I did yesterday in bed.

1273
01:48:09,465 --> 01:48:11,588
- Baxter?
- Yes.

1274
01:48:20,727 --> 01:48:23,431
What's with you, Fran?
Did you forget where you live?

1275
01:48:23,563 --> 01:48:27,263
- My brother-in-law, Karl Matuschka.
- Oh! How do you do, Mr. Matusch...

1276
01:48:27,400 --> 01:48:31,811
- Get dressed. I got the cab downstairs.
- Wait. I know what you're thinking, but...

1277
01:48:31,944 --> 01:48:34,733
It's none of my business
what you do. You're over 21.

1278
01:48:34,865 --> 01:48:38,482
- But your sister thinks you're a lady.
- All we were gonna do was eat!

1279
01:48:38,618 --> 01:48:41,109
If there wasn't a lady present,
I'd clobber you.

1280
01:48:41,245 --> 01:48:44,116
All right, Karl! I'll get dressed.

1281
01:48:53,339 --> 01:48:55,379
Want a martini?

1282
01:48:59,388 --> 01:49:03,254
How about some spaghetti
with meat sauce that I cooked myself?

1283
01:49:08,770 --> 01:49:11,557
Your sister-in-law sure is terrific.

1284
01:49:14,818 --> 01:49:19,361
It must be murder drivin' a cab
in New York with the cross-town traffic.

1285
01:49:19,489 --> 01:49:21,529
(Door opens)

1286
01:49:23,826 --> 01:49:25,865
Hi, Baxter. How's the patient?

1287
01:49:25,996 --> 01:49:27,988
Oh, uh... I'm fine, Doc.

1288
01:49:28,124 --> 01:49:30,161
Not you. Miss Kubelik.

1289
01:49:30,915 --> 01:49:35,874
- What's the matter with Miss Kubelik?
- This is Mr. Matuschka. He's... got a cab.

1290
01:49:36,005 --> 01:49:38,460
- Fran been sick?
- No. Just a little accident.

1291
01:49:38,591 --> 01:49:42,540
- What does he mean, accident?
- Well... these things happen all the time.

1292
01:49:42,678 --> 01:49:44,836
What things? What kind
of a doctor are you?

1293
01:49:44,972 --> 01:49:48,175
Not that kind! He just gave her
a shot, pumped out her stomach.

1294
01:49:48,308 --> 01:49:51,511
- What for?
- I took sleeping pills. But I'm fine now.

1295
01:49:51,644 --> 01:49:54,217
- Why'd you take sleeping pills?
- On account of me.

1296
01:49:54,354 --> 01:49:56,394
You?

1297
01:49:56,523 --> 01:49:58,315
Who else?

1298
01:50:03,196 --> 01:50:05,236
Leave him alone!

1299
01:50:07,617 --> 01:50:10,903
Oh, you fool. You damn fool.

1300
01:50:13,039 --> 01:50:16,124
- (Karl) Come on, Fran.
- Goodbye, Mr. Baxter.

1301
01:50:22,090 --> 01:50:24,128
Goodbye, Doctor.

1302
01:50:26,052 --> 01:50:30,796
Well, I don't wanna gloat, but
just between us, you had it coming to you.

1303
01:50:31,514 --> 01:50:32,973
(Tuts)

1304
01:50:33,099 --> 01:50:36,017
You're gonna have a shiner tomorrow.

1305
01:50:36,144 --> 01:50:37,972
Let me get my bag.

1306
01:50:40,105 --> 01:50:42,146
Don't bother, Doc.

1307
01:50:42,275 --> 01:50:44,315
It doesn't hurt a bit.

1308
01:51:06,130 --> 01:51:08,454
Mr. Sheldrake's office? This is CC Baxter.

1309
01:51:08,590 --> 01:51:11,841
Please tell him I'd like to
come up and see him. It's important.

1310
01:51:11,969 --> 01:51:14,008
Will you call me back, please?

1311
01:51:16,806 --> 01:51:19,843
Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news for you.

1312
01:51:21,061 --> 01:51:23,100
All your troubles are over.

1313
01:51:24,313 --> 01:51:27,147
I'm gonna take Miss Kubelik
off your hands.

1314
01:51:27,983 --> 01:51:30,440
The plain fact is, I love her.

1315
01:51:31,361 --> 01:51:33,935
I thought you should be the first to know.

1316
01:51:34,072 --> 01:51:36,991
After all, you don't really
want her, and I do.

1317
01:51:37,118 --> 01:51:41,245
And though it may sound presumptuous,
she needs somebody like me.

1318
01:51:41,371 --> 01:51:44,822
- So I think it would be best all around.
- (Phone rings)

1319
01:51:44,958 --> 01:51:46,415
Solution-wise.

1320
01:51:46,542 --> 01:51:47,823
Yes?

1321
01:51:47,961 --> 01:51:50,118
I'll be right up.

1322
01:51:50,253 --> 01:51:53,624
Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news for you.

1323
01:51:53,758 --> 01:51:55,797
All your troubles are over.

1324
01:52:00,097 --> 01:52:02,338
19.

1325
01:52:02,474 --> 01:52:06,174
- Hi, Buddy-boy. What happened to you?
- Hit by a swinging door?

1326
01:52:06,310 --> 01:52:09,228
- Or a yellow cab?
- That guy really must've belted him.

1327
01:52:09,355 --> 01:52:12,559
Yeah. He's punchy. Talking to himself.

1328
01:52:12,817 --> 01:52:14,192
27.

1329
01:52:14,318 --> 01:52:16,773
Those two days
she spent in the apartment...

1330
01:52:16,903 --> 01:52:19,905
..made me realise
how lonely I'd been before.

1331
01:52:20,032 --> 01:52:23,566
But, thanks to you, I'm
in a financial position to marry her.

1332
01:52:23,701 --> 01:52:26,738
If I can ever square things with her family.

1333
01:52:26,872 --> 01:52:29,279
Good morning. CC Baxter.

1334
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,122
(Intercom buzzer)

1335
01:52:33,252 --> 01:52:35,292
- Mr. Baxter is here.
- Send him in.

1336
01:52:37,548 --> 01:52:40,466
Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news for you.

1337
01:52:40,593 --> 01:52:42,715
And I've got good news for you, Baxter.

1338
01:52:42,844 --> 01:52:45,134
- All your troubles are over.
- Sir?

1339
01:52:45,474 --> 01:52:48,674
I know how worried you were
about Miss Kubelik. Stop worrying.

1340
01:52:48,809 --> 01:52:51,679
I'm going to take her off your hands.

1341
01:52:51,811 --> 01:52:54,729
- You're gonna take her off my hands?
- That's right.

1342
01:52:54,856 --> 01:52:57,312
I've moved out of the house.

1343
01:52:58,275 --> 01:53:01,276
I'm gonna be staying in town,
at the Athletic Club.

1344
01:53:01,403 --> 01:53:04,405
- You left your wife.
- If you must know, I fired my secretary.

1345
01:53:04,532 --> 01:53:09,358
My secretary got to my wife, and my wife
fired me. Ain't that a kick in the head?

1346
01:53:09,493 --> 01:53:11,036
Yeah.

1347
01:53:11,162 --> 01:53:13,072
Now what's your news, Baxter?

1348
01:53:15,250 --> 01:53:18,998
It's about Miss Kubelik. She's feeling
all right again so she went home.

1349
01:53:19,128 --> 01:53:22,213
Swell. And don't think
I've forgotten what you did for me.

1350
01:53:22,340 --> 01:53:24,379
This way, Baxter.

1351
01:53:27,803 --> 01:53:30,176
Sit down. Try it on for size.

1352
01:53:31,222 --> 01:53:33,761
- You like? It's all yours.
- Mine?

1353
01:53:33,892 --> 01:53:39,099
My assistant has been shifted to the
Denver office and you're taking his place.

1354
01:53:39,230 --> 01:53:41,685
What's the matter?
You don't seem very excited.

1355
01:53:41,817 --> 01:53:46,062
Well, it's just that so many things
have been happening so fast.

1356
01:53:46,196 --> 01:53:48,982
I'm very pleased.
Especially for Miss Kubelik.

1357
01:53:49,114 --> 01:53:54,108
I think she's the kind of girl that definitely
ought to be married to... someone.

1358
01:53:54,244 --> 01:53:59,749
Sure, sure. But first the property has to be
settled. Then it takes six weeks in Reno.

1359
01:53:59,875 --> 01:54:02,791
Meanwhile I'm going to enjoy
being a bachelor for a while.

1360
01:54:02,918 --> 01:54:06,370
Oh, Baxter, you now can have lunch
in the executive dining room.

1361
01:54:06,506 --> 01:54:09,175
That's one of the privileges
that goes with this job.

1362
01:54:09,300 --> 01:54:13,926
You also get a nice little expense account,
use of the executive washroom...

1363
01:54:14,055 --> 01:54:16,461
Say, what happened to you, Baxter?

1364
01:54:16,597 --> 01:54:19,302
- I got kicked in the head too.
- Oh?

1365
01:54:40,411 --> 01:54:42,534
Good evening, Mr. Baxter.

1366
01:54:42,664 --> 01:54:44,159
Oh.

1367
01:54:44,291 --> 01:54:47,077
Miss Kubelik. How are you feeling?

1368
01:54:47,209 --> 01:54:49,915
- I feel fine. How's your eye?
- Oh, fine.

1369
01:54:50,047 --> 01:54:52,881
- How are things at the apartment?
- Nothing's changed.

1370
01:54:53,007 --> 01:54:55,962
- We never did finish that gin game.
- I know.

1371
01:54:57,678 --> 01:55:00,051
I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake.

1372
01:55:00,181 --> 01:55:02,752
Leaving his wife? Yeah.
I'm very happy for you.

1373
01:55:02,891 --> 01:55:05,466
- I never thought he'd do it.
- I told you all along.

1374
01:55:05,603 --> 01:55:09,136
- You were wrong about Mr. Sheldrake.
- I guess so.

1375
01:55:09,272 --> 01:55:11,311
You were wrong about me too.

1376
01:55:11,441 --> 01:55:14,608
What you said about those who take
and those who get took.

1377
01:55:14,736 --> 01:55:17,938
Mr. Sheldrake wasn't using me.
I was using him. See?

1378
01:55:18,071 --> 01:55:22,569
Last month I was at desk 861 on
the 19th floor. Now I'm on the 27th floor.

1379
01:55:22,702 --> 01:55:24,740
A panelled office, three windows.

1380
01:55:24,869 --> 01:55:27,907
So it all worked out fine.
We're both getting what we wanted.

1381
01:55:28,041 --> 01:55:30,957
Yes. Will you walk me to the subway?

1382
01:55:31,083 --> 01:55:36,754
No, thank you. Well, I... To tell you the
truth, I have this heavy date for tonight.

1383
01:55:40,258 --> 01:55:43,628
- Aren't you meeting Mr. Sheldrake?
- No. You know how people talk.

1384
01:55:43,763 --> 01:55:49,053
I decided it was best not to see each other
until everything was settled, divorce-wise.

1385
01:55:49,184 --> 01:55:51,224
That's very wise.

1386
01:55:52,354 --> 01:55:54,810
- Good night, Mr. Baxter.
- Good night.

1387
01:56:30,848 --> 01:56:34,216
- Baxter, could you step in here a minute?
- Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.

1388
01:56:34,352 --> 01:56:36,390
- There you are.
- Much obliged.

1389
01:56:38,272 --> 01:56:44,107
Here are the figures on staff turnover. 37%
of females leave to get married and 22%...

1390
01:56:44,235 --> 01:56:47,189
Baxter, you work too hard.
It's New Year's Eve. Relax!

1391
01:56:47,322 --> 01:56:50,322
- Yes, sir.
- I suppose you'll be celebrating tonight.

1392
01:56:50,450 --> 01:56:52,574
- Naturally.
- I'm taking Miss Kubelik out.

1393
01:56:52,744 --> 01:56:54,818
- I finally talked her into it.
- I see.

1394
01:56:54,953 --> 01:56:59,331
The only thing is, I'm staying at the
Athletic Club and it's strictly stag, so...

1395
01:56:59,458 --> 01:57:01,580
If you don't mind?

1396
01:57:02,377 --> 01:57:05,911
- Don't mind what?
- You know my key to your apartment?

1397
01:57:06,047 --> 01:57:09,296
When we had that little scare
about Miss Kubelik,...

1398
01:57:09,425 --> 01:57:13,422
- ..I threw it out the window of the train.
- Very clever.

1399
01:57:13,554 --> 01:57:15,843
So now I'll have to borrow your key.

1400
01:57:17,349 --> 01:57:20,185
- Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake.
- What do you mean, sorry?

1401
01:57:20,311 --> 01:57:22,718
You're not bringing anybody
to my apartment.

1402
01:57:22,854 --> 01:57:27,231
- It's not just anybody. It's Miss Kubelik.
- Especially not Miss Kubelik.

1403
01:57:27,358 --> 01:57:30,561
- How's that again?
- No key.

1404
01:57:32,446 --> 01:57:37,073
Baxter, I picked you for my team because
I thought you were a bright young man.

1405
01:57:37,200 --> 01:57:40,652
Do you realise what you're doing?
Not to me, but to yourself?

1406
01:57:40,788 --> 01:57:44,157
Normally it takes years
to work your way up to the 27th floor.

1407
01:57:44,291 --> 01:57:47,328
But it only takes 30 seconds
to be out on the street again.

1408
01:57:47,461 --> 01:57:50,033
- You dig?
- I dig.

1409
01:57:51,214 --> 01:57:53,253
So what's it going to be?

1410
01:58:00,055 --> 01:58:03,139
- Now you're being bright.
- Thank you, sir.

1411
01:58:20,575 --> 01:58:23,279
- Baxter, you gave me the wrong key.
- No, I didn't.

1412
01:58:23,411 --> 01:58:26,080
But this is the key
to the executive washroom.

1413
01:58:26,205 --> 01:58:29,989
That's right. I won't be needing it
because I'm all washed up around here.

1414
01:58:30,127 --> 01:58:33,541
- What's gotten into you?
- Just following doctor's orders.

1415
01:58:33,670 --> 01:58:37,917
I've decided to become a mensch.
Know what that means? A human being.

1416
01:58:38,049 --> 01:58:41,998
- Now hold on, Baxter.
- The old payola won't work any more.

1417
01:58:42,136 --> 01:58:44,176
Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.

1418
01:59:13,832 --> 01:59:15,871
(Doorbell)

1419
01:59:19,796 --> 01:59:23,746
- We're having a party and ran out of ice.
- Sure, Doc.

1420
01:59:23,883 --> 01:59:26,006
How come you're alone
on New Year's Eve?

1421
01:59:26,135 --> 01:59:28,093
Well, I got things to do.

1422
01:59:28,221 --> 01:59:32,431
- What's this? You're packing?
- Yeah. I'm giving up the apartment.

1423
01:59:32,557 --> 01:59:34,433
Where are you moving to?

1424
01:59:34,561 --> 01:59:37,597
I don't know. All I know is
I gotta get outta this place.

1425
01:59:37,730 --> 01:59:39,770
Sorry to lose you, Baxter.

1426
01:59:39,899 --> 01:59:44,643
Me? Oh, my body. Don't worry, it'll go to
the university, Doc. I'll put it in writing.

1427
01:59:44,778 --> 01:59:47,979
- Could you use some champagne?
- Booze we don't need.

1428
01:59:48,114 --> 01:59:49,941
Say, why don't you join us?

1429
01:59:50,074 --> 01:59:55,068
We got two brain surgeons, a proctologist
and three nurses from Bellevue.

1430
01:59:55,203 --> 01:59:57,161
No, thanks. I don't feel like it.

1431
01:59:57,289 --> 02:00:01,536
In case I don't see you again, how much
do I owe you for taking care of that girl?

1432
02:00:01,668 --> 02:00:05,536
Forget it. I didn't do it as a doctor.
I did it as a neighbour.

1433
02:00:05,672 --> 02:00:08,341
By the way, whatever happened to her?

1434
02:00:09,633 --> 02:00:12,635
You know me with girls.
Easy come, easy go.

1435
02:00:12,762 --> 02:00:15,431
- Goodbye, Doc.
- Happy New Year.

1436
02:00:45,667 --> 02:00:46,994
(Lively music and chatter)

1437
02:00:58,763 --> 02:01:01,218
Sorry I took so long
on the phone. We're all set.

1438
02:01:01,348 --> 02:01:03,756
- For what?
- I rented a car. It'll be here at one.

1439
02:01:03,892 --> 02:01:06,763
- We're driving to Atlantic City.
- Atlantic City?

1440
02:01:06,895 --> 02:01:11,438
I know it's a drag, but you can't find
a hotel room in town on New Year's Eve.

1441
02:01:12,483 --> 02:01:15,355
Ring out the old year, ring in the new.

1442
02:01:15,487 --> 02:01:17,692
Ring-a-ding-ding.

1443
02:01:18,197 --> 02:01:21,568
I didn't plan it this way. It's Baxter's fault.

1444
02:01:21,702 --> 02:01:22,697
Baxter?

1445
02:01:22,827 --> 02:01:26,361
He wouldn't give me
the key to the apartment.

1446
02:01:26,497 --> 02:01:29,070
- He wouldn't?
- No. He just walked out on me. Quit.

1447
02:01:29,208 --> 02:01:32,244
Threw that big, fat job right in my face.

1448
02:01:33,669 --> 02:01:37,751
- The nerve.
- The little punk. After all I did for him.

1449
02:01:37,883 --> 02:01:42,259
Said I couldn't bring anybody to the
apartment, especially not Miss Kubelik.

1450
02:01:42,386 --> 02:01:45,174
What's he got against you, anyway?

1451
02:01:45,307 --> 02:01:51,178
I don't know. I guess that's the way
it crumbles, cookie-wise.

1452
02:01:53,230 --> 02:01:55,684
What are you talking about?

1453
02:01:56,690 --> 02:02:00,107
I'd spell it out for you, only I can't spell.

1454
02:02:05,116 --> 02:02:10,192
(All) # Should auld acquaintance be forgot

1455
02:02:10,329 --> 02:02:15,241
# And never brought to mind...

1456
02:02:16,584 --> 02:02:18,625
Happy New Year, Fran.

1457
02:02:20,714 --> 02:02:25,091
# And days of auld lang syne

1458
02:02:25,969 --> 02:02:31,129
# For auld lang syne, my dear

1459
02:02:31,266 --> 02:02:36,306
# For auld lang syne

1460
02:02:36,436 --> 02:02:41,597
# We'll drink a cup of kindness yet

1461
02:02:41,817 --> 02:02:47,404
# For auld lang syne

1462
02:02:47,863 --> 02:02:49,903
(Cheering)

1463
02:02:53,036 --> 02:02:55,075
(Horns and whistles)

1464
02:02:59,167 --> 02:03:01,205
Fran?

1465
02:03:02,503 --> 02:03:04,542
Where are you, Fran?

1466
02:03:20,310 --> 02:03:22,552
(Bang)

1467
02:03:22,689 --> 02:03:24,728
Mr. Baxter!

1468
02:03:25,023 --> 02:03:26,185
Mr. Baxter!

1469
02:03:26,565 --> 02:03:29,567
Mr. Baxter! Mr. Baxter!

1470
02:03:32,572 --> 02:03:33,901
Oh!

1471
02:03:34,032 --> 02:03:37,151
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

1472
02:03:37,284 --> 02:03:39,740
Are you sure? How's your knee?

1473
02:03:40,495 --> 02:03:42,535
I'm fine all over.

1474
02:03:44,583 --> 02:03:47,998
- Mind if I come in?
- Of course not.

1475
02:03:51,758 --> 02:03:53,796
Let me get another glass.

1476
02:03:56,761 --> 02:03:58,883
- Where are you going?
- Who knows?

1477
02:03:59,012 --> 02:04:02,347
Another neighborhood,
another town, another job.

1478
02:04:02,475 --> 02:04:04,800
I'm on my own.

1479
02:04:04,935 --> 02:04:06,975
That's funny. So am I.

1480
02:04:08,189 --> 02:04:10,476
What'd you do with the cards?

1481
02:04:10,607 --> 02:04:12,646
In there.

1482
02:04:23,995 --> 02:04:26,034
What about Mr. Sheldrake?

1483
02:04:26,163 --> 02:04:29,249
I'm gonna send him
a fruitcake every Christmas.

1484
02:04:31,709 --> 02:04:33,750
Cut.

1485
02:04:35,421 --> 02:04:37,461
I love you, Miss Kubelik.

1486
02:04:38,009 --> 02:04:39,835
Three.

1487
02:04:39,968 --> 02:04:41,166
Queen.

1488
02:04:41,302 --> 02:04:45,301
Did you hear what I said, Miss Kubelik?
I absolutely adore you.

1489
02:04:47,975 --> 02:04:50,015
Shut up and deal.
