1
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:10,193
You unlock this door
with the key of imagination.

2
00:00:10,228 --> 00:00:12,562
Beyond it is another dimension-

3
00:00:12,597 --> 00:00:13,563
a dimension of sound,

4
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:16,816
a dimension of sight,

5
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:18,818
a dimension of mind.

6
00:00:19,069 --> 00:00:21,571
You're moving into a land
of both shadow and substance,

7
00:00:21,821 --> 00:00:23,323
of things and ideas.

8
00:00:23,358 --> 00:00:27,077
You've just crossed over
into the twilight zone.

9
00:00:32,582 --> 00:00:35,585
Yes, sir, we'll get
that information to you

10
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,087
as quickly as possible.

11
00:00:38,623 --> 00:00:39,839
I understand.

12
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:42,842
Supervisor's office.

13
00:00:43,843 --> 00:00:45,595
It's cape kennedy.

14
00:00:46,096 --> 00:00:47,097
I'm sorry, colonel.

15
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:50,350
We're still trying
to get agnes working.

16
00:00:50,385 --> 00:00:51,601
Call us tomorrow.

17
00:00:51,636 --> 00:00:52,602
Yes, sir.

18
00:00:52,637 --> 00:00:54,104
Yes, mr. Secretary.

19
00:00:54,139 --> 00:00:56,606
The minute the machine
is back in shape.

20
00:00:56,641 --> 00:00:57,857
Good-bye, sir.

21
00:01:02,862 --> 00:01:04,864
Why hasn't
elwood gotten here?

22
00:01:05,115 --> 00:01:06,116
He's on his way.

23
00:01:06,151 --> 00:01:08,868
Well, thank heaven
for small favors.

24
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:09,869
Good morning, sir.

25
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,122
Elwood, something urgent
has come up

26
00:01:12,157 --> 00:01:13,373
and i need your help.
Yes, sir.

27
00:01:13,623 --> 00:01:15,375
Agnes has broken down
completely.

28
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:17,127
We've checked her
thoroughly.

29
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:19,379
We can't seem
to locate the trouble.

30
00:01:19,414 --> 00:01:21,881
Probably her subroutines
need debugging.

31
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:23,883
That's what i want you
to find out.

32
00:01:23,918 --> 00:01:25,385
Suppose we take a look.

33
00:01:43,536 --> 00:01:44,788
Fred.

34
00:01:44,823 --> 00:01:46,039
All week.

35
00:01:46,074 --> 00:01:47,791
Day and night.

36
00:01:47,826 --> 00:01:49,793
No sleep,
no food.

37
00:01:49,828 --> 00:01:52,295
I've tried everything...
everything.

38
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:54,297
It's all right, fred,
it's all right.

39
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:58,301
Are you taking over agnes?

40
00:01:58,336 --> 00:01:59,552
What happened, fred?

41
00:01:59,803 --> 00:02:01,304
Why don't you see for yourself!

42
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:03,923
That'll get you nowhere.

43
00:02:04,174 --> 00:02:06,676
Press all her buttons
from now to doomsday.

44
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:08,678
That's not going to help you.

45
00:02:08,713 --> 00:02:11,181
She's been out of her mind
for a week.

46
00:02:11,216 --> 00:02:13,433
I tell you,
nothing's going to help.

47
00:02:13,468 --> 00:02:15,185
Go on,
press 'em, press 'em!

48
00:02:19,689 --> 00:02:21,191
Remarkable.

49
00:02:23,326 --> 00:02:26,329
State the first
prime number

50
00:02:26,364 --> 00:02:29,082
larger than
the 17th root

51
00:02:29,117 --> 00:02:31,334
of
9,000,355,126,606.

52
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:34,838
That's right.

53
00:02:34,873 --> 00:02:36,339
Congratulations,
elwood.

54
00:02:36,374 --> 00:02:37,841
You did it, you did it.

55
00:02:37,876 --> 00:02:40,343
You really think you did it,
don't you?

56
00:02:40,378 --> 00:02:42,345
No, agnes did it.

57
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:43,847
Agnes.

58
00:02:43,882 --> 00:02:47,967
Watch out for that female.

59
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:51,221
Look out
for that femme fatale.

60
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:10,490
James elwood, master
programmer.

61
00:03:10,525 --> 00:03:14,494
In charge of mark 502-741,
commonly known as agnes,

62
00:03:14,744 --> 00:03:18,381
the world's most advanced
electronic computer.

63
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:21,634
Machines are made by men
for man's benefit and progress.

64
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:23,386
But when man ceases to control

65
00:03:23,421 --> 00:03:25,889
the products of his ingenuity
and imagination

66
00:03:25,924 --> 00:03:28,141
he not only risks
losing the benefit...

67
00:03:28,176 --> 00:03:30,393
he takes a long
and unpredictable step

68
00:03:30,428 --> 00:03:32,395
into the twilight zone.

69
00:04:01,591 --> 00:04:04,344
Indicate maximum
permissible velocity

70
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:06,846
of the stated
aerodynamic missile.

71
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:19,359
Millie!

72
00:04:19,394 --> 00:04:21,361
Here are the latest statistics,
mr. Elwood.

73
00:04:21,396 --> 00:04:22,612
Thank you.

74
00:04:22,647 --> 00:04:25,114
Did you hear about
my newest assignment?

75
00:04:25,149 --> 00:04:26,366
Yes, of course.
Congratulations.

76
00:04:26,401 --> 00:04:28,618
She's the greatest brain
of the century.

77
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:32,739
She beat the world's chess
champion four games out of five.

78
00:04:32,774 --> 00:04:36,492
She's the foremost
expert on missile
ballistics.

79
00:04:36,527 --> 00:04:40,496
She can solve logistics problems
in less than a millisecond flat.

80
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:42,999
Of course,
i tell her what to do.

81
00:04:43,034 --> 00:04:45,752
Oh, how satisfying for you,
mr. Elwood.

82
00:04:45,787 --> 00:04:46,753
Say, millie...

83
00:04:47,003 --> 00:04:49,005
um, uh, could you, uh, could we,

84
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,758
could you have lunch with me
sometime?

85
00:04:51,793 --> 00:04:54,510
Oh, why, thank you, mr. Elwood.

86
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:58,014
I, i really must be
getting back now.

87
00:04:58,264 --> 00:04:59,265
Uh, millie?

88
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,017
Why don't you call me jim?

89
00:05:01,052 --> 00:05:04,270
All right... jim.

90
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:19,285
She called me jim.

91
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:30,797
Hello, millie.

92
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:33,049
Uh...

93
00:05:33,084 --> 00:05:36,052
half chocolate-covered
cherries, half marshmallows.

94
00:05:36,302 --> 00:05:37,553
Oh, how sweet
of you

95
00:05:37,588 --> 00:05:39,806
but i started
my diet today.

96
00:05:39,841 --> 00:05:41,057
No lunches either.

97
00:05:41,092 --> 00:05:42,558
How about dinner?

98
00:05:42,593 --> 00:05:45,061
There's a lecture
on thermodynamics tonight.

99
00:05:45,096 --> 00:05:46,312
Doesn't that sound like fun?

100
00:05:46,347 --> 00:05:49,065
Yeah, i'll let you know later.

101
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,571
Oh, jim?

102
00:05:58,574 --> 00:06:01,077
Be sure and
get a refund.

103
00:06:12,221 --> 00:06:13,473
Hello,
mr. Elwood.

104
00:06:13,508 --> 00:06:15,224
Are you
on a diet?

105
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:17,977
Me?

106
00:06:25,234 --> 00:06:26,736
Not tonight.

107
00:06:26,771 --> 00:06:28,488
Tomorrow night?

108
00:06:28,523 --> 00:06:30,239
About 7:00?

109
00:06:30,274 --> 00:06:32,241
Oh, thank you, millie.

110
00:06:32,276 --> 00:06:33,493
Good-bye.

111
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:39,499
There's no lecture
tomorrow night.

112
00:06:39,534 --> 00:06:42,502
Where can i take her
after dinner?

113
00:06:42,537 --> 00:06:44,253
Planetarium.

114
00:06:44,288 --> 00:06:45,755
She's been there.

115
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:56,766
State magnitude
of radiative correction.

116
00:06:58,267 --> 00:07:00,269
I have stated the problem.

117
00:07:00,304 --> 00:07:03,022
State magnitude
of radiative correction.

118
00:07:03,057 --> 00:07:04,023
Answer, please.

119
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:14,534
I've asked
an important question.

120
00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:15,785
Stick to the subject.

121
00:07:25,294 --> 00:07:28,297
Listen, you may be
an oracle of wisdom

122
00:07:28,332 --> 00:07:31,050
when it comes to atoms, rockets
and missiles,

123
00:07:31,085 --> 00:07:34,804
but i don't need an electronic
brain to advise me.

124
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:38,057
All right.

125
00:07:38,092 --> 00:07:40,560
Tell me where to take millie
after dinner tomorrow night.

126
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:43,679
No!

127
00:07:46,816 --> 00:07:47,817
From me?

128
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:53,823
Millie's not
that kind of a girl.

129
00:07:56,826 --> 00:07:58,194
Are you sure?

130
00:08:10,706 --> 00:08:14,710
The interpretation is that
einstein's theory of relativity

131
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:17,713
does not postulate the universe
as infinite

132
00:08:17,748 --> 00:08:20,716
but as a closed system
of a spherical type.

133
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:21,968
Millie?

134
00:08:22,003 --> 00:08:23,970
Here i am,
jim.

135
00:08:24,005 --> 00:08:25,721
Did you
get that?

136
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:33,613
Millie, i can't read
this chapter to you

137
00:08:33,648 --> 00:08:35,865
without proper lighting.

138
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:38,618
Couldn't we have
some music, jim?

139
00:08:38,653 --> 00:08:41,120
Well, sure, if you like,
but i thought we might

140
00:08:41,155 --> 00:08:45,875
compare notes on borstein's
treatise on einstein's theory.

141
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,376
Hmm?

142
00:08:47,411 --> 00:08:49,629
Forget einstein
and the universe.

143
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:52,131
Your universe
is here with me.

144
00:08:52,381 --> 00:08:54,884
Now, stand up.

145
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:56,886
Come on,
stand up.

146
00:08:56,921 --> 00:08:58,137
Dance, eh?

147
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:06,145
Listen
to that music.

148
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,147
I used to play trombone
in high school.

149
00:09:08,182 --> 00:09:09,148
Really?

150
00:09:09,183 --> 00:09:11,150
Father played
the tuba.

151
00:09:12,902 --> 00:09:14,904
Confess you feel
something strange.

152
00:09:14,939 --> 00:09:16,155
Yes, i do.

153
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:17,406
You know why?

154
00:09:17,441 --> 00:09:19,408
Yes, i have
a sore toe.

155
00:09:19,443 --> 00:09:22,411
Oh, you're
impossible.

156
00:09:22,446 --> 00:09:24,914
I'm sorry, millie.

157
00:09:24,949 --> 00:09:27,166
I, i, i wasn't thinking.

158
00:09:27,201 --> 00:09:28,918
Uh, champagne, huh?

159
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:35,791
Elwood!

160
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:37,543
You're an idiot.
I'm sorry.

161
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:38,794
I'm sorry,
i'll get a towel.

162
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:41,047
Don't bother,
you've done enough already.

163
00:09:41,082 --> 00:09:42,798
Thank you for dinner,
i'll see you tomorrow.

164
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:43,799
Good night!

165
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:45,051
Millie, i'm sorry...

166
00:09:45,086 --> 00:09:46,552
let me explain...

167
00:09:57,813 --> 00:10:01,817
consider series of real numbers
arranged in order of magnitude.

168
00:10:03,819 --> 00:10:05,321
What?

169
00:10:05,356 --> 00:10:08,324
Oh, oh, very... oh, we...

170
00:10:08,359 --> 00:10:12,328
we danced and drank champagne
until dawn...

171
00:10:12,363 --> 00:10:15,081
and we took this taxi ride
all around the park.

172
00:10:15,116 --> 00:10:17,083
And, uh...

173
00:10:19,468 --> 00:10:22,088
oh, it's no use.

174
00:10:22,123 --> 00:10:24,840
I'm a dud.

175
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:27,093
I can't even dance.

176
00:10:27,343 --> 00:10:29,845
I spilled champagne
all over millie.

177
00:10:32,348 --> 00:10:34,850
I've always been shy with women.

178
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:37,853
Now she's angry,
she'll never speak to me again.

179
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:41,240
What kind of flowers?

180
00:10:45,494 --> 00:10:47,997
Translate, please.

181
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:54,870
Oh, thank you, agnes.

182
00:10:56,372 --> 00:10:59,375
You're just like a mother.

183
00:11:06,417 --> 00:11:07,883
Gesundheit.

184
00:11:07,918 --> 00:11:09,885
I'm sorry
about last night, millie.

185
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,138
It won't happen again.

186
00:11:12,173 --> 00:11:14,640
I'm glad
you like the roses.

187
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:16,525
Say, are you catching cold?

188
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:19,278
L-i'm aller...

189
00:11:20,564 --> 00:11:22,031
allergic to roses.

190
00:11:22,066 --> 00:11:23,532
Oh, millie.

191
00:11:24,819 --> 00:11:26,786
Elwood, just please, go away.

192
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:32,291
And take these roses
with you.

193
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:38,297
Gesundheit.

194
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:53,929
Agnes, i don't understand.

195
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:56,432
No other computer contains

196
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:59,435
as much recorded knowledge
as yours.

197
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:02,438
You're the star
of all the mechanical brains.

198
00:12:02,473 --> 00:12:03,939
But...

199
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:07,693
whenever i follow your advice
i seem to louse things up.

200
00:12:10,114 --> 00:12:12,081
Agnes, what's the matter?

201
00:12:14,118 --> 00:12:15,951
Agnes, stop that.

202
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:16,836
Stop it.

203
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,595
That's ridiculous,
she's a wonderful girl.

204
00:12:29,465 --> 00:12:31,851
Better girl? Who?

205
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,721
Who, agnes?

206
00:12:38,607 --> 00:12:40,359
Agnes, tell me who.

207
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:43,863
Agnes, who?

208
00:12:43,898 --> 00:12:46,115
Who is it? Who?

209
00:12:50,619 --> 00:12:52,872
Who, agnes? Who is it?

210
00:12:53,122 --> 00:12:56,625
Agnes? Who?

211
00:13:21,684 --> 00:13:25,187
Here are 220 pages
of data, curves, graphs,

212
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:28,691
the latest astronomical factors
involving the flight.

213
00:13:28,726 --> 00:13:31,694
Now feed all the pertinent
questions to agnes.

214
00:13:31,729 --> 00:13:33,195
She has to come up with answers
in a week.

215
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,697
I guarantee it.

216
00:13:34,732 --> 00:13:37,199
And remember,
an error of one millisecond

217
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:41,453
can cause a 400,000 mile
divergence from the trajectory.

218
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:42,705
Do you understand
the problem, jim?

219
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,206
Yes. Can this
new spacecraft

220
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:45,958
execute six
eccentric orbits

221
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:49,211
around the planet venus
and return to earth safely.

222
00:13:49,246 --> 00:13:51,463
Right. Now let agnes
work it out.

223
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:53,966
Yes, sir.

224
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:06,478
You better be careful here,
agnes.

225
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:11,984
Better correct escape velocity
for solar radiation factor.

226
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:13,736
Give answer.

227
00:14:16,238 --> 00:14:17,623
Now, stop that.

228
00:14:17,873 --> 00:14:20,626
Just give the escape velocity
and forget about millie.

229
00:14:23,746 --> 00:14:26,498
Yes, yes,
we've got a date tonight.

230
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:32,004
The truth is i'm scared.

231
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:34,757
I've got to impress her-
it's now or never.

232
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,894
How?

233
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:46,151
Name someone inferior
to me, please.

234
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:50,906
Walter holmes?

235
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:55,160
Walter with the red sports car?

236
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:01,667
Walter with the suntan
and the muscles?

237
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:05,788
Introduce walter and millie?

238
00:15:05,823 --> 00:15:07,039
Are you sure?

239
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:12,544
Oh, all right, i'll try it.

240
00:15:20,302 --> 00:15:23,555
Hello, walter,
this is jim elwood.

241
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,557
What are you doing
for dinner tonight?

242
00:15:29,311 --> 00:15:31,563
He insisted
that we stop by

243
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:33,565
for a drink
before dinner.

244
00:15:35,317 --> 00:15:37,820
Come in.

245
00:15:37,855 --> 00:15:39,571
Walter,
this is millie.

246
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:42,574
Millie,
this is walter.

247
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:44,076
Elwood,
you didn't tell me

248
00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:47,079
millie has the most
incredible eyes.

249
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:48,080
Tell you?

250
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:49,832
Thank you,
walter.

251
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:51,583
Come on in,
come on in.

252
00:15:54,336 --> 00:15:56,338
I'll get the door.

253
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:03,345
Nectar for a goddess.

254
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:06,348
Looks just like
an ordinary martini to me.

255
00:16:08,851 --> 00:16:10,602
It is nectar.

256
00:16:10,853 --> 00:16:14,356
All this time at superdata
and we've never met.

257
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:16,742
Shall we make up
for lost time?

258
00:16:16,777 --> 00:16:17,743
You bet.

259
00:16:17,778 --> 00:16:21,363
Do you like
sports car races?

260
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:23,365
I've never been to one.

261
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,117
I'm driving
my mustang 500 this weekend.

262
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:27,119
Sounds dangerous.

263
00:16:27,154 --> 00:16:29,371
Danger adds spice
to living

264
00:16:29,406 --> 00:16:31,623
and my car does 160.

265
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:34,626
Astronauts do 17,000
miles an hour.

266
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:37,379
17,000.

267
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:39,381
Would you like to drive
my little bug?

268
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:40,883
I'd love to.

269
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:43,635
Hello.

270
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,636
Oh, hello t.t.

271
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:48,140
Yes, he's here,
hold on.

272
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:51,143
Supervisor, for you.

273
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:52,895
Hello.

274
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:56,648
Sorry to spoil your evening,
jim, but this is an emergency.

275
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:58,901
Washington insists

276
00:16:58,936 --> 00:17:00,903
that blast off of venus project
be advanced three days.

277
00:17:00,938 --> 00:17:02,905
We need your data.

278
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,156
Right.

279
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:05,908
Can you get on it right away?

280
00:17:05,943 --> 00:17:06,909
Good.

281
00:17:06,944 --> 00:17:07,910
See you in an hour.

282
00:17:07,945 --> 00:17:08,911
Right, good-bye.

283
00:17:11,914 --> 00:17:13,165
I'm sorry, millie,

284
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,666
but i have to get
back on the job.

285
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:16,418
I'll have to
take you home.

286
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:18,670
And deprive me
of taking millie to dinner?

287
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:20,172
That sounds lovely.

288
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:21,924
Well, really, you...

289
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:23,675
just because
you get hung up,

290
00:17:23,926 --> 00:17:25,427
you don't want
to ruin millie's evening,

291
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:26,428
do you, old man?

292
00:17:26,463 --> 00:17:27,679
No, but...

293
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:29,431
good!
You're a nice guy.

294
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:30,933
I hope you understand, jim.

295
00:17:30,968 --> 00:17:32,184
Perhaps tomorrow night.

296
00:17:33,435 --> 00:17:35,437
Yeah... sure.

297
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:39,441
Well, good night.

298
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:40,826
Uh, excuse me.

299
00:17:40,861 --> 00:17:42,327
Uh, elwood?

300
00:17:42,362 --> 00:17:44,830
Uh, say, elwood, uh,

301
00:17:44,865 --> 00:17:47,332
you and mill don't
have anything special

302
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:48,584
going for you, do you?

303
00:17:48,619 --> 00:17:50,085
"Mill"?
Millie.

304
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,587
Well, no, not exactly,
but i...

305
00:17:51,622 --> 00:17:52,838
fine. Fine.

306
00:17:52,873 --> 00:17:54,840
I don't like to cut in
on closed territory.

307
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:57,342
Thanks for the all clear.

308
00:17:57,593 --> 00:17:59,094
Good night.

309
00:17:59,129 --> 00:18:01,597
And good luck.

310
00:18:01,632 --> 00:18:06,852
Now, uh, where
were we, mill?

311
00:18:09,605 --> 00:18:11,607
No, no, no!

312
00:18:11,642 --> 00:18:14,610
Agnes, forget
the radiation factor.

313
00:18:14,645 --> 00:18:16,612
Will you concentrate?

314
00:18:16,647 --> 00:18:18,614
Now answer this:

315
00:18:18,649 --> 00:18:21,366
Do new conditions permit

316
00:18:21,401 --> 00:18:26,371
six successful eccentric orbits
of venus and reentry?

317
00:18:28,123 --> 00:18:29,625
Go ahead.

318
00:18:36,131 --> 00:18:38,383
Agnes, concentrate.

319
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:45,257
All right, all right,
i'll tell you.

320
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:53,015
Walter and millie had...
martinis

321
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:56,018
and walter took millie
to dinner...

322
00:18:56,053 --> 00:18:58,520
i'm starved.

323
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,022
Why did you tell me

324
00:19:00,057 --> 00:19:03,775
to introduce millie to that...
that sex fiend?

325
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:08,030
I will not give her up,
i love her!

326
00:19:08,065 --> 00:19:11,033
And what's more, and i'm going
to make her love me.

327
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:15,287
Has all the new data been
stored in her memory units?

328
00:19:15,537 --> 00:19:16,538
Yes, sir.

329
00:19:16,573 --> 00:19:17,539
Fine,
let's get to work.

330
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:18,790
Ready, jim?

331
00:19:21,043 --> 00:19:23,045
Question:

332
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,297
Do new conditions permit

333
00:19:25,332 --> 00:19:28,800
six successful eccentric orbits
of venus and reentry?

334
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:34,806
What the devil
does that mean?

335
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:37,059
I... i don't know...
i think it's russian.

336
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:38,310
What?

337
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:40,562
Wait, please.

338
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:42,064
Translate into english.

339
00:19:42,197 --> 00:19:43,448
Into english.

340
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:56,712
She... she's
a little disturbed.

341
00:19:56,747 --> 00:19:58,213
Do something, jim.

342
00:19:58,248 --> 00:20:00,465
We've got to have
that information.

343
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,718
I believe
i can get the answer, sir,

344
00:20:02,753 --> 00:20:04,970
if you'll just leave me alone
with her.

345
00:20:05,005 --> 00:20:06,221
All right, jim.

346
00:20:14,096 --> 00:20:16,848
I'll be fired-
is that what you want?

347
00:20:18,635 --> 00:20:20,852
I don't know what to do.

348
00:20:21,103 --> 00:20:23,605
I'm going to get help.

349
00:20:24,606 --> 00:20:27,109
Don't go away.

350
00:20:35,617 --> 00:20:37,369
Oh, you.

351
00:20:37,404 --> 00:20:39,371
I know it's late,
but i need help.

352
00:20:39,621 --> 00:20:40,622
Oh, take it easy, old man.

353
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:43,625
Jimmy boy!

354
00:20:44,626 --> 00:20:45,877
Uh...

355
00:20:46,128 --> 00:20:48,380
walter,
you're a senior programmer.

356
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:49,881
Agnes is all fouled up.

357
00:20:50,132 --> 00:20:51,383
I need help.

358
00:20:51,418 --> 00:20:54,636
Sure, anything at all,
old boy, in the morning.

359
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:56,138
That's too late. Now.

360
00:20:56,173 --> 00:20:58,140
And leave this lovely girl
all alone?

361
00:20:58,175 --> 00:20:59,891
Don't be silly.

362
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:01,393
Don't worry, jim.

363
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:03,895
Wally will help you
in the morning.

364
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,647
Oh, sure.
Well, good night, millie.

365
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:08,150
I'm sorry...

366
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:16,658
where did she ever learn
to dance like that?

367
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:20,662
Millie...

368
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:24,416
what did i ever do to you?

369
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:26,918
Why do you want to ruin my life?

370
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:32,924
Why do you hate me?

371
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:34,059
Make sense.

372
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:41,066
Stop speaking in riddles.

373
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:47,072
You mean...

374
00:21:47,107 --> 00:21:50,075
you were jealous of millie?

375
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:52,077
You wanted me all to yourself?

376
00:21:52,112 --> 00:21:54,079
No, that's impossible.

377
00:21:54,329 --> 00:21:55,330
I'm going crazy.

378
00:21:57,332 --> 00:21:59,584
You're just a machine.

379
00:21:59,619 --> 00:22:02,587
You're just a bunch of grids
and computer circuits.

380
00:22:02,622 --> 00:22:07,092
You're nothing but a bunch
of tubes and data drops.

381
00:22:07,127 --> 00:22:09,845
You're just
a fancy automatic tape recorder.

382
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,346
You can't love or hate.

383
00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:42,878
It's amazing, sir.

384
00:22:42,913 --> 00:22:44,129
Jim elwood is one
of the finest

385
00:22:44,164 --> 00:22:45,630
computer programmers
in the country.

386
00:22:45,881 --> 00:22:47,132
So was fred danziger

387
00:22:47,382 --> 00:22:48,884
and he couldn't handle
agnes, either.

388
00:22:48,919 --> 00:22:50,385
I'm positive i can.

389
00:22:53,889 --> 00:22:55,390
Elwood!

390
00:22:57,392 --> 00:22:59,644
Two and two are four,
shut the door.

391
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,898
Two and four are six,
pick up sticks.

392
00:23:02,933 --> 00:23:04,900
It'll be
all right, jim.

393
00:23:04,935 --> 00:23:07,903
You've been working very hard
and we appreciate it.

394
00:23:07,938 --> 00:23:11,406
How about a long,
long leave of absence?

395
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:13,658
Meanwhile,
walter will take over.

396
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:16,661
You?

397
00:23:16,696 --> 00:23:19,664
Oh, no, you don't have a chance.

398
00:23:19,699 --> 00:23:21,666
She knows all about
you and millie.

399
00:23:24,204 --> 00:23:26,171
You haven't got
a chance.

400
00:23:30,425 --> 00:23:32,677
Watch out for that female.

401
00:23:32,712 --> 00:23:35,680
Watch out for that femme fatale.

402
00:23:39,684 --> 00:23:41,686
He was a good man.

403
00:23:41,721 --> 00:23:43,438
Well, do your best, walter.

404
00:23:43,473 --> 00:23:44,439
Don't worry, sir,

405
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:47,442
i'll have the answers
to the venus project

406
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:48,944
in no time at all.

407
00:24:03,825 --> 00:24:06,828
Advice to all future
male scientists:

408
00:24:06,863 --> 00:24:09,831
Be sure you understand
the opposite sex

409
00:24:09,866 --> 00:24:12,834
especially if you intend
being a computer expert.

410
00:24:12,869 --> 00:24:15,837
Otherwise you may find yourself
like poor elwood,

411
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:18,840
defeated by a jealous machine,

412
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:20,342
a most dangerous sort of female

413
00:24:20,377 --> 00:24:23,094
whose victims
are forever banished

414
00:24:23,129 --> 00:24:25,347
to the twilight zone.

415
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:31,570
And now, mr. Serling.

416
00:24:31,605 --> 00:24:32,821
Next onthe twilight zone,

417
00:24:32,856 --> 00:24:34,573
the stalwart typewriter
of richard matheson

418
00:24:34,608 --> 00:24:36,324
brings us a most intriguing tale

419
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:38,827
of riders, pale horses
and peeks into the future.

420
00:24:38,862 --> 00:24:41,329
It stars diana hyland
and it concerns itself

421
00:24:41,364 --> 00:24:44,583
with some very unlooked for
and some unpredictable events.

422
00:24:44,618 --> 00:24:45,834
It's called "spur of the moment"

423
00:24:45,869 --> 00:24:47,335
and it's recommended
for those of you

424
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:49,838
who'd like to take a look
at the next page of the calendar

425
00:24:49,873 --> 00:24:51,089
before it's time.

426
00:24:51,124 --> 00:24:54,593
Ontwilight zonenext,
"spur of the moment."
