1
00:00:07,524 --> 00:00:11,277
You unlock this door
with the key of imagination.

2
00:00:11,312 --> 00:00:13,029
Beyond it is another dimension-

3
00:00:13,064 --> 00:00:15,648
a dimension of sound,

4
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:17,534
a dimension of sight,

5
00:00:17,569 --> 00:00:19,402
a dimension of mind.

6
00:00:19,437 --> 00:00:22,539
You're moving into a land
of both shadow and substance,

7
00:00:22,574 --> 00:00:23,790
of things and ideas.

8
00:00:23,825 --> 00:00:27,544
You've just crossed over
into the twilight zone.

9
00:00:51,935 --> 00:00:54,320
Well, rollie, i kept it
from you long enough.

10
00:00:54,355 --> 00:00:56,189
The fact is we're lost.

11
00:00:58,226 --> 00:00:59,943
And you know something else?

12
00:01:00,577 --> 00:01:01,828
Take a look at this.

13
00:01:01,863 --> 00:01:05,081
Almost empty.

14
00:01:23,099 --> 00:01:26,853
Well, you just earned yourself
a steak.

15
00:01:48,124 --> 00:01:49,375
How do?

16
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:51,244
Hi, can you fill it up?

17
00:01:51,279 --> 00:01:53,746
I don't see why not.

18
00:02:01,638 --> 00:02:04,140
It's right there
behind the license plate.

19
00:02:04,175 --> 00:02:05,391
Oh, sure.

20
00:02:05,426 --> 00:02:06,643
Probably bone dry.

21
00:02:06,678 --> 00:02:09,145
Doubt i could've gone
another mile.

22
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:12,265
How'd you let a thing
like that happen?

23
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,150
I listened
to a friend of mine.

24
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:16,019
He told me i could cut
a couple of hours

25
00:02:16,054 --> 00:02:20,406
off my trip to albuquerque
by taking the back route.

26
00:02:20,441 --> 00:02:22,909
Nice scenery, he said,
no traffic.

27
00:02:22,944 --> 00:02:25,278
If i'd have gone
the way i know,

28
00:02:25,313 --> 00:02:26,529
i'd be home by now.

29
00:02:28,031 --> 00:02:29,415
You mean you're lost.

30
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:32,418
Yeah, that's what i mean.

31
00:02:33,036 --> 00:02:34,287
Say, you couldn't
show me the way

32
00:02:34,322 --> 00:02:36,172
to a big highway around here,
a nice, big highway

33
00:02:36,207 --> 00:02:37,790
with a lot of signs?

34
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:40,293
Oh, ah, you just go
back to the fork,

35
00:02:40,328 --> 00:02:42,795
take the other road to bredon.

36
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,047
That's about 80 miles.

37
00:02:44,082 --> 00:02:46,549
And when you get there,
ask somebody for a map.

38
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:49,686
Nice little town
you got here.

39
00:02:49,721 --> 00:02:52,188
What do you call
this place?

40
00:02:52,223 --> 00:02:54,057
Peaceful valley.

41
00:02:54,092 --> 00:02:55,942
It's peaceful,
all right.

42
00:02:55,977 --> 00:02:58,444
Is there a restaurant
around here?

43
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:00,947
Up there, up
the street,

44
00:03:00,982 --> 00:03:02,815
but it's closed.

45
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:05,318
You'll be better
off in bredon.

46
00:03:05,353 --> 00:03:07,203
Well, i know,
but i'm hungry right now.

47
00:03:07,238 --> 00:03:08,321
So is my dog.

48
00:03:09,607 --> 00:03:11,958
Well, i'm sorry.

49
00:03:11,993 --> 00:03:15,078
We don't get many
visitors here.

50
00:03:15,113 --> 00:03:17,580
Well, i can see why.

51
00:03:17,615 --> 00:03:20,717
That'll be $4.42.

52
00:03:20,752 --> 00:03:22,585
Here's a tenner.

53
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,722
I hope i got change.

54
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:31,978
Here you go.

55
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,851
Rollie, shut up.

56
00:03:44,275 --> 00:03:45,992
Rollie, rollie,
come back here!

57
00:03:46,027 --> 00:03:47,243
Not yet. Wait a minute.

58
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,118
Nine...

59
00:03:55,153 --> 00:03:56,369
rollie, get away
from that cat!

60
00:03:56,404 --> 00:03:59,505
9.50, 9.75... ten.

61
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,374
Ten, right.

62
00:04:10,133 --> 00:04:11,017
Rollie?

63
00:04:11,052 --> 00:04:13,386
Hey, kid, what'd you do
to my dog?

64
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:14,637
Nothing.
What do you mean, nothing?

65
00:04:14,672 --> 00:04:16,522
I was standing right here.
I saw you.

66
00:04:16,557 --> 00:04:17,774
You leave me alone!

67
00:04:17,809 --> 00:04:18,391
Listen, i'm not going
to leave you alone

68
00:04:18,426 --> 00:04:20,393
till you tell me
what you did to my dog!

69
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:26,649
You've seen them.

70
00:04:26,684 --> 00:04:29,786
Little towns, tucked away
far from the main roads.

71
00:04:29,821 --> 00:04:32,288
You've seen them, but have
you thought about them?

72
00:04:32,323 --> 00:04:34,791
What do the people
in these places do?

73
00:04:34,826 --> 00:04:36,042
Why do they stay?

74
00:04:36,077 --> 00:04:37,910
Philip redfield
never thought about them.

75
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:40,413
If his dog hadn't gone
after that cat,

76
00:04:40,448 --> 00:04:41,664
he'd have driven
through peaceful valley

77
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:44,167
and put it
out of his mind forever.

78
00:04:44,202 --> 00:04:46,052
But he can't do that now,

79
00:04:46,087 --> 00:04:47,303
because, whether
he knows it or not,

80
00:04:47,338 --> 00:04:49,172
his friend's shortcut
has led him

81
00:04:49,207 --> 00:04:52,925
right into the capital
of the twilight zone.

82
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:20,870
You scared
my little girl.

83
00:05:20,905 --> 00:05:21,504
Well, that makes us even.

84
00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:23,373
Your little
girl scared me.

85
00:05:23,408 --> 00:05:24,624
What do you mean
by that?
Just what i said.

86
00:05:24,659 --> 00:05:25,875
Now, look, i don't
know what she did,

87
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,126
but she made my
dog disappear.

88
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,511
What?!

89
00:05:28,546 --> 00:05:31,514
Look, she pointed some kind
of a machine at my dog,

90
00:05:31,549 --> 00:05:32,765
and he disappeared.

91
00:05:33,383 --> 00:05:34,634
Are you feeling all right?

92
00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:36,886
No, i never feel all right
when i see that kind of thing.

93
00:05:36,921 --> 00:05:38,771
It makes
my blood pressure rise.

94
00:05:38,806 --> 00:05:40,640
Easy, now, mister.

95
00:05:40,675 --> 00:05:41,524
Let's look
around the yard.

96
00:05:41,559 --> 00:05:43,393
He's bound to be here
somewhere.

97
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:45,395
What's his name?

98
00:05:46,029 --> 00:05:46,646
Rollie. Rollie's
his name.

99
00:05:46,681 --> 00:05:48,531
Here, rollie!
Here, rollie!

100
00:05:48,566 --> 00:05:49,148
Look, he was
standing right...

101
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,400
you look around there.
I'll go out back.

102
00:05:50,435 --> 00:05:52,285
Now, don't worry.
We'll find him.

103
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:52,902
He couldn't
have disappeared.

104
00:05:52,937 --> 00:05:54,787
Well, that's what i'm
trying to tell you.

105
00:05:54,822 --> 00:05:57,290
He did.

106
00:05:57,325 --> 00:05:59,792
Here, rollie!

107
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:05,548
Rollie?

108
00:06:06,451 --> 00:06:08,301
Rollie.

109
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:24,067
Rollie?

110
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:25,435
Come on, fella, come on.

111
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:26,686
Where you been, huh?

112
00:06:26,721 --> 00:06:28,571
You've been a bad boy,
haven't you, huh?

113
00:06:28,606 --> 00:06:30,440
Rollie, rollie, rollie.

114
00:06:30,475 --> 00:06:31,691
Well, where was he?

115
00:06:31,726 --> 00:06:32,325
In the back.

116
00:06:32,942 --> 00:06:34,327
I guess he must have found
another cat.

117
00:06:34,362 --> 00:06:36,195
Uh, yeah. Yeah, sure.

118
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,447
Well, thanks a lot.

119
00:06:37,482 --> 00:06:38,698
That's all right.

120
00:06:38,733 --> 00:06:39,949
The way sissy disappears
sometimes...

121
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:41,200
well, i know
how you must've felt.

122
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:43,703
Uh, sissy's your
little girl?

123
00:06:43,738 --> 00:06:44,337
Yeah.

124
00:06:44,954 --> 00:06:46,839
Look, what was
that thing she
had in her hand?

125
00:06:47,457 --> 00:06:48,841
What thing?

126
00:06:48,876 --> 00:06:52,595
Well, it was a
brown box and
a kind of a wire

127
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:55,098
with a little deal
over here, uh...

128
00:06:55,133 --> 00:06:56,349
now, wait a minute.

129
00:06:56,384 --> 00:06:57,600
Don't tell me i
imagined that.

130
00:06:57,635 --> 00:06:59,969
Oh, no, no. It, um...

131
00:07:00,004 --> 00:07:03,106
oh, it must have been
her radio.

132
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:05,608
All right.

133
00:07:05,643 --> 00:07:08,611
Well, i'm sorry
i bothered you.

134
00:07:08,646 --> 00:07:10,480
Come on, boy.

135
00:07:16,619 --> 00:07:19,739
Come on, rollie,
get in here, get in here.

136
00:07:19,774 --> 00:07:20,990
Did you see all that?

137
00:07:21,025 --> 00:07:23,493
All what?

138
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:26,629
Never mind.

139
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:33,503
Hey, bredon's the other way!

140
00:07:39,142 --> 00:07:41,010
I want to talk to dorn.

141
00:07:41,045 --> 00:07:41,644
He's not here.

142
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:44,147
Well, you better find him.
It's important.

143
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:46,015
We've got an outsider...

144
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:47,900
and he saw something.

145
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:03,666
Now, you just take it easy,
rollie.

146
00:08:03,701 --> 00:08:06,786
I'll find you a steak somewhere.

147
00:08:50,713 --> 00:08:54,467
I'm sorry, but
we don't have
any openings.

148
00:08:55,084 --> 00:08:57,587
Oh?

149
00:08:58,221 --> 00:09:00,089
Now, why is that?

150
00:09:00,124 --> 00:09:01,974
Well...

151
00:09:03,226 --> 00:09:06,345
all the rooms
are taken.

152
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,231
Oh.

153
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:12,985
Well, i guess
everyone's out, then.

154
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,854
Well, the keys...

155
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:17,240
yes. Everybody's out.

156
00:09:17,275 --> 00:09:18,491
Well, i wasn't looking
for a room, anyway.

157
00:09:18,526 --> 00:09:22,245
I was just looking
for a restaurant.

158
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,113
I'm sorry, but
it's closed.

159
00:09:24,148 --> 00:09:25,364
What, you mean
you only have

160
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:26,616
one restaurant
in peaceful valley?

161
00:09:26,651 --> 00:09:27,867
Yes, sir.

162
00:09:27,902 --> 00:09:29,752
Well, where do you eat?

163
00:09:29,787 --> 00:09:32,872
At home.
What about the guests?

164
00:09:32,907 --> 00:09:35,374
Well, they do eat,
don't they?

165
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:36,008
L-i have to go now.

166
00:09:36,043 --> 00:09:37,877
Look, just a minute, miss.

167
00:09:37,912 --> 00:09:39,762
My name is philip redfield.
I'm a reporter.

168
00:09:39,797 --> 00:09:41,631
Now, if i begin to sound
a little nosy,

169
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:42,882
i suppose it goes
with the job.

170
00:09:42,917 --> 00:09:44,767
You don't mind,
do you?
No.

171
00:09:44,802 --> 00:09:46,886
Well, maybe you can tell me
something.

172
00:09:46,921 --> 00:09:48,771
Ever since i landed here
in peaceful valley,

173
00:09:48,806 --> 00:09:50,022
people have been trying
to get rid of me.

174
00:09:50,057 --> 00:09:51,891
Now, why is that?

175
00:09:51,926 --> 00:09:55,645
Well, we just don't get
very many outsiders here.

176
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,530
So i heard.

177
00:09:57,565 --> 00:09:59,398
Yet you manage
to fill up a hotel.

178
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:05,037
I'm sorry,
but i really have to go now,

179
00:10:05,072 --> 00:10:06,906
and i think you should, too.

180
00:10:12,662 --> 00:10:13,913
Well, you better get
your subscription

181
00:10:13,948 --> 00:10:15,164
to the paper renewed.

182
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:18,918
A lot of things
have happened since '53.

183
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,959
Thanks for everything.

184
00:11:26,736 --> 00:11:28,738
Rollie.

185
00:11:43,386 --> 00:11:45,888
Are you all
right, sir?

186
00:11:46,756 --> 00:11:48,007
My dog is dead.

187
00:11:49,258 --> 00:11:52,395
I don't know
how this could've happened, i...

188
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:55,514
there wasn't a car around
anywhere.

189
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:57,149
Perhaps it was a rock.

190
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:03,155
Well, wouldn't it be around
somewhere?

191
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:04,407
Well, you could've

192
00:12:04,442 --> 00:12:06,909
knocked it
into the woods.

193
00:12:06,944 --> 00:12:08,160
Come along,
mr. Redfield.

194
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:09,912
We've got to get you
to a doctor.

195
00:12:09,947 --> 00:12:11,664
We'll take care
of your car.

196
00:12:11,699 --> 00:12:13,416
What about my dog?

197
00:12:13,451 --> 00:12:15,918
Well, we'll
take care of
your dog, too.

198
00:12:15,953 --> 00:12:17,787
You have nothing
to worry about.

199
00:12:28,798 --> 00:12:30,049
Wait a minute!

200
00:12:30,084 --> 00:12:32,551
Wait a minute, i don't want
to go back to your town!

201
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:33,803
Well, you have
to be examined.

202
00:12:33,838 --> 00:12:35,688
I'm all right.

203
00:12:35,723 --> 00:12:36,939
You don't know that.

204
00:12:36,974 --> 00:12:40,059
There could be
internal injuries.

205
00:12:40,094 --> 00:12:40,943
If anything
happened to you,

206
00:12:40,978 --> 00:12:43,446
it would be
on our conscience forever.

207
00:12:43,481 --> 00:12:44,063
Come along.

208
00:12:45,448 --> 00:12:47,316
We insist.

209
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:48,567
No, w-wait...

210
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:50,453
wait, now.

211
00:12:58,496 --> 00:13:01,213
There you are,
good as new.

212
00:13:01,248 --> 00:13:03,082
We certainly haven't been
treating you very well,

213
00:13:03,117 --> 00:13:05,584
have we, old fella, hmm?

214
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:08,087
Come on. Here. Come on.

215
00:13:24,186 --> 00:13:25,437
Is this a doctor's office?

216
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:28,574
In a way.

217
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:46,709
Thank you, gentlemen.
You can leave now.

218
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:56,468
Mr. Redfield.

219
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:58,354
Please sit down.

220
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:02,975
How do you feel?

221
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,860
Terrible.

222
00:14:04,895 --> 00:14:06,729
I'm sorry to hear that.

223
00:14:06,764 --> 00:14:09,865
Perhaps it would help
to learn your dog is well.

224
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,734
My dog is dead.

225
00:14:11,769 --> 00:14:14,236
Oh, no... no, no,
merely stunned.

226
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,121
He's really quite happy now.

227
00:14:16,156 --> 00:14:17,373
How do you know?

228
00:14:17,408 --> 00:14:18,624
Mr. Swanson-

229
00:14:18,659 --> 00:14:21,126
one of the men
who helped you- called in.

230
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:22,995
He thought you'd be pleased.

231
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,880
Well, i am...

232
00:14:24,915 --> 00:14:26,749
if it's the truth.

233
00:14:26,784 --> 00:14:31,136
My, you do have
a suspicious nature, don't you?

234
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:34,890
Oh, uh...

235
00:14:34,925 --> 00:14:36,258
forgive me.

236
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:38,143
Ny name is dorn.

237
00:14:38,178 --> 00:14:40,646
I'm the mayor
of peaceful valley.

238
00:14:40,681 --> 00:14:42,147
The gentlemen
to my left:

239
00:14:42,182 --> 00:14:45,267
Mr. Connelly, mr. Evans,
my associates.

240
00:14:45,302 --> 00:14:47,019
Which one is the doctor?

241
00:14:47,054 --> 00:14:48,904
Doc...?

242
00:14:48,939 --> 00:14:50,155
Oh, oh, oh, of course.

243
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:54,526
But you don't really need
a doctor, do you, mr. Redfield?

244
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:56,412
Because if you did,

245
00:14:56,447 --> 00:14:59,164
we'd get one here
immediately.

246
00:15:00,783 --> 00:15:02,668
Please... sit down.

247
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:17,182
We'll try not to
detain you long.

248
00:15:17,217 --> 00:15:20,803
Then you couldn't go anywhere
in a wrecked car, now, can you?

249
00:15:20,838 --> 00:15:23,305
We'd just like to ask you
a few questions,

250
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,808
if we may- uh, just a few.

251
00:15:25,843 --> 00:15:28,310
Perhaps you'd like to begin.

252
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:32,197
Mr. Redfield, it's been reported
you saw something unusual

253
00:15:32,232 --> 00:15:34,700
in the yard
next to the gasoline station.

254
00:15:34,735 --> 00:15:36,568
Would you please tell us
about it?

255
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:38,821
My dog chased a cat.

256
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:41,323
The details, please.

257
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:42,708
Well, that's it.

258
00:15:42,743 --> 00:15:46,962
Are you quite sure
you saw nothing more?

259
00:15:46,997 --> 00:15:48,580
Yes.

260
00:15:49,465 --> 00:15:51,967
Mr. Connelly, your question.

261
00:15:52,002 --> 00:15:54,470
I was simply wondering,
mr. Redfield,

262
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:56,338
why you told
the girl at the hotel

263
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:58,223
that people were trying
to get rid of you.

264
00:15:58,258 --> 00:15:59,842
Now, wait a minute, look.

265
00:15:59,877 --> 00:16:01,093
What is this,

266
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:02,344
some kind of
a quiz hour?!

267
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:04,847
My car is out there wrecked
somewhere.

268
00:16:04,882 --> 00:16:06,098
I'm already a day late for work.

269
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:07,983
Your car's being repaired.

270
00:16:08,018 --> 00:16:09,234
By who, that
station attendant?

271
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:11,103
Why, he couldn't even find
the gas tank.

272
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:12,604
It is being
repaired.

273
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,358
Uh, just a few
more questions, please.

274
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,995
I understand you mentioned

275
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:22,498
you're a newspaper reporter
by occupation.

276
00:16:22,533 --> 00:16:23,615
So?

277
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:27,369
Oh, noble calling...

278
00:16:27,404 --> 00:16:28,620
but limited.

279
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:31,123
I suppose you have that novel

280
00:16:31,158 --> 00:16:33,625
in the planning stage.

281
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,511
Who told you about that?

282
00:16:35,546 --> 00:16:38,263
No one, but isn't it a fact

283
00:16:38,298 --> 00:16:40,766
that most reporters aspire
to be novelists?

284
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:43,519
I wouldn't know.

285
00:16:43,554 --> 00:16:45,387
Are you married?
No.

286
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:47,272
Engaged?
No. Now, look...

287
00:16:47,307 --> 00:16:49,141
one last question,
please.

288
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:51,777
Did you indeed come
to peaceful valley by mistake?

289
00:16:52,394 --> 00:16:53,645
I mean, no one knows

290
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,397
you're here?

291
00:16:55,432 --> 00:16:58,534
No, no one knows i'm here.

292
00:16:58,569 --> 00:16:59,651
But i'll tell
you this:

293
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:02,538
A lot of people
are going to
know i was here.

294
00:17:02,573 --> 00:17:05,040
Oh, dear.

295
00:17:05,075 --> 00:17:07,159
Now, what's the story
on this place?

296
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:10,295
My dog didn't disappear
chasing a cat,

297
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:12,798
and my car didn't crash
into any rock.

298
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:15,667
Now, what
did happen?

299
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:17,669
Come back in an hour,
mr. Redfield.

300
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:21,423
Perhaps then you'll get
the answers to your questions.

301
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:24,810
All right, i will.
Where's the phone?

302
00:17:24,845 --> 00:17:26,929
There's one at the hotel.

303
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:39,324
You think it's wise
letting him go like that?

304
00:17:40,576 --> 00:17:43,695
He'll be watched.

305
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:49,334
Well, gentlemen...

306
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:51,203
it's happened.

307
00:17:51,238 --> 00:17:53,589
It had to, eventually.

308
00:17:53,624 --> 00:17:57,342
No! It didn't have to.

309
00:17:57,377 --> 00:17:59,211
And it wouldn't have
if we kept our wits about us,

310
00:17:59,246 --> 00:18:01,096
but we didn't.

311
00:18:01,131 --> 00:18:02,965
We were so complacent,

312
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,467
so infernally sure of ourselves
and complacent.

313
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:06,602
Dorn.

314
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:09,221
Mr. Evans,

315
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:11,723
would you explain
the point of keeping

316
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:14,610
the hotel open
and the restaurant closed?

317
00:18:14,645 --> 00:18:16,361
Well, now, i don't think...
doesn't it seem
more likely

318
00:18:16,979 --> 00:18:18,363
that there would be
more inquiries

319
00:18:18,398 --> 00:18:20,232
for food than for rooms?

320
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:24,369
There hasn't been either
in over 16 years.

321
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:28,373
You see? Complacency.

322
00:18:28,408 --> 00:18:31,493
And i'm as much to blame
as anyone.

323
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:34,630
If only the little johnson girl
hadn't been so careless.

324
00:18:34,665 --> 00:18:37,132
If only fredericks
hadn't acted suspiciously

325
00:18:37,167 --> 00:18:38,383
at the gasoline station.

326
00:18:38,418 --> 00:18:41,503
If only i hadn't panicked
and raised the wall!

327
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:43,138
You had to.

328
00:18:43,173 --> 00:18:45,390
There wasn't any choice by then.

329
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:48,010
So now...

330
00:18:48,045 --> 00:18:52,397
an innocent young man
who hasn't done anyone any harm

331
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:56,151
must suffer for our mistakes.

332
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:58,770
How do you get long distance
on this thing?

333
00:18:58,805 --> 00:18:59,404
You just pick it
up, but you...

334
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:01,907
hello, operator?
Operator, get me long distance.

335
00:19:01,942 --> 00:19:02,524
But what?

336
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:03,775
Nothing.

337
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,661
Operator.

338
00:19:05,696 --> 00:19:07,529
Operator, i want to put through
a call to albuquerque.

339
00:19:07,564 --> 00:19:09,414
The number's chapel 77205,

340
00:19:09,449 --> 00:19:11,283
and i want it to be
station to station, please.

341
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:12,534
Just a moment.

342
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:15,671
That's quite a mirror you got.

343
00:19:15,706 --> 00:19:18,173
It makes you feel
really welcome.

344
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:20,175
Have you talked to dorn?

345
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:21,543
Yeah, i talked to him.
He's a great guy.

346
00:19:21,578 --> 00:19:24,046
My dog vanishes,
my car crashes into thin air,

347
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,548
and he wants to know
if i'm writing a novel.

348
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:27,799
Hello?

349
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:28,433
Yes.

350
00:19:29,051 --> 00:19:30,936
I'm sorry.
The circuits are busy.

351
00:19:30,971 --> 00:19:33,438
All right, miss. Will you
keep trying and call me back?

352
00:19:33,473 --> 00:19:35,941
My name is redfield.

353
00:19:41,563 --> 00:19:43,198
Well, i see they
haven't gotten back.

354
00:19:43,233 --> 00:19:44,449
Pardon me?

355
00:19:44,484 --> 00:19:46,318
Your guests.

356
00:19:46,353 --> 00:19:48,203
Oh, well, no.

357
00:19:48,238 --> 00:19:50,706
That's because
there aren't any guests.

358
00:19:50,741 --> 00:19:51,323
Isn't that right?

359
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:55,711
You really should've left,
mr. Redfield.

360
00:19:55,746 --> 00:19:57,579
Well, i tried to,

361
00:19:57,614 --> 00:20:00,082
but my car smashed into a rock
that wasn't there.

362
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:07,339
How do you suppose
that happened?

363
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:09,224
L-i don't know.

364
00:20:09,259 --> 00:20:12,344
What is your name,
or is that a secret, too?

365
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:14,229
Ellen marshall.

366
00:20:14,264 --> 00:20:16,098
Well, ellen, i want you
to contact me

367
00:20:16,133 --> 00:20:17,349
as soon as my call
comes through.

368
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:19,234
Now, this is important.
Will you do that?

369
00:20:19,269 --> 00:20:21,737
Yes, of course.
Where will you be?

370
00:20:21,772 --> 00:20:22,988
I'm going to check
on my car now,

371
00:20:23,023 --> 00:20:24,239
and i'll be
at the mayor's office

372
00:20:24,274 --> 00:20:24,856
in a couple of minutes-

373
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:27,993
probably starving
to death.

374
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:37,252
Rollie!

375
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:39,755
Rollie, how are you, boy?

376
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:41,623
Huh? How are you?!

377
00:20:41,658 --> 00:20:43,508
I had you counted out,
did you know that, huh?

378
00:20:43,543 --> 00:20:45,377
How are you, rollie?

379
00:20:45,412 --> 00:20:46,628
I fed him.

380
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:49,131
Well, thanks, but
what about my car?

381
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:50,382
It's pretty banged up.

382
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:51,633
Well, i know, but
you were supposed

383
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:52,884
to be trying
to fix it.

384
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,136
Didn't anybody tell me.

385
00:20:54,171 --> 00:20:55,387
Well, i'm
telling you!

386
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:57,889
I can't do anything
unless it's official.

387
00:20:57,924 --> 00:21:00,392
Well, look, all right,
it is official-

388
00:21:00,427 --> 00:21:01,643
about $200's
worth of official

389
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:04,146
if you get it fixed
as soon as you can.

390
00:21:04,181 --> 00:21:06,648
Sorry.

391
00:21:06,683 --> 00:21:08,533
Well, you're going
to be sorrier.

392
00:21:20,796 --> 00:21:24,549
Come in, mr. Redfield.

393
00:21:25,801 --> 00:21:26,418
I thought
you told me

394
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:28,920
my car was going
to be repaired.

395
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:30,806
Please sit down.

396
00:21:30,841 --> 00:21:31,423
I don't want
to sit down!

397
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:33,308
I want to know
why nothing's been
done to my car,

398
00:21:33,343 --> 00:21:34,559
why it's just
sitting out there.

399
00:21:34,594 --> 00:21:38,313
Primarily because
you won't be needing it anymore.

400
00:21:38,348 --> 00:21:40,816
Oh, no? Well, why?

401
00:21:42,818 --> 00:21:47,189
Because you are never going
to leave peaceful valley.

402
00:21:52,794 --> 00:21:57,616
Twilight zonewill continue
after station identification.

403
00:22:10,512 --> 00:22:13,131
You are never going
to leave peaceful valley.

404
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:17,019
You see, the situation is rather
complicated, mr. Redfield.

405
00:22:17,054 --> 00:22:20,772
Although we hold no brief
against you personally...

406
00:22:20,807 --> 00:22:22,891
wait a minute.

407
00:22:22,926 --> 00:22:24,893
Wait a minute. Sure.

408
00:22:24,928 --> 00:22:26,144
I think i got this
thing figured out.

409
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:27,396
Oh?

410
00:22:27,431 --> 00:22:29,898
Well, sure-
peaceful valley is a town

411
00:22:29,933 --> 00:22:32,401
full of lunatics,
and you guys head the list!

412
00:22:32,436 --> 00:22:33,035
Now, what do you mean,

413
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:34,903
i'm not ever going
to be able to leave here?

414
00:22:34,938 --> 00:22:37,406
Just that.

415
00:22:37,441 --> 00:22:39,791
Well, who's going
to stop me?

416
00:22:39,826 --> 00:22:41,660
We are.

417
00:22:41,695 --> 00:22:45,163
There's nothing you
can do, mr. Redfield.

418
00:22:46,415 --> 00:22:49,551
Well, how's this?

419
00:23:07,069 --> 00:23:09,571
Now... let us continue.

420
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:12,691
What did you...?

421
00:23:12,726 --> 00:23:15,193
How did i get in this chair?

422
00:23:15,228 --> 00:23:17,696
You were disassembled
over there...

423
00:23:17,731 --> 00:23:20,198
and reassembled there...

424
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:22,084
with this.

425
00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:24,202
What is that?

426
00:23:26,088 --> 00:23:29,841
I'm afraid you wouldn't
understand, mr. Redfield...

427
00:23:29,876 --> 00:23:32,961
even if you were a physicist,
which you are not.

428
00:23:32,996 --> 00:23:34,846
Let us say it
is a device

429
00:23:34,881 --> 00:23:37,966
by which we move
things about.

430
00:23:38,001 --> 00:23:42,354
All things are collections
of atoms with spaces in between.

431
00:23:42,389 --> 00:23:44,222
Even you, mr. Redfield.

432
00:23:44,257 --> 00:23:48,360
And atoms are in a
given mathematical
arrangement.

433
00:23:48,395 --> 00:23:51,113
This device breaks them up,
stores them

434
00:23:51,148 --> 00:23:53,615
and puts them together again
in the same order.

435
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:56,735
That's ridiculous.

436
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:59,237
Perhaps, but...

437
00:23:59,272 --> 00:24:00,489
it saves a lot of time

438
00:24:00,524 --> 00:24:02,374
when you want
to move furniture around.

439
00:24:02,409 --> 00:24:03,625
Dorn.

440
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,243
Yes, mr. Evans.

441
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:08,747
Let's get this over with.

442
00:24:09,881 --> 00:24:11,750
I'm sorry.

443
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:18,006
You sensed a story in this town,
mr. Redfield,

444
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:19,891
and you were right.

445
00:24:19,926 --> 00:24:22,394
You turned off onto the road
to peaceful valley.

446
00:24:22,429 --> 00:24:25,514
You saw certain things
that defied logic.

447
00:24:25,549 --> 00:24:26,765
People began to behave oddly,

448
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,650
and you became
curious, so...

449
00:24:28,685 --> 00:24:31,153
so we had to stop you.

450
00:24:31,188 --> 00:24:34,272
And now we must do even worse,

451
00:24:34,307 --> 00:24:35,524
because, mr. Redfield,

452
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:39,277
you stumbled upon the best-kept
secret in the world.

453
00:24:40,529 --> 00:24:41,780
What secret?

454
00:24:41,815 --> 00:24:44,916
Our gift, mr. Redfield,

455
00:24:45,534 --> 00:24:49,921
bestowed upon the people
of this village 104 years ago.

456
00:24:49,956 --> 00:24:53,675
A man came to peaceful valley,
from what land or...

457
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:56,178
what planet, nobody knows.

458
00:24:56,213 --> 00:24:58,680
He was a brilliant scientist

459
00:24:58,715 --> 00:25:01,800
many hundreds of years
before his time, but...

460
00:25:01,835 --> 00:25:06,188
he was also wise,
as you shall see.

461
00:25:06,805 --> 00:25:08,690
From his brain came equations

462
00:25:08,725 --> 00:25:13,061
the likes of which no one
had even seen or dreamt of...

463
00:25:13,096 --> 00:25:14,946
not on this planet, at any rate.

464
00:25:14,981 --> 00:25:18,700
Of course, i
cannot tell you
what they are.

465
00:25:18,735 --> 00:25:23,071
Mr. Redfield, you are aware,
i trust, that the basis

466
00:25:23,106 --> 00:25:27,459
of this complicated thing
we call life is energy.

467
00:25:27,494 --> 00:25:30,579
It's a frightening
and mysterious force.

468
00:25:31,213 --> 00:25:34,966
The scientist's equations
unlocked this force,

469
00:25:35,001 --> 00:25:39,337
and from it came the greatest
power for good... or evil

470
00:25:39,372 --> 00:25:41,840
the universe
has ever known.

471
00:25:41,875 --> 00:25:45,594
He decided to entrust
his secrets-

472
00:25:45,629 --> 00:25:48,730
his equations and the machines
that he had built-

473
00:25:48,765 --> 00:25:51,233
to three men he had selected,

474
00:25:51,268 --> 00:25:54,352
and he instructed them to give
the benefit of this power

475
00:25:54,387 --> 00:25:58,106
to the people of peaceful valley
for their comfort.

476
00:25:58,141 --> 00:26:01,860
But under no circumstances
were they to release the secret

477
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:03,745
to the outside world.

478
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:06,248
It was to remain
in peaceful valley...

479
00:26:06,283 --> 00:26:10,619
until humanity learned
the ways of peace.

480
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:17,626
That is your story,
mr. Redfield.

481
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:21,379
You see why we cannot allow you
to leave us.

482
00:26:21,414 --> 00:26:25,383
No, i can't say that i do.

483
00:26:26,268 --> 00:26:28,136
Perhaps if we showed you.

484
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:02,420
Mr. Redfield.

485
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:09,928
This is the original
desimulator,

486
00:27:09,963 --> 00:27:11,179
somewhat larger
than the one

487
00:27:11,214 --> 00:27:14,316
we moved you
around with upstairs.

488
00:27:16,818 --> 00:27:21,189
More or less
the same principle here,

489
00:27:21,224 --> 00:27:21,823
but with a big difference.

490
00:27:21,858 --> 00:27:24,943
It works in what we call
the time dimension.

491
00:27:24,978 --> 00:27:27,329
It has many, many uses.

492
00:27:27,364 --> 00:27:29,831
For example...

493
00:27:29,866 --> 00:27:31,082
mr. Evans.

494
00:27:36,087 --> 00:27:37,339
Mr. Connelly,

495
00:27:37,374 --> 00:27:40,458
would you hand me
the letter opener?

496
00:27:43,712 --> 00:27:45,964
Don't be frightened,
mr. Redfield.

497
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:15,493
Come with me,
mr. Redfield.

498
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:26,137
On this console,
among other things,

499
00:28:26,172 --> 00:28:29,891
we have a duplicating machine,
but not like others.

500
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:35,513
Ah!

501
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:37,399
Here's something.

502
00:28:37,434 --> 00:28:39,267
On this card,

503
00:28:39,302 --> 00:28:40,518
we have a statement

504
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:42,404
giving the
atomic structure

505
00:28:42,439 --> 00:28:44,272
of a ham sandwich
on white bread

506
00:28:44,307 --> 00:28:47,409
with mustard.

507
00:28:47,444 --> 00:28:49,778
Of course, we have
larger machines

508
00:28:49,813 --> 00:28:50,412
for the bulkier items,

509
00:28:50,447 --> 00:28:52,914
but this will
give you an idea.

510
00:29:14,185 --> 00:29:17,305
I believe you said
you were hungry, mr. Redfield.

511
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:20,442
Well, not anymore.

512
00:29:20,477 --> 00:29:22,944
Look, what was
that thing i ran
into out there?

513
00:29:22,979 --> 00:29:24,195
Oh, you mean in the car.

514
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:27,315
I'm, uh, sorry about that,
but we had to stop you.

515
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:28,566
It was an energy field:

516
00:29:28,601 --> 00:29:31,703
A wall of loosely-packed atoms,
so to speak.

517
00:29:31,738 --> 00:29:33,571
Purely an emergency device.

518
00:29:33,606 --> 00:29:36,708
This lever operates it.

519
00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:42,080
Come with me, mr. Redfield.

520
00:29:51,473 --> 00:29:53,341
And these are the
sacred papers,

521
00:29:53,376 --> 00:29:55,226
as we call them...

522
00:29:55,261 --> 00:29:59,597
the equations from
which everything
you see came about.

523
00:30:04,637 --> 00:30:07,739
Well, i think
i could use a drink.

524
00:30:14,612 --> 00:30:17,749
Do you have any
idea what you
have down there?

525
00:30:17,784 --> 00:30:19,617
Of course.

526
00:30:19,652 --> 00:30:20,869
And you mean
you don't intend

527
00:30:20,904 --> 00:30:22,120
to share it
with the rest
of the world?

528
00:30:22,155 --> 00:30:24,005
Oh, good
heavens, no.

529
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,256
Why?

530
00:30:26,257 --> 00:30:28,760
Well, i've already explained,
mr. Redfield.

531
00:30:28,795 --> 00:30:30,628
The world isn't ready.

532
00:30:30,663 --> 00:30:32,881
But peaceful valley is?

533
00:30:32,916 --> 00:30:34,382
Well, obviously.

534
00:30:34,417 --> 00:30:39,387
We have no war here, no crime,
no violence, no greed.

535
00:30:39,422 --> 00:30:42,273
Unlike your world,
we live in peace.

536
00:30:42,308 --> 00:30:45,143
We use the power for good,
not for evil.

537
00:30:45,178 --> 00:30:47,779
Well, how can you be sure
the rest of us wouldn't?

538
00:30:47,814 --> 00:30:49,647
Come, now, mr. Redfield,

539
00:30:49,682 --> 00:30:54,035
the history of civilization
has been written in blood.

540
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:55,653
But that's because
people wanted things!

541
00:30:55,688 --> 00:30:56,905
With that power...

542
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:57,655
with this power,

543
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:00,158
they would destroy
the universe.

544
00:31:00,193 --> 00:31:00,792
They're children.

545
00:31:00,827 --> 00:31:02,043
But this one machine-

546
00:31:02,078 --> 00:31:05,163
it could stop sickness
and sufferings.

547
00:31:05,198 --> 00:31:07,048
It could cure disease.

548
00:31:07,083 --> 00:31:08,917
Well, couldn't it?

549
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:11,669
Yes.

550
00:31:11,704 --> 00:31:14,422
And you just let people...

551
00:31:14,457 --> 00:31:16,925
well, don't you have
any conscience about it?

552
00:31:17,926 --> 00:31:19,811
Yes.

553
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:24,816
That is why we will not release
the secret.

554
00:31:24,851 --> 00:31:29,187
The same power that could
be used to heal sickness

555
00:31:29,222 --> 00:31:31,689
can also be used
to destroy the innocent.

556
00:31:31,724 --> 00:31:32,941
You see, one
secret would lead

557
00:31:32,976 --> 00:31:34,826
to understanding
the rest,

558
00:31:34,861 --> 00:31:36,077
and that could
be the end

559
00:31:36,112 --> 00:31:38,329
of the world.

560
00:31:38,364 --> 00:31:40,198
I don't believe that.

561
00:31:40,233 --> 00:31:43,084
Think, mr. Redfield!

562
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:45,587
Think!

563
00:31:45,622 --> 00:31:51,209
What did you do with professor
einstein's primitive equation,

564
00:31:51,244 --> 00:31:52,594
e = m c squared?

565
00:31:52,629 --> 00:31:55,346
It could have been used to
bring waters to the deserts...

566
00:31:55,381 --> 00:31:58,466
to feed starving millions.

567
00:31:58,501 --> 00:31:59,717
Was it?

568
00:32:04,105 --> 00:32:09,110
It was used to destroy countless
thousands of human beings.

569
00:32:09,145 --> 00:32:11,980
So you're just going to sit
on your secrets,

570
00:32:12,015 --> 00:32:14,482
use them to make ham sandwiches
and roadblocks?!

571
00:32:14,517 --> 00:32:16,985
Ham sandwiches
and roadblocks

572
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:19,487
are a bit better
than total destruction,

573
00:32:19,522 --> 00:32:20,738
wouldn't you say,
mr. Redfield?

574
00:32:20,773 --> 00:32:22,624
Let's get on
with this.

575
00:32:22,659 --> 00:32:23,625
You're a bunch

576
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:24,876
of hypocrites!

577
00:32:24,911 --> 00:32:27,378
You talk about us,
but what do you do

578
00:32:27,413 --> 00:32:28,630
when you want someone
out of the way?

579
00:32:28,665 --> 00:32:29,881
What do you do?!

580
00:32:29,916 --> 00:32:31,249
The same as we do!

581
00:32:31,284 --> 00:32:32,500
You eliminate him!

582
00:32:32,535 --> 00:32:34,252
Be quiet!

583
00:32:34,287 --> 00:32:35,503
No.

584
00:32:36,137 --> 00:32:39,257
He has a point,
mr. Evans.

585
00:32:39,292 --> 00:32:41,759
It's just what
i've been pondering.

586
00:32:41,794 --> 00:32:45,513
If we kill this man...

587
00:32:45,548 --> 00:32:48,016
in what way do we differ
from the outsiders?

588
00:32:48,051 --> 00:32:49,267
But we do it out
of necessity,

589
00:32:49,302 --> 00:32:50,518
not out of choice!

590
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:54,772
Thank you, adolf hitler.

591
00:32:55,773 --> 00:32:58,910
It is for the good
of the world.

592
00:32:58,945 --> 00:33:00,912
We have nothing against you.

593
00:33:00,947 --> 00:33:04,916
It's the law.
We cannot go against the law!

594
00:33:04,951 --> 00:33:08,670
And let him who discovers
the secret be eliminated.

595
00:33:10,538 --> 00:33:13,541
You can be eliminated
in one of two ways:

596
00:33:13,576 --> 00:33:17,295
Through death
or through assimilation.

597
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:19,180
The choice is yours.

598
00:33:19,215 --> 00:33:22,300
Will you die,
or will you join us?

599
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:27,438
You mean live here
the rest of my life?

600
00:33:27,473 --> 00:33:28,806
Exactly.

601
00:33:28,841 --> 00:33:30,692
Become one of us.

602
00:33:30,727 --> 00:33:32,560
It really won't be so bad.

603
00:33:32,595 --> 00:33:34,946
We'll provide you
with a fine house

604
00:33:34,981 --> 00:33:36,197
built to your
specifications,

605
00:33:36,232 --> 00:33:38,066
plenty of food,

606
00:33:38,101 --> 00:33:39,951
time to write
that novel.

607
00:33:39,986 --> 00:33:41,569
All your wants seen to.

608
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:46,457
Nothing or everything, eh?

609
00:33:46,492 --> 00:33:48,209
Substantially, yes.

610
00:33:48,826 --> 00:33:50,211
What will it be?

611
00:33:50,246 --> 00:33:51,462
Everything.

612
00:33:52,714 --> 00:33:55,216
Welcome to peaceful valley.

613
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:01,339
And this is
your study.

614
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:04,475
I'm sorry
about the typewriter,

615
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:07,595
but we couldn't find a card
for anything newer.

616
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:10,098
Don't worry, though.
It'll work fine.

617
00:34:10,133 --> 00:34:11,482
And dorn promised
that you'd have a new one.

618
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:14,602
Look...

619
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:19,741
why are you going
to all this trouble?

620
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:24,112
Oh, because dorn
asked me to.

621
00:34:24,746 --> 00:34:27,865
And-and because
i wanted to.

622
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,751
Yeah, but why?

623
00:34:30,368 --> 00:34:32,870
Because l-i don't
want you to think

624
00:34:32,905 --> 00:34:34,756
that l-i'm unfriendly.

625
00:34:34,791 --> 00:34:37,258
I'm not.

626
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:40,378
In fact, i think
you and i could be

627
00:34:40,413 --> 00:34:42,880
very good friends,
mr. Redfield.

628
00:34:42,915 --> 00:34:45,383
Do you play chess?

629
00:34:47,885 --> 00:34:49,137
Is something wrong?

630
00:34:49,172 --> 00:34:50,388
No, no.

631
00:34:50,423 --> 00:34:52,273
Well, don't you like
the house?

632
00:34:52,308 --> 00:34:54,142
L-i tried to make
everything nice for you.

633
00:34:54,177 --> 00:34:56,644
Ellen, i like it.
It's beautiful.

634
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:59,781
Are all the other houses
in town this beautiful?

635
00:34:59,816 --> 00:35:02,283
On the inside.

636
00:35:02,318 --> 00:35:05,403
Well, i'm afraid
you've wasted
your time on me.

637
00:35:05,438 --> 00:35:06,654
Why?

638
00:35:06,689 --> 00:35:09,157
Because i'm not
staying here.

639
00:35:09,192 --> 00:35:12,293
Of course you are.

640
00:35:12,328 --> 00:35:14,796
And what's that
supposed to mean?

641
00:35:14,831 --> 00:35:16,297
Well, if you keep thinking
like this,

642
00:35:16,332 --> 00:35:17,548
you'll have no choice.

643
00:35:17,583 --> 00:35:18,666
Dorn won't trust you.

644
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,551
Well, he trusts me
now, doesn't he?

645
00:35:21,669 --> 00:35:24,806
Well, doesn't he?

646
00:35:26,674 --> 00:35:30,428
I'm leaving
mr. Redfield's house.

647
00:35:30,463 --> 00:35:32,313
If-if you get hungry...

648
00:35:32,348 --> 00:35:34,816
or if you want anything,
just call me.

649
00:35:34,851 --> 00:35:38,069
I showed you
where the button is.

650
00:35:41,189 --> 00:35:43,074
Ellen, wait.

651
00:35:43,109 --> 00:35:46,194
You're not like
the others here.

652
00:35:46,229 --> 00:35:47,445
Yes, i am.

653
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,330
No.

654
00:35:49,365 --> 00:35:51,833
You're-you're different.

655
00:35:51,868 --> 00:35:55,586
You're a human being.

656
00:36:41,382 --> 00:36:42,633
Rollie, get down.

657
00:36:43,251 --> 00:36:45,753
Get down. Get down.

658
00:37:30,798 --> 00:37:32,049
Yes.

659
00:37:32,084 --> 00:37:33,301
Mr. Redfield?

660
00:37:33,336 --> 00:37:34,552
Yes?

661
00:37:34,587 --> 00:37:35,803
On your call to albuquerque...

662
00:37:35,838 --> 00:37:38,940
the circuits are still busy.

663
00:37:45,231 --> 00:37:46,447
Come in.

664
00:38:00,711 --> 00:38:01,963
Hello.

665
00:38:01,998 --> 00:38:03,214
I, um...

666
00:38:03,249 --> 00:38:05,716
i brought you a new
typewriter ribbon

667
00:38:05,751 --> 00:38:08,836
and-and some,
uh, erasers.

668
00:38:10,087 --> 00:38:12,590
Have you started
your novel yet?

669
00:38:15,092 --> 00:38:17,595
No.

670
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:20,097
Why not?

671
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:24,485
I don't know.

672
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:29,490
Maybe i don't concentrate
so well in a prison.

673
00:38:29,525 --> 00:38:31,359
I don't understand.

674
00:38:31,394 --> 00:38:33,244
Well, you ought to;
you got the same problem.

675
00:38:33,279 --> 00:38:35,112
I'm locked
in the house.

676
00:38:35,147 --> 00:38:38,249
You're locked
in the town.

677
00:38:38,284 --> 00:38:40,117
What's the
difference?

678
00:38:40,152 --> 00:38:42,620
I can leave
any time i want to.

679
00:38:42,655 --> 00:38:44,505
Then why don't you?

680
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:46,374
Well, why should i?

681
00:38:46,409 --> 00:38:47,625
Why should you?

682
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,510
We have everything
we need.

683
00:38:49,545 --> 00:38:52,013
Except freedom.

684
00:38:52,048 --> 00:38:53,881
Face it- if
you were to go

685
00:38:53,916 --> 00:38:56,384
even a couple of steps
outside of this town,

686
00:38:56,419 --> 00:38:59,520
why, they'd nail you.

687
00:38:59,555 --> 00:39:01,389
Have you ever tried?

688
00:39:01,424 --> 00:39:05,142
No, but why should
i want to try?

689
00:39:05,177 --> 00:39:06,394
What could
the outside world

690
00:39:06,429 --> 00:39:07,645
have to offer
that we don't have?

691
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,896
That's not the
point, ellen.

692
00:39:08,931 --> 00:39:12,033
It's what you
have to offer
the outside world.

693
00:39:12,068 --> 00:39:13,901
I mean, right now,
at this very moment,

694
00:39:13,936 --> 00:39:15,786
thousands and thousands
of people are starving.

695
00:39:15,821 --> 00:39:17,038
Don't you know that?

696
00:39:17,073 --> 00:39:20,157
Well, you could
feed them- you!

697
00:39:20,192 --> 00:39:21,409
They're suffering,

698
00:39:21,444 --> 00:39:23,294
and you could
make them well.

699
00:39:23,329 --> 00:39:24,545
They're breaking
their backs

700
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:26,414
ten, 15 hours a day.

701
00:39:26,449 --> 00:39:28,299
Don't you know that?

702
00:39:28,334 --> 00:39:29,550
What do you care?

703
00:39:29,585 --> 00:39:31,419
No, let them starve,
let them suffer,

704
00:39:31,454 --> 00:39:32,670
let them break
their backs.

705
00:39:32,705 --> 00:39:34,555
Let the children die

706
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:36,424
because their
mother can't give
them any milk!

707
00:39:36,459 --> 00:39:38,309
What difference does
it make to you?!

708
00:39:38,344 --> 00:39:40,811
You're happy!

709
00:39:46,434 --> 00:39:48,819
Is this really happening?

710
00:39:48,854 --> 00:39:51,572
All over the world.

711
00:39:51,607 --> 00:39:53,441
Every minute
of the day or night,

712
00:39:53,476 --> 00:39:57,194
somebody is dying... alone.

713
00:39:57,229 --> 00:39:59,697
Somebody that you could help.

714
00:39:59,732 --> 00:40:01,332
Don't say that.

715
00:40:01,367 --> 00:40:01,949
Why not?

716
00:40:02,583 --> 00:40:04,585
What difference does it make?

717
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:09,590
But...

718
00:40:09,625 --> 00:40:12,093
but what would you do?

719
00:40:12,128 --> 00:40:13,961
A terrible thing.

720
00:40:13,996 --> 00:40:17,715
I'd take your secrets
and give it to the world.

721
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:21,469
You mean you'd steal
them and run away?

722
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:24,605
Very fast.

723
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,974
But you promised
dorn that...

724
00:40:27,009 --> 00:40:30,111
look, ellen,
i promised myself first.

725
00:40:30,146 --> 00:40:34,482
I'd-i'd try and be some kind
of a decent human being,

726
00:40:34,517 --> 00:40:37,618
maybe even try
and help somebody out.

727
00:40:37,653 --> 00:40:39,487
What's the use?

728
00:40:39,522 --> 00:40:41,372
You don't even know
what i mean.

729
00:40:41,407 --> 00:40:42,373
You never wanted anything

730
00:40:42,408 --> 00:40:44,241
you couldn't whip up
in ten seconds

731
00:40:44,276 --> 00:40:47,378
in one of your
little machines.

732
00:40:48,629 --> 00:40:51,132
Once i did.

733
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:03,010
When i saw you leaving
peaceful valley.

734
00:41:05,513 --> 00:41:06,764
And i've thought
about you

735
00:41:06,799 --> 00:41:08,649
since then, philip.

736
00:41:11,152 --> 00:41:15,523
Even asleep, i've
thought about you.

737
00:41:15,558 --> 00:41:17,408
And it hurts.

738
00:41:17,443 --> 00:41:22,413
I don't know why,
but it hurts.

739
00:41:24,915 --> 00:41:27,418
Do you know why?

740
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,789
I think so.

741
00:41:31,824 --> 00:41:34,925
Then what is it?

742
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,045
We have machines
for so many things,

743
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:41,182
but i can't make
this feeling stop.

744
00:41:41,217 --> 00:41:43,684
And you won't, ellen.

745
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:46,804
Not on your machines.

746
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:50,558
Don't you people
ever fall in love?

747
00:41:55,563 --> 00:41:59,950
I never have until now.

748
00:41:59,985 --> 00:42:03,704
But-but now i want us
to be together, philip.

749
00:42:03,739 --> 00:42:06,207
Don't you want that?

750
00:42:10,578 --> 00:42:14,965
I could want that
very much in a real world.

751
00:42:20,588 --> 00:42:22,473
But not here.

752
00:42:22,508 --> 00:42:24,592
Look, i'm sorry, ellen.

753
00:42:24,627 --> 00:42:27,094
As long as i'm here
in peaceful valley,

754
00:42:27,129 --> 00:42:28,979
i just want
out.

755
00:43:18,279 --> 00:43:20,281
I want us to be together.

756
00:43:20,316 --> 00:43:22,533
All right, you wait here.

757
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:51,372
Put them back,
mr. Redfield.

758
00:44:51,407 --> 00:44:53,240
No.

759
00:44:53,991 --> 00:44:55,876
Do as i say.

760
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:46,677
Ellen, i want to tell you
what happened back there.

761
00:45:46,712 --> 00:45:48,545
It may change your mind
about coming with me.

762
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:50,431
No.

763
00:45:50,466 --> 00:45:52,933
Whatever it is,
i don't want to hear.

764
00:45:52,968 --> 00:45:54,184
You have the papers.

765
00:45:55,436 --> 00:45:57,304
Well, i know, but...

766
00:45:57,938 --> 00:45:59,807
have you seen them?

767
00:45:59,842 --> 00:46:01,058
No.

768
00:46:34,224 --> 00:46:36,727
You see what would happen,
mr. Redfield,

769
00:46:36,762 --> 00:46:39,730
if we gave our secret
to the outside world?

770
00:46:39,765 --> 00:46:42,850
The very first
thing you'd do
is make a weapon.

771
00:46:42,885 --> 00:46:44,735
You'd
kill with it.

772
00:46:44,770 --> 00:46:45,986
You tricked me.

773
00:46:46,737 --> 00:46:47,988
Yes.

774
00:46:50,607 --> 00:46:52,493
And you...

775
00:46:52,528 --> 00:46:56,246
everything a lie.

776
00:46:58,749 --> 00:47:00,617
Not everything, philip.

777
00:47:01,869 --> 00:47:03,754
She cooperated
because she thought

778
00:47:04,371 --> 00:47:06,256
you would prove
your good intentions...

779
00:47:06,291 --> 00:47:08,125
as i did.

780
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,260
My colleagues
were right.

781
00:47:10,295 --> 00:47:12,129
You're just like
the others.

782
00:47:12,164 --> 00:47:15,883
If the end is just,

783
00:47:15,918 --> 00:47:18,385
so are the means,
whatever they may be.

784
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:20,521
Pity.

785
00:47:20,556 --> 00:47:23,640
You have just lost paradise,
mr. Redfield,

786
00:47:23,675 --> 00:47:26,777
and you don't even know why.

787
00:47:26,812 --> 00:47:29,530
I did the right thing.

788
00:47:29,565 --> 00:47:31,398
I'd do it again.

789
00:47:31,433 --> 00:47:33,033
Of course.

790
00:47:33,068 --> 00:47:36,537
Now you're going to do
the same thing to me.

791
00:47:36,572 --> 00:47:37,788
Not quite.

792
00:47:37,823 --> 00:47:40,541
You will be executed, yes...

793
00:47:40,576 --> 00:47:43,043
but not in the same way.

794
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:46,163
I've been studying the law,
our law,

795
00:47:46,198 --> 00:47:48,665
and i believe i've found a way

796
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:50,918
that will satisfy
everybody.

797
00:47:50,953 --> 00:47:53,804
I... would have thought of it
long before, but...

798
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:56,924
please, try to appreciate
our position.

799
00:47:56,959 --> 00:47:58,809
Try to imagine a state

800
00:47:58,844 --> 00:48:01,311
that has carried
the death penalty on its books

801
00:48:01,346 --> 00:48:05,065
for hundreds of years
and has never had to invoke it.

802
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:06,934
That is the case here.

803
00:48:07,568 --> 00:48:13,190
You see, you were our
first prisoner, so to speak.

804
00:48:13,225 --> 00:48:16,827
You forced us
to examine our law.

805
00:48:28,088 --> 00:48:29,590
Good-bye, mr. Redfield.

806
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:31,592
I'm sorry to do this.

807
00:48:31,627 --> 00:48:34,711
I was becoming fond of you.

808
00:48:54,231 --> 00:48:56,733
$4.42 out of ten.

809
00:49:00,487 --> 00:49:04,875
There's five,
and five is ten.

810
00:49:04,910 --> 00:49:07,377
Sorry, i, uh, must have
dozed off there a second.

811
00:49:07,412 --> 00:49:10,497
That's what happens
when you drive too long.

812
00:49:10,532 --> 00:49:13,634
Yeah. You say bredon
is back this way, huh?

813
00:49:13,669 --> 00:49:14,251
80 miles.

814
00:49:18,173 --> 00:49:19,890
Shut up, rollie.

815
00:49:34,404 --> 00:49:36,273
Anything wrong?

816
00:49:38,408 --> 00:49:40,277
No, no, i, uh...

817
00:49:40,312 --> 00:49:42,779
thought i saw
somebody i knew, that's all.

818
00:49:42,814 --> 00:49:44,031
Wishful thinking, i guess.

819
00:49:44,066 --> 00:49:47,034
It's a nice little town
you got here.

820
00:49:47,069 --> 00:49:48,285
We like it.

821
00:49:50,205 --> 00:49:52,039
Can i just back in here?

822
00:49:52,074 --> 00:49:53,290
Yep.

823
00:49:53,325 --> 00:49:54,541
You've seen them.

824
00:49:54,576 --> 00:49:57,678
Little towns tucked away
far from the main roads.

825
00:49:57,713 --> 00:50:01,431
You've seen them, but
have you thought about them?

826
00:50:01,466 --> 00:50:03,433
Have you wondered what
the people do in such places,

827
00:50:03,468 --> 00:50:04,685
why they stay?

828
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:07,187
Philip redfield
thinks about them now

829
00:50:07,222 --> 00:50:10,807
and he wonders,
but only very late at night

830
00:50:10,842 --> 00:50:13,944
when he's between wakefulness
and sleep...

831
00:50:13,979 --> 00:50:16,446
in the twilight zone.

832
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:26,073
We move next ontwilight zone
into a shadowy area

833
00:50:26,108 --> 00:50:29,826
that treads a very thin line
between flesh and fantasy.

834
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:32,329
You'll see a performance
by dennis hopper that,

835
00:50:32,364 --> 00:50:34,214
even from my rather
close-in perspective,

836
00:50:34,831 --> 00:50:36,717
strikes me
as an exceptional one.

837
00:50:36,752 --> 00:50:38,969
Our story is called
"he's alive,"

838
00:50:39,004 --> 00:50:40,220
and if this doesn't
get you where you live,

839
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:42,723
you'll find it close by
in the suburbs.

840
00:50:42,758 --> 00:50:44,224
Need medical attention?

841
00:50:44,975 --> 00:50:46,843
We don't need any.

842
00:50:46,878 --> 00:50:49,346
Okay, jack.

843
00:50:50,597 --> 00:50:52,482
Hey, jack!

844
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:55,602
You forgot your, um...

845
00:50:55,637 --> 00:50:58,105
your flag.

846
00:51:02,492 --> 00:51:04,361
There'll come a day
when guys like you

847
00:51:04,396 --> 00:51:06,863
will crawl on your belly
just to salute this.

848
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:12,119
Who's out there?

849
00:51:12,154 --> 00:51:14,621
Who is it?

850
00:51:14,656 --> 00:51:17,124
A friend, mr. Vollmer.

851
00:51:17,159 --> 00:51:19,009
Come down,
mr. Vollmer.

852
00:51:19,044 --> 00:51:21,511
Come down, and we will talk.
