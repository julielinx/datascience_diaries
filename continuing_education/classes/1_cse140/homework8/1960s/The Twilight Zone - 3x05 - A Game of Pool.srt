1
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:12,262
You're traveling
through another dimension-

2
00:00:12,297 --> 00:00:15,398
a dimension not only of sight
and sound, but of mind,

3
00:00:15,433 --> 00:00:17,267
a journey into a wondrous land

4
00:00:17,302 --> 00:00:19,152
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

5
00:00:19,187 --> 00:00:22,272
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

6
00:00:34,784 --> 00:00:37,921
Yes!

7
00:00:37,956 --> 00:00:39,289
You see what i mean?

8
00:00:39,324 --> 00:00:41,174
Did you see that?

9
00:00:41,209 --> 00:00:44,928
The right english, the right
draw, perfect position, right?

10
00:00:44,963 --> 00:00:46,796
What do i get?

11
00:00:46,831 --> 00:00:49,933
Fats brown, that's what i get,
fats brown.

12
00:00:49,968 --> 00:00:52,435
Well, i'm sick of it.

13
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:54,554
I'm sick of hearing his name!

14
00:00:54,589 --> 00:00:57,057
I'm the best pool cue
on randolph street.

15
00:00:57,092 --> 00:00:59,559
Me, jesse cardiff,
and you know that!

16
00:00:59,594 --> 00:01:01,444
All right, all right...

17
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:02,695
fats was good.

18
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,564
I mean, hewasgood, right?

19
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:05,448
But he's dead.

20
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,951
You hear me? He's dead.

21
00:01:07,986 --> 00:01:10,453
He's been dead
for over 15 years,

22
00:01:10,488 --> 00:01:12,322
but every time i turn around
i hear his name!

23
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:17,961
"Oh, you're pretty good, jesse,
but fats is better.

24
00:01:17,996 --> 00:01:19,212
Fats is the best!"

25
00:01:19,247 --> 00:01:21,081
Fats, fats!

26
00:01:21,116 --> 00:01:23,583
I'll say it again-

27
00:01:23,618 --> 00:01:25,468
fats brown is dead!

28
00:01:25,503 --> 00:01:29,222
And buried in the ground.

29
00:01:29,257 --> 00:01:33,843
And if he was alive and
in this room i could beat him.

30
00:01:33,878 --> 00:01:35,095
I'd give anything...

31
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:37,597
anything to play him one game!

32
00:01:37,632 --> 00:01:43,603
Fats brown, fats brown,
report to lister's pool room

33
00:01:43,638 --> 00:01:46,106
randolph street, chicago.

34
00:01:46,141 --> 00:01:49,859
Fats brown, fats brown,

35
00:01:49,894 --> 00:01:55,498
lister's pool room,
randolph street, chicago.

36
00:01:55,533 --> 00:01:59,869
If you were here, fats brown,
i'd show you who was the best.

37
00:01:59,904 --> 00:02:01,121
One game, one lousy game...

38
00:02:01,156 --> 00:02:03,006
at your service.

39
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,018
Jesse cardiff, pool shark-

40
00:02:15,053 --> 00:02:16,886
the best on randolph street-

41
00:02:16,921 --> 00:02:20,640
who will soon learn that trying
to be the best at anything

42
00:02:20,675 --> 00:02:26,279
carries its own special risks
in or out of the twilight zone.

43
00:02:46,716 --> 00:02:48,585
You called?

44
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:54,224
Um, but you're...

45
00:02:54,259 --> 00:02:55,475
dead?

46
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:56,726
Not really.

47
00:02:56,761 --> 00:02:59,095
As long as people
talk about you,

48
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:00,346
you're not really dead.

49
00:03:00,381 --> 00:03:02,849
As long as they speak your name,
you continue.

50
00:03:02,884 --> 00:03:04,601
A legend
doesn't die

51
00:03:04,636 --> 00:03:07,103
just because
the man does.

52
00:03:07,138 --> 00:03:08,354
Oh, no...

53
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:09,606
no, it's impossible.

54
00:03:09,641 --> 00:03:11,491
Nothing's impossible.

55
00:03:11,526 --> 00:03:15,862
Some things are less likely
than others, that's all.

56
00:03:30,295 --> 00:03:31,511
It isn't a rib.

57
00:03:31,546 --> 00:03:32,762
I mean, it's you.

58
00:03:32,797 --> 00:03:34,013
You're...

59
00:03:34,048 --> 00:03:37,133
james howard brown,
known to my friends as "fats."

60
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,138
I know it's a shock,

61
00:03:42,173 --> 00:03:44,641
but you called me,
i didn't call you.

62
00:03:44,676 --> 00:03:47,777
Oh, well, i... i didn't
mean anything, see?

63
00:03:47,812 --> 00:03:50,280
I understand,
it was just big talk.

64
00:03:50,315 --> 00:03:51,531
Is that it?

65
00:03:51,566 --> 00:03:52,782
You like to play
with fire,

66
00:03:52,817 --> 00:03:54,651
but you don't
like to cook.

67
00:03:54,686 --> 00:03:56,536
You're not as good as you claim,
and you know it.

68
00:03:56,571 --> 00:03:57,787
Deep down, you know

69
00:03:57,822 --> 00:03:59,038
you're
second-rate.

70
00:03:59,073 --> 00:04:00,290
Now, wait a minute!

71
00:04:00,325 --> 00:04:02,792
Are you afraid?

72
00:04:02,827 --> 00:04:06,546
Look, i've come a long way, boy,
and not to be fooled with.

73
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:08,414
I've seen your kind before-

74
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:11,551
a little skill, a knack, style,

75
00:04:11,586 --> 00:04:13,419
but when the heat's on,
you fold.

76
00:04:13,454 --> 00:04:15,305
That isn't fair-
you never seen me play.

77
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,556
Maybe i can beat you.

78
00:04:16,591 --> 00:04:17,807
That's possible, isn't it?

79
00:04:17,842 --> 00:04:19,058
It's possible.

80
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:20,310
Things change.

81
00:04:20,345 --> 00:04:21,561
Records get higher.

82
00:04:21,596 --> 00:04:23,429
But you'll never get
the job done with your mouth.

83
00:04:23,464 --> 00:04:24,681
All right, fat boy,

84
00:04:24,716 --> 00:04:27,183
dead or alive,
let me tell you something.

85
00:04:27,218 --> 00:04:28,434
Maybe you are a
legend- a tin god.

86
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:30,320
You know what
you are to me?

87
00:04:30,355 --> 00:04:30,937
You're a big balloon

88
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:33,439
waiting for someone to
stick a needle in it.

89
00:04:33,474 --> 00:04:35,325
Well, i'm the someone
and here's the needle.

90
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,193
You're like all
the other legends.

91
00:04:37,228 --> 00:04:38,444
You live on
a reputation.

92
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:39,696
I heard a man swear

93
00:04:39,731 --> 00:04:41,581
that he saw you make
a nine-cushion bank.

94
00:04:41,616 --> 00:04:42,832
And you don't believe it?

95
00:04:42,867 --> 00:04:44,083
It's impossible.

96
00:04:44,118 --> 00:04:44,701
You hit the
ball that hard,

97
00:04:44,736 --> 00:04:45,952
it won't stay
on the table.

98
00:04:45,987 --> 00:04:48,454
He had more imagination
than brains, huh?

99
00:04:48,489 --> 00:04:50,340
Then you'll
play me?

100
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:51,591
Yeah.

101
00:04:51,626 --> 00:04:54,093
And what about
the stakes?

102
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:55,345
The stakes?

103
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:58,464
Something to make
the game interesting.

104
00:05:01,851 --> 00:05:03,102
Here, any
or all of it.

105
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,605
Come on,
use your wits, boy.

106
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,107
What good is money to me?

107
00:05:08,142 --> 00:05:09,976
Then what?

108
00:05:10,011 --> 00:05:13,730
Something to make my
long journey worthwhile.

109
00:05:13,765 --> 00:05:15,615
Name it.

110
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:19,369
You said you'd give
anything for a game with me.

111
00:05:19,404 --> 00:05:20,620
Anything?

112
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,991
What are you talking about,
mister?

113
00:05:25,026 --> 00:05:28,127
Just what kind of stakes
are you talking about?

114
00:05:28,162 --> 00:05:31,247
Life or death.

115
00:05:31,881 --> 00:05:34,384
You beat me and you live.

116
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:36,886
You lose and you die.

117
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:45,645
It's interesting
to see how much faith

118
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,513
you have
in yourself.

119
00:05:47,548 --> 00:05:48,765
You know something?

120
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,518
For my money, you don't want
to be the best bad enough, boy.

121
00:05:53,805 --> 00:05:55,655
Why, when i
was your age,

122
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:58,157
i would have jumped
at the chance.

123
00:05:58,192 --> 00:06:01,277
But then, i was
something better
than second-rate.

124
00:06:01,312 --> 00:06:04,163
You better watch yourself.

125
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:07,917
You know it takes more
than skill to be a champion.

126
00:06:07,952 --> 00:06:12,922
It takes equal parts of talent,
luck, work and nerve-

127
00:06:12,957 --> 00:06:15,425
a quality you sadly lack.

128
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,176
Nerve, you mean insanity.

129
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:19,679
Risk my life on a game of pool?

130
00:06:19,714 --> 00:06:20,930
Insanity,
if you prefer.

131
00:06:20,965 --> 00:06:22,799
I am just a pool player.

132
00:06:22,834 --> 00:06:25,935
There's probably no less
important thing on earth.

133
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,804
But mark this in your book-

134
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,055
i'm the best.

135
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:31,557
It's a proud thing
to be the best.

136
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:33,559
You wouldn't
know about that.

137
00:06:33,594 --> 00:06:34,193
Where you going?
I'm going back.

138
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:35,445
Wait.

139
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,947
You say i don't
want to be the best

140
00:06:37,982 --> 00:06:39,816
but you're wrong.

141
00:06:39,851 --> 00:06:41,317
Do you know how many hours,
how many years,

142
00:06:41,352 --> 00:06:43,202
how much of myself
i've put into this game?

143
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:45,705
How many nights i've slept
on that table right there?

144
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,206
I made a deal
with the owner

145
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:48,458
so i could
practice

146
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,326
after the
place closed.

147
00:06:50,361 --> 00:06:52,211
I haven't been
to the movies in years.

148
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:53,463
I haven't dated a girl,
read a book

149
00:06:53,498 --> 00:06:55,331
because it would take
time away from the game.

150
00:06:55,965 --> 00:06:57,333
Still talk and nothing else.

151
00:06:57,368 --> 00:06:59,218
I'm good, mister!

152
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:01,087
I'm...

153
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:02,972
i'm good.

154
00:07:05,475 --> 00:07:07,977
But am i that good?

155
00:07:08,012 --> 00:07:09,228
You'll really
never know

156
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:11,731
until you're ready
to risk everything.

157
00:07:11,766 --> 00:07:13,599
Look, will you
stop pushing, huh?

158
00:07:13,634 --> 00:07:15,485
You know,
where i come from,

159
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,736
there's a race driver.

160
00:07:16,771 --> 00:07:19,238
Go to the track
and whisper his name.

161
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:20,490
Say "tazio nuvolarl"

162
00:07:20,525 --> 00:07:22,992
and watch the heads
nod up and down.

163
00:07:23,027 --> 00:07:26,112
Or go to a bullring
and hear of manolete.

164
00:07:26,147 --> 00:07:27,997
Both men faced
death daily

165
00:07:28,032 --> 00:07:29,866
and both are legends.

166
00:07:29,901 --> 00:07:32,368
You never make
the grade at anything

167
00:07:32,403 --> 00:07:34,253
by playing it safe.

168
00:07:38,007 --> 00:07:40,510
Oh, boy, this is nutty.

169
00:07:40,545 --> 00:07:41,761
No.

170
00:07:41,796 --> 00:07:44,881
You accept
the terms-

171
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:47,383
life or death?

172
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:31,177
You know, the big game hunter
has his elephant gun.

173
00:08:31,212 --> 00:08:35,565
And the fencer,
he uses a blade from lima.

174
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,936
This cue was made for me
special, st. Louis.

175
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,072
Cost $600.

176
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:48,694
Yep, i made my living with it
for 35 years.

177
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:54,333
Name the game.

178
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:56,202
Rotation?

179
00:08:56,237 --> 00:08:58,087
Kelly.

180
00:08:58,122 --> 00:09:00,590
14.1 rack.

181
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:01,841
8-ball.

182
00:09:01,876 --> 00:09:03,709
Well, let's

183
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:05,595
let's see
how good you really are.

184
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:08,714
Uh, 14.1 rack,
one game, 300 points.

185
00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:10,600
You got a coin?

186
00:09:10,635 --> 00:09:12,969
Toss for break?

187
00:09:13,004 --> 00:09:14,220
You call it.

188
00:09:14,255 --> 00:09:16,722
Tails.

189
00:09:16,757 --> 00:09:18,357
Change your mind?

190
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:19,609
You can, you know.

191
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:26,732
Heads-

192
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:28,618
my break.

193
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:48,220
I know what you're
thinking, son-

194
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:50,723
"the man who breaks
is at a disadvantage.

195
00:09:50,758 --> 00:09:51,974
"Once he scatters
the balls

196
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:54,477
the other man
has a clear field."

197
00:09:54,512 --> 00:09:55,728
Sure.

198
00:09:56,979 --> 00:09:58,230
Safe.

199
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,741
Wow.

200
00:10:08,776 --> 00:10:09,992
Two balls
into the rail-

201
00:10:10,027 --> 00:10:12,495
a perfect break and
no advantage given.

202
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:14,997
Now it's you turn
to scatter them.

203
00:10:20,002 --> 00:10:21,253
Safe.

204
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:31,764
Do something
with that.

205
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,779
15 ball in the corner pocket.

206
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:53,653
There's a funny thing-

207
00:10:53,688 --> 00:10:55,538
i was thinking if i sink it,

208
00:10:55,573 --> 00:10:58,541
you're really in trouble.

209
00:10:58,576 --> 00:11:00,793
With luck, i can run the table.

210
00:11:00,828 --> 00:11:03,295
And if you miss, you
leave me wide open.

211
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,427
Nine ball in the corner.

212
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,815
Ten ball, three cushion,
in the side.

213
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:32,191
How about that, fat boy?

214
00:11:32,226 --> 00:11:33,826
Not bad.

215
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,079
That was great.

216
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,199
You're like all the others.

217
00:11:40,234 --> 00:11:42,084
When i was a kid, i knew
a lot of guys like you.

218
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:43,953
Guys who were
good at things

219
00:11:43,988 --> 00:11:45,204
like music
and basketball.

220
00:11:45,239 --> 00:11:47,089
Guys who would
do anything

221
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:48,958
to make me feel
about that big.

222
00:11:48,993 --> 00:11:50,843
But you fooled
them, right?

223
00:11:50,878 --> 00:11:53,345
Yeah, i did,
that's right.

224
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,214
I did.

225
00:11:55,249 --> 00:11:57,717
Two ball in the corner pocket.

226
00:11:57,752 --> 00:12:00,603
I knew there was something
i could be good at.

227
00:12:00,638 --> 00:12:03,723
One day, i was about 16,
i wandered into here.

228
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:05,608
It was cool
and dark

229
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,110
like... like
being underwater.

230
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:09,979
I used to come back.
I used to watch them play.

231
00:12:10,014 --> 00:12:12,481
One day i picked up a cue,
i asked an old man,

232
00:12:12,516 --> 00:12:14,366
he was sitting right over there,
right there,

233
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:16,235
i said,
"you want to play, mister?"

234
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,486
And i beat him.

235
00:12:17,521 --> 00:12:21,240
The first time i ever played
him, and i beat him!

236
00:12:21,275 --> 00:12:23,125
I knew i had an eye
for this game.

237
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:29,381
What happened to it?

238
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,250
I almost made it.

239
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:39,258
Funny thing, in geometry,
"almost" isn't enough.

240
00:12:39,293 --> 00:12:41,143
Geometry?
Mm-hmm.

241
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:45,514
Pool is geometry...

242
00:12:45,549 --> 00:12:47,399
in its most
challenging form-

243
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:51,771
a science of precise angles
and forces.

244
00:12:56,158 --> 00:12:58,661
14 in the end pocket.

245
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,534
Angles and
forces, huh?

246
00:13:05,569 --> 00:13:08,037
You sewed yourself up
pretty good.

247
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,801
13 ball...

248
00:13:21,836 --> 00:13:24,303
corner pocket.

249
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:27,306
Ha!

250
00:13:29,191 --> 00:13:30,943
Your shot.

251
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,949
Six, corner.

252
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:38,200
Four, corner.

253
00:13:40,703 --> 00:13:41,954
Twelve.

254
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,215
13 in the corner pocket.

255
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,220
Four ball, corner.

256
00:14:00,723 --> 00:14:01,974
Two ball, corner.

257
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:10,099
Five ball in the side.

258
00:14:25,748 --> 00:14:27,616
15 in the side pocket.

259
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,888
I've got 59, you've
got seven points.

260
00:14:48,923 --> 00:14:51,390
The game is young yet,
very young.

261
00:14:51,425 --> 00:14:53,275
Rack them up.

262
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,044
One ball, end pocket.

263
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,055
Seven.

264
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:28,677
Five.

265
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:33,315
Eleven.

266
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:39,438
Eight.

267
00:16:08,851 --> 00:16:12,604
Ten ball
in the corner pocket.

268
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,996
You needed those
four balls to win.

269
00:16:37,031 --> 00:16:38,247
See the score?

270
00:16:38,282 --> 00:16:39,498
I got 299, you got 296.

271
00:16:39,533 --> 00:16:42,001
Yeah, yeah,
i see the score.

272
00:16:42,036 --> 00:16:43,886
Well, i need
that one to win.

273
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:47,006
You need all of them.

274
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,142
Just that one.

275
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,518
Bank the five...

276
00:16:59,553 --> 00:17:01,403
in the corner.

277
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:44,563
You know something,
jesse?

278
00:17:44,598 --> 00:17:47,066
There's more to life
than this pool hall.

279
00:17:47,101 --> 00:17:50,819
It isn't right, your being
all cooped up in here.

280
00:17:50,854 --> 00:17:53,322
You ought to
get out a little

281
00:17:53,357 --> 00:17:54,323
see what's going on.

282
00:17:54,358 --> 00:17:56,825
You didn't get to be the best
sitting on a park bench.

283
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:59,328
You spent a lot of time
with that cue in your hands.

284
00:17:59,363 --> 00:18:00,579
Of course
i did.

285
00:18:00,614 --> 00:18:03,082
But i took time out
to live, too.

286
00:18:03,117 --> 00:18:06,218
I've been places where
they never heard of billiards.

287
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:08,087
15 ball in the corner pocket.

288
00:18:08,122 --> 00:18:10,589
I may not
look the part, jesse,

289
00:18:10,624 --> 00:18:11,840
but i made love,

290
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:14,343
walked uphill,
swam in the ocean...

291
00:18:14,378 --> 00:18:17,479
when i think of
the wonderful things there are

292
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:19,982
to see and to do, it hurts me-

293
00:18:20,017 --> 00:18:21,600
yeah-

294
00:18:21,635 --> 00:18:24,103
to see you rotting
your life away

295
00:18:24,138 --> 00:18:25,988
in this miserable,
dark hall.

296
00:18:26,023 --> 00:18:27,239
You're lying.

297
00:18:27,274 --> 00:18:29,108
You're trying
to distract me.

298
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:31,610
That's a lousy
thing to do.

299
00:18:31,645 --> 00:18:33,495
15 in the corner.

300
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,012
You made
me do that!

301
00:18:50,047 --> 00:18:50,629
You made me miss!

302
00:18:50,664 --> 00:18:53,132
Aw, come on,
a little gamesmanship,

303
00:18:53,167 --> 00:18:55,017
a little fun
and you come apart.

304
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:58,770
Kid stuff to make you
break your concentration

305
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:00,022
and you get wild.

306
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,302
There it is-

307
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:32,171
the game ball.

308
00:19:32,206 --> 00:19:35,924
All my life i've been
waiting for this, it's...

309
00:19:35,959 --> 00:19:38,560
it's a pocket hanger.

310
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:40,929
I sink that...

311
00:19:40,964 --> 00:19:43,432
i become the greatest.

312
00:19:44,066 --> 00:19:45,934
If you sink it.

313
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:47,819
You're sweating.

314
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:49,071
Why you so
nervous?

315
00:19:49,106 --> 00:19:52,824
Oh, for reasons i'm afraid
you wouldn't understand.

316
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:54,693
I understand all right.

317
00:19:54,728 --> 00:19:56,578
It means a lot, doesn't it?

318
00:19:56,613 --> 00:19:57,829
Even as a dead man...

319
00:19:57,864 --> 00:19:59,448
have your name
up there-

320
00:19:59,483 --> 00:20:01,333
"the unbeatable
champ of all times!"

321
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:03,202
Carries certain
satisfactions.

322
00:20:03,237 --> 00:20:05,704
"I'll give you a
chance at my crown,

323
00:20:05,739 --> 00:20:08,207
but only if you stake
your life on the game!"

324
00:20:08,242 --> 00:20:10,709
Couldn't be a nice
friendly, little game!

325
00:20:10,744 --> 00:20:12,594
I take them as i find them.

326
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:15,714
To you, pool is not
a nice, friendly game.

327
00:20:15,749 --> 00:20:18,217
It's a win-at-any-price affair.

328
00:20:18,252 --> 00:20:20,102
I acted accordingly.

329
00:20:20,137 --> 00:20:21,470
It didn't do you any good.

330
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,973
There's still one
ball on the table

331
00:20:25,008 --> 00:20:28,110
and it's taking you a mighty
long time to get at it.

332
00:20:28,145 --> 00:20:29,978
Why?

333
00:20:30,013 --> 00:20:32,481
You wouldn't believe
this, jesse,

334
00:20:32,516 --> 00:20:35,617
but personally,
i'd like to see you win.

335
00:20:35,652 --> 00:20:36,868
Yeah.

336
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:39,871
Believe me,
i've only been doing my job.

337
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:42,374
Someone has to keep the flame.

338
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:46,745
Someone has to weed out those
who haven't got what it takes.

339
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:49,248
You see, the champions,
the legends,

340
00:20:49,283 --> 00:20:51,133
they serve as a purpose,

341
00:20:51,168 --> 00:20:54,886
a challenge,
an incentive.

342
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:56,755
I don't need a challenge.

343
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:59,258
Everyone needs a challenge,
jesse-

344
00:20:59,293 --> 00:21:02,394
someone great
out of the past to say,

345
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:06,148
"match what i've done, boy,
and make it better."

346
00:21:06,183 --> 00:21:09,268
That's true in all
walks of life-

347
00:21:09,303 --> 00:21:12,404
music, politics, sports,
you name it.

348
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:15,524
Me- i'm only a pool player,

349
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:17,409
but i'm the best.

350
00:21:17,444 --> 00:21:19,528
Youwerethe best.

351
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,166
Wait a minute, jesse.

352
00:21:24,201 --> 00:21:25,417
Before you shoot,

353
00:21:25,452 --> 00:21:27,286
think of this-
shoot that ball,

354
00:21:27,321 --> 00:21:30,422
and you may win more
than you bargained for.

355
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:33,792
There's nothing you can say
that will stop me.

356
00:21:33,827 --> 00:21:35,043
Nothing.

357
00:21:35,078 --> 00:21:36,295
I'm sorry.

358
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:38,797
I was required to say that.

359
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:00,952
Win more than i
bargained for, huh?

360
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:02,821
No... i beat you.

361
00:22:02,856 --> 00:22:04,706
I'm the best.

362
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:07,826
I'm the best
at something.

363
00:22:07,861 --> 00:22:10,329
Thanks.

364
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:14,716
What do you
mean, "thanks"?

365
00:22:14,751 --> 00:22:17,836
I beat you, i'm the best,
and i'm going to live.

366
00:22:17,871 --> 00:22:20,339
Of course you are,
those were the stakes.

367
00:22:20,374 --> 00:22:22,841
Then what's with
the thanks, fat boy?

368
00:22:22,876 --> 00:22:25,344
You'll find out
when the time comes

369
00:22:25,379 --> 00:22:27,229
for you to leave
randolph street.

370
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,349
You sore loser.

371
00:22:30,384 --> 00:22:32,234
I beat you.

372
00:22:32,269 --> 00:22:34,102
I beat you fair and square.

373
00:22:34,137 --> 00:22:35,987
Take...

374
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:45,364
hey.

375
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,500
Come on.

376
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,380
Well, you saw it, didn't you?

377
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:07,636
I beat the king of the hill,
fats brown!

378
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:11,390
Me...

379
00:23:11,425 --> 00:23:13,892
jesse cardiff.

380
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:17,646
And now i'm the best.

381
00:23:17,681 --> 00:23:20,782
And i'm going to stay the best

382
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:25,153
because nobody is ever going
to take it away from me.

383
00:23:25,188 --> 00:23:26,405
Nobody ever!

384
00:23:30,792 --> 00:23:33,912
It's me, jesse cardiff,
you hear?

385
00:23:33,947 --> 00:23:35,797
Jesse cardiff, jesse cardiff!

386
00:23:35,832 --> 00:23:38,300
Jesse cardiff,
jesse cardiff...

387
00:23:38,335 --> 00:23:43,922
jesse cardiff, jesse cardiff,
jesse cardiff.

388
00:23:43,957 --> 00:23:48,927
Report at once to mason's
pool hall, sandusky, ohio.

389
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:53,315
Mr. Jesse cardiff, who became
a legend by beating one,

390
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:55,183
but who has found out
after his funeral

391
00:23:55,218 --> 00:23:57,068
that being the best of anything

392
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:58,937
carries with it
a special an obligation

393
00:23:58,972 --> 00:23:59,571
to keep on proving it.

394
00:23:59,606 --> 00:24:01,440
Mr. Fats brown,
on the other hand,

395
00:24:01,475 --> 00:24:03,325
having relinquished
the champion's mantle,

396
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,193
has gone fishing.

397
00:24:05,228 --> 00:24:08,947
These are the ground rules
in the twilight zone.

398
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,421

and next week is no exception.

This is the story of a tyrant
and his assassins,

408
00:24:38,512 --> 00:24:42,230
a shattered dream
and the death of a cause.

409
00:24:42,265 --> 00:24:45,984
