1
00:00:10,512 --> 00:00:12,362
You're traveling
through another dimension-

2
00:00:12,397 --> 00:00:16,116
a dimension not only of sight
and sound, but of mind,

3
00:00:16,151 --> 00:00:17,984
a journey into a wondrous land

4
00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:19,869
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

5
00:00:19,904 --> 00:00:22,989
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

6
00:01:01,277 --> 00:01:03,163
What's happening?

7
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:09,419
Well, i think he's dead.

8
00:01:09,454 --> 00:01:12,288
I believe
it's salvador.

9
00:01:13,673 --> 00:01:15,542
Where is the telegrapher?

10
00:01:15,577 --> 00:01:17,544
Parece que esta muerto.

11
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:19,679
Quien es?

12
00:01:19,714 --> 00:01:20,296
Es salvador.

13
00:01:20,331 --> 00:01:22,799
Rudolfo...

14
00:01:24,684 --> 00:01:26,553
rudolfo, i wish
to send a telegram.

15
00:01:26,588 --> 00:01:27,804
Telegram now?

16
00:01:27,839 --> 00:01:29,055
But this is
after hours.

17
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:31,558
What's the matter
with you, sanchez?

18
00:01:31,593 --> 00:01:33,443
Please, do you know
what time it is?

19
00:01:33,478 --> 00:01:34,694
I close at 4:00.

20
00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:36,563
For 23 years,
i close at 4:00.

21
00:01:36,598 --> 00:01:37,814
Because you are
a policeman,

22
00:01:37,849 --> 00:01:39,699
you think you got
the privilege to...?

23
00:01:41,236 --> 00:01:42,952
Salvador?

24
00:01:44,821 --> 00:01:47,323
How?

25
00:01:47,358 --> 00:01:49,826
I will send a telegram;
it will explain.

26
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:53,463
You will
tell it to me?

27
00:01:53,498 --> 00:01:55,331
I will tell
it to you.

28
00:01:55,366 --> 00:01:57,217
Send it as
i tell it.

29
00:02:00,336 --> 00:02:03,473
To the prefect of
police, state capital.

30
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:04,724
Prefect of police?

31
00:02:05,341 --> 00:02:07,227
Send it, rudolfo,
send it!

32
00:02:07,262 --> 00:02:08,478
Don't censor it!

33
00:02:10,346 --> 00:02:15,735
Unidentified aircraft-
or something-

34
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:21,991
crashed into the hills north
of our village late last night.

35
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:25,745
Object is metal
and circular.

36
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:30,116
Officer emmanuel salvador
and myself

37
00:02:30,151 --> 00:02:35,755
investigated the
scene of the crash.

38
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:40,510
Found evidence of footprints
and broken brush.

39
00:02:40,545 --> 00:02:43,012
Salvador
followed same.

40
00:02:43,047 --> 00:02:44,881
I heard
several shots.

41
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:49,886
Found body of
officer salvador.

42
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:52,639
Say that i followed the
figure of the monster

43
00:02:52,674 --> 00:02:54,524
in the darkness.

44
00:02:59,529 --> 00:03:01,397
I fired several shots.

45
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,535
I believe i wounded
whoever it...

46
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:07,537
whateverit was.

47
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:10,039
The place is mexico,

48
00:03:10,074 --> 00:03:12,542
just across the texas border.

49
00:03:12,577 --> 00:03:16,296
A mountain village held back
in time by its remoteness,

50
00:03:16,331 --> 00:03:19,415
and suddenly intruded upon
by the 20th century.

51
00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:21,918
And this is pedro,
nine years old-

52
00:03:21,953 --> 00:03:23,169
a lonely, rootless little boy

53
00:03:23,204 --> 00:03:25,672
who will soon
make the acquaintance

54
00:03:25,707 --> 00:03:27,557
of a traveler
from a distant place.

55
00:03:27,592 --> 00:03:30,677
We are at present 40 miles
from the rio grande,

56
00:03:30,712 --> 00:03:35,064
but any place and all places
can be the twilight zone.

57
00:03:58,755 --> 00:04:00,623
Who did it, sanchez?

58
00:04:00,658 --> 00:04:02,508
Please, doctor,
i do not know.

59
00:04:02,543 --> 00:04:05,628
Some, some giant thing
escaped in the darkness.

60
00:04:05,663 --> 00:04:08,131
I fired several
shots, and...

61
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:10,016
later, i found
some bloodstains.

62
00:04:10,051 --> 00:04:13,770
They're sending some army
men from the state capitol.

63
00:04:13,805 --> 00:04:15,638
They will take over.

64
00:04:15,673 --> 00:04:16,272
Some "giant thing"?

65
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:18,775
Not the darkness,
or perhaps your fear?

66
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:20,026
You doubt me, doctor?

67
00:04:20,061 --> 00:04:23,146
No, you're the law and order
in this village, sanchez.

68
00:04:23,181 --> 00:04:24,397
Be the sanity as well.

69
00:04:24,432 --> 00:04:26,282
You have frightened
all these people.

70
00:04:26,317 --> 00:04:28,151
I just want to make sure

71
00:04:28,186 --> 00:04:30,653
that the source of the fear
is not an illusion.

72
00:04:30,688 --> 00:04:33,156
This, doctor- is
this an illusion?!

73
00:04:33,191 --> 00:04:35,658
All right, go to
your homes, everybody,

74
00:04:35,693 --> 00:04:36,909
and lock your doors.

75
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:39,412
I want no one on
the streets tonight.

76
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:45,668
We're in danger.

77
00:04:45,703 --> 00:04:46,302
I found all i
wanted to know.

78
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:48,171
Take the body
to the priest now.

79
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:58,931
Drink up, doctor;
i want to close now.

80
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:00,183
I have no doubt.

81
00:05:00,218 --> 00:05:02,068
What stalks
the night, manolo?

82
00:05:02,103 --> 00:05:03,936
What stalks the night?

83
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:06,439
Whatever it is, i
want my place locked...

84
00:05:06,474 --> 00:05:07,690
thank you for coming,

85
00:05:07,725 --> 00:05:09,826
stargazer.

86
00:05:09,861 --> 00:05:12,328
I am cursed
in my old age

87
00:05:12,363 --> 00:05:16,082
by having
this astronomer
on my payroll.

88
00:05:16,117 --> 00:05:18,084
Still looking at
the stars, pedro?

89
00:05:18,119 --> 00:05:19,335
So, what do you learn

90
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:20,203
from the
stars, eh?

91
00:05:20,238 --> 00:05:21,454
Have they
ever told you

92
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:23,339
to sweep this
place properly

93
00:05:23,374 --> 00:05:25,208
or to clean
a glass?

94
00:05:25,243 --> 00:05:27,710
It is said there is life
on some of them.

95
00:05:27,745 --> 00:05:28,961
Oh, this is a fact?

96
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:31,464
Then you and the
man in the moon

97
00:05:31,499 --> 00:05:32,715
have nothing in common,

98
00:05:33,349 --> 00:05:35,218
because you
aren't alive.

99
00:05:35,253 --> 00:05:37,103
Here, go get
some water

100
00:05:37,138 --> 00:05:38,971
and come
right back.

101
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:41,724
Doors should be
locked tonight.

102
00:05:44,227 --> 00:05:46,112
He's a strange little boy.

103
00:05:46,147 --> 00:05:47,363
Where'd he come from?

104
00:05:47,398 --> 00:05:49,232
Who knows?

105
00:05:49,267 --> 00:05:51,234
He's son of abracero,
it is said.

106
00:05:51,269 --> 00:05:53,736
The authorities are in
here three times a week

107
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:56,239
asking me why he
does not attend school.

108
00:05:56,274 --> 00:05:57,490
They ask me, ha!

109
00:05:57,525 --> 00:05:58,741
The boy is not of my flesh.

110
00:05:59,242 --> 00:05:59,876
I know nothing of him.

111
00:05:59,911 --> 00:06:02,378
He cleans the place for me
and serves table,

112
00:06:02,413 --> 00:06:04,247
and he has a room in the back.

113
00:06:04,282 --> 00:06:07,133
Hey, i overpay him,
believe me,

114
00:06:07,168 --> 00:06:09,001
but i am not
such a rich man

115
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:10,887
that i can
certainly afford

116
00:06:10,922 --> 00:06:12,138
to run an orphanage

117
00:06:12,173 --> 00:06:14,006
for little
street urchins.

118
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,892
He doesn't have
any friends, does he?

119
00:06:15,927 --> 00:06:17,143
Him? Why should he?

120
00:06:17,178 --> 00:06:19,011
He has a mind
like an old man.

121
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:20,263
He's not normal.

122
00:06:20,298 --> 00:06:21,514
Go look for him
out in the night,

123
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:24,016
and you'll see him
standing there

124
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:25,268
looking up
at the sky.

125
00:06:25,303 --> 00:06:27,153
Did you ever
see him smile?

126
00:06:27,188 --> 00:06:27,904
I ask
you this.

127
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:29,772
Did you ever
see him smile?

128
00:06:30,406 --> 00:06:32,275
Why would he smile, the boy?

129
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,526
What is there

130
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:35,278
to delight
him?

131
00:06:35,912 --> 00:06:37,163
His poverty?

132
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:40,917
Why should he smile?

133
00:06:40,952 --> 00:06:42,168
Perhaps, manolo...

134
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:45,037
perhaps on
some occasion,

135
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:46,923
some festive
occasion,

136
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:51,294
instead of handing him
a broom or a tray,

137
00:06:51,329 --> 00:06:53,796
extend him a hand.

138
00:06:58,184 --> 00:07:01,938
Keep the boy inside
tonight, manolo.

139
00:07:01,973 --> 00:07:03,940
Shall i see you home, ignacio?

140
00:07:03,975 --> 00:07:05,191
No, thank you,
pedro.

141
00:07:05,808 --> 00:07:09,562
With me, darkness is a friend.

142
00:07:09,597 --> 00:07:12,064
But you stay inside.

143
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:18,454
I'm locking up
now, doctor.

144
00:07:18,489 --> 00:07:20,323
I must ask you
to leave.

145
00:07:25,962 --> 00:07:27,213
So, manolo...

146
00:07:27,248 --> 00:07:30,333
my friend,
wear a smile,

147
00:07:30,368 --> 00:07:32,835
and you'll doubtless live
to see the morning.

148
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:50,987
Are you still open?

149
00:07:53,489 --> 00:07:56,609
I thought perhaps i
could have some wine.

150
00:08:00,997 --> 00:08:03,115
¯como estas?

151
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,001
Bien.

152
00:08:05,036 --> 00:08:06,869
Please
sit down, sir.

153
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:08,120
I will get
you wine.

154
00:08:14,377 --> 00:08:17,513
I am sorry, senor,
but the place is closed.

155
00:08:17,548 --> 00:08:20,016
We are closed now,
and no longer serving.

156
00:08:20,051 --> 00:08:21,267
There is a curfew.

157
00:08:21,302 --> 00:08:23,135
Is this not
true, doctor?

158
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:26,889
Is there not
a curfew on?

159
00:08:27,523 --> 00:08:30,026
I won't stay but a moment.

160
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:33,896
Just...
long enough

161
00:08:33,931 --> 00:08:35,781
for a drink
of wine.

162
00:08:36,032 --> 00:08:41,654
I... i'm ill, i think.

163
00:08:41,689 --> 00:08:45,408
But i promise you i won't stay.

164
00:08:45,443 --> 00:08:47,293
Please.

165
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:17,189
That's not wine.

166
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:20,326
The bottle
didn't break,

167
00:09:20,361 --> 00:09:21,827
so it couldn't be...

168
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:29,585
i didn't want
to hurt him.

169
00:09:32,088 --> 00:09:34,590
He gave me
no choice.

170
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:38,344
I must explain.

171
00:09:38,379 --> 00:09:39,595
Please...

172
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:43,966
please...
listen to me for a moment.

173
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:47,720
I tried to explain before

174
00:09:47,755 --> 00:09:50,106
to that policeman
or soldier,

175
00:09:50,141 --> 00:09:51,357
or whoever it was.

176
00:09:51,392 --> 00:09:55,111
I tried to tell him
that i came in peace.

177
00:09:55,146 --> 00:09:58,230
He wanted to kill me.

178
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:02,618
I tried to get the gun
away from him,

179
00:10:02,653 --> 00:10:05,121
and it went off
against his body.

180
00:10:05,156 --> 00:10:10,126
And then the man who came
afterwards kept firing at me.

181
00:10:10,161 --> 00:10:13,245
Please... please...

182
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:15,131
please...

183
00:10:22,638 --> 00:10:25,758
you'll be all right soon.

184
00:10:25,793 --> 00:10:28,260
The doctor has said so.

185
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:30,763
He will make you all well again.

186
00:10:30,798 --> 00:10:34,517
It's very odd, pedro,
very odd, indeed,

187
00:10:34,552 --> 00:10:37,019
that there's
only one person

188
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:40,156
who feels neither
fear nor anger,

189
00:10:40,191 --> 00:10:41,907
and this is a boy.

190
00:10:41,942 --> 00:10:43,776
It is because we are alike.

191
00:10:43,811 --> 00:10:45,661
You are a stranger,

192
00:10:45,696 --> 00:10:48,164
and in a way,
i am a stranger, too.

193
00:10:48,199 --> 00:10:50,666
Pedro, the poncho...

194
00:10:50,701 --> 00:10:52,535
what?

195
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:55,037
In the pocket.

196
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:56,288
Get it.

197
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:04,930
It's a gift.

198
00:11:04,965 --> 00:11:05,798
Put it away.

199
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:07,049
I'll tell you later on.

200
00:11:22,064 --> 00:11:23,699
For a badly wounded man,

201
00:11:23,734 --> 00:11:26,819
you have
a strangely willful pulse.

202
00:11:30,573 --> 00:11:31,824
I might go a step further

203
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:35,578
and say that i wish mine
sounded like yours does.

204
00:11:39,215 --> 00:11:41,584
Pedro, bring the lamp
close to the bed.

205
00:11:41,619 --> 00:11:43,469
Si, doctor.

206
00:12:00,102 --> 00:12:01,987
Ether?

207
00:12:02,022 --> 00:12:03,856
I'm going to start
digging in there

208
00:12:03,891 --> 00:12:06,358
for at least
30 minutes.

209
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:08,244
No anesthetic, doctor.

210
00:12:12,114 --> 00:12:13,749
Pedro, i think
this is a good time

211
00:12:13,784 --> 00:12:16,252
for you to go out
and look at the stars.

212
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:24,376
You have a good
friend, senor.

213
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:28,130
Doctor, you must
give him something.

214
00:12:31,267 --> 00:12:33,135
Pedro, i will
tell you something.

215
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,020
I'm a very
obliging man,

216
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:38,774
but your friend does not
want the pain deadened.

217
00:12:38,809 --> 00:12:41,894
And i always say, every
man to his own taste.

218
00:13:13,676 --> 00:13:16,178
Whiskey. If not the best,
make it the strongest.

219
00:13:19,315 --> 00:13:21,817
The stranger
travels light.

220
00:13:21,852 --> 00:13:25,571
Just the clothes
on his back, and...

221
00:13:25,606 --> 00:13:27,439
and these inside
his chest.

222
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:29,942
He was very brave, doctor.

223
00:13:29,977 --> 00:13:32,444
Not a sound from him.

224
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:36,198
Not so much as a cry
all that time.

225
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:38,083
Yes, very brave.

226
00:13:38,118 --> 00:13:39,952
Pedro, come here.

227
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:49,962
What else do you
know of him, pedro?

228
00:13:50,346 --> 00:13:54,099
I know nothing else
except that he is my friend.

229
00:13:54,134 --> 00:13:56,602
Yes, this may be true,

230
00:13:56,637 --> 00:14:02,224
but it does not
explain the man, does it?

231
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:04,109
For example, it does not explain

232
00:14:04,144 --> 00:14:07,229
how a man can have
two bullets inside his body

233
00:14:07,264 --> 00:14:10,366
and have them removed
without a whimper.

234
00:14:10,401 --> 00:14:11,617
It does not explain

235
00:14:11,652 --> 00:14:13,485
how this
man's pulse

236
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,737
can be as strong
and as steady

237
00:14:14,772 --> 00:14:17,239
as if there was
nothing else wrong
with him than a cold.

238
00:14:17,873 --> 00:14:20,993
And it does not explain
why this man is alive

239
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:23,495
when he should be dead.

240
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,998
We got to him
just in time, doctor.

241
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:27,883
No, pedro.

242
00:14:27,918 --> 00:14:31,637
We got to him about
three hours too late.

243
00:14:31,672 --> 00:14:33,505
We got to him
where by the laws

244
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,391
of every book
on common sense

245
00:14:35,426 --> 00:14:37,259
he should have
bled to death.

246
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:38,510
But he didn't.

247
00:14:42,264 --> 00:14:44,149
So, stay by
your friend, huh?

248
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:45,768
And look
after him.

249
00:14:45,803 --> 00:14:47,653
Si, doctor.

250
00:14:52,908 --> 00:14:54,159
Manolo.

251
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:05,287
When i was in there,
i heard the door unlock.

252
00:15:05,322 --> 00:15:08,424
Oh, i...
i went out, doctor.

253
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:11,043
I went out to tell sanchez
that when the army came,

254
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:12,928
they would not
have to go walking

255
00:15:12,963 --> 00:15:14,797
through the hills at night.

256
00:15:15,431 --> 00:15:19,184
They would only have to come
here to find what they want.

257
00:15:19,219 --> 00:15:23,555
At your baptism, they forgot
to give you a proper name.

258
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:28,060
What would that be, doctor?

259
00:15:29,445 --> 00:15:31,947
That would be judas, manolo.

260
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:11,153
You must be tired, pedro.

261
00:16:11,188 --> 00:16:12,655
It doesn't
matter, senor.

262
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:14,523
I can sleep
anytime.

263
00:16:14,558 --> 00:16:16,659
Now you
must sleep.

264
00:16:16,694 --> 00:16:19,161
You have a poet, pedro.

265
00:16:19,196 --> 00:16:21,664
I read him- robert burns.

266
00:16:21,699 --> 00:16:26,035
He said, "the best-laid schemes
o' mice and men

267
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:27,920
gang aft a-gley..."

268
00:16:29,171 --> 00:16:31,674
like my plans.

269
00:16:31,709 --> 00:16:35,427
I came here to give, and
all i've done is to take-

270
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:38,297
your bed, your room.

271
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:40,799
Even my clothes-
i stole them.

272
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:47,806
I've often wondered why it is
that men fear the unknown.

273
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:50,309
Like children,
they're afraid of the dark.

274
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,811
The only person

275
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:54,697
i've met

276
00:16:54,732 --> 00:16:56,565
who isn't afraid
of the dark

277
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,450
is a child.

278
00:16:58,485 --> 00:17:00,953
Because i am an odd one.

279
00:17:00,988 --> 00:17:03,455
We are both odd ones,
mr. Williams.

280
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:06,575
You come from a long way off,
don't you?

281
00:17:09,078 --> 00:17:10,329
From the stars?

282
00:17:10,364 --> 00:17:13,832
From beyond the stars, pedro.

283
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:15,718
For a reason?

284
00:17:15,753 --> 00:17:17,586
For many reasons.

285
00:17:17,621 --> 00:17:19,972
And this thing
you've given me...

286
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:21,840
just a gift.

287
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,726
A gesture, really.

288
00:17:23,761 --> 00:17:26,228
A small gift
to show them

289
00:17:26,263 --> 00:17:28,097
that i came
as a visitor

290
00:17:28,132 --> 00:17:29,982
not an invader.

291
00:17:30,017 --> 00:17:32,484
I must get back
to my ship, pedro

292
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:34,353
see if i can repair it.

293
00:17:34,388 --> 00:17:35,854
And then
i must leave.

294
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:37,106
For good, senor?

295
00:17:37,141 --> 00:17:38,991
For good and all?

296
00:17:39,026 --> 00:17:42,111
Oh, no, pedro,
there's no such thing

297
00:17:42,146 --> 00:17:43,996
as "for good and all."

298
00:17:44,031 --> 00:17:45,864
There is only forever.

299
00:17:47,116 --> 00:17:50,252
I will come back sometime...

300
00:17:50,287 --> 00:17:52,121
or others like me.

301
00:17:52,156 --> 00:17:55,124
Where you're from,
is there a god?

302
00:17:55,159 --> 00:17:57,509
The same god, pedro.

303
00:17:58,127 --> 00:17:59,378
I wonder...

304
00:17:59,413 --> 00:18:00,629
what?

305
00:18:00,664 --> 00:18:02,765
If god were to come to earth,

306
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,518
would they find him so strange
that they would be afraid,

307
00:18:06,553 --> 00:18:08,387
and would they shoot him?

308
00:18:08,422 --> 00:18:11,390
Did not his son
come once, pedro?

309
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:13,776
And they nailed him to a cross.

310
00:18:14,276 --> 00:18:18,647
And then spent 2,000 years
learning to believe in him.

311
00:18:19,281 --> 00:18:21,784
All things take time, pedro.

312
00:18:21,819 --> 00:18:24,036
Soon,
pedro, soon

313
00:18:24,071 --> 00:18:27,790
your people
will no longer
be afraid of me.

314
00:18:27,825 --> 00:18:31,293
They will not be afraid,
and then...

315
00:18:31,328 --> 00:18:33,796
then i can show them the gift.

316
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:48,560
I am
sanchez, sir.

317
00:18:48,595 --> 00:18:50,429
I am the local
police officer.

318
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:51,680
And the fugitive?

319
00:18:51,715 --> 00:18:52,681
Inside there, sir.

320
00:18:52,716 --> 00:18:54,566
It was i, myself
who shot him

321
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:55,184
and brought
him down.

322
00:18:55,219 --> 00:18:57,686
The bartender tells me
that he lies in a bed

323
00:18:57,721 --> 00:18:58,937
too weak to move.

324
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:01,440
You are a brave man,
officer sanchez.

325
00:19:01,475 --> 00:19:03,075
But please explain to me

326
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:06,195
if he is only one man
and is too weak to move,

327
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,446
why do you need us?

328
00:19:07,481 --> 00:19:09,948
You, you do not
understand, sir.

329
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:12,701
This is not a man;
this is a creature.

330
00:19:12,736 --> 00:19:15,838
Who knows what
are his powers?

331
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,962
You- you are
the owner?

332
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:26,465
This is manolo, si.

333
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,967
The person you seek
is inside, captain.

334
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:30,853
I have held him here for you.

335
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,105
Oh, i am
in the presence

336
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,607
of such courage,
mr. Bartender.

337
00:19:35,642 --> 00:19:37,476
A village
of lions.

338
00:19:37,511 --> 00:19:39,361
Sergeant,
in here with me.

339
00:19:39,396 --> 00:19:41,230
The two of you,
wait outside.

340
00:19:41,265 --> 00:19:41,864
Excuse me, captain.

341
00:19:41,899 --> 00:19:44,366
The man is too
ill to be moved.

342
00:19:44,401 --> 00:19:45,617
Oh?
And you would be...?

343
00:19:45,652 --> 00:19:46,869
I am the doctor here.

344
00:19:46,904 --> 00:19:48,120
I have been treating the man.

345
00:19:48,155 --> 00:19:49,988
He was wounded,
captain,

346
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:51,874
after killing one
of our policeman.

347
00:19:51,909 --> 00:19:53,125
Why don't you
let captain

348
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,376
do his duty,
doctor?

349
00:19:54,411 --> 00:19:57,496
I will be very happy
to let the captain do his duty,

350
00:19:57,531 --> 00:19:59,998
but first, i must be
cognizant of my own.

351
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:02,501
The man is my patient;
he's been badly wounded.

352
00:20:02,536 --> 00:20:03,752
He can do no one any harm.

353
00:20:03,787 --> 00:20:05,637
Hmm.
Unfortunately, doctor

354
00:20:05,672 --> 00:20:08,140
my orders from
the state capital

355
00:20:08,175 --> 00:20:09,391
were to bring back
a killer,

356
00:20:09,426 --> 00:20:10,642
not a patient.

357
00:20:13,762 --> 00:20:15,397
Get out of
the way, pedro.

358
00:20:15,432 --> 00:20:17,900
They have come
for the monster.

359
00:20:17,935 --> 00:20:18,517
No! He
must live!

360
00:20:18,552 --> 00:20:21,019
The doctor
said he must
stay here.

361
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:22,905
Here he is, captain.

362
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,165
Have the men surround
the street immediately.

363
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,033
He cannot have gone
very far.

364
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:36,285
If there is ever a need here

365
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,787
for a town jailer,
mr. Bartender,

366
00:20:38,822 --> 00:20:41,924
i hope you do not see fit
to run for the office!

367
00:20:52,719 --> 00:20:55,804
Que dios nos proteja!

368
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:01,560
The soldiers
will protect us.

369
00:21:07,816 --> 00:21:09,701
There he is!

370
00:21:09,736 --> 00:21:10,953
Officer, i found him!
He's here!

371
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:16,959
You're under arrest, senor!

372
00:21:16,994 --> 00:21:18,210
You will come with us.

373
00:21:18,245 --> 00:21:19,461
The charge is murder.

374
00:21:19,496 --> 00:21:23,215
Death was an accident.

375
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:27,586
I come in peace.

376
00:21:27,621 --> 00:21:29,471
You will put up
your hands

377
00:21:29,506 --> 00:21:30,722
and walk toward me.

378
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:43,235
Mr. Williams! Mr. Williams!

379
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:45,487
Pedro, the gift.

380
00:21:45,522 --> 00:21:47,489
Show them
the gift.

381
00:21:47,524 --> 00:21:49,358
Give it to
the doctor.

382
00:21:49,393 --> 00:21:51,243
He will explain
it to them.

383
00:21:51,278 --> 00:21:52,861
Destroy it.

384
00:21:52,896 --> 00:21:54,496
Burn it! Burn it!

385
00:21:54,531 --> 00:21:55,747
It is the devil's work.

386
00:21:55,782 --> 00:21:56,999
Destroy it!

387
00:21:57,034 --> 00:21:58,250
It's the devil's work!

388
00:21:58,285 --> 00:22:00,752
Burn it! Burn it!

389
00:22:00,787 --> 00:22:03,121
Why did you do it?

390
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:05,007
Why?

391
00:22:05,042 --> 00:22:09,261
Que dios nos proteja!

392
00:22:09,296 --> 00:22:10,379
Calm yourself.

393
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:14,016
Pedro!

394
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:17,135
Look out for the boy!

395
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:19,021
Somebody stop him.

396
00:22:19,056 --> 00:22:19,888
He's attacking the boy.

397
00:22:19,923 --> 00:22:22,391
He's going after the boy!

398
00:22:22,426 --> 00:22:23,642
Somebody stop him!

399
00:22:23,677 --> 00:22:25,527
He's attacking the boy!

400
00:22:35,037 --> 00:22:37,539
All right,
that's the end of it.

401
00:22:37,574 --> 00:22:39,408
Everybody,
back to your homes.

402
00:22:39,443 --> 00:22:41,293
Clear the streets.

403
00:22:41,328 --> 00:22:43,795
Arrange for someone
to pick up the body.

404
00:22:52,054 --> 00:22:53,305
What was it, doctor?

405
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,173
Black magic?

406
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:57,059
Something from satan?

407
00:22:57,094 --> 00:22:58,927
Read it.

408
00:23:03,932 --> 00:23:06,435
"Greetings to the people
of earth.

409
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:09,571
"We come as friends,
and in peace.

410
00:23:12,074 --> 00:23:14,576
"We bring you this gift.

411
00:23:14,611 --> 00:23:18,947
"The following chemical
formula is a vaccine.

412
00:23:18,982 --> 00:23:22,084
It's a vaccine against
all forms of cancer."

413
00:23:25,203 --> 00:23:26,455
That's all there is.

414
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:27,706
The rest
has been burned.

415
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:34,596
So we have not
just killed a man.

416
00:23:34,631 --> 00:23:37,099
We have killed a dream.

417
00:23:41,505 --> 00:23:45,223
Oh, que noche,
que noche!

418
00:23:47,976 --> 00:23:49,861
Come, pedro.

419
00:23:49,896 --> 00:23:51,730
Come home with me, son.

420
00:23:55,484 --> 00:23:59,237
Madeiro, mexico- the present.

421
00:23:59,272 --> 00:24:00,489
The subject- fear.

422
00:24:00,524 --> 00:24:04,876
The cure- a little more faith.

423
00:24:05,494 --> 00:24:09,247
An rx off a shelf
in the twilight zone.

424
00:24:12,901 --> 00:24:16,588
Rod serling,
creator ofthe twilight zone,

425
00:24:16,623 --> 00:24:19,090
will tell you
about next week's story

426
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:20,342
after this message.

427
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,845
And now, mr. Serling.

428
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,730
Next week onthe twilight zone,
a return visit

429
00:24:25,765 --> 00:24:28,233
from an illustrious young actor,
cliff robertson.

430
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:30,735
He stars
in one of the strangest tales

431
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:31,987
we've yet to throw at you.

432
00:24:32,022 --> 00:24:35,106
It's called "the dummy,"
and it involves a ventriloquist

433
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:38,860
and a piece of painted wood-
a unique slab of carved pine

434
00:24:38,895 --> 00:24:40,745
who decides that lap sitting
is for the birds,

435
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:43,248
and who takes things
into his own wooden hands.

436
00:24:43,283 --> 00:24:43,865
Now, this one we recommend

437
00:24:44,499 --> 00:24:45,750
to the voice throwers
across the land.

438
00:24:45,785 --> 00:24:47,002
We hope we see you then.

439
00:24:49,504 --> 00:24:53,258
Chesterfield king extra length-
sure, and more,

440
00:24:53,293 --> 00:24:55,126
for only chesterfield king

441
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:58,880
gives you the wonderful taste
of 21 great tobaccos.

442
00:24:58,915 --> 00:25:00,765
Try a pack.

443
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:32,998
This is james arness.

444
00:25:33,033 --> 00:25:34,249
You know, it's only a short hop

445
00:25:34,284 --> 00:25:37,385
fromthe twilight zone
to dodge city ingunsmoke.

446
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:40,005
Saturday nights
over most of these stations.
