00:00:06,556 --> 00:00:09,693
You unlock this door
with the key of imagination.

2
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:12,195
Beyond it is another dimension-

3
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:13,446
a dimension of sound,

4
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:16,566
a dimension of sight,

5
00:00:16,601 --> 00:00:18,451
a dimension of mind.

6
00:00:18,486 --> 00:00:20,954
You're moving into a land
of both shadow and substance,

7
00:00:20,989 --> 00:00:22,822
of things and ideas.

8
00:00:22,857 --> 00:00:27,210
You've just crossed over
into the twilight zone.

9
00:02:17,687 --> 00:02:20,824
Hey! Anybody home?

10
00:02:23,326 --> 00:02:25,195
Hey!

11
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:17,130
Man, don't ever sneak
up on a man like that.

12
00:03:18,381 --> 00:03:19,632
I'll tell you
one thing, daddy.

13
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:20,884
You sure got
a swinging shop here.

14
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:22,752
You got everything
right here

15
00:03:22,787 --> 00:03:24,637
to cut a record
but jenny lind.

16
00:03:25,255 --> 00:03:27,140
I'm floyd burney.

17
00:03:27,175 --> 00:03:29,008
Floyd burney,
you know.

18
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:32,145
What have you got
for me?

19
00:03:33,396 --> 00:03:34,647
Come on, dad, come on.

20
00:03:34,682 --> 00:03:35,899
They told me
back at the highway

21
00:03:35,934 --> 00:03:38,401
you're the music man
for this piece of nowhere.

22
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:40,904
I know this is the place.
Let's get with it.

23
00:03:42,772 --> 00:03:44,657
Look, dad,
don't hold out on me.

24
00:03:44,692 --> 00:03:47,777
You got a good folk song,
i'll pay you top dollar,

25
00:03:47,812 --> 00:03:49,662
but it's got
to be authentic.

26
00:03:49,697 --> 00:03:52,165
I got enough jokers
back home writing phonies.

27
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,536
No. No song.

28
00:03:56,571 --> 00:03:57,170
No song...

29
00:03:57,787 --> 00:03:59,672
they got to you already.

30
00:03:59,707 --> 00:04:01,541
Who was it,
that harlan trio?

31
00:04:01,576 --> 00:04:03,426
No, the pole river
boys, right?

32
00:04:03,461 --> 00:04:05,295
Dad, i'm telling you,

33
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:06,546
they're going
to steal you blind.

34
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:09,048
Now, anything you got
is only p.d. -

35
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,934
you know,
public domain.

36
00:04:12,802 --> 00:04:14,053
What i'm trying
to tell you is, dad,

37
00:04:14,088 --> 00:04:15,939
you ain't got
no rights, catch?

38
00:04:15,974 --> 00:04:19,058
Now, me,
that's different, dad.

39
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:25,315
See, me... i pay cash
on the line.

40
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,200
Now.

41
00:04:27,235 --> 00:04:29,068
No.

42
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:31,571
Nobody comes here.

43
00:04:31,606 --> 00:04:34,073
I ain't got nothing
they would want.

44
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:35,959
Tell you what.

45
00:04:35,994 --> 00:04:39,712
Suppose...
just suppose now

46
00:04:39,747 --> 00:04:43,466
i was to buy one
of your, uh...

47
00:04:43,501 --> 00:04:45,335
one of your little
treasures here.

48
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:46,586
No.

49
00:04:46,621 --> 00:04:47,837
Yeah, sure,
and then we,

50
00:04:47,872 --> 00:04:51,591
you know, we talk
a little bit,

51
00:04:51,626 --> 00:04:54,727
get to know one another,
and first thing you know,

52
00:04:55,345 --> 00:04:57,230
you loosen up,
right, dad?

53
00:05:10,994 --> 00:05:12,862
Oh, yeah.

54
00:05:12,897 --> 00:05:16,616
Yeah, this must be the place.

55
00:05:16,651 --> 00:05:17,867
What did you hear?

56
00:05:17,902 --> 00:05:20,370
Mm-hmm. Same thing
as you did, dad.

57
00:05:20,405 --> 00:05:22,872
All right, now,
how much, how much?

58
00:05:22,907 --> 00:05:24,757
Come on, you're
missing the beat.

59
00:05:24,792 --> 00:05:26,009
Now, how much?

60
00:05:27,912 --> 00:05:29,128
All right,
whatever it is,

61
00:05:29,163 --> 00:05:31,014
take it
out of there, huh?

62
00:06:15,558 --> 00:06:18,678
Mr. Floyd burney,
a gentleman songster

63
00:06:18,713 --> 00:06:19,929
in search of song,

64
00:06:19,964 --> 00:06:22,432
is about to answer
the age-old question

65
00:06:22,467 --> 00:06:26,069
of whether a man can be
in two places at the same time.

66
00:06:26,104 --> 00:06:29,188
As far as his folk song
is concerned,

67
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:30,440
we can assure mr. Burney

68
00:06:30,475 --> 00:06:32,325
he'll find everything
he's looking for,

69
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,827
although the lyrics may not be
all to his liking,

70
00:06:34,862 --> 00:06:36,696
but that's sometimes the case

71
00:06:36,731 --> 00:06:41,084
when the words and music are
recorded in the twilight zone.

72
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:02,141
What's your name, honey?

73
00:09:02,176 --> 00:09:03,759
Mary...

74
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:05,011
mary rachel.

75
00:09:05,046 --> 00:09:06,762
Oh, yeah.

76
00:09:06,797 --> 00:09:09,899
That's a lovely name.

77
00:09:09,934 --> 00:09:13,653
Lovely name, lovely song.

78
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,521
How's it go again?

79
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:18,024
That song is secret.

80
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:19,909
It belongs to somebody.

81
00:09:19,944 --> 00:09:23,029
It can't belong to anybody.

82
00:09:23,064 --> 00:09:26,165
Nobody can buy it.
It's public domain.

83
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,416
Who got to you?

84
00:09:27,451 --> 00:09:29,919
They made me promise
not to sing it anymore.

85
00:09:29,954 --> 00:09:33,673
Oh, they did, huh?

86
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:37,426
Uh, who was that made you
promise not to sing it again?

87
00:09:37,461 --> 00:09:38,928
The rayford brothers.

88
00:09:38,963 --> 00:09:41,297
Rayfords.

89
00:09:41,931 --> 00:09:43,799
Rayford...

90
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:46,302
yeah, yeah, i know them.

91
00:09:46,337 --> 00:09:48,187
Sure, they work
out of chattanooga.

92
00:09:48,222 --> 00:09:51,307
The older guy's the short one,
plays vibes...

93
00:09:51,342 --> 00:09:53,192
no, no... no, no.

94
00:09:53,227 --> 00:09:55,061
That was the raytones.

95
00:09:55,096 --> 00:09:57,196
Rayford...
the rayfords?

96
00:09:57,231 --> 00:09:59,065
I must go.
Wait a minute.

97
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,567
Come right
over there.

98
00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:02,818
That's good.

99
00:10:02,853 --> 00:10:04,070
Listen, can you let
me hear a little bit

100
00:10:04,105 --> 00:10:05,204
of it, maybe
just one chorus?

101
00:10:05,821 --> 00:10:06,572
Just sit down here.

102
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:07,823
That's good.

103
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:09,709
Know how to play
one of these?

104
00:10:09,744 --> 00:10:11,577
Well, let's
just try, huh?

105
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:14,080
Let me get that
out of your way.

106
00:10:15,331 --> 00:10:17,216
That's good,
fingers, good.

107
00:10:17,251 --> 00:10:17,833
Now, mary rachel,

108
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:19,719
i want you to
play this to me

109
00:10:19,754 --> 00:10:20,970
and sing it for me

110
00:10:21,005 --> 00:10:22,221
just as if you
and i were

111
00:10:22,256 --> 00:10:24,724
the only two people
in the world, okay?

112
00:10:30,846 --> 00:10:39,605
? he said, "come wander
with me, love?

113
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:45,861
? "come wander with me?

114
00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:53,753
? "away from this sad world?

115
00:10:53,788 --> 00:11:01,260
? come wander with me."?

116
00:11:01,295 --> 00:11:08,134
? he came
from the sunset?

117
00:11:08,169 --> 00:11:14,390
? he came from the sea?

118
00:11:14,425 --> 00:11:21,280
? he came
from my sorrow?

119
00:11:21,315 --> 00:11:31,290
? and can love only me.?

120
00:11:31,907 --> 00:11:33,909
I've got to go now.

121
00:11:33,944 --> 00:11:35,161
They'll be looking
for me.
Wait a minute.

122
00:11:35,196 --> 00:11:36,412
Please, i must go.

123
00:11:36,447 --> 00:11:38,414
When will i see you again?

124
00:11:38,449 --> 00:11:39,048
I mean, tonight?

125
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:41,550
You can't ever see me again.

126
00:11:41,585 --> 00:11:43,419
I'm bespoke.

127
00:11:43,454 --> 00:11:44,420
Bespoke?

128
00:11:44,455 --> 00:11:46,922
What is that supposed
to mean, bespoke?

129
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:49,425
You're bespoke,
i'm floyd burney- so what?

130
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:54,180
Let me make it plain
to you, honey,

131
00:11:54,215 --> 00:11:56,682
so you'll understand.

132
00:11:56,717 --> 00:11:58,567
Now, i need that song.

133
00:11:58,602 --> 00:12:00,436
I don't know what act
those rayford brothers got,

134
00:12:00,471 --> 00:12:02,938
but that song was meant for me,
and i need it.

135
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:04,190
Do you understand?

136
00:12:04,225 --> 00:12:05,825
What do you
want for it?

137
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,693
It belongs to somebody else.

138
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:09,195
Then i'll buy it.

139
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:12,331
What do you want... 50 bucks?

140
00:12:12,366 --> 00:12:13,949
A hundred?

141
00:12:13,984 --> 00:12:16,585
Well, what do you want,
a percentage?

142
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,455
It can't be bought,
not that way.

143
00:12:21,957 --> 00:12:23,843
Honey, anything can be bought.

144
00:12:23,878 --> 00:12:28,214
It's a buyer's market
with a price tag on everything.

145
00:12:28,249 --> 00:12:31,967
All you got to know
is just how to find the tag.

146
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:34,103
Mary rachel,

147
00:12:34,138 --> 00:12:35,855
i won't hurt your song.

148
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:37,723
All i'll do is
transpose it.

149
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:38,974
Here, sit
down, listen.

150
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:42,111
I'll just change
the key a little,
that's all.

151
00:12:47,116 --> 00:12:52,738
? come wander
with me, love?

152
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:57,743
? come wander with me?

153
00:12:57,778 --> 00:13:03,883
? away from this sad world?

154
00:13:03,918 --> 00:13:10,639
? come wander
with me.?

155
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,656
Would you really take me away?

156
00:13:27,691 --> 00:13:32,278
Oh... far from this sad world,
mary rachel.

157
00:13:32,313 --> 00:13:35,164
And you'd love only me?

158
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:39,785
Only you, mary
rachel, only you.

159
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:56,685
? oh, where is the wanderer?

160
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:02,942
? who wandered this way?

161
00:14:02,977 --> 00:14:09,198
? he's past all his wandering?

162
00:14:09,233 --> 00:14:17,323
? and will never go away.?

163
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:32,171
? come wander with me, love?

164
00:14:32,206 --> 00:14:37,810
? come wander with me?

165
00:14:38,427 --> 00:14:44,683
? away from this sad world?

166
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:52,825
? come wander with me?

167
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:59,698
? he sang of a sweet love?

168
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:05,955
? of dreams that would be?

169
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:12,211
? but i was sworn to another?

170
00:15:12,246 --> 00:15:20,352
? and could never be free.?

171
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:25,357
Yeah. Yeah, i'm
going to really run

172
00:15:25,392 --> 00:15:26,609
with this one.

173
00:15:28,477 --> 00:15:30,362
Do you still love me?

174
00:15:30,397 --> 00:15:32,865
Sure, sure
i do, honey,

175
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,367
but, uh, we're
wasting time.

176
00:15:35,402 --> 00:15:37,870
When will
you take me away?

177
00:15:37,905 --> 00:15:39,121
Just as soon
as we finish

178
00:15:39,156 --> 00:15:40,990
listening to
the playback.

179
00:15:41,025 --> 00:15:42,241
Now, you tell
me the story

180
00:15:42,276 --> 00:15:43,492
any way you want.

181
00:15:44,743 --> 00:15:47,880
It's the story
of my love.

182
00:15:48,497 --> 00:15:51,000
I love you.
I've always loved you.

183
00:15:51,035 --> 00:15:52,885
Yeah, well, i tell
you what, honey.

184
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,753
Don't worry about it.
I'll think of something.

185
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:56,005
I bet i could
run this thing

186
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:59,141
right to the top
as a straight vocal.

187
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:05,397
? the rayfords were brothers?

188
00:16:05,432 --> 00:16:10,402
? four men tall and bold?

189
00:16:10,437 --> 00:16:14,773
? and for one i was chosen?

190
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:19,778
? with my love still untold?

191
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:23,532
? they heard of the wanderer?

192
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:27,920
? they heard he loved me?

193
00:16:27,955 --> 00:16:29,171
? they heard...?

194
00:16:31,075 --> 00:16:32,291
You know, that's
a great bit.

195
00:16:32,326 --> 00:16:32,925
That really is.

196
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,793
The thing the rayfords
got going for them there.

197
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:36,679
Sure, put your own
name in a song.

198
00:16:36,714 --> 00:16:38,547
Every play, you
get a free plug.

199
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:46,805
Uh, who's that?

200
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,691
Billy rayford.

201
00:16:48,726 --> 00:16:51,193
Yeah? How's he
know to come here?

202
00:16:51,228 --> 00:16:53,062
He always comes here.

203
00:16:53,097 --> 00:16:56,198
Honey, don't you
have to go home

204
00:16:56,233 --> 00:16:58,067
and pick up
a few things?

205
00:16:58,102 --> 00:16:58,951
We got a long
way to go.

206
00:16:58,986 --> 00:17:00,202
But you said
you'd buy me things-

207
00:17:00,237 --> 00:17:02,071
bells and bonnets
and bright beads.

208
00:17:02,106 --> 00:17:04,573
Yeah, sure, honey.
I tell you what.

209
00:17:04,608 --> 00:17:07,076
You wait here,
and i'll go talk
to this cat.

210
00:17:07,111 --> 00:17:08,327
No, not this time.

211
00:17:08,362 --> 00:17:10,079
What do you mean,
not this time?

212
00:17:10,114 --> 00:17:10,713
Honey, relax.

213
00:17:10,748 --> 00:17:14,466
You're with me,
floyd burney.

214
00:17:24,226 --> 00:17:27,346
So, you're one
of the rayford brothers, huh?

215
00:17:27,381 --> 00:17:28,597
I know you.

216
00:17:28,632 --> 00:17:31,100
You're the singing man,
ain't you?

217
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:33,602
Yeah! Yeah, that's me,
floyd burney.

218
00:17:33,637 --> 00:17:35,487
Yeah, i sing a little.

219
00:17:37,606 --> 00:17:40,359
Hear you're the one
who's after mary rachel.

220
00:17:40,394 --> 00:17:41,860
Mary rachel?

221
00:17:43,112 --> 00:17:44,363
Don't lie.

222
00:17:44,398 --> 00:17:47,116
I seen you,
and folks heard

223
00:17:47,151 --> 00:17:49,001
your sugar talking
about taking her to norfolk.

224
00:17:49,036 --> 00:17:50,119
Norfolk?

225
00:17:50,154 --> 00:17:53,255
What do i want to take anybody
to norfolk for?

226
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:54,757
I'm taking you to my brothers.

227
00:17:54,792 --> 00:17:57,259
They know how to deal
with your kind.

228
00:17:57,294 --> 00:18:00,129
Now, listen, dad,
i want to tell you something.

229
00:18:00,164 --> 00:18:03,265
Now, i got agents,
and i got business managers,

230
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,134
and i got publicity people,

231
00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:07,636
and they know where i am
every minute.

232
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:08,637
Billy?

233
00:18:16,779 --> 00:18:20,532
? you killed billy rayford?

234
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:24,536
? bespoke unto me?

235
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:28,540
? struck him down in his anger?

236
00:18:28,575 --> 00:18:32,911
? 'neath an old willow tree?

237
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:37,666
? by the lake
where our love dwelled?

238
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:41,420
? 'neath an old willow tree?

239
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:45,424
? you killed billy rayford?

240
00:18:45,459 --> 00:18:49,928
? 'neath an old willow tree.?

241
00:18:53,682 --> 00:18:54,933
All right, how
did you know,

242
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:57,436
and how did that verse
get on the tape?

243
00:18:57,471 --> 00:18:59,321
It's always happened
that way.

244
00:18:59,356 --> 00:19:02,441
"Always"? What is
this, some con game?

245
00:19:02,476 --> 00:19:03,692
What are you
talking about?

246
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:04,943
How many other guys
you hook into this?

247
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:07,579
No one else. Only you.

248
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,202
It's always been you.

249
00:19:13,237 --> 00:19:15,454
Man, we got to split!

250
00:19:15,489 --> 00:19:18,457
If you run, they'll catch you.
You know that.

251
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:21,593
What doyouwant me to do,
lay down and play dead?

252
00:19:21,628 --> 00:19:24,096
Maybe if you didn't run
this time...

253
00:19:24,131 --> 00:19:27,216
if i hid you,
maybe it could be different.

254
00:19:27,251 --> 00:19:29,218
Hide me? Where?

255
00:19:29,253 --> 00:19:31,103
I'd find someplace.

256
00:19:31,138 --> 00:19:32,971
We could always be together.

257
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:34,857
Yeah, stay out here, huh?

258
00:19:34,892 --> 00:19:37,976
Uh-uh, ain't no way,
baby, forget it.

259
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:39,228
Not for old floyd burney.

260
00:19:39,263 --> 00:19:40,479
I come too far too fast

261
00:19:40,514 --> 00:19:42,364
to get buried out here
in sticksville.

262
00:19:42,399 --> 00:19:44,116
We're gonna
split- come on.

263
00:19:59,748 --> 00:20:00,999
Come on, which way?

264
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:02,885
If you run,
they'll catch you.

265
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,136
Don't you understand?

266
00:20:04,171 --> 00:20:06,638
We got to get out of
here before that kid's
brothers find him.

267
00:20:07,256 --> 00:20:10,392
It's too late.
They've already found him.

268
00:20:11,393 --> 00:20:15,764
? they sought out
their brother?

269
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:19,902
? and found him alone?

270
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:25,524
? they wept by the lakeside?

271
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:31,914
? for a boy
hardly grown.?

272
00:20:31,949 --> 00:20:33,165
No... no!

273
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:38,170
? they wept by the lakeside?

274
00:20:38,205 --> 00:20:42,541
? and vowed he must die?

275
00:20:42,576 --> 00:20:47,296
? the wandering
stranger...?

276
00:20:47,331 --> 00:20:49,181
Stop it! Stop it!

277
00:20:49,216 --> 00:20:50,432
You hear me?!
I don't want to hear any more!

278
00:20:50,467 --> 00:20:51,550
But it's our song.

279
00:20:51,585 --> 00:20:54,686
It belongs to us,
and we belong to it.

280
00:20:54,721 --> 00:20:55,437
Then take it back.

281
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:57,940
I don't want it.
Take it back!

282
00:20:57,975 --> 00:21:00,809
I can't. It's been used.

283
00:21:02,729 --> 00:21:03,946
They're coming.

284
00:21:06,815 --> 00:21:08,200
Come on.

285
00:21:08,235 --> 00:21:09,451
Come on, get up.

286
00:21:09,486 --> 00:21:10,702
Don't run.

287
00:21:10,737 --> 00:21:11,954
Stay with me
this time.

288
00:21:11,989 --> 00:21:15,073
This time, stay with me.

289
00:21:16,325 --> 00:21:19,461
Don't run, don't run.

290
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:23,832
I'll always love you.

291
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:29,838
Don't run, don't run.

292
00:22:07,509 --> 00:22:09,378
Help me.

293
00:22:09,413 --> 00:22:10,629
You got to help
me, old man.

294
00:22:10,664 --> 00:22:13,131
You got to hide me!

295
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:13,765
I'll pay you.

296
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,634
I'll pay you
anything.

297
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:17,519
It's too late.

298
00:22:18,136 --> 00:22:21,890
I'm floyd burney,
the rock-a-billy boy!

299
00:22:21,925 --> 00:22:23,141
Don't you understand?

300
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:24,393
They don't want me.

301
00:22:24,428 --> 00:22:25,027
They want
somebody else.

302
00:22:25,062 --> 00:22:26,895
I don't even sing
that kind of song.

303
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:27,529
I'm with the big beat.

304
00:22:27,564 --> 00:22:29,398
Wait, listen,
i'll show you.

305
00:22:29,433 --> 00:22:30,649
This is my stuff-
here, listen.

306
00:22:30,684 --> 00:22:31,900
? my baby's like
a honey tree?

307
00:22:31,935 --> 00:22:33,151
? sweet as can be?

308
00:22:33,186 --> 00:22:34,403
? now, she don't
go with other cats?

309
00:22:34,438 --> 00:22:36,905
? she only digs me.?

310
00:22:37,539 --> 00:22:39,408
Where you going?

311
00:22:39,443 --> 00:22:41,293
Where you going, old man?

312
00:22:41,328 --> 00:22:43,795
Where are you going,
old man?

313
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:14,386
In retrospect, it may be said
of mr. Floyd burney

314
00:24:14,421 --> 00:24:16,254
that he achieved
that final dream

315
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:19,391
eternal top-name billing-

316
00:24:20,008 --> 00:24:22,511
not on the fleeting billboards
of the entertainment world,

317
00:24:23,145 --> 00:24:24,396
but forever recorded

318
00:24:24,431 --> 00:24:27,516
among the folk songs
of the twilight zone.

319
00:24:30,986 --> 00:24:32,103
And now, mr. Serling.

320
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:33,989
We go wild next time

321
00:24:34,024 --> 00:24:35,240
with some science fiction
ingredients

322
00:24:35,275 --> 00:24:38,360
that should do a sizable job
of shocking.

323
00:24:38,395 --> 00:24:40,245
Ms. Hazel court
and mr. Mark richman

324
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:43,365
lend their talents
to a piece called "the fear."

325
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,867
If you've ever wondered
what nature of beast

326
00:24:45,902 --> 00:24:49,004
might come out of the sky
in an interplanetary invasion,

327
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:50,872
watchthe twilight zone
next time.

328
00:24:50,907 --> 00:24:54,626
You'll get your answer
in most visual terms.
