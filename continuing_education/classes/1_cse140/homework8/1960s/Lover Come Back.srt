1
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,639
This is Madison Avenue,
center of the advertising world.

2
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,389
In these steel and concrete
beehives are born the ideas

3
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,270
that decide what we will
eat, drink, drive and smoke,

4
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,672
and how we will dress, sleep,
shave and smell.

5
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,310
In all beehives,
there are workers and drones.

6
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,679
This is a worker.

7
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,752
Thank you.

8
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,157
And this is a drone.

9
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,993
Jerry, Honey...

10
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,708
You're at work.

11
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,114
Good night, darling.
- Good night.

12
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,229
Wait!

13
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:19,679
What kind of good-night kiss is that?
We're not married.

14
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,673
My,
what a way to go to work!

15
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,275
That's a woman!

16
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,557
Make you homesick, Fred?

17
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,919
Yeah. Makes me sick
we're going home next week.

18
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,591
Bracket,
McGalpin & Gaines, advertising.

19
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,158
I'll give him the message.

20
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,676
Dorothy, Mr. Bracket in yet?
- No.

21
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,073
Tell merchandising, copy and art
there's a meeting. Right away!

22
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,592
Miss Templeton wants merchandising,
copy and art in her office.

23
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,878
On the double!
Looks like a rough day.

24
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,918
Good morning, Mr. Webster.

25
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,994
Good morning.

26
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,793
Would you send a tomato juice,
black coffee and a masseur?

27
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,189
Yes, sir.

28
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,552
Mr. Webster wants tomato juice,
black coffee and a masseur.

29
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,269
Looks like a rough night.

30
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,673
Miller's Wax is changing agencies.
We can get the account.

31
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,436
Miller's coming tonight.
Find out where he's staying.

32
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,435
I want an appointment in the morning.
- You can't work out a plan by then.

33
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,115
We can and we will.

34
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,080
Here's some thoughts I had.
Tighten them up.

35
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,631
Tell research I want a complete
rundown on J. Paxton Miller.

36
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:54,397
His packaging, distribution, sales,
and strong and weak market areas.

37
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,315
Kelly, what's new
in our gray flannel jungle?

38
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,633
The natives are restless.
Miller is to pick up a new agency.

39
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,600
The account's up for grabs.

40
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,116
Let's grab. Where's he from?

41
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,556
Richmond, Virginia.

42
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,034
Get me a book on the civil war
and a complete rundown on Miller.

43
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,915
Family? Will his wife be with him?

44
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,471
What liquor does he drink?
What kind of girls does he like?

45
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,509
That's a very good idea.
- Thank you.

46
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,753
Develop it further, Leonard.
- And here...

47
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,228
This isn't bad either.
But what color's that floor?

48
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,629
Lilac.

49
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,755
Lilac? Who has
a lilac floor in their kitchen?

50
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,749
I have.

51
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,275
Well, everyone
isn't as artistic as you are.

52
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,229
We have to sell this wax
to average, ordinary people.

53
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,312
Them!

54
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,951
Carol, I've photographed
this can of wax from every angle.

55
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,352
With every kind of lighting.
I just can't make it look good.

56
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,879
You may have hit
on the key to the whole thing.

57
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,352
This can - it's unattractive.
- So?

58
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,398
So, Leonard designs a new one.

59
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,518
When? It's ten thirty!

60
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,275
We'll be here half the night!

61
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,116
Believe me,
the agency that lands this account

62
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,876
is the one
that shows the most attractive can.

63
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,439
Most attractive!

64
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,149
More bourbon, Mr. Miller?
- Just a touch.

65
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,400
Yes, sir. She's most attractive.

66
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,314
You know, I'd like to meet her.
- You're going to.

67
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:59,111
We're having a party
with those rabbits, I mean, girls.

68
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,511
I'll drink to that!

69
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,590
More bourbon?
- Just a touch.

70
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,994
Rebel Davis...

71
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:13,677
She's distantly related to Jefferson
Davis, our great leader.

72
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,513
Did you say "our" leader?

73
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,875
I was raised here in the North,

74
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,272
but my heart remains
loyal to my birthplace, Virginia.

75
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,228
You're a Virginia boy?
- Richmond!

76
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,073
That's where I'm from!

77
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,313
You are kidding.
- Born and raised.

78
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,393
Well! To Richmond!
- Of course!

79
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,629
So you one
of them Virginia Websters!

80
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,713
My great-grandfather
fought with the Virginia volunteers.

81
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,753
So did my granddaddy.

82
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,277
He fell during Picket's Charge.
- Mine too!

83
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,956
He was following that great
Captain Elijah E. Miller.

84
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,075
That was my granddaddy!

85
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,312
Mr. Miller,
this is a hallowed moment.

86
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,470
More bourbon?
- Just a touch.

87
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,390
Son, you hear that?
They're playin' our song!

88
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,391
On your feet, Yankees!

89
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,916
That's what I call a party!

90
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,788
Gee, I'm sorry I missed it.

91
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,476
What happened to the house detective?

92
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,873
I don't know if he jumped,
or somebody pushed him.

93
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,074
Penthouse, please.

94
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,755
You're a little late for the party.

95
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:06,596
Was the party at Mr. Miller's?
- Not a party...

96
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,479
The party!

97
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,350
How about stopping off at my pad?

98
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,354
What for?
- Look what I'm takin' home.

99
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,990
You think that's somethin'?

100
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,229
Hi!

101
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,999
Excuse me.

102
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,588
I'm looking for Mr. Miller.

103
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,232
You'll never find me.

104
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,559
Mr. Miller?

105
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,349
Sir, I'm Carol Templeton,
with Bracket, McGalpin & Gaines.

106
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,871
Have a sit down.

107
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,511
I have an appointment
to talk about handling your account.

108
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,229
I've signed
with Jerry Webster.

109
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,989
Jerry...

110
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:49,236
Of Ramsey & Son?
- Of the 19th Virginia Volunteers.

111
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,912
But I worked up
a complete presentation,

112
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,038
a whole campaign.

113
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,759
Even a new container.
Here, let me show you.

114
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:03,233
I can't. I'm flying back to Richmond.
- When?

115
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,756
Now, honey. Now.

116
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,874
We just passing over Pittsburgh.

117
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,957
Mr. Miller,
please open your eyes.

118
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,637
Why? I've seen everything.

119
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,392
Just a touch.

120
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:46,198
Mr. Bracket, this man Webster
is a disgrace to the business.

121
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,511
He should be barred.

122
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,670
I'd like nothing better.
It's not the first one he's taken.

123
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,231
Then go to the advertising council.

124
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,596
Charge him with unethical conduct!

125
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,709
Who do you think will testify?
Miller? The girls?

126
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,475
There's no law against entertaining.

127
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,917
There must be a law against
that kind of entertaining.

128
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,436
It was a Roman orgy!

129
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,070
I saw this girl carried out

130
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,473
in a bass fiddle case. You can
imagine what else went on.

131
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,589
Yes!

132
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,039
Mr. Bracket! Surely you don't
condone Webster's methods!

133
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,352
Course not.
No ethical agency does.

134
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:34,833
Then how does he get away with it?
Ramsey & Son has a fine reputation.

135
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,912
The old man ruled with an iron hand.
His son doesn't know what's going on.

136
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,629
Then it's time
somebody told him!

137
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,197
Miss Templeton,
you've only been with us a while.

138
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,752
We've learned to live with Webster.
He's like the common cold:

139
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,720
You know you'll
get it once or twice a year.

140
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,478
There are two ways
to handle a cold:

141
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,474
You can fight it,
or give in and go to bed with it.

142
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,795
I intend to fight it!

143
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,798
Wait here.

144
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,592
That's a cab zone, buddy.

145
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,071
I am not your buddy.

146
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,038
I happen to be Peter Ramsey.

147
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,829
I don't care if you're Peter Rabbit.
Beat it!

148
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,276
How would you like a fat lip?

149
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,715
Fine, fine.

150
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,032
Harrison...
Give him a fat lip.

151
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,958
Okay, so park there.

152
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,351
Hope Mr. Webster
won't get angry.

153
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:50,753
I assume full responsibility.
I am his employer.

154
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,152
All right, Mr. Webster. Hear this!

155
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:21,789
It's been brought to my attention that
you're guilty of unbecoming conduct.

156
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:26,591
You have embarked on this course
without my knowledge or consent.

157
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,436
My father, the commodore,
would not brook insubordination.

158
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:34,071
By thunder,
neither will I!

159
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,917
I demand a full and complete
explanation, or heads will roll!

160
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,795
Speak up man, I'm waiting.

161
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,591
Do you realize what you broke?
That was to build my confidence.

162
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,915
I ought to break your neck,
barging in on me. - Take it easy!

163
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:04,510
I've had a rough morning. Took a
tongue-lashing from Carol Templeton.

164
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,875
Who's that?

165
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,874
New executive
at Bracket, McGalpin and Gaines.

166
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,836
She accused you
of pirating the Miller Wax account

167
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,595
by getting him tipsy and a girl.

168
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,117
That's not true. I got him loaded,
and there were seven girls.

169
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,555
Just a moment...

170
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,911
I'm head of the company!

171
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,399
You're accountable to me.

172
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,197
I leave the bridge,
and you steer the ship on the rocks.

173
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,990
I demand to know if your
conduct was in the firm's interest.

174
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,429
That's sadistic.

175
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:52,994
You listen to me. I was up all night
in the interest of Ramsey and Son.

176
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:57,029
I landed a $5 million account
in the interest of Ramsey and Son.

177
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,830
You haven't been
in the office for two months.

178
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:04,391
And that's in the interest
of Ramsey and Son.

179
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,153
I have very good reason for that.

180
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,628
It depresses the employees.

181
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:15,350
I discussed it with my analyst,
Dr. Melnick. He understands.

182
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,115
He says I depressed him too.

183
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,797
He's only human. - You don't know
what a handicap it is to be born rich.

184
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,829
Some handicap. - Don't sneer.
Wealthy people are hated.

185
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,073
What's written on the Statue of
Liberty? "Send me your rich"?

186
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,597
No, "Send me your poor."
We're not welcome in our own country.

187
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,230
You're one of the lucky ones.

188
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,074
You were born in the slums.
- That's lucky?

189
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,553
You had everything going for
you: Poverty, squalor...

190
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:49,158
There was only one way to go:
Up. But I did it the hard way.

191
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,834
Done what?

192
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,357
Taken over Ramsey and Son.

193
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:58,514
As president, I've a right to know
what's been going on.

194
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:02,117
Well, I'll tell you.
I've landed 10 new accounts.

195
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:05,034
There's a lot more to advertising.

196
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:08,000
The big job
is selling the product.

197
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,949
Gimme a well-stacked dame
in a bathing suit, I'll sell anything.

198
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,830
Girls again!
What's the obsession with girls?

199
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,471
I was a poor kid, remember?
I didn't have toys to play with.

200
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,113
See. Told you
it's a handicap to be rich.

201
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,392
Get me that green tie.
- Right.

202
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,917
What about Miss Templeton?
What am I gonna say?

203
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,309
Nothing.

204
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,990
I'll say it for you.
- Oh good.

205
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,198
Tell her...

206
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,316
'
we re very sorry.

207
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,359
And that if she's willing to forgive,

208
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,513
that henceforth we'll
conduct ourselves beyond reproach.

209
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,798
Carol Templeton, please.
Jerry Webster calling.

210
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,671
Ramsey and Son. - Assure her
of our high moral character.

211
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,233
Yes, Mr. Webster. - Mr. Ramsey tells
me you spoke to him.

212
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,111
I'd like to ask you a favor. Kindly
keep your nose out of my business.

213
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,513
If the competition's too tough,
get out of the profession.

214
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,388
You aren't even in
the advertising profession.

215
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:18,270
I ought to tell you your profession.
- Tell me anyway.

216
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:22,878
Let me put it this way,
I don't use sex to land an account.

217
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,271
When do you use it?
- I don't!

218
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,194
My condolences to your husband.

219
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,229
I'm not married.
- That figures.

220
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,676
What do you mean, that figures?

221
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,150
A husband would be competition.

222
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:40,199
There's only room for one man
in a family.

223
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,559
Let me tell you something:
I wish I were a man right now...

224
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,076
Keep trying. You'll make it.

225
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:02,232
Milly, get me the number
of a Miss Rebel Davis.

226
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,676
She works at the Bunny Club.

227
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,953
Your trouble is you're
living in your father's shadow.

228
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:16,514
You're even afraid to get rid of
his car. - He dominated me.

229
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,154
Just once,
I spoke back to him.

230
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,589
He cut a switch from a tree
and gave me a whipping.

231
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,070
In front of this girl.

232
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,994
It was a shattering experience.

233
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,356
Pete, all kids get whippings.

234
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:36,594
But I was 25.
The girl was my fiancee.

235
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,512
Hello?
- You no-good, lowdown liar.

236
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,798
Rebel, honey, what's the trouble?
- There's trouble?

237
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,634
You promised
I was gonna be the Miller Wax girl

238
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:52,113
and now Mr. Miller says
there ain't even gonna be one!

239
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,795
Carol Templeton surely was right.

240
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,952
Carol Templeton?

241
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,476
Are we in trouble?
- When did you talk to her?

242
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:04,670
She wants me to go to the ad council
and tell them about those parties.

243
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,513
I'm gonna do it!

244
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,718
Don't you go near the ad council!
I'll be over.

245
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,838
We're in trouble?
- I can handle it.

246
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,674
As head, I've a right to know.

247
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,629
Yes, we're in trouble.
- You shouldn't have told me.

248
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,872
You get outta here!

249
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,399
Now, honey,
let's talk this over.

250
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,950
I'll do my talking to the ad council.

251
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:35,036
Sugar Lump!
- I am not your sugar lump!

252
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,476
So stop nibbling on me.

253
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,678
You've been promising
to put me on TV for two years.

254
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,071
Baby! Baby!

255
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:49,711
You are not gonna nibble
your way out of this one!

256
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:53,112
I'm gonna tell that
advertising council plenty!

257
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,193
Okay.

258
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:04,192
Tell 'em there isn't any Miller Wax
girl, but also tell 'em why.

259
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:09,879
Tell 'em I cancelled when they were
gonna hide that glorious figure.

260
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:13,556
That's like hiding a Rembrandt
under a dishtowel.

261
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,875
Tell 'em everything. Tell 'em...

262
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:22,273
how I turned down, for two years,
sponsor after sponsor,

263
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,833
looking for
the right product,

264
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,232
the perfect product
for you to represent.

265
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,517
Tell 'em
I finally found one.

266
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,113
What is it?

267
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,474
Something...

268
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,678
woulda made you more famous
than Miss Rheingold.

269
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,832
Well, what is it?

270
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,991
A brand new product.

271
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,433
It's, uh, different. It's...

272
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,593
exciting...

273
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,831
Well, what is it?

274
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,719
Well, it's, uh...

275
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,155
VIPS ARRIVE FOR CONGRESS

276
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,913
Vip.

277
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,835
Vip?

278
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,709
I was gonna make you the Vip Girl.

279
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,475
What's Vip?
- Vip?

280
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:23,678
It's the product that
woulda brought you fame and fortune.

281
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,595
The key that
woulda opened the key to Hollywood.

282
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,956
And you turned it down.

283
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,555
No, I didn't!

284
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,394
Jerry! Jerry, wait, honey!

285
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:39,395
I didn't turn it down.
- Same thing.

286
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,439
We're filming the Vip commericials
at one o'clock.

287
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,400
I've got to pick out another girl.
- Oh no you don't.

288
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,917
I wanna be the Vip Girl.
- You had your chance.

289
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,594
Please, don't go.

290
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,475
Come back. Give me another chance.

291
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,030
I'll do anything you say.

292
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:59,432
Please!
- Well, I...

293
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,191
Well, all right...

294
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,159
It's him!

295
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:13,075
Let's face it, Charlie.
Either you've got or you haven't.

296
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,993
He's got it.

297
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,190
Vip commercial, number 3.

298
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,391
Okay, Rebel, action.

299
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,279
Hi there, I'm the Vip Girl.

300
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,315
Everything I've got,

301
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,438
I owe to Vip.

302
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:41,195
I'm just a slave to any man
who uses Vip.

303
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,358
Good things have been happening
since I discovered Vip.

304
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,199
I got my man
when I got Vip.

305
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:01,394
Oh yes, folks,
everything I got...

306
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,035
I owe to Vip.

307
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,912
Cut.
- That's it.

308
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,873
Wrap it up.
- Thanks.

309
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:15,716
What do you want done with the ads?
- Put them on the shelf.

310
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,792
On the shelf?

311
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,954
Call me about it later.
Rebel, you were fabulous.

312
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,955
Do you think they'll like me?
- Honey, single-handed...

313
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:29,397
you may bring in the
forty-inch screen.

314
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:33,110
When are they gonna be on?
- Well, I...

315
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:39,315
I haven't got the deal lock up yet.
When they see you, it's in the bag.

316
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:43,793
Hurry, you're due at the ad council.
- I don't wanna testify against you.

317
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,556
Don't worry, you won't.
- But they're gonna ask questions.

318
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:51,635
Here are the answers.
Memorize this.

319
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,235
Wear this around your neck.

320
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,231
Couldn't I just not show up?

321
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,833
That won't stop Templeton.
This will.

322
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,755
Don't worry,
I'll tell you every move to make.

323
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:10,676
Wait, what's this? Very-tass et...
- Veritas

324
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,833
et probitas super omnia.

325
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,993
That's Latin. That means:

326
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,675
Truth and honor,

327
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,638
above all.

328
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:26,477
That's Mr. Webster's motto?
- It's the code by which he lives.

329
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:30,390
Many's the night
he's walked me to my door,

330
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,873
bowed, kissed my hand
and said, "Rebel...

331
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:39,353
Veritas et probitas super omnia."

332
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,239
This is ridiculous!

333
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,712
Miss Templeton,
please stop challenging your witness.

334
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,236
Obviously, she's been coached.

335
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,438
Or bribed.
He gave you something, didn't he?

336
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,750
Sit down!

337
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,312
It's true. He did give me something.

338
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,949
This.

339
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,835
He asked me to wear it over my heart.
He got it in the army.

340
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,512
Gentlemen,
it's the good conduct medal.

341
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,393
Oh well!
- Would you care to look?

342
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,239
Yes, indeed.

343
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,435
Most inspiring.
May I?

344
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,554
Takes me back a few years...

345
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,109
to my own army days.

346
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,232
Magnificent!

347
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,639
Miss Templeton...
- Would you move on?

348
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:58,795
Gentlemen, if we're through
admiring Mr. Webster's trophies,

349
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,919
I'd like to ask Miss Davis
to tell us about that wild party

350
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,154
he threw last night.
- The revival meeting?

351
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,316
Mr. Webster held a revival?

352
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:14,196
Revival is right!
Everyone there had to be revived.

353
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:18,639
You're making serious charges
against a man who is not here.

354
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,829
That's a very interesting point.
Why isn't he here?

355
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,800
Miss Davis,
do you know where Mr. Webster is?

356
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,800
He's at the Red Cross, donating blood.

357
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,829
They wouldn't take his blood.
It's 86 proof!

358
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,310
Why would he be there now?

359
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:39,076
That's where he's
meeting his Boy Scout troop.

360
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,790
He's a Scout leader?
- He's taking them on a hike

361
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,191
to Inspiration Point.

362
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,156
At the top of the Chrysler building.

363
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,909
The top of the Chrysler building
is not Inspiration Point.

364
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,554
It is to Mr. Webster.

365
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:00,438
It looks down on Madison Avenue.

366
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,429
Miss Templeton?

367
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,189
Have you anything further to say?

368
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,989
Yes.

369
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,388
I'd like my body sent back
to the agency.

370
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:26,511
That was quite a performance,
Miss Davis.

371
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,798
You ain't mad at me?
- Oh no!

372
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:35,913
You should be an actress.
- I am. I'm goin' to Hollywood,

373
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,436
just as soon as I'm famous
as the Vip Girl.

374
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,597
The Vip Girl?

375
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,833
What's Vip?
- It's a brand-new product.

376
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:48,994
Mr. Webster's tryin'
to get the account.

377
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,111
This will be my big chance.

378
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,079
And mine!

379
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,516
Milly, drop what you're doing.
We're after the Vip account.

380
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,639
The what account?
- Vip. V-l-P.

381
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,474
Never heard of it.
- Find out about it.

382
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,476
Jerry Webster's trying to land it,
but we're gonna beat him to it.

383
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,678
Are you sure?
He fights rough.

384
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:22,755
Then we'll fight rough!
This is war, Milly!

385
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,310
That means
liquor, wild parties and girls.

386
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,039
Right?
- Right.

387
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,670
I'd like to volunteer
for frontline duty.

388
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,870
Well, my boy, we did it.

389
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:37,590
We've been absolved by the council.
- Yes.

390
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:42,755
We really put that Templeton woman
in her place. - "We" did.

391
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:46,596
We deserve a reward.
A vacation.

392
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,197
We're gonna go to dad's hunting lodge
in Canada and do nothing:

393
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,636
No radio, no television, no phones.

394
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:56,430
A thousand miles from the nearest
sponsor. - Sounds great.

395
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:59,991
Is it all right
for you to be away from Dr. Melnick?

396
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,874
Must be,
he's the one who suggested it.

397
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,348
What do you say,
you go upstairs and pack?

398
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,432
No, I'm gonna go to the office.

399
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:14,150
You go pack, I'll handle things.
- You?

400
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,869
Melnick says
I've gotta start making decisions.

401
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:21,637
Good, grand.
- That man has worked miracles.

402
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:25,555
Everyone should go through analysis.
- Not everyone can afford it.

403
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:29,316
That's the tragedy of it.
Look at these poor people.

404
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:33,032
They go through life,
contented, happy, laughing,

405
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,874
never knowing how sick they are.

406
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,191
You're sick! Sick!

407
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:46,069
Just a minute, you can't come in
here. Who are you?

408
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,436
I'm Peter Ramsey.

409
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,195
Oh, Mr. Ramsey.

410
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,478
Who are you?
- I'm your secretary.

411
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,188
You're not Elsie.
- No, I'm Deborah.

412
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:04,118
Elsie got married. Jerry...
Mr. Webster hired me.

413
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,392
Well, if there are any calls,
I'm not in.

414
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,029
Yes, sir.

415
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,589
Yeah?

416
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,558
How are we in the copy department?

417
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,030
On the ball? Got the big picture?

418
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:45,671
Come on, nutsy, who is this?
- This is the boss.

419
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:50,551
I'm sorry, Mr. Webster.
- This is Peter Ramsey. Who is this?

420
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,749
Hello?

421
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,915
Memo. To all departments.

422
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,629
Subject: Insubordination.

423
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,110
Certain department heads...

424
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:17,799
Yes, Hadley, come in.
- Oh, Mr. Ramsey, I...

425
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,670
I was looking for Mr. Webster.
- Anything I can handle?

426
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,550
No, sir.
I need a decision.

427
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,997
Now look here, Hadley.
I happen to be company president.

428
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,470
I'll make the decisions.

429
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,269
It really isn't important.

430
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:38,798
I'll decide what's important!
Now, what is it?

431
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:45,271
Commco Film Studios are calling
and wanna know what to do with the...

432
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:48,717
Vip commercials
that Mr. Webster made.

433
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,599
Yes.

434
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,599
Well...

435
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,749
What do we usually do
with commercials? We show them.

436
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:03,039
Mr. Webster didn't brief me
on the Vip account.

437
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,189
Well, it's a lucky thing
I'm here.

438
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,795
Are you familiar with the account?

439
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,435
Who d'you think got the deal?

440
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,871
Oh. Well, congratulations, sir.

441
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:24,792
With a new product, Mr. Webster
starts off with a campaign on TV,

442
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,634
you know, to get the ball rolling.

443
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:33,160
Let's forget Mr. Webster, shall we?
I'm rolling this ball. - Yes, sir.

444
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:37,839
We'll start off
with a campaign on TV.

445
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,920
Yes, sir. Right away.

446
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,029
Dr. Melnick,

447
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,193
Peter Ramsey. I've done it, Doc.

448
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:08,593
I made a decision.
And it was a beauty!

449
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:12,240
425 dollars for a private detective?

450
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,914
Why?

451
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,914
To find Jerry Webster
and track down the Vip account.

452
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,151
Did you find him?

453
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:23,516
No.
- Did you find out who makes Vip?

454
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:28,069
No...
- Did you find out what Vip is?

455
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:33,190
No. But...
- As long as it's money well spent.

456
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:37,909
I want you to forget the Vip account.
Webster's got it.

457
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,631
But I don't believe it.

458
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:45,830
Rebel Davis, the Vip Girl herself,
told me he didn't have the account.

459
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:49,550
That same day, he disappeared.
Something is wrong.

460
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:54,953
What about all those commercials
on television all week?

461
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,871
I still say something's wrong.

462
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:03,274
Mr. Bracket, please give me more time
and I'll prove it to you.

463
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,793
Okay.

464
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,950
But if this detective doesn't find
what you're looking for,

465
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,749
there's something else he might
find for you.

466
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,640
A new job?
- Exactly.

467
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,191
I already told him.

468
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,950
This is the forest primeval,

469
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:39,750
just as it was
at the dawn of civilization.

470
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,754
And this is how
the first man explored it:

471
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,991
In a birch bark canoe,

472
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:49,279
pitting his skill and strength
against the forces of nature.

473
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,990
Survival of the fittest,
that's the law here.

474
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:10,636
Harrison has run out of road.
- Good, he might scare the game.

475
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:18,789
What is that?
- The mating call of the moose.

476
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,394
This call
is absolutely irresistible.

477
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:30,158
Your bull moose will run 20 miles
to get to the source of this call.

478
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,637
And then what happens?
- I take his picture.

479
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,473
Pete, he's not running 20 miles
to get photographed.

480
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,677
I suggest you stop blowing that.

481
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,230
You just leave
the decisions to me.

482
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,200
The same wise leadership that

483
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:53,957
saved us from a costly blunder will
see us through. - Costly blunder?

484
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,240
You've been so relaxed,
I haven't wanted to tell ya.

485
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:03,350
You've goofed. If it weren't for me,
those Vip ads wouldn't be on air.

486
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,554
They're on?

487
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:08,793
A saturation campaign, my boy.

488
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,915
Now, Pete, don't panic. Turn around!

489
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:18,995
What's wrong? - Turn around!
- What's wrong? - We've got to go.

490
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,311
What's wrong?
- Start paddling!

491
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:24,632
I have a right to know!
- There's no such product!

492
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,393
But...

493
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:31,509
But you made films!
- They were to keep Rebel in line.

494
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,070
I told ya
sex would get you into trouble!

495
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,670
Never mind me. Convince that fella!

496
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,195
Here she is!

497
00:37:55,840 --> 00:38:00,436
Look at these letters.
Drugstores, wholesalers calling.

498
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,478
All these people want Vip.

499
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,873
We've sold a product that doesn't
exist. We've ruined the agency!

500
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,589
Relax, Pete.
- Dad'll kill me!

501
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,117
Your dad's dead and gone!
- No, he isn't.

502
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,159
He wouldn't leave this
business with someone like me.

503
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,279
Don't just sit there.
Let's do something!

504
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:24,912
Send Hadley in.
- That's it. We'll pin the rap on him.

505
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,910
Sure! It's our word against his.
Let them break Hadley.

506
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,993
He's not a senior executive.
He's expendable.

507
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,311
That's how Dad would've done it.

508
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,559
Come in,
come in, Hadley.

509
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,034
Webster has something to tell ya.

510
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,712
Telephone Commco Films.
We wanna make more Vip commercials.

511
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:50,350
More commercials?
- On the double!

512
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:55,239
Right. - Are you out of your mind?
There's no such product as Vip.

513
00:38:55,640 --> 00:39:00,111
People wanna spend their money on
Vip. It's only fair we give it them.

514
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:03,671
Where do we get it?
- We invent it.

515
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,873
Can we do that?
- Why not?

516
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,589
That's not the way it's done.

517
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:16,515
You're supposed to have the product
first. Then you go out and sell it.

518
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:23,239
Pete! You are pioneering a method
that'll make you a legend. - It will?

519
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:27,394
The most convincing demonstration
of the power of advertising.

520
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:31,236
You have sold a product
that doesn't exist.

521
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,790
Yes! By thunder!

522
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,918
Even Dad didn't do that.
- Right.

523
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:39,039
I don't think I better either.
- You have no choice.

524
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,000
We come up with Vip or you're ruined.

525
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:48,555
Kelly, I want five $1,000 bills
and the address of Dr. Linus Tyler.

526
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,075
Linus Tyler?

527
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,314
Only he can come up with Vip.
- No. He's a troublemaker.

528
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:58,235
He's been fired by 3 companies.
- He's brilliant and needs money.

529
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,915
No. Money can't buy him.

530
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:04,710
As Dad always said, don't
trust a man who can't be bribed.

531
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:08,078
Isn't it comforting to know
you can trust me?

532
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:16,109
Boss, your private eye called.
Webster's back in town.

533
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,351
He followed him to this address.

534
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:22,469
Dr. Linus Tyler. Who's he?
- He won a Nobel prize in chemistry.

535
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:27,112
He did that testimonial for
Mother Murphy's Home-made Soup.

536
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:32,992
They asked him to analyze the soup
and say what Mother Murphy put in it.

537
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:36,597
He did. Broke the company
and jailed Mother Murphy.

538
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:43,111
Milly, why would Jerry Webster
be interested in a brilliant chemist?

539
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:45,989
Vip?

540
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,709
Vip.

541
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,954
I'll bet Tyler's the inventor!

542
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,397
You're wasting your time.

543
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,110
Nothing could induce me

544
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,990
to again associate myself
with that dull group, the human race.

545
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:14,836
That's a very wise decision.
You've quit the world!

546
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:19,028
They didn't appreciate me,
now let them suffer.

547
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,272
They want to be misled.

548
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,754
I invented a hair tonic superior
to anything else.

549
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,593
Would the public buy it?

550
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:34,518
Not until they were told it contained
a secret ingredient: TR2748.

551
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:38,071
Do you know what TR2748 was?

552
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,516
My phone number.

553
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:44,879
Now with Vip, the idiots
have reached the millenium.

554
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,391
They've bought nothing!

555
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,119
That's right.

556
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,990
Unless you come up with something.
- Never!

557
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,639
Here, in the comfort of
my laboratory, I'm happy...

558
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:04,751
and have the companionship of the one
person worthy of my company:

559
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,639
Myself.

560
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,511
I want for nothing.

561
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:13,069
You're one man who can do it.

562
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:16,870
I will never again
prostitute my genius.

563
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:20,997
Not for all the gold
on Madison Avenue.

564
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,549
How soon do you need it?

565
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,269
Welcome
back to the world, Doctor.

566
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,472
We're completely versatile.
Vip can be anything:

567
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:49,793
Soft drink, skin lotion, soap,
cigarettes, toothpaste, anything.

568
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,668
The important thing is speed.

569
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:56,675
If I can help you in any way...
- It's very kind of you.

570
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:01,312
If you'll carry on here,
I'll get some supplies. - Fine.

571
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:14,035
Doctor Tyler?
- Oh, I... - Carol Templeton.

572
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:16,754
Carol Templeton.

573
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:24,276
I would like to talk about Vip.
It is your product, isn't it?

574
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,909
Yes, I invented it.
- Good.

575
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:33,839
Doctor, have you signed
with Jerry Webster? - Why?

576
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:39,394
I'm with another agency. And
I have some marvelous ideas

577
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:41,870
for Vip.
- Really?

578
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:45,750
If you don't like what I've got,
I'll get more. - Fair enough.

579
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,071
I'll be there day and night.

580
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:51,909
I see.

581
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:56,479
Doctor, there's nothing I won't do
to get this account.

582
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:00,759
I haven't signed
with Webster.

583
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:05,672
Oh, Dr. Tyler, I'm so happy.

584
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:08,310
I know this is going to work out.
- Yes.

585
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,110
I think it has possibilities.

586
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:15,869
Shall we sit down and I'll tell you
my ideas? - No.

587
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,794
Not here. It's too dangerous.

588
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,992
All these experiments...

589
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:25,029
You mean there could be an explosion?
- Exactly.

590
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,034
If I'm not careful,
this whole thing could blow up.

591
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,831
V Day is coming.

592
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,516
I like it very much.

593
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:38,117
Thank you, Doctor.
- Got any more ideas?

594
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:41,193
Not yet. But I
could put the office to work.

595
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:42,589
Good!

596
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:48,269
As soon as you tell me what Vip is.
- That's a problem.

597
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:50,189
Problem?

598
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:54,349
Mr. Webster's whole strategy
is secrecy.

599
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:58,355
To get people talking about Vip
and wondering what it is.

600
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:01,638
I promised him
I wouldn't reveal it to anyone.

601
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:04,235
Until I decide to sign with him

602
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:08,792
or someone else, I feel
I must respect my promise.

603
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,349
Naturally.

604
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,350
And I admire your integrity.
- Miss Templeton,

605
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:18,833
I have a code,
and I told this to Webster too:

606
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,708
Veritas et probitas super omnia.

607
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,990
So that's where he stole it!
- Pardon?

608
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:33,316
I wonder if you know the man
you're dealing with. - Webster? - Yes.

609
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:39,395
I guess I don't. I've only seen him
a dozen or so times.

610
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,791
Well, what's your opinion?

611
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:45,751
I prefer to reserve judgment
till I see him sober.

612
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,476
Doesn't that tell you what he is?

613
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:54,633
Miss Templeton, as my uncle,
the missionary, used to say,

614
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:58,949
"If thou canst not speak
well of a man, speak not at all."

615
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,590
You make me feel ashamed.

616
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,877
Oh, no please, I...

617
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:12,039
I cannot presume to judge.

618
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:15,750
I am but a humble chemist.
- Oh no,

619
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:19,835
'
you re a genius,
and a great humanitarian.

620
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,993
And I want to
know you better.

621
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:27,554
Doctor,
there's so much I can learn from you.

622
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:33,397
As my father, the philosopher,
used to say,

623
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:38,075
"Knock at my door
and I shall take you in."

624
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,113
Dr. Tyler,

625
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:43,873
I'm knocking.

626
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,392
Miss Templeton,

627
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,677
I'm taking you in.

628
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:54,358
And it was there,
in the seclusion of my laboratory,

629
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:58,309
that the idea came
for this wonderful new product.

630
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:04,317
For a while I was determined
not to share it with the world.

631
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:09,510
Then I remembered the words
of my grandfather, the philanthropist:

632
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:14,593
"The joy of living
is the joy of giving."

633
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:19,672
Oh my!
What a magnificent family!

634
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:25,913
Missionary... philanthropist...
a philosopher... doctor...

635
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:27,719
Doctor?

636
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:29,109
You!

637
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:32,319
Oh, yes. Me.

638
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:37,032
When you said doctor, I thought
of my brother, the jungle surgeon.

639
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,396
He was the real doctor.

640
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:41,469
Was?

641
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:46,039
He went into the interior
to treat this tribe of sick natives.

642
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:49,557
Got them back on their feet,
restored their appetites,

643
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:52,952
discovered too late
that they were cannibals.

644
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:56,394
Oh, how awful!
- Yes.

645
00:47:57,720 --> 00:47:59,870
His last words were:

646
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:02,271
"Better me than Schweitzer."

647
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:08,516
You mean they have advertising
in Nebraska? - Yes.

648
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:12,197
Of course, it was a small agency,
in Omaha.

649
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:15,990
Somehow one of my ads came to the
attention of Mr. Bracket,

650
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,470
and he offered me a job in New York.

651
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:21,599
How do you like Madison Avenue?
- Oh, I love it.

652
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,878
I love the creative challenge.

653
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:28,352
It's the social challenge
that presents a bit of a problem.

654
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,869
You see, in my business,

655
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:36,633
I'm called upon to do
some entertaining.

656
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,474
That usually involves some drinking.

657
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:43,876
And that's a problem?
- Yes, I don't drink.

658
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,598
Neither do I.

659
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:48,958
It's not that I object.

660
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,430
It's just I can't tolerate alcohol.

661
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:56,277
One little glass of champagne and
I become completely irresponsible.

662
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:58,636
Is that a fact?
- Yes.

663
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:04,717
As a chemist, you must understand.
- I might be able to do something.

664
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:08,279
Would you try?
- You may depend on it.

665
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:15,479
I'd better be getting back.
Mr. Webster mentioned dinner...

666
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:18,269
Oh, don't have dinner with him!
- What?

667
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:22,753
Let me take you to dinner.
There's so much I want to talk about.

668
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:25,230
I'll have more ideas for Vip.

669
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:27,232
Well, I...
- Please!

670
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:31,956
All right. - Good, I'll pick you up
at 7 at your lab. - Fine.

671
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:35,272
Oh, no. Not there. I'm moving.

672
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:39,229
Mr. Webster's
getting me a hotel suite.

673
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:41,599
Don't let him do that!

674
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,470
I mean, I'll get you a hotel suite.
- Miss Templeton...

675
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:48,348
But my agency will pay for it.

676
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:52,912
Please! - You don't even know if
I'll give you the Vip account.

677
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:56,912
I know you'll make
a fair and wise decision.

678
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:02,432
A woman senses
when a man can be trusted.

679
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:05,479
And you, Doctor, can be trusted.

680
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,039
Excuse me.

681
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:28,950
Rockefeller couldn't buy
a better suit than this.

682
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:32,158
$24.95 and
I throw in a pair of knickers.

683
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:34,149
No.

684
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:38,429
Haven't you got the kind
that was in style 5 or 6 years ago?

685
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:40,429
Have we!

686
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:45,630
Esther! Bring down the suit
we made for Prince Rainier's wedding.

687
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:49,635
Prince or no prince,
he didn't pick it up, he loses it.

688
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:53,916
One... two... three... together.

689
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:58,591
One... two... three... together.

690
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,117
Doctor. - One...
- I should have explained.

691
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:05,796
On "together", you bring
your feet together, not us.

692
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:09,715
Oh, I'm sorry.
- It's all right. You're doing well.

693
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:15,157
One... two... three... together.

694
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:18,472
Actually, we should
be together all the time.

695
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:21,348
This way
I can sense your next move.

696
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,791
How about that?

697
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,668
It's awfully nice of you
to teach me.

698
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:29,957
It's my pleasure.

699
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:33,591
I taught a Nobel
Prize winner. - Oh really? Who?

700
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:39,431
Oh, Dr. Tyler. You're very modest.

701
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,152
Oh, well...

702
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:46,630
I never think of myself
as a Nobel Prize winner.

703
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:51,795
It's my cousin Maurice who should
have it. He will, if he gets back.

704
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,872
Gets back?
- Yes.

705
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:00,234
Will you swear never to repeat
what I tell you? - I swear.

706
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:05,837
Central intelligence refers to
my cousin as the "human satellite".

707
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:08,914
You mean...
- Yes.

708
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:12,471
He was launched from
Cape Canaveral 4 days ago.

709
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:16,270
Every 97 minutes,
Maurice passes over this club.

710
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:23,751
Now you can understand why
I don't like to talk about myself.

711
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:35,512
I'm having a wonderful time.
- Good.

712
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,911
I really hate to leave.

713
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:40,038
Where are you going?

714
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:44,319
I have a meeting with Mr. Webster.
- Oh, Doctor, why?

715
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,995
Well, I...
- Please, sit down.

716
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:50,750
I'm not even thinking business,

717
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:53,879
but I hate to see you
associate with someone like Webster.

718
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:58,117
You're so cultured, so refined,

719
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:00,158
so innoc...

720
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,870
You're so nice.
- No.

721
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:06,236
Say it: Innocent.

722
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:08,518
That's what I am.

723
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:11,914
You're a gentleman.
- I'm dull.

724
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:15,753
One phase of my education
is completely lacking.

725
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:18,310
But Mr. Webster can teach me.

726
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:21,678
Oh, Doctor. You've missed nothing.

727
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:25,834
He had a long talk with me.
I've missed it.

728
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:31,159
There's nothing worthwhile
you can learn from Webster.

729
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:36,351
I find him very intriguing,
in a man-to-man sort of way.

730
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:41,399
Anyway, I've never seen
the places he wants to show me.

731
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:47,837
What places?
- Well, I'm kinda embarrassed...

732
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:52,630
Doctor, you know you can talk to me.
Where's he taking you?

733
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:57,549
Well, it's kind of a nightclub...

734
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:00,394
They have these girls...

735
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:03,277
They remove their...

736
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:06,998
They strip!

737
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:10,599
Say, I think
that's the word he used!

738
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:13,431
He said I'd enjoy it.

739
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:18,556
Do you think
you'd enjoy watching a girl undress?

740
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:22,714
I don't know.
But I'm willing to give it a try.

741
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:29,749
All right.

742
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:34,354
If you want a burlesque,
you don't need Mr. Webster.

743
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:38,070
I'll take you.
- You? - Me.

744
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:41,036
Oh, waiter. Cheque, please.

745
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,874
Hey, Charlie, isn't that him?

746
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:49,312
I think it is.

747
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:52,110
Keep the change.
- Thank you.

748
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:58,520
Oh, I almost forgot.
I got you a suite at the Royal Plaza.

749
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:04,389
It just doesn't seem right,
a man letting a woman pay.

750
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:07,997
Well, you're not exactly
an ordinary man.

751
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:13,278
It's him.

752
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:16,513
I wonder why
he grew the beard?

753
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:19,070
When has he got time to shave?

754
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:45,558
Remarkable muscle control!

755
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:48,232
Remarkable.

756
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:55,315
Say,

757
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:59,508
how do you suppose she...
- I really wouldn't know.

758
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:05,671
Doctor, would you please stop?

759
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:07,798
I'm sorry.

760
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:13,592
And I'm sorry we went
to that place. - Are you? - Yes.

761
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:18,238
From now on, I'll leave
that education to Mr. Webster.

762
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:21,598
You mean,
you found that educational?

763
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,355
We never studied anything like that.

764
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:30,998
I only saw girls in the lab, and they
had on those long white coats.

765
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:36,634
I had no idea what was
going on under those coats!

766
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:39,998
Doctor, do you mind
if we change the subject?

767
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,391
No.
- Thank you.

768
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:47,275
What would you like to talk about?

769
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:49,830
Anything but Jerry Webster.

770
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,514
All right.

771
00:56:57,080 --> 00:57:00,834
You hate this suit, don't you?
- Oh no, no.

772
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:03,592
It's very colorful.

773
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:07,990
I'm afraid
it's the only new suit I have.

774
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:11,878
But tomorrow I'm getting
a new wardrobe from Mist...

775
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:15,348
Oh, I forgot.
You don't wanna talk about him.

776
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:19,477
Webster's buying you a new
wardrobe? - He insisted.

777
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:22,440
Doctor, let me buy it.
- Oh, I couldn't.

778
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:25,559
But I've told you,
my agency is paying for it.

779
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:30,238
They've given me carte blanche.
We'll go first thing in the morning.

780
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:34,115
And, uh, Linus?

781
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:37,349
Yes?

782
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:41,310
How long have you had that beard?

783
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:44,598
Don't you like it?
- Yes, I do.

784
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,309
It's very impressive.

785
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:50,871
Makes you look so distinguished,
so intellectual.

786
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:54,317
So handsome. It's magnificent.

787
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:57,154
You'd like me to get rid of it.
- Would you?

788
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:05,388
Say!

789
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:09,873
Your husband's a doll without
the beard! - Yes!

790
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:14,469
I mean, he's not my husband.

791
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:26,429
I don't like it.
Maybe she'll go back to the lab.

792
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:30,879
Maybe she'll find out you're not
Tyler, that there's no Vip.

793
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:33,919
Maybe the world will end.
- Do you think?

794
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:38,550
Relax. I'm gonna keep
Miss Templeton busy day and night.

795
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:43,192
People want Vip. We haven't got it!
- We'll get it!

796
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:52,996
One of the most
brilliant chemists is working on it.

797
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,595
He may even have it now.

798
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:04,469
Dr. Tyler!
- Over here, my boy.

799
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:09,393
What exploded?
- Vip!

800
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:15,431
I know I said it could be toothpaste,
but isn't this the hard way?

801
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:18,308
It's not as mundane as toothpaste.

802
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:23,275
I seem to have made a mistake.
It all looked so simple.

803
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:29,118
You know yet what Vip is gonna be?
- Vip will be the miracle product.

804
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:32,796
It'll bring relief to the suffering,
joy to the depressed,

805
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:37,159
inspiration to the artistic and peace
to the world, all for only 10 cents.

806
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:40,313
Fabulous. It is a miracle product.

807
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:43,473
How soon will you have it?
- The product I have.

808
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:48,795
There are still bugs in the miracle.
- Keep at it. It'll make you immortal.

809
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:53,751
Boss. I brought the mail.
- I'll be right there, Milly.

810
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:58,551
How's the hermit?
- Who? - The mad chemist.

811
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:02,999
Oh, Linus? He's fine.

812
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:04,628
Linus!

813
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:08,191
We're spending the day together,
playing golf.

814
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:11,791
Hallelujah!
Today, you are a woman.

815
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:14,918
Think he'll like it?

816
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:18,312
If he doesn't,
he's taking the wrong chemicals.

817
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:40,997
That was fun!

818
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:49,791
You did amazingly well for only
one lesson. - Thank you.

819
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:53,837
I'm sorry
I made you drive so far out.

820
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:57,630
Such a lonely stretch of beach.
- That's all right.

821
01:01:58,360 --> 01:02:01,636
Really, you shouldn't be embarrassed.
- Well, I...

822
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:05,032
You look wonderful without your
clothes. - So do you.

823
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:09,431
I meant...
- So did I.

824
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:14,078
Carol, I...
- Yes?

825
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:17,710
There's something I'd like to ask.

826
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:20,114
Go ahead.

827
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:23,351
I'm afraid you might misunderstand.

828
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:26,395
No. Ask it.

829
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:32,557
Do you have any more ideas for Vip?

830
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:35,755
What?

831
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:39,280
I hate to ask it,

832
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:42,513
but after what Mr. Webster said...

833
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:44,717
What did he say?

834
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:49,716
When I mentioned your idea, he said
it was the last one you'd have.

835
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:53,669
What? - He said you were
strictly a one-idea person.

836
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:57,959
If there's anyone on Madison Avenue
who's a one-idea person, it's him.

837
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:01,193
His whole career's been
built on one idea: Sex.

838
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:08,473
Funny. You claim he's
oversexed and he claims you're...

839
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:12,552
I'm what?

840
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:15,312
I'd rather not tell you.

841
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:19,474
Well, I'm not undersexed!
- I'm sure you're not.

842
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:28,036
It's true, I haven't come up
with any new thoughts.

843
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:29,429
But...

844
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:32,999
We've been having so much fun
in the last few days.

845
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:40,954
I promise, tomorrow morning
I'm gonna bring you great ideas.

846
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:43,874
Good! That'll teach Webster.

847
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:47,549
Now,

848
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:50,555
let's talk about something inspiring.

849
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:58,109
I wonder where Maurice is.

850
01:03:58,520 --> 01:03:59,589
Who?

851
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,231
Your cousin. The human satellite.

852
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:04,834
Oh, him.

853
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:10,588
Right now, he's over Russia.

854
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:16,673
Oh, brave, wonderful man.
- Yes.

855
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:22,634
I've often pondered his last words.
They were so cryptic.

856
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:27,272
What did he say?
- He said, "Cousin Linus,

857
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:32,068
life is like outer space:
Explore it today,

858
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:36,996
for tomorrow you may not be able
to get it off the launching pad."

859
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:39,716
I wonder what he meant.

860
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:44,153
He meant, enjoy life now,
before it's too late.

861
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:52,033
You know, there is something
I'd enjoy doing right now.

862
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:55,678
But I don't know how.

863
01:04:57,640 --> 01:04:58,914
Well, let's see...

864
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:03,956
I've taught you dancing,
golf,

865
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:05,873
how to swim...

866
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:10,271
What is it you'd like to do now?

867
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:12,593
I'd like to...

868
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:15,795
kiss you, but I...

869
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:20,668
That's even easier than dancing.

870
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:47,512
This may be your best subject.

871
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:50,829
Hi, Kelly.

872
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:54,277
Mr. Ramsey's been trying to reach
you. - Thank you.

873
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:56,557
He's at your apartment.

874
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:59,952
My apartment?
- He says it's very urgent.

875
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:07,035
Hello, Pete.
What are you doing in my apartment?

876
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:10,398
Waiting for you.
- How are things going with Tyler?

877
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:15,078
Things are lousy with Dr. Tyler.
Get over here right away.

878
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:19,519
Why don't you come to the office?
- I tried to. I've been thrown out.

879
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:21,353
I'll be right there.

880
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:29,435
It's no use, I'm marked for life.

881
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:33,719
Have you tried alcohol?
- Yes. I had three martinis.

882
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:36,839
I warned you
not to hire that madman!

883
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:39,196
Here, try this kind.

884
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:48,031
Thanks.
- No. Rub it on your face. Here.

885
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:51,872
He's not a chemist.
He's a frustrated munitions maker.

886
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:55,511
He'll never come up with Vip.
We'll be exposed.

887
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:58,753
This'll be the biggest scandal
that hit Madison Avenue.

888
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:01,355
The agency's through.

889
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:04,149
There's only one way out: Suicide.

890
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:09,350
All right. - We'll get Hadley to
commit suicide and pin it on him.

891
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:11,910
You may have trouble with that.

892
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:16,359
He wouldn't dare refuse.
His job depends on it.

893
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:19,558
We'll go see Tyler first thing.
I'll meet you there at nine.

894
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:23,555
No, sir, you're not getting out
of my sight till we get Vip.

895
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:28,158
Okay, you can stay here tonight.
You have the bed. I'll take the couch.

896
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:31,199
Is the alcohol working?
- Yes, it is.

897
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:34,398
My face isn't purple anymore?
- No.

898
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:38,829
Thanks.

899
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:54,590
V DAY IS COMING

900
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:57,990
He stole it!

901
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:25,392
I'm coming.

902
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:32,549
Linus!

903
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:34,951
What are you doing here?

904
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:37,352
Where am I?

905
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:41,469
This is Jerry Webster's apartment.

906
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:44,391
How did you get here?

907
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:49,958
Are you all right?

908
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:54,120
Try to think.
- I am.

909
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:57,429
Was he waiting for you at your hotel?
- Yes.

910
01:08:57,840 --> 01:09:01,230
How did he get you to come here?
- Well, I...

911
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:03,710
Let me see.

912
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:06,475
He probably
gave you something to drink.

913
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:08,359
Yes.

914
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:10,990
You should have refused.
- Well, I...

915
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:16,914
I would have, but I was so dizzy
from that cigarette he gave me.

916
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:20,918
What kind of cigarette?
- I don't know.

917
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:23,311
It didn't have any printing.

918
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:26,279
Oh, Linus!

919
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:30,790
Oh, that depraved monster!

920
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:36,438
It's time somebody...
- Wait!

921
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,150
You'd better let me look first.

922
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:48,790
You can't go in there.

923
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:53,398
Why not?
- Because he's not alone.

924
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:55,957
You mean there's a...
- Two!

925
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:58,590
Both famous actresses.

926
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:04,440
Hurry and dress.
We're getting out.

927
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:07,479
They're waking up.
- Come on!

928
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:10,473
All right...

929
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:13,631
We're getting out of here.

930
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:18,436
Where will I get dressed.
- At my place.

931
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:21,718
I'm not leaving you
with those actresses.

932
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:24,749
There goes Superman.

933
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:27,037
Makes you realize how old we are.

934
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:30,398
If he doesn't slow down,
he'll catch up with us.

935
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:40,469
I just can't believe Webster
would steal someone else's idea.

936
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:45,872
You're so decent, it's hard for you
to think ill of anyone.

937
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:49,272
I guess I do
trust everybody.

938
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:52,433
I've put your things
in the maid's room.

939
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:53,989
Thank you.

940
01:10:57,440 --> 01:11:00,193
Where's your maid?
I don't have one. I just use it

941
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:02,033
as a guest room.

942
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:10,839
You know, I almost hate
to go back to the hotel.

943
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:14,710
Webster's bound to come over,
and I don't feel like talking to him.

944
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:16,997
Well, don't go back.

945
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:20,870
Maybe I shouldn't. I'm kind of
disillusioned with Webster.

946
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:23,157
I should think so.

947
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:27,509
Maybe I shouldn't let him
handle the Vip account.

948
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:32,795
Whatever you think, Linus.

949
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:37,189
It's your decision.

950
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:42,355
If only I had a quiet place where
I could think about this overnight.

951
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:46,073
Some place where
Webster couldn't find me.

952
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:52,597
Linus?
- Yes?

953
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,230
I know a place.

954
01:11:56,440 --> 01:11:58,556
Really? Where?

955
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:01,076
Right here, in that guest room.

956
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:08,878
In your apartment? Alone with you?

957
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:11,350
All night?

958
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:17,075
It's like a separate apartment,
with a lock and its own entrance.

959
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:20,472
I don't know.
- Oh, Linus.

960
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:22,999
We're adults.
- Yes, but...

961
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:26,040
Look at it calmy and sensibly.

962
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:29,557
You won't be disturbed here.
- Right.

963
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:33,873
You can concentrate
on what you want to do. - True.

964
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:39,035
Well then. For what you have
in mind, isn't this the best place?

965
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:42,310
I guess maybe it is.

966
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:54,555
I don't care how you do it, or what it
is, we must have Vip tomorrow.

967
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:57,872
What I'm working on
is highly volatile.

968
01:12:58,280 --> 01:13:02,159
What I'm working on
is highly volatile too.

969
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:04,516
That only gives me tonight.

970
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:07,992
Believe me, Doc,
I'm in the same boat.

971
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:21,630
Hello? Mr. Bracket.

972
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:27,558
I'm here with Mr. Gaines. I'm filling
him in on Vip. How does it look?

973
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:29,757
Marvelous!

974
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:33,590
Dr. Tyler's having dinner here.

975
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:37,913
Fine. We'll expect good news
in the morning. Goodnight.

976
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:41,915
Looks pretty good.
Dr. Tyler's having dinner with her.

977
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:44,117
Tyler, in a woman's apartment?

978
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:50,311
Why not? Miss Templeton's attractive.
- I know Tyler. He's a woman-hater.

979
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:55,555
Maybe he used to be. But Jenkins
saw them dancing the other night.

980
01:13:55,960 --> 01:13:57,951
Linus Tyler, out dancing?

981
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:02,154
Something's wrong. Come on.
- Where to?

982
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:04,790
Greenwich Village, to see Tyler.

983
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:07,998
More coffee?
- No, thank you.

984
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:11,393
You know...

985
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:18,271
I have a small bottle of champagne
someone gave me. And...

986
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:21,319
I debated whether
to open it tonight.

987
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:26,869
But knowing how susceptible we...
- You were right.

988
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:31,795
In view of the situation,

989
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:35,473
being here alone,

990
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:39,872
I think we should be especially...
- Definitely.

991
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:45,316
I'll help you with the dishes.

992
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:47,915
Oh, I wouldn't think of it.

993
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:50,351
It's a woman's job.

994
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:53,399
Well...
- Make yourself comfortable.

995
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:58,395
It's ten thirty.
I'd better be getting to bed.

996
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:05,155
Thank you for a delightful evening.

997
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:08,279
You're a wonderful cook,
charming company,

998
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:12,514
and some day, you'll make
some man a very fine wife.

999
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:15,193
Thank you, Linus.

1000
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:19,636
Some day, you'll make
some lucky woman a fine husband.

1001
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:22,391
That's kind of you.

1002
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:27,118
I'm afraid I could never get
married. Goodnight.

1003
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:31,593
Wait!

1004
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:35,711
Why can't you get married?

1005
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:40,476
It's the sort of thing a man
doesn't discuss with a woman.

1006
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:42,472
Oh, Linus.

1007
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:44,879
What is it?

1008
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:48,593
Carol, I'm going to say something
that'll shock you.

1009
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:52,197
Do you know who I wish I were?
Jerry Webster!

1010
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:54,596
Oh no!
- Yes! - Why?

1011
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,912
Because he's everything I'm not.

1012
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:03,394
He's a man of the world.
He's smooth, confident, experienced.

1013
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:05,119
He's a real man.

1014
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:07,715
You're the real man!
- Am I? - Yes.

1015
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:13,720
Look at me. Here I am,
alone with a beautiful girl.

1016
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:16,998
It's ten thirty,
and for me the evening is over.

1017
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:20,472
Oh, Linus!
- Do you know what Webster would do?

1018
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:24,318
In two minutes,
he'd maneuver you into that bedroom!

1019
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:26,519
Oh, I'm sorry.

1020
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:31,557
I didn't know what I was saying.
I didn't mean it.

1021
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:35,316
I know you didn't.
- But I feel so insecure.

1022
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:38,234
Oh, Linus, stop torturing yourself.

1023
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:42,958
Now you know
why I'm afraid to get married.

1024
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:45,157
I'm afraid,

1025
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:47,278
afraid I'll be a failure.

1026
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:51,150
But you won't.
I know.

1027
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:54,196
A woman knows these things.

1028
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:59,117
Don't lie to me, please. I'd rather
have your scorn than pity.

1029
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:04,109
Linus, listen to me:

1030
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:06,829
It isn't pity,
and I didn't lie.

1031
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:12,439
You kissed me and I was thrilled.
- A kiss. What does that prove?

1032
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:16,750
If you can light a stove,
it still doesn't make you a cook.

1033
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:19,754
Listen to me. Look at me.

1034
01:17:20,160 --> 01:17:22,628
I can't. I'm too ashamed.

1035
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:26,400
Forget me, Carol.
You deserve a man,

1036
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:29,712
not a mass
of neurotic doubts.

1037
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:33,757
Oh, Linus,
you mustn't have these doubts.

1038
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:37,914
You're tearing yourself apart.
You're a fine, brilliant man.

1039
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:40,436
Sure. Brilliant chemist!

1040
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:42,319
Phi Beta Kappa!

1041
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:44,870
Nobel Prize Winner!

1042
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:49,273
I'd trade all of my knowledge
to know how to make a woman love me.

1043
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:52,795
You can.
- No.

1044
01:17:54,160 --> 01:17:55,434
That's not true.

1045
01:17:57,280 --> 01:18:02,718
You're a kind, sensitive person.
- But not the man a woman could love.

1046
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:06,749
Of course you are.
- But I don't know.

1047
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:10,956
Linus, don't do this to yourself!

1048
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:13,715
Any woman would love you.

1049
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:18,999
If only
I could be sure of that.

1050
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:32,599
Wait here.

1051
01:18:57,200 --> 01:19:01,239
Shall I resist my heart?

1052
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:08,868
Shall I deny it's splendor?

1053
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:16,190
Shall I insist we part?

1054
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:22,475
Should I surrender?

1055
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:28,999
Should I be fire or ice?

1056
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:36,828
Should I be firm or tender?

1057
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:43,591
Should I be bad...

1058
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,752
or nice?

1059
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:51,309
Should I surrender?

1060
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:57,076
His pleading words so tenderly

1061
01:19:58,440 --> 01:20:02,194
entreat me.

1062
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:06,279
Is this the night

1063
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:15,353
that love finally defeats me?

1064
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:22,752
Should I avoid his touch?

1065
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:29,756
Should I be a shy pretender?

1066
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:37,993
Should I admit

1067
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:44,191
I'd much rather surrender?

1068
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:29,396
Yes?

1069
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:34,078
Miss Templeton, I don't usually
discharge employees on the phone.

1070
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:36,914
But in your case,
I'm making an exception.

1071
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:39,993
I just left Dr. Tyler,
and he never heard of you!

1072
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:41,629
What?

1073
01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:46,679
But that's impossible!
He's here right now.

1074
01:21:47,080 --> 01:21:50,390
I don't know who you're
entertaining, but it's not Tyler.

1075
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,319
Carol?

1076
01:22:57,680 --> 01:22:59,159
Yes, darling?

1077
01:22:59,560 --> 01:23:01,198
Take my hand.

1078
01:23:08,120 --> 01:23:10,350
I'm not afraid anymore.

1079
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:12,713
Oh, that's good.

1080
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:14,799
What are you going to do?

1081
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:19,236
I'm going to give you confidence.

1082
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:22,349
Be gentle!

1083
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:29,791
Of course, darling.

1084
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:37,194
Remember that lonely stretch of beach
where we first kissed?

1085
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:43,157
Let's go back there.
- Now?

1086
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:44,993
Yes.

1087
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:48,429
To recapture the magic
of that moment.

1088
01:23:48,840 --> 01:23:50,751
But I feel pretty magic here.

1089
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:52,912
There's a full moon.

1090
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:55,831
We'll have a midnight swim.

1091
01:23:56,960 --> 01:23:58,951
But it's thirty miles.

1092
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:03,152
And I don't have my bathing suit.

1093
01:24:07,480 --> 01:24:09,198
Oh, Linus.

1094
01:24:10,520 --> 01:24:13,398
My sweet, innocent darling.

1095
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:18,397
We don't need bathing suits.

1096
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:28,233
Trust me,

1097
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:33,473
my precious.
- Oh, I do. I do.

1098
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:42,556
I'm terribly embarrassed.
- No need to be, darling.

1099
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:46,836
After you get into the water,
I'll join you.

1100
01:24:47,240 --> 01:24:48,719
Okay.

1101
01:24:51,480 --> 01:24:54,677
Well, that's it.
Now it's your turn.

1102
01:24:55,080 --> 01:24:56,229
Yes.

1103
01:24:57,240 --> 01:24:58,992
Now it's my turn.

1104
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:02,116
Goodnight, Mr. Webster!

1105
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:06,389
Hey, wait! Come back!

1106
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,992
I'm losing
my confidence again!

1107
01:25:21,560 --> 01:25:23,630
I've picked up a few hitchhikers,

1108
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:29,034
but you were a weird sight,
running along in seaweed shorts!

1109
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:40,398
I'll have your coat back
in a minute.

1110
01:25:55,880 --> 01:25:57,313
Hey, Fred!

1111
01:25:58,680 --> 01:25:59,999
Look!

1112
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:19,756
That's the last guy
I would have figured.

1113
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:23,354
There'll be no slip-up this time,
Mr. Northcross.

1114
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:26,194
You subpoena Jerry Webster,

1115
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:30,513
and I'll present enough evidence
to put him behind bars.

1116
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:34,469
They've been advertising
a product that doesn't exist.

1117
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:35,949
Yes!

1118
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:40,190
I've already spoken to the
District Attorney. He'll be there.

1119
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:44,999
No, Mr. Northcross,
I'm not trying to stall for time.

1120
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:49,871
It just happens that
11 o'clock is when I donate blood.

1121
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:53,750
They need it.
It's a very rare type.

1122
01:26:55,240 --> 01:26:57,800
Eleven o'clock. I'll be there.

1123
01:27:01,160 --> 01:27:03,116
Did Hadley find Tyler?
- Not yet.

1124
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:07,308
That Templeton is a mean woman.
- Lay off her, Kelly.

1125
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:10,709
Congratulate me, boy.
I've saved the day!

1126
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:13,634
My lawyers
have come up with a document

1127
01:27:14,040 --> 01:27:16,793
that will hold up in any court.
- Great! What is it?

1128
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:20,078
A full confession.
Sign it.

1129
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:22,755
Are you kidding?
I could go to jail for 5 years.

1130
01:27:23,160 --> 01:27:26,835
No, we make a deal with the judge.
Two years. Sign.

1131
01:27:27,240 --> 01:27:29,196
Forget it.
- Two years!

1132
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:34,594
It's like being drafted.
Greetings from the president. Sign.

1133
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:39,509
I couldn't find Tyler anywhere.
The guy has disappeared.

1134
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:41,399
That tears it.

1135
01:27:42,040 --> 01:27:43,155
Hadley.

1136
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:46,874
Step over to the window.

1137
01:27:48,360 --> 01:27:51,909
Mr. Ramsey,
I told you, I am not going to jump!

1138
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:54,959
You don't have to. I'll trip you.

1139
01:27:55,360 --> 01:27:57,749
Your wife'll be loaded,
kids'll go to college.

1140
01:27:58,160 --> 01:28:00,594
Right? Come on, boy, run!

1141
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:05,512
Knock it off. - You won't sign,
you won't jump. What traitors!

1142
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:07,039
Dr. Tyler's here.

1143
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:10,276
Doctor, where've you been?

1144
01:28:10,680 --> 01:28:14,150
In the subway.
Couldn't change a thousand dollar bill.

1145
01:28:15,320 --> 01:28:17,356
Gentlemen, I give you Vip!

1146
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,639
That is Vip?
- They look like mints.

1147
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:22,314
Don't they though?

1148
01:28:22,720 --> 01:28:27,157
$100,000 for advertising,
and what does he give us? Candy!

1149
01:28:27,560 --> 01:28:31,109
I don't care if they're matzah balls.
I've got something for the ad council.

1150
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:34,269
Hadley, let's have wrappers made.

1151
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:36,951
Nobel Prize Winner, huh?

1152
01:28:37,360 --> 01:28:39,510
I could have hired Fanny Farmer.

1153
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:42,115
At ten cents a piece,
you'll make millions.

1154
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:44,351
Ten cents for one of these?

1155
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:48,193
Try it.
- I've tasted candy before.

1156
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:50,909
Not like these. Try it.

1157
01:28:56,360 --> 01:28:57,839
Have the rest of it.

1158
01:29:04,720 --> 01:29:08,713
I think you'd better sit down,
there should be a reaction.

1159
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:12,114
I made it emphatic
to Webster he be here at 11.

1160
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,594
Hadley! Hold that elevator!

1161
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:20,796
Vippooooo!

1162
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:25,715
I think I'll try a red one.
- I think you've had enough.

1163
01:29:26,200 --> 01:29:29,272
Don't worry,
I can hold my candy.

1164
01:29:29,680 --> 01:29:31,238
Know something?

1165
01:29:31,640 --> 01:29:33,198
I'll tell you,

1166
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:37,119
you've come up with a great mint.
- Mint?

1167
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:39,511
Mint, you say?

1168
01:29:41,640 --> 01:29:45,553
This priceless pastille
you carelessly refer to as a mint,

1169
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:49,077
is in reality
a triumph of advanced biochemistry.

1170
01:29:49,480 --> 01:29:53,109
Looks like candy.
Tastes like candy.

1171
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:56,878
But it enters
the blood stream as pure alcohol.

1172
01:29:57,320 --> 01:30:01,393
Each one is the equivalent
of a triple martini.

1173
01:30:02,440 --> 01:30:04,908
Here's to you, Doc. Bottoms up!

1174
01:30:05,320 --> 01:30:08,551
I've given this country
what it has long needed:

1175
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:11,349
A good ten cent drunk.

1176
01:30:12,280 --> 01:30:15,352
I told you he wouldn't show up.

1177
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:17,398
The D.A. Should take over.

1178
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:20,553
It seems in order
to issue a warrant for his arrest.

1179
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:22,951
And if he resists, gun him down!

1180
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:25,828
Good morning.
I'm sorry to be late,

1181
01:30:26,840 --> 01:30:28,637
but I stopped to pick up Vip.

1182
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:31,508
You mean there is such a product?

1183
01:30:32,120 --> 01:30:34,350
Would I advertise it if there weren't?

1184
01:30:34,760 --> 01:30:37,069
That would be dishonest.

1185
01:30:38,160 --> 01:30:43,393
Gentlemem, I give you Vip.
A confection for the entire family.

1186
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:53,396
This is nothing but a mint!
- I never said it was anything more.

1187
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:55,834
Hmm, it's quite tasty.

1188
01:30:56,840 --> 01:30:59,400
Really?
- May I have another one?

1189
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:01,950
Sure, Mr. Williams, help yourself.

1190
01:31:06,840 --> 01:31:08,273
Help yourselves.

1191
01:31:08,680 --> 01:31:10,671
Unusually refreshing.

1192
01:31:13,240 --> 01:31:16,073
Try a green one.
- How many colors are there? - 6.

1193
01:31:16,480 --> 01:31:19,552
Let's all have one of each.

1194
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:32,152
Dr. Melnick?
- What happened?

1195
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:36,030
He just suddenly went wild.
- He kicked this picture of his dad.

1196
01:31:36,440 --> 01:31:39,830
He tried to tear my clothes off!
- Mine too!

1197
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:43,150
Where is he?
- Joe, take it down.

1198
01:31:49,960 --> 01:31:51,552
What are you doing, Peter?

1199
01:31:51,960 --> 01:31:54,349
I'm king of the elevator!

1200
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:37,910
V Day is Here

1201
01:32:48,040 --> 01:32:49,109
Marriage Certificate

1202
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:51,078
Married?

1203
01:32:51,480 --> 01:32:52,469
Me?

1204
01:32:56,360 --> 01:32:57,349
Car...

1205
01:33:12,160 --> 01:33:13,593
Miss Templeton?

1206
01:33:14,440 --> 01:33:16,670
Miss Templeton, wake up.

1207
01:33:20,040 --> 01:33:21,155
Milly.

1208
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:25,439
I had the most wonderful dream.

1209
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:30,837
Dr. Tyler and I...

1210
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:36,070
I know what you're thinking,
but just calm down.

1211
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:39,836
We're in a motel in Maryland,
but it's all right.

1212
01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:43,710
We're legally married.
You're Mrs. Jerry Webster.

1213
01:33:44,720 --> 01:33:46,995
Now stop that!
You're my wife!

1214
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:50,039
Some girls
just aren't ready for marriage.

1215
01:33:50,640 --> 01:33:51,755
Here.

1216
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:57,474
Look. I don't know how it happened,
but I did the decent thing.

1217
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:02,836
Oh, I'm your wife!

1218
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:05,751
This is horrible!

1219
01:34:06,160 --> 01:34:07,798
I'm ruined!

1220
01:34:08,360 --> 01:34:10,635
You're not ruined!
I married you.

1221
01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:13,235
You'll go to jail for this.
- Carol...

1222
01:34:13,640 --> 01:34:15,631
Don't you touch me!

1223
01:34:16,720 --> 01:34:17,994
Will you listen to reason?

1224
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:20,311
You give me back my clothes!

1225
01:34:20,720 --> 01:34:24,918
Poor lad! It's not likely
to be a long honeymoon.

1226
01:34:25,320 --> 01:34:29,871
I know you hate me, but you must
love me too. You married me.

1227
01:34:30,280 --> 01:34:33,636
You got me drunk!
- Maybe I did.

1228
01:34:34,040 --> 01:34:37,669
I know it's a shock
to wake up and find yourself married,

1229
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:40,833
but this is the first time
it's happened to me too.

1230
01:34:41,240 --> 01:34:45,199
And you know something?
Cold sober, even with a hangover,

1231
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:46,999
I kinda like it.

1232
01:34:47,400 --> 01:34:49,072
Mrs. Jerry Webster.

1233
01:34:49,720 --> 01:34:52,598
Don't you ever call me that again.

1234
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,798
Plenty of girls
would like to be Mrs. Jerry Webster.

1235
01:34:56,200 --> 01:35:01,228
I'm sure they have a right.
- Okay, so I've sown a few wild oats.

1236
01:35:01,640 --> 01:35:05,679
A few?
You can qualify for a farm loan!

1237
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:09,556
Honey, you're starting
off our marriage with a fight.

1238
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:13,919
Oh no, I'm not.
I'm starting it with an annulment!

1239
01:35:15,080 --> 01:35:18,038
Carol, don't be so hasty.
Let's talk this over.

1240
01:35:18,440 --> 01:35:20,954
You listen. No alcoholic beverage,

1241
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:26,992
no drug, no torture could induce me
to stay married to you!

1242
01:35:27,400 --> 01:35:29,436
Let's discuss this!

1243
01:35:35,640 --> 01:35:37,596
Where can I get this annulled?

1244
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:41,072
Darling,
it's only natural to be frightened.

1245
01:35:41,480 --> 01:35:45,473
Like olives, dear,
you acquire a taste for it.

1246
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:51,990
Get me New York City,
Plaza 89970. I'll hold.

1247
01:35:59,680 --> 01:36:02,240
Hello, Pete? This is Jerry.

1248
01:36:02,640 --> 01:36:04,756
I'm in Maryland,
but I don't know how.

1249
01:36:05,400 --> 01:36:07,391
I'll tell you.

1250
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:12,430
You ate some of those poison pellets
your Frankenstein friend

1251
01:36:12,840 --> 01:36:14,956
Tyler came up with.

1252
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:19,239
Candy nothing! That stuff
turns into pure alcohol.

1253
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:24,075
That explains it.
What about the ad council?

1254
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:26,835
They found Northcross

1255
01:36:27,240 --> 01:36:31,028
barricaded in the ladies' lounge
at Radio City Music Hall.

1256
01:36:32,440 --> 01:36:35,989
Williams was on stage,
dancing with the Rockettes.

1257
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:40,439
And Magnussen just washed up
on the beach at Waikiki.

1258
01:36:40,840 --> 01:36:42,319
Yeah, he's alive.

1259
01:36:44,760 --> 01:36:46,751
Can't find the District Attorney.

1260
01:36:49,640 --> 01:36:51,631
Is he gray haired with a moustache?

1261
01:36:55,640 --> 01:36:58,996
He was best man at my wedding.

1262
01:37:00,720 --> 01:37:04,315
Relax, Pete.
I'm gonna sign the confession.

1263
01:37:04,720 --> 01:37:08,872
I'm taking the rap for everything.
- You're not taking the rap alone.

1264
01:37:09,280 --> 01:37:11,396
I'll see that Hadley signs too.

1265
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:14,360
That won't be necessary.
- Excuse me.

1266
01:37:14,760 --> 01:37:17,149
There are two men here to see you.

1267
01:37:17,560 --> 01:37:20,199
It's the FBI!
Send them in here.

1268
01:37:20,600 --> 01:37:23,512
I don't want you to think
I'm abandoning you.

1269
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:28,436
The same lawyers who drew up
this document will break it.

1270
01:37:28,840 --> 01:37:32,071
I'll get you a fair trial
if I have to buy out the jury.

1271
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:33,549
Thanks.

1272
01:37:34,440 --> 01:37:35,714
Mr. Ramsey?

1273
01:37:36,120 --> 01:37:39,715
I'm Ramsey. But Jerry Webster
is responsible for Vip.

1274
01:37:40,120 --> 01:37:42,031
He invented it. He dreamed it up.

1275
01:37:42,440 --> 01:37:44,795
Is that true?
- Yes.

1276
01:37:45,200 --> 01:37:48,476
It's all right here. - Don't say
a word till I get the lawyers.

1277
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:51,952
We don't need
lawyers here, Mr. Webster.

1278
01:37:52,960 --> 01:37:54,951
Now, what is your price?

1279
01:37:55,800 --> 01:37:58,189
Price?
- We represent the liquor industry.

1280
01:37:58,600 --> 01:38:01,239
How much did it take
to burn that formula?

1281
01:38:01,960 --> 01:38:03,393
Well, I, uh...

1282
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:09,396
You don't seem to realize
what you're asking me to do.

1283
01:38:09,800 --> 01:38:11,950
The government'll stop you anyway.

1284
01:38:12,360 --> 01:38:16,239
With that candy, we lose money.
Now, name your price.

1285
01:38:17,880 --> 01:38:19,677
Let's see.

1286
01:38:20,080 --> 01:38:26,076
The liquor industry spends 60 million
a year in advertising. - Right.

1287
01:38:26,480 --> 01:38:29,233
And we're prepared
to give you 20% of our billing.

1288
01:38:29,920 --> 01:38:32,718
You can open
your own agency with that.

1289
01:38:33,120 --> 01:38:35,315
25%.
- Agreed.

1290
01:38:35,720 --> 01:38:39,030
You're not going to give the account
to me. Give it to Mrs...

1291
01:38:39,440 --> 01:38:41,078
That is...

1292
01:38:41,480 --> 01:38:44,711
Miss Carol Templeton,
of Bracket, McGalpin & Gaines.

1293
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:48,150
If that's what you want.
- It is.

1294
01:38:49,320 --> 01:38:50,719
Shall we?

1295
01:38:57,680 --> 01:39:01,832
Our attorneys will draw up
an agreement. - Fine.

1296
01:39:02,240 --> 01:39:03,275
No.

1297
01:39:04,360 --> 01:39:08,433
Send it to San Francisco.
I'm moving to our West Coast office.

1298
01:39:08,840 --> 01:39:11,434
Very well.
Thank you, Mr. Webster.

1299
01:39:11,840 --> 01:39:13,398
Thank you.

1300
01:39:17,320 --> 01:39:21,393
Are you taking Mr. Webster?
- No, he's going to San Francisco.

1301
01:39:21,800 --> 01:39:23,199
San Francisco?

1302
01:39:24,600 --> 01:39:26,113
Alcatraz!

1303
01:39:29,440 --> 01:39:34,230
This one. This one I don't need.
Take all of these.

1304
01:39:36,160 --> 01:39:38,799
Oh, Pete. I'll be leaving tonight.

1305
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:44,793
We'll miss you, boy.
- I'm taking Kelly with me.

1306
01:39:46,680 --> 01:39:48,398
If anybody can do it, you can.

1307
01:39:55,040 --> 01:39:57,349
Hello, Mr. Webster.

1308
01:39:57,760 --> 01:40:00,479
This is Milly,
Miss Templeton's secretary.

1309
01:40:01,480 --> 01:40:05,598
You know how you married that girl
9 months ago and she annulled it?

1310
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:09,276
Well, it seems there was
something she couldn't annul.

1311
01:40:09,680 --> 01:40:14,674
I think every man has a right to know
when he's about to become a father.

1312
01:40:24,480 --> 01:40:28,189
Got the marriage license.
The judge'll waive the 3-day wait.

1313
01:40:28,600 --> 01:40:30,989
I can marry you immediately.

1314
01:40:32,160 --> 01:40:35,755
The ring! I haven't got it!
- Here, you can use mine.

1315
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:38,829
Yours?

1316
01:40:39,240 --> 01:40:43,597
I've been carrying it for years.
I believe in being prepared.

1317
01:40:45,280 --> 01:40:48,511
Carol, please listen to me.
- I will not marry you.

1318
01:40:48,920 --> 01:40:52,196
Now go away, I'm busy.
- Darling, I love you.

1319
01:40:52,600 --> 01:40:55,910
You don't. You went to California
and forgot me.

1320
01:40:56,320 --> 01:41:00,836
Forgot you? I sent you hundreds
of letters, 1 every day for 8 months.

1321
01:41:01,240 --> 01:41:04,516
And the ninth month, when I
needed you most, not a word!

1322
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:08,879
I didn't know it was happening.
You sent back every letter, unopened.

1323
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:13,114
If you loved me, you'd have
kept writing. - I do love you.

1324
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:15,431
Please marry me!

1325
01:41:17,560 --> 01:41:20,996
I'll think about it. I don't want
to rush into anything.

1326
01:41:21,400 --> 01:41:25,234
You listen to me! You're
going to have my baby, my son...

1327
01:41:25,640 --> 01:41:30,270
It's my baby and I'll have
what I want: I decided on a girl.

1328
01:41:30,680 --> 01:41:34,753
Whatever makes you happy.
I love you both. Will you marry me?

1329
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,912
I always wanted a church wedding.

1330
01:41:40,920 --> 01:41:42,751
The next baby.

1331
01:41:43,160 --> 01:41:45,833
Please say yes!

1332
01:41:47,320 --> 01:41:49,470
Oh... Yes!

1333
01:41:49,880 --> 01:41:52,519
Judge?
- Join hands please.

1334
01:41:52,920 --> 01:41:56,071
We're gathered here
to unite this man and this woman...

1335
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:00,231
...I trust it will
symbolize your union.

1336
01:42:00,640 --> 01:42:04,155
By the powers vested
in me by the state of New York,

1337
01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:07,472
I now pronounce you
man and wife.

1338
01:42:09,400 --> 01:42:12,949
Man!
That's what I call cutting it close!
