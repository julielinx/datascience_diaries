1
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,013
You're traveling
through another dimension-

2
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:16,516
a dimension not only of sight
and sound, but of mind.

3
00:00:16,551 --> 00:00:18,518
A journey into a wondrous land

4
00:00:18,553 --> 00:00:21,421
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

5
00:00:21,456 --> 00:00:22,922
That's the signpost up ahead.

6
00:00:22,957 --> 00:00:25,425
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

7
00:00:49,984 --> 00:00:53,453
I told you that santa claus
should be back by 6:00.

8
00:00:53,488 --> 00:00:55,455
Come on,
mom, let's go.

9
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:16,476
Hey, you told me
to tell you when it was 6:30.

10
00:01:16,511 --> 00:01:17,977
It's 6:30.

11
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:23,683
That's right.

12
00:01:23,718 --> 00:01:26,186
It's exactly 6:30.

13
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:27,687
So...

14
00:01:27,722 --> 00:01:28,688
so what happens now?

15
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:30,190
You turn into a reindeer?

16
00:01:30,225 --> 00:01:33,693
Would that i could.

17
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:36,196
I'll have
another one.

18
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:40,200
You owe me for six
drinks and a sandwich.

19
00:01:40,235 --> 00:01:41,201
That's $3.80.

20
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:21,641
Why do you suppose there
isn't really a santa claus?

21
00:02:21,676 --> 00:02:23,643
How's that?

22
00:02:23,678 --> 00:02:29,149
Why isn't there a real santa
claus... for kids like that?

23
00:02:29,184 --> 00:02:31,651
What am i supposed to be-
some kind of philosopher?

24
00:02:31,686 --> 00:02:33,653
You know
what your trouble is?

25
00:02:33,688 --> 00:02:36,156
You let that dopey
red suit go to your head.

26
00:02:36,191 --> 00:02:38,158
Are you some kind of a nut?

27
00:02:38,193 --> 00:02:39,659
Here's your change.

28
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:44,664
I'll flip you-
double or nothing.

29
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:46,266
What do you think this is,
monte carlo?

30
00:02:46,301 --> 00:02:47,267
Finish and get out.

31
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:52,572
I've had enough...
to eat.

32
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:00,079
Hello, jack's place.

33
00:03:00,114 --> 00:03:01,581
No, jack's not here.

34
00:03:01,616 --> 00:03:02,582
This is bruce.

35
00:03:02,617 --> 00:03:03,583
Wait a minute.

36
00:03:03,618 --> 00:03:06,085
Santa claus, i catch
you trying that

37
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:06,686
one more time

38
00:03:06,721 --> 00:03:09,189
i'm going to break
both your arms

39
00:03:09,224 --> 00:03:10,690
up to the
shoulder blades.

40
00:03:10,725 --> 00:03:12,692
Now, go on,
get out of here.

41
00:03:12,727 --> 00:03:13,693
What's that?

42
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:17,197
No, it's just santa claus
trying to heist the joint.

43
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:24,604
Thanks a lot, bruce.

44
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:10,149
Please, santa

45
00:04:10,184 --> 00:04:12,652
i want a carriage
and a dolly...

46
00:04:12,687 --> 00:04:14,654
please,
i want a gun...

47
00:04:14,689 --> 00:04:16,155
and a playhouse...

48
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,657
and a set
of soldiers

49
00:04:17,692 --> 00:04:18,658
and a fort...

50
00:04:18,693 --> 00:04:21,160
and oh, please,
santa claus

51
00:04:21,195 --> 00:04:22,662
a job
for my daddy.

52
00:04:22,697 --> 00:04:24,163
Please,
a big turkey

53
00:04:24,198 --> 00:04:26,165
for our christmas dinner.

54
00:04:27,702 --> 00:04:30,670
This is mr. Henry corwin,
normally unemployed

55
00:04:30,705 --> 00:04:33,172
who once a year takes
the lead role

56
00:04:33,207 --> 00:04:35,675
in the uniquely popular
american institution

57
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:38,177
that of
a department store santa claus

58
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:42,181
in a road company version of
the night before christmas

59
00:04:42,216 --> 00:04:46,185
but in just a moment, mr. Henry
corwin, ersatz santa claus

60
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,688
will enter a strange kind
of north pole

61
00:04:48,723 --> 00:04:51,691
which is one part
the wondrous spirit of christmas

62
00:04:51,726 --> 00:04:54,694
and one part the magic
that can only be found

63
00:04:54,729 --> 00:04:56,195
in the twilight zone.

64
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:29,529
You should see me
with erector sets.

65
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:34,534
Corwin, you're an hour late!

66
00:05:34,569 --> 00:05:35,535
I am?

67
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:37,036
Now, you get up
on your throne

68
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:40,039
and see if you can keep from
disillusioning a lot of kids

69
00:05:40,074 --> 00:05:42,041
that not only isn't
there a santa claus

70
00:05:42,076 --> 00:05:44,544
but the one in this store
happens to be a wino

71
00:05:44,579 --> 00:05:47,547
who'd be more at home playing
rudolph the red-nosed reindeer.

72
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:50,049
Now, get with it,
santa claus!

73
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:05,064
You go ahead.

74
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:06,566
You climb up
on his lap.

75
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:08,568
Go ahead, he
won't hurt you

76
00:06:08,603 --> 00:06:09,569
will you,
santa claus?

77
00:06:09,604 --> 00:06:11,571
You won't hurt
my little boy.

78
00:06:11,606 --> 00:06:12,572
Go on, tell him!

79
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:15,074
What's
your name?

80
00:06:15,109 --> 00:06:17,076
Percival smithers.

81
00:06:17,111 --> 00:06:20,079
And what do you want
for christmas, percival?

82
00:06:20,114 --> 00:06:22,081
A new front name.

83
00:06:22,116 --> 00:06:22,982
Percy!

84
00:06:23,017 --> 00:06:24,984
I think
we have...

85
00:06:28,523 --> 00:06:29,489
look, mom!

86
00:06:29,524 --> 00:06:31,491
Santa claus
is loaded.

87
00:06:31,526 --> 00:06:32,992
You've got
some nerve!

88
00:06:33,027 --> 00:06:34,994
You ought
to be ashamed.

89
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:37,497
Madam...
i am ashamed.

90
00:06:37,532 --> 00:06:38,498
Come on,
percival.

91
00:06:38,533 --> 00:06:39,999
I hope this
won't be

92
00:06:40,034 --> 00:06:42,001
a traumatic
experience for you.

93
00:06:42,036 --> 00:06:43,002
Sot!

94
00:06:43,037 --> 00:06:44,504
Is there some
trouble here?

95
00:06:44,539 --> 00:06:46,506
Yes, there's
some trouble.

96
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:49,008
I shall never trade
in this store again.

97
00:06:49,043 --> 00:06:51,010
It seems you hire
your santa clauses

98
00:06:51,045 --> 00:06:52,011
out of a gutter.

99
00:06:52,046 --> 00:06:54,013
All right,
back to work.

100
00:06:54,048 --> 00:06:56,015
Back to your
positions, please.

101
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:02,021
And now, mr. Kris kringle
of the lower depths

102
00:07:02,056 --> 00:07:04,023
since it is only a few hours
to closing time

103
00:07:04,058 --> 00:07:06,526
it is my distinct
pleasure to tell you

104
00:07:06,561 --> 00:07:09,529
that there is no more
need for your services.

105
00:07:09,564 --> 00:07:10,530
You have had it!

106
00:07:10,565 --> 00:07:12,031
Now, get out here!

107
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:14,534
I'd be very glad to.

108
00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:17,036
And get that crummy
red suit back

109
00:07:17,071 --> 00:07:18,538
to wherever you
rented it from

110
00:07:18,573 --> 00:07:21,541
before you really tie
one on and destroy it.

111
00:07:21,576 --> 00:07:23,042
You drunk!

112
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:31,551
Thank you very much,
mr. Dundee.

113
00:07:31,586 --> 00:07:35,054
As to my drinking,
this is indefensible

114
00:07:35,089 --> 00:07:39,058
and you have
my abject apologies.

115
00:07:39,093 --> 00:07:43,563
I find of late that i
have very little choice

116
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:48,067
in the matter of
expressing emotions.

117
00:07:48,102 --> 00:07:53,072
I can either drink
or i can weep

118
00:07:53,107 --> 00:07:55,575
and drinking is
so much more subtle.

119
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:57,076
Will you please leave?

120
00:07:57,111 --> 00:07:58,578
As for my
insubordination

121
00:07:58,613 --> 00:07:59,579
i was not rude

122
00:07:59,614 --> 00:08:02,582
to that woman.

123
00:08:02,617 --> 00:08:05,284
Someone should remind her
that christmas

124
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:07,787
is more than barging up
and down department store aisles

125
00:08:07,822 --> 00:08:10,289
and pushing people
out of the way.

126
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:11,290
Now, corwin...

127
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:13,292
someone has
to tell her

128
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:17,296
that christmas is another thing,
finer than that...

129
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:22,301
richer, finer, truer

130
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:31,811
and it should come with patience
and love, charity, compassion.

131
00:08:31,846 --> 00:08:34,313
That's what
i would have told her

132
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:36,315
if you'd given me the chance.

133
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,817
Well, how
philosophical

134
00:08:37,852 --> 00:08:38,417
mr. Corwin.

135
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:40,920
Now, perhaps
as your parting word

136
00:08:40,955 --> 00:08:42,922
you can tell us
how we can go about

137
00:08:42,957 --> 00:08:45,925
living up to these
wondrous yule standards

138
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,426
which you have
so graciously

139
00:08:47,461 --> 00:08:48,928
laid down for us.

140
00:08:48,963 --> 00:08:49,929
I don't know

141
00:08:49,964 --> 00:08:53,132
how to tell you, mr. Dundee.

142
00:08:53,167 --> 00:08:55,635
I don't know at all.

143
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,136
All i know is

144
00:08:57,171 --> 00:09:00,640
that i'm an aging,
purposeless relic

145
00:09:00,675 --> 00:09:02,141
of another time

146
00:09:02,176 --> 00:09:05,645
and i live in a
dirty rooming house

147
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,646
on a street

148
00:09:06,681 --> 00:09:09,148
filled with hungry
kids and shabby people

149
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:10,650
where the only thing

150
00:09:10,685 --> 00:09:12,652
that comes
down the chimney

151
00:09:12,687 --> 00:09:13,653
on christmas eve

152
00:09:13,688 --> 00:09:14,954
is more poverty.

153
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:17,456
Will you keep your voice down?

154
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:19,358
Do you know
another reason

155
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:21,360
why i drink,
mr. Dundee?

156
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:24,764
So that when i walk
down the tenements

157
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:27,767
i can really think
it's the north pole

158
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:32,772
and the children are elves
and that i'm really santa claus

159
00:09:32,807 --> 00:09:35,274
bringing them
a bag of wondrous gifts

160
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:38,277
for all of them.

161
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:43,282
I just wish, mr. Dundee,
on one christmas-

162
00:09:43,317 --> 00:09:44,884
only one...

163
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:49,689
that i could see
some of the hopeless ones...

164
00:09:49,724 --> 00:09:51,691
and the dreamless ones...

165
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:56,295
just on one christmas

166
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,297
i'd like to see the meek

167
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:00,800
inherit the earth.

168
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:06,505
And that's why i drink,
mr. Dundee...

169
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:11,010
and that's why i weep.

170
00:11:09,603 --> 00:11:10,569
George, you want
another drink?

171
00:11:10,604 --> 00:11:12,071
Hey, look.
It's santa claus!

172
00:11:12,106 --> 00:11:13,072
Look, there's
santa claus.

173
00:11:13,107 --> 00:11:14,073
Come on in.

174
00:11:14,108 --> 00:11:15,574
Nah, nah.
Go on, get lost.

175
00:11:15,609 --> 00:11:16,575
Get out of here.

176
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,077
Merry christmas.

177
00:11:18,112 --> 00:11:19,078
Santa's a lush.

178
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:04,583
Hey, everybody!

179
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:06,585
Hey, kids!

180
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,587
Merry christmas, everybody!

181
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:11,590
Hey, kids! Everybody!

182
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,592
Merry christmas!

183
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:16,595
Merry christmas, everybody!

184
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,597
Merry christmas!

185
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:29,008
? joy to the world?

186
00:13:29,043 --> 00:13:32,511
? the lord is come?

187
00:13:32,546 --> 00:13:39,018
? let earth receive her king?

188
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:45,024
? let every heart
prepare him room?

189
00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:49,028
? and heaven and nature sing?

190
00:13:49,063 --> 00:13:52,031
? and heaven and nature sing?

191
00:13:52,066 --> 00:13:55,034
? and heaven...?

192
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:57,036
What is going on here?

193
00:13:57,071 --> 00:14:00,539
What's the idea of coming
in here and disrupting

194
00:14:00,574 --> 00:14:02,441
the christmas
eve service?

195
00:14:02,476 --> 00:14:04,944
Sister florence, i
ain't touched a drop

196
00:14:04,979 --> 00:14:07,446
since last thursday and
that's the gospel truth.

197
00:14:09,984 --> 00:14:11,450
And i swear to you

198
00:14:11,485 --> 00:14:13,652
on account of i've seen
it with my own eyes-

199
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:16,655
santa claus is coming down
the street heading this way

200
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,158
and bringing everybody
his heart's desire.

201
00:14:19,193 --> 00:14:22,161
There's a real,
honest-to-goodness santa...

202
00:14:22,196 --> 00:14:24,163
merry christmas,
gentlemen.

203
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:26,165
Now, what'll be
your pleasure

204
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,666
for christmas,
gentlemen?

205
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:29,668
How about you, burt?

206
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:31,170
I fancy a new pipe.

207
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:33,172
Let's see what
i can do for you.

208
00:14:33,207 --> 00:14:34,173
Here's your
new pipe.

209
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:35,174
How about you?

210
00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:36,675
I want a sweater.

211
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,177
A sweater-
what size?

212
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:40,179
Who cares
what size?

213
00:14:40,214 --> 00:14:41,180
Oh, thank you.

214
00:14:41,215 --> 00:14:43,182
Could i have
a smoking jacket?

215
00:14:43,217 --> 00:14:44,683
A smoking jacket
to go with the pipe.

216
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:46,185
I'll see
what i can get.

217
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,686
There's your
smoking jacket.

218
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:50,189
Where did you get
all these gifts?

219
00:14:50,224 --> 00:14:51,190
Sister florence

220
00:14:51,225 --> 00:14:52,391
don't ask me to explain.

221
00:14:52,426 --> 00:14:54,894
I'm just as much in the dark
as anybody else.

222
00:14:54,929 --> 00:14:57,897
All i know is i've got
a santa claus bag here

223
00:14:57,932 --> 00:14:58,898
that gives everybody

224
00:14:58,933 --> 00:15:00,900
exactly what they
want for christmas

225
00:15:00,935 --> 00:15:02,902
and as long
as it's putting out

226
00:15:02,937 --> 00:15:03,402
i'm putting in.

227
00:15:04,939 --> 00:15:07,406
Sister florence,
how about a new dress?

228
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,410
Give that to
sister florence

229
00:15:11,445 --> 00:15:12,912
when she
comes back.

230
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:23,722
Thank you.

231
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:25,724
A bottle of wine.

232
00:15:32,266 --> 00:15:34,733
Merry christmas, officer,
merry christmas.

233
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:35,734
What's your name?

234
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:37,736
Henry corwin...
or is it?

235
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:41,240
Maybe it's santa claus or
kris kringle- i don't know.

236
00:15:42,276 --> 00:15:43,742
You're drunk, corwin.
Is that it?

237
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:45,244
Of course
i'm drunk.

238
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,746
I'm intoxicated
with the spirit of the yule.

239
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:49,748
Drunk with the spirit
of the yule.

240
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:53,252
Intoxicated with the magic and
wonder that is christmas eve.

241
00:15:53,287 --> 00:15:55,254
I'm inebriated
with joy and delight.

242
00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:56,755
Yes, officer, i'm drunk.

243
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,457
We'll settle this
in a hurry.

244
00:15:58,492 --> 00:16:00,960
Have you got a receipt
for this stuff?

245
00:16:00,995 --> 00:16:02,161
Receipt?

246
00:16:02,196 --> 00:16:04,163
Of course you've
got a receipt.

247
00:16:04,198 --> 00:16:06,165
No.

248
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,166
Sister florence

249
00:16:07,201 --> 00:16:09,168
would you please collect
all the stolen goods

250
00:16:09,203 --> 00:16:10,669
and put them
in a pile over there?

251
00:16:10,704 --> 00:16:11,670
I'll send for them

252
00:16:11,705 --> 00:16:13,672
when i check on
who owns them.

253
00:16:13,707 --> 00:16:14,673
Come on, santa.

254
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:16,675
Be right with you,
officer.

255
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:18,677
Don't worry about
a thing, gentlemen.

256
00:16:18,712 --> 00:16:21,180
There's more
where this came from.

257
00:16:21,215 --> 00:16:24,183
Officer, let me tell you
how this whole thing started.

258
00:16:24,218 --> 00:16:26,986
I was having a glass
down at jack's place.

259
00:16:27,021 --> 00:16:28,988
It was just about 4:30 in the
afternoon when i got there.

260
00:16:29,023 --> 00:16:30,990
Like i said,
officer

261
00:16:31,025 --> 00:16:33,492
i arrived at jack's
place about 4:30-

262
00:16:33,527 --> 00:16:35,995
between 4:30 and 5:00,
the cocktail hour.

263
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:38,497
Jack wasn't there
but bruce was.

264
00:16:38,532 --> 00:16:39,498
I know bruce, yes.

265
00:16:39,533 --> 00:16:41,000
Right here.

266
00:16:41,035 --> 00:16:42,001
After you.

267
00:16:42,036 --> 00:16:43,002
I had a sandwich

268
00:16:43,037 --> 00:16:44,503
that i couldn't
finish

269
00:16:44,538 --> 00:16:46,005
and i got
to talking...

270
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:52,511
uh-huh, here he is and
here we are and there that is.

271
00:16:52,546 --> 00:16:53,712
And here
you are.

272
00:16:53,747 --> 00:16:56,715
How nice to see you
again, mr. Dundee.

273
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,017
And how nice it will be

274
00:16:58,052 --> 00:17:01,020
to see my wistful saint nicholas
going up the river.

275
00:17:01,055 --> 00:17:03,522
Do you suppose he can get
as much ten years?

276
00:17:03,557 --> 00:17:04,523
Ten years?

277
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:06,025
Well, it don't
look good, corwin.

278
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,926
Of course, they could
lop off a few months

279
00:17:07,961 --> 00:17:09,928
if you was to tell them
where the rest of the loot was.

280
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:12,431
He's been giving out the stuff
for two and half hours.

281
00:17:12,466 --> 00:17:13,932
He must have
a warehouse full of it.

282
00:17:13,967 --> 00:17:15,634
I'm glad you
brought that up.

283
00:17:15,669 --> 00:17:16,635
There seems
to be

284
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:18,637
a slight
discrepancy here.

285
00:17:18,672 --> 00:17:20,139
Listen, you moth-eaten
robin hood

286
00:17:20,174 --> 00:17:23,642
the wholesale theft of thousands
of dollars worth of goods

287
00:17:23,677 --> 00:17:25,144
is not a
slight discrepancy.

288
00:17:25,179 --> 00:17:26,145
Though i can tell you
right now, corwin

289
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:29,648
this whole affair comes
as no surprise to me.

290
00:17:29,683 --> 00:17:32,651
I'd perceived that criminal
glint in your eyes

291
00:17:32,686 --> 00:17:35,154
the first minute
i'd laid eyes on you.

292
00:17:37,191 --> 00:17:38,157
It seems to me

293
00:17:38,192 --> 00:17:39,658
that you've
put your finger

294
00:17:39,693 --> 00:17:41,660
on the problem,
mr. Dundee.

295
00:17:41,695 --> 00:17:42,661
This bag
doesn't know

296
00:17:42,696 --> 00:17:45,164
whether to give out
gifts or garbage.

297
00:17:45,199 --> 00:17:47,566
It was giving out gifts
when i seen it.

298
00:17:47,601 --> 00:17:50,069
Whatever they was wanting
corwin was supplying.

299
00:17:50,104 --> 00:17:52,571
All kinds of stuff-
toys, gifts, expensive stuff.

300
00:17:52,606 --> 00:17:54,073
Admit it, corwin.

301
00:17:54,108 --> 00:17:55,574
Oh, i admit it, i admit it.

302
00:17:55,609 --> 00:17:57,576
But it seems to me
the essence of our problem is

303
00:17:57,611 --> 00:18:00,579
that we're dealing
with a most unusual bag.

304
00:18:00,614 --> 00:18:04,183
My advice to you is to clean up
this mess and get out here.

305
00:18:04,218 --> 00:18:08,287
Officer flaherty, you
call yourself a policeman.

306
00:18:08,322 --> 00:18:11,290
Well, i suppose it
is a demanding task-

307
00:18:11,325 --> 00:18:14,293
to distinguish between
a bag full of garbage

308
00:18:14,328 --> 00:18:17,796
and an inventory of
expensive stolen gifts.

309
00:18:17,831 --> 00:18:19,298
Mr. Dundee, believe me.

310
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:20,799
It's like corwin says:

311
00:18:20,834 --> 00:18:24,303
We're dealing with
the supernatural here.

312
00:18:24,338 --> 00:18:25,304
In other words

313
00:18:25,339 --> 00:18:27,806
all we have to do
is to ask mr. Corwin

314
00:18:27,841 --> 00:18:30,309
to make a little
abracadabra for us

315
00:18:30,344 --> 00:18:32,311
and no sooner
said, done.

316
00:18:32,346 --> 00:18:33,812
Well, go ahead,
corwin.

317
00:18:33,847 --> 00:18:36,315
I fancy a bottle
of cherry brandy

318
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,316
vintage 1903.

319
00:18:37,351 --> 00:18:40,719
Oh, that's a good year.

320
00:18:40,754 --> 00:18:43,222
And as for you,
officer flaherty

321
00:18:43,257 --> 00:18:45,224
how dare you
drag me down here

322
00:18:45,259 --> 00:18:47,226
at the busiest time
of the year

323
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:49,728
to look at a bag
full of garbage?

324
00:18:49,763 --> 00:18:50,729
Mr. Dundee...

325
00:18:50,764 --> 00:18:52,731
pardon me,
gentlemen.

326
00:18:52,766 --> 00:18:55,234
Merry christmas
to both of you!

327
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:06,245
"To mr. Dundee,
from santa."

328
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,247
Here, mr, dundee.

329
00:19:08,282 --> 00:19:10,249
You need one.

330
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:16,355
Here's beautiful
yellow sweater for you.

331
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:17,356
I want a toy.

332
00:19:17,391 --> 00:19:19,858
I've got a beautiful
toy for you.

333
00:19:19,893 --> 00:19:21,860
I want an electric
train engine.

334
00:19:21,895 --> 00:19:23,362
Electric train engine?
Diesel or steam?

335
00:19:23,397 --> 00:19:24,363
I don't care.

336
00:19:24,398 --> 00:19:25,164
There it is.

337
00:19:25,199 --> 00:19:26,165
I want
a dolly.

338
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,666
You want a dolly.

339
00:19:27,701 --> 00:19:29,168
A blonde, brunette...

340
00:19:29,203 --> 00:19:30,669
blonde!

341
00:19:30,704 --> 00:19:31,670
Here she is.

342
00:19:31,705 --> 00:19:33,172
I want a
toy, please.

343
00:19:33,207 --> 00:19:36,175
Oh, i've got one
here for you.

344
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:38,277
Right there, sweetheart.

345
00:19:38,312 --> 00:19:40,779
I've got a
baseball bat for you

346
00:19:40,814 --> 00:19:42,781
and a toy dog for you.

347
00:19:42,816 --> 00:19:44,283
Thanks.

348
00:19:44,318 --> 00:19:45,784
And a baseball mitt.

349
00:19:50,324 --> 00:19:52,291
Merry christmas to all!

350
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:11,310
Nothing for you
this christmas?

351
00:20:11,345 --> 00:20:14,313
I think i've had
the nicest christmas

352
00:20:14,348 --> 00:20:16,815
since the beginning
of time.

353
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:18,016
Nothing for you.

354
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:20,519
Nothing for yourself,
not a thing.

355
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:26,525
You know, i... i can't think
of anything i want.

356
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:31,029
I guess what
i've really wanted is...

357
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:34,032
to be the biggest gift giver
of all times

358
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:36,034
and in a way

359
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:40,739
i think i had that tonight.

360
00:20:40,774 --> 00:20:47,246
Although, if i had my choice
of any gift- any gift at all-

361
00:20:47,281 --> 00:20:51,750
i think i'd wish
i could do this every year.

362
00:20:51,785 --> 00:20:53,051
That'd be
some gift

363
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:54,553
wouldn't it,
burt?

364
00:20:54,588 --> 00:20:56,555
Oh, it sure would.

365
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,557
God bless
you, burt

366
00:20:58,592 --> 00:21:00,158
and merry christmas
to you.

367
00:21:00,193 --> 00:21:02,160
Merry christmas
to you, too, santa

368
00:21:02,195 --> 00:21:05,664
and thanks for the smoking
jacket and the pipe.

369
00:21:05,699 --> 00:21:06,665
Don't mention it.

370
00:22:05,959 --> 00:22:07,926
We've been waiting
quite a while

371
00:22:07,961 --> 00:22:09,928
for you, santa claus.

372
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:13,932
Oh, no.

373
00:22:13,967 --> 00:22:15,934
Did you hear
what i said?

374
00:22:15,969 --> 00:22:18,937
I said we've been
waiting quite a while

375
00:22:18,972 --> 00:22:20,439
for you, santa claus.

376
00:22:28,482 --> 00:22:30,949
We've got a year of
hard work ahead of us

377
00:22:30,984 --> 00:22:33,452
to get ready
for next christmas.

378
00:22:33,487 --> 00:22:34,453
Come on.

379
00:22:34,488 --> 00:22:36,955
Are you ready?

380
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:38,957
Oh, yeah.

381
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:52,671
Going home,
officer flaherty?

382
00:22:52,706 --> 00:22:55,173
Going home, mr.
Dundee, and you?

383
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:57,175
Going home,
officer flaherty.

384
00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:00,178
This is the most
remarkable christmas eve

385
00:23:00,213 --> 00:23:01,179
i've ever had.

386
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:14,693
Flaherty...

387
00:23:14,728 --> 00:23:17,195
i could have
sworn that i...

388
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:18,196
did you see it?

389
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:19,698
I thought i did.

390
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:20,699
What did you see?

391
00:23:20,734 --> 00:23:22,701
I don't think
i ought to tell you.

392
00:23:22,736 --> 00:23:25,203
You might report me
for drinking on duty.

393
00:23:25,238 --> 00:23:27,205
Go ahead,
what did you see?

394
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,707
It was corwin,
mr. Dundee

395
00:23:28,742 --> 00:23:31,209
big as life in a
sleigh with reindeer

396
00:23:31,244 --> 00:23:32,711
sitting next to an elf

397
00:23:33,211 --> 00:23:34,713
and riding up
toward the sky.

398
00:23:34,748 --> 00:23:36,715
That's about
the size of it

399
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,216
ain't it,
mr. Dundee?

400
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:44,723
Flaherty, you better
come home with me

401
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:47,726
and we'll pour out
some hot coffee

402
00:23:47,761 --> 00:23:50,729
and we'll pour
some brandy in it

403
00:23:50,764 --> 00:23:52,731
and we'll...

404
00:23:54,232 --> 00:23:58,737
and we'll thank god
for miracles, flaherty.

405
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:05,243
A word to the wise, to all
the children of the 20th century

406
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:08,246
whether their concern be
pediatrics or geriatrics

407
00:24:08,281 --> 00:24:11,249
whether they crawl on hands
and knees and wear diapers

408
00:24:11,284 --> 00:24:13,752
or walk with a cane
and comb their beards.

409
00:24:13,787 --> 00:24:15,754
There's a wondrous magic
to christmas

410
00:24:16,254 --> 00:24:19,257
and there's a special power
reserved for little people.

411
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:22,377
In short, there's
nothing mightier than the meek.

You know, it's only a short hop
fromthe twilight zone

415
00:24:57,998 --> 00:24:59,965
to dodge city andgunsmoke.

416

Saturday nights,
over most of these stations.
