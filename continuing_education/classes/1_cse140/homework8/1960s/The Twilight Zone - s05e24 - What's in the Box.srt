1
00:00:06,556 --> 00:00:09,693
You unlock this door
with the key of imagination.

2
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:12,062
Beyond it is another dimension-

3
00:00:12,097 --> 00:00:13,313
a dimension of sound,

4
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:16,449
a dimension of sight,

5
00:00:16,484 --> 00:00:18,318
a dimension of mind.

6
00:00:18,353 --> 00:00:21,454
You're moving into a land
of both shadow and substance,

7
00:00:21,489 --> 00:00:23,323
of things and ideas.

8
00:00:23,358 --> 00:00:27,711
You've just crossed over
into the twilight zone.

9
00:00:35,253 --> 00:00:40,840
Mother, i'm having a baby,
and i'd rather do it myself.

10
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:42,092
We'll have to operate at once.

11
00:00:42,127 --> 00:00:44,594
Scalpel... suture...

12
00:00:44,629 --> 00:00:45,845
watch it, nurse!

13
00:00:50,233 --> 00:00:52,102
Great dinner.

14
00:00:52,137 --> 00:00:53,987
Glad you like it.

15
00:00:54,022 --> 00:00:55,855
Tastes like
corrugated plastic.

16
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,107
Keep being late.

17
00:00:57,142 --> 00:00:58,358
What do you expect?

18
00:00:58,393 --> 00:00:59,609
I don't expect nothing.

19
00:00:59,644 --> 00:01:00,860
I'm just getting sick
of it.

20
00:01:00,895 --> 00:01:02,112
You're getting
sick of it?

21
00:01:02,147 --> 00:01:03,363
How do you
think i feel?

22
00:01:03,398 --> 00:01:05,248
I don't get a
man coming home.

23
00:01:05,283 --> 00:01:07,117
I get a used article
from the cab.

24
00:01:07,152 --> 00:01:09,002
Hey, cut it down
to a roar, will you?

25
00:01:09,037 --> 00:01:10,253
Remember, we got company.

26
00:01:10,288 --> 00:01:12,122
Anyway, i told you-

27
00:01:12,157 --> 00:01:14,007
guy hails me when
i'm heading for the garage.

28
00:01:14,624 --> 00:01:15,258
Have to haul him

29
00:01:15,293 --> 00:01:18,378
all the way up to...
to... to yonkers.

30
00:01:18,413 --> 00:01:20,263
I've heard that
one before.

31
00:01:20,298 --> 00:01:20,880
One day yonkers,

32
00:01:20,915 --> 00:01:22,766
one day la
guardia airport.

33
00:01:22,801 --> 00:01:24,634
You don't fool me, joe.

34
00:01:24,669 --> 00:01:25,885
Who's the chick?

35
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,771
Ah, you're crazy.

36
00:01:29,639 --> 00:01:30,890
Mother...

37
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:32,142
hey, how long
is that guy going to be?

38
00:01:32,776 --> 00:01:34,644
I got wrestling
coming on.

39
00:01:34,679 --> 00:01:36,529
Big tag team match-

40
00:01:36,564 --> 00:01:38,398
fat louie
and the russian duke

41
00:01:38,433 --> 00:01:40,900
versus the panther man
and sweeney.

42
00:01:40,935 --> 00:01:42,402
You can't look me
in the eye anymore,

43
00:01:42,437 --> 00:01:43,653
you're so guilty.

44
00:01:43,688 --> 00:01:46,156
But don't jump
out a window, joe.

45
00:01:46,191 --> 00:01:47,157
One of these days,

46
00:01:47,192 --> 00:01:48,408
i'll even up
the score.

47
00:01:48,443 --> 00:01:50,293
It'll be a real
tight ball game.

48
00:01:50,328 --> 00:01:53,413
That good-looking
freddy broome, the butcher,

49
00:01:53,448 --> 00:01:55,298
is always looking me over.

50
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:57,300
You'd think i
was cleopatra.

51
00:01:57,335 --> 00:01:58,551
Ah, shut up.

52
00:01:58,586 --> 00:02:01,054
What are you trying to do,
start a fight?

53
00:02:01,089 --> 00:02:04,174
Once that joker in there
gets done fiddling,

54
00:02:04,209 --> 00:02:06,059
i'm going to watch
wrestling

55
00:02:06,094 --> 00:02:07,310
and then flake out.

56
00:02:07,345 --> 00:02:08,561
I'm pooped.

57
00:02:08,596 --> 00:02:09,813
I'll bet you are.

58
00:02:09,848 --> 00:02:12,932
You drove to yonkers,
maybe even went twice.

59
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:14,567
You shouldn't
drive so much, joe.

60
00:02:14,602 --> 00:02:16,436
You'll ruin
your health!

61
00:02:18,321 --> 00:02:19,572
How's it coming, mike?

62
00:02:19,607 --> 00:02:20,824
Who knows?

63
00:02:20,859 --> 00:02:22,075
It may live.

64
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,577
You've been at it
an hour now.

65
00:02:24,612 --> 00:02:27,080
I could build a new set
in half the time.

66
00:02:27,115 --> 00:02:29,833
Oh? Is that so?

67
00:02:29,868 --> 00:02:31,701
Sure, and you better get wise.

68
00:02:31,736 --> 00:02:34,838
I didn't just step
off the ferry from jersey.

69
00:02:34,873 --> 00:02:37,340
I know how you guys operate.

70
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:37,957
Do you?

71
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:39,209
Naturally.

72
00:02:39,244 --> 00:02:41,711
First you kill
a five-buck hour,

73
00:02:41,746 --> 00:02:43,596
then you say
you got to take the set

74
00:02:43,631 --> 00:02:46,099
down to the shop-
another 20 bucks.

75
00:02:46,134 --> 00:02:49,853
Then you start switching tubes
around at $2.50 a crack.

76
00:02:49,888 --> 00:02:52,355
I get some poor sucker's
old ones, and he gets mine.

77
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:54,224
It's a racket-
that's what it is.

78
00:02:54,259 --> 00:02:56,109
A penny-ante cosa nostra.

79
00:02:56,144 --> 00:02:58,611
So save yourself
a headache, see.

80
00:02:58,646 --> 00:03:01,114
I ain't swinging
for no big bills.

81
00:03:01,149 --> 00:03:03,233
In that case...

82
00:03:03,268 --> 00:03:05,118
the set's ready.

83
00:03:05,153 --> 00:03:06,369
What?

84
00:03:06,404 --> 00:03:08,872
It's... it's ready.

85
00:03:08,907 --> 00:03:11,991
And this time,
it's on me.

86
00:03:12,026 --> 00:03:13,243
Free.

87
00:03:13,278 --> 00:03:15,128
Hey, wait
a minute!

88
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:20,750
Well... you can't win them all.

89
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:37,517
Your wife, your wife!

90
00:03:37,552 --> 00:03:39,269
That's all
i ever hear!

91
00:03:39,304 --> 00:03:40,520
Hey, phyllis, come on in.

92
00:03:40,555 --> 00:03:41,771
What do you know?

93
00:03:41,806 --> 00:03:43,022
We can get channel 10.

94
00:03:43,057 --> 00:03:44,908
If you were any
kind of a man,

95
00:03:44,943 --> 00:03:46,159
you'd get
rid of her.

96
00:03:46,194 --> 00:03:48,661
Phyllis, hurry up, will you?
Channel 10!

97
00:03:48,696 --> 00:03:49,779
I trusted you.

98
00:03:49,814 --> 00:03:51,664
I didn't hold
anything back!

99
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:52,916
I waited!

100
00:03:57,956 --> 00:03:59,923
Aw, come on, don't cry.

101
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:03,042
Do anything, but
don't cry, will you?

102
00:04:06,714 --> 00:04:08,548
Portrait of a tv fan.

103
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:10,433
Joe britt.

104
00:04:10,468 --> 00:04:12,552
Cab driver.

105
00:04:12,587 --> 00:04:16,306
Tonight mr. Britt is going
to watch "a really big show"-

106
00:04:16,341 --> 00:04:19,442
something special for the cabby
who's seen everything.

107
00:04:19,477 --> 00:04:21,311
Joe britt doesn't know it,

108
00:04:21,346 --> 00:04:23,813
but his flag is down
and his meter's running,

109
00:04:23,848 --> 00:04:27,567
and he's in high gear-
on his way to the twilight zone.

110
00:04:46,636 --> 00:04:48,638
Marry me.

111
00:04:48,673 --> 00:04:49,889
Marry you?

112
00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:51,391
Oh, now, look, baby,

113
00:04:51,426 --> 00:04:54,510
we're talking about
two different things.

114
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:57,647
Love is flowers and
wine with the dinner.

115
00:04:57,682 --> 00:04:59,515
Marriage is a floor mop

116
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,401
and two pounds
of hamburger.

117
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:03,770
Oh, well,
i don't mind hamburger.

118
00:05:03,805 --> 00:05:05,655
Uh, with onions.

119
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:12,528
What's the matter, joe?

120
00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:15,665
You struck dumb
or something?

121
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,785
You big slob!
You spilled the beer.

122
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,287
It's a good thing
your mother gave us this rug.

123
00:05:21,322 --> 00:05:24,791
I hate it, and anything,
even beer stains,

124
00:05:24,826 --> 00:05:26,676
is an improvement.

125
00:05:26,711 --> 00:05:28,544
Now quit clowning.

126
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:31,047
You say we can get
channel 10?

127
00:05:31,082 --> 00:05:32,298
Leave it alone.

128
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:32,932
What's the matter?

129
00:05:32,967 --> 00:05:34,801
Oh, come on, joe,
i got dishes to do.

130
00:05:34,836 --> 00:05:36,686
I said leave it alone!

131
00:05:36,721 --> 00:05:39,188
What's the matter with you?
You nuts or something?

132
00:05:39,223 --> 00:05:41,441
You yell at me
to come watch channel 10,

133
00:05:41,476 --> 00:05:43,309
and when
i drop everything, you...

134
00:05:43,344 --> 00:05:45,812
what's the matter, joe?
Is the set still on the blink?

135
00:05:45,847 --> 00:05:47,697
Yes! That is, no!

136
00:05:47,732 --> 00:05:49,565
There must be
something screwy.

137
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,702
You know there's no channel 10
around here.

138
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:55,822
I'm sorry i yelled at you.

139
00:05:55,857 --> 00:05:59,575
I must be traffic happy
or something.

140
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:03,963
I'll turn on the wrestling.

141
00:06:05,214 --> 00:06:07,717
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

142
00:06:07,752 --> 00:06:12,722
for the main event of the
evening, we bring you a rematch

143
00:06:12,757 --> 00:06:15,842
between those two titans
of wrestling-

144
00:06:15,877 --> 00:06:18,344
those fearless performers
of the physical arts-

145
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:22,732
the wild panther
and the russian duke!

146
00:06:25,887 --> 00:06:29,856
What happened to the tag team-
fat louie and sweeney?

147
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:06,776
Great dinner.

148
00:07:06,811 --> 00:07:08,644
Glad you like it.

149
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:10,530
Tastes like
corrugated plastic.

150
00:07:10,565 --> 00:07:11,781
Keep being late.

151
00:07:11,816 --> 00:07:13,032
What do you expect?

152
00:07:13,067 --> 00:07:14,283
I don't expect nothing.

153
00:07:14,318 --> 00:07:15,535
I'm just getting sick
of it.

154
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:16,786
You're getting
sick of it?

155
00:07:16,821 --> 00:07:18,037
How do you
think i feel?

156
00:07:18,072 --> 00:07:19,906
I don't get a
man coming home.

157
00:07:19,941 --> 00:07:21,791
I get a used article
from the cab.

158
00:07:21,826 --> 00:07:23,543
Hey, cut it down
to a roar, will you?

159
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,411
Remember,
we got company.

160
00:07:25,446 --> 00:07:26,913
Anyway, i told you-

161
00:07:26,948 --> 00:07:29,415
guy hails me when
i'm heading for the garage.

162
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:30,049
Have to haul him

163
00:07:30,084 --> 00:07:32,552
all the way up
to... to... to yonkers.

164
00:07:32,587 --> 00:07:34,420
I've heard that
one before.

165
00:07:34,455 --> 00:07:37,423
One day yonkers, one
day la guardia airport.

166
00:07:40,676 --> 00:07:42,562
Joe?

167
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:47,567
Joe!

168
00:07:47,602 --> 00:07:48,818
Joe, wake up.

169
00:07:48,853 --> 00:07:51,320
What's the matter?

170
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:56,943
Are you okay now?

171
00:07:56,978 --> 00:07:58,194
What?

172
00:07:58,229 --> 00:07:59,445
What happened?

173
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,696
Well, i don't know.

174
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:03,199
You probably fainted.

175
00:08:03,234 --> 00:08:04,450
Feel better?

176
00:08:04,485 --> 00:08:06,953
Yeah.

177
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:08,838
Sure.

178
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,843
Must have been
something i ate.

179
00:08:13,878 --> 00:08:15,711
Yeah, it could be.

180
00:08:15,746 --> 00:08:19,465
Didn't it taste like
corrugated plastic?

181
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,350
Well, what did
you expect?

182
00:08:21,385 --> 00:08:23,853
I had to heat
it three times.

183
00:08:32,146 --> 00:08:33,980
Listen, joe,
maybe it's your heart.

184
00:08:34,015 --> 00:08:35,231
Why don't you go to bed,

185
00:08:35,266 --> 00:08:36,482
and i'll call a doctor?

186
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:40,236
No, there's just
something mighty screwy

187
00:08:40,271 --> 00:08:41,487
with that television.

188
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:43,372
Are we off on that again?

189
00:08:43,407 --> 00:08:45,875
Listen, phyllis...

190
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:49,629
are you sure you never saw
that repair guy before?

191
00:08:49,664 --> 00:08:51,881
Now iamgoing to call a doctor.

192
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:54,500
Now, now, wait a
minute, wait a minute.

193
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:57,386
Phyllis...

194
00:08:57,421 --> 00:09:01,757
what would you say
if i told you that...

195
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:04,260
that i saw myself on tv?

196
00:09:04,295 --> 00:09:06,395
Huh! Were you smiling?

197
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:12,401
And what would you say
if i told you i saw you on tv?

198
00:09:12,768 --> 00:09:14,020
You're cracked.

199
00:09:14,055 --> 00:09:15,905
You're losing your marbles.

200
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:18,908
That's what i
figured you'd say.

201
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:22,662
Okay, forget it.

202
00:09:22,697 --> 00:09:24,280
You're a
stupid cow.

203
00:09:24,315 --> 00:09:25,531
A bird brain!

204
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:27,166
Or else you're up to something.

205
00:09:27,201 --> 00:09:27,783
Joe, baby...

206
00:09:27,818 --> 00:09:29,669
"joe, baby."

207
00:09:29,704 --> 00:09:31,537
Never mind that
"joe, baby" stuff.

208
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:32,788
I'm on to you.

209
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:34,040
You're trying
to trap me!

210
00:09:34,075 --> 00:09:35,925
Well, you'll have to
get up mighty early

211
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,176
in the morning, see?

212
00:09:37,211 --> 00:09:39,045
Youaresick.

213
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,296
Now, listen...

214
00:09:40,331 --> 00:09:41,547
you go back
into the kitchen,

215
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:43,432
look up that repair guy
in the phone book.

216
00:09:43,467 --> 00:09:45,935
Tell him to come back here,
you understand?!

217
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:47,186
All right, joe.

218
00:09:47,221 --> 00:09:49,055
Because if he don't,
so help me,

219
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:50,940
i'll go down to his shop,
wherever it is,

220
00:09:50,975 --> 00:09:52,191
and drag him here!

221
00:09:52,226 --> 00:09:54,060
Who do you two think
you're fooling with?

222
00:09:54,443 --> 00:09:56,946
Okay, okay, i'll
call him right away!

223
00:09:56,981 --> 00:09:58,814
Meanwhile, you
get in bed.

224
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:14,463
Hello, dr. Saltman,
this is mrs. Britt.

225
00:10:14,498 --> 00:10:17,583
Could you come
right over, please?

226
00:10:31,347 --> 00:10:32,598
Ha! Ha!

227
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:34,483
I'll kill you!

228
00:10:36,387 --> 00:10:38,854
Now turn on
the tv, joe!

229
00:10:43,859 --> 00:10:45,611
You, you...!

230
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:48,247
Come on! Come on!
Give it up!

231
00:10:48,282 --> 00:10:51,367
You, you... you call
yourself a wife?!

232
00:10:53,904 --> 00:10:55,755
You dirty...!

233
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:13,522
Well, you will, huh?

234
00:11:16,025 --> 00:11:18,527
Going to kill me,
are you?

235
00:11:18,562 --> 00:11:20,396
I'll kill you!

236
00:11:20,431 --> 00:11:21,647
Let me go!

237
00:11:30,406 --> 00:11:32,291
Phyllis...

238
00:11:32,326 --> 00:11:34,160
phyllis!

239
00:11:40,451 --> 00:11:42,301
What have i done?

240
00:11:50,426 --> 00:11:51,677
Phyllis...

241
00:11:52,928 --> 00:11:54,180
phyllis!

242
00:11:55,466 --> 00:11:57,933
Now what's the
matter, joe?

243
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:02,321
Joe, what's the matter?

244
00:12:02,356 --> 00:12:04,190
What's the matter?

245
00:12:04,225 --> 00:12:06,075
Can't you hear?

246
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,943
Can't you see?

247
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:09,195
Look!

248
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:16,335
Oh, god...

249
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:20,706
it's a trick!

250
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:38,891
Well, i've given him a sedative

251
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:40,142
and i'll write
a prescription

252
00:12:40,177 --> 00:12:42,027
for some tranquilizers.

253
00:12:42,062 --> 00:12:45,781
And we'll just have
to wait and see.

254
00:12:45,816 --> 00:12:47,650
Perhaps it would be wise

255
00:12:47,685 --> 00:12:50,786
for you to seek
more expert advice.

256
00:12:50,821 --> 00:12:52,655
I'm only a family doctor,
you know,

257
00:12:53,289 --> 00:12:55,791
and psychiatry
is not my specialty.

258
00:12:55,826 --> 00:13:00,162
However, i feel that
your husband's condition

259
00:13:00,197 --> 00:13:01,413
could be
relatively simple.

260
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:04,550
I read an interesting paper
on research

261
00:13:04,585 --> 00:13:06,418
that might apply
to your husband's condition.

262
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:08,304
What condition,
doctor?

263
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:09,555
Well, according
to this article,

264
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:11,423
it's possible for anyone
to have delusions

265
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:14,560
directly attributable
to our overmechanized culture.

266
00:13:14,595 --> 00:13:15,811
Really?

267
00:13:15,846 --> 00:13:18,931
Mm. Now, you say
he's a tv addict.

268
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:20,182
Well, perhaps
he's been staring

269
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:22,685
at this electronic blessing,
the television set,

270
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,187
for so long that its life
has become his.

271
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:26,438
Yeah?

272
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:28,324
And he's reached
such a stage of confusion

273
00:13:28,359 --> 00:13:29,575
that he no longer knows
whether he's watching

274
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:32,077
the action
or participating in it.

275
00:13:32,112 --> 00:13:33,946
Now, mind you,
this is not an illness

276
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:36,448
affecting only the juvenile
or moronic.

277
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:38,951
I, on occasion,
have found myself asking

278
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:40,836
for sutures and sponges

279
00:13:40,871 --> 00:13:42,705
during operations performed
by television surgeons.

280
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:43,956
Oh?

281
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:45,841
Uh, but never mind.

282
00:13:45,876 --> 00:13:48,961
In mr. Britt's case,
i rather feel

283
00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:51,463
he thinks
he has murdered you.

284
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:52,715
What?

285
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,600
Or rather,
that he will.

286
00:13:54,635 --> 00:13:57,102
He seems to be
quite bewildered

287
00:13:57,137 --> 00:14:00,222
regarding the past,
present and future.

288
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:03,726
Well, in any case,
it could be serious,

289
00:14:03,761 --> 00:14:06,228
so would you have him
in my office

290
00:14:06,263 --> 00:14:07,479
first thing
in the morning, hmm?

291
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:09,365
All right, doctor.

292
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,867
And see that he gets
a good night's rest tonight.

293
00:14:11,902 --> 00:14:13,118
Good night.

294
00:14:13,153 --> 00:14:14,370
Good night, doctor.

295
00:14:30,886 --> 00:14:32,004
Now, you folks out there
in tv land,

296
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:33,889
you know old country boy's
not joshing you

297
00:14:33,924 --> 00:14:35,140
when he tells you
that this sale

298
00:14:35,175 --> 00:14:36,392
ain't gonna be going on
much longer.

299
00:14:36,427 --> 00:14:38,894
'Cause fast as we move 'em in
now, we're gonna herd 'em out.

300
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:42,014
We buy by the herd,
and we sells 'em by the herd.

301
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:44,516
Oh, for you folks uptown,
that's called volume buying.

302
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:47,269
Well, now, shucks,
about all a country boy can do

303
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:48,520
with a buck or two
he makes on a sale

304
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:50,406
is to keep the lights on,
pay the ranch hands.

305
00:14:50,441 --> 00:14:52,908
Now, you know that old country
boy shoots straight with you.

306
00:14:52,943 --> 00:14:54,026
I mean, he tells you right now

307
00:14:54,061 --> 00:14:56,528
if any of his beauties
come up late.

308
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:58,414
Will you take this little philly
right here?

309
00:14:58,449 --> 00:14:59,665
Hot dog, this one...

310
00:15:11,794 --> 00:15:13,679
phyllis.

311
00:15:19,301 --> 00:15:20,552
The doctor wants you
to go to sleep.

312
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:22,438
That's why he gave you
a sedative.

313
00:15:22,473 --> 00:15:24,306
I can't sleep.

314
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:25,557
You wouldn't be
able to, either,

315
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:27,443
if you'd seen
what i did.

316
00:15:27,478 --> 00:15:29,945
Well, stay awake.

317
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,814
Only, what you saw-

318
00:15:31,849 --> 00:15:33,699
i don't want
to hear about it.

319
00:15:33,734 --> 00:15:34,950
He told you?

320
00:15:34,985 --> 00:15:37,453
Yes. He said
not to worry.

321
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:40,572
He said... he said
for you to just go to sleep

322
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:42,458
and everything
would be fine.

323
00:15:42,493 --> 00:15:44,960
Is there anything
i can get you?

324
00:15:44,995 --> 00:15:46,211
No, no, that's okay.

325
00:15:46,246 --> 00:15:47,463
Phyllis...

326
00:15:47,498 --> 00:15:49,331
yes?

327
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:50,582
I got to talk
to you. Sit down.

328
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:52,468
Oh, no, you don't.

329
00:15:52,503 --> 00:15:54,970
Every time you start that,
we wind up having a fight,

330
00:15:55,005 --> 00:15:57,473
and if you don't mind,
tonight i'm passing.

331
00:15:57,508 --> 00:15:59,725
I'll make sure there's no fight.

332
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,593
Don't you worry about that.

333
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:04,730
Anyway, i got nothing
to fight with you about.

334
00:16:04,765 --> 00:16:08,484
If anyone is to blame for us
not getting along, it's me.

335
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:10,352
Now, come on, sit down.

336
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:11,854
Oh, youaresick.

337
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:13,105
You're not well, joe.

338
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,356
If you were in
your right noodle,

339
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:15,607
you wouldn't talk
like that.

340
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:16,859
No, i mean it.
Come on, i mean it.

341
00:16:17,493 --> 00:16:19,361
Come on, sit
down, honey.

342
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:22,498
Look, phyllis...

343
00:16:22,533 --> 00:16:26,869
you know, driving a cab
is pretty lonely work.

344
00:16:26,904 --> 00:16:30,005
You're all by yourself
for hours and hours,

345
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,874
and in between times,

346
00:16:31,909 --> 00:16:33,759
people are
yelling at you

347
00:16:33,794 --> 00:16:36,879
to slow down, go ahead,
to take madison avenue,

348
00:16:37,513 --> 00:16:38,764
to not take
madison avenue,

349
00:16:39,381 --> 00:16:41,266
to turn right,
left, stop.

350
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:42,518
And on top of it,

351
00:16:42,553 --> 00:16:44,386
everybody says
you're crooked.

352
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:48,140
So... when somebody comes along

353
00:16:48,175 --> 00:16:51,276
and smiles at you
and calls you "mister,"

354
00:16:51,311 --> 00:16:55,647
well, maybe you go all to pieces
and start to think

355
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:58,784
the moon and the stars
are your private property

356
00:16:58,819 --> 00:17:00,652
and that it's spring.

357
00:17:01,036 --> 00:17:03,539
Well, you act like
a first-class donkey,

358
00:17:03,574 --> 00:17:04,790
kicking up
your heels

359
00:17:04,825 --> 00:17:07,910
like you were
17 or 18.

360
00:17:07,945 --> 00:17:09,795
Get what i mean?

361
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:11,046
No.

362
00:17:11,081 --> 00:17:13,799
Well...

363
00:17:13,834 --> 00:17:17,553
there ain't no point
in drawing you pictures.

364
00:17:17,588 --> 00:17:22,558
What i was trying to tell you
is that, well, you know-

365
00:17:22,593 --> 00:17:25,677
seeing you dead like that,
it was an awful shock

366
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:29,431
and it made me realize that...

367
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:31,683
well, you know what
i'm trying to say.

368
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:33,569
No. Say it.

369
00:17:33,604 --> 00:17:35,320
Okay, i will.

370
00:17:35,355 --> 00:17:40,325
It took a shock like that
to make me realize that...

371
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,828
that you are not...

372
00:17:42,863 --> 00:17:44,079
well...

373
00:17:44,114 --> 00:17:45,948
it's you i'm in love with.

374
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:48,450
I'm touched.

375
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:50,335
All right.

376
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:52,838
I'm really touched!

377
00:17:52,873 --> 00:17:54,840
All right, don't get nasty.

378
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:57,709
What am i supposed to do,
get all dewy and gooey?

379
00:17:58,343 --> 00:18:00,212
Am i supposed to fall
all over myself

380
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:03,966
because my husband of 27 years
finally decides he loves me?

381
00:18:04,001 --> 00:18:05,217
I didn't mean
it that way.

382
00:18:05,252 --> 00:18:07,102
After chasing
half the bronx

383
00:18:07,137 --> 00:18:08,353
and the entire borough
of manhattan,

384
00:18:08,388 --> 00:18:10,856
you pin the blue ribbon on me,

385
00:18:10,891 --> 00:18:12,724
which means i win
a used nitwit

386
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:14,610
to feed, to pamper,
to keep and obey

387
00:18:14,645 --> 00:18:16,478
till death do part!

388
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:17,729
Take it easy, phyllis.

389
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:18,981
I'll take it easy.

390
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:20,232
I'd take
a butcher knife to you

391
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:23,368
if you weren't in bed
and out of your right mind.

392
00:18:23,403 --> 00:18:24,620
Who's out of his right mind?

393
00:18:24,655 --> 00:18:25,737
You are!

394
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:29,491
If you think i'm going to take
your dirty doings lying down...

395
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:32,628
so some guy hailed you
on the way to the garage

396
00:18:32,663 --> 00:18:34,496
and asked you
to take him to yonkers.

397
00:18:34,531 --> 00:18:37,633
No wonder we've been short
of money for the last month!

398
00:18:37,668 --> 00:18:41,386
You've been blowing it all
on that flea-bitten floozy!

399
00:18:41,421 --> 00:18:43,005
Get out of here!

400
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,140
You bet i will!

401
00:18:45,175 --> 00:18:46,758
If you think i'm going
to live with a man

402
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:49,261
that's done what you've done...

403
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:52,397
giving you
the best years of my life...

404
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:54,266
i trusted you!

405
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:58,020
Well, mr. Britt,
i'm going to take you to court-

406
00:18:58,055 --> 00:19:01,156
you and that fancy woman
of yours,

407
00:19:01,191 --> 00:19:02,407
whoever she is!

408
00:19:02,442 --> 00:19:04,276
Go ahead, if that's
what you want!

409
00:19:04,311 --> 00:19:06,161
That's the
thanks i get

410
00:19:06,196 --> 00:19:07,412
for wanting
to be honest.

411
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:09,281
That's the thanks i get

412
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:11,166
for wanting to turn over
a new leaf.

413
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:18,674
Kill me- i'd like
to see him try it.

414
00:19:18,709 --> 00:19:22,427
I'll tear him limb from limb,
the dirty, rotten cheat.

415
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:28,050
I don't know
what i ever saw in her.

416
00:19:28,085 --> 00:19:30,552
She ain't got no understanding.

417
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:32,437
She wouldn't know sympathy

418
00:19:32,472 --> 00:19:36,191
if it hopped up
and bit her on the backside.

419
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:40,562
Your honor,
the prosecution objects

420
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:43,065
to these interruptions
by the defense.

421
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,950
They've had their chance
to refute

422
00:19:44,985 --> 00:19:47,452
the testimony
of our expert witness,

423
00:19:47,487 --> 00:19:51,206
and all they did was to put
dr. Saltman on the stand.

424
00:19:51,241 --> 00:19:54,326
Now, even he testified
that in his opinion,

425
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:57,462
the accused was sane
when he committed the murder.

426
00:19:57,497 --> 00:20:03,719
So in this summation, when i
demand the penalty of death...

427
00:20:03,754 --> 00:20:04,970
phyllis!

428
00:20:05,005 --> 00:20:07,089
I'll "phyllis" you!

429
00:20:07,124 --> 00:20:08,840
Phyllis!

430
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:13,845
What are you trying
to do, drive me bugs?

431
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,348
How can you stand there
listening to this?

432
00:20:20,137 --> 00:20:23,238
Joseph britt, you
have been found guilty

433
00:20:23,273 --> 00:20:25,107
by a jury of your peers.

434
00:20:25,142 --> 00:20:26,992
It is the judgment
of this court

435
00:20:27,609 --> 00:20:30,746
that you be taken to the
sing sing state prison

436
00:20:30,781 --> 00:20:32,614
and there be
kept in custody

437
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:34,499
and put to death

438
00:20:34,534 --> 00:20:37,619
in a manner
provided by the law.

439
00:20:50,265 --> 00:20:52,768
How can you just stand there?

440
00:20:52,803 --> 00:20:54,636
You must be bugs!

441
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:57,139
What you see is
in your mind, joe,

442
00:20:57,174 --> 00:20:59,641
and what you hear
is your conscience.

443
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:02,778
There, take a good look!

444
00:21:02,813 --> 00:21:04,029
Turn it off.

445
00:21:04,064 --> 00:21:06,531
Why? It's just another
program like wrestling.

446
00:21:06,566 --> 00:21:08,400
Let's watch it together.

447
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:10,902
I haven't had a
good laugh all day.

448
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:12,154
Get out of my way,
phyllis!

449
00:21:12,189 --> 00:21:14,039
Ooh, i'm so frightened.

450
00:21:14,074 --> 00:21:15,907
You scare me to death.

451
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:18,410
Oh, my, my, how rough you are.

452
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:21,413
Tell me what
you see, joe.

453
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:49,324
What did you see, joe-
lady wrestlers?

454
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:56,198
What do you see, joe-
a burlesque show?

455
00:21:56,233 --> 00:21:59,201
Fan dancers from yonkers?

456
00:22:03,623 --> 00:22:04,840
Yonkers?

457
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:05,457
Fan dancers?

458
00:22:05,492 --> 00:22:07,959
Did you see
them, joe?

459
00:22:09,246 --> 00:22:11,963
Yonkers, yonkers, yonkers!

460
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:13,215
Fan dancers!

461
00:22:17,853 --> 00:22:19,104
Fan dance!

462
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:26,978
I'll kill you!

463
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:28,363
Ha! Ha!

464
00:22:28,398 --> 00:22:29,614
I'll kill you!

465
00:22:29,649 --> 00:22:31,483
Ha! Ha!

466
00:22:31,518 --> 00:22:33,985
Now turn on
the tv, joe!

467
00:22:39,741 --> 00:22:41,376
Give me...

468
00:22:41,411 --> 00:22:42,627
oh...

469
00:22:42,662 --> 00:22:44,880
you...

470
00:22:44,915 --> 00:22:46,748
come on, come on,
give me that!

471
00:22:46,783 --> 00:22:47,999
You... you...

472
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:49,885
you call yourself a wife?

473
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:54,005
Oh, you dirty...!

474
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:09,154
Get off of me!

475
00:23:11,691 --> 00:23:13,525
Well, you will, huh?

476
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:17,913
Going to kill me,
are you?

477
00:23:17,948 --> 00:23:19,164
I'll kill you.

478
00:23:26,922 --> 00:23:28,790
Phyllis...

479
00:23:28,825 --> 00:23:30,041
phyllis!

480
00:23:36,298 --> 00:23:38,800
What have i done?

481
00:23:41,303 --> 00:23:42,554
Oh...

482
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:50,695
i didn't really mean it.

483
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:53,815
I killed her.
I killed her.

484
00:23:58,203 --> 00:23:59,454
Oh...

485
00:23:59,489 --> 00:24:01,957
fix your set okay, mister?

486
00:24:01,992 --> 00:24:06,328
Youwillrecommend
my service, won't you?

487
00:24:06,363 --> 00:24:08,830
The next time your tv set
is on the blink,

488
00:24:08,865 --> 00:24:11,333
when you're in the need
of a first-rate repairman,

489
00:24:11,368 --> 00:24:13,218
may we suggest
our own specialist?

490
00:24:13,253 --> 00:24:16,338
Factory-trained, prompt,
honest, 24-hour service.

491
00:24:16,373 --> 00:24:18,223
You won't find him
in the phone book,

492
00:24:18,258 --> 00:24:20,725
but his office
is conveniently located-

493
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,228
in the twilight zone.

494
00:24:27,532 --> 00:24:29,985
And now, mr. Serling.

495
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:32,487
Next ontwilight zone,
we move into new orleans

496
00:24:32,522 --> 00:24:35,607
for the mardi gras,
and we do it with a vengeance.

497
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:38,743
Robert keith and milton selzer
appear in a bizarre story

498
00:24:38,778 --> 00:24:40,612
of men, masquerades and masks.

499
00:24:40,647 --> 00:24:43,748
This is a small shocker
to wind up your week,

500
00:24:43,783 --> 00:24:45,617
and if it doesn't send you
to a psychiatrist,

501
00:24:45,652 --> 00:24:47,502
it'll send you
at least to a mirror.

502
00:24:47,537 --> 00:24:51,256
Ontwlight zonenext,
"the masks."
