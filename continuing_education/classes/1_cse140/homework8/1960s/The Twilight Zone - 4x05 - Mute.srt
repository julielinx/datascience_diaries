1
00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:11,361
You unlock this door
with the key of imagination.

2
00:00:11,396 --> 00:00:13,229
Beyond it is another dimension-

3
00:00:13,264 --> 00:00:15,732
a dimension of sound,

4
00:00:15,767 --> 00:00:17,617
a dimension of sight,

5
00:00:17,652 --> 00:00:19,486
a dimension of mind.

6
00:00:19,521 --> 00:00:22,622
You're moving into a land
of both shadow and substance,

7
00:00:22,657 --> 00:00:24,491
of things and ideas.

8
00:00:24,526 --> 00:00:28,878
You've just crossed over
into the twilight zone.

9
00:00:51,401 --> 00:00:53,269
So...

10
00:00:57,023 --> 00:00:58,908
"the undersigned,

11
00:00:58,943 --> 00:01:01,411
"having accepted
the following propositions:

12
00:01:01,446 --> 00:01:04,781
"A, that prior
to the inception of language,

13
00:01:04,816 --> 00:01:07,917
"man communicated
by telepathic means;

14
00:01:07,952 --> 00:01:12,539
"and b, that this ability
not only still exists

15
00:01:12,574 --> 00:01:15,675
"but can be redeveloped
to its former effectiveness;

16
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:19,429
"do hereby agree
to the following precepts.

17
00:01:19,464 --> 00:01:22,298
"One, that we shall
henceforth dedicate

18
00:01:22,932 --> 00:01:24,801
"our professional
and private lives

19
00:01:24,836 --> 00:01:26,686
"to the study of
mental telepathy

20
00:01:26,721 --> 00:01:28,555
"and whatever
extrasensory functions

21
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:29,806
"may be supplemental
to it.

22
00:01:29,841 --> 00:01:33,560
"Two, that the findings
of the study shall be applied

23
00:01:33,595 --> 00:01:36,696
"not only to ourselves,
but to all our children.

24
00:01:36,731 --> 00:01:38,565
"Three, that
each family unit

25
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,450
"shall reside
in a location

26
00:01:40,485 --> 00:01:41,701
"calculated
to prevent

27
00:01:41,736 --> 00:01:43,570
"the interference
of society.

28
00:01:43,605 --> 00:01:45,455
"Four, that monthly
correspondence

29
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:46,706
"shall be exchanged

30
00:01:46,741 --> 00:01:48,575
"until such time as
they will establish

31
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:50,460
"a joint colony

32
00:01:50,495 --> 00:01:53,079
"in which communication
of every sort

33
00:01:53,114 --> 00:01:56,216
shall be exclusively mental."

34
00:01:56,251 --> 00:01:59,335
There are sure to be
other details, of course,

35
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:05,592
but for now, this should suffice
to get us started.

36
00:02:05,627 --> 00:02:06,226
Comments?

37
00:02:07,343 --> 00:02:09,846
More than sufficient,
i think.

38
00:02:09,881 --> 00:02:11,981
Most specific.

39
00:02:12,849 --> 00:02:14,100
Karl?

40
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:18,988
It is what
we agreed upon.

41
00:02:19,023 --> 00:02:22,108
That sounds very much
like disapproval.

42
00:02:23,359 --> 00:02:25,862
No, no, no.
Not at all.

43
00:02:25,897 --> 00:02:28,364
I will be pleased
to sign.

44
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:29,616
You are certain now?

45
00:02:29,651 --> 00:02:32,118
This should not
be entered into

46
00:02:32,153 --> 00:02:34,003
unless with
absolute assurance.

47
00:02:34,038 --> 00:02:35,872
He is assured, holger.

48
00:02:35,907 --> 00:02:39,008
His apparent
uncertainty
is only...

49
00:02:39,043 --> 00:02:41,511
a sympathetic
reflection
of my own.

50
00:02:42,128 --> 00:02:42,879
You are still uncertain?

51
00:02:42,914 --> 00:02:46,015
Not in the general concept,
holger.

52
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:49,135
I agree with it, believe in it.

53
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,020
It is yet that i wonder,

54
00:02:51,055 --> 00:02:56,643
do we have the right to impose
this study on our children,

55
00:02:56,678 --> 00:02:58,528
even those unborn?

56
00:02:58,563 --> 00:03:01,781
You speak as if we plan
to harm our children.

57
00:03:01,816 --> 00:03:04,284
Isn't it rather that we hope

58
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,403
to bestow upon them
a gift beyond price?

59
00:03:07,438 --> 00:03:10,540
Of course that is
our hope, but...

60
00:03:10,575 --> 00:03:14,294
we offer them no choice
in the matter.

61
00:03:14,329 --> 00:03:15,545
Is that just?

62
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,914
I too am a mother, maria,

63
00:03:17,949 --> 00:03:20,416
devoted to the welfare
of my child,

64
00:03:20,451 --> 00:03:24,170
yet i am convinced it is just.

65
00:03:24,205 --> 00:03:26,172
It is more than just.

66
00:03:26,207 --> 00:03:28,675
It's inevitable.

67
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:31,177
Destiny demands it.

68
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:34,564
Did you and
holger decide

69
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:37,066
definitely not to
stay in europe?

70
00:03:37,101 --> 00:03:38,318
Yes.

71
00:03:38,353 --> 00:03:39,569
There's a house
in pennsylvania

72
00:03:39,604 --> 00:03:41,437
which was left to
holger by an uncle.

73
00:03:41,472 --> 00:03:43,323
We plan to
live in it.

74
00:03:43,358 --> 00:03:45,191
Oh, excellent.

75
00:03:45,226 --> 00:03:46,442
What town is this?

76
00:03:46,477 --> 00:03:48,328
German corners.

77
00:03:48,363 --> 00:03:50,830
What you're witnessing
is the curtain-raiser

78
00:03:50,865 --> 00:03:52,699
to a most extraordinary play:

79
00:03:52,734 --> 00:03:56,452
To wit the signing of a pact,
the commencement of a project.

80
00:03:56,487 --> 00:03:57,704
The play itself
will be performed

81
00:03:57,739 --> 00:04:00,206
almost entirely offstage.

82
00:04:00,241 --> 00:04:02,709
The final scenes
are to be enacted a decade hence

83
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:04,594
and with a different cast.

84
00:04:04,629 --> 00:04:07,714
The main character
of these final scenes is ilse,

85
00:04:07,749 --> 00:04:11,467
the daughter of professor
and mrs. Nielsen, age two.

86
00:04:11,502 --> 00:04:13,353
At the moment,
she lies sleeping in her crib,

87
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:17,106
unaware of the singular drama
in which she is to be involved.

88
00:04:17,141 --> 00:04:19,609
Ten years from this moment,
ilse nielsen is to know

89
00:04:19,644 --> 00:04:22,729
the desolating terror
of living simultaneously

90
00:04:22,764 --> 00:04:27,116
in the world
and in the twilight zone.

91
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,236
Yeah?

92
00:05:03,271 --> 00:05:04,487
Sheriff wheeler?
Yeah.

93
00:05:04,522 --> 00:05:06,356
This is tom poulter.

94
00:05:06,391 --> 00:05:07,607
The nielsen house is burning.

95
00:05:07,642 --> 00:05:08,858
What?

96
00:05:08,893 --> 00:05:10,109
There's a fire
at the nielsen house.

97
00:05:10,144 --> 00:05:11,361
Big fire- hurry.

98
00:05:11,396 --> 00:05:13,112
Right.

99
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:14,364
What is it?

100
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:16,115
Fire at the nielsen house.

101
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,367
Did it just start?

102
00:05:17,402 --> 00:05:18,618
I hope so. If it didn't...

103
00:05:18,653 --> 00:05:20,503
max, it's harry.

104
00:05:20,538 --> 00:05:22,372
There's a fire
at the nielsen house.

105
00:05:22,407 --> 00:05:23,122
Call the volunteers.

106
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:24,374
Get the truck out.

107
00:05:24,409 --> 00:05:25,625
I'll be there
in 10 or 15 minutes.

108
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,759
Got it?

109
00:05:27,377 --> 00:05:28,628
I told them
when they first came here

110
00:05:28,663 --> 00:05:29,879
they shouldn't live
so far out of town,

111
00:05:29,914 --> 00:05:32,382
but they wanted
their privacy.

112
00:05:32,417 --> 00:05:33,633
That girl...

113
00:05:33,668 --> 00:05:35,518
that lovely girl...

114
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:50,783
we'll never put that out.

115
00:05:50,818 --> 00:05:52,785
Never mind the house.
Keep the woods from catching.

116
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,037
Come on, let's check out back.

117
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:05,548
They're done for.

118
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:07,417
Poor kid.

119
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:11,170
Harry, over here, quick!

120
00:06:15,058 --> 00:06:16,309
Do you think she's...

121
00:06:17,427 --> 00:06:19,312
is she burned?

122
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:22,682
She's alive.

123
00:06:22,717 --> 00:06:23,933
Are you all right?

124
00:06:23,968 --> 00:06:26,436
She's in shock, harry.

125
00:06:26,471 --> 00:06:27,937
Get a blanket on her.

126
00:06:35,945 --> 00:06:37,196
Bad off.

127
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:40,950
Can't talk, can't cry,
can't do nothing.

128
00:06:42,085 --> 00:06:43,953
She's not burned, though.

129
00:06:43,988 --> 00:06:47,090
How could she get out
without being burned?

130
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:55,214
I don't know.

131
00:07:38,141 --> 00:07:39,892
Is she hurt?

132
00:07:39,927 --> 00:07:41,144
Not physically.

133
00:07:41,179 --> 00:07:43,012
I think she's in shock.

134
00:07:43,047 --> 00:07:44,897
We'd better get her to bed.

135
00:07:44,932 --> 00:07:47,400
We'll have to use sally's...

136
00:07:47,435 --> 00:07:50,520
the other bedroom, cora.

137
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:55,525
All right.

138
00:08:03,032 --> 00:08:04,283
Cora.

139
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:05,535
Oh, i'm sorry.

140
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:34,697
She's beautiful.

141
00:08:34,732 --> 00:08:36,566
She looks just
like sally.

142
00:08:36,601 --> 00:08:39,702
Doesn't she?

143
00:09:21,744 --> 00:09:23,613
You want
something to eat?

144
00:09:23,648 --> 00:09:24,864
No, i haven't got time.

145
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:27,366
Thought i'd take some coffee
to the boys.

146
00:09:28,117 --> 00:09:30,002
Are her parents...?

147
00:09:30,037 --> 00:09:31,254
No way of knowing.

148
00:09:31,289 --> 00:09:33,122
Can't get close
to the house yet.

149
00:09:33,157 --> 00:09:34,373
It's burning too hard.

150
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:36,125
Well, how...?

151
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,262
Tom poulter found her outside.

152
00:09:39,297 --> 00:09:41,130
Outside?

153
00:09:41,165 --> 00:09:42,381
We don't know how she got there.

154
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,884
I expect her parents
are dead, though.

155
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:46,769
It's an awful fire.

156
00:09:46,804 --> 00:09:49,772
Poor child.

157
00:09:49,807 --> 00:09:51,891
There's something wrong
with her.

158
00:09:51,926 --> 00:09:56,279
I know she's not deaf or dumb
or retarded or anything.

159
00:09:56,314 --> 00:09:59,398
Before she fell asleep,
i tried to get her to talk.

160
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:01,901
She didn't say a word.
Not a word.

161
00:10:01,936 --> 00:10:03,786
Even in shock,

162
00:10:03,821 --> 00:10:06,906
the powers of speech
aren't completely gone.

163
00:10:06,941 --> 00:10:11,294
It's as though she doesn't know
how to talk.

164
00:10:16,165 --> 00:10:18,050
Be careful.

165
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:44,944
Mother?

166
00:10:44,979 --> 00:10:46,829
Mother!

167
00:10:46,864 --> 00:10:49,949
Where are you, mother?

168
00:10:49,984 --> 00:10:52,451
Are you near me, father?

169
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:53,703
Mother!

170
00:10:53,738 --> 00:10:56,205
Father!

171
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,708
Where are you?

172
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:18,728
No... no!

173
00:11:18,763 --> 00:11:19,979
They're dead!

174
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:24,367
They're dead!

175
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:36,996
Ilse!

176
00:11:38,748 --> 00:11:42,501
Ilse, what is it?

177
00:11:44,422 --> 00:11:46,756
I'm not going to hurt you, ilse.

178
00:11:50,893 --> 00:11:53,512
What's the matter, darling?

179
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:56,899
They're dead.

180
00:11:56,934 --> 00:11:58,768
They're dead!

181
00:11:58,803 --> 00:12:02,521
They're dead! They're dead!

182
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:13,165
And there's no way of getting
in touch with her relatives?

183
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,417
Everything burned.

184
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:16,919
Tom poulter said
the nielsens get

185
00:12:16,954 --> 00:12:19,422
three letters from europe
the end of each month.

186
00:12:19,457 --> 00:12:21,290
Maybe they're
from relatives.

187
00:12:21,325 --> 00:12:23,793
We can wait till
the next batch arrives

188
00:12:23,828 --> 00:12:25,678
and write
to the three addresses.

189
00:12:25,713 --> 00:12:28,180
What'll we do with
the girl until then?

190
00:12:28,215 --> 00:12:31,300
Well, we'll have
to keep her here.

191
00:12:31,335 --> 00:12:33,803
Only be for a week
or so, cora.

192
00:12:33,838 --> 00:12:36,939
Unless the girl
can tell us something.

193
00:12:36,974 --> 00:12:38,808
Nope.

194
00:12:38,843 --> 00:12:41,944
You don't think
she can talk, either?

195
00:12:41,979 --> 00:12:45,064
I tried everything i
could to get her to.

196
00:12:45,099 --> 00:12:46,949
That explains it.

197
00:12:46,984 --> 00:12:48,818
What?

198
00:12:48,853 --> 00:12:50,319
The times
miss frank and i tried

199
00:12:50,354 --> 00:12:54,707
to talk the nielsens
into putting the girl in school,

200
00:12:54,742 --> 00:12:56,459
the answer
was always no.

201
00:12:56,494 --> 00:12:59,578
Maybe there's something
physically wrong with her.

202
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:03,332
Well, we'll have doc steiger
check her over.

203
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:05,835
I don't think
he'll find anything.

204
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,970
I just can't understand it.

205
00:13:08,005 --> 00:13:09,839
They were educated people.

206
00:13:09,874 --> 00:13:14,226
They didn't even teach
their own daughter how to talk.

207
00:13:14,261 --> 00:13:17,229
They were strange people,
too, cora.

208
00:13:17,264 --> 00:13:19,732
They hardly ever spoke
themselves.

209
00:13:19,767 --> 00:13:21,600
We should put the girl in school

210
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:24,103
while we're waiting
for those letters-

211
00:13:24,138 --> 00:13:27,239
teach her
how to talk, anyway.

212
00:13:27,274 --> 00:13:29,108
Well, not right away.

213
00:13:29,143 --> 00:13:32,495
She has to start sooner
or later, doesn't she?

214
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:35,748
Harry, she just lost
her parents.

215
00:13:35,783 --> 00:13:38,250
I didn't mean tomorrow
or the next day.

216
00:13:40,369 --> 00:13:42,254
You know,
it's a crime,

217
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:44,123
a girl that age
not being educated,

218
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:46,625
not even knowing
how to talk.

219
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,128
Her father
a professor, too-

220
00:13:49,163 --> 00:13:51,630
keeping his own child
in ignorance.

221
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:54,767
Well, something's
got to be done.

222
00:13:54,802 --> 00:13:56,018
Somebody's got to undo

223
00:13:56,053 --> 00:13:57,887
what her parents
did to her.

224
00:14:14,071 --> 00:14:15,287
I'm not surprised-

225
00:14:15,322 --> 00:14:17,790
their decision
to live out of town.

226
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:25,047
Why wouldn't they teach her
how to talk?

227
00:14:28,836 --> 00:14:31,303
And there's no reason
why she can't talk.

228
00:14:31,921 --> 00:14:33,172
I don't understand it.

229
00:14:37,595 --> 00:14:39,929
He says he just can't
understand it.

230
00:14:39,964 --> 00:14:42,431
There's nothing wrong
with her.

231
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:44,316
He... he checked
everything.

232
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:59,698
What is it, ilse?

233
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:02,201
You can tell us,
darling.

234
00:15:02,236 --> 00:15:04,703
Nobody's going
to be angry with you.

235
00:15:07,957 --> 00:15:10,843
Don't be afraid
of us, ilse.

236
00:15:10,878 --> 00:15:12,711
Don't be afraid
of us.

237
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:37,987
Cora, leave her alone!

238
00:15:38,022 --> 00:15:39,872
Well, i can't
just ignore her.

239
00:15:39,907 --> 00:15:41,740
She's been here
over a week now.

240
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:42,992
What's the use?

241
00:15:43,027 --> 00:15:44,243
There's just no way

242
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:46,128
of getting
through to her.

243
00:15:46,163 --> 00:15:47,997
Well, i have
to keep on trying.

244
00:16:05,648 --> 00:16:06,899
Ilse.

245
00:16:15,157 --> 00:16:17,026
Didn't they ever talk to you?

246
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:34,927
I wish i could
make you understand.

247
00:17:08,077 --> 00:17:09,962
She was swimming
in the lake...

248
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:34,853
it's... it's almost
as if you understand.

249
00:17:54,757 --> 00:17:55,374
Bye, hon.

250
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:58,510
Bye-bye.
See you at lunch.

251
00:18:04,767 --> 00:18:06,635
Hello?

252
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:07,269
Yes, he is.

253
00:18:07,304 --> 00:18:09,138
Harry.

254
00:18:12,274 --> 00:18:13,525
Yeah?

255
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,028
Yeah, tom.

256
00:18:16,063 --> 00:18:17,896
All right,
i'll be right over.

257
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:22,401
The letters from
europe are in.

258
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:24,286
I'll see you in
a little while.

259
00:18:33,662 --> 00:18:35,547
Now they'll come and get me...

260
00:18:35,582 --> 00:18:39,301
take me to the other children
who are the way i am.

261
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,431
Did you get them?

262
00:18:52,466 --> 00:18:54,316
What?

263
00:18:54,351 --> 00:18:56,185
The letters.

264
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,687
Tom poulter couldn't
let me have them.

265
00:18:58,722 --> 00:19:00,322
It's against the law.

266
00:19:00,357 --> 00:19:02,191
He's got to send them back.

267
00:19:02,226 --> 00:19:05,944
All he could do was let me copy
off the return addresses.

268
00:19:09,331 --> 00:19:11,834
I'm going to write to them now.

269
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:20,209
It's all right, ilse.

270
00:19:20,843 --> 00:19:22,094
You run along now.

271
00:20:10,893 --> 00:20:13,395
Suppose you have
to write them.

272
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:15,264
What do you mean?

273
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:16,515
Thanks.

274
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,269
Nothing.

275
00:20:30,412 --> 00:20:32,281
Wha... what are you saying
to them?

276
00:20:32,316 --> 00:20:34,783
About the fire,
the nielsens dying,

277
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:36,668
asking them
if they're related to the girl

278
00:20:36,703 --> 00:20:39,171
or know where
any of her relatives are.

279
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:50,432
Well...

280
00:20:52,301 --> 00:20:55,437
what if her relatives
aren't any better for her

281
00:20:55,472 --> 00:20:56,688
than her parents were?

282
00:20:56,723 --> 00:20:58,557
What are you talking about?

283
00:20:58,592 --> 00:21:01,059
It's my duty
to find her relatives.

284
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:04,813
Who they are or what they are
is none of my business.

285
00:21:04,848 --> 00:21:07,950
The welfare of a child
is everybody's business!

286
00:21:07,985 --> 00:21:10,452
We are not in a
position to decide.

287
00:21:10,487 --> 00:21:13,572
We're in a position
just to send her away,

288
00:21:13,607 --> 00:21:14,823
just get rid of her.

289
00:21:14,858 --> 00:21:16,708
Then maybe she
won't ever talk.

290
00:21:16,743 --> 00:21:18,577
Maybe she'll go
through life

291
00:21:18,612 --> 00:21:20,462
just being afraid
of shadows!

292
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:29,838
Cora... i understand.

293
00:21:29,873 --> 00:21:33,842
Sally gone and another child
in the house...

294
00:21:33,877 --> 00:21:36,728
but she's not our child, cora.

295
00:21:36,763 --> 00:21:39,848
We have no rights
where she's concerned.

296
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:43,602
There's something wrong
with her.

297
00:21:43,637 --> 00:21:45,604
Our job is
to make every effort...

298
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:48,106
is that why you want
to get rid of her?

299
00:21:50,777 --> 00:21:53,245
I don't have to answer that,
do i, cora?

300
00:22:14,516 --> 00:22:16,385
Now they'll come and get me.

301
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:42,604
Ilse!

302
00:23:45,474 --> 00:23:46,725
Ilse!

303
00:23:55,402 --> 00:23:57,869
They'll never find me now.

304
00:23:57,904 --> 00:24:00,372
Never! Never!

305
00:24:09,498 --> 00:24:12,000
Oh, please, help me!

306
00:24:12,035 --> 00:24:15,504
I'm here, ilse nielsen!

307
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:17,389
Help me, please!

308
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:28,400
Leave her alone.

309
00:24:30,268 --> 00:24:31,520
Leave her alone.

310
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:35,273
Leave her alone!

311
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:47,085
Twilight zonewill continue
after station identification.

312
00:25:41,089 --> 00:25:43,592
Now, who could
that be?

313
00:25:43,627 --> 00:25:45,477
Probably miss frank.

314
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:52,350
Well, aren't you going
to let her in?

315
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:57,989
Yes, cora,
i asked her to come.

316
00:26:13,622 --> 00:26:15,507
Hello, miss frank.

317
00:26:15,542 --> 00:26:16,758
Mrs. Wheeler.

318
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:22,380
Won't you come in?
Thank you.

319
00:26:24,266 --> 00:26:26,768
Afternoon,
miss frank.

320
00:26:26,803 --> 00:26:28,019
Glad you could come.

321
00:26:28,054 --> 00:26:29,271
I thought it was my duty.

322
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:33,024
Don't put me in school, please.

323
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:34,893
Won't you sit down?

324
00:26:37,395 --> 00:26:39,281
Cora!

325
00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:47,405
As i told you
a few days ago,

326
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,291
i've written
to these people in europe

327
00:26:49,326 --> 00:26:51,159
four or five weeks ago.

328
00:26:51,194 --> 00:26:53,044
We just haven't had
any answer.

329
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:55,914
We don't know
what we're going to do with her.

330
00:26:55,949 --> 00:26:57,165
While we're deciding,

331
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,668
she ought to start getting
an education.

332
00:26:59,703 --> 00:27:01,553
She most certainly
should.

333
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:05,307
It was positively
criminal of her parents

334
00:27:05,342 --> 00:27:08,426
not to have started her
education years ago.

335
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:09,678
The smugness of them.

336
00:27:09,713 --> 00:27:11,563
The insufferable
disdain.

337
00:27:11,598 --> 00:27:15,317
"We do not wish
our daughter to
go to your school."

338
00:27:15,352 --> 00:27:16,568
Just like that.

339
00:27:16,603 --> 00:27:17,819
In many ways,

340
00:27:17,854 --> 00:27:21,573
the fire was a
blessing of her life.

341
00:27:21,608 --> 00:27:23,441
What?

342
00:27:23,476 --> 00:27:24,693
I'm not referring

343
00:27:24,728 --> 00:27:27,829
to her lack
of education,
mrs. Wheeler.

344
00:27:27,864 --> 00:27:32,200
But to call such a hideous thing
a blessing.

345
00:27:32,701 --> 00:27:36,454
I'm sure i didn't mean it
that way, mrs. Wheeler.

346
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,842
The first thing
she must learn

347
00:27:40,877 --> 00:27:42,711
to do, of course,
is talk.

348
00:27:46,464 --> 00:27:47,716
If i may see her now?

349
00:27:47,751 --> 00:27:49,718
I'll get her.

350
00:27:55,357 --> 00:28:00,362
She's a very shy
little girl, miss frank.

351
00:28:00,397 --> 00:28:04,115
She'll... need
understanding.

352
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:07,235
She shall receive
it, mrs. Wheeler.

353
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:20,382
Come here, ilse.

354
00:28:28,139 --> 00:28:29,391
Well,

355
00:28:29,426 --> 00:28:33,144
i think we're going
to get along just fine,

356
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:36,014
you and i.

357
00:28:37,265 --> 00:28:39,768
Don't let her touch me.

358
00:28:39,803 --> 00:28:41,019
Please.

359
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:47,909
No, not her.

360
00:28:47,944 --> 00:28:49,160
No.

361
00:29:14,185 --> 00:29:16,688
It'll be fun, darling.

362
00:29:16,723 --> 00:29:19,190
Don't be afraid.

363
00:29:19,225 --> 00:29:22,310
Come on.

364
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:34,956
Good morning,
mrs. Wheeler.

365
00:29:34,991 --> 00:29:37,459
We were just
about to start.

366
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:44,966
Good morning,
miss frank.

367
00:29:45,001 --> 00:29:49,587
I do hope everything
will be all right.

368
00:29:49,622 --> 00:29:52,724
Ilse's...

369
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:54,592
don't be afraid.

370
00:29:54,627 --> 00:29:57,479
Now, you just leave her here,
mrs. Wheeler.

371
00:29:57,514 --> 00:29:59,981
She'll feel at home in no time.

372
00:30:00,016 --> 00:30:03,234
Well, i was wondering
if i just couldn't stay

373
00:30:03,269 --> 00:30:05,103
for a little while.

374
00:30:05,138 --> 00:30:07,355
As long as you're here,
she'll be upset.

375
00:30:07,989 --> 00:30:11,109
She can't begin to adjust
until she's alone with us.

376
00:30:11,144 --> 00:30:12,994
Believe me, it's the only way.

377
00:30:15,497 --> 00:30:17,999
All right.

378
00:30:19,868 --> 00:30:21,119
Good-bye, dear.

379
00:30:21,154 --> 00:30:24,255
I'll pick you
up after school.

380
00:30:25,507 --> 00:30:26,758
Don't be afraid.

381
00:30:29,878 --> 00:30:32,013
She's going to be fine,
mrs. Wheeler.

382
00:30:32,048 --> 00:30:33,882
We'll take good care of her.

383
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:49,030
Right up front,
now, ilse.

384
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,169
Class...

385
00:31:11,204 --> 00:31:12,804
this is ilse nielsen.

386
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:15,306
We're going
to have to be

387
00:31:15,341 --> 00:31:17,175
very patient with her,

388
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:20,311
because her parents
never taught her

389
00:31:20,346 --> 00:31:21,563
how to speak.

390
00:31:21,598 --> 00:31:25,316
She doesn't understand
one word of english.

391
00:31:25,351 --> 00:31:28,069
But we're going
to help her learn, aren't we?

392
00:31:28,104 --> 00:31:28,686
Yes.

393
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,940
We are going
to work with her

394
00:31:31,975 --> 00:31:35,076
until she's exactly
like everybody else.

395
00:31:35,111 --> 00:31:36,945
Aren't we, class?

396
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:39,447
Yes, miss frank.

397
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:42,584
Now, ilse,

398
00:31:42,619 --> 00:31:45,703
can you say
your name, ilse?

399
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,461
Try to say it.

400
00:31:53,496 --> 00:31:55,346
Your name, child.

401
00:31:55,381 --> 00:31:59,968
Ilse.

402
00:32:00,003 --> 00:32:01,853
Try to say it, child.

403
00:32:01,888 --> 00:32:03,104
Your name.

404
00:32:06,975 --> 00:32:08,860
You'll learn.

405
00:32:13,865 --> 00:32:16,985
"This is a boat.

406
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:22,624
A boat sails
on the ocean."

407
00:32:22,659 --> 00:32:26,377
Ocean.

408
00:32:26,995 --> 00:32:29,631
"The men who live...

409
00:32:29,666 --> 00:32:35,136
"who live...
and work on the boat

410
00:32:35,171 --> 00:32:39,641
are called sailors."

411
00:32:39,676 --> 00:32:44,012
He's trying to tell about the
boat, but the boat isn't words.

412
00:32:44,047 --> 00:32:45,263
It isn't words.

413
00:32:45,298 --> 00:32:48,399
Why don't they learn
the way father taught me?

414
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:31,442
You must pay attention, ilse.

415
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:37,198
If you do not pay attention,
you will never learn.

416
00:33:40,987 --> 00:33:46,958
I said, "get up, ilse."

417
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,329
Up.

418
00:33:58,219 --> 00:34:01,339
Now, we'll try again.

419
00:34:01,374 --> 00:34:04,475
Say your name- ilse.

420
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:06,978
Your name- ilse.

421
00:34:07,013 --> 00:34:09,480
Ilse nielsen.

422
00:34:09,515 --> 00:34:11,983
Do you understand?

423
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:19,490
I will help you to understand.

424
00:34:19,525 --> 00:34:22,610
I will say your name for you.

425
00:34:22,645 --> 00:34:27,365
Ilse, ilse.

426
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,868
Class, tell ilse her name.

427
00:34:30,903 --> 00:34:34,005
On the count of three.

428
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:39,010
One, two, three.

429
00:34:39,045 --> 00:34:40,261
Ilse.

430
00:34:40,296 --> 00:34:45,767
Ilse, ilse, ilse...

431
00:34:52,273 --> 00:34:54,142
don't push, children.

432
00:34:55,393 --> 00:34:57,895
Be careful, be careful.

433
00:35:01,649 --> 00:35:02,900
I want you to know

434
00:35:02,935 --> 00:35:05,403
you're not fooling
me for one moment.

435
00:35:05,438 --> 00:35:06,654
I know exactly
what you are.

436
00:35:07,155 --> 00:35:10,291
I know, because my father tried
to force me

437
00:35:10,326 --> 00:35:14,045
into the same thing
when i was your age,

438
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:17,799
and after many years
of concentrated effort,

439
00:35:17,834 --> 00:35:22,804
i overcame that sickness
which my father had forced on me

440
00:35:22,839 --> 00:35:26,557
as i am going to help you
overcome it, ilse.

441
00:35:28,426 --> 00:35:30,311
It's true, isn't it?

442
00:35:30,346 --> 00:35:34,065
They've been training you
to be a medium,

443
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:37,819
trying to distort
your innocent mind

444
00:35:37,854 --> 00:35:40,321
to communicate with the dead.

445
00:35:42,824 --> 00:35:46,327
You've been trained
to be a medium, haven't you?

446
00:35:46,362 --> 00:35:47,578
Haven't you?

447
00:35:47,613 --> 00:35:49,080
No, it isn't true.

448
00:35:49,115 --> 00:35:53,451
That's not what
they were training me for.

449
00:35:53,486 --> 00:35:54,952
You understand me.

450
00:35:54,987 --> 00:35:56,838
You know what i think.

451
00:35:56,873 --> 00:35:58,706
Don't you see, ilse?

452
00:35:58,741 --> 00:36:01,209
You've proven my point.

453
00:36:01,244 --> 00:36:03,094
You've proven it to me.

454
00:36:04,846 --> 00:36:09,217
You are a medium.

455
00:36:09,252 --> 00:36:11,719
No, i'm not. You're wrong.

456
00:36:12,353 --> 00:36:13,604
I'm not a medium.

457
00:36:18,726 --> 00:36:19,977
I was wondering...

458
00:36:20,012 --> 00:36:21,229
mrs. Wheeler.

459
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:27,985
Oh, ilse,
was it so bad?

460
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,620
No, she's coming along nicely.

461
00:36:29,655 --> 00:36:32,123
Oh, she was
a little timid at first,

462
00:36:32,158 --> 00:36:33,624
but she's learning.

463
00:36:33,659 --> 00:36:36,377
She's most definitely learning.

464
00:36:39,247 --> 00:36:40,498
I'm so glad.

465
00:36:40,533 --> 00:36:42,633
We'll see her
tomorrow morning, then.

466
00:36:42,668 --> 00:36:44,502
Yes.

467
00:36:45,136 --> 00:36:47,638
Good-bye, miss frank.

468
00:36:47,673 --> 00:36:50,141
Come along, dear.

469
00:36:54,145 --> 00:36:59,150
The next day and the next day
and the next day.

470
00:37:29,263 --> 00:37:31,766
Please, sir.

471
00:37:31,801 --> 00:37:34,268
Where could we
find authority?

472
00:37:36,637 --> 00:37:37,888
Authority?

473
00:37:39,175 --> 00:37:42,643
Yes, uh... how
do you say it?

474
00:37:42,678 --> 00:37:45,146
The constable, the...

475
00:37:47,898 --> 00:37:49,150
sheriff.

476
00:37:49,185 --> 00:37:50,284
Oh, yes, yes.

477
00:37:50,319 --> 00:37:51,535
The sheriff.

478
00:37:54,038 --> 00:37:55,289
Turn around.

479
00:37:55,324 --> 00:37:56,907
Bitte?

480
00:37:58,159 --> 00:37:59,543
Turn around.

481
00:38:03,664 --> 00:38:04,915
That building.

482
00:38:06,167 --> 00:38:07,418
Oh.

483
00:38:07,453 --> 00:38:08,669
Danke.

484
00:38:08,704 --> 00:38:09,920
Uh... thank you.

485
00:38:14,925 --> 00:38:16,177
Constable.

486
00:38:17,463 --> 00:38:20,431
I feel so guilty, karl.

487
00:38:20,466 --> 00:38:21,682
What else
could we do?

488
00:38:21,717 --> 00:38:24,819
We simply could not
get away any sooner.

489
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:28,572
We have our own
responsibility

490
00:38:28,607 --> 00:38:29,824
to the project.

491
00:38:29,859 --> 00:38:31,692
I know,
but almost three months

492
00:38:31,727 --> 00:38:34,195
since we last heard
from holger and fanny.

493
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:36,080
If they only
hadn't chosen

494
00:38:36,115 --> 00:38:38,582
such a far-removed
location for their work.

495
00:38:38,617 --> 00:38:39,834
They are americans, karl.

496
00:38:39,869 --> 00:38:41,702
We could not have
expected them

497
00:38:41,737 --> 00:38:42,953
to reside in europe.

498
00:38:42,988 --> 00:38:44,205
Do you still think

499
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:47,341
that something bad
has happened to them?

500
00:38:47,376 --> 00:38:49,844
Why else would
they have failed to write?

501
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:53,597
I hope you are wrong.

502
00:38:53,632 --> 00:38:54,849
That lovely child.

503
00:38:55,466 --> 00:38:56,717
And such a talent.

504
00:38:56,752 --> 00:38:59,854
Their progress with her
has been phenomenal.

505
00:38:59,889 --> 00:39:01,722
It is almost as if...

506
00:39:01,757 --> 00:39:03,607
as if she wasborntelepathic.

507
00:39:03,642 --> 00:39:06,977
I think that of
all the children,

508
00:39:07,012 --> 00:39:09,480
she had the
most potential.

509
00:39:27,248 --> 00:39:29,133
Yuck.

510
00:39:41,011 --> 00:39:42,897
Hello?

511
00:39:42,932 --> 00:39:44,765
It's me, cora

512
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,268
yes, dear?

513
00:39:49,188 --> 00:39:52,907
Well, what is it, harry?

514
00:39:54,193 --> 00:39:56,026
Harry.

515
00:39:56,061 --> 00:39:59,780
The ones from europe
are here, cora.

516
00:40:01,665 --> 00:40:04,168
Did you hear me?

517
00:40:07,922 --> 00:40:08,539
Yeah.

518
00:40:08,574 --> 00:40:11,041
I'm going to have to
bring them over to the house.

519
00:40:11,076 --> 00:40:13,544
We'll be over in a little while.

520
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:48,579
If we'd only
heard from you...

521
00:40:48,614 --> 00:40:49,830
but not a word.

522
00:40:49,865 --> 00:40:52,333
You can understand
why we felt free

523
00:40:52,368 --> 00:40:54,218
to start adoption
proceedings.

524
00:40:54,835 --> 00:40:57,972
We understand
completely, sheriff.

525
00:40:58,007 --> 00:41:02,343
However, as i've said,
we received no letters.

526
00:41:02,378 --> 00:41:04,228
Just don't
understand it.

527
00:41:04,845 --> 00:41:05,479
Well...

528
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:25,616
holger and fanny dead.

529
00:41:25,651 --> 00:41:28,118
I still can't believe it.

530
00:41:28,153 --> 00:41:30,004
How horrible.

531
00:41:30,039 --> 00:41:33,123
Even more horrible,
the thought of ilse exposed

532
00:41:33,158 --> 00:41:35,009
to people who do not understand.

533
00:41:38,512 --> 00:41:41,015
Cora, this is professor werner,
mrs. Werner.

534
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:42,266
My wife.

535
00:41:42,301 --> 00:41:44,134
Mrs. Wheeler.

536
00:41:47,021 --> 00:41:48,889
How do you do?

537
00:41:50,774 --> 00:41:53,277
Won't you come in?

538
00:41:54,028 --> 00:41:55,279
Thank you.

539
00:42:02,536 --> 00:42:06,290
They say they never received
those letters i wrote to them.

540
00:42:06,325 --> 00:42:07,541
Oh?

541
00:42:07,576 --> 00:42:10,044
That's odd.

542
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:11,295
Won't you sit down?

543
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:13,163
Thank you.

544
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:19,420
She burned those
letters, maria.

545
00:42:19,455 --> 00:42:21,305
Yes, i know.

546
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:23,173
How terribly she suffers.

547
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:29,430
Frau werner,
you came a long way.

548
00:42:31,315 --> 00:42:33,183
Yes, we did.

549
00:42:33,218 --> 00:42:36,320
Are we going to tell them
anything about ilse?

550
00:42:36,355 --> 00:42:39,440
Not unless we have to.

551
00:42:39,475 --> 00:42:40,691
May we see ilse?

552
00:42:42,576 --> 00:42:46,330
Well, i'm going to pick her up
at school in a little while.

553
00:42:46,947 --> 00:42:48,832
School?

554
00:42:48,867 --> 00:42:51,952
They should never have sent her
to school.

555
00:42:53,704 --> 00:42:55,589
Ilse?

556
00:42:55,624 --> 00:42:58,709
Ilse nielsen.

557
00:42:58,744 --> 00:42:59,960
Stand up.

558
00:43:01,211 --> 00:43:03,714
Stand up, ilse.

559
00:43:07,468 --> 00:43:08,719
Come forward.

560
00:43:12,473 --> 00:43:14,975
Face the class.

561
00:43:18,112 --> 00:43:21,231
Straighten up.

562
00:43:21,266 --> 00:43:22,483
Shoulders back.

563
00:43:25,619 --> 00:43:27,488
Now, what is your name?

564
00:43:30,624 --> 00:43:31,241
Your name.

565
00:43:34,378 --> 00:43:36,246
What is your name?

566
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:40,634
Class...

567
00:43:40,669 --> 00:43:43,003
we will do again

568
00:43:43,038 --> 00:43:45,506
what we've been doing
for the past week.

569
00:43:45,541 --> 00:43:49,643
On the count of three,
think ilse's name.

570
00:43:49,678 --> 00:43:51,512
Don't say it aloud.

571
00:43:52,146 --> 00:43:52,763
Ready?

572
00:43:52,798 --> 00:43:58,402
One, two, three.

573
00:43:58,437 --> 00:44:03,774
Ilse, ilse, ilse, ilse,

574
00:44:03,809 --> 00:44:09,663
ilse, ilse, ilse, ilse...

575
00:44:16,286 --> 00:44:19,423
here they come.

576
00:44:40,194 --> 00:44:42,696
Ilse...

577
00:44:42,731 --> 00:44:47,067
this is professor
and frau werner.

578
00:44:47,102 --> 00:44:49,570
Hello, young lady.

579
00:44:52,706 --> 00:44:54,708
Ilse, you must concentrate.

580
00:44:54,743 --> 00:44:58,462
Your father was
in contact with us.

581
00:44:58,497 --> 00:45:04,084
Our children once were
being trained just like you.

582
00:45:04,119 --> 00:45:07,838
They're in germany.

583
00:45:07,873 --> 00:45:12,843
Ilse, you remember
the pakt, elkenbergs-

584
00:45:12,878 --> 00:45:17,231
us, the kalders,
your father and your mother.

585
00:45:17,266 --> 00:45:21,602
Dusseldorf, ten years ago.

586
00:45:21,637 --> 00:45:26,607
The pact, the project
about mental telepathy.

587
00:45:26,642 --> 00:45:30,360
Germany, ten years ago.

588
00:45:30,395 --> 00:45:34,114
The pact... telepathy.

589
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:38,752
The werners are
from europe, ilse.

590
00:45:38,787 --> 00:45:40,621
They were friends
of your parents.

591
00:45:43,123 --> 00:45:46,260
Ilse- think!

592
00:45:46,295 --> 00:45:49,379
Ilse, where
is your mind?

593
00:45:49,414 --> 00:45:52,883
Your mind, ilse.

594
00:45:52,918 --> 00:45:55,385
Concentrate!

595
00:46:01,024 --> 00:46:04,778
My... name...

596
00:46:04,813 --> 00:46:06,647
is ilse.

597
00:46:09,149 --> 00:46:10,400
My name...

598
00:46:11,034 --> 00:46:12,286
is ilse.

599
00:46:14,154 --> 00:46:16,039
My name...

600
00:46:16,074 --> 00:46:17,291
is ilse.

601
00:46:19,159 --> 00:46:21,044
My name...

602
00:46:21,079 --> 00:46:22,913
is ilse.

603
00:46:22,948 --> 00:46:26,667
My name is ilse!

604
00:46:27,918 --> 00:46:30,420
Don't cry, baby.

605
00:46:30,455 --> 00:46:32,306
Don't cry.

606
00:46:32,341 --> 00:46:35,425
I'm here,
i'm here.

607
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:39,179
Don't cry, darling,
i'm with you.

608
00:46:39,214 --> 00:46:40,430
I'm with you.

609
00:46:40,465 --> 00:46:43,567
You can't take
her away from me!

610
00:46:43,602 --> 00:46:44,818
Cora!

611
00:46:44,853 --> 00:46:46,687
No!

612
00:46:47,321 --> 00:46:50,440
I won't let them.

613
00:46:51,074 --> 00:46:52,943
I love her.

614
00:46:52,978 --> 00:46:56,079
And she loves me,
and sheneedsme.

615
00:46:59,618 --> 00:47:06,456
You have no right.

616
00:47:06,491 --> 00:47:08,959
You have no right!

617
00:47:15,215 --> 00:47:17,100
I want to
apologize again

618
00:47:17,135 --> 00:47:18,969
for my wife
and myself.

619
00:47:19,004 --> 00:47:20,220
We thought...

620
00:47:20,255 --> 00:47:20,854
we understand.

621
00:47:20,889 --> 00:47:22,723
Naturally,
you would think

622
00:47:22,758 --> 00:47:23,974
that we have come

623
00:47:24,009 --> 00:47:25,859
to take ilse
back with us.

624
00:47:25,894 --> 00:47:29,613
However, as i've said,

625
00:47:29,648 --> 00:47:32,733
we have no legal power
to demand her...

626
00:47:32,768 --> 00:47:34,618
being no relation.

627
00:47:36,486 --> 00:47:37,738
Good-bye, sheriff.

628
00:47:37,773 --> 00:47:39,623
Good-bye.
Good luck.

629
00:47:39,658 --> 00:47:41,491
Uh...

630
00:47:41,526 --> 00:47:43,994
and thanks again.

631
00:47:44,029 --> 00:47:45,245
Your bus ought
to be along

632
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,748
in five or
ten minutes.

633
00:48:03,013 --> 00:48:05,515
I hope we have made
no mistake

634
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:07,401
letting them keep her,

635
00:48:07,436 --> 00:48:09,269
even though the nielsens
did give us

636
00:48:09,304 --> 00:48:11,154
the legal right to...

637
00:48:11,189 --> 00:48:13,023
i don't think
so, karl.

638
00:48:13,058 --> 00:48:15,025
To take her
to the other children now

639
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:16,910
would be terrible for her.

640
00:48:16,945 --> 00:48:18,161
Her facility is gone.

641
00:48:18,196 --> 00:48:20,030
Even with work,
it might not return.

642
00:48:20,065 --> 00:48:21,915
I suppose.

643
00:48:21,950 --> 00:48:26,920
But all those years holger
and fanny spent on her...

644
00:48:26,955 --> 00:48:28,171
wasted.

645
00:48:28,206 --> 00:48:29,423
Wasted?

646
00:48:29,458 --> 00:48:31,925
If they had not made
her mind so receptive,

647
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:35,679
how could they have led her
out from the burning house,

648
00:48:35,714 --> 00:48:37,547
even though
they were trapped?

649
00:48:37,582 --> 00:48:42,302
But the loss, the loss-
it isn't right.

650
00:48:42,337 --> 00:48:44,805
There is no right or wrong
to it, karl.

651
00:48:45,439 --> 00:48:46,690
They all meant well.

652
00:48:46,725 --> 00:48:49,192
No one wanted anything
but to help her.

653
00:48:49,227 --> 00:48:51,061
But to lose everything?

654
00:48:51,096 --> 00:48:53,563
She has not lost everything.

655
00:48:53,598 --> 00:48:56,066
She has gained something, karl.

656
00:48:56,101 --> 00:48:56,700
Gained?

657
00:48:56,735 --> 00:48:58,568
We always knew

658
00:48:58,603 --> 00:49:01,705
that holger and fanny
did not really care for her.

659
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:02,322
Maria.

660
00:49:02,357 --> 00:49:04,207
They were not unkind.

661
00:49:04,242 --> 00:49:07,961
They gave her what affection
they had in them to give.

662
00:49:07,996 --> 00:49:10,464
But the project
always came first.

663
00:49:10,499 --> 00:49:11,715
You know that, karl.

664
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:14,217
For them, ilse was
less a daughter

665
00:49:14,252 --> 00:49:16,720
than she was an
experiment in flesh.

666
00:49:18,088 --> 00:49:20,590
She's going to be all right.

667
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:22,476
For now, she's loved,

668
00:49:23,093 --> 00:49:27,481
and that is so much more
important than telepathy.

669
00:49:27,516 --> 00:49:28,732
Isn't it?

670
00:49:31,601 --> 00:49:34,104
Yes, liebchen.

671
00:49:34,139 --> 00:49:35,989
Much more important.

672
00:49:48,502 --> 00:49:51,621
It has been noted
in a book of proven wisdom

673
00:49:51,656 --> 00:49:54,124
that perfect love
casteth out fear.

674
00:49:54,159 --> 00:49:56,510
Well, it's unlikely
that this observation

675
00:49:56,545 --> 00:49:59,012
was meant to include
that specific fear

676
00:49:59,047 --> 00:50:02,132
which follows the loss
of extrasensory perception.

677
00:50:02,167 --> 00:50:05,769
The principle remains,
as always, beautifully intact.

678
00:50:05,804 --> 00:50:08,271
That of ilse nielsen,

679
00:50:08,306 --> 00:50:11,391
former resident
of the twilight zone.

680
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:24,287
Mr. Richard matheson
lets his typewriter

681
00:50:24,322 --> 00:50:27,407
pay us a return visit
next time out ontwilight zone

682
00:50:27,442 --> 00:50:29,292
with a story
called "death ship."

683
00:50:29,910 --> 00:50:31,795
Now this one is
for science fiction aficionados,

684
00:50:31,830 --> 00:50:33,046
ghost story buffs

685
00:50:33,081 --> 00:50:34,915
and any and all
who file away clues

686
00:50:34,950 --> 00:50:37,417
with an eye toward
outguessing the writer.

687
00:50:37,452 --> 00:50:40,554
Next ontwilight zone,
misters jack klugman,

688
00:50:40,589 --> 00:50:44,307
ross martin and fred beir
take an extended trip

689
00:50:44,342 --> 00:50:46,309
through space on a death ship.

690
00:50:46,344 --> 00:50:49,930
Captain.

691
00:50:49,965 --> 00:50:52,432
Something glittered
down there.

692
00:50:52,467 --> 00:50:54,317
What is it?

693
00:50:54,352 --> 00:50:55,569
Something down there?

694
00:50:55,604 --> 00:50:56,820
Mason thinks so.

695
00:50:56,855 --> 00:50:58,071
There was something.

696
00:51:15,205 --> 00:51:17,090
We stay together.

697
00:51:17,125 --> 00:51:18,959
No one takes any risks.

698
00:51:18,994 --> 00:51:20,844
That's an order, mason.
