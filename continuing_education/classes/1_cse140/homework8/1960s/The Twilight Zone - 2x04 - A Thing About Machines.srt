1
00:00:09,776 --> 00:00:12,278
You're traveling
through another dimension-

2
00:00:12,313 --> 00:00:15,415
a dimension not only of sight
and sound, but of mind.

3
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:17,283
A journey into a wondrous land

4
00:00:17,318 --> 00:00:19,536
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

5
00:00:19,571 --> 00:00:20,787
That's the signpost up ahead.

6
00:00:20,822 --> 00:00:24,174
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

7
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:26,352
How are you today,
mr. Finchley?

8
00:01:26,387 --> 00:01:29,489
I'll answer that burning
question after you tell me

9
00:01:29,524 --> 00:01:32,609
what's wrong with that
miracle of modern science,

10
00:01:32,644 --> 00:01:35,111
and also exactly how much
this current larceny

11
00:01:35,146 --> 00:01:36,362
is going to cost me.

12
00:01:36,397 --> 00:01:38,615
Well, there's
two hours labor,

13
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:39,866
broken set of tubes,

14
00:01:39,901 --> 00:01:42,368
new oscillator
and a new filter.

15
00:01:42,403 --> 00:01:44,871
How very technical,
and how very convincing.

16
00:01:45,255 --> 00:01:46,506
I presume
i'm to be dunned once again

17
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:49,626
for three times the worth
of the blasted thing.

18
00:01:49,661 --> 00:01:51,127
Last time i was over here,

19
00:01:51,162 --> 00:01:53,630
you'd kicked your foot
through the screen.

20
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,131
Remember?

21
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:57,016
I have a vivid recollection,
thank you.

22
00:01:57,051 --> 00:01:58,885
The set was not
working properly.

23
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,021
I tried to get it to do so
in a perfectly normal fashion.

24
00:02:02,056 --> 00:02:05,775
By kicking your foot
through the screen?

25
00:02:08,278 --> 00:02:10,780
Why didn't you just
horsewhip it, mr. Finchley?

26
00:02:10,815 --> 00:02:12,649
That'd show it
who's boss.

27
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:18,288
Supposing we stop this
moronic small talk, shall we,

28
00:02:18,323 --> 00:02:21,407
and get down to some
serious larceny?

29
00:02:21,442 --> 00:02:22,659
You may read me
off the damages.

30
00:02:22,694 --> 00:02:24,160
Although
i sometimes wonder

31
00:02:24,195 --> 00:02:26,045
what exactly
is the purpose

32
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,914
of the better
business bureau

33
00:02:27,949 --> 00:02:30,416
when it allows itinerant
extortionists like you

34
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,302
to come back
week after week,

35
00:02:32,337 --> 00:02:33,553
move wires around,

36
00:02:33,588 --> 00:02:36,055
busily probe
with ham-like hands,

37
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,558
and achieve nothing
but the financial ruin

38
00:02:38,593 --> 00:02:39,809
of every customer.

39
00:02:39,844 --> 00:02:42,312
We're not a gyp outfit,
mr. Finchley.

40
00:02:42,347 --> 00:02:44,180
We're legitimate
repairmen.

41
00:02:44,215 --> 00:02:45,431
But i'll tell
you something

42
00:02:45,466 --> 00:02:47,934
about yourself.

43
00:02:47,969 --> 00:02:49,185
That tv set
doesn't work

44
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,070
because, obviously,
you got in back of it,

45
00:02:51,105 --> 00:02:52,939
and you yanked
out a lot of wires,

46
00:02:52,974 --> 00:02:54,190
and i don't
know what else.

47
00:02:54,225 --> 00:02:56,075
Now, a month ago, you
called me over here

48
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,327
to fix your
portable radio

49
00:02:57,944 --> 00:03:00,580
because you threw
it downstairs.

50
00:03:00,615 --> 00:03:02,448
That did not work
properly either.

51
00:03:02,483 --> 00:03:04,334
Well, that's the point, mr. Finchley.

52
00:03:04,369 --> 00:03:06,202
Why don't they
work properly?

53
00:03:06,237 --> 00:03:09,339
Offhand, i'd say it's because
you don't treat them properly.

54
00:03:09,374 --> 00:03:11,207
I assume there'll
be an extra charge

55
00:03:11,242 --> 00:03:12,458
for that analysis?

56
00:03:12,493 --> 00:03:15,962
What does go wrong with
these things, mr. Finchley?

57
00:03:15,997 --> 00:03:17,213
Have you got any idea?

58
00:03:17,248 --> 00:03:21,601
Aside from being a
rather incompetent clod,

59
00:03:21,636 --> 00:03:24,721
you're a very
unreceptive man.

60
00:03:24,756 --> 00:03:26,606
I have already explained to you,

61
00:03:26,641 --> 00:03:29,726
the television set simply
did not work properly.

62
00:03:29,761 --> 00:03:31,611
And, as for
that marconi original

63
00:03:31,646 --> 00:03:34,113
operating under the guise
of a modern radio,

64
00:03:34,148 --> 00:03:35,982
that gave nothing but static.

65
00:03:36,017 --> 00:03:39,118
Are you sure that's all
that was wrong with them?

66
00:03:39,736 --> 00:03:42,238
All right, mr. Finchley,
i'll send you a bill.

67
00:03:42,273 --> 00:03:43,489
Of that
i have no doubt.

68
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:48,494
Finchley, what is it
with you and machines?

69
00:03:48,529 --> 00:03:50,997
I shall file
that idiotic question

70
00:03:51,032 --> 00:03:52,882
in my memorabilia

71
00:03:52,917 --> 00:03:55,385
to be referred to
at some future date

72
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,002
when i write my memoirs.

73
00:03:56,037 --> 00:03:57,253
You, my good friend,

74
00:03:57,288 --> 00:03:59,756
will fill
one entire chapter

75
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:04,761
entitled, "the most
forgettable person i ever met."

76
00:04:10,266 --> 00:04:14,020
It just so happens that every
machine in this house is...

77
00:04:41,466 --> 00:04:43,933
all right.

78
00:04:43,968 --> 00:04:45,802
That will be enough of that.

79
00:04:48,938 --> 00:04:51,441
Do you hear me?

80
00:04:51,476 --> 00:04:54,560
I said that will
be enough of that!

81
00:04:54,595 --> 00:04:56,446
Stop!

82
00:04:57,063 --> 00:04:58,314
Stop!

83
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:11,327
This is mr. Bartlett finchley,
age 48,

84
00:05:11,362 --> 00:05:13,212
a practicing sophisticate

85
00:05:13,247 --> 00:05:15,715
who writes very special
and very precious things

86
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,217
for gourmet magazines
and the like.

87
00:05:18,252 --> 00:05:20,720
He's a bachelor and a recluse
with few friends,

88
00:05:20,755 --> 00:05:24,474
only devotees and adherents
to the cause of tart sophistry.

89
00:05:24,509 --> 00:05:27,593
He has no interests save
whatever current annoyances

90
00:05:27,628 --> 00:05:28,845
he can put his mind to.

91
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,730
He has no purpose to his life

92
00:05:30,765 --> 00:05:33,850
except the formulation
of day-to-day opportunities

93
00:05:33,885 --> 00:05:36,352
to vent his wrath
on mechanical contrivances

94
00:05:36,387 --> 00:05:37,603
of an age he abhors.

95
00:05:37,638 --> 00:05:40,740
In short, mr. Bartlett finchley
is a malcontent,

96
00:05:40,775 --> 00:05:43,860
born either too late
or too early in the century,

97
00:05:43,895 --> 00:05:46,996
and who, in just a moment,
will enter a realm

98
00:05:47,031 --> 00:05:49,499
where muscles
and the will to fight back

99
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:52,001
are not limited to human beings.

100
00:05:52,036 --> 00:05:55,755
Next stop for mr. Bartlett
finchley- the twilight zone.

101
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:11,020
Miss rogers.

102
00:06:20,897 --> 00:06:22,148
Is this all
you've done?

103
00:06:22,183 --> 00:06:24,033
That's all i've done.

104
00:06:24,068 --> 00:06:25,284
That's 30 pages

105
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:26,536
in three hours
and a half.

106
00:06:26,571 --> 00:06:28,404
That's the best
i can do, mr. Finchley.

107
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:30,289
It's that
idiotic machine-

108
00:06:30,324 --> 00:06:32,158
that typewriter
of yours.

109
00:06:32,193 --> 00:06:34,043
Thomas jefferson
wrote the entire

110
00:06:34,078 --> 00:06:37,163
declaration of independence
with a feather quill,

111
00:06:37,198 --> 00:06:39,048
and it took him
only half a day.

112
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:42,168
Why don't you hire
mr. Jefferson?

113
00:06:42,203 --> 00:06:44,053
Miss rogers,
did i ever tell you

114
00:06:44,088 --> 00:06:45,922
with what degree
of distaste

115
00:06:45,957 --> 00:06:47,807
i view
insubordination?

116
00:06:47,842 --> 00:06:51,427
Often and endlessly.

117
00:06:52,061 --> 00:06:54,564
I'll tell you what,
mr. Finchley.

118
00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:56,566
You get yourself
another girl-

119
00:06:56,601 --> 00:06:58,434
one with three arms,

120
00:06:58,469 --> 00:07:00,937
and with roughly
the same sensitivity

121
00:07:00,972 --> 00:07:03,439
as an alligator.

122
00:07:03,474 --> 00:07:04,690
Then you can
work together

123
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:06,576
till death
do you part.

124
00:07:06,611 --> 00:07:09,695
As for me...

125
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,581
i've had it.

126
00:07:11,616 --> 00:07:12,832
And you are going where?

127
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:18,454
Anyplace where i can be away
from the highly articulate,

128
00:07:18,489 --> 00:07:22,842
oh, so sophisticated, bon vivant
of america's winers and diners-

129
00:07:22,877 --> 00:07:25,962
a mr. Bartlett
finchley.

130
00:07:25,997 --> 00:07:27,847
You even got me
talking like you.

131
00:07:27,882 --> 00:07:30,967
Miss rogers, please.

132
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:34,720
Don't leave.

133
00:07:34,755 --> 00:07:36,606
I beg your pardon?

134
00:07:36,641 --> 00:07:39,108
I do wish you'd...

135
00:07:39,143 --> 00:07:40,359
i wish
you'd stay for a bit.

136
00:07:40,394 --> 00:07:42,862
Oh, i don't mean
for work or anything.

137
00:07:42,897 --> 00:07:43,479
All that can wait.

138
00:07:43,514 --> 00:07:44,730
I was just thinking

139
00:07:44,765 --> 00:07:46,616
that we could have
dinner or something.

140
00:07:46,651 --> 00:07:48,117
The theater
perhaps?

141
00:07:48,152 --> 00:07:51,237
How very sweet, mr. Finchley.
Thank you.

142
00:07:51,272 --> 00:07:53,372
But no thank you.

143
00:07:53,407 --> 00:07:54,991
Good-bye, mr. Finchley.

144
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:58,244
Before you go, miss rogers...
before you go...

145
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:00,129
yes?

146
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:04,133
I'd like very much...

147
00:08:04,168 --> 00:08:07,887
i'd like very much
not to be alone for a while.

148
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:15,261
Are you ill?

149
00:08:15,296 --> 00:08:17,146
Bad news
or something?

150
00:08:17,181 --> 00:08:17,763
No.

151
00:08:17,798 --> 00:08:19,015
What's your trouble?

152
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:22,768
Does there have to be
trouble just because i...?!

153
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:29,659
I'm desperately tired.

154
00:08:29,694 --> 00:08:32,161
I haven't slept for four nights.

155
00:08:32,196 --> 00:08:35,281
Quite frankly, the thought
of being alone just now

156
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:37,783
is intolerable, miss rogers.

157
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:41,537
Things have been happening...

158
00:08:41,572 --> 00:08:44,040
very odd things.

159
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:47,793
Go on.

160
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:51,547
That television
machine in there...

161
00:08:51,582 --> 00:08:53,683
it goes on late at night and wakes me up.

162
00:08:53,718 --> 00:08:56,802
Just goes on
all by itself.

163
00:08:56,837 --> 00:08:59,305
That radio i kept
in the bedroom-

164
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,556
that went
on and off, too,

165
00:09:00,591 --> 00:09:02,441
just when i was
going to sleep.

166
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,812
There's a conspiracy
in this house, miss rogers.

167
00:09:06,847 --> 00:09:08,064
Conspiracy?

168
00:09:08,099 --> 00:09:10,566
That's exactly what
it is. A conspiracy!

169
00:09:10,601 --> 00:09:13,703
The television set,
the radio, the clock...

170
00:09:13,738 --> 00:09:16,822
even that miserable
car i drive.

171
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:19,959
Last night, i drove it
into the driveway-

172
00:09:19,994 --> 00:09:23,713
just drove it into
the driveway, mind you-

173
00:09:23,748 --> 00:09:26,832
very carefully,
very slowly.

174
00:09:26,867 --> 00:09:29,335
The steering wheel
turned in my hand-

175
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,220
it twisted itself
in my hand.

176
00:09:31,255 --> 00:09:34,974
The car deliberately hit
the side of the garage.

177
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:37,476
It smashed a headlight.

178
00:09:37,511 --> 00:09:39,345
It cost $140.

179
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:44,350
That clock...
over the mantelpiece.

180
00:09:48,104 --> 00:09:51,240
Oh, uh...
i threw it away.

181
00:09:53,109 --> 00:09:55,611
What i'm getting at,
miss rogers,

182
00:09:55,646 --> 00:09:58,114
is that, for as long
as i have lived,

183
00:09:58,149 --> 00:10:01,250
i have never been able
to operate machines.

184
00:10:01,285 --> 00:10:03,753
Mr. Finchley, i think
you ought to see a doctor.

185
00:10:03,788 --> 00:10:06,872
A doctor?

186
00:10:06,907 --> 00:10:11,877
The universal panacea of the
dreamless 20th-century idiot.

187
00:10:11,912 --> 00:10:14,380
If you're depressed,
see a doctor.

188
00:10:14,415 --> 00:10:16,265
If you're happy, see a doctor.

189
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,134
If the salary is too low

190
00:10:18,169 --> 00:10:20,636
and the mortgage is too high,
see a doctor.

191
00:10:20,671 --> 00:10:24,390
You, miss rogers...
yousee a doctor.

192
00:10:24,425 --> 00:10:28,144
I am a logical, rational,
intelligent man.

193
00:10:28,179 --> 00:10:29,395
I know what i see.

194
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:31,280
I know what i hear.

195
00:10:32,683 --> 00:10:34,900
And for the past three months,
i've been seeing and hearing

196
00:10:34,935 --> 00:10:38,037
a collection of mechanical
frankensteinian monsters

197
00:10:38,072 --> 00:10:40,539
whose whole purpose
is to destroy me.

198
00:10:40,574 --> 00:10:43,042
Now, what do you think
of that, miss rogers?

199
00:10:43,077 --> 00:10:44,910
I think you're
terribly ill

200
00:10:44,945 --> 00:10:46,796
and you need
medical attention.

201
00:10:46,831 --> 00:10:48,664
I also think that
you're suffering

202
00:10:48,699 --> 00:10:51,167
from a bad case of nerves
due to lack of sleep

203
00:10:51,801 --> 00:10:54,303
and that way down deep
you yourself realize

204
00:10:54,338 --> 00:10:56,806
that these are nothing
more than delusions.

205
00:10:56,841 --> 00:10:59,058
I will not be intimidated by machines.

206
00:10:59,093 --> 00:11:01,560
So it follows that no
empty-headed little female

207
00:11:01,595 --> 00:11:04,680
with a mechanical face
can do anything to me either.

208
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:10,186
Mr. Finchley, in this
conspiracy you speak of,

209
00:11:10,221 --> 00:11:14,573
this mortal combat
between you and the appliances,

210
00:11:14,608 --> 00:11:17,076
i hope you lose.

211
00:11:17,111 --> 00:11:18,944
Get out!

212
00:11:48,357 --> 00:11:51,477
"Get out of here, finchley."

213
00:11:51,512 --> 00:11:53,979
Getoutof here, finchley!

214
00:11:54,014 --> 00:11:57,116
Who are you to tell me
to get out of here?

215
00:11:57,151 --> 00:12:00,870
No, no, this is absurd.

216
00:12:00,905 --> 00:12:02,121
It's a typewriter...

217
00:12:02,156 --> 00:12:03,989
a device...

218
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:07,743
an inanimate, senseless machine.

219
00:12:12,882 --> 00:12:14,750
Get out of
here, finchley.

220
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:01,547
Whydon'tyou get
out of here, finchley?

221
00:13:18,482 --> 00:13:19,815
All right.

222
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:22,318
All right, you machines.

223
00:13:22,353 --> 00:13:24,820
You're not going
to intimidate me.

224
00:13:24,855 --> 00:13:26,705
Do you hear me?

225
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,574
You are not going
to intimidate me.

226
00:13:28,609 --> 00:13:30,459
You...

227
00:13:30,494 --> 00:13:32,962
you machines!

228
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:53,616
Miss moore, please.

229
00:13:53,651 --> 00:13:55,501
Oh, agatha.

230
00:13:55,536 --> 00:13:58,003
Bartlett finchley here.

231
00:13:58,038 --> 00:13:59,872
How are you, my dear?

232
00:13:59,907 --> 00:14:02,374
Yes, it has been a long time-
too long-

233
00:14:02,409 --> 00:14:04,260
which, indeed, prompts
this call.

234
00:14:04,295 --> 00:14:07,379
How about dinner tonight?

235
00:14:07,414 --> 00:14:09,265
Oh.

236
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,516
I see.

237
00:14:10,551 --> 00:14:14,270
Yes, well, of course,
it is short notice, but i...

238
00:14:14,305 --> 00:14:17,389
hmm. Of course.

239
00:14:17,424 --> 00:14:21,777
All right, i'll, uh...
i'll call you again... my dear.

240
00:14:48,671 --> 00:14:51,173
Mrs. Donnelly, please.

241
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:53,676
Oh, pauline, is this you?

242
00:14:53,711 --> 00:14:57,429
And how is my favorite,
attractive young widow?

243
00:14:58,681 --> 00:15:00,566
Bartlett.

244
00:15:00,601 --> 00:15:03,068
Bartlett finchley.

245
00:15:03,103 --> 00:15:05,571
Yes, i was just wondering if...

246
00:15:05,606 --> 00:15:07,439
oh.

247
00:15:07,474 --> 00:15:09,325
Oh, i see.

248
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,078
Well, i'm delighted,
i'm simply delighted.

249
00:15:13,113 --> 00:15:15,581
I'll send you a wedding present.

250
00:15:15,616 --> 00:15:16,832
Of course.

251
00:15:16,867 --> 00:15:18,701
Good night.

252
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:24,340
Telephones.

253
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:25,591
Just like the rest.

254
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:28,093
Exactly like all the rest.

255
00:15:28,128 --> 00:15:30,596
Their whole existence dedicated
to embarrassing me

256
00:15:30,631 --> 00:15:34,350
or irritating me
or making my life miserable.

257
00:15:34,385 --> 00:15:37,469
Well, who needs you?

258
00:15:37,504 --> 00:15:38,721
Who needs any of you?

259
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:21,397
Whydon'tyou get
out of here, finchley?

260
00:16:22,264 --> 00:16:24,767
Whydon't you get out of here, finchley?

261
00:16:24,802 --> 00:16:27,903
Whydon'tyou get
out of here, finchley?

262
00:16:27,938 --> 00:16:31,023
Get out of here, finchley!

263
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:36,028
Get out of here, finchley!

264
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:02,938
She rolled
down the driveway,

265
00:17:02,973 --> 00:17:04,189
almost hit a kid
on a bike.

266
00:17:04,224 --> 00:17:06,058
You ought to check that
emergency brake, mister.

267
00:17:06,093 --> 00:17:07,943
The emergency
brake was on.

268
00:17:07,978 --> 00:17:09,194
Oh, no, it wasn't.

269
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:11,697
Or if it was, it isn't
working properly.

270
00:17:11,732 --> 00:17:14,199
She rolled down the driveway
and right out into the street.

271
00:17:14,234 --> 00:17:16,068
You're lucky it
didn't hit anyone.

272
00:17:16,103 --> 00:17:17,319
Monster.

273
00:17:17,354 --> 00:17:19,204
You got the keys?

274
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:21,073
Yes. Oh, they're
in the house.

275
00:17:21,108 --> 00:17:24,209
Well, you better pull it
back up into the garage.

276
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:26,078
And you ought to check
that emergency brake

277
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,580
the first chance you get,
understand, mister?

278
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:32,968
All right,
dear friends.

279
00:17:33,003 --> 00:17:34,720
You may remain on my property

280
00:17:34,755 --> 00:17:36,588
goggling at this
astonishing sight

281
00:17:36,623 --> 00:17:38,474
for another three
and a half minutes.

282
00:17:38,509 --> 00:17:40,843
If, when i return
with my car keys,

283
00:17:40,878 --> 00:17:42,728
you are not
off my property,

284
00:17:42,763 --> 00:17:46,849
i shall enlist the aid
of this underpaidgendarme

285
00:17:46,884 --> 00:17:48,734
to forcibly eject you.

286
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:53,989
Idiots.

287
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,563
"Get out of here, finchley."

288
00:19:09,466 --> 00:19:11,316
No.

289
00:19:11,351 --> 00:19:13,185
Get out of here, finchley.

290
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,687
Why don't you get out of here,
finchley?

291
00:19:15,722 --> 00:19:18,574
Whydon'tyou get out of here,
finchley?

292
00:19:18,609 --> 00:19:20,442
Get out of here, finchley!

293
00:19:20,477 --> 00:19:21,076
Get out of here.

294
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:25,080
Get out of here, finchley.

295
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:30,836
No, i won't!

296
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:35,457
I won't!

297
00:19:56,263 --> 00:19:59,364
Get out of here!

298
00:22:59,161 --> 00:23:01,046
You pulled
the body out?

299
00:23:01,081 --> 00:23:01,663
Yeah.

300
00:23:01,698 --> 00:23:03,548
It's funny,
they usually float.

301
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:04,800
What do you
mean, usually?

302
00:23:04,835 --> 00:23:06,668
He was on the bottom.

303
00:23:06,703 --> 00:23:07,302
He hadn't come up.

304
00:23:07,337 --> 00:23:09,171
He wasn't
weighted either.

305
00:23:09,206 --> 00:23:11,673
There was nothing
to hold him down.

306
00:23:11,708 --> 00:23:13,558
His eyes were open,
he looked scared

307
00:23:13,593 --> 00:23:15,427
like something had been
chasing him or something.

308
00:23:15,462 --> 00:23:17,312
The neighbors said
that he'd been shouting

309
00:23:17,347 --> 00:23:18,563
and running around
last night.

310
00:23:18,598 --> 00:23:20,432
I wonder what it was
that could have scared him?

311
00:23:20,467 --> 00:23:24,186
Whatever it was, it's a little
item he took along with him.

312
00:23:24,221 --> 00:23:25,437
Yeah. Maybe he was drunk-

313
00:23:25,472 --> 00:23:26,688
imagining things?

314
00:23:26,723 --> 00:23:27,939
Maybe.

315
00:23:27,974 --> 00:23:30,442
Could be he had a heart
attack or something.

316
00:23:30,477 --> 00:23:31,693
Could be.

317
00:23:31,728 --> 00:23:34,196
It could just be.

318
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,086
Yes, it could just be.

319
00:23:41,121 --> 00:23:44,840
It could just be that
mr. Bartlett finchley succumbed

320
00:23:44,875 --> 00:23:47,342
from a heart attack
and a set of delusions.

321
00:23:47,377 --> 00:23:51,096
It could just be that he was
tormented by an imagination

322
00:23:51,131 --> 00:23:54,850
as sharp as his wit and
as pointed as his dislikes.

323
00:23:54,885 --> 00:23:56,718
But as perceived
by those attending,

324
00:23:56,753 --> 00:24:00,472
this is one explanation
that has left the premises

325
00:24:00,507 --> 00:24:01,106
with the deceased.

326
00:24:01,723 --> 00:24:04,226
Look for it filed
under "m" for machines

327
00:24:04,261 --> 00:24:05,477
in the twilight zone.

rod serling, the creator

330
00:24:13,937 --> 00:24:15,787
will tell you
about next week's story

331
00:24:15,822 --> 00:24:18,290
after this word
from our alternate sponsor.

332
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:21,910
And now, mr. Serling.

333
00:24:21,945 --> 00:24:24,412
Down this hall
is a very strange individual

334
00:24:24,447 --> 00:24:25,664
locked in a room.

335
00:24:25,699 --> 00:24:28,416
He's known by various names
and by various forms,

336
00:24:28,451 --> 00:24:29,668
and next week
onthe twilight zone,

337
00:24:29,703 --> 00:24:32,170
you'll be close to the elbow
of the people who let him out.

338
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,673
Our story is called
"the howling man,"

339
00:24:34,708 --> 00:24:36,558
by mr. Charles bowman.

340
00:24:36,593 --> 00:24:39,060
It's designed for the young in
heart but the strong of nerve.

341
00:24:39,095 --> 00:24:42,180
I hope we'll see you next week,
along with "the howling man."

342
00:24:42,215 --> 00:24:44,065
Thank you, and good night.

343
00:25:27,976 --> 00:25:29,861
Come to the aid of your party.

344
00:25:29,896 --> 00:25:31,730
? don't pass the buck,
but give your bucks?

345
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,232
? to the party of your choice.?
