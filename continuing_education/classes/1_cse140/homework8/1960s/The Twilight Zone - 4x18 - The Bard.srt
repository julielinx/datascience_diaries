1
00:00:06,007 --> 00:00:09,109
You unlock this door
with the key of imagination.

2
00:00:09,144 --> 00:00:10,977
Beyond it is another dimension-

3
00:00:11,012 --> 00:00:13,480
a dimension of sound,

4
00:00:13,515 --> 00:00:15,365
a dimension of sight,

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,233
a dimension of mind.

6
00:00:17,867 --> 00:00:20,370
You're moving into a land
of both shadow and substance,

7
00:00:20,405 --> 00:00:21,621
of things and ideas.

8
00:00:21,656 --> 00:00:25,375
You've just crossed over
into the twilight zone.

9
00:00:31,631 --> 00:00:34,134
Now, here is this prizefighter

10
00:00:34,169 --> 00:00:36,002
who made this vow to this girl.

11
00:00:36,037 --> 00:00:37,887
Now get this,
mr. Hugo, get this,

12
00:00:37,922 --> 00:00:39,756
if this one ain't surefire,
i'll cut off both my hands.

13
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:41,641
I'll absolutely
cut off both my hands.

14
00:00:41,676 --> 00:00:44,144
You ready?
Are you ready?

15
00:00:44,179 --> 00:00:47,263
"Champeen of the world,"
kirk douglas, maybe.

16
00:00:47,298 --> 00:00:49,149
Burt lancaster.

17
00:00:49,184 --> 00:00:51,017
You want to make
him younger?

18
00:00:51,052 --> 00:00:52,268
Tony curtis.

19
00:00:52,303 --> 00:00:54,154
I give you tony curtis.

20
00:00:54,189 --> 00:00:55,405
I appreciate it.

21
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,907
So now he's
champion of the world

22
00:00:57,942 --> 00:01:00,410
but he's made a promise to
this girl never to fight again.

23
00:01:00,445 --> 00:01:02,912
You know, like a vow.

24
00:01:02,947 --> 00:01:04,781
Vow, mr. Hugo.
It's like a promise.

25
00:01:04,816 --> 00:01:07,033
I mean, like solemn.

26
00:01:07,068 --> 00:01:08,918
And now, mr. Hugo,
comes the meat.

27
00:01:08,953 --> 00:01:10,170
This is what grabs you
right here.

28
00:01:10,205 --> 00:01:12,038
He's got to fight,
but he promised his girl.

29
00:01:12,073 --> 00:01:14,541
And when he tells her,
she's aghast.

30
00:01:14,576 --> 00:01:16,426
This broad is palpitating.

31
00:01:16,461 --> 00:01:19,546
She calls the champeen
a filthy, rotten, dirty...

32
00:01:19,581 --> 00:01:22,048
she's adamant,
is that what you mean?

33
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:25,185
Oh, is this girl adamant.

34
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:28,304
She's adamant like
nobody ever was adamant.

35
00:01:28,339 --> 00:01:30,190
Mr. Hugo?

36
00:01:30,225 --> 00:01:31,441
You're wanted
on line one.

37
00:01:31,476 --> 00:01:33,309
Bless you.

38
00:01:33,344 --> 00:01:34,561
Excuse me,
julius.

39
00:01:34,596 --> 00:01:35,812
See, the beauty of this story

40
00:01:36,446 --> 00:01:37,697
is you can couch it
in so many terms.

41
00:01:37,732 --> 00:01:39,566
Maybe he ain't
a prizefighter.

42
00:01:39,601 --> 00:01:41,451
Maybe he's a cowboy,
a top gun,

43
00:01:41,486 --> 00:01:43,319
and he promised his girl
never to carry a gun again.

44
00:01:43,354 --> 00:01:45,205
Maybe it's
the girl's kid brother

45
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,456
who has
this incurable disease.

46
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:51,327
What's the matter?

47
00:01:51,362 --> 00:01:52,579
That don't grip?

48
00:01:52,614 --> 00:01:54,964
Why don't you
go downstairs

49
00:01:54,999 --> 00:01:57,467
and cross the street
against a red light?

50
00:01:57,502 --> 00:01:58,968
Bye.

51
00:01:59,003 --> 00:02:01,471
Say, how about if it was
a science fiction piece?

52
00:02:01,506 --> 00:02:03,973
This rocket man makes
a promise to his girl

53
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:06,476
never to go up in
a spaceship again.

54
00:02:06,511 --> 00:02:08,344
You've been
here all morning.

55
00:02:08,379 --> 00:02:09,596
I'll give you this.

56
00:02:09,631 --> 00:02:13,349
I've been an agent for 23 years
and i have never heard

57
00:02:13,384 --> 00:02:15,852
of so many variations
of the same story.

58
00:02:15,887 --> 00:02:17,737
Would you mind
going home?

59
00:02:17,772 --> 00:02:21,491
I've got a big deal cooking,
it's very complicated.

60
00:02:21,526 --> 00:02:22,742
A big deal!

61
00:02:22,777 --> 00:02:25,862
You, you, you mean
actually like a big deal?

62
00:02:25,897 --> 00:02:27,747
Oh, you doll baby.

63
00:02:27,782 --> 00:02:30,250
You absolute doll baby.

64
00:02:30,285 --> 00:02:31,501
You were saving it

65
00:02:31,536 --> 00:02:33,369
for a surprise,
weren't you?

66
00:02:33,404 --> 00:02:36,506
That's what you were doing,
saving it for a surprise.

67
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:39,008
Bet you made a sale,
right, mr. Hugo?

68
00:02:39,043 --> 00:02:40,877
You made a sale.

69
00:02:40,912 --> 00:02:42,128
Ah, the zombie story!

70
00:02:42,163 --> 00:02:44,013
I should have known it.

71
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:47,767
The minute i wrote it,
i knew it was surefire.

72
00:02:47,802 --> 00:02:49,018
Absolute surefire.

73
00:02:49,053 --> 00:02:50,270
It's a fantastic yarn, honey.

74
00:02:50,887 --> 00:02:52,772
It's about this dame
who marries a guy

75
00:02:52,807 --> 00:02:54,641
who walks on his heels
all the time.

76
00:02:54,676 --> 00:02:56,776
She thinks he's punchy,
but it turns out he's dead.

77
00:02:56,811 --> 00:03:00,530
All the time they're married,
she don't know he's dead.

78
00:03:00,565 --> 00:03:03,032
Julius, let me put
it to you this way:

79
00:03:03,067 --> 00:03:05,535
The zombie story
didn't sell.

80
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:06,786
The love story

81
00:03:06,821 --> 00:03:10,540
where the lady scientist
falls in love with a robot?

82
00:03:10,575 --> 00:03:12,408
That didn't sell.

83
00:03:12,443 --> 00:03:14,294
Your western
where the president

84
00:03:14,911 --> 00:03:16,796
of the union
pacific railroad

85
00:03:16,831 --> 00:03:19,299
turns out
to be belle starr?

86
00:03:19,334 --> 00:03:21,167
That didn't sell.

87
00:03:21,202 --> 00:03:23,052
Your idea of changing
the millionaire

88
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,555
into
the multimillionaire

89
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:28,675
and making an
hour show of it?

90
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:31,811
This they laughed me right
out of the office with.

91
00:03:31,846 --> 00:03:34,314
So i have to put it
up to you.

92
00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:36,182
I really simply have
to put it up to you.

93
00:03:36,217 --> 00:03:39,319
Why in the world
do you persist?

94
00:03:39,354 --> 00:03:40,570
Can you answer me?

95
00:03:40,605 --> 00:03:42,438
Why do you persist?

96
00:03:42,473 --> 00:03:45,575
Why don't you go back
to doing what you did before?

97
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:47,443
A streetcar
conductor?

98
00:03:47,478 --> 00:03:49,329
Mr. Hugo, it's
like progress.

99
00:03:49,364 --> 00:03:51,831
There ain't no
more streetcars.

100
00:03:51,866 --> 00:03:54,334
Besides, i get
travel sickness.

101
00:03:54,369 --> 00:03:56,836
Let me put it
to you this way:

102
00:03:56,871 --> 00:03:59,339
Number one, you will
never make a writer.

103
00:03:59,374 --> 00:04:02,458
Number two, you'll
starve to death if you try.

104
00:04:02,493 --> 00:04:05,595
And number three,
you're wasting your time,

105
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:08,715
my time, producers' time,
everybody's time.

106
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,600
Phone jerry bauscher
at paramount.

107
00:04:10,635 --> 00:04:12,352
See when he's
through there.

108
00:04:12,387 --> 00:04:14,604
Tell him i've got
a television series.

109
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:18,358
But that's my meat,
a television series.

110
00:04:18,393 --> 00:04:19,609
Mr. Hugo, don't you get it?

111
00:04:19,644 --> 00:04:20,860
It's like a bolt from heaven.

112
00:04:20,895 --> 00:04:23,363
I got so many
television series ideas

113
00:04:23,398 --> 00:04:24,364
i don't
sleep nights.

114
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:25,615
I got television
series ideas

115
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:28,234
what nobody never thought of.

116
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:29,485
Boy meets girl.

117
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,738
Every week, a
different boy and girl.

118
00:04:31,773 --> 00:04:32,989
Julius...

119
00:04:33,024 --> 00:04:34,240
how about a quiz show?

120
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:35,491
"Pick your own embalmer."

121
00:04:35,526 --> 00:04:37,994
We make a deal with
the contestant that
when he kicks off...

122
00:04:38,029 --> 00:04:39,879
julius,
what do i have to do,

123
00:04:39,914 --> 00:04:42,999
what do i have to say
to get you out of here?

124
00:04:43,034 --> 00:04:44,250
Give me a chance.

125
00:04:44,285 --> 00:04:46,753
Give me first
dibs at this, uh,

126
00:04:46,788 --> 00:04:49,889
this-this television series
thing or whatever it is.

127
00:04:49,924 --> 00:04:51,758
Let me do the pilot, please.

128
00:04:51,793 --> 00:04:54,260
Julius,
my boy, sit down.

129
00:04:54,295 --> 00:04:57,397
Julius, i'm not a hard man.

130
00:04:57,432 --> 00:04:59,265
I'm not a mean man.

131
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:03,653
But the television industry is
looking for talent, for quality.

132
00:05:03,688 --> 00:05:06,656
They're preoccupied
with talent and quality.

133
00:05:06,691 --> 00:05:09,158
And the writer
is a major commodity.

134
00:05:09,193 --> 00:05:11,411
Let me give it a try.

135
00:05:11,446 --> 00:05:13,279
Let me give it a whirl.

136
00:05:13,314 --> 00:05:15,782
I mean, let me walk it
around the block

137
00:05:15,817 --> 00:05:17,033
a couple of times.

138
00:05:17,068 --> 00:05:18,284
What about this series?

139
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:20,169
Maybe it's
right up my alley.

140
00:05:20,204 --> 00:05:22,038
Maybe it and me
can go together.

141
00:05:22,073 --> 00:05:22,672
Well, that's the point.

142
00:05:22,707 --> 00:05:25,174
You see, this particular
series and you go together

143
00:05:25,209 --> 00:05:28,294
like the black and tan at an
irish republican army picnic.

144
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:30,930
The series happens
to be about black magic,

145
00:05:30,965 --> 00:05:33,433
conjuring,
that kind of thing.

146
00:05:33,468 --> 00:05:34,684
Now...

147
00:05:34,719 --> 00:05:37,186
what do you know
about black magic?

148
00:05:37,221 --> 00:05:40,306
Oh, ho... oh, ho,
ho, ho, ho, ho.

149
00:05:40,341 --> 00:05:42,191
What do i know about it?

150
00:05:42,226 --> 00:05:45,311
What do i know about
black magic and conjuring?

151
00:05:45,346 --> 00:05:47,196
Oh, come on.

152
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:50,316
I could research it.

153
00:05:52,201 --> 00:05:54,070
Julius, would you leave me now?

154
00:05:54,105 --> 00:05:55,321
Please.

155
00:05:55,356 --> 00:05:58,458
Will you let me
get back to my work?

156
00:05:58,493 --> 00:06:01,577
Oh, let me have a try
at this series, please.

157
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:03,463
Why can't i research it?

158
00:06:03,498 --> 00:06:07,216
Look, mr. Hugo, mr. Hugo,
my career is on the line.

159
00:06:07,251 --> 00:06:09,719
Give me till
next wednesday.

160
00:06:09,754 --> 00:06:10,970
Make it tuesday?

161
00:06:11,005 --> 00:06:12,839
Look, look, in a pinch,

162
00:06:12,874 --> 00:06:15,341
i'll have something
for you by monday.

163
00:06:15,376 --> 00:06:17,226
All right,
all right, julius.

164
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:21,597
Latch on to a couple of books,
knock out a rough draft,

165
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:24,100
and let me have it
by 4:00 monday.

166
00:06:24,135 --> 00:06:25,985
I'll submit it for you.

167
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:29,739
Why, i'll never know,
but i'll submit it for you.

168
00:06:29,774 --> 00:06:32,859
Oh, mr. Hugo, you
won't live to regret it.

169
00:06:32,894 --> 00:06:36,612
And i mean it from the
cockles of my heart.

170
00:06:36,647 --> 00:06:39,749
You're probably
dead right, julius.

171
00:06:39,784 --> 00:06:42,869
And i mean it from
the cockles of my heart.

172
00:06:42,904 --> 00:06:45,371
Oh...

173
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:49,125
thank you, thank you.

174
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,627
You've just
witnessed opportunity,

175
00:06:51,662 --> 00:06:54,764
if not knocking, at least
scratching plaintively

176
00:06:54,799 --> 00:06:56,015
on a closed door.

177
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:58,518
Mr. Julius moomer,
a would-be writer,

178
00:06:58,553 --> 00:07:01,020
who, if talent came
25 cents a pound,

179
00:07:01,637 --> 00:07:03,523
would be worth
less than carfare.

180
00:07:03,558 --> 00:07:05,391
But in a moment, mr. Moomer,

181
00:07:05,426 --> 00:07:07,276
through the offices
of some black magic,

182
00:07:07,311 --> 00:07:09,779
is about to embark
on a brand-new career.

183
00:07:09,814 --> 00:07:12,281
And although he may never
get a writing credit

184
00:07:12,316 --> 00:07:13,533
onthe twilight zone,

185
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:16,652
he's to become
an integral character in it.

186
00:07:49,053 --> 00:07:51,521
...a slider
that broke outside, one and one.

187
00:07:51,556 --> 00:07:53,406
Now tom hallek jogs out
to the mound to talk to sanford.

188
00:07:53,441 --> 00:07:55,274
That might've
been a missed signal there.

189
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:57,160
Hallek seemed to be looking
for the fastball.

190
00:07:57,195 --> 00:07:59,028
The one and one pitch.

191
00:07:59,063 --> 00:08:02,782
Ciccone swings and lifts an
easy fly ball to center field.

192
00:08:02,817 --> 00:08:05,284
Willie mays in
and makes the basket catch.

193
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:07,787
That brings up gil hodges,
one down, bottom of the sixth.

194
00:08:07,822 --> 00:08:09,672
What do you think
about him?

195
00:08:09,707 --> 00:08:10,790
Who?

196
00:08:10,825 --> 00:08:12,041
Gil hodges.

197
00:08:12,076 --> 00:08:15,178
Can you explain how anybody
in their right mind

198
00:08:15,213 --> 00:08:17,046
could get rid of gil hodges?

199
00:08:17,081 --> 00:08:18,931
Well, i, i suppose...

200
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:22,051
suppose that's all
in the point of view.

201
00:08:22,086 --> 00:08:23,302
Precisely.

202
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:24,303
Absolutely.

203
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:25,555
You've got a good mind,
young man.

204
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:26,806
Extremely good mind.

205
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:28,691
Th-thank you.

206
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:30,693
It's the top of the sixth,

207
00:08:30,728 --> 00:08:33,196
the giants are leading
the mets, six to two.

208
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:35,064
Excuse me a minute.

209
00:08:38,486 --> 00:08:39,819
He's out.

210
00:08:39,854 --> 00:08:41,070
Who?

211
00:08:41,105 --> 00:08:42,321
Gil hodges.

212
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:44,824
Now, uh, what
will it be for you?

213
00:08:44,859 --> 00:08:46,075
Well, um...

214
00:08:48,613 --> 00:08:49,829
um...

215
00:08:49,864 --> 00:08:51,714
i'd like to see a keat.

216
00:08:53,618 --> 00:08:56,085
That's a man's name,
not a thing.

217
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,722
And it's not a very
uncommon name at that, keats.

218
00:08:59,757 --> 00:09:02,475
There was a third baseman,
came up from newark

219
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:03,726
played for the yankees one year.

220
00:09:03,761 --> 00:09:06,229
They used to call him
beanball keats.

221
00:09:06,264 --> 00:09:09,348
Held the american league record
two seasons in a row

222
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:11,234
for getting beaned
the most times.

223
00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:13,236
Old beanball keats.

224
00:09:15,104 --> 00:09:18,241
Well, you learn something
new every day, don't you?

225
00:09:18,276 --> 00:09:20,743
Did you ever hear
of a pitcher named slattery?

226
00:09:20,778 --> 00:09:21,994
String bean slattery?

227
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:23,246
Well, i, uh...

228
00:09:23,281 --> 00:09:25,114
there was a
beanball artist.

229
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:29,502
Um, he could hit a batter
when he was still in the dugout.

230
00:09:29,537 --> 00:09:31,370
As a matter of fact,
he did one day.

231
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:33,256
Hit a third base coach.

232
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:35,124
Now, where were we?

233
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:37,009
Well, i, i don't think

234
00:09:37,044 --> 00:09:39,262
it makes too
much difference.

235
00:09:39,297 --> 00:09:42,381
You see, what i came
in to ask about, uh...

236
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,884
well, i wanted
to know if, uh...

237
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:48,020
well, what i have
on my mind is, uh...

238
00:09:48,638 --> 00:09:51,140
what do you got
on black magic?

239
00:09:51,175 --> 00:09:52,525
Black magic?

240
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,645
I'm julius moomer
from television.

241
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,147
Now, what is it
you wanted?

242
00:09:58,182 --> 00:09:59,398
Black magic.

243
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:01,284
Books on black magic.

244
00:10:01,319 --> 00:10:03,786
Oh, i'm afraid not.

245
00:10:03,821 --> 00:10:06,906
I'm afraid
that one eludes me.

246
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:27,560
Ye book of ye black art.

247
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,565
Hey, lady,

248
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,433
do that trick again.

249
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:37,570
This book and i have
never been introduced.

250
00:10:37,605 --> 00:10:39,438
We're total strangers.

251
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:41,941
Here, you want black magic?

252
00:10:41,976 --> 00:10:43,826
You got black magic.

253
00:10:43,861 --> 00:10:46,329
It's been a real
pleasure meeting you.

254
00:10:46,364 --> 00:10:48,831
A real pleasure.

255
00:10:48,866 --> 00:10:50,700
You didn't play third base

256
00:10:50,735 --> 00:10:52,585
for the elmira pioneers,
did you?

257
00:10:53,202 --> 00:10:55,705
How much do i owe
you for the book?

258
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,207
Oh, nothing, nothing,
accept it as a gift.

259
00:10:58,242 --> 00:11:01,961
You're a wonderful ball player
and a credit to the sport.

260
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:04,463
It's been wonderful
having this chat.

261
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:47,640
Va-va-voom.

262
00:11:47,675 --> 00:11:48,891
Za-za-zoom.

263
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:50,259
Va-va-voom.

264
00:11:50,294 --> 00:11:52,762
Ipsy-dipsy.

265
00:11:52,797 --> 00:11:54,647
Va-va-voom.

266
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:06,776
All right, buddy.

267
00:12:06,811 --> 00:12:08,661
This is public transportation,

268
00:12:08,696 --> 00:12:11,781
and there's rules
about bugging the driver.

269
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:14,917
Who, me?

270
00:12:14,952 --> 00:12:18,537
You! Out!

271
00:12:37,807 --> 00:12:40,309
Ara-gatum...

272
00:12:40,344 --> 00:12:43,446
basilitant-ee...

273
00:12:43,481 --> 00:12:46,315
roga-bottom-um...

274
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,069
nordoff.

275
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,578
Hey, julius, what's the bit?

276
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:00,830
What are you doing?

277
00:13:01,464 --> 00:13:03,966
Ah, whatever i was doing,

278
00:13:04,001 --> 00:13:05,835
i wasn't doing it right.

279
00:13:06,469 --> 00:13:08,471
Black magic,
black schmagic.

280
00:13:08,506 --> 00:13:12,224
There's more here
than meets the eyeballs.

281
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:14,727
I done everything it says
and nothing.

282
00:13:14,762 --> 00:13:17,847
Ye book of ye black art.

283
00:13:17,882 --> 00:13:21,600
"Being a step-by-step education
in conjuring."

284
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:27,239
So tell me, faust, to what end?

285
00:13:27,274 --> 00:13:30,109
Cora, i am standing
on the threshold.

286
00:13:30,144 --> 00:13:31,994
L-i mean,
i'm hovering.

287
00:13:32,029 --> 00:13:33,245
One of these days

288
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,999
there's going to be a big
limousine parked down below

289
00:13:37,034 --> 00:13:38,868
with two lizardy coachmen-

290
00:13:38,903 --> 00:13:40,503
liveried.

291
00:13:41,504 --> 00:13:43,372
That's what i mean.

292
00:13:43,407 --> 00:13:44,623
In uniform.

293
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:45,875
And they're gonna
rap on your door

294
00:13:46,509 --> 00:13:49,011
and invite you and
your old lady downstairs

295
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:52,131
for a night on the town
with their boss

296
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:54,016
that eminent,
well-known, highly popular

297
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:56,519
beloved wurlitzer prize-winner-

298
00:13:56,554 --> 00:13:57,386
pulitzer.

299
00:13:58,637 --> 00:14:00,523
That's the guy.

300
00:14:00,558 --> 00:14:03,642
And who you going
to find on the back seat

301
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:06,145
smoking a buck cigar? Hmm?

302
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,647
Modesty prohibits.

303
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:10,533
Just as a point
of interest, julius,

304
00:14:10,568 --> 00:14:13,035
what are you doing?

305
00:14:14,537 --> 00:14:15,788
Don't you dig?

306
00:14:15,823 --> 00:14:19,542
I'm conjuring,
baby, i'm conjuring.

307
00:14:19,577 --> 00:14:21,544
Conjuring who?

308
00:14:21,579 --> 00:14:23,546
Who knows? I just
read this here book

309
00:14:23,581 --> 00:14:26,048
and i got me
all the ingredients

310
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:27,917
or most of them, anyway.

311
00:14:27,952 --> 00:14:29,168
Man.

312
00:14:29,203 --> 00:14:31,670
"Four tufts of feathers
from a falcon"-

313
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:33,556
i got 'em from a pigeon.

314
00:14:33,591 --> 00:14:36,058
Uh..."sand from egypt"-

315
00:14:36,093 --> 00:14:40,429
i still had some in my
sneakers from jones beach.

316
00:14:40,464 --> 00:14:42,314
"Three legs of a spider"-

317
00:14:42,349 --> 00:14:44,183
i found me an ant.

318
00:14:44,218 --> 00:14:47,319
Well, anyway, that
with a few improvisations

319
00:14:47,354 --> 00:14:49,822
i got me a spell working here.

320
00:14:49,857 --> 00:14:52,441
When my mother finds out
what you're doing,

321
00:14:52,476 --> 00:14:54,326
you better conjure up
the army and the navy.

322
00:14:54,361 --> 00:14:55,578
You're gonna need them.

323
00:14:55,613 --> 00:14:58,447
Anyone ever tell you
you were a dirty rotten kid?

324
00:14:58,482 --> 00:15:00,583
Why don't you
take a cold shower?

325
00:15:00,618 --> 00:15:02,084
Go ahead, get out of here.

326
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:04,587
I'll turn you into a frog!

327
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:10,843
Oh, i don't know exactly
what's going to happen

328
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,963
but it better happen soon.

329
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:25,224
Za-za-zoom.

330
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:27,109
Ala-kazam.

331
00:15:27,144 --> 00:15:28,978
Va-va-voom!

332
00:15:33,482 --> 00:15:36,619
Ah, what's the use?

333
00:15:41,909 --> 00:15:43,742
Oh.

334
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:49,999
Oh, man.

335
00:15:50,034 --> 00:15:53,135
What do they think i am,
william shakespeare?

336
00:16:27,036 --> 00:16:28,921
Now, look, pal.

337
00:16:28,956 --> 00:16:31,423
I, uh, i
don't want you

338
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:33,926
to take this
personal, but, uh,

339
00:16:33,961 --> 00:16:35,794
like a guy
should maybe knock

340
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:37,680
when he comes
into a room, huh?

341
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:40,799
I mean, uh, some people
ain't as with-it as me.

342
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:45,187
They take one look
at you and they get a
blast of a coronary.

343
00:16:45,222 --> 00:16:47,056
They get all shook up.

344
00:16:47,091 --> 00:16:49,558
Now, me, i can
handle these things.

345
00:16:49,593 --> 00:16:51,443
I mean, i'm with it.

346
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,002
Give me a stick,
i'll beat it to death.

347
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:19,755
I await your pleasure.

348
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:25,010
Look, look, what do you
want from me already?

349
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:28,897
Prithee, good sir, ask
not what i want of thee

350
00:17:28,932 --> 00:17:31,400
but what does thou ask
of william shakespeare.

351
00:17:31,435 --> 00:17:34,520
Would you try that one again?

352
00:17:34,555 --> 00:17:36,405
It appears i must speak

353
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,907
in the parlance of the time-
your time.

354
00:17:38,942 --> 00:17:42,027
I simply said, good sir,
it was you who conjured up me,

355
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:43,278
and i'm at your service.

356
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:45,781
What would you
ask of me?

357
00:17:52,671 --> 00:17:54,540
Look...

358
00:17:54,575 --> 00:17:57,042
level with me,
pops, will you?

359
00:17:57,077 --> 00:18:00,796
You mean to say that
you'retheshakespeare?

360
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:05,801
Man, you've been dead
a thousand years.

361
00:18:05,836 --> 00:18:07,686
It is true, of course.

362
00:18:07,721 --> 00:18:10,806
But death is relative
and need not be the end.

363
00:18:10,841 --> 00:18:12,691
You required
a service of me.

364
00:18:12,726 --> 00:18:15,194
Hence, i am
at your disposal.

365
00:18:16,445 --> 00:18:20,199
"He speaks, yet
he says nothing."

366
00:18:20,234 --> 00:18:23,318
Romeo and juliet,
act two, scene two.

367
00:18:33,328 --> 00:18:33,962
Quaint.

368
00:18:33,997 --> 00:18:35,831
Decidedly quaint.

369
00:18:35,866 --> 00:18:37,716
A writing machine, perchance?

370
00:18:37,751 --> 00:18:39,585
I presume that is the mission.

371
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:43,972
You would ask me to compose a
sonnet, perchance, or a play?

372
00:18:44,007 --> 00:18:45,841
You have but
to ask, mister...

373
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:47,726
moomer, is it?

374
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:51,480
You...

375
00:18:51,515 --> 00:18:53,348
you mean...

376
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:57,102
you mean you could knock
me out a couple of pieces?

377
00:18:57,137 --> 00:18:59,605
Good sir,
you have but to ask.

378
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,107
What nature of authorship
would you require?

379
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:07,112
Well, um...

380
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:09,248
how about if, uh...

381
00:19:09,283 --> 00:19:11,116
how about if...

382
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:16,121
i'm going to waste
william shakespeare

383
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:18,624
on a lousy half-hour pilot?

384
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:20,509
I got me an idea, will.

385
00:19:20,544 --> 00:19:23,011
You don't mind if i
call you will, do you?

386
00:19:23,046 --> 00:19:24,880
"What's in a name?

387
00:19:24,915 --> 00:19:28,016
"That which we call a rose
by any other name

388
00:19:28,051 --> 00:19:29,885
would smell as sweet."

389
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,770
Oh, man,
what language.

390
00:19:31,805 --> 00:19:33,639
Don't let nobody
knock your stuff, will.

391
00:19:33,674 --> 00:19:34,890
Man, you got potential.

392
00:19:34,925 --> 00:19:36,141
You are loaded
with potential.

393
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:38,026
Here's what
we're going to do.

394
00:19:38,061 --> 00:19:40,529
You and me are
going to collaborate.

395
00:19:40,564 --> 00:19:43,649
What i mean is,
you do the rough draft

396
00:19:43,684 --> 00:19:45,534
and i'll do the polishing.

397
00:19:45,569 --> 00:19:47,402
Now, i'll tell you what.

398
00:19:47,437 --> 00:19:51,156
We'll go slow at first, just
till you get the feel of it,

399
00:19:51,191 --> 00:19:53,659
and then, we'll
do an hour film.

400
00:19:53,694 --> 00:19:56,161
Something with,
um, star attraction.

401
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:57,412
You know, like, uh...

402
00:19:58,046 --> 00:19:59,915
ingrid bergman.

403
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:02,417
Ingrid bergman?

404
00:20:02,452 --> 00:20:05,554
You never heard
of ingrid bergman?

405
00:20:05,589 --> 00:20:07,422
Where you been, pal?

406
00:20:07,457 --> 00:20:08,674
Never mind,
don't tell me.

407
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:12,427
"A comely woman, i take it,
one fairer than my love.

408
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:14,930
"The all-seeing sun
ne'er saw her match

409
00:20:15,564 --> 00:20:17,432
since first the world begun."

410
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:19,935
Solid, will, now
that's the kind of stuff

411
00:20:20,569 --> 00:20:21,820
that's going
to win ball games.

412
00:20:21,855 --> 00:20:23,689
You just start writing,

413
00:20:23,724 --> 00:20:26,074
anything that
comes to mind.

414
00:20:26,109 --> 00:20:28,577
Uh, maybe a twist on
the romeo-juliet thing.

415
00:20:28,612 --> 00:20:31,079
Oh, swear not by the moon,

416
00:20:31,114 --> 00:20:33,582
that crazy moon.

417
00:20:33,617 --> 00:20:36,084
Go ahead, bubbee, write.

418
00:20:38,622 --> 00:20:40,455
If you don't mind.

419
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:44,209
Mind? Will, baby,
i don't care if you
write with your feet.

420
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:47,346
Here, here, i'll move
the typewriter for you.

421
00:20:47,381 --> 00:20:49,214
Give you some ink.

422
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:50,465
There we are.

423
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,351
Go ahead, will, you create.

424
00:20:52,968 --> 00:20:54,853
I'll go make some coffee.

425
00:21:02,978 --> 00:21:04,863
Gilbert and sullivan.

426
00:21:04,898 --> 00:21:06,732
Lerner and loewe.

427
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:09,234
Rimsky and korsakov.

428
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:11,737
Moomer and shakespeare.

429
00:21:19,878 --> 00:21:21,747
What are they saying?

430
00:21:21,782 --> 00:21:23,632
I just asked you a question.

431
00:21:23,667 --> 00:21:25,500
What are they talking about?

432
00:21:25,535 --> 00:21:27,636
What do i look like,
a radar set?

433
00:21:27,671 --> 00:21:30,756
I presume they're
talking about your script.

434
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:34,643
Well, that's the point, honey,
what's there to talk about?

435
00:21:34,678 --> 00:21:37,763
That stuff is poetry,
it's, well, uh, it's...

436
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:40,899
it's shakespearean!

437
00:21:40,934 --> 00:21:42,150
Good afternoon.

438
00:21:42,185 --> 00:21:45,270
Is mr. Bramhoff
in there with mr. Hugo?

439
00:21:45,305 --> 00:21:47,155
We're from the network.

440
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:49,658
Oh, they're expecting you,
sir, go right in.

441
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,412
Yes?

442
00:21:54,029 --> 00:21:55,280
Something?

443
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:57,783
You got a light?

444
00:21:57,818 --> 00:21:59,668
No, i don't got a light.

445
00:21:59,703 --> 00:22:03,422
Look, it just so happens
that you don't know

446
00:22:03,457 --> 00:22:05,290
who you're
talking to.

447
00:22:10,178 --> 00:22:12,047
Bramhoff,
the big-shot producer?

448
00:22:12,681 --> 00:22:14,549
Two guys
from the network?

449
00:22:14,584 --> 00:22:15,801
Oh, man,
i knew it was good,

450
00:22:15,836 --> 00:22:18,303
but i didn't know
it was that good.

451
00:22:18,338 --> 00:22:20,188
It's just something
i knocked off

452
00:22:20,223 --> 00:22:21,440
in a couple of hours.

453
00:22:21,475 --> 00:22:23,308
It's a shoo-in
for the emmy,

454
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:25,811
but i didn't know it
was that important.

455
00:22:25,846 --> 00:22:28,947
That's me, honey, i just
don't know my own worth.

456
00:22:28,982 --> 00:22:32,067
Monday, i knock myself,
tuesday, i knock myself,

457
00:22:32,102 --> 00:22:33,952
wednesday, i
knock myself...

458
00:22:33,987 --> 00:22:35,203
have you got any outside
openings for thursday?

459
00:22:35,238 --> 00:22:37,706
I'd like to make
an application.

460
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:41,076
I don't know.

461
00:22:41,111 --> 00:22:44,212
That's our feeling
too, mr. Bramhoff.

462
00:22:44,247 --> 00:22:47,332
Sponsor-wise, the thing
requires some noodling.

463
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:50,469
That is to say, we can't
abruptly and perfunctorily

464
00:22:50,504 --> 00:22:52,971
jump off the bridge
with this one.

465
00:22:53,006 --> 00:22:54,840
I mean, let's
be cerebral, boys.

466
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:57,092
Well, i'll say
this for it.

467
00:22:57,127 --> 00:22:59,594
It's a beautifully
written thing.

468
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:00,846
It's so archaic.

469
00:23:00,881 --> 00:23:03,348
I mean, language-wise.

470
00:23:03,383 --> 00:23:04,599
May i?

471
00:23:09,639 --> 00:23:13,358
"As fresh as a bridegroom,
and his chin, new-reaped

472
00:23:13,992 --> 00:23:17,112
"showed like a stubble
land at harvest home.

473
00:23:17,147 --> 00:23:19,614
"He was perfumed

00:23:19,649 --> 00:23:22,117

00:23:22,152 --> 00:23:24,369
"he held a pouncet box

476
00:23:24,404 --> 00:23:28,757
and ever anon,
gave it to his nose."

477
00:23:28,792 --> 00:23:31,510
And, uh,
"took't away again."

478
00:23:32,377 --> 00:23:36,131
Well, you've got say
it has imagery.

479
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:38,016
Imagery it has.

480
00:23:39,267 --> 00:23:40,519
May i?

481
00:23:40,554 --> 00:23:42,387
Oh, please.

482
00:23:46,775 --> 00:23:49,895
"And if the boy have
not a woman's gift

483
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:53,031
"to rain a shower
of commanded tears

484
00:23:53,066 --> 00:23:56,151
an onion will do well
for such a shift."

485
00:23:57,402 --> 00:23:58,653
Onion?

486
00:23:58,688 --> 00:23:59,905
Sponsor conflict.

487
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,156
Concur.

488
00:24:01,191 --> 00:24:02,407
Could we make it a...

489
00:24:02,442 --> 00:24:04,292
turnip?

490
00:24:04,327 --> 00:24:05,544
Solid thinking.

491
00:24:05,579 --> 00:24:07,412
Turnip.

492
00:24:07,447 --> 00:24:09,297
Very sociable.

493
00:24:09,332 --> 00:24:11,299
Everybody knows
about turnips.

494
00:24:11,334 --> 00:24:13,802
You say turnip to
the lady in dubuque

495
00:24:13,837 --> 00:24:15,053
she's with you.

496
00:24:15,088 --> 00:24:16,304
I like it.

497
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:20,425
We could call
the writer in now.

498
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,060
A tremendous talent.

499
00:24:22,095 --> 00:24:23,311
A prodigy of mine.

500
00:24:23,346 --> 00:24:25,180
What are his credits?

501
00:24:25,215 --> 00:24:27,065
He was a streetcar conductor.

502
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,934
But a tremendous
observer

503
00:24:28,969 --> 00:24:30,819
of the passing scene.

504
00:24:30,854 --> 00:24:33,321
An incredible judge
of human beings.

505
00:24:33,356 --> 00:24:35,824
You can see that in every line.

506
00:24:35,859 --> 00:24:39,578
A modern-day chronicler
of human foibles.

507
00:24:39,613 --> 00:24:40,829
Solid.

508
00:24:40,864 --> 00:24:43,331
Oh, excuse me.

509
00:24:48,086 --> 00:24:49,337
Send in mr. Moo...

510
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:51,840
how are you, mr. Hugo?

511
00:24:51,875 --> 00:24:53,708
Wonderful.
How are you?

512
00:24:53,743 --> 00:24:56,211
You look fine.
It's good
to see you.

513
00:24:56,246 --> 00:24:58,096
How are you,
gentlemen?

514
00:24:59,382 --> 00:25:01,850
Huh? Huh?

515
00:25:03,718 --> 00:25:05,604
Like literature, huh?

516
00:25:05,639 --> 00:25:07,355
It shows some promise.

517
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:09,224
Mr. Dolan here
represents

518
00:25:09,259 --> 00:25:12,360
the sponsor of
shannon spectaculars.

519
00:25:12,395 --> 00:25:14,112
The shannon food
corporation.

520
00:25:14,147 --> 00:25:17,232
You've no doubt
eaten their products.

521
00:25:17,267 --> 00:25:18,116
Endlessly.

522
00:25:18,151 --> 00:25:20,619
He's a shannon
booster from way back.

523
00:25:20,654 --> 00:25:22,487
Man, like that's the truth.

524
00:25:22,522 --> 00:25:24,990
That shannon onion soup-
this i dig.

525
00:25:25,025 --> 00:25:26,875
We don't make onion soup.

526
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:28,126
That's french in origin.

527
00:25:28,161 --> 00:25:29,995
We're an american firm.

528
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:32,497
Red, white and blue
right down the line.

529
00:25:32,532 --> 00:25:35,000
Man, i am glad you said that.

530
00:25:35,035 --> 00:25:38,753
I always say, if it's good
enough for the lady in dubuque

531
00:25:38,788 --> 00:25:41,256
it's good enough for julius.

532
00:25:41,291 --> 00:25:44,392
Well, let's get down
to some business here.

533
00:25:44,427 --> 00:25:45,644
The tragic cycle.

534
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:52,517
Written by...
julius moomer.

535
00:25:52,552 --> 00:25:53,768
Yours truly.

536
00:25:53,803 --> 00:25:56,905
Read for you now by...

537
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:00,025
yours truly.

538
00:26:04,412 --> 00:26:06,915
"Act one, scene one.

539
00:26:07,532 --> 00:26:12,537
The camera fades on
with a shot of a garden."

540
00:26:16,424 --> 00:26:21,212
Twilight zonewill continue
after station identification.

541
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:38,813
Well, the whole thing
about writing,

542
00:26:38,848 --> 00:26:41,316
the whole bit
is simply that you, uh,

543
00:26:41,351 --> 00:26:43,818
shouldn't get discouraged.

544
00:26:43,853 --> 00:26:45,704
You gotta stay in there
and keep punching.

545
00:26:45,739 --> 00:26:48,206
All the time punching.

546
00:26:48,241 --> 00:26:51,326
As keats once said
to the paris edition

547
00:26:51,361 --> 00:26:53,828
of thenew york herald tribune,
keats said,

548
00:26:53,863 --> 00:26:57,582
"keep punching."

549
00:26:59,467 --> 00:27:01,336
Ladies and gentlemen,
this iscelebrity interviews.

550
00:27:01,371 --> 00:27:03,338
Our guest tonight,
mr. Julius moomer,

551
00:27:03,972 --> 00:27:05,840
that rising
young television author

552
00:27:05,875 --> 00:27:08,343
whose drama production
the tragic cycle

553
00:27:08,378 --> 00:27:11,479
will be seen next week on
theshannon classic playhouse.

554
00:27:11,514 --> 00:27:13,348
Now, a viewing reminder.

555
00:27:13,383 --> 00:27:15,850
Each week
oncelebrity interviews

556
00:27:15,885 --> 00:27:17,602
we bring you the personalities
of show business

557
00:27:17,637 --> 00:27:19,487
who make the headlines
and the stories.

558
00:27:19,522 --> 00:27:21,990
Playwrights, actors, actresses-

559
00:27:22,025 --> 00:27:25,744
all the living legends
of show business as it is today.

560
00:27:25,779 --> 00:27:27,112
How about that, will?

561
00:27:27,147 --> 00:27:32,117
Verily, a most
impressive performance.

562
00:27:32,152 --> 00:27:34,252
Ain't that the truth?

563
00:27:34,287 --> 00:27:36,755
This last question,
now, mr. Moomer.

564
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:38,623
I'm told that
you've been writing

565
00:27:38,658 --> 00:27:40,508
for some period of time.

566
00:27:40,543 --> 00:27:41,126
As a matter of fact,

567
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,628
i think it was
your agent, mr. Hugo,

568
00:27:43,663 --> 00:27:46,765
who showed me some of
your earlier material.

569
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:50,518
You've come a
long way, mr. Moomer.

570
00:27:50,553 --> 00:27:55,523
Well... it's like progress.

571
00:27:55,558 --> 00:28:00,528
For example, one of the things
i looked at was a zombie story.

572
00:28:00,563 --> 00:28:02,397
Now, how about that?

573
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,648
That grabbed, didn't it?

574
00:28:03,683 --> 00:28:05,533
Of course, it was
a bit controversial,

575
00:28:05,568 --> 00:28:07,402
and that's why
it didn't get on the air,

576
00:28:08,036 --> 00:28:11,156
but i always did try
to tackle controversial stuff.

577
00:28:11,191 --> 00:28:13,658
I mean, ugly butchers
and dog dames,

578
00:28:13,693 --> 00:28:17,412
that's all right for chayefsky,
but moomer aspires.

579
00:28:17,447 --> 00:28:20,548
What i mean is,
moomer always thought tall.

580
00:28:20,583 --> 00:28:24,302
There was another
story you wrote, mr. Moomer.

581
00:28:24,337 --> 00:28:26,171
I seem to recollect

582
00:28:26,206 --> 00:28:29,307
that it was a
suggested series.

583
00:28:29,342 --> 00:28:31,176
A kind of
situation comedy

584
00:28:31,211 --> 00:28:34,312
involving a
multimillionaire.

585
00:28:34,347 --> 00:28:36,181
Just plain j.p.

586
00:28:36,216 --> 00:28:39,317
The whole thing there was

587
00:28:39,352 --> 00:28:40,935
we're always seeing stuff

588
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:43,438
about typical husbands
and wives and kids.

589
00:28:43,473 --> 00:28:46,191
Well, why not give a nod
to the-the big shots?

590
00:28:46,226 --> 00:28:49,944
I mean, what they call
the "rubber barons," like that?

591
00:28:49,979 --> 00:28:52,447
I mean,
just because you're heeled

592
00:28:52,482 --> 00:28:54,332
that don't make you unhuman.

593
00:28:54,367 --> 00:28:56,835
Hmm... i may try
to reconstitute that one.

594
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:58,703
Just plain j.p. -

595
00:28:58,738 --> 00:29:02,457
the story that asks the question

596
00:29:02,492 --> 00:29:04,959
"can a man
who makes $9 million a year

597
00:29:04,994 --> 00:29:07,462
find happiness
in a small mansion?"

598
00:29:07,497 --> 00:29:09,964
But you got to remember
one thing.

599
00:29:10,598 --> 00:29:13,101
In order to be a writer,
you got to suffer.

600
00:29:13,136 --> 00:29:15,603
I mean,
i still remember those...

601
00:29:15,638 --> 00:29:18,106
those cold nights
in that dark attic

602
00:29:18,141 --> 00:29:21,226
with hardly enough strength
to push a key.

603
00:29:21,261 --> 00:29:24,979
And all the time, a small
voice inside me kept saying,

604
00:29:25,014 --> 00:29:27,482
"go, julius, go."

605
00:29:28,733 --> 00:29:30,618
So i went.

606
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:35,623
Inspiring, mr. Moomer,
truly inspiring.

607
00:29:35,658 --> 00:29:36,374
Ladies and gentlemen,

608
00:29:36,409 --> 00:29:39,494
you've been listening
to mr. Julius moomer.

609
00:29:43,498 --> 00:29:45,383
That kind of got me.

610
00:29:45,418 --> 00:29:47,252
Like here.

611
00:29:47,287 --> 00:29:50,138
I, too, felt a twinge of a sort.

612
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:53,892
I believe i finished this
last sequence, mr. Moomer.

613
00:29:53,927 --> 00:29:55,260
Oh, good, good, good.

614
00:29:55,295 --> 00:29:56,511
Ah, uh-huh, uh-huh.

615
00:29:57,145 --> 00:29:58,396
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

616
00:29:58,431 --> 00:29:59,647
Oh, will, bubbee,

617
00:29:59,682 --> 00:30:02,150
you got such a
thing with words.

618
00:30:02,185 --> 00:30:05,904
It comes from working
in an attic, mr. Moomer.

619
00:30:05,939 --> 00:30:09,023
A little voice
deep inside prods me

620
00:30:09,058 --> 00:30:11,526
and keeps saying,
"go, william, go."

621
00:30:11,561 --> 00:30:12,160
Hmm? Oh?

622
00:30:14,028 --> 00:30:15,914
Oh, great, great,
only great.

623
00:30:18,451 --> 00:30:20,919
The shannon food
corporation presents...

624
00:30:22,822 --> 00:30:27,175
the tragic cycle,
written by julius moomer.

625
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:33,431
From an original story
by julius moomer

626
00:30:33,466 --> 00:30:39,053
with additional dialogue
by... julius moomer.

627
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:52,200
Man.

628
00:30:52,235 --> 00:30:54,702
It's a good thing
i'm modest, will.

629
00:30:54,737 --> 00:30:58,456
You know, a thing like this
could go to a guy's head.

630
00:30:58,491 --> 00:31:01,576
They're already talking
to me about 2½-hour specs,

631
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:04,712
movie contracts,
maybe a broadway musical.

632
00:31:04,747 --> 00:31:06,581
? a scub-a-dub-a doo?

633
00:31:06,616 --> 00:31:07,966
? i love you?

634
00:31:08,001 --> 00:31:11,719
? put me on the stage,
i'll be a rage?

635
00:31:11,754 --> 00:31:15,340
? scub-a-dub-a doo,
a scub-a-dub-a doo?

636
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:18,726
? julius moomer
will play for you?

637
00:31:18,761 --> 00:31:21,229
? racky sack, i'm flush.?

638
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:27,485
What's the matter, will?
You don't look good.

639
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,736
"Like a strutting player

640
00:31:28,771 --> 00:31:31,239
whose conceit
lies in his hamstring."

641
00:31:31,274 --> 00:31:33,741
Troilus and cressida,
act one, scene three.

642
00:31:33,776 --> 00:31:34,993
In short, mr. Moomer,

643
00:31:35,028 --> 00:31:37,495
you have not been prone
to extend credit where it's due.

644
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:38,746
At no time, for example,

645
00:31:38,781 --> 00:31:40,615
have i heard
the name shakespeare,

646
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:41,249
or, for that matter,

647
00:31:41,284 --> 00:31:43,751
any suggestion
of collaboration on our play.

648
00:31:43,786 --> 00:31:45,003
Now wait a minute,
wait a minute.

649
00:31:45,038 --> 00:31:47,505
Will, baby, look,
we got to play this one by ear.

650
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:49,374
I mean, how's it going to look
if i go and tell them

651
00:31:49,409 --> 00:31:50,625
that a guy
named william shakespeare

652
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:51,876
helped me to write this?

653
00:31:51,911 --> 00:31:54,379
Why, they'd stick me
in a rubber room in a jacket.

654
00:31:54,414 --> 00:31:56,881
That as it may be, the
point is, mr. Moomer,

655
00:31:56,916 --> 00:31:58,132
i finished my task.

656
00:31:58,167 --> 00:31:59,384
I will now take my leave.

657
00:31:59,419 --> 00:32:00,635
Take your leave?!

658
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:02,520
Are you out of your mind?

659
00:32:02,555 --> 00:32:05,023
Why, this whole thing's
coming up velvet!

660
00:32:05,058 --> 00:32:06,641
We're riding
on the gravy train.

661
00:32:06,676 --> 00:32:09,777
You want to creep back into
some crypt and get forgotten?

662
00:32:09,812 --> 00:32:12,280
Listen, man,
you're making the scene big now.

663
00:32:12,315 --> 00:32:13,531
Everybody's always talking

664
00:32:13,566 --> 00:32:16,034
about how my stuff
sounds like shakespeare's.

665
00:32:16,069 --> 00:32:19,153
Will, bubbee, i'm gonna make you
a household word again.

666
00:32:19,188 --> 00:32:21,039
With all due modesty, sir,

667
00:32:21,074 --> 00:32:24,158
the name of william shakespeare
has survived the test of time

668
00:32:24,193 --> 00:32:26,661
without the support
of julius moomer.

669
00:32:26,696 --> 00:32:27,912
You don't dig.

670
00:32:27,947 --> 00:32:29,163
Fame flits.

671
00:32:29,198 --> 00:32:31,666
I mean, who remembers
yesterday's champeens?

672
00:32:31,701 --> 00:32:33,551
Sure, ruth hit 60 home runs,

673
00:32:33,586 --> 00:32:37,305
but it's roger maris they're
always asking for autographs.

674
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:39,807
And nijinsky
was a pretty good dancer.

675
00:32:39,842 --> 00:32:42,310
But who remembers
her last movie?

676
00:32:42,345 --> 00:32:44,178
And will shakespeare
did some writing

677
00:32:44,213 --> 00:32:46,064
but out of sight,
out of mind.

678
00:32:46,099 --> 00:32:50,435
Shakespeare is dead,
long live mickey spillane!

679
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:51,686
Look, look, will, baby,

680
00:32:51,721 --> 00:32:53,571
will, baby, come here.

681
00:32:53,606 --> 00:32:56,074
Look, you can't
desert the ship now.

682
00:32:56,109 --> 00:32:58,576
I mean, what are
people going to say?

683
00:32:58,611 --> 00:33:01,079
That fink shakespeare
got no gratitude.

684
00:33:01,114 --> 00:33:02,697
We can do it, baby,
we can do it.

685
00:33:02,732 --> 00:33:05,833
Look, we got a hundred
projects we can do.

686
00:33:05,868 --> 00:33:07,702
We'll go to hollywood,
california.

687
00:33:07,737 --> 00:33:11,456
Babes out there are crazy
about guys with beards.

688
00:33:11,491 --> 00:33:13,341
I shall ponder it,
mr. Moomer.

689
00:33:13,376 --> 00:33:14,592
Until when?

690
00:33:14,627 --> 00:33:16,461
Until the morrow.

691
00:33:16,496 --> 00:33:17,712
Since you have not seen fit

692
00:33:17,747 --> 00:33:19,597
to invite me to the
rehearsals of our play,

693
00:33:19,632 --> 00:33:21,466
tomorrow i shall
do precisely that.

694
00:33:21,501 --> 00:33:23,351
I shall survey the
actors performing,

695
00:33:23,386 --> 00:33:26,471
and if justice is done
to what i have wrought

696
00:33:26,506 --> 00:33:28,973
perhaps i may remain
for a time longer

697
00:33:29,008 --> 00:33:30,858
and write other things.

698
00:33:30,893 --> 00:33:32,110
Now you're talking,
will!

699
00:33:32,145 --> 00:33:33,978
Now you're talking!

700
00:33:34,013 --> 00:33:37,115
I think i will
take a walk now.

701
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:40,868
"I am that merry
wanderer of the night."

702
00:33:40,903 --> 00:33:47,125
A midsummer night's dream,
act two, scene one.

703
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,993
"To be, or not to be,"

704
00:33:49,028 --> 00:33:51,496
mr. Moomer, "that..."

705
00:34:08,646 --> 00:34:11,149
go to the rehearsal?

706
00:34:11,184 --> 00:34:14,268
How could he
go to the rehearsal?

707
00:34:14,303 --> 00:34:18,022
Will! Will!

708
00:34:18,057 --> 00:34:20,908
Will, don't rock the boat!

709
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:28,783
All right, everybody.

710
00:34:28,818 --> 00:34:30,034
Give me your
attention, please.

711
00:34:30,069 --> 00:34:31,919
Cast, we can walk through
this one with scripts,

712
00:34:31,954 --> 00:34:33,171
but i'd count it
a personal favor

713
00:34:33,206 --> 00:34:35,039
if we could
get these lines learned

714
00:34:35,074 --> 00:34:35,673
by thursday at the latest.

715
00:34:35,708 --> 00:34:38,176
I hate to throw
complicated stage action

716
00:34:38,211 --> 00:34:39,427
at you now at this point,

717
00:34:39,462 --> 00:34:41,295
but you'll note
that in this act,

718
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:43,181
we've got a real problem
of movement.

719
00:34:43,216 --> 00:34:45,683
I want to take most
of this stuff in close shots

720
00:34:45,718 --> 00:34:48,803
and some very rapid, sporadic
cutting back and forth.

721
00:34:48,838 --> 00:34:51,305
I think it'll heighten
the piece tremendously.

722
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:54,692
Mr. Shannon, we feel ourselves
extremely fortunate

723
00:34:54,727 --> 00:34:57,195
to secure the services
of rocky rhodes.

724
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:59,063
Rhodes, schmodes.

725
00:34:59,098 --> 00:34:59,697
I sell soup.

726
00:34:59,732 --> 00:35:02,200
I don't nothing
about actors.

727
00:35:02,235 --> 00:35:03,451
Which one is rhodes?

728
00:35:03,486 --> 00:35:05,953
He's the attractive one
in the sweatshirt.

729
00:35:09,707 --> 00:35:11,075
That's an actor?

730
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:16,330
Well, he was brilliant
instreetcar named desire.

731
00:35:16,365 --> 00:35:17,582
Streetcar named desire?

732
00:35:17,617 --> 00:35:19,467
What was he,
a conductor?

733
00:35:19,502 --> 00:35:23,087
All right, people,
we'll pick it up now.

734
00:35:23,122 --> 00:35:24,088
Scene two, act two.

735
00:35:24,722 --> 00:35:25,339
Uh, felicia...

736
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:29,093
now, remember, felicia,
at this moment

737
00:35:29,128 --> 00:35:31,596
life and death
is waiting for you

738
00:35:31,631 --> 00:35:32,847
out in that hallway.

739
00:35:32,882 --> 00:35:34,098
This is unequivocal.

740
00:35:34,133 --> 00:35:35,983
It is life
or it is death.

741
00:35:36,018 --> 00:35:38,486
When rocky comes
through that door...

742
00:35:38,521 --> 00:35:40,354
uh...

743
00:35:40,389 --> 00:35:42,240
charlie...

744
00:35:43,491 --> 00:35:45,359
uh...

745
00:35:45,394 --> 00:35:46,611
question.

746
00:35:46,646 --> 00:35:48,496
Okay, question,
rocky?

747
00:35:48,531 --> 00:35:49,747
Yeah, i mean,

748
00:35:49,782 --> 00:35:52,867
what is my, uh,
tertiary motivation here?

749
00:35:52,902 --> 00:35:56,621
I mean, like, i walk
through the door and, uh...

750
00:35:56,656 --> 00:35:57,872
i see her.

751
00:35:57,907 --> 00:35:59,123
Why?

752
00:35:59,158 --> 00:36:00,374
Why what, rocky?

753
00:36:00,409 --> 00:36:02,260
What's the question?

754
00:36:02,295 --> 00:36:03,010
Exactly.

755
00:36:03,045 --> 00:36:04,879
What is the question?

756
00:36:04,914 --> 00:36:08,633
I mean, any slob
can walk through a door.

757
00:36:08,668 --> 00:36:10,518
Like, i do it every day.

758
00:36:10,553 --> 00:36:11,769
But, well, now

759
00:36:11,804 --> 00:36:14,889
maybe i shouldn't walk
through the door

760
00:36:14,924 --> 00:36:15,640
at that moment.

761
00:36:15,675 --> 00:36:17,525
So i got
to ask myself:

762
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,393
Would i walk
through that door?

763
00:36:19,428 --> 00:36:24,398
It's on the basis of that answer
that i find my motivation.

764
00:36:24,433 --> 00:36:26,284
So the question is

765
00:36:26,319 --> 00:36:28,152
what's my motivation?

766
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:33,157
Well, rocky, baby,

767
00:36:33,192 --> 00:36:35,042
why don't we just
run through it

768
00:36:35,077 --> 00:36:36,911
and see how it plays,
shall we do that?

769
00:36:37,545 --> 00:36:38,913
All right, folks,
let's take our places now.

770
00:36:38,948 --> 00:36:40,164
Scene two of act two.

771
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:41,415
Right from the top.

772
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:42,667
Mmm, mmm.

773
00:36:42,702 --> 00:36:43,918
Mm-mm.

774
00:36:47,672 --> 00:36:48,923
Mm-mm.

775
00:36:50,808 --> 00:36:52,677
All right, let's go.

776
00:36:55,813 --> 00:36:57,682
I don't care
what you say.

777
00:36:57,717 --> 00:36:59,567
If jeremy
comes here tonight

778
00:36:59,602 --> 00:37:02,069
i have to
go away with him.

779
00:37:02,104 --> 00:37:03,321
Oh, come, olivia.

780
00:37:03,356 --> 00:37:05,189
Cast out those benighted colors

781
00:37:05,224 --> 00:37:09,577
and-and gaze as a friend
on greenwich village.

782
00:37:09,612 --> 00:37:12,079
Let not forever
with your veiled eyes

783
00:37:12,114 --> 00:37:15,199
seek your noble boyfriend
in the dust.

784
00:37:15,234 --> 00:37:17,084
It is common, i know.

785
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:18,953
But all that live must die.

786
00:37:18,988 --> 00:37:20,838
It's easy for
you to say.

787
00:37:20,873 --> 00:37:22,707
Quite easy.

788
00:37:22,742 --> 00:37:24,592
But outside there,

789
00:37:24,627 --> 00:37:27,094
outside this room,

790
00:37:27,129 --> 00:37:28,963
outside this building

791
00:37:28,998 --> 00:37:32,099
is the harbinger of
the worst of fates.

792
00:37:32,134 --> 00:37:35,219
Is it jeremy?

793
00:37:35,254 --> 00:37:37,722
Or is it his killer?

794
00:37:37,757 --> 00:37:40,858
Am i to be a
correspondent of love...

795
00:37:40,893 --> 00:37:42,727
or a recipient of hate?

796
00:37:42,762 --> 00:37:44,612
This is the question.

797
00:37:44,647 --> 00:37:47,114
Who awaits me
out there?

798
00:37:47,149 --> 00:37:48,983
I ask you that.

799
00:37:49,018 --> 00:37:50,234
Who awaits me?

800
00:38:06,634 --> 00:38:08,753
I'm looking for mr. Moomer.

801
00:38:09,754 --> 00:38:11,639
Moomer?

802
00:38:11,674 --> 00:38:12,890
Julius moomer.

803
00:38:12,925 --> 00:38:14,141
Oh, yeah, the writer.

804
00:38:14,176 --> 00:38:17,895
He's sitting over there
with a bunch of guys.

805
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:19,897
Thank you so much.

806
00:38:20,514 --> 00:38:22,400
And your role?

807
00:38:22,435 --> 00:38:25,519
My role is,
uh... jeremy.

808
00:38:25,554 --> 00:38:26,771
What's yours?

809
00:38:26,806 --> 00:38:27,905
Jeremy.

810
00:38:28,522 --> 00:38:31,659
But jeremy is a lad of 19,
fresh as a bridegroom.

811
00:38:31,694 --> 00:38:33,160
And his chin,
new-reaped

812
00:38:33,195 --> 00:38:36,280
showed like a stubble land
at harvest home.

813
00:38:36,315 --> 00:38:38,165
Yeah, well, we changed all that.

814
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:41,919
I mean, a guy that feels love
ain't no 19 years old.

815
00:38:41,954 --> 00:38:46,290
The guy who plays jeremy has got
to know what it's all about.

816
00:38:46,325 --> 00:38:50,678
A mature guy, uh...
who knows the score.

817
00:38:50,713 --> 00:38:53,681
A guy with some 'zazz,
with some moxie.

818
00:38:53,716 --> 00:38:56,801
A guy who understands, uh,
tertiary motivation.

819
00:38:56,836 --> 00:38:58,686
Let's go, team,
shall we?

820
00:38:58,721 --> 00:38:59,804
May we continue, please?

821
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:01,689
Get ready for your cue, rocky?

822
00:39:01,724 --> 00:39:03,190
Rhodes is my name.

823
00:39:03,225 --> 00:39:04,308
Rocky rhodes.

824
00:39:04,343 --> 00:39:07,445
You probably saw me
incat on a hot tin roof.

825
00:39:09,447 --> 00:39:11,315
Cat on a hot tin roof?

826
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:13,818
And what, perchance,
would that be?

827
00:39:13,853 --> 00:39:16,704
It would be a play, charlie.

828
00:39:17,321 --> 00:39:19,206
A real play.

829
00:39:19,241 --> 00:39:21,325
What are you,
a tennessee knocker?

830
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,576
Rocky, let's go!

831
00:39:22,611 --> 00:39:25,713
It's getting so
they let any uncultured

832
00:39:25,748 --> 00:39:26,964
uncouth ham in here.

833
00:39:30,084 --> 00:39:31,969
Go ahead, seymour.

834
00:39:32,004 --> 00:39:34,472
Speak the speech,
i pray you

835
00:39:34,507 --> 00:39:38,225
as i pronounced it to you
trippingly on the tongue.

836
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:40,728
Shall i say it
again, esmeralda?

837
00:39:40,763 --> 00:39:43,230
How's it look to
you, mr. Shannon?

838
00:39:43,265 --> 00:39:44,482
Only great, isn't it?

839
00:39:44,517 --> 00:39:45,733
The play?

840
00:39:45,768 --> 00:39:47,601
Who knows
about plays?

841
00:39:47,636 --> 00:39:51,355
What about the commercial,
where does that come in?

842
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:53,858
R-right after the opening
teaser, mr. Shannon.

843
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:55,743
Are they lighting
the soup?

844
00:39:55,778 --> 00:39:58,245
That comes in the
first commercial, mr. Shannon.

845
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,497
I know when it comes in.

846
00:40:00,114 --> 00:40:02,616
I want to make sure
they light the label!

847
00:40:02,651 --> 00:40:03,868
When the soup is shannon's

848
00:40:03,903 --> 00:40:07,004
i want 40 million people
should know it's shannon's.

849
00:40:15,763 --> 00:40:16,380
Well, what is it?

850
00:40:16,415 --> 00:40:18,883
What's he dressed up for?

851
00:40:18,918 --> 00:40:20,768
U-uh, that?

852
00:40:22,636 --> 00:40:24,522
T-that's my typist.

853
00:40:25,773 --> 00:40:28,893
One of your staff,
moomer, is he?

854
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:31,395
Well, actually, he's a relative.

855
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:33,898
Cousin on my mother's side.

856
00:40:33,933 --> 00:40:35,783
He's a little eccentric.

857
00:40:35,818 --> 00:40:36,650
Eccentric?

858
00:40:36,685 --> 00:40:37,902
Well, he has, like,

859
00:40:37,937 --> 00:40:39,787
you know, delusions.

860
00:40:39,822 --> 00:40:42,289
One week they come,
one week they go.

861
00:40:42,324 --> 00:40:43,908
What about this week?

862
00:40:43,943 --> 00:40:47,661
Um, well, this week, he, uh...

863
00:40:47,696 --> 00:40:50,164
he thinks
he's william shakespeare.

864
00:40:53,167 --> 00:40:54,418
Come on over, will,

865
00:40:54,453 --> 00:40:56,921
i want you
to meet the boys.

866
00:40:56,956 --> 00:40:59,423
Been telling them
all about you.

867
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:06,931
Most impressive.

868
00:41:06,966 --> 00:41:08,182
Would that we had

869
00:41:08,217 --> 00:41:10,684
this kind of space
at the globe.

870
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:11,936
The globe?

871
00:41:11,971 --> 00:41:13,821
Uh, uh, why
don't you

872
00:41:13,856 --> 00:41:15,072
sit down,
will, here?

873
00:41:15,689 --> 00:41:16,941
Have this seat here.

874
00:41:16,976 --> 00:41:19,443
We're, uh,
just going over

875
00:41:19,478 --> 00:41:20,694
the second act.

876
00:41:20,729 --> 00:41:21,328
Act two.

877
00:41:21,363 --> 00:41:23,197
Ah, yes,
the balcony scene.

878
00:41:23,232 --> 00:41:25,082
A most delightful
love sequence.

879
00:41:25,117 --> 00:41:26,951
Love sequence, and
on a balcony, yet.

880
00:41:26,986 --> 00:41:28,836
I was going to mention
this to you, will,

881
00:41:28,871 --> 00:41:31,338
but mr. Shannon asked us
to make a little change

882
00:41:31,373 --> 00:41:32,590
in the love story part.

883
00:41:32,625 --> 00:41:33,841
Oh?

884
00:41:33,876 --> 00:41:36,710
You know,
the business on the balcony?

885
00:41:36,745 --> 00:41:38,345
A thing of beauty.

886
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:40,214
"Oh, spirit of love

887
00:41:40,249 --> 00:41:43,350
how quick and fresh
art thou."

888
00:41:43,385 --> 00:41:45,853
A red-blooded
american boy
and girl

889
00:41:45,888 --> 00:41:47,721
going gigging around
on balconies!

890
00:41:47,756 --> 00:41:49,607
Who owns balconies
these days?

891
00:41:49,642 --> 00:41:52,109
Extremely valid point,
mr. Shannon.

892
00:41:52,144 --> 00:41:53,360
No question
about it.

893
00:41:53,395 --> 00:41:56,480
You mean, no balcony?

894
00:41:56,515 --> 00:41:59,617
Mm, uh, no balcony.

895
00:41:59,652 --> 00:42:01,485
You see, will, this
here is television,

896
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,736
and you gotta
grab the audience

897
00:42:02,771 --> 00:42:05,239
right where they live,
and you gotta do it quick.

898
00:42:05,274 --> 00:42:07,124
That's why we're making
this little alteration

899
00:42:07,159 --> 00:42:08,375
on the balcony thing.

900
00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:10,878
See, instead of the boy
climbing up the shrubbery

901
00:42:10,913 --> 00:42:12,746
to kiss the girl,
he, uh... uh, uh...

902
00:42:12,781 --> 00:42:15,249
meets here in a
subway station.

903
00:42:15,284 --> 00:42:16,500
A subway station?!

904
00:42:16,535 --> 00:42:18,385
That's a bit.
That's a bit.

905
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:20,254
See, she sprains her
ankle, and this boy here,

906
00:42:20,289 --> 00:42:22,139
he's kind of a dr. Kildare,
dr. Casey type,

907
00:42:22,174 --> 00:42:24,008
and he operates on her
ankle right there

908
00:42:24,043 --> 00:42:26,510
between the brighton express
and the bronx local.

909
00:42:26,545 --> 00:42:29,013
You, uh, you see, will,

910
00:42:29,048 --> 00:42:34,018
doctor stories are
very big this season.

911
00:42:34,053 --> 00:42:36,770
All right, cast,
we'll take a short break now.

912
00:42:36,805 --> 00:42:41,275
I want you to run over
that last scene for lines.

913
00:42:47,665 --> 00:42:48,916
Mr. Moomer,
mr. Moomer,

914
00:42:48,951 --> 00:42:50,784
something has to be done.

915
00:42:50,819 --> 00:42:52,036
Troubles, will?

916
00:42:52,071 --> 00:42:53,287
Troubles?

917
00:42:53,322 --> 00:42:55,172
Is that esmeralda?

918
00:42:55,207 --> 00:42:57,925
Yeah. Yeah,
that's the chick.

919
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,927
Well, if what you told me
is the case,

920
00:42:59,962 --> 00:43:01,178
what reason
for her suicide?

921
00:43:01,213 --> 00:43:03,047
What is to motivate
her long soliloquy

922
00:43:03,082 --> 00:43:04,932
about love's labor lost?

923
00:43:04,967 --> 00:43:05,683
Suicide?

924
00:43:05,718 --> 00:43:07,551
What's with this suicide?

925
00:43:07,586 --> 00:43:09,436
Oh, no suicide,
mr. Shannon.

926
00:43:09,471 --> 00:43:11,305
That's definitely out.

927
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:13,807
I was going
to mention that to you, will.

928
00:43:13,842 --> 00:43:16,310
You see, we can't live
with the suicide.

929
00:43:16,345 --> 00:43:18,195
She don't stick
herself with a shiv.

930
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:21,315
Instead she runs away
with this bass fiddler

931
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:23,200
from artie shaw's gramercy five.

932
00:43:23,235 --> 00:43:25,319
That was
my wife's
suggestion.

933
00:43:25,354 --> 00:43:26,570
An inspired
one, at that.

934
00:43:27,204 --> 00:43:29,707
And the brother and father
who burst into the scene?

935
00:43:29,742 --> 00:43:31,959
My wife didn't like that.

936
00:43:31,994 --> 00:43:33,711
She didn't like
the idea of

937
00:43:33,746 --> 00:43:36,213
the father and
the brother, will,

938
00:43:36,248 --> 00:43:38,082
so the way we play it now

939
00:43:38,117 --> 00:43:41,218
the two guys coming into
the room are policemen.

940
00:43:45,222 --> 00:43:46,340
Policemen?

941
00:43:46,375 --> 00:43:47,591
Cops, cops.

942
00:43:47,626 --> 00:43:49,476
And in the scene later on,

943
00:43:49,511 --> 00:43:51,345
where the mother
does all the talking

944
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:53,230
about the blood
on our hands,

945
00:43:53,265 --> 00:43:56,350
well, she's not the
mother no more, exactly.

946
00:43:56,385 --> 00:43:57,601
She's the gardener's wife

947
00:43:57,636 --> 00:43:59,486
who did time
for embezzlement.

948
00:43:59,521 --> 00:44:02,606
But she has the most definitive
line of the play.

949
00:44:02,641 --> 00:44:03,857
In the epilogue

950
00:44:03,892 --> 00:44:05,743
i took it from
twelfth night:

951
00:44:05,778 --> 00:44:06,994
"If music

952
00:44:07,029 --> 00:44:09,113
"be the food of love, play on.

953
00:44:09,148 --> 00:44:12,249
"Give me excess of it,
that surfeiting

954
00:44:12,284 --> 00:44:15,369
the appetite may sicken
and so die."

955
00:44:15,404 --> 00:44:16,754
Oh, fine,
fine, fine.

956
00:44:16,789 --> 00:44:18,005
Appetite
sickening.

957
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:19,873
This is just fine.

958
00:44:19,908 --> 00:44:21,759
The shannon
food company

959
00:44:21,794 --> 00:44:23,627
is paying this
kind of money

960
00:44:23,662 --> 00:44:25,512
to make people sick?

961
00:44:25,547 --> 00:44:28,015
Uh, will, you'd
better get with it.

962
00:44:28,050 --> 00:44:31,769
You're taking the butter
right off the toast, baby.

963
00:44:31,804 --> 00:44:33,520
All right,
here we go.

964
00:44:33,555 --> 00:44:36,640
Let's hear the narration
aloud please, for timing.

965
00:44:37,891 --> 00:44:39,777
On october 30,
the gardener's wife

966
00:44:40,394 --> 00:44:41,645
returned to the crime scene.

967
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,530
The police had already arrived,

968
00:44:43,565 --> 00:44:46,650
and, once again,
the federal bureau
of investigation...

969
00:44:46,685 --> 00:44:47,901
enough of that idiocy-

970
00:44:47,936 --> 00:44:49,153
there's no soliloquy here!

971
00:44:49,188 --> 00:44:50,404
What's going on here?

972
00:44:50,439 --> 00:44:51,655
Who is that guy?

973
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:52,906
I'll tell you
what he ain't.

974
00:44:52,941 --> 00:44:55,409
He ain't no
student of drama.

975
00:44:55,444 --> 00:44:58,545
He runs around all the time
knocking tennessee.

976
00:45:00,414 --> 00:45:03,550
Now, just as a point
of interest... gleep,

977
00:45:03,585 --> 00:45:06,053
what do you got
against stanislavsky?

978
00:45:08,422 --> 00:45:10,924
What have i
got against

979
00:45:10,959 --> 00:45:12,810
this personage
stanislavsky?

980
00:45:14,061 --> 00:45:14,678
You.

981
00:45:21,568 --> 00:45:24,071
"Blow, blow,
thou winter wind

982
00:45:24,106 --> 00:45:27,825
thou are not so unkind
as man's ingratitude."

983
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:31,578
That's fromas you like it,
act two, scene seven.

984
00:45:31,613 --> 00:45:33,080
Hey, will. Will, will.

985
00:45:33,115 --> 00:45:34,948
Hey, wait a minute,
will, wait a minute.

986
00:45:34,983 --> 00:45:36,200
What are you doing?

987
00:45:36,235 --> 00:45:37,451
You'll louse up
the whole deal!

988
00:45:37,486 --> 00:45:38,702
What am i going to
say to them in there?

989
00:45:38,737 --> 00:45:39,953
What am i going
to tell them?

990
00:45:39,988 --> 00:45:41,205
Tell them simply

991
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:44,341
that "foolery, sir,
does walk about the orb

992
00:45:44,376 --> 00:45:44,958
"like the sun.

993
00:45:44,993 --> 00:45:46,844
It shines everywhere."

994
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:48,712
Act three, scene one,
twelfth night.

995
00:45:48,747 --> 00:45:51,215
And you, julius moomer,
foolish mortal

996
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:54,968
who could have covered himself
with a cloak of immortality.

997
00:45:55,003 --> 00:45:57,471
To you, julius moomer
who has succumbed

998
00:45:57,506 --> 00:46:00,607
to the rankest compound
of villainous smell

999
00:46:00,642 --> 00:46:02,476
that ever offended nostril...

1000
00:46:02,511 --> 00:46:05,612
to you, julius moomer...

1001
00:46:05,647 --> 00:46:07,481
lots of luck.

1002
00:46:21,628 --> 00:46:23,497
Hey, julius, for
a whole week now,

1003
00:46:23,532 --> 00:46:25,382
you look like
somebody told you

1004
00:46:25,417 --> 00:46:27,251
to go out and
scrub a lizard.

1005
00:46:27,286 --> 00:46:30,387
He finked out.

1006
00:46:30,422 --> 00:46:32,890
The guy finked out.

1007
00:46:32,925 --> 00:46:35,893
You want
a couple words of advice?

1008
00:46:35,928 --> 00:46:37,761
Knock off the conjuring.

1009
00:46:37,796 --> 00:46:42,149
Get yourself a nice clean safe
job on a streetcar.

1010
00:46:44,268 --> 00:46:46,153
"Whether 'tis nobler in the mind

1011
00:46:46,188 --> 00:46:50,524
"to suffer the slings and arrows
of outrageous fortune,

1012
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:55,279
or to take arms
against a sea of troubles."

1013
00:46:55,314 --> 00:46:57,164
Yeah?

1014
00:46:57,199 --> 00:47:00,667
Did that guy have talent
or didn't he?

1015
00:47:00,702 --> 00:47:02,536
Man! I was on my way.

1016
00:47:02,571 --> 00:47:06,290
They already talked
about my next assignment.

1017
00:47:06,325 --> 00:47:09,426
A 2½-hour spectacular
on american history.

1018
00:47:09,461 --> 00:47:12,429
What do you know
about american history?

1019
00:47:12,464 --> 00:47:14,047
I know this much:

1020
00:47:14,082 --> 00:47:19,052
A writer named julius moomer
died of malnutrition in 1963.

1021
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,091
Za-za-zoom.

1022
00:47:58,126 --> 00:48:01,228
Ala-kazam.

1023
00:48:02,095 --> 00:48:03,347
Va-va-voom.

1024
00:48:03,382 --> 00:48:04,598
Ma, hey, ma!

1025
00:48:04,633 --> 00:48:06,483
He's doing it again!

1026
00:48:07,734 --> 00:48:09,603
Who knows what it means?

1027
00:48:09,638 --> 00:48:12,105
But he's honorable,
if nothing else.

1028
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:14,608
This you've got to give him.

1029
00:48:14,643 --> 00:48:15,242
The what?

1030
00:48:15,277 --> 00:48:17,744
The american history thing?

1031
00:48:17,779 --> 00:48:19,613
Well, frankly, mr. Bramhoff,

1032
00:48:19,648 --> 00:48:22,115
i haven't been able
to reach him.

1033
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:24,001
The fact is that i haven't...

1034
00:48:25,252 --> 00:48:28,372
mr. Hugo, he's outside.

1035
00:48:28,407 --> 00:48:29,623
Who is?

1036
00:48:29,658 --> 00:48:30,257
Julius.

1037
00:48:30,874 --> 00:48:32,759
He's got some people with him.

1038
00:48:32,794 --> 00:48:34,011
Mr. Bramhoff? He's here.

1039
00:48:34,046 --> 00:48:35,879
He's come back to us.

1040
00:48:35,914 --> 00:48:38,382
The boy is coming
back into our fold.

1041
00:48:38,417 --> 00:48:41,518
I told you you could count
on moomer, i just knew it.

1042
00:48:41,553 --> 00:48:45,272
Yes, i'll get back, i'll get
back to you, in a minute.

1043
00:48:45,307 --> 00:48:46,523
Yes.

1044
00:48:46,558 --> 00:48:47,774
Mr. Hugo!

1045
00:48:47,809 --> 00:48:49,643
Julius, my boy,
where have you been?

1046
00:48:49,678 --> 00:48:51,528
The whole week you wouldn't
answer the phone.

1047
00:48:51,563 --> 00:48:53,397
The networks are
screaming for you.

1048
00:48:53,432 --> 00:48:55,282
The agencies
are screaming for you.

1049
00:48:55,317 --> 00:48:56,533
The clients
are screaming for you.

1050
00:48:56,568 --> 00:48:58,402
They want that
american history thing.

1051
00:48:58,437 --> 00:48:59,653
I got it.

1052
00:48:59,688 --> 00:49:00,904
A fantastic notion.

1053
00:49:00,939 --> 00:49:02,155
An absolutely
fantastic notion.

1054
00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:04,041
I'm right in the
middle of it now.

1055
00:49:04,076 --> 00:49:05,909
Me and my staff have
been working on it.

1056
00:49:05,944 --> 00:49:06,543
Your staff...

1057
00:49:06,578 --> 00:49:08,412
not that kook

documented-like, right?

1061

Documented, of course.

1062
00:49:15,337 --> 00:49:17,804
And you want it
real authentic.

1063
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:19,056
Authentic
above all, yes.

1064
00:49:19,091 --> 00:49:20,307

meet my staff.

1065
00:49:20,342 --> 00:49:22,809

A streetcar conductor
with delusions of authorship.

1076
00:50:09,891 --> 00:50:13,610
And if the tale just told
seems a little tall,

1077
00:50:13,645 --> 00:50:16,113
remember a thing
called poetic license

1078
00:50:16,148 --> 00:50:19,232
and another thing
called the twilight zone.
