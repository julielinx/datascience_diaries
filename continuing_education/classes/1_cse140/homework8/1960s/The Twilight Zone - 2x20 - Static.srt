1
00:00:11,046 --> 00:00:13,013
You're traveling
through another dimension

2
00:00:13,048 --> 00:00:16,516
a dimension not only
of sight and sound, but of mind

3
00:00:16,551 --> 00:00:18,518
a journey into a wondrous land

4
00:00:18,553 --> 00:00:20,020
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

5
00:00:20,055 --> 00:00:21,521
That's the signpost up ahead.

6
00:00:21,556 --> 00:00:24,024
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

7
00:00:37,772 --> 00:00:41,741
All right, lance, move away
from the bar.

8
00:00:41,776 --> 00:00:43,243
I've had all i can take of you.

9
00:00:43,278 --> 00:00:45,245
Whatever you say, father.

10
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,248
When you were a boy,
you hated your brother...

11
00:00:48,283 --> 00:00:49,749
your move, professor.

12
00:00:49,784 --> 00:00:51,251
How's that?

13
00:00:51,286 --> 00:00:52,252
It's your move.

14
00:00:52,287 --> 00:00:54,254
Oh, yes, of course.

15
00:00:54,289 --> 00:00:56,256
You are filled
with hatred, lance...

16
00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:59,059
that's my piece,
you're black.

17
00:00:59,094 --> 00:01:01,561
Rebellion of youth...

18
00:01:01,596 --> 00:01:02,562
oh, yes, yes.

19
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,564
You're a man.

20
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:07,067
You're going to have
to face up to...

21
00:01:07,102 --> 00:01:09,069
very good, very good job.

22
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:29,389
Green, green cool grass.

23
00:01:29,424 --> 00:01:32,892
The touch, the smell
of green, cool grass.

24
00:01:32,927 --> 00:01:36,196
Now, brought to you
for the first time

25
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:38,498
in green,
the new chlorophyll cigarette.

26
00:01:38,533 --> 00:01:41,000
The smoke that doesn't smell
like tobacco

27
00:01:41,035 --> 00:01:43,002
but smells good-
green, cool

28
00:01:43,037 --> 00:01:44,904
like grass.

29
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:46,406
Yes, green is brought
to you...

30
00:01:46,441 --> 00:01:48,408
what's the matter
with you, professor?

31
00:01:48,443 --> 00:01:49,909
What's the matter
with all you people?

32
00:01:49,944 --> 00:01:51,411
Are you hypnotized
or something?

33
00:01:51,446 --> 00:01:52,412
Going out of your
blessed minds?

34
00:01:52,447 --> 00:01:54,414
If you don't care
for our program, mr. Lindsay

35
00:01:54,449 --> 00:01:55,915
you can request
a different channel.

36
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:59,419
What difference does that make,
what channel you got?

37
00:01:59,454 --> 00:02:03,223
The new chlorophyll cigarette
can make that statement.

38
00:02:03,258 --> 00:02:06,626
And it's 54, termite jones...

39
00:02:06,661 --> 00:02:08,628
termite jones,
my hero...

40
00:02:08,663 --> 00:02:09,929
termite jones.

41
00:02:09,964 --> 00:02:11,931
He makes it, you...

42
00:02:14,469 --> 00:02:17,937
the prettiest song
in the world.

43
00:02:17,972 --> 00:02:19,439
Isn't that wonderful?

44
00:02:19,474 --> 00:02:24,444
Just ruining it, completely
ruining a beautiful song...

45
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:25,945
? ho, ho, ho, you and me?

46
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,448
? little brown jug,
how i love thee?

47
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:30,950
? ho, ho, ho, you and me...?

48
00:02:30,985 --> 00:02:34,954
If you act now, you can get
your acreage in splendor flats

49
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:36,656
for the fantastically
unbelievable price

50
00:02:36,691 --> 00:02:38,158
of 25 cents an acre a week.

51
00:02:38,193 --> 00:02:40,059
Just look
at this land, folks.

52
00:02:40,094 --> 00:02:43,062
It's flat, it's gray,
it's undeveloped, but...

53
00:02:43,097 --> 00:02:45,064
it's undeveloped, but...

54
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:47,066
it will be
a veritable oasis...

55
00:02:47,101 --> 00:02:48,568
a verit...

56
00:02:48,603 --> 00:02:49,569
an oasis, yes.

57
00:02:49,604 --> 00:02:52,572
Only green, the new green...

58
00:02:52,607 --> 00:02:55,675
oh, yes, let's all roll
in the grass

59
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:58,178
the green, cool hills of grass.

60
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:01,681
25 operators just waiting
to take your call, folks.

61
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:41,421
Hey, mr. Lindsay,
what's that?

62
00:03:41,456 --> 00:03:43,423
That's a radio, boy.

63
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:45,425
Yeah, what's it do?

64
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,427
Don't you know
what a radio is, boy?

65
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:52,532
Well, sure, but i've never seen
one like that before.

66
00:03:52,567 --> 00:03:55,535
No one ever saw one quite
like that.

67
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:58,037
Because that's a very special
sort of radio.

68
00:03:58,072 --> 00:03:59,539
In its day, circa 1935

69
00:03:59,574 --> 00:04:03,543
its type was one of the most
elegant consoles on the market.

70
00:04:03,578 --> 00:04:06,045
Now, with
its fabric-covered speakers

71
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,048
its peculiar yellow dial,
its serrated knobs

72
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,551
it looks
quaint and a little strange.

73
00:04:11,586 --> 00:04:15,555
Mr. Ed lindsay is going to
find out how strange very soon

74
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:18,558
when he tunes in
to the twilight zone.

75
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:24,163
Careful of that door.
That's it.

76
00:04:24,198 --> 00:04:26,165
We're going to take it up
these steps here, boy.

77
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,667
Well, what do you
got there, ed?

78
00:04:27,702 --> 00:04:29,168
What's it look like?

79
00:04:29,203 --> 00:04:30,169
A radio.

80
00:04:30,204 --> 00:04:31,671
Now let's put it down here.

81
00:04:31,706 --> 00:04:32,672
Put it down, boy.

82
00:04:32,707 --> 00:04:34,173
I remember that.

83
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:36,175
I thought you'd thrown it out
years ago.

84
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:40,179
I never throw anything away
that's worth keeping.

85
00:04:40,214 --> 00:04:42,181
Need any help, ed?

86
00:04:42,216 --> 00:04:43,683
Oh, no, no, no.

87
00:04:43,718 --> 00:04:46,185
I wouldn't, i wouldn't want
to disturb you, professor.

88
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:47,687
Pick it up by
the legs, boy.

89
00:04:47,722 --> 00:04:48,688
That's it.
Now, careful.

90
00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:50,690
Take it right. That's
it. That's it, boy.

91
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,191
Right up here.
That's it, boy.

92
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,298
Got to plug it in here.

93
00:04:58,333 --> 00:04:59,299
Think it
still works?

94
00:04:59,334 --> 00:05:00,300
Sure. Course it works.

95
00:05:00,335 --> 00:05:02,302
They made things
to last in those days.

96
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:06,306
That's pretty wonderful,
all right.

97
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:16,316
Go buy yourself a switchblade.

98
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:58,558
And so, ladies and gentlemen

99
00:05:58,593 --> 00:06:01,561
with the strains of
"getting sentimental over you"

100
00:06:01,596 --> 00:06:03,563
tommy dorsey and his orchestra

101
00:06:03,598 --> 00:06:05,565
bid you all
a very pleasant good night

102
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,567
direct from the princeton campus

103
00:06:07,602 --> 00:06:10,570
in a broadcast
of the summer swing festival

104
00:06:10,605 --> 00:06:12,572
and listen to that applause.

105
00:06:12,607 --> 00:06:15,575
But before we sign off,
we invite you to stay tuned

106
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:19,579
for major bowes
and his famous amateur hour.

107
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:29,589
This is station wpda
in cedarburg, new jersey

108
00:06:29,624 --> 00:06:31,591
returning you to...

109
00:06:34,128 --> 00:06:35,294
good evening, friends.

110
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:37,797
Once again, the wheel of chance

111
00:06:37,832 --> 00:06:40,500
or faith, as you please,
is about to revolve.

112
00:06:40,535 --> 00:06:42,502
And as the barker standing
at the wheel of fortune

113
00:06:42,537 --> 00:06:44,504
says, "around, around she goes

114
00:06:44,539 --> 00:06:46,506
"and where she stops,
nobody knows."

115
00:06:48,042 --> 00:06:50,009
Now, does anybody know
what will happen

116
00:06:50,044 --> 00:06:51,511
when these young people...

117
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:58,017
well, what do you want?

118
00:06:58,052 --> 00:07:00,620
I just thought you'd like
to know that dinner's ready.

119
00:07:00,655 --> 00:07:02,622
I ain't hungry.

120
00:07:02,657 --> 00:07:04,624
You know how mrs. Nielson feels about...

121
00:07:04,659 --> 00:07:08,127
oh, all right,
all right, all right.

122
00:07:08,162 --> 00:07:12,031
Ever since i can remember,
women have been running my life.

123
00:07:12,066 --> 00:07:13,032
Now do this, do that,

124
00:07:13,067 --> 00:07:15,034
come to dinner,
don't come to dinner...

125
00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:18,538
frankly, mr. Lindsay, i don't
care whether you starve to death.

126
00:07:18,573 --> 00:07:20,540
I just want to make sure
that it's on purpose

127
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,543
and not because you'd forgotten
that food is available.

128
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:26,446
I'm not that old yet.

129
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:38,858
Mr. Lindsay.

130
00:07:38,893 --> 00:07:40,359
What?

131
00:07:40,394 --> 00:07:43,362
You're humming
at table.

132
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,469
What was that, anyway?

133
00:07:49,504 --> 00:07:50,470
What?

134
00:07:50,505 --> 00:07:53,473
That melody, it went, um...

135
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,480
it's called "i'm getting
sentimental over you."

136
00:08:00,515 --> 00:08:03,483
I heard it on the radio
this afternoon.

137
00:08:03,518 --> 00:08:04,984
That's an old tune,
isn't it?

138
00:08:05,019 --> 00:08:06,986
Yeah, tommy dorsey,
they-

139
00:08:07,021 --> 00:08:07,987
playing it
direct from the...

140
00:08:08,022 --> 00:08:08,988
direct?

141
00:08:09,023 --> 00:08:10,990
Tommy dorsey's dead.

142
00:08:11,025 --> 00:08:12,992
You don't say.

143
00:08:13,027 --> 00:08:14,994
Yeah, he died
a few years ago.

144
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:17,497
What about major bowes?

145
00:08:17,532 --> 00:08:18,998
Who?

146
00:08:19,033 --> 00:08:20,500
Major bowes.

147
00:08:20,535 --> 00:08:21,501
Never heard of him.

148
00:08:21,536 --> 00:08:22,802
No, you wouldn't.

149
00:08:22,837 --> 00:08:24,303
Well, he's dead, too.

150
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:26,806
I heard both major bowes
and tommy dorsey this afternoon

151
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:27,807
on the radio.

152
00:08:27,842 --> 00:08:29,809
Couldn't be.

153
00:08:29,844 --> 00:08:30,810
Couldn't be?

154
00:08:30,845 --> 00:08:32,812
How is it a man
with such a tiny brain

155
00:08:32,847 --> 00:08:33,813
could have such a big mouth?

156
00:08:33,848 --> 00:08:35,314
Now, wait just a minute...

157
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:37,316
now, please,
mr. Bragg

158
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:38,918
i think what
mr. Lindsay means

159
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:40,920
or what he's
trying to say

160
00:08:40,955 --> 00:08:45,424
is that a local radio station
was broadcasting recordings

161
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:46,926
of some of the old programs.

162
00:08:46,961 --> 00:08:49,428
They didn't have tape back
in those days.

163
00:08:49,463 --> 00:08:53,432
No, but they did have wire,
and before that, disks.

164
00:08:53,467 --> 00:08:54,934
I'll tell you
what else they had-

165
00:08:54,969 --> 00:08:56,435
good music,
hmm, professor?

166
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:59,939
Plays that meant something,
magic, real magic...

167
00:08:59,974 --> 00:09:01,440
i doubt it.

168
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:03,442
You doubt it.

169
00:09:03,477 --> 00:09:05,144
Mr. Bragg doubts it.

170
00:09:05,179 --> 00:09:07,146
Mr. Bragg,
who watches television

171
00:09:07,181 --> 00:09:09,649
until his brain
turns into oatmeal

172
00:09:09,684 --> 00:09:12,652
and his eyes roll down his face
into his beer-

173
00:09:12,687 --> 00:09:14,654
mr. Bragg, the modern man,
doubts it.

174
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:17,156
Well, i'll show you,
i'll show you.

175
00:09:17,191 --> 00:09:18,658
Where's that portable radio?

176
00:09:18,693 --> 00:09:19,258
Really, mr. Lindsay...

177
00:09:19,293 --> 00:09:21,260
where is that portable
radio? In the kitchen.

178
00:09:21,295 --> 00:09:23,262
Now, that guy's nuts,
that's all. He's nuts.

179
00:09:23,297 --> 00:09:24,764
Oh, miss brown,

180
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:27,466
you can thank your lucky stars
you never married that man.

181
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:33,072
Now, mr. Bragg,
we'll show you.

182
00:09:33,107 --> 00:09:38,578
We'll just prove it, right here,
right in here.

183
00:09:41,616 --> 00:09:43,082
Well, it was right in here.

184
00:09:45,119 --> 00:09:46,385
I'm sorry,
i can't wait.

185
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:48,888
Gunfireis on
in exactly four minutes.

186
00:09:48,923 --> 00:09:51,891
Gunfire,
we can't miss that.

187
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:59,899
Ed, remember
what station it was?

188
00:09:59,934 --> 00:10:02,401
The station?
No, i, i...

189
00:10:02,436 --> 00:10:05,404
yes, yes, you know,
the announcer said something

190
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:08,908
about... station wpda,
that it...

191
00:10:08,943 --> 00:10:12,912
what can you expect on a dinky
little radio like this, hmm?

192
00:10:12,947 --> 00:10:14,914
Why don't you come up
to my room?

193
00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:15,915
Listen to it on a real radio.

194
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:16,916
Come on.

195
00:10:16,951 --> 00:10:18,417
Come on, professor.

196
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:21,921
Let's go up,
vinnie.

197
00:10:21,956 --> 00:10:25,424
I'd like to hear
that program.

198
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:35,935
Well, it certainly
is a handsome thing.

199
00:10:43,978 --> 00:10:46,746
Can't seem to get it.

200
00:10:46,781 --> 00:10:48,447
Maybe they're having
transmitting trouble.

201
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:50,449
Why don't we phone
the station?

202
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:52,952
That's
a good idea.

203
00:10:52,987 --> 00:10:54,754
That's an excellent idea.

204
00:10:54,789 --> 00:10:56,756
Let's get hold of
information and find out...

205
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:58,758
here, ed.

206
00:10:58,793 --> 00:11:00,760
Thank you, professor.

207
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:10,770
Information, would you please
give me the number of wpda?

208
00:11:10,805 --> 00:11:12,772
That's a radio station.

209
00:11:12,807 --> 00:11:15,775
Wpda, yes, yes.

210
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:17,777
Heard major bowes.

211
00:11:17,812 --> 00:11:19,779
You remember major bowes, hmm?

212
00:11:19,814 --> 00:11:22,782
"Round and round
she goes, and...

213
00:11:22,817 --> 00:11:24,784
and where she stops..."

214
00:11:24,819 --> 00:11:26,786
uh, uh, yes... yes.

215
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:30,790
Oh?

216
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:34,794
Oh.

217
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:44,403
Well, what'd
she say?

218
00:11:44,438 --> 00:11:48,908
Oh, the operator said
according to her supervisor

219
00:11:48,943 --> 00:11:52,912
that wpda had been out
of business for 13 years.

220
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:58,617
Well, maybe you had
some other state

221
00:11:58,652 --> 00:11:59,618
or even another country.

222
00:11:59,653 --> 00:12:02,621
This thing has shortwave,
doesn't it?

223
00:12:02,656 --> 00:12:06,625
Uh, but the announcer said,
uh, cedarburg, cedarburg...

224
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,127
maybe it's...

225
00:12:08,162 --> 00:12:10,129
it isn't listed
in the radio section.

226
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:15,134
I heard it.

227
00:12:15,169 --> 00:12:17,136
I heard it, i know i did.

228
00:12:17,171 --> 00:12:21,140
Professor, is it so impossible?

229
00:12:21,175 --> 00:12:23,142
Impossible?

230
00:12:23,177 --> 00:12:26,145
Well, that's
a dangerous sort of a word

231
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,147
to use nowadays, vinnie.

232
00:12:28,182 --> 00:12:30,149
We take things for granted today

233
00:12:30,184 --> 00:12:35,154
that we called impossible
just a few years ago.

234
00:12:35,189 --> 00:12:38,157
Let's call it highly unlikely.

235
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:42,161
Then what did i hear?

236
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,766
I don't know, ed.

237
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,775
Ed...

238
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,184
professor...

239
00:13:05,219 --> 00:13:08,687
do you really think
he heard those programs?

240
00:13:08,722 --> 00:13:10,689
Well, vinnie

241
00:13:10,724 --> 00:13:13,192
i believe
he thinks he did.

242
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:19,498
Now, we take you directly
to the white house

243
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:23,202
in washington, dc, for an
address by the president

244
00:13:23,237 --> 00:13:27,206
of the united states,
franklin delano roosevelt.

245
00:13:27,241 --> 00:13:32,711
Since my annual message to
the congress on january 4 last

246
00:13:32,746 --> 00:13:36,215
i have not addressed the general
public over the air.

247
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,717
In the many weeks
since that time,

248
00:13:38,752 --> 00:13:40,219
the congress has devoted its...

249
00:13:51,565 --> 00:13:54,033
professor!
Professor!

250
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:56,035
Vinnie! Vinnie!
I've got it.

251
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:59,038
I've really got it.
Come quick. Quick.

252
00:13:59,073 --> 00:14:02,041
Why bother? You won't hear
nothing but static.

253
00:14:02,076 --> 00:14:06,045
Oh, professor, don't encourage
that poor man.

254
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,546
Yeah, but...

255
00:14:07,581 --> 00:14:10,549
oh, he's gone completely
psychological.

256
00:14:10,584 --> 00:14:12,051
Oh, my.

257
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:26,866
Well, i'm sorry, i've lost it.

258
00:14:26,901 --> 00:14:28,868
It was tommy dorsey.

259
00:14:28,903 --> 00:14:31,370
He was playing "i'm getting
sentimental over you."

260
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,873
It was soft and slow,
real pretty.

261
00:14:33,908 --> 00:14:35,875
But i've lost it.

262
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:38,377
Why do i lose it every time
somebody else comes around?

263
00:14:38,412 --> 00:14:40,379
Why, professor?

264
00:14:40,414 --> 00:14:42,281
Well, you just
keep on trying, ed.

265
00:14:42,316 --> 00:14:44,783
We're bound
to hear it eventually.

266
00:14:44,818 --> 00:14:46,785
Sure, sure...

267
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,288
we're, we're bound to...

268
00:14:49,323 --> 00:14:51,790
bound to hear it.

269
00:14:58,797 --> 00:15:00,799
What do you want?

270
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:02,801
Oh, nothing, ed.

271
00:15:02,836 --> 00:15:04,803
I just thought
we might talk.

272
00:15:04,838 --> 00:15:06,805
Do you mind?

273
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,808
No, talk away,
just don't come too close.

274
00:15:09,843 --> 00:15:11,810
I might start
climbing the walls

275
00:15:11,845 --> 00:15:13,812
barking like a dog.

276
00:15:13,847 --> 00:15:15,814
That's what you all think.

277
00:15:15,849 --> 00:15:17,816
"Poor old ed,
he's gone ding-dong."

278
00:15:17,851 --> 00:15:19,818
No, that's not
what i think.

279
00:15:19,853 --> 00:15:21,820
If you'll sit down
and be quiet

280
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,822
i'll tell you
what i think.

281
00:15:23,857 --> 00:15:25,824
Sure, i'll... i'll sit.

282
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:30,329
Right now,
ed lindsay

283
00:15:30,364 --> 00:15:33,332
you're just about
the meanest, sourest

284
00:15:33,367 --> 00:15:36,835
most cantankerous old man
on the face of the earth.

285
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,837
Thanks.

286
00:15:38,872 --> 00:15:40,839
And i'm not
much better.

287
00:15:40,874 --> 00:15:44,343
We've been living
like two hermits

288
00:15:44,378 --> 00:15:47,346
under the same roof
for the last 20 years.

289
00:15:47,381 --> 00:15:50,349
Staring at each other
every morning

290
00:15:50,384 --> 00:15:52,351
day in, day out

291
00:15:52,386 --> 00:15:56,355
20 long years,
wondering what went wrong.

292
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:58,857
I don't know what
you're talking about...

293
00:15:58,892 --> 00:16:00,859
oh, yes, you do.

294
00:16:00,894 --> 00:16:02,861
You know exactly
what i'm talking about

295
00:16:02,896 --> 00:16:04,863
but you won't admit it.

296
00:16:04,898 --> 00:16:06,865
We were going
to be married...

297
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,867
oh, for heaven's sake...

298
00:16:08,902 --> 00:16:10,869
don't get
your back up.

299
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:13,572
I'm not trying
to change anything.

300
00:16:13,607 --> 00:16:15,574
I'm just talking.

301
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:23,582
We met
in this boarding house in 1940.

302
00:16:23,617 --> 00:16:27,586
And it was here
that you proposed.

303
00:16:27,621 --> 00:16:31,590
I wanted
to set the date

304
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:34,593
but your mother was ill,
you remember

305
00:16:34,628 --> 00:16:38,097
and so you
decided to wait.

306
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:40,099
And that's just
what we did.

307
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:43,102
We waited and waited

308
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:49,108
until, by the time
your mother died...

309
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:51,110
it was too late.

310
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,112
Vinnie, i'm not
going to listen to...

311
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:55,114
don't interrupt me.

312
00:16:55,614 --> 00:17:00,119
I've got to get this thing said.

313
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:05,224
Oh, i know you don't care
anything about me now.

314
00:17:05,259 --> 00:17:09,228
I'm just a silly woman
who watches television

315
00:17:09,263 --> 00:17:13,232
dyes her hair, grows old.

316
00:17:13,267 --> 00:17:16,735
You don't even...
like me anymore.

317
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:18,737
And i don't
blame you.

318
00:17:18,772 --> 00:17:21,240
You're a bachelor
set in your ways.

319
00:17:21,275 --> 00:17:24,243
You can't change what you are

320
00:17:24,278 --> 00:17:26,745
and neither can i.

321
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:33,552
We had our chance
and missed it, ed.

322
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:37,056
But i'll tell you
one thing that's true

323
00:17:37,091 --> 00:17:40,559
and i know it's true.

324
00:17:40,594 --> 00:17:42,561
You did love me

325
00:17:42,596 --> 00:17:46,065
as much as a man
ever loved a woman.

326
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,567
Didn't you?

327
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,573
Yes, vinnie.

328
00:17:54,608 --> 00:17:57,076
That's true. I did, yes.

329
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,583
And now you love what we were

330
00:18:04,618 --> 00:18:08,587
what we might
have become together.

331
00:18:08,622 --> 00:18:12,091
So just about this time
every year-

332
00:18:12,126 --> 00:18:15,094
it would have been
our anniversary-

333
00:18:15,129 --> 00:18:17,096
you start getting unhappy.

334
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:20,099
You want to go
back to 1940

335
00:18:20,134 --> 00:18:22,601
and start
all over again.

336
00:18:22,636 --> 00:18:27,606
Why do you think
you keep hearing

337
00:18:27,641 --> 00:18:31,610
"getting sentimental over you"
on the radio?

338
00:18:31,645 --> 00:18:34,113
That was our song, ed.

339
00:18:34,148 --> 00:18:38,617
And those programs-

340
00:18:38,652 --> 00:18:42,621
we used to listen
to them together...

341
00:18:42,656 --> 00:18:45,624
in the dark.

342
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:50,629
I'd forgotten.

343
00:18:50,664 --> 00:18:52,631
When you hear
those programs

344
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:54,633
you're like
a young man again

345
00:18:54,668 --> 00:18:57,636
with all of your life
ahead of you

346
00:18:57,671 --> 00:19:00,639
but it isn't so, ed.

347
00:19:00,674 --> 00:19:04,643
It's all over between us.

348
00:19:04,678 --> 00:19:07,646
We missed our chance.

349
00:19:07,681 --> 00:19:09,648
We can't go back.

350
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,955
You think it's all
in my mind, don't you?

351
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:19,458
You think i'm just imagining...

352
00:19:19,493 --> 00:19:21,460
ed.

359
00:19:53,327 --> 00:19:56,795
Well, portland, here we are

360
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:59,198
Say, the senator's home tonight.

361
00:19:59,233 --> 00:20:03,202
His hound dog is curled up
there under the porch, see it?

362
00:20:03,237 --> 00:20:06,205
Somebody, i say,
somebody knocked.

365
00:20:10,244 --> 00:20:13,212

366
00:20:15,249 --> 00:20:18,217

367
00:20:18,252 --> 00:20:20,219

Delivery boy.

372
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,749
How about a game
of checkers, ed?

373
00:20:50,784 --> 00:20:51,750
Oh, no, no, no.

374
00:20:51,785 --> 00:20:54,753
"Let's pretend" is on in
five minutes, then there's...

375
00:20:54,788 --> 00:20:55,754

376
00:20:55,789 --> 00:20:58,257
Lemonade? Nope.
No, no, no.

377
00:20:58,292 --> 00:21:02,060
Say, what's that funny
looking thing, huh?

378
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:06,064
You know, when i first started
listening to radio again

379
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:09,067
i kept wondering whatever
happened to the picture tube.

380
00:21:09,102 --> 00:21:13,071
The picture tube is right here.

381
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:15,574
Radio. I tell you,
radio is a world

382
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:18,577
that has to be believed
to be seen, hmm?

383
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,799
Where's my radio?

384
00:21:40,834 --> 00:21:42,801
What happened
to my radio?

385
00:21:42,836 --> 00:21:44,803
Ed, be reasonable.

386
00:21:44,838 --> 00:21:46,805
Do you know
anything about it?

387
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,806
Ed, calm down!

388
00:21:47,841 --> 00:21:49,808
Ed, i'll tell you.

389
00:21:49,843 --> 00:21:52,311
Oh, you'll tell me?
I might have known.

390
00:21:52,346 --> 00:21:55,614
Take away the one thing that...

391
00:21:55,649 --> 00:21:56,615
well, where is it?

392
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:58,116
At the junk dealer's.

393
00:21:58,417 --> 00:21:59,418
The junk dealer?

394
00:21:59,453 --> 00:22:03,121
You gave my radio
to the junk dealer?!

395
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:30,749
Hey, wait a second.

396
00:22:30,784 --> 00:22:32,751
What do you think
you're doing?

397
00:22:32,786 --> 00:22:34,753
This is
private property.

398
00:22:34,788 --> 00:22:36,254
Well, this belongs to me.

399
00:22:36,289 --> 00:22:37,255
Oh, no, it don't.

400
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:39,257
We picked this
up this morning.

401
00:22:39,292 --> 00:22:40,759

403
00:22:42,796 --> 00:22:44,763
Oh, uh,

404
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:47,766
That's a beautiful
piece of furniture.

405
00:22:47,801 --> 00:22:48,767
How much?

406
00:22:48,802 --> 00:22:50,268
Ten dollars.

407
00:22:50,303 --> 00:22:53,271
It better still work,
i can tell you that.

408
00:22:53,306 --> 00:22:55,273
Because if it don't,
it's going to cost you.

409
00:22:55,308 --> 00:22:56,775
It's going to cost
a lot of people

410
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:58,276
if this don't still work.

411
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:13,692

416
00:23:34,247 --> 00:23:35,213
Ed, what's...?

417
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:42,320
Vinnie, tommy dorsey

418
00:23:42,355 --> 00:23:45,824

419
00:23:45,859 --> 00:23:50,328

420
00:23:50,363 --> 00:23:54,332

Dear, dear, vinnie.

424
00:24:09,347 --> 00:24:11,349
Around and around she goes

425
00:24:11,384 --> 00:24:13,351
and where she stops,
nobody knows.

426
00:24:13,386 --> 00:24:15,353
All ed lindsay knows

427
00:24:15,388 --> 00:24:18,356
is that he desperately wanted
a second chance

428
00:24:18,391 --> 00:24:20,358
and he finally got it

429
00:24:20,393 --> 00:24:23,361
through a strange and wonderful
time machine called a radio

430
00:24:23,396 --> 00:24:25,864
in the twilight zone.
