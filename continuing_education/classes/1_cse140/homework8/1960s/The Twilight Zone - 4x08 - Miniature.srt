1
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:09,642
You unlock this door
with the key of imagination.

2
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,262
Beyond it is another dimension-

3
00:00:12,297 --> 00:00:14,147
a dimension of sound,

4
00:00:14,182 --> 00:00:16,016
a dimension of sight,

5
00:00:16,051 --> 00:00:18,518
a dimension of mind.

6
00:00:18,553 --> 00:00:21,654
You're moving into a land
of both shadow and substance,

7
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:23,523
of things and ideas.

8
00:00:23,558 --> 00:00:27,277
You've just crossed over
into the twilight zone.

9
00:00:53,088 --> 00:00:55,555
Charley. Charley!

10
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,058
Recess.

11
00:00:58,093 --> 00:00:59,309
Oh, uh, thank you.

12
00:00:59,344 --> 00:01:01,811
I just want
to finish up here.

13
00:01:01,846 --> 00:01:04,948
You trying to make us
look bad, charley?

14
00:01:04,983 --> 00:01:06,199
What do you mean?

15
00:01:06,234 --> 00:01:08,068
Now, just what
do you think i mean?
Forget it.

16
00:01:08,103 --> 00:01:09,319
Come on, we're
going to be late.

17
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:18,461
Look at him.

18
00:01:18,496 --> 00:01:20,330
Little goody two-shoes.

19
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:04,124
Oh, i'm sorry,
excuse me.

20
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:31,651
Now we're going to take a look

21
00:02:31,686 --> 00:02:35,405
at one of the world's greatest
examples of primitive art.

22
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,658
Some of the pieces-
the shields, for example-

23
00:02:38,693 --> 00:02:40,543
are hundreds
of years old,

24
00:02:40,578 --> 00:02:43,046
but some were made
as recently as 1950.

25
00:02:43,081 --> 00:02:45,548
Now, the reason
for this is that, uh,

26
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:49,302
some parts of africa
are still largely unexplored

27
00:02:49,337 --> 00:02:51,804
and, therefore,
unspoiled land.

28
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:53,423
Some natives
in the interior

29
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:54,674
have never seen
a white man,

30
00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:57,560
and they'll live and die
without realizing

31
00:02:57,595 --> 00:02:59,429
the world extends

32
00:02:59,562 --> 00:03:01,431
beyond the limits
of their jungle.

33
00:03:01,466 --> 00:03:02,065
Oh, uh, uh,
by the way,

34
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,316
you know
these natives speak

35
00:03:03,351 --> 00:03:05,185
over 500
different languages?

36
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,436
However, uh,

37
00:03:06,471 --> 00:03:08,688
you ladies of the art
appreciation society

38
00:03:08,723 --> 00:03:12,442
will notice that their art
has a great unity.

39
00:03:12,477 --> 00:03:15,328
Each piece here has been carved
for a specific purpose.

40
00:03:15,363 --> 00:03:18,448
Now, this one...
can you all see it?

41
00:03:18,483 --> 00:03:19,449
Now, this was made

42
00:03:19,484 --> 00:03:21,334
to frighten away
the evil spirits.

43
00:03:21,369 --> 00:03:23,203
And this one

44
00:03:23,238 --> 00:03:26,956
as a protection
against disease.

45
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:31,094
Now, in my hand
here...

46
00:03:31,129 --> 00:03:32,962
i have a pestle,
you see.

47
00:03:32,997 --> 00:03:35,465
And that is a mortar...

48
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:04,304
to the average person,

49
00:05:04,339 --> 00:05:06,806
a museum is a place
of knowledge,

50
00:05:06,841 --> 00:05:09,809
a place of beauty
and truth... and wonder.

51
00:05:09,844 --> 00:05:12,945
Some people come to study,
others to contemplate,

52
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,448
others to look
for the sheer joy of looking.

53
00:05:15,483 --> 00:05:17,317
Charley parkes has
his own reasons.

54
00:05:17,352 --> 00:05:20,453
He comes to the museum
to get away from the world.

55
00:05:20,488 --> 00:05:22,955
It isn't really
the 60-cent cafeteria meal

56
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,824
that has drawn him here
every day.

57
00:05:24,859 --> 00:05:27,327
It's the fact that here
in these strange, cool halls,

58
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,829
he can be alone
for a little while-

59
00:05:29,864 --> 00:05:31,080
really and truly alone.

60
00:05:31,115 --> 00:05:33,583
Anyway, that's how it was
before he got lost

61
00:05:33,618 --> 00:05:37,337
and wandered
into the twilight zone.

62
00:06:11,754 --> 00:06:13,005
Uh, e-excuse me.

63
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,874
Oh, yes, sir?

64
00:06:14,909 --> 00:06:16,125
I guess this
may sound silly,

65
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,377
but how do they
manage that?

66
00:06:17,412 --> 00:06:18,628
How do they manage what?

67
00:06:18,663 --> 00:06:20,513
In there, in
the glass case.

68
00:06:20,548 --> 00:06:24,133
Oh, well... well,
i couldn't say exactly.

69
00:06:24,168 --> 00:06:26,636
I know they use
magnifying glasses,

70
00:06:26,671 --> 00:06:28,521
little tiny tools,
single-hair brushes,

71
00:06:28,556 --> 00:06:29,138
things like that.

72
00:06:29,173 --> 00:06:30,390
But mostly they keep
at their job

73
00:06:30,425 --> 00:06:31,641
until they get
things right.

74
00:06:31,676 --> 00:06:32,892
But how do they get
the girl to move?

75
00:06:32,927 --> 00:06:36,028
Transistors?

76
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:36,646
How's that?

77
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,400
The girl playing
the piano.

78
00:06:40,435 --> 00:06:42,902
Oh, it stopped now.

79
00:06:42,937 --> 00:06:44,153
I don't think i...

80
00:06:44,188 --> 00:06:46,038
i'll show you.

81
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:55,164
She was playing just
a few seconds ago.

82
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,918
It was, uh, uh,
something like this.

83
00:07:04,307 --> 00:07:06,175
? dum, ta, da, dum, ta...?

84
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:07,427
Did you hear it?

85
00:07:07,462 --> 00:07:11,180
Now, look, mister,
i don't like jokes-

86
00:07:11,215 --> 00:07:13,065
not when i'm on duty,
anyway.

87
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,934
Oh, i'm not joking.

88
00:07:14,969 --> 00:07:16,185
Well, then you're
hearing things.

89
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:19,322
There isn't any sound mechanism
in that piano,

90
00:07:19,357 --> 00:07:21,824
and the doll was carved
out of wood,

91
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:23,693
a single block
of wood.

92
00:07:23,728 --> 00:07:25,578
Now who's joking?

93
00:07:25,613 --> 00:07:27,079
See for yourself.

94
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:46,098
Well, i'm, uh, sorry.

95
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:47,967
I could have sworn...

96
00:07:48,002 --> 00:07:51,103
probably some kid
with one of those pocket radios.

97
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:53,606
They sneak them in
once in a while.

98
00:07:53,641 --> 00:07:55,475
But i saw her move.

99
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:57,977
At least, i think i did.

100
00:07:58,012 --> 00:07:59,862
You know better now, don't you?

101
00:07:59,897 --> 00:08:01,731
Yes, i know better now.

102
00:08:02,365 --> 00:08:05,485
Thank you. Uh, i'm sorry
to have bothered you.

103
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,736
No bother.

104
00:08:06,771 --> 00:08:09,872
You're feeling all right now,
aren't you?

105
00:08:09,907 --> 00:08:11,741
Yes, uh...

106
00:08:11,776 --> 00:08:13,626
just a little embarrassed.

107
00:08:13,661 --> 00:08:15,995
Well, is there anything
i can do for you?

108
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:19,749
Uh, no, i have to
be getting back...

109
00:08:19,784 --> 00:08:22,251
oh, well, thanks
for your time.

110
00:08:22,286 --> 00:08:24,136
Don't mention it.

111
00:09:11,434 --> 00:09:13,302
Come in.

112
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,061
Sit down, mr. Parkes.

113
00:09:22,096 --> 00:09:23,946
I'm sorry i'm
late, sir.

114
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:26,449
Well, i'm sure you have
a good excuse.

115
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,569
Well, no, sir, i don't.

116
00:09:31,454 --> 00:09:33,322
I just let the time slip by.

117
00:09:33,357 --> 00:09:35,207
I... i don't know
how it happened.

118
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:37,710
You know, parkes,

119
00:09:37,745 --> 00:09:40,212
this is the first sign
of humanity you've shown

120
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:42,081
in almost four years.

121
00:09:42,116 --> 00:09:43,966
I beg pardon?

122
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:45,835
Well, up until now,
you've come and gone

123
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,086
like some kind of wind-up toy.

124
00:09:47,121 --> 00:09:48,337
You're never early.
You're never late.

125
00:09:48,372 --> 00:09:50,840
You're always keeping
to yourself.

126
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:53,342
Don't you like us, parkes?

127
00:09:53,377 --> 00:09:56,479
Uh, well, i never thought
about it, sir.

128
00:09:56,514 --> 00:09:58,347
Well, think about it now.

129
00:10:03,486 --> 00:10:05,988
Do you like
your fellow workers?

130
00:10:06,023 --> 00:10:08,858
Well, i suppose so.

131
00:10:11,994 --> 00:10:13,863
You suppose so?

132
00:10:13,898 --> 00:10:18,501
Well... i never thought
about it, sir.

133
00:10:18,536 --> 00:10:20,369
I don't dislike them.

134
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:24,256
You know, i'm afraid,
mr. Parkes,

135
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:27,376
that isn't good enough.

136
00:10:27,411 --> 00:10:30,513
An office, uh,
is like a team,

137
00:10:30,548 --> 00:10:32,381
a platoon.

138
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:34,266
Either it works together
or it doesn't.

139
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:38,020
Here, it doesn't,
and the reason is you.

140
00:10:38,055 --> 00:10:41,140
I knew you were a square peg
when i hired you,

141
00:10:41,175 --> 00:10:42,391
but you were bright,

142
00:10:42,426 --> 00:10:44,894
and well, i thought
we'd wear those edges off.

143
00:10:44,929 --> 00:10:48,030
We haven't.
None of them.

144
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:51,784
You're still a square peg.

145
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:53,035
You understand me?

146
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:57,406
Yes, sir, i think i do.

147
00:10:57,441 --> 00:11:00,543
I was going to use the excuse
of your being late, but i can't.

148
00:11:00,578 --> 00:11:03,045
The fact is
that i'm letting you go

149
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,914
because you just don't
fit in.

150
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,804
I understand, sir.

151
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,673
Uh, parkes.

152
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:15,558
Yes, sir?

153
00:11:15,593 --> 00:11:18,561
I know this isn't
any of my business, but...

154
00:11:18,596 --> 00:11:20,429
don't you think it's about time

155
00:11:20,464 --> 00:11:21,681
you gave up living
with your mother?

156
00:11:21,716 --> 00:11:24,183
Well, she needs me.

157
00:11:24,218 --> 00:11:26,068
Why? Is she ill?

158
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:28,571
No, not actually ill.

159
00:11:28,606 --> 00:11:31,073
You see, my father died
some time ago,

160
00:11:31,108 --> 00:11:32,942
and my sister's married,
and, uh...

161
00:11:32,977 --> 00:11:34,827
well, she needs me.

162
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:36,696
I see.

163
00:11:36,731 --> 00:11:38,581
Well, you're welcome to stay on
a few weeks if...

164
00:11:38,616 --> 00:11:41,701
uh, no, sir, that's very nice
of you, but i'll manage.

165
00:11:41,736 --> 00:11:42,702
Thank you.

166
00:11:42,737 --> 00:11:45,204
You can pick up
your check tomorrow.

167
00:11:45,239 --> 00:11:46,455
Thank you.

168
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,712
He had no right.

169
00:11:52,747 --> 00:11:55,214
He had every right,
mother.

170
00:11:55,249 --> 00:11:57,717
Hiring and firing people
is his job.

171
00:11:57,752 --> 00:11:59,602
But why you?

172
00:11:59,637 --> 00:12:02,471
I told you;
he didn't think i fit in.

173
00:12:03,105 --> 00:12:04,356
What's that mean?

174
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:08,110
It has something to do
with being on the team.

175
00:12:08,611 --> 00:12:09,862
That's ridiculous.

176
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,864
What are
you going to do?

177
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:12,481
I'm going to
phone that man

178
00:12:12,516 --> 00:12:13,733
and find out
just why

179
00:12:13,768 --> 00:12:14,984
you're being
persecuted.

180
00:12:15,019 --> 00:12:16,235
Mother, please don't.

181
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:18,738
It won't do any good.

182
00:12:18,773 --> 00:12:21,874
Oh, charley,
what's going to
become of you?

183
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:24,994
I've worked so hard
trying to bring
you up right.

184
00:12:25,029 --> 00:12:26,879
What have i
done wrong?

185
00:12:26,914 --> 00:12:29,381
Have i been
too strict?

186
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:29,999
No, mother.

187
00:12:30,034 --> 00:12:31,884
Or too lenient?

188
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:32,501
Maybe that's it.

189
00:12:32,536 --> 00:12:34,386
Maybe if i'd let your
father punish you

190
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:36,889
the way he wanted to.

191
00:12:36,924 --> 00:12:38,758
It's all right, mother.

192
00:12:38,793 --> 00:12:41,260
It's just a minor setback.

193
00:12:41,295 --> 00:12:44,396
Oh, you say
that every time.

194
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:47,516
Why can't you
keep a job, son?

195
00:12:47,551 --> 00:12:48,768
Why do you
always end up

196
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:50,653
making everyone
feel uncomfortable

197
00:12:50,688 --> 00:12:52,521
around you?

198
00:12:52,556 --> 00:12:54,406
I don't know.

199
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:56,275
I suppose
they blame me.

200
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:58,778
Well, i'm not
keeping you here.

201
00:12:58,813 --> 00:13:01,280
You're free to go.

202
00:13:01,315 --> 00:13:02,531
I know that, mother.

203
00:13:02,566 --> 00:13:03,783
Nothing in the world

204
00:13:03,818 --> 00:13:05,034
would make
me happier

205
00:13:05,069 --> 00:13:06,285
than to see
you settle down

206
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,170
with a nice girl,
raise a family

207
00:13:08,205 --> 00:13:10,039
and live a
normal life.

208
00:13:10,673 --> 00:13:13,175
Please, don't cry.

209
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,678
I can't help it.

210
00:13:15,713 --> 00:13:18,798
I hate to see
you hurt, son.

211
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:19,431
I'm not hurt.

212
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,300
Well, you should be.

213
00:13:21,335 --> 00:13:22,551
Getting fired.

214
00:13:22,586 --> 00:13:25,054
It would have
killed your father.

215
00:13:25,089 --> 00:13:28,190
It would have
killed him.

216
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:31,310
I'll go to the employment
bureau tomorrow.

217
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,315
Where are
you going?

218
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:37,566
To my room.

219
00:13:37,601 --> 00:13:38,818
Charley, will you
please bring me

220
00:13:38,853 --> 00:13:41,320
my heart
medicine, dear?

221
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:49,461
Charley, whywereyou late
getting back to the office?

222
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,832
I was, uh, detained.

223
00:13:52,867 --> 00:13:55,334
What's that
supposed to mean?

224
00:13:55,369 --> 00:13:59,088
Nothing. I was detained,
that's all.

225
00:13:59,123 --> 00:14:01,590
Charley, do you
feel all right?

226
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:03,475
Yes, mother.

227
00:14:26,749 --> 00:14:28,617
What's that
you're whistling?

228
00:14:28,652 --> 00:14:29,869
Pardon?

229
00:14:29,904 --> 00:14:31,754
You were whistling.
What was it?

230
00:14:31,789 --> 00:14:36,125
Uh, i don't remember.

231
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:38,627
Mother!

232
00:14:38,662 --> 00:14:40,512
Now, you lie
down, charley,

233
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:42,381
and take a
little nap.

234
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:44,884
All right.

235
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,889
Mother, please.

236
00:14:49,924 --> 00:14:53,025
Why? I'm only trying to help.

237
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,393
I know it, mother,
and i appreciate it,

238
00:14:54,428 --> 00:14:56,896
but i prefer to untie
my own shoes.

239
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:02,651
I'll bring you some cocoa.

240
00:15:02,686 --> 00:15:04,153
Thank you.

241
00:15:58,590 --> 00:15:59,842
Back again, huh?

242
00:15:59,877 --> 00:16:01,710
Yes.

243
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:06,668
Charley, your
breakfast is
getting cold.

244
00:18:06,703 --> 00:18:07,302
You see?

245
00:18:07,337 --> 00:18:09,171
Late for his meals,

246
00:18:09,206 --> 00:18:10,422
awake every night
tossing and turning.

247
00:18:10,457 --> 00:18:13,559
I tell you, i'm half
dead from worry.

248
00:18:13,594 --> 00:18:14,810
Mama...
he's sick.

249
00:18:14,845 --> 00:18:15,427
I know he is.

250
00:18:15,462 --> 00:18:17,312
Sounds to me like
he's got himself a girl.

251
00:18:17,347 --> 00:18:17,930
Don't be silly.

252
00:18:17,965 --> 00:18:19,181
What's so silly
about it?

253
00:18:19,216 --> 00:18:20,432
I mean, charley's
a good-looking guy.

254
00:18:20,467 --> 00:18:22,935
A little peculiar,
maybe, but, uh...

255
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:25,571
i only meant if he had a girl,
he'd tell me.

256
00:18:25,606 --> 00:18:26,822
Isn't that right, myra?

257
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:28,690
Sure.

258
00:18:28,725 --> 00:18:31,193
And he hasn't told me,
so it's not possible.

259
00:18:31,228 --> 00:18:32,444
Okay, okay.

260
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:34,580
I'm not one of those mothers
who try

261
00:18:34,615 --> 00:18:36,448
to keep their children
with them all the time.

262
00:18:36,483 --> 00:18:37,082
Ask myra.

263
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,838
Pass the
butter, please.

264
00:18:42,873 --> 00:18:43,705
Charley!

265
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:47,459
Your breakfast is
on the table getting cold.

266
00:18:47,494 --> 00:18:49,344
I'm sorry.

267
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:51,213
Hey, hiya,
charley boy.

268
00:18:51,248 --> 00:18:53,098
Hello, buddy,
how are you?

269
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:54,967
Couldn't be better, buddy,
couldn't be better.

270
00:18:55,002 --> 00:18:56,852
Myra, you're
looking good.

271
00:18:56,887 --> 00:18:59,972
Well, i wish i could say
the same for you, charley.

272
00:19:00,007 --> 00:19:03,725
I haven't been
sleeping too well.

273
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,228
Because of what,
the job?

274
00:19:06,263 --> 00:19:09,231
Yes, i suppose so.

275
00:19:09,266 --> 00:19:10,732
It's been terribly hard on him

276
00:19:10,767 --> 00:19:12,618
walking around every day
in the hot sun.

277
00:19:12,653 --> 00:19:14,987
Boy, that can
get you down.

278
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:17,489
Charley...

279
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:19,491
yes?

280
00:19:19,526 --> 00:19:22,628
We've got
a surprise for you.

281
00:19:22,663 --> 00:19:24,246
Tell him, bud.

282
00:19:24,281 --> 00:19:25,497
Well, it's like this,
charley.

283
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:27,382
I heard about them
giving you the roust.

284
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:28,634
I mean, you know...

285
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:31,887
and, uh, like, i know
the head dispatcher

286
00:19:31,922 --> 00:19:33,138
pretty well
over where i work.

287
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:34,389
And i talked to him
about you,

288
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:36,892
and he said, uh...

289
00:19:40,797 --> 00:19:42,648
well, he said he'd
give you the job!

290
00:19:42,683 --> 00:19:43,265
Yeah.

291
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,767
Isn't that wonderful?

292
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:51,023
Charley.

293
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:57,412
That's very nice of you,
buddy, really.

294
00:19:57,447 --> 00:19:59,781
Well, you've had
experience in billing,

295
00:19:59,816 --> 00:20:01,667
haven't you, charley?

296
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:02,534
Yes.

297
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:04,419
Well, then what?

298
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:08,173
Well, l-i don't think i really
want to travel that far.

299
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,676
It's out of the city, isn't it?

300
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:13,045
Well, buddy
can pick you up

301
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,296
and bring you home.

302
00:20:14,331 --> 00:20:17,432
Sure. Until you get
your own car, anyway.

303
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,185
Charley,
for heaven's sake,

304
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,803
don't just sit there.

305
00:20:21,838 --> 00:20:24,306
Buddy's offering you a job.

306
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:26,942
I'm sorry.

307
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:38,704
I appreciate
it, really,

308
00:20:38,739 --> 00:20:41,206
uh, but i'm
afraid i can't.

309
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:43,325
You got something
better?

310
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,076
Yes.

311
00:20:44,111 --> 00:20:45,961
Charley.

312
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:48,714
Charley!

313
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:58,090
Good morning.

314
00:20:58,125 --> 00:20:59,975
My mother says
that breakfast

315
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:03,095
is the most important meal
of the day.

316
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:04,346
Have i told you about my mother?

317
00:21:04,381 --> 00:21:06,481
She's, uh, very nice.

318
00:21:06,516 --> 00:21:10,235
Of course, she still
treats me like a child,

319
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:13,605
but you can't blame her,
because i'm all she has.

320
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,108
I suppose
that's not very much.

321
00:21:24,499 --> 00:21:26,118
Of course, it isn't
any of my business,

322
00:21:26,153 --> 00:21:27,369
but i really do think

323
00:21:27,404 --> 00:21:29,254
you should eat more than that
for breakfast.

324
00:21:32,507 --> 00:21:36,378
Oh, you know,
i have a sister about your age.

325
00:21:36,413 --> 00:21:37,629
Her name's myra.

326
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:39,514
She's nice, too.

327
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:41,883
Her husband says
she's very pretty,

328
00:21:41,918 --> 00:21:43,769
but she's not as
pretty as you are.

329
00:21:43,804 --> 00:21:46,888
I guess you're
about the prettiest girl

330
00:21:46,923 --> 00:21:48,140
in the whole world.

331
00:21:48,175 --> 00:21:49,141
I don't mind
saying that

332
00:21:49,176 --> 00:21:51,026
because i know
you can't hear me.

333
00:21:51,061 --> 00:21:53,779
But i think i'd say it
even if you could,

334
00:21:53,814 --> 00:21:55,647
because...

335
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:02,654
hi.

336
00:22:02,689 --> 00:22:04,539
Little early today,
aren't you?

337
00:22:04,574 --> 00:22:05,791
Yes.

338
00:22:05,826 --> 00:22:08,910
I guess you must get a real kick
out of some of these displays.

339
00:22:08,945 --> 00:22:10,796
Oh, yes, l-i...

340
00:22:10,831 --> 00:22:13,298
this one here
in particular.

341
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:15,167
What do you see, mister?

342
00:22:15,202 --> 00:22:17,052
Oh, nothing.

343
00:22:17,087 --> 00:22:18,920
A man doesn't stand
for four or five hours

344
00:22:18,955 --> 00:22:20,172
at a stretch
looking at nothing.

345
00:22:20,207 --> 00:22:22,674
Well, i'm not breaking
any rules, am i?

346
00:22:22,709 --> 00:22:23,925
No.

347
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:28,313
Then, uh...
leave me alone, please.

348
00:22:28,348 --> 00:22:32,684
Well... all right.

349
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:46,591
Good morning.

350
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:53,231
That's a new dress,
isn't it?

351
00:23:53,266 --> 00:23:55,600
I haven't seen it before.

352
00:23:55,635 --> 00:23:58,103
Can i help you, miss?

353
00:23:58,138 --> 00:24:00,605
Oh, no. Thank you.

354
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,998
Charley?

355
00:24:10,033 --> 00:24:11,867
Oh, hello, myra.

356
00:24:11,902 --> 00:24:13,752
What are you
doing here?

357
00:24:13,787 --> 00:24:16,755
I was just passing by
and i saw you come in.

358
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,006
That's nice.

359
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:19,257
Buy me a cup of coffee?

360
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:22,377
Well, the
cafeteria's closed.

361
00:24:22,412 --> 00:24:24,262
Well, we could go
somewhere else.

362
00:24:25,514 --> 00:24:26,765
All right.

363
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:40,529
Thank you.

364
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:51,790
Charley, i want
to be honest with you.

365
00:24:51,825 --> 00:24:54,292
I didn't just...

366
00:24:54,327 --> 00:24:56,795
happen to... to see you.

367
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:57,412
I followed you.

368
00:24:58,046 --> 00:24:59,414
Why?

369
00:24:59,449 --> 00:25:01,299
Because mama
asked me to.

370
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:04,419
She's been worried about you,
charley, and so have i.

371
00:25:04,454 --> 00:25:06,922
You haven't been yourself
lately.

372
00:25:06,957 --> 00:25:09,424
No, i suppose i haven't.

373
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:13,178
Do you go to that place
every day?

374
00:25:13,213 --> 00:25:15,680
Yes.

375
00:25:15,715 --> 00:25:18,817
I thought it might be
a good idea to improve my mind.

376
00:25:18,852 --> 00:25:21,319
That isn't why.

377
00:25:21,354 --> 00:25:21,937
No?

378
00:25:22,571 --> 00:25:23,822
No.

379
00:25:23,857 --> 00:25:26,942
I'm your sister, charley.

380
00:25:26,977 --> 00:25:30,078
I grew up with you,
and i know you.

381
00:25:30,113 --> 00:25:32,581
And i love you.

382
00:25:32,616 --> 00:25:35,700
You go there because it gives
you a chance to be alone,

383
00:25:35,735 --> 00:25:39,454
and you want to be alone
because you're scared.

384
00:25:39,489 --> 00:25:40,705
Myra...

385
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:41,957
charley, listen to me.

386
00:25:41,992 --> 00:25:43,842
This is important.

387
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:46,962
You're over 30 years old,

388
00:25:46,997 --> 00:25:49,464
and you're living exactly
the way you did

389
00:25:49,499 --> 00:25:51,967
when you were 14.

390
00:25:52,002 --> 00:25:55,103
Well, some of it's
mama's fault...

391
00:25:55,138 --> 00:25:56,972
but some of it's yours.

392
00:25:57,007 --> 00:26:00,725
And it's not natural,
charley.

393
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,977
It's sick.

394
00:26:02,012 --> 00:26:04,479
Andyou know
it's sick,

395
00:26:04,514 --> 00:26:06,481
and that's why
you're scared.

396
00:26:06,516 --> 00:26:08,984
You're probably right.

397
00:26:09,019 --> 00:26:12,120
Charley, stop agreeing
with me!

398
00:26:12,155 --> 00:26:13,989
You agree with me all...

399
00:26:14,024 --> 00:26:14,623
all the time.

400
00:26:14,658 --> 00:26:15,874
I could say you were

401
00:26:15,909 --> 00:26:17,125
a blue monkey,
and you'd agree.

402
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,243
No.

403
00:26:18,278 --> 00:26:19,494
Look, charley,

404
00:26:19,529 --> 00:26:22,631
i don't know anything
about psychology

405
00:26:22,666 --> 00:26:24,499
or anything like that,

406
00:26:24,534 --> 00:26:28,253
but i think i know
what's the matter with you.

407
00:26:32,641 --> 00:26:34,509
You need a girl.

408
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:38,897
You're at that time
of life.

409
00:26:40,148 --> 00:26:42,017
You know what i mean?

410
00:26:42,052 --> 00:26:43,902
Well, not exactly.

411
00:26:47,656 --> 00:26:49,524
Well, uh...

412
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:54,529
it's a little difficult
to explain, um...

413
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,283
but you've never had a girl,
have you, have you, charley?

414
00:27:00,168 --> 00:27:02,671
Well, not actually.

415
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,173
That's what i thought.

416
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:11,429
Well... we are going to change
all of that.

417
00:27:11,464 --> 00:27:12,047
How?

418
00:27:12,082 --> 00:27:13,932
I am going
to introduce you

419
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:14,933
to harriet gunderson.

420
00:27:14,968 --> 00:27:17,435
She's a girl
who works in my office,

421
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:18,687
and she's
a real swell kid.

422
00:27:18,722 --> 00:27:19,938
You'll like her,
charley, really.

423
00:27:19,973 --> 00:27:21,189
Myra...

424
00:27:21,224 --> 00:27:22,440
oh, please, charley?

425
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:24,309
Just this one time.

426
00:27:24,344 --> 00:27:26,811
Try. For me, huh?

427
00:27:26,846 --> 00:27:28,697
And if you do,

428
00:27:28,732 --> 00:27:31,816
i promise you i'll
never bother you again.

429
00:27:31,851 --> 00:27:33,068
All right.

430
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:39,708
There's her address.

431
00:27:39,743 --> 00:27:42,210
You don't even have
to phone.

432
00:27:42,245 --> 00:27:45,964
You can just,
uh, pick her up.

433
00:27:47,215 --> 00:27:49,084
About 8:00.

434
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:54,089
Charley.

435
00:27:54,124 --> 00:27:55,340
Hmm?

436
00:27:55,375 --> 00:27:57,225
What are you
thinking about?

437
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:00,345
Oh, nothing
in particular.

438
00:28:08,486 --> 00:28:11,606
Boy, you sure
are quiet.

439
00:28:11,641 --> 00:28:14,743
That means you're
thedangeroustype.

440
00:28:16,029 --> 00:28:19,114
You can't trust
the quiet ones.

441
00:28:19,149 --> 00:28:20,999
You can trust me.

442
00:28:21,034 --> 00:28:23,501
Who says i want to?

443
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:26,004
Well, i only meant, uh...

444
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:27,872
you know, you
ought to...

445
00:28:27,907 --> 00:28:30,375
relax... oh,
lean back.

446
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:32,260
Take it easy.

447
00:28:32,295 --> 00:28:34,763
There.

448
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:36,631
Isn't that nicer?

449
00:28:36,666 --> 00:28:38,516
Yes.

450
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:41,636
Charley?

451
00:28:41,671 --> 00:28:44,139
Hmm?

452
00:28:44,174 --> 00:28:46,641
Do you like me?

453
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:50,395
Very much.

454
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:53,531
Then why don't
you show it?

455
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:55,400
Well, how do you mean?

456
00:28:55,435 --> 00:28:57,902
Well...

457
00:28:57,937 --> 00:28:59,788
you might...

458
00:28:59,823 --> 00:29:03,541
you might try
kissing me first.

459
00:29:03,576 --> 00:29:05,410
Well... we hardly
even know each other.

460
00:29:05,445 --> 00:29:07,295
We just met this evening.

461
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:09,798
Well, try anyway.

462
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:24,062
Ouch!

463
00:29:24,097 --> 00:29:25,313
Oh, i'm sorry.

464
00:29:25,348 --> 00:29:27,182
Please, let me
help you up.

465
00:29:27,217 --> 00:29:29,684
Oh, forget
it, buster.

466
00:29:29,719 --> 00:29:31,569
Just forget it.

467
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:39,694
And you tell your sister
you don't need a girl.

468
00:29:39,729 --> 00:29:41,579
You need a doctor!

469
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:58,930
Twilight zonewill continue
after station identification.

470
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:14,646
Then, uh, she told me
i needed a doctor

471
00:30:14,681 --> 00:30:17,148
just because
i wouldn't kiss her.

472
00:30:17,183 --> 00:30:19,150
I know that must be hard
for you to believe,

473
00:30:19,185 --> 00:30:21,653
but that's the way
things are these days.

474
00:30:21,688 --> 00:30:25,039
Of course, i realize she was
doing it as a favor to myra,

475
00:30:25,074 --> 00:30:27,659
but even so...

476
00:30:52,066 --> 00:30:53,935
run.

477
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:55,186
Run!

478
00:30:55,221 --> 00:30:58,323
Don't you lay a hand on her.
Don't you touch her.

479
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,632
He was trying
to harm her.

480
00:31:58,499 --> 00:31:59,751
What?

481
00:31:59,786 --> 00:32:01,886
He tried to kiss her last night,

482
00:32:01,921 --> 00:32:05,006
but she wouldn't let him,
so he came back.

483
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:07,008
Sure.

484
00:32:08,393 --> 00:32:09,010
Sure.

485
00:32:09,045 --> 00:32:10,895
The maid... the maid
tried to stop him,

486
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:14,015
but he hit her over
the head with his cane.

487
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:16,651
Then he went after the girl.

488
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:21,022
She fainted, and he carried her
to the bedroom.

489
00:32:21,057 --> 00:32:23,524
I had to stop him.
You can see that, can't you?

490
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:27,028
Sure, sure, i can see that.

491
00:32:27,063 --> 00:32:30,031
L-i had to... i
had to stop him.

492
00:32:30,066 --> 00:32:33,785
I had to.
I had to do it.

493
00:32:40,675 --> 00:32:42,543
Now, mr. Parkes,
i want you to understand

494
00:32:42,578 --> 00:32:44,429
that no one is saying
you didn't see these things.

495
00:32:44,464 --> 00:32:46,297
There's no doubt
that you did.

496
00:32:46,332 --> 00:32:47,548
But you must realize

497
00:32:47,583 --> 00:32:50,685
that you saw them
only in your mind.

498
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,553
They were real.

499
00:32:52,588 --> 00:32:53,805
To you, they were.

500
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,057
That's the way it is
with hallucination.

501
00:32:56,092 --> 00:32:57,308
Ordinarily, the eye sees

502
00:32:57,343 --> 00:32:59,811
and transmits a picture
to the brain,

503
00:32:59,846 --> 00:33:01,696
but sometimes, that's reversed.

504
00:33:01,731 --> 00:33:02,947
In certain cases,

505
00:33:02,982 --> 00:33:07,952
the brain sees and transmits
its message to the eye.

506
00:33:07,987 --> 00:33:08,569
Do you understand?

507
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:12,323
No. They were real.

508
00:33:14,709 --> 00:33:19,714
In that case, others would have
seen them, too.

509
00:33:19,749 --> 00:33:21,582
Isn't that so?

510
00:33:21,617 --> 00:33:23,468
I don't know.

511
00:33:23,503 --> 00:33:26,587
It's logical,
isn't it?

512
00:33:26,622 --> 00:33:27,839
I suppose so.

513
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:30,341
But no one
did see them.

514
00:33:30,376 --> 00:33:32,844
Now, how do you
explain that?

515
00:33:32,879 --> 00:33:34,846
I don't know.

516
00:33:34,881 --> 00:33:37,348
Think about it
for a moment.

517
00:33:50,995 --> 00:33:52,864
Well, mr. Parkes?

518
00:33:52,899 --> 00:33:55,750
I don't know
why nobody else saw them.

519
00:33:55,785 --> 00:33:57,001
Maybe they weren't looking.

520
00:33:57,036 --> 00:34:01,122
You said that there were three
figures in the display case:

521
00:34:01,157 --> 00:34:03,624
A young girl, her maid
and a man.

522
00:34:03,659 --> 00:34:04,759
That's right.

523
00:34:04,794 --> 00:34:06,010
Now, let's look
at it logically

524
00:34:06,045 --> 00:34:07,261
for just a moment.

525
00:34:07,296 --> 00:34:08,629
According
to the museum officials,

526
00:34:08,664 --> 00:34:11,766
there was only one figure-
the girl.

527
00:34:11,801 --> 00:34:13,634
Where did the others come from?

528
00:34:14,018 --> 00:34:18,389
Well, the maid always came
from the kitchen

529
00:34:18,424 --> 00:34:20,274
or the dining room.

530
00:34:20,309 --> 00:34:24,145
And that-that fellow...

531
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:27,648
yes... where did he come from?

532
00:34:27,683 --> 00:34:28,282
Outside.

533
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,151
Outside the case?

534
00:34:30,186 --> 00:34:32,036
No, outside the house.

535
00:34:32,537 --> 00:34:36,908
Mr. Parkes, think about it.

536
00:34:36,943 --> 00:34:39,410
There was nothing
outside that house but glass,

537
00:34:39,445 --> 00:34:42,547
and beyond that, other displays.

538
00:34:42,582 --> 00:34:43,798
Isn't that true?

539
00:34:43,833 --> 00:34:46,918
Yes, but he came
in the front door.

540
00:34:47,301 --> 00:34:51,672
And they went out together once,
uh, to the opera or something.

541
00:34:51,707 --> 00:34:54,175
L-l-i don't know.

542
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:57,929
And... she never knew
what kind of person he was,

543
00:34:57,964 --> 00:34:59,180
but i could have told her.

544
00:34:59,215 --> 00:35:00,431
You only had to look at him

545
00:35:00,466 --> 00:35:02,316
to see what kind
of person he was.

546
00:35:02,351 --> 00:35:04,819
But she's so...

547
00:35:04,854 --> 00:35:07,321
trusting and-and innocent

548
00:35:07,356 --> 00:35:08,940
and helpless...

549
00:35:08,975 --> 00:35:11,442
not like other women?

550
00:35:11,477 --> 00:35:13,327
No, not at all.

551
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:15,329
Have you seen her?

552
00:35:15,364 --> 00:35:17,832
Yes.

553
00:35:17,867 --> 00:35:19,584
Well, is-is she all right?

554
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:21,702
L-i've been worried sick.

555
00:35:21,737 --> 00:35:23,588
Would you like to see her?

556
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:26,591
Yes.

557
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:36,968
Be careful.

558
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:43,357
You're holding
a piece of wood

559
00:35:43,392 --> 00:35:45,226
in your hand,
mr. Parkes.

560
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:50,364
A beautifully carved piece
of wood.

561
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:54,118
Do you have to take her back?

562
00:35:54,153 --> 00:35:55,987
I'm afraid so.

563
00:35:56,022 --> 00:35:57,872
It is museum property.

564
00:35:57,907 --> 00:36:00,992
Now, i want you to
go back to your room

565
00:36:01,027 --> 00:36:03,494
and think about
what i've said.

566
00:36:03,529 --> 00:36:05,997
Will you do that?

567
00:36:06,032 --> 00:36:11,002
And remember, whatyou saw
is not the important thing.

568
00:36:11,037 --> 00:36:12,887
Our job is to find outwhy.

569
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:16,007
Once we've
accomplished that,

570
00:36:16,042 --> 00:36:19,760
you'll have no more
hallucinations.

571
00:36:46,837 --> 00:36:48,706
Where is charley?

572
00:36:48,741 --> 00:36:50,591
Oh, he'll be here
in a few moments.

573
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:53,094
Is he really normal,
doctor?

574
00:36:53,129 --> 00:36:58,716
That is a word
we try not to use, mrs. Parkes.

575
00:36:58,751 --> 00:36:59,967
Why not?

576
00:37:00,002 --> 00:37:01,219
Well, because
it's meaningless.

577
00:37:01,254 --> 00:37:03,721
"Normal"
in the popular sense refers

578
00:37:03,756 --> 00:37:07,475
only to the behavior pattern of
the majority, and that pattern

579
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:09,360
is not
necessarily good.

580
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:15,616
Well... if 99.9% of the people
in the country were to, uh...

581
00:37:15,651 --> 00:37:18,736
oh, go to bed
with their socks on, let's say,

582
00:37:18,771 --> 00:37:21,239
then going to bed
with one's socks on

583
00:37:21,274 --> 00:37:22,490
would be the normal thing to do.

584
00:37:22,525 --> 00:37:25,626
And if you didn't,
you wouldn't be normal, you see?

585
00:37:25,661 --> 00:37:29,880
I go to bed with my socks on
all the time.

586
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:32,633
What i'm trying to say is,

587
00:37:32,668 --> 00:37:34,502
don't judge
charley's emotional health

588
00:37:34,537 --> 00:37:36,387
by the degree
to which he conforms

589
00:37:36,422 --> 00:37:38,256
to other people's standards.

590
00:37:38,291 --> 00:37:39,507
Don't expect him to...

591
00:37:39,542 --> 00:37:41,759
well, be like
other people.

592
00:37:41,794 --> 00:37:43,644
Then you don't
think he's sick?

593
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:46,764
Not now, no.
He was when he came here.

594
00:37:46,799 --> 00:37:49,900
The constant pressure of trying
to be something he wasn't,

595
00:37:49,935 --> 00:37:53,020
of-of trying to act
and feel and think

596
00:37:53,055 --> 00:37:54,272
the way you
wanted him to

597
00:37:54,307 --> 00:37:55,523
instead of the
way he wanted to-

598
00:37:55,558 --> 00:37:56,774
well, these
things contributed

599
00:37:56,809 --> 00:37:58,025
to a serious
breakdown.

600
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:02,163
You see, well,
charley was unable

601
00:38:02,198 --> 00:38:03,414
to cope with
this world,

602
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:06,667
so his mind created
another world.

603
00:38:06,702 --> 00:38:10,421
Of course, he knew it was false,
and he destroyed it.

604
00:38:10,456 --> 00:38:12,290
And with that first step,

605
00:38:12,325 --> 00:38:15,426
he started back
on the road to mental health.

606
00:38:15,461 --> 00:38:17,295
Now, of course,

607
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:19,797
he insisted it was real
for a long time, as you know,

608
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:21,932
but that is
standard behavior

609
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:24,435
in cases of
hallucination.

610
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:28,806
Uh, that's an interesting habit
you have, that, uh...

611
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:32,810
why do you do it?

612
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:40,067
Myra.

613
00:38:40,102 --> 00:38:42,570
Hello, charley.

614
00:38:42,605 --> 00:38:45,072
Old buddy.

615
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:49,460
Oh, mother, how
nice of you to come.

616
00:38:53,214 --> 00:38:55,082
How you feeling,
charley?

617
00:38:55,117 --> 00:38:58,219
Oh, wonderful, doctor,
really, wonderful.

618
00:38:58,254 --> 00:39:00,221
I can't tell you
how much you've helped me.

619
00:39:00,256 --> 00:39:02,089
No more dreams?

620
00:39:02,124 --> 00:39:04,475
Oh, i've been sleeping
like a baby.

621
00:39:05,226 --> 00:39:07,728
Not worried about the girl
in the display case?

622
00:39:07,763 --> 00:39:10,481
There was no girl, just a doll.

623
00:39:10,516 --> 00:39:12,350
I know that.

624
00:39:12,385 --> 00:39:16,103
And i know what it was that
made me think i saw what i saw,

625
00:39:16,138 --> 00:39:16,737
thanks to you.

626
00:39:16,772 --> 00:39:19,240
Thanks to you, charley.

627
00:39:19,275 --> 00:39:21,108
You figured it out, remember?

628
00:39:21,143 --> 00:39:21,859
I didn't tell
you anything

629
00:39:21,894 --> 00:39:23,744
after the first day.

630
00:39:26,782 --> 00:39:28,249
Now, mother.

631
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:30,751
Oh, charley...

632
00:39:30,786 --> 00:39:33,254
i was so worried
about my baby.

633
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:35,756
I was so frightened.

634
00:39:35,791 --> 00:39:37,625
I know you were,
and i'm sorry

635
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:39,510
i put you through
so much heartache,

636
00:39:39,545 --> 00:39:40,761
but i'm fine now.

637
00:39:40,796 --> 00:39:42,012
Isn't that
right, doctor?

638
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,131
I think so.

639
00:39:44,166 --> 00:39:45,383
And i'll get a job,

640
00:39:45,418 --> 00:39:47,268
and everything will
be the way it was,

641
00:39:47,303 --> 00:39:49,136
just the way it was.

642
00:39:58,529 --> 00:40:00,398
I sure missed this.

643
00:40:00,433 --> 00:40:03,534
No one could make cocoa
the way you can.

644
00:40:03,569 --> 00:40:05,403
Did they hurt
you, charley?

645
00:40:06,036 --> 00:40:07,405
Well, they were afraid
they were going

646
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,656
to have to use, uh,
shock treatment,

647
00:40:08,691 --> 00:40:10,541
and i hear that hurts
quite a bit,

648
00:40:10,576 --> 00:40:13,043
but they decided not to
when i got well.

649
00:40:13,078 --> 00:40:15,546
Everything else was fine.

650
00:40:15,581 --> 00:40:18,165
They got a lot of nuts
in that place, i guess, huh?

651
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,050
I didn't mean him!

652
00:40:20,085 --> 00:40:22,169
That's all right. I don't mind.

653
00:40:22,803 --> 00:40:24,672
May i have some more cocoa?

654
00:40:26,557 --> 00:40:28,676
Uh, charley, we have

655
00:40:28,711 --> 00:40:29,927
a couple of
surprises for you.

656
00:40:29,962 --> 00:40:32,179
Oh?

657
00:40:32,214 --> 00:40:33,431
First of all,
that job

658
00:40:33,466 --> 00:40:35,933
in buddy's office
is still open.

659
00:40:35,968 --> 00:40:37,818
Fine.

660
00:40:37,853 --> 00:40:40,438
And i talked
to harriet

661
00:40:40,473 --> 00:40:42,940
and explained things.

662
00:40:42,975 --> 00:40:44,825
But she's a
wonderful girl,

663
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:46,577
and she understands.

664
00:40:46,612 --> 00:40:47,828
Well, fine.

665
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:49,447
And you can tell
her yourself,

666
00:40:49,482 --> 00:40:51,332
because she's
coming over tonight.

667
00:40:51,367 --> 00:40:54,335
Well, that's just wonderful.
Thank you, myra.

668
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:54,952
Thank you, buddy.

669
00:40:55,586 --> 00:40:56,954
It took a lot of doing-
i can tell you that.

670
00:40:56,989 --> 00:40:59,457
I mean, where you been
and all.

671
00:40:59,492 --> 00:41:03,594
I'm sure it did,
but you won't be sorry.

672
00:41:03,629 --> 00:41:07,965
I intend to work very hard.

673
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,600
Now, if i'm going to be fresh
for tonight,

674
00:41:09,635 --> 00:41:12,720
i'd better go get
a little rest.

675
00:41:12,755 --> 00:41:15,856
Would you like
to fix up my bed, mother?

676
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:34,124
Charley, are you all
right, now, really?

677
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:37,244
Yes, mother, really.

678
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:40,381
You won't go talking
crazy anymore

679
00:41:40,416 --> 00:41:42,249
and smashing things?

680
00:41:42,284 --> 00:41:45,386
No, mother, that-that's
all in the past.

681
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:59,149
It's good to have
you back, son.

682
00:41:59,184 --> 00:42:01,652
I can't tell you.

683
00:42:33,586 --> 00:42:34,802
There's harriet.

684
00:42:34,837 --> 00:42:37,938
You'd better tell charley
to get ready. Hurry!

685
00:42:40,441 --> 00:42:42,309
Hi. You look great.

686
00:42:42,344 --> 00:42:44,194
Thanks.
New dress?

687
00:42:44,229 --> 00:42:46,697
20 bucks' worth.
Hi, bud.

688
00:42:46,732 --> 00:42:47,948
Hiya, harriet.

689
00:42:49,852 --> 00:42:53,454
Charley, your company's here.

690
00:42:54,705 --> 00:42:57,207
Charley?

691
00:42:57,242 --> 00:42:58,459
What's the matter?
Can't you wake him up?

692
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:01,579
No, he must
be very tired.

693
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:05,332
Hey, it's locked.

694
00:43:05,367 --> 00:43:06,584
It couldn't be.

695
00:43:06,619 --> 00:43:07,835
Charley never
locks his door.

696
00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:09,720
Try it yourself.

697
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,725
Charley, boy.

698
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:15,342
Buddy...

699
00:43:15,377 --> 00:43:17,227
what on earth
is all the racket about?

700
00:43:17,262 --> 00:43:18,479
Maybe he doesn't want
to be disturbed.

701
00:43:18,514 --> 00:43:20,347
Nobody could sleep
through that.

702
00:43:20,382 --> 00:43:20,981
Break it down.

703
00:43:21,016 --> 00:43:23,484
Aw, gee,
i don't...
break it down!

704
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:24,735
Okay.

705
00:43:28,989 --> 00:43:30,858
Charley!

706
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:36,363
Charley?

707
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:41,619
Charley?

708
00:43:45,005 --> 00:43:47,508
Charley...

709
00:43:47,543 --> 00:43:48,125
oh, now, mama,

710
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,010
there's no need
to get excited.

711
00:43:50,045 --> 00:43:51,261
But he's gone!
Harriet.

712
00:43:51,296 --> 00:43:52,513
He must've crawled
out of the window.

713
00:43:52,548 --> 00:43:55,015
Why would he do
a thing like that?

714
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:56,884
I don't know.
He's your son.

715
00:43:56,919 --> 00:43:58,135
Myra!

716
00:43:58,170 --> 00:43:59,136
What are you
going to do?

717
00:43:59,171 --> 00:44:01,021
Mama, mama,
take it easy.

718
00:44:01,056 --> 00:44:01,639
Myra, what...

719
00:44:01,674 --> 00:44:03,524
mama...

720
00:44:03,559 --> 00:44:04,775
hello, operator?

721
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:06,644
Could you give me
the number

722
00:44:06,679 --> 00:44:08,529
of the county museum,
please?

723
00:44:10,397 --> 00:44:11,649
Thank you.

724
00:44:11,684 --> 00:44:13,534
He couldn't
have gone there.

725
00:44:13,569 --> 00:44:15,402
He's well-
the doctor said so.

726
00:44:15,437 --> 00:44:17,287
Mama, please!

727
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:24,161
Hello, uh, could
you tell me, please,

728
00:44:24,196 --> 00:44:26,664
are you open tonight?

729
00:44:28,549 --> 00:44:31,051
Oh, thank you.

730
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:37,307
Well, you're right.
He's not there.

731
00:44:37,342 --> 00:44:41,061
They close at 5:00
every day except tuesday,

732
00:44:41,096 --> 00:44:44,181
and this is wednesday.

733
00:45:25,507 --> 00:45:27,975
They tried to tell me
you weren't real.

734
00:45:28,010 --> 00:45:29,860
They tried
to make me think

735
00:45:29,895 --> 00:45:31,729
that you were
only something i imagined.

736
00:45:31,764 --> 00:45:34,231
Of course, i knew better,

737
00:45:34,266 --> 00:45:37,117
but i pretended to believe them.

738
00:45:38,619 --> 00:45:40,487
Because if i hadn't
have done that,

739
00:45:40,522 --> 00:45:42,372
i'd still be in
the hospital,

740
00:45:42,407 --> 00:45:46,243
and i never
would have seen you again.

741
00:45:46,278 --> 00:45:49,379
That would have been terrible,
because, uh...

742
00:45:49,414 --> 00:45:53,500
you see, i love you.

743
00:45:55,385 --> 00:45:58,138
I don't know how
i can make you understand that.

744
00:45:58,173 --> 00:46:03,143
Maybe if i
keep telling
you, you will.

745
00:46:03,178 --> 00:46:06,263
I love you, alice.

746
00:46:06,298 --> 00:46:12,770
I love you.

747
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:16,406
So then we knocked,
but he didn't answer,

748
00:46:16,441 --> 00:46:19,526
so i had buddy
knock down the door.

749
00:46:19,561 --> 00:46:22,029
I see. Now, how would
you describe his behavior

750
00:46:22,064 --> 00:46:24,531
prior to his going in
for the nap?

751
00:46:24,566 --> 00:46:26,416
Well, i don't know
how to put it.

752
00:46:26,451 --> 00:46:29,536
It was as if he
were so healthy

753
00:46:29,571 --> 00:46:31,421
that i was worried.

754
00:46:31,456 --> 00:46:33,924
It was like he
didn't have a
care in the world.

755
00:46:33,959 --> 00:46:36,426
So i thought,
'well, maybe he
went to the museum,'

756
00:46:36,461 --> 00:46:38,295
so i phoned,
but they're
closed tonight.

757
00:46:38,330 --> 00:46:39,546
So where
could he be?

758
00:46:39,581 --> 00:46:40,798
Oh, he's there, all right.

759
00:46:40,833 --> 00:46:43,300
But i just told
you they're closed.

760
00:46:43,335 --> 00:46:45,803
I expect he went in earlier
and hid somewhere.

761
00:46:45,838 --> 00:46:50,808
Now, i was
just wondering...

762
00:46:50,843 --> 00:46:53,310
if you would go along
with us, mr. Russell.

763
00:46:53,345 --> 00:46:54,561
Sure.

764
00:46:54,596 --> 00:46:55,813
It may not be necessary,

765
00:46:55,848 --> 00:46:57,698
but you never can
quite tell.

766
00:46:57,733 --> 00:47:00,200
And mrs. Parkes, you might
be able to do some good,

767
00:47:00,235 --> 00:47:01,451
if you're willing.

768
00:47:01,486 --> 00:47:03,320
Anything for poor charley.

769
00:47:03,355 --> 00:47:05,205
Good.

770
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:07,074
Doctor, are you going
to take him

771
00:47:07,109 --> 00:47:08,959
back there
to the hospital?

772
00:47:08,994 --> 00:47:12,079
I think it might
be wise, don't you?

773
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:19,586
Give me the police
department, please.

774
00:47:19,621 --> 00:47:22,089
Dr. Wallman says it happened

775
00:47:22,124 --> 00:47:25,843
because i needed a simple world
i could understand,

776
00:47:25,878 --> 00:47:28,345
but your world
isn't simple, is it?

777
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:31,481
No world with people in it is.

778
00:47:31,516 --> 00:47:35,235
There's always loneliness
and suffering and heartache.

779
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:35,986
Look at you,

780
00:47:36,021 --> 00:47:38,488
crying because
you're alone.

781
00:47:38,523 --> 00:47:40,357
Well, i've been
alone all my life.

782
00:47:40,392 --> 00:47:42,860
Oh, people
have tried.

783
00:47:42,895 --> 00:47:45,362
My mother and my sister-

784
00:47:45,397 --> 00:47:47,865
they've tried very hard
to understand...

785
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:50,367
but they can't.

786
00:47:50,402 --> 00:47:53,253
You could.

787
00:47:53,288 --> 00:47:57,007
We could understand
each other...

788
00:47:57,042 --> 00:47:59,509
and help each other and...

789
00:47:59,544 --> 00:48:01,628
love each other.

790
00:48:01,663 --> 00:48:03,513
If only...

791
00:48:05,417 --> 00:48:07,134
i don't know where he'd hide.

792
00:48:07,169 --> 00:48:09,019
I check things
pretty carefully

793
00:48:09,054 --> 00:48:10,270
every night
before i leave.

794
00:48:10,305 --> 00:48:11,521
I'm sure you do,

795
00:48:11,556 --> 00:48:13,390
but you'll grant
it's possible?

796
00:48:13,425 --> 00:48:15,893
Barely.

797
00:48:15,928 --> 00:48:17,144
Straight ahead there.

798
00:48:17,778 --> 00:48:19,029
Do you want me
to turn on the lights?

799
00:48:19,064 --> 00:48:20,280
Not yet.

800
00:48:20,315 --> 00:48:22,149
Mrs. Parkes,
will you come with me?

801
00:48:22,184 --> 00:48:25,285
And will the rest of
you wait here, please?

802
00:48:37,047 --> 00:48:38,916
Tell him you're here.

803
00:48:38,951 --> 00:48:41,418
Ask him to come out.

804
00:48:41,453 --> 00:48:43,303
Charley.

805
00:48:43,338 --> 00:48:45,806
Louder. Command him.

806
00:48:45,841 --> 00:48:48,926
Charley, it's mother.
Come out of there.

807
00:48:48,961 --> 00:48:51,428
Again.

808
00:48:51,463 --> 00:48:54,564
Come out of there
this second, young man!

809
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:57,067
You hear me?

810
00:48:57,102 --> 00:48:59,569
All right, guard,

811
00:48:59,604 --> 00:49:01,438
you can turn
them on now.

812
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:11,331
Are you sure
he's here?

813
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:13,200
I'm almost
positive.

814
00:49:13,235 --> 00:49:15,702
Let's start looking.

815
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:22,592
Charley?

816
00:49:25,712 --> 00:49:27,597
Charley!

817
00:49:58,628 --> 00:50:00,497
They never found
charley parkes,

818
00:50:00,532 --> 00:50:01,748
because the guard
didn't tell them

819
00:50:02,382 --> 00:50:03,633
what he saw in the glass case.

820
00:50:03,668 --> 00:50:05,502
He knew what they'd say,

821
00:50:05,537 --> 00:50:06,887
and he knew
they'd be right, too,

822
00:50:06,922 --> 00:50:09,389
because seeing
is not always believing-

823
00:50:09,424 --> 00:50:11,258
especially if what you see

824
00:50:11,293 --> 00:50:14,511
happens to be an odd corner
of the twilight zone.

825
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:24,488
Some rather special ingredients
to a bizarre brew

826
00:50:24,523 --> 00:50:26,990
served up next
onthe twilight zone.

827
00:50:27,025 --> 00:50:30,360
An oddball printing press,
an editor with a stringer

828
00:50:30,395 --> 00:50:32,112
from the lower regions
are just a few as we bring you

829
00:50:32,147 --> 00:50:34,614
robert sterling,
patricia crowley,

830
00:50:34,649 --> 00:50:37,501
and special guest star
burgess meredith

831
00:50:37,536 --> 00:50:39,503
in charles beaumont's
"printer's devil."

832
00:50:39,538 --> 00:50:40,754
What's the matter?

833
00:50:40,789 --> 00:50:42,005
Matter?

834
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:42,622
Why did you quit?

835
00:50:42,657 --> 00:50:43,874
Finished.

836
00:50:43,909 --> 00:50:45,759
Why would a man with your talent

837
00:50:45,794 --> 00:50:47,627
want to work for a hick paper
like thecourier?

838
00:50:47,662 --> 00:50:50,130
Call it a challenge.

839
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:55,385
Now, miss benson,
are you impressed?

840
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:57,270
No. I'm amazed.

841
00:50:57,305 --> 00:50:59,139
It's understandable.

842
00:50:59,174 --> 00:51:01,641
Well, i must confess

843
00:51:01,676 --> 00:51:03,527
that this is not
my true vocation.

844
00:51:03,562 --> 00:51:04,144
It isn't?

845
00:51:04,179 --> 00:51:06,029
No. I am a reporter.

846
00:51:06,064 --> 00:51:07,397
Oh.

847
00:51:07,432 --> 00:51:11,151
Some people have a green thumb.
I have a green nose.

848
00:51:11,186 --> 00:51:14,287
Wherever there is news,
this old nose smells it.

849
00:51:14,322 --> 00:51:16,039
Well, i'm afraid
there isn't that much news

850
00:51:16,074 --> 00:51:17,908
to smell around dansburg,
mr. Smith.

851
00:51:17,943 --> 00:51:19,793
There will be.
