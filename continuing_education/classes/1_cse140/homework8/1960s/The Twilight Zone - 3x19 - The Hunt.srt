1
00:00:10,643 --> 00:00:13,146
You're traveling
through another dimension-

2
00:00:13,181 --> 00:00:16,282
a dimension not only of sight
and sound, but of mind,

3
00:00:16,317 --> 00:00:18,151
a journey into a wondrous land

4
00:00:18,186 --> 00:00:20,653
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

5
00:00:20,688 --> 00:00:23,156
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

6
00:00:50,683 --> 00:00:53,820
Rachel,
open up in there.

7
00:00:53,855 --> 00:00:55,688
Got my arms full.

8
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:05,698
Well, old man, what are
you hollering about?

9
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:07,584
You going to
suffocate in there

10
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:08,835
from lack of air.

11
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:11,337
Why don't you leave
the door open?

12
00:01:11,372 --> 00:01:12,589
I got to keep that dog

13
00:01:12,624 --> 00:01:14,457
out of the house
somehow-

14
00:01:14,492 --> 00:01:16,709
coming in here
with his fleas

15
00:01:16,744 --> 00:01:17,961
and with
his ticks.

16
00:01:17,996 --> 00:01:21,714
Aw, old woman, don't start
that commotion up again.

17
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:23,600
When i go in the house,

18
00:01:23,635 --> 00:01:24,968
rip goes, too.

19
00:01:25,003 --> 00:01:26,352
That dog saved my life.

20
00:01:28,104 --> 00:01:29,472
Well...

21
00:01:29,507 --> 00:01:30,974
let the ornery
thing come in.

22
00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:32,725
And another thing-

23
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,228
don't talk about him
like that

24
00:01:35,263 --> 00:01:37,113
when he can hear you.

25
00:01:37,148 --> 00:01:38,364
Rip's got feelings.

26
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:40,233
I don't want them hurt.

27
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:44,621
I'll let him
in the house,

28
00:01:44,656 --> 00:01:47,740
and i'll feed him,
but i'll be switched

29
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:51,494
if i'm going to start
sweet-talking him.

30
00:01:51,529 --> 00:01:53,997
Old woman,
you tickle me sometimes.

31
00:01:54,032 --> 00:01:58,384
Uh, when's the last time
you got yourself kissed?

32
00:01:59,636 --> 00:02:01,504
Well, the way
i figure it,

33
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:05,258
it was in the spring of
nineteen and twenty-four.

34
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:08,394
Well, i figure
you got one coming.

35
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:10,263
Don't you come
near me, old man.

36
00:02:10,298 --> 00:02:12,148
Yes, sir,
i've been thinking

37
00:02:12,183 --> 00:02:14,017
about giving you a kiss

38
00:02:14,052 --> 00:02:15,268
for the last
month or two.

39
00:02:15,303 --> 00:02:18,404
Oh, hyder, you sit down
and eat your supper

40
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:20,273
and stop talking silly.

41
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:25,278
I'll have my supper
now, old woman.

42
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:29,666
There you are.

43
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:35,288
Old man...

44
00:02:35,323 --> 00:02:37,790
i never said
this to you...

45
00:02:39,676 --> 00:02:43,429
...but we have
endured powerful well

46
00:02:43,464 --> 00:02:45,932
over the years together.

47
00:02:45,967 --> 00:02:47,183
Hmm?

48
00:02:47,218 --> 00:02:50,303
Nearly 50 years
we've been married, eh?

49
00:02:50,338 --> 00:02:51,554
Come october 16.

50
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:55,058
Long time to travel together.

51
00:02:55,093 --> 00:02:57,810
Well, i wouldn't have had it
any other way.

52
00:02:57,845 --> 00:03:00,196
Thank you, old woman.

53
00:03:00,231 --> 00:03:01,447
Me neither.

54
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:04,567
Here, rip.

55
00:03:05,201 --> 00:03:07,070
I'll feed that dog
after supper.

56
00:03:07,704 --> 00:03:10,206
He ain't going to be
here after supper.

57
00:03:10,241 --> 00:03:12,075
Where's he going?

58
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:13,576
Where i'm going-
coon hunting.

59
00:03:13,611 --> 00:03:16,462
Oh, hyder.

60
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:20,466
I wish you wouldn't
go hunting tonight.

61
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:21,718
Why not?

62
00:03:21,753 --> 00:03:22,969
Well, three
nights ago,

63
00:03:23,004 --> 00:03:24,837
i saw blood
on the moon.

64
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:27,340
You ought to have been
in bed sleeping.

65
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:29,225
You wouldn't have seen it.

66
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,344
And two days ago,
a bird flew in the house

67
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:35,732
and lit on your side of the bed
and nearly scared me to death.

68
00:03:35,767 --> 00:03:40,353
There you go,
trying to spoil a good hunt.

69
00:03:40,388 --> 00:03:43,239
Well,
i'm a-going anyways.

70
00:03:43,274 --> 00:03:45,358
Them signs
don't bother me at all.

71
00:03:45,393 --> 00:03:49,112
Well, they bother me.

72
00:03:54,152 --> 00:03:56,002
Now, you be careful,
old man.

73
00:03:56,619 --> 00:03:59,122
Don't you worry
about me, old woman.

74
00:03:59,157 --> 00:04:02,875
I'll be back even before
midnight, more'n likely.

75
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:06,512
An old man
and a hound dog named rip

76
00:04:06,547 --> 00:04:09,515
off for an evening's pleasure
in quest of raccoon.

77
00:04:10,133 --> 00:04:11,384
Usually, these evenings end

78
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:15,138
with one tired old man,
one battle-scarred hound dog

79
00:04:15,173 --> 00:04:17,640
and one or more
extremely dead raccoons,

80
00:04:18,274 --> 00:04:22,028
but as you may suspect, that
will not be the case tonight.

81
00:04:22,063 --> 00:04:25,782
These hunters won't be
coming home from the hill.

82
00:04:25,817 --> 00:04:29,535
They're headed for the backwoods
of the twilight zone.

83
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:01,601
Smell him out there, boy.

84
00:05:01,636 --> 00:05:03,486
He's around here somewheres.

85
00:05:03,521 --> 00:05:05,355
You can get him.

86
00:05:38,521 --> 00:05:41,641
Tree'd him, didn't you, boy?

87
00:05:49,899 --> 00:05:52,402
Rip,
don't want to doubt your word,

88
00:05:52,437 --> 00:05:54,654
but there ain't
no coon up there.

89
00:06:00,043 --> 00:06:02,412
Trick ya, didn't he, boy?

90
00:06:23,433 --> 00:06:25,435
Hold it back
there, rip.

91
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,320
Come back
here, rip!

92
00:06:27,355 --> 00:06:29,572
Don't go
in there!

93
00:06:29,607 --> 00:06:31,441
I'll pull you out, rip!

94
00:06:31,476 --> 00:06:32,692
Come back here, rip!

95
00:06:32,727 --> 00:06:34,577
Hold on, hold on there, rip.

96
00:06:34,612 --> 00:06:35,828
Come back here!

97
00:06:35,863 --> 00:06:37,697
That coon'll drown you, rip.

98
00:06:38,948 --> 00:06:40,700
That coon's got him down.

99
00:06:40,735 --> 00:06:41,951
Huh! I'm coming, rip.

100
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:48,841
I'm coming, rip, hold it!

101
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:54,714
I'm coming!

102
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:58,027
Rip...

103
00:07:58,062 --> 00:08:01,781
we must have trailed
that coon half the night.

104
00:08:01,816 --> 00:08:03,666
Hungry, ain't you, boy?

105
00:08:03,701 --> 00:08:05,535
Yeah, me, too.

106
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:08,037
So let's mosey along home

107
00:08:08,072 --> 00:08:11,174
and see what rachel's got
for breakfast.

108
00:08:13,676 --> 00:08:17,430
That old woman gives us
"hail, columbia"

109
00:08:17,465 --> 00:08:19,298
for staying out all night.

110
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:41,454
I figure that's
about deep enough.

111
00:08:41,489 --> 00:08:43,322
That ain't more
than three feet.

112
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:45,825
Three feet's deep
enough for a dog.

113
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,460
Any ordinary dog, maybe,

114
00:08:47,495 --> 00:08:49,328
but according
to old man simpson,

115
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:51,214
rip ain't no ordinary dog.

116
00:08:51,249 --> 00:08:52,832
Then you dig it.

117
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:02,592
It'll be kind of lonesome around
here without old man simpson.

118
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:11,484
Morning, boys.

119
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,738
Reckon them miller boys
gotten hard of hearing.

120
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:26,866
What you old boys up to?

121
00:09:28,618 --> 00:09:30,119
Say, what you doing?

122
00:09:31,754 --> 00:09:34,123
All right,
don't answer me, then.

123
00:09:34,158 --> 00:09:37,260
I don't give a hoot
what you're doing.

124
00:09:37,295 --> 00:09:38,878
If i ain't mistaken,

125
00:09:38,913 --> 00:09:42,014
you're digging this hole
on my land.

126
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:46,385
Now, if you want to dig,
dig on your side of the fence.

127
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,638
Get moving.

128
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:51,524
I say get moving!

129
00:09:53,142 --> 00:09:56,279
I ain't talking
just to move the wind around.

130
00:09:56,314 --> 00:09:57,530
You get a move on

131
00:09:58,147 --> 00:10:01,284
or i'm going to fill your
britches full of lead!

132
00:10:01,319 --> 00:10:04,036
I figure that's just
about deep enough.

133
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:08,791
Have a little care.

134
00:10:08,826 --> 00:10:10,660
It's just a dog.

135
00:10:10,695 --> 00:10:11,544
Not to some folks.

136
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:18,167
Why didn't you tell me
you'd lost a dog?

137
00:10:18,202 --> 00:10:19,418
How'd it happen?

138
00:10:25,675 --> 00:10:28,811
Don't reckon i blame you
for not talking.

139
00:10:28,846 --> 00:10:31,931
I don't reckon i would myself.

140
00:10:31,966 --> 00:10:35,935
Well, rip, we're butting in
on other folks' troubles.

141
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:38,187
They're just
too heartbroke to talk.

142
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:42,575
And speaking of trouble,

143
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:46,329
that old woman's going to have
plenty of that for us.

144
00:10:46,364 --> 00:10:47,330
Come on.

145
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:59,208
Looks to me like, rip, maybe
we got us a stroke of luck.

146
00:10:59,243 --> 00:11:01,711
Could be the old woman's
still sleeping.

147
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:11,971
Morning.

148
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:22,732
All dressed up
like the fourth of july.

149
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:26,485
Old woman,
if you're figuring

150
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,622
on leaving me on account
on i stayed out all night,

151
00:11:29,657 --> 00:11:32,124
you got another thing coming.

152
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:33,993
Lord be with
you, sister.

153
00:11:35,244 --> 00:11:37,129
Amen, brother.

154
00:11:37,164 --> 00:11:39,632
I appreciate your coming,

155
00:11:39,667 --> 00:11:41,500
even though he
didn't belong

156
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:42,134
to the church.

157
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:44,637
I just never could
get him to go.

158
00:11:44,672 --> 00:11:47,139
I realize
brother simpson

159
00:11:47,174 --> 00:11:48,391
wasn't a
religious man,

160
00:11:48,426 --> 00:11:50,259
but i figure he's
still entitled

161
00:11:50,294 --> 00:11:52,144
to a christian
burial.

162
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:54,013
Now, just...
just hold everything.

163
00:11:54,048 --> 00:11:57,767
Anybody's going to give
brother simpson a burial

164
00:11:57,802 --> 00:12:00,903
you'd better ask brother simpson
how he feels about it.

165
00:12:00,938 --> 00:12:03,522
I just been sitting here...

166
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:06,025
trying to figure it out.

167
00:12:08,277 --> 00:12:10,780
It was just
last night.

168
00:12:10,815 --> 00:12:14,417
He was sitting there
at the supper table.

169
00:12:14,452 --> 00:12:16,285
I begged him not to go.

170
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:21,173
There's
been omens.

171
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,676
I've seen signs.

172
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:26,295
But he went.

173
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:29,799
The lord works in
mysterious ways.

174
00:12:29,834 --> 00:12:32,301
Rachel,
listen to me-

175
00:12:32,336 --> 00:12:36,055
there's been
a misunderstanding.

176
00:12:38,941 --> 00:12:40,192
Miss rachel,

177
00:12:40,227 --> 00:12:42,061
if you're ready, ma'am.

178
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:46,449
Well, he's in there.

179
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:57,710
Oh...

180
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:03,833
don't take on,
old woman.

181
00:13:03,868 --> 00:13:05,718
It's just a dream.

182
00:13:05,753 --> 00:13:07,586
We'll wake up in a little

183
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:11,340
and everything'll be
like it ought to be.

184
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:16,729
What you old boys
got in there?

185
00:13:19,849 --> 00:13:22,351
What you old boys
taking out of there?

186
00:13:22,985 --> 00:13:24,236
Oh!

187
00:13:24,271 --> 00:13:26,105
Who's in that box?

188
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:08,497
We'll find out
what all this is about

189
00:14:08,532 --> 00:14:09,748
in a minute or two, rip.

190
00:14:09,783 --> 00:14:12,885
The graveyard's just over
the top of the hill there.

191
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:52,174
Now, who in the tarnation
built this fence up here?

192
00:14:52,209 --> 00:14:54,043
Rip, we must have taken
a wrong turn.

193
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:58,430
I don't memorize
ever seeing this fence before.

194
00:14:59,682 --> 00:15:02,801
Well, we're bound
to come out somewhere.

195
00:15:19,702 --> 00:15:20,953
Hello!

196
00:15:20,988 --> 00:15:22,204
Anybody home in there?

197
00:15:24,707 --> 00:15:25,958
Howdy, neighbor.

198
00:15:25,993 --> 00:15:27,209
Howdy.

199
00:15:27,244 --> 00:15:29,712
I wasn't expecting
nobody this morning.

200
00:15:29,747 --> 00:15:32,831
Don't want to put you
to no trouble, friend,

201
00:15:32,866 --> 00:15:34,717
but it seems like
i lost my way.

202
00:15:34,752 --> 00:15:37,219
That's what everybody
says at first.

203
00:15:37,254 --> 00:15:39,088
Now, what's
your name, friend?

204
00:15:39,123 --> 00:15:41,340
Simpson- hyder simpson.

205
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:43,726
I belong to that
bunch of simpsons

206
00:15:43,761 --> 00:15:46,228
lives over on
whale's mountain.

207
00:15:46,263 --> 00:15:47,479
Rip and me here-

208
00:15:47,514 --> 00:15:49,848
we never have traveled
this far before.

209
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:51,850
Never have
traveled so far

210
00:15:51,885 --> 00:15:54,353
we couldn't see the top
of whale's mountain.

211
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:56,855
How old are you,
neighbor simpson?

212
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:59,358
Well, sir, i been
walking the earth

213
00:15:59,393 --> 00:16:01,243
for something
like 70 year now.

214
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:03,112
Arrived at the gate,
uh, 10:45...

215
00:16:03,147 --> 00:16:05,614
i know it's none
of my business,

216
00:16:05,649 --> 00:16:06,865
but would you tell me

217
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,368
what you're writing
down in that book?

218
00:16:09,403 --> 00:16:11,620
One more thing,
neighbor simpson-

219
00:16:11,655 --> 00:16:12,871
how'd you die?

220
00:16:12,906 --> 00:16:16,625
I was born
with a cheap set of ears.

221
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:19,762
I'm not sure i heard you right.

222
00:16:19,797 --> 00:16:21,630
I said, "how did you die?"

223
00:16:22,264 --> 00:16:23,515
Who claims i'm dead?

224
00:16:23,632 --> 00:16:26,769
You wouldn't be here
if you wasn't dead.

225
00:16:26,804 --> 00:16:28,771
Man, that's solid
flesh and bone there.

226
00:16:28,806 --> 00:16:30,639
You feel that.

227
00:16:30,674 --> 00:16:31,890
Think back, neighbor.

228
00:16:31,925 --> 00:16:33,525
What did you do last night?

229
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:37,146
Well, sir, i'll tell you
exactly what i done.

230
00:16:37,181 --> 00:16:40,282
Me and rip, we left the house
long about suppertime,

231
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:42,785
and rip,
he picked up

232
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:45,287
a coon trail
right away,

233
00:16:45,322 --> 00:16:48,157
and like a coon will,
it headed for the water

234
00:16:48,192 --> 00:16:50,042
and rip didn't do nothing

235
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:51,660
but go in
after him.

236
00:16:51,794 --> 00:16:53,662
About that time, i got there,

237
00:16:53,697 --> 00:16:57,416
and i was running out
on this log and i...

238
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:10,679
hey, friend, what's
on the other side

239
00:17:10,714 --> 00:17:12,564
of that gate there?

240
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:14,316
Well, that pasture
right up there

241
00:17:14,351 --> 00:17:16,185
they call
the elysian field.

242
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,820
Cross that and you come
to the golden street

243
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:20,322
that takes you right
to the celestial palace

244
00:17:20,357 --> 00:17:22,191
where the old master
has his headquarters.

245
00:17:22,226 --> 00:17:25,327
Then i take you would aim
to be st. Peter.

246
00:17:25,362 --> 00:17:27,696
I keep the gate, that's a fact.

247
00:17:27,731 --> 00:17:30,582
Well, i'm mighty proud
to have met up with you.

248
00:17:30,617 --> 00:17:32,835
Just as proud to have you here.

249
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:36,205
I always thought

250
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,341
there was a lot of singing
and dancing in heaven.

251
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,844
How come i don't hear no music?

252
00:17:41,879 --> 00:17:43,462
You're on the outside.

253
00:17:43,497 --> 00:17:46,598
Once inside, you'll hear
your favorite hymn.

254
00:17:46,633 --> 00:17:49,968
Well, i don't care much
for hymn singing.

255
00:17:50,003 --> 00:17:51,854
I favor guitar music myself.

256
00:17:51,889 --> 00:17:54,356
Don't stand out here
in the cold, cold world.

257
00:17:54,391 --> 00:17:56,225
Reap your
heavenly reward.

258
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,476
Come on, rip.

259
00:17:57,511 --> 00:17:59,228
Hold on, neighbor.

260
00:17:59,263 --> 00:17:59,862
You can't take
that dog in there.

261
00:17:59,897 --> 00:18:01,730
There ain't no fleas
on that dog.

262
00:18:01,765 --> 00:18:04,233
That don't make no nevermind.
He can't come in.

263
00:18:04,268 --> 00:18:05,234
How come?

264
00:18:05,269 --> 00:18:06,485
This is
folks' heaven.

265
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,488
There's a place we can put him,
though, up the road.

266
00:18:09,523 --> 00:18:11,373
You just tie him
to the fence,

267
00:18:11,408 --> 00:18:13,242
and i'll walk
him up later on.

268
00:18:13,277 --> 00:18:14,493
Come on, rip.

269
00:18:14,528 --> 00:18:16,378
Hold on,
neighbor simpson.

270
00:18:16,413 --> 00:18:18,247
Where do you think
you're going?

271
00:18:18,282 --> 00:18:22,000
Thank you, but i don't reckon
in there is any place for me.

272
00:18:22,035 --> 00:18:23,001
Why not?

273
00:18:23,036 --> 00:18:24,753
Well, any place

274
00:18:24,788 --> 00:18:27,890
that's too highfalutin for rip
is too fancy for me.

275
00:18:27,925 --> 00:18:30,392
How thoroughbred
does a dog have to be

276
00:18:30,427 --> 00:18:32,895
before you let him
in there, anyway?

277
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:35,397
Ain't no dogs allowed at all.

278
00:18:35,432 --> 00:18:38,016
What kind of outfit
don't allow no dogs?

279
00:18:38,051 --> 00:18:40,652
They got that special place
for dogs.

280
00:18:40,687 --> 00:18:42,905
Me and rip will go on
down there, then.

281
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,156
You won't get in.

282
00:18:44,191 --> 00:18:45,908
The dog, maybe, but not you.

283
00:18:45,943 --> 00:18:49,027
What kind of heaven would it be
with just dogs?

284
00:18:49,062 --> 00:18:52,164
A dog's got a right
to have a man around

285
00:18:52,199 --> 00:18:55,918
just the same as a man's got
a right to have a dog around,

286
00:18:55,953 --> 00:18:57,786
if he wants to be happy.

287
00:18:57,821 --> 00:18:59,171
Neighbor, let me make you
a little proposition.

288
00:18:59,206 --> 00:19:02,291
Why don't you go on in the gate,
and a little later on,

289
00:19:02,326 --> 00:19:04,176
i'll slip the dog
through the fence to you.

290
00:19:04,211 --> 00:19:06,044
It's breaking the rules,
but i'll do it.

291
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:08,180
Friend peter,
if i go in that front gate,

292
00:19:08,797 --> 00:19:11,300
rip's going in
that front gate likewise.

293
00:19:11,335 --> 00:19:15,053
I don't want him to get to
feeling that he ain't welcome.

294
00:19:15,088 --> 00:19:16,555
I got another idea.

295
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,056
What are you doing there,
mister?

296
00:19:18,091 --> 00:19:19,942
I'll hold on
to your dog

297
00:19:19,977 --> 00:19:21,810
and let you see
how you like it.

298
00:19:21,845 --> 00:19:24,813
I don't have to go inside
to make up my mind.

299
00:19:24,848 --> 00:19:27,316
Let me ask you
a practical question:

300
00:19:27,351 --> 00:19:31,703
What kind of coon hunting would
i have in there without rip?

301
00:19:31,738 --> 00:19:34,072
Man, they don't allow
no coon hunting.

302
00:19:34,107 --> 00:19:36,575
Oh, you don't say.

303
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:38,460
Where do you think
you're going?

304
00:19:38,495 --> 00:19:39,711
Me and rip's
going somewhere.

305
00:19:39,746 --> 00:19:41,580
There ain't no
place else to go.

306
00:19:41,615 --> 00:19:44,082
We'll go wherever
that road takes us.

307
00:19:44,117 --> 00:19:45,968
Oh, that road
don't lead nowhere.

308
00:19:46,003 --> 00:19:47,586
This is eternity road.

309
00:19:47,621 --> 00:19:50,722
It just keeps on,
never stops, leads nowhere.

310
00:19:50,757 --> 00:19:52,341
Me and rip'll do all right.

311
00:19:52,376 --> 00:19:56,094
Neighbor, this
is a right serious
step you're taking.

312
00:19:56,129 --> 00:19:57,346
I'd say the best thing

313
00:19:57,381 --> 00:19:59,848
is to sit out there
and think it over.

314
00:19:59,883 --> 00:20:02,351
You've got all eternity
to make up your mind.

315
00:20:02,386 --> 00:20:03,352
Good day to you, sir.

316
00:20:03,986 --> 00:20:06,488
If you change your mind,
just let me know.

317
00:20:06,523 --> 00:20:07,739
Much obliged.

318
00:20:07,774 --> 00:20:08,991
I'll do that.

319
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:37,769
Eternity's a powerful
long spell to go

320
00:20:37,804 --> 00:20:40,272
without a coon hunt,
ain't it, rip?

321
00:20:40,307 --> 00:20:44,142
Don't you go off your feed
or nothing over this thing.

322
00:20:44,177 --> 00:20:47,279
Wouldn't surprise me none
if i don't sneak in there

323
00:20:47,314 --> 00:20:49,781
and talk to the judge,
or somebody.

324
00:20:49,816 --> 00:20:52,284
Might be able to get you in.

325
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:56,788
Wonder what kind of a tea party
they keep in there, anyways.

326
00:20:56,823 --> 00:21:00,542
Must be city folks, mostly.

327
00:21:00,577 --> 00:21:04,296
They'd be the ones most likely
to outlaw coon hunting.

328
00:21:04,331 --> 00:21:06,415
Let them sit in there

329
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:07,916
tootin' on their harps

330
00:21:07,951 --> 00:21:11,053
or whatever they do
for relaxation,

331
00:21:11,088 --> 00:21:12,921
me and youse stays together.

332
00:21:12,956 --> 00:21:17,809
Just like we was when
we was traveling down below.

333
00:21:17,844 --> 00:21:21,430
Hmm...

334
00:21:21,465 --> 00:21:22,814
least we ain't
the only ones

335
00:21:22,849 --> 00:21:24,066
wandering
around

336
00:21:24,101 --> 00:21:26,568
by ourselves
on the eternity road.

337
00:21:27,569 --> 00:21:28,820
Howdy, son.

338
00:21:28,855 --> 00:21:30,072
Howdy.

339
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,191
Ah...

340
00:21:33,226 --> 00:21:35,077
i'm looking for
a mr. Hyder simpson

341
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:37,579
and a hound dog
name of rip.

342
00:21:37,614 --> 00:21:38,830
Well, that's us.

343
00:21:38,865 --> 00:21:40,699
Well, i figured it was.

344
00:21:40,734 --> 00:21:42,584
Well, if you
and rip's all set,

345
00:21:42,619 --> 00:21:44,453
we might as well
mosey along.

346
00:21:44,488 --> 00:21:46,204
Mosey along where?

347
00:21:46,239 --> 00:21:48,090
Heaven, mr. Simpson.

348
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:50,959
Well, now, like i told
that other fellow,

349
00:21:50,994 --> 00:21:54,096
i ain't going to set foot
in heaven without rip.

350
00:21:54,131 --> 00:21:56,715
You didn't get messed up
with nobody in there, did you?

351
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,600
That fellow at the gate.

352
00:21:58,635 --> 00:22:01,720
He wouldn't let rip in,
so i didn't go.

353
00:22:01,755 --> 00:22:02,971
Son...

354
00:22:03,006 --> 00:22:05,474
that'd be a hell of a place
without rip.

355
00:22:05,509 --> 00:22:07,359
Mr. Simpson...

356
00:22:07,394 --> 00:22:09,227
you ain't far wrong.

357
00:22:09,262 --> 00:22:11,613
Thatishell.

358
00:22:11,648 --> 00:22:14,116
Heaven's up
yonder apiece.

359
00:22:14,151 --> 00:22:15,367
Well, i'll
be jiggered.

360
00:22:15,402 --> 00:22:17,235
Now, how come
that fellow

361
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:19,121
would want
to lie to me?

362
00:22:19,156 --> 00:22:20,989
Well, they don't
never give up.

363
00:22:21,024 --> 00:22:23,492
Always trying to get
folks in there

364
00:22:23,527 --> 00:22:25,377
right down
to the last minute.

365
00:22:25,412 --> 00:22:27,879
Well, what reason
would they have

366
00:22:27,914 --> 00:22:29,748
for wanting
to keep rip out?

367
00:22:29,783 --> 00:22:32,501
They was a-feared
rip would have warned you.

368
00:22:32,536 --> 00:22:36,254
And he would have, time he got
a whiff of that brimstone.

369
00:22:36,289 --> 00:22:38,507
You see, mr. Simpson,

370
00:22:38,542 --> 00:22:43,261
a man- well, he'll walk right
into hell with both eyes open,

371
00:22:43,296 --> 00:22:46,398
but even the devil
can't fool a dog.

372
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:50,402
You wouldn't be st. Peter,
would you?

373
00:22:50,437 --> 00:22:54,656
Oh, no, no, i... i'm just
a regular angel here.

374
00:22:54,691 --> 00:22:57,159
Well, where's your wings, son?

375
00:22:57,194 --> 00:23:01,029
Shucks, i don't use
them half the time.

376
00:23:01,064 --> 00:23:03,532
I appreciate
walking myself.

377
00:23:03,567 --> 00:23:04,783
You, uh...

378
00:23:04,818 --> 00:23:06,668
about ready to go,
mr. Simpson?

379
00:23:06,703 --> 00:23:09,171
Uh... uh, rip.

380
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:14,793
How's the coon hunting
up here, boy?

381
00:23:14,828 --> 00:23:16,678
Oh, just fine,
mr. Simpson.

382
00:23:16,713 --> 00:23:17,929
There's one tonight

383
00:23:17,964 --> 00:23:19,798
right after
the square dance.

384
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:21,049
Want to come along?

385
00:23:21,084 --> 00:23:22,934
Wouldn't miss it
for the world.

386
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:27,305
Welcome to heaven,
mr. Simpson.

387
00:23:29,057 --> 00:23:30,942
Thank you, son.

388
00:23:30,977 --> 00:23:33,445
Right proud to be here.

389
00:23:35,313 --> 00:23:37,816
Uh, rachel-
that's my old woman-

390
00:23:37,851 --> 00:23:39,701
she won't have any trouble

391
00:23:39,736 --> 00:23:43,455
getting past that fellow
up the road, will she?

392
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:45,207
Rachel? No, not her.

393
00:23:45,242 --> 00:23:48,960
And she'll be along
directly, too, i'm told.

394
00:23:48,995 --> 00:23:51,079
Well, glad to hear it.

395
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:54,332
Come along, rip.

396
00:23:54,367 --> 00:23:58,086
Travelers to unknown regions
would be well advised

397
00:23:58,121 --> 00:24:00,589
to take along the family dog.

398
00:24:00,624 --> 00:24:04,342
He could just save you
from entering the wrong gate.

399
00:24:04,377 --> 00:24:06,845
At least,
it happened that way once

400
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,981
in a mountainous area
of the twilight zone.

401
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:16,438
Rod serling,
creator ofthe twilight zone,

402
00:24:16,473 --> 00:24:18,940
will tell you
about next week's story

403
00:24:18,975 --> 00:24:22,027
after this message.

404
00:24:22,577 --> 00:24:24,079
And now, mr. Serling.

405
00:24:24,114 --> 00:24:26,581
Next week we offer you
a hollywood television cowboy

406
00:24:26,616 --> 00:24:29,701
who takes in several bills
a week for killing off bad men.

407
00:24:29,736 --> 00:24:32,204
Mr. Larry blyden portrays
one of these phony balonies

408
00:24:32,838 --> 00:24:34,089
who always wins in the end.

409
00:24:34,124 --> 00:24:36,591
But in this little item
he draws from the hip

410
00:24:36,626 --> 00:24:39,711
and realizes his opponent
is smack-dab out of this world.

411
00:24:39,746 --> 00:24:42,214
We invite your attention to
"showdown with rance mcgrew,"

412
00:24:42,848 --> 00:24:47,219
next week's stagecoach sojourn
in the twilight zone.

413
00:25:16,731 --> 00:25:19,217
This is an age
of amazing feats,

414
00:25:19,252 --> 00:25:22,837
and the fuel
that has kept us going is faith.

415
00:25:22,872 --> 00:25:24,973
Worship together this week.
