1
00:00:06,606 --> 00:00:09,726
You unlock this door
with the key of imagination.

2
00:00:09,761 --> 00:00:12,228
Beyond it is another dimension-

3
00:00:12,263 --> 00:00:12,862
a dimension of sound,

4
00:00:14,149 --> 00:00:16,616
a dimension of sight,

5
00:00:16,651 --> 00:00:18,485
a dimension of mind.

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,621
You're moving into a land
of both shadow and substance,

7
00:00:21,656 --> 00:00:22,872
of things and ideas.

8
00:00:22,907 --> 00:00:26,626
You've just crossed over
into the twilight zone.

9
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:39,005
Oliver pope by name,

10
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,508
office manager by profession.

11
00:00:41,543 --> 00:00:44,010
A man beset by life's problems:

12
00:00:44,045 --> 00:00:46,513
His job, his salary,
the competition to get ahead.

13
00:00:48,765 --> 00:00:52,652
Obviously mr. Pope's mind
is not on his driving.

14
00:01:24,801 --> 00:01:26,936
Stop! Stop!

15
00:01:28,805 --> 00:01:31,191
Oliver pope,
businessman turned killer

16
00:01:31,226 --> 00:01:32,442
on a rain-soaked street

17
00:01:32,477 --> 00:01:33,693
in the early evening
of just another day

18
00:01:33,728 --> 00:01:36,196
during just another drive home
from the office.

19
00:01:36,231 --> 00:01:39,315
The victim, a kid on a bicycle,
lying injured, near death.

20
00:01:39,949 --> 00:01:41,818
But mr. Pope hasn't time
for the victim.

21
00:01:41,853 --> 00:01:43,703
His only concern is for himself.

22
00:01:43,738 --> 00:01:46,573
Oliver pope,
hit-and-run driver,

23
00:01:46,608 --> 00:01:49,075
just arrived
at a crossroad in his life,

24
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,578
and he's chosen the wrong turn.

25
00:01:51,613 --> 00:01:53,463
The hit occurred
in the world he knows,

26
00:01:53,498 --> 00:01:58,468
but the run will lead him
straight into the twilight zone.

27
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:17,320
How come you put
the car away?

28
00:02:17,355 --> 00:02:19,823
I thought we were
going to a movie.

29
00:02:19,858 --> 00:02:21,691
Oh, no, i've
got a headache.

30
00:02:21,726 --> 00:02:26,079
Aw. Bad day
at the office, ollie?

31
00:02:26,114 --> 00:02:29,833
Yeah, yeah,
they're all bad.

32
00:02:34,204 --> 00:02:36,706
You know that
pete radcliff?

33
00:02:36,741 --> 00:02:39,209
Well, he's after my job.

34
00:02:39,244 --> 00:02:41,094
He didn't impress me

35
00:02:41,129 --> 00:02:42,962
as that kind of
fella at all.

36
00:02:42,997 --> 00:02:45,465
Please, why do you
have to disagree

37
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,716
with everything
i say?

38
00:02:46,751 --> 00:02:49,853
Oh, now, ollie, you're
just tired and cross.

39
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,978
You've got a headache,

40
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:02,732
and you just take this
and you'll feel better.

41
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:07,120
What are you doing?

42
00:03:07,155 --> 00:03:08,988
Seeing if you've
got a fever.

43
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:10,240
You might have caught
that flu bug

44
00:03:10,275 --> 00:03:12,125
that's been going around.

45
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:12,742
I'm all right.
I'm all right.

46
00:03:13,376 --> 00:03:14,627
Please just
leave me alone.

47
00:03:14,662 --> 00:03:15,879
Stop fussing
over me.

48
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:25,889
Ollie...

49
00:03:25,924 --> 00:03:27,757
ollie, somebody's
fooling around

50
00:03:27,792 --> 00:03:29,008
out in the garage.

51
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:30,260
In the...

52
00:03:32,762 --> 00:03:34,013
i'll go take a look.

53
00:03:40,904 --> 00:03:42,772
Who's out there?

54
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:37,710
What was it?

55
00:04:37,745 --> 00:04:40,213
Uh, nobody there.

56
00:04:40,248 --> 00:04:41,464
What was that
light i saw?

57
00:04:41,499 --> 00:04:43,333
Well, it was
the car itself.

58
00:04:43,368 --> 00:04:45,835
A faulty connection
or something.

59
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:48,972
The lights kept going on
and off by themselves.

60
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:51,724
A car shouldn't act like that.

61
00:04:52,342 --> 00:04:56,095
I just paid the repair shop
$35 to have it put into shape.

62
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:58,348
Didn't see
the paper

63
00:04:58,383 --> 00:05:00,850
while you were
out there, did you?

64
00:05:00,885 --> 00:05:02,101
No.

65
00:05:02,136 --> 00:05:02,986
Boy's late.

66
00:05:03,021 --> 00:05:04,854
I guess it's the rain.

67
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:14,113
There was an accident
this evening

68
00:05:14,148 --> 00:05:16,616
at the corner of third and park.

69
00:05:17,867 --> 00:05:23,506
Could you... uh, well,
i'm a friend of the family's.

70
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:26,626
Could you tell me,
how is the boy?

71
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:31,014
Yes.

72
00:05:32,882 --> 00:05:34,767
Uh... terrible.

73
00:05:56,074 --> 00:05:59,158
Ollie, what on
earth is that?

74
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:04,797
Must be some jerk
waking people up

75
00:06:04,832 --> 00:06:07,300
in the middle
of the night.

76
00:06:07,335 --> 00:06:09,802
Ollie, that'syourhorn.

77
00:07:02,972 --> 00:07:05,475
Isn't it terrible
about that little boy?

78
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:06,726
Only 12 years old,

79
00:07:06,761 --> 00:07:08,611
and they don't
expect him to live.

80
00:07:08,646 --> 00:07:10,480
I hope they find
the man who did it

81
00:07:10,515 --> 00:07:12,982
so they can give him
what's coming to him.

82
00:07:13,017 --> 00:07:14,233
How do you know
it was a man?

83
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:16,119
Didn't you get
that far?

84
00:07:16,154 --> 00:07:17,370
There was a witness.

85
00:07:17,405 --> 00:07:19,238
How do you expect
to do a day's work

86
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:21,124
on one little
piece of toast?

87
00:07:21,159 --> 00:07:23,626
Well... i'm not
going to go

88
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:26,746
to the office
today, lil, i...

89
00:07:26,781 --> 00:07:28,631
i don't feel
very well.

90
00:07:31,134 --> 00:07:33,002
Okay, lie down then.

91
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,756
I thought
you fixed that.

92
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:38,007
I did.

93
00:07:38,042 --> 00:07:39,258
You're sure there
wasn't somebody

94
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:39,892
in the garage
last night?

95
00:07:39,927 --> 00:07:41,144
I told you,
it's that car-

96
00:07:41,179 --> 00:07:43,012
it's old car, nothing
about it works right.

97
00:07:43,047 --> 00:07:44,263
We've had a lot
of old cars

98
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:46,149
that didn't go
honking their heads off

99
00:07:46,184 --> 00:07:46,766
in the middle
of the night.

100
00:07:46,801 --> 00:07:48,017
I'm going to
get rid of it.

101
00:07:48,052 --> 00:07:49,902
Well, i'm going down
and have it looked at.

102
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:44,824
Yes, yes, third and park.

103
00:08:44,859 --> 00:08:47,326
Well, i don't know
what's the matter.

104
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:50,463
It just stopped
and it won't start again.

105
00:08:50,498 --> 00:08:52,965
Could you please send
a tow truck right away?

106
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:55,468
I'm in the middle of the street.

107
00:09:11,769 --> 00:09:13,603
Lil, what took you so long?

108
00:09:13,638 --> 00:09:15,488
I never...
i never had such a morning

109
00:09:15,523 --> 00:09:17,356
in my life-
that car...

110
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:18,608
well, what about the car?

111
00:09:18,643 --> 00:09:19,859
Well, it's
in the repair shop.

112
00:09:19,894 --> 00:09:21,110
I had to take a cab home.

113
00:09:21,145 --> 00:09:22,361
What happened?

114
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:24,247
The strangest thing
i've ever seen.

115
00:09:24,282 --> 00:09:26,115
It all started down here
at the corner.

116
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,366
I wanted to turn right.

117
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,503
I could not make that wheel turn
the way i wanted to go.

118
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,371
And then finally,
the car stalls

119
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:34,257
at the intersection
of third and park.

120
00:09:34,292 --> 00:09:35,508
Stalled?
Yes, the motor died.

121
00:09:35,543 --> 00:09:38,010
There i was right
in the middle of the street,

122
00:09:38,045 --> 00:09:39,262
blocking traffic.

123
00:09:39,297 --> 00:09:41,130
Why, even the police
couldn't get it started.

124
00:09:41,165 --> 00:09:42,014
What were the
police doing there?

125
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:43,266
Oh, they weren't
after me.

126
00:09:43,301 --> 00:09:45,134
It's the same corner
where that little child

127
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:46,385
was run down last night.

128
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,888
Police said to keep a look out
in case the criminal

129
00:09:48,923 --> 00:09:50,773
returns to the scene
of the crime.

130
00:09:50,808 --> 00:09:52,642
Did they say
if they had any leads?

131
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:54,143
Well, yes, they're
getting close to an arrest.

132
00:09:54,178 --> 00:09:55,394
I hope they get him.

133
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:57,280
Nobody's safe with a
madman like that around.

134
00:09:59,183 --> 00:10:00,399
I thought you said

135
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:03,536
the... the car
was in the repair shop.

136
00:10:03,571 --> 00:10:04,787
Well, it is.

137
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:15,298
What are you
trying to do?

138
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:17,166
What are you
talking about?

139
00:10:17,201 --> 00:10:19,051
You said the car was
in the repair shop.

140
00:10:19,669 --> 00:10:20,303
Well, it was.

141
00:10:20,338 --> 00:10:22,805
What's it doing here?

142
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:25,925
Wait a minute.

143
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,176
I'll get it.

144
00:10:32,181 --> 00:10:33,432
Hello?

145
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:35,318
Yes, yes, speaking.

146
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:39,071
No, i didn't pick it up.

147
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,191
Yes.

148
00:10:42,226 --> 00:10:44,076
Yes, i know where it is.

149
00:10:44,111 --> 00:10:45,328
It's right here.

150
00:10:45,363 --> 00:10:47,830
Didn't one of your
men deliver it?

151
00:10:49,699 --> 00:10:52,201
No, no, no, i don't
understand it either,

152
00:10:52,236 --> 00:10:54,704
but i'd like you to
understand one thing.

153
00:10:54,739 --> 00:10:56,589
Don't bother
to send me a bill.

154
00:10:56,624 --> 00:10:59,709
You didn't have the car
down there long enough

155
00:10:59,744 --> 00:11:00,960
to even look it over.

156
00:11:00,995 --> 00:11:03,462
What do you think
about that?

157
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:05,348
Was that the mechanic?

158
00:11:05,383 --> 00:11:07,216
They said
they lost the car.

159
00:11:07,251 --> 00:11:08,467
The nerve of that guy.

160
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:10,353
It's not lost,
it's right here.

161
00:11:10,388 --> 00:11:12,855
Will you explain to me
how it got here?

162
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:14,106
They didn't deliver it.

163
00:11:14,141 --> 00:11:15,975
Well, it didn't
drive itself home.

164
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,729
Wait a minute,
don't answer that.

165
00:11:19,764 --> 00:11:21,614
Well, why not?

166
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:24,116
Well, uh, all right,
but if it's for me,

167
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:25,368
just say
that i'm not home.

168
00:11:25,403 --> 00:11:27,236
Ollie, what on earth
is frightening you?

169
00:11:27,271 --> 00:11:28,487
Nothing, nothing.

170
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:31,624
I just don't feel like
seeing anybody, that's all.

171
00:11:31,659 --> 00:11:32,875
I don't know what it is,

172
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:35,378
but if you don't get over
these heebie-jeebies,

173
00:11:35,413 --> 00:11:36,629
i'm calling a doctor.

174
00:11:42,251 --> 00:11:43,502
Morning,
mrs. Pope.

175
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:45,388
Well, what
a nice surprise.

176
00:11:45,423 --> 00:11:46,639
Ollie here?

177
00:11:46,674 --> 00:11:48,507
Yes, he's in
the living room.

178
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:49,759
Can i see him?

179
00:11:49,794 --> 00:11:51,010
Yes, just
for a minute.

180
00:11:51,045 --> 00:11:53,512
He's kind of under
the weather today.

181
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:54,764
It's nothing
serious.

182
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:56,649
I think he's
just got

183
00:11:56,684 --> 00:11:57,900
a touch
of the flu.

184
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:00,403
Guess who's here.

185
00:12:00,438 --> 00:12:01,654
Ollie, boy.

186
00:12:01,689 --> 00:12:02,905
Oh.

187
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,774
I hear the flu bug
got you down.

188
00:12:04,809 --> 00:12:06,659
Well, no, no,
not quite.

189
00:12:06,694 --> 00:12:08,527
I'll be back
in the morning.

190
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:09,779
Well, i hope so.

191
00:12:09,814 --> 00:12:12,281
Gets kind of dull
down there without you.

192
00:12:12,915 --> 00:12:13,532
Oh?

193
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:15,418
What brings you
out here, pete?

194
00:12:15,453 --> 00:12:18,537
When you didn't
show up at the office,

195
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:19,789
i thought i'd clear
up your "in" basket.

196
00:12:20,923 --> 00:12:23,426
Keep your hands off of my desk.

197
00:12:23,461 --> 00:12:27,179
I've got some very important
correspondence in that basket.

198
00:12:27,214 --> 00:12:29,932
Not anymore, i took care of it.

199
00:12:29,967 --> 00:12:31,183
Your letters, sir,

200
00:12:31,218 --> 00:12:34,303
all answered
and waiting for your signature.

201
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:38,557
All answered...

202
00:12:39,442 --> 00:12:41,310
ollie!

203
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:44,447
I'm sorry, ollie, i...

204
00:12:44,482 --> 00:12:46,949
only wanted
to do you a favor.

205
00:12:46,984 --> 00:12:48,567
You can do me a favor.

206
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:51,070
Quit bucking for my job, huh?

207
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:55,825
I take one morning off
and you start making noises

208
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:58,327
likeyou're
the head of the department.

209
00:12:58,362 --> 00:12:59,829
You got it wrong, ollie.

210
00:12:59,864 --> 00:13:02,331
I was only trying to help you.

211
00:13:02,366 --> 00:13:04,467
I didn't want things
to pile up on you.

212
00:13:04,502 --> 00:13:05,718
Don't try.

213
00:13:05,753 --> 00:13:07,336
You listen to me.

214
00:13:07,371 --> 00:13:09,839
You think i enjoyed
sitting in that office

215
00:13:09,874 --> 00:13:11,724
dictating your lousy letters?

216
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:14,226
I got better things
to do, buddy boy.

217
00:13:14,261 --> 00:13:15,978
Nobody's holding you here.

218
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,348
Go do them.

219
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:23,102
You bet i will.

220
00:13:24,353 --> 00:13:25,604
Pete...

221
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:29,358
i'm sorry, i...

222
00:13:29,393 --> 00:13:33,112
shouldn't have blown up
at him like that.

223
00:13:33,147 --> 00:13:36,866
Last night, a kid on our block
was run down.

224
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,502
I knew him.

225
00:13:39,537 --> 00:13:40,753
He used to
come over

226
00:13:40,788 --> 00:13:42,621
and play
with my kids.

227
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:47,376
There was one nice, decent,
fun-loving, ambitious little kid

228
00:13:47,411 --> 00:13:49,879
and some maniac
smashed into him

229
00:13:49,914 --> 00:13:52,381
and left him lying there
in the rain.

230
00:13:53,015 --> 00:13:53,632
I know.

231
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:55,518
We've been
reading about it

232
00:13:55,553 --> 00:13:56,769
in the papers.

233
00:13:56,804 --> 00:13:58,020
Terrible shame.

234
00:13:58,055 --> 00:14:00,523
Well, they're watching
the corner.

235
00:14:00,558 --> 00:14:03,025
He'll show up,
they always do.

236
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,894
You don't happen
to know

237
00:14:04,929 --> 00:14:07,396
how the little boy's
getting on, do you?

238
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:10,032
He died,
mrs. Pope.

239
00:14:10,067 --> 00:14:11,283
About an hour ago.

240
00:14:11,901 --> 00:14:13,152
Oh...

241
00:14:14,403 --> 00:14:15,654
well...

242
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:20,042
i'll see you
to the door.

243
00:14:29,051 --> 00:14:30,302
I think that's him.

244
00:14:30,337 --> 00:14:32,805
That won't do,
you have to be sure.

245
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,673
That's him, i'm sure.

246
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,559
Wait here.

247
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:11,710
Could i see your
driver's license please?

248
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:13,596
Sure.

249
00:15:13,631 --> 00:15:14,847
Mind if i ask why?

250
00:15:14,882 --> 00:15:16,715
Where were you
last night at 6:15?

251
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,601
Home with my wife
and kids.

252
00:15:18,636 --> 00:15:21,720
I got a witness
says you're wrong.

253
00:15:33,816 --> 00:15:36,952
Ollie, what on
earth's the matter?

254
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:38,821
Oliver?

255
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:42,324
They arrested
that hit-and-run driver, lil.

256
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:43,709
Well, i'm glad to hear it

257
00:15:43,744 --> 00:15:46,211
but is that any reason for you
to look white as a ghost?

258
00:15:46,246 --> 00:15:48,964
The man they arrested
was pete radcliff.

259
00:15:48,999 --> 00:15:51,834
Oh, i don't believe that.

260
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:53,469
Here, read for yourself.

261
00:15:53,504 --> 00:15:56,588
Positively identified
by an eyewitness

262
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:58,474
at the scene of the accident.

263
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:01,093
I still can't believe it.

264
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:04,847
You can tell if a man
would do a thing like that.

265
00:16:04,882 --> 00:16:06,732
Pete just isn't the type.

266
00:16:06,767 --> 00:16:09,101
You don't know him
as well as i do.

267
00:16:09,136 --> 00:16:10,853
Well, i suppose not.

268
00:16:10,888 --> 00:16:13,355
You always have said
he was sneaky-

269
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,240
after your job
and all.

270
00:16:15,275 --> 00:16:18,360
I don't have to worry
about that anymore.

271
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:20,863
Well, how can you
take satisfaction

272
00:16:20,898 --> 00:16:22,748
out of somebody
else's misfortune?

273
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:25,868
I don't mean i got any
pleasure out of it.

274
00:16:25,903 --> 00:16:28,370
I mean, i don't have
to worry about things

275
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:30,255
down at the
office anymore.

276
00:16:31,542 --> 00:16:34,009
Now, thereissomebody
out in that garage.

277
00:16:34,044 --> 00:16:36,512
I am not imagining it
this time.

278
00:16:36,547 --> 00:16:37,763
There's nobody
out there.

279
00:16:37,798 --> 00:16:39,014
Are you going to look?

280
00:16:39,049 --> 00:16:41,517
That noise could have
come from anywhere.

281
00:16:41,552 --> 00:16:42,768
It came
from the garage.

282
00:16:43,385 --> 00:16:45,270
If you're afraid,
i'll call the police.

283
00:16:45,305 --> 00:16:47,139
No- no.

284
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:49,641
I'll go.

285
00:17:08,911 --> 00:17:10,796
Who's in here?

286
00:17:27,062 --> 00:17:29,565
)
No... no...

287
00:17:55,457 --> 00:17:57,342
ollie?

288
00:17:57,377 --> 00:17:59,211
Ollie!

289
00:17:59,246 --> 00:18:00,462
What?

290
00:18:00,497 --> 00:18:02,347
Some nut's got
his radio on

291
00:18:02,382 --> 00:18:03,599
as high
as it'll go.

292
00:18:03,634 --> 00:18:04,850
It seems to me

293
00:18:04,885 --> 00:18:07,352
like it's coming
from the cassidys'.

294
00:18:07,387 --> 00:18:09,855
Oh?

295
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:24,987
Hey...

296
00:18:25,022 --> 00:18:26,238
hey, you over there.

297
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:28,123
People are trying to sleep.

298
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:32,494
Look, pipe down, will you?

299
00:18:35,631 --> 00:18:37,749
Lil, i...

300
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:39,635
i don't guess
they hear me.

301
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:42,754
I better go down there
and talk to them.

302
00:18:53,433 --> 00:18:55,267
And now five minutes
of the late news.

303
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:56,518
An arrest has been made

304
00:18:56,553 --> 00:18:59,021
in the case of the driver
who yesterday ran away

305
00:18:59,056 --> 00:19:00,906

00:19:00,941 --> 00:19:04,026

307
00:19:04,061 --> 00:19:07,779
has been positively identified
by mrs. Muriel hastings,

308
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:09,031

309
00:19:09,066 --> 00:19:10,282
at the intersection
of third and elm.

310
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,784
Funeral services for the victim

311
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:15,287
tomorrow afternoon
at trinity church.

312
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:25,297
And now five minutes
of the late news.

313
00:19:25,332 --> 00:19:26,548
An arrest has been made

314
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:29,685
in the case of the driver
who yesterday ran away

315
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,187
after fatally injuring

316
00:19:32,222 --> 00:19:35,307
The suspect, peter radcliff
of 509 harboro street,

317
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:37,809
has been...

318
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:27,242
oh, i was going
to surprise you

319
00:20:27,277 --> 00:20:29,111
with breakfast
in bed.

320
00:20:29,146 --> 00:20:31,613
Oh... i'm not
an invalid, lil.

321
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:33,498
And i'm not
hungry either.

322
00:20:33,533 --> 00:20:36,001
You know, i still think you
ought to call the police.

323
00:20:36,036 --> 00:20:37,252
Why, honey?

324
00:20:37,287 --> 00:20:39,755
Well, to find out
about those prowlers
in the garage.

325
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:41,006
It's been two
nights running now.

326
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:42,257
I'll tell you
what i'll do.

327
00:20:42,292 --> 00:20:44,126
When i get back
from work tonight,

328
00:20:44,161 --> 00:20:46,011
i'll put a lock
on that garage door.

329
00:20:46,628 --> 00:20:47,262
Bye-bye.

330
00:20:47,297 --> 00:20:49,765
Oh, ollie,
you better take a raincoat.

331
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,016
Radio said it might rain.

332
00:20:51,051 --> 00:20:53,518
Oh, lil, it's not
going to rain.

333
00:20:53,553 --> 00:20:55,387
Now don't you
stay down there working

334
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:56,638
if you get tired.

335
00:20:56,673 --> 00:20:57,889
You come on home.

336
00:20:57,924 --> 00:20:59,775
All right, lil,
all right, i will.

337
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:01,026
Aren't you going
to drive?

338
00:21:01,061 --> 00:21:02,894
Well, i thought i
would take the bus.

339
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:04,780
Why?

340
00:21:04,815 --> 00:21:07,282
Well, i don't
trust that car.

341
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:09,151
I mean, it's
falling apart.

342
00:21:09,186 --> 00:21:11,036
Well, you just gonna
leave it in the garage?

343
00:21:11,071 --> 00:21:14,156
No, no. I thought i'd
put an ad in the paper.

344
00:21:14,191 --> 00:21:16,658
Somebody will take
it off our hands.

345
00:21:16,693 --> 00:21:18,543
Bye-bye, lil.

346
00:21:18,578 --> 00:21:20,412
