00:00:10,045 --> 00:00:12,512
You're traveling
through another dimension,

2
00:00:12,547 --> 00:00:15,515
a dimension not only
of sight and sound, but of mind

3
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,517
a journey into a wondrous land

4
00:00:17,552 --> 00:00:20,020
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

5
00:00:20,055 --> 00:00:22,022
That's the signpost up ahead.

6
00:00:22,057 --> 00:00:24,024
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

7
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:33,033
All right, mother,

8
00:00:33,068 --> 00:00:35,535
remember, the rule
of the house today is

9
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:38,538
the moment this is over,
you go back upstairs.

10
00:00:38,573 --> 00:00:40,040
That's fine, chris.

11
00:00:40,075 --> 00:00:41,541
You know i
always follow

12
00:00:41,576 --> 00:00:43,543
the rules
of the house...

13
00:00:43,578 --> 00:00:46,546
except when i don't
agree with them.

14
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:58,158
Hey, you haven't
got your hat on.

15
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:01,161
Grandma!

16
00:01:01,196 --> 00:01:04,664
My angel!

17
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:06,966
Mother, you know
the doctor told you

18
00:01:07,001 --> 00:01:08,468
not to exert yourself.

19
00:01:08,868 --> 00:01:11,871
Oh! I don't exert.

20
00:01:11,906 --> 00:01:14,374
Billy is a feather.

21
00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:16,076
Chris... chris,
get the lights.

22
00:01:16,111 --> 00:01:17,577
Everybody sit down.

23
00:01:17,612 --> 00:01:19,079
All right.

24
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,081
Billy,
shut your eyes.

25
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:22,582
Here, mother.

26
00:01:22,617 --> 00:01:25,085
Don't open them
till i tell you to.

27
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,586
Happy birthday,
billy.

28
00:01:26,621 --> 00:01:28,588
Open them!
Happy birthday!

29
00:01:28,623 --> 00:01:29,589
Happy birthday,
billy!

30
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,092
Isn't that
beautiful?

31
00:01:32,127 --> 00:01:33,593
No, no, no, no,
wait, billy.

32
00:01:33,628 --> 00:01:35,095
Wait, my boy.

33
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:37,597
First you have to
blow out the candles

34
00:01:37,632 --> 00:01:39,099
or it's no good.

35
00:01:39,134 --> 00:01:42,602
Now, you take
a deep breath, like...

36
00:01:42,637 --> 00:01:45,105
and then blow them out,
all of them.

37
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:48,608
Good, good!

38
00:01:48,643 --> 00:01:49,609
Good boy.

39
00:01:49,644 --> 00:01:51,111
You make a wish?

40
00:01:51,146 --> 00:01:52,612
What was it?

41
00:01:52,647 --> 00:01:54,714
You tell grandma, ja?

42
00:01:54,749 --> 00:01:57,717
Don't you think we could
all hear the wish, billy?

43
00:01:57,752 --> 00:02:01,721
No, that's a secret
between him and me.

44
00:02:01,756 --> 00:02:04,224
Isn't that so?

45
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:06,226
Now... mm!

46
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:08,728
Oh, mother,

47
00:02:08,763 --> 00:02:11,231
why don't you let syl
cut the cake, huh?

48
00:02:11,266 --> 00:02:14,234
You think i'm too old
to cut a cake, eh?

49
00:02:14,269 --> 00:02:16,736
When i am that old

50
00:02:16,771 --> 00:02:20,740
you get the shovel
and dig the hole.

51
00:02:20,775 --> 00:02:22,742
Shovel!

52
00:02:22,777 --> 00:02:24,744
Yes, my angel!

53
00:02:24,779 --> 00:02:27,247
Oh... oh, billy!

54
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:29,749
Oh, darling.

55
00:02:29,784 --> 00:02:31,751
Oh, my angel.

56
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:35,755
I am so happy.

57
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:38,758
My heart is full, i...

58
00:02:38,793 --> 00:02:40,260
i like to say something.

59
00:02:40,295 --> 00:02:42,262
Could i say something?

60
00:02:42,297 --> 00:02:43,263
Sure.

61
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:48,768
My little billy-

62
00:02:48,803 --> 00:02:52,772
my wonderful little boy.

63
00:02:52,807 --> 00:02:54,774
He gave me life again.

64
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:57,277
An old woman

65
00:02:57,312 --> 00:03:02,282
good for nothing no
more but to complain.

66
00:03:02,317 --> 00:03:04,984
He held out his hands to me
and...

67
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:09,489
made me alive.

68
00:03:09,524 --> 00:03:11,991
Why are you
crying, grandma?

69
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:15,495
I don't know, my angel.

70
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:17,997
Maybe because i won't
be here with you

71
00:03:18,032 --> 00:03:19,499
for very long.

72
00:03:19,534 --> 00:03:22,202
Why?

73
00:03:22,237 --> 00:03:24,204
I will be away.

74
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:25,205
Where?

75
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,706
Nowhere, billy.

76
00:03:26,741 --> 00:03:28,208
Grandma's going to be right here
next year

77
00:03:28,243 --> 00:03:29,709
and the year after that.

78
00:03:29,744 --> 00:03:33,413
No... don't lie to him.

79
00:03:33,448 --> 00:03:35,415
I will be gone.

80
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:37,417
It's time for presents.

81
00:03:37,452 --> 00:03:39,419
Come on, billy!

82
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,421
Gram,
i wish you...

83
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:43,923
is anything wrong?

84
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:46,926
No, it...

85
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:49,429
just a little
short of breath.

86
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,032
Bang!

87
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:54,033
Bang, bang!

88
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:55,535
How do you
like that, huh?

89
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:56,536
This is the one

90
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:58,538
i want you
to open next.

91
00:03:58,573 --> 00:03:59,539
Wait till
you see it.

92
00:03:59,574 --> 00:04:02,041
This is the one
you asked for, remember?

93
00:04:02,076 --> 00:04:05,545
Billy, don't you want to see
what grandma got you?

94
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,547
Oh, boy!

95
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:17,557
A telephone!

96
00:04:17,592 --> 00:04:20,059
For us, billy-
for you and me.

97
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:22,061
So you can always talk
to grandma

98
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:24,564
even when she's not here-
anytime.

99
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:26,866
Can i talk
to grandma now?

100
00:04:26,901 --> 00:04:28,868
Good... go ahead.

101
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:31,371
Hello.

102
00:04:31,406 --> 00:04:34,374
Is there somebody who
wants to talk to grandma?

103
00:04:34,409 --> 00:04:35,875
It's me!

104
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,377
Who are you?

105
00:04:37,412 --> 00:04:39,379
It's me, billy!

106
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,783
Oh, billy...

107
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,292
take me upstairs now, chris.

108
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,294
Don't you
want to play?

109
00:04:54,329 --> 00:04:55,795
I want to, billy.

110
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,797
You just talk
on the telephone-

111
00:04:57,832 --> 00:04:59,299
i will hear you.

112
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,805
Don't be sick, grandma.

113
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,807
Don't be sick.

114
00:05:07,842 --> 00:05:09,809
This is me, billy.

115
00:05:09,844 --> 00:05:11,811
Please don't be sick.

116
00:05:11,846 --> 00:05:13,813
As must be obvious,

117
00:05:13,848 --> 00:05:16,316
this is a house hovered over
by mr. Death,

118
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,318
that omnipresent player

119
00:05:18,353 --> 00:05:20,820
to the third and final act
of every life.

120
00:05:20,855 --> 00:05:23,823
And it's been said,
and probably rightfully so

121
00:05:23,858 --> 00:05:25,825
that what follows this life

122
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,328
is one of the unfathomable
mysteries-

123
00:05:28,363 --> 00:05:33,132
an area of darkness which we
the living reserve for the dead.

124
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:35,134
Or so it is said.

125
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:38,638
For in a moment, a child
will try to cross that bridge

126
00:05:38,673 --> 00:05:41,140
which separates
light and shadow.

127
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:44,143
And of course he must take
the only known route:

128
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:48,147
That indistinct highway
through the region we call

129
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:50,149
the twilight zone.

130
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:08,267
I want to see grandma.

131
00:06:08,302 --> 00:06:11,270
Oh, honey, we can't
see her right now

132
00:06:11,305 --> 00:06:15,775
because she... she's
not feeling very well.

133
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:28,588
She isn't in any pain.

134
00:06:28,623 --> 00:06:30,089
Can we see her?

135
00:06:30,124 --> 00:06:32,091
Well, i wouldn't advise it,
not that it would hurt her,

136
00:06:32,126 --> 00:06:34,594
but i... i don't think
she'd even recognize you.

137
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:37,096
Oh, we'd recognize her.

138
00:06:37,131 --> 00:06:39,599
All right, chris.

139
00:06:39,634 --> 00:06:42,602
Honey, you might as well
put him to bed. Yeah.

140
00:06:42,637 --> 00:06:44,604
I want to see grandma.

141
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,607
Billy,
try to understand this.

142
00:06:47,642 --> 00:06:49,108
Your grandmother's sick.

143
00:06:49,143 --> 00:06:51,110
She's very sick.

144
00:06:51,145 --> 00:06:53,112
So why don't you wait
till she gets well again.

145
00:06:53,147 --> 00:06:55,114
I want to see her now.

146
00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:56,616
Come on, honey,
don't do that.

147
00:06:56,651 --> 00:06:58,618
Come on now.

148
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:04,123
Well, all right, billy,
just for a minute.

149
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:10,129
Billy...

150
00:07:10,164 --> 00:07:12,632
if your grandmother
acts kind of strange

151
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:16,135
remember, it's just
because of all the medicine.

152
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:20,139
Here... blow
your nose.

153
00:07:20,174 --> 00:07:21,641
Good boy.

154
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:30,650
The family would
like to see her now.

155
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:48,568
Grandma!

156
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:53,573
My angel...

157
00:07:53,608 --> 00:07:57,076
are you sick, grandma?

158
00:07:57,111 --> 00:07:59,078
Not no more.

159
00:07:59,113 --> 00:08:02,582
Then why don't you get up?

160
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,585
Hello, ma.

161
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:08,588
Who are you?

162
00:08:08,623 --> 00:08:12,592
I'm your son, chris.

163
00:08:12,627 --> 00:08:13,593
Your son.

164
00:08:13,628 --> 00:08:16,596
No... no.

165
00:08:16,631 --> 00:08:22,602
My son was taken away...
from me by a woman.

166
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:28,608
This is my son now-

167
00:08:28,643 --> 00:08:31,611
billy, my son.

168
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:39,819
What's the matter,
grandma?

169
00:08:39,854 --> 00:08:43,322
It will be so lonely.

170
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:47,827
I wish you could go
with grandma, billy.

171
00:08:47,862 --> 00:08:49,328
Where?

172
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:52,131
Away...

173
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:56,135
far away, billy.

174
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:59,639
Together, the two of us.

175
00:08:59,674 --> 00:09:04,644
Just you and me, billy.

176
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:08,147
No one else.

177
00:09:08,182 --> 00:09:11,150
Just you and...

178
00:09:11,185 --> 00:09:13,152
me.

179
00:09:13,187 --> 00:09:15,154
Grandma.

180
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:19,258
Grandma!

181
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:46,285
Billy!

182
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,787
Billy?

183
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,292
Billy, didn't you
hear me calling you?

184
00:09:53,327 --> 00:09:54,794
No.

185
00:09:54,829 --> 00:09:56,796
You know you're
not supposed to play

186
00:09:56,831 --> 00:09:57,797
so close to the pond.

187
00:09:57,832 --> 00:09:59,298
What are you doing?

188
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:01,300
Looking at the fishes.

189
00:10:01,335 --> 00:10:02,802
Well, it's getting cold.

190
00:10:02,837 --> 00:10:04,303
Let's go inside now.

191
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:10,810
What's that?

192
00:10:10,845 --> 00:10:12,311
Your grandmother's
bracelet.

193
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:14,313
Honey, why
don't you go up

194
00:10:14,348 --> 00:10:16,816
and play in your room
for a while, huh?

195
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:21,821
Chris...

196
00:10:21,856 --> 00:10:23,823
what's the matter?

197
00:10:23,858 --> 00:10:25,324
Oh, it's...
it's billy.

198
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:28,327
He's been walking around
in a trance all day.

199
00:10:28,362 --> 00:10:30,329
Well, he misses
her already.

200
00:10:30,364 --> 00:10:32,331
You know how
close they were.

201
00:10:32,366 --> 00:10:34,333
Yes, i know.

202
00:10:34,368 --> 00:10:36,335
What is that
supposed to mean?

203
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:37,837
I mean they
were too close.

204
00:10:37,872 --> 00:10:39,338
It wasn't right.

205
00:10:39,373 --> 00:10:40,840
You know that.

206
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:43,843
You heard what she said,
she called himherson.

207
00:10:43,878 --> 00:10:45,344
She didn't mean that.

208
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:46,345
Didn't she?

209
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,346
No.

210
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:50,349
Sylvia, for
heaven's sakes

211
00:10:50,384 --> 00:10:53,352
she was full of sedatives
and she was dying.

212
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:56,355
Oh, i'm sorry,
chris, it's just...

213
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,858
i guess we're
all upset today.

214
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:14,874
Hey. Why don't you
come over and play?

215
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,377
Is it cold there?

216
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:20,379
I had weenies for lunch.

217
00:11:20,414 --> 00:11:21,881
What did you have?

218
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:25,384
Maybe they'll fix my tricycle.

219
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:28,387
Billy.

220
00:11:28,422 --> 00:11:29,789
Who are you talking to?

221
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:31,891
Grandma.

222
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:33,492
She's lonesome.

223
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:37,396
She wanted to know
if i can come stay with her.

224
00:11:37,431 --> 00:11:38,898
Can i, mama?

225
00:11:38,933 --> 00:11:39,899
Can i?

226
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:14,633
Mrs. Bayles?

227
00:12:14,668 --> 00:12:16,635
Oh, just a minute,
shirley.

228
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:20,139
Feel like being alone?

229
00:12:20,174 --> 00:12:22,141
No, that's the
last thing i want.

230
00:12:22,176 --> 00:12:25,144
Well, i'll make us
some coffee.

231
00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:26,145
Yes, shirley,
what is it?

232
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,146
Mrs. Bayles...

233
00:12:27,181 --> 00:12:28,647
mrs. Bayles.

234
00:12:28,682 --> 00:12:30,049
My name is peterson.

235
00:12:30,084 --> 00:12:31,550
I hate to bother you
at a time like this.

236
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:33,552
The girl told me about
your mother-in-law's funeral.

237
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:34,553
What is it?

238
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:36,055
Well, it's about
your boy.

239
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,056
Billy?

240
00:12:37,091 --> 00:12:38,557
He's all right,
mrs. Bayles.

241
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:40,059
I just put him
down for his nap,

242
00:12:40,094 --> 00:12:42,061
and he's all right.
But i'm not.

243
00:12:42,096 --> 00:12:43,662
I've been sitting here
shaking for 20 minutes

244
00:12:43,697 --> 00:12:45,664
thinking about
what might have happened.

245
00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:47,366
What might have happened,
mr. Peterson?

246
00:12:47,401 --> 00:12:48,868
Your son
almost got himself killed.

247
00:12:48,903 --> 00:12:52,271
Ran right out
in front of my car from nowhere.

248
00:12:52,306 --> 00:12:54,673
Lucky thing i'm a cautious
driver, mr. Bayles.

249
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:55,674
Oh, excuse me.

250
00:12:55,709 --> 00:12:56,675
Billy doesn't play
in the streets.

251
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,177
I know, mr. Bayles,

252
00:12:58,212 --> 00:13:00,179
that's why i didn't say anything
when he went out.

253
00:13:00,214 --> 00:13:01,680
All right, shirley,
what happened?

254
00:13:01,715 --> 00:13:03,182
Well, he played
in the streets today.

255
00:13:03,217 --> 00:13:04,884
He ran right out
in front of my car-

256
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:06,886
didn't even have time
to put the brakes on.

257
00:13:06,921 --> 00:13:08,888
I couldn't have missed him
by more than a few inches.

258
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:12,491
It wasn't my fault,
mr. Bayles, honest.

259
00:13:12,526 --> 00:13:13,993
All right, shirley,

260
00:13:14,028 --> 00:13:15,995
apparently it wasn't
anybody's fault.

261
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:45,724
Mr. Bayles...

262
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:48,727
i think you'd better have
a talk with your boy.

263
00:13:48,762 --> 00:13:51,730
A talk? What about?

264
00:13:51,765 --> 00:13:54,233
Well... when i saw
that he was all right,

265
00:13:54,268 --> 00:13:56,735
i asked him why he did
a crazy thing like that,

266
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:58,737
running out in the middle
of a busy street.

267
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:01,340
He said somebody told him to.

268
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,844
Somebody told him to?

269
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:07,847
Who?

270
00:14:07,882 --> 00:14:09,348
He didn't say.

271
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:12,151
Mr. Bayles, you know
i'd never tell billy

272
00:14:12,186 --> 00:14:13,652
to do a thing like that.

273
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:15,654
Who else did he
talk to, shirley?

274
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:17,656
No one, he didn't
talk to no one.

275
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:20,159
He just sat up in
his room all day long

276
00:14:20,194 --> 00:14:22,661
just talking on
that toy telephone.

277
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:23,662
Honest.

278
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:31,170
Chris...

279
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:32,671
i'll be
right there.

280
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:35,674
I'm sorry,
mr. Peterson.

281
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:38,677
Don't be sorry, just
be glad the boy's safe.

282
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,186
Listen.

283
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:51,190
Oh, for
heaven's sake.

284
00:14:51,225 --> 00:14:54,493
Hi, pumpkin.
We're back.

285
00:14:54,528 --> 00:14:55,694
Billy, what's
this business

286
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:57,196
about your running
into the street?

287
00:14:57,231 --> 00:14:58,697
You know,
you had us worried.

288
00:14:58,732 --> 00:14:59,798
I'm sorry.

289
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:01,300
Well, why did
you do it?

290
00:15:01,335 --> 00:15:02,801
I don't know.

291
00:15:02,836 --> 00:15:05,404
Billy, who were
you talking to

292
00:15:05,439 --> 00:15:06,505
on the phone
just now?

293
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,506
Nobody.

294
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:08,507
Don't fib to me, billy.

295
00:15:08,542 --> 00:15:09,508
Who were you talking to?

296
00:15:09,543 --> 00:15:11,010
No one!

297
00:15:11,045 --> 00:15:12,011
You're going to tell me!

298
00:15:12,046 --> 00:15:13,012
You hear, now? I mean it!

299
00:15:13,047 --> 00:15:15,014
Easy.

300
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:21,020
Hey...

301
00:15:21,055 --> 00:15:23,522
mom doesn't like me
anymore, does she?

302
00:15:23,557 --> 00:15:26,025
Why, sure she
does, billy.

303
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:28,527
She's just upset.

304
00:15:28,562 --> 00:15:31,530
Billy, i'm going to
tell you something.

305
00:15:31,565 --> 00:15:34,033
Now, i want you to
try to understand.

306
00:15:34,068 --> 00:15:37,036
You're not going to see
your grandma anymore.

307
00:15:37,071 --> 00:15:39,538
She didn't go away,
like we said.

308
00:15:39,573 --> 00:15:43,042
She died, billy. Do you
know what that means?

309
00:15:43,077 --> 00:15:44,543
Yes...

310
00:15:44,578 --> 00:15:46,545
i know.

311
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,547
Billy, i know you're
just pretending

312
00:15:48,582 --> 00:15:50,549
to talk to her
on that phone.

313
00:15:50,584 --> 00:15:53,052
I know it's just
a game you made up.

314
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,053
But, billy, for me,

315
00:15:54,088 --> 00:15:56,555
don't do it in front
of your mother.

316
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:57,556
Why?

317
00:15:57,591 --> 00:16:00,059
Well, because she...

318
00:16:00,094 --> 00:16:01,560
just don't,
hmm?

319
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:04,063
Okay.

320
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:22,281
...to me about mommy.

321
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,997
Darling, aren't
you coming to bed?

322
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,503
Chris, don't
shut me out.

323
00:16:44,538 --> 00:16:46,505
Oh, i'm sorry.
I was just...

324
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,007
i know.

325
00:16:48,042 --> 00:16:49,508
Funerals stink.

326
00:16:49,543 --> 00:16:51,510
I wanted to remember
her the way she was.

327
00:16:51,545 --> 00:16:54,013
Now i'll always
think of her that way.

328
00:16:54,048 --> 00:16:56,515
I know how hard
everything's been on you, syl.

329
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:58,017
Everything you've
had to go through.

330
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,019
But mother never
meant any harm.

331
00:17:00,054 --> 00:17:01,520
I suppose not.

332
00:17:01,555 --> 00:17:03,022
No, it's true.

333
00:17:03,057 --> 00:17:05,024
She had two children before me.

334
00:17:05,059 --> 00:17:06,025
She lost them both.

335
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,027
She just couldn't let go.

336
00:17:08,062 --> 00:17:09,028
I was all she had.

337
00:17:09,063 --> 00:17:11,530
Except for billy.

338
00:17:11,565 --> 00:17:12,831
But billy was me again.

339
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:14,333
A chance to go back.

340
00:17:14,368 --> 00:17:16,835
To pretend all those
other years never happened.

341
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:23,342
I know it wasn't right
or fair to you, syl,

342
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:25,844
but, believe me,
no matter what she did,

343
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:27,346
she did it
out of love.

344
00:17:27,381 --> 00:17:30,349
Love for whom?

345
00:17:30,384 --> 00:17:31,850
Oh, syl...

346
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:32,851
oh, i'm sorry.

347
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:34,353
I didn't mean that.

348
00:17:34,388 --> 00:17:35,854
I really didn't.

349
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:38,857
Why, you're trembling.

350
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:45,864
Let's go to bed.

351
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:54,873
Hooray for peter pan!

352
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:57,876
That's a good story, grandma.

353
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:29,408
That's our secret,
isn't it?

354
00:18:29,443 --> 00:18:31,410
Nobody knows but us.

355
00:18:31,445 --> 00:18:34,313
Can i have a chocolate
ice cream bar?

356
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,821
My telephone!
My telephone!

357
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:48,527
My telephone! You broke my telephone!

358
00:18:48,562 --> 00:18:49,728
Syl, what is it?

359
00:18:49,763 --> 00:18:51,730
What's the matter?
Oh, i heard her.

360
00:18:51,765 --> 00:18:53,732
Who? She was there. There on the phone.

361
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:55,234
Syl, snap out of it.

362
00:18:55,269 --> 00:18:56,235
She didn't
say anything,

363
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:59,238
but i could hear
her breathing.

364
00:18:59,273 --> 00:19:00,239
Syl...

365
00:19:00,274 --> 00:19:01,740
billy...

366
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:03,742
billy?

367
00:19:04,743 --> 00:19:05,744
Billy!

368
00:19:05,779 --> 00:19:06,745
Billy?

369
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,648
Billy?

370
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,150
Billy!

371
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,653
Billy? Billy?

372
00:19:14,688 --> 00:19:15,654
Billy!

373
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,259
Billy!

374
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,263
Oh, no... no...

375
00:19:24,298 --> 00:19:25,264
no...

376
00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:26,765
no, no, no...

377
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,267
no, no...

378
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:34,273
she took him...

379
00:19:34,308 --> 00:19:36,275
she took him away.

380
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:39,278
She took him.

381
00:19:39,313 --> 00:19:40,279
Don't say that.

382
00:19:40,314 --> 00:19:42,281
Yes, she did.
She took him.

383
00:19:42,316 --> 00:19:44,783
Oh, syl, syl, don't...
don't say that.

384
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,302
How are his chances?

385
00:20:03,337 --> 00:20:06,305
Well, they're
not so good.

386
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,807
If we'd have got him
a few minutes earlier...

387
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:12,311
well, the doctor will
be here in a few minutes.

388
00:20:12,346 --> 00:20:14,313
He'll give your
wife something.

389
00:20:14,348 --> 00:20:15,314
Thanks.

390
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:16,975
Mother...

391
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:19,478
if you can hear me, listen.

392
00:21:22,981 --> 00:21:26,985
You said you loved billy.

393
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,987
At his birthday, you...

394
00:21:29,022 --> 00:21:31,490
you picked him up and...

395
00:21:31,525 --> 00:21:33,992
and you hugged him.

396
00:21:34,027 --> 00:21:36,995
And you said
he gave you life again.

397
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:42,501
If you really love billy...

398
00:21:42,536 --> 00:21:44,503
give him back.

399
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:51,009
He's only five.

400
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:54,012
He hasn't even started.

401
00:21:57,516 --> 00:22:01,019
He doesn't know anything
about going to school...

402
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:07,025
or girlfriends...

403
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,027
or wearing long pants...

404
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:11,530
even pitching a baseball.

405
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:18,036
He's hardly been
out of this room...

406
00:22:18,071 --> 00:22:21,039
out of this house.

407
00:22:21,074 --> 00:22:24,042
There's a whole world
he hasn't even touched.

408
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:34,553
Mother...

409
00:22:34,588 --> 00:22:38,056
you said billy
gave you life again.

410
00:22:38,091 --> 00:22:40,559
Now you can givehimlife.

411
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:46,565
If you really love him,
let him live.

412
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:50,068
Give him back!

413
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:55,073
Give him back, ma.

414
00:22:58,076 --> 00:22:59,578
Ma?

415
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:17,095
Yeah...

416
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:19,097
yeah, we got him.

417
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:22,401
Yeah...

418
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,404
yeah!

419
00:23:25,439 --> 00:23:27,406
Mrs. Bayles?

420
00:23:27,441 --> 00:23:29,408
I don't know how we did it,

421
00:23:29,443 --> 00:23:31,410
but he's going
to be all right.

422
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,413
Chris!

423
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:37,916
Oh, chris!

424
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,921
A toy telephone,
an act of faith,

425
00:23:42,956 --> 00:23:45,924
a set of improbable
circumstances all combine

426
00:23:45,959 --> 00:23:48,427
to probe a mystery,
to fathom a depth,

427
00:23:48,462 --> 00:23:51,930
to send a facet of light
into a dark after-region

428
00:23:51,965 --> 00:23:53,932
to be believed or disbelieved

429
00:23:53,967 --> 00:23:56,435
depending on your
frame of reference-

430
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:59,938
a fact or a fantasy,
a substance or a shadow-

431
00:23:59,973 --> 00:24:04,443
but all of it very much a part
of the twilight zone.

432
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:09,948
Rod serling,
the creator oftwilight zone,

433
00:24:09,983 --> 00:24:11,450
will tell you
about next week's story

434
00:24:11,485 --> 00:24:15,053
after this word
from our alternate sponsor.

435
00:24:15,088 --> 00:24:16,555
And now, mr. Serling.

436
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:20,058
Next week, you'll ride up-front
in this wagon on a trek west.

437
00:24:20,093 --> 00:24:22,561
Your itinerary
is across the great plains,

438
00:24:22,596 --> 00:24:24,563
over the rockies
to a point in new mexico.

439
00:24:24,598 --> 00:24:27,065
And you'll ride alongside
mr. Cliff robertson

440
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,568
in a strange tale of a handful
of american pioneers

441
00:24:29,603 --> 00:24:32,070
who made a detour in time

442
00:24:32,105 --> 00:24:33,572
and found themselves
one afternoon

443
00:24:33,607 --> 00:24:35,073
on the fringe of the future.

444
00:24:35,108 --> 00:24:37,576
Our story is called
"a hundred yards over the rim."

445
00:24:37,611 --> 00:24:39,077
And, believe me,
it's quite a view.

446
00:24:39,112 --> 00:24:41,079
I hope we'll see you then.

447
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:34,633
See the newandy griffith show
each week

448
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:37,135
over most of these stations.

449
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:39,137
Consult local listings.
