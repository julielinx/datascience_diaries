1
00:00:05,889 --> 00:00:09,642
You unlock this door
with the key of imagination.

2
00:00:09,677 --> 00:00:12,028
Beyond it
is another dimension-

3
00:00:12,063 --> 00:00:14,030
a dimension of sound,

4
00:00:14,065 --> 00:00:15,899
a dimension of sight,

5
00:00:15,934 --> 00:00:18,401
a dimension of mind.

6
00:00:18,436 --> 00:00:21,538
You're moving into a land
of both shadow and substance,

7
00:00:21,573 --> 00:00:23,406
of things and ideas.

8
00:00:23,441 --> 00:00:27,794
You've just crossed over
into the twilight zone.

9
00:00:46,563 --> 00:00:49,065
Probe 7 calling base.

10
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,934
This is probe 7 calling base.

11
00:00:54,105 --> 00:00:56,573
This is probe 7...

12
00:00:56,608 --> 00:00:58,441
probe 7 with a landing report.

13
00:00:58,476 --> 00:01:01,578
Over to you, base, over to you.

14
00:01:01,613 --> 00:01:05,448
Probe 7, this is base.
Probe 7, this is base.

15
00:01:05,483 --> 00:01:06,699
You're coming through low
but audibly.

16
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:07,951
Go ahead probe 7.

17
00:01:07,986 --> 00:01:09,836
I've crash-landed
into a planet system

18
00:01:09,871 --> 00:01:12,956
4.3 light years from our sun.

19
00:01:12,991 --> 00:01:14,841
Most of my equipment's gone.

20
00:01:14,876 --> 00:01:17,343
As of the moment, i don't know
this planet's density

21
00:01:17,378 --> 00:01:21,097
or its atmospheric composition,
but i'm alive and breathing.

22
00:01:21,132 --> 00:01:22,966
Your visual image
is very indistinct.

23
00:01:23,001 --> 00:01:24,217
Can you increase your power?

24
00:01:24,252 --> 00:01:27,353
I've got half a generator
and three solar cells left.

25
00:01:27,388 --> 00:01:29,856
Just how i'm getting through
to you, i can't even explain.

26
00:01:29,891 --> 00:01:31,107
Can you effect repairs?

27
00:01:31,142 --> 00:01:32,976
If so, how long do you estimate
it will take?

28
00:01:33,011 --> 00:01:34,861
Oh, give me about 20 years,

29
00:01:34,896 --> 00:01:37,363
new right arm,
maybe replace my head,

30
00:01:37,398 --> 00:01:38,615
i could make a start.

31
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:41,734
In short... in short,
i need help.

32
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:43,620
I need help desperately,
and i need it right away.

33
00:01:43,655 --> 00:01:47,240
We tracked you on impulses
to your approximate locations.

34
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:50,994
We have nothing back here
that can reach you. Nothing.

35
00:01:51,029 --> 00:01:53,496
You'll have to make
those repairs yourself.

36
00:01:53,531 --> 00:01:55,381
I have no power.
I have no propellant at all.

37
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:59,135
I've got a ship that looks like
fragments from a space puzzle.

38
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:00,386
You tell me you've got nothing
to send out for me,

39
00:02:00,421 --> 00:02:02,889
you're telling me you're
crossing off one spaceman.

40
00:02:02,924 --> 00:02:05,892
Repeat, please.
Your last message was not clear.

41
00:02:05,927 --> 00:02:06,759
I'll give it to you
in just a few words.

42
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:09,262
This craft is not going
to fly anymore-

43
00:02:09,297 --> 00:02:11,764
not forward, not up,
and not back there.

44
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:13,650
Isn't there anything
you can do to help me?

45
00:02:13,685 --> 00:02:16,653
Look, i'm losing power.
I've lost visual contact.

46
00:02:16,688 --> 00:02:17,904
I'll have to sign off for now.

47
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:19,772
Acknowledge, will you, base?

48
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:21,024
Remain on this frequency.

49
00:02:21,059 --> 00:02:22,909
We will expect to hear from you.

50
00:02:22,944 --> 00:02:26,663
Colonel cook,
this is general larrabee.

51
00:02:26,698 --> 00:02:28,164
We understand your spot.

52
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:30,033
We wish we could help you.

53
00:02:30,068 --> 00:02:33,169
There's only a possibility
that if you check out your ship,

54
00:02:33,204 --> 00:02:35,672
we can transmit instructions
to you for its repair.

55
00:02:35,707 --> 00:02:37,540
Now, that's a possibility.

56
00:02:37,575 --> 00:02:40,043
Why don't i just build
a new one, general?

57
00:02:40,078 --> 00:02:41,928
That's a possibility, too.

58
00:02:41,963 --> 00:02:44,430
I'll transmit again
as soon as possible.

59
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:55,942
Heaven help me.

60
00:02:55,977 --> 00:02:57,193
I wonder...

61
00:02:57,228 --> 00:02:59,696
i wonder if that's
a possibility.

62
00:02:59,731 --> 00:03:02,815
One colonel cook,
a traveler in space.

63
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,067
He's landed on a remote planet

64
00:03:04,102 --> 00:03:07,203
several million miles
from his point of departure.

65
00:03:07,238 --> 00:03:08,454
He can make an inventory
of his plight

66
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:13,326
by just one 360-degree movement
of head and eyes.

67
00:03:13,361 --> 00:03:16,462
Colonel cook has been set adrift
in an ocean of space

68
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,965
in a metal lifeboat that has
been scorched and destroyed

69
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,833
and will never fly again.

70
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:23,336
He survived the crash,
but his ordeal is yet to begin.

71
00:03:23,371 --> 00:03:25,221
Now he must give battle
to loneliness.

72
00:03:25,256 --> 00:03:28,341
Now colonel cook
must meet the unknown.

73
00:03:28,376 --> 00:03:30,226
It's a small planet
set deep in space,

74
00:03:30,261 --> 00:03:33,980
but for colonel cook,
it's the twilight zone.

75
00:04:41,631 --> 00:04:43,633
Anybody around here?

76
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:49,255
Anybody hear me?

77
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,915
This is probe 7 calling base.

78
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,784
Probe 7 calling base.

79
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:19,669
Over to you, base.

80
00:05:19,704 --> 00:05:21,537
We read you very well, colonel.

81
00:05:21,572 --> 00:05:23,423
Tell us your situation, please.

82
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:25,041
Relatively unchanged, general.

83
00:05:25,076 --> 00:05:28,177
I worked on the solar cells so
i'll be sending out more power.

84
00:05:28,212 --> 00:05:30,046
It'll be temporary,

85
00:05:30,081 --> 00:05:31,931
but you're coming in
much stronger now, too.

86
00:05:31,966 --> 00:05:33,299
What about your ship?

87
00:05:33,334 --> 00:05:35,435
Probe 7
is no longer probing, general,

88
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:39,188
unless it's the few subterranean
feet where i landed.

89
00:05:39,223 --> 00:05:40,440
I've been outside.

90
00:05:40,475 --> 00:05:42,308
There's plant life,
but i was pretty sure of that

91
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:43,559
when i spiraled in.

92
00:05:43,594 --> 00:05:45,445
The gravity pull's
about the same as ours,

93
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,696
and what i can tell
of the atmosphere,

94
00:05:46,731 --> 00:05:47,947
that's roughly similar as well.

95
00:05:48,564 --> 00:05:50,450
We've got
a major problem here, cook.

96
00:05:50,485 --> 00:05:52,318
There's been a major crisis.

97
00:05:52,353 --> 00:05:53,569
War is imminent.

98
00:05:54,203 --> 00:05:56,072
The next 24 hours
will probably tell.

99
00:05:56,107 --> 00:05:59,826
There's always a major crisis
and there's always talk of war.

100
00:05:59,861 --> 00:06:01,077
You'll forgive me, general,

101
00:06:01,112 --> 00:06:04,213
but my own problem has
a little more immediacy for me.

102
00:06:04,248 --> 00:06:06,082
It's a little more personalized.

103
00:06:06,117 --> 00:06:10,470
I've got a week's food left
and two broken bones in one arm.

104
00:06:10,505 --> 00:06:12,338
Can't another ship
be sent out for me?

105
00:06:12,373 --> 00:06:15,475
There isn't another ship, cook,
unless we build one.

106
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:17,977
If we have war
in the next few hours,

107
00:06:18,012 --> 00:06:21,097
there isn't going to be anybody
left around to do any building.

108
00:06:21,132 --> 00:06:22,982
That's the realistic view,
colonel.

109
00:06:23,017 --> 00:06:26,736
That may go down hard,
but those are the facts of life.

110
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:30,490
Ten hours from now,
perhaps six, four hours,

111
00:06:30,525 --> 00:06:32,992
we'll be committed back here.

112
00:06:33,027 --> 00:06:35,495
I'm talking
half a billion people, colonel,

113
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:39,248
not just one lonely man.

114
00:06:39,283 --> 00:06:40,500
Do you understand this?

115
00:06:41,117 --> 00:06:43,002
Very well, general.

116
00:06:43,037 --> 00:06:45,505
Very, very well.

117
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,373
Um...

118
00:06:47,408 --> 00:06:50,510
any point in my trying
to contact you further?

119
00:06:50,545 --> 00:06:52,879
Yes, colonel, two points:

120
00:06:52,914 --> 00:06:56,632
One, to help your loneliness,

121
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:58,518
and two...

122
00:06:58,553 --> 00:07:01,637
to see if your own world
still exists.

123
00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:04,140
It's a moot question, colonel:

124
00:07:04,175 --> 00:07:06,642
Which of us has
the better chance of survival?

125
00:07:06,677 --> 00:07:09,779
Over to you... and out.

126
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:25,411
Base calling probe 7.

127
00:07:25,446 --> 00:07:26,662
This is probe 7.

128
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:28,548
Come in, base.

129
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:30,416
Anything new to report, colonel?

130
00:07:30,451 --> 00:07:31,667
I've done some exploring,
general.

131
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:32,919
I'm very much alone here.

132
00:07:32,954 --> 00:07:34,804
No sign of anything?

133
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:36,055
Anything or anyone?

134
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:37,924
I've got a wind
that sings sad songs to me.

135
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:40,426
There's some fruit trees
that might provide food

136
00:07:40,461 --> 00:07:41,677
if it's not poisonous,
and that's it.

137
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:42,929
That's all of it.

138
00:07:42,964 --> 00:07:45,431
Not that it will provide
vast solace to you,

139
00:07:45,466 --> 00:07:48,568
but at 9:00
this morning, cook...

140
00:07:48,603 --> 00:07:50,436
we went to war.

141
00:07:52,356 --> 00:07:53,573
And?

142
00:07:53,608 --> 00:07:55,441
Our entire seacoast went.

143
00:07:55,476 --> 00:07:57,326
It took 12 minutes.

144
00:07:57,361 --> 00:07:59,195
Exactly 12 minutes.

145
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:01,080
We-we retaliated?

146
00:08:01,115 --> 00:08:02,949
Oh, indeed.

147
00:08:02,984 --> 00:08:06,085
With alacrity
and great effectiveness.

148
00:08:06,702 --> 00:08:08,588
And we still are.

149
00:08:08,623 --> 00:08:11,707
Our world is doing
a little wholesale dying now.

150
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:13,593
Are you safe?

151
00:08:13,628 --> 00:08:15,461
For the time being.

152
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:17,346
Our location's classified.

153
00:08:17,381 --> 00:08:19,849
The trouble is,
we can't stay here much longer.

154
00:08:19,884 --> 00:08:22,351
There have been bombs
as close as 400 miles from us.

155
00:08:22,386 --> 00:08:26,722
It's only a question now
as to our manner of death-

156
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:28,608
very fast or very slow.

157
00:08:28,643 --> 00:08:30,476
It's that kind of choice.

158
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:32,361
You know, it's really a pity

159
00:08:32,396 --> 00:08:34,864
we didn't send others
along with you.

160
00:08:34,899 --> 00:08:37,984
What you think of as a prison
might be a haven.

161
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:39,235
What you think of
as a haven, general,

162
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:41,737
is a very large, dark dungeon.

163
00:08:41,772 --> 00:08:44,240
Maybe this world has only night
and no day.

164
00:08:44,275 --> 00:08:46,742
So far, only darkness.

165
00:08:46,777 --> 00:08:49,245
And i don't care very much
for solitary confinement.

166
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,747
Unfortunately for both of us,

167
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:54,884
we have very little choice
in the matter.

168
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:58,004
What's happening there, general?
What's going on?

169
00:08:58,039 --> 00:08:59,639
We're going to have to move
out of here now.

170
00:08:59,674 --> 00:09:00,890
I don't know
whether we'll be able

171
00:09:00,925 --> 00:09:01,507
to contact you again or not.

172
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:03,392
Try, sir, if you can.

173
00:09:03,427 --> 00:09:04,644
L-i'd like to hear a voice.

174
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:06,512
Silence or cries?

175
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:09,015
That's the story from our world.

176
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,900
Silence or cries.

177
00:09:10,935 --> 00:09:13,402
God bless you... and good luck.

178
00:09:13,437 --> 00:09:16,522
Good luck.

179
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:08,574
I've got company.

180
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:12,578
I've got company!

181
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:16,215
Whoever and wherever,
welcome, welcome!

182
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,084
Come on down
and meet your genial host.

183
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:21,837
Let me see you.

184
00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:25,591
Please, whoever and wherever,
let's shake hands.

185
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:26,842
Come on!

186
00:10:26,877 --> 00:10:29,345
Let's shake hands.

187
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,596
I need a friend.

188
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:32,481
Come on!

189
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:49,615
Come on, friend.

190
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,500
Come on out.

191
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,123
Probe 7, this is base.

192
00:10:57,158 --> 00:10:59,625
This is our last contact, cook.

193
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,510
Just a few minutes ago,
we got ours.

194
00:11:01,545 --> 00:11:04,630
500% increase
in the radioactivity around us.

195
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:05,881
From what we can gather,

196
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,767
the enemy had it
just as bad as we did.

197
00:11:07,802 --> 00:11:10,886
We wiped them out;
they wiped us out.

198
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:13,639
Just one last forlorn wish
for you, son.

199
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:17,893
Whoever you'll meet there,
however you'll meet them,

200
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:21,030
i hope it can come without fear.

201
00:11:21,065 --> 00:11:24,033
I hope it can come
without anger.

202
00:11:24,068 --> 00:11:26,535
I hope your new world
will be different.

203
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:29,655
I hope you'll find
no word such as hate.

204
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:32,158
I hope there'll be...

205
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,712
all right, come on out.

206
00:12:59,747 --> 00:13:00,963
You've got quite a choice.

207
00:13:00,998 --> 00:13:03,466
You can be friendly,
you can be neutral,

208
00:13:03,501 --> 00:13:05,968
or you can be dead.

209
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:12,224
You'll get hungry
in a little while.

210
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:14,343
Or don't you eat?

211
00:13:24,987 --> 00:13:26,856
I'm going to walk out of here

212
00:13:26,891 --> 00:13:29,358
so you can have a chance
to get out when i'm not here.

213
00:13:29,393 --> 00:13:31,243
I'll be outside.

214
00:13:31,861 --> 00:13:35,614
You'll hear my footsteps
so you'll know that i'm leaving.

215
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:36,866
You may not understand
this language,

216
00:13:36,901 --> 00:13:38,751
but the tone
may be getting through to you.

217
00:13:40,002 --> 00:13:43,122
You can come out now
when-whenever you want

218
00:13:43,157 --> 00:13:45,624
and we can talk.

219
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:43,125
You know what's
going to happen

220
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,376
in a few minutes?

221
00:15:44,411 --> 00:15:46,745
I'm going to wake up
from this nightmare,

222
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,631
and i'm going to
charge out of bed

223
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:51,133
like a rocket,

224
00:15:51,168 --> 00:15:53,636
and i'm going
to tell them back home,

225
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:56,755
"you can talk about dreams
from now on,

226
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,641
"but i get the prize

227
00:15:58,676 --> 00:16:01,760
for the most imaginative dream
of the space age."

228
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:04,263
You understand?

229
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:06,765
Do you understand?

230
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:10,653
Do you understand anything
i'm saying?

231
00:16:12,521 --> 00:16:15,024
My name is cook.

232
00:16:15,059 --> 00:16:17,526
I come from
another planet.

233
00:16:17,561 --> 00:16:18,777
I crash-landed here.

234
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:20,663
I cracked
up my ship.

235
00:16:20,698 --> 00:16:23,532
I'm the wingless spaceman,
no place to go

236
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:27,286
and all the time in the universe
to get there.

237
00:16:27,321 --> 00:16:29,288
Look...

238
00:16:35,544 --> 00:16:37,429
this is my galaxy.

239
00:16:37,464 --> 00:16:39,298
See, i went off-course.

240
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:42,434
I didn't have enough
power to get back.

241
00:16:42,469 --> 00:16:43,686
This was the only
place i could find

242
00:16:43,721 --> 00:16:45,554
that looked
inhabitable.

243
00:16:45,589 --> 00:16:48,691
Here, right here,
where we are.

244
00:16:48,726 --> 00:16:52,194
Oh, what difference
does it make?

245
00:16:52,229 --> 00:16:54,697
You're probably an
illusion anyway,

246
00:16:54,732 --> 00:16:56,565
just as those
markings you left

247
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,816
are an illusion
as well.

248
00:16:57,851 --> 00:17:01,570
So... you can
disappear anytime now.

249
00:17:02,571 --> 00:17:05,074
Understand?

250
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:14,967
That's your galaxy.

251
00:17:16,218 --> 00:17:18,087
That's your planet.

252
00:17:18,122 --> 00:17:19,338
That's where
you came from.

253
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:23,092
Your planet got
out of its orbit

254
00:17:23,127 --> 00:17:24,977
and moved away
from your sun

255
00:17:25,012 --> 00:17:27,846
that's where you went,
where your world went.

256
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:29,732
But you got out.

257
00:17:29,767 --> 00:17:31,600
How many others?

258
00:17:34,138 --> 00:17:35,354
You...

259
00:17:36,605 --> 00:17:39,108
you...

260
00:17:39,143 --> 00:17:40,993
two, three,
four, five...

261
00:17:41,028 --> 00:17:42,244
and... any others?

262
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:44,113
Em.

263
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:47,866
No, em.

264
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:49,752
Your ship.

265
00:17:49,787 --> 00:17:51,620
What about your ship?

266
00:17:51,655 --> 00:17:53,505
Where's your ship?

267
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,758
Ship? Ship?

268
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:07,269
Cook.

269
00:18:07,304 --> 00:18:08,520
Emman...

270
00:18:08,555 --> 00:18:09,772
norda.

271
00:18:09,807 --> 00:18:12,274
Norda?

272
00:18:12,309 --> 00:18:13,525
Norda.

273
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:17,896
So, how does it figure?

274
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:19,531
Anyway, we're
stuck here.

275
00:18:19,566 --> 00:18:22,034
A one-armed man
with a broken rib

276
00:18:22,069 --> 00:18:23,285
and a tired woman.

277
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,536
What have you
been living on?

278
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:25,788
Uh, what food?

279
00:18:25,823 --> 00:18:27,039
What to eat?

280
00:18:30,793 --> 00:18:33,295
Well, i can
offer you food

281
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:35,164
and i can offer
you companionship.

282
00:18:35,199 --> 00:18:38,300
We could spend the rest
of our lives together

283
00:18:38,335 --> 00:18:40,169
drawing diagrams...

284
00:18:40,204 --> 00:18:42,671
which would become
rather tedious.

285
00:18:42,706 --> 00:18:44,556
But the brighter of
us will have to learn

286
00:18:44,591 --> 00:18:47,676
the other's
language eventually.

287
00:18:47,711 --> 00:18:50,179
Come, norda.

288
00:18:50,214 --> 00:18:51,430
Eat.

289
00:18:51,465 --> 00:18:53,315
You understand?

290
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,566
Eat.

291
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:58,320
Food.

292
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,325
Eat...

293
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,194
food...

294
00:19:05,229 --> 00:19:05,828
food.

295
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:08,330
Food.

296
00:19:17,339 --> 00:19:19,208
Flah, em...

297
00:19:19,243 --> 00:19:20,709
norda!

298
00:19:20,744 --> 00:19:23,212
Norda, please, please...

299
00:19:23,247 --> 00:19:24,463
i'm not going
to hurt you.

300
00:19:24,498 --> 00:19:26,348
Please.

301
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:35,474
It's not just the language.

302
00:19:36,725 --> 00:19:38,610
It's our breed.

303
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:45,484
It's the way we ultimately
always respond to one another.

304
00:19:46,735 --> 00:19:48,620
Good luck to you.

305
00:19:49,872 --> 00:19:51,740
Good luck.

306
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:57,379
I can't give you any soil test.

307
00:19:57,414 --> 00:19:59,882
I can't send you
any plant species

308
00:19:59,917 --> 00:20:02,384
or animals
or anything like that,

309
00:20:02,419 --> 00:20:05,387
but i can give you
an observation

310
00:20:05,422 --> 00:20:07,890
as to the psychological makeup
of man.

311
00:20:07,925 --> 00:20:10,392
He's a frightened breed.

312
00:20:10,427 --> 00:20:14,146
He's a very frightened breed.

313
00:20:14,181 --> 00:20:16,014
Must be a universal trait.

314
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:19,768
Must be the case
wherever there's life.

315
00:20:19,803 --> 00:20:23,522
So we're not alone on that.

316
00:20:23,557 --> 00:20:26,658
It is really quite a pity...

317
00:20:26,693 --> 00:20:28,527
as you may
have perceived

318
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:31,163
if any of you have survived...

319
00:20:34,917 --> 00:20:37,286
do you hear me, base?

320
00:20:37,321 --> 00:20:39,788
Do you hear me?

321
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,426
...i hope it can come
without fear.

322
00:20:44,461 --> 00:20:47,546
I hope it can come
without anger.

323
00:20:47,581 --> 00:20:50,682
I hope your new world
will be different.

324
00:20:50,717 --> 00:20:53,685
I hope you'll find
no word such as hate.

325
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,188
I hope there'll be...

326
00:21:14,323 --> 00:21:16,325
ah, just in time
to say good-bye.

327
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:19,077
Going to try another place
over in that direction.

328
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:20,462
More vegetation,

329
00:21:20,497 --> 00:21:22,965
fruit trees-
even flowers, it appears.

330
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:26,084
Sort of, uh...
sort of like a garden.

331
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:28,086
I'm going to try
to live there.

332
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:29,338
De ekkel.

333
00:21:29,373 --> 00:21:32,474
O-toh te ur.

334
00:21:32,509 --> 00:21:33,976
Indeed you may.

335
00:21:34,011 --> 00:21:35,844
Indeed you may come.

336
00:21:35,879 --> 00:21:37,095
And we'll both live.

337
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:40,849
I don't know how
or for how long, but we can try.

338
00:21:53,362 --> 00:21:55,614
It would help
if we could
communicate.

339
00:21:55,649 --> 00:21:59,368
Might as well start right now.

340
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:05,624
What do you
call this?

341
00:22:07,876 --> 00:22:10,512
In your language.

342
00:22:10,547 --> 00:22:12,014
Eat?

343
00:22:12,049 --> 00:22:13,765
No.

344
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,634
No, not eat.

345
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:16,885
Not food.

346
00:22:25,394 --> 00:22:27,279
Earth?

347
00:22:27,314 --> 00:22:29,648
Erd-thah?

348
00:22:30,399 --> 00:22:32,901
Erd-thah.

349
00:22:32,936 --> 00:22:34,653
Earth.

350
00:22:34,688 --> 00:22:36,788
We've just given
this place a name.

351
00:22:36,823 --> 00:22:38,657
All right.

352
00:22:38,692 --> 00:22:40,542
We'll call it earth.

353
00:22:40,577 --> 00:22:42,160
Earth.

354
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:47,165
Cook.

355
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:50,052
Cook.

356
00:22:50,087 --> 00:22:54,056
Adam cook.

357
00:22:54,091 --> 00:22:56,558
Norda?

358
00:22:56,593 --> 00:22:57,926
Norda.

359
00:22:57,961 --> 00:22:59,811
Eve.

360
00:22:59,846 --> 00:23:03,432
All right, eve.

361
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:09,071
Well, we're dispossessed,
and now we're going to possess.

362
00:23:09,106 --> 00:23:10,939
This is our home now.

363
00:23:10,974 --> 00:23:12,190
This is earth.

364
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:37,716
Sep-luh.

365
00:23:37,751 --> 00:23:39,601
Ees...

366
00:23:39,636 --> 00:23:41,470
sep-luh.

367
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:44,606
Is that your food?

368
00:23:44,641 --> 00:23:47,726
Is that what you've
been living on?

369
00:23:50,862 --> 00:23:53,365
What is it?

370
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,233
Eat.

371
00:23:55,268 --> 00:23:57,119
Food.

372
00:24:05,877 --> 00:24:07,746
Do you know these people?

373
00:24:07,781 --> 00:24:09,631
Names familiar, are they?

374
00:24:09,666 --> 00:24:11,500
They lived a long time ago.

375
00:24:11,535 --> 00:24:14,636
Perhaps they're part fable.
Perhaps they're part fantasy.

376
00:24:14,671 --> 00:24:17,139
And perhaps the place
they're walking to now

377
00:24:17,174 --> 00:24:19,007
is not really called eden.

378
00:24:19,042 --> 00:24:20,892
We offer it
only as a presumption.

379
00:24:20,927 --> 00:24:25,263
This has been
the twilight zone.

380
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:28,767
And now, mr. Serling.

381
00:24:28,802 --> 00:24:31,903
Next ontwilight zone,
three national guardsmen

382
00:24:31,938 --> 00:24:34,406
on a maneuver
traveling across the same ground

383
00:24:34,441 --> 00:24:36,274
formerly occupied
by george custer.

384
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:38,777
In an outfit called
the 7th cavalry.

385
00:24:38,812 --> 00:24:41,279
Time and its
infinite complexity meshes

386
00:24:41,314 --> 00:24:43,165
in what evolves
as a stunningly different story

387
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,667
about soldiers and indians
suspended in limbo

388
00:24:45,702 --> 00:24:46,918
between then and now.

389
00:24:46,953 --> 00:24:50,672
Ontwilight zonenext, "the 7th
is made up of phantoms".
