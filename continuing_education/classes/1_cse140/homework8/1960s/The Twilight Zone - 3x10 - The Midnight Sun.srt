1
00:00:10,377 --> 00:00:12,879
You're traveling
through another dimension-

2
00:00:12,914 --> 00:00:16,633
a dimension not only of sight
and sound, but of mind,

3
00:00:16,668 --> 00:00:17,884
a journey into a wondrous land

4
00:00:17,919 --> 00:00:19,769
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

5
00:00:19,804 --> 00:00:22,889
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

6
00:02:25,547 --> 00:02:26,763
Suzy!

7
00:02:26,798 --> 00:02:28,648
Don't take the lady's water.

8
00:02:28,683 --> 00:02:30,517
It's all right,
mr. Schuster.

9
00:02:30,552 --> 00:02:31,768
I've got plenty.

10
00:02:31,803 --> 00:02:33,653
Nobody's got plenty.

11
00:02:33,688 --> 00:02:36,156
Oh, mr. Schuster, i thought

12
00:02:36,191 --> 00:02:37,407
i heard
your voice.

13
00:02:37,442 --> 00:02:39,909
For the last time, mrs. Bronson,
we're leaving.

14
00:02:39,944 --> 00:02:41,161
Did you get gas?

15
00:02:41,196 --> 00:02:42,412
I got 12 gallons.

16
00:02:42,447 --> 00:02:44,280
I figure that
ought to get us

17
00:02:44,315 --> 00:02:45,532
at least
to syracuse.

18
00:02:45,567 --> 00:02:47,534
Where are you going?

19
00:02:47,569 --> 00:02:50,036
We're trying
to get to toronto.

20
00:02:50,071 --> 00:02:52,539
Mr. Schuster
has a cousin there.

21
00:02:52,574 --> 00:02:55,041
I'm not sure it's wise
you're doing this.

22
00:02:55,076 --> 00:02:58,795
The highways are packed
bumper to bumper the radio says.

23
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:01,297
And what with the gas shortage
and everything...

24
00:03:01,332 --> 00:03:02,549
i know that,

25
00:03:02,584 --> 00:03:05,051
but we've got
to try anyway.

26
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:10,056
It's been nice
living here.

27
00:03:10,091 --> 00:03:11,941
You're good
neighbors.

28
00:03:11,976 --> 00:03:13,810
Let's go, honey.

29
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:16,946
Bye.

30
00:03:18,815 --> 00:03:20,450
Good luck.

31
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:24,821
Safe trip.

32
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:31,077
And now we are two.

33
00:03:31,112 --> 00:03:33,580
They were the last?

34
00:03:33,615 --> 00:03:35,715
Building's empty now...

35
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,584
except for you and me.

36
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:46,976
What happens now?

37
00:03:47,011 --> 00:03:48,228
I don't know.

38
00:03:48,845 --> 00:03:50,096
I heard on the radio

39
00:03:50,131 --> 00:03:52,599
that they're only going
to turn the water on

40
00:03:52,634 --> 00:03:54,484
an hour a day from now on.

41
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:56,986
They said
they'd announce what time.

42
00:03:57,021 --> 00:03:58,855
Aren't you going to leave?

43
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,609
No.

44
00:04:02,644 --> 00:04:05,111
No, i'm not going to leave.

45
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:09,499
You know, mrs. Bronson,

46
00:04:09,534 --> 00:04:14,003
i keep getting this
crazy thought...

47
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:19,626
...this crazy thought
that i'm going to wake up

48
00:04:19,661 --> 00:04:22,128
and none of this
will have happened.

49
00:04:23,379 --> 00:04:27,133
I'll wake up
in a cool bed, and...

50
00:04:27,168 --> 00:04:29,018
it'll be night outside

51
00:04:29,053 --> 00:04:31,521
and there'll be a wind...

52
00:04:31,556 --> 00:04:34,641
branches rustling...

53
00:04:34,676 --> 00:04:37,777
shadows on the sidewalk...

54
00:04:37,812 --> 00:04:40,897
a moon...

55
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:46,536
traffic noises...

56
00:04:48,404 --> 00:04:49,656
automobiles...

57
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,293
garbage cans...

58
00:04:53,328 --> 00:04:57,547
milk bottles...

59
00:04:57,582 --> 00:04:58,798
and voices.

60
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:01,551
There was a scientist
on the radio this morning.

61
00:05:01,586 --> 00:05:04,671
He said that it'll get
a lot hotter, more each day,

62
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,807
now that we're moving
so close to the sun.

63
00:05:07,842 --> 00:05:09,058
And that's why we're...

64
00:05:10,927 --> 00:05:12,812
that's why we're...

65
00:05:14,931 --> 00:05:17,433
the word that mrs. Bronson
is unable to put

66
00:05:17,468 --> 00:05:19,936
into the hot, still, sodden air
is "doomed"

67
00:05:19,971 --> 00:05:21,821
because the people
you've just seen

68
00:05:21,856 --> 00:05:24,324
have been handed
a death sentence.

69
00:05:24,359 --> 00:05:25,575
One month ago,

70
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:27,443
the earth suddenly changed
its elliptical orbit,

71
00:05:27,478 --> 00:05:28,695
and in doing so
began to follow a path

72
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:31,831
which gradually,
moment by moment, day by day,

73
00:05:31,866 --> 00:05:34,334
took it closer to the sun.

74
00:05:34,369 --> 00:05:36,836
And all of man's little devices
to stir up the air

75
00:05:36,871 --> 00:05:38,705
are now no longer luxuries.

76
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,841
They happen to be pitiful
and panicky keys to survival.

77
00:05:41,876 --> 00:05:44,961
The time is five minutes to 12,
midnight.

78
00:05:44,996 --> 00:05:46,846
There is no more darkness.

79
00:05:46,881 --> 00:05:49,966
The place is new york city,
and this is the eve of the end

80
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,720
because even at midnight,
it's high noon,

81
00:05:53,755 --> 00:05:54,971
the hottest day in history,

82
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:59,976
and you're about to spend it
in the twilight zone.

83
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:19,412
Norma, is that
you, honey?

84
00:06:19,447 --> 00:06:20,663
Yes, mrs. Bronson.

85
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:28,805
The store was open.

86
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,673
Wide open.

87
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:31,924
Oh, i think

88
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:33,810
that's the first
time in my life

89
00:06:33,845 --> 00:06:36,312
i was ever sorry
i was born a woman.

90
00:06:36,347 --> 00:06:38,815
This is all
i was strong
enough to carry.

91
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:43,820
There weren't any
clerks around...

92
00:06:43,855 --> 00:06:45,071
thank you.

93
00:06:45,106 --> 00:06:46,939
Just a handful
of people

94
00:06:46,974 --> 00:06:48,825
taking what
they could grab.

95
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:51,944
Well, at least we
won't starve anyway.

96
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:55,698
And there are three cans
of fruit juice in there.

97
00:06:55,733 --> 00:06:56,949
Fruit juice?

98
00:06:58,201 --> 00:06:59,585
Fruit juice?

99
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,705
Oh, norma, could we
open a can now?

100
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:05,208
Oh, of course we
can open a can now.

101
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:09,595
Oh, where's
the can opener?

102
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:12,098
Oh, in the other drawer.

103
00:07:23,726 --> 00:07:26,229
Oh, i'm sorry.

104
00:07:26,264 --> 00:07:29,365
I'm acting
just like an animal, aren't i?

105
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,868
No.

106
00:07:31,903 --> 00:07:33,736
No, no, just...

107
00:07:33,771 --> 00:07:36,873
just like a frightened
woman, that's all.

108
00:07:36,908 --> 00:07:39,992
You should have
seen me in the store

109
00:07:40,027 --> 00:07:42,495
running up and down
the aisles,

110
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:43,746
and i mean running.

111
00:07:43,781 --> 00:07:46,883
Knocking things over
and grabbing things

112
00:07:46,918 --> 00:07:50,636
and throwing them away
and grabbing again.

113
00:07:50,671 --> 00:07:52,505
And at that,
i think i was

114
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:55,007
the calmest person
in the store.

115
00:07:55,042 --> 00:07:59,262
One woman just stood in the
middle of the room and cried.

116
00:07:59,297 --> 00:08:00,513
She cried like a baby,

117
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,649
pleading for someone
to help her.

118
00:08:03,684 --> 00:08:05,902
Ladies and gentlemen.

119
00:08:05,937 --> 00:08:07,770
This is station wnyg

120
00:08:07,805 --> 00:08:10,907
coming on the air
to bring you essential news.

121
00:08:10,942 --> 00:08:14,026
First, a bulletin
from the police department.

122
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:14,777
Keep your doors locked

123
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:17,914
and prepare to protect
yourselves, if necessary,

124
00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:19,782
with any weapons you may have.

125
00:08:19,817 --> 00:08:21,033
A majority of the police force

126
00:08:21,068 --> 00:08:22,919
has been assigned
to the crowded highways

127
00:08:22,954 --> 00:08:25,421
outside this deserted city.

128
00:08:25,456 --> 00:08:27,924
And citizens
remaining in new york

129
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:29,292
may have to protect themselves

130
00:08:29,327 --> 00:08:32,428
from the cranks and looters
known to be roaming the streets.

131
00:08:32,463 --> 00:08:34,297
From the weather bureau:

132
00:08:34,332 --> 00:08:36,048
The temperature
stood at 110 degrees

133
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:37,934
at 11:00 this morning.

134
00:08:37,969 --> 00:08:40,436
Humidity 91%.

135
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:43,689
Forecast for tomorrow...

136
00:08:43,724 --> 00:08:46,809
forecast for tomorrow...

137
00:08:46,844 --> 00:08:48,694
hot.

138
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:49,312
More of the same, only hotter.

139
00:08:49,347 --> 00:08:50,563
Stop it.

140
00:08:50,598 --> 00:08:51,814
I don't care.

141
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:54,317
Who are they kidding
with this weather report stuff?

142
00:08:54,352 --> 00:08:55,568
Ladies and gentlemen,

143
00:08:55,603 --> 00:08:57,453
tomorrow,
you can fry eggs on sidewalks,

144
00:08:57,488 --> 00:08:59,322
heat up soup in the ocean,

145
00:08:59,357 --> 00:09:02,458
and get help from wondering
maniacs if you choose.

146
00:09:02,493 --> 00:09:03,709
What do you mean "panic"?

147
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:04,961
Who's left to panic?

148
00:09:04,996 --> 00:09:07,463
Ladies and gentlemen,

149
00:09:07,498 --> 00:09:09,332
i'm told that
my departing from the script

150
00:09:09,367 --> 00:09:11,834
might panic you and...

151
00:09:11,869 --> 00:09:13,219
let me alone.
Do you hear me?

152
00:09:13,254 --> 00:09:15,721
Let me alone.
Let go of me.

153
00:09:15,756 --> 00:09:16,973
There, you...

154
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,475
you see, mrs. Bronson?

155
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:23,846
You're not the only one
who's frightened.

156
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:29,735
There we are.

157
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:39,996
Go ahead, drink it.

158
00:09:40,031 --> 00:09:41,864
It's grapefruit juice.

159
00:09:41,899 --> 00:09:43,749
No, i can't. I can't
live off you like this.

160
00:09:44,367 --> 00:09:45,618
You need it for yourself.

161
00:09:45,653 --> 00:09:46,869
Mrs. Bronson,

162
00:09:46,904 --> 00:09:49,872
we're going to have to
start living off each other

163
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:51,757
from now on.

164
00:09:54,912 --> 00:09:56,128
Here's looking at you.

165
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:15,031
Current's off again.

166
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:19,402
It stays on a shorter
time each day.

167
00:10:19,437 --> 00:10:26,292
Norma, what if it shuts off
and doesn't come back on again?

168
00:10:26,327 --> 00:10:28,794
This place would
be like an oven.

169
00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:30,663
As hot as it is,

170
00:10:30,698 --> 00:10:34,050
it could be
so much worse.

171
00:10:34,085 --> 00:10:37,803
Oh, norma, it could
be so much worse.

172
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,682
Norma...

173
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:58,441
please paint
something cool today.

174
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:07,199
Paint something...
pastoral...

175
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:12,838
with a waterfall and...

176
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:15,341
trees bending in the wind.

177
00:11:18,461 --> 00:11:22,214
Please paint something cool.

178
00:11:22,249 --> 00:11:29,105
Don't paint the sun anymore!

179
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:34,837
Mrs. Bronson?

180
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:41,710
Mrs. Bronson?

181
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,349
You all right?

182
00:12:47,384 --> 00:12:49,852
Yes, i'm all right.

183
00:12:49,887 --> 00:12:51,103
It's so quiet.

184
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,223
I haven't
heard a sound.

185
00:12:54,258 --> 00:12:56,725
What time is it?

186
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,479
3:00 in the afternoon.

187
00:13:00,514 --> 00:13:02,982
Did you get any sleep?

188
00:13:03,017 --> 00:13:04,867
I laid down awhile.

189
00:13:06,735 --> 00:13:08,621
What was that?

190
00:13:08,656 --> 00:13:11,123
Sounds like
something fell.

191
00:13:11,158 --> 00:13:12,992
No...

192
00:13:13,027 --> 00:13:14,243
it was someone.

193
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:17,997
Didn't you lock
the roof door?

194
00:13:18,032 --> 00:13:18,631
Yes.

195
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:20,499
No, i...

196
00:13:20,534 --> 00:13:21,750
i don't know, i...

197
00:13:21,785 --> 00:13:23,002
i don't remember.

198
00:13:23,037 --> 00:13:24,253
I thought i did.

199
00:13:41,939 --> 00:13:43,772
Hey, somebody in there?

200
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,024
Come on out.

201
00:13:47,276 --> 00:13:49,778
Come on out, baby.

202
00:13:49,813 --> 00:13:52,281
Come on out and be friendly.

203
00:13:52,316 --> 00:13:54,166
I ain't got all day.

204
00:13:54,201 --> 00:13:56,669
If you don't come out,
i'm going to come in.

205
00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:06,929
Did you hear that?

206
00:14:06,964 --> 00:14:08,180
That was a gun.

207
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:10,049
Get out of here.

208
00:14:10,084 --> 00:14:13,185
Down the stairs
and out the front door.

209
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,054
Leave us alone.

210
00:14:15,089 --> 00:14:17,556
Okay, baby.

211
00:14:17,591 --> 00:14:20,693
I never argue with
a lady with a gun.

212
00:14:29,818 --> 00:14:33,572
Oh, i'm so glad he's gone.

213
00:14:33,607 --> 00:14:36,075
He hasn't come out
the front door yet.

214
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:39,211
No!

215
00:14:55,844 --> 00:14:57,096
Crazy dames!

216
00:14:57,131 --> 00:15:00,099
It's too hot to play games.

217
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,485
Much too hot.

218
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:52,534
You do this?

219
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:56,655
You're good.

220
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:58,540
You paint real good.

221
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:00,542
My wife
used to paint.

222
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,544
Please leave
us alone.

223
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:04,413
We didn't do
you any harm.

224
00:16:04,448 --> 00:16:05,664
Please.

225
00:16:21,465 --> 00:16:27,936
She was so fragile,
just... just a little thing.

226
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:34,193
She couldn't take this heat.

227
00:16:35,444 --> 00:16:37,946
I tried to keep her cool...

228
00:16:37,981 --> 00:16:41,083
but she couldn't take the heat!

229
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,710
Baby didn't live
more than an hour.

230
00:16:55,464 --> 00:16:57,349
Then she followed him.

231
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:08,610
I'm not a housebreaker.

232
00:17:08,645 --> 00:17:10,479
I'm a decent man.

233
00:17:10,514 --> 00:17:13,115
I swear to you,
i'm a decent man.

234
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:14,983
I've been
walking around

235
00:17:15,018 --> 00:17:18,120
all... all day
trying to find some water.

236
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,879
I wouldn't hurt you.

237
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,250
I wouldn't do you any harm.

238
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:35,003
Honest.

239
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,140
Please believe me.

240
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:49,268
Please...

241
00:17:49,303 --> 00:17:51,153
please forgive me,
would you?

242
00:17:51,188 --> 00:17:53,655
I'm just
off my rocker.

243
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,780
Please forgive me.

244
00:18:09,538 --> 00:18:10,789
Why doesn't it end?

245
00:18:10,824 --> 00:18:13,792
Why don't we just...

246
00:18:13,827 --> 00:18:15,677
just burn up?

247
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:49,077
I painted it for
you last night.

248
00:18:49,112 --> 00:18:51,580
It's for you.

249
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,968
Oh, it's beautiful, norma.

250
00:18:56,003 --> 00:19:00,973
I've seen waterfalls
just like that before.

251
00:19:01,008 --> 00:19:04,726
There's one near ithaca,
new york.

252
00:19:04,761 --> 00:19:09,097
Yes,
it's the highest waterfall...

253
00:19:09,132 --> 00:19:12,234
the highest waterfall
in this part of the country.

254
00:19:12,269 --> 00:19:15,354
And i love the sound of it.

255
00:19:15,389 --> 00:19:20,359
That wonderful blue water
tumbling over the rocks.

256
00:19:20,394 --> 00:19:24,746
That wonderful,
cool, clear water.

257
00:19:24,781 --> 00:19:25,998
You hear it, norma?

258
00:19:26,033 --> 00:19:27,249
Hear it?

259
00:19:27,284 --> 00:19:30,369
You do hear it,
norma, don't you?

260
00:19:30,404 --> 00:19:32,254
That wonderful
sound?

261
00:19:32,289 --> 00:19:37,125
You know, we could...

262
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:40,879
we could swim
in that waterfall.

263
00:19:40,914 --> 00:19:42,764
Let's do that.

264
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:45,267
Let's swim in it,
shall we?

265
00:19:45,302 --> 00:19:49,021
I used to do that
when i was a little girl.

266
00:19:49,056 --> 00:19:54,026
Just...
just sit there and...

267
00:19:54,061 --> 00:19:58,397
and let the water
come down over me.

268
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:17,299
Mrs. Bronson?

269
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,921
Mrs. Bronson?

270
00:20:27,676 --> 00:20:29,561
Mrs. Bronson?

271
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:52,511
She's coming
out of it now.

272
00:21:52,546 --> 00:21:53,762
Norma?

273
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:56,264
Norma?

274
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,651
Yes?

275
00:21:59,686 --> 00:22:00,902
You were
running

276
00:22:00,937 --> 00:22:03,405
a high fever,
but it's broken now.

277
00:22:03,772 --> 00:22:05,657
Fever?

278
00:22:05,692 --> 00:22:08,160
You gave us a
start, child.

279
00:22:08,195 --> 00:22:09,411
You were so ill,

280
00:22:09,446 --> 00:22:11,279
but you're going
to be all right now.

281
00:22:11,314 --> 00:22:13,165
Isn't she, doctor?

282
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,033
Isn't she going to be all right?

283
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,671
Of course.

284
00:22:24,793 --> 00:22:27,929
I wish i had something
left to give her

285
00:22:27,964 --> 00:22:29,798
but the medicine's

286
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:31,683
pretty much
all gone now.

287
00:22:31,718 --> 00:22:33,552
I won't be able
to come back.

288
00:22:33,587 --> 00:22:36,054
I'm going to move my
family south tomorrow.

289
00:22:36,089 --> 00:22:37,939
My friend has
a private plane.

290
00:22:37,974 --> 00:22:41,693
Well, they say on the
radio, miami is warmer.

291
00:22:41,728 --> 00:22:42,944
So they say.

292
00:22:42,979 --> 00:22:44,813
But we're only
prolonging it.

293
00:22:44,848 --> 00:22:47,315
There was a scientist
on the radio this morning.

294
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:49,201
He was trying
to explain what happened.

295
00:22:49,236 --> 00:22:51,069
How the earth
had changed its orbit

296
00:22:51,104 --> 00:22:52,954
and was starting
to move away from the sun,

297
00:22:52,989 --> 00:22:54,823
and that within one, two,

298
00:22:54,858 --> 00:22:57,325
or maybe three weeks
at the most,

299
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,828
there wouldn't be
any more sun-

300
00:22:59,863 --> 00:23:01,713
we'd all freeze.

301
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,226
Oh, mrs. Bronson.

302
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:19,848
I had such a terrible dream.

303
00:23:19,883 --> 00:23:22,350
It was so hot.

304
00:23:22,385 --> 00:23:25,487
It was daylight
all the time.

305
00:23:25,522 --> 00:23:30,492
There was...
a midnight sun.

306
00:23:30,527 --> 00:23:32,360
There wasn't any night
at all.

307
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,114
No night at all.

308
00:23:39,286 --> 00:23:41,119
Isn't it wonderful

309
00:23:41,154 --> 00:23:46,124
to have darkness
and coolness?

310
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:53,014
Yes, my dear.

311
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:57,385
It's wonderful.

312
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:59,271
The poles of fear,

313
00:23:59,306 --> 00:24:03,024
the extremes of how the earth
might conceivably be doomed.

314
00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:06,778
Minor exercise in the care
and feeding of a nightmare,

315
00:24:06,813 --> 00:24:08,029
respectfully submitted

316
00:24:08,064 --> 00:24:11,783
by all the thermometer-watchers
in the twilight zone.

317
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:18,323
Rod serling,
creator ofthe twilight zone,

318
00:24:18,358 --> 00:24:20,208
will tell you
about next week's story

319
00:24:20,243 --> 00:24:24,496
after this word
from our alternate sponsor.

320
00:24:24,531 --> 00:24:25,997
And now, mr. Serling.

321
00:24:26,032 --> 00:24:28,133
Next week
we move back into time,

322
00:24:28,168 --> 00:24:30,635
back to 1863.

323
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:32,504
A distinguished actor,
mr. Gary merrill,

324
00:24:32,539 --> 00:24:34,389
plays the role
of a confederate scout

325
00:24:34,424 --> 00:24:36,892
who goes off on a patrol
and winds up smack-dab

326
00:24:36,927 --> 00:24:38,760
in the center
of the twilight zone.

327
00:24:38,795 --> 00:24:41,263
Our story is an adaptation
of a strange tale

328
00:24:41,298 --> 00:24:43,765
by manly wade wellman
called "the still valley."

329
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,902
This one is for civil war buffs
and the students of the occult.

330
00:24:46,937 --> 00:24:49,404
I hope you're around
to take a look at it.

331
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:22,637
Hello. I'm celeste holm.

332
00:25:22,672 --> 00:25:24,272
Give through
the refugee aid programs

333
00:25:24,307 --> 00:25:27,392
of the catholic, protestant
and jewish faiths.
