1
00:00:36,465 --> 00:00:39,175
- Yes, sir.
- I got a little grease in this lining.

2
00:00:39,176 --> 00:00:43,346
It'll take a half-hour to check it.
You want me to fill her up, too?

3
00:00:43,347 --> 00:00:46,507
- You better check the oil, too.
- Yes, sir.

4
00:00:48,894 --> 00:00:51,688
- You boys just passing through?
- Yeah.

5
00:00:51,689 --> 00:00:54,262
Pittsburgh? Coming in or going out?

6
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:59,446
- Going in, to a sales convention tomorrow.
- What do you guys sell?

7
00:00:59,447 --> 00:01:03,202
We sell drug supplies.
He is going to get an award.

8
00:01:04,827 --> 00:01:09,324
He sold $17,000 worth last month.
Fastest boy in the territory.

9
00:01:09,415 --> 00:01:11,705
Yeah. Fastest and the "bestest."

10
00:01:12,085 --> 00:01:15,685
- Another round, one for him and yourself.
- Thanks.

11
00:01:16,214 --> 00:01:18,479
Sure is a hot day for driving.

12
00:01:20,218 --> 00:01:23,778
Late afternoon is better.
You have plenty of time.

13
00:01:23,805 --> 00:01:27,145
You can make Pittsburgh
in two or three hours.

14
00:01:27,643 --> 00:01:29,303
He's right.

15
00:01:32,689 --> 00:01:34,599
What do you say, Charlie?

16
00:01:35,025 --> 00:01:37,800
Play a little pool? Wait out the heat?

17
00:01:37,861 --> 00:01:39,696
It'll cost you money. Always does.

18
00:01:39,697 --> 00:01:42,857
Come on, stop stalling.
Grab yourself a cue.

19
00:01:43,868 --> 00:01:45,953
Good thing he can afford it.

20
00:01:46,704 --> 00:01:49,539
Keep them coming. J. T. S. Brown.

21
00:02:10,812 --> 00:02:13,184
You miss again, you lose again.

22
00:02:17,152 --> 00:02:19,779
What is the kid in hock for so far?

23
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,488
About $60, $70.

24
00:02:22,908 --> 00:02:24,486
Next game, $10.

25
00:02:25,077 --> 00:02:29,992
Nice looking boy, clean-cut.
It's too bad he can't hold his liquor.

26
00:02:53,521 --> 00:02:58,436
I made it, boy! I finally made it!
Come on, pay up, pay up, sucker!

27
00:02:59,277 --> 00:03:02,278
You ought to shoot craps with that luck!

28
00:03:02,572 --> 00:03:06,147
- What do you mean, luck?
- You know what I mean.

29
00:03:06,284 --> 00:03:10,149
You couldn't make that shot again
in a million years.

30
00:03:10,205 --> 00:03:14,617
I couldn't? Okay, set them up
the way they were before.

31
00:03:15,251 --> 00:03:18,591
- Why?
- Set them up the way they were before.

32
00:03:18,755 --> 00:03:22,717
I'll bet you $20 that I make that shot
the same way again.

33
00:03:22,718 --> 00:03:26,293
Nobody can make that shot,
not even a lucky lush.

34
00:03:35,064 --> 00:03:36,606
How is that?

35
00:03:39,151 --> 00:03:42,070
- Is that the way they were before?
- Yeah, that's it.

36
00:03:42,071 --> 00:03:43,591
Come on, put it up.

37
00:04:04,803 --> 00:04:06,676
Set them up again.

38
00:04:09,432 --> 00:04:11,462
Come on, set them up again.

39
00:04:12,102 --> 00:04:14,979
You're drunk, boy.
I'm not betting you anymore.

40
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,522
What do you mean?

41
00:04:18,025 --> 00:04:22,445
Let's leave. We have to be
at that convention in the morning.

42
00:04:22,446 --> 00:04:27,492
Up the flagpole with the convention!
Come on, I got my money on the table.

43
00:04:27,493 --> 00:04:30,173
- I don't want it.
- I'll try you.

44
00:04:38,838 --> 00:04:43,768
Don't be a chump. Don't bet
any more money on that damn fool shot!

45
00:04:45,261 --> 00:04:48,764
You figure I'm a little drunk,
I'm loaded on hemp...

46
00:04:48,765 --> 00:04:53,815
... and you just want in real friendly
while the money's still floating?

47
00:04:55,688 --> 00:04:56,720
Okay.

48
00:05:00,443 --> 00:05:02,187
Go ahead. Set them up.

49
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:19,245
You want some easy money? Here's $105.
One week's commission.

50
00:05:20,631 --> 00:05:25,093
You want to take the whole thing?
Then you get a crack at your easy money.

51
00:05:25,094 --> 00:05:27,428
- I'll take a piece of that action.
- Me, too.

52
00:05:27,429 --> 00:05:31,144
- No, I want him!
- I'll take it out of the till.

53
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,505
I'll meet you in the car, chump!

54
00:07:59,546 --> 00:08:01,254
'Morning, Henry.

55
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:36,989
Quiet.

56
00:08:39,754 --> 00:08:41,581
Yeah, like a church.

57
00:08:47,053 --> 00:08:49,303
The Church of the Good Hustler.

58
00:08:49,389 --> 00:08:55,159
It looks like a morgue to me. Those tables
are the slabs they lay the stiffs on.

59
00:08:56,688 --> 00:08:59,013
I'll be alive when I get out.

60
00:09:13,455 --> 00:09:16,029
- Any table?
- Any table.

61
00:09:22,465 --> 00:09:23,164
No bar?

62
00:09:23,257 --> 00:09:28,237
No bar, no pinball machines,
no bowling alleys, just pool. Nothing else.

63
00:09:29,847 --> 00:09:31,840
This is Ames, mister.

64
00:09:41,317 --> 00:09:43,310
"This is Ames, mister."

65
00:10:13,809 --> 00:10:15,802
Nice, clean pocket-drop.

66
00:10:35,832 --> 00:10:38,442
How much am I going to win tonight?

67
00:10:44,132 --> 00:10:48,047
$10,000.
I'm going to win $10,000 in one night.

68
00:10:53,183 --> 00:10:55,010
Who's going to beat me?

69
00:10:57,646 --> 00:11:00,711
Come on, Charlie.
Who's going to beat me?

70
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:03,225
Okay, nobody can beat you.

71
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,689
$10,000!

72
00:11:10,451 --> 00:11:15,531
What other poolroom is there
where a guy can win $10,000 in one night?

73
00:11:18,626 --> 00:11:22,561
I can remember hustling an old man
for a dime a game.

74
00:11:22,755 --> 00:11:26,080
- We got company.
- Are you looking for action?

75
00:11:26,884 --> 00:11:29,644
- Maybe. Want to play?
- No, hell, no.

76
00:11:30,346 --> 00:11:32,941
- Are you Eddie Felson?
- Who's he?

77
00:11:33,767 --> 00:11:37,227
- What's your game? What do you shoot?
- You name it, we shoot it.

78
00:11:37,228 --> 00:11:39,146
Friend, I'm not trying to hustle.

79
00:11:39,147 --> 00:11:44,087
I never hustle people that bring
in leather satchels. Don't hustle me.

80
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:52,285
I'm Eddie Felson. I shoot straight pool.
Got any straight pool shooters here?

81
00:11:52,286 --> 00:11:56,466
- What straight pool game do you like?
- The expensive kind.

82
00:11:57,166 --> 00:12:00,216
You came to play pool
with Minnesota Fats?

83
00:12:01,545 --> 00:12:02,826
That's right.

84
00:12:05,049 --> 00:12:08,551
- Want some free advice?
- How much will it cost?

85
00:12:08,552 --> 00:12:11,767
Who are you, his manager,
friend, his stooge?

86
00:12:11,889 --> 00:12:13,265
He's my partner.

87
00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:17,179
- Well-heeled partner?
- We got enough.

88
00:12:18,688 --> 00:12:22,608
Take the boy home. Fats doesn't need
your money. You can't beat him.

89
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:27,249
No one's beaten him in 15 years.
He's the best in the country.

90
00:12:27,739 --> 00:12:30,169
You got that wrong, mister. I am.

91
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:36,664
Okay, I told you about Minnesota Fats.
You just go ahead and play him, friend.

92
00:12:36,665 --> 00:12:38,916
Tell me where I can find him, friend.

93
00:12:38,917 --> 00:12:42,545
He comes in this poolroom every night
at 8:00 on the nose.

94
00:12:42,546 --> 00:12:44,521
Stay here, he'll find you.

95
00:14:12,222 --> 00:14:14,982
- You shoot a good stick.
- Thank you.

96
00:14:15,558 --> 00:14:20,733
- Do you shoot straight pool, mister?
- Now and then, you know how it is.

97
00:14:24,025 --> 00:14:26,510
You're Minnesota Fats, aren't you?

98
00:14:29,197 --> 00:14:33,532
They say you're the best in the country,
where I come from.

99
00:14:33,535 --> 00:14:34,780
Is that a fact?

100
00:14:37,206 --> 00:14:41,126
They say that old Fats
shoots the eyes off them balls.

101
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:45,338
- Where are you from?
- California. Oakland.

102
00:14:45,339 --> 00:14:49,633
California. Is your name Felson?
Eddie Felson?

103
00:14:50,636 --> 00:14:51,881
That's right.

104
00:14:52,305 --> 00:14:54,860
I hear you've been looking for me.

105
00:14:55,516 --> 00:14:57,311
Yeah, that's right, too.

106
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:02,850
Big John,
do you think this boy is a hustler?

107
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:12,910
Do you like to gamble?
Gamble money on pool games?

108
00:15:14,327 --> 00:15:16,992
Let's shoot a game of straight pool.

109
00:15:19,124 --> 00:15:20,666
$100?

110
00:15:21,585 --> 00:15:25,820
You shoot bigtime pool.
Everyone says you shoot bigtime pool.

111
00:15:27,174 --> 00:15:29,219
Let's make it $200 a game.

112
00:15:31,887 --> 00:15:36,857
Now I know why they call you
"Fast Eddie." You talk my kind of talk.

113
00:15:38,728 --> 00:15:40,720
Sausage, rack them up!

114
00:16:15,515 --> 00:16:18,184
- How do you feel?
- Fast and loose, man.

115
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:19,705
In the gut, I mean?

116
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,937
Tight but good.

117
00:16:47,085 --> 00:16:48,880
Willie, hang on to that.

118
00:17:12,737 --> 00:17:14,231
You break.

119
00:17:36,053 --> 00:17:38,045
I didn't leave you much.

120
00:17:47,606 --> 00:17:49,266
You left enough.

121
00:17:51,235 --> 00:17:52,895
Six in the corner.

122
00:18:06,876 --> 00:18:08,546
Fifteen, in the corner.

123
00:18:15,885 --> 00:18:17,296
Ace, in the side.

124
00:18:23,935 --> 00:18:24,967
Eight.

125
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:35,477
Ten.

126
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,611
Eleven.

127
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:49,826
He is great! That old fat man.

128
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:52,893
Look how he moves. Like a dancer!

129
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,585
Twelve, cross-eyed.

130
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:58,512
And those fingers, them chubby fingers...

131
00:18:59,222 --> 00:19:01,843
... and that stroke...

132
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:05,176
... like he's playing a violin.
- Five ball.

133
00:19:06,563 --> 00:19:08,105
Eight ball.

134
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:15,279
Four long.

135
00:19:29,294 --> 00:19:30,753
Cross corner.

136
00:19:38,804 --> 00:19:40,133
Nice shot.

137
00:19:44,977 --> 00:19:46,140
Safe.

138
00:20:01,453 --> 00:20:02,401
Safe.

139
00:20:18,512 --> 00:20:20,362
Seven ball in the corner.

140
00:20:33,986 --> 00:20:35,528
Six in the corner.

141
00:20:38,032 --> 00:20:39,859
One twenty-five, game.

142
00:20:40,201 --> 00:20:41,232
Thirteen.

143
00:20:43,162 --> 00:20:44,194
Five.

144
00:20:45,415 --> 00:20:46,660
Ten.

145
00:20:48,334 --> 00:20:49,663
Game!

146
00:20:52,755 --> 00:20:54,832
Two in the corner.

147
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:57,092
Thirteen.

148
00:20:58,845 --> 00:21:00,505
One twenty-five, game.

149
00:21:07,854 --> 00:21:09,598
Ace in the corner.

150
00:21:13,735 --> 00:21:14,980
Three ball.

151
00:21:15,696 --> 00:21:17,273
Quit. He's too good.

152
00:21:20,868 --> 00:21:22,623
I'm going to take him!

153
00:21:23,579 --> 00:21:24,907
Your shot.

154
00:21:26,123 --> 00:21:27,368
You miss?

155
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,716
You don't leave much when you miss,
do you?

156
00:21:36,717 --> 00:21:39,217
That's what the game's all about.

157
00:21:44,184 --> 00:21:45,799
Two ball, side pocket.

158
00:21:52,275 --> 00:21:53,853
Very good shot.

159
00:21:54,486 --> 00:21:58,271
I have a hunch, Fat Man,
it's me from here on in.

160
00:21:59,449 --> 00:22:01,174
One ball, corner pocket.

161
00:22:02,869 --> 00:22:07,714
Did that ever happen to you?
Suddenly you feel like you can't miss?

162
00:22:10,502 --> 00:22:15,164
I've dreamed about this game,
Fat Man, every night on the road.

163
00:22:15,674 --> 00:22:16,919
Five ball.

164
00:22:20,346 --> 00:22:22,791
This is my table, man, I own it!

165
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,172
Fifteen ball.

166
00:22:26,435 --> 00:22:27,978
Seven ball.

167
00:22:29,522 --> 00:22:30,637
Four ball.

168
00:22:31,983 --> 00:22:33,311
Game!

169
00:22:41,367 --> 00:22:42,482
Eleven ball.

170
00:22:45,705 --> 00:22:46,737
Rack them!

171
00:22:46,831 --> 00:22:48,990
Ten ball in the corner.

172
00:22:56,717 --> 00:22:59,290
One ball in the corner pocket.

173
00:23:02,264 --> 00:23:03,592
Game!

174
00:23:12,149 --> 00:23:14,142
Pay the man again, Fats.

175
00:23:28,124 --> 00:23:33,035
- How much are we ahead?
- Approximately $1,000.

176
00:23:35,423 --> 00:23:38,460
Fats, let's shoot for $1,000 a game.

177
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:52,064
Get me some White Tavern whiskey,
a glass and some ice.

178
00:23:52,065 --> 00:23:56,692
Preacher, get me some bourbon.
J. T. S. Brown, no ice, no glass.

179
00:24:00,282 --> 00:24:02,109
Get it at Johnny's.

180
00:24:03,786 --> 00:24:05,197
You got a bet.

181
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:36,353
Cash me in.

182
00:24:45,367 --> 00:24:46,762
Two in the corner.

183
00:24:51,415 --> 00:24:52,446
Seven.

184
00:24:57,755 --> 00:24:59,831
Ace in the corner.

185
00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:11,424
Two ball, side pocket.

186
00:25:31,164 --> 00:25:32,991
One twenty-five, game.

187
00:25:33,292 --> 00:25:34,323
Ten ball.

188
00:25:39,715 --> 00:25:41,965
Will you cut that sunshine out?

189
00:26:12,165 --> 00:26:13,446
Hey, mister.

190
00:26:14,459 --> 00:26:17,494
- The name's Gordon, Bert Gordon.
- Mister!

191
00:26:17,921 --> 00:26:23,221
You've been sitting in that spot for hours.
Would you move? It bothers me.

192
00:26:35,773 --> 00:26:37,018
Five ball.

193
00:26:41,028 --> 00:26:42,522
That's game.

194
00:27:09,891 --> 00:27:14,684
- How much we got?
- We have $11, 400 cash, in my pocket.

195
00:27:19,234 --> 00:27:22,904
Preacher, get me some breakfast.
An egg sandwich and coffee.

196
00:27:22,905 --> 00:27:24,655
You want something, Charlie?

197
00:27:24,656 --> 00:27:29,995
Wait. You're coming with me to eat
at the hotel. The pool game is over.

198
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:35,073
No, it isn't, Charlie.
The game is over when Fats says so.

199
00:27:35,459 --> 00:27:37,785
You wanted $10,000, you got it.

200
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:41,480
- Get with it, will you, Charlie?
- Get with what?

201
00:27:43,134 --> 00:27:48,159
You can't see it, can you, Charlie?
You never have. I came after him.

202
00:27:49,098 --> 00:27:51,016
And I'm going to get him.

203
00:27:51,017 --> 00:27:53,185
I'm going with him all the way.

204
00:27:53,186 --> 00:27:57,466
The game is not over until Fats says so.
Is it over, Fats?

205
00:28:05,449 --> 00:28:10,669
I'll beat him, mister. I beat him all night
and I'll beat him all day.

206
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:28,740
I'm the best you've ever seen, Fats.
Even if you beat me I'm still the best.

207
00:28:31,142 --> 00:28:34,427
Stay with this kid. He's a loser.

208
00:28:43,404 --> 00:28:44,815
What did he say?

209
00:28:50,203 --> 00:28:55,073
Twenty-five hours. For twenty-five hours
you've been playing straight.

210
00:28:57,711 --> 00:29:00,421
- Get me a drink, will you?
- You don't need a drink.

211
00:29:00,422 --> 00:29:01,537
Shut up!

212
00:29:04,343 --> 00:29:05,918
Just get me a drink!

213
00:29:32,663 --> 00:29:37,290
$18,000, Eddie! We're ahead $18,000!

214
00:29:59,316 --> 00:30:02,568
I thought this game was over
when Fats said it was.

215
00:30:02,569 --> 00:30:04,147
No. It's over now.

216
00:30:48,158 --> 00:30:51,361
Fast Eddie, let's play some pool.

217
00:30:52,871 --> 00:30:54,365
Let's go, Eddie.

218
00:31:02,798 --> 00:31:04,590
You look beautiful, Fats.

219
00:31:06,427 --> 00:31:10,970
Just like a baby, all pink and powdered up.

220
00:31:27,657 --> 00:31:32,957
What are you trying to do, Eddie?
You beat him bad. Want to kill yourself?

221
00:31:33,121 --> 00:31:36,582
- Are you chicken, Charlie?
- Maybe that's it. I'm chicken.

222
00:31:36,583 --> 00:31:39,013
Go home. Just leave me the money.

223
00:31:39,252 --> 00:31:40,628
Go to hell!

224
00:31:47,052 --> 00:31:48,879
Give me that money!

225
00:31:50,806 --> 00:31:53,776
Come on now. Give it to me. It is mine!

226
00:31:58,272 --> 00:32:00,063
Here. Be a damn fool!

227
00:32:27,469 --> 00:32:29,704
You really look beautiful, Fats.

228
00:33:01,254 --> 00:33:02,499
I'll break.

229
00:33:20,357 --> 00:33:21,519
Nine ball.

230
00:33:28,115 --> 00:33:29,146
Fifteen.

231
00:33:32,703 --> 00:33:34,078
One twenty-five.

232
00:33:43,589 --> 00:33:44,869
Wake up, Eddie.

233
00:33:55,852 --> 00:33:57,262
We lose again.

234
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:37,020
Is this all we have left?

235
00:34:37,853 --> 00:34:41,348
If that's all you got, that's all we got left.

236
00:34:42,358 --> 00:34:45,228
Willie, give me the stake money.

237
00:34:53,828 --> 00:34:55,568
I have about $200 here.

238
00:34:56,456 --> 00:34:58,251
The game is over, Eddie.

239
00:35:03,421 --> 00:35:07,426
Fats, I got about $200 here.
You can't run out on me.

240
00:35:09,219 --> 00:35:10,382
Watch me.

241
00:35:38,082 --> 00:35:39,327
Fats, come on.

242
00:37:21,814 --> 00:37:23,308
I'm sorry, Charlie.

243
00:38:16,203 --> 00:38:18,178
Give me a towel, will you?

244
00:39:06,338 --> 00:39:07,998
Are you sure?

245
00:39:11,552 --> 00:39:13,347
Can I get you something?

246
00:39:14,555 --> 00:39:15,586
Later.

247
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:30,361
A long wait for a bus?

248
00:39:31,031 --> 00:39:32,062
Yes.

249
00:39:34,075 --> 00:39:36,325
How long have you been waiting?

250
00:39:36,703 --> 00:39:37,734
What?

251
00:39:37,829 --> 00:39:40,079
How long have you been waiting?

252
00:39:40,957 --> 00:39:42,286
Since 4:00.

253
00:39:45,003 --> 00:39:47,543
Just a cup of black coffee, please.

254
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,430
Ma'am, wait a minute.

255
00:39:52,469 --> 00:39:54,462
Would you like another cup?

256
00:39:55,848 --> 00:39:57,173
All right. Thanks.

257
00:40:01,312 --> 00:40:03,452
What time does the bus leave?

258
00:40:04,565 --> 00:40:05,763
What bus?

259
00:40:06,359 --> 00:40:07,438
Your bus.

260
00:40:08,402 --> 00:40:09,683
8:00.

261
00:40:16,619 --> 00:40:18,994
That wouldn't give us much time.

262
00:40:22,667 --> 00:40:24,078
You're right.

263
00:40:34,096 --> 00:40:35,554
Hello and goodbye.

264
00:40:52,656 --> 00:40:54,067
Have a nice trip.

265
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:58,736
Thanks. I will.

266
00:41:07,338 --> 00:41:08,583
Give it to me.

267
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:56,333
- How much do I owe you?
- It was paid for by the lady.

268
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:06,560
- Give me some bourbon, J. T. S. Brown.
- Sure.

269
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:11,739
- Want a chaser?
- No.

270
00:42:28,881 --> 00:42:30,801
Did you have a nice trip?

271
00:42:31,175 --> 00:42:32,289
Fair.

272
00:42:33,927 --> 00:42:35,157
May I sit down?

273
00:42:35,179 --> 00:42:38,519
Why not?
We already know each other's secrets.

274
00:42:46,148 --> 00:42:48,521
Thanks for the breakfast.

275
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:55,532
Two ships that pass in the night
should always buy each other breakfast.

276
00:42:55,533 --> 00:42:57,618
Can I buy you another drink?

277
00:43:01,414 --> 00:43:03,789
Another one for me and the lady.

278
00:43:06,169 --> 00:43:07,829
You look different...

279
00:43:09,005 --> 00:43:10,172
... more relaxed.

280
00:43:10,173 --> 00:43:12,498
It's the lights and the Scotch.

281
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:15,594
How come you didn't catch your bus?

282
00:43:15,595 --> 00:43:17,695
I wasn't waiting for a bus.

283
00:43:17,931 --> 00:43:19,807
Then why go to the station?

284
00:43:19,808 --> 00:43:21,948
For the same reason you went.

285
00:43:22,686 --> 00:43:25,751
At that hour, you haven't got much choice.

286
00:43:27,358 --> 00:43:30,561
Besides, I only live three blocks from there.

287
00:43:33,572 --> 00:43:35,031
Where do you live?

288
00:43:36,534 --> 00:43:37,565
Around.

289
00:43:38,077 --> 00:43:39,762
I know where you live.

290
00:43:42,665 --> 00:43:44,875
In a locker in a bus station.

291
00:43:47,712 --> 00:43:50,267
What's it like living in a locker?

292
00:43:51,215 --> 00:43:52,330
Cramped.

293
00:43:54,219 --> 00:43:58,139
Do you always drink like this
so early in the morning?

294
00:43:58,390 --> 00:44:00,985
Do you always ask so many questions?

295
00:44:02,727 --> 00:44:03,925
Not always.

296
00:44:05,897 --> 00:44:10,232
Sometimes I wake up and I can't sleep,
not without a drink.

297
00:44:10,235 --> 00:44:12,625
The bars don't open until 8:00.

298
00:44:14,114 --> 00:44:18,990
Mac, over there, has faith in me.
When I'm broke he trusts me.

299
00:44:20,371 --> 00:44:22,363
Don't you trust me, Mac?

300
00:44:22,998 --> 00:44:24,030
Check.

301
00:44:25,584 --> 00:44:28,962
When I'm not broke,
I usually have a bottle in my room...

302
00:44:28,963 --> 00:44:32,013
... in which case I sleep very well indeed.

303
00:44:33,301 --> 00:44:36,302
You talk kind of funny, but I like it.

304
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:39,045
I used to be an actress.

305
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:40,599
What do you do now?

306
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:46,315
I'm a college girl, two days a week.
On Tuesdays and Thursdays I go to college.

307
00:44:47,565 --> 00:44:49,733
You don't look like a college girl.

308
00:44:49,734 --> 00:44:53,566
I'm the emancipated type,
real emancipated.

309
00:44:54,489 --> 00:44:59,451
I didn't mean that. Whatever that means.
I mean you just don't look young enough.

310
00:44:59,452 --> 00:45:00,532
I'm not.

311
00:45:00,996 --> 00:45:02,663
Then why go to college?

312
00:45:02,664 --> 00:45:06,042
Got nothing else to do
on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

313
00:45:06,043 --> 00:45:08,377
What do you do on the other days?

314
00:45:08,378 --> 00:45:09,576
I drink.

315
00:45:13,509 --> 00:45:15,169
No more.

316
00:45:16,387 --> 00:45:21,547
I'm getting sleepy.
Thank you very much, Mr...

317
00:45:22,351 --> 00:45:24,201
Eddie, the name is Eddie.

318
00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:26,620
The name should be Eddie.

319
00:45:27,982 --> 00:45:29,722
What should my name be?

320
00:45:30,818 --> 00:45:33,320
I don't know, whatever you like it to be.

321
00:45:33,321 --> 00:45:35,946
I like it to be what it is, Sarah.

322
00:45:36,324 --> 00:45:40,452
That's a Biblical name.
Do you want to know its meaning?

323
00:45:43,623 --> 00:45:45,948
I could always get us a bottle.

324
00:45:52,048 --> 00:45:53,080
No.

325
00:45:55,343 --> 00:45:56,802
A fifth of Scotch.

326
00:45:58,347 --> 00:46:02,062
What do you want me to do,
step out in the alley?

327
00:46:05,187 --> 00:46:06,707
I'll take you home.

328
00:46:14,196 --> 00:46:15,311
All right.

329
00:46:36,719 --> 00:46:41,298
It's all right. I'm not drunk, I'm lame.

330
00:47:51,213 --> 00:47:52,707
Why me?

331
00:48:15,154 --> 00:48:17,147
Please! You're too hungry.

332
00:48:32,339 --> 00:48:33,916
Take it. It's yours.

333
00:48:41,848 --> 00:48:45,514
The room is $1. 50 a night,
or $7 by the week.

334
00:48:47,354 --> 00:48:49,479
- By the night.
- In advance.

335
00:50:27,749 --> 00:50:29,089
A bottle of beer.

336
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:38,133
Hey, mister, is it okay if I grab a cue?

337
00:50:38,218 --> 00:50:41,054
- You're Eddie Felson!
- Who is he?

338
00:50:42,723 --> 00:50:45,623
I saw you play at Ames the other night.

339
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:51,470
I'll play you a game
and keep one hand in my pocket.

340
00:50:51,899 --> 00:50:54,454
Man, you're way out of our league.

341
00:51:01,242 --> 00:51:05,452
- What are you stuck for?
- A three. That's enough for me.

342
00:51:07,290 --> 00:51:08,619
Thanks.

343
00:51:10,877 --> 00:51:13,142
Can I buy you fellows a drink?

344
00:51:16,091 --> 00:51:19,776
You know, you shoot good,
but you also shoot lucky.

345
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:23,185
Yeah, I shoot lucky.

346
00:52:59,906 --> 00:53:05,149
- Why did you do that?
- I wanted to see what kind of day it is.

347
00:53:06,330 --> 00:53:08,073
A day like any other.

348
00:53:08,248 --> 00:53:11,353
- People come. People go.
- Give me a drag.

349
00:53:16,799 --> 00:53:19,041
- What time is it?
- 11:00.

350
00:53:21,262 --> 00:53:23,053
I'll be back later.

351
00:53:24,223 --> 00:53:25,468
Why?

352
00:53:29,395 --> 00:53:30,854
Come here.

353
00:53:31,355 --> 00:53:35,602
You need a shave.
You mustn't go looking like that.

354
00:53:35,693 --> 00:53:40,364
There's a razor and shaving cream in
the bathroom, compliments of the house.

355
00:53:40,365 --> 00:53:42,450
Why did you say that, Sarah?

356
00:53:43,076 --> 00:53:46,831
- How do you know my name was Sarah?
- You told me.

357
00:53:47,664 --> 00:53:51,412
I lie. When I'm drunk I lie.

358
00:53:53,086 --> 00:53:55,126
So what's your name today?

359
00:53:56,381 --> 00:53:57,757
It's Sarah.

360
00:53:59,384 --> 00:54:00,547
Eddie...

361
00:54:02,429 --> 00:54:06,749
... I've got troubles
and I think maybe you've got troubles.

362
00:54:07,309 --> 00:54:10,069
Maybe we should leave each other alone.

363
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:19,905
My things are at the hotel.
I'll bring them over later.

364
00:54:21,324 --> 00:54:22,604
I'm not sure.

365
00:54:23,576 --> 00:54:24,856
I don't know.

366
00:54:26,287 --> 00:54:29,822
What do you want to know, and why?

367
00:54:35,129 --> 00:54:36,244
Thank you.

368
00:55:05,744 --> 00:55:09,884
- Where have you been all day?
- At school. It's Thursday.

369
00:55:10,082 --> 00:55:11,411
Oh, I forgot.

370
00:55:12,835 --> 00:55:16,950
You were asleep when I left.
I didn't want to wake you.

371
00:55:19,342 --> 00:55:20,753
Did you go out?

372
00:55:21,719 --> 00:55:24,219
I went out for a couple of hours.

373
00:55:40,947 --> 00:55:42,406
A present.

374
00:55:48,872 --> 00:55:52,847
You know,
I've been living here for almost three years.

375
00:55:53,544 --> 00:55:57,229
Now, in three days,
it seems like I know everybody.

376
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:00,174
When I pass people on the street...

377
00:56:00,175 --> 00:56:04,620
... I want to stop them and say,
"Listen, I've got a fellow!"

378
00:56:10,728 --> 00:56:11,973
Thanks.

379
00:56:18,403 --> 00:56:21,487
Eddie, where do you go when you go out?

380
00:56:24,742 --> 00:56:26,962
Museums, art galleries, concerts.

381
00:56:29,164 --> 00:56:31,749
I believe you
when you say you go to school.

382
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:35,215
- Do you want to go with me?
- Are you kidding?

383
00:56:35,796 --> 00:56:37,076
See that book?

384
00:56:39,424 --> 00:56:44,303
I began it when I first got here,
I haven't finished the first chapter.

385
00:56:44,304 --> 00:56:46,444
Did you read all those books?

386
00:56:47,850 --> 00:56:49,350
Got it all in your head?

387
00:56:49,351 --> 00:56:54,647
When I'm sober. They get a little mixed up
when I'm drunk. Usually they're mixed up.

388
00:56:54,648 --> 00:56:59,328
Stop talking about yourself
like you're a lush. I don't like it.

389
00:56:59,862 --> 00:57:03,031
You should go to a clinic,
and get some treatment.

390
00:57:03,032 --> 00:57:05,392
I'm getting treatment right here.

391
00:57:07,745 --> 00:57:08,908
I'm hungry.

392
00:57:09,706 --> 00:57:11,366
Take your choice.

393
00:57:11,791 --> 00:57:16,361
I got enough so we won't have to leave
the house till Tuesday.

394
00:57:17,130 --> 00:57:19,560
What did all this stuff cost you?

395
00:57:19,632 --> 00:57:23,135
- When you got money, you'll pay.
- I want to know, to keep the score.

396
00:57:23,136 --> 00:57:27,291
The bills are right here.
You didn't say what you wanted.

397
00:57:27,974 --> 00:57:32,349
- Don't you ever cook anything?
- Eggs. How do you like them?

398
00:57:32,854 --> 00:57:33,803
Raw.

399
00:57:36,817 --> 00:57:38,276
I cut my finger.

400
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:42,144
- I got something in my bag.
- It's not bad.

401
00:57:53,209 --> 00:57:55,239
Eddie, what's in that case?

402
00:57:57,380 --> 00:58:01,480
- Haven't you opened it?
- No. Why should I? It's yours.

403
00:58:02,677 --> 00:58:04,197
It's a machine gun.

404
00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:11,525
A guy told me, in the big city
I'd need a machine gun. So I bought one.

405
00:58:16,066 --> 00:58:19,656
Where did you get the money
to pay for all this?

406
00:58:20,654 --> 00:58:24,402
I mean liquor and the groceries
and the rent.

407
00:58:28,453 --> 00:58:31,823
From a rich old man
who used to be my lover.

408
00:58:45,262 --> 00:58:46,507
Hello, Eddie.

409
00:58:50,810 --> 00:58:51,900
Hello, Charlie.

410
00:58:54,230 --> 00:58:55,261
Come on in.

411
00:58:59,235 --> 00:59:02,936
- That's my girl.
- Hello, Eddie's girl.

412
00:59:06,117 --> 00:59:08,092
I looked all over for you.

413
00:59:08,536 --> 00:59:11,822
- How did you find me?
- I asked around.

414
00:59:14,751 --> 00:59:17,926
- Do you want me to go?
- No. Stick around.

415
00:59:20,132 --> 00:59:24,177
- Can we get you a drink?
- I don't want to be no bother.

416
00:59:24,178 --> 00:59:27,180
Don't play it small.
It don't look good on you.

417
00:59:27,181 --> 00:59:31,076
- How do you want me to play? I'm broke.
- So am I.

418
00:59:31,101 --> 00:59:32,133
Sit down.

419
00:59:33,354 --> 00:59:36,019
Would you get us a couple of drinks?

420
00:59:36,899 --> 00:59:42,034
You walked out on me. No goodbye,
no nothing. Like a thief in the dark.

421
00:59:43,155 --> 00:59:46,026
We were partners, more than partners.

422
00:59:46,659 --> 00:59:48,486
He was like a...

423
00:59:49,704 --> 00:59:53,073
- A son.
- Yes, like a son.

424
00:59:54,083 --> 00:59:59,703
I've known him since he was 16.
The first time I saw him in Oakland, I said:

425
00:59:59,798 --> 01:00:04,341
"This is a talented boy.
This is a smart boy."

426
01:00:04,427 --> 01:00:05,672
Talk to me.

427
01:00:07,222 --> 01:00:10,391
I want you to come back
on the road with me.

428
01:00:10,392 --> 01:00:13,912
I have no stomach
for that kind of life anymore.

429
01:00:14,563 --> 01:00:18,983
What is your life like here? Playing the
small rooms, winning a few bucks a day.

430
01:00:18,984 --> 01:00:21,884
I'll connect. I'll get your money back.

431
01:00:22,237 --> 01:00:27,387
Do you intend to play Fats again at Ames?
Is that what's on your mind?

432
01:00:28,285 --> 01:00:32,400
Never been out of it.
I'm going to beat that fat man...

433
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:37,730
... with that curly hair and
those diamond rings and that carnation.

434
01:00:37,795 --> 01:00:43,110
This boy is crazy! They wiped the floor
with him and he wants to go back.

435
01:00:43,301 --> 01:00:47,371
- What for? Another beating?
- You'll get your money back!

436
01:00:47,889 --> 01:00:51,644
He thinks I care about the money.
I care about you.

437
01:00:53,561 --> 01:00:55,646
Do you care about me, Eddie?

438
01:00:56,564 --> 01:00:59,794
We were together a long time,
night and day.

439
01:01:00,235 --> 01:01:02,210
So how do you say goodbye?

440
01:01:03,071 --> 01:01:06,736
You give me the car and $100.

441
01:01:07,576 --> 01:01:12,381
Do you think I care about the dough
or the car? I care about you.

442
01:01:13,999 --> 01:01:17,585
This boy is the greatest pool hustler
you ever saw.

443
01:01:17,586 --> 01:01:21,671
A high-class con man.
He can charm anybody into anything.

444
01:01:22,591 --> 01:01:26,761
Did he tell you how well we did
on the road? We had everything.

445
01:01:26,762 --> 01:01:29,088
We ate well, we slept late...

446
01:01:29,181 --> 01:01:32,961
... we had money to burn.
Whiskey, dames... Excuse me.

447
01:01:34,312 --> 01:01:36,687
I tell you what, take her along.

448
01:01:37,065 --> 01:01:40,776
And if you don't want to start right away,
we won't start right away.

449
01:01:40,777 --> 01:01:44,488
We'll drive to Miami.
Get it all out of your system.

450
01:01:44,489 --> 01:01:47,624
Have a few laughs, a few weeks in the sun.

451
01:01:51,871 --> 01:01:55,446
- With what?
- Don't worry, I'll raise the money.

452
01:01:56,376 --> 01:02:00,226
- Yeah? Where?
- What's the difference? I'll raise it.

453
01:02:04,343 --> 01:02:06,303
Could I have another drink?

454
01:02:23,112 --> 01:02:25,487
Did you hold out on me, Charlie?

455
01:02:27,658 --> 01:02:28,939
How much?

456
01:02:30,119 --> 01:02:31,198
How much?

457
01:02:34,707 --> 01:02:39,037
My 25%. Approximately $1, 500.

458
01:02:41,047 --> 01:02:46,072
You crumb! With that much
I could have beat him! That's all I needed.

459
01:02:46,970 --> 01:02:48,429
Give me the money!

460
01:02:48,930 --> 01:02:52,516
- What for, to play Fats again?
- Yes, I'll play Fats again!

461
01:02:52,517 --> 01:02:56,020
If you want to come back on the road,
the money is yours...

462
01:02:56,021 --> 01:02:59,211
... but not if you want to give it to Fats.

463
01:02:59,274 --> 01:03:00,650
What do you say?

464
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:07,450
You still don't see, do you, Charlie?
You're nothing but a small-time Charlie.

465
01:03:08,450 --> 01:03:11,494
You would love to keep me hustling,
wouldn't you?

466
01:03:11,495 --> 01:03:15,165
In a couple more years,
with me playing in those little towns...

467
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:18,043
... you might be able to buy a poolroom
in Oakland...

468
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:21,039
... six tables and a handbook on the side.

469
01:03:22,048 --> 01:03:24,658
Is that when you say goodbye to me?

470
01:03:25,301 --> 01:03:29,221
- Is that what you think?
- Yeah. That's what I think.

471
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:32,851
All right, that's what I want...

472
01:03:34,227 --> 01:03:37,732
... a poolroom and a little handbook
on the side.

473
01:03:38,106 --> 01:03:39,517
I'm getting old.

474
01:03:42,402 --> 01:03:46,337
Lay down and die by yourself.
Don't take me with you.

475
01:03:53,205 --> 01:03:56,325
- Just like that.
- Yes, just like that!

476
01:04:13,226 --> 01:04:15,766
Thanks for the drink, Eddie's girl.

477
01:04:30,827 --> 01:04:32,487
Give me another drink.

478
01:04:34,956 --> 01:04:35,988
Boy.

479
01:04:36,792 --> 01:04:39,793
Everybody wants a piece of me!

480
01:04:47,803 --> 01:04:49,463
Won't you have one?

481
01:04:55,561 --> 01:04:59,026
What did he have to come back here for,
anyway?

482
01:05:04,195 --> 01:05:05,309
Come here.

483
01:05:06,322 --> 01:05:07,437
Come here.

484
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:53,118
- Are you going out?
- For a little while.

485
01:06:01,679 --> 01:06:03,257
Are you okay?

486
01:06:30,125 --> 01:06:31,703
What are you writing?

487
01:06:32,961 --> 01:06:36,627
It's a story. A story I'm making up.

488
01:06:44,890 --> 01:06:46,266
Give it to me.

489
01:06:48,853 --> 01:06:51,048
What is this supposed to mean?

490
01:06:51,731 --> 01:06:53,522
Give it back to me!

491
01:07:03,826 --> 01:07:05,118
What does this mean?

492
01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:10,364
"We have a contract of depravity.
All we have to do is draw the blinds."

493
01:07:18,925 --> 01:07:21,084
Write yourself another story!

494
01:07:21,928 --> 01:07:24,467
Well, what else have we got?

495
01:07:26,183 --> 01:07:28,253
We never talk about anything.

496
01:07:29,478 --> 01:07:34,105
We stay here in this room
and we drink and we make love.

497
01:07:36,277 --> 01:07:37,771
We're strangers!

498
01:07:39,071 --> 01:07:42,921
What happens when the liquor
and money run out, Eddie?

499
01:07:43,326 --> 01:07:46,046
You told Charlie to lay down and die.

500
01:07:46,704 --> 01:07:48,914
Will you say that to me, too?

501
01:07:51,793 --> 01:07:53,620
What happens, Eddie?

502
01:07:55,880 --> 01:08:01,595
- You find another rich old lover.
- That's right. And I'm sure you'll help me!

503
01:08:06,808 --> 01:08:09,073
Are you waiting for me to cry?

504
01:08:11,146 --> 01:08:12,640
You bum!

505
01:08:13,398 --> 01:08:15,438
You poolroom bum!

506
01:08:28,622 --> 01:08:31,272
- Give me a bottle of beer.
- Right.

507
01:08:34,587 --> 01:08:37,942
- How did you make out?
- I made a few bucks.

508
01:08:38,507 --> 01:08:40,796
- Poker game?
- Yeah.

509
01:08:40,885 --> 01:08:42,379
Is it open?

510
01:08:46,516 --> 01:08:47,595
It's open.

511
01:08:48,476 --> 01:08:51,361
- What will you have?
- Give me a beer.

512
01:08:59,321 --> 01:09:01,278
- Okay?
- Sit down.

513
01:09:04,409 --> 01:09:07,349
- What's the limit?
- Half and a dollar.

514
01:09:08,246 --> 01:09:10,896
- Give me $10 worth of chips.
- $10.

515
01:09:13,418 --> 01:09:16,622
- Make it $20.
- $20.

516
01:09:19,967 --> 01:09:20,998
Cut.

517
01:09:22,052 --> 01:09:23,084
Deal.

518
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:37,774
- Bourbon. J. T. S. Brown.
- Two.

519
01:09:39,612 --> 01:09:41,272
I'm buying.

520
01:09:42,282 --> 01:09:44,477
I thought you only drank milk.

521
01:09:45,118 --> 01:09:47,478
- Only when I work.
- Yeah? Why?

522
01:09:48,747 --> 01:09:51,027
I like it. It's good for you.

523
01:09:51,291 --> 01:09:56,991
If you're gambling, whiskey gives you
an excuse for losing. You don't need that.

524
01:09:58,090 --> 01:10:01,759
- How did you make out in the poker game?
- I lost $20.

525
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:03,445
Poker's not your game.

526
01:10:03,470 --> 01:10:06,092
- What is?
- Pool.

527
01:10:09,435 --> 01:10:10,893
Are you being cute?

528
01:10:12,354 --> 01:10:17,233
No pool player shoots better pool
than you shot the other night at Ames.

529
01:10:17,234 --> 01:10:21,209
- You have talent.
- So I have talent. So what beat me?

530
01:10:22,323 --> 01:10:25,359
- Character.
- Yeah, sure.

531
01:10:25,826 --> 01:10:30,491
You're damn right, I'm sure.
Everybody has talent. I have talent.

532
01:10:30,915 --> 01:10:35,961
You think you can play big-money pool
or poker for 40 hours with only talent?

533
01:10:35,962 --> 01:10:40,517
Is Fats the best in the country
just because he has talent? No.

534
01:10:41,009 --> 01:10:44,511
He has more character in one finger
than you have in your body.

535
01:10:44,512 --> 01:10:47,723
- I got drunk.
- He drank as much whiskey as you did.

536
01:10:47,724 --> 01:10:50,601
- He knows how to drink.
- You bet he knows how.

537
01:10:50,602 --> 01:10:52,922
You think that's a talent, too?

538
01:10:53,105 --> 01:10:55,439
You think Fats was born
knowing how to drink?

539
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:59,687
Okay, what do I do now?
Lie down and bow from the ankles?

540
01:11:00,529 --> 01:11:03,322
- What do I do, go home?
- That's your problem.

541
01:11:03,323 --> 01:11:04,568
Or do I stay?

542
01:11:05,868 --> 01:11:09,443
Stay until I hustle up
enough to play Fats again.

543
01:11:10,539 --> 01:11:14,499
Maybe, by that time,
I'll have developed some character.

544
01:11:16,045 --> 01:11:19,235
Maybe, by that time, you'll die of old age.

545
01:11:20,925 --> 01:11:24,092
- How much will you need?
- $1,000.

546
01:11:25,888 --> 01:11:27,383
At least $3,000.

547
01:11:28,349 --> 01:11:31,643
He'll start at $500 a game,
and he'll beat the pants off you.

548
01:11:31,644 --> 01:11:35,064
That's the way he plays against a man
who knows the way the game is.

549
01:11:35,065 --> 01:11:39,385
He'll beat you five times or more,
depending on your nerves.

550
01:11:40,570 --> 01:11:45,995
He might be scared of you. That could
change things, but don't count on it.

551
01:11:46,618 --> 01:11:50,533
How do you know
when nobody knows that much?

552
01:11:52,124 --> 01:11:55,009
Did you see that big car parked outside?

553
01:11:55,586 --> 01:11:58,291
Well, that's mine. I like that car.

554
01:11:58,922 --> 01:12:03,927
I get a new one every year, because I know
what guys like you and him will do.

555
01:12:03,928 --> 01:12:07,597
I made enough off you the other night
to pay for it twice over.

556
01:12:07,598 --> 01:12:10,428
In that case, you owe me another drink.

557
01:12:12,395 --> 01:12:13,426
Eddie?

558
01:12:14,939 --> 01:12:18,569
- May I get personal?
- What have you been so far?

559
01:12:19,152 --> 01:12:21,182
Eddie, you're a born loser.

560
01:12:23,990 --> 01:12:26,130
What's that supposed to mean?

561
01:12:26,409 --> 01:12:30,964
It was the first time
I'd ever seen Fats hooked, really hooked.

562
01:12:31,373 --> 01:12:34,148
- But you let him off.
- I got drunk.

563
01:12:34,292 --> 01:12:37,002
Sure you did.
You have the best excuse for losing.

564
01:12:37,003 --> 01:12:39,922
No trouble losing
when you have a good excuse.

565
01:12:39,923 --> 01:12:44,533
But winning, that can be heavy
on your back, too, like a monkey.

566
01:12:44,553 --> 01:12:49,223
You can drop that load with an excuse.
You have to learn to feel sorry for yourself.

567
01:12:49,224 --> 01:12:53,811
It's one of the best indoor sports, feeling
sorry for yourself, and enjoyed by all.

568
01:12:53,812 --> 01:12:57,467
- Especially the born losers.
- Thanks for the drink.

569
01:12:58,484 --> 01:13:01,659
- Wait. Maybe I can help you.
- To do what?

570
01:13:01,987 --> 01:13:04,982
- Get the $3,000, play Fats again.
- Why?

571
01:13:06,117 --> 01:13:10,743
Ten reasons, maybe fifteen.
Also there's something in it for me.

572
01:13:10,997 --> 01:13:13,570
- I figured that. How much?
- 75%.

573
01:13:14,083 --> 01:13:15,643
- For who?
- For me.

574
01:13:18,171 --> 01:13:22,833
That's a big slice.
Who do you think you are, General Motors?

575
01:13:24,177 --> 01:13:26,679
How much do you think
you are worth these days?

576
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:30,850
I'm supplying the money and time,
for that I get 75% return, if you win.

577
01:13:30,851 --> 01:13:33,227
- You think I can lose?
- That's all I've seen.

578
01:13:33,228 --> 01:13:37,853
- You saw me win $18,000.
- You want to hustle pool, don't you?

579
01:13:38,442 --> 01:13:42,028
The game isn't like football.
Nobody pays you for yardage.

580
01:13:42,029 --> 01:13:44,364
When you hustle,
you keep score real simple.

581
01:13:44,365 --> 01:13:48,201
At the end of the game, you count
your money to find out who is best.

582
01:13:48,202 --> 01:13:53,243
Why back me, then?
Back yourself, play poker and get rich.

583
01:13:53,416 --> 01:13:59,131
I am already rich, but I like action.
That's one thing you're good for, action.

584
01:13:59,547 --> 01:14:03,379
Besides, like I say, you've got talent.

585
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:07,713
You already told me that.

586
01:14:08,973 --> 01:14:12,976
You cut that slice down to bite-size,
and maybe we can talk.

587
01:14:12,977 --> 01:14:16,997
We don't talk. I don't make bad bets.
It is 75%-25%.

588
01:14:18,024 --> 01:14:20,515
- Kiss off.
- Wait.

589
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:30,161
- What'll you do about the money?
- There are places. I'll scuffle around.

590
01:14:30,162 --> 01:14:35,422
The word's out on you, Eddie.
In the wrong place, they'll eat you alive.

591
01:14:37,419 --> 01:14:39,412
When did you adopt me?

592
01:14:41,048 --> 01:14:43,038
I don't know when it was.

593
01:15:27,467 --> 01:15:29,709
- Hi.
- Hi.

594
01:15:37,060 --> 01:15:40,061
You lucky punk. I quit you!

595
01:15:43,316 --> 01:15:45,056
Do you want in, friend?

596
01:15:45,986 --> 01:15:50,721
- How much are you playing for?
- $1 on the five. $2 on the nine.

597
01:15:51,199 --> 01:15:55,629
- I'll play a couple of games, just for kicks.
- Okay, friend.

598
01:15:56,663 --> 01:15:58,074
That's it for me.

599
01:16:01,001 --> 01:16:02,921
That does it for me, too.

600
01:16:03,295 --> 01:16:06,673
- Are you quitting, too?
- You're a pretty good player.

601
01:16:06,674 --> 01:16:10,014
- How much are you ahead?
- A couple of bucks.

602
01:16:10,386 --> 01:16:14,848
- It's just you and me.
- I guess it is, boy. Just you and me.

603
01:16:14,849 --> 01:16:19,434
Do you want to raise the bet?
$2 on the five. $5 on the nine.

604
01:16:21,064 --> 01:16:24,474
You know, kid,
I think maybe you're a hustler.

605
01:16:24,651 --> 01:16:26,193
- Try me.
- Shoot.

606
01:16:27,112 --> 01:16:28,143
Okay.

607
01:16:49,051 --> 01:16:52,006
You sure you don't want to quit, friend?

608
01:16:52,388 --> 01:16:56,053
Let's cut out the small stuff.
$100 freeze-out.

609
01:16:56,892 --> 01:16:59,853
Ten games at $10 a game,
the winner takes all.

610
01:16:59,854 --> 01:17:01,774
Then we'll see who quits.

611
01:17:02,106 --> 01:17:04,099
Okay, friend, you're on.

612
01:17:05,568 --> 01:17:07,525
- Call it.
- Heads.

613
01:17:10,072 --> 01:17:11,401
You win.

614
01:17:23,545 --> 01:17:25,560
You better not miss, friend.

615
01:17:26,756 --> 01:17:31,741
I don't rattle, kid.
But just for that, I'm going to beat you flat!

616
01:17:38,518 --> 01:17:39,717
That's one.

617
01:17:46,360 --> 01:17:47,558
That's five.

618
01:17:50,447 --> 01:17:51,610
That's six.

619
01:17:57,872 --> 01:17:58,986
That's ten.

620
01:17:59,707 --> 01:18:02,662
You two-bit punk, come on. Pay up, $100!

621
01:18:07,799 --> 01:18:11,168
- You quitting, friend?
- Yes, I'm quitting.

622
01:18:29,071 --> 01:18:33,234
Why, you're a pool shark, boy.
A real pool shark.

623
01:18:34,660 --> 01:18:38,574
- So is he.
- You're better than he was. Much better.

624
01:18:40,958 --> 01:18:42,951
There's your money, boy.

625
01:18:51,510 --> 01:18:53,305
There's your money, boy.

626
01:18:59,977 --> 01:19:01,223
Pool shark!

627
01:19:01,896 --> 01:19:03,141
Wait a minute.

628
01:19:05,191 --> 01:19:07,516
Let's give this boy his money.

629
01:19:09,696 --> 01:19:12,071
We always pay what we lose, boy.

630
01:19:15,869 --> 01:19:19,224
We've got no use for pool sharks
around here!

631
01:19:54,031 --> 01:19:56,783
- Who is it?
- It's me, Eddie.

632
01:20:26,606 --> 01:20:27,851
What happened?

633
01:20:31,028 --> 01:20:32,226
I got beat up.

634
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:39,738
They broke my thumbs.

635
01:20:42,206 --> 01:20:43,237
God!

636
01:20:44,792 --> 01:20:47,461
Sarah, they broke my thumbs.

637
01:20:51,007 --> 01:20:52,382
Broke my thumbs.

638
01:21:07,607 --> 01:21:08,887
It's all right.

639
01:21:10,777 --> 01:21:11,808
I'm here.

640
01:22:21,141 --> 01:22:23,531
You can read it if you want to.

641
01:22:25,604 --> 01:22:29,154
Do you want to go out for a while?
To a movie?

642
01:22:32,069 --> 01:22:35,652
- Do you want a drink?
- No, do you?

643
01:22:44,749 --> 01:22:47,240
What's it so hot in here for?

644
01:22:56,261 --> 01:22:57,292
Please!

645
01:23:58,283 --> 01:24:01,638
- Sarah, do you think I'm a loser?
- A loser?

646
01:24:02,663 --> 01:24:03,694
Yeah.

647
01:24:04,331 --> 01:24:08,501
I met this guy, Bert Gordon.
He said I was a born loser.

648
01:24:09,419 --> 01:24:11,959
- Would he know?
- He knows a lot.

649
01:24:13,757 --> 01:24:16,842
- Why did he tell you?
- I'm not sure.

650
01:24:17,344 --> 01:24:21,899
He says there are people
who always look for an excuse to lose.

651
01:24:22,850 --> 01:24:26,480
- What does this Bert Gordon do?
- He's a gambler.

652
01:24:27,521 --> 01:24:30,273
- Is he a winner?
- He owns things.

653
01:24:32,026 --> 01:24:35,476
- Is that what makes a winner?
- What else does?

654
01:24:37,824 --> 01:24:40,929
- Does it bother you, what he said?
- Yeah.

655
01:24:43,788 --> 01:24:45,947
It bothers me a lot.

656
01:24:46,916 --> 01:24:50,476
Because, you see, twice,
once at Ames with Fats...

657
01:24:51,505 --> 01:24:53,865
... and then again at Arthur's...

658
01:24:54,633 --> 01:24:58,344
That cheap, crummy poolroom.
Why did I do it, Sarah?

659
01:24:58,345 --> 01:25:02,500
I could have beat that guy cold.
He never would've known.

660
01:25:03,267 --> 01:25:05,259
I just had to show him.

661
01:25:05,728 --> 01:25:10,768
I had to show those punks
how great the game can be when it's great.

662
01:25:12,151 --> 01:25:15,152
You know, anything can be great, anything.

663
01:25:15,571 --> 01:25:18,456
Bricklaying can be great if a guy knows.

664
01:25:18,991 --> 01:25:24,101
If he knows what he's doing and why,
and if he can make it come off.

665
01:25:24,497 --> 01:25:28,246
Why, when I'm really going, I feel like a...

666
01:25:31,129 --> 01:25:36,467
Like a jockey must feel sitting on his horse,
with all that speed and power underneath.

667
01:25:36,468 --> 01:25:40,137
He's coming into the stretch,
the pressure's on and he knows.

668
01:25:40,138 --> 01:25:44,467
He just feels when to let it go,
and how much.

669
01:25:45,602 --> 01:25:49,217
He's got everything working for him.
Timing, touch.

670
01:25:50,941 --> 01:25:52,898
It's a great feeling.

671
01:25:53,861 --> 01:25:57,864
A real great feeling,
when you're right and you know it.

672
01:25:57,865 --> 01:26:02,610
Suddenly, there's oil in my arm.
The pool cue is part of me.

673
01:26:02,995 --> 01:26:07,745
The pool cue has nerves in it.
It's a piece of wood with nerves.

674
01:26:08,626 --> 01:26:13,596
Feel the roll of those balls.
You don't have to look, you just know.

675
01:26:14,632 --> 01:26:17,972
You make shots
that nobody's ever made before.

676
01:26:19,095 --> 01:26:23,971
And you play that game
the way nobody's ever played it before.

677
01:26:25,810 --> 01:26:28,545
You're not a loser, you're a winner.

678
01:26:30,648 --> 01:26:33,808
Some men never feel that way
about anything.

679
01:26:34,945 --> 01:26:36,605
I love you, Eddie.

680
01:26:46,331 --> 01:26:48,926
Some day, Sarah, you'll settle down.

681
01:26:51,003 --> 01:26:56,413
You'll marry a college professor.
You'll write a great book, maybe about me.

682
01:26:57,218 --> 01:26:59,709
"Fast Eddie Felson, Hustler."

683
01:27:06,435 --> 01:27:08,095
I love you.

684
01:27:10,857 --> 01:27:12,542
Do you need the words?

685
01:27:13,776 --> 01:27:15,806
Yes, I need them very much.

686
01:27:17,030 --> 01:27:21,200
If you ever say them,
I'll never let you take them back.

687
01:27:44,057 --> 01:27:45,552
You glad?

688
01:27:47,978 --> 01:27:49,805
Yes, I'm glad.

689
01:28:13,379 --> 01:28:14,624
Hello, Eddie.

690
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:16,919
Hi.

691
01:28:17,342 --> 01:28:19,749
- How's business?
- Slow.

692
01:28:20,387 --> 01:28:25,892
- Something wrong with your hand?
- I had an accident. A place called Arthur's.

693
01:28:26,226 --> 01:28:28,269
You seem to do all right that way.

694
01:28:28,270 --> 01:28:30,990
My game is about 20% off, maybe more.

695
01:28:32,065 --> 01:28:36,605
- Did somebody step on your hand?
- A big creep broke my thumbs.

696
01:28:36,737 --> 01:28:38,397
A man named Turk?

697
01:28:39,907 --> 01:28:41,824
You know everybody, don't you?

698
01:28:41,825 --> 01:28:45,235
Everybody who can hurt me or help me.
It pays.

699
01:28:45,412 --> 01:28:48,282
- You should give me lessons.
- Sign up.

700
01:28:48,749 --> 01:28:50,576
Where do I sign?

701
01:28:51,085 --> 01:28:54,921
The first match I have in mind
is in Louisville, Kentucky.

702
01:28:54,922 --> 01:28:57,382
Name the place, boss, I'll be there.

703
01:28:57,383 --> 01:29:00,218
- What happened?
- Like I told you, my thumbs.

704
01:29:00,219 --> 01:29:02,471
I don't mean the thumbs.
You already told me.

705
01:29:02,472 --> 01:29:05,562
- I've been thinking.
- Thinking about what?

706
01:29:07,936 --> 01:29:11,981
Maybe I'm not such a great piece
of property right now.

707
01:29:12,565 --> 01:29:17,465
A 25% slice of something big
is better than a 100% slice of nothing.

708
01:29:18,780 --> 01:29:20,810
Give us a couple of drinks.

709
01:29:21,992 --> 01:29:23,652
J. T. S. Brown.

710
01:29:31,752 --> 01:29:33,972
- Good evening, sir.
- 'Evening.

711
01:29:35,631 --> 01:29:39,716
- Give us a nice quiet table.
- Yes, sir, right this way.

712
01:30:04,911 --> 01:30:07,561
Would you like a drink before dinner?

713
01:30:07,789 --> 01:30:08,702
Okay?

714
01:30:09,708 --> 01:30:12,958
Sherry, very old, very dry.

715
01:30:14,838 --> 01:30:15,869
Two.

716
01:30:17,591 --> 01:30:18,919
Sherry?

717
01:30:23,388 --> 01:30:28,134
- It's a nice joint. You look very pretty.
- I feel pretty.

718
01:30:32,022 --> 01:30:34,272
- What's so funny?
- Your tie.

719
01:30:34,775 --> 01:30:37,440
I've never seen you wear one before.

720
01:30:38,696 --> 01:30:41,291
There's a first time for everything.

721
01:30:50,708 --> 01:30:52,286
Yeah, that's great.

722
01:30:57,382 --> 01:30:58,497
Excuse me.

723
01:31:17,820 --> 01:31:19,065
To you, Eddie.

724
01:31:35,963 --> 01:31:37,505
Thank you, sir.

725
01:31:42,387 --> 01:31:44,047
What is it, Eddie?

726
01:31:46,099 --> 01:31:47,641
Want another drink?

727
01:31:49,102 --> 01:31:51,257
What do you want to tell me?

728
01:31:51,938 --> 01:31:54,893
I'll be leaving town for a little while.

729
01:31:59,529 --> 01:32:01,023
For how long?

730
01:32:02,115 --> 01:32:04,950
- I don't know.
- A week, a year?

731
01:32:06,370 --> 01:32:10,237
- More like a week. I'll be back.
- Sure.

732
01:32:11,792 --> 01:32:13,203
Let's go home.

733
01:32:36,484 --> 01:32:37,515
Taxi!

734
01:32:38,236 --> 01:32:41,153
- No, I'll walk.
- Come here.

735
01:32:58,507 --> 01:33:00,702
Better get some dry things on.

736
01:33:14,356 --> 01:33:17,975
- Don't you want to know where I'm going?
- No.

737
01:33:21,572 --> 01:33:25,702
Yes, I want to know what for,
but I don't want to ask.

738
01:33:33,334 --> 01:33:36,962
I'm going to Kentucky,
to Louisville with a friend.

739
01:33:36,963 --> 01:33:40,568
I'm going to try to make some money.
I need it.

740
01:33:41,718 --> 01:33:44,093
I'll leave early in the morning.

741
01:33:44,429 --> 01:33:47,632
- Leave now.
- Grow up.

742
01:33:49,559 --> 01:33:50,674
Why should I?

743
01:33:50,894 --> 01:33:54,146
I'm going there to play pool
with a guy named Findley.

744
01:33:54,147 --> 01:33:57,047
I need the action and I need the money.

745
01:33:57,359 --> 01:33:59,239
I told you I'd be back.

746
01:33:59,737 --> 01:34:04,240
If you were returning, you wouldn't
have taken me out or bought this dress.

747
01:34:04,241 --> 01:34:08,036
You're hustling me.
You've never stopped hustling me.

748
01:34:08,329 --> 01:34:13,244
No, I've never hustled you,
even when I thought I was, you know it.

749
01:34:13,876 --> 01:34:16,211
Do you want me to sit and wait?

750
01:34:16,212 --> 01:34:19,882
Faithful little Sarah.
Pull the shades down and sit.

751
01:34:20,299 --> 01:34:23,510
When you feel like coming back,
you'll come back and love me.

752
01:34:23,511 --> 01:34:27,736
And then you'll go away again.
Is that your idea of love?

753
01:34:28,683 --> 01:34:30,673
I've got no idea of love.

754
01:34:32,479 --> 01:34:38,084
Neither one of us would know what it was
if we saw it coming down the street.

755
01:34:38,401 --> 01:34:39,564
I'd know it.

756
01:34:42,614 --> 01:34:43,812
I'd know it.

757
01:34:46,118 --> 01:34:49,198
For God's sake, what are you doing to me?

758
01:34:50,038 --> 01:34:51,201
I love you.

759
01:34:52,916 --> 01:34:55,346
What's your idea of love, chains?

760
01:34:58,839 --> 01:34:59,954
No.

761
01:35:07,932 --> 01:35:10,322
I made you up, didn't I, Eddie?

762
01:35:13,271 --> 01:35:14,682
You weren't real.

763
01:35:15,356 --> 01:35:17,896
I made you up like everything else.

764
01:35:19,402 --> 01:35:21,597
There was no car crash, Eddie.

765
01:35:23,448 --> 01:35:25,603
When I was five I had polio.

766
01:35:26,826 --> 01:35:30,816
I was never an actress.
The rich old man is my father.

767
01:35:31,998 --> 01:35:34,788
He walked out on us when I was seven.

768
01:35:35,252 --> 01:35:39,657
He sends a check every month
to buy his way out of my life.

769
01:35:40,299 --> 01:35:41,929
The men I've known...

770
01:35:43,093 --> 01:35:48,118
... after they'd left, I'd say,
"They weren't real, I made them up."

771
01:35:49,183 --> 01:35:52,433
But you, Eddie, I wanted you to be real.

772
01:35:57,274 --> 01:35:58,769
I'm so scared!

773
01:36:00,152 --> 01:36:01,315
I'm scared.

774
01:36:16,878 --> 01:36:20,461
- Sarah Packard, Bert Gordon.
- How do you do?

775
01:36:25,345 --> 01:36:28,139
That one of mine goes in Drawing Room A.

776
01:36:28,140 --> 01:36:29,634
Thank you.

777
01:36:30,142 --> 01:36:31,552
I got it.

778
01:36:35,397 --> 01:36:40,225
- You sure you'll be comfortable, Miss...
- Packard. Sarah Packard.

779
01:36:40,319 --> 01:36:42,820
It takes me a while to memorize a name.

780
01:36:42,821 --> 01:36:46,866
- Are you sure you don't want anything?
- No, I'm fine.

781
01:36:47,868 --> 01:36:50,912
You ever been to Louisville for Derby week,
Miss Packard?

782
01:36:50,913 --> 01:36:56,543
- I've never been to Louisville.
- Lots of action, lots of money, lots of class.

783
01:36:56,669 --> 01:36:59,880
You see the best dressed,
most beautiful women in the world.

784
01:36:59,881 --> 01:37:01,386
Knock your eyes out.

785
01:37:06,846 --> 01:37:11,551
Findley is rich. His grandfather
left him 20% of a tobacco company.

786
01:37:11,851 --> 01:37:13,761
What, and he hustles, too?

787
01:37:14,437 --> 01:37:19,233
He's a gentleman, a gentleman gambler
who gets his kicks playing with hustlers.

788
01:37:19,234 --> 01:37:22,194
He's got an old southern mansion,
with a pool table.

789
01:37:22,195 --> 01:37:25,406
He drinks eight-year-old bourbon,
smokes cork-tipped cigarettes.

790
01:37:25,407 --> 01:37:27,199
- How good is he?
- I don't know.

791
01:37:27,200 --> 01:37:29,952
- I never saw him play. I hear he's great.
- I'm ready.

792
01:37:29,953 --> 01:37:32,163
As soon as I've finished my coffee.

793
01:37:32,164 --> 01:37:35,208
- You have great confidence in me.
- I don't.

794
01:37:35,209 --> 01:37:38,962
- I've confidence in Findley.
- What's that supposed to mean?

795
01:37:38,963 --> 01:37:42,257
It means I'm confident he's a loser.
All the way a loser.

796
01:37:42,258 --> 01:37:46,094
You are only about one half loser,
the other half winner.

797
01:37:46,095 --> 01:37:48,180
- I'm finished.
- I got it.

798
01:37:48,222 --> 01:37:51,937
No. When you play for me,
I pick up all the tabs.

799
01:37:55,271 --> 01:37:59,191
Fats knew the game was in the clutch,
so he had to do something to stop you.

800
01:37:59,192 --> 01:38:03,445
- He played it smart.
- I've played that game in my head, too.

801
01:38:03,446 --> 01:38:05,626
Play it again. Learn something.

802
01:38:08,076 --> 01:38:10,116
Fats went to the john.

803
01:38:10,203 --> 01:38:13,998
He washed his face, cleaned his fingernails,
made his mind a blank...

804
01:38:13,999 --> 01:38:17,684
... combed his hair,
and came back all ready to go.

805
01:38:17,711 --> 01:38:19,122
You were through.

806
01:38:19,713 --> 01:38:24,033
You saw how he looked,
clean, ready to start all over again.

807
01:38:24,718 --> 01:38:26,344
Hold tight and push hard.

808
01:38:26,345 --> 01:38:30,845
Do you know what you were doing?
You were waiting to get beat.

809
01:38:31,642 --> 01:38:36,457
You were flattened out on your butt,
swimming in glory and whiskey...

810
01:38:37,940 --> 01:38:40,191
... probably deciding how you could lose.

811
01:38:40,192 --> 01:38:44,982
What makes you know so much?
How do you know what he was thinking?

812
01:38:45,865 --> 01:38:46,896
I know.

813
01:38:48,493 --> 01:38:50,117
Been there myself.

814
01:38:51,579 --> 01:38:55,044
We've all been there, haven't we,
Miss Packard?

815
01:38:55,667 --> 01:38:57,327
Got a match?

816
01:39:02,257 --> 01:39:04,884
Doesn't your lighter work, Mr. Gordon?

817
01:39:04,885 --> 01:39:06,711
I forgot all about it.

818
01:39:07,804 --> 01:39:10,591
- How is your hand?
- Fine.

819
01:39:10,682 --> 01:39:13,935
Good. I'd hate to put my money
on a cripple.

820
01:39:13,936 --> 01:39:19,416
- Why did you say a thing like that?
- I'm sure Mr. Gordon meant no offense.

821
01:39:19,942 --> 01:39:21,934
It was a figure of speech.

822
01:39:22,778 --> 01:39:26,353
- That's right, Miss Packard.
- A fact is a fact.

823
01:39:28,075 --> 01:39:30,068
She's a smart girl, Eddie.

824
01:39:50,890 --> 01:39:55,375
Right this way, Mr. Gordon.
Here you are, Mr. Gordon, Suite 56.

825
01:39:55,478 --> 01:39:58,396
I wired ahead for two suites adjoining.

826
01:39:58,481 --> 01:40:00,733
- I don't recall.
- I do! I want two suites.

827
01:40:00,734 --> 01:40:03,277
I'm sorry, we're filled up,
this is Derby week.

828
01:40:03,278 --> 01:40:05,446
You're wrong, you must've gotten my wire.

829
01:40:05,447 --> 01:40:08,908
- Look through your reservations.
- I'll see what I can do.

830
01:40:08,909 --> 01:40:14,014
Yes, you're right, Mr. Gordon.
I mislaid your wire. Two adjoining suites?

831
01:40:27,261 --> 01:40:31,681
That's sweet music in there. You can
almost smell the action and the money.

832
01:40:31,682 --> 01:40:34,893
I can feel it right down
in the bottom of my shoes.

833
01:40:34,894 --> 01:40:37,385
- Eddie!
- Billy, how are you?

834
01:40:37,480 --> 01:40:42,442
I didn't know you were here. Everyone's
here. It's like a hustlers' convention!

835
01:40:42,443 --> 01:40:47,633
West Stone Kid, Johnny Jumbo.
Come in, the guys will be glad to see you.

836
01:40:48,158 --> 01:40:50,696
- What room are we in?
- 57.

837
01:40:50,785 --> 01:40:52,363
I'll be up later.

838
01:41:32,662 --> 01:41:34,489
Wait, Miss Packard.

839
01:41:35,164 --> 01:41:37,759
We're neighbors, now. Call me Sarah.

840
01:41:38,585 --> 01:41:40,743
I want to talk to you.

841
01:41:41,463 --> 01:41:42,803
Do we need words?

842
01:41:42,881 --> 01:41:47,134
I think so. We could cut each other up,
but that'd be bad for everybody...

843
01:41:47,135 --> 01:41:50,655
... for me, for you,
and worst of all for Eddie.

844
01:41:51,264 --> 01:41:53,474
You know what's good for him.

845
01:41:53,767 --> 01:41:55,047
To win.

846
01:41:55,602 --> 01:41:57,287
For whom and for what?

847
01:41:58,605 --> 01:42:02,635
What makes the world go around?
For money and for glory.

848
01:42:03,235 --> 01:42:05,705
Answer my first question. For whom?

849
01:42:06,196 --> 01:42:08,448
Today for me, tomorrow for himself.

850
01:42:08,449 --> 01:42:10,644
There is no tomorrow with you.

851
01:42:11,285 --> 01:42:15,590
You own all the tomorrows,
because you buy them today, cheap.

852
01:42:17,708 --> 01:42:19,203
Nobody has to sell.

853
01:42:20,461 --> 01:42:22,736
- You bastard...
- Miss Ladybird!

854
01:42:24,048 --> 01:42:27,843
You are here on a rain check, and I know it.
Hanging on by your nails.

855
01:42:27,844 --> 01:42:30,137
You let that glory whistle blow for Eddie...

856
01:42:30,138 --> 01:42:33,390
... and you're a wreck on the track,
a horse that finished last.

857
01:42:33,391 --> 01:42:37,186
Don't make trouble, Miss Ladybird.
Live and let live!

858
01:42:38,813 --> 01:42:40,058
While you can.

859
01:42:44,569 --> 01:42:46,449
I'll make it up to you.

860
01:42:49,157 --> 01:42:50,189
How?

861
01:42:52,703 --> 01:42:53,865
You tell me.

862
01:43:20,481 --> 01:43:21,513
Thanks.

863
01:43:23,276 --> 01:43:26,153
There are three late scratches
in the following race:

864
01:43:26,154 --> 01:43:29,772
Rosemary, Stroke of Luck, and L&R.

865
01:43:31,409 --> 01:43:34,279
- Where's Bert?
- He went off somewhere.

866
01:43:34,454 --> 01:43:36,539
That old loving horse paid $22. 40!

867
01:43:36,540 --> 01:43:42,545
With the $200 I won from that jockey
last night, and today at the track, I've $540.

868
01:43:42,588 --> 01:43:44,338
- Here, you hold it.
- Why?

869
01:43:44,339 --> 01:43:45,668
Just for luck.

870
01:43:49,595 --> 01:43:51,485
- Findley's here.
- Where?

871
01:43:52,264 --> 01:43:53,972
Over there by the bar.

872
01:44:02,233 --> 01:44:07,148
- Aren't you going to talk to him?
- Sit tight. He'll be over here.

873
01:44:09,615 --> 01:44:12,250
- You ready for another?
- Thank you.

874
01:44:12,368 --> 01:44:13,649
No more for me.

875
01:44:14,954 --> 01:44:18,034
Hello. I haven't seen you in a long time.

876
01:44:18,917 --> 01:44:21,652
I haven't been here for a long time.

877
01:44:23,338 --> 01:44:26,422
Miss Packard, Eddie Felson. James...

878
01:44:26,591 --> 01:44:27,623
Findley.

879
01:44:28,135 --> 01:44:30,386
- Glad to meet you.
- And I, you.

880
01:44:30,387 --> 01:44:35,600
I think I've heard about you, Mr. Felson.
You play pocket billiards, don't you?

881
01:44:35,601 --> 01:44:40,846
- Now and then. Why? Do you?
- A little, but I'm afraid I generally lose.

882
01:44:41,065 --> 01:44:42,642
So does Eddie.

883
01:44:44,860 --> 01:44:49,902
- I win sometimes.
- I bet you do, Mr. Felson. I just bet you do.

884
01:44:50,783 --> 01:44:52,277
How much?

885
01:44:54,495 --> 01:44:55,361
Bert?

886
01:44:55,997 --> 01:44:59,040
I believe Mr. Felson
is making a proposition.

887
01:44:59,041 --> 01:45:00,073
Could be.

888
01:45:00,668 --> 01:45:02,127
Well, Mr. Felson...

889
01:45:02,211 --> 01:45:05,964
... maybe you'd like to come to my place
sometime. We can play billiards.

890
01:45:05,965 --> 01:45:06,879
When?

891
01:45:07,634 --> 01:45:10,919
- You're very direct.
- That's right. When?

892
01:45:11,888 --> 01:45:14,094
- Tonight?
- What time?

893
01:45:15,350 --> 01:45:18,519
I'm having some people for drinks
right after the races.

894
01:45:18,520 --> 01:45:22,398
Why don't you all come?
Then about 10:00 we can play.

895
01:45:22,399 --> 01:45:24,438
- We'll be there.
- Good.

896
01:45:30,782 --> 01:45:33,743
If you don't mind,
I think I will stay at the hotel.

897
01:45:33,744 --> 01:45:35,703
- What's the matter?
- I'm tired.

898
01:45:35,704 --> 01:45:39,290
Come on, it'll be a lot of laughs.
Findley's parties are famous.

899
01:45:39,291 --> 01:45:44,000
He invites everybody from high society
to every tramp in town.

900
01:45:44,505 --> 01:45:46,589
Another way he gets his kicks.

901
01:45:46,590 --> 01:45:51,600
It excites him to be around
the criminal type. Some men are like that.

902
01:45:52,388 --> 01:45:53,633
Some women, too.

903
01:48:13,200 --> 01:48:16,369
- What's the matter?
- It's all right. She drank too much.

904
01:48:16,370 --> 01:48:18,327
Let her sleep it off.

905
01:48:18,414 --> 01:48:20,157
Cut it out!

906
01:48:20,666 --> 01:48:23,206
Do what he says, come on, upstairs.

907
01:49:33,658 --> 01:49:36,143
Do you gentlemen care for a drink?

908
01:49:36,369 --> 01:49:39,489
- None for me. Let's play.
- By all means.

909
01:49:44,878 --> 01:49:47,363
Thought we came here to play pool?

910
01:49:48,089 --> 01:49:50,754
I don't play pool, I play billiards.

911
01:49:52,552 --> 01:49:57,390
It's my house, my game.
You don't have to play if you don't want to.

912
01:49:57,391 --> 01:50:00,111
- We won't.
- Bert, let me play him.

913
01:50:01,478 --> 01:50:05,227
- How much?
- We'll start small. $100 a game?

914
01:50:06,317 --> 01:50:09,462
- Did you ever play billiards before?
- Sure.

915
01:50:09,737 --> 01:50:11,112
You hustling me?

916
01:50:11,864 --> 01:50:16,849
I'm sure he knows what he's doing.
You can afford $100 to find out.

917
01:50:18,496 --> 01:50:19,776
Deal the cards.

918
01:50:44,731 --> 01:50:49,856
Beautiful shot!
You've played billiards before, Mr. Felson.

919
01:50:50,320 --> 01:50:54,295
- Sure you wouldn't care for a drink?
- Nothing for me.

920
01:50:57,786 --> 01:50:59,162
How do we stand?

921
01:50:59,371 --> 01:51:01,497
- About even.
- When do I raise the bet?

922
01:51:01,498 --> 01:51:04,292
- I don't know.
- If that's his best game, I can beat him.

923
01:51:04,293 --> 01:51:06,628
Level with me. Did you ever play billiards?

924
01:51:06,629 --> 01:51:08,046
What's the difference?

925
01:51:08,047 --> 01:51:12,217
There's a cue, balls on the table.
All you got to do is get the feel of it.

926
01:51:12,218 --> 01:51:15,302
- Shall we raise the stakes?
- How much?

927
01:51:15,930 --> 01:51:17,093
$500?

928
01:51:17,557 --> 01:51:19,141
You think you can beat him?

929
01:51:19,142 --> 01:51:22,269
Of course he does.
He wouldn't play me if he didn't.

930
01:51:22,270 --> 01:51:25,898
I didn't ask him, can he beat you,
I already know he can.

931
01:51:25,899 --> 01:51:29,526
I asked him, will he?
That's two different things.

932
01:51:29,527 --> 01:51:30,772
I can beat him.

933
01:51:31,655 --> 01:51:33,197
All right, $500.

934
01:51:35,450 --> 01:51:40,413
Have you noticed, Bert, this fellow here
bears a striking resemblance to you?

935
01:51:40,414 --> 01:51:43,809
It seems you might have modeled
for the artist.

936
01:51:46,295 --> 01:51:47,540
It's possible.

937
01:51:56,555 --> 01:51:58,640
Mark that one up, too, Bert.

938
01:51:59,392 --> 01:52:01,547
I'll beat him the next game.

939
01:52:04,689 --> 01:52:06,183
How are the hands?

940
01:52:07,650 --> 01:52:08,765
Fine.

941
01:52:09,444 --> 01:52:11,570
Rack up your cue, we're leaving.

942
01:52:11,571 --> 01:52:15,699
- That's a shame. The night is young.
- The night is $2,000 old.

943
01:52:15,700 --> 01:52:18,750
- Hey, Bert, wait.
- I said we're leaving.

944
01:52:31,675 --> 01:52:33,305
I can beat him, Bert.

945
01:52:33,468 --> 01:52:38,347
He suckered me, I didn't think he knew
how to hustle. I can outplay and beat him!

946
01:52:38,348 --> 01:52:42,573
I don't believe you, Eddie.
I think you're still a loser.

947
01:52:44,688 --> 01:52:47,179
I'll play him on my own money!

948
01:52:49,318 --> 01:52:50,563
Be right back.

949
01:53:21,351 --> 01:53:23,326
Okay, come on, let's play.

950
01:53:28,525 --> 01:53:29,640
I'm broke.

951
01:53:29,860 --> 01:53:33,860
- That's unfortunate, Mr. Felson.
- For whom, Mr. Findley?

952
01:53:34,490 --> 01:53:36,324
Bert, he only beat me by a point.

953
01:53:36,325 --> 01:53:39,285
- The bank is closed.
- Don't get off me, please!

954
01:53:39,286 --> 01:53:42,455
I know when to quit. You don't.
Win or lose, you don't know!

955
01:53:42,456 --> 01:53:44,541
What do you want me to do? Say it...

956
01:53:44,542 --> 01:53:47,001
... and you've got it,
but don't get off me now.

957
01:53:47,002 --> 01:53:48,283
Don't beg him.

958
01:53:51,048 --> 01:53:53,884
- Go back to the hotel.
- Please, Eddie, don't beg him.

959
01:53:53,885 --> 01:53:57,088
Go back to the hotel. Take a cab, go back!

960
01:53:59,307 --> 01:54:04,387
Doesn't all this come through to you?
Doesn't it mean anything to you?

961
01:54:04,729 --> 01:54:07,089
That man, this place, the people.

962
01:54:07,357 --> 01:54:12,102
They wear masks, and under them
they're perverted, twisted, crippled!

963
01:54:12,153 --> 01:54:15,923
- Shut up.
- Don't wear a mask. You don't have to.

964
01:54:16,158 --> 01:54:18,698
That's Turk, who broke your thumbs!

965
01:54:18,869 --> 01:54:22,622
He won't break your thumbs,
he'll break your heart, your guts...

966
01:54:22,623 --> 01:54:27,398
... and for the same reason,
because he hates you for what you are.

967
01:54:27,503 --> 01:54:31,339
- For what you have and he hasn't.
- Get off my back, once and for all!

968
01:54:31,340 --> 01:54:33,315
Would you get off my back?

969
01:54:40,057 --> 01:54:41,386
Play him, Eddie.

970
01:54:43,311 --> 01:54:45,411
Play him for $1,000 a game.

971
01:55:21,100 --> 01:55:22,926
Will you take a check?

972
01:55:27,690 --> 01:55:29,184
Cash.

973
01:55:32,319 --> 01:55:34,111
How much do I owe you?

974
01:55:34,613 --> 01:55:36,273
$12,000.

975
01:56:00,599 --> 01:56:01,761
Here.

976
01:56:04,728 --> 01:56:07,088
It's been an interesting evening.

977
01:56:11,318 --> 01:56:12,598
It sure has.

978
01:56:12,820 --> 01:56:16,200
Charles, call a cab for these gentlemen,
please.

979
01:56:17,074 --> 01:56:21,119
- I'd show you to the door, but...
- Yes, you're tired.

980
01:56:22,413 --> 01:56:24,204
And beat.

981
01:56:26,333 --> 01:56:27,365
Yeah.

982
01:56:30,963 --> 01:56:32,541
You must come again.

983
01:56:35,176 --> 01:56:36,339
Yeah, sure.

984
01:56:48,690 --> 01:56:50,665
Here's your share: $3,000.

985
01:56:51,943 --> 01:56:54,897
- The cab is waiting.
- Thanks.

986
01:56:57,240 --> 01:56:59,960
- Eddie, let's go.
- I want to walk.

987
01:57:01,495 --> 01:57:02,905
It's a long walk.

988
01:57:03,038 --> 01:57:04,580
I got time, Bert.

989
01:57:05,332 --> 01:57:07,777
You want me to tell her for you?

990
01:57:08,127 --> 01:57:09,537
Tell her what?

991
01:57:10,504 --> 01:57:12,479
You got to be hard, Eddie.

992
01:58:34,048 --> 01:58:35,424
When are you leaving?

993
01:58:35,425 --> 01:58:39,085
In a little while.
It's what you want, isn't it?

994
01:58:40,555 --> 01:58:42,240
It's what Eddie wants.

995
01:58:43,225 --> 01:58:46,428
He told me to give you some money.

996
01:58:50,274 --> 01:58:54,474
Put it on the bed.
That's the way it's done, isn't it?

997
01:58:55,320 --> 01:58:57,310
That's the way it's done.

998
01:58:58,615 --> 01:59:00,450
The way you're looking at me...

999
01:59:00,451 --> 01:59:04,386
... is that how you look
at a man you've just beaten?

1000
01:59:04,747 --> 01:59:09,788
As if you've just taken his money
and now you want his pride?

1001
01:59:11,671 --> 01:59:13,536
All I want is the money.

1002
01:59:15,133 --> 01:59:20,058
Sure, the money and the aristocratic
pleasure of seeing him fall apart.

1003
01:59:21,097 --> 01:59:24,680
You're a Roman, Bert.
You have to win them all.

1004
02:00:09,397 --> 02:00:10,856
You got a drink?

1005
02:00:59,991 --> 02:01:02,366
Give me my key, please. Room 57.

1006
02:01:05,872 --> 02:01:07,737
Come on, give me my key.

1007
02:01:32,858 --> 02:01:36,569
Now, let's go over this again.
You say you were in the other room...

1008
02:01:36,570 --> 02:01:39,864
She closed the door, I told you,
she closed the door.

1009
02:01:39,865 --> 02:01:44,585
She closed the door, went in there,
maybe ten, five minutes or so.

1010
02:01:47,456 --> 02:01:49,366
Hey, let him come in.

1011
02:01:54,881 --> 02:01:56,291
Eddie...

1012
02:02:24,494 --> 02:02:25,526
Eddie?

1013
02:02:29,500 --> 02:02:30,531
Eddie?

1014
02:02:37,383 --> 02:02:39,257
She came in here, Eddie.

1015
02:02:40,386 --> 02:02:42,306
She asked me for a drink.

1016
02:02:42,805 --> 02:02:44,133
I gave her one.

1017
02:02:45,891 --> 02:02:47,718
We had a few more.

1018
02:02:50,480 --> 02:02:52,275
Eddie, she came in here!

1019
02:04:20,553 --> 02:04:22,528
I came to play pool, Fats.

1020
02:04:29,270 --> 02:04:32,445
- That's good. For how much?
- You name it.

1021
02:04:34,484 --> 02:04:35,682
$1,000 a game?

1022
02:04:35,902 --> 02:04:38,527
Let's make it $3,000 a game, Fats.

1023
02:04:40,573 --> 02:04:43,748
$3,000, that's my bankroll, my life savings.

1024
02:04:46,788 --> 02:04:48,247
What's the matter, Fats?

1025
02:04:48,248 --> 02:04:52,598
Beat me the first game,
and I'm on my way back to Oakland.

1026
02:04:55,881 --> 02:04:57,126
Let's go.

1027
02:05:05,432 --> 02:05:07,767
Get on me, Bert, I can't lose!

1028
02:05:11,313 --> 02:05:12,345
Willie?

1029
02:05:21,991 --> 02:05:23,616
- Call it.
- Heads.

1030
02:06:12,416 --> 02:06:14,846
How should I play that one, Bert?

1031
02:06:15,210 --> 02:06:16,539
Play it safe?

1032
02:06:17,171 --> 02:06:21,633
That's what you always told me,
play it safe, play the percentage.

1033
02:06:21,634 --> 02:06:24,010
Well, here we go, fast and loose.

1034
02:06:24,011 --> 02:06:25,803
One ball, corner pocket.

1035
02:06:26,973 --> 02:06:30,643
Percentage players die broke, too,
don't they, Bert?

1036
02:06:40,278 --> 02:06:41,737
How can I lose?

1037
02:06:43,531 --> 02:06:44,812
Twelve ball.

1038
02:06:51,704 --> 02:06:55,165
I mean, how can I lose?
Because you were right, Bert.

1039
02:06:55,166 --> 02:06:59,837
It's not enough to have talent,
you've got to have character, too.

1040
02:06:59,838 --> 02:07:01,083
Four ball.

1041
02:07:09,848 --> 02:07:12,137
And I sure got character now.

1042
02:07:12,893 --> 02:07:16,193
I picked it up in a hotel room in Louisville.

1043
02:07:19,191 --> 02:07:20,934
Shoot pool, Fast Eddie.

1044
02:07:22,653 --> 02:07:26,463
I'm shooting pool, Fats.
When I miss, you can shoot.

1045
02:07:30,870 --> 02:07:32,412
Five ball.

1046
02:07:37,502 --> 02:07:39,044
Fourteen ball.

1047
02:07:44,589 --> 02:07:46,131
Four ball.

1048
02:07:50,971 --> 02:07:51,966
That's game.

1049
02:08:04,401 --> 02:08:05,564
Game!

1050
02:08:18,624 --> 02:08:19,953
Eight ball.

1051
02:08:36,768 --> 02:08:38,096
Thirteen ball.

1052
02:08:55,621 --> 02:08:57,281
I quit, Eddie.

1053
02:08:58,457 --> 02:09:00,117
I can't beat you.

1054
02:09:02,169 --> 02:09:04,411
Willie, give him the stake.

1055
02:09:07,800 --> 02:09:10,050
You got yourself a pool player.

1056
02:09:10,052 --> 02:09:11,957
Preacher, give me my coat.

1057
02:09:15,933 --> 02:09:18,308
Where do you think you're going?

1058
02:09:21,147 --> 02:09:22,178
Eddie?

1059
02:09:25,109 --> 02:09:26,936
You owe me money!

1060
02:09:31,574 --> 02:09:34,059
Just how do you figure that, Bert?

1061
02:09:37,747 --> 02:09:40,632
- What do you figure I owe you?
- Half!

1062
02:09:41,043 --> 02:09:44,438
- In Louisville, it was 75%.
- Here, it's half.

1063
02:09:52,805 --> 02:09:54,740
What if I don't pay you?

1064
02:09:58,310 --> 02:09:59,805
You don't pay me?

1065
02:10:02,106 --> 02:10:04,701
You'll get your thumbs broken again.

1066
02:10:07,528 --> 02:10:09,022
And your fingers.

1067
02:10:11,991 --> 02:10:17,204
If I want them to, they'll break
your right arm in three or four places.

1068
02:10:17,205 --> 02:10:19,110
You better pay him, Eddie.

1069
02:10:33,889 --> 02:10:36,429
You figure you're still my manager?

1070
02:10:36,516 --> 02:10:38,256
I'm a businessman, kid.

1071
02:10:38,810 --> 02:10:41,020
You've got a lot of games lined up for me?

1072
02:10:41,021 --> 02:10:43,397
We'll make lots of money together,
from now on.

1073
02:10:43,398 --> 02:10:44,893
50%?

1074
02:10:46,026 --> 02:10:49,466
It don't have to be 50%.
It can be 30%, 25%.

1075
02:10:56,953 --> 02:11:00,198
We really stuck the knife in her, didn't we?

1076
02:11:01,166 --> 02:11:03,417
We really gave it to her good.

1077
02:11:03,418 --> 02:11:07,088
If it didn't happen in Louisville,
it would happen someplace else.

1078
02:11:07,089 --> 02:11:10,758
If not now, six months from now.
That's the kind of dame she was.

1079
02:11:10,759 --> 02:11:13,424
Then we twisted it, didn't we, Bert?

1080
02:11:14,429 --> 02:11:19,894
It doesn't stick in your throat because
you spit it out like everything else!

1081
02:11:22,646 --> 02:11:24,331
But it sticks in mine.

1082
02:11:26,859 --> 02:11:28,353
I loved her.

1083
02:11:30,946 --> 02:11:33,336
I traded her in on a pool game.

1084
02:11:35,284 --> 02:11:39,894
That wouldn't mean anything to you.
Who did you ever care about?

1085
02:11:40,373 --> 02:11:43,878
"Just win, "you said.
That's the important thing.

1086
02:11:44,294 --> 02:11:47,829
You don't know what winning is.
You're a loser!

1087
02:11:47,881 --> 02:11:51,050
Because you're dead inside,
and you can't live...

1088
02:11:51,051 --> 02:11:54,651
... unless you make everything else
dead around you.

1089
02:11:55,180 --> 02:11:56,508
Too high, Bert.

1090
02:11:57,807 --> 02:11:59,717
Your price is too high.

1091
02:12:01,436 --> 02:12:05,434
If I take it, she never lived. She never died.

1092
02:12:09,361 --> 02:12:13,821
We both know that's not true, don't we?
She lived. She died.

1093
02:12:18,787 --> 02:12:20,412
You better...

1094
02:12:21,332 --> 02:12:26,252
You tell your boys they better kill me.
They better go all the way with me...

1095
02:12:26,253 --> 02:12:31,083
... because if they just bust me up,
I'll put the pieces together...

1096
02:12:31,843 --> 02:12:33,803
... so help me God, Bert...

1097
02:12:34,554 --> 02:12:37,344
... I'll come back and I'll kill you.

1098
02:12:38,474 --> 02:12:39,673
Wait a minute.

1099
02:12:47,442 --> 02:12:48,687
All right.

1100
02:13:06,045 --> 02:13:07,669
Only...

1101
02:13:12,259 --> 02:13:16,069
... don't ever walk
into a big-time pool hall again.

1102
02:13:26,232 --> 02:13:27,347
Fat Man...

1103
02:13:28,276 --> 02:13:30,816
... you shoot a great game of pool.

1104
02:13:31,237 --> 02:13:32,945
So do you, Fast Eddie.

1105
02:14:33,031 --> 02:14:36,649
