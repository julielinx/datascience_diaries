1
00:00:00,791 --> 00:00:02,299
Previously on "Pan Am".

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,900
We'd like to move you up.
From courier to agent.

3
00:00:05,148 --> 00:00:06,068
I'm George Broyles.

4
00:00:06,085 --> 00:00:07,185
Who is that?

5
00:00:07,223 --> 00:00:08,543
Oh, that's a sky God.

6
00:00:08,313 --> 00:00:10,497
- What are you doing with all this?
- Diplomatic relations.

7
00:00:10,532 --> 00:00:11,932
And you brought this
all on our flight?

8
00:00:11,966 --> 00:00:13,851
I don't wanna lie to you.

9
00:00:13,902 --> 00:00:16,170
Then don't.

10
00:00:16,204 --> 00:00:19,172
I wanna feel how liberating
anonymous can be.

11
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:21,041
This is
about self-expression.

12
00:00:22,811 --> 00:00:24,611
- Will you marry me?
- Yes.

13
00:00:24,646 --> 00:00:27,281
I wish I could be more
like you.

14
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:42,996
Oh!

15
00:00:43,031 --> 00:00:44,898
I'm so sorry.
My mistake.

16
00:00:44,932 --> 00:00:47,785
It certainly was.

17
00:00:47,836 --> 00:00:50,370
Okay, let's try it again
from the beginning.

18
00:00:51,506 --> 00:00:53,774
I'll get it.

19
00:00:53,808 --> 00:00:55,492
But you still haven't told me
why I'm doing this, Richard.

20
00:00:55,527 --> 00:00:58,462
- What is my mission?
- First things first.

21
00:00:58,513 --> 00:00:59,596
The key to pickpocketing
for a woman

22
00:00:59,631 --> 00:01:00,814
is not to do it like a man.

23
00:01:00,849 --> 00:01:03,350
For a woman,
it's all about distraction...

24
00:01:03,385 --> 00:01:07,104
Touch, kiss, the foreplay
before the lift.

25
00:01:07,138 --> 00:01:10,023
Make men fantasize
so their minds are elsewhere.

26
00:01:10,058 --> 00:01:12,025
In other words,
seduce them.

27
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,928
In other words...

28
00:01:14,963 --> 00:01:17,798
Put a little Pan Am
into it?

29
00:01:17,832 --> 00:01:19,733
You surprise me more
every day.

30
00:01:19,768 --> 00:01:21,185
Mm.

31
00:01:21,236 --> 00:01:23,220
But you still need
more practice.

32
00:01:23,254 --> 00:01:27,241
I'll get the practice in.
What's my mission?

33
00:01:27,275 --> 00:01:29,526
You leave for Rome
tomorrow.

34
00:01:29,577 --> 00:01:31,245
We've arranged entry
for your Pan Am crew

35
00:01:31,279 --> 00:01:33,280
to a party following
an international conference

36
00:01:33,298 --> 00:01:35,099
on the space race.

37
00:01:35,133 --> 00:01:36,850
Kennedy's goal
to reach the moon first

38
00:01:36,885 --> 00:01:39,603
has everyone scrambling.

39
00:01:39,654 --> 00:01:41,321
Alessandro D'Arco.

40
00:01:41,355 --> 00:01:44,925
Used to work S. I.O.S...
Italian intelligence.

41
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:46,894
Now he's a freelance courier.

42
00:01:46,928 --> 00:01:48,946
He'll be carrying
a microfilm case.

43
00:01:48,997 --> 00:01:52,733
Inside are stolen
American rocket plans.

44
00:01:52,767 --> 00:01:55,903
And I have to pick them
out of his pocket?

45
00:01:55,937 --> 00:01:56,904
Before he's able to pass them
on to the Soviets

46
00:01:56,938 --> 00:01:58,222
that same night.

47
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,074
You won't be alone.

48
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:02,693
There'll be s.I.O.S. Agents
at the party.

49
00:02:02,744 --> 00:02:03,627
As backup?

50
00:02:03,661 --> 00:02:05,095
More like observers.

51
00:02:05,146 --> 00:02:06,363
The Italians
have granted us access,

52
00:02:06,431 --> 00:02:08,882
but that's as far
as they're willing to go.

53
00:02:08,917 --> 00:02:10,951
And what if I fail?

54
00:02:10,985 --> 00:02:12,152
At least you'll have
a new career as a thief

55
00:02:12,187 --> 00:02:14,521
to fall back on.

56
00:02:14,556 --> 00:02:18,459
All right,
let's try it again.

57
00:02:29,971 --> 00:02:32,072
Amanda.

58
00:02:32,106 --> 00:02:34,908
Maggie.
Do you have a minute?

59
00:02:34,943 --> 00:02:38,011
I was actually in the middle
of something, but...

60
00:02:38,046 --> 00:02:42,566
Oh. The Kennedy campaign.

61
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,785
- Did you work on it?
- I was a volunteer,

62
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:47,404
went from city to city,
house to house.

63
00:02:47,455 --> 00:02:50,557
Changing the world
one doorbell at a time.

64
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,394
Look, Amanda, I...

65
00:02:54,429 --> 00:02:57,431
No, Maggie, please.

66
00:02:57,465 --> 00:02:58,966
Let me explain.

67
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,269
What happened
the other night...

68
00:03:02,303 --> 00:03:06,340
I just... got caught up
in all the evening's emotions,

69
00:03:06,374 --> 00:03:10,777
what with Teddy proposing
and all the celebration.

70
00:03:10,812 --> 00:03:12,813
It just happened, okay?

71
00:03:12,847 --> 00:03:15,048
Honestly,
it's no big deal.

72
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:16,517
I didn't know, so...

73
00:03:16,551 --> 00:03:18,318
It's not even the first time
that's happened to me.

74
00:03:18,353 --> 00:03:21,755
I must be sending out some kind
of signal or something.

75
00:03:21,789 --> 00:03:22,990
A girl signal.

76
00:03:23,024 --> 00:03:24,291
Must be it.

77
00:03:24,325 --> 00:03:25,592
Who knew?

78
00:03:25,627 --> 00:03:28,195
Look...

79
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:32,299
I just wanna make sure,
you know, Teddy doesn't...

80
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:36,970
Oh, no, no.
Your secret is safe with me.

81
00:03:37,005 --> 00:03:38,471
Thank you, Maggie.

82
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:40,807
You're a true friend.

83
00:03:53,605 --> 00:03:56,089
Look all you want,
you won't find it.

84
00:03:56,124 --> 00:03:58,792
My name. I'm sitting
the next flight out.

85
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:00,794
Turns out you can't just
<i>have</i> a wedding.

86
00:04:00,828 --> 00:04:03,163
You gotta spend months
planning the damn thing.

87
00:04:03,197 --> 00:04:05,432
Yeah, well, at least
you two are still talking.

88
00:04:05,466 --> 00:04:08,435
More than I can say.

89
00:04:08,469 --> 00:04:10,904
Oh, Colette.

90
00:04:10,939 --> 00:04:12,823
Won't return my calls.
Won't even speak to me.

91
00:04:12,857 --> 00:04:16,293
Ouch. Bridget thing?

92
00:04:16,327 --> 00:04:17,878
She says I'm in love
with two women.

93
00:04:17,912 --> 00:04:19,546
I don't even think
that's possible.

94
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:20,981
Well, technically
it's possible to love three,

95
00:04:21,015 --> 00:04:22,649
but... although I'm not gonna
go into specifics.

96
00:04:22,684 --> 00:04:24,484
- The point is, it's the...
- The sex.

97
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:26,820
It ruins everything.
I mean, don't get me wrong.

98
00:04:26,854 --> 00:04:28,905
It makes certain relationships
more fun,

99
00:04:28,957 --> 00:04:31,458
but the "fun" ones are not
the ones you wanna marry.

100
00:04:31,492 --> 00:04:32,926
By the way,
so you're telling me

101
00:04:32,961 --> 00:04:34,444
that you and Amanda, you
haven't... we haven't.

102
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,363
- Oh, come on.
- We <i>haven't.</i>

103
00:04:36,397 --> 00:04:39,900
And I'm glad. It's made me
take things more seriously.

104
00:04:39,934 --> 00:04:43,453
Painfully,
painfully seriously.

105
00:04:43,504 --> 00:04:44,721
Look, if it's real,
you know it,

106
00:04:44,756 --> 00:04:46,340
so just figure out a way
to prove that to Colette

107
00:04:46,374 --> 00:04:49,593
and never, ever give up.

108
00:04:49,644 --> 00:04:50,627
See, now that's the only
rational thing

109
00:04:50,662 --> 00:04:52,245
- you've said all day.
- Good.

110
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:53,947
Then I've met my quota.

111
00:05:12,033 --> 00:05:14,201
Hey, do I know you?

112
00:05:14,235 --> 00:05:16,303
I don't think so.

113
00:05:16,337 --> 00:05:18,138
Sorry.

114
00:05:18,172 --> 00:05:19,806
I know I've seen you
somewhere.

115
00:05:21,576 --> 00:05:23,677
The photos, right?

116
00:05:23,711 --> 00:05:25,345
Oh, right, yes.

117
00:05:25,363 --> 00:05:27,414
You and everyone else,
unfortunately.

118
00:05:27,448 --> 00:05:29,249
That's some
ground-breaking stuff.

119
00:05:29,283 --> 00:05:31,652
It's really bold, electric.

120
00:05:31,686 --> 00:05:33,804
You're very far ahead
of your time.

121
00:05:33,855 --> 00:05:37,090
All that from a magazine cover?
Thank you.

122
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:38,859
Magazine?

123
00:05:38,893 --> 00:05:42,095
"Life" magazine. I'm the Pan Am
stewardess on the cover.

124
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:44,898
I don't think "life" would
ever publish those photos.

125
00:05:44,932 --> 00:05:47,668
Wait. What... what photos
are you talking about?

126
00:05:47,702 --> 00:05:49,102
The nudes.

127
00:05:52,073 --> 00:05:55,976
Where did... where...
Where did you see them?

128
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:57,911
Gallery in the village.

129
00:05:57,945 --> 00:05:59,146
Uh, van something.

130
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,664
I need to know the name.

131
00:06:00,698 --> 00:06:01,948
Van Amberg gallery, I think.

132
00:06:01,982 --> 00:06:03,617
Excuse me.

133
00:06:07,739 --> 00:06:09,122
Hey, Maggie.

134
00:06:09,157 --> 00:06:11,208
I've been meaning to ask you
if you liked Amanda.

135
00:06:11,259 --> 00:06:13,260
I did, and I think
she liked me.

136
00:06:13,294 --> 00:06:15,178
Oh, I figured you two
would hit it off.

137
00:06:15,213 --> 00:06:16,897
She's been bringing up
your name a lot.

138
00:06:16,931 --> 00:06:18,565
- Oh. Has she now?
- Uh-huh.

139
00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:20,317
You know, you two
should get together,

140
00:06:20,351 --> 00:06:22,869
once we get through
all this wedding stuff.

141
00:06:22,904 --> 00:06:24,037
Oh, I don't know, Ted.

142
00:06:24,072 --> 00:06:26,707
The first few months
of married life,

143
00:06:26,741 --> 00:06:29,376
the lovebirds should really
feather the nest alone.

144
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:30,844
Don't you think?

145
00:06:30,878 --> 00:06:32,813
We're feathering the nest.
We're not building the Cage.

146
00:06:32,847 --> 00:06:34,448
Yeah.

147
00:06:34,482 --> 00:06:36,299
What's going on with you?
Nothing.

148
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:38,468
I just think the two of you
should...

149
00:06:38,503 --> 00:06:42,789
Really, <i>really</i>
get to know each other.

150
00:06:42,824 --> 00:06:46,393
Wait. Maggie...

151
00:06:46,427 --> 00:06:47,694
Are you jealous?

152
00:06:47,729 --> 00:06:48,829
What?! No.

153
00:06:48,863 --> 00:06:51,064
I mean, I get it.
You're at the age

154
00:06:51,099 --> 00:06:52,766
where you probably wanna
feather your own nest,

155
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,984
and hearing about us...

156
00:06:54,018 --> 00:06:56,169
Ted, stop talking.

157
00:06:56,204 --> 00:07:00,741
I just don't want you
to make a mistake.

158
00:07:00,775 --> 00:07:02,642
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

159
00:07:05,513 --> 00:07:09,816
At the fund-raiser, uh,
Amanda and I were alone,

160
00:07:09,851 --> 00:07:13,220
and... well, she was trying
to make me feel better,

161
00:07:13,254 --> 00:07:17,257
and, uh...
She might have kissed me.

162
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:19,125
And...
Wait. What?

163
00:07:19,143 --> 00:07:20,327
It wasn't a big deal,

164
00:07:20,361 --> 00:07:23,363
but I thought
maybe you should know.

165
00:07:23,397 --> 00:07:25,999
You're joking, right?

166
00:07:26,033 --> 00:07:28,769
I mean, this is ridiculous.

167
00:07:28,803 --> 00:07:31,071
This is the woman
I'm about to marry,

168
00:07:31,105 --> 00:07:32,330
and you're trying to...
what are you trying to do?

169
00:07:32,331 --> 00:07:33,507
No, no, I'm not trying to do anything.
I just...

170
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:35,442
Just because I can see
my future

171
00:07:35,476 --> 00:07:36,910
and you've never been able to
get a grip on your own

172
00:07:36,944 --> 00:07:38,545
- doesn't mean you can start a rumor.
- You... you know what?

173
00:07:38,613 --> 00:07:41,681
You're right. I'm joking.

174
00:07:41,716 --> 00:07:43,283
It never happened.

175
00:07:43,317 --> 00:07:50,023
And I hope you have
a long and happy married life.

176
00:07:50,057 --> 00:07:53,059
And we will <i>never</i>

179
00:08:13,691 --> 00:08:15,292
What are you doing
in my cubby?

180
00:08:15,442 --> 00:08:17,144
Learning more
about my favorite stewardess.

181
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,417
Why do they call 'em
"cubbies" anyway?

182
00:08:19,435 --> 00:08:21,353
Makes you seem like
a bunch of kindergartners.

183
00:08:21,387 --> 00:08:23,855
Funny. I thought
<i>you</i> were the kindergartner.

184
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:25,357
All right, all right,
cool your jets.

185
00:08:25,391 --> 00:08:27,993
Let me make it up to you.
Lunch?

186
00:08:28,027 --> 00:08:29,111
Nice try,

187
00:08:29,145 --> 00:08:31,196
but last I checked,
I'm on a flight to Rome,

188
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:32,364
and you are not.

189
00:08:32,398 --> 00:08:33,532
Check again.

190
00:08:33,566 --> 00:08:36,134
I know this little place
on the Via di Monte.

191
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:39,104
It's Jack Kennedy's
favorite restaurant in Rome.

192
00:08:39,122 --> 00:08:42,474
I'm really not interested
in dating you.

193
00:08:42,508 --> 00:08:44,176
I'm not interested
in dating you either.

194
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:45,460
Then why?

195
00:08:46,395 --> 00:08:49,932
Come to lunch and find out.

196
00:08:52,752 --> 00:08:55,053
Ooh! Ooh. I'm so sorry.

197
00:08:55,088 --> 00:08:58,657
That man is infuriating.

198
00:08:58,691 --> 00:09:00,325
Did you do something
to your hair?

199
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,462
What?

200
00:09:03,496 --> 00:09:05,130
I like it.

201
00:09:05,164 --> 00:09:07,315
It's so soft.

202
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:09,401
It's the signal.

203
00:09:09,435 --> 00:09:13,605
I'm giving off the...
The girl signal?

204
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:14,823
Hmm?

205
00:09:16,175 --> 00:09:18,010
Oh. Look at that.

206
00:09:18,044 --> 00:09:20,495
Your wallet.

207
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:22,330
Is it my posture?

208
00:09:33,659 --> 00:09:34,760
So...

209
00:09:34,794 --> 00:09:39,181
Do you have any, uh, plans
when we get to Rome?

210
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,551
'Cause I was hoping
for a public flogging

211
00:09:42,602 --> 00:09:44,669
in the Colosseum.

212
00:09:46,672 --> 00:09:49,174
Colette, we're never gonna
talk about this

213
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:50,559
if you just keep avoiding me.

214
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:51,693
We can't talk about this

215
00:09:51,728 --> 00:09:53,178
because there is nothing
left to say.

216
00:09:53,196 --> 00:09:54,679
Actually,
I have plenty to say.

217
00:09:54,714 --> 00:09:55,731
I know.

218
00:09:55,782 --> 00:09:57,482
I know you still care
about me.

219
00:09:57,516 --> 00:09:59,237
I know you wish you
could change the past.

220
00:09:59,238 --> 00:10:00,318
Okay, but you... you're...

221
00:10:00,353 --> 00:10:02,287
You're forgetting
the most important part.

222
00:10:02,321 --> 00:10:04,856
It's the part where I tell you
that I have...

223
00:10:04,891 --> 00:10:07,859
I've fallen in love with you
and I will do whatever it takes

224
00:10:07,894 --> 00:10:09,327
to prove that to you.

225
00:10:09,362 --> 00:10:12,047
But you can't.
Dean, I need to move on.

226
00:10:12,081 --> 00:10:14,750
Just give me a chance.

227
00:10:14,801 --> 00:10:18,937
I put in for a transfer
to the Hong Kong base.

228
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:23,992
Hold on. We have a last-minute
passenger addition.

229
00:10:24,026 --> 00:10:27,045
They found him wandering
around the cargo area.

230
00:10:29,465 --> 00:10:32,701
I'm afraid I made a wrong turn.

231
00:10:32,752 --> 00:10:36,321
Luckily, they found me, or I
would be riding on the wing.

232
00:10:36,339 --> 00:10:37,823
Well, we stopped boarding
ten minutes ago,

233
00:10:37,857 --> 00:10:39,424
so you almost
missed your flight.

234
00:10:39,459 --> 00:10:41,660
Must be my lucky day.

235
00:10:41,694 --> 00:10:44,529
Did they manage to check
your luggage, mister...

236
00:10:44,564 --> 00:10:47,232
No luggage.
Friends call me Omar.

237
00:10:47,266 --> 00:10:48,633
Omar it is, then.

238
00:10:48,668 --> 00:10:53,388
How about we find a seat
for, uh, Omar, shall we?

239
00:11:02,414 --> 00:11:04,049
When registering
for housewares,

240
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:07,185
sometimes it's better to bring
gimbels to your actual house.

241
00:11:07,219 --> 00:11:08,703
Mm.

242
00:11:10,673 --> 00:11:13,325
What do you think, Teddy?

243
00:11:13,359 --> 00:11:15,293
Ivory lace or Dover fog?

244
00:11:15,328 --> 00:11:17,445
Mm, the white one.

245
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,663
Neither of them is white.

246
00:11:18,698 --> 00:11:20,832
They look the same to me.

247
00:11:20,867 --> 00:11:24,069
Indulge me, Teddy.
I am a woman of eclectic tastes.

248
00:11:24,103 --> 00:11:27,305
Eclectic tastes.

249
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:29,941
Yeah, I've been wondering
about something.

250
00:11:29,976 --> 00:11:33,378
We're gonna spend
a long life together, right?

251
00:11:33,412 --> 00:11:36,498
You forgot "rewarding."
A long, rewarding life?

252
00:11:36,532 --> 00:11:37,516
Oh, right.

253
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:38,550
Which glass?

254
00:11:38,584 --> 00:11:40,068
Uh, whichever one
holds more booze.

255
00:11:40,102 --> 00:11:44,322
Uh, but for a life
to be rewarding, um...

256
00:11:44,357 --> 00:11:46,942
It needs to be built
on honesty, don't you think?

257
00:11:46,993 --> 00:11:49,661
Hold that thought.

258
00:11:49,695 --> 00:11:51,229
Okay.

259
00:11:56,068 --> 00:11:58,203
Now...

260
00:11:58,237 --> 00:12:00,471
What were you
gonna ask me?

261
00:12:00,523 --> 00:12:03,458
Nothing.

262
00:12:06,345 --> 00:12:09,014
Is everything okay?

263
00:12:09,048 --> 00:12:11,316
I've often wondered
where these come from.

264
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:13,818
Perhaps a tiny bartender.

265
00:12:13,852 --> 00:12:16,087
But you only get
a tiny hangover.

266
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:19,074
Have you been to Rome?

267
00:12:19,108 --> 00:12:20,458
Yes, but, uh,

268
00:12:20,493 --> 00:12:23,195
I have to confess I haven't
done much sightseeing.

269
00:12:23,229 --> 00:12:25,547
Only from the backseat
of a car.

270
00:12:25,581 --> 00:12:27,432
Well, then you haven't
really seen anything.

271
00:12:27,466 --> 00:12:30,869
You have to stroll down
the Spanish steps,

272
00:12:30,903 --> 00:12:33,038
visit Trevi fountain
at sunset.

273
00:12:33,072 --> 00:12:34,406
- Sounds lovely.
- Mm-hmm.

274
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,209
And better if you have
someone to share it with.

275
00:12:37,243 --> 00:12:39,995
But you are traveling alone,
no?

276
00:12:40,046 --> 00:12:42,814
No companions. No luggage.

277
00:12:42,848 --> 00:12:46,284
Awoke this morning
and booked a flight to Rome.

278
00:12:46,302 --> 00:12:47,786
Sometimes we need
a change in pace

279
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,889
to see life
as it really is.

280
00:12:50,923 --> 00:12:53,992
I couldn't agree more,
Omar.

281
00:12:54,026 --> 00:12:57,762
You know my name,
but I don't know yours.

282
00:13:00,132 --> 00:13:01,566
My name is Colette.

283
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,668
Pleased to make
your acquaintance, Colette.

284
00:13:03,702 --> 00:13:08,156
The pleasure is all mine,
Omar.

285
00:13:40,623 --> 00:13:42,207
Oh, no.

286
00:13:42,241 --> 00:13:44,259
Hey, hey,
what are you doing?

287
00:13:44,293 --> 00:13:45,360
I want them down.

288
00:13:45,411 --> 00:13:46,611
Oh, you're her...
The model.

289
00:13:46,645 --> 00:13:48,646
These photos need to come down
right now.

290
00:13:48,664 --> 00:13:52,350
Stop. I can't.
I have a contract.

291
00:13:52,385 --> 00:13:53,685
Look, I don't...
I don't understand.

292
00:13:53,719 --> 00:13:55,220
Okay? You must have willingly
posed for Graham.

293
00:13:55,254 --> 00:13:57,372
He never said
he would sell them.

294
00:13:57,406 --> 00:13:58,757
They're supposed to be private,

295
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:03,161
not on display
for the world to see.

296
00:14:03,195 --> 00:14:05,830
He sold them to me
along with the negatives.

297
00:14:05,865 --> 00:14:08,500
I had no idea.

298
00:14:08,534 --> 00:14:10,135
All I knew was this was
the most beautiful model

299
00:14:10,169 --> 00:14:11,469
I'd ever seen.

300
00:14:11,504 --> 00:14:15,307
I am through
being that person...

301
00:14:15,341 --> 00:14:17,909
Just a woman on the cover
of a magazine,

302
00:14:17,943 --> 00:14:20,211
being judged
by how she looks.

303
00:14:20,246 --> 00:14:23,348
I don't judge a photograph...
A good one, anyway...

304
00:14:23,382 --> 00:14:24,766
On how the model looks.

305
00:14:24,817 --> 00:14:28,920
It's, you know, it's how
the picture makes you feel.

306
00:14:28,954 --> 00:14:31,022
I only know how
they make <i>me</i> feel,

307
00:14:31,057 --> 00:14:33,725
and I just want them down,
please.

308
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:35,927
Look,
I have an important buyer

309
00:14:35,961 --> 00:14:37,395
who's willing to take them
from me

310
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:39,748
for quite a bit of money.

311
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:41,900
But...

312
00:14:41,934 --> 00:14:43,702
I'll sell them to you
for my cost

313
00:14:43,736 --> 00:14:46,237
if you can get me the money
by closing today.

314
00:14:46,272 --> 00:14:47,172
Really?

315
00:14:47,206 --> 00:14:49,040
Oh, thank you.
Thank you so much.

316
00:14:49,058 --> 00:14:51,910
How much do you need?
I will get it to you.

317
00:14:51,944 --> 00:14:53,211
$500, and they're yours.

318
00:14:53,245 --> 00:14:55,013
$500?

319
00:15:06,494 --> 00:15:08,445
I thought maybe
you were thirsty.

320
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:12,015
Unfortunately, I spent
my last dollar on the ticket.

321
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:14,818
You are going to Rome
with no money?

322
00:15:14,836 --> 00:15:17,254
Ah, I guess I'm not one
for planning.

323
00:15:17,288 --> 00:15:20,257
Hmm. Well, lucky for you,

324
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:23,093
refreshments are courtesy
of Pan Am.

325
00:15:23,127 --> 00:15:26,146
I cannot say Rome
will feel the same way.

326
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:29,866
Then I'll have to think
of something before we land.

327
00:15:29,901 --> 00:15:32,469
What do you suggest?
Stealing?

328
00:15:32,503 --> 00:15:33,870
Begging.

329
00:15:33,905 --> 00:15:36,523
Okay.
We'll try it your way.

330
00:15:36,574 --> 00:15:38,492
I beg you to see
the trevi fountain with me

331
00:15:38,543 --> 00:15:39,927
at sunset.

332
00:15:39,978 --> 00:15:42,646
Between you and me,
it's not really the fountain

333
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,598
I'm interested in.

334
00:15:44,632 --> 00:15:49,119
Well, I'm not much interested
in dating these days.

335
00:15:50,555 --> 00:15:52,122
But good company

336
00:15:52,156 --> 00:15:54,324
is always worth the time.

337
00:15:54,342 --> 00:15:55,442
There? You see?

338
00:15:55,476 --> 00:15:57,544
Begging works.

339
00:16:04,902 --> 00:16:07,406
Hey, Kate.

340
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,792
Is it just me, or is there
something off about this guy?

341
00:16:11,843 --> 00:16:13,694
Dean, she's just doing
her job.

342
00:16:13,728 --> 00:16:17,164
Yeah, but does she
have to do it so well?

343
00:16:17,215 --> 00:16:19,900
Here.

344
00:16:19,951 --> 00:16:24,655
Do you think she's serious
about this transfer?

345
00:16:24,689 --> 00:16:26,623
What transfer?

346
00:16:26,658 --> 00:16:29,526
She said she put in
for Hong Kong.

347
00:16:30,795 --> 00:16:32,462
Is this my wallet?

348
00:16:32,497 --> 00:16:36,066
Well...

349
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,434
Here you go.

350
00:16:49,547 --> 00:16:51,982
What's all this?

351
00:16:52,016 --> 00:16:55,085
I was hoping you could tell me,
<i>capitano.</i>

352
00:16:55,119 --> 00:16:58,772
This, uh, is your signature.

353
00:17:01,793 --> 00:17:04,011
This is my name.
I didn't sign this.

354
00:17:04,045 --> 00:17:07,698
Well, this is the cargo manifest
you filed with Italian customs.

355
00:17:07,732 --> 00:17:09,866
Are you aware
of the 400,000 <i>lire</i>

356
00:17:09,884 --> 00:17:13,370
worth of American cigarettes
hidden in your cargo hold?

357
00:17:13,404 --> 00:17:18,008
The captain of any vessel has
an ultimate responsibility for...

358
00:17:18,042 --> 00:17:19,509
For any cargo he's carrying.
I-I understand that.

359
00:17:19,544 --> 00:17:20,811
And can lose his license

360
00:17:20,845 --> 00:17:23,880
and face criminal charges
for smuggling.

361
00:17:23,915 --> 00:17:25,682
I don't know anything
about this,

362
00:17:25,717 --> 00:17:28,919
but I swear to you
we'll get to the bottom of it.

363
00:17:28,953 --> 00:17:31,655
Any suspicious passengers
onboard?

364
00:17:31,689 --> 00:17:35,592
Often they travel alone,
no luggage,

365
00:17:35,626 --> 00:17:37,127
pay for everything in cash.

366
00:17:37,161 --> 00:17:41,298
I-I think I might know someone
who fits that description.

367
00:17:43,468 --> 00:17:46,603
Laura. You okay?

368
00:17:46,637 --> 00:17:48,155
- I don't know.
- I don't know.

369
00:17:48,189 --> 00:17:52,442
I... oh. I'm so sorry.

370
00:17:52,477 --> 00:17:54,995
- I didn't mean to interrupt.
- That's okay.

371
00:17:55,046 --> 00:17:56,847
We could use
a woman's opinion.

372
00:17:58,182 --> 00:18:00,216
- Um...
- Sorry.

373
00:18:00,234 --> 00:18:03,487
I-I'm sorry.
I'll just be a second.

374
00:18:06,741 --> 00:18:10,210
The thing
men don't understand...

375
00:18:10,261 --> 00:18:12,262
Is that the patterns
you choose

376
00:18:12,296 --> 00:18:16,066
announce to everyone
who you are.

377
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:19,569
Colorful or monochromatic?

378
00:18:19,587 --> 00:18:22,155
Timid or bold?

379
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:25,342
Teddy tells me
you were engaged once?

380
00:18:25,376 --> 00:18:27,144
Afraid so, yes.

381
00:18:27,178 --> 00:18:30,547
It was a case of...
Traditional and modern.

382
00:18:30,581 --> 00:18:33,083
And which one were you?

383
00:18:33,117 --> 00:18:35,819
I would like to think
I'm a modern girl.

384
00:18:35,837 --> 00:18:40,257
Me, too, Laura. Me, too.

385
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:43,827
But I'm betting
that's not why you're here.

386
00:18:43,861 --> 00:18:47,964
No. I, um...

387
00:18:47,999 --> 00:18:51,067
I need to borrow some money,
and...

388
00:18:51,102 --> 00:18:55,639
I really don't wanna ask Ted,
but... it's a lot of money.

389
00:18:55,673 --> 00:18:58,291
Well, how much do you need?

390
00:18:58,342 --> 00:18:59,776
Oh, no.

391
00:18:59,811 --> 00:19:02,446
No, not you. I...
I couldn't.

392
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,030
But I could.

393
00:19:04,065 --> 00:19:06,333
Us modern girls
have to stick together.

394
00:19:09,554 --> 00:19:12,022
How much?

395
00:19:12,056 --> 00:19:15,492
$500.

396
00:19:15,526 --> 00:19:18,328
On one condition.

397
00:19:20,281 --> 00:19:21,932
This is not a loan.

398
00:19:21,966 --> 00:19:26,603
It's... an investment
in friendship.

399
00:19:28,573 --> 00:19:29,840
Um, okay.

400
00:19:32,944 --> 00:19:34,644
Thank you.

401
00:19:34,662 --> 00:19:36,279
Thank you.

402
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,529
- Very nice to see you.
- Excuse me.

403
00:19:52,563 --> 00:19:55,031
- A great pleasure.
<i>-Perfecto.</i>

404
00:19:55,066 --> 00:19:56,566
<i>Grazie. Ciao.</i>

405
00:20:03,891 --> 00:20:05,358
What finally convinced you?

406
00:20:05,393 --> 00:20:07,844
Was it the invite
or my charming personality?

407
00:20:07,879 --> 00:20:10,547
Neither. I wanna tell
Jack Kennedy one day

408
00:20:10,581 --> 00:20:12,999
that I dined at
his favorite restaurant in Rome.

409
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:14,684
Right, after you two
become best friends

410
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:16,503
and your kids start playing
backyard football

411
00:20:16,537 --> 00:20:17,871
in Hyannis port.

412
00:20:17,922 --> 00:20:20,323
You act like that
isn't going to happen.

413
00:20:20,358 --> 00:20:23,276
In politics,
everyone knows everyone.

414
00:20:23,311 --> 00:20:24,700
<i>Buon giorno, signore.</i>

415
00:20:24,701 --> 00:20:27,347
Hey, <i>ciao, ragazzo,</i>
<i>molto tempo. Ciao.</i>

416
00:20:27,381 --> 00:20:30,166
So is that your plan, then...
Long-term politics?

417
00:20:30,201 --> 00:20:33,003
'Cause you and I both know
what the odds are for that.

418
00:20:33,037 --> 00:20:35,138
I don't remember
asking for your opinion.

419
00:20:35,172 --> 00:20:37,307
Oh, which is why you should
value it. It's unsolicited.

420
00:20:37,341 --> 00:20:39,809
I made a mistake
coming here.

421
00:20:39,827 --> 00:20:42,913
The truth is,
you're a Pan Am stewardess.

422
00:20:42,947 --> 00:20:45,348
And for some women, that would
be the ultimate accomplishment.

423
00:20:45,383 --> 00:20:48,518
But sooner or later,
you turn 32,

424
00:20:48,553 --> 00:20:50,320
they turn you out,

425
00:20:50,354 --> 00:20:51,688
retire you.

426
00:20:51,706 --> 00:20:54,658
Of course, I've read
your personnel file.

427
00:20:54,692 --> 00:20:55,959
You won't make it that far.

428
00:20:55,993 --> 00:20:58,862
You know how many women
serve in congress?

429
00:20:58,896 --> 00:20:59,846
20.

430
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,032
Which translates
to around 3%.

431
00:21:02,066 --> 00:21:04,367
All of them got into politics
at an earlier age than you

432
00:21:04,402 --> 00:21:07,003
or married into it
or got a college degree for it.

433
00:21:07,038 --> 00:21:08,255
I have a degree.

434
00:21:08,289 --> 00:21:11,308
A real one.
Not a fake one.

435
00:21:18,849 --> 00:21:20,917
Do you know what it is
that I do?

436
00:21:20,952 --> 00:21:23,520
Besides treat every airplane
like your personal limousine

437
00:21:23,554 --> 00:21:25,755
and every stewardess
like your personal...

438
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:27,691
I don't treat planes
like limousines, Maggie.

439
00:21:27,725 --> 00:21:31,494
I treat them like trucks...
Specifically, cargo trucks.

440
00:21:31,529 --> 00:21:33,763
I use them to transport goods
from people who don't need them

441
00:21:33,798 --> 00:21:35,365
to people who do.

442
00:21:35,399 --> 00:21:37,400
You're a smuggler?

443
00:21:37,435 --> 00:21:39,068
I'm a provider.

444
00:21:39,086 --> 00:21:42,155
Now sometimes that means
providing food to the hungry,

445
00:21:42,189 --> 00:21:44,507
clothing to the impoverished,
medicine to the sick.

446
00:21:44,542 --> 00:21:46,276
Cigarettes to the needy,

447
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,811
vodka to the thirsty.

448
00:21:47,845 --> 00:21:50,046
I won't deny that there's
a profit to be made,

449
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,583
but...
It's getting harder.

450
00:21:53,618 --> 00:21:55,719
I need someone inside

451
00:21:55,753 --> 00:21:58,722
to help me with, uh,
with routes, restrictions,

452
00:21:58,756 --> 00:22:00,156
cargo manifests.

453
00:22:00,191 --> 00:22:02,359
And who better to get
through customs,

454
00:22:02,393 --> 00:22:04,861
no questions asked,
than a stewardess?

455
00:22:04,895 --> 00:22:06,663
Oh, not just any stewardess.

456
00:22:06,697 --> 00:22:08,298
You made it to purser.

457
00:22:08,332 --> 00:22:10,467
You have more access
and experience

458
00:22:10,501 --> 00:22:13,737
on a flight crew than
just about anybody else.

459
00:22:13,771 --> 00:22:16,473
What are you asking me?

460
00:22:16,507 --> 00:22:20,744
I need a partner, Maggie...

461
00:22:20,778 --> 00:22:24,014
Someone to share in the risks
and rewards,

462
00:22:24,048 --> 00:22:27,817
and I think that someone...
Is you.

463
00:22:39,229 --> 00:22:40,947
Oh, and I thought
I was a fast driver.

464
00:22:42,809 --> 00:22:45,996
It's not every day
I get to ride on one of these.

465
00:22:46,859 --> 00:22:49,661
Speaking of,
what <i>do</i> you do every day?

466
00:22:49,723 --> 00:22:51,991
I am in the service industry.

467
00:22:52,025 --> 00:22:54,026
I, uh, smile,

468
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:56,062
greet people,
make them feel welcome.

469
00:22:56,081 --> 00:22:58,183
So you're
a Pan Am stewardess.

470
00:22:59,985 --> 00:23:02,937
Perhaps I have found my true calling.

471
00:23:02,972 --> 00:23:06,224
Thank you.

472
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,461
If I tried more begging,

473
00:23:09,495 --> 00:23:11,729
would you join me
for dinner tonight?

474
00:23:11,764 --> 00:23:14,766
Other plans?

475
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,969
We have an official Pan Am
appearance at a party tonight...

476
00:23:18,003 --> 00:23:20,388
- An ambassador's residence.
- Which you're gonna be late for

477
00:23:20,422 --> 00:23:22,240
if you don't hurry up
and get a move on.

478
00:23:22,274 --> 00:23:26,261
Dean, this is Omar. He was
a passenger on our flight.

479
00:23:26,328 --> 00:23:27,745
Oh, yeah,
the man with no luggage.

480
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,747
I remember.
How are you finding Rome?

481
00:23:29,765 --> 00:23:32,283
The sights are quite beautiful.

482
00:23:32,318 --> 00:23:34,486
I'm sure no more beautiful
than wherever it is you're from.

483
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,620
Where <i>are</i> you from?

484
00:23:35,654 --> 00:23:37,722
- Dean.
- What, Colette?

485
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:38,890
You don't know a thing
about this guy.

486
00:23:38,924 --> 00:23:40,458
Don't you wanna find out
a little more

487
00:23:40,493 --> 00:23:41,793
about your friend?

488
00:23:41,827 --> 00:23:43,194
You like cigarettes?

489
00:23:43,228 --> 00:23:43,757
What is this?

490
00:23:43,758 --> 00:23:45,751
I'll tell you about it
on the way to the party.

491
00:23:45,752 --> 00:23:47,599
Well, I'm not going to the
party with you, Dean.

492
00:23:47,633 --> 00:23:49,600
I believe the lady
wants you to leave her alone.

493
00:23:49,618 --> 00:23:51,236
I don't think this is
any of your business.

494
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:52,937
Oh, yes, it is,

495
00:23:52,972 --> 00:23:55,840
because he's coming to the party
with me tonight.

496
00:24:00,012 --> 00:24:02,213
Meet me here at 7:00?

497
00:24:02,247 --> 00:24:04,015
I'd be delighted.

498
00:24:04,049 --> 00:24:05,250
Great.

499
00:24:27,773 --> 00:24:30,942
Could you
get me a negroni at the bar?

500
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:34,679
I'll let <i>him</i> get that
for you.

501
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:46,858
Ohh! Ohh!

502
00:24:46,892 --> 00:24:48,693
- Ahh.
- Hello.

503
00:24:48,727 --> 00:24:49,861
You saved me.

504
00:24:52,231 --> 00:24:54,065
You come to Rome,
you get a pair of shoes,

505
00:24:54,099 --> 00:24:55,783
and... look what happens.

506
00:24:55,818 --> 00:24:59,103
You wind up
in the arms of a stranger.

507
00:24:59,138 --> 00:25:02,106
I am Alessandro D'Arco.
I'm at your service now.

508
00:25:02,141 --> 00:25:03,474
Let me get you a drink.

509
00:25:03,509 --> 00:25:05,143
Yeah, I might take you up
on that a little bit later,

510
00:25:05,177 --> 00:25:08,263
but first I'm...
Just off to the powder room.

511
00:25:08,314 --> 00:25:09,880
Oh, please.

512
00:25:17,957 --> 00:25:19,324
Shoot.

513
00:25:27,933 --> 00:25:30,268
<i>Scusi.</i>

514
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:34,065
Thirsty? I'm told they have
an excellent bellini here.

515
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:35,333
You just don't give up,
do you?

516
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,402
Well, you still haven't
given me an answer.

517
00:25:37,436 --> 00:25:39,203
I said I'd have
to think about it.

518
00:25:39,238 --> 00:25:42,123
There are two Maggie Ryans...
One who thinks about herself

519
00:25:42,174 --> 00:25:43,458
and one who thinks
about others.

520
00:25:43,492 --> 00:25:45,159
You're having a problem
with the second one.

521
00:25:45,194 --> 00:25:47,111
I'm pretty sure
neither Maggie

522
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:49,213
wants to profit
off the misery of others.

523
00:25:49,247 --> 00:25:51,332
Well, you'd be turning
that misery into happiness,

524
00:25:51,366 --> 00:25:53,034
making a profit
at the same time.

525
00:25:53,068 --> 00:25:55,219
Come on, Maggie.
Don't let me down.

526
00:25:55,254 --> 00:25:58,489
I've had my eye on you
since that incident with Dean.

527
00:25:58,524 --> 00:26:00,224
What incident?

528
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:01,726
Don't play dumb.

529
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,162
You saved your job
by exposing his fling

530
00:26:04,196 --> 00:26:06,330
with a certain
Pan Am V.P.'s mistress.

531
00:26:06,365 --> 00:26:07,698
That showed moxie.

532
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:09,200
I was afraid I'd have to
threaten to tell Dean,

533
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:12,970
but... I'm pretty sure I know
what your answer's gonna be.

534
00:26:13,005 --> 00:26:15,406
And how do you know that?

535
00:26:15,441 --> 00:26:20,528
Because, Maggie, you and I...
We're the same.

536
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:23,998
Care for that bellini now?

537
00:26:27,953 --> 00:26:31,222
The modern kitchen is
a fully automated kitchen.

538
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:32,590
Don't you think?

539
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:33,641
Teddy?

540
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:35,259
Hmm?

541
00:26:35,294 --> 00:26:36,594
What's wrong?

542
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:40,198
You've been so...
Distracted.

543
00:26:40,232 --> 00:26:42,700
Well, I don't care about China
or highball glasses

544
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:44,235
or... or toast.
I care about you.

545
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,636
Here... here you are,
getting to know my friends.

546
00:26:45,671 --> 00:26:48,039
I've never met
any of yours.

547
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:51,342
I hardly know
anything about you.

548
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:54,979
Okay, Teddy.

549
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:56,447
Ask away.

550
00:26:56,482 --> 00:26:57,748
Anything you want.

551
00:26:57,766 --> 00:27:00,718
Okay. Okay, good.

552
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:02,687
Um...

553
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:05,790
Let's catch up
on the last 15 years.

554
00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:06,958
Are there, um,

555
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:08,960
any old boyfriends I need
to worry about?

556
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:10,962
No one who compares
to you.

557
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:13,097
I'm beginning to believe
that's actually true.

558
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:16,300
What is that
supposed to mean?

559
00:27:16,335 --> 00:27:18,569
Um...

560
00:27:18,603 --> 00:27:21,556
When I saw you today...
With Laura,

561
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:24,458
you looked happier with her
than you've ever been with me.

562
00:27:24,493 --> 00:27:28,245
No. I am happier with you

563
00:27:28,263 --> 00:27:31,883
than I have ever been
in my life.

564
00:27:37,689 --> 00:27:39,757
Come with me.

565
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:45,930
What are you doing?

566
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,434
I can't wait any longer.

567
00:27:58,644 --> 00:28:00,711
So do you want to dance?

568
00:28:00,746 --> 00:28:03,881
Where did you learn
to dance like this?

569
00:28:03,915 --> 00:28:06,417
- Here and there.
- Oh.

570
00:28:06,435 --> 00:28:08,186
I am well trained.

571
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,654
Clearly.

572
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:13,857
I ask you questions.
You dance around them.

573
00:28:13,876 --> 00:28:16,093
Your friend, the captain,

574
00:28:16,128 --> 00:28:19,497
has made you
more curious about me.

575
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,482
He was right.

576
00:28:21,516 --> 00:28:23,251
We've spent the day together,

577
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:25,570
but I know next to nothing
about you.

578
00:28:25,604 --> 00:28:30,808
I am a man who cannot enjoy
the same freedom as you.

579
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:32,310
And yet you woke up
this morning,

580
00:28:32,344 --> 00:28:37,248
hopped on a plane to Rome
with no luggage or money,

581
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:40,784
and you are now wearing
an expensive new suit.

582
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:43,704
I am not without friends in Rome.

583
00:28:43,739 --> 00:28:47,008
Dancing again.

584
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:50,094
Today has been
a fantasy for me.

585
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:56,183
I suppose I wanted to enjoy it
for a little while longer.

586
00:28:56,218 --> 00:29:01,405
And just like that,
our dance must come to an end.

587
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:02,607
Right. That's him.

588
00:29:02,641 --> 00:29:04,175
Dean, what are you doing?

589
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:05,443
He's a smuggler, Colette.

590
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:07,328
No, he's not.
That's not possible.

591
00:29:07,362 --> 00:29:08,479
Oh, then let's let
the carabinieri decide

592
00:29:08,513 --> 00:29:09,864
whether or not
he's a wanted man.

593
00:29:09,898 --> 00:29:11,749
Oh, he's most definitely
a wanted man.

594
00:29:11,783 --> 00:29:15,403
Your family's been very worried
about you, your highness.

595
00:29:17,022 --> 00:29:19,590
"Your highness"?

596
00:29:19,625 --> 00:29:23,878
This is prince Omar III
of the Kingdom of Wahran.

597
00:29:23,912 --> 00:29:26,999
You're a prince?

598
00:29:33,769 --> 00:29:35,239
A prince?

599
00:29:37,673 --> 00:29:39,107
You're absolutely certain?

600
00:29:39,141 --> 00:29:42,143
Interpol has been circulating
his photo for days.

601
00:29:42,178 --> 00:29:44,446
Dean, could you give us
a minute?

602
00:29:52,755 --> 00:29:55,490
I apologize
for my deception.

603
00:29:55,524 --> 00:29:58,927
I needed to escape
my life...

604
00:29:58,961 --> 00:30:00,829
Obligations.

605
00:30:00,863 --> 00:30:04,733
You smile, greet people,

606
00:30:04,767 --> 00:30:06,768
make them feel welcome?

607
00:30:06,802 --> 00:30:07,869
There. You see?

608
00:30:07,903 --> 00:30:10,071
My life is not so different
than yours.

609
00:30:10,106 --> 00:30:13,875
Well, there is the royal palace.

610
00:30:13,909 --> 00:30:17,379
A palace can be a prison
as well.

611
00:30:17,413 --> 00:30:19,898
Omar, why didn't you say...

612
00:30:19,949 --> 00:30:21,249
Tell you sooner?

613
00:30:21,284 --> 00:30:25,020
Would you have treated me
the same if I had?

614
00:30:25,054 --> 00:30:27,022
Your highness,

615
00:30:27,056 --> 00:30:31,559
we have a police escort waiting
to take you to the airport.

616
00:30:36,582 --> 00:30:40,335
What are you doing
a week from this Friday?

617
00:30:40,369 --> 00:30:41,736
I am to dine
at the White House,

618
00:30:41,771 --> 00:30:44,572
and it occurs to me
I have no one to bring.

619
00:30:44,607 --> 00:30:47,409
You won't make me beg,
will you?

620
00:30:47,443 --> 00:30:49,944
No more begging.

621
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,814
I would love to.

622
00:31:02,858 --> 00:31:04,092
You again.

623
00:31:04,126 --> 00:31:06,561
You're following me,
Alessandro?

624
00:31:06,595 --> 00:31:08,930
<i>Martini. Due olive.</i>

625
00:31:08,964 --> 00:31:11,633
Well, I suppose
I cannot help myself.

626
00:31:11,667 --> 00:31:13,401
How are those new shoes?

627
00:31:13,436 --> 00:31:15,603
Oh, it's nothing a Martini
can't fix.

628
00:31:15,638 --> 00:31:18,340
You're a friend
of the ambassador?

629
00:31:18,374 --> 00:31:22,010
I'm a Pan Am stewardess.
We're friends to the world.

630
00:31:22,044 --> 00:31:25,113
That must include me, then.

631
00:31:25,131 --> 00:31:27,515
Well...

632
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:31,086
A few more drinks, and...

633
00:31:31,153 --> 00:31:34,723
Maybe you'll find out.

634
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:38,043
<i>Grazie.</i>

635
00:31:46,135 --> 00:31:48,470
Shoot!

636
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:06,020
It's my fault.

637
00:32:06,055 --> 00:32:10,024
No. Teddy, it was... nice.

638
00:32:10,059 --> 00:32:11,493
It'll... it'll get better.

639
00:32:11,527 --> 00:32:13,495
Of course it will.

640
00:32:13,529 --> 00:32:14,596
My first time
was with Theresa Miller

641
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:16,531
in our boathouse,
in a rowboat, no less,

642
00:32:16,565 --> 00:32:18,199
which is much more difficult
than it sounds.

643
00:32:18,234 --> 00:32:20,935
There were oars everywhere...

644
00:32:22,438 --> 00:32:26,541
My point is, is everybody
has a story

645
00:32:26,575 --> 00:32:29,611
about their first time,
and this will be ours.

646
00:32:29,645 --> 00:32:32,781
I really should go.

647
00:32:32,815 --> 00:32:34,549
Why?

648
00:32:34,583 --> 00:32:37,118
Well, we're not married yet.
People will talk.

649
00:32:37,153 --> 00:32:38,486
Who cares what people say?

650
00:32:38,521 --> 00:32:41,389
I do, Ted.

651
00:32:43,993 --> 00:32:45,026
Can you...

652
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,895
Turn around?

653
00:32:49,331 --> 00:32:50,965
Yeah.

654
00:33:01,494 --> 00:33:03,411
Oh, wow. It's you.

655
00:33:03,446 --> 00:33:04,979
You're the model.

656
00:33:05,014 --> 00:33:06,631
No, no, you must have
the wrong person.

657
00:33:06,682 --> 00:33:09,350
No, it's... it's you.
How cool.

658
00:33:09,384 --> 00:33:12,821
You must be so proud.
I could never be this brave.

659
00:33:12,855 --> 00:33:15,390
It was nothing, really.

660
00:33:15,424 --> 00:33:18,426
Nothing?
These are empowering.

661
00:33:20,229 --> 00:33:21,679
Thank you.

662
00:33:21,714 --> 00:33:23,815
You know, the art critic
from the "Village voice"

663
00:33:23,866 --> 00:33:26,701
said these photos
are transcendent.

664
00:33:26,735 --> 00:33:29,187
Really? Are you sure?

665
00:33:29,238 --> 00:33:30,438
Very sure.

666
00:33:30,473 --> 00:33:32,423
That critic was me.

667
00:33:32,475 --> 00:33:35,443
How does it feel to be
a pioneer?

668
00:33:35,478 --> 00:33:37,145
Uh...

669
00:33:37,179 --> 00:33:39,914
When the buyer heard that
you wanted the prints back,

670
00:33:39,949 --> 00:33:41,182
he asked to meet you.

671
00:33:41,217 --> 00:33:42,317
Who's the buyer?

672
00:33:42,351 --> 00:33:45,086
Local artist.
Maybe you've heard of him.

673
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,754
Andy Warhol.

674
00:33:56,832 --> 00:33:58,850
So I figure
we start in Vienna.

675
00:33:58,884 --> 00:34:00,368
Work our way East.

676
00:34:00,402 --> 00:34:02,337
The Soviet bloc... they're crazy
for American whiskey.

677
00:34:02,371 --> 00:34:02,922
Broyles...

678
00:34:02,923 --> 00:34:05,073
We trade for beluga
caviar and vodka.

679
00:34:05,107 --> 00:34:06,641
We make a profit
coming and going.

680
00:34:06,675 --> 00:34:08,510
Then we can open up
a new South American route.

681
00:34:08,544 --> 00:34:10,428
I can't do this.

682
00:34:10,462 --> 00:34:13,281
Go ahead and tell Dean.
Tell him everything.

683
00:34:13,315 --> 00:34:15,116
Maggie,
let's not get crazy.

684
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:16,484
What's the worst
that can happen?

685
00:34:16,519 --> 00:34:19,454
You lose Pan Am.
You lose everything.

686
00:34:19,488 --> 00:34:20,655
I'll take that risk.

687
00:34:20,689 --> 00:34:21,722
And why would you do that?

688
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:23,091
Because you got
the wrong Maggie.

689
00:34:23,125 --> 00:34:25,760
Because I can always go back
to changing the world,

690
00:34:25,794 --> 00:34:27,462
one doorbell at a time,

691
00:34:27,496 --> 00:34:32,166
and because most of all,
I'm nothing like you.

692
00:34:42,711 --> 00:34:45,647
You're leaving so soon?

693
00:34:45,681 --> 00:34:47,282
I was having such
a good time.

694
00:34:47,316 --> 00:34:49,634
I almost forgot
I have an early flight.

695
00:34:49,685 --> 00:34:51,769
Let me at least
walk you out.

696
00:34:53,355 --> 00:34:54,872
Where is that ticket?

697
00:34:58,894 --> 00:35:02,730
Oh, uh, is this...
Is this yours?

698
00:35:02,765 --> 00:35:05,833
Oh, yes, 47. It's mine.

699
00:35:05,851 --> 00:35:07,468
Are you sure it's yours?

700
00:35:07,503 --> 00:35:10,371
You wouldn't be trying to swipe
some poor stranger's jacket.

701
00:35:10,389 --> 00:35:12,707
I would never do that.

702
00:35:12,725 --> 00:35:13,942
Oh, here.

703
00:35:13,976 --> 00:35:15,476
Please, allow me to help?

704
00:35:15,494 --> 00:35:19,414
Oh.

705
00:35:19,448 --> 00:35:22,917
Are all American women
this accommodating?

706
00:35:22,935 --> 00:35:25,987
Oh, well, you'll have to come
to America to find out.

707
00:35:26,005 --> 00:35:29,824
Oh, I'm sorry.
Where is <i>your</i> coat?

708
00:35:29,858 --> 00:35:32,694
You know, I think I left
my ticket in the powder room.

709
00:35:32,728 --> 00:35:34,495
I guess this is good-bye.

710
00:35:36,732 --> 00:35:41,669
In Rome, we never say good-bye.
<i>Arrivederci.</i>

711
00:35:41,704 --> 00:35:44,138
Until we meet again.

712
00:35:48,861 --> 00:35:50,778
Gotcha.

713
00:36:04,193 --> 00:36:05,893
The guy was a prince.

714
00:36:05,928 --> 00:36:09,397
That's just my luck.

715
00:36:09,431 --> 00:36:11,416
He fit a profile.

716
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:14,836
Now it's back to me.

717
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:16,771
You fit another profile.

718
00:36:16,805 --> 00:36:20,625
Many of these smugglers
work from the inside.

719
00:36:20,676 --> 00:36:24,379
Who has better access
to the cargo hold than a pilot?

720
00:36:24,413 --> 00:36:27,415
If you really want to catch
this guy,

721
00:36:27,449 --> 00:36:29,817
I would look
within your company.

722
00:36:33,989 --> 00:36:36,574
Excuse me.

723
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:44,065
Ah, captain Lowrey,
just the man I'm looking for.

724
00:36:44,099 --> 00:36:45,166
Uhh!

725
00:36:46,502 --> 00:36:49,270
Find another ride home.

726
00:37:05,588 --> 00:37:07,322
Colette.

727
00:37:07,356 --> 00:37:08,657
Hey,
would you hear me out?

728
00:37:08,691 --> 00:37:09,875
I don't want
another discussion.

729
00:37:09,926 --> 00:37:13,161
I was wrong. Okay?

730
00:37:13,196 --> 00:37:14,696
I was wrong about Omar,

731
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:17,766
and I've been wrong about a lot
of things, and I'm sorry.

732
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,701
I thought that I could
protect you,

733
00:37:19,735 --> 00:37:23,338
but I understand that
I can't do that anymore, so...

734
00:37:23,372 --> 00:37:29,845
I'm gonna respect your wishes,
and I'll leave you alone.

735
00:37:45,494 --> 00:37:48,063
I'm sorry. These are
already spoken for.

736
00:37:48,097 --> 00:37:51,416
I can see why.
She looks so brave.

737
00:37:51,467 --> 00:37:52,834
A pioneer.

738
00:37:52,869 --> 00:37:54,769
I think she has
a pretty bright future.

739
00:37:54,787 --> 00:37:57,289
- Can I take your coat?
- Thank you.

740
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:59,107
So are you ready
to meet Andy?

741
00:37:59,141 --> 00:38:01,509
Yes.
Yes, I am.

742
00:38:01,544 --> 00:38:03,144
Good, good,
'cause word on the street

743
00:38:03,179 --> 00:38:04,729
is he's looking
for a new model...

744
00:38:04,814 --> 00:38:08,216
Someone brave,
you know, a pioneer.

745
00:38:08,251 --> 00:38:10,252
He wants <i>me?</i>

746
00:38:10,286 --> 00:38:13,555
We'll see.
He'll be here in a minute.

747
00:38:20,596 --> 00:38:23,031
- Hi.
- Hi.

748
00:38:24,333 --> 00:38:26,768
- Do you wanna sit down?
- Sure.

749
00:38:31,374 --> 00:38:33,208
Teddy, I've been
thinking about last night.

750
00:38:33,242 --> 00:38:34,576
So have I.

751
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:37,145
And I think you were right.

752
00:38:37,179 --> 00:38:39,214
It gets better.

753
00:38:39,248 --> 00:38:41,316
And that's marriage, right?

754
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:43,818
You start with something,

755
00:38:43,853 --> 00:38:46,721
and you build on it,
grow it.

756
00:38:46,756 --> 00:38:49,491
No, that's not marriage.

757
00:38:49,525 --> 00:38:53,128
You can't... build on something
if there's no honesty.

758
00:38:58,701 --> 00:39:01,870
Okay.

759
00:39:01,904 --> 00:39:03,538
You want honesty.

760
00:39:03,572 --> 00:39:05,473
Yeah.

761
00:39:05,508 --> 00:39:09,377
Yes.

762
00:39:09,412 --> 00:39:14,549
I am... more comfortable
with women than men.

763
00:39:14,583 --> 00:39:17,152
And I don't know why...

764
00:39:17,186 --> 00:39:21,890
Or how it happened.

765
00:39:21,924 --> 00:39:24,025
It's something
I always felt.

766
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:26,261
But what I do know,

767
00:39:26,295 --> 00:39:28,463
Teddy...

768
00:39:28,497 --> 00:39:30,799
Is that I love you,

769
00:39:30,833 --> 00:39:33,668
and I want to be married
to you.

770
00:39:33,703 --> 00:39:36,104
How?

771
00:39:36,138 --> 00:39:38,340
Don't you see?

772
00:39:38,374 --> 00:39:41,076
It'll be perfect.

773
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:44,913
You can...
see whoever you want,

774
00:39:44,947 --> 00:39:48,650
and... I can see who I want.

775
00:39:48,684 --> 00:39:51,019
But we'll still have us...

776
00:39:51,053 --> 00:39:55,690
Our life, our family,

777
00:39:55,725 --> 00:39:57,993
the house
and the white picket fence.

778
00:39:58,027 --> 00:40:00,962
We can still have everything.

779
00:40:00,997 --> 00:40:03,565
You can even have Laura.

780
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:05,367
Laura?

781
00:40:05,401 --> 00:40:09,671
I see the way
you look at each other.

782
00:40:09,705 --> 00:40:11,539
A woman knows.

783
00:40:11,574 --> 00:40:13,541
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, no!

784
00:40:13,576 --> 00:40:14,876
What are they saying?

785
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:16,995
What's going on?

786
00:40:19,115 --> 00:40:20,949
- What's wrong?
- For Juan Trippe, right away.

787
00:40:20,983 --> 00:40:24,285
- Yeah.
- I don't know.

788
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,221
No!

789
00:40:26,255 --> 00:40:27,322
<i>We interrupt this program</i>

790
00:40:27,356 --> 00:40:29,958
