1
00:00:01,369 --> 00:00:02,402
<i>Previously on "Pan Am"...</i>

2
00:00:03,001 --> 00:00:05,869
You smell like whiskey
and cigarettes.

3
00:00:05,914 --> 00:00:08,281
You smell like... Paris.

4
00:00:08,349 --> 00:00:09,817
I don't wanna worry
about you

5
00:00:09,884 --> 00:00:11,417
and I don't wanna
take care of you.

6
00:00:11,485 --> 00:00:12,919
Who's asking you to?

7
00:00:12,986 --> 00:00:16,355
Well, it ain't much,
but it's home. Welcome aboard.

8
00:00:17,825 --> 00:00:21,293
My mind is full of you.
You follow me like a ghost.

9
00:00:21,361 --> 00:00:23,062
Are you in danger?

10
00:00:23,129 --> 00:00:25,598
Tito has put
an entire nation in danger.

11
00:00:25,666 --> 00:00:27,799
- You want him to spy for you?
- For us.

12
00:00:27,867 --> 00:00:29,167
You want me to turn him?

13
00:00:29,234 --> 00:00:30,969
Welcome to the big leagues.

14
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:46,617
I am a jelly doughnut!

15
00:00:53,057 --> 00:00:55,425
Berlin, right?
"The Village Voice."

16
00:00:55,494 --> 00:00:56,994
You remember.

17
00:00:57,061 --> 00:01:01,097
I hear you have...
Amazing credentials. Ow.

18
00:01:01,164 --> 00:01:03,566
You'll have to excuse her.

19
00:01:03,634 --> 00:01:05,434
She's been drinking
sloe gin fizzes.

20
00:01:05,503 --> 00:01:08,304
There is a lot of alcohol in it,
but they just taste so good.

21
00:01:08,372 --> 00:01:09,438
That's
an enticing combination.

22
00:01:09,507 --> 00:01:10,773
Here. Take mine.

23
00:01:14,044 --> 00:01:15,377
She triples the sugar.

24
00:01:17,914 --> 00:01:18,847
Great song.

25
00:01:18,915 --> 00:01:22,150
Listen,
earlier on the plane...

26
00:01:22,218 --> 00:01:25,654
Joe, this... this is
Maggie's friend Sam.

27
00:01:25,722 --> 00:01:28,456
Sam is, um,
he's into s... philosophy.

28
00:01:28,525 --> 00:01:29,791
Nice to meet you.

29
00:01:29,859 --> 00:01:33,794
"We have all been in
this white doghouse too long."

30
00:01:33,862 --> 00:01:34,795
Excuse me?

31
00:01:34,863 --> 00:01:35,830
Malcolm X.

32
00:01:35,898 --> 00:01:38,733
Right.

33
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,635
You two have fun.

34
00:01:48,042 --> 00:01:49,475
Hello, miss.

35
00:01:49,544 --> 00:01:53,312
I seem to have left my lighter
at your establishment.

36
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,314
I'd like to return it
to you, Mr. Lonza,

37
00:01:55,382 --> 00:01:57,817
but you'll have
to describe it first,

38
00:01:57,885 --> 00:02:00,921
make sure it's yours.

39
00:02:02,756 --> 00:02:04,322
Smooth...

40
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:08,761
Cool to the touch,
hot flame.

41
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:10,829
Why, that describes
any old lighter.

42
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:13,666
Well, then I guess, um...

43
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:16,435
I'll have to inspect it.

44
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:28,246
It's definitely yours.

45
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:29,948
You know, when you called
in the middle of the night

46
00:02:30,015 --> 00:02:31,149
and said,
"come over to my place,"

47
00:02:31,217 --> 00:02:32,784
this isn't exactly
what I expected.

48
00:02:32,851 --> 00:02:35,053
Oh? What did you expect?

49
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,388
Something that involves
a few less people.

50
00:02:37,456 --> 00:02:39,290
Well, as far
as I'm concerned, Michael,

51
00:02:39,357 --> 00:02:40,958
you're the only one
in the room.

52
00:02:41,025 --> 00:02:42,960
Mm!

53
00:02:45,097 --> 00:02:46,130
No.

54
00:02:46,198 --> 00:02:47,465
Four times.

55
00:02:47,532 --> 00:02:50,634
In a row?

56
00:02:50,702 --> 00:02:52,802
Mike Ruskin
of "the Village Voice"?

57
00:02:52,869 --> 00:02:55,472
Has
very impressive credentials.

58
00:02:58,209 --> 00:03:01,311
Colette, truth or dare?

59
00:03:01,378 --> 00:03:03,146
Dare.

60
00:03:03,214 --> 00:03:04,214
Of course.

61
00:03:04,281 --> 00:03:05,248
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm.

62
00:03:05,316 --> 00:03:07,083
Something Colette
would never do.

63
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,083
Mm. Okay, okay.

64
00:03:08,151 --> 00:03:10,051
Oh, got it. Fly the plane.

65
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,920
Don't be ridiculous.
It has to be something

66
00:03:11,988 --> 00:03:13,288
she can actually accomplish.

67
00:03:13,356 --> 00:03:15,056
A girl on the "Clipper Horizon"
made it happen.

68
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:16,057
Really?

69
00:03:16,126 --> 00:03:17,726
- Mm-hmm.
- Yes, and six months later...

70
00:03:17,793 --> 00:03:19,928
She was married
to her captain.

71
00:03:19,996 --> 00:03:23,764
Mm. Well, Dean does seem
awfully fond of you.

72
00:03:23,832 --> 00:03:25,399
Oh, I doubt he's that fond.

73
00:03:26,468 --> 00:03:30,771
Fine.
Tie a knot in the stem.

74
00:03:30,839 --> 00:03:32,673
- Hmm.
- No hands.

75
00:03:32,741 --> 00:03:33,674
Ohh.
Ooh.

76
00:03:34,909 --> 00:03:36,410
Now Laura.

77
00:03:36,478 --> 00:03:39,946
Okay. Truth.

78
00:03:40,014 --> 00:03:41,881
I took nude photos.

79
00:03:45,853 --> 00:03:47,954
I was supposed to wait
for the question, wasn't I?

80
00:03:49,423 --> 00:03:51,758
The "Life" magazine
photographer?

81
00:03:51,825 --> 00:03:53,527
No.

82
00:03:53,594 --> 00:03:54,594
Laura, what were you
thinking?

83
00:03:54,662 --> 00:03:55,894
I was thinking that I wanted

84
00:03:55,962 --> 00:03:58,964
to embrace my sexuality
on my terms.

85
00:03:59,032 --> 00:04:00,432
Most girls do that
with a bottle of a red

86
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,900
and a roomy backseat.

87
00:04:01,968 --> 00:04:04,036
Maggie! I didn't do that.

88
00:04:04,103 --> 00:04:06,305
I didn't do that. No, it was...

89
00:04:06,373 --> 00:04:08,641
It was about self-expression...

90
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:11,577
And he
wasn't the right guy for sex.

91
00:04:11,645 --> 00:04:13,578
He was the right guy
for nude photos.

92
00:04:15,181 --> 00:04:16,815
What,
there's a right guy for that?

93
00:04:18,851 --> 00:04:20,118
Sorry to interrupt, ladies.

94
00:04:20,186 --> 00:04:22,420
I know you girls thought
this flight was a freebie,

95
00:04:22,488 --> 00:04:25,090
but Pan Am's doing a little
favor for Uncle Sam.

96
00:04:25,158 --> 00:04:27,258
Shuttling sailors,
to be precise,

97
00:04:27,326 --> 00:04:29,960
sailors who spent
the last six months underwater,

98
00:04:30,028 --> 00:04:33,064
so let's... let's clean up
the girlie business.

99
00:04:33,131 --> 00:04:36,133
Mm.

100
00:04:36,201 --> 00:04:39,369
Is there... is there something
wrong with your mouth?

101
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:44,841
Ah.

102
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:46,475
Oh, impressive.
Mm.

103
00:04:46,543 --> 00:04:48,644
Okay. I think
we're done here, ladies.

104
00:04:51,348 --> 00:04:52,782
- Help me up. Ohh.
- That's not funny.

105
00:05:00,523 --> 00:05:02,257
Welcome to Pan Am.

106
00:05:02,325 --> 00:05:05,060
Please take
a seat in our first class.

107
00:05:05,128 --> 00:05:06,228
Welcome.

108
00:05:06,295 --> 00:05:07,229
Welcome aboard, sir.

109
00:05:07,296 --> 00:05:09,231
Joe. Name's Joe.

110
00:05:12,468 --> 00:05:15,370
Welcome to Pan Am.

111
00:05:18,707 --> 00:05:22,243
Sync and corrected by dr.jackson
for www.addic7ed.com

112
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,745
Here you go. Stay dry.

113
00:05:23,812 --> 00:05:26,881
Thanks. Best debriefing
of the month.

114
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,851
Ciao.
Ciao.

115
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:31,719
You're leaving?

116
00:05:31,787 --> 00:05:35,088
Well...  Sharing a room
only works most of the time.

117
00:05:35,156 --> 00:05:38,259
Right.
I'll see you tomorrow.

118
00:05:38,326 --> 00:05:39,860
Have a good night.

119
00:05:48,669 --> 00:05:49,869
Joe.

120
00:05:51,104 --> 00:05:53,706
I... thought you left already.

121
00:05:53,774 --> 00:05:55,241
I hit the head.

122
00:05:56,977 --> 00:05:59,779
Listen, you better keep
this joint a secret,

123
00:05:59,846 --> 00:06:02,014
or every bluejacket
and boatswain in the Navy

124
00:06:02,082 --> 00:06:03,949
is gonna show up
in your living room.

125
00:06:04,017 --> 00:06:08,119
I'm glad you had fun.

126
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:13,258
Well, um...

127
00:06:14,627 --> 00:06:16,395
Good-bye.

128
00:06:16,462 --> 00:06:18,730
I thought I was staying
the night.

129
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:23,334
Maggie I told me I could
have the couch...

130
00:06:24,869 --> 00:06:26,437
But if that's a problem...

131
00:06:26,505 --> 00:06:28,739
N-no. No problem at all.

132
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:39,482
Ohh.

133
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:46,489
Ohh.

134
00:06:57,967 --> 00:07:00,435
Hello.

135
00:07:00,502 --> 00:07:02,037
Richard,
he's leaving Thursday.

136
00:07:02,104 --> 00:07:03,538
Kate?

137
00:07:03,605 --> 00:07:07,542
They're recalling him back
to Yugoslavia... for good.

138
00:07:07,609 --> 00:07:09,845
You have to do something.

139
00:07:09,912 --> 00:07:12,214
Hello?

140
00:07:12,281 --> 00:07:13,882
Hello, Richard?

141
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,150
You're with Lonza now?

142
00:07:15,218 --> 00:07:17,852
He's in my apartment.

143
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:21,055
I told him
I was going out for champagne.

144
00:07:21,122 --> 00:07:23,390
You'd better get back.
Sit tight.

145
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:25,059
We'll figure something out.

146
00:07:47,787 --> 00:07:49,754
Mind if I leave this open?

147
00:07:49,822 --> 00:07:51,555
I kinda miss
the taste of fresh air.

148
00:07:51,624 --> 00:07:54,692
Of course not.
Uh, it might get chilly.

149
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,594
Here's hopin'.

150
00:07:56,662 --> 00:07:58,562
No such thing as chilly
on a submarine.

151
00:07:58,631 --> 00:08:01,565
At least let me get you
another blanket. This... this...

152
00:08:01,634 --> 00:08:03,267
Oh, no. This will do fine.

153
00:08:03,335 --> 00:08:05,736
If I start freezing to death,
I'll come find you.

154
00:08:07,238 --> 00:08:09,339
For... another blanket.

155
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:11,908
Right. Yes. Please do.

156
00:08:11,976 --> 00:08:14,377
If you're freezing to death.

157
00:08:14,445 --> 00:08:17,881
Laura, thank you
for letting me stay.

158
00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:19,415
I'm grateful.

159
00:08:21,619 --> 00:08:23,319
Good night.

160
00:09:06,929 --> 00:09:08,262
Your drink.

161
00:09:10,932 --> 00:09:13,233
I can't believe you made it
back here in one piece.

162
00:09:13,301 --> 00:09:14,768
Everything all right?

163
00:09:14,836 --> 00:09:16,436
How do you mean?

164
00:09:16,504 --> 00:09:20,007
You've got a pretty healthy grip
on that armrest.

165
00:09:20,075 --> 00:09:24,111
Flying makes me
a little queasy.

166
00:09:24,179 --> 00:09:25,978
I'm not sure
rum is the remedy for that.

167
00:09:26,046 --> 00:09:28,981
I'm in the Navy, ma'am.
Rum is the remedy to everything.

168
00:09:31,618 --> 00:09:33,352
You don't have
to call me "ma'am."

169
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,788
I'm... my name is Laura.

170
00:09:35,856 --> 00:09:40,093
Can't you just close your eyes
and pretend this is a submarine?

171
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,594
That's what I do
when I get nervous.

172
00:09:42,661 --> 00:09:45,130
You pretend you're
in a submarine?

173
00:09:45,198 --> 00:09:48,200
I pretend
I'm somewhere else,

174
00:09:48,267 --> 00:09:49,835
somewhere I feel safe.

175
00:09:49,902 --> 00:09:53,739
Can I ask you somethin'...
Private?

176
00:09:53,806 --> 00:09:56,007
Sure.

177
00:09:56,075 --> 00:09:58,209
Say you and I were close,

178
00:09:58,276 --> 00:10:00,845
and I did somethin'
to make you mad at me,

179
00:10:00,912 --> 00:10:04,248
and we didn't talk
for a long time.

180
00:10:04,315 --> 00:10:07,918
You think maybe this
would make it go easier

181
00:10:07,986 --> 00:10:09,653
when I saw you again?

182
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:17,994
It's beautiful.

183
00:10:18,062 --> 00:10:21,597
Yeah, but is it enough?

184
00:10:23,667 --> 00:10:27,637
In this scenario,
am I your girlfriend?

185
00:10:27,704 --> 00:10:32,207
Uh, no, sorry.
You're my mama.

186
00:10:32,275 --> 00:10:33,809
I'm your mama?

187
00:10:33,877 --> 00:10:36,979
See, we've always been close...
Real close,

188
00:10:37,046 --> 00:10:40,348
but when I decided to join
the Navy, she didn't understand,

189
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:43,451
took it personal, thought
my leavin' was somehow sayin',

190
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,254
Redwater, Mississippi,
wasn't good enough,

191
00:10:45,321 --> 00:10:49,023
that <i>she</i> wasn't good enough,
only that wasn't it.

192
00:10:49,091 --> 00:10:50,825
You just wanted to see
the world.

193
00:10:50,893 --> 00:10:52,960
Yeah. Seemed like
too big a place

194
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:56,697
not to go wanderin' in it,
but she ain't spoke to me since.

195
00:10:56,765 --> 00:11:01,102
I send her postcards,
but... nothin'.

196
00:11:03,137 --> 00:11:05,071
I think the hummingbird
is beautiful,

197
00:11:05,139 --> 00:11:08,441
but I'll bet
what she really wants

198
00:11:08,509 --> 00:11:11,044
is to know
that wherever you go,

199
00:11:11,112 --> 00:11:14,214
you still need her,
just like before.

200
00:11:14,282 --> 00:11:15,682
You don't know my mama.

201
00:11:15,749 --> 00:11:16,883
Oh, I think I do.

202
00:11:16,951 --> 00:11:18,383
- That so?
- I'm pretty sure

203
00:11:18,451 --> 00:11:20,752
my mother could give your mama
a run for her money.

204
00:11:20,821 --> 00:11:23,322
Uh, my mama
don't run nowhere.

205
00:11:23,389 --> 00:11:25,090
She just commands
from right where she is.

206
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,028
My mother ambushed me...

207
00:11:29,095 --> 00:11:30,029
Ooh.

208
00:11:30,096 --> 00:11:31,030
- Uh...
- Mm.

209
00:11:31,097 --> 00:11:32,464
Can I help you?

210
00:11:32,532 --> 00:11:34,899
I got a little
top secret business to discuss.

211
00:11:34,967 --> 00:11:36,434
Here? Now?

212
00:11:36,501 --> 00:11:38,402
Yeah, we don't have much time.
We got a friend over there

213
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:40,805
who is about to
surrender himself to the enemy.

214
00:11:40,873 --> 00:11:41,973
A defector?

215
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:43,308
Uh, in a manner
of speaking.

216
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:44,775
Listen, this is
our last chance to give him

217
00:11:44,844 --> 00:11:46,344
the send-off he deserves,
and, uh...

218
00:11:46,411 --> 00:11:49,447
Boy-o,
does he love the redheads.

219
00:11:49,514 --> 00:11:50,780
Wait. What?

220
00:11:50,849 --> 00:11:52,415
Yeah, I ain't askin'
for the full gypsy Rose Lee.

221
00:11:52,483 --> 00:11:54,751
Just, you know, toss the hat,
drop the jacket,

222
00:11:54,819 --> 00:11:57,054
do a little shimmy.
Uh, you... come on.

223
00:11:57,121 --> 00:11:59,056
I got a sailor over there
who's getting married.

224
00:11:59,123 --> 00:12:00,891
He needs a stag party.

225
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,126
You want a stripper so badly,
you can do it yourself.

226
00:12:03,194 --> 00:12:06,062
And we're out there
every day protecting you

227
00:12:06,129 --> 00:12:07,830
from the dirty communists,
and we...

228
00:12:07,898 --> 00:12:09,999
You're not a dirty communist
lover, are ya?

229
00:12:16,673 --> 00:12:18,140
Snow.

230
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:20,910
Well, definitely snow. What's...
What's Christmas without snow?

231
00:12:20,978 --> 00:12:23,746
And a Douglas fir.

232
00:12:23,813 --> 00:12:27,483
Or, um, how do you
call it... spruce?

233
00:12:28,918 --> 00:12:32,921
Very well, a spruce,
but with colored lights.

234
00:12:32,989 --> 00:12:34,256
Or maybe only white.

235
00:12:34,323 --> 00:12:36,892
Hey, I'm giving in
on the spruce.

236
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:41,429
Yeah, 6 or 7 feet tall,
which I will cut down myself.

237
00:12:41,497 --> 00:12:46,768
From the forest
behind the house?

238
00:12:46,835 --> 00:12:48,002
Mm-hmm.

239
00:12:49,337 --> 00:12:50,805
Are you expecting someone?

240
00:12:51,874 --> 00:12:54,074
At 1:00 in the morning?

241
00:12:54,142 --> 00:12:56,109
Ohh. It could be
the neighbors.

242
00:12:56,176 --> 00:12:57,878
The wife
kicks him out a lot.

243
00:12:57,945 --> 00:12:59,212
Kate, get on
your fire escape.

244
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,481
What? We don't even know
who it is.

245
00:13:01,549 --> 00:13:02,482
Exactly.

246
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,017
Niko, it's raining outside.

247
00:13:05,085 --> 00:13:05,985
Okay,
before I get drenched,

248
00:13:06,053 --> 00:13:08,321
can I at least check
the peephole?

249
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:17,230
Mrs. Luckovich?

250
00:13:17,298 --> 00:13:20,900
I saw your light on,
or I wouldn't bother you.

251
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:22,368
Is something wrong?

252
00:13:22,436 --> 00:13:24,237
Do you have a hot water bottle
I can borrow?

253
00:13:24,305 --> 00:13:25,871
My arthritis is acting up.

254
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,973
Of course. Come in.

255
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,710
It's my nosy neighbor.

256
00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:33,412
Do you still want me
out the window?

257
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,080
There's
a first time for everything.

258
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:41,420
- It's all right.
- No.

259
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,380
We're here to pick up your package.
Is he armed?

260
00:13:43,381 --> 00:13:44,422
No, you don't need to.
You don't need to.

261
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,023
Kate!

262
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,392
Hello, Mr. Lonza.

263
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,927
Kate, do you know these men?

264
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:52,096
No.

265
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:54,031
Not exactly.

266
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:56,267
I think it's time
you made some new friends.

267
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,668
I have all the friends
I need.

268
00:13:57,735 --> 00:14:00,704
You never know.
Let's take a ride,

269
00:14:00,772 --> 00:14:02,573
get acquainted.

270
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,576
I don't like to go out in rain.

271
00:14:05,643 --> 00:14:07,578
Well, you're gonna have
to get over that.

272
00:14:07,645 --> 00:14:09,513
- Hey. Hey!
- Wait.

273
00:14:09,581 --> 00:14:10,514
No! No, wait!
Let me...

274
00:14:10,582 --> 00:14:11,515
- Aah!
- No!

275
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:14,685
No, wait!

276
00:14:14,752 --> 00:14:15,752
Trust me.

277
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:16,854
We're your only way out.

278
00:14:16,921 --> 00:14:17,888
Get off me!

279
00:14:17,956 --> 00:14:20,123
Niko, please. Go with them.

280
00:14:20,191 --> 00:14:21,891
They want to help.

281
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:25,561
Who are you?

282
00:14:27,331 --> 00:14:29,232
Who are you?!

283
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,833
No!

284
00:14:45,202 --> 00:14:46,636
Morning.

285
00:14:46,703 --> 00:14:47,803
You cleaned up.

286
00:14:47,871 --> 00:14:49,638
And you put a roof
over my head.

287
00:14:52,408 --> 00:14:53,608
Hangover?

288
00:14:53,676 --> 00:14:57,145
Got just the thing.
You like eggs?

289
00:14:57,213 --> 00:14:58,346
Hot sauce?

290
00:14:58,414 --> 00:15:01,283
Orange juice? Molasses?

291
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:02,884
Sounds delicious.

292
00:15:02,951 --> 00:15:04,286
I call it
the Redwater special.

293
00:15:04,353 --> 00:15:05,553
After your hometown.

294
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:07,955
No, 'cause it looks like
red water.

295
00:15:09,357 --> 00:15:11,125
Straight from the mighty banks
of the Mississippi

296
00:15:11,193 --> 00:15:14,162
to cure what ails you.

297
00:15:14,229 --> 00:15:15,830
Down the hatch?

298
00:15:17,332 --> 00:15:19,067
I should get that.

299
00:15:25,673 --> 00:15:27,473
Where's Maggie Ryan?

300
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:30,177
Depends.
Can I help you?

301
00:15:30,244 --> 00:15:34,081
I'm the super. You responsible
for last night's little shindig?

302
00:15:34,148 --> 00:15:35,849
That also depends.

303
00:15:35,917 --> 00:15:37,016
On what?

304
00:15:37,084 --> 00:15:38,984
On how mad you are
about it.

305
00:15:45,358 --> 00:15:46,658
You living here?

306
00:15:46,727 --> 00:15:49,161
No. Yes. No.
Well, temporarily.

307
00:15:49,229 --> 00:15:50,629
Uh, at least
it was temporary,

308
00:15:50,697 --> 00:15:53,564
but it's actually been
working out very well, so...

309
00:15:53,632 --> 00:15:55,600
And who is he?

310
00:15:55,667 --> 00:15:59,104
Joe? Um, he's a guest.

311
00:15:59,171 --> 00:16:00,105
Your guest?

312
00:16:00,172 --> 00:16:01,606
Sort of.

313
00:16:01,673 --> 00:16:03,374
Kick him out.

314
00:16:03,442 --> 00:16:04,375
- Excuse me?
- You're not on the lease,

315
00:16:04,443 --> 00:16:06,945
and I don't like
your guest.

316
00:16:07,012 --> 00:16:09,247
Kick him out,

317
00:16:09,314 --> 00:16:13,417
or I kick you out,
and no more parties.

318
00:16:13,485 --> 00:16:15,353
You understand?

319
00:16:17,822 --> 00:16:20,157
I'll ask him to leave.

320
00:16:28,499 --> 00:16:30,032
You're not gonna drink that,
are you?

321
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,736
I'm not that hungry.

322
00:16:34,472 --> 00:16:37,106
What time is your train?

323
00:16:37,174 --> 00:16:38,375
Not until 6:00.

324
00:16:38,442 --> 00:16:40,543
What do you say
we go buy your ticket

325
00:16:40,611 --> 00:16:42,711
and then wander the city
a little?

326
00:16:42,779 --> 00:16:45,614
Oh, you don't need to do
that for me.

327
00:16:45,682 --> 00:16:48,450
Listen, I know you were trying
to avoid me last night...

328
00:16:48,518 --> 00:16:49,585
Avoid? No.

329
00:16:49,653 --> 00:16:53,722
And I deserve it
for what I did on the plane.

330
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:56,892
I was a little drunk,

331
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,727
and I forgot,

332
00:16:59,795 --> 00:17:02,229
for a moment,

333
00:17:02,298 --> 00:17:04,332
how things are.

334
00:17:08,737 --> 00:17:11,071
Joe, I would...

335
00:17:11,139 --> 00:17:13,807
I would really like
to spend the day with you.

336
00:17:15,476 --> 00:17:17,344
I'd like that, too.

337
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:28,689
Coffee, please.

338
00:17:30,757 --> 00:17:32,525
I've been here 45 minutes.

339
00:17:32,592 --> 00:17:34,259
I've had a busy morning.

340
00:17:34,328 --> 00:17:35,761
I can't always drop everything
when you call.

341
00:17:35,829 --> 00:17:37,296
Well, you managed
to rustle a lynch mob

342
00:17:37,364 --> 00:17:38,631
last night when I called.

343
00:17:38,699 --> 00:17:40,999
He's safe. You did your job.
What's the emergency?

344
00:17:41,067 --> 00:17:42,167
Why didn't you tell me

345
00:17:42,235 --> 00:17:44,269
that you were pulling him
out of my apartment?

346
00:17:44,338 --> 00:17:46,471
Have you forgotten the concept
of "need to know"?

347
00:17:46,539 --> 00:17:49,307
I could have talked him
into a meeting.

348
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:52,210
Turning a diplomat is
a delicate procedure.

349
00:17:52,277 --> 00:17:54,546
Yes, you were real delicate
last night.

350
00:17:54,613 --> 00:17:56,314
The last thing I need is
your personal attachment

351
00:17:56,382 --> 00:17:57,315
complicating matters.

352
00:17:57,383 --> 00:17:58,883
My personal attachment?

353
00:17:58,951 --> 00:18:02,886
The only shot you have at this
is my personal attachment.

354
00:18:02,954 --> 00:18:06,122
No. We have more than that.

355
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:07,558
What?

356
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:09,226
Don't you have
an around-the-world flight

357
00:18:09,293 --> 00:18:10,728
coming up?

358
00:18:10,795 --> 00:18:12,896
Go. Enjoy yourself.

359
00:18:12,964 --> 00:18:15,298
Richard, I want to see him.

360
00:18:15,367 --> 00:18:18,368
- You've done your part.
- Forget about Niko Lonza.

361
00:18:18,435 --> 00:18:19,902
We've got it from here.

362
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:22,405
- Richard, no. No, no.
- Take me with you.

363
00:18:22,473 --> 00:18:23,906
I need to explain my side
of things.

364
00:18:23,974 --> 00:18:26,075
- No, you don't.
- Please. I can help.

365
00:18:26,142 --> 00:18:28,143
Richard, I need to talk
to him!

366
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:32,214
"Under the yum yum tree."

367
00:18:32,282 --> 00:18:33,415
No.

368
00:18:33,483 --> 00:18:34,483
You don't even know
what it's about.

369
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:36,251
I know what it's called.

370
00:18:36,318 --> 00:18:37,919
Well, are you sure you want
to see a movie?

371
00:18:37,987 --> 00:18:40,221
Uh, we could go to central park,
the statue of liberty.

372
00:18:40,289 --> 00:18:43,392
My mama would call you happy
as a dead pig in the sun.

373
00:18:43,459 --> 00:18:45,360
- That's not very nice.
- It means you don't know any better

374
00:18:45,428 --> 00:18:47,529
than to smile.
It's a good thing.

375
00:18:47,597 --> 00:18:49,764
I tell you what.
Why don't you wait here?

376
00:18:49,831 --> 00:18:51,399
I'll go grab my ticket,
and then we'll see

377
00:18:51,466 --> 00:18:52,500
the tasty tree movie.

378
00:18:52,567 --> 00:18:53,501
"Yum yum."

379
00:18:53,568 --> 00:18:55,469
Don't remind me.

380
00:19:07,448 --> 00:19:09,181
You're beautiful,
you know that?

381
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,551
Thank you.

382
00:19:11,619 --> 00:19:13,586
$19, sir.

383
00:19:15,656 --> 00:19:17,424
What do you say
I buy you lunch?

384
00:19:21,594 --> 00:19:23,194
Um, I'm fine. Thank you.

385
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:27,633
Oh, come on.
I'm a nice guy.

386
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,068
Laura, let's go.

387
00:19:30,136 --> 00:19:33,071
Now what makes you think you can
order a lady around like that?

388
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:34,573
Oh, h-he wasn't ordering me.

389
00:19:34,641 --> 00:19:35,574
It's okay, Laura.

390
00:19:35,642 --> 00:19:39,777
No, it's not okay. This...

391
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:42,847
This is not okay at all.

392
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:44,348
Come on.

393
00:19:46,217 --> 00:19:47,151
Joe. Joe!

394
00:19:47,218 --> 00:19:48,120
Joe! Joe!

395
00:19:49,297 --> 00:19:50,764
Yes, Crown Heights. I got it.

396
00:19:51,932 --> 00:19:53,333
Richard, is he all right?

397
00:20:02,942 --> 00:20:04,936
- Oh, thank goodness you're home.
- Oh, my God.

398
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:06,379
I-I... we...
we were a few blocks away,

399
00:20:06,446 --> 00:20:08,214
and I didn't know where else to go.

400
00:20:08,281 --> 00:20:10,148
- What happened?
- For the record,

401
00:20:10,216 --> 00:20:11,883
a couple of them look
worse than me.

402
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:15,220
Them? You got in a fight
with multiple people?

403
00:20:15,287 --> 00:20:17,055
It's all my fault.

404
00:20:17,123 --> 00:20:20,058
Stop that. It's only mostly
your fault.

405
00:20:21,127 --> 00:20:22,727
Kate.

406
00:20:22,794 --> 00:20:25,730
I don't have any bandages
or tincture of iodine.

407
00:20:25,797 --> 00:20:27,498
Can you run to the drugstore?

408
00:20:27,565 --> 00:20:30,534
- No.
- Laura, I have to go.

409
00:20:30,601 --> 00:20:31,535
Go where?

410
00:20:31,602 --> 00:20:34,071
I'm sorry.

411
00:20:34,139 --> 00:20:37,742
- I'm sorry.
- I'll explain later.

412
00:20:45,482 --> 00:20:46,416
Ohh!

413
00:20:51,821 --> 00:20:54,823
Unh. Right there.
Unh. Lookin' at you.

414
00:20:54,891 --> 00:20:55,891
Where is he?

415
00:20:55,959 --> 00:20:56,892
Ohh.
Ohh.

416
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,326
Oh, yeah, baby.

417
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:06,401
What the hell is going on
out there?

418
00:21:06,469 --> 00:21:07,702
I don't even want to know.

419
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:09,237
Oh, it is nothing.

420
00:21:09,305 --> 00:21:12,374
Kate's taking off her clothes
to entertain the men.

421
00:21:12,442 --> 00:21:13,575
And why would she do that?

422
00:21:13,642 --> 00:21:16,444
Feeling patriotic, I guess.

423
00:21:16,511 --> 00:21:18,079
What does a guy gotta do

424
00:21:18,146 --> 00:21:20,714
to get a decent cup
of coffee around here?

425
00:21:20,782 --> 00:21:22,383
- Oh, but it's just...
- Oh, don't bother, Colette.

426
00:21:22,451 --> 00:21:24,051
- I'll get my own.
- Okay.

427
00:21:26,121 --> 00:21:27,221
I like coffee, too.

428
00:21:27,289 --> 00:21:28,889
Mm.

429
00:21:30,624 --> 00:21:32,559
Sure. Yeah.
Run along, boys.

430
00:21:32,626 --> 00:21:35,895
I'll stay, fly the plane.

431
00:21:35,963 --> 00:21:37,564
Oh, no need to be jealous.

432
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:39,065
I said Kate was taking
her clothes off,

433
00:21:39,133 --> 00:21:41,401
but I didn't say
who was putting them on.

434
00:21:41,469 --> 00:21:43,603
- Ohh.  Sailors.
- Mm-hmm.

435
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:46,238
Uh, if you want a quick look,
I'd be happy to take over.

436
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:49,408
No, thank you. I'm...
I'm happy right where I am.

437
00:21:49,476 --> 00:21:53,945
Too bad. It's always been
a dream of mine to fly.

438
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,857
Excuse me,
first officer Valois,

439
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:08,493
could you please take
your seat?

440
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:10,861
Mm.

441
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:20,137
You know, there's actually
some gray area here.

442
00:22:20,204 --> 00:22:22,405
Uh, the... the singing guardians
of democracy back there

443
00:22:22,473 --> 00:22:26,109
are not technically
paying passengers...

444
00:22:26,177 --> 00:22:27,677
And they're sworn to protect

445
00:22:27,745 --> 00:22:30,046
<i>your</i> right to the pursuit
of happiness.

446
00:22:30,114 --> 00:22:32,682
Oh, this would make me
very happy.

447
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:33,883
Yeah?

448
00:22:33,951 --> 00:22:35,184
Yeah.

449
00:22:37,954 --> 00:22:41,790
Uh, both hands on the yoke.

450
00:22:41,858 --> 00:22:42,891
The yoke?

451
00:22:42,959 --> 00:22:45,060
Yeah, the steering wheel.

452
00:22:45,128 --> 00:22:49,498
Roger that, captain.

453
00:22:55,904 --> 00:22:57,138
Mm.

454
00:23:00,742 --> 00:23:02,177
I'm flying?

455
00:23:02,244 --> 00:23:05,913
And a dream comes true.

456
00:23:09,917 --> 00:23:13,520
I'm flying.

457
00:23:16,924 --> 00:23:18,858
Guys, guys. Hey.

458
00:23:18,926 --> 00:23:20,360
Oh.

459
00:23:20,428 --> 00:23:24,730
Ensign will finely is gonna
get himself married.

460
00:23:27,201 --> 00:23:28,401
To Will!

461
00:23:28,468 --> 00:23:30,869
My mama always says,
you carry your first impression

462
00:23:30,937 --> 00:23:33,539
of a person
for the rest of your days.

463
00:23:33,607 --> 00:23:36,375
It becomes a part of you,
like...

464
00:23:36,443 --> 00:23:38,276
A photograph in your pocket...

465
00:23:40,246 --> 00:23:42,214
Which is why I deeply regret,

466
00:23:42,281 --> 00:23:45,817
the first time I met
Will Finely, he had dysentery.

467
00:23:47,386 --> 00:23:50,355
Aw, Will!

468
00:23:50,423 --> 00:23:51,656
Now that's
a hell of a photograph

469
00:23:51,724 --> 00:23:53,091
to be stuck with forever.

470
00:23:56,127 --> 00:23:58,229
To Will.

471
00:23:58,296 --> 00:23:59,963
To Will.

472
00:24:03,235 --> 00:24:05,502
You're missing
a pretty good speech.

473
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:07,504
Uh, you could use
a lecture.

474
00:24:07,572 --> 00:24:11,006
Oh, you're a lifesaver.
I am starving.

475
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:14,844
What?

476
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:16,713
Nude photographs?

477
00:24:18,115 --> 00:24:19,882
I don't plan on showing anyone.

478
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:22,518
Doesn't matter. They exist.

479
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:23,753
Do you have the negatives?

480
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,521
I thought you, of all people,
would understand.

481
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:27,222
Have you not read
the Pan Am code of ethics?

482
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:29,190
And every practical reason
aside,

483
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:30,692
you're not the kind of girl
who does that.

484
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,893
Well, I must be,
because I did,

485
00:24:31,961 --> 00:24:34,363
and I'm not going
to apologize for it.

486
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:35,731
And quite frankly,

487
00:24:35,798 --> 00:24:38,667
that sounds like something
mother would say.

488
00:24:40,102 --> 00:24:42,570
Nude photos it is.

489
00:24:43,772 --> 00:24:45,706
What's going on, Kate?

490
00:24:45,774 --> 00:24:47,475
For a while you seemed
so happy,

491
00:24:47,542 --> 00:24:50,978
but lately you're...

492
00:24:51,045 --> 00:24:53,481
On edge.

493
00:24:53,548 --> 00:24:55,816
Boy trouble.

494
00:24:55,884 --> 00:24:57,752
Since when have you had
a boy?

495
00:25:00,388 --> 00:25:01,821
Since Monte Carlo.

496
00:25:01,889 --> 00:25:03,156
No. No.

497
00:25:03,223 --> 00:25:04,424
The one you stole from Maggie?

498
00:25:04,492 --> 00:25:05,558
Please.

499
00:25:05,626 --> 00:25:06,626
Maggie never stood
a chance.

500
00:25:07,695 --> 00:25:09,195
Wh-what's he like?

501
00:25:09,263 --> 00:25:15,634
He's sweet
and funny, kind and...

502
00:25:15,702 --> 00:25:17,135
He's noble.

503
00:25:17,203 --> 00:25:20,306
Oh, my God.
You're in love.

504
00:25:20,373 --> 00:25:25,010
I'm in over my head
is what I am.

505
00:25:26,579 --> 00:25:28,180
My boyfriend's
a Yugoslavian communist.

506
00:25:28,247 --> 00:25:29,515
He's a communist?

507
00:25:29,582 --> 00:25:30,548
Now who sounds like mother?

508
00:25:30,616 --> 00:25:33,017
You're right.

509
00:25:33,084 --> 00:25:34,652
Who cares?

510
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,820
The free world.

511
00:25:35,887 --> 00:25:37,855
But you're in love.

512
00:25:37,923 --> 00:25:40,558
Nothing else matters.

513
00:25:40,626 --> 00:25:42,660
Hey, don't let that go.

514
00:25:44,095 --> 00:25:45,530
It's complicated.

515
00:25:45,597 --> 00:25:46,864
No, it's simple.

516
00:25:46,932 --> 00:25:50,634
It's a dime, a phone booth,
and a handful of words.

517
00:25:50,702 --> 00:25:52,970
Call him
as soon as we touch down,

518
00:25:53,038 --> 00:25:56,073
and tell him that
love trumps everything.

519
00:25:56,141 --> 00:25:57,341
I-I can't.
No arguing.

520
00:25:57,408 --> 00:26:00,044
Laura.
Kate, no arguing.

521
00:26:09,386 --> 00:26:10,987
Apparently
your personal attachment

522
00:26:11,055 --> 00:26:12,989
is stronger
than we thought.

523
00:26:15,226 --> 00:26:17,660
He won't talk any more
until he sees you.

524
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:18,794
You have him here?

525
00:26:18,862 --> 00:26:20,662
We use an insurance office
as a front.

526
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:22,331
It actually turns a profit.

527
00:26:22,398 --> 00:26:24,499
Be careful.
It's not going well.

528
00:26:24,567 --> 00:26:26,634
What a surprise.

529
00:26:31,085 --> 00:26:33,053
He's through here.

530
00:26:47,701 --> 00:26:50,803
I don't suppose you could
offer me any privacy?

531
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:54,807
I can offer you this...
He's angry, you're angry,

532
00:26:54,874 --> 00:26:57,210
but what he wants
for his country

533
00:26:57,277 --> 00:27:00,978
and what we want from him
do, indeed, run parallel.

534
00:27:01,046 --> 00:27:03,248
You need to make him
believe that.

535
00:27:06,352 --> 00:27:08,320
Kate.

536
00:27:08,387 --> 00:27:10,388
I've misled you.

537
00:27:10,456 --> 00:27:14,825
I've withheld from you,
but I haven't lied to you.

538
00:27:31,908 --> 00:27:34,277
Is Kate your real name?

539
00:27:38,081 --> 00:27:39,482
Yes.

540
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:41,317
Is anything else
about you real?

541
00:27:42,386 --> 00:27:45,020
I started as a courier.

542
00:27:47,022 --> 00:27:48,957
This is beyond anything
that I ever thought

543
00:27:49,024 --> 00:27:50,525
that I would be doing
for them.

544
00:27:50,593 --> 00:27:51,960
Oh, clearly they can
spot talent.

545
00:27:52,027 --> 00:27:53,295
You had me convinced.

546
00:27:53,363 --> 00:27:55,631
Niko, you and I...

547
00:27:55,698 --> 00:27:57,633
That part was real.

548
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:02,803
<i>Niko, are you in danger?</i>

549
00:28:02,871 --> 00:28:06,140
<i>Tito has put</i>
<i>an entire nation in danger.</i>

550
00:28:06,207 --> 00:28:09,143
<i>"Chief architect</i>
<i>of the second Yugoslavia,"</i>

551
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:11,879
<i>and yet his dreams are not</i>
<i>for his people.</i>

552
00:28:14,716 --> 00:28:16,651
<i>I was going</i>
<i>to try to help my cousin.</i>

553
00:28:16,718 --> 00:28:18,818
<i>This might be the last time</i>
<i>I'll ever see him again.</i>

554
00:28:18,886 --> 00:28:21,154
<i>Niko?</i>

555
00:28:24,057 --> 00:28:27,327
<i>My mind is full</i>
<i>of you, too.</i>

556
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,400
Very convincing.

557
00:28:36,569 --> 00:28:37,836
I meant it.

558
00:28:37,904 --> 00:28:38,837
But it wasn't just
between us.

559
00:28:38,905 --> 00:28:40,005
I didn't know.

560
00:28:40,072 --> 00:28:41,440
Did you record everything?

561
00:28:41,508 --> 00:28:42,874
<i>I didn't know.</i>

562
00:28:42,942 --> 00:28:46,312
Congratulations.
You are now a professional.

563
00:28:48,682 --> 00:28:50,148
Don't be cruel.

564
00:28:50,216 --> 00:28:55,886
My new friends here... they have
a terrific proposition.

565
00:28:55,954 --> 00:28:59,290
I return back to Yugoslavia
as a double agent

566
00:28:59,358 --> 00:29:02,126
or explain this tape,

567
00:29:02,194 --> 00:29:04,128
made in the bed
of an American agent,

568
00:29:04,196 --> 00:29:06,863
to our secret police.

569
00:29:09,867 --> 00:29:11,868
But I thought...

570
00:29:13,538 --> 00:29:17,974
I thought when they told me
that they wanted you to help us

571
00:29:18,042 --> 00:29:23,078
that that meant that
you would stay in New York...

572
00:29:23,146 --> 00:29:25,448
At your current job.

573
00:29:25,515 --> 00:29:26,449
Doing what?!

574
00:29:26,516 --> 00:29:28,751
Passing information,
but here,

575
00:29:28,819 --> 00:29:30,753
where you could be
protected!

576
00:29:30,821 --> 00:29:34,156
No, sweetheart, it means
being sent back to spy

577
00:29:34,224 --> 00:29:37,727
on a government that... that is
already suspicious of me.

578
00:29:37,794 --> 00:29:39,994
I'm so sorry.

579
00:29:40,062 --> 00:29:43,097
I thought I was helping.

580
00:29:43,165 --> 00:29:44,566
This is helping?

581
00:29:44,633 --> 00:29:47,068
I thought you meant the things
that you said on that tape,

582
00:29:47,135 --> 00:29:51,406
that you wished your country had
the same freedoms as America.

583
00:29:51,474 --> 00:29:53,007
Well, it's still my country!

584
00:29:53,075 --> 00:29:56,344
And it needs to change.
You believe that!

585
00:29:57,579 --> 00:30:00,848
If you could work...

586
00:30:00,916 --> 00:30:04,886
If you could work with us...

587
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:13,793
This is not "working with."
This is a death sentence.

588
00:30:21,769 --> 00:30:23,569
Niko.

589
00:30:23,637 --> 00:30:27,373
Niko, please.

590
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,208
Hear them out.

591
00:30:31,111 --> 00:30:34,713
I do not like
what they've done,

592
00:30:34,781 --> 00:30:38,884
but I believe that
you want the same...

593
00:30:38,952 --> 00:30:41,486
things.

594
00:30:43,722 --> 00:30:46,324
I-I honestly can't tell.

595
00:30:46,392 --> 00:30:50,661
Are you... are you just
a silly, naive girl or...

596
00:30:50,729 --> 00:30:54,232
Or... or a master liar?

597
00:30:56,068 --> 00:30:58,903
Both.

598
00:31:01,739 --> 00:31:03,240
I'm both...

599
00:31:06,277 --> 00:31:09,746
But I am also yours.

600
00:31:17,087 --> 00:31:18,520
This is getting out of hand.

601
00:31:18,588 --> 00:31:20,522
It's like feeding time
at the zoo.

602
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:22,658
Can you imagine being trapped
underwater with them

603
00:31:22,725 --> 00:31:24,026
for six months?

604
00:31:24,094 --> 00:31:27,196
I'd load myself into
a torpedo tube and launch.

605
00:31:27,264 --> 00:31:29,265
That bad?

606
00:31:29,333 --> 00:31:31,099
My kingdom for a sedative.

607
00:31:31,167 --> 00:31:32,434
How snockered are they?

608
00:31:32,501 --> 00:31:33,835
What are you thinking?

609
00:31:33,902 --> 00:31:34,869
Nifty little pilot trick.

610
00:31:34,937 --> 00:31:36,371
I'm gonna decrease
the cabin pressure

611
00:31:36,439 --> 00:31:38,840
by manually raising
the cabin altitude.

612
00:31:38,907 --> 00:31:41,609
I love Greek.
Beautiful language.

613
00:31:41,677 --> 00:31:44,145
It makes boozy passengers
fall asleep.

614
00:31:44,213 --> 00:31:45,546
You're kidding.
Oh.

615
00:31:45,614 --> 00:31:47,647
No. That's why test pilots
don't drink on game day.

616
00:31:47,715 --> 00:31:49,816
Pilots and their secrets.

617
00:31:49,884 --> 00:31:53,720
Well, what are you
waiting for?

618
00:31:53,788 --> 00:31:55,990
Joe, we're asking everybody
to return to their seats.

619
00:31:56,057 --> 00:31:58,492
Is it okay
if I stay back here?

620
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:01,028
Sure, as long
as you buckle up.

621
00:32:02,097 --> 00:32:03,496
Still unsettled?

622
00:32:03,563 --> 00:32:05,331
You could say that.

623
00:32:05,399 --> 00:32:08,968
- I liked your toast.
- Where's the wedding?

624
00:32:09,036 --> 00:32:10,136
Alabama.

625
00:32:10,204 --> 00:32:12,671
Oh, that's convenient.
Right on the way home.

626
00:32:12,739 --> 00:32:13,873
Yes, it is.

627
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,375
Is it a church wedding?

628
00:32:15,442 --> 00:32:18,044
It's a... country club.

629
00:32:18,112 --> 00:32:19,478
Well, that will be nice.

630
00:32:19,545 --> 00:32:22,381
<i>Exclusive</i> country club.

631
00:32:22,448 --> 00:32:24,516
Oh.

632
00:32:24,583 --> 00:32:27,352
But thanks to you,
I've got a secret weapon.

633
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:31,890
Gonna close my eyes and pretend
my ass right into the front row.

634
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:35,493
Upset all those old ladies.

635
00:32:36,761 --> 00:32:38,029
Get those fans going.

636
00:32:39,764 --> 00:32:41,965
I, um...
I should probably take

637
00:32:42,034 --> 00:32:43,800
the bottle
before Maggie catches you.

638
00:32:43,868 --> 00:32:46,370
It's against the rules.

639
00:32:55,046 --> 00:32:58,948
I need to, uh, prepare
for landing.

640
00:33:11,032 --> 00:33:12,299
Does it hurt?

641
00:33:12,367 --> 00:33:16,203
You want the truth
or the tough guy answer?

642
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:26,679
I am so sorry.

643
00:33:26,747 --> 00:33:29,982
Hey. It was hardly
a tussle.

644
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:32,118
I knew hittin' the town
with you would draw some eyes.

645
00:33:32,185 --> 00:33:33,720
That's on me.

646
00:33:35,222 --> 00:33:38,258
I'm sorry because...

647
00:33:38,325 --> 00:33:40,992
Because it isn't right.

648
00:33:42,828 --> 00:33:45,930
It isn't right that...

649
00:33:45,998 --> 00:33:48,600
When you tried to kiss me,

650
00:33:48,668 --> 00:33:52,203
I cared what other people
would think.

651
00:33:53,706 --> 00:33:57,275
It isn't right that
when I went to bed last night,

652
00:33:57,342 --> 00:34:00,245
I locked my door.

653
00:34:00,312 --> 00:34:02,613
It isn't right that
when the super told me

654
00:34:02,681 --> 00:34:06,284
to kick you out, I did it.

655
00:34:17,495 --> 00:34:19,296
You took my hand
in front of those men

656
00:34:19,363 --> 00:34:20,931
at the train station...

657
00:34:22,366 --> 00:34:26,303
And you brought me back here
to take care of me.

658
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:28,939
That counts for something.

659
00:34:30,874 --> 00:34:33,643
That mean old man really
told you to kick me out?

660
00:34:33,711 --> 00:34:36,579
Don't worry. I plan
on flooding the bathtub.

661
00:34:36,647 --> 00:34:37,914
Isn't it
Maggie's apartment?

662
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:42,419
Where I work, we call that
a command decision.

663
00:34:46,323 --> 00:34:49,391
Why are you being nice
to me?

664
00:34:49,459 --> 00:34:52,761
Same reason I tried
to kiss you.

665
00:34:52,829 --> 00:34:54,763
Same reason
I told Maggie I had

666
00:34:54,831 --> 00:34:56,532
nowhere else
to stay last night.

667
00:34:56,599 --> 00:34:57,866
That was a lie?

668
00:34:57,934 --> 00:35:00,268
That was a desperate attempt
to keep your company

669
00:35:00,337 --> 00:35:01,670
a little longer.

670
00:35:01,738 --> 00:35:03,171
Why?

671
00:35:03,239 --> 00:35:05,640
You ever been
on a submarine?

672
00:35:07,844 --> 00:35:10,045
There's a lot of gray.

673
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,615
Gray pumps,

674
00:35:14,683 --> 00:35:16,417
gray engines,

675
00:35:16,485 --> 00:35:18,785
gray gauges,

676
00:35:18,854 --> 00:35:20,855
gray steel...

677
00:35:22,858 --> 00:35:28,195
A big gray ocean tryin'
to crush you like a tin can...

678
00:35:31,032 --> 00:35:32,599
So you can imagine
what it's like to come up

679
00:35:32,667 --> 00:35:35,368
from all that gray
and see...

680
00:35:36,971 --> 00:35:38,537
You.

681
00:35:50,816 --> 00:35:54,152
Laura, what are you doing?

682
00:35:56,322 --> 00:35:59,324
Making
another command decision.

683
00:36:19,011 --> 00:36:20,844
Is something funny?

684
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:26,182
You're the guy...

685
00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:35,525
And the next time I have
to close my eyes to feel safe...

686
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,628
I'm gonna pretend
I'm right here.

687
00:36:56,111 --> 00:36:58,512
I remember my first trip
around the world.

688
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:00,548
I took a little spoonful
of dirt

689
00:37:00,615 --> 00:37:04,018
from every place we landed
as a souvenir.

690
00:37:04,086 --> 00:37:05,586
You must be excited.

691
00:37:05,654 --> 00:37:07,288
Beyond.

692
00:37:07,356 --> 00:37:10,324
Oh, I have bills to mail.
I'll be right down.

693
00:37:10,391 --> 00:37:12,826
Okay, make it snappy.
It's time to board.

694
00:37:14,562 --> 00:37:17,297
Kate. Where on Earth
have you been?

695
00:37:17,365 --> 00:37:19,066
I know. I haven't
returned your calls.

696
00:37:19,133 --> 00:37:20,434
Is everything all right?

697
00:37:20,501 --> 00:37:22,169
The way you ran out
on Joe and I...

698
00:37:22,236 --> 00:37:23,337
Kate Cameron? Phone call.

699
00:37:25,606 --> 00:37:27,873
I need to mail these...

700
00:37:27,941 --> 00:37:30,109
Kate speaking.

701
00:37:43,589 --> 00:37:45,756
Kate?
Kate, what is it?

702
00:38:04,342 --> 00:38:07,044
Excuse me. Are you lost?

703
00:38:07,112 --> 00:38:10,747
I, uh, seem
to have found my way.

704
00:38:13,885 --> 00:38:15,584
Which flight is yours?

705
00:38:15,652 --> 00:38:18,488
Pan Am 2.

706
00:38:18,555 --> 00:38:19,922
Around the world.

707
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:23,426
Around the world.
I'd like to do that.

708
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:29,565
Mine is leaving in, um,
two hours.

709
00:38:29,633 --> 00:38:30,698
Flight 22.

710
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:32,634
London.

711
00:38:32,701 --> 00:38:34,269
And then on to Yugoslavia.

712
00:38:38,641 --> 00:38:40,375
I was supposed to be leaving,
uh, two days ago,

713
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:41,643
but then I got delayed.

714
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:44,913
Job interview.

715
00:38:47,482 --> 00:38:49,783
I thought you weren't
interested in a new job.

716
00:38:49,851 --> 00:38:52,019
I didn't care
for the interview.

717
00:38:54,456 --> 00:38:59,460
But then we, uh...
resolved our differences.

718
00:38:59,528 --> 00:39:03,563
There are people...
who need me in Yugoslavia,

719
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:06,232
and it's time.

720
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,801
So this is your choice.

721
00:39:08,869 --> 00:39:12,939
Things rarely happen
the way we expect.

722
00:39:13,006 --> 00:39:15,741
I'm beginning
to understand that.

723
00:39:19,379 --> 00:39:24,149
So you'll... let me know
when you book a return?

724
00:39:24,217 --> 00:39:28,120
It's likely to be
a long trip.

725
00:39:31,191 --> 00:39:33,758
Well, the only thing left
to do is, um,

726
00:39:33,826 --> 00:39:36,427
to say good-bye
to my American girlfriend.

727
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:39,797
She'll be devastated.

728
00:39:39,864 --> 00:39:41,765
At first. Maybe.

729
00:39:41,833 --> 00:39:45,103
But then she'll understand
that I'm doing what I must...

730
00:39:46,905 --> 00:39:50,773
That I'm, uh,
I'm "Walking like a man."

731
00:39:53,111 --> 00:39:54,944
I hope she'll be proud
of me.

732
00:39:55,012 --> 00:39:58,247
She already is.

733
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:08,925
Laura?

734
00:40:08,993 --> 00:40:12,694
Um, you go.

735
00:40:14,964 --> 00:40:17,065
Good-bye, Kate.

736
00:40:18,768 --> 00:40:21,737
Your layover in London...

737
00:40:21,804 --> 00:40:24,673
There's... a great pub
in cadogan square.

738
00:40:26,142 --> 00:40:29,010
Oh, it's a... it's a good spot
for billiards.

739
00:40:29,077 --> 00:40:33,047
I'll...
I'll try to remember that.

740
00:40:38,186 --> 00:40:40,054
Hey, Kate.

741
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:48,895
Me, too.

742
00:41:42,686 --> 00:41:45,087
No plants, no animals, no men.

743
00:41:45,155 --> 00:41:47,223
If I'm gonna be circling
the globe for three weeks,

744
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:50,959
the last thing I need to worry
about is home maintenance.

745
00:41:51,027 --> 00:41:53,996
Who wants economy
with me on the first leg?

746
00:41:54,063 --> 00:41:55,998
Somebody's got to do it.

747
00:41:56,065 --> 00:41:57,499
I'll do it.

748
00:41:59,035 --> 00:42:00,301
Just smile through it,
dear.

749
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:07,341
Oh. Here they come.
Are you ready, Kate?

750
00:42:07,409 --> 00:42:08,543
Mm-hmm.

751
00:42:12,614 --> 00:42:14,281
Welcome to Pan Am.

752
00:42:17,586 --> 00:42:18,619
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

753
00:42:18,687 --> 00:42:19,820
Welcome to Pan Am.
