1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:01,427
I wanna marry you.

2
00:00:01,796 --> 00:00:04,203
<i>Last season on AMC's Mad Men...</i>

3
00:00:04,843 --> 00:00:06,492
Well, ho-ho.
Now it's the time.

4
00:00:06,572 --> 00:00:08,267
Gentlemen, Jai Alai.

5
00:00:08,516 --> 00:00:10,243
I made an appointment with
the divorce attorney.

6
00:00:10,491 --> 00:00:12,323
Forget it. I'm not gonna let
you break up this family.

7
00:00:12,531 --> 00:00:13,724
I didn't break up this family.

8
00:00:14,019 --> 00:00:15,835
P.P.L. is being sold and
us along with it.

9
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:17,539
- Fire us.
- Why would I?

10
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:18,898
We'll make you a partner.

11
00:00:19,044 --> 00:00:20,891
- Who the hell is Henry Francis?
- No one.

12
00:00:23,211 --> 00:00:24,467
You're a whore!

13
00:00:25,556 --> 00:00:26,755
Pete, we're starting a new agency.

14
00:00:26,891 --> 00:00:29,332
We're here to talk to
you about joining us.

15
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:30,859
Henry, I have three children.

16
00:00:31,011 --> 00:00:32,388
I don't want you
owing them anything.

17
00:00:32,707 --> 00:00:34,146
I want you to know that
I'm not gonna fight you.

18
00:00:35,538 --> 00:00:36,987
Thank you. Goodbye.

19
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:38,739
Mommy, she's not Margaret,
she's Jane.

20
00:00:38,938 --> 00:00:39,955
She's my wife.

21
00:00:40,403 --> 00:00:41,681
I need you to find
me an apartment.

22
00:00:42,915 --> 00:00:44,770
Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce,
how may I help you?

00:01:23,614 --> 00:01:25,515
<i>Who is don draper?</i>

25
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:36,798
Excuse me?

26
00:01:36,866 --> 00:01:39,234
Who is don draper?

27
00:01:42,807 --> 00:01:44,974
What do men say
when you ask that?

28
00:01:45,042 --> 00:01:47,211
Well, they usually take
a minute to think about it

29
00:01:47,279 --> 00:01:48,980
Then they do something cute.

30
00:01:49,047 --> 00:01:51,749
One creative director
said he was a lion tamer.

31
00:01:51,817 --> 00:01:54,085
I don't want to do that.

32
00:01:55,654 --> 00:01:58,422
- In the third person?
- I don't know.

33
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:02,125
Knockout wife, two kids,
house in Westchester.

34
00:02:02,192 --> 00:02:04,227
Take the train...
maybe you take your car

35
00:02:04,294 --> 00:02:05,861
Now that you can afford it.

36
00:02:05,929 --> 00:02:08,029
And who told you that?

37
00:02:08,097 --> 00:02:10,231
Anything?

38
00:02:10,299 --> 00:02:12,333
I mean, now's your chance.

39
00:02:14,002 --> 00:02:16,738
Well, as I said before,
I'm from the Midwest.

40
00:02:16,805 --> 00:02:20,642
We were taught that it's not
polite to talk about yourself.

41
00:02:24,113 --> 00:02:28,251
Obviously your glo-coat
floor wax commercials
caused a bit of a squeal,

42
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,153
On the creative side anyway.

43
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,189
What made you think
of this idea?

44
00:02:32,256 --> 00:02:35,159
I wanted it to be
indistinguishable
from the movies.

45
00:02:36,695 --> 00:02:39,163
I wanted people to be
watching it and say,

46
00:02:39,231 --> 00:02:42,067
"what's happening
in the story right now?"

47
00:02:42,135 --> 00:02:44,703
Oh, it's something else.

48
00:02:45,905 --> 00:02:47,340
"It's not an ad."

49
00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:51,877
At least not for
the first 30 seconds of it.

50
00:02:51,945 --> 00:02:54,046
Very good then.

51
00:02:54,114 --> 00:02:55,949
I think I have all I need.

52
00:02:56,016 --> 00:02:58,284
It's only
a few hundred words,
but on the bright side,

53
00:02:58,352 --> 00:03:00,187
The picture may be
bigger than the article.

54
00:03:00,255 --> 00:03:02,189
Oh, uh, you all should meet.

55
00:03:02,257 --> 00:03:04,558
This is Jack Hammond
from "advertising age."

56
00:03:04,626 --> 00:03:06,394
Roger sterling
and Pete Campbell.

57
00:03:06,462 --> 00:03:08,129
I hope we're not
interrupting this crisp

58
00:03:08,197 --> 00:03:09,731
And engaging portrait
you're painting.

59
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:11,599
Ahh...

60
00:03:11,667 --> 00:03:14,003
Steady there.

61
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:19,909
- What happened there?
- Korea.

62
00:03:19,977 --> 00:03:22,445
We're grateful
for your sacrifice.

63
00:03:22,513 --> 00:03:24,414
- Peter.
- Jack.

64
00:03:24,481 --> 00:03:26,549
Well, it's nice
to meet you all.

65
00:03:26,617 --> 00:03:30,219
I'd love to bend your ear
when I finish my book.

66
00:03:30,287 --> 00:03:32,121
Certainly.

67
00:03:32,188 --> 00:03:33,756
Don, it was a pleasure.

68
00:03:33,824 --> 00:03:35,691
- I look forward to the article.
- We all do.

69
00:03:41,999 --> 00:03:44,467
My Uncle lost his leg
hitching a trailer.

70
00:03:44,535 --> 00:03:47,070
Used to ask me
to scratch his toes.

71
00:03:47,137 --> 00:03:49,705
- He didn't have any.
- We don't have time, Roger.

72
00:03:49,773 --> 00:03:52,041
One quick pop, Louise.

73
00:03:52,109 --> 00:03:54,476
All right, where is this party?

74
00:03:54,544 --> 00:03:57,679
- The Sheraton?
- A wooden leg...

75
00:03:57,747 --> 00:04:00,849
They're so cheap they can't
even afford a whole reporter.

76
00:04:04,954 --> 00:04:07,656
I'm Peter Campbell
and I'm assuming you're Jim.

77
00:04:07,723 --> 00:04:10,959
- And this must be Murray.
- Bob... Murray stayed
in Portland.

78
00:04:11,026 --> 00:04:13,395
Too bad.
Missing jackhammer season.

79
00:04:13,463 --> 00:04:14,796
Roger sterling.

80
00:04:16,599 --> 00:04:19,134
- And you must be
Donald draper.
- Don.

81
00:04:19,202 --> 00:04:20,669
Bob.

82
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,173
We're very very excited you
had time to meet with us, don.

83
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,478
Murray told us y&r
had done glo-coat.

84
00:04:29,545 --> 00:04:32,547
Turns out
everybody in New York
except him knows it's you.

85
00:04:32,615 --> 00:04:34,683
And I think they're
a little jealous.

86
00:04:36,185 --> 00:04:38,019
Can't tell who
the client is here.

87
00:04:39,822 --> 00:04:42,222
I know a little,
but what we need to know...

88
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:44,591
What don needs to know is

89
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:46,826
What exactly is your concern?

90
00:04:46,894 --> 00:04:49,295
I must say I'm getting
tired of saying this today.

91
00:04:49,363 --> 00:04:50,963
Next time just have
one meeting.

92
00:04:52,933 --> 00:04:55,935
We at Jantzen have had
a steady 25% bite
of the apple.

93
00:04:56,003 --> 00:04:58,704
But the two-piece
is most of our concern.

94
00:04:58,772 --> 00:05:02,174
You have a great bikini.
I've spent some time
with the catalogue

95
00:05:02,242 --> 00:05:04,710
And I would say
no concerns at all.

96
00:05:04,778 --> 00:05:07,047
It's not a bikini.

97
00:05:07,115 --> 00:05:09,683
A bikini is underwear
you wear to the beach.

98
00:05:09,751 --> 00:05:12,119
We make a two-piece
bathing suit.

99
00:05:13,789 --> 00:05:15,489
We're a family company.

100
00:05:15,557 --> 00:05:17,925
And nowadays it's tough
to make a dent

101
00:05:17,993 --> 00:05:20,428
If your ads don't look
like a girlie magazine.

102
00:05:20,496 --> 00:05:24,132
Do you want women who want
bikinis to buy your two-piece

103
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,801
Or do you just want to make sure
women who want a two-piece

104
00:05:26,869 --> 00:05:28,502
Don't suddenly buy a bikini?

105
00:05:32,574 --> 00:05:35,910
My lord.
That question just tied
a knot in my brain.

106
00:05:37,946 --> 00:05:39,647
Our competitors get bigger

107
00:05:39,715 --> 00:05:41,482
The smaller they make
that swimsuit.

108
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:44,819
We don't do that.

109
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:47,321
We would like to find a way
without playing in the gutter.

110
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:49,190
And that's just who
our customers are.

111
00:05:49,258 --> 00:05:51,092
Right now.

112
00:05:53,362 --> 00:05:56,030
I love how they sit there
like a couple of choirboys.

113
00:05:56,098 --> 00:05:58,533
You know one of them's
leaving New York with v.D.

114
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:02,170
Where the hell have you been?

115
00:06:02,238 --> 00:06:04,072
- What's the problem?
- Don!

116
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:06,641
- Can you give me a minute?
- I don't mind waiting.

117
00:06:16,819 --> 00:06:18,987
- How'd it go?
- Get back to work.

118
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:33,067
How was your interview?

119
00:06:33,135 --> 00:06:35,669
Count to 100 and buzz me.

120
00:06:41,241 --> 00:06:43,509
You missed Jeff Atherton.

121
00:06:43,577 --> 00:06:46,711
He came here expressly
to see you.

122
00:06:46,779 --> 00:06:49,847
I'm sorry, I didn't know
he was coming and I don't
know who that is.

123
00:06:49,915 --> 00:06:53,517
You have no idea how tiny
this place looks to a stranger.

124
00:06:53,584 --> 00:06:55,218
Did you tell him about
the second floor?

125
00:06:55,285 --> 00:06:58,521
I refuse to be any part
of that charade.

126
00:06:59,756 --> 00:07:01,690
I wanted an office downtown.

127
00:07:01,758 --> 00:07:04,526
We overspent.
We could have got
a lot more for our money.

128
00:07:04,594 --> 00:07:06,194
And we could have had
a conference table.

129
00:07:06,262 --> 00:07:08,563
Atherton thought the lack
of a conference table

130
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:11,065
Was deliberate.
He felt that a...

131
00:07:11,132 --> 00:07:15,301
Circle of chairs
demands a conversation.

132
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:17,336
About why there is no table.

133
00:07:20,873 --> 00:07:22,673
they loved you.

134
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,175
What exactly is the problem?

135
00:07:25,243 --> 00:07:27,577
Well, first of all
they're prudes.

136
00:07:27,645 --> 00:07:30,380
Second of all
y&r were standing in
the hallway when we left.

137
00:07:30,447 --> 00:07:32,381
You've been on
a cattle call before.

138
00:07:32,449 --> 00:07:34,049
When the competition was fair.

139
00:07:34,117 --> 00:07:36,784
Every hour of my time
has to be accounted for

140
00:07:36,852 --> 00:07:38,686
In the growth of this company.

141
00:07:38,753 --> 00:07:41,021
Get me in a room
where I have a chance.

142
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:46,060
In the end it's going to come
down to big versus small.

143
00:07:46,127 --> 00:07:48,696
There's two firms
Kenyon & Eckhardt,

144
00:07:48,763 --> 00:07:50,931
And D'Arcy.
They'll cancel
each other out.

145
00:07:50,999 --> 00:07:53,567
<i>Y&r has six floors
of creative.</i>

146
00:07:53,635 --> 00:07:55,836
They can throw bodies
at this account for weeks.

147
00:07:55,904 --> 00:07:58,939
- We don't have
that kind of firepower.
- We don't have to.

148
00:07:59,007 --> 00:08:01,509
We're the scrappy upstart.

149
00:08:01,576 --> 00:08:03,644
You don't say that
to the clients, do you?

150
00:08:03,712 --> 00:08:05,579
<i>Your accountant is waiting.</i>

151
00:08:05,647 --> 00:08:07,515
Send him in.

152
00:08:07,582 --> 00:08:11,085
Creatively, y&r is not capable
of living in this neighborhood.

153
00:08:11,153 --> 00:08:13,253
You know why?

154
00:08:13,321 --> 00:08:16,089
Because you don't work there.

155
00:08:22,429 --> 00:08:25,998
- John.
- Marsha.

156
00:08:27,334 --> 00:08:29,635
- John.
- Marsha.

157
00:08:29,703 --> 00:08:33,506
John!

158
00:08:33,573 --> 00:08:35,642
Happy Thanksgiving.

159
00:08:35,709 --> 00:08:37,911
Oooh, my mother's going
to be over the moon.

160
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:40,447
Enjoy it.
It's the last thing
we're going to get from them.

161
00:08:40,515 --> 00:08:42,783
- What?
- Did you kill sugarberry?

162
00:08:42,851 --> 00:08:46,488
- That's a third of my work.
- Stop jumping to conclusions.

163
00:08:46,556 --> 00:08:49,157
I guess when Kreutzer
said they were going
to send us all hams

164
00:08:49,225 --> 00:08:51,594
He really meant one
in a cardboard box
with no note.

165
00:08:51,661 --> 00:08:53,562
It's about as subtle
as an atomic bomb.

166
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,297
Maybe they're cheap.

167
00:08:55,365 --> 00:08:57,433
Do you honestly think
this is a good sign?

168
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,401
The work was
old-fashioned.

169
00:08:59,469 --> 00:09:01,236
And whose fault is that?

170
00:09:01,304 --> 00:09:04,506
Well, testing at four
supermarkets in queens,

171
00:09:04,574 --> 00:09:07,075
How much were they
spending? Nothing.

172
00:09:07,143 --> 00:09:09,811
If the test was a success,
they would have gone national

173
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:11,612
And they could be
a big account.

174
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,614
Damn it!

175
00:09:13,682 --> 00:09:15,616
I thought we were
getting on a streak.

176
00:09:17,753 --> 00:09:19,920
Does this mean I'm down
to two days a week?

177
00:09:19,988 --> 00:09:22,857
- Don hated the work.
- Put the ham on his desk.

178
00:09:22,925 --> 00:09:25,627
He's probably having
Thanksgiving dinner
alone in there.

179
00:09:25,695 --> 00:09:27,095
That's not nice.

180
00:09:27,163 --> 00:09:29,264
Marsha!

181
00:09:29,331 --> 00:09:30,899
I'm serious.

182
00:09:33,369 --> 00:09:36,171
Okay, life insurance policy,
it's a company policy.

183
00:09:36,238 --> 00:09:38,440
It pays the company,
not the family.

184
00:09:38,508 --> 00:09:40,275
What do you think?

185
00:09:40,343 --> 00:09:43,745
It wouldn't be bad to have
a little security for the kids.

186
00:09:43,813 --> 00:09:46,448
According to this,
I'm already a wealthy man.

187
00:09:46,515 --> 00:09:48,617
Uncle Sam will take
a healthy bite.

188
00:09:48,684 --> 00:09:50,251
He already has.

189
00:09:50,319 --> 00:09:51,819
And...

190
00:09:51,887 --> 00:09:54,489
The only other issue
is the house.

191
00:09:54,556 --> 00:09:55,957
What about it?

192
00:09:56,025 --> 00:09:59,594
Well, October 1st
she was supposed to be out.

193
00:09:59,662 --> 00:10:02,997
It seemed so far away
when we agreed to that.

194
00:10:03,065 --> 00:10:07,001
Get her and him out of there
and sell it.

195
00:10:07,069 --> 00:10:10,538
I can call Ben Michaelson
and have him draft a doozy.

196
00:10:11,707 --> 00:10:13,407
Start world war III?

197
00:10:13,475 --> 00:10:15,343
You're carrying a mortgage,

198
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:17,479
Plus insurance and taxes

199
00:10:17,546 --> 00:10:19,581
For a house you don't live in.

200
00:10:20,917 --> 00:10:22,851
Leave it alone.

201
00:10:24,921 --> 00:10:27,456
So how are your balls?
Are you enjoying yourself?

202
00:10:27,524 --> 00:10:30,225
Come on.

203
00:10:30,293 --> 00:10:32,661
I don't want it like this.
I want it like that.

204
00:10:32,729 --> 00:10:35,131
Not too much of that,
just a little like this.

205
00:10:35,199 --> 00:10:38,001
And then they look at it
and they don't like it.

206
00:10:38,069 --> 00:10:42,073
Two of their test markets
are in Jewish neighborhoods.
They're idiots.

207
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:45,410
How much does it cost for us
to buy all the product?

208
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:48,280
Too much and we'd have
to do it every day.

209
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:53,486
So how much does it cost
for us to get

210
00:10:53,553 --> 00:10:56,455
100 women to line up
at one store, one afternoon,

211
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:58,490
Clean them out once?

212
00:10:58,558 --> 00:11:01,226
100 people?
Do you know how big
a line that is?

213
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:03,027
People would talk about it.

214
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:05,496
- It's a p.R. Stunt.
- We don't do that.

215
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:08,165
- Why not?
- Because you can't
charge for it.

216
00:11:08,233 --> 00:11:10,935
So what?

217
00:11:11,002 --> 00:11:15,006
Two women
fighting over one ham,

218
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:16,842
But they have to really fight.

219
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,844
They have to get arrested
or something.

220
00:11:18,912 --> 00:11:20,379
Because it's the last ham.

221
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:22,815
We don't have to write a play.

222
00:11:22,883 --> 00:11:25,586
It's Thanksgiving.
They're shopping.
The stakes are very high.

223
00:11:25,653 --> 00:11:27,554
Old Chuck Dewey could
probably get a story

224
00:11:27,622 --> 00:11:29,656
In the "daily news"
for a case of something.

225
00:11:29,724 --> 00:11:32,927
$25 per actress.
We could get Gladys
what's-her-name.

226
00:11:32,995 --> 00:11:35,664
Who's the old lady who never
takes off her mittens?

227
00:11:35,732 --> 00:11:38,266
- I don't have any money.
- John!

228
00:11:38,334 --> 00:11:40,101
Marsha!

229
00:11:40,169 --> 00:11:42,737
I can use my expense account
if I say they're whores.

230
00:11:42,804 --> 00:11:44,971
Top-shelf liquor,
what's that gonna run?

231
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:46,940
Harry gets a case a month

232
00:11:47,007 --> 00:11:49,075
For sticking his nose
up some guy's ass at n.B.C.

233
00:11:49,143 --> 00:11:51,610
Should I run it by don?

234
00:11:51,678 --> 00:11:52,979
Really?

235
00:11:55,015 --> 00:11:57,850
We'll see.
I'll call casting.

236
00:12:04,024 --> 00:12:06,192
Oh, good, I got you
when you're vulnerable.

237
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:13,265
- What do you need?
- Someone white to carve
our Turkey.

238
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,901
I can't, Roger.
I have plans.

239
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:19,138
You told me that.
Then you told me you had
the kids the day after.

240
00:12:19,206 --> 00:12:22,575
But you never said no
to Jane's friend Bethany.

241
00:12:22,643 --> 00:12:25,412
- No.
- I was thinking
the other day

242
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:28,114
About what happens
when you leave here
and it made me very upset.

243
00:12:28,182 --> 00:12:30,216
I could say the same thing.

244
00:12:30,284 --> 00:12:32,685
I'll paint you the picture
that's in my mind.

245
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:34,787
But if it's true,
I might kill myself.

246
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:36,957
I've hardly been a monk.

247
00:12:37,024 --> 00:12:39,459
Forget that she knows Jane.

248
00:12:39,526 --> 00:12:42,128
This girl's terrific.
She looks like Virginia Mayo.

249
00:12:42,196 --> 00:12:44,898
She's 25, mount Holyoke
gymnastics team.

250
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:47,267
See her this weekend.

251
00:12:47,335 --> 00:12:50,003
You hit it off,
come Turkey day maybe
you can stuff her.

252
00:12:57,045 --> 00:12:59,346
Sweetheart,
8:00 Saturday night,

253
00:12:59,414 --> 00:13:01,648
Jimmy's la grange
for beauty and the beast.

254
00:13:01,716 --> 00:13:03,985
- Roger.
- They have chicken Kiev.

255
00:13:04,052 --> 00:13:06,420
The butter squirts everywhere.

256
00:13:18,001 --> 00:13:20,569
- Hello, Mr. Draper.
- Hello, Celia.

257
00:13:27,376 --> 00:13:30,678
I made you some pork chops.
They're good cold too.

258
00:13:30,746 --> 00:13:33,047
I look forward to it.

259
00:13:33,114 --> 00:13:35,749
But you don't eat nothing.

260
00:13:38,118 --> 00:13:41,020
- Have you seen my shine Kit?
- I put it on the top
of the closet.

261
00:13:41,088 --> 00:13:43,222
<i>- the children coming
this weekend?</i>

262
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,990
No.

263
00:13:45,058 --> 00:13:48,227
You need to put things
back where you found them.

264
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:50,896
I didn't want to leave it
in the middle of the floor.

265
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,612
Okay, good night.
You have a good weekend.

266
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,648
And eat something.

267
00:14:37,874 --> 00:14:40,509
Let me out of here!

268
00:14:40,576 --> 00:14:43,711
Let me out of here!

269
00:14:45,047 --> 00:14:47,848
<i>Let me out of here!</i>

270
00:14:49,917 --> 00:14:52,052
Footprints on a wet floor...

271
00:14:52,119 --> 00:14:54,221
That's no longer
a hanging offense.

272
00:14:54,288 --> 00:14:57,223
<i>Glo-coat's
patented formula</i>

273
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:59,759
<i>Goes on easy
and dries in seconds.</i>

274
00:16:03,751 --> 00:16:06,318
So how do you know Jane?

275
00:16:06,386 --> 00:16:09,789
Before you ask me all
the questions, you have
to let me finish one glass.

276
00:16:11,524 --> 00:16:13,726
<i>I don't have to ask you
any questions.</i>

277
00:16:15,461 --> 00:16:17,662
I think I'm actually nervous.

278
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:20,230
I haven't done this
since college.

279
00:16:20,298 --> 00:16:23,233
Not that it was so long ago,
although it seems like it.

280
00:16:23,301 --> 00:16:25,435
I borrowed a dress.

281
00:16:25,503 --> 00:16:28,204
You sat down so fast
I didn't get a good look.

282
00:16:28,272 --> 00:16:29,639
Do you want to see it?

283
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:46,789
I can't believe I did that.

284
00:16:48,892 --> 00:16:51,160
It's hard to believe
there are two girls
who can wear that.

285
00:16:53,197 --> 00:16:55,732
Don, I want to lift
a shadow off this evening.

286
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:58,534
I know this is your first date.

287
00:16:58,602 --> 00:17:00,603
First that Roger
was involved in.

288
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:03,172
Oh, of course.
I'm sure. It's just...

289
00:17:05,509 --> 00:17:08,411
I'm breaking
a lot of my rules
seeing a divorced man.

290
00:17:10,113 --> 00:17:13,182
But Jane has made you
her personal cause.

291
00:17:14,984 --> 00:17:18,119
And there are so many
real problems in the world.

292
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:21,289
I know.

293
00:17:21,357 --> 00:17:23,758
The world is so dark right now.

294
00:17:23,825 --> 00:17:26,493
The country?

295
00:17:26,561 --> 00:17:30,330
My goodness,
you've made me feel very
serious all of a sudden.

296
00:17:32,467 --> 00:17:34,868
I don't know if I can make you
feel better about the world.

297
00:17:34,936 --> 00:17:37,171
One of the boys killed
in Mississippi...

298
00:17:37,239 --> 00:17:40,041
Andrew Goodman,
he was from here.

299
00:17:40,109 --> 00:17:42,578
A girlfriend of mine
knew him from summer camp.

300
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:46,382
Is that what it takes
to change things?

301
00:17:49,487 --> 00:17:51,221
What do you do?

302
00:17:51,289 --> 00:17:53,724
I'm an actress.

303
00:17:53,792 --> 00:17:56,060
But right now I'm a super
in the opera.

304
00:17:56,127 --> 00:17:59,497
- And what is that?
- A supernumerary.

305
00:17:59,565 --> 00:18:02,133
We're the actors
that fill the stage.

306
00:18:02,201 --> 00:18:04,269
Like the chorus?

307
00:18:04,337 --> 00:18:06,204
Mmm, no singing.

308
00:18:06,272 --> 00:18:07,939
I do a lot of mock drinking.

309
00:18:08,007 --> 00:18:10,375
I'm a wench.
I'm a...

310
00:18:10,443 --> 00:18:12,476
Courtesan.

311
00:18:12,544 --> 00:18:15,814
Part of a harem.
It depends on the opera.

312
00:18:17,283 --> 00:18:19,417
That is truly fascinating.

313
00:18:20,686 --> 00:18:22,688
I love the music.

314
00:18:22,755 --> 00:18:25,624
And I love backstage.

315
00:18:25,692 --> 00:18:28,962
Our costumes are as good
as the singers.

316
00:18:29,029 --> 00:18:31,231
And I love the stories.

317
00:18:31,298 --> 00:18:33,934
They're very romantic.

318
00:18:34,002 --> 00:18:35,836
Have you been?

319
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:37,804
I have.

320
00:18:37,871 --> 00:18:41,573
But only for business
so I've never enjoyed it.

321
00:18:41,641 --> 00:18:44,176
Well, then you must
come as my guest.

322
00:18:46,546 --> 00:18:49,281
They give the supers tickets
instead of paying
a decent wage.

323
00:18:51,384 --> 00:18:52,984
- Madam?
- Oh, I don't even
need to look.

324
00:18:53,052 --> 00:18:54,686
Chicken Kiev.

325
00:18:54,754 --> 00:18:56,421
They make you wear a bib.

326
00:18:56,489 --> 00:18:59,358
Come on, let's have some fun.

327
00:19:00,493 --> 00:19:02,128
Two chicken Kievs.

328
00:19:11,406 --> 00:19:13,075
The barbizon.

329
00:19:13,142 --> 00:19:14,877
I bet that would
make a great opera.

330
00:19:14,944 --> 00:19:17,179
It would.

331
00:19:17,247 --> 00:19:19,848
Well, I guess
this is good night.

332
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:22,385
Okay.

333
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:26,223
Good night.

334
00:19:28,393 --> 00:19:31,395
So am I going to see you
at Roger and Jane's
for Thanksgiving?

335
00:19:33,731 --> 00:19:35,732
It's tempting, but...

336
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:37,867
I have plans.

337
00:19:37,935 --> 00:19:41,136
Oh, I'm sure the holidays
must be very complex.

338
00:19:58,086 --> 00:20:01,855
It may have been awhile
since you've had to pick up
on messages,

339
00:20:01,922 --> 00:20:05,124
But I want to see you again.

340
00:20:05,192 --> 00:20:07,359
How about right now?

341
00:20:07,427 --> 00:20:09,528
I stopped the meter.
We can start it again.

342
00:20:09,595 --> 00:20:11,497
It'll be like
I just picked you up.

343
00:20:11,564 --> 00:20:13,432
Will you please take a weak no?

344
00:20:15,502 --> 00:20:17,737
Let's see where
we are new year's eve.

345
00:20:17,804 --> 00:20:20,873
- If it's meant
to be, it'll keep.
- Let me walk you in.

346
00:20:20,941 --> 00:20:22,709
No.

347
00:20:22,777 --> 00:20:24,945
I know that trick.

348
00:20:48,301 --> 00:20:50,903
Waverly and 6th Avenue.

349
00:20:54,643 --> 00:20:56,911
I think you both really
acquitted yourselves well.

350
00:20:56,979 --> 00:21:00,148
She doesn't know when to stop.
You don't know when to stop.

351
00:21:00,215 --> 00:21:02,884
My objective
was to get the ham.

352
00:21:02,952 --> 00:21:04,619
No one told you to hit me.

353
00:21:04,687 --> 00:21:06,588
That wasn't part of it.

354
00:21:06,655 --> 00:21:09,924
The important thing is that...
oh, here's Mr. Campbell.

355
00:21:12,928 --> 00:21:15,496
I've been assured you ladies
can look for your names

356
00:21:15,564 --> 00:21:18,132
And perhaps your picture
in Monday's "daily news."

357
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,569
- What section?
- It's the "daily news."
it's one big section.

358
00:21:23,238 --> 00:21:26,674
All in all,
not a bad way
to spend a Sunday.

359
00:21:28,711 --> 00:21:31,078
Can you go back to the market
and get me some aspirin?

360
00:21:31,146 --> 00:21:33,947
We probably shouldn't have any
more contact for the time being.

361
00:21:35,817 --> 00:21:37,284
<i>- shall we?</i>

362
00:21:41,988 --> 00:21:43,956
We really appreciate
your talent

363
00:21:44,023 --> 00:21:45,958
And of course, your discretion.

364
00:21:46,025 --> 00:21:47,559
- You hurt me.
- Ow ow ow!

365
00:21:47,627 --> 00:21:49,561
Ladies, ladies, ladies!

366
00:21:49,629 --> 00:21:53,131
- Daisy!
- Walk her to the train.

367
00:21:55,735 --> 00:21:57,036
- Are you okay, dear?
- Yeah.

368
00:21:58,672 --> 00:22:00,540
Let's get you in a cab.

369
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:08,249
- Good morning.
- Welcome back.
How was Los Angeles?

370
00:22:08,317 --> 00:22:09,984
Very hard to leave.

371
00:22:10,052 --> 00:22:12,887
I would love a vacation.

372
00:22:12,955 --> 00:22:14,690
It wasn't a vacation.

373
00:22:14,757 --> 00:22:16,859
I had a lot of tsuris
with Lucy and Desi.

374
00:22:16,926 --> 00:22:18,861
Has someone been
using my office?

375
00:22:18,928 --> 00:22:20,629
Mr. Sterling doesn't
have a television.

376
00:22:20,697 --> 00:22:22,965
I'm calling
a meeting for 11:00.

377
00:22:23,033 --> 00:22:25,268
No, make it 1:00.
Do we have a table yet?

378
00:22:25,336 --> 00:22:27,504
1:30 and no.

379
00:22:28,739 --> 00:22:31,208
- Hi.
- Yes?

380
00:22:31,275 --> 00:22:33,377
<i>- Do you know where
the seacore rough cut is?
I got it!</i>

381
00:22:36,014 --> 00:22:38,682
Don't you want to know why?

382
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,918
I sold the jai alai TV special.

383
00:22:40,986 --> 00:22:43,154
Really?

384
00:22:43,221 --> 00:22:45,022
A.B.C.
They're moving towards

385
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:47,091
All these eccentric
sporting events... go-karts.

386
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:49,460
Well, that's very exciting.

387
00:22:49,528 --> 00:22:51,529
Can you get someone to track
down a cup of coffee for me?

388
00:22:51,597 --> 00:22:53,665
And I'd love
a grapefruit juice.
And, Joan?

389
00:22:53,732 --> 00:22:57,335
- That is my news.
- I won't even tell people
after it's aired.

390
00:23:02,408 --> 00:23:03,875
Good morning,
Mr. Draper.

391
00:23:05,711 --> 00:23:07,912
Don, can I speak
with you for a minute?

392
00:23:14,953 --> 00:23:17,422
Morning.

393
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:19,891
- Lane, would you
excuse us for a minute?
- Of course.

394
00:23:19,959 --> 00:23:21,793
Good morning, don.

395
00:23:27,267 --> 00:23:29,402
You know,

396
00:23:29,469 --> 00:23:32,005
No one who's ever been
associated with an actual event

397
00:23:32,072 --> 00:23:34,707
Has thought it's been portrayed
honestly in the newspaper.

398
00:23:38,646 --> 00:23:41,014
"Donald draper,
or don as he is known"

399
00:23:41,081 --> 00:23:44,317
Perhaps in an attempt
to appear humble,
is a handsome cipher.

400
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,188
One imagines somewhere
in an attic

401
00:23:48,255 --> 00:23:50,457
"There's a painting of him
that's rapidly aging."

402
00:23:52,026 --> 00:23:54,027
For a guy from "ad age"
he can really write.

403
00:23:54,095 --> 00:23:56,630
- He also says you're married.
- Jesus.

404
00:23:56,698 --> 00:23:59,533
He never asked me that.
Did he check any facts?

405
00:23:59,601 --> 00:24:01,568
You didn't give him any facts.

406
00:24:01,636 --> 00:24:05,272
- He had to make
some assumptions.
- My job is to write ads,

407
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,341
Not go around
talking about who I am.

408
00:24:07,409 --> 00:24:09,443
Who knows who you are?

409
00:24:09,511 --> 00:24:12,547
This was supposed to be
an advertisement for the firm.

410
00:24:12,615 --> 00:24:14,415
Why do you have so many copies?

411
00:24:14,483 --> 00:24:16,350
I bought one to read.

412
00:24:16,418 --> 00:24:19,187
I was going to buy one
to frame in reception,
and then I read it.

413
00:24:19,254 --> 00:24:21,656
I just wanted
to get them all
before anyone else did.

414
00:24:21,723 --> 00:24:23,758
It'll be lining bird cages
by Friday.

415
00:24:23,826 --> 00:24:26,194
This is a missed opportunity.

416
00:24:26,261 --> 00:24:29,130
You turned all the sizzle
from glo-coat into a wet fart.

417
00:24:29,198 --> 00:24:31,365
Plus you sound like a prick.

418
00:24:31,433 --> 00:24:33,434
Well, it's done.

419
00:24:36,404 --> 00:24:38,405
Stay away from
one-legged reporters.

420
00:24:38,473 --> 00:24:40,140
Yeah, I was thinking
about that...

421
00:24:40,208 --> 00:24:42,576
Who is he to criticize anybody?

422
00:24:42,644 --> 00:24:46,647
Just so you
don't kill yourself,
there was some good news.

423
00:24:46,714 --> 00:24:48,649
Jane's friend found
you to be charming.

424
00:24:48,717 --> 00:24:50,484
Although a little
grabby in the car.

425
00:24:50,552 --> 00:24:52,920
That is good news.
Thank you.

426
00:24:52,988 --> 00:24:55,356
She liked you.
Maybe you should have
fondled peg-leg Pete.

427
00:24:55,424 --> 00:24:57,459
They raise you up
and they knock you down.

428
00:24:57,527 --> 00:24:59,894
I don't know what
I could have done differently.

429
00:24:59,962 --> 00:25:02,730
I believe that you were
being modest, but he didn't.

430
00:25:02,798 --> 00:25:05,233
I'm sorry, but after
the year you've had,

431
00:25:05,301 --> 00:25:07,168
It's just not
appropriate anymore.

432
00:25:12,341 --> 00:25:13,908
He's expecting us!

433
00:25:15,477 --> 00:25:18,079
- Is Joey coming?
- I'm here.

434
00:25:18,147 --> 00:25:21,249
- Oh.
- Why can't you come
to our office?

435
00:25:21,317 --> 00:25:24,518
- Do you want to hear what
sugarberry said or not?
- Shoot.

436
00:25:24,586 --> 00:25:27,888
It was uproarious.
First it's Darryl,
and he tells me about

437
00:25:27,956 --> 00:25:31,125
How they stared at
the article all day yesterday
worrying about a lawsuit.

438
00:25:31,192 --> 00:25:33,328
So I hang up and debate
whether or not to tell don...

439
00:25:33,395 --> 00:25:35,730
Throw myself on my sword.
And then Kreutzer calls

440
00:25:35,798 --> 00:25:37,832
<i>To tell me other papers
picked up the story.</i>

441
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:40,034
<i>And I think,
"he knows it's us,"
but how could he?</i>

442
00:25:40,102 --> 00:25:43,571
And he said everyone,
especially Darryl,
was very excited.

443
00:25:46,008 --> 00:25:48,176
He's sorry someone got hurt,

444
00:25:48,244 --> 00:25:50,345
But more people will
taste their ham now

445
00:25:50,413 --> 00:25:52,581
And they'll love it.

446
00:25:52,649 --> 00:25:55,650
It's beautiful.
How do you put something
like this in your book?

447
00:25:55,718 --> 00:25:57,519
You can't.
We can't even
charge them.

448
00:25:57,587 --> 00:25:58,854
It wouldn't be a bad idea

449
00:25:58,922 --> 00:26:00,856
For them to increase
their media budget.

450
00:26:00,923 --> 00:26:03,358
- Seize the moment.
- With more crappy ads?

451
00:26:03,426 --> 00:26:05,593
- Hopefully not.
- You use it.

452
00:26:05,661 --> 00:26:09,430
The winner of
the ham battle is you.

453
00:26:09,498 --> 00:26:12,032
Can you imagine?
Lane's dentures would
drop out of his head

454
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,701
If we came in
with an additional buy.

455
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:19,273
"our hams are worth
fighting for."

456
00:26:21,476 --> 00:26:25,780
A cartoon pilgrim and an Indian
in a tug of war with the ham.

457
00:26:25,847 --> 00:26:28,649
Old ladies will smile.

458
00:26:28,717 --> 00:26:31,518
Why didn't you pitch
that two months ago?
It's good on its own.

459
00:26:31,586 --> 00:26:33,621
A slogan's nothing
when you have a good idea.

460
00:26:35,223 --> 00:26:37,257
Black crayon.
I need it in an hour.

461
00:26:37,325 --> 00:26:39,159
Chop chop, Joey.

462
00:26:41,429 --> 00:26:43,798
Clara, could you get Darryl
for me at sugarberry?

463
00:26:43,866 --> 00:26:46,834
Tell him it's urgent.
I may need you.

464
00:26:48,737 --> 00:26:50,938
<i>Horace cook, Jr.
It's urgent.</i>

465
00:26:52,174 --> 00:26:54,976
Ho-ho!
How was Tijuana?

466
00:26:55,043 --> 00:26:58,346
I have to say,
it's a very flattering
picture.

467
00:26:58,414 --> 00:27:01,316
And I don't think
I'd mind being
described that way.

468
00:27:01,383 --> 00:27:03,317
Mr. Crane,
you're a salesman.

469
00:27:03,385 --> 00:27:06,187
You do not want to be
known as mysterious.

470
00:27:06,255 --> 00:27:08,122
There'll be
no further discussion.

471
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:10,625
I just got off
the phone with ho-ho.

472
00:27:10,693 --> 00:27:13,127
- Jai alai is leaving.
- What?

473
00:27:13,195 --> 00:27:16,964
- It's over.
- Bullshit. I just sold
a TV special to a.B.C.

474
00:27:17,032 --> 00:27:20,301
Well, apparently don didn't
mention them in the article.

475
00:27:22,104 --> 00:27:24,706
I didn't mention anyone.
That's the reporter's job.

476
00:27:27,676 --> 00:27:30,878
- Spectacular.
- What the hell's ho-ho
doing reading "ad age"?

477
00:27:30,946 --> 00:27:33,314
- Fix it.
- Todd got all the partners

478
00:27:33,382 --> 00:27:36,117
From c.G.C. To call and they
worked him up and down.

479
00:27:36,185 --> 00:27:37,652
They told him
we laugh about him.

480
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,687
I don't!
Get him him on the phone,

481
00:27:39,755 --> 00:27:42,056
Get him in here
or camp out in his driveway.

482
00:27:42,124 --> 00:27:44,926
He hung up on me.

483
00:27:44,993 --> 00:27:47,662
I think he was crying.

484
00:27:49,398 --> 00:27:52,233
How much was left in
ho-ho anyway?

485
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:55,269
We'll survive with jai alai
off our list.

486
00:27:55,336 --> 00:27:57,604
We will survive,
but for how long?

487
00:27:57,672 --> 00:27:59,172
The loss of jai alai

488
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,208
Makes lucky strike
71% of our billings.

489
00:28:02,276 --> 00:28:04,410
It's an untenably
insecure position.

490
00:28:07,481 --> 00:28:10,549
Harry, why don't you call
and pretend like you don't
know any of this.

491
00:28:10,617 --> 00:28:12,951
Give it an hour
so he'll take the call.

492
00:28:13,019 --> 00:28:15,588
I wish we really had
a second floor so I could
jump off it.

493
00:28:24,233 --> 00:28:27,135
I'm going to have to get
you another interview.

494
00:28:27,203 --> 00:28:30,539
"the wall street journal."

495
00:28:30,606 --> 00:28:32,474
And what do I do differently?

496
00:28:32,542 --> 00:28:34,509
I told him the truth.

497
00:28:34,577 --> 00:28:37,312
Who gives a crap
what I say anyway?
My work speaks for me.

498
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:41,150
Turning creative success
into business is your work.

499
00:28:41,217 --> 00:28:43,852
And you've failed.

500
00:28:52,229 --> 00:28:54,297
It'll pass.

501
00:29:02,573 --> 00:29:05,442
- Happy Thanksgiving, everybody.
- Happy Thanksgiving.

502
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,211
We started without you.

503
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:09,680
Oh, grandma Pauline,
I told you mother's
was at noon.

504
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:12,149
- We already ate.
- You're supposed to overeat
on Thanksgiving.

505
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:14,419
Ooh, thank you.

506
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:17,054
Jamie, you'll have something?

507
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:19,790
We missed dessert.

508
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:22,292
You're next to your father.

509
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:25,328
- Put up some coffee, dear.
- Hi, daddy.

510
00:29:25,396 --> 00:29:27,263
Isn't that sweet?

511
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:31,167
We didn't forget you.

512
00:29:34,372 --> 00:29:35,973
- What do you say?
- Thank you.

513
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,708
- Thanks.
- After you eat.

514
00:29:41,213 --> 00:29:43,180
The traffic was simply murder.

515
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:45,883
That's because that's
what's become of this country.

516
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:48,319
Everyone has two
thanksgivings to go to.

517
00:29:48,387 --> 00:29:51,756
Maybe we have twice as much
to be thankful for.

518
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:00,330
Don't you like the food, dear?

519
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:03,066
- No.
- Sally draper, that's rude.

520
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:06,669
- You love cranberry sauce.
- It has seeds in it.

521
00:30:06,737 --> 00:30:09,439
- How about the sweet potato?
- I'm not hungry.

522
00:30:09,506 --> 00:30:12,808
Look, there's marshmallow.

523
00:30:17,514 --> 00:30:18,981
oh lord.

524
00:30:22,553 --> 00:30:25,354
She might have a fever.

525
00:30:25,422 --> 00:30:27,723
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right, dear.

526
00:30:27,791 --> 00:30:31,527
<i>- Isabel, can you bring a rag?
Ow, stop pinching me!</i>

527
00:30:37,534 --> 00:30:40,201
I love sweet potatoes.

528
00:30:44,906 --> 00:30:47,174
<i>- Isabel!

529
00:30:49,244 --> 00:30:51,078
Happy Thanksgiving.

530
00:30:58,019 --> 00:31:00,621
- Do you want a drink?
- I don't have much time.

531
00:31:00,689 --> 00:31:02,857
- I have supper
with my family.
- Oh.

532
00:31:02,925 --> 00:31:05,861
- Of course you do.
- Should I not have
mentioned my family?

533
00:31:05,928 --> 00:31:07,863
I never know how
you're going to react.

534
00:31:07,931 --> 00:31:09,799
No, that's fine.

535
00:31:20,744 --> 00:31:23,613
- Let me take off my brassiere.
- No. In a minute.

536
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:26,248
Stop telling me what to do.
I know what you want.

537
00:31:26,316 --> 00:31:28,851
So do it.

538
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:33,689
Harder.

539
00:31:36,026 --> 00:31:37,359
Again.

540
00:31:49,506 --> 00:31:52,676
Hold on.

541
00:31:57,515 --> 00:31:59,750
Surprise, it's for you.

542
00:32:03,354 --> 00:32:05,589
Why did you answer it?

543
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:07,658
It was the third try.
I couldn't take it.

544
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:14,431
- Hello?
- Happy Thanksgiving.

545
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:16,600
Happy Thanksgiving.

546
00:32:16,668 --> 00:32:19,603
I'm sorry to bother you.
I didn't know you'd have guests.

547
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:21,838
What's wrong?

548
00:32:21,906 --> 00:32:25,141
I need $280 for bail.

549
00:32:25,208 --> 00:32:28,010
Bye.

550
00:32:28,078 --> 00:32:31,213
- Where are you?
- It... it's not for me.

551
00:32:35,518 --> 00:32:38,086
Spit it out, honey.

552
00:32:38,153 --> 00:32:41,022
You're going to laugh.

553
00:32:42,591 --> 00:32:44,591
Pete and I hired some actresses

554
00:32:44,659 --> 00:32:47,794
To get in a fight
over a sugarberry ham.

555
00:32:47,861 --> 00:32:50,029
<i>You know, as a stunt.</i>

556
00:32:50,097 --> 00:32:52,431
We got them to increase
their media budget.

557
00:32:54,001 --> 00:32:55,635
Hello?

558
00:32:55,703 --> 00:32:57,604
I'm here.

559
00:32:57,672 --> 00:33:00,640
Well, one of them pressed
charges against the other

560
00:33:00,708 --> 00:33:02,776
For assault.
It's $80 bail

561
00:33:02,843 --> 00:33:05,078
And $100 apiece to keep
their mouths shut.

562
00:33:05,146 --> 00:33:07,647
And it has to happen today.

563
00:33:07,715 --> 00:33:09,616
Call Pete!

564
00:33:11,186 --> 00:33:12,920
Do you think
you're my first call?

565
00:33:16,824 --> 00:33:19,226
Hello.
I'm so sorry to bother you.

566
00:33:19,294 --> 00:33:21,595
- I oughta let you
Twist in the wind.
- It still worked out.

567
00:33:21,663 --> 00:33:24,132
- You'll be very happy.
- I'm not happy.

568
00:33:24,199 --> 00:33:26,434
And I don't think
it's funny or cute.

569
00:33:26,502 --> 00:33:28,503
You run something
like that by me first.

570
00:33:28,571 --> 00:33:30,672
I would have kept you
from looking like an idiot,

571
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,840
Or worse yet,
making me look like one.
Is that what you want?

572
00:33:34,443 --> 00:33:36,210
You want people to think
we're idiots, Peggy?

573
00:33:36,278 --> 00:33:38,912
Hey, there's no reason
for name-calling.

574
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:41,748
- She's been agonizing.
- Who are you?

575
00:33:41,816 --> 00:33:44,017
I'm her fiance.

576
00:33:44,085 --> 00:33:46,419
Mark, don't.

577
00:33:46,487 --> 00:33:49,489
Why'd you bring him
up here if you didn't
want him involved?

578
00:33:49,556 --> 00:33:53,326
I know.
I'm sorry, don.

579
00:33:57,365 --> 00:33:59,500
- Fiance?
- It just came out.

580
00:34:07,076 --> 00:34:10,112
- Did you put the dog out?
- It's cold outside.

581
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:11,881
But I locked her
in the laundry room.

582
00:34:18,221 --> 00:34:20,222
It's not cold in here.

583
00:34:34,536 --> 00:34:36,671
Sally.

584
00:34:36,739 --> 00:34:39,574
I was calling daddy.

585
00:34:39,642 --> 00:34:42,211
Hello?

586
00:34:42,279 --> 00:34:44,581
I wanted to wish him
a happy Thanksgiving.

587
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:46,883
You'll see him tomorrow.

588
00:34:46,951 --> 00:34:49,220
You want to call him
to complain about
how awful I am?

589
00:34:49,287 --> 00:34:52,890
Don't expect any sympathy when
he hears my side of the story.

590
00:34:52,958 --> 00:34:54,725
- Don't!
- Go to bed.

591
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:04,635
I'm going to have them take
that phone out of the hallway.

592
00:35:04,703 --> 00:35:06,270
Mmm.

593
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:16,080
Tomorrow when the kids go,

594
00:35:16,148 --> 00:35:19,283
Why don't we have Carla
take the baby and we'll
drive to a nice dinner?

595
00:35:21,353 --> 00:35:23,121
Maybe Essex.

596
00:35:23,188 --> 00:35:24,922
The Griswold inn.

597
00:35:27,226 --> 00:35:28,593
Okay.

598
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:34,865
I'm really full, Betty.

599
00:35:44,524 --> 00:35:46,158
Daddy!

600
00:35:46,226 --> 00:35:48,094
- Oooh!
- Dad.

601
00:35:51,064 --> 00:35:53,633
- How much Turkey did you eat?
- I ate everything.

602
00:35:53,701 --> 00:35:56,736
hello, daddy.

603
00:35:56,804 --> 00:35:58,705
Hello.

604
00:36:02,211 --> 00:36:04,713
- 9:00 tomorrow night.
- Where's the baby?

605
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:07,249
I had Carla take him.
You weren't going to.

606
00:36:07,317 --> 00:36:09,651
- Henry and I have plans.
- I'd like to see him.

607
00:36:12,322 --> 00:36:14,356
- Hello, don.
- Henry.

608
00:36:14,424 --> 00:36:17,225
Come on, let's go.

609
00:36:34,877 --> 00:36:36,745
Garage door.

610
00:36:41,651 --> 00:36:45,220
- What are you doing?
- You know what I'm doing.

611
00:36:53,361 --> 00:36:56,730
The button fell off my pajamas.

612
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:58,598
I'll sew it on in the morning.

613
00:36:58,666 --> 00:37:00,266
You know how to sew?

614
00:37:00,334 --> 00:37:02,568
I can do a button.
I'll show you.

615
00:37:08,776 --> 00:37:10,310
I'll leave the light on
in the bathroom

616
00:37:10,378 --> 00:37:12,213
So there won't be
any more problems, okay?

617
00:37:12,281 --> 00:37:14,849
- Okay.
- Good night, daddy.

618
00:37:17,019 --> 00:37:18,854
Good night,

619
00:37:18,922 --> 00:37:20,790
Both of you.

620
00:38:02,232 --> 00:38:04,501
do you have your key?

621
00:38:21,352 --> 00:38:23,787
- Hello?
- Maybe they're asleep.

622
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:27,290
go upstairs.

623
00:38:53,352 --> 00:38:55,453
Let go!

624
00:39:00,292 --> 00:39:02,359
<i>What the hell is the dog
doing in the house?</i>

625
00:39:03,961 --> 00:39:05,595
You run up to bed.
I'll wait.

626
00:39:05,663 --> 00:39:07,698
For what?

627
00:39:07,766 --> 00:39:09,734
Oh.

628
00:39:09,801 --> 00:39:12,103
It's almost 10:00.

629
00:39:12,171 --> 00:39:14,939
- I thought you said 10:00.
- She didn't.

630
00:39:15,007 --> 00:39:16,641
I've waited for you
plenty of times.

631
00:39:16,709 --> 00:39:19,577
Henry, do you mind?

632
00:39:19,645 --> 00:39:22,714
- Betty?
- It's okay.

633
00:39:22,782 --> 00:39:24,583
Does that mean I should stay
or not stay?

634
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:25,918
Stay.

635
00:39:29,756 --> 00:39:31,990
When are you moving out?

636
00:39:32,058 --> 00:39:33,992
I don't know.

637
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:35,561
You were supposed
to be out a month ago.

638
00:39:35,628 --> 00:39:38,564
We haven't found the right
place for the kids.

639
00:39:38,632 --> 00:39:41,868
Well, either do as we agreed
or I'm going to need
to collect rent.

640
00:39:41,936 --> 00:39:45,138
- What?
- Or you could just buy it
from me if you want to.

641
00:39:45,206 --> 00:39:47,007
I can't believe you.

642
00:39:47,074 --> 00:39:49,609
Don, it's temporary.

643
00:39:49,677 --> 00:39:53,179
Believe me, Henry,
everybody thinks this
is temporary.

644
00:39:53,247 --> 00:39:55,514
Good night.

645
00:40:00,786 --> 00:40:03,188
He has some nerve.

646
00:40:03,255 --> 00:40:05,690
I know you don't want
to hear this,

647
00:40:05,757 --> 00:40:08,225
But he's right.

648
00:40:08,293 --> 00:40:11,228
Haven't the kids been
through enough change
already?

649
00:40:11,295 --> 00:40:13,964
I can't just uproot them
with no place to go.

650
00:40:14,031 --> 00:40:16,432
You're not even looking.

651
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,901
There's nothing out there,
and he doesn't decide.

652
00:40:29,545 --> 00:40:31,947
<i>- miss Olson is here
to see you.</i>

653
00:40:37,154 --> 00:40:39,056
Send her in.

654
00:40:44,663 --> 00:40:46,397
They sent one for each of us.

655
00:40:48,634 --> 00:40:50,868
Could have just as easily
fired us.

656
00:40:50,936 --> 00:40:54,106
But they didn't
because they sold
more hams.

657
00:40:54,173 --> 00:40:57,143
And now you get
to tell them why,
if you want.

658
00:40:57,210 --> 00:40:58,477
I think they'll be impressed.

659
00:41:00,514 --> 00:41:01,614
Well, I'm not.

660
00:41:03,685 --> 00:41:06,019
I try and stay away from
these kinds of shenanigans.

661
00:41:06,087 --> 00:41:08,388
But I guess you knew that
or you would have told me.

662
00:41:08,455 --> 00:41:12,024
It was going great
until it wasn't.

663
00:41:12,092 --> 00:41:14,427
Thanks for the ham.

664
00:41:16,129 --> 00:41:17,863
I should have told you.

665
00:41:20,099 --> 00:41:22,200
Since when do you
have a fiance?

666
00:41:22,268 --> 00:41:24,169
I don't.

667
00:41:26,139 --> 00:41:28,507
But you didn't have
to do that that way.

668
00:41:28,574 --> 00:41:31,477
You brought him with you
because you thought I
wouldn't embarrass you.

669
00:41:31,544 --> 00:41:33,312
At least I'm thinking ahead.

670
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:35,949
Doesn't always work, does it?

671
00:41:38,353 --> 00:41:41,722
You need to think
a little bit more about
the image of this agency.

672
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:44,525
Well, nobody knows
about the ham stunt,

673
00:41:44,593 --> 00:41:48,430
So our image remains
pretty much where
you left it.

674
00:41:48,498 --> 00:41:51,700
I won't need you in
the Jantzen presentation.

675
00:41:51,768 --> 00:41:54,569
- Now you're being spiteful.
- No.

676
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:57,205
I just think it would
be better not to have
a girl in the room.

677
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:02,777
You know something?

678
00:42:02,845 --> 00:42:04,679
We are all here because of you.

679
00:42:06,582 --> 00:42:08,850
All we want to do
is please you.

680
00:42:18,459 --> 00:42:20,359
Why don't I put them
in the pantry?

681
00:42:20,427 --> 00:42:22,261
Christmas is around the corner.

682
00:42:22,329 --> 00:42:25,464
<i>Put them in the basement.</i>

683
00:42:25,532 --> 00:42:28,027
Did the children
like their gifts?

684
00:42:28,095 --> 00:42:29,695
They did.

685
00:42:33,066 --> 00:42:36,035
It's nice the holiday is
memorable in some other way.

686
00:42:36,103 --> 00:42:39,205
I'm sorry a little girl
spoiled your Thanksgiving.

687
00:42:39,978 --> 00:42:41,379
Next time I'll tell her
not to get sick.

688
00:42:41,414 --> 00:42:43,531
I've raised children
in my life, Henry.

689
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:45,900
They're terrified of her.

690
00:42:45,968 --> 00:42:48,302
You don't know
any of the people
you're talking about.

691
00:42:48,370 --> 00:42:50,304
Well, I know
what you see in her.

692
00:42:50,372 --> 00:42:53,241
And you could have gotten it
without marrying.

693
00:42:53,308 --> 00:42:55,810
Why can't you
give her a chance?

694
00:42:55,877 --> 00:42:59,580
- She loves you.
- She's a silly woman.

695
00:42:59,648 --> 00:43:01,782
Honestly, Henry,

696
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:04,385
I don't know how you can stand
living in that man's dirt.

697
00:43:13,328 --> 00:43:15,596
<i>You go to the swimming pool,
you go to the beach,</i>

698
00:43:15,664 --> 00:43:17,932
<i>Take off your robe,
you head into the cabana.</i>

699
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,142
<i>There's no other way
to slice it, you're
getting undressed.</i>

700
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:23,886
Can I put my feet on this?

701
00:43:24,177 --> 00:43:25,298
- Pretend like
it's your living room.
- Thank you.

702
00:43:26,867 --> 00:43:30,203
What separates a bathing suit
from underwear?

703
00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:32,739
The cut and the print
of the cloth

704
00:43:33,391 --> 00:43:35,255
and some sort of
gentlemen's agreement.

705
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:43,337
"so well built,

706
00:43:43,405 --> 00:43:45,573
We can't show you
the second floor."

707
00:43:54,316 --> 00:43:56,917
I think that's
a little suggestive.

708
00:43:56,985 --> 00:43:59,620
Good. That's what
I was going for.

709
00:43:59,688 --> 00:44:01,956
A wink, but it's not a leer.

710
00:44:02,024 --> 00:44:04,492
We don't want a wink.

711
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:08,029
I think I explained
our product is for
modest people.

712
00:44:08,096 --> 00:44:10,831
Modest people want
to be stimulated too.

713
00:44:10,899 --> 00:44:12,667
This draws them in in a way

714
00:44:12,734 --> 00:44:15,169
That will make your competitors
seem crude and obvious.

715
00:44:15,558 --> 00:44:17,421
Plus they'll be dying
to see the suit.

716
00:44:17,597 --> 00:44:18,852
They'll be dying
to see the girl.

717
00:44:19,085 --> 00:44:21,989
And for all we know
she's not even wearing a top.

718
00:44:22,661 --> 00:44:23,732
You'll get them into the store.

719
00:44:24,982 --> 00:44:25,845
Isn't that the point?

720
00:44:27,061 --> 00:44:28,413
It's not wholesome.

721
00:44:29,205 --> 00:44:32,444
It's not...
did I tell you we're
a family company?

722
00:44:32,781 --> 00:44:33,933
I think I know what
you're looking for.

723
00:44:34,499 --> 00:44:36,967
A couple of women
bouncing a beach ball,

724
00:44:37,035 --> 00:44:39,169
Little girl in front of them
building a sandcastle.

725
00:44:41,205 --> 00:44:43,273
Your competitors are
gonna keep killing you

726
00:44:43,341 --> 00:44:45,275
Because you're too scared
of the skin

727
00:44:45,343 --> 00:44:48,011
That your two-piece
was designed to show off.

728
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:51,548
Well, it's somehow dirtier

729
00:44:51,616 --> 00:44:54,117
Not seeing anything.

730
00:44:54,185 --> 00:44:56,686
You need to decide what kind
of company you want to be...

731
00:44:56,754 --> 00:45:00,690
Comfortable and dead
or risky and possibly rich.

732
00:45:00,758 --> 00:45:02,926
All I know is
we don't want that.

733
00:45:05,096 --> 00:45:07,998
Well, gentlemen,
you were wondering what
a creative agency looks like,

734
00:45:08,066 --> 00:45:10,133
There you have it.

735
00:45:10,201 --> 00:45:12,769
Hope you enjoyed
looking in the window.

736
00:45:12,837 --> 00:45:14,771
Give me a minute.

737
00:45:17,542 --> 00:45:19,509
Where are you going?

738
00:45:19,577 --> 00:45:21,745
Control yourself.

739
00:45:21,813 --> 00:45:24,047
Now cool off.

740
00:45:24,115 --> 00:45:27,451
Hopefully Campbell can talk
them into hearing a few more
ideas in a week or so.

741
00:45:27,518 --> 00:45:29,252
What?
No.

742
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:31,088
That's not the point.

743
00:45:33,257 --> 00:45:34,558
Out.
Get out.

744
00:45:34,625 --> 00:45:36,026
- Don.
- Excuse me?

745
00:45:36,094 --> 00:45:38,361
Get your things and get out
of my office now.

746
00:45:40,031 --> 00:45:41,698
Come on, let's go.

747
00:45:50,108 --> 00:45:52,476
Call Bert Cooper's man
at "the wall street journal."

748
00:46:00,017 --> 00:46:02,052
There's always a name
in every partnership

749
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:03,854
That defines who they are.

750
00:46:03,921 --> 00:46:06,123
In the case of sterling
Cooper draper Pryce

751
00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:08,125
Would you say
that's Donald draper?

752
00:46:08,192 --> 00:46:10,861
Yes.

753
00:46:10,928 --> 00:46:13,063
Really?

754
00:46:13,131 --> 00:46:16,399
Last year our agency
was being swallowed whole.

755
00:46:16,467 --> 00:46:18,869
I realized I had two choices.

756
00:46:18,936 --> 00:46:21,671
I could die of boredom

757
00:46:21,739 --> 00:46:23,573
Or holster up my guns.

758
00:46:25,443 --> 00:46:28,178
So I walked into lane Pryce's
office and I said,

759
00:46:28,246 --> 00:46:29,980
"fire us."

760
00:46:33,718 --> 00:46:37,020
Two days later
we were operating out
of the Pierre hotel.

761
00:46:37,088 --> 00:46:40,557
Within a year we had
taken over two floors
of the time-life building.
