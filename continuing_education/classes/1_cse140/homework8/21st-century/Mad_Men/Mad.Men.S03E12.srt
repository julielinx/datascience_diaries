1
00:00:41,741 --> 00:00:44,608
Mr. Campbell. Mr. Campbell.

2
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:48,209
I got your hot cocoa.

3
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:53,411
Wonderful.

4
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,183
I just got back from lunch,
and Mr. Pryce wants to see you.

5
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:01,426
- It's instant.
- It's from the diner.

6
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:02,989
I don't know how you can tell.

7
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:06,361
You can tell because
they use water instead of milk.

8
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,498
It's warmer outside. It's ridiculous.

9
00:01:11,604 --> 00:01:14,767
The building will take care of it.
They always do.

10
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:19,944
Sorry about that.
This really is hitting the spot.

11
00:01:27,554 --> 00:01:28,748
Come in.

12
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:33,824
Have a seat.

13
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:41,062
I believe I have
what is rather disappointing news.

14
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:43,735
It's been decided that Mr. Cosgrove

15
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:47,398
will be made senior vice president
in charge of account services,

16
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:50,567
and you will be made
head of account management.

17
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:53,801
Really?

18
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:56,711
This is not to ignore
that you've distinguished yourself

19
00:01:56,816 --> 00:01:59,580
and been of great service to the company.

20
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:02,984
What is it based on?
Our billings are neck and neck.

21
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:08,891
In fact, I think I've done a lot with
what I was given in this arbitrary scheme.

22
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:11,191
It's become apparent

23
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:16,660
that you are excellent at making the clients
feel their needs are being met,

24
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:20,003
but Mr. Cosgrove has the rare gift
of making them feel

25
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:22,267
as if they haven't any needs.

26
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:26,876
- I see.
- I improved your title.

27
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:32,145
And you tell your clients
there'll be no need to be deprecating.

28
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:36,018
- Bert and Roger know about this?
- This is under my authority.

29
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:40,419
And I have to commend you
on taking it as well as you have.

30
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:51,661
- I hope this was a difficult decision.
- It was.

31
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,285
There you go.

32
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:22,362
- Where are you going?
- I don't feel well.

33
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:26,235
Why did you pick that place?

34
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:29,638
I don't know why a lunch counter
is any better than eating at your desk.

35
00:03:29,742 --> 00:03:31,642
Well, you could've joined me for a drink.

36
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:34,770
I can drink at my desk if I want to,
and I'm not out $1.25.

37
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:38,544
I'm sorry I'm not as stimulating
a lunch companion as Doug.

38
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:43,521
- It's Duck, and I work most lunches.
- Well, I don't like his aftershave.

39
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:47,017
I can smell it on you, and I can smell it
in the bathroom in the morning.

40
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:48,957
What's wrong with him?

41
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:53,031
Nothing. I don't even know
why I'm weighing in on men right now.

42
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,999
I think it's good
that you're being picky, finally.

43
00:03:56,135 --> 00:03:58,467
Well, there's nothing around
but married ones.

44
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:01,369
I mean, we can't all
throw caution to the wind.

45
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:03,339
But Duck's not married.

46
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:06,335
Then why are you with him?

47
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:14,448
- Well, this is me. You working late tonight?
- I don't know yet.

48
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:16,044
- Okay.
- Bye.

49
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:23,325
Wow. Van Cleef.
How very Jane Siegel-Sterling.

50
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:28,096
- They're blue and they're new.
- She's trying.

51
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:30,869
You always take her side.

52
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,867
I do not.

53
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:37,605
She started giving me advice.

54
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:41,811
"Don't go to bed angry.
Let them do what they want.

55
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:44,115
"Dress sexy. "

56
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:48,481
And all I kept thinking about was Daddy.
It's disgusting.

57
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:53,257
Doesn't she know that?
That she ruined my life?

58
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:57,422
Your father had a part in it.

59
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,891
You don't think I know that?

60
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:06,701
- Brooks is different than your father.
- I don't want to get married.

61
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:13,502
Everything's pointing to the fact
that I shouldn't, and everybody knows.

62
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:19,141
Brooks knows. His mother knows.
Do you know what she said to me?

63
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:25,849
She said in India, if the wedding
doesn't take place at the appointed hour,

64
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,119
they burn the bride.

65
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:32,095
Just because she went to India
doesn't mean she's not an idiot.

66
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:34,791
And Jane. If she's coming,

67
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,937
I'm not going.

68
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:43,703
She's coming, because your father's coming
and he paid for everything.

69
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,745
You're having the wedding.
The bride will not be burned.

70
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:49,246
Turn those earrings
into a tea service or something.

71
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,214
- Aren't you listening to me?
- I am,

72
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:54,081
and you're babbling like a little fool.
Go to your room.

73
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,346
- What?
- You heard me.

74
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:58,856
You want to act like a child,
I'll treat you like one.

75
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:06,765
Would somebody get that?

76
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:15,774
- Hello?
- Daddy?

77
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,643
Are you alone?

78
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:21,144
<i>- Yes, what's wrong?
- Nothing's right.</i>

79
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:25,308
My bridesmaids are supposed to give me
something blue and something new.

80
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:28,216
- Or Mommy. She should know that.
- Who?

81
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:32,722
I don't like her, Daddy, and I've told you
I don't want her to be there.

82
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:37,294
- Honey, put your mother on the phone.
- He wants to talk to you.

83
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:45,964
You have to keep Jane under control.

84
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,233
Well, first of all, tell the bride
that everything is copacetic.

85
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:50,969
We both agree that she's nuts
and she should shut up.

86
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:55,042
Your father said that he's sorry
and that Jane will stay out of your way

87
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:58,117
- and that we're both tired of the drama.
- He said all that?

88
00:06:58,217 --> 00:07:00,447
I'm not playing chicken anymore.
If she wants to cancel the wedding,

89
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:02,350
I'll take the deposit out of her inheritance.

90
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:05,388
- He said the wedding's off.
- Fine.

91
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:09,027
You mean that?
You're not worried about India?

92
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:12,923
- Why are you doing this?
- Do you want to cancel it or not?

93
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:15,993
No.

94
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:19,697
Then go eat something.
I'm not taking that dress in again.

95
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:28,512
Why did Jane get her
such an expensive gift?

96
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:30,882
I didn't even know they saw each other.

97
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:33,551
- Of course you didn't.
- I forbid it.

98
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:37,315
- Can't wait to get her out of here.
- Everything okay?

99
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:40,452
<i>Goodbye.</i>

100
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:43,489
Goodbye.

101
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:47,291
Jane! Get in here, now.

102
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:51,962
- I didn't know you were home.
- I overdid it at lunch,

103
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:53,800
as did you, I heard.

104
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,471
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
I just wanted to make amends.

105
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:58,771
I got her a beautiful present.

106
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:03,008
Why the hell are you even talking to her?
You're screwing things up!

107
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:06,846
I'm tired of the awkwardness,
and I'm trying to be nice.

108
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:10,647
And I don't know
what kind of world you live in,

109
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:13,651
- but I am the good person here.
- You're not good,

110
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,286
because you didn't listen to me
and you really upset her.

111
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,666
Everything you do is for her.

112
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,638
I'm your wife.

113
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:29,738
And guess what?
I live here and I get to do what I want to do,

114
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:32,868
so stop trying to tell me
that you know better.

115
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:40,246
- You'd better not have locked that door.
- Go away!

116
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,117
Or what? You'll commit suicide?

117
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:56,529
- Peter, what are you doing home?
- I got fired.

118
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,672
What happened?

119
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:08,474
Lane told me Kenny is senior something
of something accounts and I'm not.

120
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:11,580
I'm account something.

121
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:17,919
I couldn't even hear him.
All I saw was his frog-like mouth flapping.

122
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:21,759
- So, did he ask you to leave?
- No.

123
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:27,798
I have to ask this,
but did you lose your temper?

124
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,501
No, I didn't.

125
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:34,066
That's good. That's very good.

126
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:40,378
Do you remember if he said anything
about how much they want you to stay?

127
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,814
- No.
- That's good, too. So it didn't come up.

128
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:46,943
Trudy, stop it with the Ellery Queen.

129
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:53,719
- I'm going to call Duck.
- No, you're not.

130
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:56,522
They would have fired you
if they wanted to fire you.

131
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:59,189
You need to wait and see how it goes.

132
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:04,198
He basically said I care too much
about my clients and they notice it.

133
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:06,568
How could that be bad?

134
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:11,305
Peter, you hold all the cards.

135
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,779
It's going to be fine.

136
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:41,034
I thought you'd left.

137
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:43,875
- I'm here.
- I see.

138
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,374
- Well, thank you.
- I've done it before.

139
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,643
Go back to bed.

140
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,793
- Do you want anything?
- No. I'll be in, in a bit.

141
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:21,478
- It's got to be 100 degrees in here.
- You ask the building for heat, you get heat.

142
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:23,913
<i>Mr. Herman on line one.</i>

143
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:29,683
- Hello? Can you give me a minute?
- No.

144
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:33,521
I'm right around the corner
at the Elysée, room 531.

145
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:39,757
- I'm in the middle of something.
- Pee wee, sweetheart, it's been three weeks.

146
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:43,867
You can get room service. I think they have
a Monte Cristo sandwich. You love that.

147
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,538
I'm having lunch with Kurt and Smitty.

148
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:48,970
They're a couple of homos.
Tell them you have plans.

149
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:56,909
- It's kind of short notice.
- Come on, Creative, be creative.

150
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:05,882
I have to go to the printer.

151
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:10,621
- I know a nooner when I hear one.
- You're disgusting.

152
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,892
<i>No, Bob did.</i>

153
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,924
<i>Bob?</i>

154
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:18,460
I was hoping to catch you
on your way to lunch.

155
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:19,799
Too late.

156
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,942
<i>- I must say I'm surprised.
- Frankly, I was a little suspicious...</i>

157
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:29,743
I found out yesterday that head of accounts
is going to Kenny and his haircut.

158
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:31,983
<i>- I heard.
- This is the first time he's invited her here...</i>

159
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:34,609
- Can you turn that off?
- Not really.

160
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:38,620
<i>Did you ask him why he invited her?</i>

161
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:43,127
<i>He said something about not wanting her
to actually have to get involved.</i>

162
00:12:43,662 --> 00:12:46,153
- Were you consulted?
- After the fact.

163
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:52,064
- What does it mean?
- It's not good.

164
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:57,607
I know it's not good.
There's no future for me here.

165
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:03,044
- How did you do it? You made your job up.
- I didn't.

166
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,546
I looked at other agencies
and saw that they had TV departments

167
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:06,811
and wondered why we didn't.

168
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:10,082
Well, there's no such thing
in the accounts field.

169
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:13,154
- There's marketing.
- That's a research job.

170
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:18,027
- Is this official?
- Yes.

171
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:20,691
I'm afraid we can't hire Mr. Charcot.

172
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,963
Well, at least you had the guts
to send me a memo.

173
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:27,334
- He's far too expensive.
- Salvatore Romano is gone.

174
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:29,565
There is no one in charge
of the art department.

175
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:32,200
I haven't heard a complaint
from any of the clients.

176
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:36,680
- Jesus! It's hotter in here than in my office.
- That's because you're overexcited.

177
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:38,977
Do you want me to walk you through
a delivery schedule?

178
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:46,051
<i>This is Walter Cronkite in our newsroom,</i>

179
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:49,591
<i>and there has been an attempt,
as perhaps you know now,</i>

180
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:51,219
<i>on the life of President Kennedy.</i>

181
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:55,892
<i>He was wounded in an automobile driving
from Dallas Airport into downtown Dallas</i>

182
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:58,026
<i>along with Governor Connally of Texas.</i>

183
00:13:58,137 --> 00:14:00,401
<i>They've been taken
to Parkland Hospital there,</i>

184
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,906
<i>where their condition is as yet...</i>

185
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:11,872
My God, how much
have you been smoking in here?

186
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:13,576
Sorry about that.

187
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:23,122
- I'm glad you ran over.
- Me too.

188
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:29,558
I don't understand. I can't run
my department without an art director.

189
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:34,002
- You want to call Saint John?
- Bert Cooper still has a say around here.

190
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:44,982
Hello. What?

191
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:48,351
If they wanted to fire you,
they would've fired you.

192
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:50,183
I'm gonna die at this desk, unnoticed.

193
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:53,622
Do you have any idea
what I've done for this company?

194
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:55,015
- What are you doing?
- Christ!

195
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:56,185
- Somebody shot the president.
- Turn on the TV.

196
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:57,387
What?

197
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,298
<i>...top of the president's car was down.</i>

198
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,561
<i>They drew their pistols,
but the damage was done.</i>

199
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:05,261
<i>- Oh, my God. Unbelievable.
- The president was slumped over</i>

200
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:07,498
<i>in the backseat of the car, face down,</i>

201
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:10,541
<i>then Governor Connally,
after slumping to the left for a moment,</i>

202
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:12,873
<i>lay on the floor of the rear seats.</i>

203
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:14,445
- Oh, my God.
- Dear God.

204
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:15,877
Is he dead?

205
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:30,618
What the hell is going on?

206
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:41,972
<i>Every person listening at this moment
has flashed back to that day in April, 1945,</i>

207
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:45,405

208
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:49,447
<i>Excuse me, Chet, here is a flash
from the Associated Press, dateline Dallas.</i>

209
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:51,812
<i>Two priests
who were with President Kennedy</i>

210
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:54,215
<i>say he is dead of bullet wounds.</i>

211
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:58,413
<i>There is no further confirmation,
but this is what we have on a flash basis...</i>

212
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:01,550
- Is he okay?
- They just said he died.

213
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,594
<i>Two priests in Dallas

214
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:05,994
<i>say he is dead of bullet wounds.</i>

215
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:08,133
<i>- Oh, lord.
- There is no further confirmation.</i>

216
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:13,261
<i>This is the only word we have indicating
the president may, in fact, have lost his life.</i>

217
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:16,830
<i>It has just moved
on the Associated Press wires from Dallas.</i>

218

<i>The two priests were called to the hospital

<i>- and it is from them we get the word...
- I know.</i>

221
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,073
<i>...that the president has died,</i>

222
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:29,154
<i>that the bullet wounds inflicted on him
as he rode in a motorcade</i>

223
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:31,779
<i>through downtown Dallas have been fatal.</i>

224
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:36,953
<i>We would remind you there is no official
confirmation of this from any source as yet.</i>

225
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:39,060
<i>Bill, just moments before
you brought the flash,</i>

226
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,256
<i>I had word from the hospital</i>

227
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:43,858
<i>that the vice president, Lyndon Johnson,
and his wife had just left the hospital,</i>

228
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:45,664
<i>been rushed away into a...</i>

229
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:48,840
Did you give me a hickey?

230
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:52,102
- I don't think so.
- I told you I don't like that.

231
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:55,175
I get questions from my mother.

232
00:16:56,582 --> 00:17:00,712
Listen, there was a news story
that was on right before you came in.

233
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:06,715
- It's been distracting me.
- You didn't seem distracted.

234
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:13,762
- I just want to see what's going on.
- What's going on?

235
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:21,840
<i>Because it was only on October the 24th
that our ambassador to the United Nations,</i>

236
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:26,968
<i>Adlai Stevenson, was assaulted in Dallas
leaving a dinner meeting there.</i>

237
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:33,346
<i>From Dallas, Texas,
the flash, apparently official,</i>

238
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:38,713
<i>President Kennedy died at 1:00 p. m.

- Oh, my God.

241
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,890
<i>...some 38 minutes ago.
- What happened?</i>

242
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:53,332
<i>Vice President Lyndon Johnson
has left the hospital in Dallas.</i>

243
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:54,872
<i>- I've gotta call my kids.
- We do not know</i>

244
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:56,964
<i>to where he has proceeded.</i>

245
00:17:57,142 --> 00:18:00,839
<i>Presumably, he will be taking
the oath of office shortly</i>

246
00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:04,843
<i>and become
the 36th President of the United...</i>

<i>President Johnson is under heavy guard

248

00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:14,253
<i>- President Kennedy, we are now informed...
- It's all ruined.</i>

250
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:17,995
It's gonna be ruined.

251
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:21,623
<i>...five-year-old boy and myself</i>

252
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:25,100
<i>were by ourselves on the grass there
on Palmer Street,</i>

253
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:26,637
<i>- and I asked Joe to wave to him...
- Betts?</i>

254
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:29,605
<i>...and Joe waved and I waved,
and the man...</i>

255
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:33,810
<i>That's all right, sir. Go ahead and tell it.</i>

256
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:39,649
<i>As he was waving back, he was...
The shot rang out, and he slumped down...</i>

257
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:42,720
- Where's your mother?
- She's not feeling well.

258
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:48,951
<i>He was slumping down and the second
shot went off and just knocked him down.</i>

259
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:54,321
<i>- I can't stop crying.
- No, sir, I did not see the man who did it.</i>

260
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:59,496
<i>All I did was look in the man's face
when he was shot there...</i>

261
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:01,869
Why are the kids watching this?

262
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:07,302
What am I supposed to do, Don?
Am I supposed to keep it from them?

263
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,347
<i>...that it hit him and he went
all the way down in the car.</i>

264
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:14,851
Take a pill and lie down.
I can handle the kids.

265
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:18,612
<i>...fell on him in hopes
that there wasn't a maniac around.</i>

266
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:23,525
<i>I'm sorry, I can't help you more,
but I won't forget it.</i>

267
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,264
<i>- Turn this off. I'll make us some dinner.
- A Polaroid picture</i>

268
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:30,199
<i>taken by another witness,
Mary Moorman of Dallas,</i>

269
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:33,271
<i>showing the president
slumped over in the car.</i>

270
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:38,673
<i>Just as Mary started to take the picture,
the president came right even with us,</i>

271
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:42,480
<i>- two shots... We looked at him...
- You two, look at me.</i>

272
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:45,476
<i>Two shots rang out
and he grabbed his chest.</i>

273
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:47,051
Everything's gonna be okay.

274
00:19:47,152 --> 00:19:49,177
<i>...on his face and fell across,
towards Jackie...</i>

275
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:51,882
<i>- We have a new president...
- And she...</i>

276
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:54,285
<i>...and we're all gonna be sad for a little bit.
... fell over on him</i>

277
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:55,690
<i>and said, "My God, he's shot!"</i>

278
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:58,194
And then on Monday
there's gonna be a funeral.

279
00:19:58,297 --> 00:19:59,855
Are we going to the funeral?

280
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:04,095
<i>...more shots rang out, but by that time
the motorcade had sped away.</i>

281
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:07,297
<i>What prompted you to take the picture
at that particular instance?</i>

282
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:09,874
<i>Well, that's the only chance I had.</i>

283
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:13,802
<i>For the nation and the world,</i>

288
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:58,516
<i>He denied he was a communist,
said he was a Marxist,</i>

289
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:02,151
<i>and claimed there was quite a difference
between the two.</i>

290
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:05,023
<i>Police in Dallas have just announced...</i>

291
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:08,927
- You should get ready. It's almost 2:00.
- Really, Don?

292
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:13,767
<i>...has gunpowder traces on both hands,
indicating he'd recently used a rifle,</i>

293
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:16,864
<i>the type of weapon

294
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:19,910
<i>As we told you a short time ago,
Oswald has refused...</i>

295
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:21,639
He's 24 years old.

00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:26,451
<i>In Washington,

<i>lies in the East Room of the White House...</i>

298
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:31,885
<i>- Come on, Betts.
... as official Washington and members of...</i>

299
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:35,756
<i>Are you sure they haven't canceled it?
It said in The Times they were doing that.</i>

300
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:38,421
I'm not gonna call Roger to find out.

301
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:42,029
If we go in and it's off,
we'll grab dinner or something.

302
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,659
<i>...third-floor living quarters
of the White House...</i>

303
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:48,968

- Fine.

304
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:53,706
<i>...ailing Mr. Kennedy stricken by a stroke
two years ago...</i>

305
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:56,042
Just stay here until Carla comes.

306
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:59,640
<i>...greatly, increasingly failing health
for the last...</i>

307
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:04,220
<i>After the terrible news had reached us,</i>

308
00:22:05,857 --> 00:22:08,451
<i>- 60,000 Berliners...

309
00:22:09,027 --> 00:22:13,521
<i>- I don't understand this. Here we are.
... gathered with torches in their hands.</i>

310
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:15,725
Lyndon Johnson, more of the same.

311
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:20,567
Nobody voted for him. It felt for a second
like everything was about to change.

312
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:26,773
You should get your coat and your scarf.
I know it's far, but I really feel like walking.

313
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:28,570
Why are we going?

314
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:30,978
Because it's your boss's
daughter's wedding.

315
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:34,951
It's business, Pete, and there's a system.
You always say that.

316
00:22:35,053 --> 00:22:38,454
It's one thing to go to this wedding
and act like I don't hate them.

317
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:42,960
It's another thing to go and act
like the president hasn't been murdered.

318
00:22:43,328 --> 00:22:46,229
Maybe they'll cancel it,
but we have to show.

319
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:49,662
<i>...in the White House today and tomorrow.</i>

320
00:22:52,437 --> 00:22:56,840
<i>Though it is known
that they have lost their best...</i>

321
00:22:56,942 --> 00:23:00,378
- Have you been drinking?
- The whole country's drinking,

322
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:03,810
and not to celebrate
some spoiled brat's wedding.

323
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:07,649
<i>We are mourning together with his widow...</i>

324
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:10,586
<i>- They'll never cancel. You know why?
... with his children,</i>

325
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:15,386
<i>- his parents, brothers and sisters.
- Because they're happy.</i>

326
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:18,424
You should've heard some of the things
people said yesterday.

327
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,691
Like what? What did they say?

328
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,563
"The man made a lot of enemies,"
things like that.

329
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:29,764
That's awful. I don't care
what your politics are, this is America.

330
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:32,877
You don't just shoot the president.

331
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:34,976
<i>Edwin Walker, who...</i>

332
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,243
Chet Huntley was talking about Jackie
and those kids

333
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,874
and how she'd just lost that baby,

334
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:43,648
and Harry Crane
was looking at his paperwork,

335
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:46,315
calculating how many commercials
weren't going to be aired.

336
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:49,053
<i>...this prepared statement
be handed to newsmen...</i>

337
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:50,628
I'm not going.

338
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:53,996
You can go and say I'm sick,
if you think it's that important.

339
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:57,830
<i>"... demonstrates the internal threat
that can never be underestimated. "</i>

340
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:59,198
No, you're right.

341
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:02,432
<i>"Our sympathy for the Kennedy family
is no less than it is</i>

342
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:05,408
<i>"for the millions of people
who have sustained equal losses</i>

343
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:09,742
<i>"in the fight for freedom. "
Then General Walker's statement went on...</i>

344
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:17,421
I got a call from Leona, this girl
I used to work with at the phone company.

345
00:24:17,522 --> 00:24:20,958
My friend Francine called me.
Don couldn't get through.

346
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,594
Well, the system
was completely overloaded.

347
00:24:23,695 --> 00:24:26,255
It's annoying that people think
the operators were watching TV.

348
00:24:26,364 --> 00:24:28,764
They were as frustrated as anyone.

349
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,730
<i>The maitre d' has reorganized the seating.</i>

350
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:35,500
<i>If you are at an even-numbered table,
take these first six.</i>

351
00:24:35,674 --> 00:24:38,837
<i>If you are at an odd-numbered table,
the left side of the room.</i>

352
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:42,004
Maestro, do you mind? Thank you.

353
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:46,178
<i>Look, everybody, grab your plate
and come on up to the front here.</i>

354
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:47,876
<i>Sit wherever you feel like,</i>

355
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:52,013
<i>and please feel free to have
the prime rib and the fillet of sole.</i>

356
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:55,385
<i>Help yourself.
I mean that. There are no waiters.</i>

357
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:01,763
Three months after Roosevelt died,
we bombed Hiroshima.

358
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:03,767
That's how we got over it.

359
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:08,670
I say we hang Lee Oswald, and then we
take care of Texas. Hell, the whole South.

360
00:25:10,942 --> 00:25:13,740
What did everyone think
of the sweetbreads?

361
00:25:14,312 --> 00:25:16,746
You were right, Mommy. Okay?

362
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:22,753
- Problem solved.
- Hardly.

363
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:27,022
- They just told me the cake's not coming.
- Shit.

364
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,811
Of course.

365
00:25:57,923 --> 00:26:00,289
I have to say, on some level,
Harry has a point.

366
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:04,055
I think he wanted attention.
He obviously didn't fit in.

367
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:06,521
Congratulations.

368
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:09,998
You are so beautiful,
like Natalie Wood or something.

369
00:26:10,535 --> 00:26:14,301
Daddy, I really wish
you could've gotten to see the ceremony.

370
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:17,573
It's okay. We understand.
We're honored you're here.

371
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:21,271
- I heard the church was packed.
- Those weren't our guests.

372
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,345
Have a seat.

373
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:27,312
Just sit anywhere.

374
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:30,049
I'm so happy for you.

375
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:38,195
<i>I would like some legal representation,</i>

376
00:26:38,296 --> 00:26:41,891
<i>but these police officers
have not allowed me to have any.</i>

377
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,691
<i>I don't know what this is all about.</i>

378
00:26:44,836 --> 00:26:46,633
<i>- Did you kill the president?
- No, sir, I didn't.</i>

379
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:49,400
<i>- People keep asking me that. Sir?
- Did you shoot the president?</i>

380
00:26:49,507 --> 00:26:52,499
How would you know
that's what a monster looks like?

381
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:55,341
<i>Naturally, if I work in that building, yes, sir.</i>

382
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,847
<i>Did you see The Times? He lived in Russia.</i>

383
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:00,850
- I thought he just visited.
- Would you visit?

384
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,689
<i>- I'm just a patsy.
- Did you shoot the president?</i>

385
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:10,519
- There you are. What are you doing here?
- They're about to interview Oswald.

386
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:12,487
Hey, somebody go buy a cake.

387
00:27:12,597 --> 00:27:14,929
<i>- Let's keep it quiet and we'll all get it!
- Hold it down.</i>

388
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:17,191
<i>Has the gentleman been identified?</i>

389
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:19,361
<i>Yes, sir, he's been identified
for killing the officer.</i>

390
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:22,235
I need you out there.
I'm about to give my toast.

391
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:26,174
I've heard your toast a million times.
The president is dead.

392
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,969
And I'll tell you something else,
our table has no one at it.

393
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,071
I consolidated the tables.

394
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:35,912
- Would you keep an eye on her?
- Absolutely.

395
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:42,960
We better get back in there.

396
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:44,824
<i>- We want to say this...
- Jane.</i>

397
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:48,057
<i>...that this investigation
has been carried on jointly by...</i>

398
00:27:51,903 --> 00:27:54,531
<i>This toast is going to be much shorter
than it was supposed to be.</i>

399
00:27:54,639 --> 00:27:57,403
<i>Obviously, we're all in a different mood.</i>

400
00:27:58,943 --> 00:28:00,934
<i>Can someone please
get my wife out of the kitchen?</i>

401
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:05,244
<i>I have something very nice to say about her.
But while we're alone...</i>

402
00:28:07,485 --> 00:28:10,454
<i>I want to say something nice
about my ex-wife.</i>

403
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:13,386
<i>Mona, you're a lioness.</i>

404
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:18,326
<i>And thank you for resisting
the urge to eat your cub.</i>

405
00:28:20,565 --> 00:28:22,863
<i>This could've been an awful day,</i>

406
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:28,470
<i>but here we are, not watching TV,
but together watching the two of you.</i>

407
00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:33,374
<i>To Margaret and Brooks Hargrove.</i>

408
00:28:37,348 --> 00:28:40,215
<i>The adults,
we all wanted to be strong for you,</i>

409
00:28:40,318 --> 00:28:44,015
<i>but your spirit, your love,
your hope is giving us strength.</i>

410
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:48,854
<i>And I promise you now,
if you can make it through a day like today,</i>

411
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,825
<i>marriage is a cakewalk.</i>

412
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:53,355
<i>To many years of happiness.</i>

413
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:55,057
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

414
00:28:57,502 --> 00:29:01,495
<i>We invite the father of the bride
and the bride to share the dance floor.</i>

415
00:29:01,606 --> 00:29:03,198
Sorry about that.

416
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,937
<i>Now, if there are any other
fathers and daughters...</i>

417
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:13,108
<i>You know what?
Everyone, please join them.</i>

418
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:24,027
- Do you want to dance?
- I don't know.

419
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:40,942
- Want me to teach him how to dance?
- He's a great dancer.

420
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,349
She's happy.

421
00:29:48,553 --> 00:29:52,421
That's because she doesn't know
his net worth just dropped by half.

422
00:29:52,524 --> 00:29:54,014
Stop it, Daddy.

423
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:05,760
Hey.

424
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,867
Everything's gonna be fine.

425
00:30:13,678 --> 00:30:15,441
How do you know that?

426
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:35,329
You'll see.

427
00:30:47,745 --> 00:30:50,339
Why do you keep looking at that woman?

428
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:53,675
What are you talking about?

429
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:23,204
- Are you ready?
- Did Jennifer fall in?

430
00:31:23,314 --> 00:31:26,283
- She'll be right out.
- See you Tuesday.

431
00:31:38,696 --> 00:31:43,224
He was so handsome,
and now I'll never get to vote for him.

432
00:32:04,222 --> 00:32:05,246
Hey.

433
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:09,455
You want me to cut you out of that dress?

434
00:32:14,632 --> 00:32:16,566
I'm making a phone call.

435
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:34,145
- Hello?
- So what's new?

436
00:32:36,921 --> 00:32:39,617
- It's incredible, isn't it?
- Yes.

437
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:42,917
Margaret got married today.

438
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:46,920
That's right, I forgot. Poor thing.

439
00:32:48,232 --> 00:32:53,033
Joanie, I wish you could've seen it.
Oh, my God, what a disaster.

440
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:54,601
I'm sorry.

441
00:32:55,406 --> 00:32:59,035
She pulled through.
They pulled through. I pulled through.

442
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:05,749
I can't believe how quiet it is out there.

443
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:10,310
Not everywhere. Greg just called.
He's working the night shift at the ER.

444
00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:13,784
<i>People are still getting sick.</i>

445
00:33:13,891 --> 00:33:17,793
Car accidents are happening.
Babies are being born.

446
00:33:18,796 --> 00:33:22,527
Well, I'm glad he's not home.
I had to talk to you.

447
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:30,403
Nobody else is saying
the right thing about this.

448
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:32,733
My God, you're really upset.

449
00:33:33,911 --> 00:33:35,538
What's that about?

450
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:39,743
Because there's nothing funny about this.

451
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:49,660
Well, hang in there, red.

452
00:33:50,428 --> 00:33:51,622
You too.

453
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:56,325
<i>- Bye-bye.
- Goodbye.</i>

454
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:08,479
<i>Put him on a standby
of indeterminate length, will you?</i>

455
00:34:10,114 --> 00:34:12,105
<i>Let me have it. I want it.</i>

456
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:15,949
<i>Being led out by Captain Fritz.</i>

457
00:34:16,921 --> 00:34:20,948
<i>There is the prisoner. There is Lee Oswald.</i>

458
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:24,452
<i>He's been shot.</i>

459
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:26,427
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- What happened?

460
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:27,657
<i>Lee Oswald has been shot.</i>

461
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:30,928
They shot him. The police were walking him
through the building

462
00:34:31,035 --> 00:34:33,765
- and some man ran up and shot him.
- What?

463
00:34:34,772 --> 00:34:36,137
<i>Detectives have their guns drawn.</i>

464
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,936
<i>- What is going on?
- Oswald has been shot.</i>

465
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:42,443
<i>There is no question about it.
Oswald has been shot.</i>

466
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:45,277
- Please, leave me alone.
- Betts?

467
00:34:45,383 --> 00:34:48,352
<i>...here in the basement
of Dallas police headquarters.</i>

468
00:34:48,453 --> 00:34:49,920
What happened?

469
00:34:50,855 --> 00:34:54,291
<i>- Do you know where he is at present?
- No, sir, I don't.</i>

470
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:59,655
<i>- Can you give us some indication...
- Nothing. Go upstairs.</i>

471
00:35:05,837 --> 00:35:08,203
<i>The family, incidentally,
asked that there be no flowers,</i>

472
00:35:08,306 --> 00:35:10,171
<i>but there have, nevertheless, been flowers.</i>

473
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:13,334
<i>People either didn't hear
or chose to ignore it,</i>

474
00:35:13,511 --> 00:35:17,845
<i>and one room or two rooms
in the White House have had to be set aside</i>

475
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:24,613
<i>to hold them. The casket, incidentally,</i>

476
00:35:24,822 --> 00:35:27,814
<i>will remain closed at all times
during all ceremonies...</i>

477
00:35:27,925 --> 00:35:29,392
I'm going out.

478
00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:35,662
- Where?
- For a drive.

479
00:35:37,401 --> 00:35:41,963
Let me drive. I'll get the kids.
We'll all go somewhere. That's a good idea.

480
00:35:42,106 --> 00:35:45,269
No. I need to clear my head.

481
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:48,339
<i>...airports, four of them around town...</i>

482
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:20,539
- I'm so glad you could see me.
- Where does your husband think you are?

483
00:36:21,445 --> 00:36:26,280
I don't care. He's been lying to me for years.
I couldn't be in that house.

484
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:33,854
Then I saw you yesterday.
I didn't know you were going to be there.

485
00:36:35,893 --> 00:36:37,952
I hoped you would be there.

486
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:43,430
Derby day, it seems like 100 years ago.

487
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:50,641
And then this morning,
seeing that man shot to death...

488
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:54,702
What is going on?

489
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:59,449
It will be okay. We've lost a lot of presidents
and we're still standing.

490
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:04,811
I wish I could believe you.
I can't believe anything right now.

491
00:37:06,457 --> 00:37:09,688
Have you thought that
there are other ways to live?

492
00:37:12,296 --> 00:37:15,732
Listen. I'm not in love
with the tragedy of this thing.

493
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:19,795
<i>It's not Romeo and Juliet.
I want it to happen.</i>

494
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:23,103
I have three children.

495
00:37:23,441 --> 00:37:27,172
I'll know more when the primaries
start to shake out in spring,

496
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:31,510
- but I can leave the campaign right now.
- I don't want you to do that.

497
00:37:39,991 --> 00:37:42,289
You don't have to answer me now,

498
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:45,361
but I want to marry you.

499
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:53,432
- I don't know what to say.
- You don't have to say anything.

500
00:37:53,537 --> 00:37:54,868
I told you.

501
00:37:55,773 --> 00:38:00,870
But if you search your heart,
you'll know that I can make you happy.

502
00:38:21,265 --> 00:38:22,630
I should go.

503
00:38:24,935 --> 00:38:27,995
I wish I could take you
to the movies right now,

504
00:38:28,939 --> 00:38:31,999
that some theater was playing
your favorite movie.

505
00:38:34,945 --> 00:38:36,674
<i>Singin' in the Rain.</i>

506
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:40,841
Well, just think about that.

507
00:39:02,973 --> 00:39:08,104
<i>This is made possible by special equipment,
and it will move at one-fourth speed.</i>

508
00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:11,107
<i>So we would like to show you
the slow motion of the shooting</i>

509
00:39:11,215 --> 00:39:13,183
<i>of Lee Harvey Oswald now.</i>

510
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,751
They just stood there.

511
00:39:17,922 --> 00:39:20,789
No security.
The most wanted man in America.

512
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:25,093
Why even have a trial?
Just throw him over to the mob.

513
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:29,863
<i>Now you can see the two detectives,
one in a light suit, one in a dark,</i>

514
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:31,560
<i>bringing Oswald out.</i>

515
00:39:31,669 --> 00:39:35,002
<i>The camera changes its lens
for a close-up of Oswald.</i>

516
00:39:36,841 --> 00:39:40,106
<i>The shot has been fired. You cannot hear it
in this version of the tape.</i>

517
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,076
<i>Oswald falls.
The man with the hat moves in on him.</i>

518
00:39:42,179 --> 00:39:44,545
<i>He's grabbed by the man in light.</i>

519
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:49,777
- You're not going into work tomorrow?
- No, of course not.

520
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:54,280
- It's a national day of mourning.
- You're going to go in Tuesday.

521
00:39:55,826 --> 00:39:58,021
There's another happy thought.

522
00:39:59,864 --> 00:40:04,164
Those people don't care about you.
And honestly, what's the difference?

523
00:40:04,468 --> 00:40:06,197
What are you saying?

524
00:40:07,171 --> 00:40:11,039
You did everything they asked you to do,
but you don't owe them anything.

525
00:40:11,142 --> 00:40:14,509
<i>...minutes past 2:00 Eastern Standard Time,
we were advised</i>

526
00:40:14,612 --> 00:40:19,174
<i>that Lee Harvey Oswald was dead.
Now Ruby is under arrest...</i>

527
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:24,346
You should start gathering your clients.
They'll follow you wherever you go.

528
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:27,389
<i>...is the operator of two nightclubs
in Dallas...</i>

529
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:32,520
<i>The only other president buried there
is William Howard Taft,</i>

530
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:36,999
<i>though, of course, there are many
other heroes of perhaps lesser renown.</i>

531
00:40:37,334 --> 00:40:40,792
<i>That is the Lee... Robert E. Lee Mansion.</i>

532
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:45,906
<i>Its name, Arlington, has been given
to the cemetery and, in fact, to the county.</i>

533
00:40:46,076 --> 00:40:48,636
<i>- Francine has the kids.
- The president's brother, Robert Kennedy,</i>

534
00:40:48,746 --> 00:40:51,442
<i>and the Secretary of Defense,
Robert McNamara...</i>

535
00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:54,643
- I don't know where to begin.
- What?

536
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:04,121
I want to scream at you
for ruining all of this.

537
00:41:07,998 --> 00:41:12,765
But then you try to fix it
and there's no point.

538
00:41:15,172 --> 00:41:17,003
There's no point, Don.

539
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:24,277
You're very upset. I understand.

540
00:41:27,051 --> 00:41:30,612
I know it's painful, but it's going to pass.

541
00:41:33,624 --> 00:41:36,650
- I don't love you.
- Betts, don't.

542
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:41,194
- You're distraught.
- That's true,

543
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:44,827
but I don't love you anymore.

544
00:41:47,538 --> 00:41:49,403
- I know that.
- Stop it.

545
00:41:50,307 --> 00:41:53,743
<i>- I kissed you yesterday.
- Kennedy's remains...</i>

546
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:55,675
I didn't feel a thing.

547
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:59,976
<i>...the public allowed to pass through
and pay its respects.</i>

548
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:02,348
<i>There will be a little roped...</i>

549
00:42:02,453 --> 00:42:05,149
You'll feel better tomorrow. You'll see.

550
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:08,890
You can't even hear me right now.

551
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:10,960
You're right.

552
00:42:13,063 --> 00:42:15,361
<i>...on Monday it will be taken</i>

553
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:20,165
<i>to the St. Matthew's Cathedral, which is on
Rhode Island Avenue in Washington,</i>

554
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:22,429
<i>for the funeral.</i>

555
00:42:24,942 --> 00:42:29,311
<i>This, I think, is the largest
Catholic cathedral in town.</i>

556
00:42:29,413 --> 00:42:31,881
<i>It is, as you see, draped in black.</i>

557
00:42:32,249 --> 00:42:35,946
<i>It's been open all day.
Great numbers of people have stopped...</i>

558
00:43:30,908 --> 00:43:32,876
- Morning.
- Morning, Daddy.

559
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:34,443
Good morning.

560
00:43:39,249 --> 00:43:42,685
- Where are you going?
- I have to go to work. I'm sorry.

561
00:43:43,053 --> 00:43:45,681
- It's cold outside.
- I'm fine.

562
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,046
Peggy.

563
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:25,761
What are you doing here?

564
00:44:26,764 --> 00:44:28,629
I don't know. Aqua Net.

565
00:44:37,775 --> 00:44:40,539
It doesn't shoot till after Thanksgiving.

566
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:43,646
We'll be okay.

567
00:44:52,423 --> 00:44:54,015
What do you have?

568
00:44:54,158 --> 00:44:57,184
- What are you doing here?
- The bars are closed.

569
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:03,355
My roommate invited over half the building
so they could watch TV

570
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:06,129
and write condolence letters to Jackie.

571
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:10,200
Then I went to my sister's
and my mother was crying

572
00:45:10,307 --> 00:45:12,036
and praying so hard.

573
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:16,141
There wasn't room
for anyone else to feel anything.

574
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:22,245
The funeral's already started.

575
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:26,321
I was going to watch in Cooper's office.
Is that okay?

576
00:45:27,624 --> 00:45:28,648
Yes.

577
00:45:35,766 --> 00:45:37,256
Are you coming?
