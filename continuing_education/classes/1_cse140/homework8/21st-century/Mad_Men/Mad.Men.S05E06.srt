1
00:00:00,329 --> 00:00:02,030
Previously on Mad Men...

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:03,743
- Let's get out of here.
- No!

3
00:00:03,913 --> 00:00:05,005
They'll knock the door...

4
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,626
- What time is it?
- Shut up.

5
00:00:08,321 --> 00:00:10,858
- You want it so bad...
- I don't want you!

6
00:00:14,473 --> 00:00:15,761
I'm really sorry about that.

7
00:00:15,906 --> 00:00:17,007
Please!

8
00:00:17,148 --> 00:00:18,311
This is a process.

9
00:00:18,404 --> 00:00:19,936
I just want to be
a part of this place.

10
00:00:20,088 --> 00:00:21,623
I think it's on the way up.

11
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:22,906
I got the job.

12
00:00:23,022 --> 00:00:24,434
You don't say...

13
00:00:25,073 --> 00:00:26,399
I can't stay that long...

14
00:00:26,511 --> 00:00:28,658
I have to go back and
redo the Heinz speech.

15
00:00:56,277 --> 00:00:59,249


16
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,751
Did you eat my pack
of violet candy?

17
00:01:13,786 --> 00:01:15,486
What?

18
00:01:15,521 --> 00:01:17,356
It's purple and silver.

19
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:19,725
Don gave it to me
before a presentation once.

20
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,860
- No.
- I need it.

21
00:01:21,894 --> 00:01:24,829
- So you'll buy another one.
- That's not the same.

22
00:01:24,864 --> 00:01:26,464
Don't be such
a strict catholic.

23
00:01:26,498 --> 00:01:28,366
I'll buy one for you
and I'll say a brucha.

24
00:01:29,768 --> 00:01:31,868
How about tonight we go
see that stupid movie

25
00:01:31,903 --> 00:01:34,070
about the guy being
hunted in Africa?

26
00:01:34,104 --> 00:01:37,139
- "The Naked Prey."
- I don't know, Abe.

27
00:01:37,173 --> 00:01:39,407
You're gonna resist the chance
to see Cornel Wilde naked?

28
00:01:39,441 --> 00:01:42,142
I heard he wrestles a boa constrictor.
Sounds pretty dirty.

29
00:01:42,177 --> 00:01:44,044
I can't think beyond
my presentation.

30
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:46,547
There's always special
circumstances.

31
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:49,383
That's not true.

32
00:01:49,418 --> 00:01:51,219
I've been working
on Heinz for months.

33
00:01:51,254 --> 00:01:54,890
You know what you want?
You want to take me to work with you

34
00:01:54,924 --> 00:01:57,759
and stick me in a drawer and
open it whenever you get bored.

35
00:01:57,793 --> 00:02:00,962
Fine. You don't want to
see each other anymore?

36
00:02:00,997 --> 00:02:03,031
Jesus!

37
00:02:03,065 --> 00:02:06,135
You always want to push the
button on the whole thing.

38
00:02:06,169 --> 00:02:08,069
I come all the way
up here to make love.

39
00:02:08,104 --> 00:02:11,607
Half the time you don't want to and then
you just do it to get it over with.

40
00:02:11,641 --> 00:02:13,475
It's just hard when I come
right from work.

41
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:15,276
I need a second
when I walk in the door.

42
00:02:15,311 --> 00:02:18,312
- You sound like my dad.
- Fine.

43
00:02:18,347 --> 00:02:21,616
We'll go to the movies. I just can't
promise that my mind won't be elsewhere.

44
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:23,350
Your mind is always elsewhere.

45
00:02:23,385 --> 00:02:25,586
Why are you doing
this right now?

46
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,890
St men wouldn't even have this conversation.
They'd just leave.

47
00:02:28,924 --> 00:02:30,859
And why would they do that?

48
00:02:30,893 --> 00:02:34,495
I'm your boyfriend,
not a focus group.

49
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:36,730
Have a shitty day.

50
00:02:40,668 --> 00:02:43,035
I don't know.
Can't you make it till Friday?

51
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:46,239
Because today
is not a good day.

52
00:02:46,274 --> 00:02:49,142
This conversation went in a circle
and we're back where we started.

53
00:02:49,176 --> 00:02:51,143
The answer is no.

54
00:02:51,178 --> 00:02:54,380
Yeah, me, too.

55
00:02:54,414 --> 00:02:56,149
I just had the same
conversation.

56
00:02:56,183 --> 00:02:57,951
No, I think they were different
because yours was private.

57
00:02:57,985 --> 00:03:00,419
Sorry I'm late.

58
00:03:00,454 --> 00:03:02,355
There's no place
to pee in this city.

59
00:03:02,389 --> 00:03:04,857
- She just got here.
- Then why are you giving me a hard time?

60
00:03:04,891 --> 00:03:07,960
We had the funniest thing
outside our building.

61
00:03:07,995 --> 00:03:11,530
A bunch of students with backpacks
asked us how to get to Broadway.

62
00:03:11,564 --> 00:03:14,065
What's so funny
about that, Jethro?

63
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,968
It's like the campaign.
We could have cast it right there and then.

64
00:03:17,002 --> 00:03:18,836
Mmm.

65
00:03:18,871 --> 00:03:21,772
- Megan, can I have a moment?
- Oh, uh, sure.

66
00:03:21,806 --> 00:03:23,874
- She goes to casting now?
- I guess so.

67
00:03:23,909 --> 00:03:25,576
She's kind of been
my junior on this.

68
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:28,879
I was buying dinner last night
for this large-breasted girl

69
00:03:28,914 --> 00:03:31,348
who calls herself salome,
and she's looking at the menu,

70
00:03:31,383 --> 00:03:35,152
ridiculing this Grandma Moses drawing
and she's bas-out funny.

71
00:03:35,186 --> 00:03:38,255
But I ignore her
because all I can think of

72
00:03:38,289 --> 00:03:41,591
is I'll never be able to draw
as well as a photograph.

73
00:03:45,596 --> 00:03:48,231
Oh, thank God.

74
00:03:48,265 --> 00:03:50,466
I couldn't take
one more omen of doom.

75
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,168
I'm sorry. We're gonna have
to miss the presentation.

76
00:03:53,203 --> 00:03:55,070
We have to head upstate
for Howard Johnson's.

77
00:03:55,104 --> 00:03:57,405
- Really?
- You're running the show.

78
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,674
How does me sitting there
change anything?

79
00:03:59,709 --> 00:04:01,209
Howard Johnson's, huh?

80
00:04:01,243 --> 00:04:03,778
I love the colors,
the atmosphere,

81
00:04:03,812 --> 00:04:06,314
- the clams.
- She's never been to one.

82
00:04:08,784 --> 00:04:10,719
I'm really sorry.

83
00:04:10,753 --> 00:04:13,121
No, we have all
your work, I guess.

84
00:04:13,156 --> 00:04:15,490
I'll check in from the road.
Get your stuff.

85
00:04:20,763 --> 00:04:23,498
Um, break a leg.

86
00:04:24,968 --> 00:04:27,702
- Well, that's a disaster.
- Don't listen to him.

87
00:04:27,736 --> 00:04:29,337
That's a vote of confidence.

88
00:04:29,371 --> 00:04:31,272
Give me one of those.

89
00:04:36,177 --> 00:04:38,844
The fire is primal.

90
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:42,948
These kids, they all
come there alone,

91
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:45,750
and gathered in a circle,
they suddenly feel

92
00:04:45,784 --> 00:04:48,387
included.

93
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:50,656
They're safe from
whatever is out there

94
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,725
in the night, in the darkness.

95
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,061
It's the beans
that brought them together

96
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:58,998
on that cool night
at the end of the summer.

97
00:05:04,603 --> 00:05:06,438
"Home is where
the Heinz is."

98
00:05:07,873 --> 00:05:10,041
I wish someone
was eating beans.

99
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:11,876
That guy is.

100
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,711
I did ask for college students.

101
00:05:13,745 --> 00:05:15,580
I know that, Raymond.

102
00:05:15,614 --> 00:05:17,849
And we want you to have
everything you asked for.

103
00:05:17,883 --> 00:05:20,284
Well, stop writing down
what I asked for

104
00:05:20,318 --> 00:05:22,186
and try to figure out
what I want.

105
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:25,657
Raymond, I saw you
when she was talking.

106
00:05:25,691 --> 00:05:27,959
- You were off somewhere.
- It's very sentimental.

107
00:05:27,993 --> 00:05:29,527
I have that memory.

108
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:31,596
That's for me.
That's not for kids.

109
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:34,867
Kids have memories.

110
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:38,770
And so do the homemakers
who make a home with Heinz.

111
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:40,672
Raymond, can you see
how passionate she is?

112
00:05:40,706 --> 00:05:43,575
Photography will really capture
the fun on their faces.

113
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:46,778
- And the glow.
- Did Don sign off on this?

114
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:49,548
Don loves this work.

115
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:51,883
Maybe Don doesn't understand
what you wanted either.

116
00:05:51,917 --> 00:05:53,351
Let's not speak for Don.

117
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:55,687
I'm sorry. I'm not a word
person like you people.

118
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:57,189
Sure, you are.

119
00:05:57,223 --> 00:05:59,458
And your words are always
"I don't like it."

120
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:03,595
And I think you're right.
We don't understand you.

121
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:05,763
Because you do like it.

122
00:06:05,797 --> 00:06:07,532
I think you just like fighting.

123
00:06:07,566 --> 00:06:08,866
Peggy, you're being
oversensitive.

124
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:12,236
Do you know how often
people come in here

125
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:15,206
and look at work
and feel something?

126
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,475
Almost never.

127
00:06:17,509 --> 00:06:19,310
You have to run with this.

128
00:06:19,344 --> 00:06:21,779
It's young and it's beautiful.

129
00:06:21,813 --> 00:06:25,216
And no one else is gonna figure
out how to say that about beans.

130
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:28,819
Can you believe this girl?

131
00:06:28,854 --> 00:06:30,821
I don't know.

132
00:06:30,855 --> 00:06:32,823
Can you?

133
00:06:32,857 --> 00:06:35,393
Miss, you're lucky
that I have a daughter

134
00:06:35,427 --> 00:06:37,261
or I wouldn't be
so understanding.

135
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:40,098
Raymond, they're frustrated,

136
00:06:40,132 --> 00:06:42,400
but they're not through.

137
00:06:42,434 --> 00:06:44,902
I'm frustrated, too.

138
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:50,141
- It's close, I guess.
- It's damn close.

139
00:06:50,175 --> 00:06:52,109
Why don't just you and I
have dinner tonight?

140
00:06:52,144 --> 00:06:54,878
Maybe take in a show?
Take your mind off things?

141
00:06:54,913 --> 00:06:56,880
You can try.

142
00:07:04,989 --> 00:07:06,690
<i>I've got to admire you.</i>

143
00:07:06,725 --> 00:07:09,660
That was a completely
suicidal move.

144
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:11,696
Women usually want to please.

145
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:14,066
Give me sketches
of the talking beans.

146
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,068
I'll write new dialog.

147
00:07:21,142 --> 00:07:23,677
- You're off the business.
- What'd he say?

148
00:07:23,711 --> 00:07:25,712
He said you're off
the business.

149
00:07:41,697 --> 00:07:43,631
Everyone has
somewhere to go today.

150
00:07:43,665 --> 00:07:45,199
I'm going to the movies.

151
00:07:45,234 --> 00:07:47,068
Very good.

152
00:07:55,846 --> 00:07:58,881
<i>One of them gave Sam</i>
<i>a first-class scratch.</i>

153
00:07:58,915 --> 00:08:01,083
Not very good-tempered,
are they?

154
00:08:01,117 --> 00:08:02,818
<i>Well, neither are
you when you're hungry.</i>

155
00:08:02,853 --> 00:08:04,487
<i>I don't suppose</i>
<i>you've fed them.</i>

156
00:08:04,521 --> 00:08:06,456
<i>No, I can't say I have.</i>

157
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:09,259
<i>You didn't pack any lion's</i>
<i>milk for me before I left.</i>

158
00:08:09,293 --> 00:08:12,529
<i>You didn't ask me.</i>

159
00:08:12,563 --> 00:08:15,299
You're going to get in trouble.

160
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:17,568
Want some?

161
00:08:19,303 --> 00:08:21,071
Sure.
What the hell.

162
00:08:26,311 --> 00:08:28,278
<i>Come on.</i>

163
00:08:33,585 --> 00:08:35,719
- Hello.
- Hi.

164
00:08:35,754 --> 00:08:37,688
<i>But why don't they?</i>

165
00:08:37,722 --> 00:08:39,356
<i>It's at least two days</i>
<i>since they've eaten.</i>

166
00:08:39,391 --> 00:08:41,024
- <i>They'll just die.</i>
- <i>Yes, I know.</i>

167
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:43,427
<i>It must be the formula.</i>
<i>We haven't hit on it yet.</i>

168
00:08:43,462 --> 00:08:45,329
<i>We'll just have try again.</i>

169
00:08:45,364 --> 00:08:47,899
<i>Right, back to</i>
<i>the drawing board.</i>

170
00:08:47,933 --> 00:08:50,201
<i>Formula...</i>
- <i>13.</i>

171
00:08:53,872 --> 00:08:57,508
<i>Oh, George, I've just been
thinking about the cod-liver oil.</i>

172
00:09:03,816 --> 00:09:06,050
She's not gonna make it
out there on her own.

173
00:09:06,084 --> 00:09:08,452
- Shh.
- You've got to keep it down.

174
00:09:08,486 --> 00:09:11,221
Okay.

175
00:09:12,423 --> 00:09:14,625
Aren't you worried?

176
00:09:19,129 --> 00:09:21,330
It'll turn out all right.

177
00:09:34,545 --> 00:09:37,581
<i>That evening, we suffered
all the agony of parents</i>

178
00:09:37,616 --> 00:09:39,417
<i>whose teenage daughter</i>
<i>is out on her first date.</i>

179
00:09:39,451 --> 00:09:41,186
No.

180
00:09:45,792 --> 00:09:47,726
Just watch the movie.

181
00:09:51,697 --> 00:09:54,766
<i>We returned the next day</i>
<i>only to find Elsa</i>

182
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,401
<i>minus both the young</i>
<i>lion and her food.</i>

183
00:10:10,249 --> 00:10:12,851
<i>I told you a dozen</i>
<i>sometimes I was coming in.</i>

184
00:10:12,886 --> 00:10:14,453
And I said no,
you're not coming in.

185
00:10:14,487 --> 00:10:15,988
'Cause you don't want
I should see you?

186
00:10:16,022 --> 00:10:17,757
<i>You see me at home,</i>
<i>for Christ's sake.</i>

187
00:10:17,792 --> 00:10:19,526
You stare at me
when I'm sleeping.

188
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,194
Eh, I don't want
to see you anyway.

189
00:10:21,229 --> 00:10:23,163
- I just want to use the photocopy.
- For what?

190
00:10:23,198 --> 00:10:25,766
I'm building my case.

191
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,834
Again?

192
00:10:27,869 --> 00:10:29,570
Who's this?

193
00:10:29,604 --> 00:10:32,639
I'm Peggy Olson.
I work with Ginsberg.

194
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:35,209
Well, I'm the original.

195
00:10:35,243 --> 00:10:37,578
Okay. Ahem.
It's bedtime.

196
00:11:07,977 --> 00:11:10,245
Miss Olson.

197
00:11:15,618 --> 00:11:17,986
- What time is it?
- It's 8:30.

198
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,521
Mr. Draper's on the phone.

199
00:11:23,459 --> 00:11:25,627
I'll take it in here.
You can go.

200
00:11:25,662 --> 00:11:26,662
Good night.

201
00:11:32,935 --> 00:11:36,004
- Hello. - Dawn didn't get any
calls. Did you get any calls?

202
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:38,873
- About what?
- Has anyone called you?

203
00:11:38,908 --> 00:11:40,775
I don't think so.

204
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:43,144
Oh, okay.

205
00:11:43,179 --> 00:11:46,214
Listen, it didn't go well.

206
00:11:46,248 --> 00:11:48,984
- <i>I've got to go.</i>
- I take full responsibility.

207
00:11:50,687 --> 00:11:52,922
Hello?

208
00:12:06,405 --> 00:12:08,372
Why didn't you tell me
you had a family?

209
00:12:08,407 --> 00:12:11,776
- Your father's nice.
- He's not my real father.

210
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:13,878
People don't understand.

211
00:12:13,912 --> 00:12:16,681
- Are you adopted?
- Actually, I'm from Mars.

212
00:12:19,051 --> 00:12:21,552
It's fine if you don't believe
me, but that's where I'm from.

213
00:12:22,521 --> 00:12:24,355
I'm a full-blooded martian.

214
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:28,493
Don't worry.
There's no plot to take over Earth.

215
00:12:29,695 --> 00:12:31,630
We're just displaced.

216
00:12:31,664 --> 00:12:33,799
Okay.

217
00:12:33,834 --> 00:12:36,035
I can tell
you don't believe me.

218
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:39,339
That's okay.
We're a big secret.

219
00:12:39,373 --> 00:12:42,309
<i>They even tried</i>
<i>to hide it from me.</i>

220
00:12:42,343 --> 00:12:45,145
That man, my father,

221
00:12:45,179 --> 00:12:48,081
told me a story I was born
in a concentration camp,

222
00:12:48,115 --> 00:12:49,749
but you know that's impossible.

223
00:12:51,651 --> 00:12:54,620
And I never met my mother because
she supposedly died there.

224
00:12:54,654 --> 00:12:56,888
That's convenient.

225
00:12:56,923 --> 00:13:00,025
Next thing I know, Morris there finds
me in a Swedish orphanage.

226
00:13:00,059 --> 00:13:02,727
<i>I was five.</i>
<i>I remember it.</i>

227
00:13:02,762 --> 00:13:04,630
That's incredible.

228
00:13:04,664 --> 00:13:06,365
Yeah.

229
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,367
And then I got
this one communication.

230
00:13:08,402 --> 00:13:10,336
A simple order.

231
00:13:12,072 --> 00:13:14,675
Stay where you are.

232
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:18,946
Are there others like you?

233
00:13:18,981 --> 00:13:20,715
I don't know.

234
00:13:22,652 --> 00:13:25,520
I haven't been able
to find any.

235
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:54,148
- Hello?
- Hi. It's me.

236
00:13:54,183 --> 00:13:56,651
You at work?

237
00:13:56,686 --> 00:13:58,353
No, I'm home.

238
00:14:00,457 --> 00:14:02,491
Come up here.

239
00:14:03,693 --> 00:14:05,627
You need me, huh?

240
00:14:05,662 --> 00:14:07,896
I always need you.

241
00:14:09,365 --> 00:14:11,032
<i>What happened?</i>

242
00:14:11,067 --> 00:14:14,335
This guy told me the strangest
thing at work today.

243
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:16,403
<i>Yeah?</i>

244
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:19,707
He said he was born
in a concentration camp.

245
00:14:19,741 --> 00:14:22,109
But that's impossible, right?

246
00:14:22,143 --> 00:14:25,078
It happened.

247
00:14:25,112 --> 00:14:28,616
- Come up here.
- <i>Okay.</i>

248
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:30,385
Hurry.

249
00:14:44,668 --> 00:14:47,237
I'm going to go in there and
sit down with the door closed.

250
00:14:47,271 --> 00:14:49,506
And I want you to buzz me
when he comes in.

251
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:53,010
One buzz for Don, two
buzzes for Mr. and Mrs.

252
00:15:05,224 --> 00:15:07,125
- Who died?
- Let's play hooky.

253
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:08,760
Should I close the door?

254
00:15:08,794 --> 00:15:11,362
Remember when we used to
represent double-sided aluminum?

255
00:15:11,397 --> 00:15:13,765
I remember twins
and a hospital.

256
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:15,533
Not that part.

257
00:15:15,568 --> 00:15:17,735
Bob Whozit's moved over
to Howard Johnson's

258
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:19,404
to help them with
their new models.

259
00:15:19,438 --> 00:15:23,007
So how about a completely
debauched and unnecessary

260
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:26,410
fact-finding boondoggle
to the flagship in...

261
00:15:27,813 --> 00:15:29,580
Plattsburgh, New York?

262
00:15:29,615 --> 00:15:32,817
Just an hour from
scenic lake placid.

263
00:15:32,851 --> 00:15:35,686
- Are you kidding me? - Did you ever hear
the one about the farmer's daughter?

264
00:15:35,721 --> 00:15:37,622
This is where
it all takes place.

265
00:15:37,656 --> 00:15:41,092
- No.
- Don, come on.

266
00:15:41,126 --> 00:15:44,295
Alone, I'm an escapee from some
expensive mental institution.

267
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:47,765
But the two of us, we're a couple
of rich, handsome perverts.

268
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:51,168
- I love Howard Johnson's.
- We'll try and stop by.

269
00:15:51,203 --> 00:15:53,504
I think Montreal
is an hour away.

270
00:15:53,538 --> 00:15:56,307
Look, the whole point of going
is to forget about her.

271
00:15:56,341 --> 00:15:59,043
I mean, I'm supposed to have
dinner with Jane's snooty friends,

272
00:15:59,077 --> 00:16:01,312
sit around talking about
Frank Lloyd rice.

273
00:16:01,346 --> 00:16:03,447
I always say it that way.
They hate it.

274
00:16:03,481 --> 00:16:05,449
You know what?

275
00:16:07,151 --> 00:16:09,987
- I'm gonna take Megan.
- Really?

276
00:16:10,021 --> 00:16:11,988
You can bring Jane.

277
00:16:12,023 --> 00:16:13,390
Megan gets along with everyone.

278
00:16:13,424 --> 00:16:15,325
You're very funny.
Forget it.

279
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:17,093
Newlyweds.

280
00:16:17,127 --> 00:16:19,128
I'll give Dawn the guy's name.

281
00:16:24,667 --> 00:16:26,702
Dawn, I need you to get
me out of everything

282
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:28,370
through the weekend.

283
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:33,041
It was a dumb idea.

284
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:34,777
<i>Megan, can I have a moment?</i>

285
00:16:34,811 --> 00:16:36,545
Sure.

286
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,488
- You're not gonna say anything?
- What?

287
00:16:45,523 --> 00:16:48,125
I said you look nice and I
said I don't want to do this.

288
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:49,826
Well, what do you want to do?

289
00:16:49,861 --> 00:16:51,929
Go home, open your vest
and yell at the TV

290
00:16:51,963 --> 00:16:54,265
for the next 20 years?
Go ahead.

291
00:16:54,299 --> 00:16:56,167
God.

292
00:16:56,201 --> 00:16:58,870
Okay, I'm sorry.
I don't know these people.

293
00:16:58,905 --> 00:17:00,506
I do.

294
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,708
And it's not about them.

295
00:17:02,743 --> 00:17:05,877
It's very important to me.
I don't know how many ways to say it.

296
00:17:08,014 --> 00:17:10,381
I should have worn
something more comfortable.

297
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:12,817
You really do look great.

298
00:17:15,639 --> 00:17:18,136
It's the study of the ways the
things are true or false.

299
00:17:18,331 --> 00:17:21,533
Some things are possibly true.
Some are necessarily true.

300
00:17:21,567 --> 00:17:23,869
Some used to be true.
Some will be true.

301
00:17:23,903 --> 00:17:26,472
Some are true on this planet,
but not necessarily others.

302
00:17:26,506 --> 00:17:29,409
So there's no good and bad
because the truth is relative?

303
00:17:29,443 --> 00:17:31,878
Even if the truth is what
you would call relative,

304
00:17:31,913 --> 00:17:33,980
good and bad are not relative.

305
00:17:34,015 --> 00:17:36,049
Your mistake is
that you're assuming

306
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:38,151
That because something
is true that it's good.

307
00:17:38,185 --> 00:17:41,120
Professor's got you there.

308
00:17:41,154 --> 00:17:43,889
I think the truth is good
because it's always real

309
00:17:43,923 --> 00:17:45,724
on any planet.

310
00:17:45,758 --> 00:17:48,159
I have patients who spend years

311
00:17:48,194 --> 00:17:50,428
reasoning out their
motivation for a mistake.

312
00:17:50,462 --> 00:17:52,830
And when they find it out, they
think they've found the truth.

313
00:17:52,864 --> 00:17:54,465
They probably have.

314
00:17:54,499 --> 00:17:57,635
- And then they go and make
the same mistake. - Like who?

315
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:00,405
Catherine has been the
psychiatrist to some celebrities.

316
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,676
- Wow.
- So they never get better?

317
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:08,115
I didn't say that.
I just said that it's a myth

318
00:18:08,149 --> 00:18:11,218
that tracing logic all the
way down to the truth

319
00:18:11,252 --> 00:18:14,121
is a cure for neurosis
or for anything else.

320
00:18:14,156 --> 00:18:16,157
Is there a cure for neurosis?

321
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:17,658
Love works.

322
00:18:19,261 --> 00:18:22,964
I say we postpone this conversation
until after we turn on.

323
00:18:22,998 --> 00:18:25,366
- Shall we?
- Or after we turn in.

324
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,368
Jane, honey, you ready?

325
00:18:30,272 --> 00:18:32,106
What do you think you're doing?

326
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,775
I took your college course.
I say it's time to hit the sack.

327
00:18:34,809 --> 00:18:38,379
- No, we're gonna do this.
- Do what?

328
00:18:38,413 --> 00:18:41,282
I told you, we're going
to take LSD with them.

329
00:18:41,317 --> 00:18:42,851
You were supposed to
clear your schedule.

330
00:18:42,885 --> 00:18:46,321
LSD?
Really?

331
00:18:46,355 --> 00:18:49,291
You really are never
listening, are you?

332
00:18:49,326 --> 00:18:52,462
- How long does it last?
- Please.

333
00:18:52,496 --> 00:18:54,898
I don't want to do this alone.

334
00:18:54,932 --> 00:18:56,533
It'll be good for us.

335
00:18:57,702 --> 00:18:59,202
Okay.

336
00:19:05,008 --> 00:19:06,909
Just copy what they're doing.

337
00:19:08,878 --> 00:19:11,313
I think we are going to go.

338
00:19:11,347 --> 00:19:15,016
- Oh, no.
- We had a lovely time.

339
00:19:24,193 --> 00:19:26,628
No one has to stay.

340
00:19:26,662 --> 00:19:28,596
All I'll say is

341
00:19:28,631 --> 00:19:31,433
that I have taken it
now four times

342
00:19:31,467 --> 00:19:34,469
and every experience was more
beautiful than the last.

343
00:19:34,503 --> 00:19:37,272
And I'm not gonna take it.
I'll be here to guide you.

344
00:19:37,306 --> 00:19:39,474
I'm excited.

345
00:19:39,508 --> 00:19:41,577
I'm not gonna lie;
I'm a little nervous.

346
00:19:41,611 --> 00:19:44,113
This is an experience
of self-fulfilling prophecy.

347
00:19:44,147 --> 00:19:46,448
You have to enter into it
with a spirit of optimism.

348
00:19:46,483 --> 00:19:49,351
It's like a boat trip.
You don't cast off thinking about sinking.

349
00:19:49,386 --> 00:19:52,354
And this boat is perfect.
And the water is calm.

350
00:19:52,389 --> 00:19:54,990
No, you hold on to that.

351
00:19:56,326 --> 00:19:57,793
Go ahead.

352
00:19:57,827 --> 00:20:01,430
Just let it melt
on your tongue.

353
00:20:05,736 --> 00:20:07,737
You always say
I never take you anywhere.

354
00:20:32,063 --> 00:20:35,598
Well, Dr. Leary,
I find your product boring.

355
00:20:55,285 --> 00:20:58,087
<i>Only awareness</i>
<i>can make reality.</i>

356
00:20:58,121 --> 00:21:00,289
And only what's real
can become a dream.

357
00:21:00,323 --> 00:21:03,025
And only from a dream
can you wake to the light.

358
00:21:03,059 --> 00:21:05,027
Okey-dokey.

359
00:21:05,062 --> 00:21:07,063
He's not making this up.

360
00:21:07,097 --> 00:21:09,665
<i>It's from the Tibetan</i>
<i>book of the damned.</i>

361
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:13,235
The dead, my dear.
"Bardo Thodol" is a guide to dying.

362
00:21:16,873 --> 00:21:19,175
Oh, my God.

363
00:21:19,209 --> 00:21:21,744
Look at my arm.

364
00:21:24,547 --> 00:21:27,549
- I don't want to die.
<i>- Some party.</i>

365
00:21:32,587 --> 00:21:35,857
All absence is death
if we let ourselves know it.

366
00:21:35,891 --> 00:21:38,260
<i>Weren't you the one who said we
were supposed to think positive?</i>

367
00:21:38,294 --> 00:21:40,629
Yes.

368
00:21:40,663 --> 00:21:43,098
I feel like that
when Roger goes to work.

369
00:21:43,133 --> 00:21:46,636
A mere change
is incremental and shallow.

370
00:21:46,671 --> 00:21:49,206
<i>I'm sitting here listening
to these people have a conversation.</i>

371
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,542
<i>It has nothing to do with me.</i>

372
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:53,277
<i>It's incredible.</i>

373
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:58,449

<i>a place to fit in ♪</i>

374
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:03,154

380
00:22:23,941 --> 00:22:26,042
<i>Don't look in the mirror.</i>

381
00:22:26,077 --> 00:22:28,011
What?

382
00:22:28,045 --> 00:22:30,113
Don't look in the mirror.

383
00:22:30,147 --> 00:22:32,315
- Why didn't you tell me that?
- I did.

384
00:22:32,349 --> 00:22:35,284
I already looked.

385
00:22:35,318 --> 00:22:38,454
Look at me.
Everything's okay.

386
00:22:38,488 --> 00:22:41,123
You are okay.

387
00:22:41,158 --> 00:22:43,326
Now go to your wife.

388
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,894
Why?

389
00:22:44,928 --> 00:22:47,996
Because she wants to be alone
in the truth with you.

390
00:22:48,031 --> 00:22:49,998
Just go already.

391
00:22:56,071 --> 00:22:59,508
<i>♪ I guess I just wasn't ♪</i>

392
00:23:19,697 --> 00:23:21,931
You're crying.

It's so...

394
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:32,708
It's perfect here.

395
00:23:32,742 --> 00:23:35,244
Let's go home.

396
00:23:35,278 --> 00:23:39,816

397
00:23:41,352 --> 00:23:46,991

400
00:24:11,485 --> 00:24:14,153
Why are you laughing?

401
00:24:14,188 --> 00:24:16,923
Are you laughing at me?

402
00:24:16,958 --> 00:24:19,259
What's wrong with me?

403
00:24:19,294 --> 00:24:20,961
It's the World Series.

404
00:24:20,995 --> 00:24:24,398
1919.
The Black Sox.

405
00:24:24,433 --> 00:24:27,168
Were you there?

406
00:24:27,202 --> 00:24:29,237
No, but I'm there.

407
00:24:33,576 --> 00:24:37,045
Look at the cars--
Model T, model T,

408
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:39,080
model A, model T.

409
00:24:39,114 --> 00:24:41,516
I can't see it.

410
00:24:53,562 --> 00:24:55,797
What time is it?

411
00:24:55,831 --> 00:24:59,334
How could a few numbers
contain all of time?

412
00:25:01,771 --> 00:25:03,972
I can feel your lips.

413
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,142
- I'm still here.
- I can see you.

414
00:25:07,176 --> 00:25:09,545
- You're beautiful.
- You always say that.

415
00:25:09,579 --> 00:25:11,480
It's all you ever say.

416
00:25:11,514 --> 00:25:14,517
Now I know why
your friends are so smart.

417
00:25:14,551 --> 00:25:18,354
Catherine is not my friend.
She's my doctor.

418
00:25:18,356 --> 00:25:21,592
I knew that,
but I didn't know it.

419
00:25:21,626 --> 00:25:25,196
Sometimes I think she knows
me better than you do.

420
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:27,299
Do I want to know?

421
00:25:29,168 --> 00:25:31,470
Probably not.

422
00:25:31,505 --> 00:25:33,472
Because it's over?

423
00:25:33,507 --> 00:25:36,308
She's just waiting
for me to say it.

424
00:25:36,343 --> 00:25:38,277
And what does she think of me?

425
00:25:38,311 --> 00:25:40,880
She thinks I'm waiting
for you to say it.

426
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:44,916
But instead you wrote me
this poem tonight, didn't you?

427
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:47,685
I knew we were going somewhere

428
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,221
and I didn't want
it to be here.

429
00:25:50,256 --> 00:25:53,824
Do you feel
as relieved as I do?

430
00:25:53,858 --> 00:25:56,460
All I think about
is having an affair.

431
00:25:56,494 --> 00:25:58,462
I see them everywhere.

432
00:25:58,497 --> 00:26:00,397
You never cheated on me?

433
00:26:00,432 --> 00:26:02,300
There was a kiss.

434
00:26:02,334 --> 00:26:04,401
I stopped it.

435
00:26:04,436 --> 00:26:06,437
And then I was mad at you,

436
00:26:06,471 --> 00:26:08,473
that you didn't appreciate it

437
00:26:08,507 --> 00:26:10,841
even though you
didn't know about it.

438
00:26:10,876 --> 00:26:13,344
A younger man?

439
00:26:13,378 --> 00:26:16,681
No, Roger.

440
00:26:23,156 --> 00:26:25,657
That's always been real.

441
00:26:27,494 --> 00:26:30,496
And I won't even ask about you.

442
00:26:30,531 --> 00:26:33,500
I just know for a fact that
you did not fall in love.

443
00:26:33,534 --> 00:26:36,603
So what was wrong again?

444
00:26:36,637 --> 00:26:38,771
You don't like me.

445
00:26:40,207 --> 00:26:42,174
I did.

446
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,814
I really did.

447
00:27:13,782 --> 00:27:16,650
- Is it morning?
- Yes.

448
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:26,393
I'm sorry I always say it,
but you are so beautiful.

449
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:30,465
Last night was beautiful.

450
00:27:30,499 --> 00:27:32,400
It was, wasn't it?

451
00:27:34,504 --> 00:27:36,004
Where are you going?

452
00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:38,707
Out the door

453
00:27:38,741 --> 00:27:40,642
and into the elevator,
I suppose.

454
00:27:40,677 --> 00:27:42,577
What about me?

455
00:27:42,612 --> 00:27:45,814
You can take
your time, obviously.

456
00:27:45,849 --> 00:27:49,318
I figured I'd just check
into a hotel for a while.

457
00:27:49,352 --> 00:27:51,553
I don't want to displace you.

458
00:27:53,923 --> 00:27:55,924
What are you talking about?

459
00:27:55,959 --> 00:27:58,860
I imagined all the screaming
and fighting and lawyers.

460
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:02,797
It's just so beautiful

461
00:28:02,832 --> 00:28:05,900
how we were able
to be there together

462
00:28:05,935 --> 00:28:09,171
in the truth like you wanted.

463
00:28:13,109 --> 00:28:15,911
- Are you leaving me?
- No.

464
00:28:15,945 --> 00:28:18,014
We're leaving each other
just like you said.

465
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:20,383
- I didn't say that.
- You did.

466
00:28:20,417 --> 00:28:22,018
You said so many
amazing things.

467
00:28:22,052 --> 00:28:24,855
- You were speaking German.
- I don't know German.

468
00:28:24,889 --> 00:28:26,290
You were quoting your father.

469
00:28:26,324 --> 00:28:28,625
It must have been yiddish.

470
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:32,196
But I was on drugs.
I obviously didn't mean any of it.

471
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:34,399
So your psychiatrist
didn't tell you that you knew

472
00:28:34,433 --> 00:28:37,402
is was over, but you were
waiting for me to say it?

473
00:28:37,436 --> 00:28:39,404
I did say that.

474
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,975
It's good that you did
because we both know it.

475
00:28:44,009 --> 00:28:45,844
No.

476
00:28:47,413 --> 00:28:49,381
I don't know.

477
00:28:56,122 --> 00:28:58,691
It's going to be
very expensive.

478
00:28:58,725 --> 00:29:00,693
I know.

479
00:29:28,154 --> 00:29:29,955
Dawn, I need you to get
me out of everything

480
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:31,758
through the weekend.

481
00:29:33,394 --> 00:29:35,028
It was a dumb idea.

482
00:29:36,697 --> 00:29:40,366
- Megan, can I have a moment?
- Oh, uh, sure.

483
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,770
Listen, there's
a Howard Johnson's upstate

484
00:29:45,606 --> 00:29:48,307
I thought we'd go and make
a long weekend of it.

485
00:29:48,341 --> 00:29:50,075
- What about Heinz?
- What about it?

486
00:29:50,109 --> 00:29:52,911
It'll be fine.
Remember California?

487
00:29:52,945 --> 00:29:55,480
- Two hotel rooms.
- Of course.

488
00:29:55,515 --> 00:29:58,416
- But we can go tomorrow.
- Come on.

489
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:01,786
Let's go right now.
We can do this.

490
00:30:01,821 --> 00:30:03,922
I don't know.

491
00:30:03,956 --> 00:30:05,957
I'm the boss.
I'm ordering you.

492
00:30:05,992 --> 00:30:07,859
Come on.

493
00:30:14,967 --> 00:30:18,335
You know it's like an hour
and a half from my parents.

494
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:19,970
They're coming to visit soon.

495
00:30:20,005 --> 00:30:22,606
I know.
You're right.

496
00:30:22,641 --> 00:30:24,674
And we don't have
to work much tonight.

497
00:30:24,709 --> 00:30:28,178
Someone named Dale is going to
give us the royal treatment.

498
00:30:28,212 --> 00:30:30,213
You like orange sherbet?

499
00:30:30,248 --> 00:30:32,549
- I don't know.
- You've never had it?

500
00:30:35,186 --> 00:30:37,987
- You are in for a treat.
- Sounds great.

501
00:30:38,022 --> 00:30:40,190
Everything okay?

502
00:30:40,192 --> 00:30:42,292
I'm just tired.

503
00:30:42,327 --> 00:30:44,728
So take a nap.
Relax.

504
00:30:44,762 --> 00:30:47,398
When you wake up, you will
feel like you're on vacation.

505
00:30:47,432 --> 00:30:50,568
You know what? Tell me more about
what we're going to be doing

506
00:30:50,602 --> 00:30:53,704
in Howard Johnson's
so I can get some sleep.

507
00:31:11,325 --> 00:31:13,293
Could you open your window?

508
00:31:20,367 --> 00:31:23,569
I wonder how Heinz went.
Peggy seemed nervous.

509
00:31:23,604 --> 00:31:25,404
Peggy knows what she's doing.

510
00:31:25,439 --> 00:31:26,906
What are you worrying
about that for?

511
00:31:27,974 --> 00:31:29,908
I feel like I abandoned
the team.

512
00:31:29,942 --> 00:31:33,010
You feel bad because you got to
take off and they had to work?

513
00:31:33,045 --> 00:31:34,912
<i>I don't.</i>

514
00:31:34,946 --> 00:31:36,880
There has to be some advantage
to being my wife.

515
00:31:40,152 --> 00:31:41,986
I'll check in with Peggy later.

516
00:31:42,021 --> 00:31:44,423
Okay.

517
00:31:49,229 --> 00:31:51,097
They got an indoor pool.

518
00:31:51,131 --> 00:31:52,599
Did you bring that
suit from Acapulco?

519
00:31:52,633 --> 00:31:54,267
I forgot.
I was rushing.

520
00:31:54,302 --> 00:31:56,503
We'll get you a new one after we check in.
I brought mine.

521
00:31:56,538 --> 00:31:58,305
- Mr. Draper?
- It's Don.

522
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:00,374
Pleased to meet you.
This is my wife Megan.

523
00:32:00,408 --> 00:32:02,142
Dale Vanderwort.

524
00:32:02,177 --> 00:32:04,679
A little more notice, I would have
rolled out the orange carpet.

525
00:32:04,713 --> 00:32:06,781
I've got your room
all set for you.

526
00:32:06,815 --> 00:32:09,517
Actually, I'd like something
to eat and something to drink.

527
00:32:09,551 --> 00:32:11,819
Sure, I'm going to bring you
a sampling of everything.

528
00:32:11,853 --> 00:32:14,555
- Do you like clams?
- I like everything.

529
00:32:33,808 --> 00:32:35,709
I got you something.

530
00:32:40,915 --> 00:32:44,050
I got one for Bobby and I got a
box of saltwater taffy for Sally.

531
00:32:44,085 --> 00:32:45,785
What did you get for gene?

532
00:32:45,819 --> 00:32:48,254
Sally will share
and she'll make Bobby share.

533
00:32:48,288 --> 00:32:50,622
I was the youngest, Don.
You can't forget about him.

534
00:32:50,656 --> 00:32:53,024
Trust me, he won't
know the difference.

535
00:32:53,059 --> 00:32:55,493
Didn't make much of a dent.
Anything to your liking?

536
00:32:55,528 --> 00:32:57,862
- We had a little of everything.
- Should I bring some desserts?

537
00:32:57,896 --> 00:32:59,697
Yes, how about some pie?

538
00:32:59,732 --> 00:33:02,333
No, you know what? Just three scoops
of orange sherbet and two spoons.

539
00:33:07,073 --> 00:33:09,308
The colors are bright
and cheerful.

540
00:33:09,343 --> 00:33:11,945
The kids have candy.
Full bar for mom and dad.

541
00:33:11,979 --> 00:33:14,548
Would you say it's
a delightful destination?

542
00:33:14,582 --> 00:33:16,584
It's not a destination.

543
00:33:16,618 --> 00:33:19,319
It's on the way to someplace.

544
00:33:19,353 --> 00:33:22,422
That's true.
It's a long car drive.

545
00:33:22,457 --> 00:33:24,791
Mom probably needs
to use the restroom.

546
00:33:24,826 --> 00:33:26,993
Kids get a look at the place,

547
00:33:27,028 --> 00:33:29,229
force them to stay.

548
00:33:29,263 --> 00:33:31,830
You like to work,
but I can't like to work?

549
00:33:33,967 --> 00:33:36,134
You should have told me
if it was so important to you.

550
00:33:36,169 --> 00:33:38,136
- We didn't have to go.
- I never got the chance.

551
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:40,873
It was in front of everyone.
And it's embarrassing.

552
00:33:40,907 --> 00:33:43,676
I ruined the whole damn thing by
pulling you off that crack team.

553
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:45,678
I am on the team.

554
00:33:45,713 --> 00:33:47,847
- Here we go.
- She's never tried it.

555
00:33:47,882 --> 00:33:50,450
- You're kidding.
- Try it.

556
00:33:57,492 --> 00:33:59,993
Oh, no, sorry.

557
00:34:00,027 --> 00:34:02,629
- It's not for everybody.
- It tastes like perfume to me.

558
00:34:02,663 --> 00:34:04,331
That's why we make 28 flavors.

559
00:34:04,365 --> 00:34:06,433
<i>Can I get a scoop of chocolate?</i>

560
00:34:09,537 --> 00:34:11,171
Really?

561
00:34:11,205 --> 00:34:12,839
I don't like it.

562
00:34:12,873 --> 00:34:15,008
There's no chance you're
trying to embarrass me?

563
00:34:15,042 --> 00:34:18,211
You're right.
I'm-- I'm sorry.

564
00:34:20,181 --> 00:34:22,849
Mmm, it's so delicious.

565
00:34:22,884 --> 00:34:24,551
Mm-Mmm!

566
00:34:24,585 --> 00:34:27,621
Mm, it's so good.

567
00:34:27,655 --> 00:34:29,122
Stop it.

568
00:34:30,458 --> 00:34:32,259
What's wrong with you?

569
00:34:33,795 --> 00:34:35,797
I'm sorry. Maybe you could
make up a little schedule

570
00:34:35,831 --> 00:34:38,032
so I'll know when I'm working
and when I'm your wife.

571
00:34:38,067 --> 00:34:39,534
It gets so confusing.

572
00:34:39,568 --> 00:34:42,102
I know, I'm terrible.
Making you eat ice cream.

573
00:34:43,138 --> 00:34:45,005
Why don't you call
your mother and hurl

574
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,208
a string of complaints at her
in French like you always do?

575
00:34:48,243 --> 00:34:50,877
- I'm always talking about you.
- The woman speaks English.

576
00:34:50,911 --> 00:34:52,745
Why don't you call your mother?

577
00:34:59,419 --> 00:35:00,986
Don.

578
00:35:05,392 --> 00:35:07,460
Do not walk away from me.

579
00:35:08,996 --> 00:35:11,398
- Get in the car.
- No, I am talking to you.

580
00:35:11,432 --> 00:35:13,634
Okay, don't get in the car.

581
00:35:13,668 --> 00:35:16,202
Go ahead.

582
00:35:16,237 --> 00:35:20,174
You care more what some truck stop
waitress thinks than what I say.

583
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:23,678
Get in the car.
Eat ice cream.

584
00:35:23,712 --> 00:35:25,513
Leave work.
Take off your dress.

585
00:35:25,548 --> 00:35:27,549
Yes, master.

586
00:35:30,787 --> 00:35:33,623
Don't you dare pull away!
I'm talking to you.

587
00:36:22,602 --> 00:36:25,405
Excuse me.
Was my wife just in here?

588
00:36:25,439 --> 00:36:27,807
- She was.
- Where'd she go?

589
00:36:27,842 --> 00:36:30,376
- I don't know.
- To the hotel?

590
00:36:30,411 --> 00:36:32,712
She was talking to
those fellas over there.

591
00:36:32,746 --> 00:36:34,680
They all left.

592
00:36:34,714 --> 00:36:37,082
They went towards
the parking lot together.

593
00:36:37,116 --> 00:36:39,418
I thought she
was looking for you.

594
00:37:10,182 --> 00:37:13,151
Wow, you're really
checking the place out.

595
00:37:13,186 --> 00:37:15,388
I've got your room key.

596
00:37:15,422 --> 00:37:16,989
Do you want help
with your bags?

597
00:37:17,024 --> 00:37:18,725
No. Did you give
my wife a key?

598
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,694
No. Do you want
another key?

599
00:37:22,497 --> 00:37:24,665
No.
I-- No.

600
00:37:24,699 --> 00:37:27,534
Uh, I have some bad news.

601
00:37:27,568 --> 00:37:30,169
- What?
- We closed the pool.

602
00:37:30,203 --> 00:37:32,305
Some kid had an accident.

603
00:37:32,339 --> 00:37:34,707
I swear it doesn't
happen a lot.

604
00:38:03,037 --> 00:38:05,571
- Oh, you took care of me, sir.
- No, can I get some dimes?

605
00:38:05,606 --> 00:38:07,440
Oh, le will let you
use the phone.

606
00:38:07,474 --> 00:38:08,707
That's okay.
Pay phone's fine.

607
00:38:08,742 --> 00:38:10,675
It's none of my business,

608
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:12,811
but couples fight in here
all the time.

609
00:38:12,845 --> 00:38:14,812
There's no reason
to think the worst.

610
00:38:14,847 --> 00:38:17,081
She probably got a ride
home with those kids.

611
00:38:23,087 --> 00:38:25,855
<i>Hello?</i> - Dawn didn't
get any calls. Did you get any calls?

612
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:28,358
- About what?
- Has anyone called you?

613
00:38:28,393 --> 00:38:30,193
I don't think so.

614
00:38:30,228 --> 00:38:32,362
Oh.

615
00:38:34,399 --> 00:38:37,267
- Okay.
- <i>Listen, it didn't go well.</i>

616
00:38:55,655 --> 00:38:57,656
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Marie.

617
00:38:57,690 --> 00:38:59,691
Hello, it's Don.

618
00:38:59,725 --> 00:39:01,693
<i>Hello.</i>
<i>Is everything all right?</i>

619
00:39:01,727 --> 00:39:03,328
Just wanted to call...

620
00:39:03,362 --> 00:39:05,964
to say hello

621
00:39:05,998 --> 00:39:08,634
and wanted to know
if Megan had called you.

622
00:39:08,668 --> 00:39:11,037
<i>Has Megan called</i>
<i>me tonight? No.</i>

623
00:39:11,071 --> 00:39:13,105
No. Huh.

624
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:15,442
<i>Don, are you still there?</i>

625
00:39:15,476 --> 00:39:18,312
Well, I wanted to buy her
some jewelry

626
00:39:18,346 --> 00:39:21,849
and I remembered that she had
an allergic reaction to metal,

627
00:39:21,884 --> 00:39:24,018
but I don't remember
if it's silver or gold.

628
00:39:24,053 --> 00:39:27,622
<i>Ah, 24 karat gold is fine</i>
<i>and so is sterling silver.</i>

629
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:29,224
Well, good.

630
00:39:29,258 --> 00:39:32,026
<i>What a fine husband you are.</i>
<i>It is only gold alloy--</i>

631
00:39:32,061 --> 00:39:34,995
Listen, Marie,
if she does call...

632
00:39:37,432 --> 00:39:39,132
Don't ruin the surprise, okay?

633
00:39:39,167 --> 00:39:41,467
- <i>Of course. Of course not.</i>
- Thank you.

634
00:39:42,703 --> 00:39:44,670
Okay.
<i>Au revoir.</i>

635
00:39:44,705 --> 00:39:46,672
<i>Nice talking to you, Don.</i>

636
00:39:54,081 --> 00:39:56,183
Are you okay?

637
00:39:56,217 --> 00:39:57,751
I'm sorry to do
that to you, sir,

638
00:39:57,786 --> 00:40:00,121
but they don't let patrons
sleep in the restaurant.

639
00:40:00,155 --> 00:40:02,524
No, no, of course not.

640
00:40:02,558 --> 00:40:04,493
What time is it?

641
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:06,662
It's a quarter to 2:00.

642
00:40:06,696 --> 00:40:08,597
Oh.

643
00:40:10,433 --> 00:40:12,902
Well, my wife, she--

644
00:40:14,972 --> 00:40:17,640
She's missing.
She took off from here.

645
00:40:17,675 --> 00:40:20,210
- When was this?
- I don't know.

646
00:40:22,347 --> 00:40:25,115
Almost seven hours ago.

647
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:28,719
Well, I'll be back
and forth here all morning.

648
00:40:28,754 --> 00:40:30,755
I'll keep an eye out.

649
00:41:09,221 --> 00:41:11,355
The Whitestone bridge to

650
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:15,026
the Hutchinson river
parkway to 95.

651
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:16,394
You cold?

652
00:41:16,428 --> 00:41:18,329
It's like I'm in shock.

653
00:41:20,065 --> 00:41:22,200
Where are we?

654
00:41:22,234 --> 00:41:24,068
Where are we going?

655
00:41:24,103 --> 00:41:25,970
To your new house.

656
00:41:26,004 --> 00:41:28,473
I don't want to go there.

657
00:41:28,507 --> 00:41:30,942
I don't want vacation to end.

658
00:41:30,976 --> 00:41:33,811
Me either.

659
00:41:33,846 --> 00:41:36,281
When can we go back?

660
00:41:36,315 --> 00:41:39,150
If you go to sleep, when you
wake up, I'll tell you.

661
00:41:57,369 --> 00:41:59,370
I thought you hated that song.

662
00:41:59,404 --> 00:42:01,038
You keep telling her
to stop singing it.

663
00:42:01,072 --> 00:42:02,873
And now it's stuck in my head.

664
00:42:25,164 --> 00:42:27,031
Megan.

665
00:42:28,534 --> 00:42:30,835
- Megan!
<i>- Go away!</i>

666
00:42:32,938 --> 00:42:35,173
- Op the door.
- <i>No.</i>

667
00:42:35,207 --> 00:42:37,041
Open the damn door.

668
00:42:37,076 --> 00:42:38,809
<i>I don't want to see you.</i>

669
00:42:38,844 --> 00:42:41,378
Open the door
or I'm gonna kick it in.

670
00:42:41,413 --> 00:42:43,680
<i>Leave me alone!</i>

671
00:42:52,089 --> 00:42:54,256
- Get out.
- I said I was sorry.

672
00:42:54,291 --> 00:42:56,592
- I don't care.
- Where the hell were you?

673
00:42:56,626 --> 00:42:58,860
I stopped every 20 miles
and called the apartment.

674
00:42:58,895 --> 00:43:00,228
Why didn't you answer
the goddamn phone?

675
00:43:00,263 --> 00:43:03,098
Because you're a pig!
You left me there!

676
00:43:03,132 --> 00:43:06,101
Where the hell were you?
I thought you were dead.

677
00:43:06,136 --> 00:43:08,437
Six and a half hours on a bus.

678
00:43:08,472 --> 00:43:12,075
And then try getting a cab at Port
Authority at 5:00 in the morning.

679
00:43:12,109 --> 00:43:13,810
Try getting anything
but an offer.

680
00:43:13,845 --> 00:43:15,779
I thought you were dead.

681
00:43:46,912 --> 00:43:49,915
How could you do that to me?

682
00:43:52,585 --> 00:43:54,786
I don't know.

683
00:43:54,821 --> 00:43:57,055
It was a fight.

684
00:43:58,358 --> 00:44:00,326
It's over.

685
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:01,994
No.

686
00:44:03,898 --> 00:44:07,634
Every time we fight, it just
diminishes us a little bit.

687
00:44:23,052 --> 00:44:25,020
I have to go to work.

688
00:44:35,066 --> 00:44:37,134
I thought I lost you.

689
00:45:08,632 --> 00:45:10,667
Mr. Draper.
I didn't expect you back.

690
00:45:10,701 --> 00:45:12,702
- How was your trip?
- Great.

691
00:45:12,736 --> 00:45:14,470
Would you like some coffee?

692
00:45:18,609 --> 00:45:22,078
- What's this? - Oh, Mr. Cooper
dropped those off this morning.

693
00:45:22,112 --> 00:45:23,846
- Bert Cooper?
- Yes.

694
00:45:23,881 --> 00:45:26,783
He's in the conference room.
Would you like me to get him?

695
00:45:34,493 --> 00:45:36,460
What the hell is this?

696
00:45:36,495 --> 00:45:40,031
A client left here
unhappy yesterday

697
00:45:40,065 --> 00:45:43,334
because you have a little
girl running everything.

698
00:45:43,368 --> 00:45:45,102
My department is fine.

699
00:45:45,137 --> 00:45:47,238
We just need more bodies,
but Lane won't let us.

700
00:45:47,272 --> 00:45:49,640
You've been on love leave.

701
00:45:49,674 --> 00:45:52,710
It's amazing things are
going as well as they are

702
00:45:52,744 --> 00:45:55,411
with as little
as you are doing.

703
00:45:55,446 --> 00:45:57,313
That's none of your business.

704
00:45:58,682 --> 00:46:01,451
This is my business.

705
00:46:23,008 --> 00:46:25,343
I have an announcement to make.

706
00:46:26,878 --> 00:46:28,979
It's going to be
a beautiful day.

707
00:46:43,141 --> 00:46:47,536
