<i>Previously on</i> Mad Men.

2
00:00:01,967 --> 00:00:03,710
When I told you,
you had everything...

3
00:00:04,685 --> 00:00:05,686
I was wrong.

4
00:00:05,828 --> 00:00:07,766
I'm serious Don,
don't talk to me about her.

5
00:00:07,944 --> 00:00:08,954
That makes me feel cruel.

6
00:00:11,097 --> 00:00:12,792
You always get what
you want don't you?

7
00:00:13,034 --> 00:00:14,034
I got you.

8
00:00:14,284 --> 00:00:15,806
Advertising... really?

9
00:00:16,598 --> 00:00:17,598
Work.

10
00:00:18,523 --> 00:00:20,140
I still don't understand what you do.

11
00:00:20,413 --> 00:00:22,350
Draper... who knows anything
about that guy?

12
00:00:22,538 --> 00:00:23,881
No one's ever lifted that rock.

13
00:00:24,223 --> 00:00:25,229
Dick?

14
00:00:25,505 --> 00:00:26,605
Richard Whipin?

15
00:00:27,941 --> 00:00:29,607
Holy smokes... is that you?

00:01:04,903 --> 00:01:06,588
Season 1 Episode 5
<i>Five G</i>

17
00:01:13,326 --> 00:01:15,250
Well, this will look good
in your office.

18
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:17,904
What, take that thing on the train

19
00:01:18,115 --> 00:01:19,736
like some kid who won at the four h?

20
00:01:21,406 --> 00:01:24,122
Besides, no one wants to look like
they care about awards.

22
00:01:25,338 --> 00:01:26,338
But you do.

24
00:01:29,781 --> 00:01:30,781
Isn't it sad?

25
00:01:31,908 --> 00:01:33,486
Roger was very eloquent.

26
00:01:36,267 --> 00:01:38,792
He likes to be recognized
for selling,

27
00:01:39,909 --> 00:01:41,082
creative is less important.

28
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,712
Creative helps sell.

29
00:01:44,972 --> 00:01:45,972
But he gave the speech.

30
00:01:48,784 --> 00:01:50,227
Look at you in this <i>Tuxedo</i>.

31
00:01:52,721 --> 00:01:53,721
Say it for me...

32
00:01:54,925 --> 00:01:56,509
Pleasure to meet you, mrs. Draper.

33
00:01:57,247 --> 00:01:58,346
Enchanted.

34
00:02:45,814 --> 00:02:46,972
It's 8 o'clock.

35
00:02:50,274 --> 00:02:51,349
Shit.

36
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:56,103
Oh, my lord.

37
00:02:58,952 --> 00:02:59,961
Mommy,

38
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,216
Ethel's downstairs,

39
00:03:02,492 --> 00:03:03,773
she's making us breakfast.

40
00:03:03,991 --> 00:03:05,362
Sally, mommy has a headache.

41
00:03:06,021 --> 00:03:07,689
What's that thing?

42
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,643
Daddy's boss won an award.

43
00:03:10,045 --> 00:03:11,179
Daddy won one too.

44
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:13,328
An award for good horses?

45
00:03:14,305 --> 00:03:16,268
Go downstairs and eat something.

46
00:03:20,546 --> 00:03:22,364
I think there's <i>Alka-Seltzer</i>
in the kitchen.

47
00:03:25,993 --> 00:03:26,993
Are you okay?

48
00:03:27,323 --> 00:03:30,372
Just do it in the kitchen,
I don't want to hear the bubbles.

49
00:03:43,659 --> 00:03:45,947
- Congratulations, mr. Draper.
- Thank you.

50
00:03:46,147 --> 00:03:47,920
I hear advertising age ran a picture.

51
00:03:48,678 --> 00:03:50,537
Fortunately, no one reads that.

52
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:55,136
That's really amazing.

53
00:03:56,804 --> 00:03:58,576
I'll get mr. Campbell and mr. Kinsey,

54
00:03:58,804 --> 00:04:01,135
they wanted you to know,
they were waiting but they left.

55
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,430
That's rude.

56
00:04:04,451 --> 00:04:07,108
They said something about the
new key award going to your head.

57
00:04:08,121 --> 00:04:09,916
- Congratulations by the way.
- Thank you.

58
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,135
- Congratulations to you too.
- Thank you, Peggy.

59
00:04:13,287 --> 00:04:14,297
Congratulations for what,

60
00:04:14,415 --> 00:04:16,224
being the only one on time
for this meeting?

61
00:04:16,354 --> 00:04:18,725
I was just telling Peggy,
I got a short story published.

62
00:04:19,556 --> 00:04:20,631
Good for you.

63
00:04:21,057 --> 00:04:22,507
With <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i>*.

64
00:04:23,205 --> 00:04:24,304
Look at that.

65
00:04:24,894 --> 00:04:26,011
Congratulations.

66
00:04:26,271 --> 00:04:27,302
Thank you.

67
00:04:27,469 --> 00:04:29,204
What does this have to
do with you, Kenny?

68
00:04:29,356 --> 00:04:31,505
"Tapping a maple on a
cold Vermont morning."

69
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,646
Cosgrove here got
a story published in the...

70
00:04:34,967 --> 00:04:35,977
<i>The Atlantic Monthly</i>

71
00:04:37,256 --> 00:04:38,523
You're kidding?

72
00:04:38,912 --> 00:04:40,213
I look forward to reading it.

73
00:04:40,619 --> 00:04:41,822
Keep it, I've got copies.

74
00:04:42,242 --> 00:04:43,242
Congrats indeed!

75
00:04:43,872 --> 00:04:44,932
A thing like that!

76
00:04:45,721 --> 00:04:47,682
You're a writer, you write?

77
00:04:49,143 --> 00:04:52,342
Yes. The weird thing is short fiction
is not my strong suit,

78
00:04:53,164 --> 00:04:54,164
I have two novels.

79
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,989
Novels, about what?

80
00:04:56,719 --> 00:04:59,161
One is about a roughneck
on an oil rig,

81
00:04:59,573 --> 00:05:01,213
who has to move to <i>Manhattan</i> because

82
00:05:01,473 --> 00:05:02,690
his wife's mother is sick.

83
00:05:02,931 --> 00:05:04,299
The other one is, well,

84
00:05:04,559 --> 00:05:05,810
a woman who's a widow,

85
00:05:05,994 --> 00:05:08,089
she kind of got stuck
with this family farm,

86
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:09,930
no one will help her
except this boy.

87
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:12,265
Those don't even sound stupid.

88
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,848
Thanks.

89
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:15,560
I mean, they both sound good.

90
00:05:15,923 --> 00:05:16,975
Want to read one?

91
00:05:17,912 --> 00:05:21,338
I do, but I also want to talk about
<i>Liberty Capital</i> savings.

92
00:05:22,037 --> 00:05:23,037
Right.

93
00:05:25,538 --> 00:05:26,836
Talk, one of you.

94
00:05:27,228 --> 00:05:29,574
As you know, <i>Jack Carney</i>* says
they want a new promotion,

95
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,249
interest rates are level,

96
00:05:31,521 --> 00:05:33,758
some kind of irresistible fireworks

97
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:36,306
that bring people to the bank,
even if it's just to visit.

98
00:05:36,505 --> 00:05:37,938
I hate it when they say fireworks.

99
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:40,544
Especially when they keep
talking about a toaster

100
00:05:40,743 --> 00:05:42,629
with a warming tray on top,
or a blender.

101
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:43,922
A blender's nice.

102
00:05:44,475 --> 00:05:47,010
Jack keeps talking about
escalating the toaster awards

103
00:05:47,225 --> 00:05:48,355
in order to lure women in,

104
00:05:48,537 --> 00:05:50,288
which is silly when
you think about it,

105
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:52,272
because other than
a few working girls,

106
00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:54,162
most women aren't in
charge of the banking.

107
00:05:54,289 --> 00:05:55,289
Not in my house.

108
00:05:55,444 --> 00:05:56,607
They visit the bank.

109
00:05:57,162 --> 00:05:58,162
They do.

110
00:05:59,852 --> 00:06:02,107
All we do is try to get the girls in,

111
00:06:02,789 --> 00:06:04,006
families,

112
00:06:05,276 --> 00:06:06,649
but you know what?

113
00:06:08,728 --> 00:06:09,990
Men need their own accounts,

114
00:06:10,978 --> 00:06:12,288
beyond the family.

115
00:06:12,648 --> 00:06:13,658
Men.

116
00:06:14,254 --> 00:06:16,993
I can see that, discretion,
discretionary.

117
00:06:17,727 --> 00:06:19,471
Statements sent to the office.

118
00:06:19,788 --> 00:06:20,788
Yes.

119
00:06:21,445 --> 00:06:24,263
<i>Liberty Capital</i> private account.

120
00:06:26,766 --> 00:06:27,769
No...

121
00:06:31,414 --> 00:06:32,596
Executive account.

122
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:35,862
That's why he won an award.

123
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,363
The accounts won the award.

124
00:06:44,828 --> 00:06:47,003
<i>I have a call for you
from Vics Biterbeck.</i>

125
00:06:52,157 --> 00:06:53,200
Hello, mr. Biterbeck.

126
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:56,661
It's me and don't ask who
or you'll spoil the mood.

127
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:01,833
Who's Vics?

128
00:07:02,093 --> 00:07:03,163
The trumpeter.

129
00:07:03,811 --> 00:07:06,421
I was thinking about playing
the horn this afternoon.

130
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:08,590
Where are you calling me from?

131
00:07:09,251 --> 00:07:10,675
<i>I just had a phone put in.</i>

132
00:07:13,856 --> 00:07:15,676
<i>Really, instant connection,</i>

133
00:07:16,152 --> 00:07:17,855
<i>just like that night
at the ticket booth</i>

134
00:07:18,042 --> 00:07:19,042
<i>in Grand Central.</i>

135
00:07:20,378 --> 00:07:21,645
<i>Midge, I'm at work.</i>

136
00:07:21,854 --> 00:07:22,859
<i>Just get down here.</i>

137
00:07:23,012 --> 00:07:25,213
<i>I want you to pull my hair
and ravish me,</i>

138
00:07:25,414 --> 00:07:26,595
<i>and leave me for dead.</i>

139
00:07:44,676 --> 00:07:45,877
I'll be back after lunch.

140
00:07:50,435 --> 00:07:53,570
Kenneth Cosgrove,
I think I'm gonna vomit.

141
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:56,867
Who in the hell is Ken Cosgrove?

142
00:07:57,164 --> 00:07:59,606
He's from Burlington, Vermont,
his father is a salesman.

143
00:07:59,804 --> 00:08:00,989
What the hell does that
have to do with it?

144
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:02,185
I can't believe he got published

145
00:08:02,445 --> 00:08:03,917
and didn't tell anyone,
until it came out.

146
00:08:04,155 --> 00:08:07,000
He kept walking around
like the idiot he is.

147
00:08:09,436 --> 00:08:12,254
I have this story about
this crazy night I had,

148
00:08:12,481 --> 00:08:15,179
where I ended up in Jersey city
with all these negroes,

149
00:08:15,447 --> 00:08:16,892
and we all got along,

150
00:08:17,523 --> 00:08:19,825
can you imagine
how good that story is?

151
00:08:20,607 --> 00:08:21,607
No.

152
00:08:23,228 --> 00:08:24,291
It is.

153
00:08:24,978 --> 00:08:26,331
It's a national magazine.

154
00:08:28,316 --> 00:08:29,561
That hurts too.

155
00:08:37,456 --> 00:08:38,456
That was it...

156
00:08:39,767 --> 00:08:41,211
That's what I called for.

157
00:08:41,892 --> 00:08:42,892
You can go.

158
00:08:47,088 --> 00:08:48,315
You can't call me at work.

159
00:08:49,845 --> 00:08:52,127
You're scared I'm gonna get
lonely all the time,

160
00:08:53,597 --> 00:08:55,656
start having conversations with you,

161
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:58,407
and ring you all the time saying,

162
00:08:58,661 --> 00:09:00,201
"when are you gonna come over?"

163
00:09:05,136 --> 00:09:06,798
This is working right now.

164
00:09:08,844 --> 00:09:10,264
And it worked today.

165
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,193
Look, I'm sorry your life is
in a million pieces,

166
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:18,881
it'd be easier for you
to have one less.

167
00:09:21,096 --> 00:09:22,474
I hurt your feelings.

168
00:09:26,597 --> 00:09:28,744
You didn't like my call a little bit?

169
00:09:29,658 --> 00:09:30,658
I'm here.

170
00:09:32,847 --> 00:09:34,407
And you waited until you were done

171
00:09:34,651 --> 00:09:36,556
to make me feel bad
about the phone call.

172
00:09:42,761 --> 00:09:44,320
I like that you come in here,

173
00:09:45,658 --> 00:09:47,134
acting like somebody else.

174
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:52,122
Must be so intense above 14th street.

175
00:09:54,408 --> 00:09:56,227
And you shoot down on the train...

176
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:01,445
That look, when I open that door,

177
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,294
sometimes you're preoccupied,
but then you always...

178
00:10:08,536 --> 00:10:09,536
Well you always...

179
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:12,041
Change gears.

180
00:10:16,286 --> 00:10:17,899
I don't even think about it.

181
00:10:20,035 --> 00:10:21,035
I know.

182
00:10:24,035 --> 00:10:25,654
I like being your medicine.

183
00:10:29,348 --> 00:10:30,348
Okay.

184
00:10:37,597 --> 00:10:38,923
What's wrong with it?

185
00:10:40,053 --> 00:10:41,847
Just tell me,
I can tell you don't like it.

186
00:10:42,063 --> 00:10:43,096
I do!

187
00:10:43,474 --> 00:10:46,663
And I love that you're sitting
alone at your typewriter,

188
00:10:46,943 --> 00:10:48,476
drinking a scotch, thinking it up.

189
00:10:49,474 --> 00:10:50,650
But you don't like it?

190
00:10:53,364 --> 00:10:55,086
I mostly read the classics,

191
00:10:55,472 --> 00:10:58,260
it seemed strange to me,
it's too modern.

192
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:01,034
Really?

193
00:11:02,538 --> 00:11:04,601
That's kind of a compliment,

194
00:11:05,351 --> 00:11:07,203
but I don't think you mean
it that way.

195
00:11:08,135 --> 00:11:10,081
I just think it's odd that
the bear is talking.

196
00:11:13,413 --> 00:11:14,854
The bear is not talking.

197
00:11:16,538 --> 00:11:19,551
It's what the hunter imagines
the bear to be thinking.

198
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,374
I's well written,
why don't you submit it?

199
00:11:27,826 --> 00:11:29,863
I was going to when
I finish dickering with it.

200
00:11:31,164 --> 00:11:33,023
You can run it by Charlie Fittich,

201
00:11:33,304 --> 00:11:36,009
he has one of those big
publishing jobs, doesn't he?

202
00:11:37,201 --> 00:11:39,849
Your friend, Laura, kept saying
how he makes things happen there.

203
00:11:40,105 --> 00:11:42,447
- Why would I do that?
- Because he can help us.

204
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:44,528
Call him, ask him
to look at the story.

205
00:11:44,725 --> 00:11:45,825
Why now?

206
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:49,228
Do you know who Ken Cosgrove is?

207
00:11:49,655 --> 00:11:51,956
He's an account executive
just like me,

208
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:53,412
did you know that?

209
00:11:54,302 --> 00:11:56,098
My father reads the damn <i>Atlantic</i>.

210
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,350
So what!

211
00:11:57,972 --> 00:11:59,276
You don't want to be a writer,

212
00:11:59,535 --> 00:12:00,621
I thought it was a hobby.

213
00:12:00,851 --> 00:12:03,377
He's out there,
people know who he is.

214
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:05,434
Pumpkin,

215
00:12:06,093 --> 00:12:07,098
Charlie Fittich?

216
00:12:08,576 --> 00:12:09,731
I'm surprised.

217
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:13,483
You can tell what this means to me.

218
00:12:18,274 --> 00:12:20,110
You said you'd do anything for me.

219
00:12:20,899 --> 00:12:22,366
I don't understand you.

220
00:12:22,606 --> 00:12:24,239
You were so upset when I told you.

221
00:12:24,771 --> 00:12:25,771
Told me about what?

222
00:12:26,087 --> 00:12:27,087
Peter...

223
00:12:27,461 --> 00:12:28,722
Told me about what?

224
00:12:31,342 --> 00:12:32,856
That he was my first.

225
00:12:36,411 --> 00:12:37,411
Well...

226
00:12:40,657 --> 00:12:41,709
This...

227
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,441
helps make up for that.

228
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:52,128
Let Charlie Fittich

229
00:12:53,011 --> 00:12:54,729
see what he's been missing.

230
00:12:58,586 --> 00:12:59,586
Okay.

231
00:13:08,027 --> 00:13:09,563
- Morning.
- Good morning.

232
00:13:09,773 --> 00:13:12,374
Traffic meeting is starting
in the conference room.

233
00:13:16,335 --> 00:13:17,335
Really?

234
00:13:17,712 --> 00:13:20,201
Cosgrove, I'm serious, I think
it shows tremendous fortitude,

235
00:13:20,329 --> 00:13:21,785
and I'd like to see more
of it around here,

236
00:13:21,925 --> 00:13:23,202
people finishing things.

237
00:13:23,901 --> 00:13:25,384
I guarantee that in the bottom drawer

238
00:13:25,534 --> 00:13:28,064
of every desk in this place
is the first ten pages of a novel.

239
00:13:28,093 --> 00:13:29,093
But?

240
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:31,715
The story itself was not
much to my liking,

241
00:13:31,899 --> 00:13:34,814
but I think it showed an
uncanny understanding

242
00:13:34,969 --> 00:13:36,060
of what most people like.

243
00:13:36,776 --> 00:13:37,776
I guess so.

244
00:13:38,272 --> 00:13:40,054
What'd you get paid
for that, $100 bucks?

245
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:41,228
About that.

246
00:13:41,835 --> 00:13:43,182
Ought to keep you working here.

247
00:13:44,401 --> 00:13:47,228
So, miss Holloway,
would you like to take the reins?

248
00:13:47,585 --> 00:13:49,699
Let's start with maytag, mr. Cosgrove.

249
00:13:50,087 --> 00:13:52,767
You want to complain about the copy
now that you're a big writer?

250
00:13:54,148 --> 00:13:55,900
Production needs 50 percent up front,

251
00:13:56,061 --> 00:13:57,248
and we're waiting on a check.

252
00:13:57,508 --> 00:13:59,739
And when will you be calling
the client about that?

253
00:14:00,136 --> 00:14:01,529
I spoke with them last week, and

254
00:14:02,346 --> 00:14:04,102
I'll check with them
again this afternoon.

255
00:14:04,274 --> 00:14:05,506
Aren't you good.

256
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:06,900
Rio de Janeiro?

257
00:14:07,725 --> 00:14:09,378
The double page spread
we ran in life,

258
00:14:09,527 --> 00:14:11,397
and town and country,
was so successful

259
00:14:11,586 --> 00:14:13,890
they want to resize the ad
to run in <i>Reader's Digest</i>.

260
00:14:14,498 --> 00:14:16,226
- Big ad.
- Little magazine.

261
00:14:16,486 --> 00:14:17,489
Sal's problem.

262
00:14:17,942 --> 00:14:18,978
<i>Lucky Strike</i>?

263
00:14:21,132 --> 00:14:23,191
Sales are great, lawsuit is pending,

264
00:14:23,451 --> 00:14:25,107
you're the one who's supposed
to keep an eye out

265
00:14:25,295 --> 00:14:27,819
- on what's happening in Washington.
- After the election.

266
00:14:29,918 --> 00:14:31,975
I'm sorry, do you mind?

267
00:14:33,256 --> 00:14:35,342
I'll take any excuse to get out
of this meeting.

268
00:14:36,128 --> 00:14:37,664
His name is Adam Wigman.

269
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:47,006
Tell him... where is he?

270
00:14:47,266 --> 00:14:48,341
Reception.

271
00:14:50,318 --> 00:14:51,318
I should...

272
00:14:52,202 --> 00:14:53,221
I have to deal with this.

273
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,690
Sure-sure, you better come back now.

274
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,338
- I got this.
- Okay.

275
00:15:06,664 --> 00:15:07,756
Can I help you?

276
00:15:14,256 --> 00:15:15,326
Can I help you?

277
00:15:16,566 --> 00:15:17,566
It's you.

278
00:15:19,504 --> 00:15:20,504
It's really you.

279
00:15:21,247 --> 00:15:22,252
Dick,

280
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:24,438
I can't believe it.

281
00:15:27,101 --> 00:15:28,715
I don't know what
you're talking about.

282
00:15:28,971 --> 00:15:30,993
I know, I'm grown up,
but Dick, it's me,

283
00:15:32,757 --> 00:15:33,757
it's Adam...

284
00:15:35,578 --> 00:15:36,597
Your little brother.

285
00:15:38,754 --> 00:15:39,754
It's Don.

286
00:15:42,181 --> 00:15:43,521
It says Donald Draper,

287
00:15:44,106 --> 00:15:45,231
but I knew it was you.

288
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:50,697
Are you upset?

289
00:15:51,382 --> 00:15:52,382
Are you mad at me?

290
00:15:52,596 --> 00:15:54,051
I don't even know who you are.

291
00:15:54,572 --> 00:15:55,992
I know I look different,

292
00:15:56,819 --> 00:15:58,418
I grew up tall, okay?

293
00:15:59,505 --> 00:16:00,709
But it's me, Dick.

294
00:16:01,945 --> 00:16:04,079
Look, I'm a janitor at
<i>American Calculator</i>

295
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:05,690
in the Empire State Building,

296
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:09,130
and I found this in someone's trash,
I thought I saw a ghost.

297
00:16:10,008 --> 00:16:12,279
I think you've mistaken me
for someone else.

298
00:16:14,217 --> 00:16:15,514
You can't even look at me.

299
00:16:19,265 --> 00:16:21,851
Okay, you're at work,
I can come back another time.

300
00:16:23,633 --> 00:16:24,633
No.

301
00:16:27,632 --> 00:16:30,485
There's a coffee shop three blocks
west of here,

302
00:16:30,746 --> 00:16:31,751
<i>Delight,</i>

303
00:16:33,073 --> 00:16:34,197
I'll meet you there at noon.

304
00:16:34,457 --> 00:16:35,471
That's swell.

305
00:17:22,538 --> 00:17:25,092
and everything's all set for
the <i>Liberty Capital</i> meeting?

306
00:17:29,926 --> 00:17:31,161
Yes, of course, all set.

307
00:17:31,678 --> 00:17:33,059
Well, thank you all.

308
00:17:33,277 --> 00:17:35,047
I'm glad everybody could
make it sound like

309
00:17:35,212 --> 00:17:36,213
they're working so hard.

310
00:18:09,685 --> 00:18:11,380
I can't believe this,

311
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:13,433
it is really you.

312
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:24,640
What do you want from me?

313
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,946
I don't understand this.

314
00:18:27,997 --> 00:18:29,466
You have nothing to say to me?

315
00:18:30,248 --> 00:18:31,509
Nothing to ask me?

316
00:18:33,187 --> 00:18:35,789
Dick, I thought you were dead

317
00:18:36,006 --> 00:18:37,153
and you're right here.

318
00:18:38,812 --> 00:18:39,812
That's not me.

319
00:18:42,561 --> 00:18:44,001
Can't you even say my name?

320
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:47,875
Adam...

321
00:18:49,873 --> 00:18:50,873
That's not me.

322
00:18:51,937 --> 00:18:52,937
It is.

323
00:18:54,626 --> 00:18:55,924
What happened to you?

324
00:18:58,252 --> 00:18:59,416
Why did you do that?

325
00:19:01,061 --> 00:19:02,265
Why did you leave me?

326
00:19:05,002 --> 00:19:06,390
I couldn't go back there.

327
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,150
I knew you weren't dead.

328
00:19:16,938 --> 00:19:19,692
I knew I saw you that day, hiding
in the window in your uniform.

329
00:19:20,563 --> 00:19:22,823
I was only eight but
I knew it was you.

330
00:19:23,937 --> 00:19:25,316
That was a long time ago.

331
00:19:25,857 --> 00:19:28,111
I can't believe when I saw
that picture in the paper,

332
00:19:28,308 --> 00:19:29,867
I thought, it looks exactly like him,

333
00:19:30,062 --> 00:19:31,229
except around the eyes.

334
00:19:32,877 --> 00:19:34,203
Donald Draper?

335
00:19:35,813 --> 00:19:37,401
What kind of name is that?

336
00:19:38,307 --> 00:19:40,967
What difference does it make?
People change their names.

337
00:19:41,561 --> 00:19:42,561
I guess.

338
00:19:47,001 --> 00:19:48,307
What happened to her?

339
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:49,767
Mom?

340
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,478
She wasn't my mother,

341
00:19:52,377 --> 00:19:54,146
she never let me forget that.

342
00:19:54,406 --> 00:19:55,437
She's gone...

343
00:19:57,606 --> 00:19:58,846
Stomach cancer.

344
00:20:00,376 --> 00:20:01,376
Good.

345
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:03,572
Uncle Mac took it pretty hard,

346
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:05,037
he passed too.

347
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:09,495
Are you sure you don't
want anything?

348
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:13,820
I know I've got this lump
in my throat,

349
00:20:15,563 --> 00:20:17,258
I'd love to eat right now,
but I can't.

350
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,938
Did you miss me at all?

351
00:20:31,128 --> 00:20:32,128
Of course I did.

352
00:20:35,124 --> 00:20:36,124
It's good to see you.

353
00:20:36,626 --> 00:20:37,626
You look well.

354
00:20:38,175 --> 00:20:39,783
I would of rather had
lunch with you.

355
00:20:40,012 --> 00:20:41,599
I know, but I have an appointment

356
00:20:41,805 --> 00:20:43,582
with the decorator for
our new apartment,

357
00:20:44,301 --> 00:20:45,977
another time, I promise.

358
00:20:56,807 --> 00:20:58,377
You said you enjoyed the story.

359
00:20:59,362 --> 00:21:00,362
Yes, I did,

360
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:03,716
as much as anyone can
enjoy that kind of thing.

361
00:21:04,113 --> 00:21:05,981
So, you like it or you didn't like it?

362
00:21:06,434 --> 00:21:07,658
It doesn't matter

363
00:21:08,574 --> 00:21:10,139
that I publish it, right?

364
00:21:11,052 --> 00:21:12,052
Yes, it does.

365
00:21:14,801 --> 00:21:16,354
Have you been seeing Laura Still?

366
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,901
Yes, she's terrific,

367
00:21:20,122 --> 00:21:21,677
- fun.
- She really is.

368
00:21:33,339 --> 00:21:34,870
I want to talk to you
about something

369
00:21:35,049 --> 00:21:36,374
that has nothing to do with this.

370
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:38,421
Okay.

371
00:21:40,047 --> 00:21:41,047
I miss you.

372
00:21:43,172 --> 00:21:45,203
I miss being with you.

373
00:21:48,048 --> 00:21:49,929
That's very sweet to hear.

374
00:21:50,485 --> 00:21:51,811
I know you're married.

375
00:21:53,674 --> 00:21:56,353
It doesn't have to be more
than just being with you.

376
00:21:59,236 --> 00:22:00,236
I can't.

377
00:22:01,735 --> 00:22:02,735
Charlie, I...

378
00:22:05,549 --> 00:22:07,810
No, I can't, I'm a newlywed.

379
00:22:11,111 --> 00:22:13,635
Maybe like in some movie,

380
00:22:14,661 --> 00:22:16,957
sometime in the future
when we're old, maybe then.

381
00:22:17,466 --> 00:22:19,278
I want you now,
I don't want you old,

382
00:22:19,737 --> 00:22:20,737
I want you now.

383
00:22:22,485 --> 00:22:24,198
I know you'll never leave him.

384
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:29,060
I can keep a secret.

385
00:22:32,674 --> 00:22:33,674
No, Charlie...

386
00:22:35,277 --> 00:22:36,291
Please.

387
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,047
Sally, don't run.

388
00:22:41,281 --> 00:22:42,288
Okay.

389
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:43,550
Hello.

390
00:22:43,802 --> 00:22:44,802
Hello.

391
00:22:45,051 --> 00:22:47,040
My goodness, you're mrs. Draper,
aren't you?

392
00:22:47,301 --> 00:22:48,764
Hello, you must be Peggy.

393
00:22:49,024 --> 00:22:50,072
I recognized your voice.

394
00:22:50,863 --> 00:22:52,515
So nice to finally meet you
in person.

395
00:22:54,363 --> 00:22:55,929
This is Sally and Robert,

396
00:22:56,861 --> 00:22:58,117
we're here for our portrait.

397
00:22:58,326 --> 00:22:59,331
Of course,

398
00:22:59,876 --> 00:23:01,002
I guess I knew that.

399
00:23:04,426 --> 00:23:05,428
Is he in there?

400
00:23:06,807 --> 00:23:08,957
Not right now, but please go inside.

401
00:23:13,174 --> 00:23:14,566
I'll be right back.

402
00:23:40,926 --> 00:23:41,926
Joan?

403
00:23:43,613 --> 00:23:45,105
My god, Joan, I need your help.

404
00:23:45,321 --> 00:23:47,101
- Let go of me.
- Mrs. Draper is here,

405
00:23:47,298 --> 00:23:48,948
and they're having
their portrait taken,

406
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:51,091
and he snuck out, and
I don't know who to lie to.

407
00:23:51,239 --> 00:23:53,427
Calm down, just breath slowly.

408
00:23:54,147 --> 00:23:55,556
Mr. Draper is out and I don't think

409
00:23:55,673 --> 00:23:57,082
I'm supposed to know where he went.

410
00:23:57,089 --> 00:23:58,089
That happens.

411
00:23:58,093 --> 00:23:59,443
But they're taking
their pictures today,

412
00:23:59,549 --> 00:24:00,676
and I would of reminded him,

413
00:24:00,817 --> 00:24:02,190
but he slipped out before I could.

414
00:24:02,325 --> 00:24:04,332
It's his fault, he comes and goes,
and never says anything.

415
00:24:04,399 --> 00:24:05,400
Where is he?

416
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,568
If I make an excuse to mrs. Draper,
she could catch him in it,

417
00:24:07,685 --> 00:24:09,071
especially if she just leaves,

418
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:11,570
or even worse, then he'll know
that I know where he was.

419
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:13,614
Where is he?

420
00:24:15,025 --> 00:24:16,033
I don't know.

421
00:24:16,425 --> 00:24:19,066
You do know, and
you're going to tell me,

422
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,326
or I'm not going to tell you what to do.

423
00:24:22,904 --> 00:24:24,959
- I can't believe you.
- Well?

424
00:24:27,414 --> 00:24:28,712
He sees this woman.

425
00:24:29,427 --> 00:24:30,589
He saw her the other day.

426
00:24:31,528 --> 00:24:33,092
He came back all greasy and calm.

427
00:24:33,352 --> 00:24:34,354
No.

428
00:24:34,608 --> 00:24:37,369
God, now I told you. I'm the
worst secretary in the world.

429
00:24:37,715 --> 00:24:39,682
- Who is she?
- I don't care... please hurry.

430
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:46,105
Peggy, use your noodle.

431
00:24:46,277 --> 00:24:47,640
You're making this so complicated.

432
00:24:47,828 --> 00:24:50,000
You go out there and you
entertain her and the brats.

433
00:24:50,154 --> 00:24:51,607
Get some hershey bars from the cart,

434
00:24:51,779 --> 00:24:53,091
and tell her that you don't know
where he is,

435
00:24:53,232 --> 00:24:54,738
and you forgot to remind him,
it is the truth,

436
00:24:54,998 --> 00:24:57,053
and when he comes back,
let him have an excuse,

437
00:24:57,278 --> 00:24:58,278
he'll have one.

438
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,430
And you'll just start
apologizing for, well,

439
00:25:01,966 --> 00:25:03,591
just how stupid you are.

440
00:25:05,505 --> 00:25:08,041
That's probably what
I would of done anyway.

441
00:25:09,203 --> 00:25:11,072
God, now I really
shouldn't of told you.

442
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:13,107
You shouldn't of told me.

443
00:25:13,725 --> 00:25:15,493
I'm not gonna tell anybody, but

444
00:25:15,675 --> 00:25:17,553
you shouldn't of told anybody that.

445
00:25:24,958 --> 00:25:26,729
This isn't how I imagined it.

446
00:25:28,141 --> 00:25:30,566
- I'm sorry.
- You keep saying you're sorry.

447
00:25:31,951 --> 00:25:33,861
Where were you all this time?

448
00:25:35,578 --> 00:25:37,193
Around, here mostly.

449
00:25:38,795 --> 00:25:40,159
I'm not mad at you,

450
00:25:40,603 --> 00:25:42,001
I just want to know.

451
00:25:43,201 --> 00:25:45,040
I mean, look at you.

452
00:25:46,868 --> 00:25:48,465
Who is, Donald Draper?

453
00:25:51,522 --> 00:25:52,671
I mean, do you have a wife,

454
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,929
kids?

455
00:25:58,701 --> 00:25:59,952
I'm gonna go.

456
00:26:03,329 --> 00:26:04,329
That's it?

457
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:06,467
Want me to pay for lunch?

458
00:26:07,414 --> 00:26:08,594
- No.
- Let me.

459
00:26:08,841 --> 00:26:09,938
You didn't have anything.

460
00:26:10,472 --> 00:26:12,358
I don't understand why
you're being like this.

461
00:26:12,869 --> 00:26:15,845
When I was little, I used to imagine
this day happening, and here it is.

462
00:26:16,077 --> 00:26:17,613
I don't understand... I'm family.

463
00:26:18,141 --> 00:26:20,035
I just want to be
a part of your life.

464
00:26:22,951 --> 00:26:24,662
Adam, that's not gonna happen.

465
00:26:25,952 --> 00:26:28,123
I'm gonna walk out that door.
That's it.

466
00:26:29,076 --> 00:26:30,780
I'm not buying your lunch,

467
00:26:31,952 --> 00:26:33,793
because this never happened.

468
00:26:44,268 --> 00:26:46,085
I don't like black licorice either.

469
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:49,528
Are you sure we should wait?

470
00:26:49,747 --> 00:26:50,854
I think so,

471
00:26:51,114 --> 00:26:52,829
I can't believe I forgot.

472
00:26:53,742 --> 00:26:54,969
Are you missing your lunch?

473
00:26:55,122 --> 00:26:56,900
No, it's okay, I brought it.

474
00:26:57,807 --> 00:26:59,586
Well, you'll probably
be going out tonight,

475
00:26:59,764 --> 00:27:00,864
might as well take it easy.

476
00:27:01,104 --> 00:27:02,119
That's true.

477
00:27:07,368 --> 00:27:08,372
Do you have a boyfriend,

478
00:27:08,901 --> 00:27:09,911
a steady?

479
00:27:10,676 --> 00:27:12,966
No, I work a lot.

480
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,179
Some blind dates.

481
00:27:15,742 --> 00:27:17,146
I remember those...

482
00:27:17,867 --> 00:27:18,867
The disappointments.

483
00:27:25,306 --> 00:27:26,390
Mr. Draper's office.

484
00:27:26,681 --> 00:27:27,681
How's it going?

485
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:30,722
No thank you, I'm staying in.

486
00:27:35,995 --> 00:27:37,470
Mr. Draper treating you well?

487
00:27:37,744 --> 00:27:39,657
Yes, he's been very patient

488
00:27:39,869 --> 00:27:42,072
while I've been learning
the ropes around here.

489
00:27:42,992 --> 00:27:45,743
Don't you just hate it when
his mouth runs on and on?

490
00:27:46,243 --> 00:27:47,243
Excuse me?

491
00:27:48,557 --> 00:27:49,773
I'm joking.

492
00:27:50,745 --> 00:27:52,875
You probably know more
about him than I do.

493
00:27:57,306 --> 00:27:59,339
You look so beautiful in that light,

494
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:01,971
you should take
the picture right there.

495
00:28:04,604 --> 00:28:06,243
I did want to look good.

496
00:28:08,681 --> 00:28:10,142
Mr. Draper, I...

497
00:28:12,993 --> 00:28:14,313
- The portrait.
- What happened,

498
00:28:15,374 --> 00:28:17,288
where were you?
We were just about to leave.

499
00:28:17,494 --> 00:28:19,610
I'm so embarrassed,
I forgot to remind you.

500
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:22,342
No, I forgot to check in
before I went to the printer.

501
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:24,738
I'm such a fool, I don't know
where my head is.

502
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:27,134
I'm so sorry, mrs. Draper,
please forgive me.

503
00:28:27,319 --> 00:28:28,376
No, it's nothing.

504
00:28:28,494 --> 00:28:30,937
All we need is some wet paper towels
to get the chocolate off,

505
00:28:31,007 --> 00:28:32,147
before we go in front of the lens.

506
00:28:32,253 --> 00:28:33,580
We'll have to do that on the way,

507
00:28:33,697 --> 00:28:35,823
they must be waiting for us
at the studio, come on.

508
00:28:36,844 --> 00:28:37,878
Nice to meet you.

509
00:28:41,744 --> 00:28:42,829
Don't worry about that.

510
00:28:43,057 --> 00:28:44,061
Thank you.

511
00:28:50,849 --> 00:28:52,100
They're terrible.

512
00:28:52,537 --> 00:28:53,537
No, they're not.

513
00:28:54,055 --> 00:28:56,163
Don was late, it ruined
the whole thing.

514
00:28:56,656 --> 00:28:58,232
Carleton's always late.

515
00:29:00,412 --> 00:29:02,020
You can see what's important
to them.

516
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:04,930
We are very important
to them, stop it.

517
00:29:05,975 --> 00:29:08,556
How'd you like to be in
Helen Bishop's family portrait?

518
00:29:08,785 --> 00:29:10,575
There's a big hole there,
believe me.

519
00:29:14,848 --> 00:29:16,845
I want to take them again anyway.

520
00:29:17,538 --> 00:29:18,766
Sally looks fat.

521
00:29:19,971 --> 00:29:21,205
I don't think so.

522
00:29:22,011 --> 00:29:24,216
The worst part is,
Don will think they're fine.

523
00:29:24,661 --> 00:29:25,968
Here, maybe this one.

524
00:29:26,349 --> 00:29:27,349
Blow that one up.

525
00:29:27,536 --> 00:29:29,362
It will hold you until
the Christmas card.

526
00:29:29,823 --> 00:29:31,056
The color is off on these too.

527
00:29:32,209 --> 00:29:33,209
Am I wrong?

528
00:29:34,772 --> 00:29:37,729
I really expect the royal treatment
when I go to Don's office,

529
00:29:37,959 --> 00:29:39,375
and I seldom get it.

530
00:29:41,148 --> 00:29:43,569
It's like walking into
another country,

531
00:29:43,829 --> 00:29:45,779
where I don't speak the language.

532
00:29:46,459 --> 00:29:48,694
At Carleton's, I feel like I'm stupid,

533
00:29:49,023 --> 00:29:50,730
all that manhattan talk.

534
00:29:54,335 --> 00:29:55,610
Our husbands...

535
00:29:57,521 --> 00:29:59,504
They're our better out here,
aren't they?

536
00:30:00,021 --> 00:30:01,249
Infinitely.

537
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:05,215
We took your idea of product,
and applied it directly to the bank.

538
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,360
Banking products not
household products.

539
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:09,178
You said banking products
weren't sexy.

540
00:30:09,899 --> 00:30:11,801
We went down some
really dumb roads like

541
00:30:12,024 --> 00:30:13,502
bank accounts for children,

542
00:30:14,084 --> 00:30:15,847
and then Don here had this

543
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:18,812
roaming candle of an idea, Don?

544
00:30:20,961 --> 00:30:22,980
I think Paul has a handle on this.

545
00:30:30,337 --> 00:30:33,845
The modern executive is a busy man,

546
00:30:34,897 --> 00:30:36,597
he leads a complicated life.

547
00:30:36,796 --> 00:30:38,315
He has business expenses,

548
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:39,877
family, leisure,

549
00:30:40,587 --> 00:30:42,630
how are you supposed
to keep all that straight?

550
00:30:43,147 --> 00:30:44,713
Well, now <i>Liberty Capital</i>

551
00:30:44,973 --> 00:30:46,590
is gonna help you with that.

552
00:30:48,849 --> 00:30:49,870
What is this?

553
00:30:50,395 --> 00:30:52,801
An account for a man that is private,

554
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:57,143
the statements come to
the office, not your home.

555
00:30:57,516 --> 00:31:00,568
I see, for organizing your life.

556
00:31:00,898 --> 00:31:01,898
If it needs it.

557
00:31:02,097 --> 00:31:03,398
Liberty for the libertine.

558
00:31:04,271 --> 00:31:05,275
That's good.

559
00:31:05,535 --> 00:31:06,579
Does this say that to you?

560
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,598
It will if you put
the word private in there,

561
00:31:08,786 --> 00:31:11,581
instead of Liberty,
executive private account.

562
00:31:15,183 --> 00:31:16,328
What are you laughing at?

563
00:31:16,586 --> 00:31:18,220
A portion of our customers
are already,

564
00:31:18,396 --> 00:31:19,447
I believe, doing this,

565
00:31:19,576 --> 00:31:20,707
there's just no name for it,

566
00:31:20,967 --> 00:31:23,028
and we had no way to charge them.

567
00:31:23,649 --> 00:31:26,865
I like the torch,
it says don't get burned.

568
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:29,214
It could start some
uncomfortable conversations

569
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:30,467
in a lot of homes, but,

570
00:31:31,962 --> 00:31:33,688
It's better than a calendar.

571
00:31:33,945 --> 00:31:35,396
Let's talk placement.

572
00:31:37,148 --> 00:31:38,148
Hello.

573
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:41,100
I opened everything but that one.

574
00:32:11,459 --> 00:32:13,468
One is about a roughneck
on an oil rig,

575
00:32:13,728 --> 00:32:15,231
who has to move to Manhattan

576
00:32:15,435 --> 00:32:16,763
because his wife's mother's sick.

577
00:32:17,587 --> 00:32:18,709
The other is about...

578
00:32:18,917 --> 00:32:20,696
You know, I just finished reading it,

579
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,037
it's really a great story.

580
00:32:24,416 --> 00:32:26,222
Thank you, that means a lot.

581
00:32:26,852 --> 00:32:28,358
It's nice to see someone's passion be

582
00:32:28,883 --> 00:32:29,951
rewarded.

583
00:32:31,327 --> 00:32:32,362
You know what?

584
00:32:32,979 --> 00:32:34,614
I don't have a copy of it,

585
00:32:35,806 --> 00:32:38,201
and I wanted to give it

586
00:32:39,305 --> 00:32:40,704
to my girlfriend.

587
00:32:43,355 --> 00:32:45,834
You said you got
like 50 more copies, right?

588
00:32:46,231 --> 00:32:47,236
Maybe I do,

589
00:32:47,541 --> 00:32:49,796
if not, it's on every
newsstand in town.

590
00:32:50,353 --> 00:32:51,353
Good to hear.

591
00:33:04,541 --> 00:33:05,739
You're leaving?

592
00:33:06,416 --> 00:33:07,879
Yes, for the day.

593
00:33:08,481 --> 00:33:09,481
Okay.

594
00:33:10,353 --> 00:33:12,944
I'm going home. You can reach me
there if necessary.

595
00:33:17,915 --> 00:33:20,150
I always wondered
why he's ignored me,

596
00:33:21,405 --> 00:33:22,861
probably cause he's so good looking,

597
00:33:22,955 --> 00:33:25,040
he can go outside the office
for whatever he wants,

598
00:33:25,692 --> 00:33:27,042
most of these fellows can't.

599
00:33:28,449 --> 00:33:29,789
He seemed different to me.

600
00:33:30,244 --> 00:33:32,026
Well, either way, you have
to do your job.

601
00:33:32,634 --> 00:33:35,045
Keep his record clean
here and at home,

602
00:33:35,291 --> 00:33:37,969
honestly, if he sees that in you,
you are a solid gold.

603
00:33:39,259 --> 00:33:40,405
That's my job?

604
00:33:40,927 --> 00:33:41,932
Yes,

605
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:45,174
that's his private life... private,

606
00:33:46,386 --> 00:33:49,371
that's how these men are,
and it's why we love them.

607
00:33:50,143 --> 00:33:52,150
- I don't love him.
- Fine,

608
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:53,830
look if you're even thinking about

609
00:33:53,959 --> 00:33:55,821
passing judgement, then you're
in the wrong business.

610
00:33:57,075 --> 00:33:59,157
- Okay.
- You need to relax.

611
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:01,116
I have never come over here

612
00:34:01,261 --> 00:34:04,287
and not seen you with a look on your
face that said, "I need a drink."

613
00:34:06,592 --> 00:34:07,843
This job is odd.

614
00:34:08,385 --> 00:34:09,732
But it's the best.

615
00:34:12,218 --> 00:34:13,218
Listen, kenny.

616
00:34:13,795 --> 00:34:14,798
- What?
- Listen,

617
00:34:15,058 --> 00:34:16,646
I know I've been a bear,

618
00:34:16,842 --> 00:34:19,208
but I've been competing
neck and neck

619
00:34:19,407 --> 00:34:20,862
with people in this place,

620
00:34:21,874 --> 00:34:23,974
I didn't know I was competing
with you too.

621
00:34:26,967 --> 00:34:28,019
You lost.

622
00:34:39,767 --> 00:34:40,842
Hello, sweetheart.

623
00:34:41,032 --> 00:34:42,032
Hello, dear.

624
00:34:54,219 --> 00:34:57,132
Well, I have some good news.

625
00:35:00,094 --> 00:35:02,262
Charlie Fittich came
by the house this afternoon.

626
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:03,533
Did he, here?

627
00:35:04,377 --> 00:35:06,162
I guess your lunch did go well.

628
00:35:06,728 --> 00:35:08,701
Wasn't lunch, I told you that.

629
00:35:11,059 --> 00:35:12,914
So what did he say? Don't tease me.

630
00:35:13,993 --> 00:35:15,859
He said he was going
to get you published.

631
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:17,796
That is incredibly swell news!

632
00:35:18,093 --> 00:35:19,093
When... where?

633
00:35:19,258 --> 00:35:20,632
<i>Boys Life</i>* magazine.

634
00:35:21,283 --> 00:35:22,283
What?

635
00:35:22,625 --> 00:35:25,643
It's a $40 fee, and
a lot of people read it.

636
00:35:26,531 --> 00:35:28,418
Are you kidding me, <i>Boys Life</i>?

637
00:35:31,005 --> 00:35:33,168
That story was good enough
for <i>The New Yorker</i>*,

638
00:35:33,428 --> 00:35:36,080
and don't act like those magazines
do everything on merit.

639
00:35:36,782 --> 00:35:38,452
I thought you'd be happy.

640
00:35:39,405 --> 00:35:40,821
For a year's work.

641
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:46,684
You don't want me
to have what I want?

642
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:49,622
You're going to be published.

643
00:35:50,657 --> 00:35:51,657
<i>Boys Life</i>...

644
00:35:52,782 --> 00:35:56,553
Probably next to some ad
for exploding cigars.

645
00:36:00,755 --> 00:36:02,681
I could of gotten you
in <i>The New Yorker</i>,

646
00:36:02,945 --> 00:36:05,457
or in the encyclopedia
brittanica if I wanted to.

647
00:36:07,556 --> 00:36:10,475
So, why didn't you?

648
00:36:12,996 --> 00:36:14,931
Why would you do that to me?

649
00:36:15,996 --> 00:36:18,184
Why would you put me
in that position?

650
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:35,424
I talked to my father
about the house in <i>Cape May</i>.

651
00:36:35,997 --> 00:36:38,306
He said our dates are good,
august won't be a problem.

652
00:36:38,612 --> 00:36:39,746
That's good.

653
00:36:41,619 --> 00:36:43,549
I wish it wasn't so far
from the city,

654
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:45,444
then we'd see more of you.

655
00:36:46,634 --> 00:36:47,979
It's not that far.

656
00:36:49,369 --> 00:36:52,190
And I hate you spending
august in the office.

657
00:36:52,996 --> 00:36:56,209
Although I liked your girl,
Peggy, she's fresh.

658
00:36:57,210 --> 00:36:58,713
As the driven snow.

659
00:36:59,305 --> 00:37:00,755
You sound disappointed.

660
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:04,710
Did you read some terrible
article in look magazine

661
00:37:04,944 --> 00:37:06,463
that I should know about?

662
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:08,610
I like her.

663
00:37:10,371 --> 00:37:13,794
A woman can't just not remark
on her husband's secretary.

664
00:37:17,683 --> 00:37:19,040
Don, are you okay?

665
00:37:22,808 --> 00:37:26,072
No, I just might have to go back to
the office, I haven't decided yet.

666
00:38:23,561 --> 00:38:24,561
Phone!

667
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:38,019
Hello.

668
00:38:38,283 --> 00:38:40,146
I need to see you tonight,
are you busy?

669
00:38:41,089 --> 00:38:43,567
For you, of course not.

670
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:46,214
Good, I'm leaving now.

671
00:38:46,668 --> 00:38:47,668
<i>From where?</i>

672
00:38:49,318 --> 00:38:50,324
25 minutes.

673
00:38:50,583 --> 00:38:52,909
I don't even know what you drink.

674
00:38:53,794 --> 00:38:55,036
Whatever you have.

675
00:39:54,712 --> 00:39:56,779
I'm so glad you changed your mind.

676
00:39:57,673 --> 00:39:58,673
Come in,

677
00:39:59,324 --> 00:40:00,380
sit down.

678
00:40:04,061 --> 00:40:07,794
I know it's terrible,
it's temporary, I hope.

679
00:40:10,905 --> 00:40:11,905
Look at you...

680
00:40:13,606 --> 00:40:15,296
You look more like you now.

681
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:26,354
I came here because
I wanted to talk to you,

682
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:27,796
and explain something to you.

683
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:30,691
Yeah, you gotta stop
that kind of talk.

684
00:40:31,047 --> 00:40:32,509
This isn't so hard.

685
00:40:34,171 --> 00:40:35,552
Adam, listen to me,

686
00:40:37,421 --> 00:40:38,520
I have a life,

687
00:40:39,671 --> 00:40:42,519
and it only goes in
one direction, forward.

688
00:40:46,358 --> 00:40:48,566
What are you drinking, gin?

689
00:40:49,673 --> 00:40:52,195
I found it in one of the offices,
under a couch,

690
00:40:52,611 --> 00:40:55,137
three quarts, figured
I could take one.

691
00:40:55,985 --> 00:40:56,985
Coffee.

692
00:40:57,234 --> 00:40:58,234
I can do that.

693
00:41:03,922 --> 00:41:07,032
So, no Abigail, no uncle Mac,
nobody huh?

694
00:41:07,368 --> 00:41:09,782
I know, it's strange.

695
00:41:12,047 --> 00:41:13,690
Your office is really nice.

696
00:41:14,931 --> 00:41:18,007
I figure from that award,
you must be pretty important.

697
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:21,908
I don't know, I guess so.

698
00:41:23,069 --> 00:41:26,058
Everyone always said, you were too
smart for your own good.

699
00:41:27,731 --> 00:41:30,079
Of course, uncle Mac thought
you were soft,

700
00:41:31,547 --> 00:41:33,115
but you're not, are ya?

701
00:41:33,924 --> 00:41:34,924
No, I'm not.

702
00:41:39,612 --> 00:41:41,021
What are you doing?

703
00:41:47,288 --> 00:41:48,517
It's $5000.

704
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:52,672
That's all there is.

705
00:41:54,174 --> 00:41:55,258
I want you to take it,

706
00:41:55,518 --> 00:41:56,839
and I want you to leave New York,

707
00:41:57,027 --> 00:41:59,716
and I don't want to see or hear
from you ever again.

708
00:42:03,987 --> 00:42:05,681
That's not what I wanted.

709
00:42:08,573 --> 00:42:09,898
That's not right.

710
00:42:11,112 --> 00:42:12,894
That's all I can do for you.

711
00:42:14,675 --> 00:42:16,283
You're serious, aren't you?

712
00:42:19,484 --> 00:42:21,060
You thought I was dead...

713
00:42:22,613 --> 00:42:24,287
Just go back to thinking that.

714
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:27,410
Where do I go?

715
00:42:31,668 --> 00:42:34,697
Adam, that is $5000.

716
00:42:38,064 --> 00:42:39,720
Make your own life.

717
00:42:43,239 --> 00:42:44,702
I have too much here.

718
00:43:19,114 --> 00:43:20,677
Its gonna be okay.

719
00:44:02,177 --> 00:44:03,464
How'd it go?

720
00:44:04,239 --> 00:44:05,479
Cris averted?

721
00:44:08,105 --> 00:44:09,702
Papers are on my desk.

722
00:44:11,427 --> 00:44:13,377
Do you want to go visit the kids?

723
00:44:15,928 --> 00:44:17,822
No, I just want to go to sleep.

724
00:44:24,678 --> 00:44:26,702
I want to talk to you
about something,

725
00:44:27,675 --> 00:44:29,506
and I don't want you to get upset.

726
00:44:38,197 --> 00:44:39,308
I won't.

727
00:44:43,115 --> 00:44:45,678
I know you hate going to
my family's house in <i>Cape May</i>,

728
00:44:45,938 --> 00:44:47,463
and I know even though my father...

729
00:44:47,662 --> 00:44:49,248
No, it's great-it's great.

730
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:53,538
I'm looking forward to
it already, I swear.

731
00:44:53,865 --> 00:44:57,129
But I know you don't like that my
father might be there for part of it.

732
00:44:58,303 --> 00:45:00,380
I just don't like the way
he looks at me.

733
00:45:01,992 --> 00:45:03,865
You took away his little girl.

734
00:45:05,736 --> 00:45:06,741
I was

735
00:45:07,533 --> 00:45:08,543
thinking...

736
00:45:08,716 --> 00:45:11,476
Maybe we should just
buy a summer house,

737
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:15,324
something closer that's ours.

738
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:19,411
I mean, I know we had a good year.

739
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:25,298
I don't know, Bets,

740
00:45:27,989 --> 00:45:30,367
I think <i>Cape May</i> will be fine.

741
00:45:32,242 --> 00:45:34,019
We're not that flush right now.

742
00:45:36,776 --> 00:45:38,760
There's nothing to be worried about,

743
00:45:39,552 --> 00:45:41,520
I'd just rather wait til' next year.

744
00:45:45,366 --> 00:45:46,366
Good...

745
00:45:49,741 --> 00:45:51,824
Because I like seeing my dad.
