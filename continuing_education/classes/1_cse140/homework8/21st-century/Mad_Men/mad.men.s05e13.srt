1
00:00:00,029 --> 00:00:01,601
I want all the partners here.

2
00:00:04,051 --> 00:00:05,765
I'm going to need
an apartment in the city.

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:07,602
Absolutely not.

4
00:00:07,828 --> 00:00:09,172
I'm going to need
your resignation.

5
00:00:09,946 --> 00:00:13,053
Lane hanged himself
in his office.

6
00:00:15,154 --> 00:00:16,678
Why don't you spend
Thanksgiving with her

7
00:00:16,764 --> 00:00:19,066
and I'll go to your house
and screw your wife.

8
00:00:19,511 --> 00:00:21,019
Good luck with that.

9
00:00:21,216 --> 00:00:22,751
You know I don't
want you to fail.

10
00:00:23,338 --> 00:00:24,536
Good.

11
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:26,931
Because I'm not going to.

12

13
00:01:28,281 --> 00:01:30,015
What are you doing?

14
00:01:30,049 --> 00:01:31,683
I'll make breakfast.

15
00:01:31,684 --> 00:01:33,209
_

16
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:35,012
_

17
00:01:35,254 --> 00:01:37,021
Don, you're gonna be late.

18
00:01:39,525 --> 00:01:41,259
Damn it.

19
00:01:45,697 --> 00:01:49,566
- <i>Bonjour,</i> Marie.
- Would you like an omelet?

20
00:01:49,601 --> 00:01:52,503
- I'd better not.
- You can't eat an egg?

21
00:01:52,537 --> 00:01:54,004
Do I have to call the dentist?

22
00:01:54,038 --> 00:01:59,543
- It'll go away. It always does.
- Go easy on the mouth wash.

23
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:01,811
Have fun.

24
00:02:03,014 --> 00:02:05,548
_

25
00:02:05,582 --> 00:02:08,684
- Why bother him?
- With what?

26
00:02:12,189 --> 00:02:14,923
"We're sorry that there's been
no response to your reel.

27
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:18,461
We would encourage you to try our
advanced film workshop for a low--"

28
00:02:18,495 --> 00:02:22,364
What is it?

29
00:02:22,398 --> 00:02:24,932
I paid for a screen test.

30
00:02:24,967 --> 00:02:28,637
They were supposed
to send it to agents.

31
00:02:28,671 --> 00:02:30,172
And they weren't interested?

32
00:02:30,206 --> 00:02:32,874
How could they have sent it
to anybody but me in a week?

33
00:02:32,908 --> 00:02:35,009
They're selling classes.

34
00:02:35,044 --> 00:02:38,445
It's a great thing to take
advantage of hopeless people.

35
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,247
Hopeless?

36
00:02:40,748 --> 00:02:44,703
_

37
00:02:50,725 --> 00:02:52,958
Oh, Beth, I don't know
if you remember Pete Campbell.

38
00:02:52,993 --> 00:02:56,196
Of course.
We almost had dinner.

39
00:02:58,999 --> 00:03:00,433
How was the second honeymoon?

40
00:03:00,467 --> 00:03:03,002
Did you create
another beneficiary?

41
00:03:03,036 --> 00:03:04,870
So where are you off to?

42
00:03:06,473 --> 00:03:08,607
She's gonna stay with
her sister for a little bit.

43
00:03:08,641 --> 00:03:09,974
And where is that?

44
00:03:10,009 --> 00:03:12,311
You know what, honey?

45
00:03:12,345 --> 00:03:13,812
I'm going to the smoke room.

46
00:03:13,846 --> 00:03:17,115
- We'll have to stand.
- You don't have to come.

47
00:03:19,952 --> 00:03:22,321
Don't take it personally.

48
00:03:22,355 --> 00:03:23,988
She's in a mood.

49
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:27,291
Excuse me.

50
00:03:27,326 --> 00:03:28,859
<i>Can-- Can I just</i>
<i>get by here, please?</i>

51
00:03:28,893 --> 00:03:31,161
<i>- Go right ahead.</i>
<i>- Thank you.</i>

52
00:03:39,638 --> 00:03:41,471
Morning.

53
00:03:41,505 --> 00:03:43,673
Morning.

54
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:45,141
38?

55
00:03:45,175 --> 00:03:48,077
- Where are you going?
- I made a mistake.

56
00:03:48,112 --> 00:03:50,614
Okay.

57
00:03:50,648 --> 00:03:53,450
Because I heard that the
parachute company upstairs

58
00:03:53,484 --> 00:03:55,585
got a big government contract
and moved to Washington

59
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,586
to be closer to the
cemetery or something.

60
00:03:57,621 --> 00:04:00,856
For once, mind your
own business, Harry.

61
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:03,525
All I'm saying is if
we're getting more space,

62
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,594
I'll take anything
without a column in it.

63
00:04:05,629 --> 00:04:08,196
We offered you another office
and you turned it down.

64
00:04:08,231 --> 00:04:10,733
You didn't want
his office either.

65
00:04:10,767 --> 00:04:13,668
So is it true or not?

66
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:20,174
I need a window, Joan.
I'm getting scurvy.

67
00:04:25,614 --> 00:04:26,748
Adam?

68
00:04:34,121 --> 00:04:38,325
"Topaz--
Always less expensive, never cheap."

69
00:04:41,061 --> 00:04:44,030
- I hate it.
- No, you don't.

70
00:04:44,064 --> 00:04:45,564
So we're aiming
for cheap girls?

71
00:04:45,599 --> 00:04:48,066
- Girls, not cheap.
- So we're cheap.

72
00:04:48,101 --> 00:04:50,403
Art, come on. We agreed
on a value approach.

73
00:04:50,437 --> 00:04:52,705
- I hate the word "cheap."
- And so do I!

74
00:04:52,739 --> 00:04:54,740
That's why I put the word
"never" in front of it.

75
00:04:54,775 --> 00:04:56,609
You say the word,
you put it on their mind.

76
00:04:58,978 --> 00:05:00,412
I hate to quote you directly,

77
00:05:00,446 --> 00:05:02,714
<i>but didn't you say</i>
<i>that with Topaz,</i>

78
00:05:02,748 --> 00:05:04,015
a girl could be sexy
for pocket change?

79
00:05:04,049 --> 00:05:06,250
I thought it was gonna be
"two for one, twice the fun."

80
00:05:06,285 --> 00:05:07,652
That really sounds cheap.

81
00:05:07,687 --> 00:05:09,421
Perhaps Don can answer this.

82
00:05:09,455 --> 00:05:12,223
Gentlemen, how are you?

83
00:05:12,257 --> 00:05:14,959
Art and Marvin object
to the word "cheap."

84
00:05:16,828 --> 00:05:19,430
You're aware the word
does not refer to Topaz.

85
00:05:19,464 --> 00:05:21,465
Clearly it states
the exact opposite.

86
00:05:21,499 --> 00:05:22,800
And it's very funny.

87
00:05:22,834 --> 00:05:25,001
We're supposed to be
part of a fantasy,

88
00:05:25,036 --> 00:05:27,471
and I don't think cheap
is part of any girl's fantasy.

89
00:05:27,505 --> 00:05:29,373
<i>Why don't you get</i>
<i>a girl's opinion?</i>

90
00:05:29,407 --> 00:05:31,274
I used to take that
as a given here.

91
00:05:31,309 --> 00:05:33,609
And I'm not talking about
black coffee out there.

92
00:05:35,546 --> 00:05:38,113
- We're happy to copy test it for you.
- What's that gonna cost?

93
00:05:38,148 --> 00:05:40,082
They're not charging us.
They should've done it already.

94
00:05:40,116 --> 00:05:43,386
- Let me walk you out.
- See you soon.

95
00:05:47,558 --> 00:05:49,157
Why the hell didn't
you get any research?

96
00:05:49,191 --> 00:05:51,593
Because we never had
to do it for them before.

97
00:05:51,627 --> 00:05:55,397
The client didn't like it and we did.
In the end is how we know it's good.

98
00:05:55,431 --> 00:05:57,666
- Then this is a success.
- I consider it a success

99
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,133
he didn't have to go
a single day

100
00:05:59,168 --> 00:06:02,003
without telling me
I'm an idiot.

101
00:06:02,037 --> 00:06:04,572
I'll tell you what--
I'm so bored of this dynamic.

102
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:09,577
<i>I have your sister in law.</i>

103
00:06:11,312 --> 00:06:15,182
- Hello, Judy.
<i>- No, it's me.</i>

104
00:06:15,216 --> 00:06:17,785
- <i>Beth.</i>
- I know who it is.

105
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:22,288
- <i>I have to see you.</i>
- Jesus, I'm at work.

106
00:06:22,322 --> 00:06:25,625
Clara, could you go to the lobby
and get me a pack of Life Savers?

107
00:06:25,659 --> 00:06:27,494
<i>What's wrong
with the machine?</i>

108
00:06:27,528 --> 00:06:29,863
I want them fresh.

109
00:06:29,897 --> 00:06:32,298
So you ran into me on the train

110
00:06:32,332 --> 00:06:34,066
and suddenly remember
who I was?

111
00:06:34,101 --> 00:06:36,302
<i>Meet me where you wanted</i>
<i>to meet before--</i>

112
00:06:36,336 --> 00:06:38,136
<i>The hotel Pennsylvania.</i>

113
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:40,972
<i>I'll be there at noon</i>
<i>under the name Mrs. Campbell.</i>

114
00:06:41,007 --> 00:06:44,175
I hope you like waiting.
That's what I did.

115
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:46,745
<i>This may be our last chance.</i>

116
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,403
Why is this so hard?!

117
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,021
It has to be 125 words

118
00:06:57,055 --> 00:06:58,823
and 15 of them have to be Ajax.

119
00:06:58,857 --> 00:07:01,893
Fellas, can I have miss Olson
to myself for a minute?

120
00:07:05,163 --> 00:07:07,899
- Do you smoke?
- Not really.

121
00:07:07,933 --> 00:07:10,166
Well, get started.

122
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,836
- Smoke it, name it, sell it.
- What is it?

123
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:15,472
Philip Morris's top secret
ladies' cigarette.

124
00:07:15,506 --> 00:07:17,841
Leo Burnett thinks it's too small,
and now it's in review.

125
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:20,076
So it's your job
to make sure they're sorry.

126
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:22,879
- Great.
- Evan!

127
00:07:22,914 --> 00:07:24,680
Flip through the research
check * leisure

128
00:07:24,714 --> 00:07:26,348
and then get
your little ones on it.

129
00:07:26,382 --> 00:07:28,851
Did they tell you
anything I should know?

130
00:07:28,885 --> 00:07:31,487
Does your boyfriend
light your cigarettes?

131
00:07:31,521 --> 00:07:33,622
- I don't smoke.
- Yes, you do.

132
00:07:33,657 --> 00:07:36,525
It's gotta make noise.
Maybe she lights it herself.

133
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,028
So is that what it is,
or is it something like that?

134
00:07:40,063 --> 00:07:42,096
You're a woman and you smoke.

135
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:43,598
What do you want?

136
00:07:46,902 --> 00:07:50,438
All of last year's third and
fourth quarters' work has posted

137
00:07:50,473 --> 00:07:52,974
with sizeable checks
from Vicks, Sugarberry,

138
00:07:53,008 --> 00:07:54,442
and Heinz in the bank.

139
00:07:54,477 --> 00:07:57,478
And with Mohawk returning
to its prestrike billings,

140
00:07:57,512 --> 00:07:59,379
revenues are up 34%
from last year,

141
00:07:59,413 --> 00:08:01,782
making this our best quarter.

142
00:08:01,816 --> 00:08:04,217
It's march.
It's our only quarter.

143
00:08:04,251 --> 00:08:06,419
Not this year. Ever.

144
00:08:06,454 --> 00:08:08,288
And with Jaguar due to run

145
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:10,924
and Butler shooting
and running within the month,

146
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:14,227
projections for next
quarter are equally bright.

147
00:08:14,261 --> 00:08:16,029
Have you found me an office?

148
00:08:16,063 --> 00:08:18,931
Unfortunately, I was unable
to go upstairs this morning.

149
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:20,400
Harry Crane.

150
00:08:20,434 --> 00:08:22,768
But I am meeting with
the building manager at lunch.

151
00:08:22,803 --> 00:08:24,604
Get more than we need.

152
00:08:24,638 --> 00:08:26,606
Any objections?

153
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:38,350
I'm sorry, but I feel someone
has to voice the negatives.

154
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:42,388
Perhaps after one quarter, we should
be careful not to overextend ourselves.

155
00:08:42,422 --> 00:08:43,622
Can we just vote?

156
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:46,224
Or we could table
this discussion until June.

157
00:08:46,258 --> 00:08:47,958
All in favor
of tabling the vote?

158
00:08:47,993 --> 00:08:50,261
- Aye.
- Tabling does not require a vote.

159
00:08:50,295 --> 00:08:51,896
It only needs to be seconded.

160
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:54,665
- What is this, parliament?
- Is this meeting over yet?

161
00:08:54,699 --> 00:08:58,202
- No, it's not. - Don, I give you
my proxy. I have things to do.

162
00:09:02,806 --> 00:09:06,376
We can do that?

163
00:09:18,855 --> 00:09:22,391
- Thank God.
- Stop it.

164
00:09:22,426 --> 00:09:25,928
- I knew you'd show.
- Because I'm pathetic?

165
00:09:27,597 --> 00:09:30,732
If you're so angry,
why did you come?

166
00:09:30,767 --> 00:09:32,834
You know I had to.

167
00:09:36,238 --> 00:09:38,306
Come sit with me.

168
00:09:46,147 --> 00:09:49,316
I'm not going to my sister's.

169
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:53,654
I-- Well, Howard checked me into
the hospital this morning.

170
00:09:53,689 --> 00:09:55,990
For what?
What's wrong?

171
00:09:56,024 --> 00:09:58,358
It's hard to explain,

172
00:09:58,393 --> 00:10:00,994
but I've been very blue

173
00:10:01,028 --> 00:10:03,997
and... the doctors
seem to think

174
00:10:04,031 --> 00:10:06,766
the only thing to do
is electroshock.

175
00:10:06,801 --> 00:10:10,103
Shock treatment?
You're not crazy.

176
00:10:10,137 --> 00:10:13,506
Look, Peter,
I wanted to see you

177
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:16,341
because it's going
to be different after.

178
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:18,276
It always is.

179
00:10:18,311 --> 00:10:21,113
You've done it before?

180
00:10:21,147 --> 00:10:22,815
Yes.

181
00:10:22,849 --> 00:10:27,152
And it creates
this sort of gray cloud.

182
00:10:27,186 --> 00:10:29,488
The last time,
I lost months and--

183
00:10:29,522 --> 00:10:31,689
This is wonderful.

184
00:10:31,724 --> 00:10:34,592
You're wonderful.

185
00:10:34,627 --> 00:10:37,862
I don't want to forget
and I'm afraid I will.

186
00:10:41,867 --> 00:10:44,636
I told them I was going
to my niece's birthday party.

187
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:47,270
I have to be back by 5:00
so I'll be ready for tomorrow.

188
00:10:47,304 --> 00:10:49,572
What makes you think
I would do this?

189
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:51,307
You are crazy.

190
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:56,013
Please.

191
00:10:56,047 --> 00:10:58,649
Please give me this.

192
00:11:12,029 --> 00:11:13,996
Oh, God.

193
00:11:17,067 --> 00:11:21,002
Why does everybody want redheads?
Anybody can become a redhead.

194
00:11:21,037 --> 00:11:22,537
I mean, even Julia's working.

195
00:11:22,571 --> 00:11:24,806
Working?

196
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,975
She did three days
on Dark Shadows

197
00:11:27,009 --> 00:11:28,743
and then they fired her
and cut her out.

198
00:11:28,778 --> 00:11:31,345
Shit. I keep telling her
how good she was.

199
00:11:34,716 --> 00:11:38,185
This is why you're not working.
You won't answer the phone.

200
00:11:40,655 --> 00:11:42,556
Hello?

201
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:45,592
Hello?
I can hear you.

202
00:11:47,962 --> 00:11:50,064
Heavy breathing?

203
00:11:50,098 --> 00:11:52,364
It was a wrong number,
but they keep calling

204
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,734
- and they never say they're sorry.
<i>- Ah.</i>

205
00:11:54,768 --> 00:11:57,269
I wish you would have
told me we had company.

206
00:11:57,304 --> 00:11:58,905
I wouldn't have
come out like this.

207
00:11:58,939 --> 00:12:00,773
Hello. Nice to meet you.

208
00:12:00,808 --> 00:12:03,309
- Mother, this is Emily from class.
- <i>Pleasure.</i>

209
00:12:03,343 --> 00:12:05,812
Megan, did you get me an
appointment for a wash and set?

210
00:12:05,846 --> 00:12:07,312
Yes, <i>maman.</i>

211
00:12:07,346 --> 00:12:10,015
- How long are you in town for?
- <i>Only a week.</i>

212
00:12:10,049 --> 00:12:12,217
I wanted to spend Easter
with my daughter.

213
00:12:12,251 --> 00:12:14,319
My husband is an atheist.

214
00:12:14,353 --> 00:12:15,854
What are your plans for today?

215
00:12:15,888 --> 00:12:18,423
We are looking
at the casting notices.

216
00:12:18,457 --> 00:12:20,092
<i>Bonne chance.</i>

217
00:12:22,761 --> 00:12:24,661
She's so elegant
and encouraging.

218
00:12:24,696 --> 00:12:26,597
I guess so.

219
00:12:27,866 --> 00:12:29,867
Listen.

220
00:12:32,738 --> 00:12:35,672
I hope you know that
if I could ever help you

221
00:12:35,707 --> 00:12:37,708
in any way, I would
want you to ask.

222
00:12:37,743 --> 00:12:39,375
Okay.

223
00:12:39,409 --> 00:12:43,346
Well, my agent put me up
for this part.

224
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,981
It's really cute.

225
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:46,649
It's based on
Beauty And The Beast

226
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:50,519
and, well, it's a commercial
for Barnett shoes.

227
00:12:50,554 --> 00:12:52,255
And?

228
00:12:52,289 --> 00:12:53,957
Well, Don's the Draper

229
00:12:53,991 --> 00:12:55,824
in Sterling Cooper
Draper Pryce, isn't he?

230
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:59,094
- Do you mean Butler shoes?
- Yes, that's it.

231
00:12:59,129 --> 00:13:02,464
Look, I really don't want
to make you uncomfortable.

232
00:13:02,498 --> 00:13:04,633
I am completely
prepared for no.

233
00:13:04,667 --> 00:13:07,970
I just--
It's a European type.

234
00:13:08,004 --> 00:13:11,672
I-- I'm sorry,
but Don doesn't do that.

235
00:13:11,706 --> 00:13:14,208
That's not the way it works.

236
00:13:14,243 --> 00:13:15,709
It's really up to the client.

237
00:13:15,744 --> 00:13:19,647
All I want is an audition.
I'd ask you who I have to sleep with,

238
00:13:19,681 --> 00:13:23,184
but I don't think
you'd like it.

239
00:13:23,218 --> 00:13:26,254
Um, okay.
I'll see what I can do.

240
00:13:28,322 --> 00:13:31,457
I am your eternal slave.

241
00:13:31,492 --> 00:13:33,193
But if it doesn't work out,

242
00:13:33,227 --> 00:13:35,095
you're gonna have to act
like I never asked.

243
00:13:35,129 --> 00:13:37,497
Now find me a job.

244
00:13:45,272 --> 00:13:48,340
I should go.

245
00:13:48,374 --> 00:13:50,876
Howard's coming by after work.

246
00:13:50,911 --> 00:13:53,045
"It was terrible.

247
00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:55,948
I couldn't find the party,
then I couldn't get a cab."

248
00:13:55,982 --> 00:13:58,717
For four hours?

249
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,829
Don't tell me you're not
happy right now.

250
00:14:10,863 --> 00:14:13,198
Don't tell me
you don't feel better.

251
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:27,144
Howard can't make you do this.

252
00:14:29,314 --> 00:14:32,349
He wants to control you.
He's a monster.

253
00:14:32,383 --> 00:14:36,419
You just hate him
because he voted for Goldwater.

254
00:14:36,454 --> 00:14:38,221
This is not a joke.

255
00:14:38,255 --> 00:14:40,990
Let's go to Los Angeles.
I've been there.

256
00:14:41,024 --> 00:14:42,992
It's filled with sunshine.

257
00:14:43,026 --> 00:14:44,894
I can't.

258
00:14:45,995 --> 00:14:47,665
Why?

259
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,769
It's so dark, Peter...

260
00:14:53,803 --> 00:14:56,905
That I just get to this place

261
00:14:56,939 --> 00:15:04,412
and I suddenly feel this door open,
and I want to walk through it.

262
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:07,715
That's for weak people,

263
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,284
people who can't
solve a problem.

264
00:15:10,318 --> 00:15:12,987
You want to solve a problem?

265
00:15:13,021 --> 00:15:14,922
Zip me up.

266
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:28,902
And then you'll leave.

267
00:15:28,936 --> 00:15:31,037
And what if you forget
you love me?

268
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:33,039
Oh, Peter.

269
00:15:33,073 --> 00:15:37,376
I don't know you
and you don't know me.

270
00:15:37,411 --> 00:15:40,413
We just happen to have
the same problem.

271
00:15:40,447 --> 00:15:44,383
I know, but we're only sad
because we're apart.

272
00:15:44,418 --> 00:15:47,787
Oh, then I was wrong.

273
00:15:49,289 --> 00:15:51,423
I really should go.

274
00:15:51,457 --> 00:15:53,858
Why?

275
00:15:53,893 --> 00:15:56,494
Because it works.

276
00:15:56,529 --> 00:15:58,496
Really?

277
00:16:05,971 --> 00:16:08,071
Five more minutes.

278
00:16:16,089 --> 00:16:17,922
- Hello.
- How are you feeling?

279
00:16:17,957 --> 00:16:19,891
- Better.
- Good.

280
00:16:19,925 --> 00:16:21,659
Just in case, I made soup.

281
00:16:21,693 --> 00:16:24,195
I'll change for dinner.

282
00:16:25,364 --> 00:16:27,365
We'll be right out.

283
00:16:32,671 --> 00:16:34,204
Are you really feeling better?

284
00:16:34,239 --> 00:16:37,341
- I didn't get a kiss.
- I swear I'm better.

285
00:16:45,816 --> 00:16:47,650
Emily was telling me
that Butler shoes

286
00:16:47,685 --> 00:16:49,119
<i>is shooting a new commercial.</i>

287
00:16:49,153 --> 00:16:51,220
"Beauty and the beast."

288
00:16:54,157 --> 00:16:56,759
Well, she said they're
looking for a European girl.

289
00:16:56,793 --> 00:16:59,061
And I was thinking,

290
00:16:59,096 --> 00:17:02,164
well, I'd be mad at myself
if I didn't ask,

291
00:17:02,199 --> 00:17:06,734
and, well, I wouldn't ask
if I didn't think

292
00:17:06,769 --> 00:17:09,237
I'd be right for it,
but I really am.

293
00:17:10,539 --> 00:17:12,007
What?

294
00:17:17,713 --> 00:17:20,248
All I want you to do
is put my name in a pile.

295
00:17:20,283 --> 00:17:22,516
I know they're gonna wanna
see what I look like on film

296
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:24,919
and I happen to have it.

297
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:28,255
You wanna be in a commercial?

298
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:30,424
I wanna work.

299
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:32,960
It's in town,
so I'd be home for dinner.

300
00:17:32,994 --> 00:17:36,263
- I thought you hated advertising.
- I never said that.

301
00:17:36,298 --> 00:17:38,764
Well, you certainly
don't think it's art.

302
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,699
And you're an artist,
aren't you?

303
00:17:40,734 --> 00:17:42,936
Are you mad at me?

304
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:44,804
I'm just surprised.

305
00:17:44,838 --> 00:17:47,440
It's not theater, it's not
Broadway, it's not film.

306
00:17:47,474 --> 00:17:49,508
A national commercial?

307
00:17:49,543 --> 00:17:51,744
All my friends
would kill for it.

308
00:17:51,778 --> 00:17:53,612
You'd get in the union,
you'd get exposure.

309
00:17:53,647 --> 00:17:55,380
You'd get money.
That's why they want it.

310
00:17:55,415 --> 00:17:58,116
You don't need that.

311
00:17:58,151 --> 00:18:01,353
Do you know how hard this was
for me to even ask you?

312
00:18:01,387 --> 00:18:03,155
Do you know how hard
it would be to ask

313
00:18:03,189 --> 00:18:05,290
Charles Butler Jr.
to hire my wife?

314
00:18:05,325 --> 00:18:08,460
I just want an audition.
I'll be Megan Calvet.

315
00:18:08,494 --> 00:18:10,928
Ken, Stan and Ginsberg
are gonna be there.

316
00:18:10,963 --> 00:18:14,332
They know who you are.

317
00:18:14,366 --> 00:18:17,901
- I'm gonna call the dentist.
- No. I'm better.

318
00:18:19,838 --> 00:18:23,607
Listen, just forget
I brought any of this up.

319
00:18:23,641 --> 00:18:25,742
It's just--

320
00:18:25,777 --> 00:18:29,245
It's been so hard, you know.

321
00:18:30,714 --> 00:18:34,884
- I do.

322
00:18:34,918 --> 00:18:37,988
Look, you don't
want it this way.

323
00:18:38,022 --> 00:18:40,991
You wanna be somebody's
discovery, not somebody's wife.

324
00:18:42,492 --> 00:18:48,630
You're right. I know you're right.

325
00:18:48,664 --> 00:18:51,867
<i>- Aren't you gonna get it?</i>
<i>- No. They've been hanging up all day.</i>

326
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:59,073
Hello?

327
00:18:59,108 --> 00:19:00,708
Who is this?

328
00:19:00,742 --> 00:19:03,044
<i>- Hello, is Marie there?</i>
- Emile?

329
00:19:03,078 --> 00:19:05,679
Marie, <i>s'il vous plait.</i>

330
00:19:05,714 --> 00:19:09,283
It's your father. I think he's drunk.

331
00:19:11,253 --> 00:19:12,686
<i>Hello?</i>

332
00:19:12,721 --> 00:19:14,087
Daddy's on the phone.

333
00:19:16,757 --> 00:19:19,526
- <i>Allo,</i> Emile.
- She's got it.

334
00:19:21,129 --> 00:19:23,096
Marie, it's Roger.

335
00:19:23,131 --> 00:19:25,098
Oh.

336
00:19:25,133 --> 00:19:27,664
_

337
00:19:27,911 --> 00:19:30,003
_

338
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,171
Marie, it's Roger Sterling.

339
00:19:32,205 --> 00:19:33,739
I've used up
all the French I know.

340
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,502
_

341
00:19:35,891 --> 00:19:37,522
_

342
00:19:42,449 --> 00:19:44,777
What is "rejahy-nah"?

343
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:52,057
Thank you.

344
00:19:53,993 --> 00:19:55,493
Megan, you know
I would if I could.

345
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:58,430
Of course.

346
00:19:58,464 --> 00:20:01,567
I'm gonna take a bath
before dinner.

347
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:23,220
How did you know I was here?

348
00:20:23,254 --> 00:20:25,922
Because Don was complaining
you were drinking all his liquor.

349
00:20:25,957 --> 00:20:30,694
Ha. So you wanted to see me? You could
have arranged a dinner for the four of us.

350
00:20:30,728 --> 00:20:32,762
Really?
You'd do that?

351
00:20:32,797 --> 00:20:35,065
No, because I'm not
that kind of woman.

352
00:20:35,099 --> 00:20:36,932
No, no, of course you're not.

353
00:20:36,967 --> 00:20:38,834
It's just, well,
I enjoy your company

354
00:20:38,868 --> 00:20:41,737
and I thought if you were willing to
broach impropriety ever so slightly,

355
00:20:41,771 --> 00:20:43,973
I could have dinner
brought to my apartment.

356
00:20:44,007 --> 00:20:45,874
The kid from room service
can chaperone.

357
00:20:45,909 --> 00:20:49,178
Room service?
Is it an hotel?

358
00:20:49,213 --> 00:20:51,646
The Stanhope. And you can
just ask for me in the lobby.

359
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,281
It's very discreet.

360
00:20:53,316 --> 00:20:55,417
They just send
the girls right up?

361
00:20:55,451 --> 00:20:57,519
Look, I called you.

362
00:20:57,553 --> 00:21:00,188
In fact, I had hung up on your
daughter about a dozen times today.

363
00:21:00,223 --> 00:21:02,056
I'm not asking
for anything more

364
00:21:02,091 --> 00:21:04,292
than a little conversation,
I swear.

365
00:21:06,496 --> 00:21:08,762
I'll try to get away
on the condition

366
00:21:08,796 --> 00:21:10,931
that you lower
your expectations.

367
00:21:10,965 --> 00:21:15,369
- Below conversation?
- Bonne nuit.

368
00:21:50,336 --> 00:21:52,571
Good morning, Mr. Draper.

369
00:21:52,605 --> 00:21:54,139
How are you feeling?

370
00:21:54,174 --> 00:21:56,541
- Could you get me some ice?
- Right away.

371
00:21:56,575 --> 00:21:58,042
Mrs. Harris
wants to see you.

372
00:21:58,076 --> 00:21:59,810
She's been waiting
in there quite a while.

373
00:22:04,516 --> 00:22:06,284
Morning.

374
00:22:06,318 --> 00:22:09,019
What can I do for you?

375
00:22:09,054 --> 00:22:12,622
I want to reopen the
conversation about more space.

376
00:22:12,657 --> 00:22:14,224
You're not gonna put
anybody here, are you?

377
00:22:14,258 --> 00:22:16,125
No.

378
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:19,028
It's just I've been
trying so hard to be

379
00:22:19,063 --> 00:22:21,831
so responsible and careful
and I don't even know why,

380
00:22:21,865 --> 00:22:24,601
because every day
I open the mail

381
00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:26,736
and there's more money.

382
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:28,704
That's the idea, isn't it?

383
00:22:28,738 --> 00:22:30,972
I got this this morning.

384
00:22:34,611 --> 00:22:38,314
The death benefit from the
company insurance policy.

385
00:22:38,348 --> 00:22:41,417
It's $175,000.

386
00:22:41,451 --> 00:22:43,384
So what's your question?

387
00:22:45,153 --> 00:22:48,389
Why would he do that?

388
00:22:48,424 --> 00:22:51,626
You'll never get an answer.
You can't think about that.

389
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:55,230
But I do. And then
I can't stop it.

390
00:22:55,264 --> 00:22:57,298
What could I have done?

391
00:22:57,333 --> 00:22:58,933
Nothing.

392
00:22:58,967 --> 00:23:01,901
It's not true.

393
00:23:01,936 --> 00:23:05,405
Why didn't I give him
what he wanted?

394
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,374
What did he want?

395
00:23:13,748 --> 00:23:16,682
And now there's this,
this profit.

396
00:23:16,717 --> 00:23:19,585
How much did he put in for
collateral after Lucky Strike left?

397
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,086
$50,000.

398
00:23:21,121 --> 00:23:22,622
We should pay that back.

399
00:23:22,656 --> 00:23:25,558
- Shouldn't we have a vote?
- No.

400
00:23:25,592 --> 00:23:27,192
Cut a check to his wife.

401
00:23:30,196 --> 00:23:31,763
Are you under the weather?

402
00:23:31,797 --> 00:23:34,566
- I have a hot tooth.
- I know a dentist.

403
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,768
He's in the steeple
of the Chrysler building.

404
00:23:36,802 --> 00:23:39,103
Even if he can't help you,
you still get to see the view.

405
00:23:39,138 --> 00:23:40,639
It'll go away.

406
00:23:43,809 --> 00:23:45,443
I have your ice.

407
00:23:45,478 --> 00:23:47,944
I'll take that.

408
00:23:47,979 --> 00:23:50,281
Put that on your face,
not in a drink.

409
00:23:58,249 --> 00:23:59,792
_

410
00:23:59,894 --> 00:24:00,984
_

411
00:24:00,985 --> 00:24:03,320
I don't feel well.

412
00:24:03,354 --> 00:24:05,923
Just go to the cloisters
without me.

413
00:24:13,223 --> 00:24:14,594
_

414
00:24:15,486 --> 00:24:17,562
_

415
00:24:17,635 --> 00:24:20,503
No, mother.

416
00:24:20,538 --> 00:24:22,204
I'm sad.

417
00:24:22,239 --> 00:24:24,106
I know.

418
00:24:26,576 --> 00:24:28,343
What do I do?

419
00:24:28,602 --> 00:24:30,639
_

420
00:24:31,066 --> 00:24:32,777
_

421
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:35,682
_

422
00:24:35,782 --> 00:24:37,845
_

423
00:24:39,322 --> 00:24:41,856
Why are you always
so nice to strangers?

424
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:44,158
You don't every care
about what I wanna do.

425
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:48,312
_

426
00:24:48,697 --> 00:24:50,865
You're supposed
to be encouraging.

427
00:24:53,068 --> 00:24:55,463
Not every little girl
gets to do what they want.

428
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,278
The world cannot support
that many ballerinas.

429
00:24:59,074 --> 00:25:01,541
Is that what you tell yourself?

430
00:25:02,284 --> 00:25:04,557
_

431
00:25:05,757 --> 00:25:08,898
_

432
00:25:17,691 --> 00:25:20,826
I'm sorry to drop by like this.

433
00:25:20,861 --> 00:25:22,928
If I sound distracted,
it's only because

434
00:25:22,963 --> 00:25:25,130
I'm waiting for a bed
to be delivered.

435
00:25:25,164 --> 00:25:28,000
My mother is coming
to stay here.

436
00:25:28,034 --> 00:25:30,267
That should be helpful.

437
00:25:30,302 --> 00:25:33,237
- May I?
- Of course.

438
00:25:33,271 --> 00:25:37,074
I'd offer you something,
but I have nothing in the house.

439
00:25:41,013 --> 00:25:43,481
First, let me offer
my apologies.

440
00:25:43,516 --> 00:25:45,082
But with the funeral abroad

441
00:25:45,117 --> 00:25:49,185
and you declining our offer
to have a memorial,

442
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:52,088
I really haven't been sure how
to express our condolences.

443
00:25:52,123 --> 00:25:54,257
It may be the difference
in our cultures,

444
00:25:54,291 --> 00:25:57,193
but we're not ones to wallow.

445
00:25:57,228 --> 00:26:00,764
Well, I'm not sure
if you're aware,

446
00:26:00,798 --> 00:26:03,265
but last year the partners

447
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:05,768
were required
to put up collateral.

448
00:26:05,802 --> 00:26:08,871
And although the firm
has six years to repay,

449
00:26:08,906 --> 00:26:12,875
it was unanimous that we try and help
you through this difficult time.

450
00:26:29,191 --> 00:26:30,892
Again, I'm very sorry
for your loss.

451
00:26:30,927 --> 00:26:34,762
Yes, I hope you feel better.

452
00:26:34,796 --> 00:26:36,797
I think it'll make
a difference.

453
00:26:36,831 --> 00:26:40,079
- How much is it?
- $50,000.

454
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,842
You had no right to fill a man
like that with ambition.

455
00:26:46,942 --> 00:26:49,544
I found this in his wallet.

456
00:26:51,812 --> 00:26:53,780
Who is this?

457
00:26:55,516 --> 00:26:58,251
- I don't know.
- Don't just consider the office.

458
00:26:58,286 --> 00:27:00,220
Think of all the brothels
you frequent.

459
00:27:00,254 --> 00:27:04,458
- I should go.
- Yes, perhaps you should.

460
00:27:10,029 --> 00:27:11,797
I'm truly sorry for your loss.

461
00:27:11,831 --> 00:27:13,899
It's probably difficult
for you to believe,

462
00:27:13,933 --> 00:27:15,968
but it was even
more than $50,000

463
00:27:16,002 --> 00:27:18,036
that already belonged to him,

464
00:27:18,071 --> 00:27:19,905
so don't leave here
thinking that you've done

465
00:27:19,939 --> 00:27:22,040
anything for anyone
but yourself.

466
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:43,494
Hello.

467
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:47,431
Say hi to daddy.

468
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,267
The table's set in there.

469
00:27:50,301 --> 00:27:51,768
I wanted to leave these
out for you.

470
00:27:53,304 --> 00:27:55,070
What is this?

471
00:27:55,105 --> 00:27:57,106
<i>They're the
plans for the pool.</i>

472
00:27:57,141 --> 00:27:59,275
They can start in may
right after the rain.

473
00:27:59,309 --> 00:28:02,245
That's you.

474
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:05,548
- I don't know, Trudy.
It's awfully permanent. - <i>I know.</i>

475
00:28:05,582 --> 00:28:07,650
<i>It'll add tremendous value</i>
<i>to the property.</i>

476
00:28:07,684 --> 00:28:10,019
And lord knows you're so much
better when you get some sun.

477
00:28:10,053 --> 00:28:12,787
Tammy could drown.

478
00:28:12,821 --> 00:28:14,289
What is wrong with you?

479
00:28:14,323 --> 00:28:15,857
I'm sorry.

480
00:28:15,891 --> 00:28:18,226
This doom and gloom--
I'm tired of it.

481
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:41,748
Not one thing you said was true.
No dinner, no chaperone, no conversation.

482
00:28:41,783 --> 00:28:43,916
Stop being demure.
You're already on the bed.

483
00:28:49,756 --> 00:28:52,325
I hoped that you would call.

484
00:28:52,359 --> 00:28:55,161
And I hoped
that you would come.

485
00:28:55,196 --> 00:28:57,096
And not just
for obvious reasons.

486
00:28:57,130 --> 00:29:00,932
I don't believe you.

487
00:29:00,966 --> 00:29:04,936
You know, one of my partners,

488
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:06,938
he ended it all.

489
00:29:08,474 --> 00:29:10,309
Be so sure you were going

490
00:29:10,343 --> 00:29:12,578
someplace better, wouldn't you?

491
00:29:12,612 --> 00:29:17,481
But I think maybe
that place is here.

492
00:29:17,516 --> 00:29:19,917
Why are you saying this?

493
00:29:19,951 --> 00:29:22,152
Would you take LSD with me?

494
00:29:22,187 --> 00:29:24,088
Oh. What?

495
00:29:24,122 --> 00:29:28,759
I love that you're so calm,
but you're adventurous.

496
00:29:28,793 --> 00:29:32,395
And honestly, I need
to take it again

497
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:36,533
to really appreciate here
and I don't wanna do it alone.

498
00:29:36,567 --> 00:29:40,570
And I think if you were
there, then it'd be okay.

499
00:29:40,605 --> 00:29:44,608
Roger, please don't
ask me for anything.

500
00:29:44,642 --> 00:29:47,476
Please don't ask me
to take care of you.

501
00:29:48,878 --> 00:29:50,346
Oh.

502
00:29:56,219 --> 00:29:58,654
Is there anything else
I can do?

503
00:30:08,658 --> 00:30:10,393
Ah.

504
00:30:10,427 --> 00:30:13,862
There you are,
right where you are.

505
00:30:15,565 --> 00:30:18,700
I missed you.

506
00:30:22,638 --> 00:30:25,840
- Ooh!
- Jesus. Come on.

507
00:30:25,874 --> 00:30:27,875
Let's get you to bed.

508
00:30:29,545 --> 00:30:32,680
- Where's your mother?
- She abandoned me.

509
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:40,621
You can't even kiss me?

510
00:30:40,656 --> 00:30:42,924
Just go to the dentist,

511
00:30:42,958 --> 00:30:45,292
because I need you right now.

512
00:30:45,326 --> 00:30:48,162
- Megan.
- Please.

513
00:30:48,196 --> 00:30:50,865
It's the only thing
I'm good for.

514
00:30:50,899 --> 00:30:53,034
What the hell happened today?

515
00:30:53,068 --> 00:30:56,002
This is what you want,
isn't it?

516
00:30:56,037 --> 00:30:58,538
For me to be waiting for you.

517
00:30:58,573 --> 00:31:00,740
That's why you won't
give me a chance.

518
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:03,076
That's not true.

519
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:05,211
I know, I know.

520
00:31:05,245 --> 00:31:09,482
Because it's either that
or I'm terrible.

521
00:31:09,516 --> 00:31:12,317
But how the hell would you low?

522
00:31:12,351 --> 00:31:14,653
You're really drunk.

523
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:17,923
<i>Allo?</i>

524
00:31:17,958 --> 00:31:19,858
Sleep it off.

525
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:31,202
- Oh.
- Where were you?

526
00:31:31,236 --> 00:31:33,004
I have friends in New York.

527
00:31:33,038 --> 00:31:35,439
How could you leave her like
that, drunk out of her mind?

528
00:31:35,474 --> 00:31:39,143
She's married to you.
That's your job.

529
00:31:39,177 --> 00:31:41,012
She left my house a happy girl.

530
00:31:41,046 --> 00:31:43,313
And you show up
and she's miserable.

531
00:31:43,347 --> 00:31:46,883
I know it's hard to watch,
but this is what happens

532
00:31:46,918 --> 00:31:50,787
when you have the artistic temperament,
but you are not an artist.

533
00:31:50,822 --> 00:31:54,791
Take my advice, nurse her
through this defeat

534
00:31:54,826 --> 00:31:57,494
and you shall have
the life you desire.

535
00:31:59,997 --> 00:32:02,598
I have postcards to write.

536
00:32:26,088 --> 00:32:28,990
You almost had a nasty abscess.

537
00:32:29,025 --> 00:32:31,224
You should have had it
extracted days ago.

538
00:32:31,259 --> 00:32:33,527
I kept thinking
it would go away.

539
00:32:33,561 --> 00:32:36,063
Yeah? You're lucky
it didn't lose your jaw.

540
00:32:39,634 --> 00:32:42,703
Just breathe through your nose.

541
00:32:56,884 --> 00:32:59,118
You're in bad shape, Dick.

542
00:33:01,121 --> 00:33:03,188
What are you doing here?

543
00:33:03,222 --> 00:33:06,058
I lost my job when I died.

544
00:33:07,493 --> 00:33:12,030
I'm gonna do you a favor
and take it out.

545
00:33:12,065 --> 00:33:15,266
But it's not your tooth
that's rotten.

546
00:33:15,301 --> 00:33:17,868
Don't go.

547
00:33:19,237 --> 00:33:21,205
Don't leave me.

548
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:26,243
Don't worry.
I'll hang around.

549
00:33:26,277 --> 00:33:27,878
Get it?

550
00:33:34,719 --> 00:33:36,552
You're gonna be sore,

551
00:33:36,587 --> 00:33:40,389
so just take it easy
for the rest of the day.

552
00:33:40,424 --> 00:33:41,825
Fill that prescription
I gave you

553
00:33:41,859 --> 00:33:45,228
and don't smoke for 24 hours.

554
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:56,638
Mrs. Dawes?

555
00:33:56,672 --> 00:34:00,042
Beth, your brother's here
to see you.

556
00:34:00,076 --> 00:34:04,346
Yes, of course.
Come in.

557
00:34:09,451 --> 00:34:11,018
<i>You know,</i>
<i>you're right--</i>

558
00:34:11,053 --> 00:34:13,821
You really do have
the same eyes.

559
00:34:13,856 --> 00:34:15,656
I'm so glad you came.

560
00:34:18,693 --> 00:34:20,194
How are you feeling?

561
00:34:20,229 --> 00:34:23,130
I don't have a brother.

562
00:34:23,164 --> 00:34:25,065
It was the only way
I could get in.

563
00:34:25,099 --> 00:34:27,834
But what are you doing here?

564
00:34:27,869 --> 00:34:31,805
Well, I was worried about you.

565
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:35,075
Oh, that's right.

566
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,148
I'm sorry.

567
00:34:43,349 --> 00:34:44,817
I'm in the wrong room.

568
00:34:44,851 --> 00:34:47,319
But you can still visit.

569
00:34:47,353 --> 00:34:50,589
But I'm here
to visit my friend.

570
00:34:50,623 --> 00:34:54,325
Please. Please,
keep me company.

571
00:35:04,536 --> 00:35:06,537
What's wrong with your friend?

572
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:11,175
He, um...

573
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:20,784
He got involved

574
00:35:20,819 --> 00:35:23,854
with another man's wife.

575
00:35:25,889 --> 00:35:28,191
And that put him
in the hospital?

576
00:35:29,592 --> 00:35:33,629
From the complications.

577
00:35:36,133 --> 00:35:39,235
Why did he do it?

578
00:35:40,603 --> 00:35:43,071
Well...

579
00:35:43,105 --> 00:35:45,573
All the regular reasons,
I guess--

580
00:35:45,607 --> 00:35:47,309
He needed to let off
some steam,

581
00:35:47,343 --> 00:35:50,912
he needed adventure, he needed
to feel handsome again.

582
00:35:50,913 --> 00:35:54,415
He needed to feel
that he knew something.

583
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:56,384
That all this aging
was worth something

584
00:35:56,418 --> 00:35:59,053
because he knew things
young people didn't know yet.

585
00:36:00,722 --> 00:36:02,389
He probably thought
it would be like having

586
00:36:02,423 --> 00:36:06,393
a few tall drinks
and feeling very, very good.

587
00:36:06,427 --> 00:36:10,364
And then he'd go back
to his life and say,

588
00:36:10,398 --> 00:36:12,900
"that was nice".

589
00:36:14,401 --> 00:36:17,270
But then he got sick?

590
00:36:17,304 --> 00:36:20,006
When it went away...

591
00:36:22,176 --> 00:36:23,743
He was heartbroken.

592
00:36:26,713 --> 00:36:31,483
And then he realized everything he
already had was not right either

593
00:36:31,517 --> 00:36:34,286
and that was why
it had happened at all...

594
00:36:36,722 --> 00:36:38,456
And that his life
with his family

595
00:36:38,491 --> 00:36:42,961
was some temporary bandage

596
00:36:42,996 --> 00:36:50,167
on a permanent wound.

597
00:36:50,202 --> 00:36:51,835
Don't worry.

598
00:36:53,005 --> 00:36:55,139
They'll fix him up here.

599
00:36:55,173 --> 00:36:58,409
They're very good.

600
00:37:02,046 --> 00:37:04,347
He'll be fine.

601
00:37:15,292 --> 00:37:18,761
Well, it was nice to meet you.

602
00:37:20,096 --> 00:37:21,864
Good luck with your friend.

603
00:37:48,056 --> 00:37:50,223
Oh, my goodness.

604
00:37:52,761 --> 00:37:55,095
How are you?

605
00:37:55,129 --> 00:37:58,097
- Are you waiting for somebody?
- Nope.

606
00:38:04,204 --> 00:38:06,005
What are you doing here?

607
00:38:06,039 --> 00:38:07,640
Did you lose your job?

608
00:38:07,675 --> 00:38:10,142
No. Did you?

609
00:38:10,177 --> 00:38:12,511
You look good.

610
00:38:12,545 --> 00:38:14,012
How's Megan?

611
00:38:16,916 --> 00:38:19,017
You're kind of new at that job
to be avoiding the office.

612
00:38:19,051 --> 00:38:21,687
Just knocking out the cobwebs.

613
00:38:21,721 --> 00:38:24,022
Someone told me this works.

614
00:38:26,526 --> 00:38:27,960
So it's going well?

615
00:38:27,994 --> 00:38:30,394
Yeah.

616
00:38:30,428 --> 00:38:31,863
Is that okay?

617
00:38:31,897 --> 00:38:35,399
That's what happens
when you help someone--

618
00:38:35,433 --> 00:38:38,102
They succeed and move on.

619
00:38:40,138 --> 00:38:41,973
Don't you want them to?

620
00:38:42,007 --> 00:38:45,542
I'm proud of you.

621
00:38:45,576 --> 00:38:47,744
I just didn't know
it would be without me.

622
00:38:47,778 --> 00:38:50,547
Well, put me on your call list.

623
00:38:50,581 --> 00:38:52,281
What are you working on?

624
00:38:52,316 --> 00:38:54,618
We're trying to get that women's
cigarette you were after.

625
00:38:54,652 --> 00:38:57,086
Oh, God, I miss
that easy money.

626
00:38:57,121 --> 00:39:00,490
It's easy to have;
It's not easy to win.

627
00:39:01,758 --> 00:39:05,160
You'll beat it.

628
00:39:05,194 --> 00:39:07,997
Well, I'm going to Virginia
to tour the factory.

629
00:39:08,031 --> 00:39:10,032
I'm going on a plane.

630
00:39:10,066 --> 00:39:14,336
- Richmond's nice.
- It's not Paris.

631
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:17,005
And I'm going
with Frank Gleason.

632
00:39:19,207 --> 00:39:22,276
- Will you give my love to Megan?
- Sure.

633
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:26,247
- Oh, we should all get together.
- Yes.

634
00:39:33,755 --> 00:39:36,456
Howdy, partner!

635
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:38,692
What do you say
we get off in Harrison,

636
00:39:38,726 --> 00:39:41,261
get back on the train,
and go get into some trouble?

637
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:43,764
- What?
- I'm on my own.

638
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:45,265
You can say you fell asleep.

639
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:47,133
You did.

640
00:39:47,168 --> 00:39:49,769
You are the most disgusting
person I have ever seen.

641
00:39:49,803 --> 00:39:51,571
Oh, come on!

642
00:39:51,605 --> 00:39:54,506
How could you do that
to that woman?

643
00:39:54,541 --> 00:39:58,143
You just couldn't wait to get her in
the hospital and erase her brain.

644
00:40:00,781 --> 00:40:02,982
It's you?

645
00:40:03,016 --> 00:40:05,817
She always spreads her legs
for the first chump she can find.

646
00:40:07,753 --> 00:40:09,454
What are you doing?

647
00:40:09,488 --> 00:40:11,522
- Hey!
- Break it up!

648
00:40:14,093 --> 00:40:17,095
- Knock it off!
- Gentlemen, calm down!

649
00:40:17,096 --> 00:40:18,739
You okay, buddy?

650
00:40:19,231 --> 00:40:21,431
You, Max Schmeling,
you go that way.

651
00:40:21,466 --> 00:40:22,866
- He started it.
- Out!

652
00:40:22,901 --> 00:40:25,903
- My things are in the bar.
- That's not a surprise.

653
00:40:28,172 --> 00:40:30,641
You're a real prick,
you know that?

654
00:40:30,675 --> 00:40:32,476
Listen, buddy, you're gonna
give it a couple of minutes,

655
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:33,978
you're gonna go
down there and apologize.

656
00:40:34,012 --> 00:40:36,480
To him? Never.

657
00:40:36,514 --> 00:40:39,082
You gotta ride the train every
day and he's a fellow commuter.

658
00:40:39,116 --> 00:40:42,151
- And I don't like fighting on my train.
- Oh, it's your train.

659
00:40:42,152 --> 00:40:43,920
Are you paying to ride on it?

660
00:40:43,954 --> 00:40:45,755
We're paying <i>you</i> to ride on it.

661
00:40:45,789 --> 00:40:48,725
You work for us, so why don't you
go down there and apologize to him?

662
00:40:48,759 --> 00:40:51,961
- I'm about to throw you off.
- Go ahead, you fat piece of crap.

663
00:40:51,996 --> 00:40:54,596
I am an officer
of the New Haven line.

664
00:40:54,631 --> 00:40:57,733
Well, I'm president of the
howdy doody circus army.

665
00:40:57,767 --> 00:41:00,368
- That's it, you're coming--
- Get your hands off me!

666
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,208
You can't do that!

667
00:41:07,243 --> 00:41:09,610
Get off the train.
Harrison!

668
00:41:09,645 --> 00:41:12,346
<i>Next stop, Harrison.</i>

669
00:41:16,506 --> 00:41:18,006
What on earth happened?

670
00:41:18,041 --> 00:41:19,507
Were you in another
car accident?

671
00:41:19,542 --> 00:41:21,743
The car's fine.
There's not a scratch on it.

672
00:41:21,777 --> 00:41:24,412
I'm not worried about the car.

673
00:41:24,447 --> 00:41:26,481
My goodness, look at you.

674
00:41:26,515 --> 00:41:29,584
I fell asleep
and ran into a ditch.

675
00:41:29,618 --> 00:41:31,419
Come with me.

676
00:41:36,859 --> 00:41:40,127
I can't live like this--

677
00:41:40,162 --> 00:41:42,029
Knowing you're out there
working so hard

678
00:41:42,064 --> 00:41:44,732
and then wondering if you're going
to come home and in what condition.

679
00:41:44,766 --> 00:41:47,301
I'll come home.

680
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:52,105
I think you were right.

681
00:41:52,139 --> 00:41:53,773
And first thing
tomorrow morning,

682
00:41:53,807 --> 00:41:56,209
we're going to find you
an apartment in the city.

683
00:43:34,735 --> 00:43:39,139
I think this is where
the staircase goes.

684
00:43:42,876 --> 00:43:45,078
I'm going to have
the same view as you, Don.

685
00:43:46,413 --> 00:43:48,914
Congratulations.

686
00:43:56,990 --> 00:43:59,525
There she is.
There's our beauty.

687
00:43:59,559 --> 00:44:01,760
Nice to see you again.

688
00:44:01,795 --> 00:44:03,295
You look perfect.

689
00:44:03,863 --> 00:44:05,630
When do we start?

690
00:44:05,665 --> 00:44:07,432
When they're ready.

691
00:44:12,037 --> 00:44:14,105
I can't believe
this is happening.

692
00:44:14,139 --> 00:44:17,209
<i>Miss Calvet,</i>
<i>would you step in, please?</i>

693
00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:19,644
You know I love you.

694
