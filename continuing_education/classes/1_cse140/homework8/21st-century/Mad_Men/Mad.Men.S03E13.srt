1
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:57,683
<i>Sorry I'm late.</i>

2
00:00:58,425 --> 00:01:01,826
That's okay. I was occupied.
How are you today, Don?

3
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:04,720
I'm well, Connie. Thank you. How are you?

4
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:08,767
I'm afraid I have some serious business
to discuss. Have a seat.

5
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:22,104
I was at McCann Erickson yesterday,
and they let me know

6
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:27,016
that effective January 1
they're buying Putnam, Powell & Lowe.

7
00:01:27,687 --> 00:01:28,745
What?

8
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:32,649
I'm sorry, but that means
I'm going to have to move

9
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,887
- my New York properties elsewhere.
- Why?

10
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:41,066
Because P.P.L. Owns Sterling Cooper.
You're all gonna be part of McCann.

11
00:01:44,003 --> 00:01:48,064
- So we're all gone.
- Sterling... I don't know.

12
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:51,744
Cooper will definitely be put on an ice floe.

13
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:56,312
But you're a prize pig.
You'll make more money, pick up stock.

14
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,808
You won't have to live and die
with every account.

15
00:01:58,918 --> 00:02:03,252
Bullshit. It's a sausage factory.
I turned them down three years ago.

16
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:09,293
This happens all the time, Don.
It's business.

17
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:13,023
I'd ask them to put you
on the Caribbean hotels,

18
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:15,828
but I don't think
I'm gonna stay there much longer.

19
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:19,302
- You come and go as you please.
- Yes, I do.

20
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:24,402
And you don't give a crap that my future
is tied up in this mess because of you?

21
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:28,174
You wanted my account,
and you were lucky to get it.

22
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,075
And you wanted to play with me.

23
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:35,120
Kick me around, knock me down to size
while you called me "son. "

24
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,650
I get it now, Connie. It's business.

25
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:47,327
You know,

26
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:53,404
I got everything I have on my own.

27
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:59,041
It's made me immune to those
who complain and cry because they can't.

28
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:05,144
I didn't take you for one of them, Don.

29
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:08,080
Are you?

30
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:21,196
- Some other time we'll try again.
- Yes.

31
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:24,331
Have a nice holiday.

32
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:50,519
Sixty-nine cents a bushel.

33
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:54,658
- That's half last year.
- We ain't gonna make it.

34
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:58,002
It's as fair a shake as we could get,

35
00:03:58,104 --> 00:04:01,164
considering that Allotment Act
made no allotment for wheat.

36
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:03,071
You were supposed to get us a good deal.

37
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:06,236
There's a surplus.
What the hell's he supposed to do?

38
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:09,543
- Well, I ain't selling at that.
- You've got no choice.

39
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:15,451
Sure I do. I've got a silo.
Store it till winter when the price goes up.

40
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:18,021
- How you gonna pay your mortgage?
- That's none of your concern.

41
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:22,618
- Settle down. We're all in this together.
- No, we ain't, thanks to you.

42
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:28,425
- I take care of mine. You take care of yours.
- Damn it, Whitman, this is a cooperative.

43
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:29,728
No more.

44
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,831
Now get out of my kitchen.

45
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:55,322
What's so urgent that you had to wake me?

46
00:04:55,528 --> 00:04:59,464
Conrad Hilton told me P.P.L.
Is being sold and us along with it.

47
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:04,695
- So you knew about this?
- No, but it makes sense.

48
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:08,368
- All that short-term thinking.
- So what do we do?

49
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:15,704
There's nothing to do. I have a contract.
You have a contract. Roger has a contract.

50
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:17,448
So that's it?

51
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:19,811
You're losing your business
and you don't care?

52
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,616
- I lost my business last year.
- Well, do something about it.

53
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:29,350
If Sterling Cooper is for sale,
why don't we buy it from P.P. L?

54
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:31,854
We could put everything back
the way it was.

55
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:36,025
Young men love risk because
they can't imagine the consequences.

56
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:38,465
And you old men love
building golden tombs

57
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:43,668
and sealing the rest of us in with you.
You're done. You know that, right?

58
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,608
So I should just throw away my fortune?

59
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:49,807
I don't have the rest of my life
to earn it back.

60
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:53,852
- I understand. I'll let you get back to sleep.
- Why do you care?

61
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:56,955
Because I'm sick of being batted around
like a ping-pong ball.

62
00:05:57,056 --> 00:06:00,389
Who the hell is in charge? A bunch of
accountants trying to make $1 into $1.10?

63
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:03,462
I want to work.
I want to build something of my own.

64
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:07,522
How do you not understand that?
You did it yourself 40 years ago.

65
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:09,632
That's true.

66
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:14,805
But I'm not sure you have a stomach
for the realities.

67
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:16,601
Try me.

68
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:21,339
Well, we're gonna need accounts.

69
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:26,278
American Tobacco, that's most
of Sterling Cooper, but that's Roger.

70
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:29,114
I understand that.

71
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:33,687
Did Hilton tell you when this blessed event
is supposed to take place?

72
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,350
New Year's Day.

73
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:42,693
- We have to talk to Roger now.
- You talk to him.

74
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:45,531
Do you want to do this or not?

75
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,602
Honey...

76
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:55,041
Honey, he probably feels bad about
the president getting shot on his watch.

77
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:58,982
Now, stop reading the paper.
She's obsessed.

78
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:02,281
It's the most interest that girl's ever had
in a book depository.

79
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:04,754
McCann is buying P.P.L.,

80
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:08,653
and is absorbing Sterling Cooper
along with it.

81
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,758
- What?
- Conrad Hilton told me this morning.

82
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:17,097
Christ. From one john's bed to the next.
What a joke.

83
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:22,035
Don and I have been discussing the idea
that we buy the company back.

84
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:26,308
- Really? Why?
- Because we don't want to go to McCann.

85
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:36,254
And now you're sniffing around
because I have a golden pork chop

86
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:38,186
dangling from my neck.

87
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:42,253
It's more than that.
You know Bert's done for.

88
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:44,726
Now it's about Bert, huh?

89
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:47,527
I want to see what you look like
with your tail between your legs.

90
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:50,466
You sold your birthright
so you could marry that trollop.

91
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:54,768
Here we go. This is your pitch?
Well, move along.

92
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:58,839
I'm not gonna throw it all away because
he doesn't want to work at McCann.

93
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:00,469
You want to work there?

94
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,048
You don't value what I do
any more than they do.

95
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:08,553
I was wrong. I learned that with Hilton.
I can sell ideas, but I'm not an account man.

96
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:11,451
You're not good at relationships,
because you don't value them.

97
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:14,185
- I value my relationship with you.
- You do now.

98
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:15,351
I do.

99
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,333
I'm sorry. I've got points, stock.

100
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,032
If I'm useless, so be it.

101
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:29,301
There's a deck chair somewhere
with my name on it.

102
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:35,842
You're right, Roger. If you've lost
your appetite, you should retire.

103
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:41,142
Of course, I've seen that before.
So have you. Men my age, even younger,

104
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:45,953
they play golf, go on vacation,
lose their appetite.

105
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,852
In three years...

106
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:55,761
Join or die?
Jesus, Bert, he was doing better.

107
00:08:57,203 --> 00:09:00,468
- You know it's true.
- You're still gonna outlive me.

108
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:04,632
We have to try.

109
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,949
So you do want to be
in advertising after all.

110
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:17,353
Go upstairs.

111
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:20,623
- Daddy just got home.
- I'll be up.

112
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:32,200
- Do you want me to go, too?
- Please sit down.

113
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:47,182
I made an appointment
with a divorce attorney,

114
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:49,481
and I suggest you do the same.

115
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:54,925
Come on, Betts.
What are you doing seeing a lawyer?

116
00:09:55,394 --> 00:09:59,353
I want to be civilized about this.
Please don't act surprised.

117
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:02,457
You haven't been yourself.

118
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:06,038
Maybe you need to see a doctor.
A good one this time.

119
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:09,198
Because I'd have to be sick
to want out of this?

120
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:14,043
You've had a tough couple of weeks.
We all have.

121
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:21,750
I've had a tough year.

122
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:26,051
I felt I should tell you rather
than just let you get a phone call at work.

123
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:29,286
Well, forget it.
I'm not gonna let you break up this family.

124
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:31,590
I didn't break up this family.

125
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:53,214
Lane, please shut the door and have a seat.

126
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:56,651
Certainly.

127
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:06,755
We know McCann Erickson bought P.P.L.,

128
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:09,596
and we know that makes
Sterling Cooper chattel.

129
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:10,930
Who told you that?

130
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:13,733
Someone outside of this building
who knows.

131
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,170
Well, they're wrong.

132
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:18,402
Lane, we've worked next to each other
for a year.

133
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:21,542
Don't act like a stranger. We've got tea.

134
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:28,785
Well, I suppose
you'll find out soon enough,

135
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,489
but your information
isn't completely correct.

136
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:36,357
Only Sterling Cooper is being sold.
P.P.L., well, will remain P.P.L.

137
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:40,262
That doesn't change our plans.
We want to buy back the company.

138
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:43,961
We're willing to offer
the purchase price plus 12%.

139
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:49,169
- It's worth more than that now.
- What did you get?

140
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:51,607
I'm not going to say, but more than that.

141
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:56,273
I apologize you had to find out this way.
Believe me, it wasn't my decision.

142
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:03,713
I've quite enjoyed it here.

143
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:13,830
Well, they've only got me for a year.
You for what? Three?

144
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:16,094
We'll make another run at it.

145
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:21,571
The only grounds for divorce in this state
are absence of a spouse,

146
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:24,837
incurable insanity,
life imprisonment or adultery.

147
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:27,135
Well, he hasn't been faithful.

148
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:30,044
Do you have any witnesses
or corroboration?

149
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,607
Not really.

150
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:35,118
It wouldn't matter anyway,
with both parties at fault.

151
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:39,450
- No. We haven't... We aren't...
- Ken. Ken, what are you doing?

152
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:44,122
You think the governor needs
another scandal on the ticket?

153
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:48,794
I am sorry for presuming, Mrs. Draper.
That was wrong.

154
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:54,502
- So what do I do?
- I know it's hard to understand,

155
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,701
but the state of New York
doesn't want anyone to get divorced.

156
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:00,711
That's why people go to Reno. It's painless.

157
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:06,374
I met my second wife. You stay there
for six weeks to establish residency.

158
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:10,112
Mr. Draper doesn't even need to go,
just consent.

159
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:12,650
I see.

160
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:16,250
We need to discuss what you want
in terms of settlement.

161
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:20,527
- Whatever I'm entitled to.
- Give us a second.

162
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:31,139
- You don't need what he can provide.
- Henry, I have three children.

163
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,473
I'll take care of them,
and I'll take care of you.

164
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:37,605
I don't want you owing him anything.

165
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:46,890
We want to get this done
as soon as possible.

166
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:50,219
- Saint John, I'm glad I caught you.
- What is it?

167
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:53,861
Mr. Sterling, Cooper and Draper
have learned of the sale.

168
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,360
<i>- What do they know?
- It was a mixture of truth and half truth.</i>

169
00:13:57,536 --> 00:13:59,527
They knew about McCann,
but they were under the belief

170
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:01,970
that P.P.L. Was being sold as well.

171
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:04,276
<i>- And what did you tell them?
- That they were wrong.</i>

172
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,871
They even wanted to bid
for Sterling Cooper.

173
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:08,970
12% above our purchase price.

174
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:16,911
Listen, I apologize, Lane.
Obviously the news is getting out.

175
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:20,855
- What news?
- P.P.L. Is being sold as well.

176
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:25,524
What? Why wasn't I told?

177
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:29,597
Didn't seem pertinent. Trying to keep
our company calm as well as theirs.

178
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:33,403
<i>- Well, where's my place in this?
- With McCann, I suppose.</i>

179
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:39,002
There, there, Lane. They know
you're essential to the transition.

180
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:41,978
<i>- And then what?
- You'll prove yourself irreplaceable.</i>

181
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:43,845
You always do.

182
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:46,709
<i>Lane.</i>

183
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:51,553
<i>- Yes?
- Don't be disheartened.</i>

184
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:55,825
- I'll put in a good word for you.
- Thank you.

185
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:58,421
No, thank you.

186
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:42,800
We've got a month till winter,
then we'll be set.

187
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:46,071
This is what I showed the man
from the bank today.

188
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:48,846
What are they gonna do? Sell this place?

189
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:52,076
The bank's gonna get their payday
right after me.

190
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:55,120
We got nothing,
and we're about to have less.

191
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,814
Fine! I'll sell.

192
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:02,660
I'll sell my crop for nothing. Dick.

193
00:16:03,195 --> 00:16:06,824
- What are you doing?
- I'll drive it to Chicago tonight.

194
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:08,732
You're drunk.

195
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,974
Go. He can barely stand.

196
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:20,942
Calm down.

197
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:24,313
Whoa! Here.

198
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:27,148
Calm down.

199
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:31,918
It ain't gonna rain.

200
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:52,669
Pa! Daddy! Daddy!

201
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:30,615
Your guests have arrived.

202
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:35,411
Close the door. Have a seat.

203
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:39,051
- What's he doing here?
- You're gonna read us your will?

204
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:41,820
- I want the Cadillac.
- I couldn't sleep.

205
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:45,959
And I thought,
why don't we go to McCann directly?

206
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:49,357
- Because you can't. It's done.
- You're not even gonna ask?

207
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:51,060
I did, yesterday.

208
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:57,098
And you were right. P.P.L. Is being sold,
so it seems we're all going to McCann.

209
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,605
They cut you loose.

210
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:02,370
I want you to find out
what the price was and give us a shot.

211
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:06,508
Enough. I should fire you for even trying
to involve me in this conspiracy.

212
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:08,552
Go ahead.
It's the only thing you did well here.

213
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:11,782
- Don, let it go.
- I did a great many things here.

214
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:17,625
Have another. It's 9:30, for God's sake.

215
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:22,162
Jesus, that's right.

216
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:27,303
You have absolute authority to fire anyone.

217
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:31,803
Fire us.

218
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,476
Fire us. Sever our contracts. Let us go.

219
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:41,913
- Can you do that?
- Why would I?

220
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:43,853
Because once this sale goes through,

221
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:47,357
you'll be thrown overboard, and you'll be
a corpse knocking against their hull.

222
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,654
Nothing good ever came
from seeking revenge.

223
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:52,252
Nonsense. We'll make you a partner.

224
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:58,635
I should think this is worth more than that.

225
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:01,701
So we're negotiating.

226
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:04,868
- We'll put your name on the door.
- I don't know.

227
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,946
- Do you know how to do what he does?
- I don't.

228
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:21,392
It could be done, but getting you, us,
out of here isn't the difficult part.

229
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:25,658
- We need accounts.
- Let's say we have Lucky Strike.

230
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,863
And although that's, let's see,
$23 million in billings...

231
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:32,334
Twenty-four.

232
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:37,366
- We'd still need another third for cash flow.
- Well, I can't take anyone else

233
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:41,572
or Lee Garner, Sr. Won't think
that he's special. What about Hilton?

234
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:44,646
- No.
- Can we get any of our other accounts?

235
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,674
We'll get them.

236
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:51,452
If I were to send a telex in at noon today
that you've all been sacked,

237
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:53,115
it's after close of business in London.

238
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:57,628
It would remain unnoticed
until Monday morning there, 2:00 a. m. Here.

239
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:01,833
That gives us today and the weekend
to first gather accounts

240
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:07,133
and then a skeleton staff to service them.
And of course we would have to obtain

241
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:10,572
all the materials required
for continuity of service.

242
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:13,567
Obtain? We have to steal everything.

243
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:18,575
Anyone approached must be a certainty.

244
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:22,278
If news spreads, they'll lock us out.

245
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:29,193
Do we vote or something?

246
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:38,927
Well, gentlemen, I suppose you're fired.

247
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:45,843
We'll, it's official.
Friday, December 13th, 1963.

248
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:49,746
Four guys shot their own legs off.

249
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:54,316
Allison, Mr. Pryce has requested
an office-wide memo.

250
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:58,822
"The office is closed this weekend.
All work suspended. Carpet cleaning. "

251
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:02,052
- Can you get me Mr. Campbell?
- He didn't come in today. He's sick.

252
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,288
Call his house. It's important.
Peggy, my office.

253
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:10,625
What do I bring?

254
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,674
Shut the door. Sit down.

255
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:24,646
I know we have to roll out Western Union
by New Year's.

256
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:28,982
- I don't have art. There's no one there.
- They're selling the company.

257
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:33,116
- Again?
- I'm starting a new agency.

258
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:35,624
I need you here Sunday evening
to get your things

259
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:38,753
and to help us collect
whatever accounts we end up taking.

260
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:40,297
- Really?
- Yes.

261
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,963
- Who else is going?
- Why do you need to know that?

262
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:48,235
- Because it's important.
- I can't tell you.

263
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:52,275
Peggy, we are being bought my McCann.
Do you know what that means?

264
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:55,141
You just assume I'll do whatever you say.

265
00:21:56,915 --> 00:21:59,679
Just follow you like some nervous poodle.

266
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,812
- I'm not gonna beg you.
- Beg me? You didn't even ask me.

267
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:08,919
Fine, I'm asking you.

268
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:12,893
I've had other offers, you know,

269
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:16,725
that came with a sales pitch
about opportunity.

270
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:20,437
Everyone thinks you do all my work.

271
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:23,302
Even you.

272
00:22:27,946 --> 00:22:32,849
I don't want to make a career out of being
there so you can kick me when you fail.

273
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:38,021
- I guess I'll have to talk to Kurt and Smitty.
- I guess so.

274
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:53,993
- Where the hell are my pajamas?
- Will you please relax?

275
00:22:55,273 --> 00:22:59,141
Trudy, I called in sick today
because I had my interview with Ogilvy.

276
00:22:59,244 --> 00:23:01,405
- I have to look sick.
- You do.

277
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:15,326
- What a pleasant surprise.
- Sorry to drop in.

278
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:19,355
- How are you?
- Better than my husband.

279
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:23,462
And how are you?
We've been calling all day.

280
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:26,036
- May I take your coats?
- We're fine.

281
00:23:28,874 --> 00:23:31,138
I'm going to change the sheets.

282
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:46,648
- Is everything okay?
- McCann bought P.P.L., and us.

283
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:52,059
- What? Again?
- We need to talk to you. It's serious.

284
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:54,627
We're not firing you.

285
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:59,033
Am I getting a few more adjectives
added to my title?

286
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:04,333
- Don't bother. I have other plans.
- Peter, may I speak to you for a moment?

287
00:24:07,412 --> 00:24:12,111
Pete, we're starting a new agency.
We're here to talk to you about joining us.

288
00:24:14,052 --> 00:24:16,646
Wait a minute. They're letting you go?

289
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:20,214
Keep it to yourself,
but I'm taking American Tobacco.

290
00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:24,455
We need another 7-10 million in billings
for cash flow or something.

291
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:27,524
What do you have
in your saddlebag so far?

292
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:31,591
I don't have a saddlebag.
I don't know what you're talking about.

293
00:24:32,337 --> 00:24:36,535
Pete, I don't blame you for bailing out,
the way you've been treated.

294
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:41,069
- So Kenny turned you down?
- We haven't spoken to Ken yet.

295
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:45,542
And yes, we want your accounts,
but we also want your talent.

296
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:48,983
Really? And what are my talents?

297
00:24:49,554 --> 00:24:51,715
- You'll do what it takes.
- No.

298
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:56,051
I want to hear it from him.

299
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:04,064
It's not hard for me to say, Pete.
You saw this coming. We didn't.

300
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:08,806
In fact, you've been ahead
on a lot of things.

301
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:12,966
Aeronautics, teenagers, the negro market...

302
00:25:14,746 --> 00:25:17,408
We need you to keep us looking forward.

303
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:21,484
I do, anyway.

304
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:27,981
I want to be a partner,
and I want my name in the lobby.

305
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:32,723
There's not gonna be a lobby.

306
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:45,299
North American Aviation, Secor Laxatives,
Gillette, jai alai, maybe Pampers.

307
00:25:46,244 --> 00:25:50,442
That's close to 8 million already.
I don't think you get conditions.

308
00:25:51,182 --> 00:25:54,208
We'll make you a partner
if you can deliver by Sunday.

309
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:55,479
Sunday?

310
00:25:55,820 --> 00:26:00,723
We'll leave the name and the title as a goal.
Like it or not, that works with you.

311
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:06,660
I'd like to say I'll think about it,
but I don't think that's an option, is it?

312
00:26:13,638 --> 00:26:15,367
I'm not really sick.

313
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:20,568
Welcome aboard.

314
00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:27,846
- Good night, Trudy.
- Good night, gentlemen.

315
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:31,954
- What if I come up short?
- That's not an option.

316
00:26:33,658 --> 00:26:34,989
Good night.

317
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:44,699
I want you to call Hubert Adams at Secor.
His number's in my Rolodex.

318
00:26:44,803 --> 00:26:47,636
I threw it under the bed. Try him at home.

319
00:26:48,573 --> 00:26:52,600
Tell him I'll meet him at the St. Regis at 7:30
and sound like a secretary.

320
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:54,609
I have to get dressed.

321
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:04,088
- I can't believe he was gonna leave.
- That little shit.

322
00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:09,727
Look, they still have a picture
of Kennedy up.

323
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:14,865
Although, what are they gonna do?
Take it down and put up Lyndon Johnson?

324
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:17,628
Not in this place.

325
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:23,263
I've acted like I've started a business
my whole life, but I inherited it.

326
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:28,073
I need an attorney.

327
00:27:30,615 --> 00:27:34,051
- Divorce.
- So it's true, huh?

328
00:27:36,888 --> 00:27:39,755
- What are you talking about?
- Henry Francis.

329
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,929
- Who?
- Jesus.

330
00:27:47,132 --> 00:27:51,694
- Right when things were almost normal.
- I need you to tell me what you know.

331
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:54,997
Margaret's friends with his daughter.

332
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:58,472
- Are they sleeping together?
- I don't know.

333
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:04,381
It came from his daughter.
He talks about her.

334
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:11,286
It sounds like it's serious.
I was gonna tell you. No, I wasn't.

335
00:28:11,956 --> 00:28:13,651
I thought you knew.

336
00:28:15,593 --> 00:28:18,562
I'm sorry I told you. Believe me.

337
00:28:33,411 --> 00:28:35,242
I am sorry about that.

338
00:28:43,955 --> 00:28:45,149
Wake up.

339
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:49,017
- He's sleeping.
- I don't care.

340
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:51,322
Who the hell is Henry Francis?

341
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:55,926
No one.

342
00:28:57,035 --> 00:29:00,027
- Stop it. Stop it!
- Who the hell is he?

343
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:03,866
- Why do you care?
- Because you're good,

344
00:29:03,975 --> 00:29:06,273
and everyone else in the world is bad.

345
00:29:06,377 --> 00:29:08,572
- You're drunk.
- You're so hurt.

346
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:11,709
So brave with your little white nose
in the air.

347
00:29:11,816 --> 00:29:15,217
- All along you've been building a life raft.
- Get out.

348
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:18,712
- You never forgave me.
- Forgave what?

349
00:29:20,725 --> 00:29:24,422
- That I've never been enough?
- You got everything you ever wanted.

350
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:26,497
Everything! And you loved it.

351
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:29,260
And now I'm not good enough
for some spoiled mainline brat?

352
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:30,800
That's right!

353
00:29:32,737 --> 00:29:34,602
You won't get a nickel.

354
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:39,733
And I'll take the kids.
God knows they'll be better off.

355
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:41,744
I'm going to Reno,

356
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:44,314
and you're going to consent,
and that's the end of this.

357
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:47,907
Don't threaten me. I know all about you.

358
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,112
You're a whore.

359
00:29:54,826 --> 00:29:56,293
You know that?

360
00:30:15,914 --> 00:30:18,007
I want you out of the house.

361
00:30:27,258 --> 00:30:28,885
Hold the elevator.

362
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:37,295
- They called you in, too?
- Yes, they did.

363
00:30:42,473 --> 00:30:46,307
- I'll admit it. I'm a little scared.
- Of what?

364
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:52,107
- Why are you here?
- I don't know. Cooper called me.

365
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:57,249
First they're cleaning the carpets,
now they're not. Why are you here?

366
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:00,215
Work.

367
00:31:04,762 --> 00:31:07,253
Hey, everybody, Harry Crane is here.

368
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:11,132
Relax, Pete, we're expecting him.

369
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:13,804
- What's going on?
- Why are you here?

370
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:17,265
I'm sorry, what's going on?

371
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:21,037
P.P.L. Has been sold to McCann.
We're starting a new agency.

372
00:31:21,145 --> 00:31:24,308
We'd like you to join us
as our new head of media.

373
00:31:27,418 --> 00:31:30,683
- Are you kidding?
- Yes. Yes, we are. Happy birthday.

374
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:33,919
We need your answer.

375
00:31:36,594 --> 00:31:39,961
- I should really call my wife.
- Mr. Crane... Harry.

376
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:46,631
This matter is secret and time-sensitive.
If you turned us down and elect to be

377
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:51,402
a mid-level cog at McCann Erickson,

378
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:55,838
we'll have to lock you in the storeroom
until morning.

379
00:31:57,682 --> 00:31:59,616
I'm sure you understand.

380
00:32:01,719 --> 00:32:02,777
Pete.

381
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:05,285
We were hoping
you could decipher these job sheets.

382
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:09,053
- Where exactly are these materials?
- I never look at these.

383
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:14,859
Can't we just take everything?

384
00:32:15,733 --> 00:32:18,258
That's good thinking,
but we don't know where anything is.

385
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:20,462
No one knows how this works?

386
00:32:21,172 --> 00:32:23,072
Let me make a phone call.
I'll take care of this.

387
00:32:23,174 --> 00:32:26,075
- No. No more conspirators.
- I'll be discreet.

388
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,745
Where's Don?

389
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,610
What did we do?

390
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:43,087
- Nothing.
- Then why are we in the living room?

391
00:32:45,596 --> 00:32:48,360
We want to tell you something, because...

392
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:54,232
Well, it's going to be a little bit of a change.
Your father is going to be moving out.

393
00:32:58,076 --> 00:33:02,479
Now, we'll still be living here,
and he'll come to visit.

394
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:07,848
- Then why is he going?
- Because...

395
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,493
It'll just be temporary.

396
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:19,657
- Like when you lived in the hotel?
- Yes.

397
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:21,893
It'll be different.

398
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:30,073
- Is it because I lost your cufflinks?
- No, it has nothing to do with you.

399
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:34,810
That's not what I mean.

400
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:42,118
- I love you both. You know that.
- Then why are you going?

401
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:46,456
I'm not going.

402
00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:51,386
I'm just living elsewhere.

403
00:33:51,562 --> 00:33:54,690
That's going.
You say things and you don't mean them,

404
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:57,927
- and you can't just do that.
- Sally, sweetheart.

405
00:33:58,903 --> 00:34:00,871
- Go away.
- Sally, stop it.

406
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:05,005
You said you'd always come home.

407
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:09,573
I will.

408
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:13,842
It's just a different home.

409
00:34:16,854 --> 00:34:19,118
Will you be here for Christmas?

410
00:34:19,857 --> 00:34:23,258
- You'll get to have two Christmases.
- I only want one.

411
00:34:23,795 --> 00:34:25,660
Did you make him leave?

412
00:34:27,031 --> 00:34:29,226
No. We both decided it.

413
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:32,196
You made him sleep in Gene's room,
and it's scary in there.

414
00:34:32,303 --> 00:34:34,294
Listen to me, both of you.

415
00:34:35,673 --> 00:34:39,609
I will be here. You can call me,
and I will answer and I will be here.

416
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:42,474
- Sally. Sally.
- Let her go.

417
00:34:43,548 --> 00:34:46,108
Please don't go. I don't want you to.

418
00:34:56,894 --> 00:34:58,828
Nobody wants to do this.

419
00:35:01,966 --> 00:35:04,230
But I need you to be a big boy.

420
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:29,358
- You look awful.
- Can I come in?

421
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:45,037
Do you want anything?

422
00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:48,642
Yes, I do.

423
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:54,240
You were right.

424
00:35:58,055 --> 00:36:01,616
I've taken you for granted
and I've been hard on you,

425
00:36:04,729 --> 00:36:08,688
but only because I think I see you
as an extension of myself.

426
00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:13,593
And you're not.

427
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:19,633
- Well, thank you for stopping by.
- Please. Sit down.

428
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:32,550
Do you know why
I don't want to go to McCann?

429
00:36:32,657 --> 00:36:35,319
Because you can't work for anyone else.

430
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:37,216
No.

431
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:44,391
Because there are people out there
who buy things, people like you and me,

432
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:48,569
and something happened.

433
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,403
Something terrible.

434
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:58,271
And the way that they saw themselves

435
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,214
is gone.

436
00:37:10,127 --> 00:37:12,220
And nobody understands that.

437
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:16,997
But you do.

438
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:23,240
And that's very valuable.

439
00:37:26,844 --> 00:37:27,970
Is it?

440
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:33,844
With you or without you, I'm moving on.

441
00:37:38,222 --> 00:37:40,816
And I don't know if I can do it alone.

442
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:45,954
Will you help me?

443
00:37:54,972 --> 00:37:56,564
What if I say no?

444
00:37:59,343 --> 00:38:01,607
You'll never speak to me again.

445
00:38:04,548 --> 00:38:05,537
No.

446
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:11,050
I will spend the rest of my life
trying to hire you.

447
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:25,363
Mrs. Harris, what a pleasure to see you.

448
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:29,265
- What is she doing here?
- I said I'd be discreet.

449
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:33,105
- Tell them what to do.
- I made a list and I called some movers.

450
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:35,542
Can you read these?
Do you know where this stuff is?

451
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:38,774
Yes. Of course you'll need the job bags
on all these accounts.

452
00:38:38,883 --> 00:38:41,818
We'll also need logo files,
all the film we can find

453
00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:45,082
- and negatives which aren't actually here.
- There you go.

454
00:38:45,189 --> 00:38:48,352
Very good. Now I can pack.

455
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:52,020
- Sorry I'm late.
- Hi.

456
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:58,729
Joan. What a good idea.
Well, you're here. Who did you bring?

457
00:38:59,403 --> 00:39:02,930
North American Aviation, Secor,
jai alai, Samsonite.

458
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:05,971
- Clearasil.
- Really?

459
00:39:07,611 --> 00:39:10,171
- I made it.
- Where do we start?

460
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:14,415
- Well, I'd start in the art department.
- It's locked.

461
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:22,985
Great.

462
00:39:28,432 --> 00:39:30,366
I'll start in my office.

463
00:39:34,238 --> 00:39:36,638
Joanie, I can't read your writing.

464
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:40,371
It's perfectly clear. "Correspondence. "

465
00:39:44,315 --> 00:39:47,773
I'm tired.
Peggy, can you get me some coffee?

466
00:39:48,919 --> 00:39:49,908
No.

467
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:55,491
Did you wash your hands?

468
00:39:58,262 --> 00:39:59,889
Hold the elevator.

469
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:04,298
Greg is gonna kill me.

470
00:40:05,035 --> 00:40:08,061
I'm at the Roosevelt,
but I'll need you to find me an apartment.

471
00:40:08,172 --> 00:40:10,436
- Furnished?
- For the time being.

472
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:13,134
I'm sorry. Good night.

473
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:23,346
Go ahead, fellows.

474
00:40:37,201 --> 00:40:41,399
How long do you think it'll take us
to be in a place like this again?

475
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:46,000
I never saw myself working
in a place like this.

476
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,893
Don't bother.

477
00:41:23,948 --> 00:41:25,575
We've been robbed!

478
00:41:27,084 --> 00:41:30,212
He's waiting on the line.
It's his third attempt.

479
00:41:32,723 --> 00:41:34,281
Saint John, how are you?

480
00:41:34,558 --> 00:41:37,152
What in God's name
is going on over there?

481
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:40,226
I think at this point it should be very clear.

482
00:41:40,798 --> 00:41:44,632
You're fired. You're fired for costing
this company millions of pounds.

483
00:41:44,735 --> 00:41:49,069
You're fired for insubordination!
You're fired for lack of character!

484
00:41:49,373 --> 00:41:53,173
Very good. Happy Christmas. Mr. Hooker.

485
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:59,111
I've been sacked. Please have my office
and things put in storage at this address.

486
00:41:59,216 --> 00:42:02,913
- What's happened?
- You're a sharp boy. You'll figure it out.

487
00:42:04,588 --> 00:42:08,217
So let's see.
I have Peggy and Pete sharing the desk.

488
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:11,556
Don, we'll replace one of these couches
with a table for you,

489
00:42:11,662 --> 00:42:13,789
and we're adding
two additional phone lines.

490
00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:16,389
Media will be in the bedroom
with the television.

491
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,331
Accounts gets the bed.

492
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:21,129
And no one is to come to this office.

493
00:42:21,238 --> 00:42:23,638
If you have meetings,
please take them elsewhere.

494
00:42:23,741 --> 00:42:27,233
I don't want them in the lobby
or the bar of this hotel.

495
00:42:29,847 --> 00:42:31,542
Well, look at that.

496
00:42:34,985 --> 00:42:37,215
Good morning.
Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce.

497
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:39,016
How may I help you?

498
00:42:41,258 --> 00:42:43,726
Yes, Harry, it's room 435.

499
00:42:46,297 --> 00:42:49,027
He didn't leave a note. Nothing.

500
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:50,528
Where is he?

501
00:42:50,634 --> 00:42:54,195
I just heard from John Deere.
Pete tried to poach them on Saturday.

502
00:42:54,305 --> 00:42:56,500
He must have gone with Draper.

503
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:06,543
Damn it.

504
00:43:08,152 --> 00:43:10,746
Sure. Everything's exactly the same.

505
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:16,720
Don and I will both be on the account.
Thanks, Bill. Okay, bye-bye.

506
00:43:18,462 --> 00:43:20,828
- Hello, everybody.
- Lovely! What are you doing here?

507
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:25,163
I brought lunch. There's every kind
of sandwich imaginable and a cake.

508
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:28,098
- Thank you, Trudy.
- Isn't this exciting?

509
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:29,398
It is.

510
00:43:31,008 --> 00:43:34,944
- This looks great, Trudy.
- I know how you boys and girls can be.

511
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:39,606
- There's food.
- Thank God.

512
00:43:54,732 --> 00:43:55,858
Draper residence.

513
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:00,103
It's me.

514
00:44:05,342 --> 00:44:08,778
I'm not sure where I'm staying right now,
but I'll be working out of the Pierre.

515
00:44:11,081 --> 00:44:12,139
Okay.

516
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:20,516
Listen, Betts, I want you to know
I'm not gonna fight you.

517
00:44:26,196 --> 00:44:27,493
Thank you.

518
00:44:30,968 --> 00:44:32,959
I hope you get what you always wanted.

519
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:39,806
You will always be their father.

520
00:44:44,748 --> 00:44:45,806
Okay.

521
00:44:48,419 --> 00:44:50,979
Well, goodbye.

522
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:57,220
Goodbye.

523
00:45:13,243 --> 00:45:14,232
Really?

524
00:45:14,344 --> 00:45:19,043
You know, if you leave your shoes outside
the door here, somebody polishes them.

525
00:45:19,149 --> 00:45:20,480
Hello, Don.

526
00:45:21,285 --> 00:45:23,947
- How was your morning?
- Very productive.
