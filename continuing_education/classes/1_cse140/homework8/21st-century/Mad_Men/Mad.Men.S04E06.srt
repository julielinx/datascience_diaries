1
00:00:10,162 --> 00:00:11,880
But the good news is I
think it's gonna be between us.

2
00:00:11,999 --> 00:00:13,543
Bad news is the best
man is gonna win.

3
00:00:13,695 --> 00:00:15,503
You can't even watch
them for a second!

4
00:00:15,591 --> 00:00:17,119
It's like... Leaving
them with nobody!

5
00:00:17,224 --> 00:00:18,384
Because you're so
good with them.

6
00:00:18,672 --> 00:00:19,479
What does your husband do?

7
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:21,104
I'm not married.

8
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:22,872
Don is important.

9
00:00:23,031 --> 00:00:24,264
You know, I found that guy.

10
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:26,455
I'm gonna hard on you,

11
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:28,271
only because I think
I see you as an

12
00:00:28,384 --> 00:00:29,544
extension of myself.

"the cure for the common cold"

21
00:01:30,696 --> 00:01:32,864
Is the idiom I'm playing off.

22
00:01:32,932 --> 00:01:35,267
It's an idiom.
Did you know that?

23
00:01:37,436 --> 00:01:40,639
Uo other than your summer
internship at Needham,

24
00:01:40,706 --> 00:01:42,474
Do you have any actual
advertising experience?

25
00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:44,909
The cure for the common chair.

26
00:01:44,977 --> 00:01:46,511
That's Roger's favorite.

27
00:01:46,579 --> 00:01:48,480
Roger sterling.

28
00:01:48,547 --> 00:01:51,016
He's the guy
I shook hands with
when I came in.

29
00:01:51,083 --> 00:01:53,485
What did Roger
think of this ad?

30
00:01:53,552 --> 00:01:55,620
What, are you kidding me?
Everybody loves that.

31
00:01:55,688 --> 00:01:57,822
It's the opposite
of what you expect.

32
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:59,391
That's what I'm interested in.

33
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:01,359
Why is it in your book?

34
00:02:01,427 --> 00:02:02,627
I've got a bunch
of them in there...

35
00:02:02,695 --> 00:02:03,928
Marlboro man, maidenform.

36
00:02:03,996 --> 00:02:06,731
I like to put in work
that I admire.

37
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,067
Don't you ever tear things
out of magazines?

38
00:02:09,135 --> 00:02:12,637
Yes, but I don't
put them in my book.

39
00:02:15,775 --> 00:02:18,376
"aspiration's as good
as perspiration."

40
00:02:18,444 --> 00:02:20,078
That's not how it goes.

41
00:02:22,481 --> 00:02:24,149
Look,

42
00:02:24,216 --> 00:02:26,318
I'm a 24-year-old kid.

43
00:02:26,385 --> 00:02:29,521
I want to be in the ad game.

44
00:02:29,588 --> 00:02:32,390
I know I've got
a lot to learn,
but I'm a hard worker.

45
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:34,826
I'd sweep up
the floors around here.

46
00:02:34,894 --> 00:02:36,728
I don't know
if Roger told you that.

47
00:02:36,796 --> 00:02:38,196
He did talk to you, didn't he?

48
00:02:38,264 --> 00:02:39,864
He did.

49
00:02:41,534 --> 00:02:43,735
It was really a pleasure
to meet you, Danny.

50
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:50,642
- I wish you the best of luck.
- Best of luck in... in what?

51
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:53,378
- What do you mean?
- You trailed off.

52
00:02:53,446 --> 00:02:54,779
We'll let you know.

53
00:02:54,847 --> 00:02:56,815
Do you know a good place
to eat around here?

54
00:02:59,585 --> 00:03:01,553
Tell my secretary you're hungry

55
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,222
And see what she suggests.

56
00:03:12,598 --> 00:03:14,165
Are we on "candid camera"?

57
00:03:15,735 --> 00:03:17,469
I don't want to jump
on his grave or anything,

58
00:03:17,536 --> 00:03:19,904
But there's no way he's 24.

59
00:03:19,972 --> 00:03:22,507
I'm 25.

60
00:03:23,976 --> 00:03:25,510
What's his connection to Roger?

61
00:03:25,578 --> 00:03:27,579
Besides being delusional?

62
00:03:27,646 --> 00:03:29,581
He's Jane Seigel's cousin.

63
00:03:31,217 --> 00:03:33,184
it's a relief to see

64
00:03:33,252 --> 00:03:35,954
Someone worse than me
and really know it.

65
00:03:36,021 --> 00:03:38,089
Don't get used to it.

66
00:03:39,525 --> 00:03:41,860
Well, you know,
I look at glo-coat

67
00:03:41,927 --> 00:03:44,062
And see how far
everything's come...

68
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,830
You know, my work.

69
00:03:45,898 --> 00:03:47,832
Glo-coat.

70
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,502
You finish something,
you find out everyone loves it

71
00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:52,103
Right around the time that

72
00:03:52,171 --> 00:03:53,671
It feels like
someone else did it.

73
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:57,942
Is that your speech
for the Clios?

74
00:03:58,010 --> 00:03:59,344
They don't have speeches.

75
00:03:59,412 --> 00:04:01,713
We're going to win.

76
00:04:01,781 --> 00:04:03,148
Just because it got nominated

77
00:04:03,215 --> 00:04:04,682
Doesn't mean they're going
to give me an award.

78
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,217
Aren't you excited?

79
00:04:06,285 --> 00:04:07,919
I try not to think about it.

80
00:04:07,987 --> 00:04:09,654
Then you must be excited.

81
00:04:09,722 --> 00:04:12,490
Well, it'd be good
for the agency.

82
00:04:12,558 --> 00:04:16,628
Grey doubled their value
in five years and it was
all based on awards.

83
00:04:18,097 --> 00:04:19,931
You got anything on Vicks?

84
00:04:19,999 --> 00:04:23,101
- Actually,
it's Vick chemical.
- Answer the question.

85
00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:25,403
We're very behind.

86
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:28,473
Your new art director has been
waiting for synchronicity,

87
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:30,942
<i>Which involves me coming up
with a bunch of ideas,</i>

88
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:34,446
Chasing him down
and having him draw
all of them and lose them.

89
00:04:34,513 --> 00:04:37,248
He's your new
art director too,
and you have a deadline.

90
00:04:37,316 --> 00:04:39,951
And don't think
you can spend Monday
hiding behind corners

91
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:43,054
And trying not
to make eye contact.
I will find you.

92
00:04:43,122 --> 00:04:45,790
- I'm not the problem.
- You are,

93
00:04:45,858 --> 00:04:49,093
Because an is talented
and more experienced.

94
00:04:49,161 --> 00:04:52,096
You need to learn
how to work with him,
not the other way around.

95
00:04:56,168 --> 00:04:57,602
Well, good luck this afternoon.

96
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:59,671
You're not
supposed to say that.

97
00:04:59,738 --> 00:05:02,073
Oh.
Well, break a leg.

98
00:05:05,544 --> 00:05:07,579
Charlie Chaplin was
very lonely.

99
00:05:07,646 --> 00:05:10,181
That tramp...
too much of a sad sack.

100
00:05:10,249 --> 00:05:12,317
Laurel and hardy...
they were better,

101
00:05:12,384 --> 00:05:15,320
Except Hardy was
so mean to Laurel.
I hated that.

102
00:05:17,089 --> 00:05:19,491
Why am I talking
about silent movies?

103
00:05:19,558 --> 00:05:24,128
I suppose
as part of the chapter
on your childhood?

104
00:05:24,196 --> 00:05:26,197
That part of my book is
getting bigger and bigger.

105
00:05:26,265 --> 00:05:28,366
<i>- Why is that?

106
00:05:28,434 --> 00:05:29,767
who is it?

107
00:05:32,104 --> 00:05:33,671
I thought I should come in
and tell you this in person.

108
00:05:33,739 --> 00:05:35,573
That kid...
a very very cute prank.

109
00:05:35,641 --> 00:05:37,575
Caroline...
to be continued.

110
00:05:37,643 --> 00:05:39,644
That's a good idea.

111
00:05:39,712 --> 00:05:41,012
I've been to the Clios before.

112
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,814
We're gonna want
to show up prepared.

113
00:05:42,882 --> 00:05:45,617
His book...

114
00:05:45,684 --> 00:05:48,486
- ...It was filled
with old ads.

115
00:05:48,554 --> 00:05:50,388
Plagiarism...
that's resourceful.

116
00:05:50,456 --> 00:05:52,857
He had five originals...

117
00:05:52,925 --> 00:05:55,793
- They were
all the same thing.
- I told him to be himself.

118
00:05:55,861 --> 00:05:58,129
- That was
pretty mean, I guess.

119
00:05:59,732 --> 00:06:02,367
- So when does he start?
- The first of never.

120
00:06:03,903 --> 00:06:05,603
Well, you haven't
been married for a while,

121
00:06:05,671 --> 00:06:07,338
So you've probably
forgotten how these
transactions work.

122
00:06:07,406 --> 00:06:09,173
If I don't hire Jane's cousin,

123
00:06:09,241 --> 00:06:11,409
It's probably going
to cost me a personal
gift expenditure

124
00:06:11,477 --> 00:06:13,845
Of between $500 and $1,000.

125
00:06:13,913 --> 00:06:16,147
- When are we leaving?
- Right after life cereal.

126
00:06:16,215 --> 00:06:17,715
To new business...

127
00:06:19,451 --> 00:06:21,185
And victory at the Waldorf.

128
00:06:21,253 --> 00:06:22,387
I mean it.
You deserve it.

129
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:27,292
So I can s show you
what's popular,
what's unique,

130
00:06:27,359 --> 00:06:29,060
And the only thing I ask
is that you call me don.

131
00:06:29,128 --> 00:06:32,230
Well, don, I can't say
I know my fu that well.

132
00:06:32,298 --> 00:06:34,098
I know my mother had
a chinchilla...

133
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:36,801
I was always on
the verge of a romantic
relationship with it.

134
00:06:36,869 --> 00:06:39,637
- Is this for your mother?
- I bet you never hear that.

135
00:06:39,705 --> 00:06:43,141
I don't. Would you like
to give me a price range?

136
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:46,344
Well, that's an
interesting question.
I have a unique problem.

137
00:06:46,412 --> 00:06:49,013
I need to spend a lot
but be careful not
to spend too much.

138
00:06:49,081 --> 00:06:51,849
Not a unique problem.
I don't want to be forward,

139
00:06:51,917 --> 00:06:53,885
But can I assume this is
some kind of an apology?

140
00:06:53,953 --> 00:06:56,321
No no no, I know exactly
how much that costs.

141
00:06:56,388 --> 00:06:59,157
This is "I'm getting
to know you, but I don't
want to scare you."

142
00:06:59,224 --> 00:07:00,658
I know what we're gonna do.

143
00:07:00,726 --> 00:07:02,694
So now it's "we"?

144
00:07:05,931 --> 00:07:07,565
It's always the right size

145
00:07:07,633 --> 00:07:10,134
And nothing says
mink like mink.

146
00:07:10,202 --> 00:07:12,403
It's a nice way
to ease into things

147
00:07:12,471 --> 00:07:14,305
And you can
always come back
for the rest of it.

148
00:07:14,373 --> 00:07:16,307
How about we split
the difference so they
wear them to their waist?

149
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:18,076
It's the most popular
this year.

150
00:07:21,146 --> 00:07:23,615
"why wait for a man
to buy you a fur coat?"

151
00:07:25,317 --> 00:07:28,186
That's a dumb question.
Who does your work?

152
00:07:28,253 --> 00:07:29,954
- I do.
- Really?

153
00:07:30,022 --> 00:07:33,191
Yeah. It's an interest
of mine and they
let me do it.

154
00:07:36,295 --> 00:07:38,796
Look at that.
Can I give you a call?

155
00:07:38,864 --> 00:07:41,833
First of all,
you need 20 of those.

156
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,801
And second of all, no.

157
00:07:43,869 --> 00:07:46,004
I just want you
to call that number

158
00:07:46,071 --> 00:07:47,639
So I can give you
some very specific
delivery instructions.

159
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:50,508
Of course,
Mr. Sterling.

160
00:07:52,344 --> 00:07:54,045
So what do I owe you?

161
00:07:54,113 --> 00:07:57,015
I saw you leave the office
with something under your arm.

162
00:07:57,082 --> 00:08:00,051
You don't know what it is.

163
00:08:00,119 --> 00:08:02,520
The guy in the elevator
thought it was a hydrogen bomb.

164
00:08:02,588 --> 00:08:05,690
<i>- It's a beautiful box.
- Mm-hmm.</i>

165
00:08:05,758 --> 00:08:07,692
Skip the radio play.
Open it.

166
00:08:12,798 --> 00:08:17,168
Oh, Roger, you shouldn't have.

167
00:08:17,236 --> 00:08:18,970
you like it?

168
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:20,838
I don't know what to say.

169
00:08:20,906 --> 00:08:21,973
Try it on.

170
00:08:24,276 --> 00:08:26,077
But first take off the dress.

171
00:08:26,145 --> 00:08:28,513
One gift at a time.

172
00:08:30,649 --> 00:08:32,717
What is this,
an owner's manual?

173
00:08:36,955 --> 00:08:38,756
It's Noah's ark.

174
00:08:42,061 --> 00:08:43,461
It's out of line is what it is.

175
00:08:46,365 --> 00:08:47,398
So?

176
00:08:50,002 --> 00:08:52,804
I love it.
It's perfect.

177
00:08:52,871 --> 00:08:55,707
And I think it's a bit much.

178
00:08:55,774 --> 00:08:58,576
If you don't
kiss me after that,
I'm gonna believe you.

179
00:09:07,152 --> 00:09:10,288
When I wear it,
I'll think of everything that
happened the night I got it.

180
00:09:20,199 --> 00:09:22,567
<i>- Caroline!</i>

181
00:09:22,634 --> 00:09:25,169
Get in here.
I think I finally
have a work story.

182
00:09:28,173 --> 00:09:30,975
Joan! What's keeping them?

183
00:09:31,043 --> 00:09:34,479
Life.

184
00:09:34,546 --> 00:09:36,647
When do you have to
leave for the Clios?

185
00:09:36,715 --> 00:09:37,982
I was late for
the Emmys last year.

186
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:40,084
Red Skelton gave my seat away.

187
00:09:40,152 --> 00:09:42,286
I would surmise,
due to the usual nature
of your stories,

188
00:09:42,354 --> 00:09:44,088
That that's someone of note.

189
00:09:45,724 --> 00:09:48,359
The good news is our friends
at the cereal company

190
00:09:48,427 --> 00:09:50,161
Have been grounded
in Philly due to wind.

191
00:09:50,229 --> 00:09:52,930
- What's good about that?
- And the bad news is...

192
00:09:55,667 --> 00:09:57,769
We only have an hour before
we're due at the Clios.

193
00:09:57,836 --> 00:10:01,205
Sorry, kids.
Game called
on account of wind.

194
00:10:01,273 --> 00:10:03,474
Well, if it's all
about a sendoff,
I'll have a 7&7.

195
00:10:03,542 --> 00:10:06,410
You have legs. Don?

196
00:10:06,478 --> 00:10:08,646
Make it simple but significant.

197
00:10:08,714 --> 00:10:11,082
It's Friday.

198
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:13,050
For all we know,
they're going to
turn around and go home

199
00:10:13,118 --> 00:10:16,387
- And we'll have
to reschedule.
- Is Joan going with you?

200
00:10:16,455 --> 00:10:19,323
Yes. We only had
four tickets.

201
00:10:19,391 --> 00:10:20,925
There'll be a lot
of other people's
clients there.

202
00:10:22,828 --> 00:10:24,595
<i>- Thank you, Joan.
Peggy, anything?</i>

203
00:10:24,663 --> 00:10:26,464
I have work to do.

204
00:10:30,903 --> 00:10:33,471
<i>"we represent the majority
of the people in Alabama</i>

205
00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:35,940
<i>Who hate niggerism,
catholicism,</i>

206
00:10:36,008 --> 00:10:38,509
<i>Judaism and all the isms
in the whole world."</i>

207
00:10:38,577 --> 00:10:41,212
<i>So said Robert creel
of the Alabama Ku Klux Klan.</i>

208
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,747
Somebody got it to Goldwater.

209
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,916
Apparently he pissed blood.

210
00:10:44,983 --> 00:10:46,450
<i>"...Needs our help."</i>

211
00:10:49,488 --> 00:10:51,989
This again? Really?

212
00:10:52,057 --> 00:10:54,625
Clara asked.

213
00:10:54,693 --> 00:10:56,694
Clara asked to see your reel?

214
00:10:56,762 --> 00:10:59,430
I just wanted
to see that Klan one.

215
00:10:59,498 --> 00:11:02,934
- He said it never aired.
- Which makes it less
impressive, Clara.

216
00:11:03,001 --> 00:11:04,335
Girls, do you mind?

217
00:11:20,385 --> 00:11:23,721
Well, all the girls are gone.
What do you want?

218
00:11:23,789 --> 00:11:25,890
Are you going
to use the k.K.K.
To sell cough drops?

219
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:27,358
It's better than waiting on you

220
00:11:27,426 --> 00:11:29,126
To bring me something
that'll get my juices flowing.

221
00:11:29,194 --> 00:11:32,296
Should I get
Megan back in here?
Maybe she's not repressed.

222
00:11:32,364 --> 00:11:36,200
Why's it so hard
for you to accept that man's
natural state is nude?

223
00:11:36,268 --> 00:11:38,736
- Because I'm civilized.
- Because you're brainwashed

224
00:11:38,804 --> 00:11:41,172
<i>By society
into thinking it's dirty.</i>

225
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,041
You take away all this crap
and you'd see it's not.

226
00:11:44,109 --> 00:11:46,010
It's natural
and it's beautiful.

227
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:48,212
Have you been
yelled at by don yet?

228
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:51,415
- I'm not scared of him.
- So that's a no.

229
00:11:51,483 --> 00:11:53,384
He said Monday...
and I'm not working
this weekend.

230
00:11:53,452 --> 00:11:56,587
Okay okay. Jesus.
Are you on the rag?

231
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:00,024
It'll get done.
Let's go.

232
00:12:03,862 --> 00:12:06,731
Well, I'd say you're lucky
the glo-coat brass isn't here.

233
00:12:06,798 --> 00:12:09,367
The minute you win
they know the ad's arty,
then you're out of business.

234
00:12:09,434 --> 00:12:11,702
Turns out there's
almost 50 awards.

235
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:14,171
Let's say 10 minutes
a piece, tt's...

236
00:12:14,239 --> 00:12:15,573
Holy crap.

237
00:12:15,641 --> 00:12:17,541
Roger, you remember
Ned Elliot from k&e.

238
00:12:17,609 --> 00:12:19,010
Of course.
What are you in for?

239
00:12:19,077 --> 00:12:20,778
New England merchants bank,

240
00:12:20,846 --> 00:12:22,613
Best local under $2,000.

241
00:12:22,681 --> 00:12:24,982
Stop bragging, will you?

242
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:26,684
Good luck, don.

243
00:12:29,855 --> 00:12:32,223
Well well, if it isn't
pebbles and bamm-bamm.

244
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:34,625
Leave any drinks
for the rest of us?

245
00:12:34,693 --> 00:12:37,695
Don draper,
Roger sterling, this is
major-general Frank Alvin.

246
00:12:39,698 --> 00:12:41,699
Roger, have you
had the pleasure
of meeting Ted Chaough?

247
00:12:41,767 --> 00:12:44,902
Is that how you say it?
C-h-a-o-u-g-h?

248
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:46,904
Hey, writers, how many
extra vowels is that?

249
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,974
Let's head due South, general.

250
00:12:50,042 --> 00:12:51,842
Well, I hope this doesn't
drag on like last year.

251
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:53,577
Oh, wait.
You weren't here.

252
00:12:57,716 --> 00:12:59,750
General Rufus t. Bullshit.

253
00:12:59,818 --> 00:13:01,852
I've met that guy before.

254
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,689
- In the war?
- No, in a commercial
for Bay rum.

255
00:13:04,756 --> 00:13:07,591
Chao-guh-guh hired
an actor to impress someone.

256
00:13:07,659 --> 00:13:09,460
Last time I saw
the general, he had
a parrot on his shoulder.

257
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:14,231
That was not
a business proposition.

258
00:13:14,299 --> 00:13:16,968
You catch
more flies with honey.

259
00:13:17,035 --> 00:13:20,471
Oh, great...
actual flies.

260
00:13:22,674 --> 00:13:24,642
Phillip, how are you?

261
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:26,944
- You remember Joan Harris.
- Nice to see you.

262
00:13:27,012 --> 00:13:28,679
Mr. Cosgrove,
nice to see you again.

263
00:13:28,747 --> 00:13:30,414
I'm surprised he would
bring you over here.

264
00:13:30,482 --> 00:13:32,416
You know, we miss birds-eye
more than we miss Kenny.

265
00:13:32,484 --> 00:13:35,052
Well, that's why
I wanted to say hello.

266
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,687
I hear the old team's
getting back together.

267
00:13:36,755 --> 00:13:38,322
What team?

268
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:41,525
Uh, Phil, that's not
a sure thing.

269
00:13:43,762 --> 00:13:47,598
Well, I'll say this
about guyer...

270
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:49,900
<i>- They don't have don.
Take your
seats, please.</i>

271
00:13:49,968 --> 00:13:52,636
Well, we should
sit down. Good luck.

272
00:13:55,474 --> 00:13:57,908
Judas priest.
Are we merging with guyer?

273
00:13:57,976 --> 00:13:59,677
Talk to lane.

274
00:14:02,848 --> 00:14:07,184
Welcome to the sixth annual
American television
commercials awards.

275
00:14:07,252 --> 00:14:10,654
We're here to honor
creative excellence

276
00:14:10,722 --> 00:14:12,089
In advertising and design...

277
00:14:12,157 --> 00:14:15,159
I just ran into
Ken cosgrove.

278
00:14:15,227 --> 00:14:17,395
don't talk to me
right now.

279
00:14:17,462 --> 00:14:19,830
<i>And I do mean everything.</i>

280
00:14:23,268 --> 00:14:25,536
<i>I don't know if it was
that funny, but thank you.</i>

281
00:14:25,604 --> 00:14:29,140
I have to tell you
I am very impressed
you got this gig.

282
00:14:29,207 --> 00:14:32,910
Yes. Well, thank you
for making it easier.

283
00:14:32,978 --> 00:14:34,812
Wally, it's me.

284
00:14:37,582 --> 00:14:39,950
You know, when I was
coming up at y&r,

285
00:14:40,018 --> 00:14:43,020
You were very inspiring.

286
00:14:43,088 --> 00:14:45,656
<i>Raymond Rubicam said
you were a genius.</i>

287
00:14:45,724 --> 00:14:47,591
Great to see you...

288
00:14:47,659 --> 00:14:49,860
I mean, actually alive
and everything.

289
00:14:49,928 --> 00:14:52,797
get your hands off me.

290
00:14:52,864 --> 00:14:55,433
What's with the French service?

291
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,501
God, I miss working
with that guy.

292
00:14:57,569 --> 00:15:00,471
- I feel like
I've already won.

293
00:15:00,539 --> 00:15:01,772
Well, I'm afraid
that'll be the limit

294
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,108
To the public speaking
portion of our show.

295
00:15:05,744 --> 00:15:08,212
And, gentlemen,
let's pace ourselves.

296
00:15:10,782 --> 00:15:13,284
<i>In the first category...
that of apparel...</i>

297
00:15:13,351 --> 00:15:15,019
<i>The nominees are...</i>

298
00:15:18,723 --> 00:15:20,658
Hey, that's five.

299
00:15:20,725 --> 00:15:22,726
If you really worked
on the Johnson campaign,

300
00:15:22,794 --> 00:15:25,029
- Why are you here?
- Because nobody at d.D.B.

301
00:15:25,097 --> 00:15:27,098
Even keeps track
of who does what...

302
00:15:27,165 --> 00:15:30,801
Except "the Daisy ad."
big deal.

303
00:15:30,869 --> 00:15:33,704
The Klan is probably
the best thing I'll be
near my entire life.

304
00:15:33,772 --> 00:15:35,673
Well, let me tell you...

305
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,241
I had a lot to do
with glo-coat...

306
00:15:37,309 --> 00:15:39,910
A lot...
the idea especially.

307
00:15:39,978 --> 00:15:42,146
The kid?

308
00:15:42,214 --> 00:15:44,748
Don put the whole
cowboy thing on it.

309
00:15:44,816 --> 00:15:46,684
I don't know if it was
that revolutionary.

310
00:15:46,751 --> 00:15:50,554
It was jarring,
but more cute than I like.

311
00:15:50,622 --> 00:15:52,523
I know I'm not supposed to go,

312
00:15:52,591 --> 00:15:55,559
But when
the nomination came in,

313
00:15:55,627 --> 00:15:57,761
Don let everybody
pat him on the back.

314
00:15:57,829 --> 00:16:00,231
He didn't even look at me

315
00:16:00,298 --> 00:16:02,099
And I was...
I was right there.

316
00:16:04,002 --> 00:16:06,604
I was clapping
and he thought
I was clapping for him.

317
00:16:06,671 --> 00:16:08,472
Who claps for themselves?

318
00:16:11,109 --> 00:16:15,079
Okay, I'm gonna riff
for a few minutes

319
00:16:15,147 --> 00:16:19,517
And just sorta speechatize
the whole Vicks experience.

320
00:16:19,584 --> 00:16:21,185
Should I come back
when you're through?

321
00:16:21,253 --> 00:16:23,287
No, toots, grab a pencil.

322
00:16:23,355 --> 00:16:25,389
Someone's gonna want
to get it down

323
00:16:25,457 --> 00:16:27,291
Before it heads
into the stratosphere.

324
00:16:27,359 --> 00:16:29,193
Why don't you
write down my ideas?

325
00:16:29,261 --> 00:16:30,861
Look, I read your brochure.

326
00:16:30,929 --> 00:16:33,197
I have no interest
in the temperance movement.

327
00:16:36,268 --> 00:16:38,135
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

328
00:16:46,444 --> 00:16:49,813
And now for best cleansers,
waxes and polishes.

329
00:16:49,881 --> 00:16:52,750
<i>This is us.
Glass wax spray's</i>

330

<i>"gobbles up dirt,"

331
00:16:56,655 --> 00:16:58,389

00:16:58,456 --> 00:17:00,724
<i>- Great.

<i>And pledge,

337
00:17:14,973 --> 00:17:17,575
And the winner is

00:17:17,642 --> 00:17:19,510
Glo-coat,
"billy the kid"...

339
00:17:21,446 --> 00:17:23,113
<i>...Sterling Cooper
draper Pryce.</i>

340
00:17:31,056 --> 00:17:32,923
- Congratulations, don.
- Thank you.

341
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:54,178
<i>- Next up,
competing in...
- let me see it.</i>

342
00:17:54,246 --> 00:17:56,880
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

343
00:17:56,948 --> 00:17:59,049
- What's going on, dear?
- Well, I ran over

344
00:17:59,117 --> 00:18:01,318
Because the people
from life cereal
rented a car

345
00:18:01,386 --> 00:18:03,087
And now they're waiting
at the office.

346
00:18:03,154 --> 00:18:05,356
- Right now?
- We'll reschedule.

347
00:18:05,423 --> 00:18:07,191
Maybe I can convince them
to stay for the weekend.

348
00:18:07,259 --> 00:18:09,560
No no, they want
to see our presentation.

349
00:18:09,628 --> 00:18:11,662
What do you say we put
a cherry on this thing?

350
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:14,064
- Aye aye, sir.
- Really?

351
00:18:19,442 --> 00:18:21,176
So the Schusters move
into what used to be
the Harrington house.

352
00:18:21,243 --> 00:18:23,478
Meanwhile, Betty gets
extremely jealous

353
00:18:23,546 --> 00:18:25,880
When she sees Allison dancing
with Rodney at the after-party.

354
00:18:25,948 --> 00:18:27,949
But then Michael asked
Betty to dance with him

355
00:18:28,017 --> 00:18:29,784
And also dances with Claire

356
00:18:29,852 --> 00:18:33,054
And that is all I can
tell you about the next
few weeks of "Peyton place."

357
00:18:33,122 --> 00:18:34,689
How the heck do
you know all this?

358
00:18:34,757 --> 00:18:36,424
They send me the scripts.

359
00:18:36,492 --> 00:18:38,927
I need to see them.
It's my job.

360
00:18:38,995 --> 00:18:40,962
I can't believe Connie goes
through with their wedding.

361
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:43,231
It is a surprise.
I agree.

362
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:50,939
What more do I need to say?

363
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:53,575
- It's heavy.
- Don, you remember...

364
00:18:53,642 --> 00:18:55,710
Jim and Dennis,
glad you could make it.

365
00:18:55,778 --> 00:18:57,879
I can't thank you
enough for waiting.

366
00:18:57,947 --> 00:19:00,682
<i>Oh, don't think about it.
I've been unwinding</i>

367
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,984
As Mr. Crane ruins
"Peyton place" for us.

368
00:19:03,052 --> 00:19:05,687
perfect. Let's get to it.

369
00:19:05,755 --> 00:19:07,922
- Roger, thank you.
- I'll be on my way,

370
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:10,258
But first...
victory lap!

371
00:19:10,326 --> 00:19:12,527
Come on, don, Pete,
crane, Jimmy Olsen!

372
00:19:19,869 --> 00:19:22,170
Wrap it up quickly, gents.
We have an after-party
to attend.

373
00:19:22,238 --> 00:19:23,938
Thank you, Roger.

374
00:19:24,006 --> 00:19:25,507
Is everyone set?

375
00:19:25,574 --> 00:19:27,409
That's one word for it.

376
00:19:27,476 --> 00:19:29,344
Joey, you didn't start
without me, did you?

377
00:19:29,412 --> 00:19:31,012
No, don.
I would not do that.

378
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,548
Okay, everybody ready?

379
00:19:35,151 --> 00:19:36,851
So...

380
00:19:38,187 --> 00:19:41,456
Life cereal...
delicious, crispy

381
00:19:41,524 --> 00:19:42,891
And it's got
a big name, you know.

382
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:44,392
And I know you want
to associate it with health,

383
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,894
But that's not fun. Joey?

384
00:19:47,196 --> 00:19:48,797
Ah. You know what?
I've got it.

385
00:19:51,067 --> 00:19:53,435
Look, there are
sweeter cereals than this,

386
00:19:53,502 --> 00:19:55,870
But I kept
thinking about, you know,

387
00:19:55,938 --> 00:19:58,373
Nostalgia.

388
00:19:58,441 --> 00:20:00,442
<i>How you remember
something in the past</i>

389
00:20:00,509 --> 00:20:03,678
And it feels good,
but it's a little bit painful,

390
00:20:03,746 --> 00:20:05,580
Like when you were a kid.

391
00:20:05,648 --> 00:20:07,182
<i>that's the truth.
And "life,"</i>

392
00:20:07,249 --> 00:20:09,617
That's a scary word
to anyone at any age.

393
00:20:09,685 --> 00:20:10,585
So how do we make it fun?

394
00:20:13,956 --> 00:20:15,790
<i>"eat life
by the bowlful."</i>

395
00:20:15,858 --> 00:20:18,059
A little kid,
big bowl, big spoon.

396
00:20:18,127 --> 00:20:20,929
Kids see the giant bowl
of cereal and they smile

397
00:20:20,996 --> 00:20:23,498
Because, you know,
they'd eat a box of it
if they could.

398
00:20:23,566 --> 00:20:25,633
And moms see it
and they get this twinge

399
00:20:25,701 --> 00:20:27,035
Of how little
their kid still is

400
00:20:27,103 --> 00:20:29,170
Even though they have
to deal with life.

401
00:20:29,238 --> 00:20:31,039
Get those two together
in a market

402
00:20:31,107 --> 00:20:32,340
And I think we're going
to sell some cereal

403
00:20:33,642 --> 00:20:35,443
That's all I have.

404
00:20:35,511 --> 00:20:37,879
I think if you'd
invite us into the rest
of your company,

405
00:20:37,947 --> 00:20:39,647
We could build
a Saturday morning TV show

406
00:20:39,715 --> 00:20:41,149
Around the whole
quaker oats family.

407
00:20:41,217 --> 00:20:43,151
In fact, it could be called
the "quaker oats family."

408
00:20:43,219 --> 00:20:46,321
I like the bowlful,

409
00:20:46,388 --> 00:20:49,557
But I think it's kinda smart
for regular folks, you know?

410
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:52,494
- The irony, I guess.
- Children look at the picture.

411
00:20:52,561 --> 00:20:54,696
Moms look at the irony.

412
00:20:54,763 --> 00:20:57,298
Yeah, but when
I go back to Chicago,

413
00:20:57,366 --> 00:20:59,467
All they're
gonna wanna hear
is a slogan,

414
00:20:59,535 --> 00:21:02,103
And I don't think
this is gonna cut it.

415
00:21:02,171 --> 00:21:05,240
Well, why don't we let
don work that over?

416
00:21:05,307 --> 00:21:07,308
We can either talk
on Monday if you're
staying the weekend

417
00:21:07,376 --> 00:21:08,576
Or we can come
see you in Chicago.

418
00:21:08,644 --> 00:21:09,777
I've got it.
I've got it, Pete.

419
00:21:12,781 --> 00:21:14,782
How about...

420
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:16,951
"life is just a bowl
of life cereal"?

421
00:21:19,922 --> 00:21:21,356
"life is sweet."

422
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:24,859
Uh...

423
00:21:24,927 --> 00:21:27,295
"enjoy the rest
of your life... Cereal"

424
00:21:27,363 --> 00:21:29,664
Don, they're not expecting
you to do this right now.

425
00:21:29,732 --> 00:21:31,699
Give me a second.

426
00:21:31,767 --> 00:21:34,402
"life. The reason to get
out of bed in the morning."

427
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:37,172
"life. The cure
for the common breakfast."

428
00:21:37,239 --> 00:21:39,607
<i>"life. It's sweetness
never ends."</i>

429
00:21:39,675 --> 00:21:42,777
- "life. Eat it
by the bowlful."
- oh oh. There you go.

430
00:21:42,845 --> 00:21:45,914
"the cure
for the common breakfast."

431
00:21:45,981 --> 00:21:48,883
- Love it.
- It's got
the health angle.

432
00:21:48,951 --> 00:21:50,885
Life makes you feel better.

433
00:21:50,953 --> 00:21:53,588
It's got protein.
Very nice.

434
00:21:53,656 --> 00:21:56,858
- That dog will hunt.
- Wonderful.

435
00:21:56,926 --> 00:21:59,694
- We'll get that
put together for you.
- Should we discuss media?

436
00:21:59,762 --> 00:22:02,497
<i>- I can keep going.
I think we've
got a home run.</i>

437
00:22:02,565 --> 00:22:05,934
We don't need to take up
any more of your time.

438
00:22:06,001 --> 00:22:08,403
I know you have
some celebrating to do.

439
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:11,873
I don't know what to say.
This is the most fun I've
ever had in New York.

440
00:22:11,941 --> 00:22:16,311
<i>- Anytime, fellas.
Very good then.</i>

441
00:22:16,378 --> 00:22:19,480
<i>- Roger, I'm done!</i>

442
00:22:19,548 --> 00:22:21,783
- Let's go!
- Can I speak
with you a moment?

443
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:24,786
- Got anything on Vicks yet?
- I really need to talk to you.

444
00:22:24,853 --> 00:22:27,222
- You still have nothing?
- The tagline...

445
00:22:27,289 --> 00:22:28,890
Do you think
I'm joking when
I give you a deadline?

446
00:22:28,958 --> 00:22:31,292
- You said Monday.
- Ida, book a nice room
with a lock on it

447
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,262
For misters Olsen and Rizzo.
Bill it to Vicks.

448
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:36,164
- Don't come out until
you have something.
- Are you kidding?

449
00:22:37,566 --> 00:22:39,767
Pete, we'll walk 'em out.

450
00:22:43,138 --> 00:22:45,873
Do you want to pick
a place or should I?

451
00:22:45,941 --> 00:22:48,576
He wasn't serious.
It's the weekend.
We'll work in the office.

452
00:22:48,644 --> 00:22:51,546
Do you want me to go
Chase him down to see
if he's serious or not?

453
00:22:51,614 --> 00:22:53,548
Go get Stanley.

454
00:22:58,821 --> 00:23:01,089
- I need to speak
with you.
- Not now.

455
00:23:01,156 --> 00:23:03,224
- Lane, may I?
- Come in.

456
00:23:10,566 --> 00:23:12,000
Are we merging with guyer?

457
00:23:12,067 --> 00:23:14,369
- No.
- Really?

458
00:23:14,436 --> 00:23:18,106
Well, I ran into Ken cosgrove
and Clarence Birdseye
at the Clios.

459
00:23:22,678 --> 00:23:26,281
It came to me that
Mr. Cosgrove was unhappy

460
00:23:26,348 --> 00:23:29,484
And that he
and his choice clients

461
00:23:29,551 --> 00:23:31,886
Would be a welcome
addition to the firm.

462
00:23:31,954 --> 00:23:33,221
Over my dead body.

463
00:23:38,827 --> 00:23:42,196
I apologize.
It was wrong of me
not to consult you.

464
00:23:42,264 --> 00:23:44,666
- I wasn't sure...
- wasn't sure about what?

465
00:23:44,733 --> 00:23:46,768
Whether to go behind my back?

466
00:23:46,835 --> 00:23:50,004
I'm a partner, damn it.
I have the same status
here as you.

467
00:23:51,507 --> 00:23:53,408
You've never liked me.

468
00:23:53,475 --> 00:23:55,043
You picked him
over me to begin with

469
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:56,944
And now you expect me
to work with him again?

470
00:23:57,012 --> 00:23:58,379
Approval denied.

471
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:04,519
Roger sterling is a child,

472
00:24:04,586 --> 00:24:06,554
And frankly

473
00:24:06,622 --> 00:24:09,290
We can't have you pulling
the cart all by yourself.

474
00:24:12,428 --> 00:24:14,495
Ken is proven,

475
00:24:14,563 --> 00:24:17,031
He's hungry

476
00:24:17,099 --> 00:24:19,200
And he has accounts.

477
00:24:19,268 --> 00:24:22,603
Birds-eye, a beverage
called mountain dew

478
00:24:22,671 --> 00:24:23,971
And Fillmore auto parts,

479
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:25,707
Which has entered
the national arena.

480
00:24:25,774 --> 00:24:29,177
He would more
than pay for himself.

481
00:24:29,244 --> 00:24:30,945
Does that put you at ease?

482
00:24:31,013 --> 00:24:32,880
What would put me at ease

483
00:24:32,948 --> 00:24:35,516
Is you and madame Defarge
not plotting behind my back.

484
00:24:36,719 --> 00:24:39,053
Still, I expect
pragmatism from you.

485
00:24:40,789 --> 00:24:42,323
We share that.

486
00:24:43,859 --> 00:24:46,461
Mr. Cosgrove and I are
having lunch on Monday.

487
00:24:46,528 --> 00:24:49,597
If your tantrum has subsided,

488
00:24:49,665 --> 00:24:52,100
You're welcome to join us.

489
00:24:54,203 --> 00:24:56,304
- I'm going home.
- And on a personal note,

490
00:24:56,372 --> 00:24:58,840
I'd like to add
that I'm quite fond of you.

491
00:24:58,907 --> 00:25:01,409
It pains me to hear
you say otherwise.

492
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:09,050
- Get that thing in here.
- Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.

493
00:25:12,955 --> 00:25:14,288
Mmm! General.

494
00:25:15,591 --> 00:25:17,658
You're not
flying tonight, are you?

495
00:25:17,726 --> 00:25:19,327
No, it's been years.

496
00:25:19,395 --> 00:25:22,230
Ah. I bet.
Name some aircraft for me.

497
00:25:22,297 --> 00:25:24,999
- No.
- No, wait.
Who do you report to?

498
00:25:25,067 --> 00:25:28,102
- The president.
- Of what, William Morris?

499
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:30,772
You know,
one of these decorations

500
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:33,107
Is for shutting up loudmouths.

501
00:25:33,175 --> 00:25:35,309
It's a pleasure
to meet you, general.
Enjoy your evening.

502
00:25:40,082 --> 00:25:42,917
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

503
00:25:42,985 --> 00:25:45,586
- You too.
- We're the top
of the heap, huh?

504
00:25:45,654 --> 00:25:49,123
- The heap of what?
- I know they give out
50 a year,

505
00:25:49,191 --> 00:25:51,426
But I've gotta
say it doesn't get
any sweeter than this.

506
00:25:52,928 --> 00:25:54,829
Roger, buy Ned a drink.

507
00:25:57,466 --> 00:25:59,534
There you are.

508
00:25:59,601 --> 00:26:02,370
Your mom called.
She's looking for us.

509
00:26:02,438 --> 00:26:05,306
It was very nice meeting you.

510
00:26:05,374 --> 00:26:07,308
- What are you doing?
- Rescuing you.

511
00:26:07,376 --> 00:26:10,611
From what,
a business opportunity?

512
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:13,114
Did you see the part
where I won?

513
00:26:13,182 --> 00:26:15,550
No, but I heard about it.

514
00:26:15,617 --> 00:26:18,786
They're gonna
put your picture
on a dartboard at Grey.

515
00:26:18,854 --> 00:26:21,088
What is your problem?

516
00:26:21,156 --> 00:26:22,824
Grey won.
Everybody won.

517
00:26:22,891 --> 00:26:24,859
That's not true.

518
00:26:24,927 --> 00:26:27,261
Just think how you'd feel
right now if you lost.

519
00:26:27,329 --> 00:26:29,831
About the same, I suppose.

520
00:26:29,898 --> 00:26:31,766
It doesn't make
the work any better.

521
00:26:31,834 --> 00:26:34,669
That's very healthy.

522
00:26:34,736 --> 00:26:38,239
Award or no award,
you're still don draper.

523
00:26:38,307 --> 00:26:40,074
Whatever that means.

524
00:26:40,142 --> 00:26:43,277
you're incredible.

525
00:26:48,884 --> 00:26:50,451
You smell good.

526
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:52,286
- Is that right?
- Uh-huh.

527
00:26:55,724 --> 00:26:57,592
What do you say
we get out of here

528
00:26:57,659 --> 00:26:59,994
And really celebrate?

529
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:06,467
I think you're
confusing a lot of things
at once right now.

530
00:27:12,441 --> 00:27:14,542
I'm very happy for you.

531
00:27:30,213 --> 00:27:32,314
Are you calling
to give him an update?

532
00:27:32,382 --> 00:27:34,917
I'm calling him about
something completely
unrelated to you.

533
00:27:34,985 --> 00:27:37,753
I know you have
a special relationship.

534
00:27:39,189 --> 00:27:41,657
- What does that mean?
- What?

535
00:27:41,725 --> 00:27:44,760
Not that. Jesus.
Of course not that.

536
00:27:44,828 --> 00:27:46,362
Do you think he'd be
caught dead with you?

537
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:47,863
<i>There's wallpaper
more exciting.</i>

538
00:27:47,931 --> 00:27:49,999
But I know you're his favorite.

539
00:27:50,067 --> 00:27:52,134
I bet he takes you hunting

540
00:27:52,202 --> 00:27:54,036
And lets you
carry the carcasses
in your mouth.

541
00:27:56,306 --> 00:27:57,873
Are you gonna work
or just stare at pictures

542
00:27:57,941 --> 00:27:59,341
Of women who can't stare back?

543
00:28:00,811 --> 00:28:02,711
You wouldn't understand,

544
00:28:02,779 --> 00:28:06,015
But this inspires me,

545
00:28:06,083 --> 00:28:09,018
Opens my mind with freedom.

546
00:28:10,253 --> 00:28:12,421
So why aren't you a nudist?

547
00:28:12,489 --> 00:28:15,224
You talk about it all the time.

548
00:28:15,292 --> 00:28:18,494
Well, in a liberated
environment, I would be.

549
00:28:18,562 --> 00:28:20,930
In the presence of the pope

550
00:28:20,997 --> 00:28:22,998
Or say, you,

551
00:28:24,301 --> 00:28:26,535
It's difficult.

552
00:28:26,603 --> 00:28:28,537
You don't know
anything about me.

553
00:28:28,605 --> 00:28:31,407
I know you're ashamed
of your body

554
00:28:31,475 --> 00:28:32,808
Or you should be at least.

555
00:28:46,123 --> 00:28:49,058
- What are you doing?
- You're lazy.

556
00:28:49,126 --> 00:28:50,993
And you have no ideas.

557
00:28:53,597 --> 00:28:57,299
- Really?
- Yeah. Let's go.

558
00:28:59,736 --> 00:29:01,203
You're a fruitcake,
you know that?

559
00:29:01,271 --> 00:29:03,305
And you're chickenshit.

560
00:29:03,373 --> 00:29:05,374
I can work like this.
Let's get liberated.

561
00:29:07,511 --> 00:29:08,711
Fantastic.

562
00:29:40,043 --> 00:29:41,277
What are you waiting for?

563
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,046
Just...

564
00:29:48,952 --> 00:29:51,720
Let's talk cough drops.
Whatcha got?

565
00:29:51,788 --> 00:29:54,356
I'm thinking.

566
00:29:54,424 --> 00:29:56,158
About what?

567
00:29:56,226 --> 00:29:58,894
Don't flatter yourself.
It's involuntary.

568
00:29:58,962 --> 00:30:02,631
Maybe it was left over
from the magazine.

569
00:30:02,699 --> 00:30:05,367
terrific.

570
00:30:05,435 --> 00:30:07,903
Now I don't think
it's that hard to
convince people

571
00:30:07,971 --> 00:30:10,673
<i>That cough drops are
medicine, especially when
they taste like it, right?</i>

572
00:30:23,253 --> 00:30:26,222
So you're really
gonna leave me alone whith
all these naked gold women?

573
00:30:26,289 --> 00:30:29,158
Excuse me.
I hate to interrupt.

574
00:30:29,226 --> 00:30:31,727
- You're not interrupting.
- That man over there...

575
00:30:31,795 --> 00:30:34,129
I saw you talking before.

576
00:30:34,197 --> 00:30:36,899
- Is that don draper?
- Yes it is.

577
00:30:36,967 --> 00:30:40,169
- Is he attached?
- To that glass?
Absolutely.

578
00:30:40,237 --> 00:30:42,271
No.

579
00:30:46,843 --> 00:30:49,178
He's pretty proud of himself.

580
00:30:49,246 --> 00:30:51,347
Well, it's a big day for him.

581
00:30:51,414 --> 00:30:52,948
It's a big day for all of us.

582
00:30:53,016 --> 00:30:56,518
Especially you, okay?

583
00:30:56,586 --> 00:31:00,022
Well, they don't
seem to give awards
for what I do.

584
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:02,057
And what is that?

585
00:31:03,727 --> 00:31:05,461
Find guys like him.

586
00:31:09,566 --> 00:31:12,468
You've crossed the border
from lubricated to morose.

587
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:15,471
Good night.

588
00:31:27,717 --> 00:31:29,084
<i>Mr. Sterling.</i>

589
00:31:32,355 --> 00:31:34,623
- Do I know you?
- It's don.

590
00:31:34,691 --> 00:31:38,093
Don draper.
Heller's luxury furs.

591
00:31:38,161 --> 00:31:39,962
Oh, the fur guy.

592
00:31:42,165 --> 00:31:43,866
- What are you doing here?
- I have a meeting
in the building.

593
00:31:43,933 --> 00:31:45,668
I saw you standing here
and I thought I'd say hello.

594
00:31:47,837 --> 00:31:50,039
Really? Name one other
company in this building.

595
00:31:52,942 --> 00:31:55,210
I'm sorry.
It's just...

596
00:31:55,278 --> 00:31:57,880
I've left
some messages for you.

597
00:31:57,947 --> 00:32:00,783
And I've ignored them.
That's my message for you.

598
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:03,052
I just wanted to know
what you thought
of my portfolio.

599
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:05,721
I threw it out
with the box from the coat.

600
00:32:05,789 --> 00:32:07,189
That was a bad idea.

601
00:32:09,292 --> 00:32:10,826
Maybe it was a bad idea,

602
00:32:10,894 --> 00:32:13,729
But weren't you trying
to get a break once?

603
00:32:18,868 --> 00:32:20,602
Where does your boss
think you are right now?

604
00:32:23,206 --> 00:32:24,840
He knows I want
to do what you do.

605
00:32:24,908 --> 00:32:26,775
And what do you think that is?

606
00:32:26,843 --> 00:32:30,279
I think you're
a very important man in
a very important agency.

607
00:32:30,347 --> 00:32:32,915
Maybe I am risking my job,

608
00:32:32,982 --> 00:32:35,684
But I'd do anything
to buy you a drink

609
00:32:35,752 --> 00:32:36,919
And hear anything
you have to say.

610
00:32:38,355 --> 00:32:39,788
It's 10:00 A.M.

611
00:32:39,856 --> 00:32:42,091
My mother always said

612
00:32:42,158 --> 00:32:44,393
"be careful
what you wish for,
because you'll get it.

613
00:32:44,461 --> 00:32:47,062
And then people'll
get jealous and try
to take it away from you."

614
00:32:48,431 --> 00:32:50,099
I don't think
that's how that goes.

615
00:32:50,166 --> 00:32:52,701
You're an expert
on everything, right?

616
00:32:52,769 --> 00:32:55,371
And how can I hire you?
You know too much about me.

617
00:32:55,438 --> 00:32:57,239
You know I've been discreet.

618
00:32:57,307 --> 00:32:59,908
Once you say that,
you're not discreet anymore.

619
00:32:59,976 --> 00:33:02,811
I gotta get out of here
before they open for lunch.
This is embarrassing.

620
00:33:04,114 --> 00:33:05,748
I'll buy you lunch.

621
00:33:05,815 --> 00:33:07,916
I'm stuffed.
I had a jar of olives.

622
00:33:09,085 --> 00:33:12,020
oh.

623
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:15,391
And you're a great fur guy.

624
00:33:15,458 --> 00:33:16,792
I'm gonna need one of those.

625
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:19,361
Let me get you a cab.

626
00:33:19,429 --> 00:33:21,563
You should go home.

627
00:33:22,832 --> 00:33:25,067
<i>Garcon!
Je m'appelle Roger!</i>

628
00:33:25,135 --> 00:33:26,702
<i>Je suis UN taxi,
Si vous plait!</i>

629
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:37,179
So you use cough drops
when you're sick in bed,

630
00:33:37,247 --> 00:33:39,481
On a car trip, at the movies

631
00:33:39,549 --> 00:33:41,383
And in church.

632
00:33:42,819 --> 00:33:43,986
Anything you'd like to add?

633
00:33:45,488 --> 00:33:48,123
- What?
- This pencil's
a little dull.

634
00:33:50,059 --> 00:33:52,628
Maybe I should dip
that thing in some ink
and write with it.

635
00:33:52,695 --> 00:33:55,964
- Stop looking.
- I thought it might
make it go away.

636
00:34:09,212 --> 00:34:11,613
You know what? Fine.

637
00:34:13,817 --> 00:34:15,884
Are we getting dressed now?

638
00:34:15,952 --> 00:34:17,920
You can do whatever you want.

639
00:34:17,987 --> 00:34:21,123
- I don't care.
- But you do.

640
00:34:21,191 --> 00:34:24,426
- Fine, you win.
- Win what?

641
00:34:24,494 --> 00:34:28,130
Win the prize
for the smuggest
balls in the world.

642
00:34:28,198 --> 00:34:29,865
I need to take a leak.

643
00:34:41,744 --> 00:34:44,680
<i>- hey, Rizzo!</i>

644
00:34:44,747 --> 00:34:46,982
I'm hungry.
Do you want anything?

645
00:34:58,788 --> 00:35:00,155
What did you win for again?

646
00:35:01,857 --> 00:35:03,858
Cake mixes and toppings.

647
00:35:03,926 --> 00:35:06,127
I wrote the jingle.

648
00:35:06,195 --> 00:35:08,863
Oh. Can you hum
a few bars?

649
00:35:25,948 --> 00:35:27,749
That sounds familiar.

650
00:35:31,053 --> 00:35:33,888
Oh. Okay.

651
00:35:55,477 --> 00:35:58,680
hello.

652
00:35:58,747 --> 00:36:00,748
<i>So you finally decided
to pick up the phone?</i>

653
00:36:00,816 --> 00:36:03,084
<i>- Where the hell are you?
- Who is this?</i>

654
00:36:03,152 --> 00:36:06,087
It's me. Where the hell
are you? It's noon.

655
00:36:06,155 --> 00:36:09,157
<i>You were supposed
to be here two hours ago.</i>

656
00:36:09,225 --> 00:36:11,226
The kids are sitting
in the den watching TV,

657
00:36:11,293 --> 00:36:13,428
Waiting for someone who
is obviously not coming.

658
00:36:13,495 --> 00:36:15,363
I know you don't care
that Henry and I were
supposed to go

659
00:36:15,431 --> 00:36:17,365
<i>To a very important brunch,</i>

660
00:36:17,433 --> 00:36:19,234
<i>But I can't
get Carla anymore.
She's in church.</i>

661
00:36:19,301 --> 00:36:22,070
- I'm coming on Sunday.
- It is Sunday!

662
00:36:27,409 --> 00:36:30,712
I'm really sorry, Betts.
I'm under the weather.

663
00:36:30,779 --> 00:36:32,747
Well, thank you
for the notice, don.
Thanks a lot.

664
00:36:35,684 --> 00:36:37,518
Is everything okay?

665
00:36:38,954 --> 00:36:41,022
Yeah.

666
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:42,924
Everything's fine.

667
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:44,759
ah.

668
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:47,295
I can't believe
we slept so long.

669
00:36:47,363 --> 00:36:50,298
Mmm. Mmm.

670
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,401
Is that yours?

671
00:36:54,603 --> 00:36:56,537
No, it's yours.

672
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:03,945
I'm...

673
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:05,980
Really sorry.

674
00:37:06,048 --> 00:37:09,784
I have some things to do.
I forgot about them.

675
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:12,387
You said you were
gonna take my picture
and you never did.

676
00:37:13,956 --> 00:37:17,191
- When did I say that?
- I don't know.

677
00:37:17,259 --> 00:37:20,328
Somewhere around
your third order
of French fries

678
00:37:20,396 --> 00:37:21,863
After your sister left.

679
00:37:21,931 --> 00:37:23,564
My sister?

680
00:37:25,301 --> 00:37:27,402
Was that her on the phone?

681
00:37:27,469 --> 00:37:30,204
- No.
- Don't lie to me.
It's okay, Dick.

682
00:37:32,207 --> 00:37:34,542
Listen, I don't want to get
in the middle of anything.

683
00:37:40,749 --> 00:37:42,583
Look,

684
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:46,154
I'm really late.

685
00:37:46,221 --> 00:37:49,457
- I should get ready.
- Oh, okay.

686
00:37:51,126 --> 00:37:53,094
Uh, do you mind?

687
00:37:59,868 --> 00:38:01,669
I had a great time, Doris.

688
00:38:03,472 --> 00:38:05,673
I'm really sorry
I forgot I had plans.

689
00:38:27,896 --> 00:38:29,430
<i>All right.</i>

690
00:38:29,498 --> 00:38:31,332
<i>I'll see you around,
I guess.</i>

691
00:39:22,317 --> 00:39:24,352
Are you okay?

692
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:26,654
I tried to call you
Friday night,

693
00:39:26,722 --> 00:39:29,123
Yesterday it rang and rang
and today it's busy.

694
00:39:29,191 --> 00:39:31,092
My phone's not working.

695
00:39:32,261 --> 00:39:33,561
Can I come in?

696
00:39:41,403 --> 00:39:43,304
What's the problem?

697
00:39:43,372 --> 00:39:45,573
Uh...

698
00:39:45,641 --> 00:39:47,308
I know you don't want
to hear this,

699
00:39:47,376 --> 00:39:50,111
But the life cereal tag
you sold,

700
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:52,447
It was that kid's...
Roger's idiot.

701
00:39:55,551 --> 00:39:58,486
"eat life by the bowlful"?
We worked on that for weeks.

702
00:39:58,554 --> 00:40:01,422
No, "the cure for
the common breakfast."

703
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:02,690
You changed it in the meeting.

704
00:40:02,758 --> 00:40:05,159
I don't think so.

705
00:40:05,227 --> 00:40:07,728
I know I've gotten stuff
stuck in my brain before

706
00:40:07,796 --> 00:40:09,697
And you don't know where
it's coming from.

707
00:40:09,765 --> 00:40:11,666
It's that kid's.

708
00:40:11,733 --> 00:40:13,534
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

709
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:17,872
Call life and tell them
it's terrible

710
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:19,841
- And we changed our minds.
- They loved it.

711
00:40:19,908 --> 00:40:22,510
- It's terrible.
- Well, neither you
nor the client was

712
00:40:22,578 --> 00:40:24,278
In a condition to notice.

713
00:40:27,082 --> 00:40:29,083
Think of 10 more tags.

714
00:40:29,151 --> 00:40:32,153
No. I've been working
all weekend with that pig

715
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:34,455
In that stupid hotel room.
I am tapped out.

716
00:40:34,523 --> 00:40:37,091
What hotel room?

717
00:40:40,162 --> 00:40:43,131
You have to bring
him in right away.

718
00:40:43,198 --> 00:40:45,766
Tomorrow. Fix it.

719
00:40:49,438 --> 00:40:50,805
Shit.

720
00:41:06,897 --> 00:41:09,499
Mr. Cosgrove is
on his way over.

721
00:41:09,567 --> 00:41:11,000
I've added you
to our reservation.

722
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:12,569
No.
When he gets here

723
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:14,070
Bring him
to the conference room.

724
00:41:20,277 --> 00:41:22,879
And he's coughing and
everyone's staring at him,

725
00:41:22,947 --> 00:41:25,481
Including the priest,
then he sucks on a Vicks.

726
00:41:25,549 --> 00:41:27,517
- It's good.
- Mmm.

727
00:41:27,585 --> 00:41:30,086
- It's pretty much
how I pitched it.
- That's true.

728
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:31,855
I only changed
one little thing.

729
00:41:39,964 --> 00:41:42,799
- Good morning.
- Call the pen & pencil,

730
00:41:42,867 --> 00:41:44,634
See if someone found my award.

731
00:41:44,702 --> 00:41:46,769
What's the category?

732
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:50,006
Best actress.
It's a Clio.

733
00:41:56,747 --> 00:42:00,817
<i>- Hey. They told
me to wait here.

734
00:42:00,885 --> 00:42:02,585
<i>Your little friend
is waiting.</i>

735
00:42:07,157 --> 00:42:08,458
Listen, Danny,

736
00:42:10,794 --> 00:42:13,529
I've been thinking
about things and there was
a slogan in your book...

737
00:42:13,597 --> 00:42:16,799
"the cure for
the common" something.

738
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:18,601
Bus, beer, chair?
Which one?

739
00:42:18,669 --> 00:42:20,336
All of them.

740
00:42:20,404 --> 00:42:22,071
I'm gonna give you
$50 for the idea.

741
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:24,307
You liked it, huh?

742
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:25,975
What did I just say?

743
00:42:27,244 --> 00:42:28,778
I'd like a job.

744
00:42:31,615 --> 00:42:34,550
Fine, $100.
It'll be freelance work.
Do you know what that is?

745
00:42:34,618 --> 00:42:36,819
Yeah, it's not a job.

746
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:39,289
I don't have to buy it.

747
00:42:39,356 --> 00:42:42,258
I could just use it.
Take the money.

748
00:42:42,326 --> 00:42:45,461
I don't need money.
I need a job.

749
00:42:45,529 --> 00:42:48,331
You wouldn't even
be in this room if you
weren't related to Roger.

750
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,366
But I am.
It's all I have...

751
00:42:50,434 --> 00:42:53,603
That and my ideas.

752
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:07,517
This place is fantastic.

753
00:43:07,584 --> 00:43:10,253
Lane, could you
leave us please?

754
00:43:12,356 --> 00:43:13,756
Certainly.

755
00:43:29,707 --> 00:43:31,741
I've given this
a lot of thought.

756
00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:33,609
Me too.

757
00:43:33,677 --> 00:43:36,212
If you're open to the direction

758
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,314
And tenor of the business
I'm doing here,

759
00:43:38,382 --> 00:43:41,484
I think you'd be
a great addition
to my team.

760
00:43:41,552 --> 00:43:43,319
How's that supposed to mean?

761
00:43:43,387 --> 00:43:46,756
That things have changed
in a permanent way.

762
00:43:48,492 --> 00:43:50,293
I'd say nothing's changed.

763
00:43:52,429 --> 00:43:54,097
Look, Ken,

764
00:43:54,164 --> 00:43:56,199
Everyone here likes you,

765
00:43:56,266 --> 00:43:58,601
But this is a small shop

766
00:43:58,669 --> 00:44:00,603
And I need to know
you can do as told.

767
00:44:18,255 --> 00:44:19,989
So...

768
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:23,626
How are
the wedding plans coming?

769
00:44:25,629 --> 00:44:26,796
Peggy!

770
00:44:31,268 --> 00:44:33,169
Take Danny over to Joan.
He's starting next Monday.

771
00:44:33,237 --> 00:44:34,804
Are you kidding?

772
00:44:36,106 --> 00:44:38,708
You will not be sorry.

773
00:44:38,776 --> 00:44:40,109
Go away.

774
00:44:47,785 --> 00:44:49,652
Wait here.

775
00:44:57,628 --> 00:45:01,531
I always liked chocolate
ice cream, but my mother
made us eat vanilla

776
00:45:01,598 --> 00:45:02,999
- Because it didn't
stain anything.

777
00:45:05,836 --> 00:45:08,671
- I hired Jane's cousin.
- Really?

778
00:45:08,739 --> 00:45:10,406
What changed your mind?

779
00:45:11,708 --> 00:45:12,942
Couldn't live without him.

780
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:15,912
Well...

781
00:45:17,481 --> 00:45:19,382
One good turn deserves another.

782
00:45:24,188 --> 00:45:26,389
You left it at the bar.

783
00:45:26,457 --> 00:45:28,691
Too much celebrating, I guess.

784
00:45:28,759 --> 00:45:30,993
Yeah, that happens.

785
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:33,830
I'll give it back

786
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:36,466
You couldn't have
done it without me.

787
00:45:36,533 --> 00:45:37,967
Did I not say that?

788
00:45:40,037 --> 00:45:41,537
I was wrong.

789
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:48,377
Thank you.

790
00:46:02,226 --> 00:46:03,960
<i>Mr. Sterling.</i>

791
00:46:04,027 --> 00:46:06,996
- Good morning.
- Jesus. Would you
leave me alone?

792
00:46:07,064 --> 00:46:08,998
You told me to come in.

793
00:46:10,534 --> 00:46:13,035
- The hell I did.
- You hired me.

794
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:15,404
What? When?

795
00:46:15,472 --> 00:46:18,674
Yesterday. You said,
"welcome aboard."
