2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:08,434
What's happening to me?

3
00:00:08,945 --> 00:00:10,047
Do I need to see someone?

4
00:00:11,211 --> 00:00:12,211
I don't know.

5
00:00:12,508 --> 00:00:14,385
Do you have any idea how unhappy
I was before I met you?

6
00:00:14,867 --> 00:00:16,582
I was thinking of leaving my wife.

7
00:00:16,887 --> 00:00:17,971
Was he a good kisser?

8
00:00:18,231 --> 00:00:20,465
Let's just say he had
more practice than I did.

9
00:00:20,994 --> 00:00:22,559
You don't want me
to have what I want?

10
00:00:22,916 --> 00:00:24,751
Why would you put me
in that position?

11
00:00:25,421 --> 00:00:28,115
Your hair is so beautiful,
you look like a princess.

12
00:00:29,864 --> 00:00:31,318
Well, I don't know about that.

13
00:00:31,764 --> 00:00:33,419
Can I have some of your hair?

Season 1 Episode 7
<i>Red in the Face</i>

15
00:01:14,464 --> 00:01:17,939
I know you said to call at night
but I haven't been alone.

16
00:01:19,106 --> 00:01:20,106
<i>I understand.</i>

17
00:01:20,657 --> 00:01:21,866
<i>I have a moment.</i>

18
00:01:23,293 --> 00:01:24,383
So how is she?

19
00:01:25,132 --> 00:01:27,419
It's only been a short period
in therapeutic time.

22
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:28,876
<i>But she's making progress?</i>

23
00:01:29,732 --> 00:01:31,874
She's not particularly
forthcoming yet.

24
00:01:32,419 --> 00:01:34,256
Well, what has she been
talking about?

25
00:01:34,516 --> 00:01:37,300
Mostly she seems consumed
with petty jealousy's

26
00:01:37,547 --> 00:01:39,770
and overwhelmed with
everyday activity's.

27
00:01:40,169 --> 00:01:42,765
Basically we're dealing with
the emotions of a child here.

28
00:01:44,733 --> 00:01:46,236
She wasn't always like this.

29
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:47,478
<i>Well, we're finding that</i>

30
00:01:47,738 --> 00:01:50,272
this kind of anxiety is not
uncommon in housewives.

31
00:01:50,606 --> 00:01:53,810
<i>And let's not forget the death of a
parent is extremely destabilizing.</i>

32
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:56,323
So that's it.

33
00:01:56,546 --> 00:01:58,201
<i>No that's the beginning certainly.</i>

34
00:01:58,412 --> 00:02:00,702
As she becomes more forthcoming,
we may be able to shed

35
00:02:00,949 --> 00:02:03,285
some light on the deeper issues
as she talks more.

36
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:05,844
- There are deeper issues?
- <i>Usually.</i>

37
00:02:06,506 --> 00:02:09,153
These are not groundbreaking
revelations mr. Draper.

38
00:02:10,366 --> 00:02:11,752
I'm concerned obviously.

39
00:02:13,046 --> 00:02:14,413
Of course, we both are.

40
00:02:14,671 --> 00:02:17,134
Time and talk, that's what
I recommend right now.

41
00:02:17,485 --> 00:02:19,147
And again, evenings are
<i>better for me.</i>

42
00:02:19,484 --> 00:02:21,259
Well I appreciate your time.

43
00:02:26,922 --> 00:02:29,265
Mona I am drinking
my milk right now.

44
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,576
Go to Mims.

45
00:02:33,982 --> 00:02:35,410
Bring the heiress.

46
00:02:36,423 --> 00:02:39,317
The mount claire air might wipe
the scowl off her face.

47
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:44,451
Call me from there.

48
00:02:45,423 --> 00:02:47,423
I'll try to make it out
by sunday afternoon.

49
00:02:48,713 --> 00:02:50,968
I just got off the phone with U.F.C.

50
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,024
And they're having the Nixon boys

51
00:02:53,227 --> 00:02:54,878
stop by at the end of the week.

52
00:02:55,231 --> 00:02:56,755
- With Nixon?
- No, thank God

53
00:02:57,015 --> 00:02:59,715
otherwise I'd have to move
the piano out of my office.

54
00:03:02,987 --> 00:03:03,804
Hopefully

55
00:03:04,373 --> 00:03:06,193
he'll decide he needs us.

56
00:03:07,025 --> 00:03:09,393
The ones with the best product
make the worst client.

57
00:03:09,653 --> 00:03:11,468
Stop smoking so much!

58
00:03:11,973 --> 00:03:13,147
It's a sign of weakness!

59
00:03:14,741 --> 00:03:17,735
Do you know how Hitler got Chamberlain
to give him everything at Munich?

60
00:03:18,616 --> 00:03:21,488
He held a conference at
an old palace

61
00:03:21,748 --> 00:03:22,890
that forbids smoking.

62
00:03:23,173 --> 00:03:25,746
And after an hour and a half
of not smoking,

63
00:03:26,255 --> 00:03:29,508
Neville Chamberlain would've
given Hitler his mother

64
00:03:30,037 --> 00:03:31,040
as a dance partner.

65
00:03:31,453 --> 00:03:34,646
All I can get from this story is
that Hitler didn't smoke...

66
00:03:35,171 --> 00:03:36,171
And I do.

67
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:39,942
Goodnight peanut.

68
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:55,939
Last one to Chung Lee's gets
to wheel Kenneth Cosgrove,

69
00:03:56,221 --> 00:03:58,651
published author, home
in a baby carriage.

70
00:03:59,421 --> 00:04:00,590
Hardy-har-har.

71
00:04:18,568 --> 00:04:19,568
Hello there.

72
00:04:19,882 --> 00:04:20,882
Good news...

73
00:04:21,164 --> 00:04:23,459
Mona and Margaret are going out
of town for the weekend,

74
00:04:23,694 --> 00:04:25,260
Mona's mother feel down the steps.

75
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,670
You're really blessed.

76
00:04:27,004 --> 00:04:28,009
Come on over.

77
00:04:28,261 --> 00:04:30,856
I'll put on whites, we'll pretend
it's V.J. Day.

78
00:04:33,443 --> 00:04:35,110
What goes in there, an aspirin?

79
00:04:35,383 --> 00:04:38,081
I suppose I could've taken
this suitcase anywhere this weekend

80
00:04:38,315 --> 00:04:39,982
and I don't mean your apartment.

81
00:04:40,256 --> 00:04:43,081
I got us a couple of sandwiches and
filled the thermos for the train.

82
00:04:43,345 --> 00:04:45,705
Mr. Sterling this is Carol,
my roommate.

83
00:04:46,514 --> 00:04:48,028
Nice to meet you, Carol.

84
00:04:49,133 --> 00:04:51,706
Miss Halloway I have
an accounting question.

85
00:04:56,197 --> 00:04:57,672
We will go away...

86
00:04:58,013 --> 00:05:00,479
Not tonight, some weekend
coming up...

87
00:05:00,885 --> 00:05:01,885
Puerto Rico.

88
00:05:02,821 --> 00:05:05,460
I don't care if it's Cuba,
I need a little notice.

89
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:07,334
You've got a lot of rules red.

90
00:05:11,446 --> 00:05:12,780
Be good girls.

91
00:05:15,552 --> 00:05:17,372
I don't mind you staying late just
as long as you're not trying

92
00:05:17,466 --> 00:05:18,546
to milk us for the dinner money.

93
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,680
It's work.

94
00:05:19,994 --> 00:05:22,153
Just cause tomorrow's friday
doesn't mean I expect to be pulling

95
00:05:22,286 --> 00:05:23,819
your head off the keys in the morning.

96
00:05:24,731 --> 00:05:25,863
What are you doing tonight?

97
00:05:26,946 --> 00:05:28,323
Working and going home.

98
00:05:28,932 --> 00:05:32,035
I'll let you enjoy that one honey
but I was talking to donald here.

99
00:05:35,621 --> 00:05:36,637
I'm on the 5:31.

100
00:05:36,813 --> 00:05:38,419
Reservations at home,
I've had those...

101
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:40,815
Easiest ones to break. Besides
they love it when you keep

102
00:05:40,885 --> 00:05:43,659
- them guessing. It adds spice.
- You trying to get me in trouble...

103
00:05:43,803 --> 00:05:44,807
Betty's cooking.

104
00:05:44,943 --> 00:05:46,717
One drink, you owe me that.

105
00:05:48,059 --> 00:05:49,240
Did I miss something?

106
00:05:49,466 --> 00:05:51,720
No, Don and I talk all the time
when you're not around.

107
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:54,719
In fact, we're gonna do it
right now. Don, shall we?

108
00:05:54,989 --> 00:05:57,487
- Well, good night boys.
- Good night, Paul.

109
00:05:57,818 --> 00:05:58,937
I love doing that.

110
00:06:03,495 --> 00:06:05,171
You seem like a busy little girl...

111
00:06:05,392 --> 00:06:07,048
Draper pushing you around enough?

112
00:06:07,307 --> 00:06:08,530
What does that mean?

113
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,325
Burning the midnight oil
is not good for your skin.

114
00:06:12,342 --> 00:06:14,138
No it's... it's for something else.

115
00:06:14,421 --> 00:06:15,621
I'm working on copy.

116
00:06:16,612 --> 00:06:17,456
On your own?

117
00:06:18,494 --> 00:06:21,377
Mr. Rumsin liked what I did in
the brainstorming thingy.

118
00:06:21,997 --> 00:06:22,997
Sanitary Napkins?

119
00:06:23,241 --> 00:06:24,333
No, lipstick.

120
00:06:24,597 --> 00:06:25,464
What I say?

121
00:06:25,724 --> 00:06:27,225
It's the Belle Jolie account.

122
00:06:29,019 --> 00:06:30,834
Your wife called from
the <i>Four Seasons</i>

123
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:32,058
they've been seated.

124
00:06:32,496 --> 00:06:33,496
Thank you Hildy.

125
00:06:35,997 --> 00:06:37,560
Want me to take a look at it?

126
00:06:37,934 --> 00:06:39,269
I do it for a lot of the fellas.

127
00:06:40,246 --> 00:06:41,246
Really?

128
00:06:41,622 --> 00:06:42,773
Yeah, really.

129
00:06:43,622 --> 00:06:44,942
That would be super.

130
00:06:45,825 --> 00:06:47,069
Well, we're all in it together.

131
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:06,063
So they fired all the guys
in the middle

132
00:07:06,623 --> 00:07:08,277
and moved up their mailroom staff

133
00:07:08,558 --> 00:07:10,979
right before all the salaries
got expensive.

134
00:07:11,246 --> 00:07:12,246
Smart.

135
00:07:12,684 --> 00:07:14,576
Is that what we're gonna do?

136
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:17,961
We're not gonna do anything.

137
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,264
At a certain age they lose that.

138
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:28,370
What?

139
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:31,314
That glow of pure youth.

140
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,075
It's like they hit 30 and
somebody puts out a light.

141
00:07:38,948 --> 00:07:41,165
I don't think those two have
30 years between them.

142
00:07:41,426 --> 00:07:43,808
Hope it does-it looks
like a lot of fun.

143
00:07:45,597 --> 00:07:47,593
Well, you'll have to let me know.

144
00:07:48,881 --> 00:07:50,478
Jesus you must be starving.

145
00:07:51,434 --> 00:07:53,128
I know I am. What's Betty making?

146
00:07:54,193 --> 00:07:55,285
I don't know.

147
00:07:57,252 --> 00:07:59,530
Mona hasn't cooked since
Margaret stopped eating.

148
00:07:59,802 --> 00:08:01,106
They're fighting it out...

149
00:08:01,372 --> 00:08:03,112
I'm the one that gets hurt.

150
00:08:07,248 --> 00:08:08,546
I'll call Betty...

151
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:10,642
Tell her we'll be three.

152
00:08:10,996 --> 00:08:11,996
No!

153
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:14,375
You sure?

154
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:15,830
Are you kidding?

155
00:08:16,308 --> 00:08:19,246
She'll be thrilled.
When's the last time she saw you?

156
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:22,822
We'll take my car, it'll save you
a train trip.

157
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:42,548
- My eyes are burning.
- That's impossible.

158
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:45,763
That better not be daddy saying
he's going to be late.

159
00:08:47,185 --> 00:08:49,040
Don't do gymnasts in the house.

160
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:53,821
<i>Draper residence.</i>

161
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:56,488
<i>You're are coming home, right?</i>

162
00:08:56,612 --> 00:08:58,068
Yes, I'm coming home...

163
00:08:59,387 --> 00:09:02,746
Unfortunately Roger has decided
he needs a home cooked meal.

164
00:09:03,805 --> 00:09:06,356
You're-you're kidding. I don't know
if I have enough food.

165
00:09:06,686 --> 00:09:08,919
Berty what do you put in
that freezer I bought you?

166
00:09:10,437 --> 00:09:11,700
Frozen food.

167
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:13,799
What do you want me to say?

168
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:29,705
Betty, this steak...

169
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:31,937
Are you sure you don't want some?

170
00:09:32,111 --> 00:09:33,531
No thank you, Roger.

171
00:09:35,061 --> 00:09:36,521
I'm a vegetarian sometimes.

172
00:09:36,744 --> 00:09:39,199
Mona has a little calorie book
she keeps on the refrigerator

173
00:09:39,459 --> 00:09:40,868
always has her nose in there.

174
00:09:42,436 --> 00:09:44,163
Maybe she wants to look good for you.

175
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:46,478
You got a nice thought.

176
00:09:47,092 --> 00:09:49,660
Well I was pudgy as a girl
if you can believe it.

177
00:09:49,999 --> 00:09:53,172
I came into Home EC in the eighth grade
with a pattern for big girls pajamas.

178
00:09:53,624 --> 00:09:56,175
The teacher asked who I was
making the pajamas for.

179
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,416
I didn't realize how much weight
I'd lost that summer...

180
00:09:59,663 --> 00:10:01,116
Swim camp I guess.

181
00:10:01,716 --> 00:10:03,807
Went from tadpole
to pollywog that year.

182
00:10:04,249 --> 00:10:05,872
Sounds like a lateral move.

183
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:08,604
When I was little in the summer
we used to swim at night,

184
00:10:08,864 --> 00:10:10,044
in a pool not the ocean.

185
00:10:10,966 --> 00:10:13,702
Warm air, light dancing in the blue.

186
00:10:14,124 --> 00:10:16,249
Night swimming... it's divine.

187
00:10:17,313 --> 00:10:18,729
Sometimes naked.

188
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:22,619
Believe me on those nights
it was very difficult to go to sleep.

189
00:10:23,251 --> 00:10:24,912
You ever experience that, Don?

190
00:10:25,172 --> 00:10:26,178
Trouble sleeping?

191
00:10:26,413 --> 00:10:27,414
Never.

192
00:10:28,235 --> 00:10:30,605
Your husbands a funny son-of-a-bitch
you know that, Betty?

193
00:10:31,751 --> 00:10:33,315
We used to swim in a quarry.

194
00:10:34,628 --> 00:10:37,174
By the way you drop your "G's"
every once in a while,

195
00:10:37,501 --> 00:10:39,370
I always thought you were
raised on a farm,

196
00:10:39,621 --> 00:10:41,762
someplace with a swimin' hole.

197
00:10:47,061 --> 00:10:49,564
What do you say we go to
a commercial break,

198
00:10:49,812 --> 00:10:51,879
brought to you by more liquor.

199
00:10:55,001 --> 00:10:56,001
You two...

200
00:11:00,976 --> 00:11:02,807
Jesus, don't tell me
it's your anniversary?

201
00:11:04,174 --> 00:11:06,416
Don't worry, Sally got
this frosting machine.

202
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:09,045
"Mommy and daddy."

203
00:11:09,374 --> 00:11:12,658
simple, to the point...
she writes like her father.

204
00:11:20,414 --> 00:11:21,760
I'll get hers, you get your own.

205
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:24,847
Three on a match.

206
00:11:26,876 --> 00:11:28,501
I never understood that.

207
00:11:29,153 --> 00:11:31,207
Is that like three on a horse?

208
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,234
Trench war... first war...

209
00:11:34,124 --> 00:11:37,735
They used to say first man
lights up they notice you.

210
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:40,195
Second man, Jerry takes aim.
Third one,

211
00:11:40,511 --> 00:11:41,533
<i>Auf wedersehen.</i>

212
00:11:41,999 --> 00:11:44,896
But the professional wisdom says that
one of our guys came up with that

213
00:11:45,131 --> 00:11:46,243
as a way to sell matches.

214
00:11:46,937 --> 00:11:48,829
Do you tell your kids there's
no Santa Claus?

215
00:11:49,089 --> 00:11:50,509
He'd never do that.

216
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:53,855
Tell us another story...

217
00:11:54,127 --> 00:11:55,544
A true one though.

218
00:11:57,438 --> 00:11:58,438
Well...

219
00:11:59,751 --> 00:12:01,770
My father was in the trenches...

220
00:12:02,441 --> 00:12:03,844
With a bayonet.

221
00:12:05,252 --> 00:12:06,644
Think about that.

222
00:12:07,751 --> 00:12:10,334
Poking a man to death
three feet away from you.

223
00:12:11,307 --> 00:12:12,436
What does that sound like?

224
00:12:14,315 --> 00:12:16,231
Don never talks about the war.

225
00:12:16,503 --> 00:12:18,525
The war? His war you mean.

226
00:12:19,691 --> 00:12:21,095
Not much to say.

227
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:23,322
You boys used up all the glory.

228
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:24,941
We did didn't we.

229
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:28,514
Of course my old man will always
have one on me... that bayonet.

230
00:12:30,612 --> 00:12:32,819
My biggest hit came when
we were running oil

231
00:12:33,104 --> 00:12:35,000
down in the islands in
the south China sea.

232
00:12:35,443 --> 00:12:37,557
The pacific was all about gasoline.

233
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:39,301
People forget that.

234
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,883
You know what, I don't like to
talk about it either.

235
00:12:46,378 --> 00:12:48,268
Dear, I'm sorry.

236
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:50,349
Not much.

237
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:52,916
Now you have to tell us.

238
00:12:55,414 --> 00:12:56,414
Well...

239
00:12:57,556 --> 00:12:59,992
The third day we picked up
a dina circling the convoy,

240
00:13:00,843 --> 00:13:03,028
a recon plane. They were mapping us

241
00:13:03,288 --> 00:13:06,050
for the nip suicide submarines
up ahead-citens,

242
00:13:06,601 --> 00:13:09,019
basically warheads with motors.

243
00:13:10,038 --> 00:13:12,367
Made us feel good to know
we had such a dedicated enemy.

244
00:13:12,689 --> 00:13:14,289
That's one way of thinking about it.

245
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:19,088
And maybe I was bored but I thought
"we should get that little plane."

246
00:13:19,321 --> 00:13:21,179
bored... what about scared?

247
00:13:21,565 --> 00:13:23,205
That never comes into these stories.

248
00:13:23,433 --> 00:13:25,358
You're making me look
bad in front of the lady.

249
00:13:25,546 --> 00:13:26,896
That's impossible.

250
00:13:27,757 --> 00:13:29,255
Finish your story.

251
00:13:30,381 --> 00:13:31,673
Well we gave it to them,

252
00:13:32,275 --> 00:13:33,916
right at 12 o'clock.

253
00:13:34,944 --> 00:13:36,630
He was going away
from us but we hit him.

254
00:13:36,853 --> 00:13:39,436
I watched him dive into the waves
just beyond the horizon.

255
00:13:39,695 --> 00:13:40,858
And it was strange because

256
00:13:41,118 --> 00:13:43,291
we knew it was over for him...

257
00:13:44,121 --> 00:13:45,979
But we didn't see or hear much.

258
00:13:46,404 --> 00:13:49,600
The next four hours I took us
off course just to swing by.

259
00:13:50,821 --> 00:13:53,221
Looking for a hole in
the ocean I guess.

260
00:13:53,634 --> 00:13:55,109
We saw the wreckage...

261
00:13:56,354 --> 00:13:57,374
No shoot, no body.

262
00:13:59,792 --> 00:14:02,587
It's incredible that something
that heavy can float.

263
00:14:05,023 --> 00:14:06,258
Isn't that something.

264
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:08,635
- But they gave you a medal.
- They did,

265
00:14:09,489 --> 00:14:11,055
but not for that,
it was for drinking.

266
00:14:13,108 --> 00:14:14,803
Can something be done
about this sadness?

267
00:14:15,553 --> 00:14:16,560
What switch to gin?

268
00:14:19,014 --> 00:14:20,105
Did you check the golf bag?

269
00:14:21,157 --> 00:14:24,008
I might have something out in
the garage left over from new years.

270
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:28,614
I don't care if it has ants in it!

271
00:14:29,632 --> 00:14:31,234
Roger please, the kids.

272
00:14:43,571 --> 00:14:45,708
Sally will be happy her cake
was such a hit.

273
00:14:46,113 --> 00:14:47,545
Make sure you tell her...

274
00:14:48,883 --> 00:14:50,498
I ate the "M" in mom.

275
00:14:52,315 --> 00:14:54,264
I can't believe you've had
two babies.

276
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:57,668
Don't do that.

277
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:00,435
You've been making eyes
at me all night.

278
00:15:01,053 --> 00:15:03,502
You can't tell me that I'm not
giving you hot pants.

279
00:15:05,267 --> 00:15:06,902
You smell so good.

280
00:15:09,244 --> 00:15:10,858
I can make more coffee.

281
00:15:11,393 --> 00:15:12,491
I just want you to know,

282
00:15:12,752 --> 00:15:15,619
that when I go to sleep tonight
I will be thinking all about you.

283
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,094
What did you go to Russia to get that?

284
00:15:33,179 --> 00:15:35,514
No I ran down the street
knockin' on doors.

285
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:47,390
Come on you two! Come on out here
and wish me a <i>bon voyage</i>!

286
00:15:50,393 --> 00:15:52,354
I was just saying what
a lucky man you are-

287
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:53,881
beautiful children.

288
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,408
Enjoy it.

289
00:15:57,163 --> 00:15:59,347
One minute you're drinking at
a bar and they come and

290
00:15:59,582 --> 00:16:03,750
tell you your kids been born. Next thing
you know they're heading off to college.

291
00:16:10,151 --> 00:16:11,643
Well I should be on my way.

292
00:16:12,631 --> 00:16:14,439
I'll take this for the road.

293
00:16:15,492 --> 00:16:16,920
I'll walk you out.

294
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,554
Magical night.

295
00:16:37,548 --> 00:16:38,682
That's my car!

296
00:16:41,494 --> 00:16:42,494
There you go.

297
00:16:45,181 --> 00:16:46,181
Lights!

298
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:02,245
What was that?

299
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:04,494
What?

300
00:17:04,681 --> 00:17:05,681
That.

301
00:17:06,088 --> 00:17:06,897
Him.

302
00:17:07,303 --> 00:17:10,489
Thought someone turned the oven on when
I came back in here with that bottle.

303
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:12,683
- That's ridiculous.
- Bullshit.

304
00:17:13,055 --> 00:17:14,694
Nothing happened Don,

305
00:17:15,066 --> 00:17:17,132
other then your drunk boss
ruining our evening.

306
00:17:17,496 --> 00:17:19,027
Can we leave it at that?

307
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:21,620
You seemed to be having
a grand time.

308
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:25,499
I liked the wine.

309
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,167
You made a fool of yourself.

310
00:17:27,556 --> 00:17:28,712
Why would you say that?

311
00:17:28,994 --> 00:17:31,540
You were throwing yourself at him...
Giggling at his stories.

312
00:17:32,056 --> 00:17:34,091
I was being friendly.
He's your boss!

313
00:17:34,355 --> 00:17:37,185
I don't like to be treated
that way in my own home.

314
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:39,805
I know what I saw.

315
00:17:42,433 --> 00:17:44,355
You want to bounce me off the walls?

316
00:17:46,869 --> 00:17:48,794
Would that make you feel better?

317
00:17:55,932 --> 00:17:58,365
Sometimes I feels like
I'm living with a little girl.

318
00:18:10,282 --> 00:18:12,046
Humps, where were you last night?

319
00:18:12,531 --> 00:18:14,844
I had a dinner with my in-laws

320
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,904
at the <i>Four Seasons</i>*, poolside.

321
00:18:18,533 --> 00:18:19,961
Sounds refreshing!

322
00:18:20,639 --> 00:18:21,430
Norman Mailer.

323
00:18:21,995 --> 00:18:22,931
Mayor Wagner.

324
00:18:23,191 --> 00:18:24,308
<i>The Naked and the Dead</i>*.

325
00:18:25,902 --> 00:18:26,810
What's in the box?

326
00:18:27,408 --> 00:18:29,354
It's a wedding present. We got two.

327
00:18:29,888 --> 00:18:30,689
But, what is it?

328
00:18:31,219 --> 00:18:32,283
It's a chip and dip.

329
00:18:32,467 --> 00:18:33,469
Let me see.

330
00:18:33,637 --> 00:18:34,722
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

331
00:18:34,907 --> 00:18:36,880
I'm gonna have to go to
somebody else's wedding.

332
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,982
I'd like to know what
people are returning.

333
00:18:45,536 --> 00:18:46,545
What?

334
00:18:47,407 --> 00:18:49,441
I don't know what to say.
You got two of these?

335
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:50,529
What is it?

336
00:18:50,627 --> 00:18:52,915
You have your fingers in your ears?
It's a chip and dip.

337
00:18:53,042 --> 00:18:54,129
You have your friends over.

338
00:18:54,389 --> 00:18:56,799
You put chips on the sides
and dip in the middle.

339
00:18:58,643 --> 00:18:59,853
- Dip?
- Yes.

340
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,580
We went to these people's house
and they had one.

341
00:19:02,673 --> 00:19:05,464
It had sour cream with these
little brown onions in it.

342
00:19:05,993 --> 00:19:07,059
It's very good.

343
00:19:07,736 --> 00:19:09,603
You'll have to give me
that recipe, sometime.

344
00:19:10,925 --> 00:19:12,047
Cost twenty-two bucks.

345
00:19:12,676 --> 00:19:13,676
Shit!

346
00:19:13,863 --> 00:19:15,818
So, I'm going to return it.

347
00:19:16,078 --> 00:19:17,073
Today?

348
00:19:17,177 --> 00:19:19,060
Freddy Rumsin's cousin
works at General Mills.

349
00:19:19,177 --> 00:19:22,160
- We're all going to Ratazys for lunch.
- Maybe dinner.

350
00:19:22,611 --> 00:19:24,451
No, I have to return this thing.

351
00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:26,954
"Today," she said, I'm sure.

352
00:19:27,613 --> 00:19:28,885
I like doing things for her.

353
00:19:29,048 --> 00:19:30,499
You're right. I'm sorry.

354
00:19:31,137 --> 00:19:33,133
When you finish shopping,
come to join us.

355
00:19:33,446 --> 00:19:36,463
I hear they make a great
grasshopper, mildred.

356
00:19:45,701 --> 00:19:46,701
<i>Mr. Draper...</i>

357
00:19:46,888 --> 00:19:47,978
<i>Mr. Sterling to see you.</i>

358
00:19:58,141 --> 00:19:59,357
Send him in.

359
00:20:05,391 --> 00:20:07,108
Something for the golf bag.

360
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:09,288
That's the good stuff.

361
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,089
I take it you got home in one piece.

362
00:20:14,395 --> 00:20:18,005
Well, I made it as far as
the Knights Inn off the deconic.

363
00:20:18,639 --> 00:20:19,961
I know that place.

364
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,592
It's got great water pressure.

365
00:20:22,265 --> 00:20:23,749
Yeah, I slept in the car.

366
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,804
About last night...

367
00:20:27,264 --> 00:20:28,599
What about it?

368
00:20:31,432 --> 00:20:33,879
When a man get's to the point
when his name's on a building,

369
00:20:34,043 --> 00:20:36,440
he can get an unnatural
sense of entitlement.

370
00:20:37,003 --> 00:20:38,450
What does that mean, Roger?

371
00:20:39,695 --> 00:20:40,986
You're not gonna make this easy?

372
00:20:41,246 --> 00:20:43,020
I don't even know what this is.

373
00:20:46,252 --> 00:20:48,934
One night, years ago, I got very drunk.

374
00:20:49,816 --> 00:20:51,192
I drive home to my building.

375
00:20:51,627 --> 00:20:53,374
Pull into the garage.
Park in my spot.

376
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,501
I get in the elevator...

377
00:20:55,761 --> 00:20:57,305
It's late, there's no operator.

378
00:20:57,564 --> 00:20:59,256
Go up to the 12th floor. Get out.

379
00:20:59,862 --> 00:21:01,090
I'm walking down the hall.

380
00:21:01,939 --> 00:21:03,214
It's pink and orange.

381
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:06,052
I remember how ugly it was.

382
00:21:07,188 --> 00:21:09,213
Suddenly, my key won't
fit in the door.

383
00:21:11,178 --> 00:21:12,253
It wasn't my building.

384
00:21:16,069 --> 00:21:17,889
So, I guess what I'm saying is,

385
00:21:18,753 --> 00:21:21,735
at some point, we've all parked
in the wrong garage.

386
00:21:25,848 --> 00:21:27,199
Thanks for the bottle, Roger.

387
00:21:27,817 --> 00:21:28,817
And?

388
00:21:32,565 --> 00:21:34,498
Betty's gonna want that glass back.

389
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,127
Good man!

390
00:21:42,256 --> 00:21:43,924
Maybe I should get
a case of those, huh?

391
00:22:00,757 --> 00:22:02,169
This is taking a long time.

392
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,275
Is it that complicated?

393
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:05,571
The blue box...

394
00:22:06,176 --> 00:22:07,714
you must be a newlywed.

395
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,030
- That explains it.
- Yes, it does. Adorable.

396
00:22:12,228 --> 00:22:14,388
My husband, he'd rather be
drinking at lunch.

397
00:22:14,701 --> 00:22:16,434
Even when we were
newlyweds, I think.

398
00:22:16,694 --> 00:22:17,793
He's in advertising.

399
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:19,948
I'm in advertising. <i>Sterling Cooper</i>.

400
00:22:20,128 --> 00:22:22,103
He's at <i>B.D.O.</i>- media buyer,

401
00:22:22,318 --> 00:22:23,318
Jim Wallace.

402
00:22:23,728 --> 00:22:24,631
Don't know him.

403
00:22:25,465 --> 00:22:27,168
That's because you're here at lunch.

404
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:29,887
Next?

405
00:22:31,133 --> 00:22:32,225
I'm here to return this.

406
00:22:32,629 --> 00:22:34,415
There's nothing wrong with it.
We got two.

407
00:22:35,048 --> 00:22:37,770
That's why we suggest that people
register, to avoid duplications.

408
00:22:38,379 --> 00:22:40,314
We did register. We got two.

409
00:22:40,843 --> 00:22:42,107
Do you have your receipt?

410
00:22:43,504 --> 00:22:44,526
It was a gift.

411
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:47,708
Rosemary, we have a bridal return.

412
00:22:48,505 --> 00:22:50,222
- Him?
- Bridal registry.

413
00:22:52,664 --> 00:22:53,674
It's a chip and dip.

414
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,538
We got two.

415
00:22:56,006 --> 00:22:58,130
That's practically four of something.

416
00:22:59,817 --> 00:23:00,817
Name?

417
00:23:00,942 --> 00:23:01,942
Campbell.

418
00:23:02,152 --> 00:23:03,573
I suppose you don't have a receipt?

419
00:23:04,318 --> 00:23:07,082
Gosh, I wish I did...
no, it was a gift.

420
00:23:10,693 --> 00:23:12,660
There's nothing here.
Perhaps your wife told you

421
00:23:12,813 --> 00:23:15,425
she was registering, and in the end,
forgot to give us her name.

422
00:23:15,556 --> 00:23:16,443
Her name?

423
00:23:16,882 --> 00:23:18,631
Yes, it's under the maiden name.

424
00:23:19,813 --> 00:23:21,222
It's Vogel.

425
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:22,823
Why would you do that?

426
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:24,130
I don't know.

427
00:23:25,395 --> 00:23:26,276
Humps!

428
00:23:27,302 --> 00:23:29,056
Humps the camel Campbell!

429
00:23:29,347 --> 00:23:30,239
Matherton,

430
00:23:30,499 --> 00:23:31,777
what are you doing here.

431
00:23:32,179 --> 00:23:34,013
Getting my racket re-strung.

432
00:23:34,476 --> 00:23:35,577
Men's room back this way?

433
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:38,498
Down the hall,
past the water fountain.

434
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:40,355
What are you doing here?

435
00:23:40,897 --> 00:23:41,989
Returning a wedding gift.

436
00:23:42,681 --> 00:23:43,793
Not mine, I hope.

437
00:23:44,054 --> 00:23:45,825
No, it's a chip and dip.

438
00:23:45,997 --> 00:23:47,005
Trudy's aunt...

439
00:23:47,904 --> 00:23:50,241
that's Trudy Vogel,
do you mind lovely?

440
00:23:50,717 --> 00:23:51,719
What is it?

441
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:53,594
It's a chip and dip.

442
00:23:53,929 --> 00:23:56,921
You put chips on the side
and dip in the middle.

443
00:23:58,241 --> 00:23:59,435
For entertaining.

444
00:23:59,863 --> 00:24:00,894
It's a beaut!

445
00:24:01,534 --> 00:24:02,817
Hell of a wedding, by the way.

446
00:24:02,993 --> 00:24:05,649
Your cousin, Bethany,
bridesmaid bridesmaid.

447
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:09,653
Connecticut college
for women, indeed!

448
00:24:10,564 --> 00:24:11,572
I think I found it.

449
00:24:13,803 --> 00:24:14,803
That's nice.

450
00:24:16,179 --> 00:24:18,696
Good to see you.
We should do this, sometime.

451
00:24:19,476 --> 00:24:20,532
I'm comin' back for you.

452
00:24:24,554 --> 00:24:25,970
Do you have a receipt?

453
00:24:26,305 --> 00:24:28,505
No, I... I might've already said that.

454
00:24:29,246 --> 00:24:30,573
It was a gift.

455
00:24:31,116 --> 00:24:32,574
I can give you store credit.

456
00:24:32,724 --> 00:24:33,761
I was expecting cash.

457
00:24:34,952 --> 00:24:36,180
I'm sorry.

458
00:24:36,666 --> 00:24:39,141
Isn't there a way we could
work this out?

459
00:24:40,109 --> 00:24:41,268
Let me buy you a drink.

460
00:24:42,521 --> 00:24:43,589
I have an expense account.

461
00:24:45,304 --> 00:24:47,758
The best I can do is put
the store credit in your name

462
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:49,234
so you can spend it here.

463
00:24:49,794 --> 00:24:52,438
I would think about spending it
on you, if you gave me cash.

464
00:24:52,619 --> 00:24:53,629
It's $22.

465
00:24:54,578 --> 00:24:55,741
Store credit.

466
00:24:57,359 --> 00:24:58,368
Thank you.

467
00:25:02,306 --> 00:25:03,791
By the way, Matherton...

468
00:25:05,615 --> 00:25:06,919
He has the clap.

469
00:25:16,205 --> 00:25:17,888
Same price as a chip and dip!

470
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:21,269
Amazing!

471
00:25:23,153 --> 00:25:24,954
And I was gonna try
to make you feel bad,

472
00:25:25,238 --> 00:25:27,557
by telling you where
Carlotta's stocking's at.

473
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:28,907
What the hell is that for?

474
00:25:29,447 --> 00:25:30,598
It's for me.

475
00:25:31,266 --> 00:25:32,528
22 caliber, bolt action.

476
00:25:33,028 --> 00:25:34,488
Use it in good health.

477
00:25:35,389 --> 00:25:36,629
Why not?

478
00:25:37,267 --> 00:25:38,659
Boys will be boys, right?

479
00:25:43,029 --> 00:25:45,833
You couldn't hit the side
of St. Patrick's with that.

480
00:25:46,417 --> 00:25:48,181
It's good for twenty yards.

481
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:06,514
it's your 4:30, mr. Campbell.

482
00:26:16,495 --> 00:26:19,186
The Nixon brain trust
is coming in tomorrow.

483
00:26:19,685 --> 00:26:21,664
The nomination is expected as a lock.

484
00:26:22,245 --> 00:26:23,692
All we need is an opponent.

485
00:26:23,917 --> 00:26:26,852
The rumor is, Lynden Johnson's gonna
be making a play at the convention,

486
00:26:27,047 --> 00:26:29,031
so we may not be going
against Kennedy, at all.

487
00:26:29,258 --> 00:26:30,785
Then we have to worry about the south.

488
00:26:30,902 --> 00:26:32,511
It's going to be Kennedy.

489
00:26:33,229 --> 00:26:36,008
Boston Blackie won west virginia.

490
00:26:36,497 --> 00:26:37,976
Now, where does that leave us?

491
00:26:38,437 --> 00:26:41,224
Nixon, experienced in office,
know's foreign affairs.

492
00:26:41,569 --> 00:26:45,416
He probably learned that when they
were throwing rocks at him in Caracas.

493
00:26:45,688 --> 00:26:48,604
Knows the real threat of communism,
home and abroad.

494
00:26:49,432 --> 00:26:51,461
He's not helping himself
keeping quiet on Castro.

495
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,343
True, but he's not a catholic.

496
00:26:53,554 --> 00:26:54,756
Our hands are tied there.

497
00:26:54,939 --> 00:26:57,464
Nixon thinks hitting the catholic
thing is a bad idea.

498
00:26:57,869 --> 00:26:59,490
- They're going to say that.
- To us?

499
00:27:00,275 --> 00:27:02,929
They believe it. It hasn't held up
in any of the primaries.

500
00:27:03,459 --> 00:27:05,371
Kennedy keeps making
opponents apologize.

501
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:07,558
- For what?
- For being intolerant.

502
00:27:07,809 --> 00:27:09,822
This is Dick Nixon
we're talking about.

503
00:27:10,063 --> 00:27:12,639
You may be too young to remember
the pink lady congress-

504
00:27:13,585 --> 00:27:15,311
woman from california.

505
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,758
He practically shot her
in the face to win.

506
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:20,587
If it is Kennedy,

507
00:27:20,817 --> 00:27:22,735
Nixon will lower himself
to the occasion.

508
00:27:23,482 --> 00:27:25,044
It's going to be Kennedy.

509
00:27:25,374 --> 00:27:27,604
Good. Catholic son of a millionaire.

510
00:27:27,804 --> 00:27:29,895
A boy too scared to do anything
but go on vacation.

511
00:27:31,311 --> 00:27:32,457
I met him.

512
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:33,950
He is a boy.

513
00:27:34,096 --> 00:27:35,749
He's only four years
younger than Nixon.

514
00:27:35,878 --> 00:27:38,333
But has he been sitting next to
the leader of the free world

515
00:27:38,485 --> 00:27:39,542
for twice that time?

516
00:27:39,677 --> 00:27:40,697
He's inexperienced.

517
00:27:40,995 --> 00:27:42,366
He doesn't even wear a hat.

518
00:27:43,342 --> 00:27:44,370
I don't know.

519
00:27:45,123 --> 00:27:47,043
You know who else
doesn't wear a hat?

520
00:27:47,412 --> 00:27:48,311
Elvis.

521
00:27:48,872 --> 00:27:50,749
That's what we're dealing with.

522
00:27:53,971 --> 00:27:56,088
Remind me to stop
hiring young people.

523
00:27:57,174 --> 00:27:58,843
America does not want some greasy kid

524
00:27:59,059 --> 00:28:00,550
with his finger on the button.

525
00:28:02,184 --> 00:28:03,979
Now, if the adults can weigh in?

526
00:28:12,234 --> 00:28:14,512
Communism, taxes, health care.

527
00:28:15,543 --> 00:28:18,620
Kinsey, you wanna write this down,
or should I call a girl in?

528
00:28:29,296 --> 00:28:31,534
Hi, honey! I made a roast beef.

529
00:28:32,109 --> 00:28:33,478
Just cut the strings.

530
00:28:33,733 --> 00:28:34,835
More roast beef.

531
00:28:36,933 --> 00:28:38,464
You know, it's just me tonight, right?

532
00:28:55,127 --> 00:28:57,605
That was a wedding gift
from my aunt Letty!

533
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,637
And you go and get some stupid toy!

534
00:28:59,798 --> 00:29:01,120
I can't believe you!

535
00:29:01,474 --> 00:29:03,000
That was for us!

536
00:29:03,582 --> 00:29:06,711
You're always telling me to grow up!
I can't believe you!

1
00:29:38,717 --> 00:29:40,642
Halls let me ask you something.

2
00:29:54,341 --> 00:29:55,346
Mr. Campbell?

3
00:29:56,216 --> 00:29:58,716
I thought take you up on
your offer to look at my work,

4
00:29:59,429 --> 00:30:01,201
but if you're in the middle
of something...

5
00:30:06,842 --> 00:30:07,845
What's that?

6
00:30:09,091 --> 00:30:10,472
A wedding present.

7
00:30:12,793 --> 00:30:14,268
I really appreciate it.

8
00:30:17,281 --> 00:30:18,981
You ever been hunting, Peggy?

9
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,191
No, I don't think so.

10
00:30:21,786 --> 00:30:23,747
You either have or you haven't.

11
00:30:24,176 --> 00:30:26,384
I went a couple of times
with my uncle.

12
00:30:26,617 --> 00:30:27,573
New Hampshire.

13
00:30:29,992 --> 00:30:32,244
I saw my cousin shoot
a rabbit by coney island.

14
00:30:33,417 --> 00:30:35,472
It's an incredible sensation.

15
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,223
You have to be very quiet.

16
00:30:44,599 --> 00:30:47,578
Take it down with the first shot,
or you scare it away.

17
00:30:48,237 --> 00:30:51,438
Then sometimes, you have to go up
and finish it off.

18
00:30:53,957 --> 00:30:56,599
Then you tie it to the bumper
and you go home.

19
00:31:00,049 --> 00:31:01,815
But you know what
I've always wanted to do?

20
00:31:04,115 --> 00:31:05,571
I would pick it up...

21
00:31:07,033 --> 00:31:08,655
Throw it's back legs
over my shoulder

22
00:31:08,915 --> 00:31:12,207
and I would drag it through
the snow to this little cabin.

23
00:31:13,411 --> 00:31:14,433
And there,

24
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:18,801
I'd hang it up between
a couple of trees.

25
00:31:20,446 --> 00:31:21,679
Cut it open.

26
00:31:22,357 --> 00:31:23,461
Drain it.

27
00:31:23,778 --> 00:31:24,928
Dress it.

28
00:31:26,979 --> 00:31:28,752
And then I'd take
my big hunting knife,

29
00:31:29,181 --> 00:31:30,543
and I'd cut this loin.

30
00:31:31,415 --> 00:31:32,988
Right out of the side.

31
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:39,730
Then I'd go into the cabin

32
00:31:40,768 --> 00:31:43,656
and there'd be this woman,
waiting for me,

33
00:31:44,893 --> 00:31:48,556
standing by one of those old stoves
with the big black pipe,

34
00:31:49,646 --> 00:31:50,656
and I'd hand it to her.

35
00:31:51,477 --> 00:31:53,837
And she put it in a cast iron skillet

36
00:31:54,349 --> 00:31:56,135
and then I'd sit at the table

37
00:31:58,349 --> 00:32:00,091
and she'd bring it to me.

38
00:32:02,627 --> 00:32:05,034
And I'd wipe my knife on my knee

39
00:32:07,161 --> 00:32:08,843
and then I would eat it,

40
00:32:09,747 --> 00:32:11,578
while she watches.

41
00:32:14,806 --> 00:32:16,356
That would be wonderful.

42
00:32:20,912 --> 00:32:23,012
I'll take a look at this for you.

43
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:29,670
Thank you.

44
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,722
Can I get a ham sandwich?

45
00:32:59,439 --> 00:33:02,938
And you know what, I'll take a cherry
danish, the big one in the back.

46
00:33:10,054 --> 00:33:11,828
Thank you ma'am, here you go.

47
00:33:36,747 --> 00:33:37,780
Helen!

48
00:33:38,153 --> 00:33:39,174
Hello!

49
00:33:40,624 --> 00:33:41,798
Hi, Betty.

50
00:33:42,178 --> 00:33:43,352
How are you?

51
00:33:44,531 --> 00:33:45,541
I'm well.

52
00:33:46,422 --> 00:33:47,689
And how's Glen?

53
00:33:51,049 --> 00:33:52,986
I wasn't going to say anything.

54
00:33:53,244 --> 00:33:54,947
I was just going to go right on by.

55
00:33:56,611 --> 00:33:57,866
What's wrong?

56
00:33:59,299 --> 00:34:00,891
I was going...

57
00:34:05,223 --> 00:34:07,390
I was going through
Glen's treasure box the other day

58
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:09,970
and I found a lock of blonde hair.

59
00:34:10,591 --> 00:34:11,755
Your hair, he says.

60
00:34:12,505 --> 00:34:14,034
Well, I don't know what he told you.

61
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:15,830
Glen doesn't lie,
not when he's caught.

62
00:34:16,006 --> 00:34:17,761
- I'm not saying it's a lie.
- Betty!

63
00:34:18,941 --> 00:34:21,466
- He asked me for it.
- And you gave it to him.

64
00:34:21,906 --> 00:34:23,600
He is nine years old.

65
00:34:25,996 --> 00:34:27,062
What is wrong with you?

66
00:34:41,474 --> 00:34:43,953
He was a bold man,
that first ate an oyster.

67
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:46,780
I believe that was <i>Jonathan Swift</i>*.

68
00:34:47,974 --> 00:34:49,866
What, are we naming them now?

69
00:34:51,351 --> 00:34:52,351
Look at you.

70
00:34:52,532 --> 00:34:54,600
I had no idea you were such
a fan of the mulusk.

71
00:34:54,823 --> 00:34:57,172
Never really gave them
a chance before.

72
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,434
But, I'm acquiring a taste.

73
00:35:00,882 --> 00:35:02,222
It's like eating a mermaid.

74
00:35:04,779 --> 00:35:07,352
You ready for another or have you
topped off your tank?

75
00:35:08,766 --> 00:35:10,189
You're leading this dance.

76
00:35:11,531 --> 00:35:13,304
All right, what the hell,
it's the G.O.P. .

77
00:35:13,476 --> 00:35:15,889
They'll never smell it over
the stench of brill cream.

78
00:35:17,665 --> 00:35:18,665
Another round.

79
00:35:19,041 --> 00:35:20,041
Wait!

80
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:22,866
Are you still good with these or
do you prefer your beloved rye.

81
00:35:23,078 --> 00:35:25,412
Today, I'm on the Roger Sterling diet.

82
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:29,431
Easy on the Vermouth,
another dozen of these.

83
00:35:30,852 --> 00:35:31,960
Me, as well.

84
00:35:35,171 --> 00:35:38,306
I've always thought you were a man
who could keep up, Don.

85
00:35:56,172 --> 00:35:57,762
Anything else, gentlemen?

86
00:35:59,116 --> 00:36:00,618
Did you know they served cheese cake

87
00:36:00,841 --> 00:36:02,574
to the Olympic athletes
in ancient greece?

88
00:36:03,145 --> 00:36:05,852
So, what's an extra lap or two
around the steno pool for us.

89
00:36:06,456 --> 00:36:07,538
Two cheese cakes.

90
00:36:07,798 --> 00:36:09,707
And don't let me see
the bottom of this glass.

91
00:36:12,568 --> 00:36:14,271
What were we talking about?

92
00:36:15,097 --> 00:36:16,587
Yes, the Russians.

93
00:36:16,878 --> 00:36:18,841
Shooting those dogs into space.

94
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:21,754
I believe we've branded
them cat lovers

95
00:36:21,977 --> 00:36:23,727
and moved on to the subject
of true love.

96
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:24,940
Right!

97
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,925
<i>Desi and Lucy</i>*, please!

98
00:36:27,382 --> 00:36:29,052
He's divorcing her, again.

99
00:36:29,672 --> 00:36:32,479
Did he wake up one morning and say,
"oh, yeah, I forgot, I hate you."

100
00:36:35,243 --> 00:36:37,791
what makes a man marry
the same woman twice?

101
00:36:38,131 --> 00:36:40,027
I believe, in his case,

102
00:36:40,316 --> 00:36:41,780
it was the allure of orange hair.

103
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:45,725
I like red heads.

104
00:36:46,754 --> 00:36:49,359
They're mouths are like
a drop of strawberry jam

105
00:36:49,767 --> 00:36:50,998
in a glass of milk.

106
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:56,170
I think I woke my ulcer up.

107
00:36:57,569 --> 00:36:59,023
Drinking milk,

108
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:01,243
I never liked it.

109
00:37:02,193 --> 00:37:03,193
I hate cows.

110
00:37:11,506 --> 00:37:15,022
You keep matching me like this, you'll
have an ulcer of your own, any day now.

111
00:37:17,204 --> 00:37:18,026
One more?

112
00:37:19,431 --> 00:37:21,546
Instead of coffee, sure.

113
00:37:22,396 --> 00:37:23,770
But then, we should get the check.

114
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:46,076
Hey, Burty I have the shirt.

115
00:37:48,941 --> 00:37:50,349
What is this?

116
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:54,545
Bobby spilled some concord grape juice
down the front of it... I washed it.

117
00:37:55,927 --> 00:37:58,182
This is Ernie's shirt, not Bobby's.

118
00:37:58,366 --> 00:38:00,074
Well, what do you know.

119
00:38:01,054 --> 00:38:03,341
Did you have a party
you didn't invite me to?

120
00:38:04,634 --> 00:38:05,634
I'll invite you.

121
00:38:05,893 --> 00:38:07,795
It's going to be a dinner party.

122
00:38:08,512 --> 00:38:10,643
And I'm just trying the wine,
you know,

123
00:38:10,956 --> 00:38:12,337
develop my palate.

124
00:38:13,388 --> 00:38:16,143
Do you want some... it's a split.
There's another glass.

125
00:38:16,888 --> 00:38:18,022
How are you?

126
00:38:18,764 --> 00:38:20,051
I'm good.

127
00:38:22,763 --> 00:38:24,602
Maybe I will try some.

128
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,142
Betty...

129
00:38:33,702 --> 00:38:35,978
Jill Sandifer was in the market
earlier today.

130
00:38:37,031 --> 00:38:38,031
What?

131
00:38:38,789 --> 00:38:39,857
Is it true?

132
00:38:40,117 --> 00:38:42,774
You're my friend, Francine.
Are you coming over here to do recon?

133
00:38:42,907 --> 00:38:44,475
I'm worried about you.

134
00:38:56,157 --> 00:38:57,768
I don't know what happened.

135
00:38:59,719 --> 00:39:02,269
I kept thinking in the car
on the way back.

136
00:39:03,038 --> 00:39:05,117
"Did that really happen?"

137
00:39:07,156 --> 00:39:08,594
then I just put it out of my mind.

138
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:10,637
Well, what did happen?

139
00:39:11,033 --> 00:39:12,437
Whatever you heard.

140
00:39:15,471 --> 00:39:17,411
I don't even wanna hear it.

141
00:39:18,055 --> 00:39:20,080
I have my own version and it's plenty.

142
00:39:20,296 --> 00:39:21,306
It's okay.

143
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:24,453
Honestly, I don't know anyone who
wouldn't wanna take a good poke at her.

144
00:39:24,677 --> 00:39:26,168
She's so selfish.

145
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,442
Those long locks

146
00:39:27,665 --> 00:39:30,190
and that pathetic job
at Benson's jewelry.

147
00:39:32,312 --> 00:39:34,244
Carlton went in there to buy me
some earrings.

148
00:39:35,127 --> 00:39:36,529
I'm sure she loved that.

149
00:39:36,877 --> 00:39:38,838
Then I saw the Benson's jewelry
wrapping paper,

150
00:39:39,003 --> 00:39:40,292
I almost threw it in his face.

151
00:39:41,393 --> 00:39:44,164
And that John Kennedy, I hate him.

152
00:39:45,564 --> 00:39:46,564
Really?

153
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:49,963
What will people think?

154
00:39:50,258 --> 00:39:52,763
I think they'll be glad to know
you're not a marshmellow.

155
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:55,338
Do people think I'm weak?

156
00:39:55,506 --> 00:39:56,308
No.

157
00:39:56,568 --> 00:39:58,769
It's just you're so sweet
and perfect.

158
00:39:59,254 --> 00:40:00,254
I'm not.

159
00:40:00,437 --> 00:40:02,064
Well, it does seem that way.

160
00:40:02,828 --> 00:40:04,636
Look, it'll all be forgotten.

161
00:40:05,179 --> 00:40:07,809
We don't have to include
Helen Bishop anymore.

162
00:40:08,142 --> 00:40:10,364
Let her know who's side
we're all on.

163
00:40:12,398 --> 00:40:13,631
My mother

164
00:40:15,638 --> 00:40:16,954
always said,

165
00:40:17,502 --> 00:40:19,697
"you're painting a masterpiece."

166
00:40:20,183 --> 00:40:22,484
"Make sure to hide
the brush strokes."

167
00:40:24,566 --> 00:40:26,179
she was really beautiful.

168
00:40:27,564 --> 00:40:28,841
Then I think,

169
00:40:29,752 --> 00:40:30,774
you know...

170
00:40:31,379 --> 00:40:33,512
Why am I doing all of this?
I'm not that vain.

171
00:40:34,254 --> 00:40:35,764
What does Doctor Wayne say?

172
00:40:36,316 --> 00:40:37,399
Nothing,

173
00:40:38,291 --> 00:40:40,639
except, "tell me more about that."

174
00:40:42,192 --> 00:40:43,856
I'm still dying to try it.

175
00:40:45,382 --> 00:40:46,638
I'm pretty sure

176
00:40:47,648 --> 00:40:50,343
Doctor Wayne tried to look down
my neck line the other way.

177
00:40:51,254 --> 00:40:52,364
He sits behind me.

178
00:40:53,252 --> 00:40:54,460
And as far as I'm concerned,

179
00:40:54,627 --> 00:40:57,982
as long as men look at me that way,
I'm earning my keep.

180
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:02,576
Then every once in a while,

181
00:41:03,731 --> 00:41:04,940
I think,

182
00:41:08,505 --> 00:41:10,078
This is something else.

183
00:41:12,189 --> 00:41:14,053
I don't want my husband to see this.

184
00:41:16,252 --> 00:41:18,588
I love to be looked at that way.

185
00:41:23,316 --> 00:41:25,925
You should get out of here.
Nap time is about to end.

186
00:41:28,869 --> 00:41:30,527
Well, I'm just glad you're okay.

187
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,456
We haven't gone over the Nixon thing

188
00:41:39,629 --> 00:41:41,196
you're prepared, right?

189
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:42,835
The only way.

190
00:41:43,193 --> 00:41:44,061
I'm sorry gentlemen.

191
00:41:44,225 --> 00:41:46,429
Mr. Sterling, Mr. Draper...
I'm waiting for service.

192
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:48,358
So am I. What are you talking about?

193
00:41:48,605 --> 00:41:49,505
We're out of order.

194
00:41:51,463 --> 00:41:52,555
Crap!

195
00:41:52,878 --> 00:41:54,760
When will it be back up...
Shall we wait?

196
00:41:55,005 --> 00:41:56,428
We've got our best man on it.

197
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:58,559
That's a comfort.

198
00:41:59,817 --> 00:42:00,998
Jesus, we're already late.

199
00:42:01,612 --> 00:42:03,066
I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Sterling.

200
00:42:03,753 --> 00:42:05,616
It's certainly a believable excuse.

201
00:42:06,349 --> 00:42:07,469
We could go back to lunch.

202
00:42:07,754 --> 00:42:10,559
No, Cooper would have a seizure,
if he hasn't already.

203
00:42:12,779 --> 00:42:13,612
So...

204
00:42:40,486 --> 00:42:41,497
This is ridiculous!

205
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:43,657
A building this big,
what if there was a fire?

206
00:42:44,205 --> 00:42:45,802
Then you're walking down.

207
00:42:46,444 --> 00:42:47,684
It'd be easier.

208
00:43:00,004 --> 00:43:02,499
We should check the elevator.
Maybe, it's up again.

209
00:43:03,923 --> 00:43:05,661
I think we'd hear it go
on the stairwell.

210
00:43:06,256 --> 00:43:07,061
You think?

211
00:43:07,694 --> 00:43:08,917
Roger, I don't know.

212
00:43:09,945 --> 00:43:11,418
Maybe they're late, too.

213
00:43:11,931 --> 00:43:13,633
Or maybe we can get
them to come down,

214
00:43:13,782 --> 00:43:15,954
and have the presentation on
the eight floor landing.

215
00:43:16,154 --> 00:43:17,998
- There's plenty of seats.
- Damned elevator.

216
00:43:18,569 --> 00:43:20,259
What do you wanna do?
We're almost there.

217
00:43:20,443 --> 00:43:21,648
The hell we are!

218
00:43:22,082 --> 00:43:25,429
We can waste another five minutes
talking about it, if you want.

219
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:27,070
Let's go.

220
00:43:29,049 --> 00:43:30,494
Get behind me with that thing.

221
00:43:47,929 --> 00:43:49,239
Six to go.

222
00:43:49,617 --> 00:43:50,986
I've been counting.

223
00:43:53,721 --> 00:43:55,663
- You wanna rest a minute?
- No, sir.

224
00:43:56,475 --> 00:43:57,475
No I don't.

225
00:43:58,538 --> 00:43:59,660
Keep moving.

226
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:02,586
I forgot, navy men.

227
00:44:15,289 --> 00:44:16,764
I love red heads...

228
00:44:18,491 --> 00:44:19,919
with big breasts.

229
00:44:20,308 --> 00:44:22,355
We'll find you one if
we still have jobs.

230
00:44:22,869 --> 00:44:24,588
You want me to run ahead?

231
00:44:25,552 --> 00:44:26,552
Run?

232
00:44:27,805 --> 00:44:29,428
My name is on the building.

233
00:44:29,741 --> 00:44:31,321
They can wait for me.

234
00:44:34,491 --> 00:44:36,024
I gotta stop talking.

235
00:44:53,681 --> 00:44:54,690
I'm fine.

236
00:44:55,115 --> 00:44:56,817
I just lost my tie clip.

237
00:44:57,176 --> 00:44:58,334
I'll find it... go on.

238
00:44:58,555 --> 00:44:59,555
You sure?

239
00:44:59,883 --> 00:45:01,163
I said, go on!

240
00:45:13,926 --> 00:45:15,154
Found it.

241
00:45:33,431 --> 00:45:35,445
- Where the hell were you?
- The elevator's out.

242
00:45:35,868 --> 00:45:37,253
That's quite a hike...
where's Sterling?

243
00:45:37,382 --> 00:45:38,533
He's coming.

244
00:45:39,646 --> 00:45:41,361
Here are the troops now.

245
00:45:41,891 --> 00:45:44,216
Lou, Michael, Charlie, Don Draper.

246
00:45:45,031 --> 00:45:46,804
Our creative muscle.

247
00:45:46,997 --> 00:45:48,922
Hopefully, a little brains, too.

248
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:51,935
Sorry to keep you fellas waiting.
The elevator's out.

249
00:45:52,241 --> 00:45:53,713
Pete Campbell, of course.

250
00:45:53,916 --> 00:45:55,403
We've spoken on the phone.

251
00:45:56,845 --> 00:45:58,982
He'll continue handling
things for you,

252
00:45:59,182 --> 00:46:01,081
and when I say "handling,"

253
00:46:01,304 --> 00:46:02,784
I mean he runs everything by me.

254
00:46:06,075 --> 00:46:07,054
And of course,

255
00:46:07,790 --> 00:46:10,678
my partner, Roger Sterling...

256
00:46:12,903 --> 00:46:14,603
We heard the elevator's down.

257
00:46:15,557 --> 00:46:17,272
Those boys over at <i>United Fruit</i>*,

258
00:46:17,532 --> 00:46:19,810
talk about you like invented
the damn banana.

259
00:46:27,504 --> 00:46:28,479
You all right.

260
00:46:29,556 --> 00:46:30,661
Get us some ice water!

261
00:46:31,154 --> 00:46:32,162
Oysters.

262
00:46:32,783 --> 00:46:34,128
I can see that.

263
00:46:34,694 --> 00:46:35,874
Twenty-three floors.

264
00:46:37,897 --> 00:46:40,433
I'm just sorry I missed this lunch.
We were with some quakers.

265
00:46:40,556 --> 00:46:41,556
Had cottage cheese.

266
00:46:42,136 --> 00:46:44,285
Well, let's let Roger re-group.

267
00:46:48,004 --> 00:46:49,056
I'll be right in.

268
00:46:58,305 --> 00:46:59,356
You okay?

269
00:47:06,805 --> 00:47:07,805
Fine.

270
00:47:10,495 --> 00:47:11,495
Good.
