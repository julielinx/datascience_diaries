1
00:00:00,427 --> 00:00:02,241
Previously on Mad Men...

2
00:00:02,372 --> 00:00:05,320
I get everything right and
I'm still getting it from you!

3
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:08,436
We were in the running,
I mean, actually this time...

4
00:00:08,911 --> 00:00:10,217
for Jaguar.

5
00:00:10,406 --> 00:00:13,747
Since I was a little girl it's
all I've ever dreamed about.

6
00:00:13,893 --> 00:00:15,868
I don't wanna keep
you from your dream.

7
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:18,286
I have a spectacular
new site in the city.

8
00:00:18,622 --> 00:00:20,177
Aren't you worried
you're going to get caught?

9
00:00:20,382 --> 00:00:21,734
I've got an apartment.

10
00:00:21,878 --> 00:00:26,147
When we land Jaguar the world
will know we've arrived.

11
00:00:55,933 --> 00:00:59,848

12
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,789
Jaguar, the mistress who'll
do things your wife won't.

13
00:01:16,191 --> 00:01:17,991
What did I say before?

14
00:01:18,025 --> 00:01:19,726
The client doesn't want
to hear the word mistress.

15
00:01:19,761 --> 00:01:21,628
Salesmen can use it,
but the campaign can't.

16
00:01:21,663 --> 00:01:25,766
Jaguar, you'll love it
when you're in it.

17
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,502
Are we just spitting up
lines now?

18
00:01:29,503 --> 00:01:32,577
You know what?
Let's take a break.

19
00:01:36,209 --> 00:01:37,944
Where are you going?

20
00:01:37,978 --> 00:01:40,913
What was unclear about the fact that
he's taking a break and we're not?

21
00:01:49,355 --> 00:01:51,756
I need you to sign off
on Secor laxative.

22
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:55,393
I told you you were in charge of all
ongoing business till Jaguar's done.

23
00:01:55,427 --> 00:01:57,562
- Just handle it.
- Done.

24
00:01:57,597 --> 00:02:00,465
- How's the prospect doing?
- Is it lunchtime?

25
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,000
Jesus, is it?

26
00:02:02,034 --> 00:02:04,802
Mr. Sterling bought
lobster from The Palm.

27
00:02:04,836 --> 00:02:06,737
Doesn't that sound good?

28
00:02:16,715 --> 00:02:19,416
So I don't know what the
Jaguar executives will say.

29
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:22,219
But I got dealerships
in Montclair,

30
00:02:22,253 --> 00:02:25,255
Englewood, Morristown,
Paramus and Rutherford.

31
00:02:25,289 --> 00:02:27,024
And I carry three other
foreign cars.

32
00:02:27,058 --> 00:02:30,327
So, frankly, creative has
to be pretty spectacular,

33
00:02:30,361 --> 00:02:32,896
or Jaguar is just another
word on the sign.

34
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:35,432
Well, then we have
nothing to worry about.

35
00:02:35,466 --> 00:02:37,766
The dealership on the ground
floor of the corporate offices

36
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,404
on Madison has done very well just
having that XK-E in the entrance.

37
00:02:41,438 --> 00:02:43,139
You have to be excited
about this car.

38
00:02:43,173 --> 00:02:46,108
Oh, it's a red-hot number.
I'm excited about that.

39
00:02:46,143 --> 00:02:48,310
But I'm a hard man to please.

40
00:02:48,345 --> 00:02:51,347
I always feel like someone
should go the extra mile.

41
00:02:51,381 --> 00:02:53,915
We're open to anything
your heart desires.

42
00:02:53,949 --> 00:02:57,118
Well, the other day

43
00:02:57,153 --> 00:02:59,354
when we were all touring
your offices,

44
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:01,956
our guide was
a dynamite redhead.

45
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:05,360
- Joan Harris.
- Built like a B-52.

46
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:07,328
Yeah, we know who
you're talking about.

47
00:03:07,363 --> 00:03:10,164
Well, I sure would like the opportunity
to get to know her better.

48
00:03:10,198 --> 00:03:12,799
Well, a lot of guys would.
But, you know, she's--

49
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:14,468
She's a very interesting girl.

50
00:03:14,502 --> 00:03:17,204
She's one of these free spirits?

51
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:19,273
You know, open to ideas?

52
00:03:19,307 --> 00:03:22,976
So you like redheads?
I think I know some.

53
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:25,178
I like that redhead.

54
00:03:25,212 --> 00:03:28,047
And I think she and I
would both

55
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:30,983
welcome the opportunity
to spend a night together.

56
00:03:31,017 --> 00:03:34,954
Well, you could ask her out.
It wouldn't be a conflict.

57
00:03:34,988 --> 00:03:37,656
No, I'm kind of shy.

58
00:03:39,493 --> 00:03:41,193
All I'm saying is, if it happens,
it would make me happy.

59
00:03:41,227 --> 00:03:44,296
If it doesn't, well, no
guarantees in life, right?

60
00:03:47,032 --> 00:03:49,401
Get another round.
I'll get it.

61
00:03:49,435 --> 00:03:51,369
Absolutely not.

62
00:03:52,371 --> 00:03:53,871
Was that what I think it was?

63
00:03:53,906 --> 00:03:55,407
Yes, it was.

64
00:03:55,441 --> 00:03:57,708
Why didn't you just let me
tell him she was married?

65
00:03:57,742 --> 00:04:01,345
Because so is he.
And he already knows that.

66
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:04,181
Well, we wanted to be
in the car business.

67
00:04:10,188 --> 00:04:12,689
- You waited up.
- No.

68
00:04:12,724 --> 00:04:14,890
I mean, yes.

69
00:04:14,925 --> 00:04:18,094
I'm going in to read tomorrow
for a really good part.

70
00:04:18,129 --> 00:04:19,862
An audition?
Why didn't you call?

71
00:04:19,896 --> 00:04:23,166
Honestly, because I had to go to
10th Avenue to get the script

72
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,734
and then I went
and talked to Fanny,

73
00:04:24,768 --> 00:04:26,969
you know, who teaches
my auditioning class.

74
00:04:27,004 --> 00:04:28,271
You're very good at auditions.

75
00:04:28,305 --> 00:04:30,772
Not as good as the girls
who get parts.

76
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:35,844
You know what?
Let's talk about your day.

77
00:04:35,878 --> 00:04:38,614
Well, I was gonna watch Carson
and cry myself to sleep.

78
00:04:38,648 --> 00:04:40,749
It'll come to you.

79
00:04:40,783 --> 00:04:44,019
- It always does.
- Unless it comes to you.

80
00:04:44,053 --> 00:04:46,354
Do you really want help
or do want to yell at me?

81
00:04:46,388 --> 00:04:47,788
I don't know yet.

82
00:04:47,822 --> 00:04:50,525
What's the strategy?

83
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:53,861
A Jaguar is beautiful,

84
00:04:53,895 --> 00:04:55,229
but unreliable.

85
00:04:55,264 --> 00:04:57,565
It comes with a tool kit
the size of a typewriter.

86
00:04:57,599 --> 00:04:59,634
You basically have to own
another car to go places.

87
00:04:59,668 --> 00:05:03,002
So we're saying it's
your gorgeous mistress.

88
00:05:03,037 --> 00:05:07,407
So a wife is like a
Buick in the garage.

89
00:05:07,441 --> 00:05:09,376
We're trying to make
a weakness into a strength.

90
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,545
- We're selling to men.
- No, I got it.

91
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:15,382
Doesn't being a mistress
make the car immoral?

92
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:17,283
The word mistress
won't be in the ad.

93
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:21,153
I don't know,
but it sounds great.

94
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,726
I need to learn some of this.

95
00:05:33,932 --> 00:05:35,833
<i>You're here early.</i>

96
00:05:35,867 --> 00:05:37,768
What can I do for you?

97
00:05:37,803 --> 00:05:40,071
Nothing.

98
00:05:40,105 --> 00:05:43,107
Nothing, it's just I got
some bad news last night

99
00:05:43,141 --> 00:05:45,710
and I was hoping
you'd help me deliver it.

100
00:05:45,744 --> 00:05:47,345
What happened?

101
00:05:47,379 --> 00:05:50,380
Well, we were having dinner
with Herb Rennet.

102
00:05:50,415 --> 00:05:52,916
I think you met him
the other day, from Jaguar.

103
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:56,152
- Handsome guy.
- I don't remember any of them.

104
00:05:56,187 --> 00:05:58,121
Well, I don't know what to do.

105
00:05:58,155 --> 00:06:00,557
He basically pledged
he wasn't going to back us.

106
00:06:00,592 --> 00:06:02,192
Why not?

107
00:06:02,227 --> 00:06:04,928
Turns out he wanted something
we're not prepared to give.

108
00:06:04,962 --> 00:06:07,330
Something very unorthodox.

109
00:06:07,364 --> 00:06:09,199
<i>- Good morning.</i>
- Yes?

110
00:06:09,233 --> 00:06:11,935
I'm here.
I'm going to get Danish.

111
00:06:11,969 --> 00:06:14,637
What does he want?

112
00:06:14,671 --> 00:06:17,040
Uh...

113
00:06:17,074 --> 00:06:19,876
I feel like I shouldn't
even bring this up.

114
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:22,778
In fact, I don't know
how to bring this up.

115
00:06:22,812 --> 00:06:25,147
But we're going to lose Jaguar

116
00:06:25,181 --> 00:06:28,250
unless an arrangement
is made, and

117
00:06:28,284 --> 00:06:30,219
it involves you and,

118
00:06:30,253 --> 00:06:33,155
well, Herb.

119
00:06:34,423 --> 00:06:36,524
How did that come up?

120
00:06:36,559 --> 00:06:40,094
He said he was crazy about
you and then he just asked.

121
00:06:40,129 --> 00:06:42,663
And then I thought
we were past it,

122
00:06:42,697 --> 00:06:45,332
but right before
we put him in a cab,

123
00:06:45,367 --> 00:06:48,402
he said it again and it
was quite conditional--

124
00:06:48,436 --> 00:06:50,838
A night with you or no vote.

125
00:06:50,873 --> 00:06:53,274
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

126
00:06:53,308 --> 00:06:57,410
Anyway, if you can think
of some way to break the news

127
00:06:57,444 --> 00:07:01,081
to the company that we're out of
this, I'd really appreciate it.

128
00:07:01,115 --> 00:07:03,549
You're unbelievable.

129
00:07:03,584 --> 00:07:05,185
I'm married.

130
00:07:05,219 --> 00:07:07,220
How would you feel
if someone asked Trudy?

131
00:07:07,255 --> 00:07:10,790
I didn't bring this up.
He did.

132
00:07:12,058 --> 00:07:14,493
If you're not interested
in the idea at all,

133
00:07:14,527 --> 00:07:17,163
I appreciate--

134
00:07:17,197 --> 00:07:18,964
It's just--

135
00:07:18,999 --> 00:07:22,067
It seems to me that there's something
that could be worth the sacrifice.

136
00:07:22,102 --> 00:07:24,770
We're talking about
a night in your life.

137
00:07:24,805 --> 00:07:27,872
We've all had nights in our lives
where we've made mistakes for free.

138
00:07:27,907 --> 00:07:30,374
You're talking about
prostitution.

139
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:33,344
I'm talking about
business at a very high level.

140
00:07:33,378 --> 00:07:35,947
Do you consider Cleopatra
a prostitute?

141
00:07:35,981 --> 00:07:38,482
Where do you get this stuff?

142
00:07:38,517 --> 00:07:40,751
She was a queen.

143
00:07:40,786 --> 00:07:43,386
What would it take
to make you a queen?

144
00:07:44,588 --> 00:07:46,857
I don't think
you could afford it.

145
00:07:56,167 --> 00:07:59,035
This was an act of desperation.

146
00:07:59,069 --> 00:08:01,270
I hope I haven't insulted you.

147
00:08:01,305 --> 00:08:03,372
That's all that matters to me.

148
00:08:03,406 --> 00:08:06,042
I understand.

149
00:08:09,713 --> 00:08:11,413
Scarlett, we're ready.

150
00:08:11,448 --> 00:08:13,316
Now, we can't get Ginsberg
out for the call,

151
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:16,084
we want you to pretend
you're his junior.

152
00:08:16,118 --> 00:08:18,854
- Partner?
- Supervisor.

153
00:08:18,888 --> 00:08:22,357
<i>I have Mr. Rick Swanson from
Chevalier Blanc Cologne on speaker.</i>

154
00:08:25,094 --> 00:08:26,694
Hi, Rick.
It's Kenny.

155
00:08:26,729 --> 00:08:30,030
I'm here on a speaker with
Harry Crane and Peggy Olson,

156
00:08:30,065 --> 00:08:32,132
Mr. Ginsberg's
supervisor,

157
00:08:32,167 --> 00:08:34,668
and we want to know
why you want to pull the ad.

158
00:08:34,702 --> 00:08:36,403
- <i>Hello, everyone.</i>
- Hi, Rick.

159
00:08:36,437 --> 00:08:38,973
- Hello.
- <i>We're very happy with the work,</i>

160
00:08:39,007 --> 00:08:41,342
<i>but sales have leveled</i>
<i>off since the holidays.</i>

161
00:08:41,376 --> 00:08:44,912
It's Harry. And you know
Valentine's day is coming up.

162
00:08:44,946 --> 00:08:46,846
A girl can't get a guy flowers.

163
00:08:46,881 --> 00:08:49,949
<i>Why would a woman buy a man
anything for Valentine's day?</i>

164
00:08:52,119 --> 00:08:54,520
Rick, it's Peggy.

165
00:08:54,554 --> 00:08:57,857
I think you're right.
The target of "A Hard Day's Night" was men,

166
00:08:57,858 --> 00:09:00,059
but we can easily change that.

167
00:09:00,094 --> 00:09:01,928
<i>How do you do that?</i>

168
00:09:07,066 --> 00:09:08,434
<i>Hello?</i>

169
00:09:08,468 --> 00:09:11,470
What if it's our
leather jacket hero

170
00:09:11,505 --> 00:09:13,939
running down the street
being chased by screaming girls

171
00:09:13,973 --> 00:09:16,041
and, instead of jumping
into a bar,

172
00:09:16,075 --> 00:09:19,277
he comes upon Lady Godiva
on a horse

173
00:09:19,311 --> 00:09:22,480
as naked as we are
allowed to make her?

174
00:09:22,515 --> 00:09:26,384
And he stops short,
but she leans down

175
00:09:26,419 --> 00:09:28,486
and picks him up
and puts him on the horse

176
00:09:28,521 --> 00:09:30,889
and rides away with him.

177
00:09:32,591 --> 00:09:34,258
<i>What's the tagline?</i>

178
00:09:34,293 --> 00:09:38,529
It's something about
how, you know,

179
00:09:38,563 --> 00:09:42,566
the right woman
loves Chevalier Blanc.

180
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:46,804
<i>So it's exactly the same</i>
<i>except for the ending?</i>

181
00:09:46,838 --> 00:09:49,606
And maybe Paris
instead of London.

182
00:09:49,641 --> 00:09:52,842
<i>Ooh-la-la.</i>
<i>A French song.</i>

183
00:09:59,282 --> 00:10:00,616
Close the door, please.

184
00:10:05,422 --> 00:10:08,256
Herb Rennet has demanded
to spend a night with Joan.

185
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:10,459
And I don't mean
dinner and dancing.

186
00:10:13,429 --> 00:10:15,997
He just came right out
and said that?

187
00:10:16,031 --> 00:10:17,198
Who is he?

188
00:10:17,232 --> 00:10:19,033
He's the head of
the dealers association.

189
00:10:19,068 --> 00:10:20,768
And I hope you told him
to take a long walk.

190
00:10:20,802 --> 00:10:22,636
There's three votes.
We only need two.

191
00:10:22,671 --> 00:10:24,705
I thought about that.

192
00:10:24,739 --> 00:10:27,375
But all he has to do is say he
can't sell cars with our campaign

193
00:10:27,409 --> 00:10:30,411
and neither marketing
nor the factory will fight him.

194
00:10:30,446 --> 00:10:33,613
- So?
- So I brought up the subject with Joan.

195
00:10:33,647 --> 00:10:36,149
- You what?
- Now, relax.

196
00:10:36,184 --> 00:10:38,885
She seemed more amused than
shocked.

197
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:41,088
And it's my opinion, if we
brought her the right amount...

198
00:10:41,122 --> 00:10:43,857
So you thought you'd have us in here
for coffee and talk about this?

199
00:10:43,891 --> 00:10:45,859
What's the problem
if she's amenable?

200
00:10:45,893 --> 00:10:47,360
She said she'd do it?

201
00:10:47,394 --> 00:10:49,761
She said we couldn't afford it.

202
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,369
She has a husband in Vietnam
and a baby at home.

203
00:10:56,403 --> 00:10:59,005
And the work will be good
enough to win on its own.

204
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:01,573
- Plus, it's not a guarantee.
- No, it's not.

205
00:11:01,608 --> 00:11:04,609
It's a guarantee
we won't get it if we don't.

206
00:11:04,643 --> 00:11:06,644
You have some nerve
to even ask her.

207
00:11:06,678 --> 00:11:09,180
That's right.
And you should be thanking me

208
00:11:09,215 --> 00:11:11,082
because we've come too far
and are too close

209
00:11:11,117 --> 00:11:13,718
to turning this place
into what it should be.

210
00:11:13,752 --> 00:11:16,021
Now we're going to walk away?

211
00:11:16,055 --> 00:11:17,722
Over what?

212
00:11:17,756 --> 00:11:21,291
He's one guy and we can win it without him.
End of discussion.

213
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:28,365
Speaking of one guy,
how does everyone else feel?

214
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,435
I'd love to approach
her with, say,

215
00:11:31,469 --> 00:11:34,138
a 10% finders fee on
the first year's commission.

216
00:11:34,172 --> 00:11:36,372
That's $50,000.
A flattering amount

217
00:11:36,407 --> 00:11:37,841
which begs no negotiation.

218
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:42,546
I'm not going to stand in the way,
but I am not paying for it.

219
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,881
Not even with
our Christmas bonuses?

220
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:48,585
Maybe Jaguar
wasn't meant to be, hmm?

221
00:11:48,619 --> 00:11:52,320
I say we take our
bonuses and move on.

222
00:11:52,355 --> 00:11:54,924
This is a car.
You cannot put a dollar figure

223
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:56,692
on its significance.

224
00:11:56,726 --> 00:11:58,761
Extend our credit line.

225
00:11:58,795 --> 00:12:01,030
Say it's for Jaguar.

226
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:10,004
Well, why don't I...

227
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:13,107
Look into it to see
what we can afford

228
00:12:13,141 --> 00:12:15,443
so you may approach her
in the morning

229
00:12:15,477 --> 00:12:18,112
with something definitive?

230
00:12:19,782 --> 00:12:23,317
So, we're 75% of this company.

231
00:12:23,351 --> 00:12:25,919
There's no need to create a conspiracy
by having a vote, is there?

232
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,639
Don't fool yourself. This is
some very dirty business.

233
00:12:31,059 --> 00:12:34,027
Let her know
she can still say no.

234
00:12:52,059 --> 00:12:54,860
You know what?
We're not doing this mistress thing.

235
00:12:54,894 --> 00:12:56,862
It's vulgar.
We're going back to racing heritage.

236
00:12:56,896 --> 00:12:59,398
- Why?
- People that writers horse around

237
00:12:59,433 --> 00:13:00,933
because they're coming up
with ideas.

238
00:13:00,967 --> 00:13:02,468
But, actually, it's because
they're horsing around.

239
00:13:02,502 --> 00:13:04,637
Now knock off the grab-ass
and give me some lines.

240
00:13:04,671 --> 00:13:07,306
And don't try to reuse these.
They do not apply.

241
00:13:14,547 --> 00:13:16,180
Hey, skipper.
You got five seconds?

242
00:13:16,215 --> 00:13:19,116
Five seconds is not
enough time to sit down.

243
00:13:19,151 --> 00:13:22,354
Good news. Chevalier Blanc
wants to do a pool-out.

244
00:13:22,388 --> 00:13:25,022
- Great.
- Peggy was incredible.

245
00:13:25,057 --> 00:13:27,391
She came up with this
Lady Godiva bit on the spot.

246
00:13:27,425 --> 00:13:30,494
But in the end, we're doing the
same ad as before, but in Paris.

247
00:13:30,528 --> 00:13:32,629
The guy has a Beret.

248
00:13:32,664 --> 00:13:35,632
Bid it out.
Ginsberg should be free by then.

249
00:13:35,667 --> 00:13:36,834
Be nice to get him here.

250
00:13:36,868 --> 00:13:39,436
Ginsberg?
I thought of this.

251
00:13:39,471 --> 00:13:42,739
- It's his account. - So I guess
I'm not in charge of everything.

252
00:13:42,773 --> 00:13:45,375
Jesus, Peggy, you know what?

253
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:48,678
You want to go to Paris?
Here.

254
00:13:48,712 --> 00:13:50,012
Go to Paris.

255
00:14:10,966 --> 00:14:14,535
- I'm not crying.
- I didn't think that.

256
00:14:14,569 --> 00:14:18,372
What, we're all suddenly
interested in each other's lives?

257
00:14:18,407 --> 00:14:21,174
I know for a fact that
Jaguar's not going to happen.

258
00:14:21,209 --> 00:14:22,743
And he probably does, too.

259
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:25,613
- I don't care.
- I'll get you to Paris.

260
00:14:25,647 --> 00:14:28,348
And if I don't,
we'll both get out of here.

261
00:14:28,383 --> 00:14:30,884
You and your stupid pact.

262
00:14:30,918 --> 00:14:34,387
Save the fiction
for your stories.

263
00:14:44,832 --> 00:14:46,932
What can I do for you?

264
00:14:46,966 --> 00:14:48,133
May I?

265
00:14:56,108 --> 00:14:58,677
Signing Jaguar
would be disastrous

266
00:14:58,711 --> 00:15:00,512
for the financial health
of this company.

267
00:15:00,547 --> 00:15:03,848
You have to stop being afraid.

268
00:15:03,882 --> 00:15:07,351
It would be a defining
moment for our business.

269
00:15:08,821 --> 00:15:11,789
We don't want it that badly.

270
00:15:13,091 --> 00:15:15,793
- All right, get out.
- It bears discussion.

271
00:15:15,828 --> 00:15:19,128
I don't know what you're talking about.
Now get out.

272
00:15:19,163 --> 00:15:21,498
Well, I'm sorry that
there was a discussion.

273
00:15:21,532 --> 00:15:26,002
But when a company is
planning on spending $50,000,

274
00:15:26,036 --> 00:15:28,338
there needs to be a discussion.

275
00:15:28,372 --> 00:15:30,507
You were all in there
talking about it?

276
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:33,109
Why does it matter if you
have no intention of action?

277
00:15:33,143 --> 00:15:36,144
I don't want them
to know I was asked.

278
00:15:37,714 --> 00:15:40,883
Roger Sterling participated
in this discussion?

279
00:15:40,917 --> 00:15:43,352
Yes.

280
00:15:43,386 --> 00:15:45,220
He's a partner.

281
00:15:45,254 --> 00:15:48,256
If you're against it, why did
you tell me that number?

282
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:50,158
Sounds like a joke.

283
00:15:50,193 --> 00:15:54,696
Because that may be enough
money to turn your head,

284
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:57,899
and I wanted a chance
to discourage you.

285
00:15:57,933 --> 00:16:00,368
It is a lot of money, Lane.

286
00:16:00,402 --> 00:16:02,670
It's four times
what I make in a year.

287
00:16:02,705 --> 00:16:05,473
I suppose you wouldn't
even be tempted.

288
00:16:05,508 --> 00:16:09,342
Well, if I were,

289
00:16:09,377 --> 00:16:12,445
I would try to avoid
the mistake

290
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,715
that I've made my entire life.

291
00:16:14,749 --> 00:16:17,417
Every time someone's
asked me what I wanted,

292
00:16:17,451 --> 00:16:22,322
- I've never told them the truth.
- And what would you want?

293
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,657
Three years ago

294
00:16:24,691 --> 00:16:29,361
when I was essential
to the future of this firm,

295
00:16:29,396 --> 00:16:33,699
I settled for much less
than I needed.

296
00:16:33,734 --> 00:16:37,537
The cash would only
cripple the company

297
00:16:37,571 --> 00:16:40,339
and would do very little
to change your future.

298
00:16:40,373 --> 00:16:43,475
But a partnership

299
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:47,579
yielding a 5% stake
in the company itself...

300
00:16:49,015 --> 00:16:51,716
Could take care
of a woman and a child

301
00:16:51,751 --> 00:16:53,585
for a lifetime.

302
00:16:54,987 --> 00:16:56,922
Here I thought
you were trying to stop this

303
00:16:56,956 --> 00:16:59,357
because you have
feelings for me.

304
00:17:00,926 --> 00:17:03,527
That's why I'm looking
out for your interests

305
00:17:03,562 --> 00:17:05,162
over the company's.

306
00:17:21,278 --> 00:17:23,345
"Good night, nobody.

307
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,548
Good night, Mush.

308
00:17:28,652 --> 00:17:31,020
And good night to the old lady

309
00:17:31,055 --> 00:17:33,521
whispering 'hush.'"

310
00:17:39,161 --> 00:17:41,396
Hey.

311
00:17:51,974 --> 00:17:53,273
How's it going?

312
00:17:53,308 --> 00:17:55,810
You want to help us out?
Throw some taglines at the wall?

313
00:17:55,844 --> 00:17:58,412
How about, "Jaguar,

314
00:17:58,446 --> 00:18:00,280
it's your problem,
not mine."

315
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:04,531
May I speak with you?

316
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:10,991
So that's Megan.

317
00:18:11,025 --> 00:18:13,059
Be careful what you say.
We're best friends.

318
00:18:15,696 --> 00:18:17,964
So you're wearing
your audition dress.

319
00:18:17,999 --> 00:18:20,333
What are you hoping
I can do for you?

320
00:18:20,367 --> 00:18:23,135
You noticed.

321
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:32,711
I've only bad associations with
letting you leave the house in that.

322
00:18:32,746 --> 00:18:35,447
There's probably 20 girls.

323
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:37,515
And Julia's coming with me.

324
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:40,451
Plus, he's a fairy.

325
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:53,864
So whatever this is,
it's not for me.

326
00:18:53,898 --> 00:18:56,033
I want to walk in
there with confidence.

327
00:19:13,383 --> 00:19:17,219
I could be in a bikini and you
could paint my body with spots.

328
00:19:17,253 --> 00:19:19,321
Jaguar, try to tame it.

329
00:19:19,355 --> 00:19:22,324
- Don't try and tame it.
- Here, kitty, kitty.

330
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:27,395
So she just comes and goes
as she pleases, huh?

331
00:19:27,429 --> 00:19:29,430
Ginsberg.
What?

332
00:19:29,464 --> 00:19:31,166
Yeah, I got it.

333
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:47,598
You can unplug that
if you want.

334
00:19:47,632 --> 00:19:50,367
Aren't I interrupting
your routine without me?

335
00:19:50,401 --> 00:19:51,967
Don't be cranky.

336
00:19:52,001 --> 00:19:56,205
I was in a great mood when I left work.

337
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,841
Now I'm just exhausted.

338
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:00,776
So let's go to bed.

339
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:03,646
If and when we get Jaguar,

340
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,715
I'm going to need
an apartment in the city.

341
00:20:05,749 --> 00:20:07,449
Absolutely not.

342
00:20:07,483 --> 00:20:10,485
It's an epic poem
for me to get home.

343
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:12,887
And you're dressed
for bed at dinner.

344
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:14,856
Peter.

345
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:16,924
Let's stop playing games.

346
00:20:16,959 --> 00:20:18,460
What are you talking about?

347
00:20:18,494 --> 00:20:20,128
I'm tired of competing.

348
00:20:20,162 --> 00:20:22,096
Your love affair
with Manhattan is over.

349
00:20:22,131 --> 00:20:25,932
Well, how can you stand living
out here in this cemetery?

350
00:20:25,967 --> 00:20:28,902
There's nothing to do.
There's no good night noises anywhere.

351
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:31,672
Because I want to raise
my child in the fresh air.

352
00:20:31,706 --> 00:20:33,407
And we should
have another on the way.

353
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:35,676
I mean, it was a miracle the first
time and we're not even trying.

354
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:38,579
I'm using all my energy
putting my foot down.

355
00:20:50,157 --> 00:20:51,991
It's 8:00.
Where were you?

356
00:20:52,025 --> 00:20:54,727
What's that smell?

357
00:20:54,762 --> 00:20:56,728
The refrigerator
is on the fritz.

358
00:20:56,763 --> 00:20:59,531
- I had to take everything out.
- Did you call someone?

359
00:20:59,565 --> 00:21:01,833
His wife won't let him
come here anymore.

360
00:21:01,867 --> 00:21:03,735
I don't want to talk
about that.

361
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:07,105
We can afford to have someone else fix
the refrigerator, for God's sake.

362
00:21:07,139 --> 00:21:09,007
Why won't anyone believe me?

363
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:11,142
Apolo and I are just friends.

364
00:21:11,177 --> 00:21:13,311
- Ahem.
- <i>You know what?</i>

365
00:21:13,345 --> 00:21:16,280
Just hire someone.
Get a colored girl in here.

366
00:21:16,315 --> 00:21:18,482
They're used to
being bossed around.

367
00:21:19,984 --> 00:21:21,952
Do whatever you want.

368
00:21:21,986 --> 00:21:25,523
And what are you doing?
Drying up inside?

369
00:21:25,557 --> 00:21:29,125
Because of what?
Greg? I hate him.

370
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:31,928
I don't want you talking
that way around Kevin.

371
00:21:31,962 --> 00:21:35,231
He's a baby. He doesn't know that
we all wish his father was dead.

372
00:21:36,834 --> 00:21:39,536
Please, stop.

373
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:42,271
Have you been drinking?

374
00:21:42,306 --> 00:21:44,139
Yes.

375
00:21:44,173 --> 00:21:46,442
Sit down.

376
00:21:56,853 --> 00:22:00,087
"Little Murders" called.
Four of us got callbacks.

377
00:22:00,121 --> 00:22:01,723
I'm supposed to go meet
the playwright tomorrow.

378
00:22:01,757 --> 00:22:04,058
That's fantastic.

379
00:22:05,561 --> 00:22:08,162
- That's a big deal.
- I know.

380
00:22:08,196 --> 00:22:10,698
You have to promise you'll
come visit every weekend.

381
00:22:10,733 --> 00:22:12,667
You're going to
Broadway, not jail.

382
00:22:12,701 --> 00:22:15,302
No, rehearsal starts
in Boston in 10 days.

383
00:22:15,337 --> 00:22:18,872
- Oh, forget it. I'm getting
ahead of myself. - Boston?

384
00:22:18,906 --> 00:22:22,743
Yeah, I think there's eight weeks
of rehearsals plus previews.

385
00:22:25,179 --> 00:22:27,647
So you're just gonna leave
for three months?

386
00:22:27,682 --> 00:22:30,250
- If they want me.
- Well, forget it.

387
00:22:32,186 --> 00:22:34,153
What do you think this is?

388
00:22:34,188 --> 00:22:37,957
You think I'm gonna be
a singing waitress.

389
00:22:37,992 --> 00:22:39,992
Maybe put on a show
in the laundry room?

390
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:41,793
I have to go to work.

391
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:45,063
You never thought about it because
you didn't expect me to make it.

392
00:22:46,966 --> 00:22:48,500
This is the way it works.
Now you know.

393
00:22:51,104 --> 00:22:53,838
Just keep doing whatever
the hell you want.

394
00:22:58,911 --> 00:23:01,145
Please, come in.

395
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:08,152
You didn't have to make
an appointment, you know.

396
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:10,421
Yes, I did.

397
00:23:11,722 --> 00:23:13,456
Tell them I want a partnership,

398
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:15,158
not silent,

399
00:23:15,192 --> 00:23:17,727
comprising 5% of the business.

400
00:23:19,297 --> 00:23:22,032
- Well...
- There's no negotiation.

401
00:23:24,902 --> 00:23:26,702
Okay.

402
00:23:26,737 --> 00:23:29,471
I want documents
by the end of the day.

403
00:23:29,505 --> 00:23:31,540
I don't know
if that's possible.

404
00:23:31,574 --> 00:23:33,809
Well, I'm not
guaranteeing results.

405
00:23:33,843 --> 00:23:36,912
I don't think he'll have trouble performing.
He's quite ardent.

406
00:23:36,947 --> 00:23:39,014
I meant winning the business.

407
00:23:39,049 --> 00:23:41,883
Yes, of course.

408
00:23:41,918 --> 00:23:44,819
So, I have instructions, but
I don't know how this works

409
00:23:44,853 --> 00:23:46,620
in a practical sense.

410
00:23:46,655 --> 00:23:48,823
The presentation's
tomorrow, isn't it?

411
00:23:48,857 --> 00:23:51,592
So I just call him

412
00:23:51,626 --> 00:23:53,594
and have him call you?

413
00:23:53,628 --> 00:23:55,830
Probably not.

414
00:23:57,032 --> 00:23:58,532
Well, how do I--

415
00:23:58,567 --> 00:24:00,200
Figure something out.

416
00:24:00,234 --> 00:24:02,069
Do I have to do all of it?

417
00:24:14,482 --> 00:24:16,282
Which one is he?

418
00:24:16,316 --> 00:24:18,284
He's not bad.

419
00:24:18,318 --> 00:24:21,354
He's doing this.

420
00:24:25,626 --> 00:24:27,760
Come in.

421
00:24:27,795 --> 00:24:30,196
I know I'm not a manager,
but it's very hard

422
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:32,464
to get things done
with you in another room.

423
00:24:32,499 --> 00:24:34,867
Well, I obviously have
the opposite feeling.

424
00:24:34,868 --> 00:24:37,068
Permission to speak freely?

425
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:38,904
What?

426
00:24:38,938 --> 00:24:41,840
I know you forbid us from
thinking about the mistress,

427
00:24:41,875 --> 00:24:44,743
but I kept imagining the asshole
who's gonna want this car.

428
00:24:44,777 --> 00:24:46,912
Now he's probably already
got a lot beautiful things.

429
00:24:46,946 --> 00:24:49,279
Or maybe he thinks the car
will help him get them.

430
00:24:49,314 --> 00:24:51,181
So I can go on?

431
00:24:52,784 --> 00:24:57,187
And one way or another,
what he has isn't enough.

432
00:24:57,222 --> 00:25:00,457
So no matter what,
the first idea has got to be

433
00:25:00,492 --> 00:25:04,360
finally, like, you're
getting what you wanted.

434
00:25:04,395 --> 00:25:07,631
The copy is still describing
the car as another woman.

435
00:25:07,665 --> 00:25:10,233
But a woman you can't have,

436
00:25:10,267 --> 00:25:13,336
because they have all
the qualities of a Jaguar--

437
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:15,906
Good-looking,
expensive, fast,

438
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:18,675
and, frankly, not practical.

439
00:25:18,709 --> 00:25:20,876
I've always been fine
with all that.

440
00:25:20,911 --> 00:25:22,511
But what's the line?

441
00:25:24,414 --> 00:25:27,282
"Jaguar, at last,

442
00:25:27,316 --> 00:25:30,586
something beautiful
you can truly own."

443
00:25:39,562 --> 00:25:42,664
So he threw the money
in your face?

444
00:25:42,698 --> 00:25:45,400
I don't even want
to talk about it.

445
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:49,604
I've never had
more responsibility.

446
00:25:49,638 --> 00:25:51,573
I'm on everything but Jaguar.

447
00:25:51,607 --> 00:25:53,941
I worked on Plymouth
at NW Ayer.

448
00:25:53,975 --> 00:25:56,377
Car guys are a bunch of creeps.

449
00:25:56,411 --> 00:25:58,546
They're all a bunch of creeps.

450
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:02,849
Could I get some more coffee?

451
00:26:02,884 --> 00:26:04,552
I can never tell, ballerina,

452
00:26:04,586 --> 00:26:07,054
if you're ambitious
or you just like to complain.

453
00:26:07,089 --> 00:26:08,955
Why can't it be both?

454
00:26:10,124 --> 00:26:13,126
Well, if this was about
work and not feelings,

455
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,328
you'd make a move.

456
00:26:15,362 --> 00:26:16,929
You're right.

457
00:26:16,964 --> 00:26:21,634
I could take a couple of meetings and get
an offer and throw that at Don's face.

458
00:26:21,668 --> 00:26:24,237
Or you can do
what everybody else does--

459
00:26:24,271 --> 00:26:27,573
Have a bunch of meetings,
pick a place and leave.

460
00:26:27,608 --> 00:26:29,541
Don't think I haven't
thought about it.

461
00:26:29,576 --> 00:26:32,979
Well, you'd get to find out

462
00:26:33,013 --> 00:26:36,682
if you could shine elsewhere.
And I know you can.

463
00:26:36,717 --> 00:26:40,185
And you'd let him know that
you're not some secretary

464
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:42,854
from Brooklyn who's
dying to help out.

465
00:26:47,259 --> 00:26:49,327
I don't know if I can do that.

466
00:26:49,361 --> 00:26:50,962
Sure you could.

467
00:26:50,997 --> 00:26:52,964
You could hire a headhunter

468
00:26:52,999 --> 00:26:56,634
or you could buy
a friend a piece of pie.

469
00:26:59,971 --> 00:27:02,640
Of course, if you do move,
you can't complain

470
00:27:02,674 --> 00:27:04,942
if I gave Draper a call
on my own behalf.

471
00:27:04,976 --> 00:27:06,777
What if Don finds out
you helped me?

472
00:27:06,811 --> 00:27:08,812
Don's a big boy.

473
00:27:08,847 --> 00:27:10,814
If he was having this
conversation with you

474
00:27:10,849 --> 00:27:12,549
and he wasn't
the subject of it,

475
00:27:12,583 --> 00:27:14,851
he'd tell you
to leave in a second.

476
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:27,119
I've seen the campaign and it's
something I couldn't have imagined,

477
00:27:27,153 --> 00:27:29,188
yet exactly what I expected.

478
00:27:29,222 --> 00:27:30,822
Thank you.

479
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:32,691
And I want you to present
in the fullest confidence.

480
00:27:32,725 --> 00:27:34,892
I think it's a winner.

481
00:27:34,926 --> 00:27:38,029
Well, all I wanted to say

482
00:27:38,063 --> 00:27:40,631
was we've removed
all other impediments.

483
00:27:40,665 --> 00:27:43,001
But you do know
no matter what else goes on,

484
00:27:43,035 --> 00:27:45,703
it's the creative
that's going to win this.

485
00:27:47,906 --> 00:27:49,306
Close the door.

486
00:27:50,841 --> 00:27:52,842
It was four to zero.

487
00:27:52,877 --> 00:27:55,445
You abstained in absentia.

488
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:58,681
The conversation doesn't end
just because you leave the room.

489
00:27:58,716 --> 00:27:59,782
What did you promise her?

490
00:27:59,817 --> 00:28:02,452
A 5% stake as a voting partner.

491
00:28:02,487 --> 00:28:05,054
Dawn, can you
buzz Mrs. Harris?

492
00:28:05,088 --> 00:28:06,855
She's not here.

493
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:09,992
Actually, Dawn,
could you get my things?

494
00:28:11,561 --> 00:28:14,696
Yes, you should be well rested.

495
00:28:16,133 --> 00:28:18,034
I don't want it like this.

496
00:28:18,068 --> 00:28:20,802
It was her idea.

497
00:28:26,775 --> 00:28:28,176
Hello.

498
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:29,677
Hello.
I'm Don Draper.

499
00:28:29,711 --> 00:28:31,312
I work with Joan.
Is she in?

500
00:28:31,347 --> 00:28:34,082
Yes, of course.
Please come in.

501
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,088
<i>What?</i>

502
00:28:49,263 --> 00:28:51,230
She'll be right with you.

503
00:28:51,265 --> 00:28:54,034
- I should take your coat.
- I won't be long.

504
00:28:58,138 --> 00:29:00,906
Well, I will leave
you two alone.

505
00:29:04,811 --> 00:29:07,479
I'm really sorry to bother
you if this is a bad time.

506
00:29:07,513 --> 00:29:09,448
Well, I was just stepping
into the shower,

507
00:29:09,482 --> 00:29:10,950
but how can I help you?

508
00:29:10,984 --> 00:29:13,619
I wanted to tell you
it's not worth it.

509
00:29:14,955 --> 00:29:17,556
And if we don't get
Jaguar, so what?

510
00:29:18,891 --> 00:29:21,093
Who wants to be in business
with people like that?

511
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:30,268
I was told
everyone was on board.

512
00:29:30,303 --> 00:29:34,171
I said no and they voted
when I left the room.

513
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:39,643
You're a good one, aren't you?

514
00:29:39,677 --> 00:29:41,645
So you understand
what I'm saying?

515
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:45,516
Yes, I do.

516
00:29:47,351 --> 00:29:49,252
I'm all right.

517
00:29:49,286 --> 00:29:51,821
And thank you.

518
00:29:51,855 --> 00:29:55,125
So you have a nice night.
And I'm gonna go prepare.

519
00:30:05,868 --> 00:30:08,570
- Say good night to your friend.
- Good luck tomorrow.

520
00:30:27,722 --> 00:30:31,759
<i>You must get tired of hearing
what a beautiful thing this car is.</i>

521
00:30:31,793 --> 00:30:34,061
But I've met a lot
of beautiful women in my life.

522
00:30:34,095 --> 00:30:36,730
And despite
their protestations,

523
00:30:36,765 --> 00:30:38,699
they never tire of hearing it.

524
00:30:40,135 --> 00:30:43,336
But when deep beauty
is encountered,

525
00:30:43,371 --> 00:30:46,606
it arouses deep emotions

526
00:30:46,641 --> 00:30:50,010
because it creates a desire,

527
00:30:50,045 --> 00:30:53,179
<i>because it is, by nature,</i>
<i>unattainable.</i>

528
00:30:53,213 --> 00:30:55,214
You look radiant, Joan.

529
00:30:55,248 --> 00:30:57,884
May I call you Joan?
I'm Herb, by the way.

530
00:30:57,918 --> 00:31:00,553
Well, I should hope so.

531
00:31:00,587 --> 00:31:04,090
We're taught to think that
function is all that matters.

532
00:31:04,124 --> 00:31:07,126
But we have a natural longing

533
00:31:07,161 --> 00:31:09,327
for this other thing.

534
00:31:09,361 --> 00:31:12,630
Oh, I got you
a little something.

535
00:31:19,672 --> 00:31:21,506
I thought a woman
with your complexion

536
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:23,441
would look good in emerald.

537
00:31:23,475 --> 00:31:25,776
When I was driving
the e-type,

538
00:31:25,811 --> 00:31:28,045
I passed a 10-year-old boy in the
back window of a station wagon

539
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,014
and I watched his eyes follow.

540
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:32,449
He'd just seen something
he would want

541
00:31:32,483 --> 00:31:34,719
for the rest of his life.

542
00:31:34,753 --> 00:31:37,487
I feel like a sultan of Araby

543
00:31:37,522 --> 00:31:41,191
and my tent is graced
with Helen of Troy.

544
00:31:41,225 --> 00:31:43,727
Those are two
different stories.

545
00:31:43,761 --> 00:31:45,962
<i>He'd just seen that
unattainable object</i>

546
00:31:45,996 --> 00:31:48,098
speed by just out of reach.

547
00:31:48,132 --> 00:31:50,967
Because they do that,
don't they?

548
00:31:51,001 --> 00:31:53,103
<i>Beautiful things.</i>

549
00:31:55,106 --> 00:31:58,640
You know, I don't know how much
longer I can restrain myself.

550
00:31:58,674 --> 00:32:23,664
Let me see 'em.

551
00:32:23,698 --> 00:32:27,235
Then I thought about a man of some
means reading "Playboy" or "Esquire"

552
00:32:27,269 --> 00:32:29,335
and flipping past the flesh

553
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:33,740
to the shiny painted curves
of this car.

554
00:32:33,775 --> 00:32:36,342
There was no effort
to stop his eye.

555
00:32:36,377 --> 00:32:40,847
The difference is
he can have a Jaguar.

556
00:32:43,785 --> 00:32:46,352
Well, thank you
for a wonderful time.

557
00:32:47,921 --> 00:32:49,756
You're a hell of a gal.

558
00:32:51,992 --> 00:32:53,926
<i>Oh, this car,</i>

559
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,496
this thing, gentlemen,

560
00:32:56,530 --> 00:32:59,465
what price would we pay?

561
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:03,067
What behavior would we forgive?

562
00:33:03,102 --> 00:33:06,672
If they weren't pretty,
if they weren't temperamental,

563
00:33:06,706 --> 00:33:08,340
if they weren't
beyond our reach

564
00:33:08,374 --> 00:33:10,342
and a little
out of our control,

565
00:33:10,376 --> 00:33:12,143
would we love them like we do?

566
00:33:14,647 --> 00:33:16,880
"Jaguar,

567
00:33:16,915 --> 00:33:21,419
at last something beautiful
you can truly own."

568
00:33:34,699 --> 00:33:36,833
What?

569
00:33:36,867 --> 00:33:39,302
Mr. Draper is here
to see you.

570
00:33:39,337 --> 00:33:41,304
Why'd you tell him I was here?

571
00:33:41,339 --> 00:33:44,106
He's your boss.
You should see him.

572
00:33:58,355 --> 00:34:01,156
Well, I will leave
you two alone.

573
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:07,795
I'm really sorry to bother
you if this is a bad time.

574
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:09,930
Well, I was just stepping
into the shower,

575
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:11,265
but how can I help you?

576
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:14,301
I wanted to tell you
it's not worth it.

577
00:34:14,336 --> 00:34:17,338
And if we don't get
Jaguar, so what?

578
00:34:17,373 --> 00:34:20,174
Who wants to be in business
with people like that?

579
00:34:27,749 --> 00:34:28,948
How'd it go?

580
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:31,518
We'll see.

581
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:33,487
It was one of his good ones.

582
00:34:34,922 --> 00:34:38,323
- Come have a drink?
- Maybe later.

583
00:34:54,204 --> 00:34:57,106
- Where are you from?
- New York.

584
00:35:00,076 --> 00:35:02,911
<i>Turn around, please.</i>

585
00:35:02,946 --> 00:35:06,149
Could you step forward, sweetheart,
and turn around, please?

586
00:35:20,463 --> 00:35:22,230
You know, I would have
taken you anywhere.

587
00:35:22,265 --> 00:35:24,867
Well, no one comes in here.
The food's too bad.

588
00:35:24,901 --> 00:35:27,301
We're not actually gonna
eat here, are we?

589
00:35:27,335 --> 00:35:28,803
I'm not hungry.

590
00:35:28,837 --> 00:35:30,905
Freddy Rums says you are.

591
00:35:30,939 --> 00:35:32,774
And so does Tom Vogel.

592
00:35:32,808 --> 00:35:34,408
You know we have Clearasil.

593
00:35:34,442 --> 00:35:37,078
In fact, he sung your praises

594
00:35:37,112 --> 00:35:39,781
while he was yelling at me that
the work wasn't as good anymore.

595
00:35:39,815 --> 00:35:43,122
That was my first account.

596
00:35:43,955 --> 00:35:47,054
Everybody else is gonna
wanna know if you're married

597
00:35:46,087 --> 00:35:47,888
or planning on having a baby.

598
00:35:47,922 --> 00:35:50,624
And then they're gonna want to
know how much you want to be paid.

599
00:35:50,659 --> 00:35:53,060
But all I want to know is,

600
00:35:53,094 --> 00:35:56,197
you must have heard
some pretty terrible things

601
00:35:56,231 --> 00:35:57,998
about me
from Don Draper's mouth.

602
00:35:58,032 --> 00:36:00,667
But why would you want
to play for the other team?

603
00:36:00,701 --> 00:36:03,035
It's not a game.

604
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:05,805
It's my career.

605
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:07,907
Look, I need a writer.

606
00:36:07,941 --> 00:36:10,076
They don't have
to be like me, but...

607
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:12,679
Do you know anything
about Ralph Waldo Emerson?

608
00:36:12,713 --> 00:36:14,746
Uh....

609
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:16,415
From school.

610
00:36:16,449 --> 00:36:20,519
He said that you have to be
a transparent eyeball.

611
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:23,322
What he meant was,
you have to take in the world

612
00:36:23,356 --> 00:36:26,391
and pass it through you.
I am tired of people

613
00:36:26,426 --> 00:36:28,093
who treat this like math.

614
00:36:28,127 --> 00:36:31,562
I looked at your book
and I saw somebody

615
00:36:31,597 --> 00:36:34,732
who was writing like
every product was for them.

616
00:36:34,766 --> 00:36:37,635
No cliches, no homilies,

617
00:36:37,669 --> 00:36:39,837
no formula.

618
00:36:39,871 --> 00:36:42,973
Well, I had a lot of help.

619
00:36:43,007 --> 00:36:45,276
Everybody does.

620
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:47,510
So I lied to you.

621
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:50,580
What do you want to get paid?

622
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:01,524
Freddy told you to do this?

623
00:37:12,402 --> 00:37:15,003
You already know
you want to go.

624
00:37:15,037 --> 00:37:18,273
You know how much
you'll do it for.

625
00:37:18,307 --> 00:37:20,975
And you didn't make me wait.

626
00:37:21,009 --> 00:37:23,645
I'm going do you
the same favor.

627
00:37:32,854 --> 00:37:36,690
- Oh.
- If this is your last meeting.

628
00:37:39,527 --> 00:37:42,362
I think I
need a chocolate shake.

629
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:48,368
First day of work ends with
you and me at La Caravelle.

630
00:37:53,072 --> 00:37:56,074
- You're here.
- I'm here.

631
00:37:59,212 --> 00:38:00,546
How'd it go?

632
00:38:10,523 --> 00:38:12,524
How did yours go?

633
00:38:12,558 --> 00:38:14,693
We're waiting to hear.

634
00:38:14,727 --> 00:38:17,094
I bet you were great.

635
00:38:17,129 --> 00:38:19,897
I bet you were, too.

636
00:38:19,932 --> 00:38:23,467
The difference is
I want you to get it.

637
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:24,702
Stop it.

638
00:38:24,736 --> 00:38:27,003
Well, you get to disappear
for work whenever you want.

639
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:30,907
And if I have to choose
between you and that,

640
00:38:30,942 --> 00:38:34,277
I'll choose you.

641
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:38,315
But I'll hate you for it.

642
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:40,750
You know I don't want
you to fail.

643
00:38:40,784 --> 00:38:42,885
Good.

644
00:38:42,886 --> 00:38:45,087
Because I'm not going to.

645
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:53,863
- Don't run away like that.
- Shh.

646
00:39:05,975 --> 00:39:08,377
Good morning, Mr. Draper.

647
00:39:08,411 --> 00:39:11,311
Miss Olson wants to see you.

648
00:39:11,346 --> 00:39:14,181
Peggy, come on in.

649
00:39:16,951 --> 00:39:19,387
- D'arcy's out.
- Says who?

650
00:39:19,421 --> 00:39:21,455
Arthur's girl told me
on the QT.

651
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:22,956
She said he was in
his office crying.

652
00:39:22,991 --> 00:39:25,626
Jaguar is calling the
president of every agency.

653
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:28,294
- Dancer just got a big "no, thanks."
- D'arcy is out, too.

654
00:39:33,634 --> 00:39:36,569
Get the partners in my office and
wait for further instructions.

655
00:39:41,475 --> 00:39:43,876
Roger Sterling's office.

656
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:46,378
I want all the partners here.

657
00:39:46,413 --> 00:39:47,746
You can't leave him on hold.

658
00:39:47,781 --> 00:39:50,115
Where's Pete?

659
00:39:50,149 --> 00:39:52,484
Just answer it.

660
00:39:57,757 --> 00:39:59,924
<i>Hello?</i>
<i>Hugh, how are you this morning?</i>

661
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:03,895
I'm glad to hear that.
We like him, too.

662
00:40:05,964 --> 00:40:08,766
- Well, that is terrific news.
- Bravo.

663
00:40:08,801 --> 00:40:10,701
- Spectacular.
- Great.

664
00:40:10,736 --> 00:40:13,638
We'll be over this afternoon
to kiss the bride.

665
00:40:15,272 --> 00:40:16,773
He said it wasn't even close.

666
00:40:22,647 --> 00:40:25,849
- Well, congratulations to everyone.
- We got to get champagne.

667
00:40:25,883 --> 00:40:28,284
I promise you they're
opening it right now.

668
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:31,220
Before everybody's too drunk,
I need a list of names.

669
00:40:31,255 --> 00:40:33,990
I promised them we'd staff up immediately
and we're going over there today.

670
00:40:34,024 --> 00:40:37,126
Can't we wait to see what the
scope of the campaign will be?

671
00:40:37,161 --> 00:40:39,895
Is this about
the bonuses again?

672
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:42,665
There are no bonuses this year.

673
00:40:42,699 --> 00:40:44,300
Now, next year

674
00:40:49,105 --> 00:40:51,639
Joan, shall we address the men?

675
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,863
- Congratulations.
- You wanted to talk to me?

676
00:41:15,897 --> 00:41:18,032
You're not busy?

677
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:21,468
I'm not in the mood.

678
00:41:21,502 --> 00:41:24,337
You really have no idea
when things are good, do you?

679
00:41:38,618 --> 00:41:41,120
I swear, I don't really
need to talk right now.

680
00:41:41,154 --> 00:41:42,521
Drink with me.

681
00:41:47,727 --> 00:41:50,362
I have to talk about
something kind of serious.

682
00:41:52,731 --> 00:41:56,100
I can't put a girl on Jaguar.

683
00:41:56,135 --> 00:41:58,503
These car guys...

684
00:41:58,537 --> 00:42:00,938
I just can't.

685
00:42:00,972 --> 00:42:03,107
- But, you know--
- It's not that.

686
00:42:03,142 --> 00:42:05,343
Is this about Joan
being made partner?

687
00:42:05,377 --> 00:42:07,245
What?

688
00:42:07,279 --> 00:42:09,980
The circumstances...

689
00:42:10,015 --> 00:42:12,616
She's been with us 13 years.

690
00:42:24,094 --> 00:42:26,563
I want you to know that

691
00:42:26,597 --> 00:42:29,265
the day you saw
something in me...

692
00:42:31,368 --> 00:42:33,335
My whole life changed.

693
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:38,107
And since then,
it's been my privilege

694
00:42:38,141 --> 00:42:40,909
to not only be at your side,

695
00:42:40,944 --> 00:42:44,112
but to be treated
like a protegee

696
00:42:44,146 --> 00:42:46,949
and for you to be my mentor

697
00:42:46,983 --> 00:42:49,317
and my champion.

698
00:42:53,422 --> 00:42:54,756
But?

699
00:42:54,791 --> 00:42:59,961
But... I think
I've reached a point

700
00:42:59,995 --> 00:43:02,830
where it's time for me
to have a new experience.

701
00:43:02,864 --> 00:43:04,531
Really?

702
00:43:04,566 --> 00:43:07,267
I'm giving my notice.

703
00:43:07,302 --> 00:43:09,837
I've accepted another offer.

704
00:43:11,639 --> 00:43:15,341
- Are you done?
- I'm giving the customary two weeks.

705
00:43:15,375 --> 00:43:18,578
My last day will be the third.

706
00:43:18,613 --> 00:43:20,880
- And don't think--
- Hold on.

707
00:43:24,118 --> 00:43:27,487
It's been crazy around here and I know
I've been taking you for granted.

708
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:30,022
And, frankly, I'm impressed.

709
00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:34,526
You finally picked the right
moment to ask for a raise.

710
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,630
It's time for me to move on.

711
00:43:37,664 --> 00:43:39,865
Come on.

712
00:43:39,899 --> 00:43:42,868
I'm serious.

713
00:43:47,372 --> 00:43:49,007
You're serious?

714
00:43:49,041 --> 00:43:51,242
It wasn't easy.

715
00:43:51,276 --> 00:43:52,810
Oh, I'm sure it wasn't.

716
00:43:55,313 --> 00:43:57,281
Well, good for you.
Where are you going?

717
00:43:57,315 --> 00:44:00,184
Cutler Gleason and Chaough.

718
00:44:02,754 --> 00:44:05,989
Perfect.

719
00:44:08,527 --> 00:44:10,827
Okay.

720
00:44:10,862 --> 00:44:14,665
Well, let's pretend
I'm not responsible

721
00:44:14,699 --> 00:44:17,800
for every single good thing
that's ever happened to you,

722
00:44:17,834 --> 00:44:21,504
and you tell me
the number or make one up

723
00:44:21,539 --> 00:44:23,506
and I'll beat it.

724
00:44:23,541 --> 00:44:27,009
- There's no number.
- There's no number?

725
00:44:27,044 --> 00:44:29,078
How long do you
to play this out?

726
00:44:29,112 --> 00:44:31,214
I'm sorry,

727
00:44:31,248 --> 00:44:35,685
but you know this
is what you would do.

728
00:44:39,621 --> 00:44:42,023
You don't need to wait
until the third.

729
00:44:42,058 --> 00:44:44,659
I've got a room full
of freelances out there.

730
00:44:44,694 --> 00:44:47,095
I'll get by.

731
00:44:49,699 --> 00:44:51,966
I understand.

732
00:45:19,292 --> 00:45:21,360
Don't be a stranger.

742
00:47:08,561 --> 00:47:11,607
On the next episode of
AMC's Mad Men...

743
00:47:11,608 --> 00:47:13,265
I don't like what we are doing.

744
00:47:13,266 --> 00:47:14,980
So you're drinking
with a purpose.

745
00:47:14,981 --> 00:47:17,860
I'm sure the others
are more deserving.

746
00:47:18,013 --> 00:47:19,826
Were you celebrating with Don?

747
00:47:19,827 --> 00:47:22,149
Should we be having this
conversation on the phone?

748
00:47:22,316 --> 00:47:24,227
You know, you can't
keep being the good

749
00:47:24,228 --> 00:47:27,084
little boy while the
elders run this business.

750
00:47:27,085 --> 00:47:29,071
We're going to celebrate.

751
00:47:29,072 --> 00:47:30,634
You can't tell anyone.

752
00:47:32,221 --> 00:47:34,635
Only two episodes left
this season.
