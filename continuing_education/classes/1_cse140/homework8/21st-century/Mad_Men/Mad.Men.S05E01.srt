00:11:13,151 --> 00:11:16,685
Splendid. So I trust you're adequately
prepared for the Heinz presentation.

181
00:11:16,687 --> 00:11:19,455
Yes, boss.
We have almost everything.

182
00:11:19,457 --> 00:11:21,557
Mm-hmm. Just short
Mrs. Draper's work.

183
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:24,226
- She's writing the coupons.
- Has Don signed off?

184
00:11:24,228 --> 00:11:26,961
He's late.
And so is she, coincidentally.

185
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,331
Clara.

186
00:11:33,368 --> 00:11:35,235
Clara!

187
00:11:35,237 --> 00:11:36,703
She should have just
rolled over and said,

188
00:11:36,705 --> 00:11:38,806
"Don, what do you
think of this?"

189
00:11:38,808 --> 00:11:40,441
I bet she says that
every morning.

190
00:11:40,443 --> 00:11:43,378
( Laughing )

191
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,313
Come on, it's 11:00.

192
00:11:47,616 --> 00:11:50,486
- ( Laughing )
- No sunbathing?

193
00:11:50,488 --> 00:11:52,688
No.

194
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:55,792
Look, we had
a three-day weekend

195
00:11:55,794 --> 00:11:58,128
and you didn't do anything?

196
00:11:58,130 --> 00:11:59,929
That's not my calendar.

197
00:12:01,331 --> 00:12:03,065
Pete:
Clara.

198
00:12:04,801 --> 00:12:07,502
- How was your weekend?
- Clara, is Mr. Draper in yet?

199
00:12:07,504 --> 00:12:09,604
- No.
- You're late for the status meeting.

200
00:12:09,606 --> 00:12:12,407
You should probably go prepare
instead of molesting my secretary.

201
00:12:12,409 --> 00:12:14,976
Well, sweetheart,
the torture's over.

202
00:12:14,978 --> 00:12:17,044
Let the fun begin.

203
00:12:18,847 --> 00:12:20,815
My office is 30 yards away.

204
00:12:20,817 --> 00:12:23,351
So when I hit that buzzer,
I'm trying to save myself

205
00:12:23,353 --> 00:12:25,653
a trip through the miracle
of telephonics.

206
00:12:25,655 --> 00:12:28,356
Mr. and Mrs. Draper
are here.

207
00:12:30,492 --> 00:12:32,893
- Good morning.
- Megan: So sorry. I overslept.

208
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:34,695
That's not true.
I did.

209
00:12:34,697 --> 00:12:36,564
How was Memorial Day?

210
00:12:36,566 --> 00:12:38,398
It was nice.
We had my kids.

211
00:12:41,336 --> 00:12:43,304
You had the status
meeting at 10:00.

212
00:12:45,274 --> 00:12:47,776
- Morning.
- Good morning.

213
00:12:47,778 --> 00:12:51,413
( Chuckles ) Did you read about
Y&R's paper bag drop?

214
00:12:51,415 --> 00:12:53,682
I did.

215
00:12:53,684 --> 00:12:55,917
- I don't see the humor.
- It's funny.

216
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:58,653
I mean, if nothing else, it serves
them right for stealing Pond's.

217
00:12:58,655 --> 00:13:00,822
What does one thing
have to do with the other?

218
00:13:00,824 --> 00:13:02,857
They stole the Pond's account
and now they're a laughingstock.

219
00:13:02,859 --> 00:13:05,860
- Makes me feel better.
- Gentlemen.

220
00:13:05,862 --> 00:13:07,929
Shall we mosey on over
to the conference room?

221
00:13:07,931 --> 00:13:10,665
- We did have a meeting at 10:00.
- Morning, Lane, clipboard.

222
00:13:10,667 --> 00:13:14,335
We should run a want ad
saying something like,

223
00:13:14,337 --> 00:13:17,171
"Sterling Cooper, an equal
opportunity employer."

224
00:13:17,173 --> 00:13:19,273
- Our windows don't open.
- ( Laughs )

225
00:13:19,275 --> 00:13:21,642
As tempting as it sounds,
I don't know if we need to be

226
00:13:21,644 --> 00:13:23,878
spending money to further
their embarrassment.

227
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,415
Look, if there's no line item
for humiliating the competition,

228
00:13:26,417 --> 00:13:28,150
Don will write it
and I'll pay for it.

229
00:13:28,152 --> 00:13:30,286
But you're not
allowed to read it.

230
00:13:30,288 --> 00:13:32,922
Forget the want ads.
The advertising column.

231
00:13:32,924 --> 00:13:34,524
- I want them to see it.
- ( Laughs )

232
00:13:34,526 --> 00:13:36,993
So, Heinz is coming in.
Don?

233
00:13:36,995 --> 00:13:40,697
Yes. Caroline, can you get Megan
and the Heinz boards, please?

234
00:13:40,699 --> 00:13:42,365
- Do you want the team?
- No.

235
00:13:42,367 --> 00:13:44,935
- What else?
- Status is status quo on my end.

236
00:13:44,937 --> 00:13:46,870
I'm supposed to have drinks with
Bruce Lewis from oldsmobile.

237
00:13:46,872 --> 00:13:49,173
He wants to know if there's
a way around nader.

238
00:13:49,175 --> 00:13:51,341
There isn't.
Anything else?

239
00:13:51,343 --> 00:13:53,477
Lane?

240
00:13:53,479 --> 00:13:56,179
I have a lunch at the 4A's,

241
00:13:56,181 --> 00:13:59,616
so I should be back in time but
not necessarily conscious.

242
00:14:01,452 --> 00:14:05,155
And according to the memo,
Kenny finally has signatures

243
00:14:05,157 --> 00:14:07,657
from Chevalier, Galone
and Butler Shoes.

244
00:14:07,659 --> 00:14:10,060
Footwear.
All good news.

245
00:14:10,062 --> 00:14:12,263
I suppose that brings
this meeting to a close.

246
00:14:12,265 --> 00:14:14,165
Don, may I speak
with you privately?

247
00:14:14,167 --> 00:14:17,634
Uh, I should take a look
at these right away.

248
00:14:20,071 --> 00:14:21,805
Mr. Campbell.

249
00:14:22,973 --> 00:14:24,840
I have a call of nature.

250
00:14:24,842 --> 00:14:27,943
Do not begin this meeting
without me.

251
00:14:29,312 --> 00:14:30,979
When is he free next?

252
00:14:33,849 --> 00:14:36,251
You obviously haven't seen
my coupons yet.

253
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,554
- Let's get out of here.
- No.

254
00:14:39,556 --> 00:14:41,457
Then lock the door.

255
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:43,192
As soon as I'm in here
longer than five minutes,

256
00:14:43,194 --> 00:14:45,061
people will start to...

257
00:14:45,063 --> 00:14:47,364
What?
Who?

258
00:14:47,366 --> 00:14:50,334
I have to get these to Peggy.

259
00:14:50,336 --> 00:14:52,336
You have a presentation,
you know.

260
00:14:59,545 --> 00:15:02,647
I could make you go home right now,
you know. I have that power.

261
00:15:02,649 --> 00:15:04,249
<i>( Intercom buzzes )</i>

262
00:15:04,251 --> 00:15:05,817
Caroline: <i>Mr. Campbell</i>
<i>is here to see you.</i>

263
00:15:05,819 --> 00:15:09,187
- I just saw him.
- I have to get back to work.

264
00:15:09,189 --> 00:15:11,055
Open your blouse.

265
00:15:11,057 --> 00:15:13,358
You're a dirty old man.

266
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:25,102
- Anything else?
- No, ma'am.

267
00:15:27,339 --> 00:15:29,474
I'm sorry.
Am I interrupting?

268
00:15:29,476 --> 00:15:31,042
I asked for your first
available meeting,

269
00:15:31,044 --> 00:15:33,411
and it turns out you have
nothing to do today.

270
00:15:33,413 --> 00:15:37,048
If you could have any client in
the world, who would you want?

271
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:38,917
- American Airlines.
- Why?

272
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:40,986
- Because they stood us up.
- Right.

273
00:15:40,988 --> 00:15:43,989
So I started thinking, who has
those feelings about us?

274
00:15:46,359 --> 00:15:47,893
Mohawk Airlines.

275
00:15:47,895 --> 00:15:49,795
You were very close.

276
00:15:49,797 --> 00:15:51,830
The company's in
a lot of trouble.

277
00:15:51,832 --> 00:15:55,233
It's very nice that things have not
gone well since we cut them loose.

278
00:15:55,235 --> 00:15:56,734
They want to come back?

279
00:15:56,736 --> 00:15:59,438
After the way
we treated them...

280
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,141
So that American Airlines
thing isn't happening?

281
00:16:02,143 --> 00:16:04,610
- I, for one, am very excited.
- Oh, me, too.

282
00:16:04,612 --> 00:16:07,113
I just don't understand
the secrecy or the urgency.

283
00:16:07,115 --> 00:16:10,216
I'm meeting with them today, and
I think you should drop by.

284
00:16:10,218 --> 00:16:12,886
Hank Lammott hit me pretty
hard on his way out the door.

285
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:14,621
I may not help.

286
00:16:14,623 --> 00:16:16,857
Don, you're the big draw.

287
00:16:16,859 --> 00:16:19,360
They're not going to ask
for someone else.

288
00:16:19,362 --> 00:16:22,529
Look, get through this,
get them back for more,

289
00:16:22,531 --> 00:16:24,832
and I'll make time
in my busy schedule.

290
00:16:24,834 --> 00:16:27,301
Got it. I'll let you know
when I need you to...

291
00:16:27,303 --> 00:16:29,636
It's a good idea.

292
00:16:31,706 --> 00:16:33,907
Can I get some coffee?

293
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:37,577
Peggy: Oh, Megan,
you're here.

294
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:48,589
I took a risk on one of them.
Two for 22¢.

295
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:51,192
Nice.

296
00:16:51,194 --> 00:16:53,661
Of course, we're really
locked into the 5¢ off,

297
00:16:53,663 --> 00:16:55,730
but good thinking.

298
00:16:57,066 --> 00:16:59,100
Stan, can you do
something to these?

299
00:17:02,337 --> 00:17:03,504
Like what?

300
00:17:03,506 --> 00:17:06,641
I don't know.
Do that thing with the border

301
00:17:06,643 --> 00:17:08,876
around the edge so it kind
of looks like legal tender

302
00:17:08,878 --> 00:17:11,846
with the can of beans
where Washington goes.

303
00:17:11,848 --> 00:17:14,282
You want me to put
a little wig on him?

304
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:16,084
Play with it.

305
00:17:16,086 --> 00:17:18,686
Drop dead.

306
00:17:18,688 --> 00:17:20,821
They keep asking me to be
more and more specific

307
00:17:20,823 --> 00:17:23,324
until you're
drawing it yourself.

308
00:17:23,326 --> 00:17:25,059
- Do you want me to move?
- Oh, no, no.

309
00:17:25,061 --> 00:17:27,261
- I'm just looking for gum.
- Oh, I have some.

310
00:17:34,236 --> 00:17:37,638
So I have to ask your
opinion about something.

311
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,707
You did a great job,

312
00:17:39,709 --> 00:17:42,242
but I can't really go
overboard on coupons.

313
00:17:42,244 --> 00:17:44,545
I did that kind
of baloney for two years.

314
00:17:44,547 --> 00:17:45,913
You should take comfort
in the fact that

315
00:17:45,915 --> 00:17:48,882
it's very important to
the client-- too important.

316
00:17:48,884 --> 00:17:52,385
No, it's something else.

317
00:17:52,387 --> 00:17:54,554
Tomorrow's Don's birthday.

318
00:17:54,556 --> 00:17:57,957
Oh, shit.
It's June 1st?

319
00:17:59,026 --> 00:18:00,860
Ugh, I forgot.

320
00:18:00,862 --> 00:18:02,462
Got to get him something.

321
00:18:02,464 --> 00:18:04,564
I still haven't gotten
you a wedding present.

322
00:18:04,566 --> 00:18:07,000
Sorry. You know
how busy I've been.

323
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:09,803
No, it's just, um...

324
00:18:11,606 --> 00:18:14,474
I'm throwing a party
for him on Saturday.

325
00:18:14,476 --> 00:18:16,277
It's a surprise.

326
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:19,347
Oh, okay.

327
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:21,116
For Don?

328
00:18:21,118 --> 00:18:23,518
Yes.

329
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,553
Men hate surprises.

330
00:18:25,555 --> 00:18:27,355
Didn't you have
"Lucy" in Canada?

331
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:28,890
Look, nobody likes it
in theory,

332
00:18:28,892 --> 00:18:30,725
but people are always glad.

333
00:18:30,727 --> 00:18:33,261
And you've never
seen me throw a party.

334
00:18:33,263 --> 00:18:36,897
Everyone's gonna home from this
and they're gonna have sex.

335
00:18:36,899 --> 00:18:39,600
Okay.

336
00:18:39,602 --> 00:18:41,936
Sounds like fun
for us at least.

337
00:18:41,938 --> 00:18:44,805
I mean, if I'm invited.

338
00:18:44,807 --> 00:18:46,540
I don't want to assume.

339
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:49,843
You're invited.
I'm not sure who else is.

340
00:18:49,845 --> 00:18:53,647
I went through his rolodex.
I crossed out all the clients

341
00:18:53,649 --> 00:18:56,349
and everyone he's fired.

342
00:18:56,351 --> 00:18:59,552
That doesn't leave
a lot of people.

343
00:18:59,554 --> 00:19:02,389
Freddy Rumsen doesn't
come to parties.

344
00:19:04,325 --> 00:19:07,026
- You have to invite Harry.
- I know,

345
00:19:07,028 --> 00:19:09,428
but he really doesn't like him.

346
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:11,764
Really?

347
00:19:11,766 --> 00:19:13,532
I didn't say anything.

348
00:19:13,534 --> 00:19:15,300
( Laughs )

349
00:19:15,302 --> 00:19:17,402
- Frank Keller, his accountant?
- He likes him.

350
00:19:17,404 --> 00:19:20,973
There are six phone numbers
for Herman Phillips.

351
00:19:20,975 --> 00:19:23,643
- Is he important?
- That's Duck.

352
00:19:27,715 --> 00:19:29,550
What birthday is it?

353
00:19:29,552 --> 00:19:31,852
( Mouths ) 40.

354
00:19:40,695 --> 00:19:41,963
<i>( Keys jingling )</i>

355
00:19:41,965 --> 00:19:43,597
<i>( Door opens )</i>

356
00:19:53,474 --> 00:19:54,941
( Quietly ) How'd he do?

357
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:57,610
He was fussy the whole time.

358
00:19:57,612 --> 00:19:59,745
But the elevator
always knocks him out.

359
00:19:59,747 --> 00:20:03,349
Must be the vibration.

360
00:20:03,351 --> 00:20:06,252
Who would have thought
you'd be so good at this?

361
00:20:06,254 --> 00:20:09,288
You'll be good at it,
too, sweetheart.

362
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:11,690
What am I going to do
when you go home?

363
00:20:11,692 --> 00:20:14,326
Are you really going
back to that office?

364
00:20:14,328 --> 00:20:15,961
You worked.

365
00:20:15,963 --> 00:20:18,663
I had to.
Your husband's a doctor.

366
00:20:18,665 --> 00:20:22,134
It doesn't matter.
I promised and they need me.

367
00:20:22,136 --> 00:20:24,269
I'm not saying you're
not important to them,

368
00:20:24,271 --> 00:20:26,739
but they also know
that priorities change.

369
00:20:26,741 --> 00:20:29,141
- They should, anyway.
- Why are you doing this?

370
00:20:29,143 --> 00:20:32,712
You don't know how sick you're going to
feel inside or what you're going to miss.

371
00:20:32,714 --> 00:20:35,015
What he's doing now,
that's nothing.

372
00:20:35,017 --> 00:20:37,450
- Just wait.
- I know, I know.

373
00:20:37,452 --> 00:20:39,886
I just--

374
00:20:39,888 --> 00:20:42,855
I don't want
to break my promise.

375
00:20:42,857 --> 00:20:45,591
And Greg will be stationed at
Fort Dix for a second year.

376
00:20:45,593 --> 00:20:47,793
- I can commute from New Jersey.
- And then?

377
00:20:47,795 --> 00:20:51,830
And then when he's done,

378
00:20:51,832 --> 00:20:53,598
we'll see.

379
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,300
Joan, he's not going to
allow you to work.

380
00:20:56,302 --> 00:20:58,936
Allow me?

381
00:20:58,938 --> 00:21:03,108
Whither thou goest, I will go.

382
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:06,478
And how did that
work out for you?

383
00:21:21,233 --> 00:21:23,067
<i>( People chatting )</i>

384
00:21:23,069 --> 00:21:25,603
Ah, Pete Campbell.
Late as usual.

385
00:21:25,605 --> 00:21:27,839
He obviously didn't
come in on a Mohawk plane.

386
00:21:27,841 --> 00:21:30,509
- Hank. Jack.
- You're not late.

387
00:21:30,511 --> 00:21:32,844
- Roger told us to come early.
- Hmm.

388
00:21:32,846 --> 00:21:35,614
Have a seat. You're only one
behind, but they're nuclear.

389
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,852
Roger, they're looking
for you back in the office.

390
00:21:39,854 --> 00:21:42,988
- It'll keep.
- We were just laughing about Y&R.

391
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:45,791
It couldn't have happened
to a better bunch of bigots.

392
00:21:45,793 --> 00:21:48,527
( Laughs )

393
00:21:48,529 --> 00:21:51,597
Roger, it's an emergency.

394
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:53,499
Really?

395
00:21:53,501 --> 00:21:55,601
Oh, come on.
We just got started.

396
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:02,074
All right, all right.
Sorry, fellas.

397
00:22:02,076 --> 00:22:04,577
Heavy is the head
that wears the crown.

398
00:22:04,579 --> 00:22:08,815
You don't want me to fly
copilot or be your wingman?

399
00:22:08,817 --> 00:22:11,718
Check your valises?
Hold your airsickness bag?

400
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,121
Do you want me to throw one
into the bag you're in?

401
00:22:14,123 --> 00:22:16,190
You enjoy yourself, then.

402
00:22:16,192 --> 00:22:18,860
Garcon, assume that
these are gone.

403
00:22:18,862 --> 00:22:21,096
I should warn you
about these two--

404
00:22:21,098 --> 00:22:23,031
- They're a thirsty lot.
- Always a pleasure.

405
00:22:23,033 --> 00:22:26,401
When you're done with him, just fold
him up and slide him under the door.

406
00:22:26,403 --> 00:22:30,005
( Laughs )

407
00:22:30,007 --> 00:22:32,173
I love that guy.

408
00:22:37,646 --> 00:22:40,714
And so we take advantage of
this new microphotography

409
00:22:40,716 --> 00:22:43,483
and high-speed camera
to show...

410
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:48,554
A bean ballet.

411
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:52,825
( Humming )

412
00:22:52,827 --> 00:22:56,529
Spinning in air with their
delicious perfection,

413
00:22:56,531 --> 00:22:58,931
<i>the beans pirouette</i>
<i>in slow motion,</i>

414
00:22:58,933 --> 00:23:01,334
they somersault in slow motion.

415
00:23:01,336 --> 00:23:04,504
Some of them spin clockwise,
some counter-clockwise

416
00:23:04,506 --> 00:23:07,473
so they'll appear to be
moving towards each other.

417
00:23:07,475 --> 00:23:09,609
Until...

418
00:23:09,611 --> 00:23:13,645
They drop into a full can
first seen from the top.

419
00:23:15,014 --> 00:23:17,815
There's a splash of
mouth-watering sauce

420
00:23:17,817 --> 00:23:20,017
as each one lands.

421
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,688
Then we cut to the front,
the iconic label.

422
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:27,124
( Stops humming )

423
00:23:27,126 --> 00:23:29,961
"The art of supper."

424
00:23:36,937 --> 00:23:39,673
Have you done this before,
this special photography?

425
00:23:39,675 --> 00:23:42,676
It's been done before, but
you'll be the first on TV.

426
00:23:42,678 --> 00:23:46,113
How do they get the beans to do that?
They can't just get lucky.

427
00:23:46,115 --> 00:23:49,449
This camera can show
a bullet spinning in midair.

428
00:23:49,451 --> 00:23:51,884
Where's the bite and smile?

429
00:23:51,886 --> 00:23:54,687
Ken, you said there'd be
a bite and smile on the phone.

430
00:23:54,689 --> 00:23:57,389
I think I said there was gonna
be a bean ballet, Raymond.

431
00:23:57,391 --> 00:23:59,858
But I'm sure we can add that.

432
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:02,794
And what do they
take away from it?

433
00:24:02,796 --> 00:24:05,196
It puts beans on their mind.

434
00:24:05,198 --> 00:24:08,133
It's an unforgettable image.

435
00:24:08,135 --> 00:24:10,702
And believe it or not,
it makes them exciting.

436
00:24:13,539 --> 00:24:15,107
And it'll show you have
a sense of humor,

437
00:24:15,109 --> 00:24:17,042
because, really,
they're being portrayed

438
00:24:17,044 --> 00:24:19,812
as far more important
than they are.

439
00:24:19,814 --> 00:24:22,649
You ever see beans up close

440
00:24:22,651 --> 00:24:25,652
they're slimy. They look like
a bunch of bloody organs.

441
00:24:25,654 --> 00:24:29,188
And it's not just for fellas like
me that saw things in Korea.

442
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:32,858
Kidney beans are
called kidney beans

443
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:34,926
because they're
shaped that way.

444
00:24:34,928 --> 00:24:37,229
But you could call
all beans that.

445
00:24:37,231 --> 00:24:40,799
They look better
in a group, in a bowl.

446
00:24:40,801 --> 00:24:43,135
Hell, what's wrong
with a spoon?

447
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:46,304
Don.

448
00:24:46,306 --> 00:24:48,006
- Well, hello, Don.
- Hello, Raymond.

449
00:24:48,008 --> 00:24:50,174
Good to see you.
Are you as excited about this as we are?

450
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:52,510
I don't know.

451
00:24:52,512 --> 00:24:54,379
You said to be bold.

452
00:24:54,381 --> 00:24:56,147
Nothing on TV is going
to look like this.

453
00:24:56,149 --> 00:24:58,081
And just imagine seeing
one of these dancing beans

454
00:24:58,083 --> 00:24:59,683
on the subway wall.

455
00:24:59,685 --> 00:25:02,019
People will hear the music
in their heads.

456
00:25:03,988 --> 00:25:05,989
Look, it's very artistic.

457
00:25:05,991 --> 00:25:09,392
And I want to be bold,
but this isn't what I had in mind

458
00:25:09,394 --> 00:25:12,262
when I was talking about a
new generation of consumers.

459
00:25:12,264 --> 00:25:14,798
The ketchup kids,
are they even going to notice this?

460
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,868
I mean, that waltz alone
reminds me of old people.

461
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:20,203
Maybe I wasn't clear.

462
00:25:20,205 --> 00:25:22,806
This is temporary music.
We can change it.

463
00:25:22,808 --> 00:25:24,808
It's got no message.

464
00:25:28,847 --> 00:25:31,382
I can see your point.

465
00:25:31,384 --> 00:25:35,019
Beans is the war,
the depression,

466
00:25:35,021 --> 00:25:37,989
bomb shelters.
We have to erase that.

467
00:25:37,991 --> 00:25:41,560
They have to be cool.
Don, you know what I'm talking about.

468
00:25:41,562 --> 00:25:44,697
I want the kids in college.

469
00:25:44,699 --> 00:25:46,232
It's convenient.

470
00:25:46,234 --> 00:25:48,934
They have the hot plate.
They're sitting in.

471
00:25:50,436 --> 00:25:52,670
Okay.
We'll work on that.

472
00:25:56,108 --> 00:25:58,209
Maybe it's someone with
a picket sign saying,

473
00:25:58,211 --> 00:26:01,311
- "We want beans."
- You know what, Raymond?

474
00:26:01,313 --> 00:26:04,180
<i>This is our job from here on out.</i>
<i>We'll make you happy.</i>

475
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:09,085
Raymond: <i>I'm really sorry</i>
<i>about that.</i>

476
00:26:09,087 --> 00:26:11,254
Please, this is a process.

477
00:26:12,689 --> 00:26:14,457
Let me walk you out.

478
00:26:25,936 --> 00:26:28,037
What else you got?

479
00:26:28,039 --> 00:26:30,273
That was the best thing so far.

480
00:26:30,275 --> 00:26:32,542
Unless you like
this beans protest.

481
00:26:32,544 --> 00:26:33,977
Please, you can't be
surprised that that man

482
00:26:33,979 --> 00:26:36,847
- doesn't have a taste for ballet.
- It's a joke on ballet.

483
00:26:36,849 --> 00:26:38,949
And you can't be surprised he
doesn't have a sense of humor.

484
00:26:38,951 --> 00:26:41,452
I'm not.

485
00:26:41,454 --> 00:26:43,087
But I guess I thought
you'd come in here

486
00:26:43,089 --> 00:26:45,322
and tell them how good it was.

487
00:26:45,324 --> 00:26:48,392
Do I really want to waste an hour
and a half shoving it down his throat

488
00:26:48,394 --> 00:26:50,994
only to have him pull
the plug at the last minute?

489
00:26:50,996 --> 00:26:53,730
This is business that
came in over the transom.

490
00:26:53,732 --> 00:26:57,467
We didn't pitch it.
He has every right to make us work for it.

491
00:26:57,469 --> 00:26:59,235
I wish I would have known that.

492
00:26:59,237 --> 00:27:01,437
I would have saved this
for round two.

493
00:27:01,439 --> 00:27:03,605
We'll get him next time.

494
00:27:13,951 --> 00:27:15,118
<i>( Phone ringing )</i>

495
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,654
Caroline.
Is he in?

496
00:27:17,656 --> 00:27:20,156
He's gone for the day.

497
00:27:20,158 --> 00:27:22,025
Ha!

498
00:27:25,496 --> 00:27:27,697
Ah! Oh!

499
00:27:29,265 --> 00:27:30,866
Damn it.
Clara.

500
00:27:32,702 --> 00:27:34,169
Clara!

501
00:27:34,171 --> 00:27:36,571
Oh, my goodness.
What happened?

502
00:27:36,573 --> 00:27:40,041
- You want me to get some tissue?
- No.

503
00:27:40,043 --> 00:27:42,710
I want you to tell me why
Roger Sterling was at my meeting.

504
00:27:42,712 --> 00:27:44,979
- I don't know.
- I know.

505
00:27:44,981 --> 00:27:48,316
Because he hovers over
your desk like a damn U-2.

506
00:27:48,318 --> 00:27:50,885
- What?
- You think he's looking at your breasts?

507
00:27:50,887 --> 00:27:54,056
He's looking at my calendar.

508
00:27:54,058 --> 00:27:56,058
Did she hit you?

509
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:59,262
Thank you, Clara.
You've done enough damage for today.

510
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:03,800
You need to lower your voice.
Have a drink.

511
00:28:03,802 --> 00:28:05,769
No, no more drinks.

512
00:28:05,771 --> 00:28:09,372
- Heinz looked miserable.
- They're making us work for it.

513
00:28:09,374 --> 00:28:12,208
Don didn't seem worried.
Did you crash with Mohawk?

514
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:13,876
No, it was perfect.

515
00:28:13,878 --> 00:28:17,713
Except for my deep nausea
and pending headache.

516
00:28:17,715 --> 00:28:20,515
Oh, and Roger made
an appearance.

517
00:28:20,517 --> 00:28:23,084
( Chuckles ) Well, that shows
it's a good lead.

518
00:28:23,086 --> 00:28:24,653
It's my lead.

519
00:28:24,655 --> 00:28:26,988
Wasn't Roger in the service
with Henry Lammott?

520
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:28,790
Did you do any rowing?

521
00:28:28,792 --> 00:28:31,894
- You rowed?
- I was a coxswain.

522
00:28:31,896 --> 00:28:34,797
The boat moved because everyone
pulls in the same direction.

523
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,700
I'm not supposed to worry
about Roger.

524
00:28:36,702 --> 00:28:38,869
I'm supposed to worry
about other agencies.

525
00:28:38,871 --> 00:28:41,205
You shouldn't be worried at all.
Business is stable.

526
00:28:41,207 --> 00:28:43,140
Stable is that step backwards

527
00:28:43,142 --> 00:28:45,443
between successful and failing.

528
00:28:45,445 --> 00:28:47,479
Fine, Pete.

529
00:28:47,481 --> 00:28:49,581
Just don't be impatient.

530
00:28:49,583 --> 00:28:51,449
You know how this works
from here on out.

531
00:28:51,451 --> 00:28:52,884
We start with a bunch
of piddly shit.

532
00:28:52,886 --> 00:28:54,620
Your topaz,
your white knight cologne.

533
00:28:54,622 --> 00:28:57,991
We add your mid-sized stuff.
Maybe Mohawk.

534
00:28:57,993 --> 00:28:59,793
We still got Vicks.
That's big.

535
00:28:59,795 --> 00:29:02,162
Next, we worm our way
into a few niche companies,

536
00:29:02,164 --> 00:29:05,633
get something sexy in a good
neighborhood, a pharmaceutical.

537
00:29:05,635 --> 00:29:07,902
Maybe if God
is gracious, a car.

538
00:29:07,904 --> 00:29:11,105
And then we go public,

539
00:29:11,107 --> 00:29:13,107
open an office in Buenos Aires,

540
00:29:13,109 --> 00:29:15,910
and Elvis plays
at Tammy's Sweet 16.

541
00:29:15,912 --> 00:29:20,114
Kenny Cosgrove writes another
great American novel.

542
00:29:20,116 --> 00:29:22,215
You know it didn't hurt
to have Roger warm them up.

543
00:29:22,217 --> 00:29:24,218
There's no one better
at turning a meeting into a bender.

544
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:27,387
And they love his pickled guts.

545
00:29:29,424 --> 00:29:31,758
Am I going to see you
at Chez Draper on Saturday?

546
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,193
I wish I could get
overtime for it.

547
00:29:34,195 --> 00:29:36,262
( Chuckles )

548
00:29:45,704 --> 00:29:47,505
You ready?

549
00:29:47,507 --> 00:29:50,108
- We're almost done, actually.
- Do you need her?

550
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:53,345
No, it's okay.
It'll be here in the morning.

551
00:29:53,347 --> 00:29:55,781
- Great.
- Big weekend plans?

552
00:29:59,019 --> 00:30:00,953
It's Tuesday.
I don't know.

553
00:30:00,955 --> 00:30:02,755
I was talking about me.

554
00:30:02,757 --> 00:30:05,225
My cousin's coming in.

555
00:30:05,227 --> 00:30:07,627
Stan, assume that
you're working.

556
00:30:10,831 --> 00:30:12,265
Good night.

557
00:30:14,301 --> 00:30:16,635
You're amazing.

558
00:30:16,637 --> 00:30:18,137
It could have been worse.

559
00:30:18,139 --> 00:30:19,772
I almost said, "I'm sorry
I can't make it."

560
00:30:19,774 --> 00:30:22,441
- You're not going?
- No, my cousin's on shore leave.

561
00:30:22,443 --> 00:30:25,777
He's only got two days.
A little notice would have been nice.

562
00:30:25,779 --> 00:30:27,645
I would have loved
to have seen the look on Don's face.

563
00:30:27,647 --> 00:30:29,948
You almost just saw it.

564
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:33,485
Like we have nothing
else to do.

565
00:30:33,487 --> 00:30:35,588
Did you believe him in there?

566
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:37,823
The guy didn't like it.
What was he supposed to say?

567
00:30:37,825 --> 00:30:40,259
What he usually says.

568
00:30:40,261 --> 00:30:43,262
"Hey, buddy, you got such great
ideas, open your own agency."

569
00:30:43,264 --> 00:30:45,264
The clients are right
all of a sudden?

570
00:30:45,266 --> 00:30:46,832
I don't recognize that man.

571
00:30:46,834 --> 00:30:49,936
He's kind and patient.

572
00:30:49,938 --> 00:30:51,937
And it galls you.

573
00:30:51,939 --> 00:30:55,041
No, it concerns me.

574
00:30:55,043 --> 00:30:57,177
( Groans )

575
00:30:57,179 --> 00:30:58,678
Where are you going?

576
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,580
I've got tickets
to the bean ballet

577
00:31:00,582 --> 00:31:02,950
and the curtain's
about to go up.

578
00:31:03,985 --> 00:31:05,586
Never gets old.

579
00:31:05,588 --> 00:31:06,453
( Laughs )

580
00:31:25,093 --> 00:31:27,328
You're home late.

581
00:31:29,765 --> 00:31:33,001
I thought I was going to have
to walk home from the station,

582
00:31:33,003 --> 00:31:36,704
but luckily there was
a cab driver leaving a bar.

583
00:31:36,706 --> 00:31:39,107
How was your day?

584
00:31:39,109 --> 00:31:42,177
I didn't want to disturb you.

585
00:31:42,179 --> 00:31:44,246
Oh.

586
00:31:44,248 --> 00:31:47,282
This becomes a home the minute
you walk through that door.

587
00:31:47,284 --> 00:31:48,750
( Sighs )

588
00:31:48,752 --> 00:31:50,919
There's no fruit
to my labor, tweety.

589
00:31:50,921 --> 00:31:52,755
Well, I suppose
none of this counts--

590
00:31:52,757 --> 00:31:55,558
An acre of land,
a wife, a child.

591
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,660
That has nothing
to do with work.

592
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:01,330
I'm ungrateful.

593
00:32:01,332 --> 00:32:04,000
I'm sorry.

594
00:32:04,002 --> 00:32:07,136
Dissatisfaction
is a symptom of ambition.

595
00:32:07,138 --> 00:32:10,072
It's the coal that fuels the fire.
You know that.

596
00:32:10,074 --> 00:32:11,974
( Sighs )

597
00:32:14,078 --> 00:32:16,479
Do you really want a dog?

598
00:32:16,481 --> 00:32:19,749
Maybe just a beagle
to scare off gophers.

599
00:32:20,818 --> 00:32:23,253
We'll see.

600
00:32:23,255 --> 00:32:26,155
Oh, luckily my parents
can baby-sit Saturday.

601
00:32:26,157 --> 00:32:29,392
Now tell me the truth.
Did Megan really just invite you today?

602
00:32:29,394 --> 00:32:31,260
She did.
I don't know about everyone else.

603
00:32:31,262 --> 00:32:34,931
Well, she's very impulsive.
We know that.

604
00:32:34,933 --> 00:32:38,034
I have to go to bed.
Tammy will be up in a hour.

605
00:32:38,036 --> 00:32:39,736
Go ahead.

606
00:33:00,825 --> 00:33:03,794
( Chatting, laughing )

607
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:06,965
Attention, party guests.

608
00:33:08,567 --> 00:33:11,136
- Hello.
- ( Chatter stops )

609
00:33:11,138 --> 00:33:14,006
We're T-minus
five minutes or so.

610
00:33:14,008 --> 00:33:17,744
So if we can bring things
down to a sotto voce,

611
00:33:17,746 --> 00:33:20,180
that would help.

612
00:33:20,182 --> 00:33:22,516
I'm gonna turn off the lights.

613
00:33:22,518 --> 00:33:24,518
- No!
- ( Guests laugh )

614
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:27,421
Well, fine.
Just keep it down.

615
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:30,791
My God, is he queer.

616
00:33:30,793 --> 00:33:32,827
He reminds me
of Lane's brother.

617
00:33:32,829 --> 00:33:34,829
( Laughs )

618
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:38,232
<i>( Elevator opens )</i>

619
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:43,237
Ah!

620
00:33:44,973 --> 00:33:46,674
Finally.

621
00:33:46,676 --> 00:33:48,543
We're gonna go
inside in a second.

622
00:33:48,545 --> 00:33:50,812
You're the one that dragged
me out to the restaurant.

623
00:33:52,148 --> 00:33:53,882
Come on.

624
00:33:57,186 --> 00:33:59,921
- ( Whistles )
- ( Sighs )

625
00:33:59,923 --> 00:34:01,657
Jane:
<i>You have to knock.</i>

626
00:34:01,659 --> 00:34:03,692
- You have to knock to get in.
- What if it's started already?

627
00:34:03,694 --> 00:34:06,262
It doesn't matter if it's started,
you still have to knock.

628
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,534
No.

629
00:34:11,536 --> 00:34:13,269
We were just in
the neighborhood.

630
00:34:13,271 --> 00:34:16,672
And my mother always said
never show up empty-handed.

631
00:34:19,275 --> 00:34:21,843
Oh, damn it.

632
00:34:21,845 --> 00:34:23,778
- No.
- ( Sighs )

633
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:26,080
<i>Calice.</i>

634
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:34,821
All:
Surprise!

635
00:34:34,823 --> 00:34:38,124
<i>( Applause ) Sorry, I blew it in the hall.</i>

636
00:34:38,126 --> 00:34:39,893
All:
Aw!

637
00:34:39,895 --> 00:34:42,161
But I am very surprised.

638
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:45,064
( Applause )

639
00:34:47,034 --> 00:34:50,336
( Band playing )

640
00:34:55,076 --> 00:34:59,112
I have to say that I am honored

641
00:34:59,114 --> 00:35:02,115
and touched to be included
in this group of intimates.

642
00:35:02,117 --> 00:35:05,685
And I predicted this,
did I not?

643
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:07,921
This.
( Laughs )

644
00:35:07,923 --> 00:35:10,323
( Grunts )

645
00:35:10,325 --> 00:35:12,859
Who is this?

646
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:15,361
Oh, that's my wife.

647
00:35:16,664 --> 00:35:18,498
- Nice to meet you.
- Charmed.

648
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,901
The domino theory
is not a joke.

649
00:35:21,903 --> 00:35:24,804
The Vietnamese
are fighting a civil war.

650
00:35:24,806 --> 00:35:26,973
There is no monolithic
communism.

651
00:35:26,975 --> 00:35:29,042
- It's an excuse.
- Really?

652
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:32,512
Come on, Bert.
It's for profit.

653
00:35:32,514 --> 00:35:34,213
Bombs are the perfect product.

654
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:36,615
They cost a fortune
and you only use them once.

655
00:35:36,617 --> 00:35:40,452
So I suppose this young man here is
coming home in a bag for nothing.

656
00:35:40,454 --> 00:35:42,553
If he's lucky.
You ever read "Johnny got his gun"?

657
00:35:42,555 --> 00:35:44,355
No eyes, no ears, no nose,

658
00:35:44,357 --> 00:35:46,323
tapping out his last
wishes in morse code

659
00:35:46,325 --> 00:35:49,660
with his deformed head.

660
00:35:49,662 --> 00:35:52,463
I thought there we
going to be girls here.

661
00:35:59,004 --> 00:36:03,474
For purely selfish reasons, I want
to thank you for excluding Joan.

662
00:36:03,476 --> 00:36:06,276
I would have had to buy
earplugs for the ride home.

663
00:36:06,278 --> 00:36:08,478
It wasn't up to me.
Can't you tell?

664
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,914
( Laughing )

665
00:36:13,316 --> 00:36:15,517
Hell of a party.
Jennifer couldn't make it.

666
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:18,020
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- No, she couldn't get a date.

667
00:36:18,022 --> 00:36:19,988
( Laughs )

668
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:22,657
Anyway, I know
she said no gifts,

669
00:36:22,659 --> 00:36:24,993
but I got you this.

670
00:36:24,995 --> 00:36:26,794
Open it.

671
00:36:28,864 --> 00:36:30,499
You don't have to
if you don't want to.

672
00:36:30,501 --> 00:36:33,168
It's a silver-handled
walking stick.

673
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:35,037
Oh, look, he got you a cane.

674
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:38,041
Don Ameche has one.
It's a steinway walking stick.

675
00:36:38,043 --> 00:36:40,444
You could stick it up
your ass and have a concert.

676
00:36:40,446 --> 00:36:42,913
Thank you very much.

677
00:36:42,915 --> 00:36:45,583
( Megan laughing )
Oh, my God, really?

678
00:36:45,585 --> 00:36:47,551
Harry:
Oh, a negro homosexual,

679
00:36:47,553 --> 00:36:50,054
a Canadian sexpot
and unaccompanied redhead.

680
00:36:50,056 --> 00:36:52,456
I think this may be
my key demographic.

681
00:36:54,958 --> 00:36:56,993
Hello.

682
00:36:56,995 --> 00:37:00,329
Don't.
Just leave it alone.

683
00:37:00,331 --> 00:37:03,598
I know. You're wondering
what they're laughing about.

684
00:37:04,967 --> 00:37:07,135
It's not you.

685
00:37:18,514 --> 00:37:20,749
Well, I for one think
you're very brave, Megan.

686
00:37:20,751 --> 00:37:22,650
My mother always said

687
00:37:22,652 --> 00:37:25,554
a woman should surprise
her husband every day.

688
00:37:25,556 --> 00:37:28,556
That's why they had
no lock on the WC.

689
00:37:28,558 --> 00:37:30,559
It's true.

690
00:37:33,495 --> 00:37:34,762
Look at you delivering drinks.

691
00:37:34,764 --> 00:37:36,398
We should get you
a pair of roller skates.

692
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,966
Roger, I didn't know
you were invited.

693
00:37:37,968 --> 00:37:40,502
Or did you just hear
I was coming and show up?

694
00:37:42,838 --> 00:37:44,839
- Is he going bald?
- ( Chuckles )

695
00:37:46,342 --> 00:37:48,676
( Laughs )

696
00:37:52,048 --> 00:37:54,116
It just goes on and on.

697
00:37:54,118 --> 00:37:56,152
It's beautiful,
but it's very loud.

698
00:37:56,154 --> 00:37:58,588
Listen, you can hear the
traffic even over this party.

699
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:00,456
I know.

700
00:38:00,458 --> 00:38:02,225
Who cares?
I just want to take my pants off

701
00:38:02,227 --> 00:38:04,928
and slide my ass
on the carpeting.

702
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:07,063
How's the summer treating you?

703
00:38:07,065 --> 00:38:09,231
Well, it's been good
because it's been bad.

704
00:38:09,233 --> 00:38:11,767
- What do you do exactly?
- He's a journalist.

705
00:38:11,769 --> 00:38:14,303
Underground papers mostly.

706
00:38:14,305 --> 00:38:16,071
You may not have seen it.

707
00:38:16,073 --> 00:38:18,373
And what exactly has been bad?

708
00:38:18,375 --> 00:38:21,509
Well, I don't know.
Four riots in three cities in two months.

709
00:38:21,511 --> 00:38:24,412
It is terrible.

710
00:38:24,414 --> 00:38:27,516
And lord knows the police
aren't much help.

711
00:38:27,518 --> 00:38:30,686
I was raised sex, politics, and
religion aren't party talk.

712
00:38:30,688 --> 00:38:32,588
Well, what does that leave?

713
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:35,124
I don't know.
Alcohol and work?

714
00:38:35,126 --> 00:38:36,960
Mmm.

715
00:38:36,962 --> 00:38:38,295
Hello again.

716
00:38:38,297 --> 00:38:40,698
Trudes, which one
is Jane Sterling again?

717
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:43,701
Mm, the glamour puss
with the tan.

718
00:38:45,971 --> 00:38:47,972
Marry early and often.

719
00:38:50,175 --> 00:38:52,943
We're thinking about smoking some
tea with Megan's friends out there.

720
00:38:52,945 --> 00:38:54,211
Will you keep
an eye out for Don?

721
00:38:54,213 --> 00:38:55,980
As long as you're
just thinking about it.

722
00:38:55,982 --> 00:38:57,248
You should join us.

723
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:59,183
Kenny gets brave
and recites poems.

724
00:38:59,185 --> 00:39:01,252
And she thinks they're good.

725
00:39:08,737 --> 00:39:09,937
Oh, absolutely.

726
00:39:09,939 --> 00:39:11,906
Megan was the best
waitress they ever had.

727
00:39:11,908 --> 00:39:14,041
No, but I did get
the best tips.

728
00:39:14,043 --> 00:39:16,677
- How did you manage that?
- She laid on that accent.

729
00:39:16,679 --> 00:39:18,679
You know, she's
a really good actress.

730
00:39:18,681 --> 00:39:21,415
Not good enough, obviously.

731
00:39:21,417 --> 00:39:24,051
- Man: <i>Julia, come here for a second.</i>
<i>- Hello there.</i>

732
00:39:24,053 --> 00:39:25,820
Hello.

733
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:28,456
- Glad you could come.
- Great party.

734
00:39:28,458 --> 00:39:30,558
You got a great spread here.

735
00:39:34,263 --> 00:39:36,364
I just wanted to
make sure we said hi.

736
00:39:36,366 --> 00:39:39,700
I can't stay that long.
I have to go back and redo the Heinz pitch.

737
00:39:41,703 --> 00:39:43,904
But I guess you know that.

738
00:39:46,974 --> 00:39:48,942
Come on, Don.

739
00:39:52,146 --> 00:39:53,846
What are you doing?

740
00:39:53,848 --> 00:39:56,049
Was that bad?

741
00:39:56,051 --> 00:39:59,085
Hell, look who you're talking to.
How do I know?

742
00:40:02,623 --> 00:40:04,057
Okay, everyone.

743
00:40:04,059 --> 00:40:06,560
- My friends.
- ( Band stops playing )

744
00:40:06,562 --> 00:40:09,096
First of all, I wanted to
thank you all for coming.

745
00:40:09,098 --> 00:40:10,731
And second of all,

746
00:40:10,733 --> 00:40:12,867
I think I've had
just enough to drink

747
00:40:12,869 --> 00:40:15,570
that I'm ready to give my own
present to the birthday boy.

748
00:40:15,572 --> 00:40:17,906
All:
Oooh!

749
00:40:17,908 --> 00:40:19,408
Thank you.
Thank you all for coming.

750
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:21,143
I think we should
call it a night.

751
00:40:21,145 --> 00:40:24,146
Absolutely not, Don.

752
00:40:24,148 --> 00:40:26,783
You stay there.

753
00:40:26,785 --> 00:40:29,686
- Did you buy him a pony?
- ( Laughing )

754
00:40:36,226 --> 00:40:37,927
<i>Un, deux, trois, quatre.</i>

755
00:40:37,929 --> 00:40:41,130
<i>( Band playing )</i>

756
00:40:51,507 --> 00:40:55,744
( Singing in French )

757
00:41:31,415 --> 00:41:33,617
<i>Oui, oui!</i>
<i>Oui!</i>

758
00:41:50,203 --> 00:41:52,437
<i>( Guests cheer )</i>

759
00:42:19,229 --> 00:42:21,730
( Song ends )

760
00:42:21,732 --> 00:42:23,065
Happy Birthday, baby.

761
00:42:23,067 --> 00:42:25,401
( Cheering, whistling )

762
00:42:30,874 --> 00:42:32,575
Why don't you sing like that?

763
00:42:32,577 --> 00:42:34,677
Why don't you look like him?

764
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:43,551
( Clinking )

765
00:42:43,553 --> 00:42:46,721
- <i>Je m'appelle</i> Roger.
- ( Guests laugh )

766
00:42:46,723 --> 00:42:50,057
- If I may raise a glass.
- Happy Birthday, Don!

767
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:53,127
( Chuckles )
As I was saying--

768
00:42:53,129 --> 00:42:55,062
to Megan

769
00:42:55,064 --> 00:42:57,165
for letting us see
the Don Draper smile

770
00:42:57,167 --> 00:42:59,234
usually reserved for clients.

771
00:42:59,236 --> 00:43:01,103
Hear, hear!

772
00:43:01,105 --> 00:43:05,241
And to Don,
you lucky so and so.

773
00:43:07,578 --> 00:43:09,813
As a wise man once said,
the only thing worse

774
00:43:09,815 --> 00:43:13,784
than not getting what you want
is someone else getting it.

775
00:43:19,925 --> 00:43:22,060
Okay, now, no one has
called and complained,

776
00:43:22,062 --> 00:43:25,730
so there's no reason
everyone shouldn't dance.

777
00:43:25,732 --> 00:43:29,233
<i>( Band playing )</i>

778
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,354
I should probably clean up.

779
00:43:49,356 --> 00:43:51,289
Leave it for the girl.

780
00:43:51,291 --> 00:43:53,058
She doesn't come till Monday.

781
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:56,295
Call her and have
her come tomorrow.

782
00:43:56,297 --> 00:43:57,896
And Monday.

783
00:43:57,898 --> 00:44:00,599
Problem solved.

784
00:44:00,601 --> 00:44:02,701
Did you have fun?

785
00:44:04,237 --> 00:44:06,137
Move over.

786
00:44:06,139 --> 00:44:08,206
No, I just want to sleep.

787
00:44:08,208 --> 00:44:10,875
Oh, come on.
I know you had a good time.

788
00:44:10,877 --> 00:44:13,077
I can see it.

789
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:15,746
I don't want to talk.
I just want to go to sleep.

790
00:44:15,748 --> 00:44:17,614
Hey.

791
00:44:23,988 --> 00:44:26,122
( Sighs )

792
00:44:26,124 --> 00:44:28,758
Don't waste money
on things like that.

793
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:31,094
It was my money

794
00:44:31,096 --> 00:44:33,496
and you don't get to
decide what I do with it.

795
00:44:33,498 --> 00:44:37,434
Well, cod you please not
use it to embarrass me again?

796
00:44:40,272 --> 00:44:41,572
What?

797
00:44:41,574 --> 00:44:43,508
I know why you're upset.

798
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:45,310
You're 40.

799
00:44:45,312 --> 00:44:46,511
I've been 40 for half a year.

800
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:52,485
This is your birthday now.

801
00:44:52,487 --> 00:44:56,289
Fine, I don't like my birthday.

802
00:44:58,025 --> 00:45:00,126
I told you, I never had it
when I was growing up

803
00:45:00,128 --> 00:45:03,697
and I've never wanted it since.

804
00:45:03,699 --> 00:45:06,166
You never had a birthday?

805
00:45:06,168 --> 00:45:08,301
Didn't Betty ever
throw you a party?

806
00:45:08,303 --> 00:45:10,036
No, because I forbid it.

807
00:45:10,038 --> 00:45:12,171
( Laughs ) Why?

808
00:45:12,173 --> 00:45:14,640
I don't need to be
the center of attention.

809
00:45:14,642 --> 00:45:17,643
You love attention.

810
00:45:17,645 --> 00:45:20,680
You twitched every time
I talked to another person.

811
00:45:20,682 --> 00:45:22,148
( Sighs )

812
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:25,085
More people feel the way
I do than the way you do.

813
00:45:25,087 --> 00:45:27,722
Where's your research?

814
00:45:30,259 --> 00:45:32,360
Fine, I'm 40.

815
00:45:33,763 --> 00:45:35,230
It's too late.

816
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:38,167
Aw.

817
00:45:38,169 --> 00:45:41,470
Nobody loves Dick Whitman.

818
00:45:41,472 --> 00:45:43,673
I love you.

819
00:45:43,675 --> 00:45:46,075
That's why I threw you a party.

820
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,385
I'm going to sleep.
