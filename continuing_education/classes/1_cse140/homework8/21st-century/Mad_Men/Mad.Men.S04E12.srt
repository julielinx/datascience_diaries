1
00:00:00,661 --> 00:00:03,018
Previously on AMC's Mad Men...

2
00:00:03,194 --> 00:00:04,635
I think it'd be helpful

3
00:00:04,786 --> 00:00:06,603
if you and I were to meet once a month

4
00:00:06,722 --> 00:00:08,880
just to, you know,
keep up with Sally's progress.

5
00:00:09,607 --> 00:00:12,238
I hate it here. I really really do.

6
00:00:13,023 --> 00:00:14,023
I won't tell anybody.

7
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:16,383
I don't have to live
with your shit over my head.

8
00:00:17,841 --> 00:00:20,256
- What's going on?
- We lost Lucky Strike.

9
00:00:21,176 --> 00:00:25,024
I got you a meeting with Heinz. They're
at Ketchum McLeod and they're restless.

10
00:00:25,238 --> 00:00:26,144
You didn't have to do this.

11
00:00:28,569 --> 00:00:29,730
I wanted to.

12
00:00:56,233 --> 00:00:59,378
Sync by n17t01, corrected by gloriabg

13
00:01:07,898 --> 00:01:09,899
First I want to assure you

14
00:01:09,967 --> 00:01:12,268
that no one at my agency
knows about this meeting.

15
00:01:12,336 --> 00:01:14,437
- I appreciate that.
- I'm here to help.

16
00:01:15,739 --> 00:01:17,640
I have my own thoughts, but

17
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:21,377
how would you describe your...

18
00:01:21,445 --> 00:01:24,280
Well, your current frustrations?

19
00:01:24,348 --> 00:01:28,151
During the war, Heinz was all about beans,

20
00:01:28,219 --> 00:01:30,086
but now, obviously, ketchup is king.

21
00:01:30,154 --> 00:01:33,623
I'm happy for the company, but I'm afraid
we've become the fading older sister.

22
00:01:35,626 --> 00:01:39,629
So ketchup, chili sauce and
soup end up over at D.D.B.

23
00:01:39,697 --> 00:01:42,298
And vinegar, sauces and beans
end up at Ketchum Macleod.

24
00:01:42,366 --> 00:01:44,133
I don't know why I'm disappointed,

25
00:01:44,201 --> 00:01:47,537
I asked for straightforward.
I just thought they would talk me out of it.

26
00:01:47,605 --> 00:01:50,507
They obviously don't know
what kind of client you are.

27
00:01:50,574 --> 00:01:54,244
Well, I've been working a long time.

28
00:01:54,311 --> 00:01:57,580
I know that despite
the public's imagination

29
00:01:57,648 --> 00:02:00,650
food is cyclical. I don't mean seasonal.

30
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:03,219
But I mean literally
there's a time for beans

31
00:02:03,287 --> 00:02:04,787
and there's a time for ketchup.

32
00:02:04,855 --> 00:02:07,257
But I don't have that time,

33
00:02:07,324 --> 00:02:09,325
so I want to force the issue...

34
00:02:09,393 --> 00:02:11,027
You know, something inventive.

35
00:02:11,095 --> 00:02:13,863
Humor worked with pickles,
but pickles are funny.

36
00:02:13,931 --> 00:02:15,932
The way beans are funny,
we can't use that.

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,600
We have to fight it, actually.

38
00:02:17,668 --> 00:02:19,969
Well, it's very possible

39
00:02:20,037 --> 00:02:21,771
that Heinz beans don't need to be funny,

40
00:02:21,839 --> 00:02:24,207
because they're a food, not a condiment.

41
00:02:24,275 --> 00:02:27,777
- They're substantial.
- You know, I'd love to have that conversation.

42
00:02:27,845 --> 00:02:29,812
And the reason I agreed to meet with you is

43
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,614
because I hoped it would spark something,

44
00:02:31,682 --> 00:02:35,318
and maybe six to eight months from now
you can call me with a humdinger.

45
00:02:35,386 --> 00:02:37,687
How about six days?

46
00:02:37,755 --> 00:02:40,456
No. No, this is my point.

47
00:02:40,524 --> 00:02:43,693
I want to move, but there's
a lot that goes with it.

48
00:02:43,761 --> 00:02:45,962
There's a breaking-in period...
That's months.

49
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:48,464
- That's true but...
- I'm sorry to be so blunt,

50
00:02:50,467 --> 00:02:53,403
but I don't know that your company
will be here in six months.

51
00:02:54,672 --> 00:02:55,939
I do.

52
00:02:56,006 --> 00:02:58,408
That's what I'm hoping.

53
00:02:58,475 --> 00:03:00,810
That's why my answer is not "no",

54
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:03,580
it's just "not now".

55
00:03:03,647 --> 00:03:06,282
So where's the harm in coming
in and hearing some ideas?

56
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:09,686
Because I can't afford to move my business

57
00:03:09,753 --> 00:03:12,522
a third time in two years. I just can't.

58
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:17,026
- I see.
- So that's where we are.

59
00:03:17,094 --> 00:03:18,861
Hold on.

60
00:03:18,929 --> 00:03:21,064
Raymond, I will have an exciting idea.

61
00:03:21,131 --> 00:03:22,465
I happen to know that.

62
00:03:24,335 --> 00:03:26,903
Would a discounted commission
make up for the break-in period?

63
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:31,741
I bet I could get a date
with your mother right now.

64
00:03:33,177 --> 00:03:35,845
Well, you can see why
I don't want to let this go.

65
00:03:35,913 --> 00:03:38,881
Look, Don, you're a hell of an idea man,

66
00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:41,618
but let the account boys do this part.

67
00:03:43,887 --> 00:03:46,222
I wish you the best of luck.

68
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:48,358
Thank you.
It was really great to meet you.

69
00:03:57,401 --> 00:03:59,402
Excuse me, waiter.

70
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:01,304
Sally, Bobby!

71
00:04:13,384 --> 00:04:14,817
You're filthy.

72
00:04:17,821 --> 00:04:19,689
Can I take it away from him?

73
00:04:19,757 --> 00:04:21,658
The spoon or the screaming...  Take your pick.

74
00:04:24,928 --> 00:04:26,362
I want two hot dogs.

75
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:28,264
Your eyes are bigger than your stomach.

76
00:04:28,332 --> 00:04:30,166
How come we never eat with Henry?

77
00:04:30,234 --> 00:04:31,901
First of all, he works until late

78
00:04:31,969 --> 00:04:33,703
and you're always saying "I'm hungry".

79
00:04:33,771 --> 00:04:35,505
Second of all, you don't eat the same food.

80
00:04:35,572 --> 00:04:37,106
I'll try new food.

81
00:04:38,442 --> 00:04:40,209
Would you like to eat with Henry?

82
00:04:40,277 --> 00:04:42,512
Why don't Bobby and Gene eat first

83
00:04:42,579 --> 00:04:44,013
and I'll wait to eat with you and Henry?

84
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:46,949
Okay.

85
00:04:47,017 --> 00:04:48,651
Let me think about it.

86
00:04:48,719 --> 00:04:50,353
Okay.

87
00:04:52,022 --> 00:04:54,624
You're paying me to assess your situation,

88
00:04:54,692 --> 00:04:57,527
but I could've told you
from three blocks away

89
00:04:57,594 --> 00:05:00,396
that signing new business
no matter what the size

90
00:05:00,464 --> 00:05:02,131
is of the essence.

91
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:05,501
Not only because your
billings have shrunk by 50%,

92
00:05:05,569 --> 00:05:08,371
but because there's not much
time before you'll be perceived

93
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:09,739
as stagnant...

94
00:05:09,807 --> 00:05:11,841
Worse, decaying.

95
00:05:11,909 --> 00:05:15,044
Listen, doctor, we know there's
a black spot on the X-ray.

96
00:05:15,112 --> 00:05:16,746
You don't have to keep
tapping your finger on it.

97
00:05:16,814 --> 00:05:19,849
I recommend that you do what you do best...

98
00:05:19,917 --> 00:05:23,419
Cigarettes. You understand the F.T.C.

99
00:05:23,487 --> 00:05:24,821
You understand the surgeon general.

100
00:05:24,888 --> 00:05:26,489
You have a team in place

101
00:05:26,557 --> 00:05:29,525
with account management and media expertise

102
00:05:29,593 --> 00:05:31,160
which is up and running.

103
00:05:31,228 --> 00:05:33,763
And, of course, you have Don.

104
00:05:33,831 --> 00:05:36,032
You are a certain kind of girl,

105
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:40,069
and tobacco is your ideal boyfriend.

106
00:05:40,137 --> 00:05:43,406
Can you get us a date?

107
00:05:43,474 --> 00:05:46,175
Philip Morris is introducing
a new brand for young women,

108
00:05:46,243 --> 00:05:48,845
hoping to have it
on the market in 18 months,

109
00:05:48,912 --> 00:05:51,714
and they'd like a new agency
on it from the ground floor.

110
00:05:51,782 --> 00:05:54,984
- How much is it?
- Close to $5 million.

111
00:05:55,052 --> 00:05:56,753
It's a start.

112
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,588
Wonderful.

113
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:01,491
And what stage of the process
has your influence bought us?

114
00:06:01,558 --> 00:06:03,392
A meeting.

115
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,328
No one else has one.

116
00:06:05,395 --> 00:06:08,431
We will listen more than we will speak.

117
00:06:08,499 --> 00:06:10,900
Like a good girlfriend.

118
00:06:10,968 --> 00:06:13,803
- Sounds great.
- I concur.

119
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:19,976
All I'm saying is we should be going
after something as big as what we had.

120
00:06:20,043 --> 00:06:22,211
It'd cost a fortune to pursue

121
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:23,379
when one is in review.

122
00:06:23,447 --> 00:06:25,681
They're impossible to pry away.

123
00:06:25,749 --> 00:06:27,850
Our day-to-day payroll will be beyond us

124
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:29,519
by the next billing cycle.

125
00:06:29,586 --> 00:06:32,655
We should start
thinking about reducing staff

126
00:06:32,723 --> 00:06:34,357
and subletting the square footage.

127
00:06:34,424 --> 00:06:35,424
Why even have an office?

128
00:06:35,492 --> 00:06:38,060
Why don't we just work out of a cab?

129
00:06:38,128 --> 00:06:39,629
And where does that leave me?

130
00:06:39,696 --> 00:06:41,030
Trying to get my calls returned

131
00:06:41,098 --> 00:06:43,132
with all the buying power
of Secor Laxative?

132
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,134
We gave him Don and a finder's fee.

133
00:06:45,202 --> 00:06:48,271
- He should've aimed higher.
- I just left Geyer for this.

134
00:06:48,338 --> 00:06:49,972
Do you think those clients
are in love with me?

135
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,507
I'm getting married in October!

136
00:06:51,575 --> 00:06:53,176
It's gonna be "barefoot in the park."

137
00:06:53,243 --> 00:06:54,844
These things go in streaks.

138
00:06:54,912 --> 00:06:56,646
And Don Draper with a cigarette company?

139
00:06:56,713 --> 00:06:59,448
We get this vote of confidence
and we move from there.

140
00:06:59,516 --> 00:07:01,818
Marlboro was their women's cigarette.

141
00:07:03,821 --> 00:07:05,855
Well, they certainly ran away
from that in the right direction.

142
00:07:07,858 --> 00:07:11,460
You know, beans, vinegars and
sauces was very impressed.

143
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:14,964
Thank you for that,

144
00:07:15,032 --> 00:07:16,933
but thank you much more for this.

145
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,801
This is what I was hoping for.

146
00:07:18,869 --> 00:07:21,504
Good. Geoff's excited.

147
00:07:21,572 --> 00:07:23,472
Study up.

148
00:07:28,245 --> 00:07:32,014
I have dinner plans but call me tonight,

149
00:07:32,082 --> 00:07:33,950
even if it's just to work.

150
00:07:38,689 --> 00:07:41,724
It's a summer practice helmet.
It's not as good.

151
00:07:41,792 --> 00:07:43,626
It smells.

152
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,431
Well, you're there all the time.

153
00:07:48,498 --> 00:07:51,200
- What do you talk about?
- Didn't you go?

154
00:07:51,268 --> 00:07:53,402
Yeah, but psychiatrists are easy to fool.

155
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:55,504
Dr. Edna's smart.

156
00:07:55,572 --> 00:07:57,540
She tell you to kiss your mom's ass?

157
00:07:57,608 --> 00:07:59,408
No.

158
00:07:59,476 --> 00:08:01,444
So who's smarter, me or her?

159
00:08:04,882 --> 00:08:06,515
You want one?

160
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:08,184
No.

161
00:08:10,787 --> 00:08:12,521
Do you talk to your mom about me?

162
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:15,892
I did and I don't anymore.

163
00:08:18,195 --> 00:08:20,529
She doesn't like me.

164
00:08:20,597 --> 00:08:23,366
She thinks... She doesn't like kids.

165
00:08:23,433 --> 00:08:25,668
That's not true.

166
00:08:25,736 --> 00:08:27,803
You're the one who's always
saying how mean she is.

167
00:08:27,871 --> 00:08:29,472
So what?

168
00:08:38,181 --> 00:08:40,216
- I've gotta go.
- Okay.

169
00:08:42,619 --> 00:08:44,186
See you later, alligator.

170
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:50,793
Don.

171
00:08:56,967 --> 00:08:58,801
Midge.

172
00:09:05,275 --> 00:09:07,209
I just came out from a meeting

173
00:09:07,277 --> 00:09:09,612
at a magazine related to time life

174
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,348
and I saw this dashing figure.

175
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:15,184
Where are you going with so much purpose?

176
00:09:15,252 --> 00:09:18,654
Home. You look good.

177
00:09:18,722 --> 00:09:22,224
I'm skinny. Starving artist.

178
00:09:22,292 --> 00:09:24,560
- Did you move here?
- Yes.

179
00:09:24,628 --> 00:09:27,997
Well, I have my own firm now.

180
00:09:28,065 --> 00:09:30,366
Ooh. Draper, Draper & Draper?

181
00:09:30,434 --> 00:09:32,435
Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce.

182
00:09:32,502 --> 00:09:35,104
Well, it sounds impressive.

183
00:09:35,172 --> 00:09:38,341
There are good days and bad
days like anything else.

184
00:09:38,408 --> 00:09:39,809
So you wouldn't happen to need

185
00:09:39,876 --> 00:09:41,911
any freelance artists, would you?

186
00:09:41,979 --> 00:09:43,479
I wish I could help right now.

187
00:09:43,547 --> 00:09:45,614
Maybe in six months.

188
00:09:45,682 --> 00:09:47,850
You can use me as a reference.

189
00:09:47,918 --> 00:09:49,685
Really?

190
00:09:51,254 --> 00:09:52,788
I thought I would've run
into you in the Village.

191
00:09:54,691 --> 00:09:56,425
I'm always expecting
to see you in the park.

192
00:09:56,493 --> 00:09:59,395
What are you doing in the Village?

193
00:09:59,463 --> 00:10:01,964
Admiring the wildlife?

194
00:10:02,032 --> 00:10:04,800
I live there, on Waverly.

195
00:10:06,003 --> 00:10:07,403
Oh.

196
00:10:07,471 --> 00:10:09,805
Yeah.

197
00:10:09,873 --> 00:10:12,908
So what's the rush to go home?

198
00:10:12,976 --> 00:10:14,577
Come over.

199
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,648
I have a big meeting tomorrow.
Maybe some other time.

200
00:10:19,716 --> 00:10:21,350
Not even to meet my husband?

201
00:10:23,387 --> 00:10:26,288
- Really?
- We, it's not romantic.

202
00:10:26,356 --> 00:10:28,791
We just got married for the bread.

203
00:10:28,859 --> 00:10:32,595
We'll eat. You'll buy a painting.

204
00:10:32,662 --> 00:10:34,663
I'll cheer you up.

205
00:10:37,801 --> 00:10:40,369
Look, I lost my purse.
At least give me a ride downtown.

206
00:10:43,974 --> 00:10:45,474
Okay.

207
00:10:49,846 --> 00:10:51,981
I told her I brushed my teeth,

208
00:10:52,049 --> 00:10:54,283
but she said I still
smelled like spaghetti.

209
00:10:54,351 --> 00:10:55,851
And what did you do?

210
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:58,387
I brushed my teeth again.

211
00:10:58,455 --> 00:11:00,356
And what did she do?

212
00:11:00,424 --> 00:11:02,525
She doesn't care what the truth is

213
00:11:02,592 --> 00:11:04,960
as long as I do what she says.

214
00:11:05,028 --> 00:11:06,762
Got any sevens?

215
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:09,198
Nope. Go fish.

216
00:11:11,435 --> 00:11:14,170
- I hate sevens.
- Why?

217
00:11:15,338 --> 00:11:17,373
I just do.

218
00:11:18,675 --> 00:11:20,209
You know, I'm very proud

219
00:11:20,277 --> 00:11:22,778
of how you found a way to behave so well,

220
00:11:22,846 --> 00:11:25,314
even when you get so angry
at your mother sometimes.

221
00:11:26,917 --> 00:11:30,019
It's hard to control ourselves
when we get so angry.

222
00:11:30,087 --> 00:11:32,988
She just doesn't know that I'm mad.

223
00:11:33,056 --> 00:11:35,357
As long as you know it.

224
00:11:35,425 --> 00:11:39,462
I told you your mom acts that
way because she has stresses,

225
00:11:39,529 --> 00:11:42,898
not because you're bad or
that you did anything wrong.

226
00:11:42,966 --> 00:11:44,233
I know.

227
00:11:46,837 --> 00:11:50,206
- Do you have any aces?
- No, go fish.

228
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:55,277
So now that you're back in school,

229
00:11:55,345 --> 00:11:57,613
we probably should be seeing a
little less of each other...

230
00:11:57,681 --> 00:12:01,550
Just one day a week...
So that you can ride your bike,

231
00:12:01,618 --> 00:12:05,054
be with your friends
and be in the ballet recital.

232
00:12:05,122 --> 00:12:06,555
Okay.

233
00:12:08,925 --> 00:12:10,226
Do you have any threes?

234
00:12:14,564 --> 00:12:16,432
I said I'm very proud of you.

235
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,801
Did you hear that?

236
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:26,275
Do you have any Jacks?

237
00:12:35,576 --> 00:12:37,477
Perry, we have company.

238
00:12:39,179 --> 00:12:41,814
- This is my friend Don.
- Perry. Nice to meet you.

239
00:12:41,882 --> 00:12:43,716
- Sorry to drop in.
- Oh no.

240
00:12:43,784 --> 00:12:45,485
Why don't you offer Don a drink?

241
00:12:45,552 --> 00:12:48,321
- Uh, sure.
- Don, what are you gonna have?

242
00:12:48,388 --> 00:12:50,356
I have...

243
00:12:51,592 --> 00:12:53,226
Vodka or brown.

244
00:12:53,293 --> 00:12:55,561
- Whiskey's good.
- Good.

245
00:12:55,629 --> 00:12:57,730
Good. I'll get a couple of glasses.

246
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:04,337
- So you're a playwright?
- When we met, I said he looked like Brendan Behan.

247
00:13:04,404 --> 00:13:06,639
You said Dylan Thomas.

248
00:13:12,146 --> 00:13:13,379
Here we go.

249
00:13:14,548 --> 00:13:15,882
To welcome company.

250
00:13:21,121 --> 00:13:22,088
Ah.

251
00:13:23,724 --> 00:13:26,392
Let me go freshen up and make
sure we have toilet paper.

252
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:32,465
So, Don, let me open
your eyes for a minute.

253
00:13:32,533 --> 00:13:33,766
Come here.

254
00:13:41,608 --> 00:13:43,409
Can you believe this?

255
00:13:44,912 --> 00:13:47,113
- What's it called?
- "Number four."

256
00:13:47,181 --> 00:13:50,583
The whole thing is about what she
sees when she closes her eyes.

257
00:13:50,651 --> 00:13:51,851
It's part of this thing that she's doing.

258
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:53,319
It's called an afterimage.

259
00:13:53,387 --> 00:13:54,754
What's more real?

260
00:13:54,822 --> 00:13:56,756
It's nice.

261
00:13:56,824 --> 00:13:59,725
You know, I have a price list somewhere.

262
00:13:59,793 --> 00:14:01,661
Of course, you know,
whatever you're willing to pay.

263
00:14:01,728 --> 00:14:03,863
I mean, I know she'd love
for you to have one.

264
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,134
Let me think about it.

265
00:14:09,436 --> 00:14:11,270
You know,

266
00:14:11,338 --> 00:14:13,706
it's not hard to see things
are a little tough around here,

267
00:14:13,774 --> 00:14:16,976
but she digs you.

268
00:14:17,044 --> 00:14:19,445
And I could tell you

269
00:14:19,513 --> 00:14:21,147
she'd do anything if you bought one.

270
00:14:23,016 --> 00:14:24,650
You're sure about that?

271
00:14:24,718 --> 00:14:26,786
We're not possessive,

272
00:14:26,854 --> 00:14:29,989
and you should've heard how excited
she was when she tracked you down.

273
00:14:30,057 --> 00:14:31,357
What?

274
00:14:33,627 --> 00:14:35,494
You know, the look on her face when

275
00:14:35,562 --> 00:14:36,796
she walked in here with you.

276
00:14:39,933 --> 00:14:42,435
I knew I shouldn't have left you two alone.

277
00:14:42,502 --> 00:14:44,604
Are you kidding?
We're getting along famously.

278
00:14:44,671 --> 00:14:47,640
You know what?
I'm gonna get some groceries

279
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:49,208
and whip up a great meal.

280
00:14:50,711 --> 00:14:53,713
Oh. Midge?

281
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:56,515
- Honey?
- She lost her purse.

282
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:59,218
Oh, right.

283
00:14:59,286 --> 00:15:01,454
Don, don't.

284
00:15:01,521 --> 00:15:03,389
My father owned a restaurant.

285
00:15:03,457 --> 00:15:05,458
I can make chicken cordon bleu.

286
00:15:05,525 --> 00:15:07,526
Here. How about that?

287
00:15:09,997 --> 00:15:11,464
$10?

288
00:15:12,766 --> 00:15:14,700
Well, okay.

289
00:15:14,768 --> 00:15:16,636
You two sit tight.

290
00:15:16,703 --> 00:15:18,537
I'll be right back.

291
00:15:28,482 --> 00:15:30,383
- He's very interesting.
- He's an idiot.

292
00:15:31,852 --> 00:15:33,586
He's just gonna go out
and put that in his arm.

293
00:15:35,856 --> 00:15:37,723
And you could've gotten
so much more from me.

294
00:15:39,059 --> 00:15:40,593
That's why you tracked me down

295
00:15:40,661 --> 00:15:42,995
like James Bond.

296
00:15:43,063 --> 00:15:45,831
Oh God.

297
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:47,900
He's such an idiot.

298
00:15:51,672 --> 00:15:53,906
I just wanted you to buy a painting.

299
00:15:56,576 --> 00:15:58,144
I swear.

300
00:16:05,285 --> 00:16:06,886
What's it like?

301
00:16:09,022 --> 00:16:11,390
It's like

302
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:14,360
drinking 100 bottles of whiskey

303
00:16:14,428 --> 00:16:16,595
while someone licks your tits.

304
00:16:19,566 --> 00:16:21,334
I can see it's very good.

305
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:26,706
He said it would help me
take my mind off my work.

306
00:16:28,075 --> 00:16:30,710
Turns out it's a full-time job.

307
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:33,646
Why don't you stop?

308
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:38,217
I know it's bad for me, but...

309
00:16:39,386 --> 00:16:41,654
It's heroin, Don.

310
00:16:44,191 --> 00:16:46,459
I just can't stop.

311
00:16:50,464 --> 00:16:52,164
I am glad

312
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,068
to see you, you know?

313
00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:10,883
I...

314
00:17:10,951 --> 00:17:13,185
This is $300.

315
00:17:15,989 --> 00:17:18,991
You know, for "number four" over there.

316
00:17:19,059 --> 00:17:20,526
Oh.

317
00:17:22,462 --> 00:17:24,196
Don.

318
00:17:24,264 --> 00:17:27,733
What am I gonna do with a check?

319
00:17:41,982 --> 00:17:43,582
Here's $120 in cash.

320
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,534
Do you think my work's any good?

321
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:05,404
It doesn't matter.

322
00:18:10,444 --> 00:18:12,144
You know, I don't even have car fare.

323
00:18:12,212 --> 00:18:14,113
You can walk across the park.

324
00:18:14,181 --> 00:18:16,982
Do some advertising for me.

325
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:19,185
Like a sandwich board.

326
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,929
It's really great to see you, Don.

327
00:18:36,837 --> 00:18:38,737
I'm glad you haven't changed.

328
00:18:46,413 --> 00:18:48,547
It was the way he slammed
the car door like that.

329
00:18:48,615 --> 00:18:50,349
It was so dismissive.

330
00:18:50,417 --> 00:18:52,084
It reminded me of Don,

331
00:18:52,152 --> 00:18:54,954
but of course it wasn't.

332
00:18:55,021 --> 00:18:56,889
When I confronted him later,

333
00:18:56,957 --> 00:18:58,891
it turned out he hadn't heard me.

334
00:18:58,959 --> 00:19:01,460
That's what he said, anyway.

335
00:19:01,528 --> 00:19:03,996
Well, you learned something, didn't you?

336
00:19:05,699 --> 00:19:06,866
I did.

337
00:19:08,568 --> 00:19:10,569
Our time is almost up,

338
00:19:10,637 --> 00:19:12,571
so I thought that I should tell you that

339
00:19:12,639 --> 00:19:15,274
I believe Sally has made wonderful progress

340
00:19:15,342 --> 00:19:17,510
and that I'd like to reduce her sessions

341
00:19:17,577 --> 00:19:19,245
to once a week and see where we are.

342
00:19:21,748 --> 00:19:23,115
So she's cured?

343
00:19:24,718 --> 00:19:27,119
She's not better.

344
00:19:27,187 --> 00:19:30,556
- She ran away.
- And she understands what she did was wrong

345
00:19:30,624 --> 00:19:32,892
and she's been very responsible since.

346
00:19:32,959 --> 00:19:34,827
Her life is chaotic

347
00:19:34,895 --> 00:19:37,897
and I'm afraid of her
losing this influence.

348
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,701
I've noticed that every
time you come in here

349
00:19:42,769 --> 00:19:45,404
you have many things on your mind.

350
00:19:45,472 --> 00:19:49,341
And I feel that you
should have your own time

351
00:19:49,409 --> 00:19:52,545
where you get to say
everything you want to say.

352
00:19:52,612 --> 00:19:54,947
I have a very talented colleague,

353
00:19:55,015 --> 00:19:57,416
Dr. Evelyn Shapiro, whom I can recommend.

354
00:19:57,484 --> 00:19:59,451
Why can't I talk to you?

355
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:01,787
Betty, you can talk to me

356
00:20:01,855 --> 00:20:03,722
but, you know,

357
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:06,926
I'm a child psychiatrist.

358
00:20:06,993 --> 00:20:10,362
Well, I don't need a psychiatrist.

359
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:11,764
I just...

360
00:20:13,433 --> 00:20:16,168
Obviously I'm willing to do
whatever you recommend

361
00:20:16,236 --> 00:20:19,171
as Sally progresses.

362
00:20:19,239 --> 00:20:21,373
And I would hope,

363
00:20:21,441 --> 00:20:22,975
of course,

364
00:20:23,043 --> 00:20:25,744
that if she continues to make progress

365
00:20:25,812 --> 00:20:28,480
that we could continue to discuss that.

366
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,421
Of course.

367
00:20:36,823 --> 00:20:39,191
So I'll keep you in the books for next month.

368
00:20:39,259 --> 00:20:41,460
If you think so.

369
00:20:51,688 --> 00:20:53,522
Peter Piper picked a peck
of pickled peppers.

370
00:20:56,226 --> 00:20:59,228
Red leather, yellow leather,
red leather, yellow leather.

371
00:20:59,296 --> 00:21:01,564
You wanted to see me?

372
00:21:01,631 --> 00:21:03,265
I did. Did you do all the reading?

373
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:05,000
- Yes.
- If strategy comes up...

374
00:21:05,068 --> 00:21:06,602
And it usually doesn't at this point...

375
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:09,004
What do you think they think the
strength is of this product?

376
00:21:09,072 --> 00:21:11,340
Well, as you know, it's pointless

377
00:21:11,408 --> 00:21:13,776
to get women to switch from
men's brands... Nobody switches.

378
00:21:15,946 --> 00:21:17,980
They're probably looking for a new
way to give 'em out for free.

379
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:23,118
Sorry to interrupt. Mr. Draper,
Dr. Atherton is on his way up,

380
00:21:23,186 --> 00:21:25,087
the partners are gathering in the lobby

381
00:21:25,155 --> 00:21:27,323
- and Dr. Miller called to say break a leg.
- Thank you.

382
00:21:29,459 --> 00:21:31,493
What were you saying?

383
00:21:31,561 --> 00:21:33,028
I was saying you're gonna do great.

384
00:21:49,145 --> 00:21:50,346
Morning.

385
00:21:52,782 --> 00:21:55,451
I'm afraid I have some unfortunate news.

386
00:21:57,354 --> 00:21:59,455
They canceled the meeting.

387
00:21:59,522 --> 00:22:01,056
- Are you kidding me?
- What?

388
00:22:01,124 --> 00:22:03,826
They decided to give it to Leo Burnett.

389
00:22:03,893 --> 00:22:05,728
Burnett has Marlboro already.

390
00:22:05,795 --> 00:22:07,663
- I thought they wanted a fresh start with this.
- So did I.

391
00:22:07,731 --> 00:22:10,432
They're excited to see where
you are in six months.

392
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,202
Six months means never.
They're letting us die.

393
00:22:13,269 --> 00:22:15,137
I thought this was a sure thing.

394
00:22:15,205 --> 00:22:17,406
Down the road perhaps.

395
00:22:17,474 --> 00:22:19,375
There's no reason to be discouraged.

396
00:22:19,442 --> 00:22:21,443
The wind is blowing ice cold out there.

397
00:22:21,511 --> 00:22:23,412
We can't even get a meeting
with a damn tobacco account!

398
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,813
Take it inside.

399
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,754
You're an asshole, you know that?

400
00:22:42,899 --> 00:22:45,100
Mr. Crane, out.

401
00:22:52,776 --> 00:22:54,943
They can't even dignify us with an excuse?

402
00:22:55,011 --> 00:22:57,346
They don't need an excuse.
It's because we're desperate.

403
00:22:57,414 --> 00:22:59,815
They can smell it on us. We reek of it

404
00:22:59,883 --> 00:23:01,984
like some sweaty salesman
knocking on his last door!

405
00:23:02,052 --> 00:23:03,752
Because we're going after scraps.

406
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:06,221
What about United Airlines, General Motors?

407
00:23:06,289 --> 00:23:08,524
- Do you think that's easier?
- Than what? You have a plan?

408
00:23:08,591 --> 00:23:10,592
I'm out there beating the
bushes every day for anything.

409
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:14,229
- You should try it.
- Just out of caution, I met with the bank.

410
00:23:14,297 --> 00:23:16,398
They've agreed to extend
our line of credit,

411
00:23:16,466 --> 00:23:18,033
but they would like us
to post some collateral.

412
00:23:18,101 --> 00:23:20,002
You went to the bank?
There's a vote of confidence.

413
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:23,639
$100,000 each from the senior partners

414
00:23:23,707 --> 00:23:25,741
and $50,000 from Mr. Campbell and I

415
00:23:25,809 --> 00:23:27,743
would buy us six months or so,

416
00:23:27,811 --> 00:23:30,813
provided we make a drastic
reduction in staff.

417
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,981
$50,000? Absolutely not.

418
00:23:33,049 --> 00:23:35,684
It's an obligation of your contract.

419
00:23:35,752 --> 00:23:37,553
All we need is a bridge
to cold and flu season

420
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,288
and Vicks will take us to the holidays.

421
00:23:39,355 --> 00:23:42,558
Sugarberry hams will pick up. Samsonite...

422
00:23:42,625 --> 00:23:45,094
It's a hardship for me as
well, but it's a necessity.

423
00:23:45,161 --> 00:23:46,829
We should move.
We should never have been here.

424
00:23:46,896 --> 00:23:48,597
You think we look desperate now?

425
00:23:48,665 --> 00:23:51,934
Well, if you figure it out,
you know where to find me...

426
00:23:52,001 --> 00:23:53,702
For a little while anyway.

427
00:23:59,042 --> 00:24:01,543
And then I was floating over town...

428
00:24:01,611 --> 00:24:03,879
Standing straight up, not like Superman.

429
00:24:03,947 --> 00:24:06,815
Only it wasn't ossining,it was London...

430
00:24:06,883 --> 00:24:08,317
Like Mary Poppins.

431
00:24:09,552 --> 00:24:11,186
Do you want the backwash?

432
00:24:17,026 --> 00:24:19,027
I fly in some of my dreams.

433
00:24:19,095 --> 00:24:21,130
It feels like being in the ocean.

434
00:24:21,197 --> 00:24:23,966
I just felt like I was going to heaven,

435
00:24:24,033 --> 00:24:26,268
except I don't believe in it.

436
00:24:26,336 --> 00:24:29,071
You don't? Then what happens when you die?

437
00:24:29,139 --> 00:24:32,474
- Nothing?
- It doesn't really bother me,

438
00:24:32,542 --> 00:24:34,409
except for it's forever.

439
00:24:34,477 --> 00:24:36,345
When I think about forever, I get upset.

440
00:24:37,847 --> 00:24:39,448
Like the land o' lakes butter

441
00:24:39,516 --> 00:24:42,818
has that Indian girl...
Sitting, holding a box.

442
00:24:42,886 --> 00:24:46,054
And it has a picture of her on it,
holding a box.

443
00:24:46,122 --> 00:24:48,457
With a picture of her
on it, holding a box.

444
00:24:48,525 --> 00:24:50,692
Have you ever noticed that?

445
00:24:52,629 --> 00:24:54,329
I wish you wouldn't have said that.

446
00:24:54,397 --> 00:24:56,265
Sorry.

447
00:24:56,332 --> 00:24:58,267
I have to go.

448
00:24:58,334 --> 00:25:00,702
Yeah, I should too.

449
00:25:06,743 --> 00:25:08,443
I'll save my fritos for you.

450
00:25:15,819 --> 00:25:18,954
- May I speak with you?
- Are you busy?

451
00:25:19,022 --> 00:25:21,423
No. Do you want one?

452
00:25:21,491 --> 00:25:22,758
No.

453
00:25:24,127 --> 00:25:26,361
Philip Morris set up the meeting

454
00:25:26,429 --> 00:25:29,631
then told Leo Burnett about it
to leverage a sweeter deal.

455
00:25:29,699 --> 00:25:33,302
So they used us.
Is that supposed to make me feel better?

456
00:25:33,369 --> 00:25:36,405
Everyone at Burnett is already bragging
about how we never even got a meeting.

457
00:25:36,472 --> 00:25:38,373
What do you want?

458
00:25:38,441 --> 00:25:40,209
I want to know why I'm being punished

459
00:25:40,276 --> 00:25:42,444
for being the only business
left around here.

460
00:25:42,512 --> 00:25:45,747
- We're all being punished.
- I don't have that kind of money.

461
00:25:45,815 --> 00:25:49,084
Pete, I'm doing everything I can.
Get me in a room.

462
00:25:51,321 --> 00:25:52,688
Miss Olson to see you.

463
00:25:52,755 --> 00:25:54,756
Come in!

464
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,261
Everybody's waiting
in the conference room.

465
00:25:59,329 --> 00:26:02,564
- For what?
- Well, we were all gonna leave when you left,

466
00:26:02,632 --> 00:26:06,168
but you didn't go, so what should we do?

467
00:26:06,236 --> 00:26:09,271
- I don't care.
- What happened?

468
00:26:09,339 --> 00:26:11,707
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

469
00:26:11,774 --> 00:26:13,942
What are we gonna do?

470
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:15,510
Peggy, it's not your problem.

471
00:26:15,578 --> 00:26:18,247
I know, but I have been
thinking about the company

472
00:26:18,314 --> 00:26:21,316
and I was wondering
what you thought about...

473
00:26:21,384 --> 00:26:24,119
You know, why don't
we just change our name?

474
00:26:24,187 --> 00:26:26,021
If this was a dog food,
we'd change the name.

475
00:26:27,657 --> 00:26:30,359
We can't start over. We just started.

476
00:26:30,426 --> 00:26:32,361
You always say "if you don't like
what they're saying about you,

477
00:26:32,428 --> 00:26:34,563
- change the conversation."
- To what?

478
00:26:34,631 --> 00:26:36,498
What they're saying about us is true.

479
00:26:36,566 --> 00:26:38,767
So there's nothing we can do?

480
00:26:38,835 --> 00:26:40,669
Sure there is. We're gonna sit at our desks

481
00:26:40,737 --> 00:26:43,171
and keep typing while the
walls fall down around us,

482
00:26:43,239 --> 00:26:45,073
because we're creative,

483
00:26:45,141 --> 00:26:47,109
the least important
most-important thing there is.

484
00:27:01,484 --> 00:27:03,185
You can't slam the door like that.

485
00:27:05,455 --> 00:27:06,922
Why didn't you call me back?

486
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:09,524
The bank called.
Something about a loan application?

487
00:27:10,793 --> 00:27:13,362
- They called here?
- Yes.

488
00:27:14,731 --> 00:27:16,832
You have something you want to tell me?

489
00:27:18,368 --> 00:27:19,801
It's not important.

490
00:27:22,338 --> 00:27:24,740
To think you still want to surprise me

491
00:27:24,807 --> 00:27:26,341
after five years of marriage.

492
00:27:28,311 --> 00:27:30,646
When can I start looking?
I'm so in love with Greenwich.

493
00:27:32,115 --> 00:27:34,116
We're not buying a house, Trudy.

494
00:27:35,518 --> 00:27:37,919
The partners each need to put in a lump sum

495
00:27:37,987 --> 00:27:40,088
to keep the payroll we have going,

496
00:27:40,156 --> 00:27:42,224
so people don't lose their jobs.

497
00:27:43,426 --> 00:27:45,694
What? How much?

498
00:27:45,762 --> 00:27:48,163
Well, it's $50,000

499
00:27:48,231 --> 00:27:49,865
and we have $22,000 in the bank,

500
00:27:49,932 --> 00:27:51,733
not counting the baby gifts...

501
00:27:51,801 --> 00:27:53,402
Which will remain for the baby.

502
00:27:53,469 --> 00:27:57,339
It's all for the baby, for Tammy
to have a yard to run around in.

503
00:27:57,407 --> 00:28:00,409
Central Park was good enough for me.

504
00:28:00,476 --> 00:28:04,212
When you bet big and lose,
you don't double down.

505
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:07,349
It's in my contract.
I'll lose my partnership.

506
00:28:07,417 --> 00:28:09,651
You'll lose your stateroom on the Titanic?

507
00:28:09,719 --> 00:28:12,554
You are forbidden to give
anything more to that company.

508
00:28:12,622 --> 00:28:15,023
You don't get to forbid me.

509
00:28:15,091 --> 00:28:16,892
Lower your voice!

510
00:28:16,959 --> 00:28:19,528
And don't even think
about asking my father.

511
00:29:31,901 --> 00:29:35,070
"Why I'm quitting tobacco.

512
00:29:39,542 --> 00:29:42,177
Recently, my advertising agency

513
00:29:42,245 --> 00:29:44,346
ended a long relationship

514
00:29:44,414 --> 00:29:45,714
with Lucky Strike cigarettes.

515
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:49,251
And I'm relieved.

516
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:54,022
For over 25 years, we devoted ourselves

517
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:55,657
to peddling a product

518
00:29:55,725 --> 00:29:58,727
for which good work is irrelevant,

519
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:02,697
because people can't stop
themselves from buying it".

520
00:30:04,367 --> 00:30:05,867
"The product that never improves,

521
00:30:05,935 --> 00:30:09,971
causes illness and makes people unhappy.

522
00:30:13,843 --> 00:30:15,477
But there was money in it.

523
00:30:16,779 --> 00:30:18,380
A lot of money.

524
00:30:22,018 --> 00:30:25,754
In fact, our entire business depended on it.

525
00:30:28,224 --> 00:30:29,991
We knew it wasn't good for us,

526
00:30:30,059 --> 00:30:31,927
but we couldn't stop.

527
00:30:33,796 --> 00:30:35,530
And then, when Lucky Strike moved

528
00:30:35,598 --> 00:30:37,666
their business elsewhere,

529
00:30:37,733 --> 00:30:42,003
i realized here was my chance to
be someone who can sleep at night

530
00:30:42,071 --> 00:30:43,905
because I know what I'm selling

531
00:30:43,973 --> 00:30:45,807
doesn't kill my customers.

532
00:30:45,875 --> 00:30:48,610
So as of today,
Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce

533
00:30:48,678 --> 00:30:50,312
will no longer take tobacco accounts.

534
00:30:50,379 --> 00:30:52,881
We know it's gonna be hard.

535
00:30:52,949 --> 00:30:54,749
If you're interested in cigarette work,

536
00:30:54,817 --> 00:30:56,885
here's a list of agencies that do it well:

537
00:30:56,953 --> 00:31:00,388
B.B.D.O., Leo Burnett, McCann-Erickson,

538
00:31:00,456 --> 00:31:03,325
Cutler, Gleason & Chaough
and Benton & Bowles."

539
00:31:03,392 --> 00:31:06,895
"As for us, we welcome all other business,

540
00:31:06,963 --> 00:31:09,664
because we're certain that our
best work is still ahead of us.

541
00:31:09,732 --> 00:31:12,567
Sincerely, Donald F. Draper,

542
00:31:12,635 --> 00:31:15,437
Creative Director,
Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce."

543
00:31:18,941 --> 00:31:21,376
- Good morning, Don.
- Stan.

544
00:31:23,579 --> 00:31:25,347
Good morning.

545
00:31:26,782 --> 00:31:30,418
Good morning. Any calls?

546
00:31:30,486 --> 00:31:32,654
Oh yes, quite a few.

547
00:31:32,722 --> 00:31:34,556
Mostly reporters and citizens,

548
00:31:34,624 --> 00:31:36,925
- Dr. Miller.
- Anyone else?

549
00:31:36,993 --> 00:31:39,794
Someone named Emerson Foote

550
00:31:39,862 --> 00:31:42,898
and people from those
agencies you mentioned.

551
00:31:44,467 --> 00:31:45,634
They're looking for you.

552
00:31:50,139 --> 00:31:51,506
Can you get Dr. Miller?

553
00:31:52,842 --> 00:31:54,509
Somebody used your name to end our business

554
00:31:54,577 --> 00:31:56,044
in the newspaper.

555
00:31:56,112 --> 00:31:58,947
- It's not you, is it?
- It's suicide!

556
00:31:59,015 --> 00:32:00,882
It's insane!
How the hell could you do this?

557
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:03,518
- Why would you do this?
- Because someone had to do something.

558
00:32:03,586 --> 00:32:05,520
You put the company name on it.

559
00:32:05,588 --> 00:32:06,955
You should've consulted us.

560
00:32:07,023 --> 00:32:09,391
Why? To evaluate its
strengths and weaknesses?

561
00:32:09,458 --> 00:32:11,760
To knock it down to risk versus reward?
It's done!

562
00:32:11,827 --> 00:32:14,229
And I slept last night
for the first time in a month.

563
00:32:14,297 --> 00:32:15,964
You slept? Really?

564
00:32:16,032 --> 00:32:18,166
You weren't smiling, thinking
about the taste of shit

565
00:32:18,234 --> 00:32:19,734
that would be in everybody's
mouth over breakfast today?

566
00:32:19,802 --> 00:32:22,203
No one asked you to euthanize this company.

567
00:32:22,271 --> 00:32:24,372
What did you expect, for
us to pat you on the back?

568
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,641
Don't you realize the clients
are all going to think

569
00:32:26,709 --> 00:32:28,176
you could turn on them at any minute?

570
00:32:28,244 --> 00:32:30,312
I'm not going to explain to you what I did.

571
00:32:30,379 --> 00:32:32,581
It's an ad for this agency.

572
00:32:32,648 --> 00:32:34,816
If you don't understand it, then
you shouldn't be in this business.

573
00:32:34,884 --> 00:32:37,419
You humiliated us by not putting

574
00:32:37,486 --> 00:32:39,154
our names on it.

575
00:32:39,221 --> 00:32:41,923
You left us with this hypocrisy.

576
00:32:41,991 --> 00:32:44,225
So deny it! I did what I thought
was best for the company.

577
00:32:44,293 --> 00:32:45,860
You can either back me or not.

578
00:32:45,928 --> 00:32:48,063
You did what was best for you,

579
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:50,732
because you're impatient and childish.

580
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,335
You had a tantrum on a full
page in "The New York Times."

581
00:32:55,371 --> 00:32:57,305
So no one is happy about this?

582
00:32:59,008 --> 00:33:01,176
I don't know.
It's good enough to be the reason

583
00:33:01,243 --> 00:33:03,078
this place went down anymore.

584
00:33:03,145 --> 00:33:05,780
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

585
00:33:05,848 --> 00:33:08,750
Um, there's someone calling
from Senator Kennedy's office.

586
00:33:08,818 --> 00:33:11,086
Robert Kennedy wants to speak with you.

587
00:33:21,063 --> 00:33:22,597
Please hold for the Senator.

588
00:33:22,665 --> 00:33:24,332
Is this here Don Draper?

589
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,868
- Yes.
- This is Bobby Kennedy.

590
00:33:26,936 --> 00:33:28,403
How are you this lovely morning?

591
00:33:30,072 --> 00:33:32,440
I'm well. Thank you, Senator.

592
00:33:32,508 --> 00:33:34,643
Bobby please. Listen,

593
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:36,578
i just wanted to say that I admire

594
00:33:36,646 --> 00:33:38,980
your fortitude and vigor

595
00:33:39,048 --> 00:33:40,949
and standing up to what I consider to be

596
00:33:41,017 --> 00:33:44,919
one of the great menaces to this
civilization as we know it.

597
00:33:44,987 --> 00:33:48,390
- That's very flattering.
- I have one question:

598
00:33:48,457 --> 00:33:52,494
- Does your company represent Secor Laxatives?
- Yes. Yes, we do.

599
00:33:52,561 --> 00:33:54,663
Well, are you going to be
writing anything against them?

600
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:55,997
Because I want to make it clear

601
00:33:56,065 --> 00:33:57,699
that I am

602
00:33:57,767 --> 00:34:00,535
firmly anti-laxative.

603
00:34:00,603 --> 00:34:02,704
Who the hell is this?

604
00:34:04,507 --> 00:34:06,474
Teddy Chaough.

605
00:34:06,542 --> 00:34:09,477
Thanks for sticking my name
in there with the big boys.

606
00:34:09,545 --> 00:34:12,981
A full-page ad in "The Times".
What did that run you?

607
00:34:16,786 --> 00:34:18,853
A little mix-up there.
That was Eunice Kennedy.

608
00:34:18,921 --> 00:34:21,589
Keep joking. You're cynical and craven.

609
00:34:21,657 --> 00:34:24,859
Tobacco put a roof over your head

610
00:34:24,927 --> 00:34:27,495
- and it fed your children.
- And then it killed my business.

611
00:34:27,563 --> 00:34:31,066
I never thought you had the
stomach for a partnership.

612
00:34:31,133 --> 00:34:34,936
I'm no longer a part of this agency.

613
00:34:35,004 --> 00:34:36,871
You there, get my shoes.

614
00:34:36,939 --> 00:34:38,506
Bert, calm down.

615
00:34:38,574 --> 00:34:40,141
I will not.

616
00:34:40,209 --> 00:34:42,010
We've created a monster.

617
00:34:50,419 --> 00:34:52,287
I've already informed the other partners.

618
00:34:52,354 --> 00:34:56,391
I'll need your contribution by
close of business, as it were.

619
00:34:56,459 --> 00:34:57,726
You know this could work.

620
00:34:59,295 --> 00:35:02,464
Do you realize I've just
moved my family back here?

621
00:35:08,738 --> 00:35:10,905
I'm terribly sorry about that.

622
00:35:10,973 --> 00:35:14,242
- Did you get Dr. Miller?
- Yes, but you were on with...

623
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:16,745
You were on the phone.
She said she'd stop by later.

624
00:35:18,247 --> 00:35:20,615
Okay, that'll be all.

625
00:35:20,683 --> 00:35:22,617
By the way,

626
00:35:22,685 --> 00:35:24,953
I loved the letter.

627
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:27,122
I love that you stand for something.

628
00:35:27,189 --> 00:35:29,491
Megan, that's not really what it's about.

629
00:35:29,558 --> 00:35:32,560
I know that part. I know it was about

630
00:35:32,628 --> 00:35:34,562
"he didn't dump me. I dumped him."

631
00:35:36,632 --> 00:35:39,334
I just love that you did it.

632
00:35:39,401 --> 00:35:41,236
It feels different around here.

633
00:35:45,407 --> 00:35:46,775
Thank you.

634
00:35:53,849 --> 00:35:56,484
- So who else called?
- Everyone who's anyone.

635
00:35:56,552 --> 00:35:58,353
Smokey the bear, Smokey Robinson,

636
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:02,023
Chiquita Banana, Aunt Jemima.

637
00:36:02,091 --> 00:36:04,125
Is he gonna quit smoking?

638
00:36:04,193 --> 00:36:06,294
You're an idiot.

639
00:36:06,362 --> 00:36:07,929
I heard from all my clients this morning...

640
00:36:07,997 --> 00:36:10,031
Mostly out of morbid curiosity.

641
00:36:10,099 --> 00:36:12,400
But one thing's for sure... they're not
talking about lucky strike anymore.

642
00:36:12,468 --> 00:36:15,036
Well, I think that was the whole idea.

643
00:36:15,104 --> 00:36:17,672
They're gonna fire everybody...

644
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:19,407
Or worse, make me fire everybody.

645
00:36:19,475 --> 00:36:22,544
Well, it's been a pleasure
working with you all.

646
00:36:22,611 --> 00:36:24,179
I wish you the best of luck.

647
00:36:27,183 --> 00:36:30,051
I didn't think they'd start with him.

648
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:33,354
Peggy, Mr. Draper wants to see you.

649
00:36:34,657 --> 00:36:36,257
Okay.

650
00:36:45,301 --> 00:36:48,269
It's a doggy-dog world.

651
00:36:52,041 --> 00:36:53,408
Should I close the door?

652
00:36:53,475 --> 00:36:54,809
Yes.

653
00:36:59,648 --> 00:37:00,882
Should I sit down?

654
00:37:02,084 --> 00:37:03,585
Who can you live without?

655
00:37:03,652 --> 00:37:05,520
Oh.

656
00:37:06,689 --> 00:37:07,989
Oh good.

657
00:37:08,057 --> 00:37:10,124
I mean not good,

658
00:37:10,192 --> 00:37:12,293
but... You know.

659
00:37:12,361 --> 00:37:15,330
Well, Danny obviously,

660
00:37:15,397 --> 00:37:16,965
though he's kind of grown on me.

661
00:37:17,032 --> 00:37:20,268
Lane sent over a memo with suggestions.

662
00:37:20,336 --> 00:37:23,071
"All of the tobacco people, Mark Coyle,

663
00:37:23,138 --> 00:37:27,675
Wuzna... The Polish kid... Danny and Bill."

664
00:37:30,546 --> 00:37:32,213
That's a lot of people.

665
00:37:33,415 --> 00:37:34,816
Are we going under?

666
00:37:34,884 --> 00:37:38,519
No. Of course not.

667
00:37:38,587 --> 00:37:40,355
I just wanted to give you notice

668
00:37:40,422 --> 00:37:42,757
so when they all come to you,
you'll know what's going on.

669
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,360
Okay.

670
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:52,133
So? You haven't said
anything about the letter.

671
00:37:52,201 --> 00:37:55,536
I thought you didn't go in for
those kinds of shenanigans.

672
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:27,624
Sally Draper.

673
00:38:27,691 --> 00:38:29,426
Stop, both of you.

674
00:38:29,493 --> 00:38:31,127
What are you doing here?

675
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,401
You stay away from her! You hear me?

676
00:38:40,371 --> 00:38:42,305
Let's go.

677
00:38:50,848 --> 00:38:52,615
We're not going back for your bike.

678
00:38:52,683 --> 00:38:55,318
I told you... He's my friend.
We don't do anything.

679
00:38:55,386 --> 00:38:58,354
- That boy is bad.
- No, he's not.

680
00:38:58,422 --> 00:39:01,524
Believe me. I know him better than you do.

681
00:39:02,827 --> 00:39:04,394
You don't know him at all.

682
00:39:07,364 --> 00:39:08,731
Go to your room.

683
00:39:18,109 --> 00:39:22,045
- You stopped by.
- Yes. I'm glad to see you smiling.

684
00:39:22,113 --> 00:39:24,747
Well, they all want to kill
me, but I have a bodyguard.

685
00:39:24,815 --> 00:39:28,184
- Can I get you anything?
- No thank you.

686
00:39:37,862 --> 00:39:41,097
- What's this?
- My things.

687
00:39:41,165 --> 00:39:43,032
We had to resign.

688
00:39:44,635 --> 00:39:47,270
Geoff Atherton wants another
cigarette account someday.

689
00:39:49,974 --> 00:39:52,609
I'm so sorry. I didn't think about that.

690
00:39:52,676 --> 00:39:54,410
I know.

691
00:39:59,383 --> 00:40:00,884
I'm really sorry.

692
00:40:09,226 --> 00:40:10,393
So...

693
00:40:11,996 --> 00:40:13,863
You're gonna make it through this day,

694
00:40:13,931 --> 00:40:17,066
you're going to leave this
office, meet me for dinner

695
00:40:17,134 --> 00:40:19,869
in the open... Wherever I want...

696
00:40:19,937 --> 00:40:21,638
And we're gonna talk
about anything but work,

697
00:40:23,073 --> 00:40:25,175
because we can do that now.

698
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:28,478
It's a fair trade.

699
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,419
At Carabelle, eight o'clock?

700
00:40:49,033 --> 00:40:51,334
Sure.

701
00:40:51,402 --> 00:40:53,570
Have your girl make reservations.

702
00:41:06,016 --> 00:41:07,650
Just wanted to say goodbye.

703
00:41:09,153 --> 00:41:12,088
Oh no. What happened?

704
00:41:12,156 --> 00:41:14,791
Tobacco is very touchy.

705
00:41:14,858 --> 00:41:17,594
Who's gonna do our research?

706
00:41:17,661 --> 00:41:20,930
You know, I just lost one of my best jobs.

707
00:41:20,998 --> 00:41:22,799
No, I mean,

708
00:41:24,301 --> 00:41:26,102
I love working with you.

709
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:28,004
Would you have a drink with me?

710
00:41:29,506 --> 00:41:31,541
- I don't want to linger.
- Not right now.

711
00:41:31,609 --> 00:41:35,178
Just... I hate to think
I'm not gonna see you.

712
00:41:35,246 --> 00:41:37,380
That's sweet.

713
00:41:37,448 --> 00:41:39,148
No, I mean it.

714
00:41:39,216 --> 00:41:41,417
You do your job so well,

715
00:41:41,485 --> 00:41:44,554
they respect you and you don't
have to play any games.

716
00:41:46,023 --> 00:41:47,590
I didn't know that was possible.

717
00:41:47,658 --> 00:41:49,692
Is that what it looks like?

718
00:41:51,829 --> 00:41:54,430
I'm sure we'll work together again...

719
00:41:54,498 --> 00:41:56,299
Somewhere.

720
00:42:10,547 --> 00:42:11,881
Hello there.

721
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,421
So I'm home early for a family dinner.

722
00:42:18,489 --> 00:42:20,823
They couldn't wait.

723
00:42:20,891 --> 00:42:23,493
- We can eat later.
- I'll eat with this crowd.

724
00:42:31,902 --> 00:42:33,836
Well, I had quite a day.

725
00:42:33,904 --> 00:42:36,139
Mmm, that doesn't sound good.

726
00:42:36,206 --> 00:42:38,341
It's this neighborhood.

727
00:42:38,409 --> 00:42:41,044
It's being taken over
by low-caliber people.

728
00:42:44,648 --> 00:42:46,616
I think it's time for us to move.

729
00:42:48,452 --> 00:42:51,788
Great. You know how I feel about it.

730
00:42:51,855 --> 00:42:53,990
I like that place in Rye.

731
00:42:54,058 --> 00:42:55,758
Rye? Isn't that where Playland is?

732
00:43:05,235 --> 00:43:07,136
She'll get over it.

733
00:43:32,629 --> 00:43:35,565
Roger, Don, Harry and myself
should probably begin

734
00:43:35,632 --> 00:43:37,333
the process of letting people go

735
00:43:37,401 --> 00:43:40,002
to avoid any further damage to morale.

736
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:42,739
And please try and limit
any sympathetic adjustments

737
00:43:42,806 --> 00:43:46,142
- to severance.
- Yes, and as Lane mentioned,

738
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:48,211
we'll try to hold onto
any staplers, scissors,

739
00:43:48,278 --> 00:43:50,012
hole punches and tape dispensers.

740
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:51,981
They do disappear.

741
00:43:53,751 --> 00:43:54,951
Don, are you ever gonna call back

742
00:43:55,018 --> 00:43:56,452
the American Cancer Society?

743
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:57,787
They've tried you twice this morning.

744
00:43:57,855 --> 00:44:00,723
I saw that. It's a joke.

745
00:44:00,791 --> 00:44:02,925
It's not. They finally called me.

746
00:44:02,993 --> 00:44:05,862
They want us to come in and meet
about an anti-smoking campaign.

747
00:44:05,929 --> 00:44:08,197
Huh. Really?

748
00:44:08,265 --> 00:44:10,566
Took me about five minutes
to stop laughing.

749
00:44:10,634 --> 00:44:12,335
I hope I didn't blow it.

750
00:44:13,804 --> 00:44:15,138
Well, that's interesting, right?

751
00:44:15,205 --> 00:44:18,674
Great. Public service.

752
00:44:18,742 --> 00:44:21,444
Free work. That's just what
we should be doing right now.

753
00:44:21,512 --> 00:44:24,380
- It's prestigious.
- But we can't eat prestige.

754
00:44:24,448 --> 00:44:26,048
Someone called us.

755
00:44:26,116 --> 00:44:28,117
We could have new work on the air.

756
00:44:28,185 --> 00:44:29,819
There's a lot of bigwigs on the board.

757
00:44:31,789 --> 00:44:34,791
Under normal circumstances, I would
consider this an opportunity.

758
00:44:34,858 --> 00:44:37,360
- Absolutely.
- Yes, Don saved the company.

759
00:44:37,428 --> 00:44:39,796
Now go get rid of half of it.

760
00:44:43,667 --> 00:44:45,601
We should probably stay in here.

761
00:44:45,669 --> 00:44:47,303
I suppose.

762
00:44:48,972 --> 00:44:51,140
Lane, may I speak with you a moment?

763
00:44:51,208 --> 00:44:53,943
Well, I've gotta go learn a bunch of
people's names before I fire them.

764
00:45:00,984 --> 00:45:02,752
I know you said the end of business today,

765
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:05,555
but that money... I don't have it.

766
00:45:05,622 --> 00:45:08,691
Is there any way I can owe it on advance

767
00:45:08,759 --> 00:45:11,561
against bonus or future salary?

768
00:45:11,628 --> 00:45:14,497
Calm yourself. Don paid your share.

769
00:45:14,565 --> 00:45:16,165
What?

770
00:45:16,233 --> 00:45:18,835
Perhaps you weren't supposed to know that.

771
00:46:05,115 --> 00:46:07,817
Well, thank you for the opportunity.

772
00:46:07,885 --> 00:46:09,719
It was my pleasure.

773
00:46:17,027 --> 00:46:18,261
