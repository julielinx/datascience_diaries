00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:07,269
<i>Previously on</i> Mad Men.

2
00:00:07,491 --> 00:00:10,214
What do you do, just kiss women all the
time? Women you aren't married to?

3
00:00:10,485 --> 00:00:11,530
Of course not.

4
00:00:11,703 --> 00:00:13,509
I know, I'm grown up,
but Dick, it's me.

5
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:15,094
I don't know what
you're talking about.

6
00:00:15,354 --> 00:00:16,387
it's Adam...

7
00:00:16,772 --> 00:00:17,793
Your little brother.

8
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:20,891
Go home, get undressed and
look at yourself in the mirror.

9
00:00:21,151 --> 00:00:23,722
Really evaluate where your
strengths and weaknesses are,

10
00:00:23,933 --> 00:00:25,145
and be honest.

11
00:00:25,733 --> 00:00:26,872
I always try to be honest.

12
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,192
Where'd you get the tv?

13
00:00:28,648 --> 00:00:29,650
Someone gave it to me.

14
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:30,984
And you took it?

15
00:00:33,538 --> 00:00:35,205
- All better?
- Yes.

16
00:01:12,244 --> 00:01:13,617
Season 1 Episode 6
<i>Babylon</i>

17
00:02:04,664 --> 00:02:06,438
Dick Whitman, you watch
where you're going,

18
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:07,917
you're gonna break your neck.

19
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,736
You gonna cry or get up?

21
00:02:17,601 --> 00:02:19,159
I'm getting up, uncle Mac.

23
00:02:19,584 --> 00:02:21,944
Good, there's someone
who wants to meet you.

24
00:02:25,392 --> 00:02:26,655
What are you afraid of?

25
00:02:27,327 --> 00:02:28,810
There was lots of screaming.

26
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,231
Always is.

27
00:02:32,644 --> 00:02:34,566
The lord has given us a blessing,

28
00:02:35,206 --> 00:02:36,777
you have a new brother.

29
00:02:38,204 --> 00:02:39,655
He ain't my brother.

30
00:02:40,168 --> 00:02:41,573
Of course he is, you got
the same daddy.

31
00:02:43,018 --> 00:02:44,451
Isn't he beautiful?

32
00:02:45,393 --> 00:02:47,829
I named him Adam,
after the first man.

33
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:01,301
Daddy!

34
00:03:03,104 --> 00:03:04,137
Are you all right?

35
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:10,755
Happy mother's day.

36
00:04:03,028 --> 00:04:04,461
This is fascinating.

37
00:04:05,768 --> 00:04:07,375
It's better than
the hollywood version.

38
00:04:07,506 --> 00:04:08,582
Certainly dirtier.

39
00:04:10,327 --> 00:04:12,605
Well Joan Crawford is not
what she was.

40
00:04:14,455 --> 00:04:18,091
And honestly, I found her eyebrows
completely unnerving,

41
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:22,316
like a couple of <i>Caterpillars</i>
just pasted there.

42
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,320
Her standing next to Susie Parker

43
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:28,351
as if they were the same species.

44
00:04:29,771 --> 00:04:31,927
Well, some men like eyebrows,

45
00:04:32,938 --> 00:04:34,770
and all men like Joan Crawford.

46
00:04:35,843 --> 00:04:38,190
Salvatore couldn't stop
talking about her.

47
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:41,604
To think one of the great beauties,

48
00:04:41,827 --> 00:04:44,211
and there she is, so old.

49
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,109
I'd just like to disappear
at that point.

50
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,512
It makes perfect sense.

51
00:04:53,144 --> 00:04:54,144
I promise you, bets,

52
00:04:54,956 --> 00:04:58,171
The first sign of crow's feet
and I'll put you on an ice flow.

53
00:04:58,973 --> 00:05:02,108
Would you, will you be
my gal in the iron mask?

54
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,411
Did you have a nice mother's day?

55
00:05:08,335 --> 00:05:09,457
It was lovely.

56
00:05:12,308 --> 00:05:14,081
And my mother was at
least two years older

57
00:05:14,308 --> 00:05:16,352
than whatever Joan Crawford
says she is, and

58
00:05:17,033 --> 00:05:18,806
she was still very fetching.

59
00:05:21,076 --> 00:05:23,084
I'd like to think that
she'd stand up very well

60
00:05:23,306 --> 00:05:26,007
as a prediction of
my eventual appearance.

61
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:27,927
Bets, don't...

62
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:32,139
No melancholy.

63
00:05:34,206 --> 00:05:36,803
I'm allowed to be sentimental
on mother's day.

64
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:39,167
But it's your mother's day, not hers.

65
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,364
I'm just saying, my mother
looked handsome...

66
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:48,758
Actually vivacious and positively
cheerful right up to her end.

67
00:05:51,327 --> 00:05:52,716
It's good remembrance.

68
00:05:53,121 --> 00:05:57,866
Doctor Wayne suggested a book which
says it's part of the mourning process.

69
00:05:59,939 --> 00:06:01,026
Doctor Wayne?

70
00:06:02,774 --> 00:06:04,192
I do think it's helping.

71
00:06:06,187 --> 00:06:07,502
So you're cured?

72
00:06:08,554 --> 00:06:10,092
I don't know how they tell that.

73
00:06:10,894 --> 00:06:12,868
When their vacation house
is paid for.

74
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:16,279
Don't deride him.

75
00:06:20,509 --> 00:06:23,315
Mourning is just extended self pity.

76
00:06:26,106 --> 00:06:28,505
In New Guinea, Pygmies

77
00:06:30,103 --> 00:06:33,484
grind up their ancestors and
drink the powder in a beer.

78
00:06:35,326 --> 00:06:37,780
And a model culture at that, Pygmies.

79
00:06:38,843 --> 00:06:41,598
Did you know Michel Angelo
was painting the Sistine ceiling

80
00:06:41,773 --> 00:06:44,451
when those people were
still living in caves,

81
00:06:45,073 --> 00:06:46,276
discovering fire?

82
00:06:47,202 --> 00:06:48,364
I didn't know that.

83
00:06:49,144 --> 00:06:50,208
Well, it's true.

84
00:06:50,845 --> 00:06:52,747
Introduction to basic anthropology.

85
00:06:55,346 --> 00:06:56,779
What about

86
00:06:57,871 --> 00:06:59,621
advanced reproduction?

87
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,773
How are your studies
progressing in that?

88
00:07:03,205 --> 00:07:04,274
Completed.

89
00:07:05,657 --> 00:07:06,897
I got an "A" actually.

90
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,837
- You did?
- Yep, I did.

91
00:07:10,831 --> 00:07:12,594
I flunked the whole thing.

92
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:15,575
Well that's because
you got caught cheating.

93
00:07:28,223 --> 00:07:29,345
Get the light.

94
00:07:44,472 --> 00:07:45,958
And I want you so much.

95
00:07:48,348 --> 00:07:49,697
I thought about it all day.

96
00:07:50,033 --> 00:07:51,033
Me too.

97
00:07:53,911 --> 00:07:54,911
No, I mean it.

98
00:07:58,222 --> 00:07:59,724
It's all I think about...

99
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:01,920
everyday...

100
00:08:04,096 --> 00:08:06,103
your car coming down the driveway.

101
00:08:08,473 --> 00:08:10,819
I put the kids to bed early.

102
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:15,747
I make a grocery list,
I cook butterscotch pudding.

103
00:08:17,784 --> 00:08:19,061
I never my let hands idle...

104
00:08:19,222 --> 00:08:20,356
Brushing my hair.

105
00:08:20,535 --> 00:08:21,716
Drinking my milk.

106
00:08:23,786 --> 00:08:26,022
It's all in a kind of fog

107
00:08:26,257 --> 00:08:28,441
because I can't stop
thinking about this.

108
00:08:33,848 --> 00:08:35,874
I want you- so badly.

109
00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:41,849
You have me...

110
00:08:46,034 --> 00:08:47,034
You do.

111
00:09:17,706 --> 00:09:21,437
Don, you remember Nick Grodis
from <i>Olympic Cruise Lines</i>.

112
00:09:21,832 --> 00:09:24,016
Nick, did you ever add that
second deck of portholes?

113
00:09:24,145 --> 00:09:26,488
Yes, but those rooms get pretty wet.

114
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,356
This is Urin Bensul Hi

115
00:09:29,616 --> 00:09:31,265
from the Israeli administery
of tourism.

116
00:09:31,392 --> 00:09:32,620
It is pronounced Uraum.

117
00:09:32,764 --> 00:09:35,195
- Of course.
- And this young lady is Lily Meyer.

118
00:09:35,461 --> 00:09:36,634
Pleasure to meet you.

119
00:09:36,792 --> 00:09:37,891
And you.

120
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:41,076
caviar blinis, mal tal's...

121
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,079
We're thinking of a land
of exotic luxury.

122
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:47,029
We'd like to think that if Beirut is
the Paris of the middle east,

123
00:09:47,158 --> 00:09:48,166
Heifa can be the Rome.

124
00:09:49,152 --> 00:09:50,543
It's an exciting idea.

125
00:09:50,803 --> 00:09:53,505
Of course, we should keep in mind
that Paris has the Eiffel tower

126
00:09:53,765 --> 00:09:55,006
and Rome has the Coliseum.

127
00:09:55,132 --> 00:09:56,132
Grandtel avenue

128
00:09:56,392 --> 00:09:57,578
is about to have a Hilton.

129
00:09:57,848 --> 00:09:59,903
Olympic is charting a most
luxurious liner,

130
00:10:00,103 --> 00:10:03,591
all along the wonderous ports
of the Israeli riviera.

131
00:10:03,741 --> 00:10:04,766
We are going to

132
00:10:05,026 --> 00:10:07,034
visit mr. Van Berg down the street,

133
00:10:07,227 --> 00:10:08,228
but some of us

134
00:10:08,488 --> 00:10:10,011
find his humor to be kitsch,

135
00:10:10,531 --> 00:10:13,607
we thought we would try
a traditional way as well.

136
00:10:15,132 --> 00:10:17,779
<i>Sterling Cooper</i> doesn't like
to think of itself as tradition.

137
00:10:18,398 --> 00:10:22,422
Maybe that is the wrong word.
My english is not so good.

138
00:10:23,128 --> 00:10:25,417
Glamour, like glamorous,
that's the word.

139
00:10:26,106 --> 00:10:28,248
We saw your awards.
We were impressed with

140
00:10:28,508 --> 00:10:30,156
your work on Rio de Janeiro.

141
00:10:30,469 --> 00:10:31,501
You're not thinking of,

142
00:10:31,761 --> 00:10:34,426
putting a 150 foot statue of
Jesus in Tel Aviv are you?

143
00:10:35,306 --> 00:10:36,564
Cause that's how we sold Rio.

144
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:38,883
This book

145
00:10:39,143 --> 00:10:40,897
has been on the best seller list

146
00:10:41,078 --> 00:10:42,262
for two years in the states,

147
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:43,805
and is soon to be

148
00:10:44,065 --> 00:10:45,065
a major motion picture

149
00:10:45,316 --> 00:10:46,513
starring Paul Newman.

150
00:10:47,636 --> 00:10:51,547
America has a love affair with Israel,

151
00:10:52,545 --> 00:10:55,066
and we would like to bring
the two parties together.

152
00:10:56,285 --> 00:10:58,486
Well, you certainly saved me
some leg work.

153
00:10:58,746 --> 00:11:00,071
All I have is the Bible.

154
00:11:00,658 --> 00:11:02,032
Let's stay away from that.

155
00:11:05,821 --> 00:11:08,310
So, your ideal tourist,

156
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:10,623
what's his yearly salary?

157
00:11:12,286 --> 00:11:13,626
Whatever you make.

158
00:11:14,471 --> 00:11:15,934
They always say that.

159
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,227
Well, look who's here...

160
00:11:31,846 --> 00:11:33,097
A couple of angels.

161
00:11:33,346 --> 00:11:34,457
Do we have lunch today?

162
00:11:34,712 --> 00:11:37,275
No, darling, we're going to
get Margaret a haircut.

163
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:38,910
A haircut?

164
00:11:39,034 --> 00:11:41,613
I like your ponytails. Of course,
it makes you look young.

165
00:11:42,909 --> 00:11:45,366
I like your hair, daddy,
it makes you look old.

166
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:49,662
We just have to find the right place.

167
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:51,659
Ginger?

168
00:11:52,474 --> 00:11:53,708
I cut my own hair.

169
00:11:56,017 --> 00:11:57,212
You picked her.

170
00:11:58,686 --> 00:12:00,840
Don't you two make
a handsome couple.

171
00:12:01,705 --> 00:12:03,134
Honestly, I don't go for handsome.

172
00:12:04,771 --> 00:12:06,262
Mona. Margaret.

173
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:08,647
What brings you below 59th street?

174
00:12:08,746 --> 00:12:09,766
Margaret, say hello.

175
00:12:11,569 --> 00:12:13,767
Hello, mr. Draper.

176
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:18,631
Mona, aren't you lucky, mother
and daughter on the town.

177
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,486
Where are the girls getting
their hair done these days?

178
00:12:21,955 --> 00:12:24,682
By girls you mean Bridget Bardot,
cause that's what I'm seeing.

179
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,825
As long as she can pit
a hat on it for church.

180
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:29,941
You are going to love this man.

181
00:12:30,176 --> 00:12:31,830
I will make you an appointment,
come on.

182
00:12:33,182 --> 00:12:34,192
Bye, Don.

183
00:12:34,836 --> 00:12:35,958
Roger, sweetheart.

184
00:12:38,768 --> 00:12:40,724
She used to love being in my office.

185
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:45,300
A haircut is the least
of Margaret's problems.

186
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:48,710
She's dated what, two boys?

187
00:12:49,893 --> 00:12:53,120
One of them joined the service,
the other one committed suicide.

188
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,325
She doesn't want to go to college.

189
00:12:56,893 --> 00:12:58,062
Doesn't want to work.

190
00:12:58,269 --> 00:12:59,750
Not interested in charity.

191
00:13:01,331 --> 00:13:02,920
I don't know what we did wrong.

192
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:06,160
We gave her everything she wanted
and she's still useless.

193
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:09,077
You're being too hard on her,
she's a young girl.

194
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:11,811
When I was her age,
I rode a tramp steamer

195
00:13:11,987 --> 00:13:13,467
from bar Harbor to Hilton head.

196
00:13:13,648 --> 00:13:14,806
I bet it was a yacht.

197
00:13:16,259 --> 00:13:17,573
Someone still has to sail those things.

198
00:13:17,738 --> 00:13:19,499
I think Margaret reminds you of you,

199
00:13:19,662 --> 00:13:21,165
you're both spoiled... zip.

200
00:13:26,707 --> 00:13:28,088
Come back to bed.

201
00:13:28,832 --> 00:13:30,682
I can stay here all afternoon.

202
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:34,851
You don't have to go
back to work, I do... zip.

203
00:13:37,144 --> 00:13:38,970
Do you like the pearl
necklace I gave you?

204
00:13:39,397 --> 00:13:40,398
It's gorgeous.

205
00:13:43,755 --> 00:13:45,361
Aren't you even gonna
have any of this?

206
00:13:46,207 --> 00:13:48,152
Look, we've got <i>Oysters Rockefeller</i>,

207
00:13:48,459 --> 00:13:50,450
beef Wellington, Napoleon.

208
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:53,672
We leave this lunch alone,
it will take over Europe.

209
00:13:54,061 --> 00:13:55,482
I don't like eating in here.

210
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:58,341
Food that close to the bed
reminds me of a hospital.

211
00:14:00,018 --> 00:14:01,228
If you had your own apartment,

212
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:03,623
we could go to your place.
You could cook for me.

213
00:14:03,834 --> 00:14:05,679
Don't you like things
the way they are?

214
00:14:07,332 --> 00:14:08,630
Are you kidding?

215
00:14:09,221 --> 00:14:11,207
This has been the best year
of my life.

216
00:14:12,473 --> 00:14:15,475
Do you have any idea how unhappy
I was before I met you?

217
00:14:17,772 --> 00:14:19,908
I was thinking of leaving my wife.

218
00:14:23,022 --> 00:14:25,007
I am just getting tired of all...

219
00:14:25,709 --> 00:14:26,862
The sneaking around,

220
00:14:28,247 --> 00:14:29,339
aren't you?

221
00:14:30,897 --> 00:14:32,158
Roger, I know

222
00:14:32,418 --> 00:14:34,445
as much about men as you
know about advertising,

223
00:14:34,692 --> 00:14:37,236
and I know that this sneaking
around is your favorite part.

224
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:41,420
You know, I have
a lot of favorite parts.

225
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:44,337
I'd like to get you

226
00:14:44,764 --> 00:14:46,795
a little fourth floor
walkup somewhere,

227
00:14:46,983 --> 00:14:48,827
with no doors, no windows,

228
00:14:49,522 --> 00:14:51,024
and lock you up for a week.

229
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:54,944
That's tempting...

230
00:14:56,023 --> 00:14:57,333
But I like hotels,

231
00:14:58,771 --> 00:15:01,071
and you leave with
what you came in with,

232
00:15:01,398 --> 00:15:03,485
and the little soaps, I love those.

233
00:15:05,335 --> 00:15:07,582
I wish I knew what
you wanted, Joanie.

234
00:15:09,085 --> 00:15:10,571
I love this Roger,

235
00:15:11,645 --> 00:15:14,508
but a week is a considerable
length of time,

236
00:15:14,743 --> 00:15:16,328
and I have my own world.

237
00:15:16,585 --> 00:15:18,438
I go out and I have parties,

238
00:15:18,648 --> 00:15:20,050
and I have friends over.

239
00:15:20,326 --> 00:15:21,460
Male friends.

240
00:15:22,134 --> 00:15:23,135
Yes.

241
00:15:23,331 --> 00:15:24,410
I don't want to hear this.

242
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:26,806
Carol and I have
this nice little rotation.

243
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,695
Carol... the disaster.

244
00:15:29,897 --> 00:15:31,345
I've known carol since college,

245
00:15:31,523 --> 00:15:32,783
and she's been a good friend,

246
00:15:33,157 --> 00:15:34,512
and she's bright, and she's neat.

247
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,889
So you think you'd be lonely?

248
00:15:38,086 --> 00:15:40,518
I think it would be half
as much fun alone.

249
00:15:41,084 --> 00:15:42,394
You could get a bird.

250
00:15:42,961 --> 00:15:44,654
They're fairly neat for animals.

251
00:15:50,326 --> 00:15:51,770
If you had your way,

252
00:15:52,077 --> 00:15:54,272
I would be stranded
in some paperweight

253
00:15:54,463 --> 00:15:55,949
with my legs stuck in the air.

254
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,369
Wait, wait-wait,

255
00:15:57,631 --> 00:16:00,309
you're just gonna paint that
picture and go, huh?

256
00:16:04,465 --> 00:16:05,465
Can't we...

257
00:16:07,029 --> 00:16:08,304
Just enjoy this?

258
00:16:08,526 --> 00:16:09,534
I mean,

259
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:13,676
we both know
I'll eventually find a more

260
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:17,181
permanent situation, and you'll find

261
00:16:18,539 --> 00:16:19,642
a new model,

262
00:16:20,778 --> 00:16:22,770
the 61's are coming out soon.

263
00:16:24,403 --> 00:16:26,452
I hear the fins are bigger next year.

264
00:16:29,515 --> 00:16:30,743
Whatever you want, red.

265
00:16:53,372 --> 00:16:54,836
I see why they want the guns.

266
00:16:55,978 --> 00:16:58,645
It's tough to compete with
Bermuda only three hours away.

267
00:16:59,857 --> 00:17:01,630
Helps if they stop blowing up hotels.

268
00:17:02,954 --> 00:17:05,186
Kill me, you busty Jewist.

269
00:17:07,074 --> 00:17:08,847
Maybe we should try and
exploit the danger,

270
00:17:09,058 --> 00:17:11,336
instead of fighting it...
travel as adventure.

271
00:17:11,639 --> 00:17:13,069
Or how bout this?

272
00:17:13,723 --> 00:17:15,281
Average American family of three

273
00:17:15,481 --> 00:17:17,490
standing on the shore,
suitcases in hand,

274
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,215
the red sea parts before them.

275
00:17:19,451 --> 00:17:22,780
On the other side waits
a gleaming four star resort,

276
00:17:23,344 --> 00:17:25,039
"shouldn't you see the promise land?"

277
00:17:25,765 --> 00:17:27,146
Take religion out.

278
00:17:27,389 --> 00:17:29,998
They've got plenty of stations
of the cross traffic.

279
00:17:30,255 --> 00:17:31,441
I've skimmed this research,

280
00:17:31,664 --> 00:17:33,005
and the whole thing's pretty red.

281
00:17:33,451 --> 00:17:35,767
These communes, kibitzes,

282
00:17:36,766 --> 00:17:37,969
it's positively soviet.

283
00:17:39,451 --> 00:17:41,588
Except the daughters of
the American revolution

284
00:17:41,764 --> 00:17:43,784
are shuttling this book up
and down fifth avenue.

285
00:17:43,995 --> 00:17:46,227
It's a good story. They start in
these prison camps...

286
00:17:46,487 --> 00:17:48,898
Real prisoners, then
the next thing you know,

287
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,857
they're in the desert,
armed to the teeth,

288
00:17:51,121 --> 00:17:54,068
cutting their way through
the enemy, dying for the cause,

289
00:17:54,331 --> 00:17:55,695
and then they have a government.

290
00:17:55,955 --> 00:17:57,381
A commie government.

291
00:17:57,631 --> 00:17:59,040
Made my mother cry.

292
00:17:59,792 --> 00:18:01,688
So, we have a quasi communist state

293
00:18:02,453 --> 00:18:04,033
where women have guns,

294
00:18:04,454 --> 00:18:06,017
and it's filled with Jews.

295
00:18:06,264 --> 00:18:07,378
Well not completely filled,

296
00:18:07,601 --> 00:18:09,375
let's not forget that
there are also Arabs.

297
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,171
They've got oranges.

298
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:12,545
As far as I can see,

299
00:18:12,805 --> 00:18:15,105
the biggest thing this place
has going for it,

300
00:18:15,422 --> 00:18:16,591
the people are good looking.

301
00:18:18,453 --> 00:18:20,629
The Jews there don't look
like the Jews here.

302
00:18:21,272 --> 00:18:23,470
Have you been to
the diamond district?

303
00:18:26,604 --> 00:18:28,530
All right, I have to make
a couple phone calls.

304
00:18:28,682 --> 00:18:29,687
Let's pick this up later.

305
00:18:35,883 --> 00:18:37,398
Peggy, will you get me
a private line please?

306
00:18:37,515 --> 00:18:38,936
Right away, mr. Draper.

307
00:18:56,259 --> 00:18:57,903
<i>Donald Draper, line two.</i>

308
00:19:09,141 --> 00:19:10,853
I debated not taking the call.

309
00:19:11,893 --> 00:19:13,955
I'm glad you did, I need to see you.

310
00:19:14,828 --> 00:19:16,696
I don't think that's a good idea.

311
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,694
<i>It's business.</i>

312
00:19:19,142 --> 00:19:20,363
Meet me for a drink.

313
00:19:20,623 --> 00:19:21,781
I'm busy this evening.

314
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:23,908
I wouldn't of called
if it wasn't important.

315
00:19:24,873 --> 00:19:26,482
<i>I should still be able
to talk to you.</i>

316
00:19:26,634 --> 00:19:27,973
<i>Give me credit for that.</i>

317
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:32,586
Lunch, tomorrow.

318
00:19:33,023 --> 00:19:33,751
Lunch.

319
00:19:34,892 --> 00:19:36,907
<i>The tea room at </i>The Pierre<i>... 12:15.</i>

320
00:19:37,641 --> 00:19:39,010
Message received.

321
00:20:12,216 --> 00:20:13,701
It's so muggy tonight.

322
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:19,277
Did you just get a library card?

323
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:21,757
I rarely see you read anything
that doesn't have

324
00:20:22,017 --> 00:20:23,740
a manila folder wrapped around it.

325
00:20:26,273 --> 00:20:27,765
You should clean the gutters.

326
00:20:29,537 --> 00:20:30,600
This weekend.

327
00:20:31,507 --> 00:20:32,571
Is that good?

328
00:20:34,385 --> 00:20:36,839
Well, there's less action
than I thought.

329
00:20:37,071 --> 00:20:38,752
I thought it was a romance.

330
00:20:40,696 --> 00:20:42,778
You know, the first boy
I ever kissed was Jewish.

331
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,452
How did that happen?

332
00:20:46,953 --> 00:20:49,806
My friend, Deirdre Shaw was
friends with a Jewish girl,

333
00:20:50,855 --> 00:20:54,202
Beth Goldsilver or something.

334
00:20:55,342 --> 00:20:57,918
Beth invited us to a mixer at
her Synagogue in lower mareine.

335
00:20:59,945 --> 00:21:01,717
Surprised your mother let you go.

336
00:21:02,811 --> 00:21:04,995
Well, it was a fundraiser
for charity.

337
00:21:06,284 --> 00:21:08,804
Those poor skinny people
in the boats.

338
00:21:09,298 --> 00:21:11,365
This boy danced with me all evening,

339
00:21:11,782 --> 00:21:13,156
David Rosenberg.

340
00:21:15,158 --> 00:21:16,602
He was very good looking,

341
00:21:16,822 --> 00:21:19,857
but there was something
about him that was gloomy.

342
00:21:20,813 --> 00:21:22,318
Was he a good kisser?

343
00:21:24,364 --> 00:21:26,864
Let's just say he had
more practice than I did.

344
00:21:27,696 --> 00:21:29,617
Yeah, I'm sure he was
very disappointed.

345
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:31,729
Please, the only reason he picked me

346
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,760
is because I wasn't part
of the Synagogue.

347
00:21:34,032 --> 00:21:35,806
In fact, the next day
on the school bus,

348
00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:38,824
Beth told everyone I was necking
with David Rosenberg.

349
00:21:39,434 --> 00:21:40,753
The looks they gave me.

350
00:21:45,283 --> 00:21:47,866
They were all blondes
by the next summer.

351
00:21:58,252 --> 00:21:59,579
Honey, it's hot,

352
00:22:01,241 --> 00:22:03,859
and I have to read this book
about the desert.

353
00:22:05,194 --> 00:22:06,286
Of course,

354
00:22:07,449 --> 00:22:08,470
go ahead.

355
00:22:13,257 --> 00:22:15,037
We should get an
air conditioner up here.

356
00:22:15,822 --> 00:22:17,073
Yeah, we'll see.

357
00:22:25,809 --> 00:22:27,347
Hi, Fellas, come on in.

358
00:22:28,048 --> 00:22:29,293
Did you see this?

359
00:22:29,843 --> 00:22:31,781
Someone broke into
the Yankees equipment locker

360
00:22:32,028 --> 00:22:34,623
in Cleveland yesterday, swiped
Mickey Mantle's pet glove.

361
00:22:35,401 --> 00:22:36,854
They should of taken his bat.

362
00:22:37,685 --> 00:22:39,846
Should I wait for you
to have your breakfast?

363
00:22:40,174 --> 00:22:42,356
A day without orange juice
is a hell of a long day.

364
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,754
Hey look man, no hands.

365
00:22:47,206 --> 00:22:48,368
"Belle Jolie."

366
00:22:48,745 --> 00:22:51,282
I've been looking at the work
of our esteemed predecessors,

367
00:22:51,542 --> 00:22:52,787
I'm not heartened.

368
00:22:53,158 --> 00:22:56,385
They make more colors of lipstick than
<i>Howard Johnson</i> has ice cream flavors,

369
00:22:56,655 --> 00:22:58,240
but their sales are in the crapper.

370
00:22:58,447 --> 00:22:59,605
These names...

371
00:22:59,867 --> 00:23:01,288
Passion flower peach,

372
00:23:01,663 --> 00:23:03,142
tropical bourdois red,

373
00:23:03,554 --> 00:23:05,212
look ethel roserburg pink.

374
00:23:06,195 --> 00:23:07,663
Wear it to the chair.

375
00:23:08,814 --> 00:23:10,475
Did you know that lipstick
was invented

376
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:12,719
to simulate the flush in
a woman's face,

377
00:23:12,966 --> 00:23:14,429
after you treated her right?

378
00:23:15,692 --> 00:23:17,535
If you're gonna quote
the research report,

379
00:23:17,794 --> 00:23:19,185
don't start with "did you know."

380
00:23:23,823 --> 00:23:25,107
Research, I'm stumped.

381
00:23:25,512 --> 00:23:27,563
I'll be honest, I don't speak moron.

382
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:29,728
Do either of you speak moron?

383
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,972
Let's throw it to the chickens.

384
00:23:37,514 --> 00:23:39,257
Okay girls, come on in.

385
00:23:40,259 --> 00:23:41,984
Come on in ladies, gather around.

386
00:23:47,083 --> 00:23:48,163
Settle down.

387
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,340
What no lunch?

388
00:23:50,618 --> 00:23:51,509
No dear,

389
00:23:51,769 --> 00:23:54,751
this is better. Belle Jolie wants us
to tell them what we think

390
00:23:54,998 --> 00:23:56,771
about their new line of lipsticks.

391
00:24:03,888 --> 00:24:05,481
One way glass.

392
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:07,649
Doesn't it seem weird to you?

393
00:24:07,886 --> 00:24:09,902
It should be two way glass, right?

394
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,737
I don't care what they call it.

395
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,142
Beats the hell out of x-ray specs.

396
00:24:15,951 --> 00:24:17,410
It's called brainstorming.

397
00:24:17,637 --> 00:24:18,828
That sounds intimidating,

398
00:24:19,088 --> 00:24:20,330
is it like a test?

399
00:24:20,964 --> 00:24:23,169
There are no wrong answers. You just
be your pretty little selves.

400
00:24:23,286 --> 00:24:24,291
Grab a lipstick,

401
00:24:24,551 --> 00:24:25,893
grab a mirror, and sit down.

402
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:39,323
And remember, the mirror could be
your best friend, or your worst enemy.

403
00:24:43,827 --> 00:24:45,043
Has no taste.

404
00:24:46,907 --> 00:24:48,160
Ugly dress.

405
00:24:52,764 --> 00:24:54,203
Horrible wig.

406
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,469
They're brainstorming.

407
00:24:58,891 --> 00:25:00,891
I wouldn't expect more
than a few sprinkles.

408
00:25:02,187 --> 00:25:03,878
I love it when they do that.

409
00:25:04,202 --> 00:25:05,782
My little blowfish.

410
00:25:09,306 --> 00:25:11,243
Anybody mind if I take off my pants?

411
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:16,584
Red one's for me.

412
00:25:17,202 --> 00:25:18,762
How many lipsticks do you own?

413
00:25:19,729 --> 00:25:22,301
Gee, I don't know.
I'd have to go home and count.

414
00:25:22,906 --> 00:25:25,148
Do you match your lipcolor
to your clothing

415
00:25:25,336 --> 00:25:26,803
or to your accessories?

416
00:25:28,139 --> 00:25:30,065
I know, that seems like
a loaded question.

417
00:25:30,932 --> 00:25:32,102
It is unloaded

418
00:25:32,348 --> 00:25:34,867
and I insist you curb your
editorial comments.

419
00:25:35,493 --> 00:25:37,642
Sometimes I match it
to my nail polish?

420
00:25:37,829 --> 00:25:38,490
Good answer.

421
00:25:39,516 --> 00:25:40,516
Go ahead.

422
00:25:41,265 --> 00:25:43,245
Do you change your lipcolor
with the seasons?

423
00:25:45,767 --> 00:25:47,335
You, stand over there.

424
00:25:56,951 --> 00:26:00,346
At what point do we start running
electricity through the chairs?

425
00:26:01,108 --> 00:26:03,974
We should of put a man in there,
so they'd take it seriously.

426
00:26:06,956 --> 00:26:07,811
Good,

427
00:26:08,071 --> 00:26:09,847
I was afraid I'd missed it.

428
00:26:27,299 --> 00:26:29,282
I want to stand and salute that.

429
00:26:41,102 --> 00:26:42,929
what's with the mouse ears
over there?

430
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:54,964
Thanks for coming.

431
00:27:56,315 --> 00:27:57,864
- Can I get you anything?
- No.

432
00:28:02,939 --> 00:28:04,613
- How have you been?
- Fine.

433
00:28:05,646 --> 00:28:06,738
Fine, tired.

434
00:28:08,006 --> 00:28:09,257
Doesn't show.

435
00:28:11,255 --> 00:28:13,433
I'm in the middle
of spring inventory.

436
00:28:14,753 --> 00:28:17,566
I hope you're not gonna tell me
that the grand plan  for remaking

437
00:28:17,826 --> 00:28:19,127
our store has a hitch in it.

438
00:28:21,317 --> 00:28:22,533
You look beautiful.

439
00:28:23,879 --> 00:28:26,627
I thought you had
urgent business to discuss.

440
00:28:28,128 --> 00:28:29,462
Anything for the lady?

441
00:28:29,754 --> 00:28:31,424
Nothing for me, coffee.

442
00:28:32,022 --> 00:28:33,690
- Irish coffee?
- Coffee.

443
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:41,130
Business?

444
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:46,070
Turns out Israel tourism

445
00:28:46,472 --> 00:28:48,514
is considering becoming a client,

446
00:28:48,774 --> 00:28:50,927
and I'm having a hard time
getting a handle on it.

447
00:28:51,148 --> 00:28:53,102
And I'm the only jew you know
in New York city?

448
00:28:54,132 --> 00:28:55,062
You're my favorite.

449
00:28:55,628 --> 00:28:58,273
Jesus, Don, crack
a book once in a while.

450
00:28:58,533 --> 00:28:59,947
I have,

451
00:29:00,423 --> 00:29:03,403
it's all sentimental.
World War II trivia, oranges...

452
00:29:03,968 --> 00:29:05,489
Kids in blue and white hats.

453
00:29:05,749 --> 00:29:07,655
They're doing the movie of
"Exodus" with Paul Newman.

454
00:29:08,254 --> 00:29:09,769
Paul Newman, that's nice.

455
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,703
Now I have two reasons to see it.

456
00:29:14,066 --> 00:29:15,066
Damn it.

457
00:29:19,471 --> 00:29:21,150
You're usually so put together.

458
00:29:34,069 --> 00:29:36,168
I'll say one thing about Israelis,

459
00:29:37,566 --> 00:29:38,730
don't cross them.

460
00:29:40,567 --> 00:29:44,278
Well those people at the meeting
were definitely zionists.

461
00:29:45,568 --> 00:29:47,506
Zion just means Israel,

462
00:29:48,351 --> 00:29:49,678
it's a very old name.

463
00:29:51,215 --> 00:29:53,892
I'm sorry, I'm not an expert on this,
and something feels strange

464
00:29:54,067 --> 00:29:55,247
about being treated like one.

465
00:29:55,632 --> 00:29:57,201
I just want to know
something about it

466
00:29:57,331 --> 00:29:59,543
that doesn't come from some
administrative propaganda.

467
00:29:59,803 --> 00:30:02,089
Well here's some more
World War II trivia,

468
00:30:02,773 --> 00:30:05,241
they just arrested <i>Adolf Eichmann</i>*
in Argentina last week,

469
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,592
have you seen his resume?

470
00:30:08,193 --> 00:30:09,409
Okay, I deserved that,

471
00:30:11,096 --> 00:30:14,308
but I'm talking about
tourists going to Israel.

472
00:30:15,013 --> 00:30:16,375
I don't know what I can say.

473
00:30:16,704 --> 00:30:19,569
I'm american, I'm really
not very Jewish.

474
00:30:21,028 --> 00:30:22,508
If my mother hadn't died having me,

475
00:30:22,696 --> 00:30:24,516
I could have been Marilyn
instead of Rachel,

476
00:30:24,703 --> 00:30:26,406
and no one would know the difference.

477
00:30:26,632 --> 00:30:27,677
What is the difference?

478
00:30:30,881 --> 00:30:33,744
Look, Jews have lived in exile

479
00:30:34,344 --> 00:30:35,913
for a long time.

480
00:30:36,695 --> 00:30:38,299
First in Babylon, then

481
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:41,830
all over the world...
Shanghal, Brooklyn, and

482
00:30:42,851 --> 00:30:44,777
we've managed to make a go of it.

483
00:30:46,338 --> 00:30:47,759
Maybe it has something
to do with the fact

484
00:30:47,829 --> 00:30:50,177
that we thrive at doing business
with people who hate us.

485
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,806
I don't hate you.

486
00:30:56,494 --> 00:30:58,220
No, individuals are wonderful.

487
00:30:58,904 --> 00:31:00,062
That's not what I meant.

488
00:31:02,061 --> 00:31:03,153
I don't know...

489
00:31:05,008 --> 00:31:07,788
A country for those people,

490
00:31:08,175 --> 00:31:09,631
as you call us, well

491
00:31:11,545 --> 00:31:13,075
seems very important.

492
00:31:14,883 --> 00:31:16,287
Why aren't you there?

493
00:31:17,632 --> 00:31:18,942
My life is here.

494
00:31:19,874 --> 00:31:23,052
My grandfather came from Russia,
now I have a store on fifth avenue.

495
00:31:23,692 --> 00:31:26,240
I'll visit, but I don't have
to live there.

496
00:31:26,742 --> 00:31:27,742
Just...

497
00:31:28,663 --> 00:31:29,712
Has to be.

498
00:31:31,582 --> 00:31:34,059
For me, it's more of
an idea than a place.

499
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:36,678
Utopia.

500
00:31:39,926 --> 00:31:40,936
Maybe.

501
00:31:47,857 --> 00:31:50,529
They taught us at barnard
about that word...

502
00:31:51,304 --> 00:31:52,490
Utopia.

503
00:31:54,855 --> 00:31:57,059
The greeks had two meanings for it,

504
00:31:57,465 --> 00:32:00,213
utopos- meaning the good place,

505
00:32:01,569 --> 00:32:03,041
and utopos-

506
00:32:05,244 --> 00:32:07,421
meaning the place that cannot be.

507
00:32:12,374 --> 00:32:14,192
I have to get back to the office.

508
00:32:21,623 --> 00:32:23,418
I better not see this on my bill.

509
00:32:28,618 --> 00:32:30,475
Okay, girls, playtime's over,

510
00:32:30,675 --> 00:32:33,199
time to put down your lipsticks,
and head back to your desks.

511
00:32:33,565 --> 00:32:35,960
Thank you for your cooperation
and your lips.

512
00:32:37,544 --> 00:32:38,952
These go in the closet.

513
00:32:46,187 --> 00:32:48,765
Well now we have to count
he shades they tried,

514
00:32:49,047 --> 00:32:51,231
can you bring me those tissues, dear?

515
00:32:54,773 --> 00:32:56,011
Here's your basket of kisses.

516
00:32:57,727 --> 00:33:00,640
Basket of kisses... that's cute.

517
00:33:01,402 --> 00:33:02,434
Who told you that?

518
00:33:03,937 --> 00:33:05,177
What do you mean?

519
00:33:05,437 --> 00:33:06,759
Where'd you hear that?

520
00:33:07,266 --> 00:33:08,628
I just thought of it.

521
00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:10,650
Isn't that what it is?

522
00:33:12,887 --> 00:33:14,625
It is, sweetheart.

523
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,179
Which color did you like?

524
00:33:17,873 --> 00:33:20,322
I didn't get the one I liked,
someone took my color.

525
00:33:20,937 --> 00:33:22,601
Why didn't you choose another one?

526
00:33:22,841 --> 00:33:24,210
I'm very particular.

527
00:33:25,087 --> 00:33:26,872
As opposed to the other girls?

528
00:33:28,463 --> 00:33:29,463
I don't know...

529
00:33:30,463 --> 00:33:33,741
I don't think anyone wants to be
one of a hundred colors in a box.

530
00:33:34,921 --> 00:33:36,339
I think that's enough complaining.

531
00:33:36,506 --> 00:33:38,340
Why don't you head back to
your desk, Peggy?

532
00:33:42,838 --> 00:33:45,459
Bet you wish you could
put that in a glass and drink it.

533
00:34:04,567 --> 00:34:07,433
Peggy, clear the rest of
my afternoon, would you please?

534
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:10,244
<i>You have the sliders Ketchup
people at 3 o'clock.</i>

535
00:34:11,527 --> 00:34:14,718
Have a box of cigars sent over
to Jim King with my apologies.

536
00:34:15,338 --> 00:34:16,656
<i>I'll find out what he smokes.</i>

537
00:34:17,279 --> 00:34:18,401
Good girl.

538
00:34:20,529 --> 00:34:22,441
- You got a minute, chief?
- Just.

539
00:34:23,527 --> 00:34:24,653
You don't mind, do you?

540
00:34:24,852 --> 00:34:26,268
Use a glass, freddy.

541
00:34:27,901 --> 00:34:29,934
Your girl full of surprises.

542
00:34:31,515 --> 00:34:32,877
Pretty Peggy Sue.

543
00:34:33,213 --> 00:34:34,329
Peggy?

544
00:34:35,528 --> 00:34:36,639
If you say so.

545
00:34:37,527 --> 00:34:39,114
I try to avoid eye contact to avoid

546
00:34:39,374 --> 00:34:41,158
being blinded by the earnestness.

547
00:34:43,151 --> 00:34:44,630
Actually, she really stood out,

548
00:34:44,841 --> 00:34:46,092
brainstorming wise.

549
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:47,464
Brainstorming?

550
00:34:48,216 --> 00:34:49,416
Sorry I missed that.

551
00:34:50,116 --> 00:34:51,126
What was the line?

552
00:34:51,717 --> 00:34:52,878
"A bucket of kisses."

553
00:34:53,138 --> 00:34:54,212
"basket of kisses."

554
00:34:54,472 --> 00:34:55,321
bucket sounds better.

555
00:34:55,515 --> 00:34:56,840
If you like them wet and sloppy.

556
00:34:58,339 --> 00:35:00,493
Point is, while the rest of
the hens were busy

557
00:35:00,716 --> 00:35:02,171
pulling out each other feathers,

558
00:35:02,362 --> 00:35:04,306
that one saw the benefit,
not the feature.

559
00:35:05,087 --> 00:35:06,092
- Really?
- Yeah,

560
00:35:06,214 --> 00:35:07,434
she said she didn't want to be

561
00:35:07,694 --> 00:35:09,644
one of a hundred colors in a box.

562
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:13,690
That's interesting, isn't it?

563
00:35:14,583 --> 00:35:15,663
It is.

564
00:35:16,453 --> 00:35:19,252
It was like watching
a dog play the piano.

565
00:35:41,345 --> 00:35:42,789
<i>It's me, Barbara can you talk?</i>

566
00:35:43,135 --> 00:35:46,223
She's still sleeping, thank God,
what's on your mind?

567
00:35:47,571 --> 00:35:49,351
I think I might of met somebody.

568
00:35:49,948 --> 00:35:51,000
You're not sure?

569
00:35:51,258 --> 00:35:52,354
That's good.

570
00:35:53,384 --> 00:35:55,414
He has some serious limitations.

571
00:35:55,758 --> 00:35:57,088
<i>Does he work in the store?</i>

572
00:35:57,384 --> 00:35:59,486
No, he doesn't work at the store.

573
00:35:59,746 --> 00:36:01,295
Well, he has a job, doesn't he?

574
00:36:01,509 --> 00:36:02,509
<i>Yes.</i>

575
00:36:02,884 --> 00:36:04,098
Then what's the problem?

576
00:36:04,327 --> 00:36:05,700
Would daddy like him?

577
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:08,510
Daddy would hate him.

578
00:36:08,864 --> 00:36:10,288
So, he's not Jewish.

579
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:15,210
<i>Who cares what daddy thinks.</i>

580
00:36:15,879 --> 00:36:17,711
He's not your boyfriend anymore.

581
00:36:18,348 --> 00:36:22,008
<i>You're 28-years-old.
You work 60 hours a week,</i>

582
00:36:22,271 --> 00:36:24,443
the last thing you want is
to end up like aunt Rosie,

583
00:36:24,514 --> 00:36:26,805
lying to your nieces about
how many engagements you had.

584
00:36:27,388 --> 00:36:28,765
Aunt Rosie wasn't lying.

585
00:36:29,024 --> 00:36:31,101
Please, there was
no max the communist.

586
00:36:32,138 --> 00:36:33,319
<i>Does he have all his hair?</i>

587
00:36:33,477 --> 00:36:34,769
More than he'll ever need.

588
00:36:34,963 --> 00:36:36,290
<i>Is he funny?</i>

589
00:36:37,026 --> 00:36:39,351
Sometimes, after a couple.

590
00:36:40,282 --> 00:36:43,065
So he's a schecker,
daddy will hate him.

591
00:36:44,511 --> 00:36:46,463
I do feel this attraction.

592
00:36:47,074 --> 00:36:50,370
I want him, and I want to ignore
everything else about him.

593
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:54,249
It's 1960, we don't live in a shadow,
we can marry for love.

594
00:36:55,198 --> 00:36:57,237
I'm not sure people do that anymore.

595
00:36:57,559 --> 00:36:59,919
<i>Why do you always
have to be so cynical?</i>

596
00:37:02,642 --> 00:37:04,168
Because sometimes...

597
00:37:04,826 --> 00:37:06,016
Things come...

598
00:37:06,824 --> 00:37:09,008
good things, but there's
no future in them.

599
00:37:09,548 --> 00:37:11,791
You're a modern woman, Rach,
forget the wedding.

600
00:37:12,949 --> 00:37:15,895
Believe me, I'd do anything
for some romance right now.

601
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:27,014
Peggy.

602
00:37:27,265 --> 00:37:28,265
Hi, Joan.

603
00:37:29,889 --> 00:37:33,332
Mr. Rumsen would like you
to put your industrious little mind

604
00:37:33,567 --> 00:37:35,999
towards coming up with copy
for <i>Belle Jolie</i> lipsticks.

605
00:37:38,326 --> 00:37:40,476
I don't understand, they want me
to write something?

606
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:42,010
Whatever you said in that

607
00:37:42,265 --> 00:37:44,716
brainstorming session, apparently
knocked their socks off.

608
00:37:45,965 --> 00:37:47,116
My gosh!

609
00:37:48,346 --> 00:37:49,346
I don't know what to say.

610
00:37:49,606 --> 00:37:51,973
You will of course continue
to cover mr. Draper's desk.

611
00:37:52,233 --> 00:37:54,597
Any writing you do will be
on your own time.

612
00:37:55,078 --> 00:37:56,087
Do I get a raise?

613
00:37:56,263 --> 00:37:58,271
No... Congratulations.

614
00:37:58,546 --> 00:38:00,565
More work and more responsibility.

615
00:38:01,826 --> 00:38:04,172
I guess you'll be entitled
to some dinner money.

616
00:38:04,577 --> 00:38:05,735
That's swell.

617
00:38:06,471 --> 00:38:07,822
Maybe I should go and thank them.

618
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:11,618
I'm not really dressed...
tomorrow maybe.

619
00:38:11,982 --> 00:38:13,826
No need. They wanted me to tell you.

620
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,520
They were very specific about it.

621
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,083
You know what they say,

622
00:38:18,512 --> 00:38:20,226
the medium is the message.

623
00:38:37,576 --> 00:38:41,137
And here I was just wishing for
a man to help me with my yard work.

624
00:38:51,261 --> 00:38:52,266
Sorry.

625
00:38:52,516 --> 00:38:54,424
That's what I get for being domestic.

626
00:38:55,015 --> 00:38:56,377
Let's get this off.

627
00:39:01,389 --> 00:39:02,887
God, hold that...

628
00:39:03,509 --> 00:39:04,514
The thought.

629
00:39:17,202 --> 00:39:18,202
Hi, Roy.

630
00:39:18,454 --> 00:39:19,772
Hi beautiful,

631
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:23,011
what's shaking?

632
00:39:28,046 --> 00:39:29,487
Busy dance card, huh?

633
00:39:31,435 --> 00:39:32,657
This is my friend, Don Draper.

634
00:39:32,917 --> 00:39:34,641
Don, this is Roy Hazlett.

635
00:39:35,416 --> 00:39:36,161
Pleasure.

636
00:39:37,767 --> 00:39:39,247
Ian's playing down at the Gas Light.

637
00:39:39,462 --> 00:39:41,609
We're gonna go support him,
pass the basket, you in?

638
00:39:43,452 --> 00:39:44,961
That is if dad will let you out.

639
00:39:45,345 --> 00:39:47,005
Well, that sounds like fun, Don,

640
00:39:47,357 --> 00:39:49,424
- We should go down for a while.
- Come on, it will be a kick.

641
00:39:49,731 --> 00:39:51,384
What do you say, afraid
you'll miss 531?

642
00:39:55,254 --> 00:39:56,389
I think I'm gonna stay here.

643
00:40:03,156 --> 00:40:05,681
I'll wear a skirt and nothing else.

644
00:40:14,112 --> 00:40:15,391
What took you so long?

645
00:40:15,646 --> 00:40:17,897
One of the media buyers ambushed
me in the elevator

646
00:40:18,117 --> 00:40:20,254
with tickets to the ballet
of all things.

647
00:40:21,011 --> 00:40:22,576
I told him I had plans
but he insisted

648
00:40:22,823 --> 00:40:25,324
we share a cab across town anyways.
And I couldn't shake him.

649
00:40:25,523 --> 00:40:27,333
Which one was it? George Asbury...

650
00:40:27,803 --> 00:40:28,954
he's a hound.

651
00:40:30,031 --> 00:40:32,544
It doesn't matter,
they're all just boys.

652
00:40:33,313 --> 00:40:35,508
The poor bastard probably
couldn't help himself.

653
00:40:35,704 --> 00:40:37,009
The way you glide around that

654
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:39,299
office like some magnificent ship.

655
00:40:41,154 --> 00:40:43,291
Well, I don't want to be a distraction.

656
00:40:43,748 --> 00:40:45,203
Shall I...

657
00:40:45,897 --> 00:40:48,433
order horse blinders for
the rest of the office?

658
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,774
You didn't?

659
00:40:54,883 --> 00:40:56,163
I sure did.

660
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:06,047
What am I supposed to do with it?

661
00:41:06,894 --> 00:41:09,879
The store lady said you can do anything
but put the cage on the radiator.

662
00:41:10,518 --> 00:41:11,816
You're terrible.

663
00:41:12,492 --> 00:41:14,728
Well, you can't blame
a man for trying.

664
00:41:15,145 --> 00:41:17,434
I just hate the thought
of having to share you.

665
00:41:19,588 --> 00:41:21,819
You don't have to share me now.

666
00:41:29,131 --> 00:41:31,304
Joanie, you smell so good.

667
00:41:31,547 --> 00:41:33,425
I've been thinking
about this all day.

668
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:38,323
Mona is looking at a weekend
in old saybrook with the in-laws.

669
00:41:39,799 --> 00:41:41,960
There's not enough
liquor in the world.

670
00:41:44,813 --> 00:41:45,813
Roger...

671
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:53,500
Sorry.

672
00:42:06,372 --> 00:42:07,729
"Mary Catherine Cahill,"

673
00:42:08,498 --> 00:42:10,394
"a daughter of Harriet M. Barr"

674
00:42:10,635 --> 00:42:13,735
"and Archibold W. Barr of
Stoneyton, Connecticut,"

675
00:42:13,996 --> 00:42:15,949
"and Kevin Mark Duncan the III,"

676
00:42:16,172 --> 00:42:18,156
"a son of Beatrice Hoslinger"

677
00:42:18,416 --> 00:42:21,004
"and Kevin Mark Duncan jr.
of Manhattan,"

678
00:42:21,589 --> 00:42:25,110
"were married last evening at the
episcopal church of the heavenly rest."

679
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:26,884
He travels around the country, and

680
00:42:27,095 --> 00:42:29,197
collects miniature replicas
of monuments...

681
00:42:29,551 --> 00:42:30,560
<i>Washington memorial</i>*,

682
00:42:30,781 --> 00:42:32,837
<i>Bunker Hill</i>*, <i>Mount Rushmore</i>*,
and then,

683
00:42:33,097 --> 00:42:34,454
he sticks them up his ass.

684
00:42:34,874 --> 00:42:36,161
Symbolism intended.

685
00:42:37,651 --> 00:42:39,225
Place to put your coats.

686
00:42:43,926 --> 00:42:45,248
Switch seats with me.

687
00:42:45,481 --> 00:42:46,481
No way.

688
00:42:46,658 --> 00:42:48,031
Can we get a round over here?

689
00:42:48,354 --> 00:42:49,354
Jack Daniels, scotches.

690
00:42:49,985 --> 00:42:51,276
Sounds like a great idea.

691
00:42:52,465 --> 00:42:55,304
Anyway, turns out, spanish cat
and I were mucho sympatico

692
00:42:55,551 --> 00:42:57,445
with the direction that
we talked about going.

693
00:42:57,705 --> 00:43:00,198
- With the theater of the people thing?
- Conscious drama.

694
00:43:00,458 --> 00:43:02,325
Not the soloist bullshit

695
00:43:02,585 --> 00:43:05,286
kept alive by the middle class,
with season tickets to

696
00:43:05,546 --> 00:43:07,106
<i>Dick Van Dyke</i>* and <i>Mary Martin</i>*.

697
00:43:07,411 --> 00:43:11,000
I bet Don here can tell you first hand,
Broadway's the birthplace of mediocrity.

698
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:15,546
Maybe it's born there,

699
00:43:15,806 --> 00:43:17,733
but I think it may be
conceived right here.

700
00:43:18,626 --> 00:43:21,330
"And take up residence
in Rye, New York."

701
00:43:33,345 --> 00:43:33,940
Thank you.

702
00:43:39,228 --> 00:43:40,363
So what do you do, Don?

703
00:43:40,766 --> 00:43:41,948
I blow up bridges.

704
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:44,393
Don's in advertising.

705
00:43:45,211 --> 00:43:46,211
No way.

706
00:43:46,547 --> 00:43:48,367
Madison avenue? What a gas!

707
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:50,415
We all have to serve somebody.

708
00:43:52,759 --> 00:43:55,777
Perpetuating a lie, how do
you sleep at night?

709
00:43:56,530 --> 00:43:57,792
On a bed made of money.

710
00:43:59,095 --> 00:44:00,563
Isn't this an education?

711
00:44:01,019 --> 00:44:03,074
You hucksters and your tower created

712
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:04,715
religion of mass consumption.

713
00:44:06,617 --> 00:44:09,142
People want to be told
what to do so badly,

714
00:44:09,901 --> 00:44:11,310
that they'll listen to anyone.

715
00:44:11,823 --> 00:44:15,106
When you say people, I have
a feeling you're talking about thou.

716
00:44:16,244 --> 00:44:18,299
And I have a feeling that
you spent more time

717
00:44:18,546 --> 00:44:20,403
on your hair this morning
than she did.

718
00:44:21,279 --> 00:44:23,419
You two want to head to the urinals
and poke it out?

719
00:44:26,902 --> 00:44:28,878
So, Roy, if you had a job,

720
00:44:30,778 --> 00:44:32,006
what would you do?

721
00:44:32,957 --> 00:44:34,436
I'm starting a theater,

722
00:44:34,778 --> 00:44:36,959
right here in the village...
it's a cooperative.

723
00:44:37,565 --> 00:44:39,606
Midge is gonna get in there
and paint some flags.

724
00:44:39,806 --> 00:44:41,203
I said I'd think about it.

725
00:44:42,526 --> 00:44:43,843
Last night,

726
00:44:44,188 --> 00:44:48,673
I dreamed of making love
to Fidel Castro,

727
00:44:49,504 --> 00:44:53,344
in a king size bed at
the Waldorf Astoria.

728
00:44:54,844 --> 00:44:58,039
Viva la revolution, he roared

729
00:44:58,714 --> 00:45:00,631
as he vanquished my dress.

730
00:45:02,028 --> 00:45:03,338
Outside the window,

731
00:45:03,653 --> 00:45:05,707
Nikita Kruschev watched us,

732
00:45:06,629 --> 00:45:08,355
plucking a chicken.

733
00:45:12,078 --> 00:45:13,153
Take off your shirt!

734
00:45:14,113 --> 00:45:15,224
Take your shirt off!

735
00:45:22,568 --> 00:45:24,152
I should go,

736
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:25,787
too much art for me.

737
00:45:26,010 --> 00:45:27,011
Stay,

738
00:45:27,819 --> 00:45:28,930
this is Ian.

739
00:45:31,472 --> 00:45:33,057
We'll go right afterwards.
