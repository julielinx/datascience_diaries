1
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:45,210
Sounds like the place.

2
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:47,472
I couldn't believe there were
two parties on this block.

3
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:48,911
I have no problem with Negroes.

4
00:00:49,015 --> 00:00:51,279
I'm just worried about the car.

5
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:53,750
We can still go home.
This was your idea.

6
00:00:53,853 --> 00:00:55,912
It's important that
we're here, for you.

7
00:00:56,022 --> 00:00:57,421
For the people that work for you.

8
00:00:57,524 --> 00:00:58,821
Lovely, go easy on that.

9
00:00:58,925 --> 00:01:00,358
Some of them don't feel that way.

10
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,757
Is my nose running?

11
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:27,110
- How are you?
- Hi.

12
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:28,482
Sorry about that, buddy.

13
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:30,146
What did you do with your coats?

14
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:31,951
We left them in the car.

15
00:01:32,058 --> 00:01:35,186
When we called to get directions
from somewhere else in New Jersey,

16
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:37,024
Paul gave Harry the idea.

17
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,825
I took my purse.

18
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,526
I can smell alcohol, but I don't see it.

19
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:42,931
It's him.

20
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:44,663
It's a party.

21
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,204
Cosgrove's doing great.

22
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,566
Let's go get a drink.

23
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:50,233
I'm going to stay here.

24
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:51,776
Come with me.

25
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:01,181
So you work for these stuffed shirts?

26
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:02,481
I work with them.

27
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:04,784
Peggy. Glad to see a familiar face.

28
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:06,085
Yes. How are you?

29
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:07,523
Introduce us to your friend.

30
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:08,821
Eugene, whom I just met,

31
00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:10,361
was telling me that at Princeton

32
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,795
Paul used to dress up like a girl.

33
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:16,266
According to him,
that's the way Shakespeare did it.

34
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:18,564
Looking stunning, as always.

35
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:21,730
Much too good for him.

36
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:23,399
What are you doing out here?

37
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,535
Not enough subterraneans
in the Village?

38
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:28,273
I'm here because this isn't
Greenwich Village.

39
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:29,712
This is America.

40
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,078
How do you get to the city?

41
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:33,948
The number 33 bus takes you
right to Port Authority.

42
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:36,112
Trust me, Montclair is the knees.

43
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:38,713
We have Globe Trotter Antiques.

44
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,292
We have the Wellmont Theater.

45
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:43,055
Silent movies with organ.

46
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,391
The Montclair Art Gallery.

47
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,522
George Inness. Have you heard of him?

48
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:47,725
Of course I have.

49
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,461
Come.

50
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:50,968
Enjoy.

51
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,560
Imbibe.

52
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,647
You're a button, you know that?

53
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:03,773
And you're drunk.

54
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:08,846
Can't get Donna here on my desk
because she keeps refusing.

55
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:10,980
You're not allowed to do that.

56
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,285
I can't feel my cheeks.

57
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:14,951
I can.

58
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:16,426
I feel them fine.

59
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,656
My mother says when you
can't feel your cheeks,

60
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:21,199
it's time to stop.

61
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:24,498
Well, what do I do with this?

62
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:27,402
There. That works.

63
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:29,270
Oh, my God.

64
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,037
Don't you and Kitty
have some place to be?

65
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:38,306
Apparently, when they say "on call,"

66
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:39,817
it does not mean "available by phone."

67
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,318
You have to be in the hospital.

68
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:43,082
I'm sorry he didn't make it.

69
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:44,588
I'm looking forward to meeting him.

70
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:47,524
I've been having this pain right here.

71
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:48,685
You've met him.

72
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:50,319
How could I forget?

73
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,524
Big, handsome, saves people's lives.

74
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:57,628
Why did you get the nice glass?

75
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:01,173
Because I have the Rhône Gallagher.

76
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:03,502
Fine. What is it?

77
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,602
There's a ship that went down in 1871,

78
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:08,874
and the casks of Rhône were on it.

79
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:10,415
It was a very good year.

80
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:12,143
And it sank,

81
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:15,153
and they washed up
on shore two years ago,

82
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,485
and they sold 180 bottles,

83
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,455
and I have one.

84
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:21,186
But not a sofa.

85
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:24,927
Joan, I want you to meet someone.

86
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:26,623
My baby... Sheila.

87
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,030
Sheila White.

88
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:30,859
Joan is our senior secretary.

89
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,267
Office manager.

90
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:33,805
Sheila's an assistant manager.

91
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:35,840
At the Food Fair in South Orange.

92
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,034
She's saving for school.

93
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:39,611
- Kinsey!
- What?

94
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:41,703
The man upstairs is here.

95
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:43,111
God?

96
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:46,151
No. It's Mr. Hoffenberg.

97
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:48,152
He wants to talk to you.

98
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:50,313
He smells marijuana.

99
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:54,958
Don't talk until I get back.

100
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:56,756
I'm serious.

101
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:01,324
I don't think we have
a Food Fair in Manhattan.

102
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:03,265
Is it a big market with a parking lot?

103
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:04,563
It is.

104
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:05,865
Well, one day you'll drive in

105
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,439
in a station wagon
and be a customer.

106
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,303
I grew up out here.

107
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:10,569
I've already been a customer.

108
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:15,846
It's fun to meet the boys,
put faces with names.

109
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:17,848
Well, it's good to see
you and Paul together.

110
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,510
I have to say, when Paul
and I were together,

111
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,612
the last thing I would have
taken him for was open-minded.

112
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:27,089
I love your purse.

113
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:30,919
Thanks. I just got it.

114
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,132
What's that?

115
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,439
Marjorie. Works at the newsstand.

116
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:42,974
I like.

117
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:44,805
But behind her.

118
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:47,969
You stole that.

119
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:49,742
That's from the office.

120
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,544
That dumb girl almost got fired.

121
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:53,380
But she didn't.

122
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:56,649
I'm a writer. I need it.

123
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:08,662
Hey, Brooklyn, come home with me.

124
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:14,136
Why not? I live alone.

125
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,071
Why should I?

126
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:19,110
Because I like you,
and we're having a good time,

127
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,009
and I'm a good kisser,

128
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:23,446
and you know you want to.

129
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,346
Eugene.

130
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:28,249
I'm in the persuasion business,

131
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:31,755
and frankly, I'm disappointed
by your presentation.

132
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:40,957
Come on.

133
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:21,033
Fifth Avenue's a parking lot,
in both directions.

134
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,506
Traffic makes the parade look bigger.

135
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,076
What parade?

136
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:26,702
Colonel Glenn.

137
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:31,444
It's incredible what passes
for heroism these days.

138
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:33,576
I'd like ticker tape
for pulling out of my driveway

139
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:35,415
and going around the block three times.

140
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:37,955
It's not like people were shooting at him.

141
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:39,388
I think he's a winner.

142
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:42,052
Square jaw, false modesty.

143
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:44,288
Looks like he just took off
his letterman jacket.

144
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:46,922
You going to go down there
with your autograph book at lunch?

145
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:01,211
Can I just fire everyone?

146
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:04,272
Excuse me!

147
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:09,646
Excuse me!

148
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:11,689
This is a place of business.

149
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:14,624
Colonel Glenn will be on Earth
for the rest of his life.

150
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:16,160
Plane went down.

151
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:18,093
American Airlines
Flight 1 to Los Angeles.

152
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:20,358
Crashed in Jamaica Bay.

153
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:23,230
...had suddenly become locked
in a death dive into the bay...

154
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,395
There could be
a hundred people on there.

155
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:26,870
Just fell out of the sky.

156
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:30,966
...turn prescribed
by Idlewild Airport rules.

157
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:34,672
The Federal Aviation Agency
said there is no rational basis

158
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:39,012
for grounding the Boeing 707
as a result of the crash.

159
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:42,246
Federal Aviation
administrator Najeeb Halaby

160
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,879
- summarizing...
- Turn it off.

161
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,185
...of the investigation
said there was no...

162
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:49,089
Pull all Mohawk ROP.

163
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,719
And anything in production, stop it.

164
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,559
But it wasn't a Mohawk plane.

165
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:54,257
We don't want people
opening their morning paper

166
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,927
and seeing a Mohawk ad
next to a picture of a floating engine.

167
00:08:58,437 --> 00:08:59,995
The rest of you, stop crying

168
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:02,267
and figure out how we're going
to hit the ground running

169
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,400
in three weeks with new work.

170
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:05,636
Excuse me.

171
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:07,474
Well, for one thing,

172
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,674
we should probably avoid
the term "hit the ground."

173
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:14,513
How about "Idlewild to Rockaway
in less than eight minutes"?

174
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:20,084
Answer the phone, sweetheart.

175
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,863
- Some of the passengers...
- Sterling Cooper.

176
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:26,761
...were on their way
to a golf tournament.

177
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:28,891
Apparently, the minute the plane hit,

178
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:30,263
the bay turned plaid.

179
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,566
Get back to work.

180
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:39,036
Jets are made for dropping
bombs on Moscow,

181
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:40,442
not French cuisine.

182
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:45,675
Although I like those
little girls they have.

183
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:48,811
You know, they're completely captive.

184
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,087
Mr. Phillips to see you.

185
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:55,158
Send him in.

186
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,735
Someone should tell Draper
to pull everything from Mohawk.

187
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:05,997
He knows that.

188
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,666
I just had an interesting conversation
with Shel Keneally.

189
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,333
He's inside of American Airlines.

190
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:12,775
Is the plane still crashed?

191
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,208
Shel was a client
when I was at Y&R in London.

192
00:10:17,316 --> 00:10:18,977
We had some times together.

193
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:23,412
It's complete chaos over there.

194
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:25,319
They have any idea what went wrong?

195
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:26,550
None.

196
00:10:27,593 --> 00:10:29,390
Normal takeoff, perfect weather.

197
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:31,087
The thing just nose-dived, exploded.

198
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:32,687
That's not comforting.

199
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:36,331
Shel says they're going to
need to make a fresh start.

200
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:37,868
Did he say "fresh start"?

201
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,870
A few times.

202
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:44,574
That is an interesting phone call.

203
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:51,547
Yes.

204
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,050
Yes.

205
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:57,919
I can't talk right now.

206
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,522
Mr. Campbell, are you all right?

207
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:43,962
Mr. Campbell?

208
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:50,973
I'm sorry. Am I bothering you?

209
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:53,011
What's going on?

210
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,471
I just got off the phone with my brother.

211
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:01,111
It's the strangest thing.

212
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,814
Apparently, my father
was on that plane.

213
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:08,390
What?

214
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:12,858
My father, he was on the plane.

215
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:23,034
God, I'm sorry to hear that.

216
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:29,572
I don't know what to do.

217
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:35,551
I just saw him at the barber.

218
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:38,054
Paul Molé on Lex.

219
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,188
What does one do?

220
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:50,135
Make arrangements, I guess.

221
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:53,669
What am I supposed to do?

222
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,437
What people do.

223
00:12:57,543 --> 00:12:58,737
Go home.

224
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:04,705
I don't even think
I know how old he was.

225
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:06,478
Someone's going to ask that.

226
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,418
I don't know. I suppose.

227
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:11,785
You know what?

228
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:13,950
I don't think I'm going to tell anyone.

229
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:17,657
Am I going to cry?

230
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:21,792
You just had a shock.

231
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:23,732
I wouldn't...

232
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:26,930
worry about what you're feeling.

233
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:29,269
Go home and be with your family.

234
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,343
Why?

235
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:33,877
Because that's what people do.

236
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,571
Is that what you would do?

237
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:37,808
Yes.

238
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,417
Really?

239
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:44,751
Yes.

240
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,695
Everything's exactly the same.

241
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:57,065
You should go home.

242
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:05,368
What about the Stouffer's meeting?

243
00:14:05,477 --> 00:14:07,672
I'll cancel it.

244
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,145
It's not hurting anything.

245
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:16,483
There's life, and there's work.

246
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:30,231
Hey, I got one.

247
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:31,462
"Mohawk Airlines...

248
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:34,164
when you need to make it
past Jamaica Bay."

249
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:37,071
How about "American...
pioneering vertical flight"?

250
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:42,041
Mr. Draper, Mr. Cooper
would like to see you.

251
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,020
I spoke with Hank Lamont
over at Mohawk.

252
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:54,854
How are they doing over there?

253
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,655
He says they can weather it out.

254
00:14:56,762 --> 00:14:57,854
I always get the feeling

255
00:14:57,963 --> 00:15:00,022
that man opens his front door
and money comes in.

256
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:01,497
Always cleaned me out.

257
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,965
Best poker player in the South Pacific.

258
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:05,468
Duck, tell Don here
about your phone call.

259
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:08,665
Well, I put in a call to check in
with Shel Keneally

260
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:10,366
over at American Airlines.

261
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:12,535
He used to run International.
We're old pals.

262
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:14,044
He picked up the phone?

263
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:15,306
What's going on over there?

264
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:16,779
Shel says it's bedlam.

265
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:18,543
Anyway, he was
quite clear about the fact

266
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:20,209
that they're going
to want to make changes

267
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,310
if they want the dust to settle fast.

268
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,718
What does that mean?

269
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:27,883
It means they'll be looking
for a new image

270
00:15:27,993 --> 00:15:30,757
and thus a new agency.

271
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,594
What's it been, four, three hours

272
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:37,225
since the plane went down?

273
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:38,633
You'll have to forgive me

274
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:40,967
for not looking at a bunch
of bodies in Jamaica Bay

275
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:42,233
and seeing the opportunity.

276
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:43,968
Adding a few hours or a day or a week

277
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:45,407
doesn't make this any more
of an opportunity.

278
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:47,502
- We already have an airline.
- We don't have American.

279
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,274
That's right, we have
the one whose planes

280
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:51,178
didn't just fall out of the sky.

281
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:52,682
That's good.

282
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,275
I'm sorry. Is there an issue?

283
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:56,718
$1 million. $7 million.

284
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:57,880
Am I missing something?

285
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,514
Did you sign American
during this phone call?

286
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:00,990
No, but Shel made it very clear

287
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:04,028
that if we can get rid of our conflict,
he'd love to hear our ideas.

288
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,255
It's a serious foothold.

289
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:07,798
A foothold.
I'd do anything for a foothold.

290
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,765
This is how it works.

291
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:12,735
We got a regional airline
so we'd have a shot at a big one.

292
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:14,601
I know how you had it in your head.

293
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:16,732
The President of American Airlines
sees a Mohawk ad,

294
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:19,208
falls in love, and says
"Get me that guy."

295
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,939
I'm sorry it didn't play out that way.

296
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:23,674
Easy.

297
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,254
We have a good client who trusts us,
who likes our work,

298
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:35,054
who pays their bills on time.

299
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,991
They don't deserve
to be thrown out the door

300
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:38,723
for a wink from American.

301
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:41,026
I can't believe this.

302
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:44,699
Anything else?

303
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,870
He'll be fine.

304
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:04,815
I'll need to cancel
my reservations to Sarasota

305
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:07,892
and, of course, Andrew's return flight.

306
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:12,592
But l... Well, they can't possibly expect...

307
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:13,926
I'm sure that's taken care of.

308
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,591
Dunham's taking care of all that.

309
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,396
Bud's on the phone
with him right now.

310
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:19,630
I'm sure he'll forget something.

311
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:24,266
There's no way that he
can remember everything.

312
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,674
Bud's very good with things like this.

313
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:30,579
Is he aware there is no way
to have a funeral without the remains?

314
00:17:30,682 --> 00:17:32,047
What's the difference?

315
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,551
You're right.

316
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:38,646
There's just so much to do.

317
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:41,252
What is that?

318
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:43,955
What?

319
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,530
That.

320
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:47,496
That.

321
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:51,662
What is that?

322
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:54,700
Take it.

323
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:56,206
I want you to have it.

324
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:02,371
He was such a fine man,

325
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:05,075
so well-mannered, civic.

326
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:06,879
My father admired him.

327
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:08,885
What a nice thing to say.

328
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:13,080
I like to offer a nice
bouquet of thoughts.

329
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:24,930
Did you take care of everything?

330
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:26,664
They do this all the time.

331
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,866
- What?
- I took care of it.

332
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:34,037
Give me another one
of those, a big one.

333
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:37,477
Dunham had
some unpleasant news.

334
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:40,916
Dad was insolvent, broke.

335
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:42,884
Is there enough for a funeral?

336
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:46,515
As if the idea of a will
never crossed your mind?

337
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,217
We weren't going to get that.

338
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:49,726
You weren't.

339
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:52,757
What about her money?

340
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:56,258
The Dykeman Trust isn't
as solid as one would hope.

341
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:58,359
A lot of loans were taken
out by the president...

342
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,404
and recipient... Daddy.

343
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:03,031
Really? For what?

344
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:07,004
I asked Dunham
if there was a woman.

345
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:08,943
He said no.

346
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:11,447
It's all oysters, travel,
and club memberships.

347
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,179
Does she know?

348
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:17,084
You want to tell her? Go ahead.

349
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:24,456
Everything's been taken care of.

350
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:27,025
Boys.

351
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:34,735
Father called you salt and pepper.

352
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:39,971
That's beautiful, Dot.

353
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,512
Hi, Daddy.

354
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,558
I made you a ham sandwich.

355
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:54,819
What is this?

356
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:56,986
Carlton and Francine are
coming over for cards.

357
00:19:57,095 --> 00:20:00,326
Oh, Bets. Didn't we just do that?

358
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:06,096
We haven't done it
since before Christmas.

359
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,070
And they keep inviting us,
and we never go.

360
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:11,040
- Can I play cards?
- I want to play.

361
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:14,078
I'm going to lie down for a minute.

362
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:15,771
I have the chenille bedspread on.

363
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,781
Pull it back or they'll see
the marks on your face

364
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,044
and know you were sleeping.

365
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:23,121
You can say hello to everyone,
then it's off to bed.

366
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,162
Muddled. That means smash it.

367
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,464
He'll be nicer on the second one.

368
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,296
You did a wonderful job on mine.

369
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:38,460
Thank you.

370
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,902
Go take Mommy and Francine's orders.

371
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:44,031
Bobby, that is your last one.

372
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:46,235
All right. Come on, go.

373
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:47,937
Watch TV.

374
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:51,346
They're growing like weeds.

375
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,350
That's true.

376
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:55,977
We have the Caruthers girl
over to baby-sit already.

377
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,147
Can you believe that?

378
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,656
I don't think we know her.

379
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,350
You'd remember.

380
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,757
Goes to lmmaculate Heart.

381
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:05,796
I've been out
of high school a long time,

382
00:21:05,897 --> 00:21:08,127
but honestly, the way these girls dress,

383
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:09,825
and those uniforms.

384
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,568
Carlton.

385
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:15,503
What?

386
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,541
I'm enjoying this story so far,

387
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:20,134
but I have a feeling
it's not going to end well.

388
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:24,147
I think that Francine
brings her in to torture me.

389
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:27,514
I mean, everything I do
rubs her the wrong way.

390
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,484
I got rid of the apartment in the city.

391
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:32,182
I'm taking her to Nassau.

392
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,953
There was a pie
cooling in the windowsill,

393
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,392
and I'm not even
supposed to smell it?

394
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:40,054
It's Darkness at Noon.

395
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:42,065
- What do you want to hear?
- Now, come on.

396
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:43,998
Don't be like that.

397
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:46,570
Two Tom Collins.

398
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:49,106
Okay, you don't smash
the cherry on that.

399
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:50,640
Just plop it in at the end.

400
00:21:50,742 --> 00:21:52,835
Try to keep it in the top of the glass.

401
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:54,434
Gin.

402
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,066
Oh, good, you didn't wait.

403
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,667
We couldn't. It's late.

404
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:28,905
Work.

405
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,379
Your hair looks nice.

406
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:31,540
It does,

407
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:34,050
and she fought with Mr. Pierre
every minute of it.

408
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,813
He's got some funny ideas.

409
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:40,391
You want something to eat?

410
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:42,357
No, thank you. I already ate.

411
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:47,063
Connie Griffin was in her yard,

412
00:22:47,165 --> 00:22:48,462
hanging laundry in Bergen Beach.

413
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:50,432
She saw the whole thing.

414
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:51,968
Can you imagine?

415
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:54,561
WOR said there were
sharks eating the victims.

416
00:22:54,673 --> 00:22:56,664
That's worth reporting.

417
00:22:56,775 --> 00:22:58,208
You want toast?

418
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,800
Mama, I already ate.

419
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:02,072
You say you're coming to dinner,
and you already ate?

420
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:05,717
I came because I wanted to see you.

421
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:07,284
We never see you.

422
00:23:09,087 --> 00:23:12,318
I'm here. Right now.

423
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:14,755
Such a pretty face.

424
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:22,596
Gladys Rhine was asking for you at church.

425
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:24,760
Babe saw your brassiere ads
in the newspaper.

426
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:28,362
You should see poor Donny.
His skin is horrible.

427
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:30,065
Clearasil.

428
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:32,109
- He's beyond that.
- It's a shame.

429
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:33,734
He's a handsome boy.

430
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,974
Lots of people was
asking me about you.

431
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:42,644
Doesn't mean the same thing
to me that it means to you.

432
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:47,216
I think your father would like it
if you lit a candle for him.

433
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:55,432
I pray for you.

434
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:05,540
You know she lies and tells people
you're out of town on business.

435
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:08,306
She has some made-up church
in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania,

436
00:24:08,413 --> 00:24:10,108
where you go to mass with a friend of hers.

437
00:24:10,215 --> 00:24:12,410
No one asked her to lie.

438
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:15,213
She's not going to be here forever.

439
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:20,057
Would it kill you to go?

440
00:24:21,326 --> 00:24:22,987
I don't want to.

441
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:25,426
And I'm capable of making
my own decisions.

442
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:28,090
Really? State of New York
didn't think so.

443
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,997
The doctors didn't think so.

444
00:24:32,437 --> 00:24:34,132
Did you bring the vacuum?

445
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:35,536
Yes.

446
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:38,440
Did you empty the bag?

447
00:24:38,543 --> 00:24:39,908
Yes.

448
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:48,085
How do you let her get away
with making a bid of 150?

449
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:50,746
She usually overbids.
How was I supposed to know?

450
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:53,484
I do not overbid. I'm cautious.

451
00:24:53,592 --> 00:24:56,561
I hear it's going to be
a row of apartments

452
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,219
all up Cedar Lane.

453
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:00,594
No more cedars.

454
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:04,030
No parking around the school.

455
00:25:04,135 --> 00:25:07,400
You know, I could've had
that property for a song?

456
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:08,700
A song and a half, tops.

457
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:11,833
I thought he was crazy,
but there you go.

458
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:19,340
I'm sure we have
something else to talk about.

459
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:24,152
Did you hear about that jetliner?

460
00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:26,724
Terrible. It's terrible.

461
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:28,588
I was supposed to fly to Cleveland.

462
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:31,287
Now I can't. I have to take the train.

463
00:25:31,396 --> 00:25:33,626
Nine hours.

464
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:35,996
You have got to be kidding.

465
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:37,568
Sorry.

466
00:25:39,571 --> 00:25:42,665
I love the train. You do, too.

467
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:46,143
Bobby.

468
00:25:47,445 --> 00:25:48,605
Go back to bed.

469
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:52,483
I'm scared. I heard something.

470
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:54,984
Everything's great. Go back to bed.

471
00:25:57,923 --> 00:25:59,481
Bobby.

472
00:26:02,527 --> 00:26:03,721
Come on.

473
00:26:03,828 --> 00:26:05,022
Do what your mother says.

474
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:09,864
When I was a child,

475
00:26:09,968 --> 00:26:11,492
I would've been way more
afraid of my father

476
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:12,729
than of going to sleep.

477
00:26:12,837 --> 00:26:14,998
I hated going to sleep
when I was a kid.

478
00:26:15,106 --> 00:26:17,597
But I bet you did when you were told.

479
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:19,370
With a stack of comics and a flashlight.

480
00:26:19,477 --> 00:26:21,809
I don't care what they do
when they're up there.

481
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:24,006
I just like a few hours of quiet.

482
00:26:24,115 --> 00:26:26,049
Ernie tests my patience.

483
00:26:30,221 --> 00:26:31,916
Said he saw a ghost.

484
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:35,382
He was scared.

485
00:26:35,493 --> 00:26:37,427
He's a little liar.

486
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:40,358
He is?

487
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:44,561
He drew the most amazing picture
of George Washington the other day.

488
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:46,102
His teacher was so impressed,

489
00:26:46,204 --> 00:26:48,001
she put it up in the hallway.

490
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:50,006
It really looked like him.

491
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:51,871
Well, obviously.

492
00:26:51,977 --> 00:26:53,274
Because he brought it home,

493
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:55,744
and I noticed the exact same
image of Washington

494
00:26:55,847 --> 00:26:58,111
on the cover of one of his books.

495
00:26:58,216 --> 00:26:59,513
He had traced it.

496
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:00,983
What happened?

497
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:03,350
He brought a book to school
so he could trace it?

498
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:06,253
Well, I don't know.
Maybe they had it there.

499
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:08,019
I mean, the point is it was dishonest.

500
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:11,687
My whole art department
is run on tracing paper.

501
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:13,161
Why reinvent the wheel?

502
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:16,031
I've got the rest.

503
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:20,965
I don't care about tracing.

504
00:27:21,072 --> 00:27:22,869
What about all
that praise he accepted

505
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:25,238
for something he didn't do?

506
00:27:25,343 --> 00:27:27,903
Well, the book says they
start fibbing at this age.

507
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:30,743
They want to see if they
can make it come true.

508
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:33,147
I don't need a book
to know what little boys do.

509
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:41,025
You have anything you want me
to take back to the library?

510
00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:42,525
Anything you want me to pick up?

511
00:27:42,627 --> 00:27:47,257
No. I have to renew
The Agony and the Ecstasy.

512
00:27:47,365 --> 00:27:48,832
It's taking forever.

513
00:27:48,933 --> 00:27:51,128
I should go. I have to work tomorrow.

514
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:52,726
Busy bee.

515
00:27:54,906 --> 00:27:56,533
Aren't you going to say good night?

516
00:28:21,966 --> 00:28:23,365
Hi, Aunt Peggy.

517
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:38,181
Marilyn says Helen Bishop's
trying to stop them

518
00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:40,843
from putting parking meters
at Depot Plaza.

519
00:28:40,952 --> 00:28:43,978
Apparently, she got chummy
with some administrator at the high school.

520
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:45,488
Big, fat fellow.

521
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:49,090
Carlton's put on a few.

522
00:28:49,194 --> 00:28:51,662
I think it's nice he's filled out.

523
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:53,128
It shows he's happy.

524
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:55,662
I wouldn't say that.

525
00:28:57,502 --> 00:28:59,561
Why not?

526
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:01,332
Did he say something?
What did he say?

527
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:03,168
He didn't say anything.

528
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,171
Well, he should be happy.

529
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:08,643
Okay, maybe he is.

530
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:12,148
He should be happy and grateful
and showering Francine with love

531
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,547
after what he put her through.

532
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:16,586
Look, Bets, I'm not going to fight.

533
00:29:19,824 --> 00:29:21,689
I'll say whatever
you think I should say,

534
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:23,988
but I'm not going to fight with you.

535
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:18,779
What, sweetheart?

536
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:21,249
You laughed. What's funny?

537
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,709
I just...

538
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:28,752
I was just thinking that the last
conversation I had with him,

539
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:31,351
we were arguing about
whether Barney Kellogg

540
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:36,092
bred Boston terriers
or French bulldogs.

541
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:37,634
I'm sorry you were arguing.

542
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:42,035
Those ugly little pushed-in faces.

543
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,971
The labored breathing.

544
00:30:45,944 --> 00:30:47,969
He said they were French bulldogs.

545
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:50,707
I said they were Boston terriers.

546
00:30:50,815 --> 00:30:53,648
He was angry about it.

547
00:30:53,751 --> 00:30:57,551
Oh, Peter, neither of you
knew it was the last time.

548
00:30:59,657 --> 00:31:01,852
Fighting about facts, my mother calls it.

549
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,825
We do it all the time.

550
00:31:03,928 --> 00:31:07,694
Argue over something
that's actually one thing or another.

551
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,098
What do Barney's dogs look like?

552
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:13,431
Just beige.

553
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:17,770
Kind of like pugs, but with big ears.

554
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,173
Those are French bulldogs.

555
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:21,709
Really?

556
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:31,653
When I woke up, I felt fine for a minute.

557
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:36,224
Then I remembered.

558
00:31:37,862 --> 00:31:40,228
You should be thinking
about the good times.

559
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:43,427
Right.

560
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:47,028
So they go out a third time,

561
00:31:47,138 --> 00:31:49,572
and now the restaurant's
even worse... Indian food.

562
00:31:49,674 --> 00:31:51,437
But she really likes him.

563
00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:53,772
I told you he worked
for City Hall, for the Mayor.

564
00:31:53,878 --> 00:31:56,108
- So what happened?
- I need three copies.

565
00:31:56,214 --> 00:31:58,842
One goes to Mr. Robinson,
one to Mr. Fairbanks,

566
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:00,247
and one to Mr. Smith.

567
00:32:00,351 --> 00:32:01,477
The strange one.

568
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,076
That doesn't narrow it down.

569
00:32:03,187 --> 00:32:05,121
Thank you.

570
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:06,520
Mr. Kinsey.

571
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:08,319
Is something wrong?

572
00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:12,520
I'm avoiding you.

573
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:15,064
Or haven't you noticed that
after three days?

574
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:16,633
Are you worried
about the typewriter?

575
00:32:16,734 --> 00:32:18,133
I'm not going to tell anyone.

576
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:20,227
Although you were so brazen,

577
00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:22,101
you don't deserve clemency.

578
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:25,902
What did you say to Sheila?

579
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:28,205
- Who?
- Sheila.

580
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:29,610
My girlfriend.

581
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:31,443
Describe her to me.

582
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:33,073
Very funny.

583
00:32:33,184 --> 00:32:35,311
I know what's first on the list.

584
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:39,183
Oh, my God, I knew
you were a lot of things...

585
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,848
I'm not a phony.

586
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,221
You're so proud.

587
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:44,852
It's so obvious why you're seeing her.

588
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:47,227
A supermarket checkout girl?

589
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:49,596
Conversation must be stimulating.

590
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:50,998
Lettuce costs a nickel.

591
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:53,400
What a relief. You're just jealous.

592
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:55,472
Because you're the one who got away?

593
00:32:55,573 --> 00:32:59,634
You, out there in your
poor-little-rich-boy apartment

594
00:32:59,744 --> 00:33:02,008
in Newark or wherever.

595
00:33:02,113 --> 00:33:05,446
Walking around with your pipe
and your beard,

596
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:06,812
falling in love with that girl

597
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:09,284
just to show how interesting you are.

598
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:13,654
Go ahead. What part is wrong?

599
00:33:30,475 --> 00:33:32,306
Pete?

600
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:34,674
Duck. Come in.

601
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,542
Where's the girl?

602
00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:41,083
She's supposed to tell me
if she goes anywhere.

603
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:48,387
When my old man died,
I went on a hell of a bender.

604
00:33:50,228 --> 00:33:51,525
You heard about that.

605
00:33:51,629 --> 00:33:53,722
I had to read about it
in the Times.

606
00:33:53,831 --> 00:33:56,231
I wish you felt that you
could talk to me about it.

607
00:33:56,334 --> 00:33:58,859
You should be able to.
We're practically family here.

608
00:34:01,672 --> 00:34:03,799
I don't know, Duck.

609
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:06,341
There's not a lot to say.

610
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:08,344
No. Of course not.

611
00:34:11,582 --> 00:34:14,278
Your old man was in advertising, right?

612
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:15,545
Boston.

613
00:34:15,653 --> 00:34:18,349
Used to talk about the '20s
like we're idiots.

614
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:21,717
My father wasn't.

615
00:34:21,826 --> 00:34:23,191
Of course, it turns out

616
00:34:23,294 --> 00:34:25,023
I really didn't know
anything about him

617
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:27,461
except that he did not
like advertising.

618
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:30,830
Ah, that's his style.
I'm sure he was proud of you.

619
00:34:30,935 --> 00:34:33,130
Some people have trouble saying it.

620
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:37,239
Yes. That was a problem for him.

621
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:39,434
What's not to be proud of?

622
00:34:39,544 --> 00:34:41,273
You pay attention. You're hungry.

623
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:43,176
Most of the time you know
what you're doing.

624
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:44,475
I've noticed that.

625
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:48,610
I appreciate that.

626
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:54,554
Now, I don't want you to think
I'm being insensitive,

627
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:57,025
but we're going after American Airlines.

628
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:01,459
Well, it's...

629
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:03,329
I don't want to make you
feel uncomfortable.

630
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,368
Okay.

631
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:09,197
I'm meeting at the University Club
with Shel Keneally.

632
00:35:09,307 --> 00:35:11,832
Tonight, actually.
Get everything rolling.

633
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:14,309
If anything, I'd like you on board.

634
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:16,903
I want you leading
the way on this thing.

635
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:23,085
I think I am uncomfortable.

636
00:35:26,757 --> 00:35:28,190
I don't think I should do that.

637
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:30,522
It just happened.

638
00:35:36,434 --> 00:35:38,129
I haven't even cried yet.

639
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:41,299
Of course.

640
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:44,333
It was inappropriate.

641
00:35:52,016 --> 00:35:53,779
I'm sorry for your loss.

642
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:15,164
Can you come in here
with the papers I asked for?

643
00:36:21,879 --> 00:36:23,141
Sweetheart.

644
00:36:23,247 --> 00:36:25,078
You mind?

645
00:36:29,253 --> 00:36:30,743
I need you to set a meeting.

646
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,447
A quiet place, but public.

647
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:36,184
Have a heart-to-heart
with Henry Lamont.

648
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:37,318
Why would I do that?

649
00:36:37,428 --> 00:36:39,191
Because we're cutting him loose.

650
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:41,731
Duck's having a meeting
with Shel Keneally

651
00:36:41,832 --> 00:36:42,958
from American Airlines tonight.

652
00:36:43,067 --> 00:36:45,297
He's letting them know
that Mohawk is over.

653
00:36:45,403 --> 00:36:46,631
And that gets us a pitch?

654
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:50,032
It sends a signal that we're serious.

655
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:51,972
And that we're willing
to do whatever it takes.

656
00:36:52,076 --> 00:36:54,601
He has nothing.
And this is more of it.

657
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:56,043
- It's desperate.
- Come on.

658
00:36:56,147 --> 00:36:58,547
You should be salivating to
rip these guys away from DDB.

659
00:36:58,649 --> 00:37:00,947
And even if we don't
win this account,

660
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:03,213
we're going to be on a list
in the New York Times

661
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:04,618
of big boys pitching for this business.

662
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:06,451
We have an airline.

663
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,525
What kind of company
are we going to be?

664
00:37:09,927 --> 00:37:12,157
The kind where everyone
has a summer house?

665
00:37:14,532 --> 00:37:16,227
I can't believe I look like an idiot

666
00:37:16,334 --> 00:37:17,528
for wanting to be loyal
to these people.

667
00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:18,863
Take off your dress.

668
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:21,461
You get a chance
at American Airlines, you take it.

669
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:23,403
End of discussion.

670
00:37:42,493 --> 00:37:44,290
Hildy, can you get my wife on the phone?

671
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:45,692
Of course.

672
00:37:47,064 --> 00:37:48,622
Forget it.

673
00:38:06,917 --> 00:38:08,214
Mr. Campbell.

674
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:10,446
Don. Do you have a minute?

675
00:38:10,554 --> 00:38:12,920
What do you want, Campbell?

676
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,522
I just was... I don't know.

677
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:19,152
It's not a good time.

678
00:38:25,436 --> 00:38:27,700
If you want, you can
leave him a note.

679
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:29,534
People do that.

680
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,834
No.

681
00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:33,508
Thank you.

682
00:38:53,731 --> 00:38:55,062
Good night, Joan.

683
00:39:11,148 --> 00:39:12,979
Did you see who did this?

684
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:15,512
No.

685
00:39:16,754 --> 00:39:18,915
I never would have guessed
you were in your 30s.

686
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,957
People should not bring
their personal problems

687
00:39:21,058 --> 00:39:22,184
into the office.

688
00:39:23,327 --> 00:39:24,419
I agree.

689
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:26,621
Is it so hard to just leave
everything at the door

690
00:39:26,731 --> 00:39:27,755
and just do your job?

691
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:31,128
I look forward to it.

692
00:39:31,235 --> 00:39:33,430
They can't stand it.

693
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:36,267
They'll drag you into
the garbage out there.

694
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:39,866
They just want you to be
as miserable as they are.

695
00:39:39,977 --> 00:39:42,468
I say let them have it.

696
00:40:01,098 --> 00:40:03,123
Thanks.

697
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:05,293
How are you, Don?

698
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:07,565
Henry.

699
00:40:07,671 --> 00:40:08,899
Sit down.

700
00:40:09,006 --> 00:40:11,167
Can I get you anything?

701
00:40:11,275 --> 00:40:14,073
You know, I'm glad you picked this place.

702
00:40:14,178 --> 00:40:16,169
It reminds me of Pearl Harbor.

703
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,512
For many reasons.

704
00:40:23,154 --> 00:40:25,714
Do you think you're not
going to have to say it?

705
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:29,724
Sterling Cooper has decided

706
00:40:29,827 --> 00:40:32,227
to end its relationship
with Mohawk Airlines.

707
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:34,320
Sterling Cooper.

708
00:40:35,499 --> 00:40:36,989
I'm sorry.

709
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:38,830
It wasn't my decision.

710
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:41,662
You know, when we came in there,

711
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:43,933
they all said Sterling Cooper
is Don Draper.

712
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:45,508
That's what you get.

713
00:40:48,979 --> 00:40:51,675
That talk you gave me
about us growing together.

714
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:54,751
You said Sterling Cooper
didn't need a big airline.

715
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:57,912
You were going
to make us a big airline.

716
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:04,684
I wish things hadn't
worked out this way.

717
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:10,793
I'm almost embarrassed to say this.

718
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:14,431
You fooled me.

719
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:28,746
Stockholders weren't remotely impressed
with firing our head of ops.

720
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:34,257
So this agency change,
well, that's going to be a process.

721
00:41:35,526 --> 00:41:36,925
And to be part of that process?

722
00:41:37,027 --> 00:41:39,393
- Listen, we're here talking, right?
- Of course.

723
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,260
But it's hard for me
to leave here comfortable

724
00:41:41,365 --> 00:41:42,696
unless I know what
your objections are.

725
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,268
Well, we're a few steps
away from objections.

726
00:41:45,369 --> 00:41:47,064
We're just sticking a toe in the water.

727
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:49,901
Well, we're not. We jumped in.

728
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:54,974
Pete.

729
00:41:56,881 --> 00:41:58,178
It's good to see you.

730
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:02,685
Shel, this is Pete Campbell.

731
00:42:02,786 --> 00:42:04,014
I don't think he's our best.

732
00:42:04,121 --> 00:42:05,611
I think he's the best.

733
00:42:08,626 --> 00:42:09,923
Pleased to meet you.

734
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:11,289
You as well.

735
00:42:14,465 --> 00:42:16,956
I was just telling my buddy Shel here

736
00:42:17,067 --> 00:42:19,092
how we've really cleared
the way to be in this.

737
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:25,339
I was telling Duck here
we don't know where we are yet.

738
00:42:27,978 --> 00:42:29,206
I don't think you're aware

739
00:42:29,313 --> 00:42:31,213
of the level of commitment
and enthusiasm

740
00:42:31,315 --> 00:42:32,612
for this project at Sterling Cooper.

741
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:33,842
It's true.

742
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:35,316
We've got writers bucking the gate.

743
00:42:35,419 --> 00:42:37,387
I've already got a stack
of ideas on my desk

744
00:42:37,488 --> 00:42:38,853
that I think you'd love to see.

745
00:42:44,662 --> 00:42:46,186
We understand how delicate

746
00:42:46,297 --> 00:42:49,095
the process of rebuilding
the public's confidence will be.

747
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:51,861
Not just the public. Our stockholders.

748
00:42:53,337 --> 00:42:55,202
Well, I want you to know that,

749
00:42:55,306 --> 00:42:57,365
should you decide
to bring us your business,

750
00:42:57,474 --> 00:42:59,339
there will be someone
on your account

751
00:42:59,443 --> 00:43:01,172
who knows exactly
what you're going through.

752
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,746
My father was on that plane.

753
00:43:12,723 --> 00:43:13,917
My goodness.

754
00:43:16,493 --> 00:43:17,619
Sorry to hear that.

755
00:43:17,728 --> 00:43:19,923
Yes. Well...

756
00:43:21,031 --> 00:43:22,999
it's a horrible thing.

757
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,728
Hopefully, something good
will come of it.

758
00:43:26,904 --> 00:43:28,997
That is something I will pass on.

759
00:43:34,144 --> 00:43:35,668
Shall we grab a bite?

760
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:37,041
I put our name in.

761
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:23,656
I'm not your waitress,
but are you all set here?

762
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:29,223
Excuse me?

763
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:31,927
You've been sitting alone a long time.

764
00:44:32,036 --> 00:44:33,560
Can I get you a menu?

765
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:37,735
I don't think so.

766
00:44:39,209 --> 00:44:40,506
I have to drop this off,

767
00:44:40,611 --> 00:44:44,342
but I can swing back
around on my way out.

768
00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:50,143
Not tonight.

769
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:38,785
Would you hold him for me?

770
00:46:38,896 --> 00:46:40,591
Thanks.
