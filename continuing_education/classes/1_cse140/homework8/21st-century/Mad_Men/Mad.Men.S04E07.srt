2
00:01:08,414 --> 00:01:11,403
...Five, six, seven,
eight, nine, 10, 11.

3
00:01:11,433 --> 00:01:13,289
- That's two for the Campbells...
- Where are these exactly?

4
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:15,386
It's a movie theater,
no bad seats...

5
00:01:15,416 --> 00:01:16,616
the Cosgroves,

6
00:01:16,976 --> 00:01:19,454
and Joey, Stan, Danny... $10 each.

7
00:01:19,484 --> 00:01:22,553
How come we have to pay when everyone
knows damn well they were free?

8
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:23,955
You're such a Jew.

9
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,734
Your friends in Hollywood
know you talk that way?

10
00:01:26,764 --> 00:01:28,620
And let me tell you-
you're the Jew,

11
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:31,542
trying to make 30 bucks on
something you got for free.

12
00:01:31,871 --> 00:01:33,746
25 on Clay by a knockout.

13
00:01:34,048 --> 00:01:35,435
Liston is favored for a reason.

14
00:01:35,465 --> 00:01:38,052
- Cassius Clay is scared.
- Of what, pray tell?

15
00:01:38,488 --> 00:01:40,517
He had an elevated heart
rate before the last fight.

16
00:01:41,124 --> 00:01:42,633
Who says that means you're scared?

17
00:01:42,663 --> 00:01:44,813
It happens to me all the time.
It runs in my family.

18
00:01:45,103 --> 00:01:47,489
Liston has the weight.
And he's never been knocked out.

19
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:48,619
Sonny's old.

20
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:49,899
He's experienced.

21
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:52,043
Don, I've got your ticket.

22
00:01:52,746 --> 00:01:53,946
You want to put something down?

23
00:01:53,976 --> 00:01:55,661
Stan's got a barber who makes book.

24
00:01:55,691 --> 00:01:56,692
Yeah, who do you like?

25
00:01:56,722 --> 00:01:59,161
I was just saying I think Clay'd make
one hell of an adman.

26
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:01,902
You're right. Gimme 100 on Liston.

27
00:02:03,953 --> 00:02:06,731
Joining us for a little pre-fight
steak and cocktails at the palm?

28
00:02:06,761 --> 00:02:09,974
Absolutely. Samsonite team,
in my office.

29
00:02:12,223 --> 00:02:13,811
Listen, if it comes
up with Jennifer,

30
00:02:13,841 --> 00:02:15,385
I did pay for the seats.

31
00:02:16,203 --> 00:02:18,436
Can you make a dinner
reservation before the bout

32
00:02:18,466 --> 00:02:21,007
for Mr. Sterling and me
anywhere but the palm?

33
00:02:21,037 --> 00:02:23,513
I don't know why everyone
cares so much about it.

34
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:25,356
If I wanted to see
two negroes fight,

35
00:02:25,386 --> 00:02:27,200
I'd throw a dollar
bill out my window.

36
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,965
I thought we were doing
this at 9:00. It's 11:15.

37
00:02:30,179 --> 00:02:32,593
I'm late, but you're not.
Good work so far.

38
00:02:33,242 --> 00:02:35,960
- Where do you want me?
- Behind the desk is fine.

39
00:02:44,617 --> 00:02:47,583
You're in a white studio,
like in some limbo.

40
00:02:48,064 --> 00:02:50,569
There's two no-name
football players holding

41
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:53,170
an American tourister and a skyway

42
00:02:53,233 --> 00:02:58,233
going against Mr. Joe Namath
and his defender, a sexy girl

43
00:02:58,825 --> 00:03:01,458
holding a samsonite,
and maybe a referee.

44
00:03:01,758 --> 00:03:04,602
So we hear "hut hut,
hike!" Namath fades back.

45
00:03:04,632 --> 00:03:06,061
"Oh no, it's a blitz!"...

46
00:03:09,379 --> 00:03:11,879
punch in on Namath,
he says something like...

47
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,098
"The secret to victory
on the road is samsonite.

48
00:03:14,128 --> 00:03:15,624
I carry it because it's tough

49
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:18,546
and no matter what comes at me,
I know I'm protected."

50
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,002
As they fall,

51
00:03:22,032 --> 00:03:24,291
the competitors will bust open,
clothing flying out.

52
00:03:24,321 --> 00:03:25,735
Touchdown, samsonite!

53
00:03:25,779 --> 00:03:28,279
- "I've got it, honey."
- "You sure do, Joe."

54
00:03:28,862 --> 00:03:30,713
"Samsonite... it's tough."

55
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,577
Endorsements are lazy,

56
00:03:37,838 --> 00:03:39,038
and I don't like Joe Namath.

57
00:03:39,068 --> 00:03:41,272
He hasn't even played in
a professional game yet.

58
00:03:41,302 --> 00:03:42,629
He's very handsome.

59
00:03:42,968 --> 00:03:44,610
And women don't buy suitcases.

60
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,097
Dr. faye says they do.

61
00:03:47,202 --> 00:03:48,876
Could you leave us, please?

62
00:03:59,085 --> 00:04:01,204
Peggy, I'm glad that this is an environment

63
00:04:01,234 --> 00:04:03,134
where you feel free to fail.

64
00:04:03,696 --> 00:04:05,245
You wanted to go with Danny's idea.

65
00:04:05,491 --> 00:04:06,659
Because it works...

66
00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:08,320
"only samsonite is tough."

67
00:04:08,425 --> 00:04:10,041
It's the execution
that's the problem.

68
00:04:10,282 --> 00:04:13,301
- Okay, should it be funny?
- Actually funny?

69
00:04:13,331 --> 00:04:15,596
Maybe. Funny like
what I just saw? No.

70
00:04:36,116 --> 00:04:38,651
- Hello.
- You remembered my birthday.

71
00:04:39,537 --> 00:04:41,237
Did you open my present?

72
00:04:41,575 --> 00:04:43,408
I am. Hold on.

73
00:04:51,566 --> 00:04:52,860
My goodness.

74
00:04:53,255 --> 00:04:55,973
I'm finally doing what I
should've done years ago.

75
00:04:56,146 --> 00:04:58,168
Phillips-Olson- something probably,

76
00:04:58,401 --> 00:05:00,602
but I'll need you.
I want to form an agency

77
00:05:00,632 --> 00:05:03,021
that specializes in
women's products with you

78
00:05:03,051 --> 00:05:04,387
as my creative director.

79
00:05:04,903 --> 00:05:06,490
I don't know what to say.

80
00:05:06,612 --> 00:05:08,243
But you're smiling, right?

81
00:05:08,539 --> 00:05:11,404
I have some very-
sort of a little under the table,

82
00:05:11,656 --> 00:05:14,356
but very high-level talks
with the people at tampax.

83
00:05:14,386 --> 00:05:17,605
Peggy, it's tampax-
50% market share.

84
00:05:18,031 --> 00:05:19,715
I mean they're really up there.

85
00:05:19,745 --> 00:05:22,040
Plus that queer at belle jolie
has been barking up my tree.

86
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:24,179
Plus I have my
European connections.

87
00:05:24,256 --> 00:05:25,583
It sounds exciting.

88
00:05:25,613 --> 00:05:26,934
The train's leaving
the station, honey.

89
00:05:26,964 --> 00:05:27,986
Get onboard.

90
00:05:32,361 --> 00:05:33,861
Where am I calling you?

91
00:05:34,461 --> 00:05:36,048
I'm in my office at home.

92
00:05:36,816 --> 00:05:38,586
So you already told grey?

93
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,246
I'm not wasting my talents
over there anymore.

94
00:05:41,276 --> 00:05:42,884
Believe me, it was mutual.

95
00:05:43,506 --> 00:05:45,224
Duck, did you lose your job?

96
00:05:46,509 --> 00:05:48,097
Peggy, this is good.

97
00:05:48,127 --> 00:05:49,411
I'm not gonna lie.

98
00:05:49,441 --> 00:05:51,855
I was a little inspired
by what Draper did.

99
00:05:52,034 --> 00:05:53,839
Now I just need some accounts.

100
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,314
It's tough because, well...

101
00:05:57,513 --> 00:05:59,192
it's tough to get a credit line.

102
00:06:00,182 --> 00:06:01,778
So what do you have so far?

103
00:06:01,825 --> 00:06:03,199
I know it's not a diamond necklace,

104
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:04,948
but I did spend some
money on those cards.

105
00:06:05,219 --> 00:06:07,432
And I appreciate the gesture.

106
00:06:08,302 --> 00:06:09,526
It's just...

107
00:06:10,589 --> 00:06:12,322
I don't know whether
to take this seriously,

108
00:06:12,352 --> 00:06:15,132
because I suspect
you've been drinking.

109
00:06:15,817 --> 00:06:17,144
Well, you're wrong.

110
00:06:17,793 --> 00:06:19,337
I heard about the Clios.

111
00:06:19,637 --> 00:06:20,881
I have to see you tonight.

112
00:06:21,782 --> 00:06:22,848
I have plans.

113
00:06:23,306 --> 00:06:25,260
What, with that Mark?
He's another one.

114
00:06:25,591 --> 00:06:27,744
Duck, you are a
valuable account man.

115
00:06:28,093 --> 00:06:29,618
You have a bright future.

116
00:06:29,648 --> 00:06:31,761
You just need to go to one
of those headhunters and...

117
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:34,809
- I need to see you, babe.
- Don't do that.

118
00:06:35,961 --> 00:06:38,317
Peg, I'm falling apart.

119
00:06:39,423 --> 00:06:40,653
Don't you know
you're the last thing

120
00:06:40,683 --> 00:06:42,444
that made me feel
good about myself?

121
00:06:43,964 --> 00:06:46,073
Pull your hands out
of your panties.

122
00:06:47,049 --> 00:06:48,978
I can't talk right now....

123
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:52,249
I want to see you tonight.

124
00:06:55,025 --> 00:06:56,743
You been farting in here?...

125
00:06:58,772 --> 00:06:59,838
I have to go.

126
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:09,717
We're going to lunch.

127
00:07:09,826 --> 00:07:12,368
I don't know if you could tell,
but he hated it.

128
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:14,341
I was hating it too
while we were doing it,

129
00:07:14,371 --> 00:07:16,359
but not before. I'm not gonna lie.

130
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:20,465
So we're back to the drawing board.
Still gotta eat.

131
00:07:20,495 --> 00:07:22,003
Come on, it's your birthday.

132
00:07:22,033 --> 00:07:23,968
We'll let you talk through lunch.

133
00:07:26,542 --> 00:07:29,763
You got a call while you were in
the toilet to the direct line...

134
00:07:29,793 --> 00:07:33,168
Stephanie from California, no last
name. She says it's urgent.

135
00:07:34,732 --> 00:07:38,531
- Would you like me to place the call?
- No, I've got it.

136
00:08:11,051 --> 00:08:13,345
Bad news. Our night is ruined.

137
00:08:14,365 --> 00:08:15,735
I took care of that.

138
00:08:16,306 --> 00:08:18,154
The kids are going to the palm.

139
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:20,769
We are going anywhere else.

140
00:08:20,799 --> 00:08:23,188
Well, the brotherhood of
alcoholics anonymous...

141
00:08:23,218 --> 00:08:24,722
Freddy and Cal
Rutledge from Pond's...

142
00:08:24,752 --> 00:08:27,304
will be joining us for
dinner and the fight,

143
00:08:27,731 --> 00:08:30,534
which means we'll have to drink before
dinner if we want to drink at all.

144
00:08:30,564 --> 00:08:32,058
And then there's all
the talk about drinking

145
00:08:32,088 --> 00:08:33,319
where they start with
the funny stories

146
00:08:33,349 --> 00:08:34,849
and they end up crying.

147
00:08:36,675 --> 00:08:37,675
Again.

148
00:08:38,532 --> 00:08:40,530
15 months I've been
waiting for this fight.

149
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,395
$300. Liston has to
lose by unconsciousness.

150
00:08:45,436 --> 00:08:47,367
- Get rid of 'em.
- I can't.

151
00:08:49,077 --> 00:08:51,870
- I should work on samsonite.
- That's in two weeks.

152
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,378
I'm gonna be in Florida.
Now this is your job too.

153
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:57,726
- Let's go.
- I'm sorry. You can do that without me.

154
00:08:57,756 --> 00:09:00,199
- Samsonite you can't.
- Are you serious?

155
00:09:00,438 --> 00:09:02,083
We can solve this
problem with a flask.

156
00:09:03,721 --> 00:09:05,342
No, I wouldn't be
good company anyway.

157
00:09:05,372 --> 00:09:07,264
That's never bothered me before.

158
00:09:43,787 --> 00:09:46,571
I don't know what it is, but I look
at the side of your neck

159
00:09:46,601 --> 00:09:49,077
and I wish I had one of
those James Bond pens

160
00:09:49,107 --> 00:09:50,825
so I could jam a dart in it.

161
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:55,580
James Bond likes to travel.
He goes all over the world.

162
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:58,392
He goes underwater.
He met a girl underwater.

163
00:10:01,359 --> 00:10:03,512
I think this is a
good place to stop.

164
00:10:04,234 --> 00:10:05,474
See you tomorrow.

165
00:10:09,223 --> 00:10:10,223
Oh, great.

166
00:10:11,452 --> 00:10:12,652
I don't like sitting at my desk

167
00:10:12,682 --> 00:10:14,364
and looking into a garbage dump.

168
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:17,408
Although I am paid less,
I am still not a janitor.

169
00:10:24,473 --> 00:10:25,887
Thank you, gentlemen.

170
00:10:28,827 --> 00:10:30,601
Doing something special
for your birthday?

171
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:32,006
Mark is taking me to dinner...

172
00:10:32,684 --> 00:10:34,576
the forum of the twelve caesars.

173
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:36,257
- Ooh.
- Yes.

174
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:40,061
- How old are you?
- 26 today.

175
00:10:41,387 --> 00:10:43,434
Well, you're doing all right,
aren't you?

176
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:49,264
Well, hello.

177
00:10:49,751 --> 00:10:52,078
- Did I hear it's your birthday?
- It is.

178
00:10:53,901 --> 00:10:57,244
- How are you feeling?
- Well, of course my days are

179
00:10:57,274 --> 00:10:59,774
spent sleeping and
visiting the ladies' room,

180
00:10:59,858 --> 00:11:01,962
although it's an incredible feeling

181
00:11:01,992 --> 00:11:03,579
having this baby kick me.

182
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:06,780
Is it any different
than living with Pete?

183
00:11:07,805 --> 00:11:08,871
You're witty.

184
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:12,422
I always assumed that,
but it turns out it's true.

185
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:15,624
Are you going to watch the fight?

186
00:11:15,654 --> 00:11:18,427
Oh, yes. I've been watching boxing

187
00:11:18,457 --> 00:11:20,088
since I was a little girl.

188
00:11:20,812 --> 00:11:22,585
My father loves blood sport.

189
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:26,151
Mr. Draper's looking for you.

190
00:11:27,358 --> 00:11:28,902
I'm sorry. I have to go.

191
00:11:32,037 --> 00:11:33,190
Happy Birthday.

192
00:11:33,673 --> 00:11:36,604
You know, 26 is still very young.

193
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,078
Have fun.

194
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:49,077
I want a rare steak
and I want to see

195
00:11:49,107 --> 00:11:50,955
those two men pound each other.

196
00:11:51,531 --> 00:11:53,447
Cynthia's at the restaurant.
We should go.

197
00:11:53,477 --> 00:11:55,015
What about Jennifer?

198
00:11:55,311 --> 00:11:57,300
Oh, don't go in there. Don't do it.

199
00:11:59,681 --> 00:12:02,325
- She's dead.
- Let's beat it before it's us.

200
00:12:04,686 --> 00:12:07,632
- I was just on my way out.
- Did you get California?

201
00:12:08,067 --> 00:12:10,263
Do you want me to
try before I depart?

202
00:12:10,553 --> 00:12:12,113
There's a time difference,
you know.

203
00:12:12,143 --> 00:12:14,478
I do, but it goes the other way.

204
00:12:15,618 --> 00:12:17,118
Good night, Mr. Draper.

205
00:12:18,733 --> 00:12:19,755
Get in here.

206
00:12:20,987 --> 00:12:22,950
Why don't you talk to
Joan and get rid of her?

207
00:12:23,146 --> 00:12:25,313
No, Joan knew exactly what I needed

208
00:12:25,343 --> 00:12:27,061
and made sure that I got it.

209
00:12:27,966 --> 00:12:29,707
So where are we on samsonite?

210
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,082
We'll have something to
show you in the morning.

211
00:12:32,112 --> 00:12:33,836
But the suspense is killing me.

212
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:36,609
Well, I kind of was on my way out.

213
00:12:37,265 --> 00:12:39,026
Let me just see where we are.

214
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:42,401
I guess I've got a minute.

215
00:13:06,109 --> 00:13:08,783
Okay. We thought that samsonite is

216
00:13:08,813 --> 00:13:12,036
this very rare element,
this mythical substance,

217
00:13:12,066 --> 00:13:13,955
the hardest on earth-
and we see an adventurer

218
00:13:13,985 --> 00:13:15,485
leaping through a cave.

219
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,410
Is this a substance
much like bullshit?

220
00:13:19,705 --> 00:13:21,403
I thought we could drop
one off the eiffel tower

221
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:23,629
with a countdown-
like the moonshot...

222
00:13:23,815 --> 00:13:25,558
and show how it doesn't break.

223
00:13:25,588 --> 00:13:28,394
- But it would, wouldn't it?
- Probably.

224
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:31,206
The government has prohibited us

225
00:13:31,236 --> 00:13:32,270
from doing things like that, Peggy.

226
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,689
They feel that it is not
in the public interest.

227
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,942
We have a thing with samson,

228
00:13:38,237 --> 00:13:40,847
because he's strong... and his hair.

229
00:13:41,615 --> 00:13:42,974
I gave you more responsibility

230
00:13:43,004 --> 00:13:44,992
and you didn't do anything?

231
00:13:45,281 --> 00:13:47,858
That you like.
We did work... a lot.

232
00:13:47,888 --> 00:13:49,051
I don't care if you work 10 seconds

233
00:13:49,081 --> 00:13:51,016
if you bring me something I like.

234
00:13:51,252 --> 00:13:53,187
We're going to do this right now.

235
00:13:55,806 --> 00:13:57,437
Oh, I know you have plans.

236
00:13:58,292 --> 00:14:00,301
You were going to call me
from a bar with an idea?

237
00:14:00,331 --> 00:14:02,180
Do you think elves do this?

238
00:14:03,244 --> 00:14:05,029
You're just gonna change it anyway.

239
00:14:05,059 --> 00:14:06,059
Excuse me?!

240
00:14:19,663 --> 00:14:21,903
- This is Mark Kerney.
- I am so sorry.

241
00:14:22,247 --> 00:14:24,878
I got drawn into his web.
It's gonna be a while.

242
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:27,992
A while like soon,
or a while like I should cancel?

243
00:14:28,411 --> 00:14:30,265
15 minutes? It shouldn't
take too long.

244
00:14:30,295 --> 00:14:33,214
- He's going to the boxing match.
- He's going to Maine?

245
00:14:33,244 --> 00:14:34,413
You can watch it on
closed-circuit TV

246
00:14:34,443 --> 00:14:36,639
in the movie theaters.
We got tickets.

247
00:14:36,712 --> 00:14:38,169
How come we didn't go?

248
00:14:38,309 --> 00:14:41,274
Because we're having a romantic
dinner for my birthday.

249
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,588
Well, did you tell him that?

250
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,931
Look, I'm the only one who
can help him with this

251
00:14:45,961 --> 00:14:48,281
and the sooner I get off the phone,
the sooner I can come.

252
00:14:48,311 --> 00:14:49,725
Just hurry, will you?

253
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,779
She's gonna be a few minutes late.

254
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:55,822
A surprise on top of a surprise.

255
00:14:56,435 --> 00:14:57,849
She works too hard.

256
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,003
"The oysters of Hercules,

257
00:15:00,033 --> 00:15:02,012
which you with sword shall carve."

258
00:15:02,049 --> 00:15:04,767
I saw a tray pass by.
They look like hockey pucks.

259
00:15:05,221 --> 00:15:09,126
$1.65. You should
let Gerry get this.

260
00:15:09,382 --> 00:15:11,665
Mom, don't cut the
kid off at the knees.

261
00:15:18,194 --> 00:15:20,796
Now what if an
elephant either sits on

262
00:15:20,864 --> 00:15:22,451
or steps on the suitcase?

263
00:15:27,237 --> 00:15:29,839
How about a slow-moving
airplane runs it over?

264
00:15:30,071 --> 00:15:31,658
Do you like Cassius Clay?

265
00:15:33,143 --> 00:15:35,745
- He's very handsome.
- I don't think so.

266
00:15:35,812 --> 00:15:37,312
You're not supposed to.

267
00:15:37,347 --> 00:15:40,516
I remember my mother talking
about nat king Cole in a way

268
00:15:40,584 --> 00:15:42,608
that made my father throw
out all his records.

269
00:15:44,788 --> 00:15:46,202
He's got a big mouth.

270
00:15:47,369 --> 00:15:50,357
"I'm the greatest."
" Not if you have to say it."

271
00:15:52,183 --> 00:15:53,627
Muhammad Ali.

272
00:15:53,764 --> 00:15:56,132
Do you like the airplane?

273
00:15:56,199 --> 00:15:58,308
Liston just goes
about his business,

274
00:15:59,836 --> 00:16:01,337
works methodically.

275
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,540
Clay will dance and talk,

276
00:16:04,608 --> 00:16:06,543
throw a few until he's wiped out.

277
00:16:08,712 --> 00:16:09,939
A bag under an airplane looks like

278
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,303
there's been an accident.

279
00:16:13,016 --> 00:16:14,757
Three classes of suitcase...

280
00:16:15,692 --> 00:16:18,463
featherweight, middleweight,
heavyweight...

281
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:21,005
for whatever class you're in.

282
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,462
But how do you do that on TV?

283
00:16:24,137 --> 00:16:26,508
- What's the story?
- You don't like it?

284
00:16:27,168 --> 00:16:30,533
No, I love it. That's great.
That's what we should do.

285
00:16:36,973 --> 00:16:38,107
Let it ring.

286
00:16:40,677 --> 00:16:42,168
I'll say you're not here.

287
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:44,380
Hello? Oh hello, Roger.

288
00:16:44,448 --> 00:16:46,248
No, he's not here.

289
00:16:46,933 --> 00:16:49,390
I answer other people's
phones all the time.

290
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,527
I'm going to count to three,
then I'm gonna start saying

291
00:16:51,557 --> 00:16:53,346
a lot of words you don't like,
sweetheart.

292
00:16:54,459 --> 00:16:56,873
- This should be good.
- I'm begging you...

293
00:16:56,994 --> 00:16:58,581
Get down here right away.

294
00:16:58,702 --> 00:17:00,333
You think I'd rather be working?

295
00:17:00,363 --> 00:17:01,627
Yeah, I do. Did you know

296
00:17:01,657 --> 00:17:03,898
Freddy Rumsen collects
Indian arrowheads?

297
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,640
Where are you?

298
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:08,571
There's a bar next to Keenes.

299
00:17:08,638 --> 00:17:10,446
I've been sneaking off
to fortify myself.

300
00:17:10,507 --> 00:17:12,575
Tell 'em you're sick. Go home.

301
00:17:12,642 --> 00:17:14,555
I am sick. I think I overdid it.

302
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:17,090
And they're self-so-righteous.

303
00:17:17,493 --> 00:17:19,037
I never pissed my pants.

304
00:17:19,158 --> 00:17:21,789
This guy Rutledge killed
a man with a motorboat.

305
00:17:22,257 --> 00:17:24,160
You know what gets you
over something like that?

306
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:25,250
Drinking.

307
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:27,546
Still got your ticket.

308
00:17:27,858 --> 00:17:29,687
It's an attractive offer.

309
00:17:30,026 --> 00:17:32,179
Look out your window.
Can you see me?

310
00:17:34,507 --> 00:17:36,007
Good night, sweetheart.

311
00:17:39,736 --> 00:17:41,604
Go ahead. I'll wait.

312
00:17:48,879 --> 00:17:51,921
- Hello.
- 15 minutes? It's almost an hour.

313
00:17:52,314 --> 00:17:54,641
I'm so sorry.
I'm gonna leave any minute.

314
00:17:55,265 --> 00:17:56,681
Did you at least have something?

315
00:17:56,711 --> 00:17:58,270
You have to get down here.

316
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,453
You have to get down
here right away.

317
00:18:01,892 --> 00:18:03,759
I can't just leave, okay?

318
00:18:03,827 --> 00:18:06,162
But you have to, okay?

319
00:18:06,192 --> 00:18:08,235
You know what? Just go to my
apartment and wait for me.

320
00:18:08,265 --> 00:18:09,519
We can eat there another time.

321
00:18:09,549 --> 00:18:11,695
No, I don't want to do that.

322
00:18:12,402 --> 00:18:14,329
I'll make it worth your while.

323
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:16,016
Damn it, Peggy. I've got your
whole family here

324
00:18:16,049 --> 00:18:17,865
for a surprise dinner, okay?

325
00:18:17,895 --> 00:18:20,721
And the only way you can make it
worse is by not coming at all.

326
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,243
Oh, Mark.

327
00:18:24,054 --> 00:18:26,929
I'm so sorry. I'm coming right now.

328
00:18:27,466 --> 00:18:28,466
Thank you.

329
00:18:32,374 --> 00:18:34,278
Well, so much for the surprise.

330
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:42,068
Okay, I'm going to leave if
that's all right with you.

331
00:18:42,098 --> 00:18:44,033
I'm not so sure about it.

332
00:18:44,536 --> 00:18:46,038
I mean every time we get into this,

333
00:18:46,068 --> 00:18:47,837
we abandon the toughness idea.

334
00:18:47,867 --> 00:18:50,150
Maybe there's something
to the elephant.

335
00:18:52,932 --> 00:18:54,128
Do you want one?

336
00:18:57,541 --> 00:19:00,048
I'm sorry. Do you
have someplace to be?

337
00:19:01,735 --> 00:19:03,976
Maybe tap your foot
so I get the message.

338
00:19:04,285 --> 00:19:06,159
I was supposed to be
at dinner an hour ago.

339
00:19:06,189 --> 00:19:08,147
It's my birthday,
and I'm pretty sure

340
00:19:08,177 --> 00:19:09,398
I ruined everything.

341
00:19:09,638 --> 00:19:11,598
- Why the hell didn't you tell me?
- I don't know.

342
00:19:11,628 --> 00:19:13,152
Because I thought this
would take a second.

343
00:19:13,196 --> 00:19:14,868
So now I'm supposed
to feel like crap?

344
00:19:14,898 --> 00:19:17,433
Oh, I'm so sick that I
ruined her birthday.

345
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:20,291
Do you know when my birthday is?

346
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:23,091
- I was your secretary!
- Well, enjoy your evening!

347
00:19:23,803 --> 00:19:26,634
By the way, you are
20-something years old.

348
00:19:26,751 --> 00:19:28,167
It's time to get over birthdays.

349
00:19:30,066 --> 00:19:32,058
Go ahead. I'll do it myself.

350
00:19:51,434 --> 00:19:52,980
Yes, I'm that important.

351
00:19:54,638 --> 00:19:56,224
So the fact that
you're calling means

352
00:19:56,254 --> 00:19:57,885
that you haven't left yet.

353
00:19:57,955 --> 00:20:00,238
I'm not gonna be able
to make it at all.

354
00:20:00,515 --> 00:20:02,537
- Are you kidding me?
- I'm sorry,

355
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:04,536
but no one asked you to do this.

356
00:20:04,832 --> 00:20:06,811
You said you never had a surprise.

357
00:20:07,454 --> 00:20:08,824
I can't believe you.

358
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,552
This is your mother speaking.

359
00:20:12,091 --> 00:20:13,091
Hello, ma.

360
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:15,024
I just want you to know
that we're all here...

361
00:20:15,054 --> 00:20:16,989
Me, Anita, Gerry, the roommate...

362
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:19,532
and we're not leaving
until you march in here.

363
00:20:19,562 --> 00:20:22,450
I can't, okay? Could you
put Mark on the phone?

364
00:20:22,949 --> 00:20:24,214
He's crestfallen, you know?

365
00:20:24,244 --> 00:20:27,019
- Mrs. Olson, it's okay.
- It's not okay.

366
00:20:28,044 --> 00:20:29,876
Now he's making excuses for you.

367
00:20:29,906 --> 00:20:31,726
I don't know how many nice boys

368
00:20:31,756 --> 00:20:33,648
you think are lining up for you.

369
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:36,579
You should be grateful.
Okay, goodbye.

370
00:20:39,282 --> 00:20:41,450
- Hello?
- I'm sorry I ruined this

371
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,537
and I'm sorry you had
to spend the evening

372
00:20:42,567 --> 00:20:43,701
with my mother.

373
00:20:43,884 --> 00:20:45,558
You know what? She's right.

374
00:20:45,947 --> 00:20:47,966
Really? Then why
don't you date her?

375
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:49,670
She's never even had a job.

376
00:20:49,821 --> 00:20:51,669
How the hell are you mad at me?

377
00:20:51,705 --> 00:20:53,464
Because you used my
birthday to get in good

378
00:20:53,494 --> 00:20:55,713
with a bunch of people
who drive me crazy.

379
00:20:55,926 --> 00:20:58,644
Should I have invited don?
You never stand him up.

380
00:20:59,343 --> 00:21:01,951
What's the point of doing
anything nice for you?

381
00:21:01,981 --> 00:21:03,912
Jesus. You even sound
like my mother.

382
00:21:03,942 --> 00:21:05,644
I'm already into
this place for $40.

383
00:21:05,674 --> 00:21:07,858
If you don't mind,
I'm going to enjoy my dinner

384
00:21:07,888 --> 00:21:09,705
and you enjoy your work.

385
00:21:10,246 --> 00:21:12,399
The fact that you
would stay there...

386
00:21:12,557 --> 00:21:13,666
you know what?

387
00:21:15,688 --> 00:21:18,063
- Forget it.
- No. What?

388
00:21:18,508 --> 00:21:19,945
You want to do this right now?

389
00:21:20,156 --> 00:21:21,780
- Do what?
- Fine.

390
00:21:22,351 --> 00:21:24,765
It's been nice knowing you.
Happy Birthday.

391
00:21:26,383 --> 00:21:29,164
- So that's it?
- Yup. Good night.

392
00:21:33,269 --> 00:21:34,769
Hello?

393
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:40,766
It'll be fine.

394
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:43,378
Couples fight. Ask Gerry.

395
00:21:56,493 --> 00:21:58,660
What's wrong? Elevator out?

396
00:22:00,423 --> 00:22:02,402
I think I just broke up with Mark.

397
00:22:02,841 --> 00:22:05,323
Oh. Really?...

398
00:22:05,931 --> 00:22:07,003
I think so.

399
00:22:08,655 --> 00:22:09,655
So go home.

400
00:22:10,171 --> 00:22:12,666
Nope. I'm ready to work.

401
00:22:13,128 --> 00:22:14,376
You win. Again.

402
00:22:16,546 --> 00:22:18,420
You could've just told
me it was your birthday.

403
00:22:18,729 --> 00:22:20,881
Right, and there'd
be no repercussions.

404
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:23,196
- So now this is my fault?
- Well, it's not my fault

405
00:22:23,226 --> 00:22:25,511
you don't have a family,
friends or anywhere else to go.

406
00:22:25,977 --> 00:22:29,265
Go. Go. Run to him
like in the movies.

407
00:22:29,794 --> 00:22:32,172
- You don't have to be here.
- I do have to be here

408
00:22:32,202 --> 00:22:34,194
because of some
stupid idea from Danny

409
00:22:34,224 --> 00:22:35,667
who you had to hire
because you stole

410
00:22:35,697 --> 00:22:38,197
his other stupid idea
because you were drunk.

411
00:22:39,112 --> 00:22:41,873
Don't get personal because
you didn't do your work.

412
00:22:42,605 --> 00:22:44,543
And by the way,
I know it kills you,

413
00:22:44,573 --> 00:22:47,071
but guess what:
There is no "Danny's idea."

414
00:22:47,264 --> 00:22:49,281
Everything that comes in
here belongs to the agency.

415
00:22:49,311 --> 00:22:50,540
You mean you.

416
00:22:51,081 --> 00:22:54,516
- As long as you still work here.
- Is that a threat?

417
00:22:54,546 --> 00:22:55,569
Because I've already
taken somebody up

418
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:57,143
on one of those tonight.

419
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,992
- Relax.
- You know what?

420
00:22:59,431 --> 00:23:00,790
Here's a blank piece of paper.

421
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,525
Why don't you turn
that into glo-coat?

422
00:23:02,555 --> 00:23:04,142
Are you out of your mind?

423
00:23:04,436 --> 00:23:05,806
You gave me 20 ideas

424
00:23:05,964 --> 00:23:07,451
and I picked out one of them

425
00:23:07,481 --> 00:23:09,638
that was a kernel that
became that commercial.

426
00:23:09,676 --> 00:23:11,350
- So you remember.
- I do.

427
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:13,306
It was something about a cowboy.
Congratulations.

428
00:23:13,336 --> 00:23:15,975
No, it was something about
a kid locked in a closet

429
00:23:16,005 --> 00:23:17,027
because his mother
was making him wait

430
00:23:17,057 --> 00:23:18,178
for the floor to dry,

431
00:23:18,208 --> 00:23:19,646
which is basically
the whole commercial.

432
00:23:19,676 --> 00:23:22,311
- It's a kernel.
- Which you changed just enough

433
00:23:22,378 --> 00:23:25,078
- so that it was yours.
- I changed it into a commercial.

434
00:23:25,108 --> 00:23:27,846
What, are we going to shoot him
in the dark in the closet?

435
00:23:27,876 --> 00:23:31,044
That's the way it works. There are
no credits on commercials.

436
00:23:31,074 --> 00:23:34,216
- But you got the clio!
- It's your job!

437
00:23:34,254 --> 00:23:36,178
I give you money,
you give me ideas.

438
00:23:36,356 --> 00:23:37,658
And you never say thank you.

439
00:23:37,688 --> 00:23:39,706
That's what the money is for!

440
00:23:40,286 --> 00:23:42,870
You're young. You will
get your recognition.

441
00:23:42,932 --> 00:23:45,208
And honestly,
it is absolutely ridiculous

442
00:23:45,238 --> 00:23:48,606
to be two years into your
career and counting your ideas.

443
00:23:49,539 --> 00:23:52,141
Everything to you
is an opportunity.

444
00:23:52,582 --> 00:23:55,127
And you should be thanking me
every morning when you wake up,

445
00:23:55,157 --> 00:23:57,957
along with Jesus,
for giving you another day!

446
00:24:00,454 --> 00:24:02,590
Oh, come on.

447
00:24:06,142 --> 00:24:08,801
I'm sorry about your
boyfriend, okay?

448
00:24:36,557 --> 00:24:39,726
May 25th. Ideas for samsonite.

449
00:24:41,803 --> 00:24:44,264
Toughness means that......

450
00:25:07,042 --> 00:25:09,011
Peggy, get in here.

451
00:25:09,191 --> 00:25:11,588
- No.
- Come on.

452
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,657
You have to come in here right now.

453
00:25:15,807 --> 00:25:16,901
What do you want?

454
00:25:16,931 --> 00:25:18,823
You have to hear this. Sit down.

455
00:25:20,678 --> 00:25:22,355
Come on. Sit.

456
00:25:29,176 --> 00:25:31,631
So this is tape #4

457
00:25:31,661 --> 00:25:34,352
of "Sterling's gold," by Roger Sterling.

458
00:25:38,886 --> 00:25:40,854
So where was I?

459
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:44,209
Burt Cooper hated me
and I thought it was

460
00:25:44,239 --> 00:25:46,826
because he thought I'd
be an ally of my father,

461
00:25:47,755 --> 00:25:49,559
but it turned out it
was something to do

462
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:50,907
with my joie de vivre,

463
00:25:50,937 --> 00:25:53,390
My romantic prowess...

464
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:55,016
See tape #3...

465
00:25:56,127 --> 00:25:58,965
Including some time with
the queen of perversions,

466
00:25:59,383 --> 00:26:01,429
his secretary Ida Blankenship.

467
00:26:01,775 --> 00:26:05,012
You know what? Don't use her name.

468
00:26:06,128 --> 00:26:09,809
But it was all about him
hating my very youth,

469
00:26:11,015 --> 00:26:13,499
all because the poor
guy had been cut down

470
00:26:13,529 --> 00:26:14,828
in the height of his sexual prime

471
00:26:14,858 --> 00:26:17,146
by an unnecessary orchiectomy.

472
00:26:17,691 --> 00:26:20,460
Lyle Evans, M.D.

473
00:26:20,527 --> 00:26:22,158
I think he had him killed.

474
00:26:22,362 --> 00:26:24,645
Anyway, sometime in
the summer of '48...

475
00:26:25,113 --> 00:26:26,542
No, 1932...

476
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,330
No, 1939.

477
00:26:33,307 --> 00:26:34,877
Why are you laughing?

478
00:26:35,676 --> 00:26:37,281
It's like reading someone's diary.

479
00:26:37,311 --> 00:26:39,579
Come on. Ida was a hellcat?

480
00:26:39,647 --> 00:26:41,781
Cooper lost his balls?

481
00:26:41,849 --> 00:26:43,349
Roger's writing a book?

482
00:26:48,856 --> 00:26:49,937
I should go.

483
00:26:50,658 --> 00:26:53,115
- Stay and visit.
- I've got nothing to say.

484
00:26:53,661 --> 00:26:56,717
- Sure you do.
- No, it's personal.

485
00:26:57,064 --> 00:26:59,036
We have personal conversations.

486
00:26:59,433 --> 00:27:01,701
No, we don't, and I think
you like it that way.

487
00:27:01,731 --> 00:27:03,339
I know I do.

488
00:27:05,572 --> 00:27:06,891
Suit yourself.

489
00:27:08,475 --> 00:27:10,414
We're supposed to be
staring at each other

490
00:27:10,444 --> 00:27:12,814
over candlelight and
he invites my mother?

491
00:27:15,215 --> 00:27:16,542
He doesn't know me.

492
00:27:16,917 --> 00:27:18,369
It's not my fault.

493
00:27:21,956 --> 00:27:23,804
I guess I'm back to square one.

494
00:27:25,059 --> 00:27:26,059
Single.

495
00:27:27,328 --> 00:27:29,529
Well, as Danny would say,

496
00:27:29,596 --> 00:27:32,010
there's no use crying
over fish in the sea.

497
00:27:36,136 --> 00:27:37,636
Mouse!

498
00:27:38,811 --> 00:27:39,811
Over there!

499
00:27:44,511 --> 00:27:46,838
- What are you doing?
- Get the suitcase.

500
00:27:47,147 --> 00:27:50,316
- Why?
- I'm gonna seal it up in my nice samsonite

501
00:27:50,384 --> 00:27:52,552
- and throw it off the roof.
- Don't.

502
00:27:52,619 --> 00:27:54,858
Come on. Every idea you have
is some version of that.

503
00:27:54,888 --> 00:27:58,124
Let's do it.
Where'd you go, Mickey?

504
00:27:58,192 --> 00:28:01,527
- I think it's a rat.
- It's a mouse.

505
00:28:01,802 --> 00:28:03,172
I grew up on a farm.

506
00:28:07,634 --> 00:28:08,743
You know what?

507
00:28:09,403 --> 00:28:11,773
There's a way out of this
room we don't know about.

508
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:18,044
Are you okay?

509
00:28:20,014 --> 00:28:21,408
I think that's yours.

510
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,745
It's probably Mark.
I don't want to answer it.

511
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:27,557
It's still your birthday.

512
00:28:28,022 --> 00:28:29,458
Let me get you dinner.

513
00:28:34,728 --> 00:28:36,715
What's the most exciting
thing about a suitcase?

514
00:28:38,999 --> 00:28:40,334
Going somewhere.

515
00:28:41,654 --> 00:28:43,169
The acropolis.

516
00:28:44,905 --> 00:28:46,492
I'd like to go to Greece.

517
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:49,008
I heard all the good
cooks stayed there.

518
00:28:49,333 --> 00:28:51,480
I'd like to just go on a plane.
I've never been.

519
00:28:52,046 --> 00:28:54,764
- Is that right?
- I've heard about it, obviously.

520
00:28:55,115 --> 00:28:56,789
I've seen it in the movies.

521
00:28:57,317 --> 00:28:58,820
It's an incredible idea... flying.

522
00:28:59,219 --> 00:29:01,024
I remember on the way to Korea

523
00:29:01,255 --> 00:29:04,190
they told us how many thousand
feet in the air we were.

524
00:29:05,185 --> 00:29:07,120
There was some other kid there...

525
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:09,502
more of a yokel than me, even...

526
00:29:09,971 --> 00:29:12,919
and he screamed,
"man wasn't meant to fly!"

527
00:29:18,238 --> 00:29:20,043
Cooper has no testicles?

528
00:29:24,111 --> 00:29:26,446
Ick. I don't want water.

529
00:29:28,635 --> 00:29:30,713
My uncle Max said he had a suitcase

530
00:29:31,114 --> 00:29:32,614
that was always packed.

531
00:29:33,534 --> 00:29:36,439
He said, "a man has to be
ready to go at any moment."

532
00:29:39,059 --> 00:29:40,820
Jesus. Maybe it's a metaphor.

533
00:29:41,028 --> 00:29:42,876
There's something to that idea.

534
00:29:44,631 --> 00:29:45,697
I don't know.

535
00:29:46,139 --> 00:29:47,641
I can't tell the difference anymore

536
00:29:47,671 --> 00:29:51,071
between something that's good
and something that's awful.

537
00:29:52,106 --> 00:29:53,856
Well, they're very close.

538
00:29:55,676 --> 00:29:57,437
But the best idea always wins

539
00:29:58,045 --> 00:30:00,067
and you'll know it when you see it.

540
00:30:00,114 --> 00:30:02,354
Keep banging your
head against the wall

541
00:30:02,583 --> 00:30:04,383
then it happens.

542
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,247
And then it's done.

543
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,911
Yes, ma'am.

544
00:30:10,132 --> 00:30:11,977
Not like everything
else in my life.

545
00:30:13,501 --> 00:30:15,828
I mean, I know what
I'm supposed to want,

546
00:30:15,912 --> 00:30:18,051
but it just never feels right...

547
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:21,856
Or as important as
anything in that office.

548
00:30:26,184 --> 00:30:28,902
- I didn't know you were in Korea.
- Very briefly.

549
00:30:29,775 --> 00:30:31,241
Did you shoot anybody?

550
00:30:31,845 --> 00:30:34,030
Nope. I saw some people get killed.

551
00:30:35,223 --> 00:30:36,253
That's memorable.

552
00:30:36,283 --> 00:30:38,480
My father died right
in front of me...

553
00:30:39,006 --> 00:30:41,098
Heart attack. I was 12.

554
00:30:41,421 --> 00:30:44,139
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- It was pretty violent.

555
00:30:44,424 --> 00:30:45,761
The TV was on.

556
00:30:46,699 --> 00:30:48,286
That's why I hate sports.

557
00:30:49,308 --> 00:30:50,678
Nobody was around...

558
00:30:50,831 --> 00:30:53,266
Saturday afternoon.
My mother was shopping.

559
00:30:53,333 --> 00:30:55,268
I saw my father die too.

560
00:30:56,737 --> 00:30:58,771
He was kicked by a horse....

561
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,507
You're kidding.

562
00:31:04,778 --> 00:31:08,014
- What about your mother?
- I never knew her.

563
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:14,428
Why is there a dog
in the Parthenon?

564
00:31:17,491 --> 00:31:20,860
That is a roach.
Let's go someplace darker.

565
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:33,897
I hate dating. I'm terrible at it.

566
00:31:34,019 --> 00:31:36,020
You'll find someone.

567
00:31:36,987 --> 00:31:38,820
You know you're cute as hell.

568
00:31:40,525 --> 00:31:43,731
Men don't exactly stop
and stare in the streets.

569
00:31:43,895 --> 00:31:45,696
Do you want that?

570
00:31:46,031 --> 00:31:48,036
That's not what you
were supposed to say.

571
00:31:48,066 --> 00:31:50,134
What do you care what I think?

572
00:31:52,771 --> 00:31:56,173
Well, everybody thinks
I slept with you

573
00:31:56,241 --> 00:31:57,491
to get the job.

574
00:31:58,646 --> 00:31:59,973
They joke about it,

575
00:32:00,489 --> 00:32:01,979
like it's so funny

576
00:32:02,047 --> 00:32:04,748
because the possibility
was so remote.

577
00:32:06,384 --> 00:32:08,624
It's not because you
aren't attractive.

578
00:32:09,854 --> 00:32:12,456
I have to keep rules about work.

579
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:14,658
I have to.

580
00:32:16,161 --> 00:32:18,096
You're an attractive girl, Peggy.

581
00:32:19,898 --> 00:32:22,088
Not as attractive as some
of your other secretaries,

582
00:32:22,118 --> 00:32:23,118
I guess.

583
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:30,338
You don't want to start
giving me morality lessons,

584
00:32:30,368 --> 00:32:31,368
do you?

585
00:32:34,246 --> 00:32:36,046
People do things, right?

586
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:43,265
My mother thinks you
were responsible,

587
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:44,641
because you were the only person

588
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:46,611
who visited me in the hospital.

589
00:32:47,892 --> 00:32:49,001
Jesus. Really?

590
00:32:49,427 --> 00:32:50,632
She hates you.

591
00:32:54,966 --> 00:32:56,466
Do you know who it was?

592
00:32:56,735 --> 00:32:58,502
Of course I do.

593
00:33:01,673 --> 00:33:03,189
Do you ever think about it?

594
00:33:06,011 --> 00:33:07,223
I try not to...

595
00:33:09,714 --> 00:33:11,656
But then it comes
up out of nowhere.

596
00:33:14,686 --> 00:33:15,974
Playgrounds.

597
00:33:22,761 --> 00:33:24,361
Get up!

598
00:33:24,429 --> 00:33:26,030
Get up!

599
00:33:26,097 --> 00:33:28,966
- Come on! Get up!
- Get up!

600
00:33:29,034 --> 00:33:31,201
- Come on, get up!
- Get up.

601
00:33:31,269 --> 00:33:33,470
- Come on.
- Come on, get up!

602
00:33:33,538 --> 00:33:36,440
Get up! Get up!

603
00:33:36,508 --> 00:33:38,976
- Come on, get up!
- Come on, get up!

604
00:33:39,044 --> 00:33:41,245
Get up! Get up, bum!

605
00:33:41,313 --> 00:33:44,081
- Come on.
- It's a fix.

606
00:33:44,149 --> 00:33:46,274
- The fix is in.
- What happened?

607
00:33:46,951 --> 00:33:49,168
- It's over.
- Already? Who won?

608
00:33:49,754 --> 00:33:53,011
- Clay.
- Don't believe that for a second.

609
00:33:53,583 --> 00:33:55,257
No one goes down like that.

610
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,325
That's what the man just said.

611
00:33:59,597 --> 00:34:02,054
Some fight. I lost 100 bucks
in two minutes.

612
00:34:03,234 --> 00:34:05,826
Let's go back, pack up and go home.

613
00:34:10,175 --> 00:34:11,980
Damn elevator's like a rocket.

614
00:34:13,036 --> 00:34:14,594
I think I'm gonna be sick.

615
00:34:27,158 --> 00:34:28,425
Are you okay?

616
00:34:42,707 --> 00:34:44,123
Do you want any water?

617
00:34:46,722 --> 00:34:47,845
What?

618
00:34:49,781 --> 00:34:52,416
I have toothpaste and a
toothbrush in my desk.

619
00:34:56,087 --> 00:34:57,245
Peggy?...

620
00:35:00,558 --> 00:35:02,587
- Peggy.
- I'll be right back.

621
00:35:05,997 --> 00:35:06,997
Peggy?

622
00:35:11,703 --> 00:35:12,889
Duck?

623
00:35:17,609 --> 00:35:19,843
What are you doing?

624
00:35:19,873 --> 00:35:21,153
Leaving Draper a little present.

625
00:35:21,183 --> 00:35:22,778
Don't! That's disgusting.

626
00:35:23,577 --> 00:35:25,275
Would you let me concentrate?

627
00:35:25,305 --> 00:35:26,805
This is Roger's office.

628
00:35:28,586 --> 00:35:30,521
Now come one. Pull up your pants.

629
00:35:36,168 --> 00:35:37,625
I'm not going anywhere

630
00:35:38,476 --> 00:35:39,498
without you.

631
00:35:41,099 --> 00:35:43,901
Baby. Baby, I need you so bad.

632
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:47,775
You wouldn't answer your phone

633
00:35:48,787 --> 00:35:51,331
and your roommate said
you were still at work.

634
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:54,987
Why didn't you answer
the phone, Peewee?

635
00:35:59,789 --> 00:36:00,789
What's going on?

636
00:36:00,819 --> 00:36:02,820
Just go lay down.

637
00:36:04,022 --> 00:36:05,527
You don't belong in here.

638
00:36:05,557 --> 00:36:08,325
So, Peggy, I see you're not alone.

639
00:36:10,462 --> 00:36:12,600
I guess when screwing me
couldn't get you anything,

640
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:14,102
you had to go back to Draper.

641
00:36:14,132 --> 00:36:15,676
- Duck, let's go.
- No.

642
00:36:17,101 --> 00:36:19,503
That's right. We were in love.

643
00:36:21,206 --> 00:36:23,407
Turns out she's just another whore.

644
00:36:24,742 --> 00:36:25,742
Hey!

645
00:36:29,472 --> 00:36:30,972
Jesus! Would you stop?!

646
00:36:37,329 --> 00:36:39,380
Stop it! You're both drunk!

647
00:36:39,657 --> 00:36:42,593
You know, I killed
17 men at Okinawa.

648
00:36:45,363 --> 00:36:46,458
Uncle.

649
00:36:49,234 --> 00:36:51,126
What the hell is wrong with you?

650
00:36:51,202 --> 00:36:53,398
You still think
you're better than me?

651
00:36:57,008 --> 00:36:58,790
Come on, Peggy. Let's go.

652
00:37:32,977 --> 00:37:35,979
I got rid of him. Are you okay?

653
00:37:37,882 --> 00:37:39,132
Yeah.

654
00:37:41,352 --> 00:37:42,466
Are you?

655
00:37:44,489 --> 00:37:48,172
I, uh... I never thought...

656
00:37:48,593 --> 00:37:50,316
I'm so sorry. I...

657
00:37:51,506 --> 00:37:54,569
you know what? I don't
know why I was with him.

658
00:37:54,636 --> 00:37:57,301
- It was a confusing time.
- Stop.

659
00:37:59,093 --> 00:38:00,938
You don't have to explain.

660
00:38:05,777 --> 00:38:07,292
Can you get me a drink?

661
00:38:09,213 --> 00:38:11,453
How long are you gonna
go on like this?

662
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:14,351
I have to make a phone call

663
00:38:14,419 --> 00:38:17,020
and I know it's going
to be bad, okay?

664
00:38:18,222 --> 00:38:19,656
Oh.

665
00:38:21,059 --> 00:38:22,603
Do you want to be alone?

666
00:38:23,628 --> 00:38:25,228
Just make me a drink.

667
00:38:59,897 --> 00:39:01,798
Sorry if I embarrassed you.

668
00:39:01,866 --> 00:39:02,866
Shh.

669
00:40:54,553 --> 00:40:57,690
- Hello.
- It's me.

670
00:40:58,482 --> 00:40:59,717
She's gone.

671
00:41:02,898 --> 00:41:03,907
I know.

672
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:06,472
She wanted you to know.

673
00:41:09,209 --> 00:41:11,144
I'm sorry I didn't call. I was...

674
00:41:15,829 --> 00:41:17,503
did she want to talk to me?

675
00:41:18,218 --> 00:41:20,615
You know, she wasn't really there.

676
00:41:26,701 --> 00:41:27,887
I'm coming out.

677
00:41:29,484 --> 00:41:30,887
I'll make the arrangements.

678
00:41:30,917 --> 00:41:34,521
No need. She left
her body to science.

679
00:41:35,516 --> 00:41:37,053
She said that she wanted to go

680
00:41:37,083 --> 00:41:39,958
to U.C.L.A. Medical
school tuition-free.

681
00:41:41,284 --> 00:41:42,567
Of course she did.

682
00:41:47,732 --> 00:41:50,023
I'm coming out.
I'll take care of the house.

683
00:41:50,053 --> 00:41:52,597
I'd like to stay here
if that's okay with you,

684
00:41:52,758 --> 00:41:54,606
take some time off from school.

685
00:41:57,769 --> 00:41:59,450
Of course. That's fine.

686
00:42:01,049 --> 00:42:02,749
She's in a better place.

687
00:42:09,973 --> 00:42:11,387
That's what they say.

688
00:42:13,796 --> 00:42:17,252
It's late and it's been a long day.

689
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:20,381
Okay.

690
00:42:21,681 --> 00:42:24,045
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

691
00:42:25,872 --> 00:42:26,924
Stephanie.

692
00:43:02,991 --> 00:43:04,125
What happened?

693
00:43:08,835 --> 00:43:11,709
Somebody very important to me died.

694
00:43:16,833 --> 00:43:17,833
Who?

695
00:43:19,598 --> 00:43:22,229
The only person in the
world who really knew me.

696
00:43:31,446 --> 00:43:32,784
That's not true.

697
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:41,861
You should go home.

698
00:43:43,938 --> 00:43:45,352
You can come in late.

699
00:43:46,773 --> 00:43:47,839
I'll be fine.

700
00:43:49,868 --> 00:43:51,105
I'm so sorry.

701
00:43:56,835 --> 00:43:57,835
Good night.

702
00:44:37,375 --> 00:44:39,163
Drop and give me 20.

703
00:44:40,406 --> 00:44:41,490
You asshole.

704
00:44:42,455 --> 00:44:44,502
Get to work. It's 10:30, maggot.

705
00:44:46,202 --> 00:44:48,520
- Oh.
- Did you spend the night here?

706
00:44:49,793 --> 00:44:51,695
- Yeah.
- See the fight?

707
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:53,580
No.

708
00:44:53,753 --> 00:44:56,183
90 seconds of boxing and
three hours of analysis.

709
00:44:56,213 --> 00:44:58,040
- And we still don't know who won.
- Clay won.

710
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:59,223
Read the paper.

711
00:45:06,274 --> 00:45:07,274
Come in.

712
00:45:11,926 --> 00:45:13,839
You look fresh. Did you go home?

713
00:45:14,426 --> 00:45:16,816
I spruced up. Come over here.

714
00:45:19,116 --> 00:45:20,182
Look at this.

715
00:45:26,906 --> 00:45:28,928
I think you have to know the photo.

716
00:45:29,092 --> 00:45:31,940
It's on the front page of
every paper. It's historic.

717
00:45:33,483 --> 00:45:35,968
How do we know it's the
tourister that got knocked out?

718
00:45:35,998 --> 00:45:38,088
Because the slogan will say so.

719
00:45:39,014 --> 00:45:41,113
How do you put it on TV?
Are they animated?

720
00:45:41,796 --> 00:45:43,557
Why are you shitting on this?

721
00:45:45,144 --> 00:45:46,144
I'm tired.

722
00:45:47,654 --> 00:45:48,654
It's good.

723
00:45:50,023 --> 00:45:51,176
It's very good.

724
00:46:10,763 --> 00:46:13,137
Give it to Joey... No, Stan...

725
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:16,093
Then go home, shower,

726
00:46:16,396 --> 00:46:18,077
then come back and
give me 10 tag lines.

727
00:46:18,107 --> 00:46:19,107
Okay.

728
00:46:24,822 --> 00:46:25,975
Open or closed?

729
00:46:26,923 --> 00:46:27,923
Open.

730
00:46:27,962 --> 00:46:32,962
