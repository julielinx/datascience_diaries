1
00:00:38,938 --> 00:00:42,374
<i>And after that,
I played the nurse in Romeo and Juliet.</i>

2
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:48,879
<i>And after that I played Dorine the maid
in Tartuffe by Molière.</i>

3
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:53,609
And I guess that's it.

4
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,709
Thank you, Hillary.

5
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:57,221
I'd love it if you could do the twist
one more time.

6
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:08,290
Thank you, Hillary. We'll let you know.

7
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:16,435
Harry, you are not in this process.
You're a spectator. Don't forget it.

8
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:20,604
Bacardi's coming in on Tuesday
to see if Daiquiri Beach has legs.

9
00:01:20,713 --> 00:01:23,307
Don wants copy Monday morning
and art Monday night.

10
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:27,819
- We should probably have the whole team.
- This weekend? No.

11
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,889
I'm sorry, but we just heard about it.

12
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:33,550
- Bullshit.
- I have plans. I really do.

13
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,363
Well, I would love to work all weekend,
but I'm just a spectator.

14
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:39,625
Whose crack did it fall through?

15
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:42,132
Because you are going
to spend the weekend being our slave.

16
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:44,897
- No finger-pointing.
- The bad news is

17
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:48,531
they need five more vacation situations
for Bacardi rum.

18
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:51,041
The good news is
we're going to be out of your hair.

19
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:53,442
Jane and Roger Sterling's
garden party on the island.

20
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:56,575
- Derby day.
- You're going back in time?

21
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:58,116
Are any of you wearing seersucker?

22
00:01:58,218 --> 00:01:59,810
I don't want to look like
a barbershop quartet.

23
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:02,114
- You're all going?
- I really wish I wasn't.

24
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:04,952
Well, then don't. Give me your glasses.
I'll go as you.

25
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:06,650
Sorry about that.

26
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,228
- Good luck, gentles.
- Sorry.

27
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:15,096
You know, we all started at the same time.

28
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:18,432
- I've been here six years longer than you.
- They hate creative.

29
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:33,884
My goodness.
I didn't expect to see you here.

30
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,922
- For a little while longer.
- Lovely to see you, Jane,

31
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:38,786
I mean Mrs. Sterling.

32
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:46,391
I'll catch up with you, girls.

33
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,736
I just stopped by.
Roger had my rings resized.

34
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,965
I keep losing weight.
Where are you living now?

35
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:57,804
Same old place, but we're looking.
We're thinking about Riverdale.

36
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:00,243
It's near Columbia Pres
and Greg wants a yard.

37
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:03,941
I don't know. I get a nosebleed
anywhere above 86th Street.

38
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,220
- God, it's so great to see you.
- Likewise.

39
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:13,323
Joan, I have a tiny favor to ask you.

40
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:15,053
They're doing construction
in front of the building

41
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:17,254
and my driver's gonna be circling,

42
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:21,823
so if you could have one of the girls
run down at 1:15 and flag him down.

43
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:26,004
Hello, Ginger.

44
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:38,044
Olive, from now on, there's no need
to include Mr. Crane in casting.

45
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:40,949
Of course.
And I brought you tea and coffee.

46
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,045
I'll just have whichever one you don't want.

47
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:47,320
I... Coffee. That's what I usually drink.
That's what I've been drinking, right?

48
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:49,486
Well, Lola said
you don't like a second cup of coffee

49
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:51,530
because it makes you edgy.

50
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:54,600
I want you to forget everything
Lola told you.

51
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:04,401
I left for an hour
to go get the nylons for tomorrow,

52
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:07,138
and look what happened.

53
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:10,182
Carla said he thought he was on KP duty.

54
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:14,049
- We don't have to go, you know.
- I said we would.

55
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,984
It's Roger and Jane.

56
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:20,749
I want to go. I bought a dress.

57
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:30,626
"The warmth of the climate
disposed the natives

58
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:35,003
"to the most intemperate enjoyment
of tranquility and opulence,

59
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:39,670
"and the lively... "

60
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,269
Licentiousness.

61
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:44,878
Go ahead.

62
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:52,721
"... of the Greeks was blended
with the hereditary softness of the Syrians.

63
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:57,762
"Fashion was the only law,
pleasure was the only pursuit

64
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:00,891
"and the splendor of dress and furniture

65
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,333
"was the only distinction
of the citizens of Antioch. "

66
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:07,703
- Gene.
- Hello, Don.

67
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:11,670
- How's Babylon?
- Bedtime.

68
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,379
It's all right. Go wash your teeth.

69
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:22,351
You just wait. All hell's gonna break loose.

70
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:26,157
Good night, Grandpa Gene.

71
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:44,105
- Like that.
- Paul Kinsey with a two-stroke lead.

72
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:47,509
- What is your secret?
- I use Harry Crane's paddle

73
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:49,774
and I pretend that's his fat head.

74
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:53,844
What kind of fruit do you put in this?

75
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:58,014
- It's rum and Coke. I don't know.
- A cherry? All we have is olives.

76
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,716
New drinks, new copy or both?

77
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:04,558
Bikinis that match the drinks and new copy.
Something cute.

78
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,960
"It's Bacardi-licious. "

79
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,971
"It's Bacardi-lightful. "

80
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:16,838
We're supposed to sit here
and pretend like we're on vacation?

81
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:22,247
- They're probably drinking mint juleps.
- Booze puts me to sleep.

82
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:25,840
I will take grass any hour of the day.
It helps me think.

83
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:28,853
When I was at Princeton,
I wrote my senior thesis

84
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:30,582
on the passions of the Stoics.

85
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,056
Mary Jane was my muse.

86
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:35,821
Paul helps me sleep.

87
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:40,490
Peggy, go get a blender.
Maybe we can turn this into a frappé.

88
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,591
- You get it.
- I'm eating.

89
00:06:58,217 --> 00:06:59,582
Olive?

90
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:05,949
- What are you doing here?
- Well, if you're working, I'm working.

91
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:10,290
- It's okay for you to go home.
- I already canceled my plans.

92
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:12,296
Phil and I were going to
drive up to The Cloisters.

93
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:15,731
And Steven, my son,
he's at Boston College.

94
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:17,530
He was thinking of coming down
with his girlfriend,

95
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:21,300
but I'm not sure that's working out.
He's picky.

96
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:28,278
Anyway, so Phil's taking a trip to the dump,
and here I am, no worse for wear.

97
00:07:35,254 --> 00:07:37,745
Don't I seem as important as Cosgrove?

98
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:41,224
I mean, Campbell makes sense,
to the manner born.

99
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:44,694
- So you like to get high?
- Whenever I can.

100
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:48,492
My cousin used to know someone,
but he got married.

101
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:50,228
Who's your friend?

102
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:54,770
A guy like you?
There must be somebody you can call.

103
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:58,675
Yeah. No. Of course.

104
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:03,945
<i>Sally, get up here.</i>

105
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:12,689
I just walked backwards
all the way from the living room.

106
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:13,918
Zip.

107
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,592
You look pretty.

108
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:21,098
I look like an open umbrella.

109
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,794
Grandpa says you're going to a soirée.

110
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:25,495
Don't bother him.

111
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:28,471
Go watch TV.

112
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:37,381
- Grandpa?
- I'm indisposed.

113
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,845
What are you doing?
You're going to break it.

114
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:12,577
- Who told you that?
- I've done it.

115
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:16,883
If it happens, I'll go get my little
screwdriver and put on a new one.

116
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,593
Jesus, I stink.

117
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:25,356
I can finish up out here.
You take a nice, long bath.

118
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:32,102
No. No, no, no.
Ettinger goes at the head of the table.

119
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:34,729
He's the chief of surgery.
It's where he always sits.

120
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:38,003
Not in your home, Greg.
Host at the head, hostess at the foot

121
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,634
or whichever is nearest to the kitchen,

122
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,872
- and then it's boy, girl, boy, girl.
- Who says?

123
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:44,006
Emily Post. Everyone.

124
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:47,449
Ronald Ettinger does not read Emily Post.
He's going to expect to sit there,

125
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:50,716
and he's going to expect me
and Rick Stolich to be his footstools.

126
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:52,017
Well, I won't have their wives think

127
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:53,648
you have a wife who doesn't know
how to set a table.

128
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,590
Joanie, I don't want
to have a fight right now.

129
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:57,322
Then stop talking.

130
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:07,736
A buffet would be slightly more casual
and people could sit where they will.

131
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:12,277
And we could put the chafing dish
that they gave us right in the middle.

132
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:14,106
Perfect.

133
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:18,907
Hey.

134
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:34,992
<i>...urged by Republicans
to appoint a special prosecutor</i>

135
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:38,229
<i>to investigate the scandal-ridden
State Liquor Authority.</i>

136
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:39,497
<i>The governor has expressed confidence...</i>

137
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:41,539
Carla.

138
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:42,867
Carla?

139
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:45,274
Is she here?

140
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:47,877
Look at you.

141
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:52,348
I know I look good for my condition,
but I'm still in my condition.

142
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:55,386
- Did they leave yet?
- No, I think they're in the living room.

143
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,183
Well, I've been robbed.

144
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:59,450
I had it right here and now I don't.

145
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,260
Daddy, what are you talking about?

146
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:05,296
I had $35. Now I have $30.

147
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:07,662
- Are you sure?
- Mr. Hofstadt,

148
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:10,531
why don't you go sit down
and we'll all look for it?

149
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,159
You'll look for it, will you?

150
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:14,603
Daddy, you know how forgetful you are.

151
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:16,964
I'm missing $5.

152
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:20,203
I'll give you $5.

153
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:23,912
Don, will you give him something?

154
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:28,852
- Here, Gene. Here you go.
- No, I don't want your money.

155
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:33,084
You people, you think money
is the answer to every problem.

156
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:35,793
No, just this particular problem.

157
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:37,726
Daddy, I'm sorry.
I don't know what you want.

158
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,263
I want my $5!

159
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:45,369
Well, I think I am finally ready to go.

160
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:54,445
Come on, let's go out in the yard.

161
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,585
I forgot how many tourists there are
in midtown.

162
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:04,315
They're like vermin.

163
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:06,448
Jeffrey, this is my colleague Smitty.

164
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,790
- How you doing, Jeff?
- Not bad. Not bad at all.

165
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:13,456
- So what do you have for us?
- What do you want?

166
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:16,763
I've got Dexies, Benzedrine strips, boo.

167
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:19,064
Probably get you junk
if you really wanted it.

168
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:22,370
- How do you know each other?
- Jeffrey's an old friend.

169
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:26,002
You're looking at the two great cocksmen
of Princeton '55.

170
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:30,515
The times you must have had.
Can we buy some dope?

171
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:36,220
I'll give you all four for $10, plus delivery.

172
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:41,616
I'm just kidding, but I should.
I mean, you never call me.

173
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,623
When's the last time I saw you?

174
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:50,068
- Give me your sweater.
- It's mohair.

175
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:04,579
- May I?
- Relax. Sit down.

176
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,481
You ever look out this window?

177
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:34,602
It's beautiful.

178
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,153
Nice to see you both. Isn't this something?

179
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:45,848
Betty, you remember Trudy.

180
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:48,017
Harry Crane. My wife, Jennifer.

181
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,822
Ken Cosgrove. We've met.

182
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:54,263
- Nice to see you all again.
- When are you due?

183
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:56,596
Any minute. Can't you tell?

184
00:13:58,137 --> 00:13:59,695
That last month was the worst,

185
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:02,603
- but of course this is your second.
- Third.

186
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:06,804
- How old is yours?
- Eight months. Beatrice Grace.

187
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:11,812
Should we take a tour?

188
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:16,212
- I grew up in a club just like this.
- Me, too.

189
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:26,856
That portly fellow in the glen plaid,
second at DuPont.

190
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:29,059
The one next to him, Pan Am.

191
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:35,938
Don't hand out your card.

192
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:50,152
- Now you're getting ridiculous.
- Maybe it fell out of your pocket.

193
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:53,316
- It didn't.
- Well, I didn't take it.

194
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:56,053
- I didn't say you did.
- Not yet.

195
00:14:56,862 --> 00:14:58,727
Will you stop it, Viola?

196
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:01,265
My name's not Viola. It's Carla.

197
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:03,961
Do you know Viola?

198
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,895
We don't all know each other, Mr. Hofstadt.

199
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,403
Done looking already?

200
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:16,274
Really?

201
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:51,410
- Are they still here?
- Yes, they're in Mr. Kinsey's office.

202
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:54,782
I know what they're doing.
You don't want to go in there.

203
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:57,685
- What are they doing?
- All I'm saying is,

204
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:01,556
they obviously don't want to work,
so you should just go home.

205
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:13,037
I love the commercials where the dog runs
right up to the bowl of food.

206
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:15,737
How do you make him do that?

207
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:19,239
- You starve him?
- So you two got a lot of girls?

208
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,447
Shit.

209
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,540
Is that that old lady again?

210
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:28,212
- Let me in.
- Go away.

211
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,015
It stinks out here.

212
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:33,224
Come in quick.

213
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:37,256
What are you doing?

214
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:41,390
I know what you're doing. Who are you?

215
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,663
Jeffrey Graves, Princeton, '55.

216
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,101
Look, I need it for inspiration.

217
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:51,103
It's Saturday, for God's sake.

218
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,303
You can go home. We'll do the work.

219
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:56,176
Are you kidding?
We'll end up with nothing.

220
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:00,816
I've got some ideas we can kick around,

221
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:04,320
but you're gonna have to tell me your name,
sweetheart.

222
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:09,456
I'm Peggy Olson,
and I want to smoke some marijuana.

223
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,795
You won't like it.

224
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:13,888
How do you know what I'll like?

225
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:15,330
You never ask me how I feel about anything

226
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:17,231
except brassieres and body odor
and makeup.

227
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:25,333
I'd like to know how you feel
about a lot of things.

228
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:27,912
- Jesus. Give it a rest.
- Come on.

229
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,424
Just like a strong cigarette.

230
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,693
Can you believe this?

231
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:03,906
<i>The sun shines bright</i>

232
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:07,042
<i>On the old Kentucky home</i>

233
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:08,551
<i>'Tis summer</i>

234
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:12,384
<i>And the darkies are gay</i>

235
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:16,418
<i>The corn top's ripe</i>

236
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:20,089
<i>And the meadow's in the bloom</i>

237
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:25,159
<i>While the birds make music all the day</i>

238
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:32,335
<i>The young folks roll on the little cabin floor</i>

239
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:35,072
<i>All merry, all happy...</i>

240
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,909
Can we go?

241
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:41,579
What about the horse race?
What about supper?

242
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:45,016
Don't disappear. I want to dance.

243
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:48,252
<i>And my old Kentucky home</i>

244
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,124
<i>Good night</i>

245
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:53,524
I did this at home for her
with a little shoe polish.

246
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:54,997
She thought it was a scream.

247
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,330
I love it.

248
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:01,070
<i>Weep no more</i>

249
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:03,767
<i>my lady</i>

250
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:10,342
<i>Oh, weep no more today</i>

251
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:17,578
Can I get an old-fashioned?

252
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:20,457
We're on the same mission.

253
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:23,895
This bar looks like it was set up
by a blind man,

254
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,827
and there's no bourbon.

255
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,768
There's a hole at the end here.

256
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:36,864
I don't have a lot of time.

257
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:46,281
- Rye okay with you?
- You look like you know what you're doing.

258
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:48,717
I'm Connie, by the way.

259
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,014
Don.

260
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:54,615
Service always this good around here?

261
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:58,129
- You're not a member either?
- No, no.

262
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:02,765
Nice piece of property, though.

263
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,733
Who are you hiding from?

264
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:09,568
I am at work disguised as a party.

265
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:12,804
I'm at work disguised as a wedding.

266
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:17,175
I hate other people's weddings.

267
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:21,043
- Why's that?
- Make me nervous,

268
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:24,384
all those expectations.

269
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:26,514
And these poor kids in here,

270
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,029
that is a match made in the boardroom.

271
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:36,000
When I was a boy,

272
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:40,504
there was a mansion on the river
I used to paddle by in my johnboat.

273
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:47,505
Twinkling lights, violins,
girls giggling about something.

274
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:58,019
It's different inside.

275
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:06,553
- Where you from?
- San Antonio, New Mexico,

276
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:11,869
before it was a state. Don't ask me that. Old.

277
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:14,663
You look fit.

278
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,139
You ever see

279
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:20,534
<i>A Midsummer Dream with Mickey Rooney?</i>

280
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:22,614
<i>A Midsummer Night's Dream?</i>

281
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:24,648
By golly, you're prickly.

282
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:29,949
I'm Republican, like everyone else in there,

283
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:34,389
but somehow,
no matter how expensive my cufflinks,

284
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:37,524
I feel like I've got the head of a jackass.

285
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,568
Where I grew up, there was a roadhouse.

286
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:48,731
It boasted live music.
That meant a drum, a bass

287
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,331
and a player piano with nobody at it.

288
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:53,434
I parked cars.

289
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:56,272
Fancy people would go there.

290
00:21:56,381 --> 00:22:02,342
They'd get loud, they'd get drunk,
but they wouldn't let me use the toilet.

291
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:08,154
So when nature called,
I'd open up a trunk and relieve myself.

292
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:13,293
- You didn't.
- I was 15.

293
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:17,901
There's probably some kid out there
doing it to us right now.

294
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,732
Where you come from?

295
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:23,969
Pennsylvania by way of Illinois.

296
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:28,603
We lost our farm, ended up in coal country.

297
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:31,206
And here you are.

298
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:36,011
A pleasure to meet you, Don.

299
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:38,450
Hell of a cocktail.

300
00:23:00,912 --> 00:23:02,470
Rum. Have some.

301
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,739
Some rum?

302
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:08,046
If you were feeling it, you'd be hungry.

303
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:11,281
I am hungry, but it's not worth moving.

304
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:15,484
She is a riot. Makes me wish I had a job.

305
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:18,456
Bacardi Eisenhower.

306
00:23:23,468 --> 00:23:25,527
What are you laughing about?

307
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:30,167
You do have a job, Jeffrey.
You're a drug pusher.

308
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:35,776
What is that, an English accent?

309
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:39,281
It's a little different than freshman year.

310
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:42,285
Kinsey was a real Jersey.

311
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:46,519
I guess that's why they have scholarships.

312
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:52,357
Get out.

313
00:23:57,169 --> 00:24:02,300
You're arrogant. And you know what else?
You can't sing.

314
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,140
Take it back.

315
00:24:05,243 --> 00:24:08,440
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here not to fight.

316
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:10,276
Take it back, Graves.

317
00:24:11,082 --> 00:24:16,213
Fine. I guess they kicked you out
of the Tigertones because you were too tall.

318
00:24:17,322 --> 00:24:18,550
Graves...

319
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:21,285
We're done here.

320
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:25,187
And by the way,
I left the 'Tones because I had mono.

321
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:31,398
Fine. Why don't you sing a little
and let them be the judge?

322
00:25:24,723 --> 00:25:26,486
I am so high.

323
00:25:33,965 --> 00:25:36,456
I wish you were waiting for me.

324
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:44,940
So who are you waiting for?

325
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,435
A friend.

326
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,178
What is that like?

327
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:58,722
I don't know.

328
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:01,021
I don't think about it.

329
00:26:01,793 --> 00:26:05,024
Right now, it's uncomfortable, mostly.

330
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,990
But it moves around in there.

331
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:10,595
It does.

332
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:19,366
I'm going to blame this on martinis, but...
May I?

333
00:26:41,066 --> 00:26:43,091
She's not moving now.

334
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:48,396
Who are you waiting for?

335
00:26:48,506 --> 00:26:49,700
My date.

336
00:26:50,842 --> 00:26:53,868
You can't show up to these things stag,

337
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:56,072
but then you run into people.

338
00:27:03,855 --> 00:27:07,256
I apologize. There was a line for the mirror
and I feel like I'm melting.

339
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:09,452
No trouble at all.

340
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:15,695
I hope they start playing some real music.
I'm in the mood to dance, aren't you?

341
00:27:18,436 --> 00:27:19,596
Martinis.

342
00:27:19,704 --> 00:27:22,537
Please, don't stand on ceremony. Dig in.

343
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:30,143
I'll cut the cheese.

344
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:34,675
What are you laughing about?

345
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:36,583
Everything is some private joke with them.

346
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:38,747
What were you giggling
about the other day?

347
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:41,655
- A code pink.
- What's that?

348
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,489
They put a call over the PA

349
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:47,531
whenever there's an
attractive unconscious female.

350
00:27:47,632 --> 00:27:49,862
I've never heard of that.

351
00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:52,095
- Me either.
- Sounds like where I work.

352
00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:57,205
- I'm gonna check the roast.
- You need a hand?

353
00:27:57,308 --> 00:27:59,503
- I don't think so.
- Nonsense.

354
00:27:59,711 --> 00:28:02,236
- Allow me.
- Thank you.

355
00:28:03,214 --> 00:28:04,374
Thanks.

356
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:09,052
You really have a lovely place.

357
00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:13,181
I'm glad you like it. I did most of it myself.

358
00:28:13,758 --> 00:28:15,385
You must do well.

359
00:28:15,493 --> 00:28:18,519
It's not easy. Not that I'm complaining.

360
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:20,291
You think they make no money now?

361
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:23,390
You should've seen back when
Ronald and I were first married.

362
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:27,066
I taught kindergarten
and made three times what Ron did.

363
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:29,299
We lived in a pit.

364
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:32,137
But one day
you'll look back on this time and smile.

365
00:28:32,243 --> 00:28:33,767
Just don't get pregnant.

366
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:35,368
Excuse me?

367
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:39,144
The last thing you want right now is a child.

368
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:43,186
I told her the same thing,
but she doesn't listen. She's a nurse.

369
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,246
You do what you want.

370
00:28:45,356 --> 00:28:48,757
If Greg becomes chief resident,
then things will get easier.

371
00:28:49,661 --> 00:28:51,959
The fact that Greg can
get a woman like you

372
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:55,726
makes me feel good about his future,
no matter what happens.

373
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:06,077
Bobby, Sally, suppertime!

374
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:13,451
You have to eat something.

375
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:16,352
You don't tell me what to do.

376
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:20,413
You either eat or you don't eat,
but there'll be no more of that.

377
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:26,497
I told you I'm not hungry.

378
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:30,329
- I want my money.
- You don't even know that you lost it.

379
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:33,802
Maybe you should lie down. Sally!

380
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,328
Grandpa, is this it?

381
00:30:04,869 --> 00:30:06,928
Grandpa, is this your money?

382
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:10,941
I don't know. Let me see it.

383
00:30:45,076 --> 00:30:47,909
Yeah, that's it, all right.

384
00:30:53,318 --> 00:30:56,845
Well, that's a relief.
Sally, your food's getting cold.

385
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,402
Excuse me.

386
00:31:21,012 --> 00:31:22,502
Why, thank you.

387
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:28,443
He's pretending like
we didn't have a fight on the way over.

388
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,350
He seems amenable right now.

389
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:31,683
I warned him that with this set

390
00:31:31,789 --> 00:31:34,121
there was a good chance
one of my old beaus might appear.

391
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:37,023
- And yet they didn't.
- Which is a relief.

392
00:31:40,498 --> 00:31:43,467
I don't want to. All I have to talk about
is work, which is verboten.

393
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:46,128
Well, that's nonsense.
You're very charming.

394
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:48,330
Come on. I'll talk.

395
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:51,237
They want to know
we're having a good time.

396
00:32:01,152 --> 00:32:03,416
Well, we're really having a good time.

397
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,222
Haven't seen you two on the dance floor.

398
00:32:08,326 --> 00:32:11,261
I don't move that well right now.

399
00:32:11,996 --> 00:32:13,827
Don loves to dance,

400
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:17,732
but I think I'm disappointing him
because I don't feel like it.

401
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:21,062
Your asses are going to
wear out those chairs.

402
00:32:21,172 --> 00:32:22,298
Roger.

403
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:27,277
Don, Betty, this is Henry Francis and...

404
00:32:27,378 --> 00:32:28,436
Sherry Ardmore.

405
00:32:28,546 --> 00:32:31,014
Henry works in the governor's office.

406
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:33,481
Don Draper. This is my wife, Betty.

407
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,683
Hank, tell them where
you were this afternoon.

408
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,723
- Roger...
- They're gonna read about it in the paper.

409
00:32:39,824 --> 00:32:43,191
He just came from Pocantico.
Rockefeller married Happy.

410
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:46,752
She just got divorced a month ago.
She has four children.

411
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:48,889
You see? That's the first reaction.

412
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,697
Divorce is political hari-kari.

413
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,601
Now we'll be stuck with Goldwater.

414
00:32:54,706 --> 00:32:57,038
The primaries are still a long way off.

415
00:32:57,141 --> 00:33:00,474
- Why did Rocky marry her?
- They're in love.

416
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:08,509
We're going to dance.

417
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:11,588
Betty, Don,
are you sure you're not up for it?

418
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:34,836
I have got to bring a date next time.

419
00:34:51,055 --> 00:34:54,957
<i>"This is the way the world ends
This is the way the world ends</i>

420
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:59,155
"This is the way the world ends
Not with a bang but a whimper"

421
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:05,662
We got it. You're educated
and you sang in the Tiger...

422
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:08,261
- What are they called?
- Tigertones.

423
00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:14,734
I went to the University of Michigan.

424
00:35:15,746 --> 00:35:18,544
I went to Miss Deaver's Secretarial School.

425
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:20,815
Can you believe her?

426
00:35:20,918 --> 00:35:24,046
I keep thinking about rum,
and I keep thinking about Cuba,

427
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:26,988
and I keep thinking about
how we're all going to die.

428
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:30,994
- We almost died.
- But we didn't.

429
00:35:31,662 --> 00:35:33,857
How about something about life?

430
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:37,260
Let's go on the roof.

431
00:35:38,503 --> 00:35:39,834
And do what?

432
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:44,737
Think about Daiquiri Beach.
We need five more situations for rum.

433
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:52,071
On the roof is a good idea, actually.
A hammock right between the clotheslines.

434
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:55,284
And you still say Daiquiri Beach.

435
00:35:55,853 --> 00:35:57,411
Are you working?

436
00:35:59,123 --> 00:36:00,454
I think so.

437
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:09,794
You both can leave.

438
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,230
I'm in a very good place right now.

439
00:36:35,459 --> 00:36:38,724
You left your purse in your office,
unattended.

440
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:42,492
- Someone could have stolen it.
- No one's here.

441
00:36:44,335 --> 00:36:47,736
You think I don't know
what you've been doing in there?

442
00:36:48,806 --> 00:36:52,173
- I don't know what to say.
- I've got nothing to hide.

443
00:36:52,276 --> 00:36:57,839
Well, you're free to do whatever you want,
but you're not thinking about your future.

444
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:01,182
The thing is,

445
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,753
I have a job.

446
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:08,290
I have my own office
with my name on the door,

447
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:12,251
and I have a secretary. That's you.

448
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,325
And I am not scared of any of this.

449
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:25,935
But you're scared.

450
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:31,309
Oh, my God. You're scared.

451
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:37,486
Don't worry about me.

452
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:43,420
I am going to get to do everything
you want for me.

453
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:46,686
I'm going to be fine, Olive.

454
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,333
I really am.

455
00:37:57,141 --> 00:38:01,510
Your expense report is ready
for your review. It's on your desk.

456
00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:14,248
I need you to get the Dictaphone set up,

457
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:17,418
and I need a glass of water,
and then you can go.

458
00:38:20,398 --> 00:38:22,491
That's very pretty.

459
00:38:24,368 --> 00:38:25,665
Thank you.

460
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:36,403
- When are you due?
- Early September.

461
00:38:36,514 --> 00:38:38,345
You and the First Lady.

462
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:40,815
Well, I think she looks a lot better.

463
00:38:40,918 --> 00:38:42,146
You could dress like that.

464
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:44,312
Go to Lord & Taylor
and ask for my friend Bunny Appelle.

465
00:38:44,422 --> 00:38:48,222
- She'll take care of you.
- You really know everything, Joan.

466
00:38:49,894 --> 00:38:53,421
Honey, would you talk to your husband?

467
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:55,897
I don't know what I'm going to do next year.

468
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:59,067
He is going to be a tough act to follow.

469
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:02,264
Those people in Texas
will be crawling all over you.

470
00:39:02,373 --> 00:39:05,433
If I ever need a pneumonectomy,
that's the man.

471
00:39:05,543 --> 00:39:09,206
You heard me say it. Great hands.

472
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:14,507
Look, Greg, it's a complicated operation.

473
00:39:14,618 --> 00:39:16,586
Christ, that's not what I meant.

474
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:18,848
- It happens.
- What happened?

475
00:39:20,758 --> 00:39:23,556
I don't like to worry Joanie
about those kinds of things.

476
00:39:23,661 --> 00:39:27,427
Come on. Everyone gets
a bad result every once in a while.

477
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:33,861
You know what? Enough shop talk.
This is not civilian conversation.

478
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:38,137
Do you want to play charades?

479
00:39:38,242 --> 00:39:40,870
- Come on. You're terrible.
- No, I'm not.

480
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:47,142
Well, Joanie has many, many talents.
You should play for them.

481
00:39:47,251 --> 00:39:49,549
- No.
- Come on. I'll go get it.

482
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:55,691
- You're all gonna love this.
- What do you play?

483
00:39:55,793 --> 00:39:57,658
I am out of practice.

484
00:39:57,762 --> 00:40:00,925
- Come on, Joanie.
- Wonderful!

485
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:04,523
Come on, just sing a little something.

486
00:40:08,105 --> 00:40:09,970
It'll be just like the olden days.

487
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:12,065
We used to sit in the parlor after supper.

488
00:40:12,176 --> 00:40:15,077
My mother would play the piano
while we read.

489
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:24,277
Just let me have another bite
and then we can go.

490
00:41:31,088 --> 00:41:35,184
I guess we're the last ones to eat.
That's what my mother always said.

491
00:41:35,292 --> 00:41:37,157
Family holds back.

492
00:41:41,732 --> 00:41:43,632
You shouldn't be filling your plate.
You're the hostess.

493
00:41:43,734 --> 00:41:46,464
- I'll get you some food.
- Come on. Come on.

494
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:49,630
- You should sit down.
- Okay.

495
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:53,540
Oh, my God! You're pregnant.

496
00:41:53,644 --> 00:41:55,669
- You're so beautiful.
- Thank you.

497
00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:57,906
Don't you just love looking at her?

498
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,915
Aren't they a beautiful couple?

499
00:42:01,585 --> 00:42:04,179
I knew you two would get back together.

500
00:42:05,322 --> 00:42:08,655
I never had any doubt,
no matter what the problem was.

501
00:42:10,661 --> 00:42:12,492
I'll take care of her.

502
00:42:19,069 --> 00:42:20,366
You don't like me.

503
00:42:22,072 --> 00:42:23,699
I'm a nice person.

504
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:27,172
What's going on here?

505
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,813
I should've eaten something.

506
00:42:37,655 --> 00:42:41,022
Will someone please get her
a glass of milk?

507
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:43,753
Don, can I talk to you for a second?

508
00:42:49,133 --> 00:42:50,998
What the hell was that?

509
00:42:51,101 --> 00:42:52,728
Your wife's drunk.

510
00:42:57,007 --> 00:43:00,306
I don't know what I did
to get under your skin.

511
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:02,003
Roger, it's late.

512
00:43:04,648 --> 00:43:06,912
You know, my mother was right.

513
00:43:07,017 --> 00:43:12,284
It's a mistake to be conspicuously happy.
Some people don't like it.

514
00:43:12,723 --> 00:43:16,591
No one thinks you're happy.
They think you're foolish.

515
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:25,166
You know, that's the great thing
about a place like this,

516
00:43:25,636 --> 00:43:29,834
you can come here and be happy,
and you get to choose your guests.

517
00:43:51,328 --> 00:43:53,057
Good night, Grandpa.

518
00:43:53,864 --> 00:43:55,729
Get in here.

519
00:44:03,273 --> 00:44:04,501
Sit down.

520
00:44:24,695 --> 00:44:26,162
Where were we?

521
00:44:41,078 --> 00:44:46,209
"The rustic manners of a prince
who disdained such glory

522
00:44:46,316 --> 00:44:50,184
"and was insensible of such happiness

523
00:44:50,287 --> 00:44:53,814
"soon disgusted the delicacy
of his subjects,

524
00:44:54,992 --> 00:45:00,191
"and the effeminate Orientals
could neither imitate nor admire

525
00:45:00,297 --> 00:45:04,256
<i>"the severe simplicity
which Julian always maintained</i>

526
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:06,336
<i>"and sometimes affected. "</i>
