<i>Previously on
AMC's Mad Men...</i>

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:04,528
This was my father.

3
00:00:04,665 --> 00:00:06,587
My mother was a 23
year old prostitute

4
00:00:06,716 --> 00:00:08,795
who died having me.

5
00:00:09,275 --> 00:00:10,092
Lucky Strike.

6
00:00:10,316 --> 00:00:11,868
The shot of our lives.

7
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,067
- Tell me what you think.
- I think you are the client,

8
00:00:14,196 --> 00:00:15,228
you should do what you want.

9
00:00:15,442 --> 00:00:19,331
The lost of Jai Alai makes
Lucky Strike 71% of our billings.

10
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,075
You said you'd always come home.

11
00:00:21,195 --> 00:00:22,491
Did you make him leave?

12
00:00:22,595 --> 00:00:23,907
I wanna take you
in that bedroom

13
00:00:24,036 --> 00:00:26,012
and give you a go around
like you've never had.

14
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:28,237
When are you moving out?

15
00:00:28,444 --> 00:00:30,165
We haven't found the
right place for the kids.

17
00:01:11,301 --> 00:01:14,833
I'm worried that's
gonna hit the ceiling.

18
00:01:14,901 --> 00:01:16,800
We always get a tall one.

19
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:18,301
Not taller
than the living room.

20
00:01:18,368 --> 00:01:20,834
Let's go back to the other one

21
00:01:20,902 --> 00:01:22,602
And stand next to it.

22
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:28,503
Hey, Sally. Sally.

23
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,970
Hello.

24
00:01:32,038 --> 00:01:34,971
- It's Glen.
- I know that.

25
00:01:35,038 --> 00:01:37,505
Well, you all just
walked right by me
when you came in.

26
00:01:37,573 --> 00:01:39,605
Sorry.

27
00:01:39,672 --> 00:01:41,972
What are you doing back here?

28
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,773
My mom got married
and now I'm supposed
to live with him.

29
00:01:44,841 --> 00:01:48,408
I saw your new dad.
My mom said that
would happen.

30
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:52,742
After they're married awhile,
they'll have a baby.

31
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:54,443
You should probably ask
for something big now.

32
00:01:56,478 --> 00:01:58,845
Hi. Are you
getting a tree?

33
00:01:58,912 --> 00:02:00,945
No, I'm working.

34
00:02:01,013 --> 00:02:04,347
- What do you do?
- I bring twine over.

35
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:07,215
I get to cut it.

36
00:02:07,282 --> 00:02:10,115
- Wow.
- Yeah, I made it.

37
00:02:10,183 --> 00:02:12,483
Those are good colors.

38
00:02:12,551 --> 00:02:15,651
We're leaving as soon
as I find you.

39
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:19,019
- Bye, Glen.
- Maybe I'll call you.

40
00:02:29,992 --> 00:02:32,192
- Good time,
bad time?
- Yes.

41
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,294
you've got a resume

42
00:02:36,362 --> 00:02:38,195
From the girl you met
at the Ziegfeld theater.

43
00:02:38,263 --> 00:02:41,263
- File it.
- Al Weaver
at Johnson wax

44
00:02:41,331 --> 00:02:43,264
Requested another
print of glo-coat.

45
00:02:43,332 --> 00:02:47,366
And you got this
very important
piece of mail.

46
00:02:52,036 --> 00:02:53,169
Open it.

47
00:02:56,704 --> 00:03:00,205
"dear daddy,
Bobby thinks this is
going to the north pole

48
00:03:00,273 --> 00:03:03,007
But we should
keep up the roos."

49
00:03:03,074 --> 00:03:06,175
- R-double-o-s.
- Too much television.

50
00:03:06,243 --> 00:03:08,676
"Bobby says he knows
that he doesn't deserve"

51
00:03:08,744 --> 00:03:10,911
A heath Kit radio
because of what happened

52
00:03:10,978 --> 00:03:13,512
With leaving
the freezer open
in the garage

53
00:03:13,579 --> 00:03:17,981
But maybe Santa could
choose from a bicycle,
a better pellet gun,

54
00:03:18,049 --> 00:03:20,016
A clock radio,
a transistor radio,

55
00:03:20,084 --> 00:03:21,884
"A drum set
and a bicycle."

56
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:23,752
I left that freezer open.

57
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,154
"baby gene wants a fireman.

58
00:03:27,222 --> 00:03:28,555
I don't know
what that means."

59
00:03:28,623 --> 00:03:30,457
Adorable.

60
00:03:30,524 --> 00:03:32,958
"and I would like
the gold necklace"

61
00:03:33,026 --> 00:03:35,860
That you can
put your initials on
that we saw at Macy's.

62
00:03:35,928 --> 00:03:39,330
And most of all,
I'd like you to be here
on Christmas morning

63
00:03:39,397 --> 00:03:42,499
"To give it to me,
but I know you can't be."

64
00:03:47,303 --> 00:03:48,903
I'm sorry.

65
00:03:51,973 --> 00:03:55,641
So a drum set, a fire truck...

66
00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:58,277
The necklace is $30.

67
00:03:58,345 --> 00:04:01,247
It's s. B.D....
Sally Beth draper.

68
00:04:03,851 --> 00:04:06,386
and...

69
00:04:06,453 --> 00:04:09,222
Get her some Beatles 45s

70
00:04:09,289 --> 00:04:12,191
And him a transistor radio too.

71
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,761
Um, the girls went to Joan

72
00:04:15,829 --> 00:04:17,563
And I don't want
to undermine her,

73
00:04:17,631 --> 00:04:20,933
But are we allowed
to bring a friend
to the Christmas party?

74
00:04:21,001 --> 00:04:23,602
Lane scaled it back

75
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:26,405
To a glass of gin
and a box of Velveeta.

76
00:04:26,473 --> 00:04:28,107
We're tightening our belts.

77
00:04:29,542 --> 00:04:31,644
<i>But you will be
getting a bonus,</i>

78
00:04:31,712 --> 00:04:33,112
Even if I have to
see to it myself.

79
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,681
Well, thank you.

80
00:04:35,749 --> 00:04:38,484
I didn't want to have
to write a letter to Santa.

81
00:04:38,552 --> 00:04:41,587
- Do you want this?
- Sure.

82
00:04:45,991 --> 00:04:47,825
Send him in.

83
00:04:50,395 --> 00:04:52,196
ready Freddy.

84
00:04:52,264 --> 00:04:54,231
It's been too long.

85
00:04:54,299 --> 00:04:56,199
Nah, just long enough.

86
00:04:56,267 --> 00:04:58,468
You look good.
Have a seat.

87
00:04:58,536 --> 00:05:00,271
Jeez.

88
00:05:00,339 --> 00:05:02,473
It looks like
an Italian hospital in here.

89
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:04,775
I know, I know.
Jane got a decorator.

90
00:05:04,843 --> 00:05:07,945
I feel like with my hair
you can't even see me in here.

91
00:05:08,013 --> 00:05:10,181
- Something brown?
- Maybe later.

92
00:05:10,248 --> 00:05:13,250
What time is it?
Oh, look at that.

93
00:05:13,318 --> 00:05:16,554
So I thought it'd
be best if I broached
this opportunity in person.

94
00:05:16,622 --> 00:05:18,556
Well, don't be fooled
by the setup here.

95
00:05:18,623 --> 00:05:19,990
It's Potemkinville.

96
00:05:20,024 --> 00:05:22,192
Well, maybe I can help.

97
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,394
I walked out of j.W.T.

98
00:05:24,461 --> 00:05:27,296
With a present
under my arm...
pond's cold cream.

99
00:05:27,364 --> 00:05:30,265
It's $2 million,
but they'll never
even notice it's gone.

100
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,334
How the hell did you do that?

101
00:05:32,401 --> 00:05:34,569
Suffice it to say

102
00:05:34,636 --> 00:05:36,671
The client and I are
in a fraternity together.

103
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:39,773
I can't handle
the account myself,

104
00:05:39,841 --> 00:05:42,375
But I'm clean and sober now...

105
00:05:42,443 --> 00:05:44,210
16 months without a drop.

106
00:05:44,278 --> 00:05:47,846
- So when you
said "maybe later"?
- What am I gonna say?

107
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:50,949
Look, if it doesn't work out,
you can keep the account.

108
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,151
What am I gonna say?

109
00:05:53,218 --> 00:05:54,819
Yes.

110
00:05:54,886 --> 00:05:57,554
There is one little caveat.

111
00:05:57,622 --> 00:05:59,456
Name it.

112
00:05:59,524 --> 00:06:02,191
I feel like I'm getting
sucked into that thing.

113
00:06:04,528 --> 00:06:06,795
I don't want
Pete Campbell near this.

114
00:06:06,863 --> 00:06:08,730
I was surprised
you took him along.

115
00:06:11,467 --> 00:06:14,301
No comment.

116
00:06:14,369 --> 00:06:17,370
Sugarberry has been
selling hams for 30 years
at a fairly steady rate

117
00:06:17,438 --> 00:06:19,639
While doing in everything
they could to create sales,

118
00:06:19,706 --> 00:06:21,774
And then we do this in a month.

119
00:06:21,842 --> 00:06:23,442
We have to give them time
to reconcile that.

120
00:06:24,977 --> 00:06:27,245
- Freddy!
- Ballerina.

121
00:06:30,316 --> 00:06:31,783
I feel like the tin man.

122
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,851
Good to see you.

123
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:35,653
How are you, Freddy?

124
00:06:35,721 --> 00:06:37,355
Couldn't be better.

125
00:06:37,422 --> 00:06:38,823
I was just talking about you.

126
00:06:40,492 --> 00:06:42,026
Freddy here just
ran in from the yard

127
00:06:42,094 --> 00:06:44,061
With a $2-million account
in his mouth.

128
00:06:44,129 --> 00:06:46,764
- Pond's cold cream.
- Well, that explains
why you look so good.

129
00:06:50,135 --> 00:06:51,769
A little early for that,
isn't it, don?

130
00:06:51,837 --> 00:06:53,170
Very funny.

131
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:57,308
The pedigree
of this account is
that it was boosted.

132
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:00,277
And I'll need to maintain
my personal contact
to it creatively.

133
00:07:00,345 --> 00:07:02,046
If that's all right
with you, don.

134
00:07:02,113 --> 00:07:03,547
If you don't mind working
with this old thing over here.

135
00:07:03,615 --> 00:07:05,716
I was counting on it.

136
00:07:05,783 --> 00:07:08,485
- Oh, none for me.
- Oh.

137
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:14,425
- When can you bring 'em in?
- I'll be handling
this one, Pete.

138
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,796
Well, Freddy,
I hate to bring this up,

139
00:07:19,864 --> 00:07:22,666
But I do believe
it's on everyone's mind.

140
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:25,602
We all want to know
if you can be Santa
at the Christmas party.

141
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,537
It's the role
I was born to play.

142
00:07:35,613 --> 00:07:37,180
Francis residence.

143
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:39,316
Can Sally come to the phone?

144
00:07:39,384 --> 00:07:41,285
Who may I say is calling?

145
00:07:41,352 --> 00:07:44,054
Stanley. I have
a question about homework.

146
00:07:45,723 --> 00:07:48,358
Sally, there's a young man
on the phone... Stanley.

147
00:07:51,796 --> 00:07:53,765
- Hello?
- It's Glen.

148
00:07:53,832 --> 00:07:55,600
Oh, hi.

149
00:07:55,668 --> 00:07:58,235
Don't you wanna know why
I said my name is Stanley?

150
00:07:58,303 --> 00:08:00,270
I guess.

151
00:08:00,338 --> 00:08:02,706
Because this is private.

152
00:08:06,844 --> 00:08:10,047
- Where are you?
- Where do you think?

153
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:11,782
I'm down the street
at my mom's.

154
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:17,387
How come you didn't move?

155
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:19,856
I don't know.

156
00:08:19,924 --> 00:08:23,360
I hate it here.
I really really do.

157
00:08:23,427 --> 00:08:25,261
Why?

158
00:08:25,329 --> 00:08:27,063
I won't tell anybody.

159
00:08:28,932 --> 00:08:30,733
Every time I go
around a corner,

160
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,235
I keep thinking
I'll see my dad.

161
00:08:33,302 --> 00:08:35,403
Sorry.

162
00:08:35,471 --> 00:08:38,773
- They're not gonna get
back together, you know.
- Glen?

163
00:08:38,841 --> 00:08:41,442
Especially now
that she's doing it
with somebody else.

164
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:44,279
<i>- Doing what?
Glen!</i>

165
00:08:44,346 --> 00:08:45,847
Well, don't worry.

166
00:08:45,915 --> 00:08:47,949
One day they'll wake up
and they'll want to move.

167
00:08:48,017 --> 00:08:49,884
You'll see.
I've gotta go. Bye.

168
00:08:49,952 --> 00:08:51,886
Goodbye.

169
00:08:55,157 --> 00:08:58,526
- Who's Stanley?
- A boy.

170
00:09:01,164 --> 00:09:03,432
We will soon
be charging clients
for this service

171
00:09:03,499 --> 00:09:05,634
And Dr. Atherton will
in turn be charging us.

172
00:09:05,702 --> 00:09:07,336
Significantly less.

173
00:09:07,404 --> 00:09:10,704
Bert and I have
been meaning to work
together for years.

174
00:09:10,771 --> 00:09:12,572
Out in the open at least.

175
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,606
Very good then.
Shall we dim the lights?

176
00:09:14,674 --> 00:09:18,310
No, beginning the presentation
with the film is a mistake.

177
00:09:18,377 --> 00:09:21,312
Audiences will listen
to anything in anticipation.

178
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,447
See what I was talking about?

179
00:09:23,515 --> 00:09:26,650
Simply said, we believe
that at the motivational
research group,

180
00:09:26,717 --> 00:09:29,085
We have brought the science
of consumer evaluation

181
00:09:29,153 --> 00:09:32,421
To a point of precision like
that of a surgeon's scalpel.

182
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:34,556
No doubt, with the help of minds
like Dr. Faye Miller,

183
00:09:34,624 --> 00:09:38,192
With whose work you are
already unknowingly familiar.

184
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:40,961
Faye helped develop
the indelible image

185
00:09:41,029 --> 00:09:44,197
That has become
the standard of feminine
hygiene advertising...

186
00:09:44,265 --> 00:09:47,534
The carefree gal
in white pants.

187
00:09:51,138 --> 00:09:53,272
It's right up there
with the polio vaccine.

188
00:09:56,876 --> 00:09:58,443
Beyond demographic
information...

189
00:09:58,511 --> 00:10:00,478
Salary, age,
marital situation...

190
00:10:00,546 --> 00:10:02,580
We've tried to find
a way to select prospects

191
00:10:02,647 --> 00:10:04,248
Who can really provide insight.

192
00:10:04,316 --> 00:10:06,416
This test is our beginning.

193
00:10:06,484 --> 00:10:08,785
Take a minute, fill it out

194
00:10:08,852 --> 00:10:10,720
And please take a cookie.

195
00:10:10,787 --> 00:10:12,955
What's it mean if we don't?

196
00:10:13,023 --> 00:10:15,123
That you're a psychopath.

197
00:10:18,494 --> 00:10:19,560
<i>The point
of this exercise is</i>

198
00:10:19,628 --> 00:10:21,628
To familiarize you
with our methods.

199
00:10:21,696 --> 00:10:26,033
The point of the cookies
is that everyone should be
rewarded for their time.

200
00:10:27,368 --> 00:10:30,437
These questions
have been designed

201
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:32,205
To get at what
subjects really want

202
00:10:32,273 --> 00:10:34,374
<i>Instead of what
they say they do.</i>

203
00:10:34,442 --> 00:10:38,278
What are the real feelings
that exist below the surface?

204
00:10:38,345 --> 00:10:41,914
For example, "how would you
describe your father?"

205
00:10:41,982 --> 00:10:43,883
No matter what the answer,

206
00:10:43,951 --> 00:10:46,252
It creates
a level of intimacy
for the next question,

207
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,021
"who makes decisions
in your household?"

208
00:10:49,089 --> 00:10:51,457
There's some pencils
if you need them.

209
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,374
I apologize.
I have an appointment.

210
00:11:18,385 --> 00:11:20,119
That is yours to keep.

211
00:11:22,856 --> 00:11:26,325
- Is that work?
- No, it's me.
It's kind of silly.

212
00:11:26,392 --> 00:11:28,326
Tell me when
they pull the curtains
so I can get out of here.

213
00:11:28,394 --> 00:11:30,095
- Do you want ice?
- Yes.

214
00:11:41,374 --> 00:11:43,341
- What are you doing?
- Oh.

215
00:11:43,409 --> 00:11:47,078
Saint Vincent's junior staff
Christmas party.

216
00:11:47,146 --> 00:11:50,848
- At 8:00 in the morning?
- Well, the shift just ended
and we have to do it soon,

217
00:11:50,915 --> 00:11:54,417
Because Christmas
and new year's we're
overrun with suicides.

218
00:11:54,485 --> 00:11:57,887
- Well, uh...
- Phoebe.

219
00:11:57,955 --> 00:12:00,423
And you're don.
I know.

220
00:12:00,491 --> 00:12:03,861
- I hope we haven't met.
- Well, I'm right
across the hall.

221
00:12:03,929 --> 00:12:05,963
We wave to each other.

222
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:09,565
You met my friend Sarah.
She fell on the stairs.

223
00:12:09,633 --> 00:12:11,534
Maybe you weren't in uniform.

224
00:12:11,602 --> 00:12:14,404
Don't pretend that
you've never noticed me.

225
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,841
You always grunt when you put
your keys in the door.

226
00:12:18,909 --> 00:12:23,579
It's not good,
which is why I am
inviting you to my party.

227
00:12:23,647 --> 00:12:26,516
I really appreciate
the invitation, Phoebe,

228
00:12:26,584 --> 00:12:28,151
But I'm late for work.

229
00:12:28,219 --> 00:12:30,553
So you should thank me
for waking you.

230
00:12:35,226 --> 00:12:38,395
Tallulah Bankhead,
she's glamorous.

231
00:12:38,463 --> 00:12:40,731
She seems
more uncompromising
than a movie star,

232
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:42,366
You know,
because she's on Broadway.

233
00:12:42,433 --> 00:12:44,868
She never got off Broadway
because she's not
beautiful enough.

234
00:12:44,936 --> 00:12:47,270
Shame on you.
Come on.

235
00:12:47,338 --> 00:12:50,107
A little backstage
at the makeup mirror
with pond's.

236
00:12:50,174 --> 00:12:52,175
A big bouquet of roses,
opening night.

237
00:12:52,243 --> 00:12:53,910
"the choice
of professionals."

238
00:12:53,978 --> 00:12:55,912
It's good, right?

239
00:12:57,782 --> 00:13:01,317
All of their research
says that they're trying
to get young women.

240
00:13:01,385 --> 00:13:03,486
Well, young women
look up to older women.

241
00:13:03,554 --> 00:13:06,455
For beauty tips?
Are you joking?

242
00:13:06,522 --> 00:13:08,724
I know the client.
This thing is rigged.

243
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:11,728
<i>- That's what he wants.
- It's not just about
the client.</i>

244
00:13:11,796 --> 00:13:14,431
People are looking
at everything we do here.

245
00:13:14,499 --> 00:13:17,234
Have you seen our work?
It's very different than this.

246
00:13:17,302 --> 00:13:19,903
- Frederick van Rumsen!
- Von.

247
00:13:19,971 --> 00:13:22,706
boy oh boy,
were you missed at lunch.

248
00:13:22,774 --> 00:13:24,708
Cal Rutledge
from pond's.
What a cut-up.

249
00:13:24,776 --> 00:13:28,078
- What do you mean?
- I mean I've got
to go lay down.

250
00:13:35,052 --> 00:13:37,454
- I can't believe
that's his job.

251
00:13:41,425 --> 00:13:43,993
Hello. Can you tell him
Mr. Rumsen's on the phone?

252
00:13:45,362 --> 00:13:47,864
- Interrupt him.
- What's wrong?

253
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,702
Calvin, do you have
anything to tell me?

254
00:13:52,769 --> 00:13:55,137
Uh-huh.

255
00:13:55,205 --> 00:13:57,573
Did you just have lunch
with Roger sterling?

256
00:13:59,175 --> 00:14:00,409
So you have nothing to say?

257
00:14:01,678 --> 00:14:03,779
Hey hey, don't do that.

258
00:14:03,847 --> 00:14:05,547
It's okay.

259
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,817
Pull yourself together.

260
00:14:10,253 --> 00:14:13,088
First baptist church,
79th and Broadway.

261
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:18,894
- I've gotta go.
- Is everything okay?

262
00:14:18,962 --> 00:14:21,430
What, you can't put
two and two together?

263
00:14:23,266 --> 00:14:25,267
Listen, cutie,
wrap your head around

264
00:14:25,335 --> 00:14:26,835
Finding the right famous face

265
00:14:26,903 --> 00:14:28,604
Or my other thing
about the t zone.

266
00:14:28,671 --> 00:14:30,906
I want 10 tags apiece,

267
00:14:30,973 --> 00:14:32,974
Then I narrow it down
and then we go to don.

268
00:14:33,042 --> 00:14:34,910
are you serious?

269
00:14:34,977 --> 00:14:37,178
I'll do 'em too.
Don't worry.

270
00:14:37,246 --> 00:14:39,748
I'm sure yours'll be better
because you're girlier.

271
00:14:43,152 --> 00:14:45,786
<i>Lee garner Jr.</i>

272
00:14:49,124 --> 00:14:51,425
Put him through.

273
00:14:51,493 --> 00:14:53,761
<i>- Caroline, did he say
what it was about?

274
00:14:57,866 --> 00:15:00,035
Well, hello, Lee.
How's palm beach?

275
00:15:00,102 --> 00:15:02,771
Beautiful.
Heading back there
in a couple of days.

276
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:04,206
Back? Where the hell
are you?

277
00:15:04,273 --> 00:15:07,376
In town doing a little
Christmas shopping.

278
00:15:07,444 --> 00:15:09,211
Yeah, I'd love
to see you now that
I know you're in town.

279
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,746
Caroline!

280
00:15:13,349 --> 00:15:15,784
- How about dinner tomorrow?
- Christmas party.

281
00:15:15,852 --> 00:15:17,719
How about lunch?
We're having a Christmas party.

282
00:15:17,787 --> 00:15:20,255
Why am I getting
my invitation so late?

283
00:15:20,322 --> 00:15:21,990
Because I thought
you were out of town.

284
00:15:22,058 --> 00:15:24,726
Huh. Madison Avenue
office Christmas party?

285
00:15:24,794 --> 00:15:26,528
I've seen the movies.
You find me.

286
00:15:26,595 --> 00:15:29,030
Okay. 3:00?

287
00:15:29,097 --> 00:15:30,898
- No, 4:00.
- 5:00.

288
00:15:30,966 --> 00:15:31,965
Shit. Go get Lee.

289
00:15:33,635 --> 00:15:35,269
I'm looking forward to it.

290
00:15:35,337 --> 00:15:36,771
You won't be disappointed.

291
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,873
Oh.

292
00:15:43,946 --> 00:15:46,414
I just got off the phone
with Lee garner Jr.

293
00:15:46,482 --> 00:15:49,751
He's going to stop by.
We're going to have to
have a Christmas party,

294
00:15:49,819 --> 00:15:51,620
- A real one.
- How did that happen?

295
00:15:51,688 --> 00:15:53,756
It happened.
In fact, he was offended

296
00:15:53,824 --> 00:15:55,491
That we hadn't
invited him already.

297
00:15:55,559 --> 00:15:57,460
Uninvite him.

298
00:15:57,528 --> 00:16:00,030
Take him to the four seasons.
He can have three entries.

299
00:16:00,098 --> 00:16:01,965
This man doesn't care
about food.

300
00:16:04,469 --> 00:16:07,903
I know that you've
lived your life from
a bottomless pocket,

301
00:16:07,971 --> 00:16:11,640
But there's a very real
system of money coming in
versus money going out.

302
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:14,810
Overtime,
supplies being
used carelessly,

303
00:16:14,878 --> 00:16:18,414
Leaving the lights on,
parties... it adds up.

304
00:16:18,482 --> 00:16:21,117
Listen, Olivier,
aren't you the one
who's always talking about

305
00:16:21,184 --> 00:16:24,420
How lucky strike is 99%
of our business or something?

306
00:16:24,487 --> 00:16:26,889
69% if we land
pond's cold cream.

307
00:16:26,957 --> 00:16:28,957
We have pond's
and I hate the way
you say "percent,"

308
00:16:29,025 --> 00:16:31,994
- Do you know that?
- What about our other clients?

309
00:16:32,062 --> 00:16:33,962
We have no other clients.

310
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:38,400
If Lee garner Jr.
Wants three wise men
flown in from Jerusalem,

311
00:16:38,468 --> 00:16:41,169
He gets it.
Caroline!

312
00:16:41,237 --> 00:16:45,007
Get Joanie in here.
You want something?
I brought it from home.

313
00:16:49,213 --> 00:16:51,248
- Yes?
- There's been
a small adjustment

314
00:16:51,315 --> 00:16:53,417
To the scale
of our Christmas party.

315
00:16:53,485 --> 00:16:56,953
- Lower or higher?
- Lee garner Jr. Will
be joining us.

316
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:59,722
I trust you will make
the appropriate improvements.

317
00:16:59,789 --> 00:17:01,590
Well, I don't.
We need to change
its rating

318
00:17:01,658 --> 00:17:04,260
From convalescent home
to Roman orgy.

319
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:09,433
Maalox.

320
00:17:11,803 --> 00:17:14,305
I want a bartender and a tree.

321
00:17:14,372 --> 00:17:16,107
Screw him.
I love Christmas.

322
00:17:16,175 --> 00:17:18,109
You love Christmas parties.

323
00:17:18,177 --> 00:17:20,211
We're going to need
more employees,

324
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:22,847
So I'm going to allow
everyone escorts,
even the girls.

325
00:17:22,915 --> 00:17:25,183
New York food...
deli and Chinese...

326
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,018
And some kind of gift
for Mr. Garner.

327
00:17:27,086 --> 00:17:28,720
You're off-limits.

328
00:17:28,787 --> 00:17:31,155
I don't think he's the one
who needs to be reminded.

329
00:17:31,223 --> 00:17:33,024
Oh, come on.

330
00:17:33,092 --> 00:17:35,293
He was all over you
the time you wore
that red dress...

331
00:17:35,361 --> 00:17:37,696
The one with the bow
in the back that makes
you look like a present.

332
00:17:37,764 --> 00:17:40,232
- You have an incredible memory.
- Yeah, I think about it a lot...

333
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,601
That dress, I mean.

334
00:17:42,669 --> 00:17:46,005
- Could you wear it?
- Stop it.

335
00:17:46,073 --> 00:17:47,473
I didn't mean it that way.

336
00:17:49,142 --> 00:17:52,044
All I was saying was
this is the office
and that's life.

337
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:53,912
This is good

338
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,814
And that's life.

339
00:18:04,811 --> 00:18:07,212
What a nice surprise.

340
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,180
Sheila at the station
baked them.

341
00:18:09,248 --> 00:18:11,981
Sheila.
Who's Sheila?

342
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:14,884
Huh.
She's 60 years old.

343
00:18:14,951 --> 00:18:16,751
You see how shaky the icing is?

344
00:18:23,191 --> 00:18:25,826
Hey, knock it off.

345
00:18:25,894 --> 00:18:27,695
Why?
Is Rasputin home?

346
00:18:27,763 --> 00:18:29,496
Shh. She'll hear you.

347
00:18:29,564 --> 00:18:31,665
I want to lie down.
I'm tired.

348
00:18:31,732 --> 00:18:34,734
Uh-huh. My bed is
covered with work.

349
00:18:34,802 --> 00:18:38,138
- That's kind of symbolic.
- How is my face?

350
00:18:38,206 --> 00:18:41,141
Fresh, dewy, well cared for?

351
00:18:41,209 --> 00:18:42,943
Let me get a better look.

352
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:45,580
you taste like soap.

353
00:18:45,647 --> 00:18:48,618
I'm in the middle
of a seven-day beauty plan.

354
00:18:48,685 --> 00:18:50,686
can't we just

355
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:53,289
Get undressed
and lie together again?

356
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,261
That was a bad idea.

357
00:18:57,329 --> 00:19:00,098
how long is this
gonna go on?

358
00:19:00,165 --> 00:19:02,833
Oh, I'm sorry you feel
you've put in the time.

359
00:19:02,901 --> 00:19:06,370
- We're not doing anything.
- We're doing some things.

360
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:10,107
We're not doing anything
I can't do myself.

361
00:19:11,577 --> 00:19:13,245
Mark.

362
00:19:13,313 --> 00:19:15,514
I told you I want you.

363
00:19:15,581 --> 00:19:18,784
In fact I want you
so much I wanna wait.

364
00:19:18,852 --> 00:19:21,988
And I told you there's
nothing to be afraid of.

365
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:25,492
I want to be your first.

366
00:19:31,467 --> 00:19:33,501
You're so old-fashioned.

367
00:19:33,569 --> 00:19:35,170
No, I'm not.

368
00:19:36,506 --> 00:19:39,008
In Sweden, they make love

369
00:19:39,076 --> 00:19:41,011
The minute they feel attracted.

370
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:43,080
And it's healthier,
because you can find,

371
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:45,784
You know, the perfect person.

372
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,693
Because making love is
a very important part
of a life with someone.

373
00:19:49,963 --> 00:19:53,743
The most important.
In Sweden, anyway.

374
00:19:53,811 --> 00:19:55,980
Where did you hear that?

375
00:19:56,048 --> 00:19:58,216
I read this article,
"the Swedish way of love."

376
00:19:58,284 --> 00:20:00,485
It's very enlightened.

377
00:20:00,553 --> 00:20:03,322
You're never going
to get me to do anything
Swedish people do.

378
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:06,125
All you have
to do is take a couple
of steps that way.

379
00:20:08,262 --> 00:20:10,130
- I brought you cookies.
- Huh.

380
00:20:13,702 --> 00:20:15,336
I think you should go home.

381
00:20:28,053 --> 00:20:29,854
<i>And I want you
to think about that.</i>

382
00:20:43,601 --> 00:20:45,735
Sorry.
Everybody leaves

383
00:20:45,803 --> 00:20:47,404
The moment
you have to clean up.

384
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,242
I might have a vacuum.

385
00:20:58,049 --> 00:21:01,218
where the hell are
you coming from?

386
00:21:01,285 --> 00:21:04,155
- Work.
- Where do you work?

387
00:21:04,223 --> 00:21:05,824
The white horse tavern?

388
00:21:08,497 --> 00:21:10,666
Did you have
a party or something?

389
00:21:10,733 --> 00:21:14,370
- I hate parties.
- And you hate Christmas.

390
00:21:14,438 --> 00:21:17,478
- I got it.
- I don't hate Christmas.

391
00:21:17,546 --> 00:21:19,579
I hate this Christmas.

392
00:21:27,151 --> 00:21:28,785
Of course you have heat.

393
00:21:32,387 --> 00:21:33,920
Can I get you something?

394
00:21:35,221 --> 00:21:38,889
Come on.
You're going to bed.

395
00:21:42,356 --> 00:21:44,489
Look where we are.

396
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:49,089
- You're good with that.
- My father was a drunk.

397
00:21:52,025 --> 00:21:53,825
If you don't behave yourself,

398
00:21:53,892 --> 00:21:55,391
I'm not gonna take
your shoes off

399
00:21:55,459 --> 00:21:57,525
And you're gonna wake up
with sores on your heels.

400
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:03,827
How can you stand going
to a hospital every day?

401
00:22:03,895 --> 00:22:05,928
I love working
at the hospital...

402
00:22:07,362 --> 00:22:08,962
People coming into the world,

403
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,397
People leaving it.

404
00:22:10,465 --> 00:22:12,366
Everything happens there.

405
00:22:16,804 --> 00:22:18,537
good night, don.

406
00:22:21,107 --> 00:22:22,374
good night!

407
00:22:30,114 --> 00:22:32,782
Against the wall,
please. Megan.

408
00:22:35,786 --> 00:22:38,387
The bar looks good.
I need you to get

409
00:22:38,454 --> 00:22:40,287
The chafing dishes
and the sternos.

410
00:22:40,354 --> 00:22:42,985
Then call Peking house
and move the delivery
from 4:00 to 3:30.

411
00:22:43,053 --> 00:22:44,952
- They're always late.
- Yes, Joan.

412
00:22:45,019 --> 00:22:48,887
that one.

413
00:22:48,954 --> 00:22:52,616
On the short list I've got
Tallulah, Jessica Tandy,

414
00:22:52,684 --> 00:22:54,747
Barbara Stanwyck and Doris day.

415
00:22:54,815 --> 00:22:58,577
- Different types.
- I don't even understand
your list.

416
00:22:58,644 --> 00:23:01,342
What's wrong
with Elizabeth Taylor?

417
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:03,911
Isn't it about making
old ladies look good?

418
00:23:03,979 --> 00:23:05,746
Nothing makes
old ladies look good.

419
00:23:05,814 --> 00:23:08,582
But pond's does.
That's the point.

420
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:10,550
If young girls
started using it,

421
00:23:10,618 --> 00:23:13,186
Maybe they'd find a husband
and they wouldn't be so angry.

422
00:23:15,155 --> 00:23:18,757
All I was trying to say
is that I've used the stuff

423
00:23:18,824 --> 00:23:21,525
And I think
there's something
about the experience

424
00:23:21,593 --> 00:23:23,827
Of putting it on
and looking in the mirror.

425
00:23:23,895 --> 00:23:26,863
If we were
to go another way,
that's not a bad idea.

426
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:29,264
Indulging yourself, right?

427
00:23:29,332 --> 00:23:31,500
No, if you use pond's,
you'll get married.

428
00:23:33,135 --> 00:23:34,569
That's not what I was saying.

429
00:23:34,636 --> 00:23:35,936
Or we could go the other way.

430
00:23:36,004 --> 00:23:38,505
If you don't use it,
then you'll never get married.

431
00:23:39,774 --> 00:23:41,440
Which is better?

432
00:23:41,508 --> 00:23:43,042
You know what?
Just write 'em down.

433
00:23:43,109 --> 00:23:44,943
No, I'm not writing that down.

434
00:23:46,312 --> 00:23:49,013
I'm sorry if I hit
a nerve there, precious.

435
00:23:49,081 --> 00:23:52,249
You know, Freddy, I have
brought your name up 100 times

436
00:23:52,317 --> 00:23:55,719
In the last year to come in
and freelance, for me,

437
00:23:55,786 --> 00:23:58,387
But everybody is
right about you.

438
00:23:58,455 --> 00:24:02,323
You and your grand dames,
your portable typewriter

439
00:24:02,391 --> 00:24:04,558
And your desperate spinsters...

440
00:24:04,626 --> 00:24:06,126
You're old-fashioned.
You know that?

441
00:24:09,663 --> 00:24:11,297
<i>- Miss Olson?
- Yes?</i>

442
00:24:11,365 --> 00:24:13,565
<i>Everybody's leaving
to get dressed
for the party.</i>

443
00:24:13,633 --> 00:24:15,801
<i>- Do you need me right now?
- No, you can go.</i>

444
00:24:20,305 --> 00:24:22,339
I... I'm...

445
00:24:22,407 --> 00:24:24,608
I'm sorry, Freddy.

446
00:24:24,675 --> 00:24:26,242
Don't worry about it.

447
00:24:27,511 --> 00:24:29,044
Is Violet coming?

448
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:31,946
She wouldn't miss it.

449
00:25:15,708 --> 00:25:15,774
<i>- Oh, thank you, dear.
You know Peter.</i>

450
00:25:18,377 --> 00:25:20,509
He'd rather spend
every waking second
right here in the city.

451
00:25:20,577 --> 00:25:23,710
Who'd want to miss Christmas
in New York? 5th Avenue...

452
00:25:23,778 --> 00:25:25,945
Chestnuts roasting
on a greasy man's
open street cart.

453
00:25:26,013 --> 00:25:28,014
My goodness.

454
00:25:28,082 --> 00:25:30,583
We're going to
the Bahamas and there's
nothing else to it.

455
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:32,784
Harry spent so much time
in Los Angeles,

456
00:25:32,852 --> 00:25:34,986
- I figured I'd treat him
to the mountains.
- Stowe.

457
00:25:36,689 --> 00:25:38,422
What about you, don?
Do you have any plans?

458
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:40,992
Yes, heading to Acapulco.

459
00:25:41,059 --> 00:25:44,628
- Are you taking
anyone special?
- No.

460
00:25:44,695 --> 00:25:47,597
- Well, it's your own fault.
- Yes, I pity him,

461
00:25:47,664 --> 00:25:49,765
Marooned in
that sea of bikinis.

462
00:25:49,833 --> 00:25:52,034
<i>- merry Christmas.</i>

463
00:25:53,436 --> 00:25:55,537
- Nice to see you again.
- And you as well, sir.

464
00:25:55,605 --> 00:25:57,271
- Don.
- Okay. Don.

465
00:26:00,042 --> 00:26:02,242
We're going to get
something to drink.

466
00:26:05,579 --> 00:26:07,280
Where the hell is he?

467
00:26:09,349 --> 00:26:11,283
They are children,

468
00:26:11,351 --> 00:26:12,918
And they can't accept the fact

469
00:26:12,986 --> 00:26:15,187
That others have to make
decisions for them.

470
00:26:15,254 --> 00:26:18,556
<i>So we are not part
of this herd you're
talking about.</i>

471
00:26:18,624 --> 00:26:20,725
you're from Great Britain.

472
00:26:20,793 --> 00:26:23,661
I'd think you'd be
familiar with the perils
of socialism.

473
00:26:23,729 --> 00:26:26,831
Civil rights is the beginning

474
00:26:26,899 --> 00:26:28,733
<i>Of a slippery slope.</i>

475
00:26:28,801 --> 00:26:30,402
If they pass Medicare,

476
00:26:30,469 --> 00:26:33,904
They won't stop until
they ban personal property.

477
00:26:33,972 --> 00:26:36,907
Storm our houses
and rape our wives.

478
00:26:36,974 --> 00:26:40,076
Mmm. Mmm.

479
00:26:40,144 --> 00:26:42,144
Man your battle stations!

480
00:26:43,847 --> 00:26:46,015
Nice dress.
Where's Mr. Holloway?

481
00:26:46,083 --> 00:26:47,717
Saving lives.

482
00:26:47,785 --> 00:26:49,853
Everyone, ladies,
come on, let's go.

483
00:26:54,358 --> 00:26:56,259
Don't forget it's a party.

484
00:27:11,342 --> 00:27:13,509
Please please.

485
00:27:13,577 --> 00:27:16,145
I walked in here
five minutes ago,
no one did anything.

486
00:27:16,213 --> 00:27:18,948
Merry Christmas, Lee.
That's quite a tan.

487
00:27:19,016 --> 00:27:21,884
I work at it.
When can we expepe
something for lucky strike

488
00:27:21,952 --> 00:27:23,452
As good
as "let me out of here!"

489
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:26,521
Well, glo-coat told me
to swing for the fences.

490
00:27:26,588 --> 00:27:28,990
Well, I didn't know
I had to ask, Donny.

491
00:27:29,058 --> 00:27:31,460
We have gifts, girls and games,

492
00:27:31,527 --> 00:27:33,061
But first I'm going
to get you some food.

493
00:27:33,129 --> 00:27:34,362
Well, that's a good idea, red.

494
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:36,031
I've been drinking all day.

495
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:50,977
Don't turn
on the lights, shithead.

496
00:28:03,058 --> 00:28:04,626
Come on.

497
00:28:32,123 --> 00:28:35,325
If you hear anything, run.
Don't worry about me.

498
00:29:06,485 --> 00:29:08,220
Whoo!

499
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:10,590
Megan, can you get
Mr. Garner a drink?

500
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:14,894
- Where's Santa?
- He didn't show,

501
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:16,897
But he did leave some presents.

502
00:29:16,965 --> 00:29:19,568
- Joan.
- Well, I could've sworn

503
00:29:19,636 --> 00:29:21,506
I conga'ed by a suit.

504
00:29:21,574 --> 00:29:23,808
- You want to be Santa?
- Hell no.

505
00:29:25,144 --> 00:29:26,711
How about you, Roger?

506
00:29:26,779 --> 00:29:29,447
I would but I'm
allergic to velvet.

507
00:29:29,515 --> 00:29:31,349
come on. You'll do great.

508
00:29:31,417 --> 00:29:33,384
- Are you serious?
- Damn straight.

509
00:29:33,452 --> 00:29:36,087
I don't think so.

510
00:29:37,522 --> 00:29:39,924
I'll do it.
I'd love to be Santa.

511
00:29:39,991 --> 00:29:41,358
- Yes.
- Oh, come on.

512
00:29:41,426 --> 00:29:43,594
It'd take three of you
to fill that suit.

513
00:29:43,662 --> 00:29:46,163
Besides, everybody knows
Santa's got white hair.

514
00:29:46,231 --> 00:29:48,198
Put it on, Roger.

515
00:29:49,634 --> 00:29:51,468
Come on, Lee.

516
00:29:51,536 --> 00:29:53,237
Put it on.

517
00:30:06,918 --> 00:30:08,985
He's a hell of a sport.

518
00:30:19,196 --> 00:30:21,030
everybody just stay there.

519
00:30:24,468 --> 00:30:27,970
- Call the police.
- Is somebody in the house?

520
00:30:28,038 --> 00:30:29,639
Maybe it's a bear.

521
00:30:31,175 --> 00:30:32,508
Hello?

522
00:30:34,044 --> 00:30:35,978
I'm guessing it's kids.

523
00:30:37,648 --> 00:30:39,682
Let me look around the house.

524
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:42,385
- Hello?
- Just stay here.

525
00:30:45,055 --> 00:30:46,589
Where's your lovely wife, lane?

526
00:30:46,657 --> 00:30:49,091
She and my son are in London.

527
00:30:49,159 --> 00:30:50,859
I shall be
joining them soon enough.

528
00:30:50,927 --> 00:30:54,763
Mine's in Florida.
I guess we'll suffer
through, eh, Jeeves?

529
00:30:54,831 --> 00:30:57,199
<i>- Mmm.
Ho ho ho!</i>

530
00:30:57,267 --> 00:31:00,169
Merry Christmas!

531
00:31:02,939 --> 00:31:05,875
It's hard to tell
if he's father Christmas
or father time.

532
00:31:05,942 --> 00:31:08,576
Merry Christmas!

533
00:31:08,643 --> 00:31:10,344
That's a big bag, Roger.

534
00:31:10,411 --> 00:31:13,213
Don't want you to have
a third heart attack.

535
00:31:13,281 --> 00:31:14,815
Right, honey?

536
00:31:16,785 --> 00:31:18,719
What have we here?

537
00:31:18,786 --> 00:31:22,022
What do all
the good boys and girls
want for Christmas?

538
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:24,825
- Lucky strike!
thank you.

539
00:31:24,893 --> 00:31:27,661
You're welcome.
Don't smoke those
all at once.

540
00:31:28,996 --> 00:31:31,798
And I have
a very special present

541
00:31:31,866 --> 00:31:35,435
For a little boy who knows
he's been naughty.

542
00:31:35,503 --> 00:31:36,569
Lee.

543
00:31:39,507 --> 00:31:41,174
You didn't need to do that.

544
00:31:41,242 --> 00:31:43,109
Yes, we did.

545
00:31:49,483 --> 00:31:51,818
Look at that.

546
00:31:51,886 --> 00:31:53,153
It's a Polaroid.

547
00:31:55,022 --> 00:31:56,823
Thank you.

548
00:31:56,891 --> 00:31:58,892
It reminds me
of when I was a kid.

549
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,927
Remember that?

550
00:32:00,995 --> 00:32:02,729
You'd ask for something,
you'd get it

551
00:32:02,797 --> 00:32:04,965
And it made you happy.

552
00:32:05,032 --> 00:32:09,102
merry Christmas!

553
00:32:11,806 --> 00:32:13,974
- Merry Christmas, sweetheart.
- Merry Christmas, don.

554
00:32:17,044 --> 00:32:18,712
<i>Ho ho ho!</i>

555
00:32:20,081 --> 00:32:22,282
<i>There's eggs in my bed!</i>

556
00:32:24,251 --> 00:32:25,985
You can sleep
in our room if you want.

557
00:32:27,321 --> 00:32:28,888
My room's fine.

558
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:49,663
- Anybody home?
- Not for much longer.

559
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:52,666
I can't leave until
Geoff and Bert Cooper

560
00:32:52,733 --> 00:32:54,734
Figure out how to take
food from children.

561
00:32:54,802 --> 00:32:56,503
Well, if anyone can do it...

562
00:32:58,205 --> 00:33:00,506
How many Christmas parties
do you have to go to?

563
00:33:03,711 --> 00:33:06,946
I pity you.
Please, sit down.

564
00:33:07,014 --> 00:33:11,084
No, I just want
to make sure there
were no problems.

565
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,986
You really are
a full-service company.

566
00:33:15,054 --> 00:33:16,421
It's just
you didn't take the test

567
00:33:16,488 --> 00:33:17,989
And I know you're
the creative shaman
around here,

568
00:33:18,057 --> 00:33:19,791
But you walked out
of my presentation.

569
00:33:22,263 --> 00:33:24,197
I'm disappointed.

570
00:33:24,265 --> 00:33:26,667
I thought you
came in to flirt,
but you came in to fight.

571
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:31,772
You have to know I found out
all I could about you.

572
00:33:33,141 --> 00:33:34,708
Your work is very interesting

573
00:33:34,776 --> 00:33:37,177
And I guess I was hoping
you thought mine was.

574
00:33:37,245 --> 00:33:39,212
It's not personal.
I just don't think

575
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,948
You can learn much
about people that way.

576
00:33:41,015 --> 00:33:43,016
I learned a lot about you.

577
00:33:43,084 --> 00:33:45,685
You're the kind
of man who doesn't want
to take the test.

578
00:33:47,588 --> 00:33:49,723
I'm sorry.
I just don't see

579
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:52,425
How knowing about
my childhood is gonna
help sell floor wax.

580
00:33:52,493 --> 00:33:54,460
I saw that ad.

581
00:33:54,528 --> 00:33:56,429
It's all about
somebody's childhood.

582
00:33:58,331 --> 00:34:00,566
Look, we're both
in the same business.

583
00:34:00,634 --> 00:34:02,935
I'm not embarrassed to say

584
00:34:03,003 --> 00:34:06,507
It's about helping people
somehow to sort out their
deepest conflict.

585
00:34:06,575 --> 00:34:08,209
And what is that?

586
00:34:08,277 --> 00:34:10,378
In a nutshell,

587
00:34:10,446 --> 00:34:14,014
It all comes down to
"what I want" versus
"what's expected of me."

588
00:34:18,753 --> 00:34:21,556
- That's true.
- I know it's true.

589
00:34:21,623 --> 00:34:24,192
You would've known
it's true if you'd
stayed for my presentation.

590
00:34:28,263 --> 00:34:30,397
Want to get some dinner
or something?

591
00:34:32,133 --> 00:34:33,967
No thank you.

592
00:34:34,035 --> 00:34:35,402
But apology accepted.

593
00:34:38,039 --> 00:34:41,608
Look, I know the holidays
are hard in your situation,

594
00:34:41,676 --> 00:34:44,944
But don't worry.
You'll be married
again in a year.

595
00:34:45,012 --> 00:34:46,713
What?

596
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,914
I'm sorry.

597
00:34:48,982 --> 00:34:52,183
I always forget...
nobody wants to think
they're a type.

598
00:34:53,552 --> 00:34:54,819
Merry Christmas.

599
00:34:54,887 --> 00:34:57,221
Merry Christmas.

600
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:03,627
Harry.
Your turn.

601
00:35:06,865 --> 00:35:08,532
sorry sorry sorry.

602
00:35:34,735 --> 00:35:36,435
Shit.

603
00:35:55,025 --> 00:35:57,560
I don't see anything.

604
00:35:57,628 --> 00:35:59,162
Oh.
Here they are.

605
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:02,164
- I got 'em.
- Great.

606
00:36:02,232 --> 00:36:03,796
<i>Be right there.

607
00:36:08,892 --> 00:36:11,457
- Forgot his keys.
- I'll give you
a half an hour

608
00:36:11,525 --> 00:36:13,691
- And then we'll meet
you at Chumley's.
- Make it an hour.

609
00:36:13,758 --> 00:36:16,259
- Might have to get
some food in him.
- He's pathetic.

610
00:36:25,467 --> 00:36:27,301
Hello?

611
00:36:30,537 --> 00:36:32,571
- I'm really sorry.
- It's okay.

612
00:36:34,841 --> 00:36:36,975
Switched my plans a little bit.

613
00:36:43,682 --> 00:36:46,149
I'm getting you aspirin.
Don't say no.

614
00:36:48,185 --> 00:36:49,852
Top right cabinet.

615
00:36:54,624 --> 00:36:57,292
<i>- How about some food?
- No.</i>

616
00:37:21,248 --> 00:37:24,017
- Thank you.
- Okay.

617
00:37:24,084 --> 00:37:25,885
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

618
00:37:37,297 --> 00:37:39,165
Don't.

619
00:37:40,734 --> 00:37:42,568
Don't what?

620
00:38:01,221 --> 00:38:02,754
You smell so good.

621
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:04,356
I feel dizzy.

622
00:38:53,671 --> 00:38:54,571
My goodness.

623
00:38:57,208 --> 00:38:58,709
I know.

624
00:39:09,654 --> 00:39:11,521
Oh! I'm supposed
to meet somebody.

625
00:39:13,256 --> 00:39:15,490
Oh.

626
00:39:19,828 --> 00:39:21,395
I should really go.

627
00:39:24,432 --> 00:39:26,066
You sure?

628
00:39:26,134 --> 00:39:27,001
Yes.

629
00:39:50,822 --> 00:39:52,623
I, uh...

630
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:57,193
I understand.
It's okay.

631
00:39:59,062 --> 00:40:00,463
Okay.

632
00:40:02,201 --> 00:40:04,774
See you tomorrow, I guess.

633
00:40:41,732 --> 00:40:43,032
Freddy.

634
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:45,435
I'm sorry I'm at your desk.

635
00:40:45,503 --> 00:40:47,137
It was the cleanest spot
in the office.

636
00:40:49,341 --> 00:40:52,743
Are you okay?
You didn't come
to the party.

637
00:40:52,811 --> 00:40:55,546
Oh.

638
00:40:55,614 --> 00:40:58,282
It's been my experience

639
00:40:58,350 --> 00:40:59,784
That when they give you
that Santa suit,

640
00:40:59,852 --> 00:41:02,387
There's usually a bottle
already in the pocket.

641
00:41:02,455 --> 00:41:04,557
Oh.

642
00:41:04,624 --> 00:41:06,525
thank God.

643
00:41:06,593 --> 00:41:08,995
I don't want to worry
that every time I hurt
your feelings

644
00:41:09,062 --> 00:41:11,698
You're gonna
start drinking again.

645
00:41:11,765 --> 00:41:14,067
Then why don't you stop
hurting my feelings?

646
00:41:19,774 --> 00:41:21,808
I'm sorry.

647
00:41:21,876 --> 00:41:24,477
I'm sorry I said
you were old-fashioned.

648
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,914
And I'm sorry I said
you wanted to get married.

649
00:41:32,818 --> 00:41:34,485
<i>I do want to get married.</i>

650
00:41:34,553 --> 00:41:37,488
Well, you've got to work less
and find somebody.

651
00:41:37,556 --> 00:41:39,958
I have a boyfriend.

652
00:41:40,025 --> 00:41:41,826
Is it serious?

653
00:41:41,894 --> 00:41:43,829
I don't know yet.

654
00:41:45,065 --> 00:41:46,766
He won't leave me alone.

655
00:41:46,833 --> 00:41:50,336
It was that way with Violet.

656
00:41:50,404 --> 00:41:52,338
Insatiable.

657
00:41:52,406 --> 00:41:54,140
Oh.

658
00:41:54,208 --> 00:41:57,180
Oh.
Freddy, I don't want
to talk about this.

659
00:41:57,248 --> 00:41:59,315
Hey, you brought it up.

660
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:03,653
I haven't done
much work on this,
I have to be honest.

661
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,755
I need to get some coffee.

662
00:42:05,823 --> 00:42:07,692
Fine.

663
00:42:15,437 --> 00:42:16,971
I don't want to be alone
on new year's eve.

664
00:42:20,443 --> 00:42:23,314
My two cents?

665
00:42:23,381 --> 00:42:25,480
If you're gonna marry him,
you can't do anything.

666
00:42:25,548 --> 00:42:27,212
He won't respect you.

667
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,444
What if I don't know?

668
00:42:30,512 --> 00:42:33,042
Well, you can't lead him on.

669
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:35,175
That is physically
very uncomfortable.

670
00:42:35,243 --> 00:42:36,941
It's not a joke.

671
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:58,992
did you enjoy the
fuhrer's birthday?

672
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:00,594
may he live for
a thousand years.

673
00:43:03,265 --> 00:43:05,766
Oh, my father used to say
this is the greatest job
in the world

674
00:43:05,834 --> 00:43:07,768
Except for one thing...
the clients.

675
00:43:17,578 --> 00:43:20,546
Good morning.

676
00:43:20,613 --> 00:43:21,679
Did you make it home
last night?

677
00:43:21,747 --> 00:43:24,213
I did.
I did.

678
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,846
Come inside.

679
00:43:32,048 --> 00:43:34,282
- What's all this?
- For your children.

680
00:43:34,349 --> 00:43:35,850
I bought them the other day,

681
00:43:35,917 --> 00:43:37,518
But I finally got them wrapped.

682
00:43:38,786 --> 00:43:40,086
Thank you.

683
00:43:40,154 --> 00:43:41,888
Want me to get the door?

684
00:43:41,955 --> 00:43:43,656
No.

685
00:43:43,724 --> 00:43:46,091
Do you need some coffee?

686
00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:47,926
I had some.

687
00:43:47,993 --> 00:43:49,693
It was quite a party.

688
00:43:51,296 --> 00:43:53,930
- I really overdid it.
- Me too.

689
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,500
I, uh...

690
00:44:02,703 --> 00:44:04,603
Thank you for bringing my keys.

691
00:44:04,671 --> 00:44:07,606
I really appreciate it.

692
00:44:07,674 --> 00:44:09,508
I've probably
taken advantage
of your kindness

693
00:44:09,576 --> 00:44:11,577
On too many occasions.

694
00:44:13,046 --> 00:44:15,048
Excuse me?

695
00:44:17,585 --> 00:44:19,720
I just wanted
to say thank you
for bringing my keys.

696
00:44:23,592 --> 00:44:25,527
Okay.

697
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:31,867
I know we talked about
how tough things are
for the firm,

698
00:44:33,802 --> 00:44:36,404
But I wanted you to know...

699
00:44:39,674 --> 00:44:43,042
Well, here's the bonus
we talked about.

700
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:48,446
Merry Christmas.

701
00:44:51,383 --> 00:44:52,816
Thank you.

702
00:44:56,187 --> 00:44:58,221
Anything else for right now?

703
00:44:58,288 --> 00:44:59,855
No.

704
00:46:08,227 --> 00:46:09,527
Hey.

705
00:46:12,297 --> 00:46:14,798
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, of course.

706
00:46:16,834 --> 00:46:18,668
