1
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:41,302
But when the flesh
lusts against the spirit

2
00:00:41,408 --> 00:00:43,399
and the spirit against the flesh,

3
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:47,446
the rational soul is supported
by the cross of Christ.

4
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:51,540
Nor does it, when seduced
by evil desires,

5
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:53,516
consent to evil doings,

6
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:57,021
for it is pierced
by the nails of continence

7
00:00:57,123 --> 00:00:58,647
and the fear of God.

8
00:00:58,758 --> 00:01:02,524
And, as at all times,
we must live worthily,

9
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:05,530
so at all times we must bear the cross,

10
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:08,362
which for each one
is rightly called his,

11
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:10,333
for it is born by each one...

12
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:11,995
I'm not feeling so good.

13
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:13,902
That's because you're hung over.

14
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:16,066
I can smell it.

15
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:17,541
We have supper.

16
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:19,703
She's been fasting all day.
I need your help.

17
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:22,171
And as a rule,

18
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:24,011
there is a greater danger
in the hidden betrayer

19
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:25,709
than in the open foe.

20
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:31,048
Is there a draft? I'll close it.

21
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:32,818
No, Father.

22
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,587
Are you with one of these two?

23
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:37,686
No.

24
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:40,430
Okay, turn around.

25
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:43,868
If you see me again
and I'm not smiling,

26
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,437
I don't think you're gonna like it.

27
00:01:46,806 --> 00:01:48,103
Now get back in there.

28
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:56,515
Are you leaving?

29
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:59,346
Just to get some air.

30
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:01,443
You don't have to be polite.

31
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:05,046
I'm sorry. I didn't want
to lie to you in here.

32
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:06,284
I'm Father Gill.

33
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:07,290
I'm Peggy Olson.

34
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:09,384
- Katherine Olson's girl.
- Yes.

35
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:11,191
Yes, I'm having dinner at your sister's.

36
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:13,288
Are you a new priest?

37
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:15,492
I'm visiting.

38
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:19,797
So are you gonna come back in?

39
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,807
Yes.

40
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:38,791
Hello.

41
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:42,691
Good morning, Caroline.

42
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:45,828
Yes.

43
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:48,230
We're up.

44
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,859
Barbecue.

45
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:52,369
Right.

46
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:54,599
Caroline, we went over this.

47
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:56,004
Steaks.

48
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:57,804
And the kids can eat hot dogs.

49
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,403
Cancel.

50
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:01,980
I'm sorry. What?

51
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:06,252
I don't know.

52
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:08,377
Jell-O?

53
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:10,956
Do you want me to pick
something else up?

54
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:13,025
Cancel.

55
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:15,321
Caroline, hold on a sec.

56
00:03:15,428 --> 00:03:17,123
I can't.

57
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:29,063
Caroline, I feel terrible about this,
but Don's not feeling well.

58
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:32,042
No. I'm sorry.

59
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,180
The 22nd?

60
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,183
Isn't that Easter?

61
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:39,748
Good.

62
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:41,410
Bye-bye.

63
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:45,391
What's with you?

64
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:48,187
I don't know.

65
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:50,125
I had an amazing dream.

66
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:01,436
You're always hogging the TV!

67
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:02,803
I don't like baby stuff.

68
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,309
Get out. We're... sleeping.

69
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,379
Get some Raisin Bran.

70
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,539
You can eat it in the den.

71
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:11,446
Out!

72
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:14,018
Out!

73
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:20,416
I should have locked the door.

74
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:41,843
Here's number 2, sir.

75
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,142
Thank you, Jeeves.

76
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:47,047
Why are we in the living room?

77
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:49,018
Because we live here.

78
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,559
What did I say about the stereo?

79
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:57,596
I wasn't touching it.

80
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,600
Bobby, I saw you do it.

81
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:04,226
- I didn't do it.
- Go watch TV, both of you.

82
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:14,813
I love this song.

83
00:05:16,382 --> 00:05:18,543
His voice is like silk,

84
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,278
and you can really hear the words.

85
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:24,416
He makes everything
sound like Christmas.

86
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:30,290
In high school, I used to
love dancing to this song.

87
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:33,524
Come dance with me.

88
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:35,897
I thought we weren't
doing anything today.

89
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,435
Hurry. It's almost over.

90
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:48,778
I hate to think about your
reputation in high school.

91
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:03,653
Are you going to sit at the table?

92
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:06,931
Gerry, could you get it?

93
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,398
Jesus, Anita, I can't move.

94
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:09,763
Watch your language!

95
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,598
And I don't care if you have to lay there.

96
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,934
- Put your shoes on!
- Little Gerry, get my shoes!

97
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,598
Do you want me to get the door?

98
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,539
I can't reach my toes.
What am I supposed to do?

99
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,410
Hello, Father.

100
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:25,984
You're not leaving, are you?

101
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:28,747
Hello, Father. I'm sorry I'm late.

102
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:32,086
I went by Green-Wood to visit my son.

103
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:34,523
Well, I would love to meet him.

104
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:36,788
It's a cemetery.

105
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,921
Father, welcome.

106
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:42,296
Come, before it gets cold.

107
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,994
Hello, Father.

108
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:45,968
I'm sorry I missed Mass. My back is out.

109
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,404
He hasn't been feeling well,
but he did his part.

110
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:49,907
He watched the baby.

111
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:52,443
Well, I hope you feel better soon.

112
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:54,035
We all do.

113
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:55,944
I'm sorry. I gotta lay down.

114
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:58,039
Oh, please, please.

115
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:00,776
Oh, come.

116
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:02,149
Of course, Father.

117
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,381
Right this way.

118
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:05,480
We have you here.

119
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:08,685
Gerard! Mikey! Wash your hands!

120
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:11,525
They've disappeared.

121
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:13,599
Don't wait for them.

122
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:19,560
Father, would you
honor us and say grace?

123
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:21,139
Certainly. Why not?

124
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:26,135
O Lord, thank you
for this wonderful feast.

125
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:27,644
Thank you for these people

126
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:31,342
and this parish and their home.

127
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:36,151
That was beautiful.

128
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:38,120
Are you gonna say grace now?

129
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:43,957
Bless us, O Lord, and these thy gifts

130
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:45,724
we are about to receive from thy bounty,

131
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:48,494
and make us ever mindful
of the needs of others.

132
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:49,795
Through Christ our Lord.

133
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:51,563
Amen.

134
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:54,532
Okay.

135
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:08,352
Monsignor says you have
a beautiful singing voice.

136
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:09,887
And you play the harmonica?

137
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,354
The guitar.

138
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:13,288
I actually learned
how to play the mandolin

139
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:14,381
when I was in Rome.

140
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,426
And soccer.

141
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:17,462
Did you meet the Holy Father?

142
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:18,723
Not exactly.

143
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,662
It's kind of like being in Washington

144
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:23,234
and asking if you've met the president.

145
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,894
But you know
when he's in the building.

146
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,166
Aren't you gonna have one?

147
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:30,469
Should I?

148
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:32,601
Well, I'm not gonna drink by myself.

149
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:34,703
I'll get the sherry.

150
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:35,974
I'll get it, Ma.

151
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:38,312
I've always wanted to go to Rome.

152
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:41,409
Ah, yes, well,
Vatican City is one thing,

153
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,718
but then you realize you're in Italy.

154
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:46,257
Peggy works in Manhattan.

155
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,190
Oh, really?

156
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:49,261
What do you do, Peggy?

157
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,091
She works on Madison Avenue.

158
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,893
She comes up with the words
in advertisements.

159
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,491
They call it copywriting, Ma.

160
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:57,830
Father, I'm glad you're here.

161
00:08:57,937 --> 00:08:59,564
I didn't know they knew what I did.

162
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:02,072
Stop it. No, you should see her work.

163
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:05,166
Lipstick, reducing programs,
feminine products.

164
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:07,178
Mom, not in front of Father.

165
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,578
She used to do her presentations for us.

166
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:10,808
She uses Latin.

167
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:15,753
I'm sorry to do this,
but I really should go.

168
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:17,015
Look at that.

169
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:18,784
Well, where are you headed?

170
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:20,415
I'll give you a lift. I have a car.

171
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:23,927
- To the Fourth Avenue BMT.
- Okay.

172
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,464
It is such an honor
to have you in our house.

173
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,329
And I'm sorry the chicken
was overcooked.

174
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:30,902
The chicken was perfect,
and you know that.

175
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,129
Go get the Brownie.

176
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,831
Let me wrap up some cake.

177
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:37,774
Thank you, but no, thank you, Anita.

178
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:40,141
You've all really made me homesick.

179
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,510
Father, would you mind?

180
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:51,888
Say "cheese."

181
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:53,982
- Cheese.
- Cheese.

182
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:07,028
Brooks, have you made any decision
about our immediate future?

183
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:08,231
Believe it or not, Daddy,

184
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:11,742
Brooks has other interests
besides drinking.

185
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:13,709
That'll change.

186
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:15,337
Would you stop scaring them?

187
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,279
We're not scared.

188
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:19,146
Then how is it you've been engaged
for two months

189
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:20,878
and you're not running around
making wedding plans?

190
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:22,818
Because I told you.

191
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:25,516
We don't like the idea
of having a big wedding.

192
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,820
It doesn't have to be big.

193
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:28,859
We think it's silly.

194
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:32,158
You have to invite a bunch of strangers
to gawk at us

195
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:35,062
to somehow prove
our feelings for each other.

196
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:38,136
You know, it's embarrassing.

197
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:42,497
Brooks?

198
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:45,175
Whatever she wants.

199
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,879
Well, your mother wants a wedding.

200
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,244
Mommy had a wedding.

201
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:52,817
I did.

202
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:54,180
Wearing that dress,

203
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:58,313
my sister and my mother
fussing over me.

204
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:00,722
It was the best I ever looked in my life.

205
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,054
The Pierre.

206
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:06,894
I was drunk, and I didn't
have a glass of champagne.

207
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:10,435
Gliding around in your father's arms.

208
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:13,562
You know how good a dancer he is.

209
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,800
Dancing with Grandpa.

210
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:17,603
I don't want you to miss that.

211
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:28,083
What are you getting?

212
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,815
I'll have the mussels
with garlic if you do.

213
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:34,621
That's sweet.

214
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:44,129
Thank you for the ride, Father.

215
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:45,430
Peggy, wait.

216
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,301
Yes?

217
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:53,473
I want to ask you about something,
and it's personal.

218
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:56,680
Okay.

219
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:03,118
I have the honor of delivering
the sermon next Sunday.

220
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,213
It's Palm Sunday. That's a biggie.

221
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:07,315
I mean, you're on deck for Easter.

222
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:09,951
And, well...

223
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,690
you said you did presentations.

224
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:15,392
Can I run some things past you?

225
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:20,301
I don't know what I could tell you.

226
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:21,964
You must do this all the time.

227
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:23,166
Well, I've done it,

228
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:24,970
but your monsignor
is a tough act to follow.

229
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:30,377
I don't know that I'm your audience.

230
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:32,417
You were leaving,

231
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:35,351
and we ended up
having supper together,

232
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:37,513
and you're the only
person in this parish

233
00:12:37,623 --> 00:12:39,056
that knows about public speaking.

234
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:40,716
This is how God works.

235
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,295
I find that if I'm prepared

236
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:50,664
and I have confidence
in what I'm selling,

237
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,328
that kills the butterflies.

238
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,099
That's good.

239
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:55,696
I'm prepared.

240
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:57,435
Do you have any other tips?

241
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:04,879
Well, pick somebody
and make eye contact with them.

242
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:07,885
You'd think it would make you nervous,
but it really focuses you.

243
00:13:12,591 --> 00:13:14,752
Don't they have stuff that
you're supposed to talk about?

244
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,328
Yes, they have stuff.

245
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:22,162
Let's just say I'm covered
in the content department.

246
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:25,530
I can only speak for myself,

247
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:29,199
but the sermon is the only part of Mass
that's in English,

248
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:32,436
and it's very hard to tell sometimes.

249
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:35,139
Maybe be simpler?

250
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:38,011
Give us a chance of understanding.

251
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,513
Thank you for the ride.

252
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,554
I should go. I really do have to work.

253
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,556
Idle hands.

254
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,125
It's good to know you.

255
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:48,989
Have a great week.

256
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,448
I hate my feet.

257
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:17,852
I love your feet, Mommy.

258
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:20,050
Feet? I thought those were water skis.

259
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:23,022
Stop it.

260
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:25,119
Stop it! Stop it!

261
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:26,198
Stop it!

262
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:30,726
Great.

263
00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:32,303
You broke it.

264
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:34,429
I didn't mean to.

265
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,906
You're being wild in the house.

266
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:38,067
It's late.

267
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:40,236
Everybody, brush your teeth
and go to bed.

268
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:42,007
I'm hungry.

269
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:43,342
You're going to bed.

270
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:45,679
We didn't have any dinner.

271
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:51,316
It's 7:30.

272
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:54,521
Okay. Come downstairs.

273
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:56,060
I'll make you some grilled cheese.

274
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:58,129
Go.

275
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,596
- Go. Go. Go.
- Come on.

276
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:14,536
And my wife says, "Duck and cover."

277
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:24,112
Well, look at this.

278
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:27,555
Marty, meet Vicky.

279
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,854
Hello, Marty.

280
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:32,089
- Hello.
- I've heard so much about you.

281
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:34,722
But you didn't tell me
about his wonderful head.

282
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,095
What about it?

283
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:38,567
Someone thinks a lot.

284
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:40,798
Well, look at that. It's love at first rub.

285
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:43,875
My head has been known
to make wishes come true.

286
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:47,239
Don't get up.

287
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:49,337
This is Marty Hasselbach,
from Gorton's.

288
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,348
Nice to meet you. Roger Sterling.

289
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,849
We were due to meet
tomorrow anyway.

290
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,011
- Love that frozen scrod.
- Thank you.

291
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,247
I'm Vicky, Marty's wife.

292
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,018
Aren't you a lucky man.

293
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,288
Yes, I am.

294
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:06,830
We were just discussing the male head.

295
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:08,865
Is that right?

296
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,368
I like the Yul Brynner look.

297
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,062
She does seem to.

298
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:15,470
I keep threatening
to shave him one morning.

299
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:17,940
Just hop in the shower
and take it all off.

300
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:19,908
Is that right?

301
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:21,274
How long have you two been married?

302
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,439
Five years.

303
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,581
Second time around. That explains it.

304
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,251
It's nice to meet you.

305
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:31,983
I hope to see you both tomorrow.

306
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:34,821
A pleasure.

307
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,130
Mr. Draper, Mrs. Barrett
is here at my desk.

308
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,503
No. Of course. Send her in.

309
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:54,676
Mrs. Barrett.
To what do I owe the pleasure?

310
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:55,678
May I take your coat?

311
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:57,009
No, thank you.

312
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:01,948
I'm not sure how they
do it in show business,

313
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:03,419
but around here
we have this nifty gadget

314
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,149
called an appointment book.

315
00:17:05,257 --> 00:17:06,884
I was in the neighborhood.

316
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:08,926
What did Jimmy do now,
ask Eleanor Roosevelt

317
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,496
how fast her husband
ran the hundred-yard dash?

318
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:14,697
How are you?

319
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,994
Busy.

320
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,505
I have an idea for a television show.

321
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:21,766
Congratulations.

322
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,842
Is it too early to have a drink?

323
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:25,466
Let me call for some ice.

324
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:27,272
No need.

325
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:29,847
How do I make this happen?
Where do I go?

326
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,110
What is it?

327
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:34,651
Everyone loves Candid Camera, right?

328
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:36,277
Hidden camera situations.

329
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:37,855
Only Jimmy's the host,

330
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:39,981
and he's Jimmy, you know?

331
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:41,059
Not nice.

332
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:44,558
It's derivative, with a twist.

333
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:46,756
That's what they're looking for.

334
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:48,696
It's called Grin and Barrett.

335
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:50,700
That's cute.

336
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:53,704
I thought it up all by myself.

337
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:55,603
ABC's sick about losing Candid Camera.

338
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:58,232
But you'd have to get Jimmy
out of his contract with Utz.

339
00:17:58,343 --> 00:18:00,470
I thought about that.

340
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:01,568
It's exclusive,

341
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,341
but they could come on as sponsors.

342
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:05,144
Show needs a national sponsor.

343
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,581
Utz won't do you any good.

344
00:18:06,685 --> 00:18:09,313
You're a pessimist.

345
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,888
They could let him out.

346
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:12,820
They should want to keep Jimmy happy.

347
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,517
They don't care.

348
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:17,825
But they could be told

349
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,160
that their spots
would have more punch,

350
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,698
wherever they air,

351
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,597
if Jimmy's on a hit television show.

352
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:28,031
That is very good advice.

353
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:45,956
Will you sell the show for me?

354
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,184
I'm not interested in doing that.

355
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:53,158
But I can talk to the Schillings.

356
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:00,296
What's this?

357
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:06,005
I was thinking how I could avoid
becoming bored with you.

358
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,954
Bobbie. I have work.

359
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:18,113
Bullshit.

360
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,090
It's good.

361
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:24,958
But we should sell them
on the mascot first.

362
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:27,088
The jingle's going to be a cutie.

363
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,293
Hasselbach's at 3, right?

364
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:31,528
Is he bringing the missus?

365
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:34,205
Mary, that'll be all for now.

366
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:43,070
Roger...

367
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,742
there is a Mrs. Hasselbach,

368
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:46,909
and that's not her.

369
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:51,818
I see.

370
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:53,448
That makes sense.

371
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:55,356
I've got her number if you want it.

372
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,893
I've got lots of numbers.

373
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:01,322
No. That's okay.

374
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:03,196
Keep up the good work.

375
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:06,528
Daddy!

376
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,399
You need to shave.

377
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,408
You need to shave.

378
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:15,777
Some people weren't so good today.

379
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,180
What happened?

380
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:21,445
Bobby broke the record player.

381
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,612
The repair call is going to be $18.

382
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:26,816
9 if you want to put it in your car
and drag it over there.

383
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:28,984
I don't.

384
00:20:29,094 --> 00:20:30,186
When I asked him about it,

385
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:32,024
he said he didn't do it.

386
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:33,119
He lied to my face.

387
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,223
Where is he?

388
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:36,995
In his room.

389
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,297
Go on out.

390
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,616
Mommy says you broke the hi-fi.

391
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:55,653
I believe her.

392
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,381
Don't do that again.

393
00:20:57,489 --> 00:20:59,514
I won't.

394
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,527
That's it?

395
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:13,366
I said to him,
"Wait till your father gets home,"

396
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:15,030
and that's what he gets...
"Go to sleep."

397
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,368
He knows he did something wrong.

398
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:18,136
First the shenanigans
with the washing machine,

399
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:19,710
and now the record player.

400
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:21,369
Don, you have to do something.

401
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,913
He needs a spanking.

402
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:25,176
How else is he gonna learn

403
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,273
the difference between
right and wrong?

404
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:27,511
That's not the way it works.

405
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,177
You think you'd be
the man you are today

406
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,222
if your father didn't hit you?

407
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:34,720
Can I get something to eat?

408
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,296
You left this by the bed.

409
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:49,965
I'll do it.

410
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,114
Draper residence.

411
00:22:00,218 --> 00:22:02,448
Good. You're there. It's Duck.

412
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:04,112
Sunday morning.
Where else would I be?

413
00:22:04,222 --> 00:22:06,452
Shel Keneally called me late last night.

414
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:07,616
American Airlines already scheduled

415
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:09,284
a bunch of pitches for this week.

416
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:11,294
Why are we on the calendar
for two weeks from now?

417
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:12,420
We're not anymore.

418
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:14,260
I got us Good Friday first thing.

419
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:15,458
Most of the team's already here.

420
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:16,761
The rest are on their way.

421
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:19,337
My hand!

422
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:22,228
Hello?

423
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,330
Let me look.

424
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:24,704
It hurts.

425
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:26,334
I walk out of the room
for ten seconds?

426
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:28,003
Mommy, make it stop.

427
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:30,206
He needs to go
to the emergency room.

428
00:22:30,315 --> 00:22:31,509
That was Duck Phillips on the phone.

429
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:32,981
American Airlines
moved up their presentation.

430
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:34,985
- So?
- So I have to go in.

431
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:36,952
Damn it.

432
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:39,546
One child in the emergency room
is enough to deal with.

433
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:40,784
Take Sally.

434
00:22:40,892 --> 00:22:42,860
Send Sally to Francine's.

435
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:44,189
It's Palm Sunday.

436
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:46,355
I am not about to impose
on Francine today.

437
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,228
I want to go with Daddy.

438
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:13,554
Hello, Father Gill.

439
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:14,750
Come in.

440
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:17,852
- Come in.
- Father, welcome.

441
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:19,294
I'm terribly sorry, Anita, Ms. Olson.

442
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:20,558
I can't stay.

443
00:23:20,665 --> 00:23:22,530
- Oh, no.
- Oh, that's terrible.

444
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:24,568
We have Tom, Roberta Callahan,

445
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:26,364
Mrs. O'Neill, Mrs. Casey.

446
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:29,599
Yes, I'm afraid Mrs. Marchetti
has taken a turn for the worse.

447
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:30,868
I hope you'll forgive me.

448
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:32,034
Oh, that poor woman.

449
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:34,135
Let me fix you a paper plate.

450
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,474
Peggy didn't make it?

451
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,842
Oh, she's sick.

452
00:23:36,948 --> 00:23:39,815
Oh. Well, could you give her this?

453
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,613
It is a copy of my sermon.

454
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,709
She helped me quite a bit,

455
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:44,379
and I would love for her to see it.

456
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:46,923
Peggy helped you write something?

457
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:48,424
Just some tips, really.

458
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:50,017
It was very good.

459
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:52,596
I felt like I was the only one
you were talking to.

460
00:23:52,697 --> 00:23:53,891
Well, thank you.

461
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:55,057
Again, I'm sorry.

462
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:04,842
It's so nice he's taken an interest in her.

463
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:07,671
Come, let's eat.

464
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:27,360
Mr. Phillips and the others
are in the conference room.

465
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:29,559
I see you've brought a little helper.

466
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:31,966
Betty had her hands full today.

467
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:34,766
Sally, be good for Miss Holloway.

468
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:37,103
Keep her away from the paper cutter.

469
00:24:43,582 --> 00:24:45,174
Friday morning,
the American Airlines folks

470
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:46,409
will join us at 10.

471
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:48,008
Roger will handle the introductions.

472
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:49,518
Mr. Cooper, Mr. Sterling,

473
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:51,282
Creative to the right,
Accounts to the left,

474
00:24:51,389 --> 00:24:54,085
starting with myself, then the American
Airlines people, then Campbell.

475
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:57,218
Pete, you're next to our man Shel Keneally.

476
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:58,762
There will be one for each of them.

477
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:01,264
We can't get cordovan by Friday,
so we're going with maroon.

478
00:25:01,366 --> 00:25:02,560
Campbell will run the show.

479
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:04,828
He has a list of every ad
we need in the presentation.

480
00:25:04,936 --> 00:25:06,028
Art Department needs to make sure

481
00:25:06,137 --> 00:25:09,538
that every image we use in a comp
is an airplane that American has.

482
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:11,404
No cutting and pasting
planes from other ads.

483
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,034
They may all look alike to us, but...

484
00:25:13,144 --> 00:25:14,406
Why are you here?

485
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:18,506
I'm head of the Television Department.

486
00:25:19,718 --> 00:25:21,083
We have 90 minutes to present.

487
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:22,346
I'll do the setup...

488
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:23,921
the history of American Airlines

489
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,319
up to and including the crash.

490
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:26,913
I'll tee up Creative
with what research says

491
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:28,322
travelers are waiting
to hear from American.

492
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:31,293
And then, Don, you do what you do.

493
00:25:31,396 --> 00:25:33,455
Maybe you could give us a little peek.

494
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:36,327
I'm not ready to do that yet.

495
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:43,170
I say we show all three campaigns,

496
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:44,799
eliminate all possible objections.

497
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,901
Something for everybody.

498
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:49,913
Remember, this isn't the work
we have to run in the end.

499
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:51,676
This is about winning these guys over.

500
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:54,442
Creative.

501
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:56,609
In my office.

502
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:01,959
You have big ones.

503
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,528
My mommy has big ones, too.

504
00:26:04,629 --> 00:26:06,995
And I'm gonna have
big ones when I grow up.

505
00:26:16,107 --> 00:26:18,041
I don't care if we're
just selling a point of view,

506
00:26:18,143 --> 00:26:19,542
but we have to commit to one thing.

507
00:26:19,644 --> 00:26:21,441
They don't like wiggle room.

508
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:23,707
They like to see us
blowing up bridges behind us.

509
00:26:24,883 --> 00:26:27,681
These are the boards
for the 60-second television spots.

510
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:28,980
Music you can talk over.

511
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:31,411
Stewardesses.

512
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:32,990
We're gonna bookend every spot

513
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:34,683
with the plane taking off and landing

514
00:26:34,793 --> 00:26:36,283
up, down, no problems,

515
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:40,387
everything okay, every commercial.

516
00:26:43,835 --> 00:26:46,565
Where's that list
Duck's buddy Shel gave us

517
00:26:46,671 --> 00:26:48,605
with all the things that
make American different?

518
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:51,132
What's that?

519
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:55,876
The ad you asked for
to recruit stewardesses.

520
00:26:57,682 --> 00:26:59,172
It equates what should
be a glamorous job

521
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:01,616
with being a waitress in a tin can.

522
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,551
Where's the bar of soap,
the ticket sleeves?

523
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:05,020
Who's doing the in-flight menu?

524
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:08,524
I think it's the best menu I've ever written.

525
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:11,027
This is in French.
How do I know it's right?

526
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:12,653
It's right.

527
00:27:13,732 --> 00:27:14,699
Make up a chef.

528
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,892
Peggy, did you pick out
a china pattern yet?

529
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:18,594
Did you find the one
from the Queen Mary?

530
00:27:18,703 --> 00:27:22,537
Yes. But there needs to be a decision
if we're doing anything to the logo.

531
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:25,541
I don't know.

532
00:27:26,711 --> 00:27:29,009
We got a lot of bricks,

533
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:31,446
but I don't know
what the building looks like.

534
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:54,497
So how are you, Vicky?

535
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:56,267
I'm in a very good mood.

536
00:28:00,645 --> 00:28:02,340
Well, I hate to sound remedial,

537
00:28:02,447 --> 00:28:05,507
but I haven't done this
since I was in the Navy.

538
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:07,107
Been with a girl?

539
00:28:07,218 --> 00:28:09,413
No. Not that.

540
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:10,783
Don't worry.

541
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:13,585
The prices may have changed,
but the menu's still the same.

542
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:17,150
Well, your invoice ran across my desk.

543
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:32,408
Look at you.

544
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:40,709
The menu hasn't changed.

545
00:28:43,321 --> 00:28:45,653
Is it open for negotiation?

546
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:48,749
I don't want to ruin the magic.

547
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:52,023
How about double... plus carfare?

548
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:54,690
And I'll assume you live far away.

549
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,563
That'll be $100.

550
00:28:57,669 --> 00:29:00,433
But I want everything I want.

551
00:29:03,274 --> 00:29:05,504
Isn't that the perfect thing to say?

552
00:29:19,023 --> 00:29:20,854
That's not so bad, is it?

553
00:29:24,162 --> 00:29:26,653
I have to warn you,
I'm not in great health.

554
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,790
Don't believe what they say.

555
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:36,068
No one dies doing this.

556
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,541
Are you resting?

557
00:29:41,646 --> 00:29:43,773
Everybody's resting.

558
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:46,908
No. I'm thinking.

559
00:29:47,018 --> 00:29:48,713
Let's have a conversation.

560
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:54,818
Is that your maid?

561
00:29:56,494 --> 00:29:58,587
No. She's my girlfriend.

562
00:29:58,696 --> 00:30:00,095
Do you kiss her?

563
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:02,189
Sometimes.

564
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,894
Do you lay on top of her?

565
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:08,002
You know what, Sally?

566
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:11,405
Your daddy's gonna be angry
if I don't do my work.

567
00:30:12,877 --> 00:30:13,844
Okay.

568
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,447
Just a minute, girls.
It's almost your turn.

569
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:32,493
You know, we'll get to go
anywhere American flies.

570
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:34,064
Familiarization.

571
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:35,496
We'll have to rent another floor.

572
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,931
We'll all have our own offices.

573
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:41,335
Do you realize we will get to pick out
the stewardesses?

574
00:30:41,439 --> 00:30:42,565
Okay.

575
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:47,607
Son of a bitch.

576
00:30:47,712 --> 00:30:50,738
Stupid little...

577
00:30:54,485 --> 00:30:55,975
You there.

578
00:30:56,087 --> 00:30:57,816
Chewing your cud.

579
00:30:58,923 --> 00:31:00,914
It's one thing to be unladylike.

580
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:05,553
It's another to treat our office
like a subway platform.

581
00:31:05,663 --> 00:31:08,154
Pack up your Wrigley's and go home.

582
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:13,303
How could it be my gum?
My gum's in my mouth.

583
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:17,140
This place is a zoo.

584
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:20,006
Thank you for getting him
out of here for the day.

585
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:21,976
Lose the gum, then get
yourself some dinner.

586
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,105
He won't remember firing you.

587
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:40,160
American Airlines is not about the past
any more than America is.

588
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:45,459
Ask not about Cuba.
Ask not about the bomb.

589
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,128
We're going to the moon.

590
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:48,865
Throw everything out.

591
00:31:48,973 --> 00:31:50,565
Everything?

592
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:53,269
There is no such thing
as American history,

593
00:31:53,378 --> 00:31:54,436
only a frontier.

594
00:31:56,147 --> 00:31:58,843
That crash happened
to somebody else.

595
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:00,815
It's not about apologies
for what happened.

596
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,285
It's about those seven men
in the room on Friday

597
00:32:03,388 --> 00:32:05,822
and what airline they are
going to be running.

598
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,085
So what does that mean?

599
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:11,355
Let's pretend we know
what 1963 looks like.

600
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:25,601
Jesus, Draper, make a decision.

601
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:27,735
What's that leave us with,
introductions?

602
00:32:27,845 --> 00:32:29,176
If I can't mention the crash,

603
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,508
there's no preamble at all.

604
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:31,639
Let it go.

605
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:33,580
Our job is to bend down the branch.

606
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:34,913
Let him pick the fruit.

607
00:32:57,241 --> 00:32:59,766
That champagne
is probably near frozen.

608
00:33:00,845 --> 00:33:01,937
I'm meeting a friend.

609
00:33:03,781 --> 00:33:05,305
You know what I really want?

610
00:33:06,517 --> 00:33:08,610
Is there something we left out?

611
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,153
Have dinner with me?

612
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:14,219
I told you I'm meeting a friend.

613
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:16,418
I'll pay for his meeting, too.

614
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:20,290
You wouldn't think dinner
would be pushing it on the extras?

615
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:23,060
Have you been to Lutèce yet?

616
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:24,930
I have.

617
00:33:25,036 --> 00:33:26,663
I think you'd like it.

618
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:29,465
I've got it.

619
00:33:33,411 --> 00:33:35,811
It's great, but they're cheeky.

620
00:33:35,913 --> 00:33:38,780
They started with this
prix fixe menu at lunch.

621
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:40,748
8.50 for lunch.

622
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:43,116
And they have these wines.

623
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:44,882
What kind of wine do you like?

624
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:47,321
I don't know. Red?

625
00:33:47,425 --> 00:33:50,360
They're going to make you be
more specific than that.

626
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:56,457
We can walk, if you don't
mind a little rain.

627
00:33:56,567 --> 00:33:57,932
You know what?

628
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:01,028
I love the sound of cabs
whooshing in the water.

629
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:03,574
Shall we?

630
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:09,945
Isn't this a nice town?

631
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,447
Absolutely.

632
00:34:23,828 --> 00:34:26,092
She's here on a Sunday,
and I respect that,

633
00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:28,757
but you know she's earning
more than all of us.

634
00:34:32,036 --> 00:34:32,934
Come on.

635
00:34:33,037 --> 00:34:34,629
Up.

636
00:34:40,678 --> 00:34:42,578
Good night, ladies.

637
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,272
Thanks for baby-sitting.

638
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:50,215
I'm going home. Be good, Peaches.

639
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:54,622
Your sister wants to talk.

640
00:34:56,894 --> 00:34:58,828
Hey, Pegs.

641
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,955
Okay.

642
00:35:01,065 --> 00:35:02,430
It was good.

643
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:04,899
He gave us a copy
of his sermon to give to you.

644
00:35:06,504 --> 00:35:09,371
Okay. So long.

645
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:12,170
It's nice that he can get to know her
without all her troubles.

646
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:15,006
She's such a beautiful young girl.

647
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:19,174
She does whatever she feels like
with no regard at all.

648
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:22,377
You're too easy on her.
You know that.

649
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:24,284
Is Gerry warming up the car?

650
00:36:22,813 --> 00:36:25,509
Shel Keneally was fired this morning.

651
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,986
What?

652
00:36:29,086 --> 00:36:32,214
The rest are on their way in.

653
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:33,290
What's going on?

654
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:34,858
It's over.

655
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:37,427
So why are they coming in?

656
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:39,189
Because they have to.

657
00:36:40,998 --> 00:36:43,125
And we have to deliver a stillborn baby.

658
00:36:44,735 --> 00:36:48,501
Mr. Phillips, the gentlemen are here
from American Airlines.

659
00:36:48,606 --> 00:36:50,506
Send them in.

660
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,588
In the name of the Father, the Son,

661
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:08,181
and the Holy Spirit, amen.

662
00:37:09,794 --> 00:37:11,625
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

663
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:16,723
It's been two weeks
since my last confession.

664
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:20,463
I took something
that didn't belong to me.

665
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:23,062
Go on.

666
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:26,006
I was in the Laundromat,

667
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:29,079
and I took some coins off the machine

668
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,670
and used them.

669
00:37:32,783 --> 00:37:36,310
I took the Lord's name
in vain three times,

670
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,819
and...

671
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:43,927
and I am so angry, Father.

672
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:49,099
I am so angry at my little sister.

673
00:37:50,534 --> 00:37:53,992
She's causing my mother so much pain.

674
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,474
She had a child out of wedlock.

675
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:01,478
She seduced a married man.

676
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:03,308
It's a terrible sin,

677
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:06,474
and she acts like it didn't even happen.

678
00:38:09,654 --> 00:38:11,781
And I hate her for it.

679
00:38:13,824 --> 00:38:16,088
And I feel so guilty about it.

680
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:20,754
But everyone keeps
falling all over themselves

681
00:38:20,865 --> 00:38:22,492
trying to help her.

682
00:38:24,568 --> 00:38:27,435
And she goes on
like nothing happened.

683
00:38:28,873 --> 00:38:29,897
Nothing at all.

684
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:38,343
What about me, Father?

685
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:40,849
My troubles?

686
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:42,976
What about me being good?

687
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:44,281
For what?

688
00:38:45,923 --> 00:38:48,414
I understand it's difficult.

689
00:38:48,526 --> 00:38:51,723
You know it's not your place to judge.

690
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:54,627
God sees your goodness.

691
00:38:54,732 --> 00:38:56,996
It doesn't feel that way, Father.

692
00:38:57,101 --> 00:38:59,399
Try to trust God on this.

693
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:03,735
You will get your reward in heaven.

694
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:05,604
God loves you,

695
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:08,338
and he knows that you love your sister.

696
00:39:09,814 --> 00:39:11,372
I do.

697
00:39:12,783 --> 00:39:16,048
Say three Hail Marys
and two Our Fathers.

698
00:39:16,153 --> 00:39:19,088
And try to forgive your sister.

699
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,158
She's not as strong as you are.

700
00:39:22,593 --> 00:39:25,653
Would you like to make
your Act of Contrition?

701
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,334
O my God,

702
00:39:30,434 --> 00:39:33,232
I am heartily sorry
for having offended thee.

703
00:39:33,337 --> 00:39:35,965
I detest all my sins

704
00:39:36,073 --> 00:39:37,938
because I dread the loss of heaven...

705
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,413
Cooper walked them to the elevator.

706
00:39:51,522 --> 00:39:53,114
They acted impressed.

707
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:09,329
I just can't believe it.

708
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:13,403
Here. You should have this.

709
00:40:19,683 --> 00:40:20,809
No regrets, fellas.

710
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:22,317
We were in it.
That's the important thing.

711
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,217
It's heartbreaking.

712
00:40:24,321 --> 00:40:27,085
Still, good work, Don.

713
00:40:34,198 --> 00:40:35,392
Come on.

714
00:40:36,867 --> 00:40:38,562
We hired him to bring in new business,

715
00:40:38,669 --> 00:40:39,897
not lose old business.

716
00:40:40,004 --> 00:40:42,871
Don't you love the chase?

717
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:47,539
Sometimes it doesn't work out.

718
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:48,873
Those are the stakes.

719
00:40:48,979 --> 00:40:51,072
But when it does work out...

720
00:40:54,552 --> 00:40:57,020
it's like having that first cigarette.

721
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:59,180
Head gets all dizzy.

722
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:03,192
Your heart pounds, knees go weak.

723
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:04,818
Remember that?

724
00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:09,465
Old business is just old business.

725
00:41:20,377 --> 00:41:21,366
You're home early.

726
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:23,504
It's Good Friday.

727
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:26,014
How did it go?

728
00:41:26,116 --> 00:41:28,482
It didn't.

729
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:32,287
Bobby, stop playing with the robot.

730
00:41:36,961 --> 00:41:38,588
Do you want to talk about it?

731
00:41:40,064 --> 00:41:41,122
No.

732
00:41:43,868 --> 00:41:45,392
How was your day?

733
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:48,472
My father called. He's doing better.

734
00:41:48,572 --> 00:41:50,597
He and William played golf yesterday.

735
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:52,403
William made a show of paying for it.

736
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:55,675
Bobby, what did I just say?

737
00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:57,770
It was a accident.

738
00:41:57,882 --> 00:42:00,043
You don't listen. Don, do something.

739
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:07,857
Is that what you wanted?

740
00:42:12,463 --> 00:42:16,331
You take no responsibility
for anything that goes on in this house.

741
00:42:16,433 --> 00:42:19,027
I pay the bills,
put clothes on your back,

742
00:42:19,136 --> 00:42:20,467
your damn stables.

743
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:22,095
Don't you dare.

744
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:23,605
I'm here all day.

745
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:25,072
Alone with them, outnumbered.

746
00:42:25,175 --> 00:42:26,836
What about Carla?
Doesn't she count?

747
00:42:26,944 --> 00:42:29,412
It's not her job to raise our children!

748
00:42:29,513 --> 00:42:33,005
I'm here, and then you come home
and get to be the hero.

749
00:42:33,117 --> 00:42:34,482
You want me to bring home

750
00:42:34,585 --> 00:42:36,075
what I got at the office today?

751
00:42:36,186 --> 00:42:37,653
I'll put you through that window.

752
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:48,495
Brush your teeth. It's bedtime.

753
00:43:03,814 --> 00:43:05,145
Bobby, it's not a good time.

754
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:06,876
I'm sorry.

755
00:43:09,186 --> 00:43:10,414
It's okay.

756
00:43:13,057 --> 00:43:14,615
Dads get mad sometimes.

757
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:18,118
Did your daddy get mad?

758
00:43:19,163 --> 00:43:20,494
He did.

759
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:24,566
What did your daddy look like?

760
00:43:27,237 --> 00:43:28,204
Like me.

761
00:43:28,305 --> 00:43:29,533
But bigger.

762
00:43:31,308 --> 00:43:33,173
What did he like to eat?

763
00:43:37,648 --> 00:43:38,706
Ham.

764
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:43,613
And this candy.

765
00:43:43,721 --> 00:43:45,689
It tasted like violets.

766
00:43:47,691 --> 00:43:50,956
Had a beautiful purple
and silver package.

767
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:55,955
What did he do?

768
00:43:57,401 --> 00:43:59,733
I told you. He was a farmer.

769
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:03,940
But he died.

770
00:44:06,043 --> 00:44:07,510
A long time ago.

771
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:13,510
We have to get you a new daddy.

772
00:44:17,287 --> 00:44:18,379
Come here.

773
00:44:51,255 --> 00:44:52,813
You have nothing to say?

774
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:57,187
What do you want to hear?

775
00:44:58,896 --> 00:45:00,193
Something.

776
00:45:00,297 --> 00:45:01,787
Anything.

777
00:45:01,899 --> 00:45:05,562
How about you're going
to help raise these children,

778
00:45:05,669 --> 00:45:06,966
not be one?

779
00:45:07,071 --> 00:45:08,800
Bets,

780
00:45:08,906 --> 00:45:10,567
you do whatever you want.

781
00:45:10,674 --> 00:45:13,268
It's not about what I do.

782
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,048
He's a little kid.

783
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:24,817
My father beat
the hell out of me.

784
00:45:24,922 --> 00:45:26,583
All it did was
make me fantasize

785
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:29,022
about the day
I could murder him.

786
00:45:33,764 --> 00:45:35,823
I didn't know that.

787
00:45:35,933 --> 00:45:38,902
And I wasn't half
as good as Bobby.

788
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:28,182
Happy Easter, Peggy.

789
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:29,946
Hello, Father.

790
00:46:30,053 --> 00:46:32,317
I read your sermon. I liked it.

791
00:46:32,422 --> 00:46:33,719
It was very colloquial.

792
00:46:33,824 --> 00:46:36,292
You were very helpful.

793
00:46:43,834 --> 00:46:45,631
These kids.

794
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:55,171
For the little one.

795
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:15,123
