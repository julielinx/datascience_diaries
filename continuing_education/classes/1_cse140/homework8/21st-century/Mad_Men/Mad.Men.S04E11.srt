2
00:01:08,808 --> 00:01:10,876
I have sand
in the weirdest places.

3
00:01:10,943 --> 00:01:13,912
Jones beach?
Don't be so sure it's sand.

4
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,448
<i>Hold up.</i>

5
00:01:16,516 --> 00:01:18,984
We got hitchers.

6
00:01:19,052 --> 00:01:20,819
<i>- Made it.
- I see that.</i>

7
00:01:22,422 --> 00:01:24,322
Hey.

8
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:26,258
Hi.

9
00:01:29,529 --> 00:01:30,962
Girls, on the hop.

10
00:01:35,568 --> 00:01:37,235
You gotta get up.

11
00:01:39,639 --> 00:01:41,640
All I want to say
is I did not plan this.

12
00:01:41,708 --> 00:01:43,842
Nobody talk.
I'm really stoned.

13
00:01:47,046 --> 00:01:48,880
I'm sorry.

14
00:01:48,948 --> 00:01:50,215
You're like a pound or less.

15
00:02:00,126 --> 00:02:02,127
I see you went in.

16
00:02:02,195 --> 00:02:04,262
I like the water.

17
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:05,797
<i>Can I quote you on that?</i>

18
00:02:06,966 --> 00:02:08,600
I'm learning.

19
00:02:14,741 --> 00:02:16,575
- Oh my God.
You're a slob. - Shh!

20
00:02:16,642 --> 00:02:18,510
We have to be quiet.
I have a roommate.

21
00:02:37,063 --> 00:02:39,030
God, I love your shoulders.

22
00:02:39,098 --> 00:02:41,399
You look like
you're in the Olympics.

23
00:02:42,535 --> 00:02:44,035
You never stop talking.

24
00:02:47,874 --> 00:02:49,941
It was like the movies.
One minute we're listening

25
00:02:50,009 --> 00:02:51,643
To a lecture on rhododendrons,

26
00:02:51,711 --> 00:02:53,345
The next, Patricia is driving

27
00:02:53,412 --> 00:02:55,013
Like a speed racer
to the hospital.

28
00:02:55,081 --> 00:02:57,048
And Trudy keeps apologizing
in the back seat.

29
00:02:57,116 --> 00:02:59,017
We're saying,
"it's okay. Nobody cares.

30
00:02:59,085 --> 00:03:01,753
You're having a baby!"

31
00:03:01,821 --> 00:03:03,755
Meanwhile,
Campbell's on the back nine

32
00:03:03,823 --> 00:03:05,490
With his father-in-law,
who's also a client.

33
00:03:05,558 --> 00:03:08,059
Well, that's a nice way
to end a round.

34
00:03:08,127 --> 00:03:10,362
Ken Cosgrove.
Don't get up.

35
00:03:10,429 --> 00:03:12,430
John Flory.

36
00:03:12,498 --> 00:03:13,965
This is my fiancÃ©e Cynthia,

37
00:03:14,033 --> 00:03:15,700
Her parents,
ed and Lillian Baxter.

38
00:03:15,768 --> 00:03:17,102
- Sorry to interrupt.
- It's a pleasure.

39
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:19,070
- Nice to meet you.
- Aren't you lucky?

40
00:03:19,138 --> 00:03:20,972
I'm spending my Sunday
night with dodge.

41
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,809
Nice to see you, Ken.
And I'm sorry about, you know.

42
00:03:23,876 --> 00:03:26,845
- My condolences.
- Oh, David Montgomery?

43
00:03:26,913 --> 00:03:29,314
I was only there for about six months.
I didn't really know him.

44
00:03:29,382 --> 00:03:31,716
Oh.
Right.

45
00:03:31,784 --> 00:03:34,252
Well, I should be on my way.

46
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,353
- It was nice meeting you all.
- Mmn.

47
00:03:38,758 --> 00:03:41,193
Flory.

48
00:03:42,495 --> 00:03:44,262
Look, you're with your family.

49
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:46,064
- I shouldn't have said anything.
- You didn't.

50
00:03:46,132 --> 00:03:47,833
What's going on?

51
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,601
Lucky strike.

52
00:03:49,669 --> 00:03:51,203
They're coming over to us.

53
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,938
What?

54
00:03:53,005 --> 00:03:54,472
Look, you didn't
hear it from me, okay?

55
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,741
You're winding me up.

56
00:03:56,809 --> 00:03:58,643
No. American tobacco
came in last Monday,

57
00:03:58,711 --> 00:04:00,245
Said they're moving
all the brands to us.

58
00:04:00,313 --> 00:04:03,081
Well, that's not true.

59
00:04:03,149 --> 00:04:05,483
Someone should tell
Lee garner Jr. That.

60
00:04:05,551 --> 00:04:07,552
Sorry.

61
00:04:17,396 --> 00:04:19,397
<i>You okay, son?</i>

62
00:04:19,465 --> 00:04:22,133
Whenever ad men meet, all they
ever do is brag and brag.

63
00:04:22,201 --> 00:04:24,302
It's hard not to get rattled.

64
00:04:26,072 --> 00:04:28,240
Ed, Lillian,
you'll have to excuse me.

65
00:04:28,307 --> 00:04:30,775
Sweetheart, I swear to
you I wouldn't do this

66
00:04:30,843 --> 00:04:32,077
If it wasn't serious.

67
00:04:37,516 --> 00:04:40,018
Ken!
What a pleasant surprise!

68
00:04:40,086 --> 00:04:42,287
There's nothing much
to celebrate yet.

69
00:04:42,355 --> 00:04:45,056
They were going to send Trudy
home, but her mother protested.

70
00:04:45,124 --> 00:04:47,058
I sent her for food
just to get rid of her.

71
00:04:47,126 --> 00:04:50,362
Anyway, I suppose
your visit is premature.

72
00:04:50,429 --> 00:04:52,597
- I shouldn't use that word around here.
- Can I talk to you?

73
00:04:55,001 --> 00:04:57,636
John Flory, some prick
over at b.B.D.O.,

74
00:04:57,703 --> 00:04:59,537
Just told me that lucky
strike is going there.

75
00:05:00,706 --> 00:05:02,240
What?

76
00:05:02,308 --> 00:05:05,443
<i>You made me wait for you</i>

77
00:05:05,511 --> 00:05:06,878
While you worked.

78
00:05:06,946 --> 00:05:09,381
I'm not waiting anymore.

79
00:05:09,448 --> 00:05:11,049
I should get it.

80
00:05:13,119 --> 00:05:14,286
Of course.
The kids.

81
00:05:16,889 --> 00:05:18,223
- Hello?
- It's Pete.

82
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:20,292
Have you heard anything
about lucky strike leaving?

83
00:05:20,359 --> 00:05:23,194
- No. - Ken heard from
somebody at b.B.D.O

84
00:05:23,262 --> 00:05:26,364
- That Lucky's coming over.
- Bullshit. Call Roger.

85
00:05:26,432 --> 00:05:28,033
<i>I did. He's out.</i>

86
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,001
Wake Cooper.
Meet me in the office.

87
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:33,772
- What happened?
- I'm not sure.

88
00:05:35,107 --> 00:05:36,708
I have to make a call.

89
00:05:38,911 --> 00:05:40,779
<i>Hello?</i>

90
00:05:43,149 --> 00:05:45,083
- What's going on?
- Ken here

91
00:05:45,151 --> 00:05:46,718
Heard that lucky strike
is leaving.

92
00:05:46,786 --> 00:05:48,853
- That they've already left.
- What?

93
00:05:48,921 --> 00:05:51,723
- Who told you what?
- John Flory.

94
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:54,125
He's an account executive at b.B.
D.O. That's where they're going.

95
00:05:54,193 --> 00:05:57,128
- No. That's impossible.
- Call him.

96
00:05:57,196 --> 00:05:58,897
I'm telling you
it's impossible.

97
00:06:03,703 --> 00:06:05,503
Don't lose your temper.

98
00:06:07,406 --> 00:06:08,873
Somebody call lane in London?

99
00:06:08,941 --> 00:06:10,842
Yeah, I don't think
he'll go back to sleep.

100
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:13,111
Could I get a drink?

101
00:06:19,418 --> 00:06:21,019
It's ringing.

102
00:06:22,388 --> 00:06:24,022
Lee.
Roger sterling.

103
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:26,858
From your agency?

104
00:06:26,926 --> 00:06:29,160
Well, it's serious.

105
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:32,397
He's drunk.

106
00:06:34,033 --> 00:06:35,400
You're damn right I heard.

107
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:40,038
<i>Because you can consolidate
your business here.</i>

108
00:06:42,441 --> 00:06:44,275
<i>Just because your father's
non compos mentis</i>

109
00:06:44,343 --> 00:06:45,977
Doesn't mean you have
to listen to the board.

110
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,481
It's bullshit! Lee!

111
00:06:49,548 --> 00:06:51,549
30 years?!

112
00:06:51,617 --> 00:06:53,718
I have to hear it
on the street?

113
00:06:53,786 --> 00:06:55,954
No review?
Nothing?!

114
00:07:03,195 --> 00:07:05,163
He hung up.

115
00:07:06,999 --> 00:07:08,700
It's true?

116
00:07:20,613 --> 00:07:23,548
Tomorrow morning we're getting on the 6:00 A.
M. To Raleigh-Durham.

117
00:07:23,616 --> 00:07:25,617
I'll do it.

118
00:07:25,684 --> 00:07:27,452
I've known him half my life.

119
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,354
I need a drink.

120
00:07:43,803 --> 00:07:47,072
- What time is it?
- Midnight.

121
00:07:49,075 --> 00:07:50,809
You want one?

122
00:07:52,645 --> 00:07:54,612
Looks like you need both.

123
00:08:02,054 --> 00:08:04,122
It looks like lucky strike
might have gone South.

124
00:08:05,658 --> 00:08:07,392
Holy crap.

125
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:10,028
Obviously we'd like to avoid
that information getting out.

126
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:13,231
What happened?

127
00:08:13,299 --> 00:08:15,700
Supposedly,
they're consolidating

128
00:08:15,768 --> 00:08:18,636
For a reduced commission
at b.B.D.O.

129
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:24,209
Hey, watch it.
You have to keep a clear head.

130
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,248
Every day, I tried not
to think about what would happen

131
00:08:30,316 --> 00:08:31,850
If this happened.

132
00:08:39,758 --> 00:08:41,593
Aw, look at that plum.

133
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:47,565
- What's that?
- That face.

134
00:08:51,203 --> 00:08:53,338
You're the most hirable man
on Madison Avenue.

135
00:08:53,405 --> 00:08:55,106
I'm not at that point yet.

136
00:08:57,176 --> 00:08:58,610
Okay.

137
00:09:18,864 --> 00:09:21,633
- Where's Trudy?
- Her mother's got her all worked up.

138
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,502
She made such a stink.
And that thing's at least another day away.

139
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:26,504
Can I see her?

140
00:09:26,572 --> 00:09:28,206
Have you been drinking?

141
00:09:30,009 --> 00:09:31,376
You need to calm down.

142
00:09:31,443 --> 00:09:33,511
I was at a ballgame
when Trudy was born.

143
00:09:33,579 --> 00:09:35,713
Go about your business.

144
00:09:42,488 --> 00:09:43,821
Are you all right?

145
00:09:48,627 --> 00:09:50,128
Could I speak
with you candidly?

146
00:09:50,196 --> 00:09:52,330
Always.
I'd like to think

147
00:09:52,398 --> 00:09:54,432
I'm more to you than
a typical father-in-law.

148
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,235
You are. That's the problem.
It's about business.

149
00:09:58,904 --> 00:10:00,772
There's no business
in here, son.

150
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:06,110
We may have lost lucky strike.

151
00:10:06,178 --> 00:10:08,379
I'm sure this agency
was a thrill,

152
00:10:08,447 --> 00:10:09,614
But you've had your folly.

153
00:10:09,682 --> 00:10:12,350
That's not right, Tom.

154
00:10:12,418 --> 00:10:15,153
I haven't stayed at Vick chemical
for 28 years because I love it.

155
00:10:15,221 --> 00:10:18,690
It's because I have a family.
Any minute here, you will too.

156
00:10:18,757 --> 00:10:21,893
- This still can work.
- I'm not rooting against you.

157
00:10:21,961 --> 00:10:24,195
You've got my account,
for God's sake.

158
00:10:24,263 --> 00:10:26,464
It's just...

159
00:10:26,532 --> 00:10:29,567
You're a frequent topic
at c.G.C.

160
00:10:30,836 --> 00:10:32,904
Apparently you were
a tough act to follow

161
00:10:32,972 --> 00:10:35,473
- When we moved Clearasil over there.
- Ted Chaough?

162
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:38,009
- I hate him.
- He's a good guy.

163
00:10:38,077 --> 00:10:41,679
He's not interested in me.
He's just trying to hobble don.

164
00:10:41,747 --> 00:10:44,749
There's no reward
in going down with the ship.

165
00:10:44,817 --> 00:10:47,919
I have an agency.
I'm a partner.

166
00:10:49,321 --> 00:10:50,855
I found him.

167
00:10:50,923 --> 00:10:53,625
He was down at the candy
machines dozed off.

168
00:10:53,692 --> 00:10:54,826
<i>- Can I see her?
- No.</i>

169
00:10:54,893 --> 00:10:56,894
She finally went to sleep.

170
00:10:56,962 --> 00:10:58,630
Why don't you just go back

171
00:10:58,697 --> 00:11:00,265
To the candy machines
and we'll wait?

172
00:11:00,332 --> 00:11:02,033
I'm sorry about that.

173
00:11:09,608 --> 00:11:13,211
The air conditioning guy's
supposed to be there at 8:00.

174
00:11:16,215 --> 00:11:17,949
I guess I'll see you then.

175
00:11:20,786 --> 00:11:22,620
You don't want me to go?

176
00:11:24,423 --> 00:11:27,525
I want you to do
whatever you usually do.

177
00:11:27,593 --> 00:11:30,528
<i>Hey, I don't usually
do anything.</i>

178
00:11:32,798 --> 00:11:36,367
- Really? - Can't you tell
by how badly I'm leaving?

179
00:11:39,638 --> 00:11:41,239
I'm not letting you leave.

180
00:11:51,717 --> 00:11:53,618
What about your air?

181
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:02,026
You're unbelievable.

182
00:12:02,094 --> 00:12:04,862
I'm sorry.
I'm not usually like this.

183
00:12:14,206 --> 00:12:18,142
- Hello?
- I just walked out of there.

184
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:19,744
It's over.

185
00:12:22,014 --> 00:12:23,981
<i>- I see.
- Since his father got sick,</i>

186
00:12:24,049 --> 00:12:26,351
<i>The board took over.
There's no point in talking to them.</i>

187
00:12:26,418 --> 00:12:28,486
<i>He said
we did good work.</i>

188
00:12:28,554 --> 00:12:30,588
Our clients need
to hear this from us.

189
00:12:30,656 --> 00:12:32,957
I know, Bert.
Don't wait for me.

190
00:12:33,025 --> 00:12:36,761
I'm standing by
Lee's receptionist.

191
00:12:36,829 --> 00:12:38,996
I didn't want to have to pay
for the long-distance call.

192
00:12:39,064 --> 00:12:41,366
Very well then.

193
00:13:00,205 --> 00:13:01,939
Lane Pryce isn't coming back.

194
00:13:02,007 --> 00:13:03,941
That's my guess.

195
00:13:04,009 --> 00:13:05,976
I think they'd
do that in a memo.

196
00:13:06,044 --> 00:13:08,379
I got $5 that says
Cooper's retiring.

197
00:13:08,446 --> 00:13:10,447
No champagne?

198
00:13:10,515 --> 00:13:12,549
I'd say he's got cancer.

199
00:13:12,617 --> 00:13:14,451
It's in bigger print now.

200
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:17,354
Everyone? If we could have
your attention, please?

201
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,625
<i>- Bert.
- Ahem.</i>

202
00:13:23,561 --> 00:13:26,930
"we have called this meeting
of our nearest and dearest"

203
00:13:26,998 --> 00:13:31,535
To let you know
of a change in the agency.

204
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:34,171
After 30 years
of consummate service,

205
00:13:34,239 --> 00:13:37,675
American tobacco has
reluctantly decided

206
00:13:37,742 --> 00:13:40,110
To consolidate their business

207
00:13:40,178 --> 00:13:43,480
"At batten, Barton,
Durstine & Osborn."

208
00:13:44,649 --> 00:13:46,383
Damn it.

209
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:50,454
"so what does this mean to you?

210
00:13:50,522 --> 00:13:55,559
Partner, creative director."

211
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:00,064
Pete Campbell and Ken Cosgrove

212
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:01,732
Will handle calls to clients.

213
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,168
Those are the only calls
we want made with this news.

214
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:07,805
Now we've had
a pretty good year.

215
00:14:07,872 --> 00:14:09,873
We've gained more accounts

216
00:14:09,941 --> 00:14:11,342
Than we've lost, a lot more,

217
00:14:11,409 --> 00:14:14,278
Because our work is
thoughtful and effective...

218
00:14:14,346 --> 00:14:16,413
Even lucky strike said so...

219
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:18,582
Which means that
nothing should change.

220
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,784
Nothing will change.

221
00:14:20,852 --> 00:14:22,853
We're gonna push ourselves
shoulder to shoulder

222
00:14:22,921 --> 00:14:25,155
And we're gonna overcome this
and succeed tenfold

223
00:14:25,223 --> 00:14:27,024
And it will be exhilarating.

224
00:14:29,361 --> 00:14:31,228
Joe?

225
00:14:32,964 --> 00:14:36,834
As don said,
nothing is going to change.

226
00:14:36,901 --> 00:14:40,270
<i>There's only a
small modification in policy.</i>

227
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:42,272
<i>Anything
out of the ordinary</i>

228
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:46,643
<i>Must be approved by myself,
Joan Harris or lane Pryce.</i>

229
00:14:46,711 --> 00:14:48,445
<i>That said,</i>

230
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:52,683
Inquiries as to paychecks
and advances...

231
00:14:52,751 --> 00:14:55,586
- What's going on?
- That's the head of accounting.

232
00:14:55,653 --> 00:14:57,354
What do you think's going on?

233
00:14:57,422 --> 00:14:58,756
<i>Any questions?</i>

234
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:03,460
Nothing?

235
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:06,029
Okay. If you want
to talk to me individually,

236
00:15:06,097 --> 00:15:08,399
I'll be in my office.

237
00:15:10,602 --> 00:15:13,337
- What happened?
- We lost lucky strike.

238
00:15:13,405 --> 00:15:15,639
Jesus.

239
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:18,442
But it sounds like
everything's under control.

240
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:20,444
I've got to go to a meeting.

241
00:15:20,512 --> 00:15:23,714
Peggy, Freddy, Danny,
Stan... in my office.

242
00:15:31,122 --> 00:15:32,589
We're in some trouble here.

243
00:15:32,657 --> 00:15:34,758
Creative needs to be
on its toes.

244
00:15:34,826 --> 00:15:37,494
Is it a "last hired,
last fired" sort of thing?

245
00:15:39,097 --> 00:15:41,098
You're in this room.
That's all I can say.

246
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:43,167
Now myself
and the other partners

247
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:45,402
Will be out there beating the
bushes for new business,

248
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:48,071
But creative's job is to
hold on to what we have.

249
00:15:48,139 --> 00:15:51,642
That means client's ideas should
seem better than they normally do.

250
00:15:51,709 --> 00:15:54,144
For the next few weeks
the only words you know

251
00:15:54,212 --> 00:15:56,246
- Are "yes, sir."
- yes, sir.

252
00:15:56,314 --> 00:15:58,916
That means, Stan, you babysit
that Samsonite shoot every day.

253
00:15:58,983 --> 00:16:01,452
Peggy, the Playtex presentation
is still set for tomorrow.

254
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,220
I'll bring in my notes.
I can prep you in 10 minutes.

255
00:16:03,288 --> 00:16:04,855
No. You're still
gonna do it.

256
00:16:04,923 --> 00:16:06,857
It'll look desperate
if I'm suddenly involved.

257
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:10,060
- So what about it then?
- Be successful.

258
00:16:10,128 --> 00:16:12,062
I'm not worried.

259
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:14,131
Okay. Let's skip
the gossip out there.

260
00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:16,066
Get to work.

261
00:16:18,803 --> 00:16:21,138
Peggy?

262
00:16:21,206 --> 00:16:22,940
You're not worried?

263
00:16:23,007 --> 00:16:25,709
I don-t know.
You seem to have everything in hand.

264
00:16:27,412 --> 00:16:28,779
Should I be worried?

265
00:16:28,847 --> 00:16:31,014
We don't even know
how bad this is gonna be

266
00:16:31,082 --> 00:16:32,916
Until lane shows up.

267
00:16:32,984 --> 00:16:35,385
Every time something
good happens,

268
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:38,388
Something bad happens.
I knew I'd pay for it.

269
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:40,390
You're not paying for anything.

270
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,326
But I'm counting on you.

271
00:16:45,396 --> 00:16:47,231
<i>Close that, will you?</i>

272
00:17:05,783 --> 00:17:08,452
- Joan Harris.
- Joanie, I'm glad you're there.

273
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,388
I'm so sorry.

274
00:17:11,456 --> 00:17:13,690
I feel so guilty.

275
00:17:13,758 --> 00:17:15,759
It's not your fault.

276
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:17,861
I need to see you.

277
00:17:17,929 --> 00:17:19,396
I need you to come down here.

278
00:17:19,464 --> 00:17:21,164
I'm not flying to Raleigh.

279
00:17:21,232 --> 00:17:25,002
- When do you get back?
- No, I'm here.

280
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:26,703
What are you talking about?

281
00:17:26,771 --> 00:17:28,505
Mr. Cooper said
he spoke with you.

282
00:17:28,573 --> 00:17:32,042
He did, but I didn't go.

283
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:34,511
Damn it, Roger.
Get on a plane.

284
00:17:34,579 --> 00:17:37,180
You're very persuasive
in person.

285
00:17:37,248 --> 00:17:39,249
There's no point.

286
00:17:39,317 --> 00:17:41,752
It's been over for weeks.
Garner was supposed to give me a month.

287
00:17:41,819 --> 00:17:43,153
The bastard
couldn't keep to it.

288
00:17:43,221 --> 00:17:45,188
<i>You knew about it?!</i>

289
00:17:45,256 --> 00:17:47,791
I can't believe you.
We could've done something.

290
00:17:47,859 --> 00:17:50,394
Don't yell at me.
You know what it's been like

291
00:17:50,461 --> 00:17:52,629
Walking around with this?
I got a hole in my gut.

292
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:56,466
What am I supposed to do
with this information?

293
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:58,135
I'm sorry.

294
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,437
But I need you to know
why I need you to see you.

295
00:18:00,505 --> 00:18:02,306
You should've told me.

296
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:04,474
Why didn't you tell me?

297
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:07,077
I kept meaning
to say something.

298
00:18:07,145 --> 00:18:09,279
I thought I still had time.
I don't know.

299
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:13,650
I should go.
There's a lot of work to do.

300
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:15,552
Come after work.

301
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:17,354
I'm at the Statler.

302
00:18:17,422 --> 00:18:19,690
I had to stay away
from midtown.

303
00:18:19,757 --> 00:18:21,658
I'll have to see.

304
00:18:30,802 --> 00:18:32,502
I think my setup is good,

305
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:35,505
But don always has these
little examples at the end

306
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:38,875
<i>That explain to the client
how big the idea is.</i>

307
00:18:38,943 --> 00:18:41,612
They're always kind of poetic.

308
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,147
So get don to write it.
We can't lose this.

309
00:18:44,215 --> 00:18:46,216
Since when do we have donuts?

310
00:18:46,284 --> 00:18:48,986
Condemned man always gets
his choice of a last meal.

311
00:18:49,053 --> 00:18:51,188
You know what Pete Campbell
just said to me?

312
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,357
He said if anybody sends
a resume out of here,

313
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:56,360
- They're gonna get executed.
- Fellas, we're on an account right now.

314
00:18:59,297 --> 00:19:01,865
Playtex gloves
protect a woman's hands

315
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:05,302
So they're soft enough to touch

316
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:07,738
All the things
a woman wants to touch.

317
00:19:07,805 --> 00:19:09,973
All the things?

318
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:15,112
The exciting things
she wants to feel

319
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:17,714
With her fingertips.

320
00:19:19,717 --> 00:19:21,318
His lips.

321
00:19:21,386 --> 00:19:24,021
The tuft of hair on his chest.

322
00:19:26,758 --> 00:19:28,925
The small of his back.

323
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,295
I can't imagine don
saying that.

324
00:19:32,363 --> 00:19:35,599
Excuse me.
I have a delivery for Peggy Olson.

325
00:19:37,435 --> 00:19:39,836
- What? - Are you Peggy Olson?
It's c.O.D.

326
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:44,007
Let me get my purse.

327
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,879
Go ahead without me.
I'm gonna take care of this and then practice.

328
00:19:50,548 --> 00:19:53,250
Am I wrong or is she
giving it off?

329
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,485
Well,
it's the last days of Rome.

330
00:19:55,553 --> 00:19:57,521
I was in an agency
that went down.

331
00:19:57,588 --> 00:19:59,122
The women
get sex-crazed.

332
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:03,093
The energy is very good.

333
00:20:07,348 --> 00:20:08,849
They said they wanted
to revise the media plan,

334
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,250
But I think what they
really wanted was a budget

335
00:20:10,318 --> 00:20:11,618
To see how much of their money
we haven't spent yet.

336
00:20:11,686 --> 00:20:14,287
- Who are we talking about?
- Birds-eye.

337
00:20:14,355 --> 00:20:16,023
Why are we worrying
about existing accounts?

338
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:17,858
If anything, they're going
to get more attention.

339
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,893
Because they're afraid
we won't be here.

340
00:20:19,961 --> 00:20:22,729
I have news from London.

341
00:20:22,797 --> 00:20:25,832
Pete, wake up.

342
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,835
Lane thinks our billings are probably
around $22 million without lucky,

343
00:20:28,903 --> 00:20:30,537
But he has to look
at everything in person.

344
00:20:30,605 --> 00:20:32,105
When's he coming?

345
00:20:32,173 --> 00:20:33,707
As soon as he can.

346
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:36,910
David Montgomery's memorial
is tomorrow afternoon.

347
00:20:36,978 --> 00:20:38,545
In case we need cheering up?

348
00:20:38,613 --> 00:20:40,714
The man was senior
vice president of accounts

349
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:43,550
At the #4 agency.

350
00:20:43,618 --> 00:20:46,453
There's gonna be a lot of
vulnerable clients in attendance.

351
00:20:46,521 --> 00:20:49,022
- I think Roger knew him.
- Sorry to interrupt.

352
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:51,958
- It's Al Weaver from glo-coat.
- What does he want?

353
00:20:52,026 --> 00:20:54,361
- I don't know.
- Do you want me on the call?

354
00:20:54,429 --> 00:20:56,663
Didn't you talk
with him this morning?

355
00:20:58,066 --> 00:20:59,466
No.

356
00:21:15,883 --> 00:21:17,884
<i>- Al, how are you?
- Hello, don.</i>

357
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:20,320
<i>I'm glad I could reach you.
I just wanted to let you know</i>

358
00:21:20,388 --> 00:21:22,956
<i>We appreciate everything
you've done for us,</i>

359
00:21:23,024 --> 00:21:26,059
<i>But we've decided to take the
account in a different direction.</i>

360
00:21:26,127 --> 00:21:28,528
<i>- All right, Al... - I want you to
know it wasn't an easy decision.</i>

361
00:21:28,596 --> 00:21:30,397
<i>- Now can I talk?
- Sure.</i>

362
00:21:30,465 --> 00:21:32,532
I don't think you understand
what's happened here.

363
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,401
And I'm not talking about
losing lucky strike.

364
00:21:34,469 --> 00:21:36,903
<i>- Lucky strike didn't enter into it.
- Really?</i>

365
00:21:36,971 --> 00:21:38,805
So that has nothing
to do with this?

366
00:21:38,873 --> 00:21:41,074
<i>Don, it's a simple coincidence
that it happened now.</i>

367
00:21:41,142 --> 00:21:43,944
Okay, you're right.
It is bad timing.

368
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,712
<i>How can you blame us
for wanting to move on?</i>

369
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,248
Because that commercial,
that little cowboy kid,

370
00:21:48,316 --> 00:21:50,650
Was the first successful
strategy you've been near

371
00:21:50,718 --> 00:21:53,653
Since you sponsored fibber McGee and Molly.
We won the Clio!

372
00:21:53,721 --> 00:21:55,455
<i>- You won the Clio.
- With work we did for you!</i>

373
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:56,990
With your direction!

374
00:21:57,058 --> 00:21:58,625
<i>Believe me,
we know how it looks,</i>

375
00:21:58,693 --> 00:22:00,527
<i>But it's just business,
plain and simple.</i>

376
00:22:00,595 --> 00:22:03,763
I'm coming out there.
We're gonna talk about this in person.

377
00:22:03,831 --> 00:22:06,466
<i>I'm sorry, don.
The decision's been made.</i>

378
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:08,635
<i>I just thought
you should hear it from me.</i>

379
00:22:08,703 --> 00:22:10,637
You know we're gonna want
another shot at this soon.

380
00:22:10,705 --> 00:22:12,472
<i>As long as you're around.</i>

381
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,508
We'll be here.
Don't worry.

382
00:22:14,575 --> 00:22:16,243
<i>Good luck, don.</i>

383
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:18,345
<i>I hope we can work
together again sometime.</i>

384
00:22:18,412 --> 00:22:20,313
<i>- Okay.
- Goodbye.</i>

385
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:21,414
Goodbye.

386
00:22:30,091 --> 00:22:32,692
<i>What was that?</i>

387
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,294
Nothing.

388
00:22:37,098 --> 00:22:39,499
- Do you want ice?
- No, but I need a favor.

389
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:41,768
- Make sure I don't overdo it.
- Okay.

390
00:22:41,836 --> 00:22:45,071
How do I... um,
it's hard to tell with you.

391
00:22:45,139 --> 00:22:48,341
Stop me at three.
This is one.

392
00:22:53,915 --> 00:22:56,516
The doctor says they never let
the labor go past two sunsets.

393
00:22:56,584 --> 00:22:57,984
<i>What exactly
is the problem?</i>

394
00:22:58,052 --> 00:23:00,020
Apparently Trudy's
pelvis is too small

395
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:01,888
And the baby's shoulders
can't get through.

396
00:23:01,956 --> 00:23:05,192
- They should cut it out.
- They don't like to start there.

397
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:07,794
Go to the hospital.
There's nothing to do here.

398
00:23:07,862 --> 00:23:10,330
- It's obviously what matters to you.
- What?

399
00:23:10,398 --> 00:23:12,465
I don't know what the hell you
said to them this morning.

400
00:23:17,939 --> 00:23:21,408
So, Joan, that puts us at what?
20 million and change?

401
00:23:21,475 --> 00:23:23,510
Are you doubting my efforts?

402
00:23:23,578 --> 00:23:25,412
All you had to do was tell
them everything was fine.

403
00:23:25,479 --> 00:23:27,113
You think that call's
easy to make?

404
00:23:27,181 --> 00:23:28,982
I think you're distracted.

405
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:30,617
Because of that, I think you
scared the shit out of 'em.

406
00:23:30,685 --> 00:23:32,652
Who the hell do you think
you're talking to?

407
00:23:54,742 --> 00:23:56,676
Don't blow a gasket.

408
00:23:56,744 --> 00:23:59,479
He called looking for me and my
secretary told him where I was.

409
00:23:59,547 --> 00:24:01,381
Incredible.

410
00:24:03,351 --> 00:24:05,085
<i>That was something else.</i>

411
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:08,455
There he is...
the man of the hour.

412
00:24:08,522 --> 00:24:10,824
Ted. How considerate
of you to stop by.

413
00:24:10,891 --> 00:24:12,626
I wish the baby
was here already,

414
00:24:12,693 --> 00:24:14,194
But I'm sure everyone
feels that way.

415
00:24:14,262 --> 00:24:16,263
Good news is always
worth waiting for.

416
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:19,199
Don't let
your vanity get the best of you.

417
00:24:19,267 --> 00:24:21,434
There is nothing wrong
with being called grandma.

418
00:24:26,407 --> 00:24:29,009
It's a rattle.
You can get it engraved.

419
00:24:29,076 --> 00:24:31,111
Ogilvy sent me one
when my son was born.

420
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:33,847
Thank you.
What do you want, Ted?

421
00:24:33,914 --> 00:24:36,049
No, this is about
what you want.

422
00:24:36,117 --> 00:24:38,485
I mean, you're about
to have everything

423
00:24:38,552 --> 00:24:40,654
The minute that baby comes.

424
00:24:40,721 --> 00:24:42,756
You know your father-in-law
never stops talking about you?

425
00:24:42,823 --> 00:24:44,624
He doesn't know the half of it.

426
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:47,227
You've brought in a little business
since you went out on your own...

427
00:24:47,295 --> 00:24:49,296
Glo-coat, life cereal,

428
00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:51,531
Sugarberry hams,
Vick chemical obviously,

429
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:53,967
Mountain dew, Fillmore
auto, birds-eye, ponds?

430
00:24:54,035 --> 00:24:56,102
I didn't do all that by myself.

431
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:59,239
Pete, as far as I'm concerned,
you're what's missing from c.G.C.

432
00:25:00,608 --> 00:25:02,242
Jim cutler's due to retire.

433
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:04,244
"Campbell, Gleason & Chaough"?

434
00:25:04,312 --> 00:25:07,180
Has a nice ring to it.

435
00:25:07,248 --> 00:25:09,549
Wouldn't you want
your name first?

436
00:25:09,617 --> 00:25:11,284
I'm open to it if we're
having that discussion.

437
00:25:12,853 --> 00:25:14,487
You'll have
a full voting third.

438
00:25:14,555 --> 00:25:16,122
I'm not don.

439
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:18,058
It's not the wild West.

440
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:21,094
We just got Alfa romeo...
little Italian sports car.

441
00:25:21,162 --> 00:25:23,763
I don't know if you've heard of it, but I
think you'll really enjoy driving one.

442
00:25:23,831 --> 00:25:26,366
- I don't drive.
- I'll teach you.

443
00:25:26,434 --> 00:25:30,003
Tom, Jeannie,
my offer still stands.

444
00:25:30,071 --> 00:25:31,871
<i>If you want a hotel room, I can
get you one across the street.</i>

445
00:25:47,555 --> 00:25:50,056
Roger.
I let you come over

446
00:25:50,124 --> 00:25:52,525
Because you said you needed to talk.
We can talk.

447
00:25:52,593 --> 00:25:54,728
- Joanie, I need you.
- Stop it,

448
00:25:54,795 --> 00:25:56,529
Or we can talk on the phone.

449
00:25:59,667 --> 00:26:00,934
Is that what you sleep in now?

450
00:26:02,937 --> 00:26:05,972
What do you want?
I'm exhausted!

451
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,608
I waited for you at the hotel.

452
00:26:08,676 --> 00:26:10,844
- Why didn't you come?
Are you mad at me? - No.

453
00:26:10,911 --> 00:26:13,747
Roger, I can't do this anymore.

454
00:26:13,814 --> 00:26:15,949
You always say that.

455
00:26:16,016 --> 00:26:18,785
- Then you come back to me because
we belong together. - Don't do that.

456
00:26:20,321 --> 00:26:22,155
I need you right now.

457
00:26:22,223 --> 00:26:24,290
Because I'm a port in a storm?

458
00:26:24,358 --> 00:26:27,794
No. Because I feel like
shit and you care about me.

459
00:26:27,862 --> 00:26:30,263
I'm not a solution
to your problems.

460
00:26:30,331 --> 00:26:32,699
I'm another problem.

461
00:26:32,767 --> 00:26:34,701
Are you serious?

462
00:26:34,769 --> 00:26:37,170
I can't do this anymore.

463
00:26:37,238 --> 00:26:39,873
You'll change your mind.
You'll see.

464
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,274
I'm sorry.

465
00:26:43,043 --> 00:26:45,445
I just can't do this anymore.

466
00:26:47,815 --> 00:26:49,549
So what are you trying to say?

467
00:26:49,617 --> 00:26:51,518
Roger.

468
00:27:32,393 --> 00:27:34,194
So that night we got mugged,

469
00:27:34,261 --> 00:27:36,196
That was the last time?

470
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:42,302
Wish I'd known that.

471
00:28:05,914 --> 00:28:08,248
God, I'd think this place
would be packed still.

472
00:28:08,316 --> 00:28:10,084
It's 8:00.

473
00:28:10,151 --> 00:28:12,119
There's only so much we can
pretend like we're doing.

474
00:28:17,993 --> 00:28:19,560
- Are you okay?
- You want something?

475
00:28:21,997 --> 00:28:23,864
I'd rather eat, but that's me.

476
00:28:23,932 --> 00:28:25,866
I'm one over for the day.

477
00:28:31,239 --> 00:28:32,906
See that?

478
00:28:32,974 --> 00:28:35,342
I kissed you and it got quiet.

479
00:28:38,113 --> 00:28:40,481
- How'd it go?
- It was...

480
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:44,284
Miserable.

481
00:28:44,352 --> 00:28:46,453
Clients are running scared.

482
00:28:46,521 --> 00:28:49,123
I'm used to having
my ideas rejected, not me.

483
00:28:50,925 --> 00:28:53,127
How do you do it?

484
00:28:53,194 --> 00:28:55,729
My job is to present facts.

485
00:28:55,797 --> 00:28:58,866
If they're unhappy with the
agency, it's not my problem.

486
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:04,371
Who's unhappy?

487
00:29:04,439 --> 00:29:07,608
Come on.
Clients are always unhappy.

488
00:29:10,512 --> 00:29:11,545
Like who?

489
00:29:13,882 --> 00:29:15,315
- Are you kidding?
- No.

490
00:29:15,383 --> 00:29:17,451
Why?
I'm drowning here.

491
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:19,453
You know I can't do that.

492
00:29:19,521 --> 00:29:21,388
If a client is unhappy,
they're unhappy.

493
00:29:21,456 --> 00:29:23,857
There's nothing against telling
them to have dinner with me.

494
00:29:23,925 --> 00:29:26,326
If you don't want to, tell me who they are.
I'll call 'em out of the blue.

495
00:29:26,394 --> 00:29:28,295
I can't do that.

496
00:29:28,363 --> 00:29:31,231
Sure you can.
Who'll know?

497
00:29:31,299 --> 00:29:33,467
The standard of ethics this
business is low enough.

498
00:29:33,535 --> 00:29:36,136
God knows I've done
some things I'm not proud of,

499
00:29:36,204 --> 00:29:38,105
But those other
agencies pay me.

500
00:29:38,173 --> 00:29:39,840
What about protecting
the clients?

501
00:29:39,908 --> 00:29:42,910
So I'm gonna kill my
business to save yours?

502
00:29:42,977 --> 00:29:45,646
It's not your business.
It's Atherton's. This is different.

503
00:29:45,714 --> 00:29:47,915
- This is everything to me.
- I don't believe this.

504
00:29:47,982 --> 00:29:50,617
You want a shoulder
to cry on, fine.

505
00:29:50,685 --> 00:29:53,487
You want to throw me to the wolves so
you can save your neck, forget it.

506
00:29:53,555 --> 00:29:55,522
- I would do it for you.
- I would never ask.

507
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:57,725
I would never use you like that

508
00:29:57,792 --> 00:29:59,226
Because I know the difference

509
00:29:59,294 --> 00:30:01,628
Between what we have
and this stupid office.

510
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:18,178
<i>Mr.
Cosgrove says Playtex just left the hotel.</i>

511
00:30:18,246 --> 00:30:20,013
Thank you.

512
00:30:20,081 --> 00:30:21,682
God, I'm so nervous.

513
00:30:22,817 --> 00:30:24,852
You need to relax.

514
00:30:24,919 --> 00:30:27,888
I can't do this drunk.

515
00:30:27,956 --> 00:30:29,923
I know a technique

516
00:30:29,991 --> 00:30:32,760
That can really take
the nerves away.

517
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:36,330
I learned it from a yogi.

518
00:30:42,103 --> 00:30:44,505
- Show me.
- Close your eyes.

519
00:30:44,572 --> 00:30:47,441
Take a deep breath.

520
00:30:47,509 --> 00:30:50,244
Fill your lungs
until you can't anymore.

521
00:30:51,713 --> 00:30:53,747
Stick out your stomach.

522
00:30:53,815 --> 00:30:56,750
Now release it in a cool
stream right in my face.

523
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,654
Hey!
What are you doing?

524
00:31:00,722 --> 00:31:02,723
You said you wanted
to relax, so...

525
00:31:02,791 --> 00:31:05,025
- Let's relax.
- Stan, no.

526
00:31:05,093 --> 00:31:08,262
Oh, come on. You're so horny I
can smell it on your breath.

527
00:31:08,329 --> 00:31:09,997
Stan, knock it off.

528
00:31:10,064 --> 00:31:12,900
Hey, I saw you with
the delivery boy yesterday.

529
00:31:12,967 --> 00:31:14,601
What?
He's my boyfriend.

530
00:31:14,669 --> 00:31:17,905
Oh, come on, baby.
It's the end of the world.

531
00:31:22,644 --> 00:31:24,378
Why do you keep
making me reject you?

532
00:31:26,447 --> 00:31:28,782
I was trying to do you a favor.

533
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:31,451
Well, thank you.
I'm not anxious anymore.

534
00:31:48,436 --> 00:31:51,672
- Should I get the door? - No.
It didn't get any worse.

535
00:31:51,739 --> 00:31:53,807
What exactly did he say?

536
00:31:53,875 --> 00:31:55,776
He said they were terrified
about the British

537
00:31:55,844 --> 00:31:58,011
Banning cigarette ads from TV
and they need to cut costs.

538
00:32:00,048 --> 00:32:01,715
Maybe it's a good time
to get out of this business.

539
00:32:01,783 --> 00:32:03,884
That's crap.
Sales were up 10%.

540
00:32:03,952 --> 00:32:06,320
You do what you can do.

541
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:10,490
David Montgomery's memorial
is in 40 minutes

542
00:32:10,558 --> 00:32:13,026
- At the River club.
- David Montgomery died?

543
00:32:13,094 --> 00:32:15,529
Well, there's
your silver lining.

544
00:32:15,597 --> 00:32:17,431
Who the hell
wants to go to that?

545
00:32:17,498 --> 00:32:19,233
We're trying to get
new accounts.

546
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,602
- Remember how to do that?
- You wanna dogpile on me?

547
00:32:21,669 --> 00:32:23,136
Saving that account
was impossible.

548
00:32:23,204 --> 00:32:24,872
Because you ignored it!

549
00:32:24,939 --> 00:32:27,007
One damn account
and you ignored it.

550
00:32:27,075 --> 00:32:29,009
You don't know what you're talking about.
Pete, explain it to him.

551
00:32:29,077 --> 00:32:30,577
You squeezed me
off of it, Roger.

552
00:32:30,645 --> 00:32:32,346
You wanted it all to yourself.

553
00:32:32,413 --> 00:32:34,281
He would have never
let this happen.

554
00:32:34,349 --> 00:32:36,149
But you do what you can
do which is nothing.

555
00:32:36,217 --> 00:32:38,585
Hey. You're the one who dragged
me into your amateur hour.

556
00:32:38,653 --> 00:32:40,821
I was perfectly happy
where I was.

557
00:32:40,889 --> 00:32:43,257
Why did I do it?
Out of friendship.

558
00:32:43,324 --> 00:32:45,525
But now that the account's gone,
I guess that went with it.

559
00:32:45,593 --> 00:32:48,295
Get out of here, all of you.
Go Chase a hearse.

560
00:32:49,764 --> 00:32:50,831
Sorry to interrupt.

561
00:32:50,899 --> 00:32:52,766
Mr. Campbell,
your father-in-law called.

562
00:32:52,834 --> 00:32:55,202
Your wife and your daughter
are resting comfortably.

563
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:57,437
Oh.
Just now?

564
00:32:57,505 --> 00:32:59,940
Yes, it happened.
You've got a baby girl.

565
00:33:00,008 --> 00:33:02,509
- Congratulations.
- Good job.

566
00:33:02,577 --> 00:33:04,778
Thank you, Megan.

567
00:33:06,748 --> 00:33:10,884
- Okay, we should get going.
- Let me get my coat.

568
00:33:18,393 --> 00:33:19,626
Where does draper get off?

569
00:33:21,429 --> 00:33:23,931
Lee garner Jr.
Never took you seriously

570
00:33:23,998 --> 00:33:26,099
Because you never
took yourself seriously.

571
00:33:37,545 --> 00:33:39,179
- Are you ready?
- Mmm.

572
00:33:40,281 --> 00:33:42,249
No hard feelings?

573
00:33:42,317 --> 00:33:44,551
None at all.

574
00:33:44,619 --> 00:33:46,286
Everything good?

575
00:33:48,656 --> 00:33:49,856
Absolutely.

576
00:33:51,592 --> 00:33:53,527
And so I think
about that night...

577
00:33:53,594 --> 00:33:57,197
Staring out the window
of that Detroit hotel room,

578
00:33:57,265 --> 00:34:00,834
Knowing we were
going home with Buick

579
00:34:00,902 --> 00:34:03,804
And saying to David,

580
00:34:03,871 --> 00:34:06,440
"is this the best thing
we're ever going to do?"

581
00:34:08,176 --> 00:34:11,545
Lynn, it was
your fifth birthday.

582
00:34:11,612 --> 00:34:14,815
<i>The next day when we
were in the airport,</i>

583
00:34:14,882 --> 00:34:17,617
<i>He showed me this pendant he'd
bought the day before downtown.</i>

584
00:34:17,685 --> 00:34:20,487
As he closed the box, he said,

585
00:34:20,555 --> 00:34:24,725
"Crosby, that's the best
thing I'll ever do."

586
00:34:24,792 --> 00:34:26,960
I know it's hard,

587
00:34:27,028 --> 00:34:29,262
But Dave loved you more
than anything, sweetheart.

588
00:34:32,233 --> 00:34:34,835
That's Stu
Carlsbad from Ralston Purina.

589
00:34:34,902 --> 00:34:36,837
He's always ripe.

590
00:34:36,904 --> 00:34:38,905
We have dog food experience.

591
00:34:38,973 --> 00:34:40,774
I've got him.

592
00:34:40,842 --> 00:34:42,743
<i>I don't know
how prepared I am,</i>

593
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:45,412
But Dave was always
a fan of winging it.

594
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:51,284
Beth, his beautiful wife.

595
00:34:51,352 --> 00:34:53,020
You were there
before he made partner

596
00:34:53,087 --> 00:34:54,755
And then you gave him to us,

597
00:34:54,822 --> 00:34:57,491
<i>But you know
you and Lynnie</i>

598
00:34:57,558 --> 00:35:00,260
<i>Were always
on his mind.</i>

599
00:35:00,328 --> 00:35:02,129
True story.

600
00:35:02,196 --> 00:35:05,032
We'd been in London
for three months

601
00:35:05,099 --> 00:35:06,867
Trying to nail down
British petroleum.

602
00:35:08,369 --> 00:35:11,571
<i>Never happened.</i>

603
00:35:11,639 --> 00:35:14,441
But once a week he would
drag me to Portobello road

604
00:35:14,509 --> 00:35:17,711
Looking for thimbles
for your collection, Lynn.

605
00:35:17,779 --> 00:35:20,547
<i>Silver thimbles.</i>

606
00:35:20,615 --> 00:35:22,449
<i>And he was an expert.</i>

607
00:35:26,521 --> 00:35:28,789
It's because Playtex
is strong enough

608
00:35:28,856 --> 00:35:30,590
To protect a woman's hands.

609
00:35:30,658 --> 00:35:34,194
Through her fingertips, she
can dry the tears of a child

610
00:35:34,262 --> 00:35:38,498
<i>Or feel the warmth
of her husband's skin.</i>

611
00:35:38,566 --> 00:35:40,734
Playtex protects
a woman's touch.

612
00:35:44,338 --> 00:35:47,040
It's very romantic.
I have to admit

613
00:35:47,108 --> 00:35:50,410
When you first brought it up, I didn't
think that was possible for latex gloves.

614
00:35:50,478 --> 00:35:52,345
These images are
about the moments

615
00:35:52,413 --> 00:35:54,981
<i>After the housework
is over.</i>

616
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:02,022
They're about
the meaningful life

617
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:04,091
A woman leads
when work is done.

618
00:36:05,793 --> 00:36:07,594
Well, I feel pretty
good about this.

619
00:36:07,662 --> 00:36:08,829
Peggy, our pleasure.

620
00:36:10,865 --> 00:36:12,632
We're thrilled to get this
in the first try.

621
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,568
Well, I'm gonna let you
get back to the hotel

622
00:36:14,635 --> 00:36:16,436
And then steaks and a show.

623
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:24,411
That went well.

624
00:36:24,479 --> 00:36:26,179
You have lipstick
all over your teeth.

625
00:36:26,247 --> 00:36:27,981
What?

626
00:36:47,957 --> 00:36:50,425
- Why are you still here?
- I didn't know if I should leave or not.

627
00:36:50,493 --> 00:36:54,229
- How was the funeral?
- We'll see.

628
00:36:54,297 --> 00:36:56,164
Get me the campaign briefs
on Ken's accounts

629
00:36:56,232 --> 00:36:57,966
And then you can go.

630
00:36:58,034 --> 00:36:59,468
And send Peggy in.

631
00:37:15,518 --> 00:37:16,918
Miss Olson's gone r the night,

632
00:37:16,986 --> 00:37:18,820
- But if you need help...
- did you do that?

633
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:23,391
I thought in the end you
wouldn't want to throw it away.

634
00:37:25,528 --> 00:37:27,529
You're wrong.

635
00:37:27,597 --> 00:37:28,897
That commercial was great

636
00:37:28,965 --> 00:37:30,765
And nothing they do
can change that.

637
00:37:32,401 --> 00:37:33,935
I'll take those.

638
00:37:37,507 --> 00:37:39,674
Thank you.
You can go.

639
00:37:43,579 --> 00:37:45,280
You sure you don't
want some help?

640
00:37:45,348 --> 00:37:47,849
This is a little complicated.

641
00:37:47,917 --> 00:37:51,253
That's okay. I'd really like
to learn what goes on here.

642
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,988
Really.

643
00:37:53,055 --> 00:37:55,357
Well, first of all,
I think it would help me

644
00:37:55,424 --> 00:37:57,692
From making mistakes with
your work the way I have.

645
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,795
And secondly,

646
00:38:00,863 --> 00:38:03,265
I think I'd like eventually
to do what you do

647
00:38:03,332 --> 00:38:04,833
Or what miss Olson does.

648
00:38:07,103 --> 00:38:09,371
- I didn't know that.
- Unless you'd rather be alone.

649
00:38:09,438 --> 00:38:10,906
I don't want to be in the way.

650
00:38:10,973 --> 00:38:13,008
No.
I don't mind.

651
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,788
This is a strategy statement

652
00:38:26,856 --> 00:38:30,392
Signed by Fillmore auto parts.

653
00:38:32,261 --> 00:38:34,930
Copywriters stray from
these midstream sometimes

654
00:38:34,997 --> 00:38:36,965
If they have a better idea,

655
00:38:37,033 --> 00:38:38,733
But we can't take
that chance now.

656
00:38:38,801 --> 00:38:41,269
Wouldn't clients
want a better idea?

657
00:38:45,074 --> 00:38:47,375
What'd you like
about the commercial?

658
00:38:49,278 --> 00:38:50,812
You're putting me
on the spot. Um...

659
00:38:52,748 --> 00:38:56,484
I know it's a floor wax, but I
really remember that feeling

660
00:38:56,552 --> 00:38:58,553
Of being a little kid

661
00:38:58,621 --> 00:39:01,489
And feeling like I was being punished
when my mother cleaned the house.

662
00:39:03,626 --> 00:39:05,427
- Where are you from?
- Montreal.

663
00:39:05,494 --> 00:39:07,729
We didn't have glo-coat.

664
00:39:07,797 --> 00:39:10,966
- Why'd you move here?
- Well, first of all, it's New York.

665
00:39:11,033 --> 00:39:12,901
For an artist, it's mecca.

666
00:39:12,969 --> 00:39:14,669
You're an artist?

667
00:39:14,737 --> 00:39:16,838
I wouldn't say I'm an artist.

668
00:39:16,906 --> 00:39:19,207
I'm an artistic person.
I majored in literature

669
00:39:19,275 --> 00:39:22,010
And I've dabbled
in writing and painting

670
00:39:22,078 --> 00:39:24,079
And a little bit of acting.

671
00:39:27,783 --> 00:39:29,217
What are you laughing about?

672
00:39:29,285 --> 00:39:30,885
Because I just realized

673
00:39:30,953 --> 00:39:32,821
I know everything about you.

674
00:39:32,888 --> 00:39:34,823
I mean, you're in
my head all day,

675
00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:38,059
Even when I go home.
And you don't know anything about me.

676
00:39:38,127 --> 00:39:40,695
<i>Well, you haven't
been here that long.</i>

677
00:39:40,763 --> 00:39:43,331
And you don't know
how long I will be,

678
00:39:43,399 --> 00:39:45,000
So why get to know me?

679
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:51,239
I can see that's what
everybody must think.

680
00:39:51,307 --> 00:39:53,308
You judge people on their work.

681
00:39:53,376 --> 00:39:55,677
I'm the same way.

682
00:39:57,079 --> 00:39:58,913
Everything else is sentimental.

683
00:40:02,184 --> 00:40:04,452
- You want one?
- How many is that?

684
00:40:07,556 --> 00:40:10,358
Four.

685
00:40:15,164 --> 00:40:18,533
I know you're angry, but
I hope you're not afraid

686
00:40:18,601 --> 00:40:20,368
Because you will
get through this.

687
00:40:22,772 --> 00:40:24,205
You don't know that.

688
00:40:26,409 --> 00:40:28,043
Why do you care what I think?

689
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:42,424
Megan, I don't think
this is a good idea.

690
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,894
This has nothing
to do with work.

691
00:40:54,203 --> 00:40:56,638
I can't make
any mistakes right now.

692
00:40:59,341 --> 00:41:01,409
Let's be clear.

693
00:41:01,477 --> 00:41:03,411
I'm not gonna run out of
here crying tomorrow.

694
00:41:05,181 --> 00:41:07,082
I just want you right now.

695
00:41:29,371 --> 00:41:31,439
Hey.
Where are you going?

696
00:41:33,209 --> 00:41:35,744
I'm exhausted.

697
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,315
How was your day?

698
00:41:40,382 --> 00:41:41,950
Fine.

699
00:41:42,017 --> 00:41:43,985
I know how to make it better.

700
00:41:44,053 --> 00:41:46,554
I'm really tired.

701
00:41:46,622 --> 00:41:48,123
Sit down.

702
00:42:00,336 --> 00:42:01,836
What'd you buy?

703
00:42:03,372 --> 00:42:05,306
Look.

704
00:42:11,847 --> 00:42:13,515
Look at it.

705
00:42:21,924 --> 00:42:24,058
Sign it.

706
00:42:41,544 --> 00:42:43,444
"to my loving wife."

707
00:42:58,994 --> 00:43:00,895
I'm so proud of you.

708
00:43:20,449 --> 00:43:23,051
You should go first.
Actually, I should go first.

709
00:43:32,027 --> 00:43:33,661
Do you want to grab a bite?

710
00:43:35,231 --> 00:43:36,931
I want you to go home

711
00:43:36,999 --> 00:43:39,000
And I want you to sleep.

712
00:43:39,068 --> 00:43:41,536
And I don't want you
drinking any more tonight.

713
00:43:54,917 --> 00:43:56,818
Wait. Did you want
to go first?

714
00:43:58,988 --> 00:44:00,655
Good night, Mr. Draper.

715
00:44:15,671 --> 00:44:17,572
Didn't expect to see you here.

716
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:20,174
I was gonna call,

717
00:44:20,242 --> 00:44:22,844
But I didn't want
to do this over the phone.

718
00:44:22,912 --> 00:44:25,146
So you were gonna write it
on an envelope.

719
00:44:25,214 --> 00:44:27,715
Can I come inside?

720
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:53,908
I got you a meeting with Heinz.

721
00:44:56,078 --> 00:44:59,414
It's vinegar, sauces and beans.

722
00:44:59,481 --> 00:45:02,016
They're at Ketchum Macleod
and they're restless.

723
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,421
- Faye.
- I thought about what you said,

724
00:45:06,488 --> 00:45:08,990
I thought about you...

725
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:14,262
And I thought about... whatever.
You are my life right now.

726
00:45:17,266 --> 00:45:19,500
You didn't have to do this.

727
00:45:22,371 --> 00:45:23,371
I wanted to.

728
00:45:37,152 --> 00:45:38,886
Thank you.

729
00:45:40,055 --> 00:45:41,522
You're welcome.

730
00:45:45,127 --> 00:45:46,894
Do you wanna stay?

731
00:45:48,597 --> 00:45:50,932
I'll probably
fall asleep on you.

732
00:46:06,115 --> 00:46:07,615
Just sit with me.

733
00:46:40,182 --> 00:46:43,985
<i>âª welcome to my world âª</i>

734
00:46:46,855 --> 00:46:49,991
<i>âª won't you come on in? âª</i>

735
00:46:52,795 --> 00:46:55,930
<i>âª miracles, I guess âª</i>

736
00:46:58,333 --> 00:47:01,102
<i>âª still happen now and then âª</i>

737
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:05,593
<i>âª step into my heart âª</i>

738
00:47:05,594 --> 00:47:07,400
