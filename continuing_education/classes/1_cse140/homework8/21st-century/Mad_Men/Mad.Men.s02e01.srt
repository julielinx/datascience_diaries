1
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:31,913
Sit up straight.

2
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,427
Heels down. Lighten your hands.

3
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:40,223
Good girl.

4
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:44,834
There we go.

5
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:49,271
Now, if you can step over here.

6
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,448
You're a big one.

7
00:01:58,551 --> 00:01:59,848
Thank you, Lilly.

8
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:03,181
Have a seat.

9
00:02:04,657 --> 00:02:06,420
So, Mr. Draper,

10
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:09,984
you haven't had a physical
in quite some time.

11
00:02:10,096 --> 00:02:11,427
I eat a lot of apples.

12
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:15,027
What is it with you boys?

13
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:18,070
Why does it take an insurance physical
to get you in here?

14
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:32,476
What's the number?

15
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:36,151
Because that will
mean something to you?

16
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:37,848
It's 160 over 100,

17
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:39,549
which is high for boys our age.

18
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,524
Tell me about your parents.

19
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:43,220
Living or deceased?

20
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,694
Dead. Both.

21
00:02:44,797 --> 00:02:45,889
Ages?

22
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,864
My dad was 41, 42.

23
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:49,366
He died in an accident,

24
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:51,494
and my mother died in childbirth.

25
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:53,299
She was 22, I think.

26
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:55,567
How many drinks do you have a day?

27
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,472
Wine, cocktails, beer.

28
00:02:57,577 --> 00:03:00,705
Everything depends on the day.

29
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:03,304
Days of plenty being?

30
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:04,940
Three.

31
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:07,918
You're a high-powered businessman
with a high-tension job.

32
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,989
I'm trying to help you here.

33
00:03:10,089 --> 00:03:11,113
Five.

34
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:13,089
And two packs a day,
but you're cutting down.

35
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,558
Yes.

36
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:15,958
All right.

37
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:18,462
Any changes in the last year?

38
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:19,589
What do you mean?

39
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:20,791
In your health.

40
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,425
How do you feel when
you wake up in the morning?

41
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:24,560
How do you feel?

42
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:26,332
You live too hard,

43
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:27,701
and not just at the office.

44
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:30,435
It'll hit you all at once.

45
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:37,311
Nope. No, I've been... I've been good.

46
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:41,820
All right, I'm going to write you
some reserpine to bring that down

47
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:45,357
and some phenobarbital to help you relax.

48
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,483
You're 36 years old.

49
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:50,620
You need to take this seriously.

50
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,925
Buy a boat.

51
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:54,590
Breathe in.

52
00:03:57,103 --> 00:03:59,128
So I wait for Becky to go play,

53
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,763
and I look in her pencil case.

54
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:02,602
There's almost 20 dimes.

55
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:04,472
She stopped eating lunch.

56
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,670
I hate the dishonesty.

57
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:08,713
You should be glad
she watches what she eats.

58
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:10,874
That's the truth. She is slimming down.

59
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:12,417
Good morning, ladies.

60
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,881
You want to get off right here?

61
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:17,547
You can go right to your car.

62
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:19,784
No.

63
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:25,029
He's a prisoner of war.

64
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:27,065
Because he can't ride.

65
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:29,327
A man that age doesn't
suddenly take this up.

66
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,266
He's 25.

67
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:32,736
Did he tell you that?

68
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,500
I think so.

69
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,871
He talks to me. He's engaged.

70
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:39,604
There's no point in being aloof.

71
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:42,272
I wouldn't know what to talk about.

72
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:45,351
Aren't you funny? Are you scandalized?

73
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,442
No.

74
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:49,885
Well, if you must know,
we talk about you

75
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:52,219
and how Gertie has a crush on you.

76
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:54,259
She's a sadist.

77
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,884
I'll see you Saturday.

78
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,898
Don't you hate getting manure in that?

79
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:03,025
Little children. What's the difference?

80
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:16,774
Look, miss,
just tell me where you want it.

81
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:19,511
I could take out the lockers
and use that wall.

82
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:20,779
The break room?

83
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:22,115
Don't take away the break room.

84
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:24,212
I'm not taking away anything.

85
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,519
Believe me, this machine
is a gift to you girls.

86
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:29,026
Happy Valentine's, girls.

87
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:31,062
How are you going to wear
that around your neck?

88
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,893
It's much bigger than they said it was.

89
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,193
I think it needs an office.

90
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,767
Come on.

91
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:38,359
We're already doubling up.
Don't do that.

92
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:40,439
My roommate works at Ernst & Ernst.

93
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,735
She did her birthday party
invitations on this.

94
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,309
On colored paper.

95
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:47,641
I told you, miss,
I'll try as many places as you want.

96
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:52,110
Maybe we should leave it
here for the time being.

97
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,192
I don't care. I'm doing this.

98
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:11,760
If you think that if you start eating,
we're all going to join you, you're wrong.

99
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,704
Look, Don's not one
to stand on ceremony.

100
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:16,638
He's not going to care.

101
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:19,268
I made it. I knew Draper would be late.

102
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,846
I have some crackers in my desk.

103
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:23,839
So, burning the midnight oil.

104
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,577
S'all right.

105
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:27,084
Hope the words are good

106
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:28,380
'cause he ain't got any artwork.

107
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:30,285
You didn't have time to give it to Art?

108
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,950
You want to start living here?

109
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:36,517
I'm supposed to be at The Pen and Pencil
by 12:30 every day.

110
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:37,755
I was promised.

111
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:39,764
Look, Freddie, the eating is the thing.

112
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:41,231
I'm sure you can have a drink.

113
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:43,165
It's an unspoken agreement.

114
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:45,169
I got you, Freddie.

115
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:48,933
Are these all the glasses, Peggy?

116
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:51,303
I don't know.

117
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,038
We have artwork.

118
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:58,909
Peggy, go see if we can expect Don today.

119
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,891
That's a good idea.

120
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:08,552
Draper's not going to yell at her.

121
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:10,754
You want to be alone with that?

122
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:12,694
I'm telling you, Draper knocked her up.

123
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:14,289
She goes away for a couple of months,

124
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,061
drops about 9 pounds, 8 ounces,

125
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:17,534
comes back with a job.

126
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:19,867
Don's been screwing me
for the last three years.

127
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:21,064
I've got nothing.

128
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:24,741
What's everybody laughing at?

129
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:28,507
The great debate wages on
about Peggy Olson's charmed career.

130
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:30,514
Fat farm.

131
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,345
I thought we had verification.

132
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:37,153
Do you have any idea when
you'll be expecting Mr. Draper?

133
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:40,054
I was expecting him
at the beginning of work today,

134
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:42,753
but then he called and said he'd be late.

135
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:44,921
He said he was going to the movies.

136
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:46,589
Pinocchio.

137
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,430
Thank you.

138
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:57,173
Are you insinuating something?

139
00:07:58,444 --> 00:08:01,379
I wasn't doing anything, I don't think.

140
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,915
Well, I believe that.

141
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:05,313
I want you to imagine,

142
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:06,578
when you talk about Mr. Draper,

143
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:08,916
that he's standing right behind you.

144
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:10,886
And think about that
whenever you speak of him.

145
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,652
Are you going to tell on me?

146
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,886
I didn't know. What did I do?

147
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,485
Do you know where Mr. Draper is?

148
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:19,087
No, I don't.

149
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:21,325
I think he was joking.

150
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:25,871
Lois, do you know where Mr. Draper is?

151
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:30,237
He's out.

152
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,709
Thank you, Lois.

153
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,971
How is it?

154
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,873
He wrote some of it here.

155
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:07,412
Some of it on 23rd Street,
some place they tore down.

156
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:10,607
Makes you feel better
about sitting in a bar at lunch.

157
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:13,014
Makes you feel like you're
getting something done.

158
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:16,316
Yeah. It's all about getting things done.

159
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,121
Is it good?

160
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,957
I don't think you'd like it.

161
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:32,666
You wanted to see me?

162
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:35,741
I wanted to see that Valentine heart.

163
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:38,036
On my way out. Anything else?

164
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:41,011
I'm taking Mona to Lutèce.

165
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:42,876
Let me hear what the living are up to.

166
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:44,108
You love her.

167
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:46,275
What happened to the Jewish doctor?

168
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:47,613
He's not Jewish.

169
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,051
Not anymore, but he was. Trust me.

170
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:50,213
Is he still a doctor?

171
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:51,847
You sound like a little girl.

172
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,084
What do you care?

173
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,560
I wish you every happiness.

174
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:59,654
I'm well aware this is vicarious.
I already said that.

175
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,892
I already know what day
he's going to ask me.

176
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:03,400
Does he know that?

177
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:06,801
Because I have a feeling
there's a penalty for passing that date.

178
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:09,773
He knows.

179
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,871
Mr. Phillips here to see you.

180
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,106
Send him in.

181
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:18,878
Joan.

182
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:20,350
Did you girls get my candy?

183
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:23,422
Yes. It was appreciated
and yet unappreciated.

184
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:25,319
Anything else?

185
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:28,359
No, thank you. That'll be all.

186
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,292
Got a second?

187
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,362
Nothing good ever started
with that sentence.

188
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,936
It's not that. It's Martinson's Coffee.

189
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:40,597
I'm excited about the possibility
of that happening,

190
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:41,968
and, as you recall,

191
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:43,701
Martinson's Coffee has a unique problem.

192
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:46,039
Good. We like that.

193
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,544
Well, that's just it.

194
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,808
No one under 25 drinks coffee anymore.

195
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:51,246
Just Pepsi.

196
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:52,749
They pour it on their Frosted Flakes.

197
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:55,252
For those who think young.

198
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:56,844
Which is why I was
disappointed to see Don

199
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:58,355
put Fred Rumsen on this.

200
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:00,084
So Freddie doesn't drink coffee.

201
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:01,591
He doesn't wear a bra, either.

202
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:03,457
He managed to do a good job on Playtex.

203
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:05,792
It's frustrating not to have
young people around here.

204
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:07,024
We're a young country.

205
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:08,225
The president has a baby.

206
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,528
Have you been out there?

207
00:11:09,635 --> 00:11:11,500
It's rotten with kids.

208
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:13,435
And the cologne they wear.

209
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:15,632
Real kids. 25. Even less.

210
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:16,901
Maybe one of those teams.

211
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,670
The writer and the artist together.

212
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:20,336
Clients keep bringing it up.

213
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:22,937
Talk to Don about it.
Just for Martinson's Coffee alone.

214
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:25,381
Can't you talk to Don about it?

215
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:27,418
I thought this was the way
things were done here.

216
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,681
Didn't you tell me you were a bridge
between Accounts and Don?

217
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:32,383
Doesn't sound like me.

218
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:34,288
Look, Don has talent.

219
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:36,327
You know how to deal
with that, don't you?

220
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:37,487
Just assume that he knows

221
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:39,325
as much about business as you do,

222
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:42,492
but inside there's a child
who likes getting his way.

223
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:44,796
He's not my first creative director.

224
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:47,668
This is about a sales reality
and not personal territory.

225
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:51,209
It's what the clients are asking for,
and we need to have it.

226
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:54,279
What's the best way to make it happen?

227
00:11:57,983 --> 00:11:59,177
Mr. Draper.

228
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:00,411
Any calls?

229
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:01,918
Yes, and there was your 12:00

230
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:03,716
in the conference room.

231
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:08,690
Of course.

232
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,169
Well, girls can say whatever they want.

233
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,430
They want the chocolates.

234
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:21,335
Right, Peggy?

235
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,839
Of course they do.

236
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:25,843
I don't do anything.
Keeps them off balance.

237
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:27,572
Hey, chief.

238
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:30,742
Sorry we're late.

239
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:34,650
I think the little ones need to eat.

240
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,779
What do we have? Dale, wake up.

241
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:38,720
I could just go.

242
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:40,348
Or Kinsey.

243
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:41,926
You want to go first?

244
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,521
Peggy.

245
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:47,224
I just wrote copy for Dale.

246
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:55,468
Well, this is kind of the gist,
because I was...

247
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:57,508
Well, we were...

248
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,907
It just kept changing course.

249
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:04,707
"Mohawk Airlines.
There's a new chief in the sky."

250
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:07,581
And I thought, following that,

251
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:09,586
"Most routes to Boston.

252
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:11,713
Circle the wagons,
we've got it surrounded."

253
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:15,419
And there'd be wagons
around a dot that says "Boston."

254
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:17,393
I can almost picture it. Sal.

255
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:19,259
This is the first time
I'm hearing it, too.

256
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:22,198
So it's about an airline
that's flown by Indians?

257
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:25,236
Maybe a plane with some arrows
stuck in the cargo door?

258
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:26,531
That's funny.

259
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,403
That's what gets people's
attention now, right?

260
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:30,702
There has to be advertising

261
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,573
for people who don't
have a sense of humor.

262
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:33,872
I understand, Don.

263
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,606
What else you got?

264
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:37,841
Several more Indian puns.

265
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:40,441
Stop writing for other writers.

266
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:47,324
Luxury, service.

267
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:49,621
A lot of people are afraid of turbulence,

268
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:51,252
so it's dead calm.

269
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:53,797
Look how level those drinks are.

270
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:55,696
"Wherever Mohawk takes us."

271
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:57,291
Or, "You'll love getting there."

272
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:58,597
What's outside that window?

273
00:13:58,704 --> 00:14:00,763
- Fluffy clouds.
- Research.

274
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:03,501
I get on a plane,
I don't care where I'm going.

275
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:06,100
I just want to see the city
disappearing behind me.

276
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:09,045
So we could take the clouds
out of there and put in the city.

277
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:10,445
The Chrysler Building.

278
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,518
That Indian...

279
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:19,356
It's not about the majestic beauty
of the Mohawk Nation.

280
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:25,753
It's about adventure.

281
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,766
Could be a pirate.

282
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,335
Could be a knight in shining armor.

283
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:34,668
Could be a conquistador
getting off of a boat.

284
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:38,038
It's about a fantastical people

285
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:41,840
who are taking you someplace
where you've never been.

286
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:53,653
We could dress the stew
as Pocahontas.

287
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:55,158
With the cheekbones.

288
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:56,888
How's his wife going to feel about that?

289
00:14:56,996 --> 00:15:00,022
Air travel's too expensive
to waste on your wife.

290
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:01,827
You want to get
on a plane to feel alive.

291
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:05,131
You want to get on a plane
to see just the hint of a woman's thigh

292
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:08,570
because her skirt
is just this much too short.

293
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,073
Friday?

294
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:13,303
Tomorrow.

295
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:17,145
What does that mean?

296
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:20,150
It means you want to go somewhere,
go up her skirt.

297
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,379
That's the impression I got.

298
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:28,186
Carla, Bobby's turning blue out there.

299
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:32,020
Did somebody get a lot of valentines?

300
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:35,225
They made everybody
give one to everybody else.

301
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:37,097
That defeats the purpose.

302
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:38,499
They had a party.

303
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,936
I see. Fruit punch?

304
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,564
I'm making this for Daddy.

305
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:43,835
It's beautiful.

306
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,934
I'll see that he gets it.

307
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:48,036
Mommy, can I do it?

308
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:49,580
Okay.

309
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:55,552
I want to go riding with you.

310
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:57,679
- You can't.
- Well, why?

311
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,849
Well, for one thing, it's too dangerous.

312
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,449
No, it's not.

313
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:05,291
Do you remember what happened
to the little girl in Gone With the Wind?

314
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:08,627
You are taking a bath tonight.

315
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:20,874
They say once you start drinking alone,
you're an alcoholic.

316
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,948
I'm really trying to avoid that.

317
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:24,948
So I guess I'm helping both of us.

318
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:27,712
Cooper wants younger people.

319
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,946
For what purpose?

320
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:30,453
Martinson's Coffee.

321
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:33,024
Last time Freddie Rumsen
had a cup of coffee,

322
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:36,219
it was one of five being poured
down his throat by a cop.

323
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:41,559
Well, young campaigns don't necessarily
come from young people.

324
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:42,793
The clients like it.

325
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:46,701
The clients like the thrill of young talent.

326
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:48,500
So what am I supposed to do?

327
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:49,767
Dangle a Pepsi out the window

328
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:51,706
and see if I can hook a stroller?

329
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,675
I have some candidates.

330
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,277
This smells like Accounts to me.

331
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:58,350
I had Paul Kinsey make up a list.

332
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,714
He had no idea he was signing
his own death warrant.

333
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,285
You want younger people than that?

334
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:05,619
What do you want me to say?

335
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:10,388
Tell Duck clients don't understand.

336
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:15,559
Their success is related to standing out,
not fitting in.

337
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:17,760
It's a fad.

338
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,167
Paint him a picture.

339
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:23,731
Something like one wants to be
the needle in the haystack,

340
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:25,639
not a haystack.

341
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:28,542
Donald, isn't it possible
that the recently weaned

342
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:31,343
have some unique perspective?

343
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,441
Joy, enthusiasm.

344
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:36,043
You're talking as if they're
some fresh version of us.

345
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:37,850
They're not.

346
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:42,757
Young people don't know anything,
especially that they're young.

347
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:48,959
Well, let me set this
in a more appealing context for you.

348
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,002
Prove him wrong.

349
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:09,342
Happy Valentine's Day.

350
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:17,852
I love this place.

351
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:19,116
I know.

352
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:20,316
So what are we doing?

353
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:24,259
Don't worry, we will be out of here
before the singer starts.

354
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:27,365
Juanita?

355
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:29,627
Betsy Hofstadt.

356
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:32,067
Look at you.

357
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,297
This is so nice.

358
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:35,635
Don, believe it or not, you two have met.

359
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:37,003
I don't think we have, Bets.

360
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:38,303
- Don Draper.
- Hello.

361
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:39,468
A pleasure to meet you.

362
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:40,602
A pleasure.

363
00:19:40,712 --> 00:19:42,907
Juanita was one of my roommates
when I lived on the West Side.

364
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,448
We were models together.

365
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,074
In that horrible apartment.

366
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,345
Do you live in the city?

367
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:48,817
Well, I do.

368
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:50,115
Curtis is from Detroit.

369
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:52,053
Automobiles.

370
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:53,715
How are you?

371
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:56,225
I work as a decorator.

372
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:57,488
How exciting.

373
00:19:57,596 --> 00:19:59,894
I have a little girl and boy.

374
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:01,932
Of course you do.

375
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:05,162
It looks like everything's going well.

376
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,828
My God, that stone.

377
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:08,907
That was a gift.

378
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:10,998
Give me your phone number.

379
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:12,940
Tell me how I can reach you.

380
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:16,173
Does anyone have a business card?

381
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:20,974
I do.

382
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:28,417
I would love a nice long lunch.

383
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:31,496
So nice to see you.

384
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:42,005
That is not who I thought
she would end up with.

385
00:20:42,107 --> 00:20:43,904
I don't think it's permanent.

386
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:48,936
Can you imagine still dating at our age?

387
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:51,174
She's a party girl, Bets.

388
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:55,182
Really?

389
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:56,879
Really.

390
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:59,048
And how do you know that?

391
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:03,552
Well?

392
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:05,892
How stupid do you think I am?

393
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,693
Juanita Carson.

394
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,273
Should I get another one here?

395
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:20,845
What are we doing?

396
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:25,110
How does room service sound?

397
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:04,985
I came prepared.

398
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:13,728
I suppose people get lonely.

399
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,891
And it's Valentine's Day.

400
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,868
Be mine for $100.

401
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:20,961
How much is it, do you think?

402
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:27,736
I told her I wanted to have
hundreds of babies with you.

403
00:22:43,128 --> 00:22:45,028
Wow.

404
00:22:53,438 --> 00:22:54,666
Hello, lovely.

405
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:56,400
Hello.

406
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:04,878
Happy Valentine's.

407
00:23:04,983 --> 00:23:06,473
That's so sweet.

408
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:07,950
I got your little note.

409
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:10,578
Well, Hildy did.

410
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:15,888
You have to be careful
about just putting things in my bag.

411
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:18,189
Come on, open them. I want one.

412
00:23:18,296 --> 00:23:19,957
Okay.

413
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:30,100
The round ones are coconut.

414
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:33,507
Should've got the kind
where they put that chart in the box.

415
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:36,046
I spoke with Jennifer Crane.

416
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:38,013
She's expecting.

417
00:23:38,116 --> 00:23:39,276
That's impossible.

418
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:40,544
Harry didn't tell me anything.

419
00:23:40,652 --> 00:23:42,813
That's because he doesn't know.

420
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:46,379
She's going to surprise him tonight.

421
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:50,461
I just got so distracted.

422
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:52,120
Dinner's not for an hour.

423
00:23:56,568 --> 00:23:57,865
Tweety.

424
00:23:59,237 --> 00:24:01,831
There's no reason that's bad for us.

425
00:24:04,142 --> 00:24:05,734
I saw this dumpy woman
on Second Avenue

426
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:07,436
by the Hungarian market.

427
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:09,446
And she had her daughter
pushing a stroller

428
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:11,209
with a little boy in it.

429
00:24:12,417 --> 00:24:13,975
And she was round.

430
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:16,417
She was expecting another.

431
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:20,457
She was just buying fruit
like it was any other day.

432
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,356
The daughter was pregnant.

433
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,224
No.

434
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:25,762
The mother.

435
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:30,659
It's this big club they're all in together.

436
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:32,999
Even her.

437
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:37,063
Well, rest assured.

438
00:24:37,175 --> 00:24:39,666
She doesn't have what you have.

439
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:41,211
Jennifer Crane does.

440
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:46,048
Do you really believe that?

441
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:49,350
I guess not.

442
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:24,620
Hold on.

443
00:25:25,957 --> 00:25:27,390
What's wrong?

444
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:37,359
Don, it's okay.

445
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:39,300
We've got all night.

446
00:26:04,162 --> 00:26:07,723
I wish you would just
tell me what to do.

447
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:24,504
We drank too much, you know.

448
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:26,516
I don't even know where I am.

449
00:26:31,056 --> 00:26:32,353
You should eat something.

450
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,226
Hello. Yes.

451
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:46,304
This is Mr. Draper in room 804.

452
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:53,340
Yes. Can you send up some vichyssoise
and a BLT on white toast?

453
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,037
No. Shrimp cocktail.

454
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:56,738
Two of them. Scratch that.

455
00:26:56,848 --> 00:26:58,475
Two shrimp cocktails, please.

456
00:26:58,583 --> 00:26:59,982
Wait a minute.

457
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,653
Hello.

458
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:08,089
Yeah. Do you have anything special?

459
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:09,490
Anything out of season?

460
00:27:11,262 --> 00:27:12,786
This piano was designed

461
00:27:12,897 --> 00:27:14,421
by Franklin Roosevelt...

462
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:17,629
Oh, leave that.

463
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:18,794
That's so complicated.

464
00:27:18,903 --> 00:27:19,961
How about this?

465
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:22,665
I want a half avocado filled with crabmeat

466
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:25,504
and a rare petite filet.

467
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:26,668
Two place settings.

468
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:28,746
And if it's an American company

469
00:27:28,847 --> 00:27:31,247
that you can help, I like to do that.

470
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:34,375
If it's not, just as long as it's the best.

471
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,386
I rather love this hall.

472
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,388
It has all the colors one thinks of

473
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,287
when one thinks of the White House...

474
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:42,952
red and white and blue and gold.

475
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:45,928
It's through this door that
all the heads of state come.

476
00:27:46,031 --> 00:27:48,158
And this is where
the president meets them.

477
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:51,030
And here is where
the Marine band plays.

478
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:53,195
They have "Ruffles and Flourishes,"

479
00:27:53,304 --> 00:27:54,794
then "Hail to the Chief."

480
00:27:54,906 --> 00:27:57,033
And then there's a receiving line,

481
00:27:57,142 --> 00:27:58,973
and then everyone goes in to dinner here

482
00:27:59,077 --> 00:28:00,305
in the State Dining Room.

483
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:01,470
Where's her husband?

484
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:04,139
...though the table now is not
set up for that many.

485
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:06,046
Are there many state dinners?

486
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:07,311
Yes, there are.

487
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:10,911
There were almost
two a month last year.

488
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:13,013
This room's interesting

489
00:28:13,124 --> 00:28:15,718
because it has the most
architecturally unity

490
00:28:15,827 --> 00:28:17,192
of any room in the White House.

491
00:28:17,295 --> 00:28:19,092
It's really all 1902

492
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:22,758
when Theodore Roosevelt
took the great restoration

493
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:25,495
with McKim, Mead & White.

494
00:28:25,603 --> 00:28:29,061
Which of these pieces
have historical associations?

495
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:30,368
There are quite a few.

496
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:31,635
You have to see this.

497
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:33,005
...Dolly Madison's sofa.

498
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:34,305
That's Nelly Custis' sofa.

499
00:28:34,412 --> 00:28:35,811
No, I don't.

500
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:37,074
She was Washington's granddaughter.

501
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:38,911
I feel so strongly

502
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:42,043
that the White House
should have as fine a collection.

503
00:28:42,153 --> 00:28:44,485
It's so important, the setting in which

504
00:28:44,589 --> 00:28:47,114
the presidency is
presented to the world.

505
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:48,556
What do you think it is?

506
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,423
I don't know,

507
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:52,257
but I'm going to find out.

508
00:28:52,363 --> 00:28:54,831
And now a word from our sponsor.

509
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:01,235
Their armoire?

510
00:29:01,339 --> 00:29:03,569
I've seen them in Connecticut,
but they're copies.

511
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:05,074
You know, Jackie has a real one.

512
00:29:05,176 --> 00:29:06,507
In the White House?

513
00:29:06,611 --> 00:29:07,873
I think so.

514
00:29:07,979 --> 00:29:09,241
She seemed nervous.

515
00:29:09,347 --> 00:29:11,315
Even when she saw Jack at the end.

516
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:13,043
It was like they were playing house.

517
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:16,144
That's chocolate ice cream.

518
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:17,744
Or blood.

519
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:19,687
I couldn't throw it away.

520
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:21,122
It's French.

521
00:29:22,393 --> 00:29:24,588
We'll call it chocolate ice cream,
and I'll work on it.

522
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:28,956
Well, I'm sorry we missed it.

523
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:31,262
No time for television.

524
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:32,802
Stop rubbing it in.

525
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:34,462
Really. A room at the Savoy?

526
00:29:34,572 --> 00:29:35,869
That takes thought.

527
00:29:35,974 --> 00:29:38,442
Your night sounded very romantic.

528
00:29:38,543 --> 00:29:42,604
I would describe it
as delightfully disappointing.

529
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:44,341
There was a time when he overdid it,

530
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:46,644
but I'll take dull and know where I stand.

531
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:48,184
I agree.

532
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:51,513
What?

533
00:29:56,895 --> 00:29:59,090
I ran into this old friend.

534
00:29:59,197 --> 00:30:00,687
Juanita Carson.

535
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,096
We were models together.

536
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,292
Roommates.

537
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:05,460
She was in the lounge of the Savoy.

538
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:06,764
She didn't look cheap.

539
00:30:06,871 --> 00:30:08,964
Except for this 2-carat stone.

540
00:30:09,073 --> 00:30:11,041
But she wasn't with a date.

541
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:13,269
She was with a companion.

542
00:30:14,412 --> 00:30:16,277
I don't understand.

543
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:18,076
Don agreed with me.

544
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:19,810
He was an old man.

545
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:23,080
She's a call girl.

546
00:30:23,188 --> 00:30:24,485
Really?

547
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:27,448
Butterfield 8?

548
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:28,617
I wonder what that's like.

549
00:30:28,726 --> 00:30:30,921
I don't know.

550
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:32,997
New York... Manhattan... is expensive.

551
00:30:33,097 --> 00:30:34,758
We forget that.

552
00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:38,063
I used to look at people
in restaurants with envy.

553
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:39,932
Don gave me a fur coat.

554
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:42,802
If prostitution is Don
showing up with a fur coat,

555
00:30:42,907 --> 00:30:44,169
sign me up.

556
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:45,833
I don't think it's like that.

557
00:30:45,944 --> 00:30:49,175
I just keep picturing
Juanita at 22 years old.

558
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,271
We shared a room.

559
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:53,748
Talked in the dark...

560
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,752
I know we wanted the same things.

561
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:59,722
When I was 22,
whenever I was really low on money,

562
00:30:59,824 --> 00:31:03,089
I would call my father and let him know
that I was going to Havana.

563
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:08,325
And he would, without fail,
send $25 in cash in the mail.

564
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:11,359
He wanted you to have a good time.

565
00:31:11,469 --> 00:31:13,733
No. He's a degenerate gambler.

566
00:31:13,838 --> 00:31:15,829
And it would always come
with a list of instructions

567
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:16,998
of how to bet it.

568
00:31:17,108 --> 00:31:18,268
You're kidding me.

569
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:21,106
No. And he never won
because I never went.

570
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:23,339
That's criminal.

571
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:35,050
What's wrong with
the conference room?

572
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:36,592
Why don't we go to my office?

573
00:31:36,694 --> 00:31:37,820
Plenty of room.

574
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:39,191
Braggart.

575
00:31:39,297 --> 00:31:41,788
Nope. We're sitting here.

576
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,891
I'm trying to figure something out.

577
00:31:44,002 --> 00:31:47,870
So, Pops, we should celebrate
your soon-to-be-fat wife.

578
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,306
Aren't you happy?

579
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:52,876
Sure. I mean, it's going
to be a lot of headaches.

580
00:31:52,977 --> 00:31:54,535
Things are going to change.
But come on.

581
00:32:00,985 --> 00:32:02,680
He's really meeting with them.

582
00:32:02,787 --> 00:32:04,652
Why are they doing this?

583
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:08,385
I guess you haven't been privy
to some of Duck's scoutmaster talks

584
00:32:08,493 --> 00:32:09,755
about how we need younger creative.

585
00:32:09,861 --> 00:32:12,352
Who said that? Did he say that?

586
00:32:12,463 --> 00:32:14,795
- A few times.
- Wonderful.

587
00:32:14,899 --> 00:32:16,799
Look, we're in the same boat.

588
00:32:16,901 --> 00:32:18,869
I'm sure he'll turn his sights on us.

589
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,733
No one's been promoted
in Accounts since he came in.

590
00:32:20,838 --> 00:32:22,396
I can't believe Donald
would listen to Duck.

591
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:23,997
Well, maybe Duck made him.

592
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:25,803
Nobody makes Draper do anything.

593
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:29,141
Let me tell you, Don Draper
has a rope coiled under his desk,

594
00:32:29,247 --> 00:32:31,238
and it's looped around Duck's neck.

595
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:33,817
And Duck's going to run around
and run around,

596
00:32:33,918 --> 00:32:35,613
and then one day...

597
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:40,454
There's a meeting?
Nobody told me there was a meeting.

598
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:43,083
Can we change venues?

599
00:32:47,765 --> 00:32:52,361
So, I have a lot of thoughts.

600
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,062
How old are you?

601
00:32:54,172 --> 00:32:55,662
25.

602
00:32:55,773 --> 00:32:57,707
24. But that résumé,

603
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,242
that's really just two years.

604
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:01,244
18 months, without a doubt.

605
00:33:01,346 --> 00:33:02,404
Right.

606
00:33:02,513 --> 00:33:03,810
You're experienced, I gather.

607
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:05,439
Are you married?

608
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:08,018
That's why we're on the purpose.

609
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:09,245
He's right.

610
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:10,685
We haven't settled down yet.

611
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:16,451
So, again, you both
did everything together,

612
00:33:16,561 --> 00:33:18,051
and yet you get paid more.

613
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:20,096
Well, I have a writing background.

614
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:22,428
Short fiction. And I'm a citizen.

615
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:25,297
But you contribute words.

616
00:33:25,403 --> 00:33:28,167
Only when it's a distance.

617
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:34,701
I'm going to ask you a question

618
00:33:34,812 --> 00:33:37,906
that was always asked of me
when I was on job interviews.

619
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:40,678
That is divine, man.

620
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:43,253
Have you ever been fired?

621
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:48,848
I believe you that other people
have them in the hallways.

622
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,825
I just don't know if that's right for us.

623
00:33:50,928 --> 00:33:52,555
I mean, this is
an environment for clients.

624
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:55,154
We don't want to appear
to be bursting at the seams.

625
00:33:55,266 --> 00:33:58,360
Lois, may I speak with you?

626
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:06,135
Theresa said there was
an incident yesterday.

627
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:07,643
You were crying in the break room,

628
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:09,042
which I have specifically forbidden.

629
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:10,512
I'm sorry, but Peggy...

630
00:34:10,615 --> 00:34:11,741
Miss Olson.

631
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:14,676
She yelled at me.

632
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:17,277
Why would she do that?

633
00:34:19,123 --> 00:34:20,784
I'm good at my job.

634
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,519
The next time
that you come to complain...

635
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:24,595
I wasn't complaining.
You wanted to talk to me.

636
00:34:24,695 --> 00:34:26,856
This is why I don't allow
crying in the break room.

637
00:34:26,964 --> 00:34:28,192
It erodes morale.

638
00:34:28,299 --> 00:34:30,164
There's a place to do that,
like your apartment.

639
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:32,293
It came over me.

640
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,997
And I would correct your attitude
towards Miss Olson.

641
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:36,198
It's unbecoming.

642
00:34:36,307 --> 00:34:37,433
Yes, Joan.

643
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,371
Do we like this in the hallway?

644
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:44,409
I think it looks good now,

645
00:34:44,515 --> 00:34:46,415
but I think it will become messy.

646
00:34:47,518 --> 00:34:48,951
I agree.

647
00:34:54,892 --> 00:34:56,325
Looks good.

648
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:59,225
By the way, it has Julian Koenig's
fingerprints all over it.

649
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:00,854
His Master's Voice.

650
00:35:00,965 --> 00:35:02,592
Also not mine.

651
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,167
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Smith.

652
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:05,530
Smitty. Kurt.

653
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:08,400
We have the same last name.
We don't want people to mix us up.

654
00:35:08,506 --> 00:35:10,701
It must happen all the time.
You two share an office?

655
00:35:10,808 --> 00:35:12,332
Works best that way.

656
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:13,808
Look at this.

657
00:35:13,911 --> 00:35:16,141
Gentlemen, your reputations
precede you.

658
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:18,408
Duck Phillips,
head of Account Services.

659
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:20,040
I get a distinct impression.

660
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:21,277
Pardon?

661
00:35:21,385 --> 00:35:24,252
We'd rather people
not know we were here.

662
00:35:24,355 --> 00:35:26,414
If it gets out we're meeting...

663
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:28,822
- Of course not.
- Yes, right.

664
00:35:28,926 --> 00:35:30,120
Bye.

665
00:35:31,362 --> 00:35:33,660
- I'll let him know she called.
- Okay.

666
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:36,556
I like the direction you're taking.

667
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:37,759
Good.

668
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:40,736
Now that I've given you your babies
and your Xerox machine,

669
00:35:40,838 --> 00:35:42,499
should I throw in
a couple of elephants?

670
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:44,199
I don't want there to be any excuse

671
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:45,707
when you can't bring in
Martinson's Coffee.

672
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,040
Don't get worked up.

673
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,137
You know, there are other ways
to think of things

674
00:35:50,248 --> 00:35:52,239
than the way you think of them.

675
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:00,816
The testimonials.

676
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:02,825
I was thinking we could
get younger girls.

677
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:04,121
Sixth graders.

678
00:36:04,228 --> 00:36:05,490
It would mean different publications.

679
00:36:05,596 --> 00:36:07,063
Do they need Clearasil that early?

680
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,598
- Doesn't matter.
- Doesn't.

681
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:10,599
I guess we could try that.

682
00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:13,934
Two more from DDB.

683
00:36:14,038 --> 00:36:15,266
Even younger.

684
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:18,274
Just assume that everyone on the list
you handed Roger is coming in.

685
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:19,434
You're an idiot.

686
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:21,512
I don't understand that. I'm only 22.

687
00:36:21,612 --> 00:36:23,409
You don't count.

688
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,072
We've got to get him out of here.

689
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,275
Come on, Daddy.

690
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:28,818
How often do you get to celebrate
getting some girl pregnant?

691
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,512
Campbell, you're buying.

692
00:36:30,621 --> 00:36:32,452
We still have to show
Mohawk to Mr. Draper.

693
00:36:32,557 --> 00:36:33,717
Dale's not here.

694
00:36:33,824 --> 00:36:35,223
Mr. Draper doesn't care.

695
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:43,500
Kids. What's the big deal?

696
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:45,125
Do you want to have kids?

697
00:36:46,737 --> 00:36:48,830
Eventually.

698
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,373
Exactly.

699
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:03,645
Mr. Romano, Miss Olson.

700
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,520
Send them in.

701
00:37:08,926 --> 00:37:10,223
Where are we?

702
00:37:10,328 --> 00:37:12,125
You tell us.

703
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:16,499
"Where are you going?"

704
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:20,468
Are you going to underline the "you"?

705
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,334
For half the people, it will be,

706
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,305
"Where are you going?"

707
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:27,275
I also had "Come away with us."

708
00:37:29,213 --> 00:37:30,407
Where the hell's Dale?

709
00:37:31,682 --> 00:37:33,240
He's sick.

710
00:37:35,353 --> 00:37:37,014
I don't know. Sure.

711
00:37:37,121 --> 00:37:38,315
Fine.

712
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:40,253
It's exactly what we talked about.

713
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:41,916
It's obvious.

714
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,923
I'm uninvolved.

715
00:37:54,138 --> 00:37:55,435
Move this up.

716
00:37:58,376 --> 00:37:59,934
What about that?

717
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:04,075
I think it's sentimental.

718
00:38:04,181 --> 00:38:05,546
Peggy.

719
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:08,175
No, she's right.

720
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:12,655
Just because it has sentiment
doesn't make it sentimental.

721
00:38:12,757 --> 00:38:14,418
We're talking about businessmen.

722
00:38:14,525 --> 00:38:17,961
Right. Businessmen
who like short skirts.

723
00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:19,359
Sex sells.

724
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,799
Says who?

725
00:38:29,573 --> 00:38:30,631
Just so you know,

726
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:35,974
the people who talk that way
think that monkeys can do this.

727
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:39,072
And they take all this monkey crap
and just stick it in a briefcase,

728
00:38:39,183 --> 00:38:41,549
completely unaware that their success

729
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:44,314
depends on something
more than their shoe shine.

730
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:56,333
You are the product.

731
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:59,597
You feeling something.

732
00:38:59,704 --> 00:39:01,331
That's what sells.

733
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:03,737
Not them.

734
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:05,968
Not sex.

735
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:12,175
They can't do what we do.

736
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:14,251
And they hate us for it.

737
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:25,254
"Welcome back, Daddy"?

738
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:26,625
Is that a question?

739
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:34,202
"What did you bring me, Daddy?"

740
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:44,681
You can put that in your book.

741
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:05,899
What is going on?

742
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:35,325
He's going to take it to Leon in Actuarial?

743
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:38,527
His stomach's so fat,
it's now resting on his desk.

744
00:40:38,636 --> 00:40:40,900
Got to feed that big brain.

745
00:40:41,005 --> 00:40:43,337
He's a deal breaker.

746
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,272
I'm a closer.

747
00:40:46,343 --> 00:40:47,469
That Cecelia?

748
00:40:47,578 --> 00:40:49,011
Sits outside Fred Talbot's office?

749
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:50,774
You made that happen?

750
00:40:50,881 --> 00:40:51,939
Silver tongue.

751
00:40:56,587 --> 00:40:58,350
I got her three stingers.

752
00:40:58,456 --> 00:40:59,684
She's a little girl.

753
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,451
You have to give them an excuse.

754
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:02,651
That's what I always say.

755
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,887
She had those panties
that said "Wednesday."

756
00:41:04,995 --> 00:41:06,121
They were soaked through.

757
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:07,527
I love that.

758
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:09,064
Once the engine was running,

759
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:10,258
she wouldn't stop.

760
00:41:10,367 --> 00:41:11,766
She's so straight.

761
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:13,063
You'd think that.

762
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:16,204
Take your hat off.

763
00:41:18,742 --> 00:41:20,403
Is there a problem?

764
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,772
Damn it.

765
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:15,025
Everything okay?

766
00:42:15,132 --> 00:42:17,066
You know anything about cars?

767
00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:18,657
No.

768
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:22,871
Can you tell them at the Esso
to send a tow truck?

769
00:42:22,973 --> 00:42:24,270
Okay.

770
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,719
Hey, Carla.

771
00:42:37,821 --> 00:42:39,482
Hi.

772
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:42,722
Hey, Daddy.

773
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:44,350
How was your day, Mr. Draper?

774
00:42:45,462 --> 00:42:47,692
I am tired.

775
00:42:47,798 --> 00:42:48,958
Where's Mrs. Draper?

776
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:51,660
She just went to get Sally from ballet.

777
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:54,666
Want a ride to the station?

778
00:42:54,772 --> 00:42:57,570
No. I'm all right.

779
00:42:57,675 --> 00:42:59,973
It's a nice night out. I enjoy the fresh air.

780
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:01,476
Good night, Bobby.

781
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:02,773
Good night.

782
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,211
Good night.

783
00:43:12,523 --> 00:43:14,514
I don't like it.

784
00:43:17,962 --> 00:43:20,692
Here. Give it to me.

785
00:43:27,571 --> 00:43:29,562
I just know when the smoke
starts to come out,

786
00:43:29,673 --> 00:43:31,265
I have to stop.

787
00:43:31,375 --> 00:43:32,501
That's true.

788
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:36,569
I got a fan belt on the truck.
I could put it in for $9.00.

789
00:43:37,681 --> 00:43:39,012
Hold on.

790
00:44:03,073 --> 00:44:04,734
I have $3.00 and change.

791
00:44:04,842 --> 00:44:06,571
I could put it on account,

792
00:44:06,677 --> 00:44:07,974
send you a bill.

793
00:44:08,078 --> 00:44:09,739
I don't want my husband
knowing about this.

794
00:44:09,847 --> 00:44:11,075
It's a new car.

795
00:44:11,181 --> 00:44:13,649
He doesn't like the way I drive.

796
00:44:13,751 --> 00:44:15,582
That's got nothing to do with this.

797
00:44:20,357 --> 00:44:23,724
Well, it would mean the world to me.

798
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:25,590
I don't know. You know, the...

799
00:44:25,696 --> 00:44:28,256
the belt's 2.55.

800
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:34,299
So there's nothing you can do
for a damsel in distress?

801
00:44:37,908 --> 00:44:40,138
Are we bargaining here?

802
00:44:41,879 --> 00:44:46,578
Well, yes, I guess we are.

803
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:49,482
I could say no, couldn't I?

804
00:44:51,055 --> 00:44:53,615
That would be
a terrible disappointment.

805
00:44:53,724 --> 00:44:56,022
It would be, wouldn't it?

806
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:27,481
It's not that complicated.

807
00:45:27,591 --> 00:45:29,218
That's a relief.

808
00:45:42,172 --> 00:45:45,664
Well, that'll do it.

809
00:45:57,955 --> 00:45:59,889
Have a good night now.

810
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:03,016
I will.

811
00:46:13,303 --> 00:46:14,827
Polly!

812
00:46:17,474 --> 00:46:18,566
I'm here, too.

813
00:46:18,675 --> 00:46:19,733
Hi, Daddy.

814
00:46:19,843 --> 00:46:21,071
Hi.

815
00:46:23,547 --> 00:46:24,844
Bobby conked out.

816
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:26,279
Where were you?

817
00:46:26,383 --> 00:46:27,680
Mommy was late.

818
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:32,188
I got stuck talking to Marilyn Keckner
in the parking lot.

819
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:34,484
Well, I was here.

820
00:46:34,591 --> 00:46:35,888
Did you eat something?

821
00:46:35,993 --> 00:46:37,085
I did.

822
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:41,396
Come on, show me
what you learned in ballet.

823
00:47:03,053 --> 00:47:04,577
Now I am quietly waiting

824
00:47:04,688 --> 00:47:06,553
for the catastrophe of my personality

825
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:08,750
to seem beautiful again,

826
00:47:08,859 --> 00:47:11,623
and interesting and modern.

827
00:47:19,203 --> 00:47:20,898
The country is gray

828
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:24,735
and brown and white and trees.

829
00:47:27,244 --> 00:47:31,305
Snows and skies of laughter
are always diminishing.

830
00:47:31,415 --> 00:47:33,940
Less funny, not just darker.

831
00:47:34,051 --> 00:47:36,042
Not just gray.

832
00:47:37,754 --> 00:47:40,985
It may be the coldest day of the year.

833
00:47:41,091 --> 00:47:43,855
What does he think of that?

834
00:47:43,961 --> 00:47:47,055
I mean, what do I?

835
00:47:48,432 --> 00:47:50,491
And if I do,

836
00:47:50,601 --> 00:47:54,537
perhaps I am myself again.
