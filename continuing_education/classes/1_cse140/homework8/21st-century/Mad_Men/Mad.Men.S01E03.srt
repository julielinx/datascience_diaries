<i>Previously on</i> Mad Men.

2
00:00:07,145 --> 00:00:09,435
- Why are you here?
- I'm getting married on sunday.

3
00:00:10,002 --> 00:00:11,977
I'm not gonna let a woman
talk to me like this.

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,525
Any chance you could patch things up
with Rachel Menken?

5
00:00:14,684 --> 00:00:16,139
She's worth $3 million.

6
00:00:16,432 --> 00:00:18,675
- Why aren't you married?
- I'm never been in love.

7
00:00:18,987 --> 00:00:21,036
I'll be back in the office
monday morning,

8
00:00:21,821 --> 00:00:22,949
for a real meeting.

9
00:00:23,365 --> 00:00:25,138
I Don't know why I'm here.

10
00:00:25,287 --> 00:00:27,406
I always thought people
saw psychiatrists

11
00:00:27,558 --> 00:00:29,044
when they were unhappy..

12
00:00:29,379 --> 00:00:31,516
To Moses and Don Draper...

13
00:00:31,717 --> 00:00:32,926
couple of princes.

14
00:01:12,062 --> 00:01:14,269
Season 1 Episode 3
<i>Marriage of Figaro</i>

15
00:01:22,108 --> 00:01:23,108
Dick?

16
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:26,170
Richard Whitmen?

17
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:29,439
Holy smokes is that you?

18
00:01:31,172 --> 00:01:32,459
As I live and breathe!

19
00:01:32,861 --> 00:01:33,861
It's me, Larry!

20
00:01:35,735 --> 00:01:37,844
Prizinkey L, fort sill.

22
00:01:39,473 --> 00:01:40,473
Oh, of course, Larry.

24
00:01:40,691 --> 00:01:41,701
Look at you.

25
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:44,379
Yeah and you,
still haven't filled out...

26
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,799
You must be a bachelor.

27
00:01:46,347 --> 00:01:47,347
No.

28
00:01:48,096 --> 00:01:50,258
Where you at?
I'm out of Waltham, mass.,

29
00:01:50,528 --> 00:01:53,876
I'm just spending a day in armock
with international business machines.

30
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,159
I'm upstate.

31
00:01:55,347 --> 00:01:57,494
Hey, I just saw
Jerry Chrition, remember?

32
00:01:57,662 --> 00:02:00,407
Slept with a sidearm in
his bunk, almost blew his jaw off.

33
00:02:00,973 --> 00:02:01,973
Yeah, I remember that.

34
00:02:03,535 --> 00:02:05,301
Yeah well, look, I should, uh...

35
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:07,861
Call me. We should catch up.

36
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:10,562
Absolutely.

37
00:02:11,035 --> 00:02:12,035
Old Dick Whitman.

38
00:02:13,171 --> 00:02:14,472
What are the chances?

39
00:02:40,876 --> 00:02:41,975
Oh, morning Haus.

40
00:02:43,422 --> 00:02:45,545
I mean its France, what do
hey want with the bomb?

41
00:02:45,668 --> 00:02:46,948
Oh, we must've given it to them.

42
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,091
No way the francs came up
with it on their own.

43
00:02:49,573 --> 00:02:50,848
It's the honeymoon kid!

44
00:02:51,009 --> 00:02:53,568
Here comes Romeo without
his robe like a dried herring.

45
00:02:53,686 --> 00:02:54,848
Do I seem different?

46
00:02:55,036 --> 00:02:56,192
You do look depleted homes.

47
00:02:56,446 --> 00:02:58,458
The wedding was great,
how was the rest of it?

48
00:02:58,899 --> 00:03:00,695
You know you're talking
about my wife here.

49
00:03:00,801 --> 00:03:02,445
Oh, she's already got you there?

50
00:03:02,661 --> 00:03:03,840
Gentlemen never discuss this.

51
00:03:03,928 --> 00:03:05,166
We're talking about you here.

52
00:03:05,537 --> 00:03:08,859
The man who told us the coat check
girl from 21 had tangerine panties.

53
00:03:10,675 --> 00:03:11,931
Come on buddy boy, spill.

54
00:03:12,783 --> 00:03:13,783
I Don't know...

55
00:03:14,929 --> 00:03:16,620
Something happened in the ceremony.

56
00:03:17,321 --> 00:03:20,101
It's when he said that thing
about being a new baptized.

57
00:03:20,876 --> 00:03:23,307
I just... felt this calm
come over me.

58
00:03:23,693 --> 00:03:26,536
So what you're saying is,
uh, a lot of missionary?

59
00:03:32,425 --> 00:03:33,446
Fine.

60
00:03:33,909 --> 00:03:36,101
So she's laying there right?

61
00:03:36,582 --> 00:03:38,730
And she kept looking at
the maps talking about

62
00:03:39,047 --> 00:03:41,044
all the things we were going to do...

63
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:42,861
But we never did.

64
00:03:43,288 --> 00:03:45,295
Ladies home journal
I can get that at moms.

65
00:03:45,483 --> 00:03:46,765
Welcome back mr. Campbell.

66
00:03:47,162 --> 00:03:48,162
Well, hey there.

67
00:03:48,936 --> 00:03:50,404
The ring, it's like catnip.

68
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:54,978
Did you know that 600,000 gallons
of water go over the falls per second?

69
00:03:55,189 --> 00:03:56,189
Per second!

70
00:03:56,627 --> 00:03:57,726
Oh look, he's back.

71
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:58,940
Good morning.

72
00:03:59,502 --> 00:04:00,502
Congratulations.

73
00:04:00,754 --> 00:04:01,754
Welcome back.

74
00:04:02,628 --> 00:04:04,982
Thanks everybody.
When did this place get so friendly?

75
00:04:05,142 --> 00:04:06,288
I guess people missed ya.

76
00:04:06,403 --> 00:04:07,495
Welcome back, mr. Campbell.

77
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:08,581
Hildy.

78
00:04:13,329 --> 00:04:14,329
Close the door!

79
00:04:14,779 --> 00:04:15,831
Close the door!

80
00:04:18,642 --> 00:04:20,261
Who put the chinaman in my office?

81
00:04:21,643 --> 00:04:22,643
Welcome back!

82
00:04:30,206 --> 00:04:33,361
They paid an oriental family
to be in mr. Campbell's office.

83
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:36,619
Someone will finally
be working in there.

84
00:04:44,395 --> 00:04:46,308
Mr. Romano, mr. Kinsy and
mr. Creen are here

85
00:04:46,484 --> 00:04:47,517
for your meeting.

86
00:04:50,143 --> 00:04:51,143
Do you need a minute?

87
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,604
Do you need a minute?

88
00:04:52,769 --> 00:04:55,760
You must. You keep moving
this C-core laxative discussion.

89
00:04:59,068 --> 00:05:01,028
Do you see what
we did to Campbell's office?

90
00:05:02,957 --> 00:05:04,007
What do we have?

91
00:05:05,254 --> 00:05:08,516
Let me remind you, safe and reliable
would make me doze off

92
00:05:08,692 --> 00:05:11,530
if I wasn't so blighted
by the scourge of constipation.

93
00:05:11,814 --> 00:05:13,395
Well what can I say? I'm blocked.

94
00:05:15,006 --> 00:05:16,849
I told you he wouldn't
think that was funny.

95
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:18,130
I got one...

96
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:21,109
How about, "C-core... satisfeckulate."

97
00:05:21,504 --> 00:05:23,257
I'd stay in the art department, Sal.

98
00:05:23,522 --> 00:05:26,885
I'm just saying we can be funny
like those Volkswagen people.

99
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,566
Did you see this yet?

100
00:05:29,042 --> 00:05:30,075
I have.

101
00:05:30,275 --> 00:05:33,075
I Don't know what I hate about it
the most, the ad or the car.

102
00:05:33,298 --> 00:05:35,446
You know they did one last year,
same kind've smirk.

103
00:05:35,552 --> 00:05:36,562
Remember "think small?"

104
00:05:36,679 --> 00:05:39,737
It was a half page ad on a full page
buy, you could barely see the product.

105
00:05:39,914 --> 00:05:42,368
I Don't get it. Elvis just got
back from West Germany.

106
00:05:42,511 --> 00:05:43,704
Why not put him in it.

107
00:05:44,451 --> 00:05:45,653
They must be getting results.

108
00:05:45,828 --> 00:05:47,322
They keep going back to the well.

109
00:05:48,357 --> 00:05:50,476
I want the Chinaman
out of the building by lunch.

110
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,965
I'm still waiting on my shirts.

111
00:05:53,434 --> 00:05:54,761
Have you seen this?

112
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:09,609
I'm back now.

113
00:06:09,766 --> 00:06:10,766
I see that.

114
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:13,268
So?

115
00:06:14,557 --> 00:06:16,198
I should be on the list for the meeting.

116
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,390
I just... I didn't know when
you were coming back.

117
00:06:21,203 --> 00:06:22,203
Right.

118
00:06:23,072 --> 00:06:25,291
Yeah well, it's today. Here I am.

119
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:30,028
They're all in there already.
You can go in.

120
00:06:39,516 --> 00:06:41,962
When I came over that night,
you know,

121
00:06:42,498 --> 00:06:43,507
before.

122
00:06:44,205 --> 00:06:45,205
I was there.

123
00:06:46,829 --> 00:06:49,451
You know, I'm married now.

124
00:06:51,454 --> 00:06:52,454
I know.

125
00:06:52,767 --> 00:06:53,767
So...

126
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,124
I understand.

127
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:04,769
It never happened.

128
00:07:06,912 --> 00:07:08,603
You want me to buzz you in?

129
00:07:08,932 --> 00:07:10,916
The door looks a little bit open.

130
00:07:18,454 --> 00:07:19,454
Sorry about that.

131
00:07:19,769 --> 00:07:21,421
I took the Chinese out of the building

132
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:22,824
but I have a feeling in an hour

133
00:07:22,965 --> 00:07:24,585
I'm gonna want to take
them out again.

134
00:07:27,745 --> 00:07:29,663
Burn Bock, he's a Jew.

135
00:07:30,943 --> 00:07:33,479
If I were him I wouldn't want to help
reindustrialize Germany.

136
00:07:33,643 --> 00:07:34,825
Everybody's got a price.

137
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:37,655
Yeah, I saw that.
Honesty, it's a great angle.

138
00:07:38,395 --> 00:07:42,600
No chrome, no horsepower,
foreign, ugly.

139
00:07:43,094 --> 00:07:44,702
I guess they went with their strengths.

140
00:07:44,832 --> 00:07:46,370
- It is funny.
- It is?

141
00:07:46,546 --> 00:07:49,082
Cause I think the jokes on us.
You're supposed to look at that

142
00:07:49,188 --> 00:07:50,796
and say it's a great car not a great ad.

143
00:07:50,976 --> 00:07:52,302
I laughed. I think its brilliant.

144
00:07:52,704 --> 00:07:53,730
Brilliant,

145
00:07:54,082 --> 00:07:56,846
I'll tell you what brilliance in
advertising is 99 cents.

146
00:07:57,328 --> 00:07:58,736
Somebody thought of that Campbell.

147
00:07:59,523 --> 00:08:02,071
Well say what you want.
Love it or hate it the fact remains,

148
00:08:02,267 --> 00:08:04,596
we've been talking about
this for the last 15 minutes...

149
00:08:06,767 --> 00:08:07,767
And this is "Playboy."

150
00:08:09,992 --> 00:08:12,876
Course what we should've been talking
about is c-core laxative...

151
00:08:13,052 --> 00:08:16,269
Unless, as it appears,
there is nothing to say.

152
00:08:16,498 --> 00:08:18,341
I Don't want to hear this.

153
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,336
We're on the case.

154
00:08:21,232 --> 00:08:23,357
Part of this job is doing
things you Don't wanna do.

155
00:08:23,486 --> 00:08:24,531
Most of it.

156
00:08:30,036 --> 00:08:31,962
It's good to be back, Draper.
I missed you.

157
00:08:32,381 --> 00:08:34,295
Then it must not've been
much of a honeymoon.

158
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:39,204
I'm sorry, welcome back.

159
00:08:40,457 --> 00:08:41,591
How's married life?

160
00:08:41,956 --> 00:08:43,266
It's pretty swell.

161
00:08:47,268 --> 00:08:49,415
I was raised that
men Don't wear jewelry.

162
00:08:50,527 --> 00:08:51,708
I kind've like it.

163
00:08:52,436 --> 00:08:53,998
Trudy's a lot funnier then I thought.

164
00:08:54,195 --> 00:08:56,672
I'm actually looking forward
to going home tonight.

165
00:08:57,001 --> 00:08:58,605
Well I look forward to meeting her.

166
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:02,249
Hey, maybe one of these nights

167
00:09:02,402 --> 00:09:04,304
we could get dinner
together with the wives.

168
00:09:04,582 --> 00:09:05,621
Maybe we can.

169
00:09:23,751 --> 00:09:25,786
You know girls we'd be
happy to bring you coffee.

170
00:09:25,902 --> 00:09:27,299
I was on my way over anyways.

171
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:28,617
I have something of yours.

172
00:09:31,288 --> 00:09:33,613
"Lady Chaterley's lover",
I finished it last night.

173
00:09:33,805 --> 00:09:35,437
Good to the last drop, right?

174
00:09:36,018 --> 00:09:37,361
I can see why it got banned.

175
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:40,744
Well you Don't have to be so
shy about it, it's literature.

176
00:09:41,392 --> 00:09:42,672
That is a huge pocketbook, Joan.

177
00:09:43,646 --> 00:09:45,983
Well it has a change of clothing
and a toothbrush in it.

178
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,337
A hope chest.

179
00:09:48,828 --> 00:09:49,994
Have you read this, Peggy?

180
00:09:50,324 --> 00:09:51,923
I Don't think that's a good idea.

181
00:09:52,952 --> 00:09:53,952
There's, um...

182
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,136
This word in it a lot.

183
00:09:57,891 --> 00:09:59,037
I know the word, Joan.

184
00:09:59,257 --> 00:10:00,391
Well it's sad really

185
00:10:00,702 --> 00:10:03,081
because even with its reputation,
men won't read it.

186
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,391
And they really should.

187
00:10:04,576 --> 00:10:05,976
I Don't care if it's 500-years-old,

188
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:08,887
it's another testimony to how most
people think marriage is a joke.

189
00:10:09,821 --> 00:10:11,054
They rip a lot of clothing.

190
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,200
Yeah it's a fantasy.

191
00:10:12,441 --> 00:10:14,390
He's married and she's married,

192
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,807
the desperate passion of the forbidden.

193
00:10:17,694 --> 00:10:18,790
Can I borrow it?

194
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,916
She's making it sound
better then it is.

195
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:22,538
There's a few good parts that's all.

196
00:10:22,701 --> 00:10:24,808
And the book just opens
to those pages by itself.

197
00:10:27,645 --> 00:10:28,934
Hey Don't read it on the train.

198
00:10:29,145 --> 00:10:30,501
It'll attract the wrong element.

199
00:10:31,643 --> 00:10:32,643
Bye.

200
00:10:37,927 --> 00:10:39,911
So the doctor says to him,
"I hope you're happy.

201
00:10:40,017 --> 00:10:41,943
"While you were out
finishing a round of golf,

202
00:10:42,072 --> 00:10:43,598
"your wife was in a horrible accident.

203
00:10:43,692 --> 00:10:45,336
"She is gonna need round the clock care-

204
00:10:45,442 --> 00:10:46,686
"bathing, toilet."

205
00:10:47,401 --> 00:10:48,819
then the doc looks at him and says,

206
00:10:48,924 --> 00:10:50,134
"I'm just kidding, she's dead.

207
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:51,296
"Hey what'd ya shoot?"

208
00:10:51,632 --> 00:10:53,264
Well we have and initial research report

209
00:10:53,412 --> 00:10:56,441
and what I think are some
very astute market observations.

210
00:10:59,255 --> 00:11:00,321
Mr. Draper.

211
00:11:00,506 --> 00:11:03,262
Pleased to see you didn't disappear
the minute you cashed my check.

212
00:11:03,456 --> 00:11:04,967
We appreciate your business.

213
00:11:05,895 --> 00:11:07,123
Kenny or course you know.

214
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:09,019
Harry Crane, media

215
00:11:09,518 --> 00:11:11,987
and mr. George Pallham over
here who is from research

216
00:11:12,143 --> 00:11:14,584
and who has more degrees
then a russian protractor.

217
00:11:14,902 --> 00:11:16,358
That's quite an introduction.

218
00:11:16,771 --> 00:11:18,388
From the other side of the pond I see.

219
00:11:18,642 --> 00:11:19,788
We take his word for it.

220
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,885
So, uh, that is yours to keep

221
00:11:26,184 --> 00:11:27,933
but if you'd like to follow along.

222
00:11:28,793 --> 00:11:30,555
You'll see from the overview

223
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,585
our primary focus was saks,

224
00:11:33,017 --> 00:11:34,846
Henri Bendel and Bonwit Taylor.

225
00:11:35,204 --> 00:11:37,611
Our research uncovered
a variety of options

226
00:11:37,772 --> 00:11:39,035
they utilize to attract

227
00:11:39,592 --> 00:11:40,896
your desired customers.

228
00:11:41,581 --> 00:11:43,260
One thing these stores have
in common

229
00:11:43,444 --> 00:11:45,405
is a comfortable shopping environment.

230
00:11:45,755 --> 00:11:47,834
Spacious open salesfloors,

231
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:50,909
an almost conspicuous lack of clutter.

232
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:53,795
The merchandise is minimal
and neatly presented

233
00:11:53,956 --> 00:11:56,281
on tables and in display cases.

234
00:11:57,074 --> 00:11:59,681
This less is more philosophy

235
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:01,864
is also efferent in the window displays.

236
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:03,278
For example,

237
00:12:03,677 --> 00:12:05,826
only one sweater to a window

238
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:09,371
as opposed to windows
stuffed with merchandise.

239
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:11,263
My father's going to love that.

240
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,794
Believe it or not it even
applies to the mannequins.

241
00:12:14,022 --> 00:12:15,735
Bendles takes the heads off theirs

242
00:12:15,894 --> 00:12:18,121
so the shopper can imagine
them to be anyone.

243
00:12:18,395 --> 00:12:19,705
Anyone without a head.

244
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,853
Along with these cosmetic changes,

245
00:12:22,271 --> 00:12:24,034
you'll also need to provide what we call

246
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:25,448
"Boutique extras."

247
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:27,348
a personal shopping service,

248
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:28,897
private fashion shows,

249
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:30,667
designer collections.

250
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,378
This is comprehensive.

251
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:34,097
It's the lay of the land.

252
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:36,210
Just from holding it
I feel more informed

253
00:12:36,315 --> 00:12:38,037
about my competitors then ever.

254
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:43,239
And yet my store already
has a personal shopping service

255
00:12:43,415 --> 00:12:45,082
and designer collections,

256
00:12:46,294 --> 00:12:48,357
if you were so focused
on my competitors

257
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:50,142
that you failed to visit my store.

258
00:12:52,982 --> 00:12:54,400
I've been away on my honeymoon.

259
00:12:54,656 --> 00:12:55,842
I've been there a few times.

260
00:12:56,434 --> 00:12:58,888
It's a beautiful old place.

261
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:05,001
Miss Menken I can assure you

262
00:13:05,107 --> 00:13:08,923
that no one at this table
has ever been to your store.

263
00:13:09,742 --> 00:13:12,889
A wrong I will personally
correct this afternoon.

264
00:13:16,277 --> 00:13:17,493
It's right on 5th ave.

265
00:13:19,347 --> 00:13:22,000
That's one big block over
and a dozen little blocks up.

266
00:13:24,652 --> 00:13:26,042
It's been there for 30 years.

267
00:13:26,426 --> 00:13:28,657
- I'll walk you out.
- I've got it.

268
00:13:33,966 --> 00:13:34,966
Harry.

269
00:13:35,152 --> 00:13:36,152
What?

270
00:13:37,619 --> 00:13:39,798
It's nice the way you handled that.

271
00:13:40,497 --> 00:13:41,838
It's hard to get caught in a lie.

272
00:13:42,059 --> 00:13:43,059
Well it wasn't a lie.

273
00:13:43,184 --> 00:13:45,597
It was ineptitude
with insufficient cover.

274
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:48,774
Something about the way you talk

275
00:13:48,984 --> 00:13:50,184
always restores my confidence.

276
00:13:50,923 --> 00:13:52,379
I have a deep voice.

277
00:13:53,235 --> 00:13:54,235
This afternoon then.

278
00:13:55,044 --> 00:13:56,044
It's a date.

279
00:13:59,938 --> 00:14:01,107
New junior exec.

280
00:14:09,235 --> 00:14:11,487
Changing her store
could take six months,

281
00:14:11,734 --> 00:14:13,841
or a year if I know
what's good for me.

282
00:14:14,027 --> 00:14:15,037
What was that in there?

283
00:14:15,143 --> 00:14:16,153
What?

284
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:18,043
Don and Molly Goldberg,
did you see that?

285
00:14:18,268 --> 00:14:19,729
Yeah I caught it, what's your point?

286
00:14:19,858 --> 00:14:21,983
I Don't know. I mean everybody
always jokes about it

287
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,596
but I've never seen Draper
really turn that switch on before.

288
00:14:24,795 --> 00:14:26,709
Well I guess he likes her.
What would you do?

289
00:14:30,985 --> 00:14:31,985
Trying to quit.

290
00:14:33,235 --> 00:14:35,853
You are really putting
he junior in junior executive.

291
00:14:36,455 --> 00:14:38,378
Look, you're married now, right?

292
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,830
I'm a part of that club now too.
Two very happy years,

293
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:44,575
but when I'm out in the world...

294
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:48,109
I Don't know. I Don't do it much.
I'm not good at it...

295
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,979
The flirting, the double intandras.

296
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,993
You mean something on the side?

297
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:56,085
No I mean enjoying
the company of women

298
00:14:56,276 --> 00:14:58,084
in the limited way a married man can.

299
00:14:59,902 --> 00:15:01,403
Well that's all we have really.

300
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:03,731
I can't speak for everyone
but it's plenty for me.

301
00:15:04,165 --> 00:15:05,821
I see. I guess on some level

302
00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:07,688
I always thought Draper
was the same way.

303
00:15:08,084 --> 00:15:09,092
Draper?

304
00:15:09,245 --> 00:15:11,992
Who knows anything about that guy?
No one's ever lifted that rock.

305
00:15:12,145 --> 00:15:13,554
He could be Batman for all we know.

306
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,350
Mr. Campbell, your wife's
on the phone.

307
00:15:18,511 --> 00:15:20,308
There's bird shit on the couch!

308
00:15:20,716 --> 00:15:21,855
That was priceless.

309
00:15:22,812 --> 00:15:23,852
Hello, honey.

310
00:15:24,913 --> 00:15:25,919
Dinner?

311
00:15:26,964 --> 00:15:28,631
What do I want for dinner?

312
00:15:30,411 --> 00:15:31,414
I Don't know.

313
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:32,875
Anything but chicken.

314
00:15:33,414 --> 00:15:34,701
Yes, they missed me.

315
00:15:35,677 --> 00:15:37,709
Ribeye in the pan with butter.

316
00:15:38,726 --> 00:15:39,726
Ice cream.

317
00:15:40,786 --> 00:15:41,849
I love you too.

318
00:15:45,876 --> 00:15:48,283
There's going to be dinner
waiting for me when I get home.

319
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,241
Yeah, how about that?

320
00:16:16,298 --> 00:16:20,272
Mr. Curland is mitigating a skirmish
in our housewares section.

321
00:16:20,906 --> 00:16:22,421
Why do I hire young girls?

322
00:16:22,623 --> 00:16:24,655
Because they cost
practically nothing.

323
00:16:25,439 --> 00:16:26,526
Costume change.

324
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:28,615
This is my closet.

325
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,607
The original tenants
laid the last brick

326
00:16:33,725 --> 00:16:35,392
the day before the crash.

327
00:16:35,525 --> 00:16:37,322
Boy, were they in for a surprise.

328
00:16:39,587 --> 00:16:41,058
As I hope you note by now,

329
00:16:41,212 --> 00:16:43,657
our original store
was just off 7th avenue.

330
00:16:44,214 --> 00:16:45,595
It was just hosiery,

331
00:16:45,775 --> 00:16:48,177
then they started pulling
piecework from sweatshops.

332
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:51,368
By 1932, those people had failed...

333
00:16:51,712 --> 00:16:54,691
My father and uncle picked
this place up for a sheckle.

334
00:16:55,215 --> 00:16:56,225
Well, it is...

335
00:16:57,227 --> 00:16:59,752
Crowded, but that might have
something to do with the sale,

336
00:16:59,928 --> 00:17:02,453
which means that if we're successful

337
00:17:02,557 --> 00:17:04,341
you're gonna lose
the customers you have

338
00:17:04,446 --> 00:17:06,067
in order to get
the customers you want.

339
00:17:06,172 --> 00:17:07,863
I was gonna start with
raising prices.

340
00:17:08,433 --> 00:17:10,128
Can you imagine what my father said?

341
00:17:10,476 --> 00:17:12,178
Well, you do have
to give them something

342
00:17:12,308 --> 00:17:13,668
for their higher dollar counts.

343
00:17:13,808 --> 00:17:14,808
It's just...

344
00:17:15,514 --> 00:17:17,510
Awfully hard to define what that is.

345
00:17:23,871 --> 00:17:24,871
How may I help you?

346
00:17:25,556 --> 00:17:27,160
I make them say that.

347
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,523
Carol, can we see
this tray right here?

348
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:39,682
Sea horses,

349
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:41,558
crowns,

350
00:17:41,897 --> 00:17:42,996
lucky dice...

351
00:17:44,808 --> 00:17:45,808
Medieval knights.

352
00:17:57,255 --> 00:17:58,370
That's better.

353
00:17:59,437 --> 00:18:00,559
Thank you.

354
00:18:07,496 --> 00:18:09,759
Let's take a look at the second floor.

355
00:18:18,944 --> 00:18:20,811
We're known for our service.

356
00:18:21,382 --> 00:18:22,779
That's gotta be a tough job.

357
00:18:22,979 --> 00:18:24,083
I know.

358
00:18:25,496 --> 00:18:27,381
I've always like
how quiet it is up here.

359
00:18:28,329 --> 00:18:30,830
Well, that might explain
the lack of customers.

360
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:34,659
I can see the charm, but...

361
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:39,127
The room is too dark,
too old fashioned.

362
00:18:39,312 --> 00:18:40,434
The products look old.

363
00:18:40,692 --> 00:18:42,570
But the people look wonderful.

364
00:18:43,976 --> 00:18:46,148
It's a shame we're gonna have
to lop their heads off.

365
00:18:46,312 --> 00:18:48,157
It'll ruin your favorite
part of the store.

366
00:18:49,372 --> 00:18:51,462
It's not my favorite part, actually.

367
00:19:07,523 --> 00:19:09,490
The grand lot of us are
going to Lansky's.

368
00:19:09,683 --> 00:19:10,683
Can you believe it?

369
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:12,370
Have a swell time.

370
00:19:12,809 --> 00:19:13,809
I've got plans.

371
00:19:17,497 --> 00:19:18,497
You look nice.

372
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:35,319
Hell... Manhattan at your feet.

373
00:19:35,498 --> 00:19:36,609
I can see the appeal.

374
00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:38,111
The view's okay.

375
00:19:38,809 --> 00:19:42,397
No, this is my favorite
part of the store.

376
00:19:43,831 --> 00:19:45,059
Hey there, missy.

377
00:19:48,774 --> 00:19:50,641
Haven't seen you in a while.

378
00:19:52,008 --> 00:19:53,426
How did they get the penthouse?

379
00:19:53,809 --> 00:19:54,840
They patrol.

380
00:19:55,439 --> 00:19:56,648
It's the only way to make sure

381
00:19:56,777 --> 00:19:58,750
there isn't anyone hiding
in the store at night.

382
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:00,698
They know I'm with you, right?

383
00:20:00,934 --> 00:20:03,377
These two are Carla and Leona.

384
00:20:04,247 --> 00:20:06,972
Not the originals...
it's the third generation.

385
00:20:07,934 --> 00:20:10,395
And what every generation
of Menken dog

386
00:20:10,571 --> 00:20:13,061
shall be named until
the end of time.

387
00:20:14,747 --> 00:20:16,765
I made my father's legal
counsel add that

388
00:20:16,909 --> 00:20:18,705
to the store's bylaws
when I was nine.

389
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:21,182
So even then you enjoyed
telling men what to do.

390
00:20:22,186 --> 00:20:24,478
To be fair, the store
was practically home.

391
00:20:25,133 --> 00:20:26,660
My father liked to work.

392
00:20:27,872 --> 00:20:29,871
I used to come out here
and talk to them...

393
00:20:30,061 --> 00:20:31,959
Well, the originals... every night.

394
00:20:33,373 --> 00:20:35,987
For a little girl, a dog
can be all you need.

395
00:20:37,123 --> 00:20:39,143
They protect you, they listen.

396
00:20:40,936 --> 00:20:43,292
I had my sister,
but there weren't other kids

397
00:20:44,226 --> 00:20:46,422
and of course,
my mother wasn't around.

398
00:20:47,376 --> 00:20:49,223
Well, that's not always a bad thing.

399
00:20:49,811 --> 00:20:50,811
Who knows?

400
00:20:51,627 --> 00:20:53,559
She died when she was having me.

401
00:20:56,439 --> 00:20:59,126
Anyway, my sister became
my only company,

402
00:20:59,315 --> 00:21:02,511
and, frankly, these bitches
were easier to handle.

403
00:21:08,564 --> 00:21:09,564
What is this?

404
00:21:13,626 --> 00:21:16,404
Don't try to convince me
that you were ever unloved.

405
00:21:48,365 --> 00:21:49,974
I Don't know what to say.

406
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:01,625
Listen...

407
00:22:06,691 --> 00:22:07,691
I'm married.

408
00:22:15,714 --> 00:22:18,450
I guess I didn't ask 'cause
I didn't wanna know.

409
00:22:21,099 --> 00:22:22,461
Shouldn't have happened.

410
00:22:24,925 --> 00:22:26,383
Well, you couldn't help yourself.

411
00:22:27,323 --> 00:22:28,768
I knew what I wanted.

412
00:22:30,681 --> 00:22:32,736
From the first time you
stormed out of our office.

413
00:22:32,901 --> 00:22:34,615
You stormed out of your office.

414
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:39,424
I took you up here... that was stupid.

415
00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:43,747
I just so looked forward
to seeing you again.

416
00:22:45,502 --> 00:22:46,765
Now I guess that's over.

417
00:23:00,188 --> 00:23:03,556
I know you understand I'd rather
not have to explain this to anyone.

418
00:23:04,813 --> 00:23:06,337
The account stays, I just...

419
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:07,882
Want someone else on it.

420
00:23:11,003 --> 00:23:12,365
Don't look at me like that.

421
00:23:14,339 --> 00:23:16,217
What do you do,
just kiss women all the time?

422
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:17,521
Women you aren't married to?

423
00:23:18,064 --> 00:23:19,080
Of course not.

424
00:23:19,749 --> 00:23:23,049
Then am I supposed to live some life
running alongside yours?

425
00:23:31,439 --> 00:23:33,670
I have some checks to sign.

426
00:24:20,302 --> 00:24:21,447
Excuse me.

427
00:24:22,068 --> 00:24:23,683
You dropped your paper.

428
00:24:27,321 --> 00:24:28,321
Thank you.

429
00:25:05,633 --> 00:25:06,633
Daddy!

430
00:25:06,822 --> 00:25:08,109
Daddy, daddy!

431
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,202
Wake up, it's my birthday.

432
00:25:10,636 --> 00:25:13,015
It's my birthday, it's my birthday!

433
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:15,910
It's not your birthday,
it's your party.

434
00:25:16,219 --> 00:25:17,593
Don, the party's at two o'clock.

435
00:25:17,698 --> 00:25:21,174
You have to put together
the p-l-a-y-h-o-u-s-e.

436
00:25:22,207 --> 00:25:24,449
How am I going
to put together a pony?

437
00:25:24,566 --> 00:25:26,961
A pony? I'm getting a pony?

438
00:25:27,823 --> 00:25:29,752
Bobby, I'm getting a pony!

439
00:25:31,556 --> 00:25:32,556
Great.

440
00:25:34,455 --> 00:25:36,803
She'll forget all about it
when she sees the playhouse.

441
00:25:41,457 --> 00:25:43,688
There's a bacon and egg sandwich
for you on the range.

442
00:26:34,688 --> 00:26:36,838
It's got a red door like ours!

443
00:26:37,313 --> 00:26:38,313
Daddy!

444
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:41,296
You are not supposed to see this yet.

445
00:26:42,234 --> 00:26:44,148
Why Don't you run to the garage
and get me another beer.

446
00:26:44,265 --> 00:26:45,275
Okay.

447
00:26:53,314 --> 00:26:54,324
Cappers?

448
00:26:54,505 --> 00:26:56,073
You want to pick those
out of the rug?

449
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,840
Well they look naked.

450
00:26:58,378 --> 00:27:00,058
The only thing this one wants

451
00:27:00,251 --> 00:27:01,491
is raw hamburger.

452
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:02,750
What does that mean?

453
00:27:04,689 --> 00:27:05,911
I think that's enough of that.

454
00:27:06,188 --> 00:27:07,346
Well, how many are we?

455
00:27:07,652 --> 00:27:08,656
Us, you...

456
00:27:08,855 --> 00:27:10,758
Carlton's with the kids,
make it quick.

457
00:27:11,261 --> 00:27:13,011
The Darlings, Helen Bishop.

458
00:27:13,546 --> 00:27:14,562
You didn't?

459
00:27:14,715 --> 00:27:17,181
I had to. She saw me buying
balloons at the market.

460
00:27:17,295 --> 00:27:18,295
It didn't seem right.

461
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:20,762
So what, I just brought her the pie,
I got my dish back...

462
00:27:20,891 --> 00:27:21,913
the end.

463
00:27:22,142 --> 00:27:23,316
Have you seen her walking,

464
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:24,754
up there on tree ridge?

465
00:27:25,191 --> 00:27:26,861
Where the hell is she walking to?

466
00:27:27,878 --> 00:27:28,878
I Don't know.

467
00:27:30,564 --> 00:27:31,780
How old is her kid?

468
00:27:32,005 --> 00:27:33,005
Kids.

469
00:27:34,067 --> 00:27:37,138
The boy is nine, I'm going
to say Gary maybe Glen...

470
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,263
And the baby is a two-year-old.

471
00:27:39,403 --> 00:27:40,976
She was going to try
and get a sitter.

472
00:27:41,691 --> 00:27:42,691
I would.

473
00:27:43,004 --> 00:27:44,987
It's probably a big event for her.

474
00:27:52,815 --> 00:27:53,815
That man...

475
00:27:56,003 --> 00:27:57,003
I know.

476
00:28:52,178 --> 00:28:54,339
You didn't use the powder
roo did you?

477
00:28:55,242 --> 00:28:57,069
It will appear untouched.

478
00:28:58,431 --> 00:29:01,260
Everyone's gonna to be here soon.
Why Don't you up and take a shower.

479
00:29:01,801 --> 00:29:02,801
Want company?

480
00:29:47,299 --> 00:29:48,301
Mint julips.

481
00:29:48,542 --> 00:29:49,634
It's that time of the year.

482
00:29:49,745 --> 00:29:50,745
Wonderful.

483
00:29:50,842 --> 00:29:52,204
I'm so thirsty lately.

484
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,800
Ready or not, here I come!

485
00:29:57,958 --> 00:30:00,072
There's datenut bread, cold turkey,

486
00:30:00,244 --> 00:30:02,405
and waldorf salad for the adults.

487
00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:08,530
I'll just made peanut butter
sandwiches for the kids.

488
00:30:08,647 --> 00:30:09,774
I know everybody eats that.

489
00:30:11,002 --> 00:30:12,002
Thank you.

490
00:30:12,318 --> 00:30:13,924
In case anybody's going to ask,

491
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:15,748
I did not get that clown.

492
00:30:17,133 --> 00:30:19,153
He got booked in some
off Broadway show.

493
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,440
About clowns?

494
00:30:21,315 --> 00:30:22,496
I think we saw that.

495
00:30:22,613 --> 00:30:24,938
It's not the one where
they take their clothes off is it?

496
00:30:25,056 --> 00:30:26,300
Who knew that could be boring?

497
00:30:28,304 --> 00:30:30,253
Want something a little
stronger there Carlton?

498
00:30:30,375 --> 00:30:31,375
He'll manage.

499
00:30:31,877 --> 00:30:33,421
We were thinking about you, Don.

500
00:30:34,941 --> 00:30:36,177
We say this thing on T.V.,

501
00:30:36,297 --> 00:30:38,035
it was right in the middle
of the news, it was cute.

502
00:30:38,176 --> 00:30:39,693
The guy flying with his hat on.

503
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:41,783
- Did you do that one?
- It was so cute.

504
00:30:42,376 --> 00:30:44,687
I think the man looks
exactly like Henry.

505
00:30:44,941 --> 00:30:45,941
Except not as handsome.

506
00:30:47,067 --> 00:30:48,067
I haven't seen that.

507
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:50,777
I'm going to go and
lay the kids food out,

508
00:30:50,939 --> 00:30:53,235
but let's not even bother
trying to get them to sit.

509
00:30:53,389 --> 00:30:54,404
I'll co-pilot.

510
00:30:54,574 --> 00:30:55,959
Heard a good one the other day.

511
00:30:56,077 --> 00:30:58,096
- No, Jeff.
- I'm gonna tell the joke.

512
00:30:58,817 --> 00:31:01,194
Your wife and your lawyer
are drowning,

513
00:31:01,441 --> 00:31:02,614
you have a choice to make,

514
00:31:02,744 --> 00:31:04,059
do you go to lunch or a movie?

515
00:31:05,777 --> 00:31:06,837
It's good, right?

516
00:31:06,989 --> 00:31:09,267
I'm missin' the ballgame,
might as well have some fun.

517
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:13,591
So how are things on mad ave, Don?

518
00:31:13,924 --> 00:31:15,647
Looks like they're taking
care of you.

519
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:17,697
We got it all, huh?

520
00:31:19,376 --> 00:31:20,503
Yep, this is it.

521
00:31:24,022 --> 00:31:25,642
Maybe it's his obsession
with sports,

522
00:31:25,881 --> 00:31:27,661
but it's been hard for Jack.

523
00:31:28,272 --> 00:31:31,395
Marilyn, I've been watching Kevin
and he gets around very well.

524
00:31:33,252 --> 00:31:35,213
I bet he doesn't know the difference.

525
00:31:35,753 --> 00:31:36,753
He does.

526
00:31:37,003 --> 00:31:38,408
He's very determined.

527
00:31:39,465 --> 00:31:42,154
Jack really gets angry anytime
someone mentions the vaccine

528
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,234
and I tell him we should be grateful.

529
00:31:44,439 --> 00:31:45,962
First of all, it could have
been much worse.

530
00:31:46,115 --> 00:31:47,759
It could have gotten to his lungs.

531
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:50,675
Second of all, this can't happen
to other children.

532
00:31:51,389 --> 00:31:52,759
They think they're athletes.

533
00:31:53,267 --> 00:31:54,378
I want to say to chet,

534
00:31:54,542 --> 00:31:56,779
I saw you play football
in high school,

535
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:59,515
your son is going to be
a tackling dummy just like you.

536
00:32:11,043 --> 00:32:13,473
According to Glen here,
when the door is a little bit open

537
00:32:13,614 --> 00:32:14,988
you're supposed to come in.

538
00:32:15,816 --> 00:32:16,873
Hello, Helen.

539
00:32:17,724 --> 00:32:19,309
<i>Kelly where are you?</i>

540
00:32:19,566 --> 00:32:21,686
I hate to start with
a bunch of excuses,

541
00:32:21,838 --> 00:32:25,067
but the baby sitter was late and
I still haven't unpacked all the boxes

542
00:32:25,229 --> 00:32:27,696
so this was the only
paper I could find.

543
00:32:30,397 --> 00:32:33,203
It should be christmas all year
as far as I'm concerned.

544
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:40,577
<i>...in New York city is expected
to receive the tax evasion...</i>

545
00:32:42,789 --> 00:32:45,172
<i>Opera's production of Mozart's</i>

546
00:32:45,503 --> 00:32:46,731
<i>Marriage of Figaro.</i>

547
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:49,293
<i>With Meryl and Joan Sutherland.</i>

548
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:52,861
Don, you have to pick up
the cake from hightop.

549
00:32:53,733 --> 00:32:56,493
And this is Helen Bishop and Glen.

550
00:32:56,768 --> 00:32:57,825
Nice to meet you all.

551
00:32:59,316 --> 00:33:01,049
Don, he goes with me,

552
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:04,106
then Carlton, Chet, and Jack.

553
00:33:04,599 --> 00:33:07,018
Glen, I'm pretty sure there's some
peanut butter sandwiches

554
00:33:07,135 --> 00:33:09,871
and a bb gun out there in the
backyard. Why Don't you come with me?

555
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:17,968
Don, can I speak with you?

556
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:21,577
Let's see, I told you about the cake

557
00:33:21,694 --> 00:33:24,159
and, oh, can you take
some movies this time?

558
00:33:24,876 --> 00:33:26,923
Of everyone, or just chief Tiny Tim?

559
00:33:27,504 --> 00:33:29,719
You bought that camera
and you always forget.

560
00:33:30,753 --> 00:33:31,753
Okay.

561
00:33:36,777 --> 00:33:37,869
Ladies.

562
00:33:38,139 --> 00:33:39,968
Ladies. This is Helen Bishop.

563
00:33:40,955 --> 00:33:43,315
This is Maryland and Nancy.

564
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,017
She seems scared, poor thing.

565
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:50,057
Trust me, those hens are gonna
peck her to death.

566
00:33:50,483 --> 00:33:52,834
Did you see her running around
in that little Volkswagen?

567
00:33:53,089 --> 00:33:54,111
It's kinda desperate.

568
00:33:54,252 --> 00:33:56,259
Yeah that won't help her.
It's got no backseat...

569
00:33:56,353 --> 00:33:58,155
She'll have to find some
midget hitchhiker.

570
00:34:00,579 --> 00:34:02,040
Last time I saw one of those,

571
00:34:02,267 --> 00:34:04,073
I think I was throwing
a grenade into it.

572
00:34:05,662 --> 00:34:07,615
The problem with easter
break is it's too long.

573
00:34:07,915 --> 00:34:08,966
The doldrums.

574
00:34:09,137 --> 00:34:12,064
We're thinking about seven
days six nights in Boca Raton...

575
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:14,540
With mosquitoes as
big as a silver dollar.

576
00:34:14,691 --> 00:34:16,816
And believe me, those
aren't the only giant noses

577
00:34:16,966 --> 00:34:18,326
you're going to have to deal with.

578
00:34:18,521 --> 00:34:19,560
Francine!

579
00:34:20,342 --> 00:34:22,063
Carlton and I when there
on our honeymoon

580
00:34:22,204 --> 00:34:24,090
and all I can say is
we were outnumbered.

581
00:34:24,341 --> 00:34:25,341
It's uncomfortable.

582
00:34:25,592 --> 00:34:26,900
You want to be able to relax.

583
00:34:27,152 --> 00:34:28,835
We went to Bermuda on our honeymoon.

584
00:34:28,965 --> 00:34:30,175
Pink sand beaches.

585
00:34:31,589 --> 00:34:32,911
Where did you go?

586
00:34:35,151 --> 00:34:36,549
I'm sorry.

587
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:39,470
It's okay.

588
00:34:39,777 --> 00:34:40,777
I went to Paris.

589
00:34:41,342 --> 00:34:43,369
Four years of mount holyoke french,

590
00:34:44,715 --> 00:34:45,814
haven't used it since.

591
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:50,461
And I wouldn't give it back,

592
00:34:50,653 --> 00:34:52,275
even being with Glen's father.

593
00:34:52,716 --> 00:34:54,191
Is that your ex-husband?

594
00:34:56,090 --> 00:34:57,090
Yes.

595
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,387
I went to Italy.

596
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,880
Not on my honeymoon,

597
00:35:02,027 --> 00:35:03,855
right after I graduated
from Brimmare.

598
00:35:05,024 --> 00:35:06,116
What a summer.

599
00:35:06,283 --> 00:35:07,563
"Three coins in the fountain."

600
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,000
it was right about that time.

601
00:35:09,215 --> 00:35:10,721
You must have loved Paris.

602
00:35:10,965 --> 00:35:11,965
It's all walking.

603
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:13,527
What do you mean?

604
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,147
Just that I've seen you

605
00:35:15,465 --> 00:35:17,185
walking around the neighborhood.

606
00:35:17,825 --> 00:35:19,833
I've seen you too, when I was driving.

607
00:35:20,029 --> 00:35:21,029
I think I waved.

608
00:35:21,402 --> 00:35:22,987
Where are you going
when you do that?

609
00:35:23,274 --> 00:35:24,343
No place.

610
00:35:24,465 --> 00:35:25,465
I just like to walk.

611
00:35:29,593 --> 00:35:30,593
But where?

612
00:35:31,218 --> 00:35:32,218
Anywhere.

613
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:34,753
It just relaxes me... clears my mind.

614
00:35:35,994 --> 00:35:37,861
I heard on the radio
that Einstein did it.

615
00:35:37,981 --> 00:35:38,991
Einstein?

616
00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:40,606
He's got his hands in everything.

617
00:35:55,848 --> 00:35:57,027
hey, daddy!

618
00:36:11,514 --> 00:36:12,837
what are you, Frank Sinatra?

619
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:14,433
I was looking for Glen.

620
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:17,011
Bunch of 'em just ran through.

621
00:36:21,396 --> 00:36:22,718
There are the boys.

622
00:36:23,966 --> 00:36:24,966
How we doing?

623
00:36:30,244 --> 00:36:32,014
It's, uh, it's Helen, right?

624
00:36:34,577 --> 00:36:36,232
I know your situation

625
00:36:36,767 --> 00:36:38,847
and my heart breaks
for that little boy.

626
00:36:39,329 --> 00:36:40,475
I have a baby, too.

627
00:36:41,952 --> 00:36:44,869
You can act strong,
but I just want to volunteer.

628
00:36:45,496 --> 00:36:46,600
If you ever need someone

629
00:36:46,766 --> 00:36:48,813
to throw the ball around
with him some sunday,

630
00:36:48,953 --> 00:36:50,193
take him to the beach...

631
00:36:51,267 --> 00:36:52,267
That would be nice.

632
00:36:54,283 --> 00:36:55,398
I'm sure eventually

633
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,169
I would get so used
to your sunday visits

634
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:58,644
I'd join you at the beach.

635
00:36:59,018 --> 00:37:00,352
Just the four of us.

636
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:03,725
Then one night, you'd drop
us off at the house

637
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:06,305
and walk me in with an umbrella.

638
00:37:06,535 --> 00:37:07,619
The kids would go to sleep

639
00:37:07,766 --> 00:37:09,974
and we'd laugh about
all the funny things

640
00:37:10,091 --> 00:37:11,830
that happened at the beach that day.

641
00:37:12,627 --> 00:37:14,153
I Don't want you telling Francine

642
00:37:14,331 --> 00:37:16,055
that I suggested
something that I didn't.

643
00:37:17,445 --> 00:37:20,334
Well, I'm sorry if I misunderstood.

644
00:38:06,232 --> 00:38:07,606
you dented the car!

645
00:38:07,791 --> 00:38:09,587
I like sleeping on the couch.

646
00:38:10,886 --> 00:38:12,271
I Don't like your tongue.

647
00:38:12,893 --> 00:38:14,250
Take your shoes off.

648
00:38:22,814 --> 00:38:24,206
I want the wagon!

649
00:38:25,889 --> 00:38:27,803
Okay, I give it to you
and then I get it.

650
00:38:28,105 --> 00:38:29,537
You're gonna hurt the baby.

651
00:38:29,889 --> 00:38:31,368
Take the baby out.

652
00:38:32,646 --> 00:38:34,243
Interesting crowd in there.

653
00:38:38,206 --> 00:38:39,692
Same crowd out here.

654
00:38:41,958 --> 00:38:43,445
How about the Einstein thing?

655
00:38:43,727 --> 00:38:46,862
I wonder if ol' Albert Swung
his hips like that when he walked.

656
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:49,400
She probably got her
hair tips from him, too.

657
00:38:49,767 --> 00:38:50,983
Glen is so quiet.

658
00:38:51,207 --> 00:38:52,963
Not to mention wrinkled.

659
00:38:53,517 --> 00:38:55,809
Maybe she hasn't
unpacked her iron, either.

660
00:38:57,333 --> 00:38:58,538
Christmas paper?

661
00:38:59,022 --> 00:39:00,022
Please.

662
00:39:00,706 --> 00:39:01,706
She works.

663
00:39:02,208 --> 00:39:03,943
It has to be hard
to run a house, too.

664
00:39:05,043 --> 00:39:07,062
Manning a counter at a jewelry store?

665
00:39:07,521 --> 00:39:08,648
It's not that demanding.

666
00:39:08,895 --> 00:39:12,288
I Don't know. I had a job in sales
before I was a mom.

667
00:39:13,647 --> 00:39:14,983
Have you seen my mom?

668
00:39:15,828 --> 00:39:18,071
No, honey. Maybe she's
in the dining room.

669
00:39:21,647 --> 00:39:22,647
Betty?

670
00:39:22,831 --> 00:39:23,831
What?

671
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:40,084
Don, will you please go
to hightop and get the cake?

672
00:39:53,302 --> 00:39:54,688
Don't run in the house.

673
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,472
What is going on in here?

674
00:39:56,836 --> 00:39:58,199
Your kid knocked over a drink.

675
00:39:58,907 --> 00:40:01,138
You need to tell him
this is not a jungle gym.

676
00:40:01,806 --> 00:40:04,847
Ernie, did you hear
what mr. Farrelly said?

677
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:08,235
Did you say you were sorry?

678
00:40:09,262 --> 00:40:10,384
Do you want some more.

679
00:40:10,543 --> 00:40:12,022
No, come on.

680
00:40:13,209 --> 00:40:14,320
He heard me.

681
00:40:14,673 --> 00:40:17,361
Go get your mother and
have her clean this up.

682
00:40:56,295 --> 00:40:57,570
okay, thank you.

683
00:41:01,355 --> 00:41:03,527
The woman at the bakery
said he picked up the cake

684
00:41:03,692 --> 00:41:04,936
almost an hour ago.

685
00:41:06,009 --> 00:41:07,459
Do you think he had an accident?

686
00:41:07,694 --> 00:41:08,716
Let's go.

687
00:41:08,907 --> 00:41:10,466
We haven't done birthday cake.

688
00:41:10,632 --> 00:41:12,167
There's not gonna be a cake.

689
00:41:12,321 --> 00:41:13,764
Am I the only one that knows that?

690
00:41:15,884 --> 00:41:18,096
Don Draper,
you are a first class heel,

691
00:41:18,259 --> 00:41:19,510
and I salute you.

692
00:41:20,884 --> 00:41:21,899
Let's go.

693
00:41:22,197 --> 00:41:23,512
Swell party. Food was delicious.

694
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:32,745
I might have a cake.

695
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:34,810
A sara lee in my freezer.

696
00:41:36,587 --> 00:41:37,803
Well, could you go get it?

697
00:41:37,927 --> 00:41:39,724
Please, that would be so great.

698
00:42:07,547 --> 00:42:09,320
Happy birthday, little baby.

699
00:43:28,657 --> 00:43:29,826
Daddy!

700
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:39,640
Mommy, mommy, look!

701
00:43:40,076 --> 00:43:41,844
Daddy got me a doggie!

702
00:43:45,014 --> 00:43:46,847
I Don't even know what to say.

703
00:43:48,012 --> 00:43:49,487
I want to name her...

704
00:43:49,617 --> 00:43:50,636
Polly!

705
00:43:50,773 --> 00:43:52,076
Polly doggie.

706
00:44:11,451 --> 00:44:13,019
Happy birthday, baby.
