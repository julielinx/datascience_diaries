1
00:00:00,117 --> 00:00:02,336
Previously on Mad Men.

2
00:00:02,456 --> 00:00:03,920
Tell them I want a partnership.

3
00:00:04,401 --> 00:00:05,458
Not silent.

4
00:00:05,869 --> 00:00:09,108
How am I supposed to
find $8000 in two days?

5
00:00:11,315 --> 00:00:14,390
They'll bury your desk in awards, 
but they'll never work with you.

6
00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:16,104
Not after that letter.

7
00:00:17,478 --> 00:00:18,827
Bye.

8
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:20,494
I'll see you in two weeks.

9
00:00:21,503 --> 00:00:23,839
Jaguar is calling the
president every agency

10
00:00:25,928 --> 00:00:27,020
well that is terrific news.

11
00:00:27,286 --> 00:00:28,894
Bravo!

12
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:51,325
Sync and corrections by Sp8ky for
www.Addic7ed.Com

13
00:01:10,795 --> 00:01:12,261
Buongiorno, Gino.

14
00:01:12,296 --> 00:01:14,197
Mr. Covington, you're early.

15
00:01:14,231 --> 00:01:17,334
I'm not in a rush, believe me.

16
00:01:18,902 --> 00:01:20,603
Don?

17
00:01:20,638 --> 00:01:23,039
Jed, Jed Covington from Dancer.

18
00:01:23,073 --> 00:01:25,074
Jed, nice to see you.

19
00:01:25,108 --> 00:01:27,175
Please have a seat.
I'm almost finished here.

20
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,244
Believe me, he's
impossible to bother.

21
00:01:29,278 --> 00:01:31,046
This is a man who won Jaguar.

22
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,180
What is that?

23
00:01:32,215 --> 00:01:35,917
It's like an expensive,
unreliable Dodge.

24
00:01:35,952 --> 00:01:37,252
What, they didn't go for that?

25
00:01:37,286 --> 00:01:39,455
We tried writing sexy
like you did,

26
00:01:39,489 --> 00:01:42,122
but frankly our creative
went home early.

27
00:01:42,157 --> 00:01:45,097
Well, we'll see what's left of what we
did after working with them for a month.

28
00:01:45,217 --> 00:01:46,618
And Peter...

29
00:01:46,909 --> 00:01:48,787
Campbell, is that his name?

30
00:01:49,732 --> 00:01:51,566
Boy, were they
impressed with him.

31
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,470
This is a big win
for your little agency.

32
00:02:00,742 --> 00:02:02,108
You really eat English muffins?

33
00:02:02,142 --> 00:02:04,077
Yes, but they're not English.

34
00:02:04,111 --> 00:02:07,547
Well, to those of us at 4 A's,
everything about you is American...

35
00:02:07,582 --> 00:02:10,171
your sense of humor,
your hard work.

36
00:02:10,668 --> 00:02:13,410
A lot of people join
professional associations

37
00:02:13,653 --> 00:02:16,154
And just use it
as an excuse to drink

38
00:02:16,189 --> 00:02:17,623
and hand out business cards.

39
00:02:17,657 --> 00:02:20,659
Well, there has been
a bit of that.

40
00:02:20,694 --> 00:02:24,797
There's an unelected position as head
of our fiscal control committee.

41
00:02:26,032 --> 00:02:28,000
We'd be honored
to have you run it.

42
00:02:28,034 --> 00:02:31,436
I'm sure there are
others more deserving.

43
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:34,406
Who? 15 months after
losing Lucky Strike

44
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,609
to landing a car...
you kept that place afloat.

45
00:02:37,643 --> 00:02:39,811
I suppose the world
could see it that way.

46
00:02:39,845 --> 00:02:42,113
Well, the 4 A's could use
a little of that.

47
00:02:42,147 --> 00:02:46,149
And there's a little trip
to the greenbrier

48
00:02:46,183 --> 00:02:49,720
for the conference
with wives... or without.

49
00:02:50,822 --> 00:02:53,624
Well, I suppose I accept.

50
00:02:53,658 --> 00:02:55,559
But don't expect any miracles.

51
00:02:55,593 --> 00:02:57,694
Great.
And don't be so modest.

52
00:03:01,665 --> 00:03:03,299
<i>Thank you, gentlemen.</i>

53
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:06,368
This shouldn't be
longer than an hour.

54
00:03:07,871 --> 00:03:10,706
Scarlett, you have to make
sure the freelance squatters

55
00:03:10,741 --> 00:03:12,475
are relocated before
the partners meeting.

56
00:03:13,577 --> 00:03:16,879
- Also?
- Also there should be Danish.

57
00:03:18,014 --> 00:03:20,950
- All partners present?
- Aye.

58
00:03:20,984 --> 00:03:22,918
Shall we begin
with old business?

59
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:25,187
- Ongoing.
- Ongoing.

60
00:03:25,221 --> 00:03:26,655
If I may begin.

61
00:03:26,689 --> 00:03:29,230
We've received a confusing
request from Jaguar.

62
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,341
They want to explore the
idea of going with a fee structure.

63
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:33,028
as opposed to
straight commission.

64
00:03:33,063 --> 00:03:36,497
- Is there a difference?
- Well, it's a very interesting issue.

65
00:03:36,531 --> 00:03:38,732
In its most simplistic form,

66
00:03:38,767 --> 00:03:40,868
the money we receive
for work on an account

67
00:03:40,902 --> 00:03:44,905
is derived from the 15% commission
included in our media purchases,

68
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,841
plus the markup
on production costs.

69
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:49,010
But under a fee structure,

70
00:03:49,044 --> 00:03:52,212
the client merely pays
for the work being done,

71
00:03:52,246 --> 00:03:56,016
plus a negotiated
11/2-2% profit.

72
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:58,251
Well, that is interesting.

73
00:03:58,286 --> 00:04:00,087
The client asked for it.
That's not good.

74
00:04:00,121 --> 00:04:02,055
What if Dunlop tires
wants to do that?

75
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:03,556
That's a good hypothetical.

76
00:04:03,591 --> 00:04:06,092
If they can get it,
won't everyone want it?

77
00:04:06,126 --> 00:04:07,893
Whatever it is?

78
00:04:07,927 --> 00:04:11,497
It's not hypothetical. Dunlop called last night.
They'd like to meet.

79
00:04:11,531 --> 00:04:13,032
Well, why didn't
you say something?

80
00:04:13,066 --> 00:04:14,700
I was going to wait
for new business.

81
00:04:14,734 --> 00:04:19,038
- Is it new business yet?
- I don't know.

82
00:04:19,072 --> 00:04:21,173
- What are the billings?
- A little under a million

83
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:22,907
including sporting goods
and tubing.

84
00:04:22,941 --> 00:04:24,575
But every Jaguar wears them,

85
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:26,378
so you know they've heard
good things about us.

86
00:04:26,412 --> 00:04:30,648
Incoming calls... what a welcoming sound.
Thank you Mr. Campbell.

87
00:04:30,682 --> 00:04:32,283
Shouldn't we have a vote

88
00:04:32,318 --> 00:04:35,553
on the fee versus
commission, um, question?

89
00:04:35,587 --> 00:04:38,055
I already said no.

90
00:04:38,089 --> 00:04:40,624
Or should I leave so you all
can do whatever you want?

91
00:04:42,394 --> 00:04:44,028
I move we tell them
we'll look into it,

92
00:04:44,062 --> 00:04:45,496
and then we'll look into it.

93
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:47,197
I second that.

94
00:04:47,232 --> 00:04:50,834
All in favor?

95
00:04:50,868 --> 00:04:53,904
So more new business?
Back to ongoing business?

96
00:04:53,938 --> 00:04:56,605
Do we have any birthdays?

97
00:04:58,063 --> 00:04:59,678
Is there a TV there?

98
00:04:59,951 --> 00:05:01,525
Tonight's Wild Wild West.

99
00:05:01,645 --> 00:05:03,812
You guys will miss school and
you're getting to go skiing.

100
00:05:03,847 --> 00:05:06,916
I think the wild west
is very low on that list.

101
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,518
Now put your bowl in the sink
and go get dressed.

102
00:05:08,552 --> 00:05:12,054
Henry will be home in an hour.
I wanna beat the traffic.

103
00:05:12,088 --> 00:05:15,357
Try these.They're the biggest.

104
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:17,359
I don't wanna wear
someone else's shoes,

105
00:05:17,393 --> 00:05:19,161
especially ski boots.

106
00:05:19,195 --> 00:05:20,529
You know that they're sweaty.

107
00:05:20,564 --> 00:05:22,998
Oh, my gosh!

108
00:05:23,033 --> 00:05:25,901
- Try them on.
- Eleanor has smaller feet than me now.

109
00:05:25,936 --> 00:05:27,647
And I'm not going
skiing anyway.

110
00:05:27,767 --> 00:05:30,201
You think you're going to sit in
the lodge and read a book, forget it.

111
00:05:30,573 --> 00:05:33,441
I would have rather gone to school and
come home and found you all gone.

112
00:05:33,475 --> 00:05:36,277
Is this your plan...
to ruin our ski trip?

113
00:05:36,311 --> 00:05:39,113
I'm old enough that I can stay alone
while you go laugh your heads off.

114
00:05:39,147 --> 00:05:40,882
Fine! I'll leave you
locked in a trunk.

115
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:42,516
Just let me go to daddy's.

116
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:44,117
Do they ever take you
on vacation?

117
00:05:44,151 --> 00:05:47,353
Megan and daddy took me
to Disneyland where it's warm.

118
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:49,422
You want to spend
the weekend there with her

119
00:05:49,457 --> 00:05:51,257
because she lets you do
whatever you want?

120
00:05:51,292 --> 00:05:53,393
She lets me eat
whatever I want.

121
00:05:54,862 --> 00:05:58,364
<i>Mrs. Francis on line 1.</i>

122
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,899
Hello?

123
00:05:59,933 --> 00:06:01,397
I wanted to know if you
would have any problem

124
00:06:01,434 --> 00:06:03,435
with me strangling Sally.

125
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,805
Should we be having this
conversation on the phone?

126
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:08,140
I'm not joking.
She's fresh.

127
00:06:08,174 --> 00:06:11,343
And I'd prefer not to have
her sour puss ruining our trip!

128
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:15,113
Well, if you think killing her
is the only way out of that.

129
00:06:15,147 --> 00:06:16,915
We're dropping her off.

130
00:06:16,949 --> 00:06:19,217
- <i>Mr. Cooper here to see you.</i>
- Send him in.

131
00:06:19,251 --> 00:06:20,685
I'm gonna be busy all weekend.

132
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,054
It's your child bride
she wants to spend time with.

133
00:06:23,089 --> 00:06:25,123
Are you still asking
for a favor?

134
00:06:25,157 --> 00:06:26,324
I'm not asking.

135
00:06:26,358 --> 00:06:28,159
<i>We're dropping her off</i>
<i>in an hour</i>

136
00:06:28,193 --> 00:06:31,394
and she can sleep with the
doorman for all I care.

137
00:06:34,465 --> 00:06:38,301
I have a question I don't know how to
phrase other than as an accusation.

138
00:06:38,336 --> 00:06:42,673
- What?
- I took it upon myself to evaluate the fee issue.

139
00:06:42,707 --> 00:06:44,541
And upon examination
of our books,

140
00:06:44,575 --> 00:06:49,378
I found this canceled check
in an unopened statement.

141
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:54,017
<i>I'd ask you</i>
<i>if you knew about it,</i>

142
00:06:54,051 --> 00:06:55,952
but your signature's
on the check.

143
00:06:57,921 --> 00:07:01,557
- So it is.
- I thought we agreed to forego bonuses.

144
00:07:01,591 --> 00:07:03,725
- We did.
- And yet you gave him one.

145
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:07,029
Bert, I'll take care of it.

146
00:07:07,063 --> 00:07:09,798
You know, you can't keep
being the good little boy

147
00:07:09,832 --> 00:07:12,434
while the adults
run this business.

148
00:07:20,676 --> 00:07:23,077
Dawn, could you get
Mr. Pryce in here?

149
00:07:41,062 --> 00:07:43,029
- You wanted to see me?
- Close the door.

150
00:07:49,003 --> 00:07:51,270
Did you hear about the 4 A's?

151
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:54,873
I hope it's all right.
I accepted on behalf of the firm.

152
00:07:54,908 --> 00:07:56,576
What the hell is this?

153
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,514
Oh, this.

154
00:08:01,548 --> 00:08:03,182
Uh, I remember.

155
00:08:03,217 --> 00:08:05,351
I didn't sign it.

156
00:08:05,385 --> 00:08:07,885
Of course you did.
Right there.

157
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,387
You want me to play detective?

158
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:13,157
- Don, we all sign a lot of things.
- Is this the only one?

159
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:16,528
I won't sit here and bear
this interrogation.

160
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:18,796
You want a professional
to do it?

161
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:26,903
I'm giving you a chance to come clean.

162
00:08:26,938 --> 00:08:28,805
Is this the only one?

163
00:08:40,517 --> 00:08:41,984
How did you get this?

164
00:08:44,722 --> 00:08:48,358
Cooper opened the latest bank
statement and the books.

165
00:08:54,931 --> 00:08:57,098
It was a 13-day loan.

166
00:08:57,133 --> 00:08:59,568
But then we canceled
the bonuses.

167
00:08:59,602 --> 00:09:03,739
You delayed them,
and then you canceled them.

168
00:09:03,773 --> 00:09:06,441
Then you wanted
the money for Joan.

169
00:09:06,476 --> 00:09:08,510
And I'm the one
who's committed the crime?

170
00:09:08,544 --> 00:09:10,689
- Are you gambling?
- No.

171
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,591
I owe taxes on my portfolio.

172
00:09:13,711 --> 00:09:14,775
Which I liquidated

173
00:09:14,816 --> 00:09:18,552
to put $50,000 into this firm
after we lost Lucky Strike.

174
00:09:18,587 --> 00:09:20,488
If you needed it so badly,
why didn't you ask?

175
00:09:20,522 --> 00:09:25,092
Why suffer the humiliation
for a 13-day loan?

176
00:09:25,126 --> 00:09:26,927
That was my money!

177
00:09:31,766 --> 00:09:33,667
I'm gonna need
your resignation.

178
00:09:35,102 --> 00:09:37,737
Just a moment.

179
00:09:37,772 --> 00:09:42,642
I'm sorry and I am remorseful.

180
00:09:42,677 --> 00:09:45,577
I don't know
how it came to this,

181
00:09:45,612 --> 00:09:47,579
but the company's
in ship shape.

182
00:09:47,614 --> 00:09:50,982
And I will make good by easter,

183
00:09:51,017 --> 00:09:53,485
even if I have to pull
my son out of school.

184
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:57,323
You embezzled funds
and you forged my signature.

185
00:09:57,357 --> 00:10:01,192
I apologize deeply
for involving you.

186
00:10:03,195 --> 00:10:06,731
I suppose I picked you because you've
always been the most decent to me.

187
00:10:06,765 --> 00:10:10,835
I'm doing the most decent thing
I could possibly do, Lane.

188
00:10:10,869 --> 00:10:12,437
I'm letting you resign.

189
00:10:14,172 --> 00:10:15,972
I have never been compensated

190
00:10:16,006 --> 00:10:18,575
for my contributions
to this company,

191
00:10:18,609 --> 00:10:21,645
including my role
in its very existence.

192
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,515
Who would ever have dreamt
of the word Jaguar, hmm?

193
00:10:29,353 --> 00:10:33,089
I took away nothing from P.P.L.
While you lined your pockets.

194
00:10:33,123 --> 00:10:37,093
And I have operated
on a loss for three years!

195
00:10:38,462 --> 00:10:40,495
Please reconsider.

196
00:10:43,933 --> 00:10:46,368
I'm sorry.

197
00:10:46,402 --> 00:10:48,403
I can't trust you.

198
00:10:50,473 --> 00:10:51,940
I'll cover the money
that you owe.

199
00:10:53,576 --> 00:10:57,044
That 7,500 is nothing to you.

200
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,582
Do you know
how the rest of us live?

201
00:11:01,616 --> 00:11:03,985
And in the end, who's
been harmed, really, hmm?

202
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:06,187
Can you imagine what would
happen if a client found out?

203
00:11:07,389 --> 00:11:10,691
I'll lose my visa.

204
00:11:10,725 --> 00:11:14,627
I can't go back to
England, not like this.

205
00:11:14,661 --> 00:11:18,198
What would I tell my wife?

206
00:11:18,232 --> 00:11:22,302
What would I tell my son?

207
00:11:22,336 --> 00:11:26,639
You'll tell them that it didn't
work out because it didn't.

208
00:11:26,673 --> 00:11:30,009
And you'll tell them
the next thing will be better,

209
00:11:30,043 --> 00:11:31,676
because it always is.

210
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:39,285
Take the weekend.

211
00:11:39,319 --> 00:11:41,753
Think about an elegant exit.

212
00:11:41,788 --> 00:11:43,555
Cooper doesn't know anything.

213
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,381
I feel a bit
light-headed.

214
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:13,417
That's relief.

215
00:12:15,619 --> 00:12:19,922
I've started over a lot, Lane.

216
00:12:19,957 --> 00:12:22,624
This is the worst part.

217
00:12:50,051 --> 00:12:52,252
Were you celebrating with Don?

218
00:12:52,287 --> 00:12:54,054
Celebrating?

219
00:12:54,089 --> 00:12:56,256
Scarlett told me about
your 4 A's chairmanship.

220
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:58,359
Congratulations.

221
00:12:58,393 --> 00:13:00,060
You look busy.

222
00:13:00,095 --> 00:13:03,130
I'm thinking about taking
a vacation this easter.

223
00:13:03,164 --> 00:13:05,498
Oh.

224
00:13:05,532 --> 00:13:07,400
Where are we going?

225
00:13:07,434 --> 00:13:10,536
Do you think there is a difference
between Bermuda and Hawaii?

226
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:14,807
Well, neither is suitable for commemorating
the death and resurrection of our Lord.

227
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:18,844
Can you imagine me
locked in a hotel room

228
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:20,380
with a baby and my mother?

229
00:13:20,414 --> 00:13:22,615
I suppose you'd rather
I imagined you

230
00:13:22,649 --> 00:13:25,985
bouncing in the sand
in some obscene bikini.

231
00:13:27,587 --> 00:13:30,222
I think you should take
your party elsewhere.

232
00:13:31,658 --> 00:13:34,860
Well...
Bon voyage.

233
00:14:21,603 --> 00:14:24,995
I had to get up very early 
this morning. To go to work.

234
00:14:25,145 --> 00:14:29,382
To make more money,
buy you more champagne.

235
00:14:32,018 --> 00:14:33,952
Go back to bed.

236
00:14:36,389 --> 00:14:39,491
She's a 25-year-old coat
check girl from Long Island

237
00:14:39,525 --> 00:14:41,660
or Rhode Island.

238
00:14:41,694 --> 00:14:44,796
She'd never had room service before.
It's too easy.

239
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:46,964
Why do we do this?

240
00:14:46,999 --> 00:14:48,433
For the sex,

241
00:14:48,467 --> 00:14:50,201
but it's always disappointing.

242
00:14:50,235 --> 00:14:51,802
For me, anyway.

243
00:14:51,836 --> 00:14:53,704
I don't like what we're doing.

244
00:14:53,738 --> 00:14:55,172
So you're drinking
with a purpose.

245
00:14:55,206 --> 00:14:58,175
I'm tired of this piddly shit.

246
00:14:58,209 --> 00:15:01,111
I'm tired of living in this
delusion that we're going somewhere

247
00:15:01,145 --> 00:15:02,913
when we can't even give
Christmas bonuses.

248
00:15:02,947 --> 00:15:06,080
What about your speech about how
we were arriving and so forth?

249
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,794
Or how we arrived.
I don't remember but it was good.

250
00:15:09,019 --> 00:15:10,386
So you feel different
since Jaguar?

251
00:15:10,421 --> 00:15:12,254
- We're getting incoming calls.
- Pete is.

252
00:15:12,289 --> 00:15:14,123
Look, I don't like him, but he's
kind of turned things around.

253
00:15:14,157 --> 00:15:15,425
He still thinks small.

254
00:15:15,459 --> 00:15:18,661
Dunlop's another Topaz.
It's another Mohawk.

255
00:15:18,696 --> 00:15:20,463
It's another coat check girl.

256
00:15:20,497 --> 00:15:22,298
- So you don't want it?
- No.

257
00:15:22,332 --> 00:15:24,966
I don't want Jaguar;
I want Chevy.

258
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,501
I don't want Mohawk;
I want American.

259
00:15:26,536 --> 00:15:28,370
I don't want Dunlop;
I want Firestone.

260
00:15:28,404 --> 00:15:30,872
Don't yell at me.
I'd love to have Firestone.

261
00:15:30,906 --> 00:15:32,708
I spent the night
at the American Cancer Society

262
00:15:32,742 --> 00:15:34,343
with my hand
in Jim Barton's pocket

263
00:15:34,377 --> 00:15:36,211
and you told me I was wasting my time.
You told me he was dead.

264
00:15:36,245 --> 00:15:38,346
Because Ed Baxter told me
the Lucky Strike letter

265
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,880
poisoned us with all
those companies.

266
00:15:39,914 --> 00:15:41,915
What? Why didn't
you tell me that?

267
00:15:43,218 --> 00:15:45,886
Because I wrote that letter.

268
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,289
You let that wax figurine
discourage you?

269
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:51,625
Why didn't you just ask me?
I'll get you a meeting with Firestone.

270
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:54,494
- It doesn't mean it's not true.
- Jesus, Don.

271
00:15:54,528 --> 00:15:57,296
You used to love no.
No used to make you hard.

272
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:59,532
<i>And whether you admit it or
not, things have changed.</i>

273
00:15:59,567 --> 00:16:01,267
You just beat out
two huge firms

274
00:16:01,301 --> 00:16:02,869
for that shitty car account.

275
00:16:02,903 --> 00:16:06,773
Caroline, get me James
Barton at Firestone tires.

276
00:16:09,877 --> 00:16:13,246
- No, get Ed Baxter.
- Let that go.

277
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,447
What's down chemical bill?
20 million?

278
00:16:15,482 --> 00:16:17,183
It's about the same size
as Lucky Strike.

279
00:16:17,217 --> 00:16:20,619
I'm telling you, Ed Baxter is Moby Dick.
There are easier whales.

280
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:23,155
So you can't get me a meeting.
They're three buildings away.

281
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,891
Look, I'm sure
he'll meet with you,

282
00:16:24,925 --> 00:16:27,658
even if it's just to watch you
eat shit, but it's complicated.

283
00:16:27,693 --> 00:16:29,394
What about Kenny?

284
00:16:29,428 --> 00:16:32,030
In case you've forgotten, he squeamish
about working with his family.

285
00:16:32,064 --> 00:16:34,232
Then fire him.

286
00:16:45,877 --> 00:16:48,345
- Hi!
- What are you doing here?

287
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,547
My dad didn't even
tell you, did he?

288
00:16:50,581 --> 00:16:53,550
I'm spending the weekend
here because I didn't want to go skiing.

289
00:16:54,985 --> 00:16:57,320
I thought you'd be excited.

290
00:16:57,354 --> 00:17:00,323
I just didn't know.
What's wrong with skiing?

291
00:17:00,357 --> 00:17:03,359
I hate her so much.
She's such a phony.

292
00:17:03,394 --> 00:17:05,461
You know that's not true.

293
00:17:05,462 --> 00:17:07,463
Can we have tea?

294
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:11,801
Go ahead and put the water out.

295
00:17:17,373 --> 00:17:18,974
Sorry I'm late.

296
00:17:19,008 --> 00:17:20,475
I don't mind waiting
20 minutes for an unspecified

297
00:17:20,509 --> 00:17:22,176
meeting with my boss.

298
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:24,679
I mean, it's not like your imagination
would run wild.

299
00:17:27,282 --> 00:17:29,684
So we're going after
your father-in-law.

300
00:17:31,086 --> 00:17:32,554
I see.

301
00:17:32,588 --> 00:17:34,288
Well, I've told you before,
I can't help with that.

302
00:17:34,323 --> 00:17:37,123
- That's what I'm counting on.
- What the hell does that mean?

303
00:17:37,158 --> 00:17:39,593
We want the business and it
has nothing to do with you.

304
00:17:39,627 --> 00:17:41,728
And we'd like to keep it
that way, since you'd prefer

305
00:17:41,763 --> 00:17:45,031
not to jeopardize your
relationship with your wife.

306
00:17:45,066 --> 00:17:47,601
So what do you
think's gonna happen

307
00:17:47,635 --> 00:17:49,436
when Ed calls me
the minute you call him?

308
00:17:49,471 --> 00:17:51,872
I don't know.

309
00:17:53,774 --> 00:17:56,642
I suppose you could
not answer the phone.

310
00:17:56,677 --> 00:17:58,644
You might be having
a drink with your boss.

311
00:18:00,547 --> 00:18:03,583
That's very smart.

312
00:18:03,617 --> 00:18:06,786
I guess there's nothing
I can do to muck it up now.

313
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,787
What the hell does that mean?

314
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:12,824
Well, I'd hate to bring
it up with Cynthia,

315
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:15,259
even by accident.

316
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:17,863
Look at you.

317
00:18:19,101 --> 00:18:20,622
What would it take for you to do nothing?

318
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:23,902
Some kind of partnership,
assuming it works out?

319
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,970
No, I don't want to
be your partner.

320
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:27,538
Not seeing what's involved.

321
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:33,878
All I need is a promise
that if you get it,

322
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:35,379
you'll force me on it.

323
00:18:35,413 --> 00:18:37,815
Okay.

324
00:18:37,849 --> 00:18:39,884
You really fought us.

325
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:41,784
And two other things.

326
00:18:42,987 --> 00:18:45,154
Pete doesn't go to the meeting

327
00:18:45,188 --> 00:18:47,289
and Pete doesn't go
to any meetings.

328
00:18:52,329 --> 00:18:54,531
As you were.

329
00:19:07,343 --> 00:19:10,913
- Where are you coming from?
- Hemisphere club.

330
00:19:12,448 --> 00:19:15,182
I've got good news.
I talked to Ed.

331
00:19:15,216 --> 00:19:17,518
- What did he say?
- That he'll see you Monday morning.

332
00:19:17,553 --> 00:19:19,987
Monday?
Are you kidding me?

333
00:19:22,323 --> 00:19:24,725
You said to get you a meeting,
I got you a meeting.

334
00:19:26,161 --> 00:19:27,728
You think this is
a serious meeting,

335
00:19:27,763 --> 00:19:29,495
giving me 48 hours to prepare?

336
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:32,131
I think that's up to you.

337
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:33,767
Don't lose your nerve.

338
00:19:33,801 --> 00:19:36,036
I like that guy I saw today.

339
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:38,805
I missed him.

340
00:19:46,713 --> 00:19:49,414
Oh. When'd you get here?

341
00:19:49,449 --> 00:19:52,451
After lunch.
They couldn't wait to get rid of me.

342
00:19:52,485 --> 00:19:55,287
- Where's Megan?
- Taking a nap.

343
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,895
- I love when you surprise me.
- I forgot about it.

344
00:20:03,929 --> 00:20:06,298
Well, don't forget Betty's not
coming home until Monday afternoon,

345
00:20:06,332 --> 00:20:08,266
so you can drive her
out to school Monday morning.

346
00:20:08,301 --> 00:20:10,402
I have a meeting.
You'll have to do it.

347
00:20:10,436 --> 00:20:12,971
I have an audition.
I'm gonna be gone all morning.

348
00:20:15,575 --> 00:20:17,108
Sally, you're gonna be here
alone Monday morning.

349
00:20:17,142 --> 00:20:18,742
<i>Megan's got plans until lunch.</i>

350
00:20:18,776 --> 00:20:20,344
- I have school.
- Not any more.

351
00:20:20,378 --> 00:20:24,014
Turn off the damn TV.

352
00:20:24,048 --> 00:20:25,516
Anything else?

353
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:27,718
You don't even call me?

354
00:20:27,752 --> 00:20:29,487
Do you know
how insulting it is,

355
00:20:29,521 --> 00:20:31,589
the assumption that I have
nothing else to do?

356
00:20:31,623 --> 00:20:33,789
I had to fire Lane today.

357
00:20:33,824 --> 00:20:35,658
What?

358
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:38,228
What happened?

359
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:44,967
He stole money
from the company.

360
00:20:45,002 --> 00:20:47,470
He seems so honest.

361
00:20:47,505 --> 00:20:48,938
Why would he do that?

362
00:20:48,972 --> 00:20:51,006
What's the difference?

363
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,742
It's all just gossip
at a certain point.

364
00:20:53,776 --> 00:20:55,810
You can't tell anyone.

365
00:20:57,913 --> 00:20:59,548
Is the firm okay?

366
00:20:59,582 --> 00:21:01,650
We'll be fine.

367
00:21:01,684 --> 00:21:04,753
Did you eat or just drink?

368
00:21:04,787 --> 00:21:06,454
I'm not hungry.

369
00:21:06,488 --> 00:21:09,790
Well, you're gonna have
dinner with your daughter.

370
00:21:09,824 --> 00:21:12,226
- I have a lot of work to do.
- So do I.

371
00:21:12,261 --> 00:21:13,761
After dinner.

372
00:21:19,268 --> 00:21:22,202
- What are you doing there?
- We're going to dinner.

373
00:21:22,203 --> 00:21:25,805
- No, dear.
- We're going to celebrate.

374
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:28,642
- More, obviously.
- No, damn it.

375
00:21:28,676 --> 00:21:31,010
What's gotten into you?

376
00:21:31,045 --> 00:21:33,946
I've had a dreadful day, dear.

377
00:21:33,981 --> 00:21:36,550
Not all of it.

378
00:21:36,584 --> 00:21:40,786
I'm tired of you refusing to recognize
the successes when they come.

379
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:43,455
I know your work
is unpleasant sometimes,

380
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:45,658
but I'm very proud of you.

381
00:21:45,692 --> 00:21:48,594
You're very kind.

382
00:21:48,628 --> 00:21:52,030
You obviously had a good day
that turned into a bad day

383
00:21:52,065 --> 00:21:55,032
and you drank too much.

384
00:21:55,067 --> 00:21:57,535
But you came home
to me on time.

385
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:59,804
Now you're taking me to dinner.

386
00:21:59,838 --> 00:22:01,806
No arguments.

387
00:22:07,246 --> 00:22:10,414
Can't we just take a cab?

388
00:22:13,718 --> 00:22:15,919
I thought racing green.

389
00:22:28,665 --> 00:22:32,301
- How did you get this?
- I wrote a check.

390
00:22:32,336 --> 00:22:33,970
I hope you're not cross.

391
00:22:34,004 --> 00:22:35,839
You know what?
I don't care if you are.

392
00:22:35,873 --> 00:22:37,473
You never spend on yourself.

393
00:22:37,507 --> 00:22:40,744
It's always about my travel
or Nigel's schooling.

394
00:22:40,778 --> 00:22:42,911
And I told the salesman
you were a partner

395
00:22:42,946 --> 00:22:44,546
at the car's advertising agency

396
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,849
and he gave me
a very fair price.

397
00:22:48,684 --> 00:22:51,553
Come, let's take
a little drive.

398
00:22:51,587 --> 00:22:54,123
It's lovely.

399
00:22:54,157 --> 00:22:56,191
Go on, sit in it.

400
00:23:00,162 --> 00:23:03,297
Oh, dear.
You really did overdo it.

401
00:23:08,472 --> 00:23:11,740
Okay, found it.

402
00:23:11,775 --> 00:23:13,509
You sure you don't wanna come?

403
00:23:13,543 --> 00:23:15,377
He wants to work.
Look at him.

404
00:23:15,412 --> 00:23:16,845
He's got a big meeting
tomorrow.

405
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,346
He'll be miserable.

406
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:25,053
You girls have fun.

407
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:36,497
<i>It's cleared up.</i>

408
00:23:36,532 --> 00:23:38,132
You could just go
round the block

409
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:39,867
if you're still not
feeling steady.

410
00:23:39,902 --> 00:23:41,668
I've work to do.

411
00:23:41,702 --> 00:23:43,503
I don't understand you.

412
00:23:43,538 --> 00:23:47,174
Are you really going to spend
your whole weekend working?

413
00:23:47,615 --> 00:23:49,056
Don't you like your present?

414
00:23:49,176 --> 00:23:52,278
I love the car
and I love you so much,

415
00:23:52,313 --> 00:23:54,147
but I don't feel
right driving it

416
00:23:54,181 --> 00:23:58,651
until I've taken care of some
of these errands I've let go.

417
00:23:58,685 --> 00:24:02,822
There'll be
plenty of time, dear.

418
00:24:02,856 --> 00:24:05,223
You got sick from drink
again yesterday.

419
00:24:05,258 --> 00:24:07,125
Why do you continue?

420
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:10,996
It's cognac.
It settles the stomach.

421
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:14,666
Well, finish up and then
we'll go for a drive.

422
00:24:16,168 --> 00:24:19,136
I don't think there's
really anything to see.

423
00:24:19,171 --> 00:24:22,507
I was telling Sally about
my plan to ensnare David.

424
00:24:22,541 --> 00:24:25,076
Either way, Carter's gonna
wanna rehearse with you alone.

425
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:27,879
- Can I get some coffee?
- I'll have some, too.

426
00:24:27,913 --> 00:24:29,480
He's not gonna
bring you coffee.

427
00:24:29,514 --> 00:24:33,817
Um... "Georgy girl,".

428
00:24:33,852 --> 00:24:36,119
"Alfie," "Gambit,."

429
00:24:36,153 --> 00:24:39,122
"Night of the generals,"
"Blow-up"?

430
00:24:39,156 --> 00:24:41,157
Anything without abortions
or foreigners in it?

431
00:24:41,192 --> 00:24:44,160
Let's see.
"Fistful of dollars."

432
00:24:44,195 --> 00:24:46,796
I think your father would kill
me if I see that without him.

433
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:50,132
So, I don't understand.
Do you like David or Carter?

434
00:24:50,166 --> 00:24:52,134
Well, Carter likes me.

435
00:24:52,168 --> 00:24:53,803
Do you know what he said to me?

436
00:24:53,837 --> 00:24:55,571
I can't believe
I didn't tell you this.

437
00:24:55,606 --> 00:24:57,507
He asked if I was
a redhead everywhere.

438
00:24:57,541 --> 00:25:00,109
Stop! Okay?

439
00:25:00,143 --> 00:25:01,978
No, it's okay.
I have a boyfriend.

440
00:25:02,012 --> 00:25:04,546
- Since when?
- A while.

441
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:06,648
But I don't know
if he likes me that way.

442
00:25:06,682 --> 00:25:09,351
Then he's not a boyfriend.

443
00:25:09,386 --> 00:25:12,754
A lot of great romances
start out as friendships.

444
00:25:12,788 --> 00:25:15,690
A boyfriend's a person

445
00:25:15,725 --> 00:25:18,259
that makes you feel special,

446
00:25:18,293 --> 00:25:19,960
a person that knows you.

447
00:25:19,995 --> 00:25:21,795
And holding hands is plenty.

448
00:25:26,801 --> 00:25:28,702
You should see
if you can get a drink.

449
00:25:28,737 --> 00:25:30,905
I don't want a drink.

450
00:27:11,867 --> 00:27:14,135
- Are you using the lodge phone?
- <i>No.</i>

451
00:27:14,169 --> 00:27:17,371
I told Betty and Henry to take
their ski vacation and shove it.

452
00:27:17,405 --> 00:27:20,675
- Are you stuck with Bluto again?
- No, I'm at Megan's.

453
00:27:20,709 --> 00:27:22,176
That's better, I bet.

454
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:25,680
Actually, I'm gonna be
all alone tomorrow morning.

455
00:27:25,714 --> 00:27:27,181
Wanna come visit me?

456
00:27:27,215 --> 00:27:29,650
- Really?
- You can take the train.

457
00:27:29,684 --> 00:27:31,152
It's not that easy.

458
00:27:31,186 --> 00:27:33,354
I've gotta sneak off campus,
which is serious.

459
00:27:33,388 --> 00:27:35,556
Plus, it's a 20-minute
bike ride to the station

460
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:37,024
and then two hours
on the train.

461
00:27:37,058 --> 00:27:38,725
Forget it.

462
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,328
For a year you've been saying how
much you wanted to visit me.

463
00:27:41,363 --> 00:27:43,130
Are we ever gonna
see each other?

464
00:27:44,165 --> 00:27:45,665
All right.

465
00:27:45,699 --> 00:27:48,000
The earliest I can get
to grand central is 8:30,

466
00:27:48,035 --> 00:27:49,869
but I'm gonna have to work
on my paper tonight

467
00:27:49,903 --> 00:27:51,337
to get it typed tomorrow.

468
00:27:51,372 --> 00:27:54,106
783 park, apartment 17b.

469
00:27:54,141 --> 00:27:56,409
I gotta get a pen.

470
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:27,738
Do your homework, don't use the
juicer, and I'll be home around 1:00.

471
00:28:27,772 --> 00:28:29,707
And the first thing I'm
gonna do is feel that TV.

472
00:28:29,741 --> 00:28:32,542
- Break a leg.
- Thanks.

473
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:46,055
You gonna tell me
what you're gonna talk about

474
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:48,724
or is my look of surprise
part of the sales pitch?

475
00:28:48,758 --> 00:28:50,192
I don't want it
to sound rehearsed.

476
00:28:50,227 --> 00:28:52,894
No danger of that.

477
00:28:54,631 --> 00:28:57,366
Just go in there
and keep your cool.

478
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,168
But if he baits you, I want you
to punch him in the balls.

479
00:29:01,638 --> 00:29:03,971
What happened
to your enlightenment?

480
00:29:04,005 --> 00:29:06,341
I don't know.

481
00:29:06,375 --> 00:29:08,343
It wore off.

482
00:29:08,377 --> 00:29:10,845
<i>Just a minute!</i>

483
00:29:22,557 --> 00:29:25,292
- Hey.
- Come in.

484
00:29:27,462 --> 00:29:29,463
You didn't check the peephole.

485
00:29:29,497 --> 00:29:32,666
I knew it was you, silly.
The doorman sent you up.

486
00:29:34,235 --> 00:29:36,669
- You don't look that different.
- Well, you do.

487
00:29:40,039 --> 00:29:42,808
What do you think?

488
00:29:42,842 --> 00:29:45,811
There's a kid at school whose
parents have one better than this.

489
00:29:45,845 --> 00:29:47,780
It has a second floor.

490
00:29:49,383 --> 00:29:51,883
- Mm, what do you wanna do?
- Are you kidding?

491
00:29:51,917 --> 00:29:53,752
The museum's
right across the park.

492
00:29:53,786 --> 00:29:56,554
We don't go across the park.
There's bums on the other side.

493
00:29:56,589 --> 00:29:58,523
I've got money for a cab.

494
00:29:58,557 --> 00:30:00,992
Okay. Let me get my jacket.

495
00:30:07,699 --> 00:30:10,501
How'd they get
all these animals?

496
00:30:10,535 --> 00:30:12,869
Teddy Roosevelt killed them.

497
00:30:12,904 --> 00:30:15,406
Do you think
they were a family?

498
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,741
I hope so. Otherwise,
what were they doing?

499
00:30:17,776 --> 00:30:21,679
Walking around saying, "we just need
a baby to finish this diorama"?

500
00:30:24,815 --> 00:30:27,624
There's this kid,
Anderson, he's a senior.

501
00:30:27,744 --> 00:30:30,234
He keeps picking fights with
me and he's twice my size.

502
00:30:30,354 --> 00:30:31,854
What a jerk.

503
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:36,959
All the senior lacrosse guys
peed in my locker.

504
00:30:36,993 --> 00:30:39,828
They ruined my jersey.
They're a bunch of sadists.

505
00:30:39,862 --> 00:30:42,497
Henry got picked on
when he was little,

506
00:30:42,532 --> 00:30:44,700
and now he runs a city.

507
00:30:44,734 --> 00:30:47,168
That's true.

508
00:30:49,038 --> 00:30:51,072
I keep wishing
he would leave her.

509
00:30:51,106 --> 00:30:53,308
I know it's wrong.
I feel really bad.

510
00:30:53,343 --> 00:30:56,544
Don't. You can't make
it happen.

511
00:30:59,614 --> 00:31:01,582
Just so you know,
I could get in trouble, too,

512
00:31:01,616 --> 00:31:03,150
but I really wanted to see you.

513
00:31:03,184 --> 00:31:05,353
Yeah, I can't believe
I almost didn't come.

514
00:31:06,755 --> 00:31:08,422
My stomach hurts.

515
00:31:08,457 --> 00:31:11,258
Maybe you're hungry.
Want some caribou?

516
00:31:14,695 --> 00:31:18,998
Listen, I feel kind of bad.

517
00:31:20,501 --> 00:31:23,169
They were teasing me
and I might have told them

518
00:31:23,203 --> 00:31:28,707
that I was coming to the city
to, um... to do it with you.

519
00:31:28,742 --> 00:31:31,777
- Really?
- Yeah.

520
00:31:31,811 --> 00:31:33,345
They don't know
how old you are.

521
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:35,313
I hope that's okay.

522
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:41,387
You can say whatever
you want, but I...

523
00:31:41,421 --> 00:31:43,788
I'm not sure that's
the way I like you.

524
00:31:43,822 --> 00:31:46,290
Yeah, good.

525
00:31:46,324 --> 00:31:48,693
Yeah. I always think
that you're, like,

526
00:31:48,727 --> 00:31:50,728
my little sister, except smart.

527
00:31:50,763 --> 00:31:53,798
You have a mustache.

528
00:31:53,832 --> 00:31:56,434
I usually shave on sunday night.

529
00:31:56,468 --> 00:31:58,969
- I didn't think you'd care.
- I don't like it.

530
00:32:03,474 --> 00:32:05,742
I really don't feel well.
I'll be right back.

531
00:32:05,777 --> 00:32:08,011
Okay.
Meet me in Africa.

532
00:32:26,116 --> 00:32:29,652
<i>Mr. Baxter will see you now.
You can leave your coats.</i>

533
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:33,655
An hour and 45 minutes.

534
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:35,490
Better than I thought.

535
00:32:40,862 --> 00:32:42,763
This is Tom Schafer,
director of marketing.

536
00:32:42,798 --> 00:32:44,732
Jack Schmidt,
head of household.

537
00:32:44,766 --> 00:32:46,733
- Roger Sterling.
- Don Draper.

538
00:32:55,475 --> 00:32:57,577
Ed, you said they're gonna
bring your son-in-law.

539
00:32:57,611 --> 00:32:59,545
Ken knows better.

540
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,815
So, Don, what's so urgent?

541
00:33:01,849 --> 00:33:04,049
I didn't say urgent.
I said imminent.

542
00:33:04,084 --> 00:33:05,751
Well, Ed, I wanna talk
about your business.

543
00:33:05,785 --> 00:33:07,419
What about it?

544
00:33:07,453 --> 00:33:09,321
See, I've been looking
at what you're doing

545
00:33:09,355 --> 00:33:11,123
and I think you're
in desperate need of change.

546
00:33:11,157 --> 00:33:14,426
- And you're just the guy to do it.
- I am.

547
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,394
Are you still the guy
who wrote that letter?

548
00:33:16,429 --> 00:33:17,996
I don't wanna hear
about that letter again.

549
00:33:18,031 --> 00:33:20,098
Do you know how hard we
fought to save that account?

550
00:33:20,132 --> 00:33:21,766
And they stabbed us
first, believe me.

551
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,735
And nobody's gonna wanna be
in the cigarette business.

552
00:33:23,769 --> 00:33:25,603
The government's in the
process of killing it.

553
00:33:25,637 --> 00:33:28,305
- So you're vindictive.
- Not as vindictive as you, apparently.

554
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:31,042
I had a feeling
this is what this was all about.

555
00:33:31,076 --> 00:33:33,544
It's not. This is
about your business.

556
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:35,946
Well, we appreciate that, but
we're very happy with Macmanus.

557
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,447
I'm sure they're
very happy with you,

558
00:33:37,481 --> 00:33:39,216
but you don't
owe them anything.

559
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:41,218
All they have to do is keep
running the same work.

560
00:33:41,252 --> 00:33:42,886
You're on the back burner
over there,

561
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,521
subsidizing all the great
creative work they're doing

562
00:33:45,556 --> 00:33:47,791
and paying for
new business lunches.

563
00:33:47,825 --> 00:33:50,393
As soon as you walk away, that
place will fold up like a tent.

564
00:33:50,427 --> 00:33:53,362
We're at 50% market share
in almost everything we make.

565
00:33:53,396 --> 00:33:56,866
Because you have a big line of
diverse and charismatic products

566
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:01,036
and you keep making more...
Ziptape, Styrofoam, Rovana.

567
00:34:01,071 --> 00:34:02,571
And why do you do that?

568
00:34:02,605 --> 00:34:06,275
Because even though success is a
reality, its effects are temporary.

569
00:34:06,309 --> 00:34:09,210
You get hungry, even though
you've just eaten.

570
00:34:09,245 --> 00:34:11,713
At the old firm, we had
London fog raincoats.

571
00:34:11,748 --> 00:34:14,949
We had a year where we sold
81% of the raincoats

572
00:34:14,984 --> 00:34:16,585
- in the United States.
- Name another raincoat.

573
00:34:16,619 --> 00:34:18,086
But we didn't stop
working for them

574
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,555
because 81% isn't enough.

575
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:22,291
Tell me about napalm.

576
00:34:22,325 --> 00:34:25,068
You mean that stuff those kids
outside your building are screaming about?

577
00:34:26,027 --> 00:34:28,228
Napalm was invented in 1942.

578
00:34:28,263 --> 00:34:31,031
The government put it in
flamethrowers against the Nazis,

579
00:34:31,065 --> 00:34:32,733
impact bombs against
the Japanese.

580
00:34:32,768 --> 00:34:34,635
It was all over Korea.
I was there.

581
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:36,370
And now it's in Vietnam.

582
00:34:36,405 --> 00:34:39,673
But the important thing is when our
boys are fighting and they need it,

583
00:34:39,707 --> 00:34:42,909
America needs it,
Dow makes it and it works.

584
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,079
But it doesn't change the fact

585
00:34:47,114 --> 00:34:48,348
that we're happy
with our agency.

586
00:34:48,382 --> 00:34:50,917
Are you?
You're happy with 50%?

587
00:34:50,951 --> 00:34:52,652
You're on top
and you don't have enough.

588
00:34:52,687 --> 00:34:55,121
You're happy because
you're successful for now.

589
00:34:55,155 --> 00:34:56,622
But what is happiness?

590
00:34:56,656 --> 00:34:58,490
It's a moment before
you need more happiness.

591
00:34:58,525 --> 00:35:01,126
I won't settle for 50% of anything.
I want 100%.

592
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,995
You're happy with your agency?
You're not happy with anything.

593
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:06,465
You don't want most of it.
You want all of it.

594
00:35:06,499 --> 00:35:08,967
And I won't stop
until you get all of it.

595
00:35:10,537 --> 00:35:12,236
Thank you for your time.

596
00:35:14,272 --> 00:35:15,873
Thank you for stopping by.

597
00:35:22,748 --> 00:35:26,351
I'll buy you a drink if you
wipe the blood off your mouth.

598
00:35:32,056 --> 00:35:33,724
Sally?

599
00:35:37,895 --> 00:35:39,730
Sally?

600
00:35:42,834 --> 00:35:44,834
<i>Sally!</i>

601
00:35:44,868 --> 00:35:48,270
- What's going on?
- She just pulled up in a cab with a $25 fare.

602
00:35:48,304 --> 00:35:49,772
I got it.

603
00:35:51,541 --> 00:35:53,909
Sally? Let me in.

604
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:55,878
<i>Is Henry out there?</i>

605
00:35:55,912 --> 00:35:58,514
No. Let me in.

606
00:36:02,918 --> 00:36:05,453
I got my...
my period started

607
00:36:05,488 --> 00:36:07,689
and I didn't know what to do.

608
00:36:10,325 --> 00:36:12,059
I just wanted to come home.

609
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:16,229
It's okay.
We'll take care of it.

610
00:36:20,234 --> 00:36:22,302
It's okay, sweetheart.

611
00:36:24,506 --> 00:36:26,473
It's okay.

612
00:36:30,445 --> 00:36:33,913
- I'm sorry to bother you, but can I leave these here?
- Why?

613
00:36:33,947 --> 00:36:36,382
Mr. Pryce hasn't come in yet
and his door is locked,

614
00:36:36,417 --> 00:36:38,718
and I don't feel comfortable
with the company's records

615
00:36:38,752 --> 00:36:40,185
parked on the edge of my desk.

616
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:42,354
Just leave them.

617
00:36:43,824 --> 00:36:46,158
Please tell him to call me
the minute he gets back.

618
00:36:46,192 --> 00:36:48,427
Thank you, Dawn.

619
00:36:55,802 --> 00:36:58,336
- Can I help you?
- Is Sally here?

620
00:36:58,370 --> 00:37:00,505
She's not.
Who are you?

621
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:03,374
I'm Glen.
I... I left my bag here.

622
00:37:03,409 --> 00:37:06,577
- Do you know where she is?
- No. I just asked you.

623
00:37:06,611 --> 00:37:09,480
- What is going on what are you doing here?
- I don't know, okay?

624
00:37:09,514 --> 00:37:11,515
We went to the museum
and she said she wasn't

625
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:13,216
feeling well, and then
she just took off.

626
00:37:13,251 --> 00:37:16,053
I looked for her and finally just
thought maybe she came back here.

627
00:37:16,087 --> 00:37:17,688
I just need my bag, okay?

628
00:37:17,722 --> 00:37:19,456
Calm down.

629
00:37:24,929 --> 00:37:27,897
- When was this?
- I don't know.

630
00:37:27,932 --> 00:37:30,166
I was at the museum
for a long time.

631
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,201
I... I really looked
for her.

632
00:37:32,235 --> 00:37:35,037
I didn't do anything.
I just want my bag.

633
00:37:35,072 --> 00:37:37,038
I would have left it,
but I've got a book

634
00:37:37,073 --> 00:37:39,240
on Nat Turner in there
and my paper's due tomorrow.

635
00:37:39,275 --> 00:37:42,711
Don't move.

636
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:46,815
- Hello?
- Yes, Megan.

637
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:49,384
I was just calling to say
if you or Don were wondering

638
00:37:49,418 --> 00:37:51,052
where Sally is,
she found her way home.

639
00:37:51,087 --> 00:37:53,153
Thank God.

640
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:55,389
I just found out
or I would have called.

641
00:37:57,258 --> 00:37:58,526
What happened?

642
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,595
Well...

643
00:38:00,629 --> 00:38:02,597
She became a woman today.

644
00:38:02,631 --> 00:38:04,098
She started.

645
00:38:04,132 --> 00:38:06,266
Oh.

646
00:38:06,301 --> 00:38:10,904
I think she just
needed her mother.

647
00:38:10,938 --> 00:38:14,307
No, of course.

648
00:38:14,341 --> 00:38:16,109
Well, let her know
that I'm glad she's okay.

649
00:38:16,143 --> 00:38:18,478
I will.

650
00:38:20,347 --> 00:38:22,448
What happened?

651
00:38:22,483 --> 00:38:24,316
She wasn't feeling well.

652
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:26,552
- Was that Betty?
- Yes.

653
00:38:31,157 --> 00:38:32,457
Where are you going?

654
00:38:32,492 --> 00:38:34,693
To grand central to get
the train back to school.

655
00:38:34,728 --> 00:38:36,603
I've already lost
one kid today.

656
00:38:36,723 --> 00:38:37,890
I'll put you on the train.

657
00:38:38,798 --> 00:38:41,232
Well, it doesn't
leave until 7:00.

658
00:38:43,368 --> 00:38:48,205
Look, just wait here,
finish your paper.

659
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,441
I'll take you later.

660
00:38:53,345 --> 00:38:54,611
Do you want something to eat?

661
00:38:54,646 --> 00:38:56,647
If you don't mind.

662
00:39:11,955 --> 00:39:13,923
Oh.

663
00:39:22,264 --> 00:39:23,998
What's going on?

664
00:39:24,033 --> 00:39:25,567
I think something's
terribly wrong

665
00:39:25,601 --> 00:39:27,135
in Mr. Pryce's office.

666
00:39:27,169 --> 00:39:28,637
I can't get the door open.

667
00:39:38,613 --> 00:39:40,448
Dear lord.

668
00:39:53,828 --> 00:39:55,328
Jesus.

669
00:39:58,065 --> 00:40:00,032
Here.

670
00:40:01,301 --> 00:40:02,968
Are you feeling better?

671
00:40:03,002 --> 00:40:06,037
- I'm so embarrassed.
- Don't be.

672
00:40:06,072 --> 00:40:09,341
And if you ever get in trouble like
that again, just ask another woman.

673
00:40:09,376 --> 00:40:13,812
- They'll understand.
- Oh, gosh, I don't wanna talk about it.

674
00:40:13,847 --> 00:40:15,514
Move over.
I wanna lie down.

675
00:40:22,654 --> 00:40:25,690
There's a lot
of responsibilities,

676
00:40:25,724 --> 00:40:28,158
but that's what being
a woman is.

677
00:40:28,193 --> 00:40:30,361
And when it happens every month,

678
00:40:30,396 --> 00:40:32,263
even though it's unpleasant,

679
00:40:32,297 --> 00:40:34,398
it means everything's working.

680
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:38,101
It means everything's
ready for a baby

681
00:40:38,135 --> 00:40:40,270
when you want one.

682
00:40:40,304 --> 00:40:43,039
And maybe you'll have
a beautiful girl

683
00:40:43,073 --> 00:40:45,308
and you can tell her all this.

684
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,788
Well, I'll tell you
one thing...

685
00:40:58,822 --> 00:41:00,289
if they haven't
called the agency,

686
00:41:00,323 --> 00:41:01,757
they probably called
the men in white coats.

687
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:03,392
<i>Hello?</i>

688
00:41:14,303 --> 00:41:16,070
I think you should sit down.

689
00:41:16,104 --> 00:41:17,639
What's going on?

690
00:41:17,673 --> 00:41:20,742
Lane hanged himself
in his office.

691
00:41:20,776 --> 00:41:22,410
What?

692
00:41:30,452 --> 00:41:32,686
Cooper sent everybody home.

693
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,322
Told them there was
a building emergency.

694
00:41:34,356 --> 00:41:35,689
Nobody knows.

695
00:41:37,559 --> 00:41:39,759
What the hell happened?

696
00:41:39,793 --> 00:41:41,627
Who knows?

697
00:41:41,662 --> 00:41:44,998
Come on, I'm taking you home.

698
00:41:45,032 --> 00:41:48,001
- No, I wanna wait.
- For what?

699
00:41:48,035 --> 00:41:50,937
We're waiting for the coroner to
cut him down and take him away.

700
00:41:52,406 --> 00:41:55,007
What, he's still in there?

701
00:41:55,041 --> 00:41:57,709
You can't leave him like that.

702
00:42:04,284 --> 00:42:06,085
They said not
to disturb the body.

703
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:07,987
- It's a crime scene.
- Come on.

704
00:42:08,021 --> 00:42:10,022
You can't leave him like that.

705
00:42:26,305 --> 00:42:28,305
Get something to cut him down.

706
00:42:36,647 --> 00:42:38,615
Here, cut.

707
00:42:42,987 --> 00:42:44,420
Jesus.

708
00:43:07,243 --> 00:43:09,177
Come on.

709
00:43:18,586 --> 00:43:20,387
Let's go.

710
00:43:29,364 --> 00:43:33,166
"To my fellow partners."

711
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,134
Open it.

712
00:43:44,611 --> 00:43:46,245
It's a resignation letter.

713
00:43:48,548 --> 00:43:50,882
It's boilerplate.

714
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:15,606
What are you doing home?

715
00:44:18,710 --> 00:44:20,577
Um, hello, Mr. Draper.

716
00:44:20,612 --> 00:44:22,245
Who are you?

717
00:44:22,279 --> 00:44:24,380
This is Glen.
He's Sally's friend.

718
00:44:24,415 --> 00:44:26,389
He's waiting for his train.

719
00:44:26,509 --> 00:44:27,468
Where's Sally?

720
00:44:27,703 --> 00:44:30,098
She went home. I'll explain later.

721
00:44:31,387 --> 00:44:33,422
I don't understand.
I gotta lie down.

722
00:44:33,456 --> 00:44:35,591
We've met before.

723
00:44:35,626 --> 00:44:37,493
I used to live down the
street in Ossining.

724
00:44:37,527 --> 00:44:39,095
You know my mother,
Helen Bishop?

725
00:44:39,129 --> 00:44:42,531
Oh, right.

726
00:44:42,565 --> 00:44:44,032
I should just go.

727
00:44:44,066 --> 00:44:46,001
And sit in grand central
until 7:00?

728
00:44:46,035 --> 00:44:48,569
- I'll be fine.
- Where are you headed?

729
00:44:48,604 --> 00:44:50,238
I go to Hotchkiss.

730
00:44:50,272 --> 00:44:52,040
It's up in Lakeville.
It's a couple of hours away.

731
00:44:52,074 --> 00:44:54,709
That's fine.
Let's go.

732
00:44:54,744 --> 00:44:57,712
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

733
00:45:00,581 --> 00:45:01,949
Are you okay?

734
00:45:01,983 --> 00:45:04,584
I had a bad day.
We can talk about it later.

735
00:45:06,187 --> 00:45:08,455
Thank you very much
for your hospitality, Megan.

736
00:45:08,489 --> 00:45:10,557
It was very nice to meet you.

737
00:45:24,505 --> 00:45:27,240
Why does everything
turn out crappy?

738
00:45:27,275 --> 00:45:28,975
What do you mean?

739
00:45:31,011 --> 00:45:33,045
I don't know.

740
00:45:33,079 --> 00:45:35,614
Everything you wanna do,

741
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:38,384
everything you think's
gonna make you happy

742
00:45:38,418 --> 00:45:40,052
just turns to crap.

743
00:45:40,086 --> 00:45:42,555
You're too young
to talk that way.

744
00:45:42,589 --> 00:45:44,490
But it's true.

745
00:45:51,930 --> 00:45:53,431
What do you wanna do?

746
00:45:55,352 --> 00:45:57,699
If you could do anything.

747
00:45:57,819 --> 00:45:59,251
