1
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:23,241
Kids, it's time to go!

2
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:25,146
Coming, Carla.

3
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:37,453
And I said I liked her name.

4
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:40,192
Cocoa's a nice name. Isn't it?

5
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,790
Yes, it is.

6
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:44,970
Come on, Bobby. Let's go.

7
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,602
All right. Let's go.

8
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:58,876
Good morning.

9
00:01:58,985 --> 00:01:59,883
Good morning.

10
00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:01,851
- Peggy.
- Good morning, Don.

11
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,252
Good morning, Mr. Draper.

12
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:04,345
Hollis.

13
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:10,027
You hear about Marilyn? Poor thing.

14
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:12,694
It's very upsetting.

15
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,232
I can't say I'm surprised.

16
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:16,894
The few things I know about her.

17
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:19,164
You just don't imagine
her ever being alone.

18
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:20,569
She was so famous.

19
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:23,164
Some people just hide in plain sight.

20
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:28,744
My mother and sister keep calling.

21
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:31,646
Suicide is disturbing.

22
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:34,151
I keep thinking about Joe DiMaggio.

23
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:43,321
We're lucky Playtex didn't go for that
Jackie/Marilyn campaign.

24
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:45,454
We'd have to pull
everything indefinitely.

25
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:46,998
Yes, that's true.

26
00:02:56,276 --> 00:03:00,042
I've never taken pills,
even when I had a headache.

27
00:03:07,086 --> 00:03:08,280
Mr. Draper, good morning.

28
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:09,514
Would you like coffee?

29
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:10,748
I already had some.

30
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,519
They're waiting for you
in the conference room.

31
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:14,786
Do you need to go home?

32
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:17,328
No. Of course not.

33
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:25,429
I have Warren, and I have Todd.

34
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,768
Todd is a mail boy.
Why do you have him?

35
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,068
I'm paying him.

36
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:30,199
I'm sorry.

37
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,607
I don't understand
this stupid blood drive.

38
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,201
You just hate that Media
wins every year.

39
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:35,577
Wins what? How do you
win a blood drive? What do you win?

40
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:38,651
I don't know.
You're the best or something.

41
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:40,878
I'll be lucky if Accounts
can get eight people.

42
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:42,420
Well, Campbell's afraid of needles,

43
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:43,819
Duck doesn't give two craps.

44
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:45,754
Good morning.

45
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:46,984
Good morning, fellas.

46
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:48,560
Is this program already in progress?

47
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:51,095
We're expecting
our most successful blood drive ever.

48
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:53,392
Yes. Tell me everything.

49
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:55,091
I think we're very organized.

50
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:56,725
Creative, our department,

51
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:59,634
will be at 75 to 80% participation.

52
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,570
Of course, I'm assuming you are in.

53
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:02,800
I am.

54
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:06,208
Do Kurt and Smitty
count as one person?

55
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:08,075
Why don't you bore me
with the details?

56
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:10,274
We're going to take the lockers
out of the break room,

57
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:11,873
put them in the hallway
in the morning.

58
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:13,282
There will be two litters, three nurses,

59
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:14,785
at least one old lady
serving refreshments,

60
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:15,979
and plenty of chairs.

61
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,683
Kinsey, I want you to pull
every intern and lackey...

62
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,656
switchboard, elevator men.

63
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,660
Find out who wants to be
a copywriter for the day.

64
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:23,751
Dollar a head.

65
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:24,852
That's not fair.

66
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:25,862
You're in Accounts.

67
00:04:25,965 --> 00:04:28,263
You should have thought of it.

68
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:29,699
Just to be clear,

69
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:33,670
do I get the dollar
for each person I get,

70
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,297
or do they get it for giving blood?

71
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:36,773
The people giving blood.

72
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:38,935
This is for mankind, Kinsey.

73
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:41,707
That's the money they'd make
actually being in the art department.

74
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:43,213
So what is the prize?

75
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:44,977
Helping another human being.

76
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:46,984
Also, there will be women fainting.

77
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:48,576
I'd think you'd like that.

78
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,681
If this was a flat-out
athletic competition,

79
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:52,815
Accounts would win,

80
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:53,892
without a doubt.

81
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:55,392
What an elegant surrender.

82
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:56,860
And put up more posters.

83
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,658
I can't believe
I have to say that to you people.

84
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:00,494
Apparently, if we get
100% participation,

85
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,158
which Media will do its best to aid,

86
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:03,792
they're going to put us in the Times.

87
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:05,234
I booked a photographer, just in case.

88
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:06,737
Good.

89
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,898
NBC's having the Mitch Miller
concert on Thursday.

90
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:11,169
Any chance I could show
you and Mrs. Draper off?

91
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:13,609
We'd love to, but...

92
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:15,203
my kid is sick.

93
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,112
You'll know what that means
soon enough.

94
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:20,545
Shot down.

95
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:16,071
That was quick.

96
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,873
What do we have today?

97
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:23,142
The 10:00 with Miss Holloway
to go over traffic for new business,

98
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:25,843
4:00 with Ron Venincasa
from Ace Hardware,

99
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:29,115
and Mr. Sterling moved the meeting
with Boston Edison to 5:00.

100
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,588
I assume to have it bleed
into the cocktail hour.

101
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:34,860
May I?

102
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:46,263
There was a bit
of confusion last night.

103
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:48,397
I think I made a terrible mistake.

104
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:50,339
What happened?

105
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:51,967
Your daughter called and asked

106
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,807
when you would be back
from your business trip

107
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:56,211
because her mother wasn't sure.

108
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,278
You don't have to tell me anything,

109
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:04,083
but I didn't know what to say.

110
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:07,921
I said Wednesday.
I know I should have said I don't know.

111
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:11,292
Mrs. Draper is
working out some things.

112
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:13,058
I understand.

113
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,827
I'm sure it won't come up again.

114
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:17,095
I thought it would be over by now.

115
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:19,137
Yes, and there'd be no need to...

116
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:22,301
I'm sorry about that.

117
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:26,105
It goes without saying
that this is personal,

118
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:28,180
and I'd appreciate your
keeping it that way.

119
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,873
Of course.

120
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:33,145
I'd also avoid giving
me concerned looks.

121
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:36,448
Mr. Draper, I hope you've noticed
I'm a discreet person.

122
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:37,682
I don't know you at all,

123
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:38,916
and this is personal,

124
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:40,583
and it's not up for discussion.

125
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:44,688
Of course.

126
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:46,958
If you need anything,
I'm right out there.

127
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:54,238
I'm at the Roosevelt
if there's an emergency.

128
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:17,521
In an interview just weeks
before her death,

129
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,962
Miss Monroe angrily
protested to a reporter

130
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:21,897
about attacks on stars.

131
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,663
"We're what's okay with
the movie business, " she said.

132
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,761
Management is what's
wrong with the business."

133
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:52,187
Mr. Campbell, Miss Olson,
and Mr. Romano are here.

134
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:53,697
Send them in.

135
00:08:58,337 --> 00:08:59,599
My oldest just turned 30,

136
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,366
and she's had a string of bad beaux.

137
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:03,408
It's very upsetting.

138
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:04,942
Can I get you kids anything?

139
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,602
- I'm fine.
- I'll have something.

140
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,577
They're probably walking over.

141
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:10,046
Dress rehearsal, Freddie.

142
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:12,875
I'll do introductions.

143
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:14,543
Jeff Hartung's wife just had a baby.

144
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:16,383
Boy or girl?

145
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:18,218
That's good.

146
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:19,882
Then I talk about Volkswagen.

147
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:21,983
No. Don said we only
bring up Volkswagen

148
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:23,584
if they don't like what we've presented.

149
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:25,163
Okay. Then I throw it to you, Freddie.

150
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:26,595
Thank you, Freddie.

151
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:32,931
"I just got a brand-new
Samsonite Silhouette,

152
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,131
"and I hate it.

153
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,332
"Don't get me wrong.

154
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:37,306
"I love the shape,
the size, the color,

155
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,140
"and I love the Silhouette
because it's a Samsonite,

156
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,714
so I know we're going to go
lots of places together,"

157
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:44,407
see lots of things,

158
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:46,644
collect a lifetime of memories.

159
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,744
I hate my Silhouette
because it's empty.

160
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:50,947
Then Sal.

161
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:55,293
Shouldn't the artwork come first?

162
00:09:55,394 --> 00:09:57,328
What about unveiling it?

163
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,022
You know how excited they get.

164
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:03,669
Freddie?

165
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:08,533
Freddie.

166
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:10,302
What the hell, Freddie?

167
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:11,774
What...

168
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:13,469
What were we talking about?

169
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:15,206
Two types of travelers.

170
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,945
Freddie, do you
have another pair of trousers here?

171
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,012
Why?

172
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,646
Oh, Jesus.

173
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:28,617
Ah, Jesus.

174
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:33,030
L... I'll fix this. L...

175
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:37,125
I need a... I need a minute.

176
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:39,330
I got to think.

177
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,369
Freddie?

178
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:55,683
Is he dead?

179
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:58,450
No, he's not dead. He passed out.

180
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,224
He's fine.

181
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:04,022
The Hartungs are at reception.

182
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:08,398
We'll be right there. Thanks, Abigail.

183
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:11,596
He can't leave this room.

184
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:14,571
They're all from Colorado.

185
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,438
I guess I could push it until tomorrow,

186
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:20,376
book them another night at the Carlyle.

187
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:21,776
Should I just cancel it?

188
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:23,280
I should talk to Don.

189
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:24,542
That's not necessary.
I can handle this.

190
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:25,742
Fine.

191
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:28,081
Jesus. It's a suitcase.

192
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,382
Peggy, you can do it, right?

193
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:32,081
You think it's going
to be better tomorrow?

194
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,624
Shit.

195
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:35,353
It'll be fine.

196
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:38,294
We'll tell them Freddie's sick.
It's true.

197
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:39,887
I'll go to reception.

198
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:42,126
You two go to the conference room
and act like you've been waiting.

199
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:43,394
But don't look mad.

200
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:45,163
Someone tell Freddie's
girl it's cancelled.

201
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:46,795
I don't want him wandering in.

202
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:50,807
It's disgusting.

203
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,810
There's no need for that.

204
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:11,125
Can I speak to you for a minute?

205
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:25,503
Carla?

206
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:54,763
I forgot you were coming by.

207
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:56,273
Are you okay?

208
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:00,502
I haven't been feeling well.

209
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,205
Oh, no, Betty.

210
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:04,282
You and Don are still
coming tonight, I hope.

211
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,782
We'd love to.

212
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:07,716
I just don't think I'll be up to it.

213
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,414
That ruins things.

214
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:12,957
Well, you wanted to borrow
the black chiffon, right?

215
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:14,025
Come upstairs.

216
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,286
Are you sure?

217
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:16,918
I don't know who I'm going to talk to.

218
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:18,155
Raymond has to work
these things.

219
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:25,570
And I got you out of bed?
I am so sorry.

220
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:27,434
Give me the black one, and I'll go.

221
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,201
Nonsense.

222
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:36,513
I think my waist is higher than yours.

223
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:39,379
What do you have that's generous?

224
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:40,850
I don't know.

225
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:44,583
How about this?

226
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:47,124
You'll look like sherbet.
Long white gloves.

227
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:49,592
I can't wear those after Gypsy.

228
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:52,687
Think you'll be better
by lunch on Thursday?

229
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,695
I'm looking forward to it.

230
00:13:58,137 --> 00:14:00,037
This is youthful.

231
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:05,239
It doesn't matter. I'm invisible.

232
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:08,841
That's not true.

233
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:09,846
Raymond's sweet about it,

234
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:13,009
but he's so easy to please.

235
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,878
That's sweet.

236
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:17,717
It is.

237
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:22,351
I think, What did I do to deserve him?

238
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:24,486
Then I spend his money
on Dr. Weinberg.

239
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:26,690
I got my diagnosis the other day.

240
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:28,061
I'm bored.

241
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:30,829
That's too bad.

242
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,527
I saw Arthur have a fight with Tara,

243
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:37,200
and I have been having
ridiculous dreams since.

244
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:38,936
I wish you'd come ride with us again.

245
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,409
It really takes the pressure off.

246
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:43,406
Think you can carry this?

247
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:46,011
No, ma'am.

248
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:49,744
You shouldn't talk to him so much.

249
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,880
I know. It's embarrassing.

250
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:58,054
It's a switch you can
flip on and off, you know.

251
00:14:58,163 --> 00:14:59,562
Really?

252
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,261
You don't even think about this, do you?

253
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,204
Don's perfect.

254
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:13,972
Can we talk at lunch?

255
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,910
I'm really not feeling well.

256
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:18,141
Take them all.

257
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,741
Oh, no. Just these two.

258
00:15:58,924 --> 00:16:00,551
That's it for today.

259
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:27,377
Many's the time I've dreamed
of finding you like this.

260
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,317
What are you doing here?

261
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:31,048
You're right.

262
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:32,214
I'll just get all my belongings,

263
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,416
- and I'll leave.
- It's 4:30.

264
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:35,049
You're supposed to be
sitting in a bar somewhere

265
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,650
waiting for Boston Edison.

266
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:38,457
How often do you come in here?

267
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:41,456
Not that often.

268
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:48,699
What's wrong, Red?

269
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:49,967
Do you miss me?

270
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:55,010
She was so young.

271
00:16:56,715 --> 00:16:57,739
Not you, too.

272
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:01,286
Yes, I'm just another
frivolous secretary.

273
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:02,752
It's a terrible tragedy,

274
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,551
but that woman's a stranger.

275
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:07,318
Roosevelt...

276
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:09,291
I hated him, but I felt like I knew him.

277
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:11,625
A lot of people felt
like they knew her.

278
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:13,288
You should be sensitive to that.

279
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:16,493
Hey. You're not like her.

280
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:20,967
Physically, a little,

281
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:22,836
but don't tell me that makes you sad.

282
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:24,340
It's not a joke.

283
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:26,411
This world destroyed her.

284
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:29,572
Really? She was a movie star
who had everything

285
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:30,978
and everybody,

286
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,744
and she threw it away.

287
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:38,584
But, hey, if you want to be sad.

288
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:42,717
One day you'll lose someone
who's important to you.

289
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:44,489
You'll see.

290
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:46,587
It's very painful.

291
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:05,644
Are you feeling better, Mommy?

292
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,652
Yes. I'll join you next time.

293
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:13,057
I'm surprised Daddy let you in the car.

294
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:16,893
You kids should go to bed.

295
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:18,553
Wash your face and brush your teeth.

296
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:19,961
I'll tuck you in.

297
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:23,392
Good night.

298
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:27,430
You just came back.

299
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:30,937
Now you're leaving again?

300
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:33,944
Lt'll go by like that.

301
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:36,171
Come here.

302
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,951
It won't be that long, Salamander.

303
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:50,252
Go.

304
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:59,297
Listen, she called my office.

305
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:02,965
She did? When?

306
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:05,168
Monday.

307
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:06,904
What do you want me to say?

308
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:09,446
I think she expected you
over the weekend.

309
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,575
You said you didn't want me here,
and then you do.

310
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:15,050
I didn't want them involved in this.

311
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,349
Obviously, that's impossible.

312
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:20,088
What do you want to do?

313
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:23,628
I mean, how long
is this going to go on?

314
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:25,060
We have to tell them something.

315
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,222
Like what?

316
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,302
Okay. How about...

317
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:32,563
I'm working on an account.

318
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,002
They're putting me up
in Philadelphia,

319
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:35,698
but I'll be home every weekend.

320
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,707
Jesus. Did you just think that up?

321
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:39,572
Or I could just come home.

322
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:46,517
Bets, what do you want?

323
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:51,947
Listen, if your mind's made up,

324
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:53,524
I'm not going to talk you into it.

325
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:56,059
I thought you can talk
anyone into anything.

326
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,128
Good night.

327
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:20,209
Would you like coffee?

328
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:21,650
And a bear claw.

329
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:28,687
What's this?

330
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:32,025
I thought you could
use a few more shirts in your rotation.

331
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:38,669
Thank you. Submit your receipt.

332
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:41,705
Your correspondence
is on your desk.

333
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:44,298
Let me get your breakfast.
I'll be right back.

334
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:47,242
And Mr. Kinsey said
that I have to drag you,

335
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:48,904
if necessary, to the blood drive.

336
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,717
You're not a fainter, are you?

337
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:56,814
I don't faint, but I might cry after.

338
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:13,502
Peggy.

339
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:14,503
Hello, Freddie.

340
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:15,698
How'd it go yesterday?

341
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:17,638
I left word with Abigail.
They loved it.

342
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:19,267
Good. Good.

343
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:22,313
I was thinking about
letting you talk anyway.

344
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:25,277
L...

345
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:28,376
I have to apologize
for putting you in that spot.

346
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:29,954
Freddie, it's over.

347
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:31,647
There's no reason to talk about it.

348
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:33,952
Of course.

349
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:35,856
Did they ask about me?

350
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,292
We told them you were sick.

351
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:38,488
That's good.

352
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:42,333
So on Monday, when they
get back to Colorado,

353
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:44,493
I'll give them a call and sew things up.

354
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:46,036
That's a great idea.

355
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:14,255
Bobby...

356
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:17,199
Mrs. Draper. I'm sorry to bother you.

357
00:22:17,302 --> 00:22:19,862
It's okay, Carla.

358
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:22,599
It's a beautiful day.

359
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:24,676
I'm going to take
the children out again.

360
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:26,471
Is that good?

361
00:22:26,578 --> 00:22:28,273
Whatever they want.

362
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:32,611
Can I do anything for you?

363
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:34,345
If you want, I can draw a bath.

364
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:36,353
No, thank you.

365
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:45,152
I've been married
almost 20 years, you know.

366
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:48,729
I really don't want to talk about this.

367
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:51,394
I'm sorry.

368
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:52,902
I'm s... I'm sorry.

369
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,532
Carla...

370
00:22:56,641 --> 00:23:00,372
I haven't been seep...
sleeping very well.

371
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:01,537
You know what helps?

372
00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:04,444
Splash cold water
on your face and go outside.

373
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,915
You'll notice things
are right where you left them.

374
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:26,227
I'm usually part of the meeting
before the meeting.

375
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:28,135
Relax, Don. Sit down.

376
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,674
This is all being done in the right way.

377
00:23:34,646 --> 00:23:35,772
Campbell.

378
00:23:38,283 --> 00:23:41,514
Well, Don, I'm afraid
we have some bad news.

379
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:44,589
We were on the launch pad
yesterday for Samsonite,

380
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:46,953
and Freddie Rumsen pissed his pants.

381
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:49,325
What?

382
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:50,759
He's not talking about nerves here.

383
00:23:50,862 --> 00:23:53,228
He's talking about a wet pair of pants.

384
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:56,196
Really?

385
00:23:56,301 --> 00:23:58,201
How'd the presentation go?

386
00:23:58,303 --> 00:24:00,464
Don, it's conduct unbefitting.

387
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:02,062
Of Freddie Rumsen?

388
00:24:02,174 --> 00:24:04,074
We're lucky Campbell here
grabbed the controls.

389
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:06,303
He locked Rumsen up
and threw Peggy Olson in.

390
00:24:06,411 --> 00:24:07,844
We're lucky the bench is deep.

391
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:10,710
We have to cut him loose.

392
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:12,807
Is that necessary?

393
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:14,317
The man is a train wreck.

394
00:24:15,821 --> 00:24:17,550
We at least need to get him
off this account.

395
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:19,385
They called already.
They're thrilled with Peggy.

396
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:21,516
No. I don't want him
on any of my accounts.

397
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:23,116
This could have
happened in a meeting.

398
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:25,093
But it didn't.

399
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:29,891
That'll be all, boys.

400
00:24:30,001 --> 00:24:32,060
Thank you for bringing this
to our attention.

401
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,905
We're not doing him any favors

402
00:24:37,008 --> 00:24:38,805
keeping him around.

403
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:43,071
Duck's a teetotaler.

404
00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:45,206
He's been gunning
for Freddie since day 1.

405
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:46,682
He's got a point.

406
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:48,150
We can't even tall Cooper about this.

407
00:24:48,253 --> 00:24:50,721
You know his whole thing with germs.

408
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:52,289
I don't think it's in my contract

409
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:54,085
that Duck can fire someone
in my department.

410
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:55,489
You don't have a contract,

411
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:58,188
and I can fire anyone I want to.

412
00:24:58,296 --> 00:25:00,491
We really don't have a choice.

413
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:03,295
You can still get him to give blood.

414
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:05,301
The agencies will laugh about this,

415
00:25:05,403 --> 00:25:06,836
but the clients,

416
00:25:06,938 --> 00:25:09,133
they already think we're all like that.

417
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:14,010
We'll say it's a six-month
leave of absence

418
00:25:14,112 --> 00:25:15,545
so he can go for the cure.

419
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:18,548
He'll know what that means.

420
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:20,277
You don't want to throw him away.

421
00:25:22,554 --> 00:25:25,148
Your loyalty is starting
to become a liability.

422
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,083
Let's do this before he finds out.

423
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,285
We don't need any more accidents.

424
00:25:29,394 --> 00:25:30,952
Dinner tonight.

425
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:33,587
You need to call the missus?

426
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:35,029
I'll make it.

427
00:26:13,171 --> 00:26:14,331
Mr. Case.

428
00:26:16,474 --> 00:26:17,463
Betty.

429
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:18,668
How are you?

430
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,105
It's a beautiful day.

431
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:26,809
Have you just ridden,
or are you about to ride?

432
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:28,715
I can never tell whether
you're before or after.

433
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:29,912
I'm on my way out.

434
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:32,182
It's good to see you.

435
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:34,019
How are your children?

436
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:35,319
They're wonderful.

437
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:40,493
Have you seen Sara Beth lately?

438
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:42,123
I think so. Monday, maybe?

439
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:43,359
That's good news.

440
00:26:43,468 --> 00:26:45,129
I'm glad she came.

441
00:26:45,236 --> 00:26:46,897
Why?

442
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:48,802
Nothing.

443
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:50,636
I had noticed she seemed distracted.

444
00:26:50,742 --> 00:26:53,176
I shouldn't have said anything.

445
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,542
Is there anything I can do?

446
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:59,139
No. But she'd be glad
to know you're concerned.

447
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:00,842
I think you make her feel better.

448
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:03,580
She talks about you a lot.

449
00:27:03,688 --> 00:27:05,622
I didn't mean to embarrass you.

450
00:27:06,858 --> 00:27:08,223
You know what?

451
00:27:08,326 --> 00:27:10,851
The three of us should go to lunch
and have some fun.

452
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:12,224
It would cheer her up.

453
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:13,957
It's a great idea.

454
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:15,259
Thursday?

455
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:17,358
Café Soleil in Old Town.

456
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:18,367
1:00.

457
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,732
I'll pick up the check.

458
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:20,896
See you then.

459
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:34,107
That was nothing.

460
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:36,016
I'm thinking of doing it again.

461
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:37,816
You should smoke
a cigarette right now.

462
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:39,321
I know they said not to,

463
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:40,982
but I'm telling you, my knees buckled.

464
00:27:41,092 --> 00:27:44,118
I thought I was going to perform
a full Freddie Rumsen.

465
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:46,026
Ah, Jesus.

466
00:27:47,132 --> 00:27:49,396
Hello, Don. We're in the lead.

467
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:50,866
Turns out Hollis has a novel.

468
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:52,334
Good.

469
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:53,904
Too bad Freddie made
his donation yesterday.

470
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:56,269
He's a real wizz in advertising.

471
00:27:56,374 --> 00:27:58,899
Ah, Jesus.

472
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,409
What are you doing?

473
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:01,945
What do you mean?

474
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:05,281
That's none of your business.

475
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:07,851
Freddie had a bad day.

476
00:28:07,952 --> 00:28:09,544
Can't you find something else to do

477
00:28:09,654 --> 00:28:12,088
besides dining on the drama
of other people's lives

478
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,782
like a bunch of teenage girls?

479
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,295
Sorry, Don. It's funny.

480
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:20,629
Sure.

481
00:28:20,732 --> 00:28:22,927
It's just a man's name, right?

482
00:28:31,342 --> 00:28:33,333
Could you leave us alone for a moment?

483
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:37,278
Truth to tell, I was a little nervous.

484
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:39,441
I'd never given one of those
funny speeches before

485
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,678
where you say
what you don't mean.

486
00:28:41,786 --> 00:28:43,583
Freddie, we've reached a decision.

487
00:28:43,688 --> 00:28:46,452
You're going to take
a six-month leave of absence.

488
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:49,351
Is that necessary?

489
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:51,326
The door will be open.

490
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:53,363
It was a snafu.

491
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:55,592
Isn't the embarrassment enough?

492
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:58,134
Full salary, you dry out, come back,

493
00:28:58,236 --> 00:28:59,430
we'll see where we are.

494
00:29:01,372 --> 00:29:04,034
Clients love me.
I keep up with them.

495
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:05,734
We have laughs.

496
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:08,335
Monday morning, I'll be
good as new, I promise.

497
00:29:08,446 --> 00:29:10,641
There's a line, Freddie,

498
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,376
and you wet it.

499
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:15,212
You see? We're laughing about it.

500
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,049
What's the big deal?

501
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:19,851
You remember Bob Peebles?
How mean he was?

502
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:22,256
He fired his secretary,

503
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,419
and he threw all her things
out the window,

504
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:25,621
including her keys.

505
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:27,322
That was good for morale.

506
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:33,161
What is this about?

507
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:35,603
Duck Phillips?

508
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:37,174
He's as dry as a bone.

509
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:38,833
He doesn't understand
this business.

510
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:41,138
Freddie, my father would
have fired you for this.

511
00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:44,477
Your father drank more
than the two of you put together.

512
00:29:44,582 --> 00:29:47,608
He used to come in
with his shirt on inside-out.

513
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:49,414
He admired you.

514
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:52,217
I, however,
had different feelings at the time.

515
00:29:52,323 --> 00:29:54,052
When we first met,

516
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,184
Bonny Prince Sterling here
thought I was a coward

517
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:57,886
because I was in the Signal Corps.

518
00:29:57,996 --> 00:30:00,760
I didn't know it was only
for his last six months.

519
00:30:00,865 --> 00:30:01,889
I thought he was a typist.

520
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,797
Turns out before that,

521
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:05,563
he was in charge
of killing people...

522
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:07,035
and by people, I mean Germans.

523
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:08,537
It was a long time ago.

524
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,868
Come on. Be proud.

525
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:11,373
What was it? Like 15 of them.

526
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,569
That's impressive.

527
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:19,379
Look, I can be completely in control.

528
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,213
My podiatrist went to Hazleton.

529
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:23,651
Came back a new man
with great stories.

530
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:25,279
Only drinks beer now.

531
00:30:30,795 --> 00:30:32,729
It's the best thing, Freddie.

532
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,934
Well, I guess you get dealt
the hand you get dealt, right?

533
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:44,665
I can pull myself together.

534
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:47,370
I got a great book.

535
00:30:47,478 --> 00:30:52,415
Maybe I'll head to Philly or Boston.

536
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:54,610
They're all dying
to do what we do here.

537
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:56,949
You know I'll recommend you.

538
00:30:57,055 --> 00:30:59,080
Fantastic. So this could be good.

539
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,385
There are a lot of great towns.

540
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:05,185
My father sold greeting cards.

541
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:07,025
He used to come into the kitchen,

542
00:31:07,131 --> 00:31:08,928
unroll this map on the table,

543
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:11,331
and put a finger on a spot
and say something like,

544
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:14,337
"Memphis. Who wants
to live in Memphis?"

545
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:15,804
I'd say, "Not me."

546
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:18,000
We had only been in Springfield
for nine months.

547
00:31:19,944 --> 00:31:22,811
Meanwhile, here we are.

548
00:31:22,914 --> 00:31:24,211
To New York.

549
00:31:24,315 --> 00:31:26,715
Come on. Let's make a night of it.

550
00:31:28,286 --> 00:31:29,218
Really?

551
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,753
Absolutely.

552
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:34,985
To Monday morning.

553
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:37,220
It'll be here faster than you think.

554
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:40,422
Hold off on the menus.

555
00:31:40,531 --> 00:31:42,192
We're going to take another lap first.

556
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,790
Bring some bread.

557
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:51,233
Give me 5 bucks.

558
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:52,900
No. Sorry. Don.

559
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,815
Can I help you gentlemen?

560
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,509
Swordfish.

561
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:03,348
And who are you here to see?

562
00:32:03,454 --> 00:32:05,012
You can't do that now.

563
00:32:05,123 --> 00:32:06,590
I just gave you the money.

564
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:08,818
Come on. Do we look like cops?

565
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,588
Sir?

566
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,322
I have a very good friend...

567
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:16,059
I can't remember the guy's name.

568
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:18,328
How about if I give you our names?

569
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:19,528
I'm Dick Dollars,

570
00:32:19,637 --> 00:32:21,298
this is Mike Moneybags,

571
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:22,839
and this...

572
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,431
Tilden Katz.

573
00:32:28,513 --> 00:32:29,980
Ah, fine.

574
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:31,673
Here.

575
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:32,875
That's a 20.

576
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:36,776
Gentlemen.

577
00:32:54,772 --> 00:32:56,399
Is it Milwaukee?

578
00:32:56,507 --> 00:32:57,405
Yes, it is.

579
00:32:57,508 --> 00:32:58,873
Son of a bitch.

580
00:33:17,228 --> 00:33:18,855
The Chuck-a-luck.

581
00:33:26,904 --> 00:33:29,338
Going to need some cocktails.

582
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:33,710
Hey, isn't that
the champ back there?

583
00:33:33,811 --> 00:33:36,336
For another couple of months.

584
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:37,436
You're crazy.

585
00:33:37,548 --> 00:33:39,516
Nobody's going to beat him.

586
00:33:41,986 --> 00:33:43,078
Hey, loosen up.

587
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:44,882
Everything's going to be okay.

588
00:33:46,991 --> 00:33:48,481
Just in time.

589
00:33:48,593 --> 00:33:52,324
Canadian Club neat,
Wolfschmidt gibson,

590
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:54,022
Granddad rocks.

591
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,859
Pete Campbell, huh?

592
00:33:57,969 --> 00:34:00,403
I would have never thought
I was in his way.

593
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:06,910
You know, you bet badly.

594
00:34:07,011 --> 00:34:08,171
Obviously.

595
00:34:08,279 --> 00:34:09,644
No. I mean you win a few times,

596
00:34:09,747 --> 00:34:11,214
you got to start
really putting it out there.

597
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:12,577
You kept betting the same thing.

598
00:34:12,683 --> 00:34:14,275
You're so good at this,
why don't you quit your job?

599
00:34:18,156 --> 00:34:20,852
See? He's having a great time.

600
00:34:24,796 --> 00:34:25,820
Hello, there.

601
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:28,660
Are we winners or losers?

602
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:33,193
Losers tonight,
but winners in general.

603
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:36,635
You know, BBDO hired a colored kid.

604
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,675
What do you think of that?

605
00:34:38,776 --> 00:34:40,607
I think I'm glad I'm not that kid.

606
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:48,244
I'm sorry. Can we get you
a drink or something?

607
00:34:48,352 --> 00:34:49,478
No.

608
00:34:55,193 --> 00:34:57,184
I'm sorry. Were you interested?

609
00:34:57,295 --> 00:34:59,024
No, I'm fine. Thank you.

610
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:00,461
I know what's going on.

611
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:03,398
You come in too early.

612
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:05,128
You got dry cleaning moving in and out.

613
00:35:05,236 --> 00:35:08,069
I can't remember the last time it was
you went out spur of the moment.

614
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:10,538
Send off Freddie,
I had to send off Freddie.

615
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:11,801
Come on.

616
00:35:11,909 --> 00:35:14,707
I've been in your particular situation.

617
00:35:14,812 --> 00:35:16,939
I heard you chaired the blood drive.

618
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:18,208
Where are you, the Stanhope?

619
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:19,305
The Biltmore?

620
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:20,315
Roger.

621
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:22,113
Did she kick you out? You leave?

622
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,312
There's nothing to talk about.

623
00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:24,581
Look, people make mistakes.

624
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:26,782
You feel bad about it.
You think things over,

625
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:30,327
and in the end you do
the grand gesture for her.

626
00:35:30,428 --> 00:35:32,521
It'll be easy for you. You're creative.

627
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,995
Roger, will you stop?

628
00:35:34,098 --> 00:35:36,157
All I'm going to say is
do you want to be right,

629
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:37,461
or do you want to be married?

630
00:35:37,568 --> 00:35:40,036
I know marriage isn't a natural state,
but you do it.

631
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,036
Why?

632
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,868
I don't know.

633
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:46,173
Kids.

634
00:35:46,277 --> 00:35:47,244
Again!

635
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:51,272
And don't fool yourself.
There are other things.

636
00:35:51,382 --> 00:35:53,213
Think about when you met her.

637
00:35:56,254 --> 00:35:57,881
Okay. I'm sorry.

638
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,923
You're so secretive.

639
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:01,949
Hey, Don.

640
00:36:03,394 --> 00:36:05,225
Look who's here.

641
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:07,320
If it isn't the man
in the gray flannel suit.

642
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:15,104
What the hell was that for?

643
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:19,100
We're going to go.

644
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:20,234
Don't worry about it.

645
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:23,404
I'm sure it's not the first time
he's been punched in the face.

646
00:36:26,984 --> 00:36:27,973
Hey, Floyd.

647
00:36:29,787 --> 00:36:30,981
How'd I do?

648
00:36:37,495 --> 00:36:40,191
I'm sure there are 20 people
who want to thank you for that.

649
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:42,198
It wasn't exactly a fair match-up.

650
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,768
I think that's going to do it for me.

651
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,530
Yeah. Me, too.

652
00:36:46,637 --> 00:36:49,037
It's getting late.

653
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,233
- This was a nice evening.
- Hold on.

654
00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:53,742
Don and I are going to the East Side.
You take it.

655
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,070
Absolutely.

656
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:06,453
I'd like to stay and get
all sentimental with you,

657
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:10,425
but I got to go and give
a Chinaman a music lesson.

658
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:13,622
Want to watch how I do it,
unzipping the fly and everything?

659
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:15,323
Yeah. Go to hell.

660
00:37:15,433 --> 00:37:17,298
Take him to McCann.

661
00:37:23,808 --> 00:37:24,832
This was fun.

662
00:37:24,942 --> 00:37:25,966
Good.

663
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:28,705
I'm going to miss you.

664
00:37:28,813 --> 00:37:29,939
You're talented.

665
00:37:32,183 --> 00:37:33,980
I don't know.

666
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:36,076
Thank you, Freddie.

667
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:37,984
It means a lot.

668
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,956
What am I going to do?

669
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:42,719
What am I going to tell Violet?

670
00:37:44,795 --> 00:37:45,955
I don't know.

671
00:37:46,063 --> 00:37:48,463
It sounded like you had a plan.

672
00:37:48,566 --> 00:37:51,364
I'm not kidding, Don.

673
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:53,061
What am I going to do?

674
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:56,406
It's not an ending.

675
00:37:56,507 --> 00:37:57,667
It's a fresh start.

676
00:38:01,145 --> 00:38:03,807
If I don't go into that office every day,

677
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:05,381
who am I?

678
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:13,315
Where do you live, Freddie?

679
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:15,892
152 Riverside Drive.

680
00:38:15,993 --> 00:38:18,461
Apartment 604.

681
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:23,498
No matter what he says, take him there.

682
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:30,741
Good night, Freddie.

683
00:38:32,376 --> 00:38:34,037
Good-bye, Don.

684
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:53,225
See, I find if I stick
with the clear liquors...

685
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:57,062
vodka, gin... I know where I stand.

686
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,726
I'm the opposite.

687
00:39:00,705 --> 00:39:02,639
So what do you think,
because you gave blood,

688
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:04,367
the whiskey made you a little angry?

689
00:39:05,976 --> 00:39:08,274
That was a real
Archibald Whitman maneuver.

690
00:39:08,379 --> 00:39:09,437
Who's that?

691
00:39:09,547 --> 00:39:11,481
This hothead drunk I used to know.

692
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:14,312
Jimmy Barrett's a weasel. Enjoy.

693
00:39:20,624 --> 00:39:22,114
So what's going on with you?

694
00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:27,792
I'm at the Roosevelt.

695
00:39:27,898 --> 00:39:30,366
See? That wasn't so hard.

696
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:32,368
I really don't want
to discuss it, Roger.

697
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:33,801
Why, because you feel so bad?

698
00:39:33,904 --> 00:39:35,064
I've been there.

699
00:39:37,475 --> 00:39:40,103
No, I don't feel bad at all.

700
00:39:42,747 --> 00:39:44,578
I mean, sometimes...

701
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:49,376
Mostly, I'm just relived.

702
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:50,545
Really?

703
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:54,622
Do you fall in love?

704
00:39:58,629 --> 00:40:00,859
That would be easier.

705
00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:02,455
Then I'd know what to do.

706
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:04,363
Easier...

707
00:40:04,468 --> 00:40:06,868
There's some incredible woman,

708
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:08,495
and someone's going
to end up with her,

709
00:40:08,606 --> 00:40:10,039
but it can't be you.

710
00:40:10,141 --> 00:40:11,301
Why not?

711
00:40:13,978 --> 00:40:15,502
Because we're married.

712
00:40:24,021 --> 00:40:25,249
I don't know.

713
00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:28,951
It's your life.

714
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:31,118
You don't know how long
it's going to be,

715
00:40:31,228 --> 00:40:33,423
but you know it's got a bad ending.

716
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:35,931
You have to move forward.

717
00:40:37,835 --> 00:40:39,700
As soon as you figure out
what that is.

718
00:40:41,005 --> 00:40:42,438
Two coronaries.

719
00:40:52,716 --> 00:40:54,308
Got to move forward.

720
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,247
It's your life.

721
00:41:01,058 --> 00:41:03,049
I mean, this can't be it, right?

722
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:08,191
We're in it together, huh?

723
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:19,701
That's true.

724
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:27,313
You wanted to see me?

725
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:29,215
Close the door.

726
00:41:40,764 --> 00:41:43,062
That was quite
a presentation you gave.

727
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:45,692
The Samsonite people are thrilled.

728
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:47,771
That's good to hear.

729
00:41:47,872 --> 00:41:49,897
They've requested
that you be reassigned

730
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:52,532
as the copywriter on their account.

731
00:41:52,643 --> 00:41:55,373
What about Freddie?

732
00:41:55,479 --> 00:41:57,777
Freddie's decided
to take a few months off.

733
00:41:57,882 --> 00:42:00,282
He did? When's he coming back?

734
00:42:00,384 --> 00:42:02,147
It doesn't matter.

735
00:42:02,253 --> 00:42:04,813
You'll be taking over all of his business.

736
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:09,553
Are you sure?

737
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:11,093
You know, I really don't like

738
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:14,221
walking into an ambush
from Duck and Pete Campbell.

739
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:17,095
I don't know why anyone
had to know about that.

740
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:18,133
Even me?

741
00:42:18,235 --> 00:42:20,396
No, of course you,

742
00:42:20,504 --> 00:42:22,062
but...

743
00:42:22,172 --> 00:42:24,936
I just thought that...

744
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:26,532
I love Freddie.

745
00:42:26,644 --> 00:42:28,942
What's your point?

746
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:31,844
Don't feel bad about
being good at your job.

747
00:42:34,351 --> 00:42:37,013
I wish it hadn't happened this way.

748
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:40,917
That's the way it happened.

749
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,593
Congratulations.

750
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,420
- Miss Olson...
- In a minute.

751
00:43:13,524 --> 00:43:15,458
You couldn't keep your mouth shut.

752
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:16,617
Mr. Campbell.

753
00:43:16,727 --> 00:43:18,786
Do you know what you
did to Freddie Rumsen?

754
00:43:18,896 --> 00:43:19,954
For just cause.

755
00:43:20,064 --> 00:43:21,395
You didn't have to tell Don.

756
00:43:21,498 --> 00:43:22,590
You told on Mr. Rumsen?

757
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:23,758
Do you mind?

758
00:43:28,172 --> 00:43:29,537
It would have gotten out anyway.

759
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,404
Right, and he'd be some legend
in one of those stupid stories.

760
00:43:32,509 --> 00:43:35,239
Remember the guy who wet his pants
before the big meeting?

761
00:43:35,346 --> 00:43:36,438
Instead, he's finished.

762
00:43:36,547 --> 00:43:38,139
Why do you feel bad for him?

763
00:43:38,248 --> 00:43:41,115
Those people always blame
their problems on society.

764
00:43:41,218 --> 00:43:42,344
He did it to himself.

765
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:43,784
Those people have no self-control.

766
00:43:43,887 --> 00:43:45,821
If it wasn't for him,
I'd still be a secretary.

767
00:43:45,923 --> 00:43:48,756
If it wasn't for me,
you'd still be a junior copywriter.

768
00:43:50,561 --> 00:43:52,222
I refuse to feel bad.

769
00:43:52,329 --> 00:43:53,853
We're going to get raises.

770
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:55,192
You could get his office.

771
00:43:57,601 --> 00:43:59,831
Now, I'll go first.

772
00:43:59,937 --> 00:44:01,962
Congratulations, Peggy.

773
00:44:05,442 --> 00:44:06,875
Congratulations, Pete.

774
00:44:16,353 --> 00:44:17,411
Good to see you.

775
00:44:17,521 --> 00:44:19,819
This is me.

776
00:44:19,923 --> 00:44:22,187
It's nice to see you.

777
00:44:22,292 --> 00:44:23,657
What are you doing here?

778
00:44:23,761 --> 00:44:25,194
Betty invited me for lunch,

779
00:44:25,295 --> 00:44:27,388
but we're going
to need another place setting.

780
00:44:30,234 --> 00:44:31,667
We're going to be three.

781
00:44:35,305 --> 00:44:37,170
Betty didn't say you'd be joining us.

782
00:44:37,274 --> 00:44:39,174
I hope I'm not intruding.

783
00:44:39,276 --> 00:44:40,607
She thought it would be fun.

784
00:44:40,711 --> 00:44:42,838
It will be.

785
00:44:42,946 --> 00:44:46,939
It's just gotten infinitely more fun.

786
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:50,949
I think I need whatever you're having.

787
00:44:51,055 --> 00:44:52,750
It's a gin and tonic.

788
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:54,517
Nothing special.

789
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:56,149
It's perfect.

790
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:04,899
Keep stirring.

791
00:45:09,807 --> 00:45:11,775
Bobby, go get two spoons.

792
00:45:27,024 --> 00:45:29,219
So with Indian Point open now,

793
00:45:29,326 --> 00:45:32,159
we should be able to use
even a modest safety record.

794
00:45:32,262 --> 00:45:34,924
We were spitballing
about a cartoon turtle.

795
00:45:35,032 --> 00:45:39,025
Kids... keeps it friendly
and nature-loving,

796
00:45:39,136 --> 00:45:40,865
and then we just hammer
the Ravenswood area

797
00:45:40,971 --> 00:45:42,529
until they're ready for the next plant.

798
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:45,001
You on board with that?

799
00:45:48,145 --> 00:45:49,305
Yes.

800
00:45:50,881 --> 00:45:52,371
I want to see schedules,

801
00:45:52,483 --> 00:45:54,542
and I want to see this turtle.

802
00:46:02,826 --> 00:46:05,317
He doesn't want to be disturbed.

803
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:09,626
Hello, Don.

804
00:46:09,733 --> 00:46:11,701
Hello, Mona. Jane, it's okay.

805
00:46:17,241 --> 00:46:18,731
Just stop.

806
00:46:18,842 --> 00:46:19,900
What?

807
00:46:21,545 --> 00:46:23,513
I don't even know what to say to you.

808
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:25,013
About what?

809
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:27,675
Don't act innocent.

810
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:30,982
He's leaving me for his secretary.

811
00:46:31,088 --> 00:46:32,214
Roger?

812
00:46:32,322 --> 00:46:35,485
He's in love,
and you said it was great.

813
00:46:35,592 --> 00:46:37,116
Mona, I didn't say anything.

814
00:46:37,227 --> 00:46:41,630
"It's your life.
You have to move forward."

815
00:46:44,334 --> 00:46:45,892
Mona, I didn't mean it that way.

816
00:46:46,003 --> 00:46:47,868
25 years of marriage.

817
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:54,409
I want you to calm down.

818
00:46:54,511 --> 00:46:56,843
Don't make me make a scene.

819
00:46:56,947 --> 00:46:58,710
We should talk about this.

820
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:00,716
You can talk to Margaret.

821
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:27,573
Listen, Don, I can explain.

822
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:29,646
I want her off my desk.

823
00:48:27,004 --> 00:48:29,973
