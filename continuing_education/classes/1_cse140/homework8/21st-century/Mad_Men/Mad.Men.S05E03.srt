00:00:00,542 --> 00:00:02,102
Previously on Mad Men...

2
00:00:02,191 --> 00:00:06,057
Those of you who meet the
qualifications will receive an interview.

3
00:00:06,771 --> 00:00:10,462
- <i>Je voudrais mas</i> Harry.
- Good morning.

4
00:00:11,361 --> 00:00:14,084
Beans, they have to be cool.

5
00:00:14,174 --> 00:00:15,991
Don, you know what
I'm talking about.

6
00:00:16,314 --> 00:00:17,688
Things aren't perfect.

7
00:00:18,275 --> 00:00:20,153
Mohawk is coming in,
I brought them in.

8
00:00:20,275 --> 00:00:21,288
What do you know about that?

9
00:00:21,389 --> 00:00:23,171
This does not involve you, Roger.

10
00:00:23,315 --> 00:00:25,175
I know what you see in her...

11
00:00:26,211 --> 00:00:28,188
and you could have
gotten it without marrying.

13
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:10,281
Betty, are you ready?

14
00:01:12,284 --> 00:01:13,751
It's stuck.

15
00:01:13,752 --> 00:01:16,286
What about now?

16
00:01:17,555 --> 00:01:19,090
<i>Betty!</i>

17
00:01:19,091 --> 00:01:20,825
I'll get it.
Just go.

18
00:01:22,427 --> 00:01:24,695
Betty.
The car is here!

19
00:01:29,734 --> 00:01:31,801
What's going on?
We've got to go.

20
00:01:31,802 --> 00:01:34,738
Darling, I just don't think
I can go tonight.

21
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:36,873
What's the matter?

22
00:01:36,874 --> 00:01:40,877
It's... a woman's thing.

23
00:01:40,878 --> 00:01:43,646
Is there any way
you could play with pain?

24
00:01:43,647 --> 00:01:44,947
It's the junior league
of New York.

25
00:01:44,948 --> 00:01:46,648
I don't want to
do it without you.

26
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:49,151
Your mother will be there.
It'll be very endearing.

27
00:01:56,392 --> 00:01:58,293
Forgive me on the way?

28
00:02:15,778 --> 00:02:17,010
Thank you.

29
00:02:21,582 --> 00:02:23,383
Say <i>"au revoir."</i>

30
00:02:26,587 --> 00:02:29,489
Bon jour, Marie.

31
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:31,691
Marie, I can't understand you.

32
00:02:31,692 --> 00:02:34,160
- <i>Moustiques?</i>
<i>- Mosquitoes.</i>

33
00:02:34,161 --> 00:02:37,263
Okay, mama.

34
00:02:39,732 --> 00:02:41,366
We can't let Heinz
beat us there.

35
00:02:41,367 --> 00:02:43,202
He has a name, you know.

36
00:02:43,203 --> 00:02:44,870
And do you know what that is?

37
00:02:44,871 --> 00:02:46,205
Are you kidding me?

38
00:02:46,206 --> 00:02:48,507
He's the only man I want
to please more than you.

39
00:02:48,508 --> 00:02:50,108
And your father.

40
00:02:50,109 --> 00:02:51,976
I'm the baby.
They miss me.

41
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,916
So, Megan, you're French.
I suppose I should ask you what looks good.

42
00:02:57,917 --> 00:02:59,717
I'm Canadian.

43
00:02:59,718 --> 00:03:02,020
Although for all
we know, they are, too.

44
00:03:02,021 --> 00:03:03,888
You know, back in Pittsburgh,

45
00:03:03,889 --> 00:03:06,589
everybody's pretty much
who you expect them to be.

46
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,058
Or you know them forever.

47
00:03:08,059 --> 00:03:10,260
Raymond and I
met in high school.

48
00:03:10,261 --> 00:03:13,831
Well, then we've been
married longer than you.

49
00:03:13,832 --> 00:03:16,934
- I told you he was smooth.
- How did you two meet?

50
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:21,470
- Well...
- At work.

51
00:03:21,471 --> 00:03:24,173
Don was divorced.

52
00:03:24,174 --> 00:03:26,675
Well, that's none
of my business.

53
00:03:29,612 --> 00:03:31,314
You have a teenage
daughter, Emily.

54
00:03:31,315 --> 00:03:33,749
- How's her summer?
- It's tough.

55
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,784
She's around the house
all the time.

56
00:03:35,785 --> 00:03:38,486
Too old for camp,
too young for a job.

57
00:03:38,487 --> 00:03:41,323
- I say let her enjoy it.
- I agree.

58
00:03:41,324 --> 00:03:43,725
You don't sound so happy
about it when I get home.

59
00:03:43,726 --> 00:03:45,961
Well, the music is so loud.

60
00:03:45,962 --> 00:03:49,097
Do you know
the Rolling Stones, Don?

61
00:03:49,098 --> 00:03:52,100
- Sure.
- The Stones.

62
00:03:52,101 --> 00:03:54,268
She can't get enough of them.

63
00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:57,671
The other night, she's playing this
song "Time, Time Is On Your Side."

64
00:03:57,672 --> 00:04:00,574
- "Time Is On My Side."
- Yes, it is, dear.

65
00:04:00,575 --> 00:04:03,210
Well, it's catchy.
And I was thinking,

66
00:04:03,211 --> 00:04:05,479
what if they were
to sing, you know,

67
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:09,349
"Heinz, Heinz, Heinz
is on my side"?

68
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,817
Or something like that.
I don't know.

69
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:15,721
They're gonna be in New York.

70
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:17,857
Emily almost jumped in our bags with
us when she heard we were coming.

71
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:20,293
Maybe you could, you know,

72
00:04:20,294 --> 00:04:22,996
get them to record
it while they're here.

73
00:04:22,997 --> 00:04:24,697
Well, that's not exactly
the way it works,

74
00:04:24,698 --> 00:04:27,232
but we can certainly
approach them.

75
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:29,968
This is boring.
Am I right, Megan?

76
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:35,473
Yes?

77
00:04:38,912 --> 00:04:40,345
Clara, where is Roger?

78
00:04:41,846 --> 00:04:43,314
Caroline says the meeting
<i>is in his office.</i>

79
00:04:48,787 --> 00:04:50,421
You wanted to see me?

80
00:04:50,422 --> 00:04:51,555
I was waiting in my office
to give you some good news.

81
00:04:51,556 --> 00:04:53,690
Drinking good news?

82
00:04:53,691 --> 00:04:56,127
Mohawk called.

83
00:04:56,128 --> 00:04:58,295
You're welcome.

84
00:04:58,296 --> 00:05:00,964
They haven't informed
their agency,

85
00:05:00,965 --> 00:05:02,832
but I'm told it's
a matter of hours.

86
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:04,801
Welcome back, suckers.

87
00:05:04,802 --> 00:05:06,836
I think you should
handle the account.

88
00:05:06,837 --> 00:05:10,407
- So, they asked for me?
- They enjoy your company.

89
00:05:10,408 --> 00:05:12,108
And since you were here
when they were here,

90
00:05:12,109 --> 00:05:13,675
they think you know
their business.

91
00:05:13,676 --> 00:05:15,510
I know Hank from the war.
He likes vodka.

92
00:05:15,511 --> 00:05:17,846
Jack likes Jack.
Anything else?

93
00:05:17,847 --> 00:05:20,782
So you're aware they've taken
on $54 million in debt

94
00:05:20,783 --> 00:05:24,320
to replace their planes?
And there's a mechanic strike looming.

95
00:05:24,321 --> 00:05:26,989
- Although they'll likely be spared.
- So far, so good.

96
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,390
Don and I have been
trying to explain to Lane

97
00:05:29,391 --> 00:05:31,892
this is a daily business and we'll
need a dedicated copywriter.

98
00:05:31,893 --> 00:05:34,795
I don't understand why Miss
Olson can't handle it.

99
00:05:34,796 --> 00:05:36,965
Because these guys are gonna
ask her to make drinks.

100
00:05:36,966 --> 00:05:39,133
We're still paying Don,
aren't we?

101
00:05:39,134 --> 00:05:41,836
Don's not going to rewrite local
fare ads three times a week.

102
00:05:41,837 --> 00:05:43,704
That's all it is?

103
00:05:43,705 --> 00:05:47,707
Just get a guy with basic retail
experience and run with it.

104
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:49,876
Congratulations!

105
00:05:49,877 --> 00:05:53,046
Lane, smile.
We've got an airline.

106
00:05:57,185 --> 00:05:58,551
Morning.
I'm here to see Don.

107
00:05:58,552 --> 00:06:01,087
Yes, just a minute.
Mr. Draper.

108
00:06:01,088 --> 00:06:02,654
Mr. Crane to see you.

109
00:06:02,655 --> 00:06:04,690
<i>Just a minute, Dawn.</i>

110
00:06:04,691 --> 00:06:06,292
Is Don in a meeting?

111
00:06:06,293 --> 00:06:08,160
He's with Mrs. Draper.

112
00:06:08,161 --> 00:06:09,962
Thank you, Dawn.

113
00:06:09,963 --> 00:06:11,597
You're welcome.

114
00:06:13,533 --> 00:06:15,167
It's so confusing.

115
00:06:15,168 --> 00:06:16,568
People keep saying that.

116
00:06:16,569 --> 00:06:18,703
But we haven't had
any problems.

117
00:06:18,704 --> 00:06:20,372
You haven't.
But out in the office,

118
00:06:20,373 --> 00:06:22,974
it's really hard
to tell who's who.

119
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,881
- Hello, Harry.
- Good morning.

120
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,952
Backstage Forest Hills tennis
stadium Saturday night,

121
00:06:35,953 --> 00:06:38,322
put your hands together
for the Rolling Stones.

122
00:06:38,323 --> 00:06:40,124
And how would you
gauge their interest?

123
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:42,926
The manager sounded greedy.
I thought we'd take one car.

124
00:06:42,927 --> 00:06:45,195
- I'll drive.
- It starts at 8:00.

125
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:47,664
But apparently they're always late.
I thought we could grab a bite.

126
00:06:47,665 --> 00:06:50,567
There's a dynamite Italian restaurant
with a first-rate veal parm.

127
00:06:50,568 --> 00:06:53,069
- Nope.
- Good.

128
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:56,439
Then I will be ready
at 7:30 having eaten.

129
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,675
Have Dawn pencil it in.

130
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:26,534
- Hello, Pauline.
- Hello, dear.

131
00:07:26,535 --> 00:07:29,403
I just wanted to see
how you were feeling.

132
00:07:31,239 --> 00:07:33,007
Aren't you sweet to come
all the way over here

133
00:07:33,008 --> 00:07:35,142
when a phone call
would've sufficed?

134
00:07:35,143 --> 00:07:36,844
Are the children home?

135
00:07:36,845 --> 00:07:39,179
They're at day camp.
You know that.

136
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:42,683
Betty, you were sorely
missed last night.

137
00:07:42,684 --> 00:07:45,953
Well, that's good
to hear, I guess.

138
00:07:45,954 --> 00:07:48,622
You've missed a bunch
of these, Betty.

139
00:07:48,623 --> 00:07:50,791
Pauline...

140
00:07:50,792 --> 00:07:52,626
And I'm sure he never shows it,

141
00:07:52,627 --> 00:07:56,829
but it upsets Henry
when you're not there.

142
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,831
I want him to be happy.

143
00:07:58,832 --> 00:08:01,333
And you being with him
is part of that.

144
00:08:01,334 --> 00:08:04,003
I wasn't feeling well.

145
00:08:04,004 --> 00:08:07,673
Honey, I know how it happens.

146
00:08:07,674 --> 00:08:12,043
You get comfortable
and you give up a little bit.

147
00:08:12,044 --> 00:08:15,313
And then it just
gets out of control.

148
00:08:16,716 --> 00:08:18,750
There are things
you can do about this.

149
00:08:18,751 --> 00:08:21,720
There are pills you can take.

150
00:08:21,721 --> 00:08:24,055
Why haven't you taken them?

151
00:08:25,257 --> 00:08:27,858
Believe me, I would if I could.

152
00:08:27,859 --> 00:08:30,127
I have a heart condition.

153
00:08:30,128 --> 00:08:31,929
And honestly, at my age,

154
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:34,999
I don't have to
please men anymore.

155
00:08:38,103 --> 00:08:41,171
But you...

156
00:08:41,172 --> 00:08:42,639
Don't you want to get back

157
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,575
into that incredible
closet of yours again?

158
00:08:51,348 --> 00:08:53,850
It'll be easy for you.

159
00:08:53,851 --> 00:08:56,719
You're just one of those girls.

160
00:09:03,325 --> 00:09:05,827
Thank you, Dawn.

161
00:09:05,828 --> 00:09:08,896
- What's so funny?
- She was the most qualified.

162
00:09:10,232 --> 00:09:11,599
We've got great news,

163
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,834
but assume this is for
your ample ears only.

164
00:09:13,835 --> 00:09:15,736
Is it about Heinz
and the Rolling Stones?

165
00:09:15,737 --> 00:09:17,605
- What?
- No.

166
00:09:17,606 --> 00:09:19,574
Harry's such a liar.

167
00:09:19,575 --> 00:09:21,342
Baked beans
and the Rolling Stones.

168
00:09:21,343 --> 00:09:23,310
A client's idea
if I ever heard one.

169
00:09:23,311 --> 00:09:25,212
Mohawk airlines is returning.

170
00:09:25,213 --> 00:09:27,381
That's great.
That's a big fish.

171
00:09:27,382 --> 00:09:29,416
It's a minnow,
but it's our minnow.

172
00:09:29,417 --> 00:09:31,652
Well, I obviously
have experience.

173
00:09:31,653 --> 00:09:34,454
- I mean, at a low level, but I saw how it worked.
- Your plate is full.

174
00:09:34,455 --> 00:09:38,258
And, frankly, Mohawk is going to
insist on a regular copywriter.

175
00:09:38,259 --> 00:09:41,194
- Someone with a penis.
- I'll work on that.

176
00:09:41,195 --> 00:09:43,496
Call in books.
You're the search committee.

177
00:09:43,497 --> 00:09:45,231
- Okay, when?
- Immediately.

178
00:09:45,232 --> 00:09:46,865
Now, this is gonna
be my account.

179
00:09:46,866 --> 00:09:49,368
So I don't want just some
hack with retail experience.

180
00:09:49,369 --> 00:09:52,171
He should be brilliant
and have awards.

181
00:09:52,172 --> 00:09:55,007
I want you to bring me
a good-looking version of Don.

182
00:09:55,008 --> 00:09:57,008
Oh, that'll be easy.

183
00:10:01,514 --> 00:10:03,448
- Mrs. Francis.
- Hello.

184
00:10:03,449 --> 00:10:05,317
So nice of you
to see me so quickly.

185
00:10:05,318 --> 00:10:07,051
Well, slow day.

186
00:10:07,052 --> 00:10:09,087
What seems to be the

187
00:10:09,088 --> 00:10:11,855
well, it's just that
I've been wondering--

188
00:10:13,592 --> 00:10:16,059
I've put on a few pounds

189
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:19,363
and I haven't had much luck
reducing on my own for some reason.

190
00:10:19,364 --> 00:10:22,966
Well, with middle-aged women, it gets easier
to put it on and harder to take it off.

191
00:10:25,303 --> 00:10:29,539
Well, a friend told me
it'd be easier

192
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,941
if you gave me diet pills.

193
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:36,078
Just to give me
a little jump-start.

194
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,448
Is your friend a doctor?

195
00:10:38,449 --> 00:10:40,216
No.

196
00:10:40,217 --> 00:10:42,218
Well, I'm not going to
give you a prescription


197
00:10:42,219 --> 00:10:44,919
without giving you an exam.

198
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,389
For diet pills?

199
00:10:48,725 --> 00:10:50,492
If you think it's necessary.

200
00:10:50,493 --> 00:10:53,328
Mrs. Francis, when a housewife
has a rapid weight gain,

201
00:10:53,329 --> 00:10:55,997
the cause is usually
psychological--

202
00:10:55,998 --> 00:10:59,568
Unhappiness, anxiety,
boredom--

203
00:10:59,569 --> 00:11:02,237
Things that cause us
to lose our self-control.

204
00:11:02,238 --> 00:11:05,140
But first, we have to rule out

205
00:11:05,141 --> 00:11:08,009
diabetes, hyperthyroidism.

206
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:10,544
Well, I don't need
to take the pills forever.

207
00:11:11,781 --> 00:11:13,948
I don't like that.

208
00:11:13,949 --> 00:11:15,949
- What?
- Shh.

209
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:19,619
Could you swallow?

210
00:11:25,794 --> 00:11:28,495
Henry!

211
00:11:29,363 --> 00:11:31,131
Henry!

212
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,101
<i>Henry!</i>

213
00:11:35,102 --> 00:11:38,271
<i>Mrs. Francis is on line one.</i>

214
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:45,211
- Betts, you there?
- Don.

215
00:11:45,212 --> 00:11:47,546
- I don't know what to do.
- About what?

216
00:11:47,547 --> 00:11:49,948
I went to the doctor this morning
and he found this thing.

217
00:11:49,949 --> 00:11:54,152
It's a--
a node or a nodule

218
00:11:54,153 --> 00:11:56,154
or something
and it's on my thyroid.

219
00:11:56,155 --> 00:12:00,358
They don't know what it is,
but it's a lump, Don.

220
00:12:00,359 --> 00:12:02,694
And he's sending me to the city
to some specialist for tests.

221
00:12:02,695 --> 00:12:04,862
Okay, okay, calm down.

222
00:12:04,863 --> 00:12:07,131
I can't, Don.
I can't.

223
00:12:07,132 --> 00:12:09,133
Betts, what exactly did he say?

224
00:12:09,134 --> 00:12:12,336
Well, nothing.
You know how they are.

225
00:12:15,373 --> 00:12:18,042
Do you want me
to take the kids?

226
00:12:18,043 --> 00:12:20,643
The kids.

227
00:12:22,179 --> 00:12:24,013
Oh, the kids.
Oh, God.

228
00:12:25,716 --> 00:12:27,783
Birdy.

229
00:12:30,154 --> 00:12:32,055
Say what you always say.

230
00:12:34,091 --> 00:12:36,925
Everything's gonna be okay.

231
00:12:36,926 --> 00:12:38,426
Okay.

232
00:12:38,427 --> 00:12:40,528
Bye-bye.

233
00:12:53,175 --> 00:12:55,943
If I see one more volkswagen ad
with something else in it...

234
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,580
You can do an ad
on anything you want.

235
00:12:59,581 --> 00:13:02,649
Don't pick toilet paper,
shit bird.

236
00:13:04,152 --> 00:13:07,888
Too fat.
Too thin.

237
00:13:07,889 --> 00:13:10,257
Shelly Parker-- Might be
a woman, God forbid.

238
00:13:15,129 --> 00:13:17,230
"Judge not,
lest ye be judged."

239
00:13:17,231 --> 00:13:19,332
Irony.
That's promising.

240
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:29,574
Have I lost my sense
of smell or is this good?

241
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,781
That's bitchin'.

242
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:38,450
What's this guy's name?

243
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:41,052
Michael Ginsberg.

244
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:43,721
Nice knowing you, Mike.

245
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:45,924
What are you doing?
That's the best one I've seen.

246
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:47,758
This is why girls
don't play sports.

247
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:50,128
You've been working on
Heinz for four months.

248
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:52,463
Somebody else is gonna carry
the ball across the goal line?

249
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:54,299
Bringing him in for Mohawk.

250
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,733
I hope you like him.
He's gonna be your boss someday.

251
00:13:56,734 --> 00:13:59,702
I like working with talented people.
It inspires me.

252
00:13:59,703 --> 00:14:03,240
I'm not talking about me.
I'm talking about another writer.

253
00:14:03,241 --> 00:14:05,175
Are you suddenly not
competitive?

254
00:14:05,176 --> 00:14:08,645
The chick who races
people to the toilet?

255
00:14:08,646 --> 00:14:10,480
I'm going to bring him in.

256
00:14:10,481 --> 00:14:13,149
Stick to mediocre.
You'll sleep better.

257
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:29,530
<i>Can I come in?</i>

258
00:14:29,531 --> 00:14:31,499
Of course.

259
00:14:33,535 --> 00:14:35,103
I just got off
the phone with Jim.

260
00:14:35,104 --> 00:14:37,372
He said tomorrow at 11:00.

261
00:14:37,373 --> 00:14:39,341
Tomorrow?

262
00:14:39,342 --> 00:14:42,243
My boss made a call.

263
00:14:42,244 --> 00:14:44,078
You told Mayor Lindsay?

264
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,613
He's got bigger secrets
than this, Betty.

265
00:14:48,549 --> 00:14:50,050
I don't know if tomorrow--

266
00:14:50,051 --> 00:14:52,353
You want to wait on this?

267
00:14:52,354 --> 00:14:53,854
Well, if it is something--

268
00:14:53,855 --> 00:14:55,722
If, if, if.

269
00:14:55,723 --> 00:14:58,025
Betty, let's not play
that game, okay?

270
00:15:00,661 --> 00:15:02,428
Come to bed.

271
00:15:02,429 --> 00:15:04,330
You want some Brandy?

272
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:11,705
I see you all the time.
You're beautiful.

273
00:15:11,706 --> 00:15:13,840
You're sweet.

274
00:15:24,918 --> 00:15:27,085
I'm gonna have a Brandy.

275
00:15:31,525 --> 00:15:33,491
Betty.

276
00:15:33,492 --> 00:15:36,394
Betty Draper.
I almost didn't recognize you.

277
00:15:36,395 --> 00:15:39,363
Joyce. Hello.
How are you?

278
00:15:39,364 --> 00:15:41,833
Not good.
I'm here.

279
00:15:41,834 --> 00:15:45,637
Mrs. Francis,
the doctor's waiting.

280
00:15:45,638 --> 00:15:47,138
It's Francis now.

281
00:15:47,139 --> 00:15:49,740
My husband's name
is Henry, too, actually.

282
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:51,074
Look, you know what?

283
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,910
I'm gonna be in
radiology forever.

284
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:55,078
Mrs. Darling, they're
waiting for you, too.

285
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,480
Why are you here?

286
00:15:57,481 --> 00:15:59,650
You want to get
some lunch after?

287
00:15:59,651 --> 00:16:02,252
Oh, I don't know.
My husband's picking me up.

288
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:05,254
You think you don't want to
have lunch, but you do.

289
00:16:06,623 --> 00:16:08,424
Okay.

290
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:10,325
Okay, okay.
I'm going.

291
00:16:18,045 --> 00:16:19,511
Hello.
I'm Peggy Olson.

292
00:16:19,512 --> 00:16:22,448
Michael Ginsberg.
Lead the way.

293
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:24,217
No, we're meeting here.

294
00:16:26,053 --> 00:16:27,553
So what's he like?

295
00:16:27,554 --> 00:16:29,622
Is he like a firm
handshake kind of guy?

296
00:16:29,623 --> 00:16:31,390
- Excuse me?
- Don.

297
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:33,524
I want to make a good impression.
You could help me out.

298
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:36,027
No, I'm interviewing you.
I'm a copywriter.

299
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:37,963
Have a seat.

300
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:42,667
So is Don stopping by?

301
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,870
Nope, it's just me.

302
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:46,638
Can you hire me?

303
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,240
Well, no,
but I'm the first round.

304
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:51,809
Wouldn't you want to talk to
the person who could hire you?

305
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,610
I spent three weeks dancing

306
00:16:53,611 --> 00:16:56,013
at that crappy New York
satellite of Leo Burnett.

307
00:16:56,014 --> 00:16:59,850
Never met him at all.
Turns out Leo's not a real person.

308
00:16:59,851 --> 00:17:02,619
- Yes, he is.
- Is Don a real person?

309
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,888
'Cause I'd really like
to meet him.

310
00:17:04,889 --> 00:17:07,456
I'm the person you need
to impress right now.

311
00:17:07,457 --> 00:17:10,827
You looked at my book.
What more can I say?

312
00:17:12,729 --> 00:17:15,165
Okay.

313
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:18,802
- I liked your work.
- And I like your work.

314
00:17:18,803 --> 00:17:21,503
You thought I was a secretary.
Do you have a current resume?

315
00:17:29,045 --> 00:17:32,147
- Allen Ginsberg?
- He's the most famous Ginsberg there is.

316
00:17:32,148 --> 00:17:34,082
I figured we got
to be related somehow.

317
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:37,551
And what's he gonna say?

318
00:17:37,552 --> 00:17:40,054
Okay, well, it was
nice meeting you.

319
00:17:40,055 --> 00:17:41,923
Oh, nuts.

320
00:17:41,924 --> 00:17:43,657
Listen, my stuff is good.

321
00:17:43,658 --> 00:17:45,960
You can see advertising
ain't my day job.

322
00:17:45,961 --> 00:17:49,297
Look, you're a fair woman.

323
00:17:49,298 --> 00:17:52,699
I insulted you because
I'm honest.

324
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,368
And I apologized
because I'm brave.

325
00:17:55,369 --> 00:17:58,004
I didn't pick this profession.
It picked me.

326
00:17:58,005 --> 00:17:59,772
I didn't have
any control over it.

327
00:17:59,773 --> 00:18:03,143
Turns out, it's the only
thing I can do.

328
00:18:03,144 --> 00:18:04,911
Your work's
very impressive, but...

329
00:18:04,912 --> 00:18:06,412
Here's some other
advantages--

330
00:18:06,413 --> 00:18:08,848
I have no hobbies,
no interests, no friends.

331
00:18:08,849 --> 00:18:11,116
I'm one of those people who
talks back to the radio.

332
00:18:11,117 --> 00:18:14,286
No girlfriend, no family.
I will live here.

333
00:18:14,287 --> 00:18:16,555
Then you're like everyone else.

334
00:18:16,556 --> 00:18:19,524
I've never been accused of
that, but I really am trying.

335
00:18:21,995 --> 00:18:24,229
I don't know.

336
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:27,265
You can't act
like this with Don.

337
00:18:27,266 --> 00:18:29,300
Like what?

338
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:35,306
- We'll call you.
- Okay.

339
00:18:41,012 --> 00:18:43,146
You know, your book
really does have a voice.

340
00:18:43,147 --> 00:18:45,148
That's what they said
about "mein kampf."

341
00:18:45,149 --> 00:18:47,017
"The kid really has
a voice."

342
00:18:53,124 --> 00:18:54,791
You're sure you're
okay just with tea?

343
00:18:54,792 --> 00:18:58,427
- Yes.
- Everything tastes like sawdust to me.

344
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:01,063
Everything still tastes
good to me.

345
00:19:01,064 --> 00:19:03,832
Turns out I have the only
kind that makes you fatter.

346
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:06,068
Look, I'm sure you're fine.

347
00:19:06,069 --> 00:19:08,271
When do you find out
the results?

348
00:19:09,806 --> 00:19:12,240
I don't remember.

349
00:19:12,241 --> 00:19:15,176
It wasn't until the third
visit that I knew.

350
00:19:15,177 --> 00:19:17,712
Because Hank was waiting there.

351
00:19:17,713 --> 00:19:19,781
Have you told your children?

352
00:19:21,017 --> 00:19:22,617
They know I'm going
to the doctor a lot.

353
00:19:22,618 --> 00:19:24,052
And they know I'm sick,

354
00:19:24,053 --> 00:19:27,422
but I've always been
in a bad mood, so...

355
00:19:27,423 --> 00:19:29,423
I joke with Hank.

356
00:19:29,424 --> 00:19:31,725
He should just tell them
I got hit by a car.

357
00:19:31,726 --> 00:19:34,962
It'd be easier to deal
with than saying good-bye.

358
00:19:34,963 --> 00:19:37,798
Ugh, the scene.

359
00:19:40,035 --> 00:19:42,636
I'm leaving behind such a mess.

360
00:19:42,637 --> 00:19:45,538
You're not going anywhere.

361
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:47,640
He's my second husband.

362
00:19:47,641 --> 00:19:50,343
His mother's domineering.

363
00:19:52,179 --> 00:19:53,846
And Don's girlfriend--

364
00:19:53,847 --> 00:19:56,849
Well, they're married.

365
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:59,085
She's 20 years old.

366
00:19:59,086 --> 00:20:01,954
They'll never hear
a nice word about me again.

367
00:20:05,591 --> 00:20:08,626
I'm sorry,
but I have to ask you.

368
00:20:12,765 --> 00:20:15,000
What is it like?

369
00:20:20,072 --> 00:20:23,507
Well,

370
00:20:23,508 --> 00:20:26,277
it's like you're
way out in the ocean

371
00:20:26,278 --> 00:20:28,712
alone and you're paddling,

372
00:20:28,713 --> 00:20:31,148
and you see people
on the shore,

373
00:20:31,149 --> 00:20:33,749
but they're getting
farther and farther away.

374
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,819
And you struggle
because it's natural.

375
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:40,690
Then your mind wanders
back to everything normal.

376
00:20:40,691 --> 00:20:42,392
What am I gonna fix for dinner?

377
00:20:42,393 --> 00:20:44,427
Did I lock the back door?

378
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:48,930
And then you just get so tired,

379
00:20:48,931 --> 00:20:50,899
you just give in

380
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:53,535
and hope you go straight down.

381
00:20:56,239 --> 00:20:59,608
That's horrible.

382
00:20:59,609 --> 00:21:01,977
No one's ever asked.

383
00:21:03,913 --> 00:21:06,414
Hello, ladies.
I am Cecilia,

384
00:21:06,415 --> 00:21:08,416
and I have the gift of sight.

385
00:21:08,417 --> 00:21:10,184
Could I offer you a reading?

386
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:12,953
You're gonna
predict our future?

387
00:21:12,954 --> 00:21:15,956
- Go ahead.
- Really?

388
00:21:15,957 --> 00:21:18,159
It's always good.

389
00:21:26,534 --> 00:21:28,968
- Oh, my.
- What?

390
00:21:28,969 --> 00:21:31,405
You're a great soul.

391
00:21:31,406 --> 00:21:34,574
You mean so much
to the people around you.

392
00:21:36,443 --> 00:21:38,344
You're a rock.

393
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:42,114
Oh, I'm sorry.

394
00:21:42,115 --> 00:21:43,982
We're done.
Thank you.

395
00:21:49,489 --> 00:21:51,223
You need some more tea.

396
00:22:00,832 --> 00:22:03,568
- Are you okay?
- I had drinks with Mohawk.

397
00:22:03,569 --> 00:22:06,971
I sat down with two of them and I
swear by the end there were three.

398
00:22:06,972 --> 00:22:08,939
Did you hire him?

399
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:11,341
No, he was crazy.
I'm calling in more books.

400
00:22:11,342 --> 00:22:13,377
Define crazy for a copywriter.

401
00:22:13,378 --> 00:22:15,812
Sleeps all day,
disrespectful of authority,

402
00:22:15,813 --> 00:22:17,948
drunk half the time.
Did he smell like pee?

403
00:22:17,949 --> 00:22:20,551
- Who smells like pee?
- Writers. Just hire him.

404
00:22:20,552 --> 00:22:22,886
I can't. Don will hate him.
He's certifiable.

405
00:22:22,887 --> 00:22:24,653
I order you to bring him in.

406
00:22:24,654 --> 00:22:27,457
You have to.
I already told Mohawk.

407
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:29,292
Why would you do that?

408
00:22:29,293 --> 00:22:31,994
I wanted to smooth the ground
about working with a Jew.

409
00:22:31,995 --> 00:22:34,397
Turns out, everybody's
got one now.

410
00:22:34,398 --> 00:22:37,500
Tell you the truth, it makes
the agency more modern.

411
00:22:37,501 --> 00:22:40,168
Between that and "it's always darkest
before the dawn" over there.

412
00:22:40,169 --> 00:22:42,637
At least this one
we're hiring on purpose.

413
00:22:42,638 --> 00:22:45,039
I can find another Jew if
that's what you care about.

414
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,209
Look, I know
what you're afraid of.

415
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:49,244
Sweetheart, no one's
gonna replace you.

416
00:22:49,245 --> 00:22:52,314
Oh, I'm not threatened by his talent.
He's not that good.

417
00:22:52,315 --> 00:22:54,649
I just think Don will hate
him and then he'll hate me.

418
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:58,319
Oh. I'll be there.
I'll handle Don.

419
00:23:08,796 --> 00:23:11,165
- How can you hear anything?
- I'm following your advice.

420
00:23:11,166 --> 00:23:14,267
I'm being bathed
in commercials.

421
00:23:14,268 --> 00:23:17,437
My God, you're so square,
you've got corners.

422
00:23:17,438 --> 00:23:19,772
I have to make sure
I look like the man.

423
00:23:23,444 --> 00:23:25,612
If Betty calls
or, you know, the kids,

424
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:27,580
tell them I'll call
them in the morning.

425
00:23:27,581 --> 00:23:29,448
What did she want anyway?

426
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:31,383
Who knows?

427
00:23:31,384 --> 00:23:33,485
Well, have fun.

428
00:23:33,486 --> 00:23:35,387
I don't mean that.

429
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:44,962
This is backstage.
That's the real backstage.

430
00:23:50,735 --> 00:23:52,870
Nice to see yo.

431
00:23:52,871 --> 00:23:55,473
- We're here to see the Rolling Stones.
- They're not here.

432
00:23:55,474 --> 00:23:57,875
Well, actually, we're here to
see their manager, Allen Klein.

433
00:23:57,876 --> 00:23:59,977
- He's not here, either.
- I'm Harry Crane.

434
00:23:59,978 --> 00:24:02,379
- I'm on the list.
- There's no list.

435
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,548
Will you let us know
when they get here?

436
00:24:04,549 --> 00:24:06,550
Sir, I promise you'll know.

437
00:24:09,353 --> 00:24:11,688
I should have talked him out
of this at the dinner table.

438
00:24:11,689 --> 00:24:12,822
Well, we either wait
for them to show up

439
00:24:12,823 --> 00:24:16,425
or wait for them
to come out of there.

440
00:24:16,426 --> 00:24:20,796
Hey, mister, tell your friend I'll
trade him a joint for a cigarette.

441
00:24:20,797 --> 00:24:22,331
You can have one for free.

442
00:24:22,332 --> 00:24:25,668
No, I just wanted to make
sure you guys weren't cops.

443
00:24:25,669 --> 00:24:28,204
Can you light this for me?

444
00:24:28,205 --> 00:24:29,505
There's a cop right over there.

445
00:24:29,506 --> 00:24:31,073
He's cool.

446
00:24:35,777 --> 00:24:37,845
- What are you doing?
- They're cool.

447
00:24:37,846 --> 00:24:39,747
They don't look cool.

448
00:24:46,322 --> 00:24:48,589
- What are you two doing here?
- We're here on business.

449
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:51,491
- What kind of business.
- Advertising.

450
00:24:51,492 --> 00:24:53,493
Like "Bewitched"?

451
00:24:53,494 --> 00:24:57,598
You're Durwood
and he's Mr. Kravitz.

452
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:27,924
Are you sure you want to?

453
00:25:29,193 --> 00:25:30,927
It's been too long.

454
00:25:32,897 --> 00:25:34,864
I thought that's what
you wanted.

455
00:25:44,674 --> 00:25:46,508
You know who has
the best stuff?

456
00:25:46,509 --> 00:25:49,144
- Charlton Heston.
- Who's that?

457
00:25:49,145 --> 00:25:52,948
We went to his house,
he came out naked.

458
00:25:52,949 --> 00:25:54,816
He's a very
good-looking man.

459
00:25:54,817 --> 00:25:57,619
I guess if I looked like that,
I would be naked a lot, too.

460
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:00,454
In fairness, I don't think
he knew we were there.

461
00:26:00,455 --> 00:26:02,156
It was kind of
an impromptu meeting.

462
00:26:02,157 --> 00:26:05,426
We wanted him to be
the voice of Vaporub.

463
00:26:05,427 --> 00:26:07,996
Right?
Wouldn't that be perfect?

464
00:26:07,997 --> 00:26:10,498
She just said she doesn't
know who he is.

465
00:26:10,499 --> 00:26:12,966
Come on, they're letting us in.
I told them how important you are.

466
00:26:12,967 --> 00:26:14,735
- Thank you.
- No, just Harold.

467
00:26:14,736 --> 00:26:16,603
- Who'd you tell 'em I was?
- Just go!

468
00:26:18,773 --> 00:26:20,707
Hey, he's getting
me in, not you.

469
00:26:20,708 --> 00:26:22,609
I'll send for you.

470
00:26:26,247 --> 00:26:28,848
She knows what she's doing.

471
00:26:28,849 --> 00:26:32,618
You really think you're gonna get
the Rolling Stones to do a TV ad?

472
00:26:32,619 --> 00:26:34,820
They did one
for cereal in England.

473
00:26:34,821 --> 00:26:36,455
It must have been
a long time ago.

474
00:26:36,456 --> 00:26:38,524
It was three years ago.

475
00:26:38,525 --> 00:26:41,193
When you were probably,
what, 11?

476
00:26:51,103 --> 00:26:53,238
You see someone
do that in a movie?

477
00:26:53,239 --> 00:26:55,507
You need to relax.

478
00:26:58,645 --> 00:27:01,579
So what do you like so much
about the Rolling Stones?

479
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:05,216
Why don't you get me
backstage and you'll see.

480
00:27:08,053 --> 00:27:12,823
What do you feel
when you hear them?

481
00:27:12,824 --> 00:27:15,825
Brian Jones.

482
00:27:15,826 --> 00:27:17,727
He's a troubadour.

483
00:27:20,398 --> 00:27:22,732
So you feel romantic.

484
00:27:22,733 --> 00:27:25,368
God, you're like
a psychiatrist.

485
00:27:25,369 --> 00:27:28,037
What do you know
about psychiatrists?

486
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:35,744
Do you have a business card

487
00:27:35,745 --> 00:27:38,013
or something I could
try on the doorman?

488
00:27:59,702 --> 00:28:01,135
I'll make breakfast.

489
00:28:01,136 --> 00:28:05,105
If, if, if.

490
00:28:11,246 --> 00:28:13,614
You know what?
I am hungry.

491
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,622
I'm so sorry, sweetheart.

492
00:28:41,274 --> 00:28:43,007
So what do you think?
They gonna show?

493
00:28:43,008 --> 00:28:44,442
Stop looking at your watch.

494
00:28:44,443 --> 00:28:46,711
They're gonna come
when they come.

495
00:28:46,712 --> 00:28:48,179
They're gonna come
right down that hallway

496
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:50,815
and I'm gonna jump on
Brian like Jack Ruby.

497
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:53,284
And what do you
expect to happen?

498
00:28:53,285 --> 00:28:55,519
I'll get into
that dressing room

499
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:59,356
and I'm gonna stare at him
while he tunes his guitar.

500
00:28:59,357 --> 00:29:01,725
He'll see me from across
the room.

501
00:29:01,726 --> 00:29:05,028
I'm lady Jane.
He'll know that.

502
00:29:05,029 --> 00:29:06,997
Then what are you gonna do?

503
00:29:06,998 --> 00:29:10,199
Me I don't know.
Whatever he wants.

504
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,902
And what do you think he wants?

505
00:29:12,903 --> 00:29:14,437
None of you want any of us

506
00:29:14,438 --> 00:29:16,773
to have a good time
just 'cause you never did.

507
00:29:16,774 --> 00:29:20,743
No, we're worried about you.

508
00:29:23,113 --> 00:29:25,414
Got it!
I got it!

509
00:29:25,415 --> 00:29:27,549
They want to do it.
I have never seen people more excited.

510
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:30,018
- Wait, you met them?
<i>- They're here. They're here.</i>

511
00:29:30,019 --> 00:29:32,020
<i>The Stones are here!</i>

512
00:29:42,798 --> 00:29:45,933
Who were you talking to?

513
00:29:45,934 --> 00:29:48,235
They even sounded just like
them when they were singing.

514
00:29:48,236 --> 00:29:50,237
They played for me.

515
00:29:52,607 --> 00:29:54,475
I'm sorry I failed, Don.

516
00:29:54,476 --> 00:29:56,810
We can try again tomorrow.
Asbury Park?

517
00:29:56,811 --> 00:29:59,146
Forget it.
Manager looked right through us.

518
00:30:01,449 --> 00:30:02,950
You want the last one?

519
00:30:02,951 --> 00:30:05,185
There were 20.

520
00:30:05,186 --> 00:30:06,954
I thought you were getting
it for your family.

521
00:30:06,955 --> 00:30:09,223
You know what?
Let them get their own.

522
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:11,825
You bring home a bag
of food and they go at it,

523
00:30:11,826 --> 00:30:14,827
and there's nothing
left for you. Eat first.

524
00:30:14,828 --> 00:30:16,495
That's my recommendation
to people who say

525
00:30:16,496 --> 00:30:20,399
they're getting married
and having kids-- Eat first.

526
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,870
- Sure you don't want it?
- Harry, you have to go.

527
00:30:23,871 --> 00:30:26,772
Just let me sit here
for a second.

528
00:30:28,674 --> 00:30:30,708
I have to get home.

529
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,647
Those girls, Don.

530
00:30:36,648 --> 00:30:39,017
Those young girls.

531
00:30:39,018 --> 00:30:41,052
They are so much fun.

532
00:30:41,053 --> 00:30:44,188
Everybody's having fun.
They're all on drugs.

533
00:30:44,189 --> 00:30:46,490
You're on drugs.

534
00:30:46,491 --> 00:30:48,525
You signed the trade winds.
Who the hell are they?

535
00:30:50,528 --> 00:30:52,263
Just go inside.

536
00:30:53,598 --> 00:30:55,432
What are we gonna tell Raymond?

537
00:30:55,433 --> 00:30:57,968
That the Rolling Stones
aren't good for Heinz.

538
00:30:57,969 --> 00:30:59,403
Yeah.

539
00:30:59,404 --> 00:31:01,837
His daughter just probably
wanted to meet them.

540
00:31:01,838 --> 00:31:04,307
I don't think they're good
for her, either.

541
00:31:06,377 --> 00:31:09,145
I'm gonna leave the bag.

542
00:31:09,146 --> 00:31:10,880
Jennifer has me on a diet.

543
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:15,484
- We should do this again.
- Bye, Harry.

544
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:32,071
I waited as long as I could,
but we've got to go.

545
00:31:37,177 --> 00:31:38,978
Really?

546
00:31:38,979 --> 00:31:40,880
Drink too much with the Stones?

547
00:31:40,881 --> 00:31:44,015
No, we didn't get to meet them.

548
00:31:44,016 --> 00:31:46,284
Well, you'll have plenty
of time to tell me.

549
00:31:46,285 --> 00:31:48,253
It takes forever
to get to Fire Island.

550
00:31:50,355 --> 00:31:52,123
Did Betty call?

551
00:31:52,124 --> 00:31:55,160
No.
Let's go.

552
00:31:55,161 --> 00:31:57,228
Megan.

553
00:31:59,097 --> 00:32:00,730
What?

554
00:32:05,236 --> 00:32:08,672
I have to tell you something.

555
00:32:08,673 --> 00:32:10,174
What happened?

556
00:32:10,175 --> 00:32:12,342
It's Betty.

557
00:32:12,343 --> 00:32:15,978
She might be sick.
Really sick.

558
00:32:15,979 --> 00:32:18,147
What?

559
00:32:18,148 --> 00:32:20,582
They found a tumor.

560
00:32:20,583 --> 00:32:22,751
That's terrible.

561
00:32:24,354 --> 00:32:27,089
Why didn't you tell me?

562
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:29,491
I didn't know how you'd react.

563
00:32:29,492 --> 00:32:32,027
What, did you think
I'd be happy?

564
00:32:32,028 --> 00:32:34,696
I don't know what I thought.
I just knew she wouldn't want you to know.

565
00:32:34,697 --> 00:32:37,465
Well, it affects me.

566
00:32:37,466 --> 00:32:40,535
There's a possibility
that it's nothing.

567
00:32:40,536 --> 00:32:43,638
And if it's something,
we'll deal with it.

568
00:32:43,639 --> 00:32:45,106
You know I love Sally.

569
00:32:45,107 --> 00:32:47,007
No, no, no. I don't want
to have that conversation.

570
00:32:49,311 --> 00:32:50,677
Great.
Then let's go.

571
00:32:50,678 --> 00:32:52,479
Your trunk's on the dresser.

572
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,581
No.

573
00:32:56,684 --> 00:32:58,785
I just can't.

574
00:33:00,322 --> 00:33:02,355
Megan, you are 26 years old.

575
00:33:02,356 --> 00:33:04,824
So I don't understand death?

576
00:33:04,825 --> 00:33:08,361
I understand you went to
that concert last night,

577
00:33:08,362 --> 00:33:11,764
but now it's suddenly too overwhelming
when we're supposed to go see my friends.

578
00:33:18,537 --> 00:33:21,406
Come on.

579
00:33:21,407 --> 00:33:23,275
There's nothing you can do.

580
00:33:25,678 --> 00:33:27,913
It's okay.

581
00:34:04,816 --> 00:34:07,950
This is very provocative.

582
00:34:07,951 --> 00:34:10,686
Oh, that one.
I was at the movies.

583
00:34:10,687 --> 00:34:14,256
Well, not the movies.
I was in Times Square at a peep show.

584
00:34:14,257 --> 00:34:16,893
- Shouldn't we wait for Roger?
- For what?

585
00:34:16,894 --> 00:34:19,295
He doesn't even come to the
meetings that are important.

586
00:34:19,296 --> 00:34:22,031
- Go on.
- There's a resume in there.

587
00:34:23,466 --> 00:34:25,400
Okay.

588
00:34:28,805 --> 00:34:31,172
So you were at Needham
for a long time

589
00:34:31,173 --> 00:34:33,007
and a lot of other places
for a short time.

590
00:34:33,008 --> 00:34:35,444
I checked his references thoroughly
or I wouldn't have brought him in.

591
00:34:35,445 --> 00:34:37,245
Would you let him talk?

592
00:34:37,246 --> 00:34:39,279
Ahem.

593
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,750
I'm opinionated, but I
know if you were my boss,

594
00:34:42,751 --> 00:34:45,619
I would have no problem
saying, "Okay, Don."

595
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,688
Unless you want me
to call you "Mr. Draper."

596
00:34:47,689 --> 00:34:50,190
I worked for someone like that.

597
00:34:50,191 --> 00:34:51,659
Kirk Whitby?

598
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:53,794
I'm not gonna say.

599
00:34:53,795 --> 00:34:56,228
You wouldn't want me running all
over town telling your secrets.

600
00:34:56,229 --> 00:34:58,631
Well, I wouldn't want you
grumbling behind my back, either.

601
00:34:58,632 --> 00:35:00,800
You're right.
I shouldn't have said that.

602
00:35:00,801 --> 00:35:02,936
I just wanted
to make you smile.

603
00:35:04,772 --> 00:35:07,139
I'll be honest.

604
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:09,241
I've admired you
since the letter.

605
00:35:09,242 --> 00:35:11,743
I thought it was the funniest
thing I ever read.

606
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:13,879
<i>And the fact that I can</i>
<i>say the letter</i>

607
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:16,081
and everyone knows
what I'm talking about.

608
00:35:16,082 --> 00:35:19,585
I just want to be
a part of this place.

609
00:35:19,586 --> 00:35:21,920
I think it's on the way up.

610
00:35:21,921 --> 00:35:23,622
Between you and Margaret...

611
00:35:23,623 --> 00:35:25,858
She's very interesting.

612
00:35:25,859 --> 00:35:28,058
And I think I made
it clear, so are you.

613
00:35:34,032 --> 00:35:35,633
Pleasure to meet you, Michael.

614
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:48,845
Good work.

615
00:35:48,846 --> 00:35:50,714
Thanks.

616
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:53,449
Promise me you didn't just
hire the handsomest one.

617
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:55,051
Anything else?

618
00:35:55,052 --> 00:35:57,086
Get him set up and let
him haggle with Lane.

619
00:36:04,895 --> 00:36:07,229
Roger, I see you've met
Mr. Ginsberg.

620
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:10,699
Yeah, turns out we both have a dream of
throwing something through this window.

621
00:36:12,602 --> 00:36:14,869
- How'd it go?
- Good.

622
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:17,138
See?
I'm proud of you.

623
00:36:17,139 --> 00:36:19,106
Mr. Ginsberg,
follow me.

624
00:36:24,813 --> 00:36:26,480
Ahem, I'm sorry.

625
00:36:26,481 --> 00:36:29,083
My stomach grumbles sometimes and
it can sound like the F word.

626
00:36:29,084 --> 00:36:31,384
You kn, I thought you were crazy when
I met you, and you have confirmed it

627
00:36:31,385 --> 00:36:33,420
by not acting the way
that you acted with me.

628
00:36:33,421 --> 00:36:35,288
You told me
not to act that way.

629
00:36:35,289 --> 00:36:38,025
And the fact that you can
control it really scares me.

630
00:36:40,461 --> 00:36:42,128
So I'm not getting the job?

631
00:36:42,129 --> 00:36:44,330
No, you start tomorrow.

632
00:36:49,036 --> 00:36:51,236
I would like to pick you up and
spin you around right now,

633
00:36:51,237 --> 00:36:53,439
but I don't want people to think
that's how I got the job.

634
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,274
I'm glad you're excited.

635
00:36:55,275 --> 00:36:59,011
Come on, be proud of me.
I need it.

636
00:36:59,012 --> 00:37:01,981
Nobody in the world cares
I got the job but you.

637
00:37:01,982 --> 00:37:04,148
Then I'm happy.

638
00:37:04,149 --> 00:37:05,884
I can't believe this.

639
00:37:17,329 --> 00:37:19,129
You should have
just gone in to work.

640
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:21,531
Come on.

641
00:37:21,532 --> 00:37:23,033
Do you want me to
turn down the TV?

642
00:37:23,034 --> 00:37:26,103
It's fine.
Henry Francis.

643
00:37:26,104 --> 00:37:28,739
Well, tell Jim His Honor's
not going to Michigan.

644
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:30,608
Because Romey's a clown

645
00:37:30,609 --> 00:37:32,876
and I don't want him
standing next to him.

646
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:41,717
Because he got a city to run.

647
00:37:41,718 --> 00:37:43,418
Can we talk later?

648
00:37:49,258 --> 00:37:52,427
Francis residence.

649
00:37:52,428 --> 00:37:54,429
This is Betty.

650
00:37:55,364 --> 00:37:57,698
Okay.

651
00:37:57,699 --> 00:38:01,035
Okay.

652
00:38:01,036 --> 00:38:04,338
Yes.

653
00:38:04,339 --> 00:38:07,742
Thank you for getting
back to me so quickly.

654
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:10,344
Okay.

655
00:38:10,345 --> 00:38:12,246
Good-bye.

656
00:38:20,187 --> 00:38:22,789
It's benign.

657
00:38:26,226 --> 00:38:28,528
I knew it.

658
00:38:32,365 --> 00:38:34,533
I'm so happy.

659
00:38:37,837 --> 00:38:40,505
You're okay, you know.

660
00:38:40,506 --> 00:38:44,743
I feel like I just
got off a boat from China.

661
00:38:44,744 --> 00:38:48,079
Hey, everything's okay.

662
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,114
No, it's good.

663
00:38:50,115 --> 00:38:52,283
It's good.

664
00:38:52,284 --> 00:38:53,718
It's nice to be put
through the wringer

665
00:38:53,719 --> 00:38:56,120
and find out I'm just fat.

666
00:38:56,121 --> 00:39:00,024
Betty, come on.
You're exhausted.

667
00:39:00,025 --> 00:39:03,126
That's what it is, isn't it?

668
00:39:03,127 --> 00:39:06,629
I don't know
how many ways to tell you,

669
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:09,733
but I don't see it.

670
00:39:09,734 --> 00:39:11,702
I know.

671
00:39:11,703 --> 00:39:13,170
Your mother's obese.

672
00:39:13,171 --> 00:39:15,906
Hey.
Listen to me.

673
00:39:15,907 --> 00:39:18,040
I feel like I've been
given a gift.

674
00:39:18,041 --> 00:39:20,076
Like scrooge seeing
his tombstone.

675
00:39:20,077 --> 00:39:23,512
Oh, my God, this is what it could be.
But it's not gonna be.

676
00:39:38,951 --> 00:39:40,586
Saturday night was fun.

677
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:42,454
Okay.

678
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:53,698
I'd like to say that
I've gathered you all here

679
00:39:53,699 --> 00:39:56,967
so you may remember how small
this agency once was.

680
00:39:58,804 --> 00:40:00,538
Mohawk Airlines
has chosen to return

681
00:40:00,539 --> 00:40:02,373
to Sterling Cooper
Draper Pryce.

682
00:40:07,978 --> 00:40:10,714
Now, now.
I'm just pleased

683
00:40:10,715 --> 00:40:13,316
that after a long effort
I was able to sign them.

684
00:40:13,317 --> 00:40:16,019
I've also hired a new copywriter

685
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:18,889
and look forward to great
success with your help.

686
00:40:21,592 --> 00:40:23,059
Oh, and, of course,

687
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:25,127
Mr. Sterling will be
handling the day to day.

688
00:40:25,128 --> 00:40:26,762
But rest assured,

689
00:40:26,763 --> 00:40:29,197
everything he knows I'll know.

690
00:40:37,173 --> 00:40:38,941
You gonna break that
over its nose?

691
00:40:40,876 --> 00:40:42,644
Forget everything
I said before.

692
00:40:42,645 --> 00:40:45,379
- Excuse me?
- That's the last guy I hired.

693
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:47,916
Hey! Ooh!

694
00:40:56,624 --> 00:40:58,492
- Roger.
- What?

695
00:41:01,028 --> 00:41:03,129
Little prick dangled it in
front of me and took it away.

696
00:41:05,433 --> 00:41:07,534
It was disrespectful.

697
00:41:07,535 --> 00:41:09,470
You know, I used to
love that kid.

698
00:41:09,471 --> 00:41:12,271
I would hold his hand and
help him up on the swing set.

699
00:41:12,272 --> 00:41:14,540
He grew up.

700
00:41:14,541 --> 00:41:15,908
What did you expect?

701
00:41:15,909 --> 00:41:18,310
I'm tired of it, Don.

702
00:41:18,311 --> 00:41:21,781
I'm tired of trying to prove I
still have any value around here.

703
00:41:21,782 --> 00:41:23,749
I'm exhausted from
hanging onto the ledge

704
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:28,319
and having some kid's
foot on my fingertips.

705
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,321
Bombs away.

706
00:41:34,961 --> 00:41:37,095
Betty has cancer.

707
00:41:39,398 --> 00:41:42,333
Really?

708
00:41:42,334 --> 00:41:44,869
I don't know.

709
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:47,571
They're waiting on tests.

710
00:41:47,572 --> 00:41:49,907
Well, that would
solve everything.

711
00:41:52,777 --> 00:41:54,945
You want me to make a call?

712
00:41:56,715 --> 00:41:58,983
She probably knows already.

713
00:41:58,984 --> 00:42:01,484
I'm the one that has to call.

714
00:42:02,887 --> 00:42:04,821
She's a fighter.

715
00:42:04,822 --> 00:42:06,756
Come on.

716
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:14,263
I just imagine them
growing up without a mother.

717
00:42:14,264 --> 00:42:17,065
I never had one.

718
00:42:17,066 --> 00:42:20,335
Megan will try,
but what are they gonna do?

719
00:42:20,336 --> 00:42:23,672
How does that end up?

720
00:42:23,673 --> 00:42:26,041
Actual life and death.

721
00:42:26,042 --> 00:42:28,410
I've given up on that.

722
00:42:30,613 --> 00:42:33,147
I can't do that.

723
00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:44,792
When is everything
gonna get back to normal?

724
00:43:03,544 --> 00:43:06,078
- Henry Francis.
- Hi, Henry. It's Don.

725
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:08,881
Hello, Don.

726
00:43:08,882 --> 00:43:11,049
I, uh...

727
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:13,284
Wanted to know if there was

728
00:43:13,285 --> 00:43:17,488
any news about Betty.

729
00:43:17,489 --> 00:43:20,625
I didn't realize she--

730
00:43:20,626 --> 00:43:23,027
She's fine.
She's out of the woods.

731
00:43:26,798 --> 00:43:28,531
Well, that's great news.

732
00:43:28,532 --> 00:43:31,635
It is. You know, we're about
to put supper on the table.

733
00:43:31,636 --> 00:43:33,904
I'll let you go.

734
00:43:37,609 --> 00:43:40,677
<i>Who was it?</i>

735
00:43:40,678 --> 00:43:42,645
Nobody.

736
00:43:57,094 --> 00:43:58,994
Betty's fine.

737
00:43:58,995 --> 00:44:01,630
I'm glad to hear it.

738
00:44:01,631 --> 00:44:04,198
You're such an optimist.

739
00:44:04,199 --> 00:44:07,836
She just needs to have
something to call you about.

740
00:44:11,107 --> 00:44:12,841
Take you to dinner?

741
00:44:12,842 --> 00:44:14,708
Sure.

742
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:32,025
Pete Fox died.

743
00:44:32,026 --> 00:44:35,128
57 years old
for crying out loud.

744
00:44:35,129 --> 00:44:38,330
I don't know who that is, pop.

745
00:44:38,331 --> 00:44:40,432
Red Sox.

746
00:44:40,433 --> 00:44:43,469
Right field he played.

747
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:45,737
I got the job.

748
00:44:47,807 --> 00:44:49,708
You don't say.

749
00:44:52,478 --> 00:44:54,546
What do you want to eat?

750
00:44:59,218 --> 00:45:02,019
What do I want to eat?

751
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:04,055
You should get girls.

752
00:45:04,056 --> 00:45:06,157
An old one and a young one.

753
00:45:07,492 --> 00:45:10,194
I got rye bread
and some farmer cheese.

754
00:45:16,601 --> 00:45:18,702
Look at me.

755
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:21,738
What are you doing?

756
00:45:21,739 --> 00:45:23,873
Come on.

757
00:45:46,996 --> 00:45:48,530
Te don't you like it?

758
00:45:48,531 --> 00:45:50,497
It's good.

759
00:45:50,498 --> 00:45:53,234
Aren't you going to finish?

760
00:45:53,235 --> 00:45:55,436
I'm full.

761
00:45:56,605 --> 00:45:58,940
Can I watch TV?

762
00:45:58,941 --> 00:46:01,109
