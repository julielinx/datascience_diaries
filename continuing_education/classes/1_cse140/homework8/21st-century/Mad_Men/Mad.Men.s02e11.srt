1
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:49,948
"I lay on my pillow
at the Sherry-Netherland Hotel.

2
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,042
"Delicious and destroyed.

3
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:56,816
"Inhaling the fragrance of the sheets.

4
00:00:56,923 --> 00:01:01,053
"Feeling the warmth of where
you were just laying.

5
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:03,789
"You make me new with laughter.

6
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:06,263
"You make me old with wisdom.

7
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:09,758
You make wine taste sweeter."

8
00:01:11,337 --> 00:01:12,702
Who wrote that?

9
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,732
I write a lot of poetry when I'm inspired.

10
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:26,611
I guess I shouldn't be surprised
by anything you do.

11
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:28,118
You shouldn't.

12
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:31,055
It's insulting.

13
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:37,957
I have to keep you in line,
or I'll lose you.

14
00:01:38,064 --> 00:01:39,588
Yes, you will.

15
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:44,232
I don't like the idea of making you older.

16
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,798
I just meant...

17
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,177
I don't know.

18
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,747
It doesn't matter how old I am.

19
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:05,916
Our souls are the same age.

20
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:23,105
Oh, God.

21
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,507
You're getting to me.

22
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:37,420
How do I know I'm not just
going to eat another mushroom

23
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:41,756
and this room will disappear
and I'll be back on a train to Trenton?

24
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:44,694
Because I love you, Jane.

25
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,229
This is hard for you. I know it.

26
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:56,741
You don't want me to talk about it,

27
00:02:56,843 --> 00:03:02,179
but Margaret and Mona have been
your life for the last 40 years.

28
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:04,147
30.

29
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:09,747
Listen, I'm not being impulsive,

30
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:12,757
because I've been thinking
about this all the time.

31
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:17,158
I want you to be my wife.

32
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:19,198
What?

33
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,092
Marry me.

34
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,595
Roger, are you serious?

35
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,434
Will you do that for me?

36
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:45,516
90% of Right Guard users
say they play sports.

37
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,718
60% wear it for their girls as well.

38
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:51,888
Most impressive, 80% of the fellas
saying "yes" to the question:

39
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:54,762
"Does Right Guard make you
feel more confident at work?"

40
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:57,097
Did anyone watch Loretta Young last night?

41
00:03:57,203 --> 00:03:58,636
I was supposed to. What happened?

42
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:01,366
I can't even describe it, it was so awful.

43
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:05,911
Creative, think old Donnie Draper will mind
if we think better on a full stomach?

44
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:09,547
Well, if you'll all swear
Gillette dropped in.

45
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:11,344
Are you kidding?

46
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:13,043
Absolutely.

47
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:15,177
I'll pretend they're here if you give me
some actual ideas.

48
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:17,620
Right Guard already has
a great campaign...

49
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:18,884
men being men.

50
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:20,721
You know, women smell bad, too.

51
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:22,021
Not you, of course.

52
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:23,390
Women have perfume.

53
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:25,862
"Perfume does not fight wetness."

54
00:04:25,965 --> 00:04:28,729
Loretta Young.
She's my dad's favorite.

55
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:30,029
The aprons.

56
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:32,570
The nauseating upholstery on the couch.

57
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:34,503
Strangers who drop by.

58
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:35,596
Hear from Kinsey?

59
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,073
What do you mean?

60
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:38,700
Did you read what's going on down there?

61
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:40,369
In this day and age.

62
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,675
The papers said it's gonna be
Little Rock all over again.

63
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:45,307
I don't know why people
keep stirring up trouble.

64
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:46,612
It's bad for business.

65
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,981
Just another reason not to watch TV.

66
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:49,520
Kurt doesn't even have one.

67
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,249
You have to have one. It's your job.

68
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:52,551
You're gonna miss the playoff.

69
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,559
It's a different life for single men.

70
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:57,789
What do you do with your spare time?

71
00:04:57,897 --> 00:05:00,058
I like concerts. I like park.

72
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,963
He saw Bob Dylan at Carnegie Hall.

73
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:03,865
I heard him on the radio.

74
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,234
So we're not gonna work at all.

75
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:10,640
Tell Right Guard,
short of a new product just for women,

76
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:12,040
we need more research and time.

77
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,169
And lunch.

78
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:17,349
Can we split a lobster?

79
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:26,549
Does he sound like the album?

80
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:29,560
When you hear him, he plays it himself.

81
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,755
He must be something to see.

82
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:33,058
I'd love to go sometime.

83
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,497
So go.

84
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,999
Yes, I should.

85
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:37,592
You will go with me.

86
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:39,171
What?

87
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:41,570
You would go with me?

88
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:45,974
No. I don't want to impose
if you have plans.

89
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:50,345
When you hear him, you will smile like this.

90
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:53,882
Pick you up at 8.

91
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:55,613
I live in Brooklyn. It's a hike.

92
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:57,485
Neighbors.

93
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:00,923
Joey says that Duck's in the blind.

94
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,255
It's now or never.

95
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:26,575
This is why I booked a day early.

96
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:28,517
What did Ricardo in there say?

97
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:30,714
He's in hourly contact with TWA,

98
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:32,882
and they've offered
to buy you new luggage.

99
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:34,721
And fill it with my things?

100
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:38,194
Ricardo recommended a tailor. Chinese.

101
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:42,028
And he said they've got
a whole shop full of swim trunks.

102
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:44,000
I brought mine.

103
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:46,333
There's not gonna be any swimming.

104
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:49,340
The convention doesn't
start for another day.

105
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:50,500
You want to be the hundredth person

106
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,077
to shake someone's hand
at some convention?

107
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:53,736
For what, a free pen?

108
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:55,837
We'll follow up face to face.

109
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:58,109
Forget Santa Monica.

110
00:06:58,217 --> 00:07:00,276
Take your list,
target some of these guys,

111
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:02,047
and make them feel special.

112
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:04,214
Didn't Roger give you leads?

113
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:05,449
He did.

114
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:08,250
I'm gonna need sunglasses.

115
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:14,595
Come on.

116
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,190
You want to be on vacation, Pete?

117
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:17,894
Because I can make that happen.

118
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:09,952
Old-fashioned.

119
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:14,485
Excuse me.

120
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:18,490
My friends and I have
been speculating about you,

121
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:21,431
trying to decide who you are
and what you do.

122
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:22,967
Why?

123
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:24,866
Are you an actor?

124
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:26,063
No.

125
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,764
Are you an astronaut?

126
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:28,932
No.

127
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,975
Someone over there
would like to meet you...

128
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:32,908
a young woman...

129
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,537
only if you are none of these things.

130
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:42,716
I'm Viscount Monteforte d'Alsace.

131
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:44,517
- Willy.
- Don.

132
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:46,922
This is Don.

133
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,586
She's been staring at you all day.

134
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,959
Can't stop talking about you.

135
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:54,132
I'm Joy.

136
00:08:57,637 --> 00:09:00,333
And this is Rocci.

137
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:04,603
You look so comfortable
alone by the pool all day.

138
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,144
Made me wonder if you're
waiting for someone.

139
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:10,708
I am.

140
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:14,182
Do you smell that jasmine?

141
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:17,015
Dine with us.

142
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:20,553
Maybe another time.

143
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,128
That never happens.

144
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,526
Hello.

145
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,996
Pete, this is Joy and Rocci

146
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:29,033
and Viscount Monteforte.

147
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:30,363
Very good.

148
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:32,061
D'Alsace. Willy.

149
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:33,798
That's quite a name.

150
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,396
Peter Dykeman Campbell.

151
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:37,499
Have we met somewhere? Newport?

152
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:40,807
I have a terrible memory for faces.

153
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,141
Nice meeting you.

154
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,374
Yes.

155
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:44,710
A pleasure to meet you.

156
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:50,088
Look for us.

157
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:59,322
Everybody here is late for everything.

158
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:02,162
I just saw Tony Curtis in the men's room.

159
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,327
Handing out towels?

160
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,371
Tony Curtis, Don.

161
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:08,099
A thing like that.

162
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,269
Who's for dinner?

163
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:14,471
Rodney Barnes.

164
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,309
Classic salesman turned executive.

165
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:19,680
And this interesting scientist,
Caleb Sawyer.

166
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:22,185
He has this Optoman thesis.

167
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,949
In addition to rockets,

168
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:26,115
they're going to start engineering man...

169
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:27,988
you know, for travel in space.

170
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:31,359
New organs, super strength.

171
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,398
You know the Soviets are working on it.

172
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:35,763
Are all of our meetings like this?

173
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:38,393
It's American Aviation and Rocketdyne.

174
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:39,630
It's not a joke.

175
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,275
Can I get a drink here or what?

176
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,510
The Raphael was a little tired,

177
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:59,022
but the Fifth Arrondissement
has most of your good restaurants.

178
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,422
Of course, we kept getting lost,

179
00:11:00,526 --> 00:11:02,050
and every time Sherry asked for directions,

180
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,152
it turned out to be another American.

181
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:05,628
Well, there you go.

182
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:08,996
I'll take Jane to Paris,
and I'll send Mona to Reno.

183
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:10,534
You don't have to marry her, do you?

184
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:12,263
No.

185
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:15,966
Maybe you and Mona could work out
one of those modern arrangements.

186
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:17,474
George, stop.

187
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:21,103
It is possible that you'll get tired of her,
and then where will you be?

188
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:22,976
Mona doesn't have a right to anything...

189
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:24,982
not my company money,
not my family money.

190
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:27,109
She's lucky I'm giving her anything.

191
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:29,187
And you know what?
We've been miserable for years.

192
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:30,880
I don't want to die with that woman.

193
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,423
Calm down.

194
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:35,323
I didn't know that.

195
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:38,454
This is the life I was always meant to have.

196
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:41,523
Congratulations.

197
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:46,099
Mona has the marriage license,
and she wants to hurt you.

198
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,901
If you want to be with this 20-year-old girl,
you're going to have to buy it from her.

199
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:50,168
I have to warn you.

200
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:53,837
Women in this situation
become extra irrational.

201
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:55,413
Well, how badly
does she want to hurt me?

202
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:57,106
I have a list of conditions

203
00:11:57,216 --> 00:12:00,117
and an alimony that could
support Rita Hayworth.

204
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,619
Think of all the good things
in life and cut them in half.

205
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,782
I want you to push as hard
as you can, but I want it done.

206
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:08,121
Mr. Phillips is here.

207
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,660
In a minute.

208
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,695
I'll proceed.

209
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:15,995
But I want you to think about it.

210
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:20,038
Duck Phillips, this is George Rothman.

211
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:22,198
Actually, we know each other.

212
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,070
Roger.

213
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:26,735
It's good to see you, Duck.

214
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:43,359
Was he for you or against you?

215
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:44,929
He's supposed to be the best.

216
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,054
Him or Marvin Hughes.

217
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:48,065
That's who Mona has.

218
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:49,464
He's her cousin.

219
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,534
How bad was it? Do I want to know?

220
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:56,608
I don't think my circumstances
were the same as yours.

221
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:05,507
What can I do for you?

222
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,086
Actually, this might not be
the best time to talk about this.

223
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:10,018
Can't you tell I'd welcome
a change in subject?

224
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,919
Well, good, then.

225
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:14,984
What the hell, right?

226
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:20,761
Listen, we're coming up
on two years together here.

227
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:23,163
Did you get me something?

228
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:31,610
I think we're at a point in time
where I need to know what your plans are.

229
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:34,338
A partnership. I think I've earned it.

230
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:37,609
Right.

231
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:42,709
I'll bring it up at the next meeting
of the partners.

232
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,483
Thank you.

233
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:47,559
Of course you might have to come in
and be an advocate for yourself.

234
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,127
I'd be proud to present
my accomplishments.

235
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:51,492
Good. Because I'm at a loss.

236
00:13:52,798 --> 00:13:54,459
What is that supposed to mean?

237
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:57,434
You haven't exactly delivered
on that 30% you promised.

238
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:01,603
I think we've really performed
in a very dismal year.

239
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:03,732
These things are cyclical. You know that.

240
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,747
Is there some question
about my value to Sterling Cooper?

241
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:10,975
Just think about the board.

242
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,744
Bert Cooper hates everyone.

243
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,319
And his sister...

244
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,479
well, she does whatever he says.

245
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:19,285
Don, he's only 121/2%,

246
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:22,326
but I can't say he's
your biggest cheerleader.

247
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:23,827
What are you saying?

248
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:25,453
Everyone thinks you're a fine fellow.

249
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:30,024
But if I were you,
I'd go out there and make rain.

250
00:14:33,739 --> 00:14:36,037
Thank you for being so candid.

251
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:43,309
This year we have seen
an historic collaboration

252
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:44,848
in American aerospace.

253
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:47,214
Building on Lockheed's new Polaris A3,

254
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:48,809
Bell Aerosystems,

255
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:50,513
Aerojet General, and NASA

256
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,818
have developed a restartable rocket engine.

257
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:55,155
Can we get the lights, please?

258
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:00,095
We at Space Technology Laboratories

259
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:04,226
have set our minds
to the challenges of the future.

260
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:08,500
In July, Khrushchev said the Soviet Union
now has an anti-missile

261
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:11,075
that can hit a fly in outer space.

262
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:15,169
Space Technology Laboratories
is leading a coordinated effort

263
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:17,181
to create an invulnerable warhead...

264
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:19,581
multiple, independently targetable

265
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:21,676
reentry vehicles... M. I.R.V.s.

266
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:24,347
And North American Aviation's
vernier thruster

267
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:27,050
allows the primary missile
to correct its trajectory

268
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:31,357
before shooting off several warheads
hidden inside its nose cone.

269
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:33,431
The M. I.R.V. Can be launched

270
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:35,932
from a submarine or land
into the stratosphere.

271
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:40,835
Then it splits off
into 14 individual warheads.

272
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,465
That's 14 different targets.

273
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:46,602
14 different cities.

274
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:48,942
14 individual warheads,

275
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:51,448
each with ten times
the payload of Nagasaki.

276
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:55,714
Even if Khrushchev hits 35%,

277
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:58,051
that's 5 out of 14.

278
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:02,924
Secondary strike capabilities
will be extremely limited

279
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:07,328
due to the decrease
in infrastructure and population.

280
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:11,164
Total annihilation.

281
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:19,035
Do you realize that one
of these companies

282
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:22,170
spends more annually on media
than three Lucky Strikes?

283
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:24,181
It's a gold rush.

284
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:28,320
Where are the valets?

285
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,115
So much for cheap labor.

286
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:32,122
Go see if General Dynamics beat us here.

287
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:33,816
Drop these by the front desk.

288
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:35,917
You don't want them under your arm.

289
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:00,179
Hello.

290
00:17:00,285 --> 00:17:02,617
I think you're happy to see me.

291
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:09,018
Well, take a good look.
I have to be on my way.

292
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:10,356
Are you working?

293
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:12,828
Yes.

294
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:14,660
That's too bad.

295
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:16,496
I'm going to Palm Springs.

296
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:18,229
You should come with me.

297
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:21,399
I don't know about that.

298
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:27,204
Why would you deny yourself
something you want?

299
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:07,618
You want to get your things?

300
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:09,980
No.

301
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:21,223
Well.

302
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:22,698
Why don't we give it a few more minutes?

303
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:27,101
Enjoy the scenery, order some drinks.

304
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:29,674
I think Don needed to make a phone call.

305
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:44,186
Hello?

306
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:46,756
Just leave the bags there.

307
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:51,654
Who lives here?

308
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:55,062
Friends. They're in Sardinia.

309
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:56,930
I'm supposed to be in Edward's room.

310
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:12,448
That's Stephanie in the swimming pool.

311
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,246
And Willy and Rocci you've met.

312
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,292
And there's Greta and her friend Carlos.

313
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:23,918
I'm surprised to see them
in the same place.

314
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:27,895
Come with me.

315
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:34,833
Hello, Greta.

316
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,340
Hello, Joy, darling.

317
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:39,838
Who's this?

318
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:41,845
This is my friend Don.

319
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:44,313
I'm Carlos Villa Declan.

320
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,716
It's medicinal.

321
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:56,822
Good-bye, Carlos.

322
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:05,169
Come for a swim with me?

323
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:11,306
You can go inside
and ask for some trunks,

324
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:13,241
or you can go au naturel.

325
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:21,213
I think I should go inside.

326
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,948
You're white as a sheet.

327
00:20:25,757 --> 00:20:27,486
Don, are you okay?

328
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:51,909
Where am I?

329
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:54,349
You're with me, remember?

330
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:57,388
You have heat exhaustion.

331
00:20:57,489 --> 00:20:59,354
What are you doing?

332
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:00,857
It's fine. It's medicine.

333
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:02,551
Klaus is a doctor.

334
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:05,324
No, it's okay.

335
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,057
I just need some water and some aspirin.

336
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:10,890
Everybody out.

337
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:13,267
I thought you were going
to break your neck.

338
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:16,967
Next time you feel faint,
lean towards the pool.

339
00:21:17,075 --> 00:21:18,565
See you at dinner.

340
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:21,407
Little girl, don't get any ideas.

341
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:23,481
This man needs rest.

342
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:28,745
I found you some clothes upstairs.

343
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:36,452
Who are these people?

344
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:38,757
They're friends.

345
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:44,692
We're nomads together.

346
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,794
What are you all doing here?

347
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:50,068
There's an open door policy.

348
00:21:50,175 --> 00:21:51,870
You should rest up for dinner.

349
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,274
Have you ever had Mexican food?

350
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:54,675
No.

351
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:55,906
You're gonna like it.

352
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:57,641
Come out when you're ready.

353
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:19,694
You're spoiled.

354
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:21,397
This is great food. This is Mexican.

355
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,804
I don't like Mexican.
I want to do French again.

356
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:25,900
We're in Califor... Sweetheart.

357
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,308
Mexican does pig. I don't eat pig.

358
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:30,779
- I've already told you.
- Okay, well...

359
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:38,389
- He's here.
- Don.

360
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:45,729
Klaus, could you let Don sit here?

361
00:22:57,275 --> 00:22:58,503
Would you like some wine, Don?

362
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:00,510
Klaus, is that okay?

363
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:02,671
He looks healthy enough.

364
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:05,113
You must be hungry.

365
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:08,414
Everyone, to our guest.

366
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:12,350
To not being carried out in a box.

367
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,427
So, Don, what's your story?

368
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,062
I don't know how to answer that.

369
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:26,000
Where are you from?

370
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:28,933
New York.

371
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,166
Try this.

372
00:23:30,275 --> 00:23:32,038
It's a pepper filled with cheese.

373
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:33,202
Darling.

374
00:23:33,311 --> 00:23:34,505
And there's the sauce.

375
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,848
Joy and Willy think that you're a spy.

376
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:40,918
But your wallet fell out
when they carried you inside.

377
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:42,509
You're in advertising.

378
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:44,088
Or I'm a really good spy.

379
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:51,628
You'll never meet a group of people
more interested in professions,

380
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:55,166
and yet, there is not
one of us here who has one.

381
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,359
I'm a physician.

382
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:58,629
But you don't work.

383
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:01,397
So I assume you're all well off.

384
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,439
I should take something up.

385
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:10,947
I'm smarter than I've ever been in my life.

386
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:16,749
Not only do I know so much,
but my brain is more agile.

387
00:24:16,855 --> 00:24:18,288
I didn't know that was possible.

388
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:21,882
And my muscles are
remembering their skills.

389
00:24:21,993 --> 00:24:23,290
Are you an athlete, Don?

390
00:24:25,096 --> 00:24:26,290
I played some football in high school.

391
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:29,925
Willy was a champion fencer.

392
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:32,936
I made the Olympic team twice.

393
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:37,202
1948, London. 1952, Helsinki.

394
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:38,537
Foils.

395
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:41,339
It's hardly a sport.

396
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:48,615
Let's play places.

397
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,312
I'll start.

398
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:52,481
You have to name a place

399
00:24:52,591 --> 00:24:55,321
that starts with the last letter
of the place that's named.

400
00:24:57,963 --> 00:24:59,260
Kalambaka.

401
00:24:59,364 --> 00:25:00,763
Alaska.

402
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:02,663
It's not a city.

403
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:04,257
Amalfi.

404
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:05,802
Irún.

405
00:25:05,904 --> 00:25:07,064
Naples.

406
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,605
- Stockholm.
- Malagá.

407
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:11,267
Athens.

408
00:25:11,376 --> 00:25:12,673
Sarajevo.

409
00:25:12,777 --> 00:25:13,937
Oslo.

410
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:16,908
Wow.

411
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:18,107
"O" is impossible.

412
00:25:18,216 --> 00:25:19,410
Odessa.

413
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:22,578
- Orezzo.
- Osaka.

414
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:23,915
Oakland.

415
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,489
Dunkirk.

416
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:26,682
Kabul.

417
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:27,780
London.

418
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:29,326
- Nice.
- Essen.

419
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:30,325
Nairobi.

420
00:25:31,763 --> 00:25:33,424
Istanbul.

421
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:34,499
Lisbon.

422
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,591
Negril.

423
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:39,135
Lauzon.

424
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:05,690
How old are you?

425
00:26:05,797 --> 00:26:07,492
I'm 21.

426
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:09,157
How old are you?

427
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:11,827
I'm 36.

428
00:26:18,443 --> 00:26:20,570
You're still warm.

429
00:26:22,781 --> 00:26:25,272
Who are you?

430
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:27,715
I'm Joy.

431
00:27:19,504 --> 00:27:21,062
There's glazed.

432
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:24,732
Coconut, crullers.

433
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:28,145
Bismarks.

434
00:27:28,246 --> 00:27:29,440
Who brought these in, Cosgrove?

435
00:27:29,547 --> 00:27:32,345
I haven't seen contracts,
but this is certainly a good sign.

436
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:34,247
Gosh, Joan, thank him for me.

437
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,315
We're going to be getting
a delivery like this

438
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:39,049
every week, with all the varieties.

439
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:41,352
Lemonaires.

440
00:27:42,794 --> 00:27:44,022
Are these for us?

441
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:45,653
The spoils of victory.

442
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:47,322
8:00 in this evening.

443
00:27:47,432 --> 00:27:48,558
Excuse me?

444
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:49,964
Our destination.

445
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:51,330
Okay.

446
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:52,733
Where are you two going?

447
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:54,236
To the Bob Dylan.

448
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:56,068
Isn't that interesting?

449
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:58,267
Peggy and Kurt in the Village, oh, my.

450
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:01,573
Don't be shy.

451
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,171
I think you two are adorable.

452
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:07,651
What is with this?

453
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:09,652
You think Peggy and I?

454
00:28:09,754 --> 00:28:10,914
We do.

455
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,454
I'm homosexual.

456
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:18,920
I don't think that means
what you think it means.

457
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,520
Kurt.

458
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:24,466
No. I make love with the man,
not the woman.

459
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,368
What?

460
00:28:33,945 --> 00:28:35,810
8?

461
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:39,207
Of course. Absolutely.

462
00:28:53,264 --> 00:28:55,391
Enjoy the dancing beans.

463
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:58,232
Did you know about this?

464
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:02,066
He's from Europe. It's different there.

465
00:29:02,173 --> 00:29:03,470
More for me.

466
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,702
So Kurt is a pervert.

467
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:07,710
How about that?

468
00:29:07,812 --> 00:29:09,143
He certainly had me fooled.

469
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:12,182
Mr. Cosgrove, do you want me
to invite the girls in?

470
00:29:12,283 --> 00:29:14,114
I knew queers existed.

471
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:15,447
I just don't want to work with them.

472
00:29:15,553 --> 00:29:19,011
What, he's the first homo
you ever met in advertising?

473
00:29:22,727 --> 00:29:24,126
You think Smitty's in love?

474
00:29:25,396 --> 00:29:28,126
Which bathroom does he use?

475
00:29:28,233 --> 00:29:30,030
Joan, get the girls in here.

476
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:40,604
What are you reading?

477
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:43,545
William Faulkner.

478
00:29:46,484 --> 00:29:50,181
I took a survey of American literature.

479
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:51,721
So you're in school?

480
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:54,087
I was at Pembroke.

481
00:29:54,192 --> 00:29:58,595
Willy has a house in Rhode Island,
so it seemed convenient.

482
00:29:58,696 --> 00:30:00,323
Didn't fit.

483
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,328
Is it good?

484
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:04,731
Sex is good.

485
00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:06,736
This book is just okay.

486
00:30:08,606 --> 00:30:10,233
I like sex.

487
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:15,377
You do, too. I can tell.

488
00:30:23,454 --> 00:30:25,046
Greta and Carlos are arguing.

489
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:29,653
I knew they had problems.

490
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:31,388
Greta has.

491
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,054
Carlos never had any.

492
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,797
Good morning.

493
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:40,232
Good morning.

494
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:41,566
Do you hear them in there?

495
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:44,972
The humiliations have been spectacular.

496
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,642
Christian is coming with the children.

497
00:30:48,746 --> 00:30:50,714
I hope you don't mind.

498
00:30:50,815 --> 00:30:53,909
No matter how late I show up,
I'm never later than Christian.

499
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:59,581
Look at him.

500
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:03,058
You are so beautiful.

501
00:31:07,065 --> 00:31:08,555
You are a brat.

502
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:10,190
She has her mother's temperament.

503
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:12,292
That's why you love me.

504
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,533
I make beautiful babies, don't I?

505
00:31:19,277 --> 00:31:20,835
I'll see you outside.

506
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,482
That's your father?

507
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:29,845
He doesn't want people to think he's old.

508
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:37,456
Yes, it's Peter Campbell
from Sterling Cooper

509
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:38,893
for Clarence Hastings.

510
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:40,658
Is there any way we can meet here?

511
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:43,393
I can't drive, and there doesn't
seem to be a taxi

512
00:31:43,501 --> 00:31:45,366
that will take me to Pasadena.

513
00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:48,362
We can meet by the pool.

514
00:31:59,117 --> 00:32:01,915
Thank you. How are you two today?

515
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:11,388
Duck Phillips.

516
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:12,986
Saint John Powell, how are you?

517
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:14,724
Capital, capital.

518
00:32:14,832 --> 00:32:16,265
This is Alec Martin.

519
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:17,698
Duck Phillips.

520
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:23,196
By Jove, man, catch up.

521
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:25,936
I have a bit of a cold.

522
00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:27,511
Well, it's warm already.

523
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:28,840
It'll open up the passages.

524
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,710
It's warm, or he would have drunk it.

525
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:35,080
So, how are you finding New York?

526
00:32:35,186 --> 00:32:36,448
Brief.

527
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:39,045
We're going to visit
a candy plant for Cadbury.

528
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:40,647
Then it's fate that I caught you here.

529
00:32:40,758 --> 00:32:42,089
You say fate.

530
00:32:43,227 --> 00:32:44,888
I say another round.

531
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:46,927
Have mine.

532
00:32:52,036 --> 00:32:53,901
If you're not drinking, what's this about?

533
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:59,308
I keep thinking how I miss
doing things your way.

534
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,346
Two years ago, you said
you wanted to come here

535
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:05,711
and be with your children.

536
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,717
They're grown.

537
00:33:10,888 --> 00:33:13,652
It's not a good time.

538
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:15,453
I'm not going to take no for an answer.

539
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,494
I wouldn't expect you to.

540
00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:24,667
You know, if we were hiring,
you would be at the top of our list.

541
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,768
That's too bad.

542
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:31,171
I love you New York ad men.

543
00:33:36,714 --> 00:33:38,409
To our noble profession.

544
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:58,196
How old are your children?

545
00:33:58,302 --> 00:34:01,669
Alec's wife is about to have their first.

546
00:34:03,508 --> 00:34:06,102
Do you think that I have
nothing to offer you?

547
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:10,740
No, of course not.

548
00:34:10,848 --> 00:34:13,248
You represent
over 20 American companies,

549
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:15,251
doing business in Europe.

550
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:17,878
I know you want a U.S. Presence.

551
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:21,356
You're wasting your time doing things
like digging around here for Cadbury.

552
00:34:21,459 --> 00:34:23,518
And you could make a difference?

553
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:26,859
What if I were to bring you
every account at Sterling Cooper?

554
00:34:26,964 --> 00:34:28,932
Fully serviced and completely satisfied?

555
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:32,634
What are you talking about?

556
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:35,137
I'm suggesting that you buy Sterling Cooper.

557
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,672
There are very few client conflicts.

558
00:34:36,774 --> 00:34:39,504
All you have to do
is change the welcome mat.

559
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:41,202
I didn't know it was for sale.

560
00:34:41,312 --> 00:34:44,804
Roger Sterling has a 20-year-old fiancée,

561
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:48,374
and his wife's lawyer is not going
to leave him a pot to piss in.

562
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:55,917
Alec, would you excuse us?

563
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:13,236
Did he send you here with a price?

564
00:35:13,344 --> 00:35:15,744
Send me here?

565
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:18,441
51% will cost you
a lot less than you think,

566
00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:19,538
plus a finder's fee.

567
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:20,878
Two percent.

568
00:35:20,985 --> 00:35:23,180
I want to be in charge
of all international business,

569
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:24,754
and I have to be president.

570
00:35:24,856 --> 00:35:27,484
Creative reports to me,
or the whole thing falls apart.

571
00:35:34,999 --> 00:35:37,399
Thank you for thinking of us.

572
00:35:39,737 --> 00:35:41,295
To old friends.

573
00:35:46,043 --> 00:35:47,601
Hello.

574
00:35:47,712 --> 00:35:50,272
Did you have any trouble finding me?

575
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:51,609
Neighbors.

576
00:35:51,716 --> 00:35:52,808
Right.

577
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:55,884
Would you like some wine?

578
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,249
Very much.

579
00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:18,841
Listen, in the office,
I hope you weren't embarrassed.

580
00:36:18,943 --> 00:36:22,379
No. It's okay. It's good.

581
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:26,676
Well, if you have a man

582
00:36:26,784 --> 00:36:29,082
that you'd like to go
to the concert with tonight,

583
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:30,620
I completely understand.

584
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:34,657
Are you not on the trip tonight?

585
00:36:39,096 --> 00:36:42,190
I don't know why I pick the wrong boys.

586
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:45,192
You're drinking sad.

587
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,271
I don't know.

588
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:54,077
What's wrong with me?

589
00:36:56,781 --> 00:36:58,043
You are old style.

590
00:37:00,918 --> 00:37:02,385
No, I'm not.

591
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:06,988
This is not modern office,
a working woman.

592
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:10,019
What are you talking about?

593
00:37:10,127 --> 00:37:11,788
I fix you.

594
00:37:15,132 --> 00:37:16,690
We should leave.

595
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:21,227
Each time, Bob Dylan is late.

596
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:23,102
He will not miss us a half hour.

597
00:37:23,207 --> 00:37:24,299
Sit.

598
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,401
Look at me. I am very good.

599
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:31,806
Just a trim.

600
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,645
Yes.

601
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,662
For you.

602
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:51,700
Oh, my God.

603
00:37:51,802 --> 00:37:54,703
It's okay. It's good.

604
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:09,515
We're headed to Lyford Cay, Nassau.

605
00:38:11,689 --> 00:38:12,917
Why?

606
00:38:14,558 --> 00:38:16,924
It's what we do.

607
00:38:17,028 --> 00:38:19,826
Something about taxes.

608
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:21,727
It's very different than here.

609
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:26,967
I think you'd like it.

610
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:39,744
You'll need a tuxedo.

611
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:42,080
Will I?

612
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,479
You don't need a passport,

613
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:49,218
unless you want to follow us to Capri after.

614
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:52,160
Stephanie's uncle's an ambassador.

615
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:55,462
Joy.

616
00:38:57,468 --> 00:38:59,561
My father will take care of you.

617
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,501
He likes having you around.

618
00:39:01,605 --> 00:39:03,937
You're beautiful and you don't talk too much.

619
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:09,479
I'm not possessive.

620
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:12,983
You can be with anyone you want.

621
00:39:27,331 --> 00:39:29,094
Hello, Joy. Who is this?

622
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,327
Christian, this is Don.

623
00:39:31,435 --> 00:39:33,164
Bernard and Amelia.

624
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:34,999
Hello.

625
00:39:35,106 --> 00:39:36,664
Hello.

626
00:39:36,774 --> 00:39:38,173
Hello there.

627
00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:40,972
Did Isabel ring?

628
00:39:41,078 --> 00:39:42,670
Why would she?

629
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,873
Because I'm sick of her attorneys.

630
00:39:44,982 --> 00:39:47,473
These are my children.
They should be with me.

631
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:52,320
Are you in Edward's room?

632
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:55,055
You can have it.

633
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:56,251
Thank you.

634
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:59,761
As you can see, we're very tired.

635
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:07,203
Come, Bernard.

636
00:40:11,108 --> 00:40:12,541
You gave away our room?

637
00:40:15,446 --> 00:40:18,813
Looks like someone doesn't want to sleep.

638
00:40:57,721 --> 00:40:58,881
Come in.

639
00:41:00,691 --> 00:41:02,454
Joyce seems to have stepped away.

640
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:06,559
I'm sorry, but Mr. Crane
accidentally opened this.

641
00:41:06,664 --> 00:41:08,359
Thank you, Joan.

642
00:41:10,668 --> 00:41:13,000
My, oh, my. A case.

643
00:41:13,103 --> 00:41:14,900
They're all there. I checked.

644
00:41:15,005 --> 00:41:16,939
All the card says is that it's for you.

645
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:20,472
Well, thank you, Miss Holloway.

646
00:41:20,578 --> 00:41:22,045
Why don't you just take this?

647
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:24,046
As a finder's fee.

648
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:25,376
A whole bottle?

649
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:26,677
It's the good stuff.

650
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:28,752
I know. Thank you.

651
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:29,911
Anything else?

652
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,112
No, thank you.

653
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:47,069
The town of Oxford is an armed camp,

654
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:50,538
following riots that accompanied
the registration of the first Negro

655
00:41:50,641 --> 00:41:52,973
in the university's 118-year history.

656
00:41:53,077 --> 00:41:55,978
James H. Meredith was formally enrolled
in the University of Mississippi...

657
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,377
Hello, all.

658
00:41:57,481 --> 00:41:58,607
How the hell was California?

659
00:41:58,716 --> 00:42:00,741
Looks like Draper let you off the leash.

660
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:01,977
Did you see this?

661
00:42:02,086 --> 00:42:05,078
Yes, I did. Strange, isn't it?

662
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:06,884
Americans are free, in short,

663
00:42:06,991 --> 00:42:10,085
to disagree with the law,
but not to disobey it.

664
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:11,388
For any government of laws...

665
00:42:11,495 --> 00:42:12,553
So, how was it?

666
00:42:12,663 --> 00:42:14,756
Spectacular, business-wise,

667
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:17,527
but I don't know that I'd want to live there.

668
00:42:17,635 --> 00:42:19,432
Here. These are for everybody.

669
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:20,970
I'd like to see it for myself.

670
00:42:21,071 --> 00:42:22,504
What's wrong with it?

671
00:42:22,606 --> 00:42:24,540
The people.

672
00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:26,405
I don't know.

673
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:28,569
I'm glad to be home.

674
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:30,510
Has Don checked in? Is he here?

675
00:42:30,614 --> 00:42:32,411
No. I don't think so.

676
00:42:32,516 --> 00:42:34,347
...by force, or threat of force,

677
00:42:34,451 --> 00:42:36,715
could long deny the commands...

678
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:38,185
You look different.

679
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:40,018
It's my hair.

680
00:42:40,124 --> 00:42:41,785
Right.

681
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:43,359
Kurt's a homo.

682
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:45,985
...no judge would be sure of his...

683
00:42:58,142 --> 00:43:03,512
So... are you leaving us?

684
00:43:03,614 --> 00:43:04,842
No.

685
00:43:04,949 --> 00:43:06,814
So? What, then?

686
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:09,511
What if I told you that
the international divisions

687
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,247
of General Foods, Bird's Eye,

688
00:43:11,355 --> 00:43:13,289
Campbell's Soup, Chevron Oil,

689
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:14,823
Lever Brothers, Hoover,

690
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:16,552
Warner Brothers, Eastern Airlines,

691
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:20,391
and Chrysler can all be part
of Sterling Cooper?

692
00:43:20,497 --> 00:43:22,965
How is that possible?

693
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:25,627
Saint John Powell,
of Putnam, Powell & Lowe,

694
00:43:25,736 --> 00:43:27,033
called me the other day.

695
00:43:27,137 --> 00:43:30,538
They want to open up a New York office
to deal with their American clients.

696
00:43:30,641 --> 00:43:34,338
They love the idea of just sticking
a key in the door at Sterling Cooper.

697
00:43:36,013 --> 00:43:38,538
Really?

698
00:43:38,649 --> 00:43:40,241
Is this as solid as American Airlines?

699
00:43:40,351 --> 00:43:43,081
I guess you're happy having to scramble

700
00:43:43,187 --> 00:43:44,984
on the third tier of this industry,

701
00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:48,217
waiting for minor divisions
of major companies to drop in your lap.

702
00:43:49,827 --> 00:43:52,387
On the table will be mountains of money,

703
00:43:52,496 --> 00:43:55,488
international prestige,
a chance at going public,

704
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:57,066
and we don't have to change our name.

705
00:44:01,338 --> 00:44:02,737
I guess we could think about it.

706
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:06,401
No. I need to know that you're open to this.

707
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:09,741
If so, I'm giving them five business days
to try to impress us

708
00:44:09,847 --> 00:44:11,678
with a price for controlling
interest in the agency.

709
00:44:11,782 --> 00:44:13,249
There he is.

710
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:15,818
There's the man I heard so much about.

711
00:44:17,221 --> 00:44:18,518
Five days to make an offer.

712
00:44:18,622 --> 00:44:21,216
Or you can give me a price,
and I'll pass it on.

713
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:25,261
No. Let them open the kimono.

714
00:44:28,198 --> 00:44:31,167
Daddy, Daddy, over here!

715
00:44:31,268 --> 00:44:33,293
This water's cold.

716
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:38,233
Stop splashing.

717
00:45:20,818 --> 00:45:22,683
Hello. It's Dick Whitman.

718
00:45:26,523 --> 00:45:28,047
Yeah.

719
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:32,855
I'd love to see you.

720
00:45:32,963 --> 00:45:34,055
Soon.

721
00:45:35,466 --> 00:45:37,957
No. I didn't bring it with me.

722
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:39,194
Hold on.

723
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:54,181
I'll see you soon.
