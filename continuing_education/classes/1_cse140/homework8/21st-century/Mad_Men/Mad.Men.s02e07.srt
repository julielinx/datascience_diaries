1
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,025
Afraid you'll fall in love?

2
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:05,054
Something like that.

3
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:07,099
Well, I can see you have good taste.

4
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,565
This is the one.

5
00:01:08,668 --> 00:01:11,136
1962 Coupe de Ville.

6
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:13,068
Does everything but make breakfast.

7
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:14,765
What are you in now?

8
00:01:14,874 --> 00:01:16,774
I had a Dodge.

9
00:01:16,876 --> 00:01:20,073
Those are wonderful
if you want to get somewhere.

10
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,114
This is for when you've already arrived.

11
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:23,944
Is that right?

12
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:25,381
Of course, someone like you,

13
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:27,783
you don't need to see yourself in a Cadillac.

14
00:01:27,887 --> 00:01:29,718
You're walking about in one every day.

15
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:33,823
How'd you like your car to look like that?

16
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,392
Look at you.

17
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:38,464
I bet you'd be as comfortable in one of these

18
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:40,430
as you would in your own skin.

19
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:44,870
Wayne Kirkby. Do you have a card?

20
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,204
Sterling Cooper.

21
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,902
Did Roger Sterling send you?

22
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:53,842
Yes.

23
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,677
Let me go and get the keys, Mr. Draper.

24
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:19,595
Don't you want to hold onto these?

25
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:22,231
I don't know. The '49 rattled.

26
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:24,333
This is the 1950 model.

27
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:26,002
It's quite different under the hood.

28
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:27,306
Don't talk to me.

29
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:29,005
Talk to him. It's his money.

30
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:30,207
I'm just here to make sure

31
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:32,079
you don't shake his hand
and take his fingers.

32
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:37,746
Charlie, this car is two years old
with only 25,000 miles on it.

33
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:39,620
It's what you want.

34
00:02:42,028 --> 00:02:43,757
This must be Mrs. Wheatley.

35
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:46,289
No.

36
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,699
Why don't you sit in it again?

37
00:02:55,808 --> 00:02:57,275
You two talk.

38
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:00,610
May I help you, ma'am?

39
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,577
Are you Donald Draper?

40
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,674
Yes, I am.

41
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:08,447
If it's about my circular,
many of the models are gone,

42
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:11,319
but I'm sure we can find you something.

43
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:14,825
I'm not here to buy a car.

44
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:17,294
You're a hard man to find.

45
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:18,625
Excuse me?

46
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,727
You're not Don Draper.

47
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,762
Mr. Draper?

48
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,009
Everything okay?

49
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:31,440
Yes.

50
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:34,308
Let me take you for a ride.

51
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:35,506
No.

52
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:38,313
Thank you.

53
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:40,181
I don't hear that a lot.

54
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:42,049
Well.

55
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:43,486
Have a good day.

56
00:03:57,971 --> 00:03:59,336
Good afternoon, Miss Siegal.

57
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,532
Mr. Sterling.

58
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:03,199
Is your boss in?

59
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:05,277
No, but he will be.

60
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:07,073
Where'd you get that sweater?

61
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,546
I want to make sure
my daughter never buys it.

62
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:11,943
Klein's.

63
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:13,279
I doubt your daughter shops there.

64
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:16,082
Union Square, right?
Is that where you live?

65
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:18,714
I've told you, all you have to do
is look at my file.

66
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:20,588
That's cheating.

67
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:24,926
How was your lunch, Mr. Draper?

68
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:25,963
Good.

69
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:27,225
Mr. Sterling's here to see you.

70
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:29,958
Get Mr. Phillips.

71
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:32,867
Mr. Draper, Mrs. Barrett called again.

72
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:33,996
Did she leave a message?

73
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,096
No.

74
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:38,268
Shall I tell Mr. Phillips you returned?

75
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:40,209
Yes.

76
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:46,580
I'll bet she suffers in silence out there,
hoping you'll notice her.

77
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:49,951
I don't think she cries at night
from lack of attention.

78
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:51,717
Wait till she finds out about your Cadillac.

79
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:54,292
She'll be waiting naked
right in front of this window.

80
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:58,323
Now you're thinking about her.

81
00:04:58,431 --> 00:04:59,955
Didn't you go see Wayne?

82
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:03,533
I'm going to eliminate
your objections right away.

83
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,069
First of all, you can afford it.

84
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:08,664
Do you know how invigorating it is

85
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:12,438
to go in and write a check for $6,500
and not care?

86
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:14,137
Secondly,

87
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:16,579
not to get too deep
before the cocktail hour,

88
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:20,983
but do I need to remind you
of the finite nature of life?

89
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:23,716
Mr. Phillips.

90
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:26,356
Send him in.

91
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:28,154
Like the song says, enjoy yourself.

92
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:29,387
It's later than you think.

93
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:32,063
Martinson Coffee.

94
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,598
Martinson's.

95
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,758
They changed it.

96
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:36,061
Change it back.

97
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:39,229
Jim Van Dyke told the people at Grey
they're under review.

98
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,829
So Grey must be scrambling.

99
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,601
It's hard for them to do a lot of new work.

100
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:46,304
They just redesigned labels,
displays, and dropped the S,

101
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:48,505
but they have some kids
working on print and TV.

102
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:50,104
Are they better than our kids?

103
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:51,808
We'll find out.

104
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:53,180
Well, you're welcome.

105
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:54,776
I spent Saturday birding with that man,

106
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:56,582
and by birding I mean sitting on a stump

107
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,316
with a pair of binoculars, whispering.

108
00:05:58,424 --> 00:06:01,052
Did you see anything unusual?

109
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,788
A refrigerator floating in a pond.

110
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:07,058
Mr. Smith and Mr. Smith are here.

111
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:08,428
Just a minute.

112
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:09,899
Did you let them stay up late?

113
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:13,094
- I'd love to hear this.
- I don't know.

114
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,834
If I fill you full of any more
confidence, you'll burst.

115
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:23,073
You don't dance,
or you don't dance with me?

116
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:25,047
Leave her alone. Let's go.

117
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:26,618
Heard you're gonna knock 'em dead.

118
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:37,856
Look, Don, it's pretty clear
why we're here.

119
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:39,795
You want to know
how our generation feels.

120
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,833
Okay.

121
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:44,732
So, I get this letter
from my friend back in Michigan.

122
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:46,702
He's still in school, man,

123
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:48,330
and it's got this, I don't know,

124
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:49,772
60-page rant in it.

125
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:52,702
So dig it.

126
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:55,609
"We would replace power

127
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:58,650
"rooted in possession,
privilege, or circumstance

128
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,582
"by power and uniqueness

129
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:02,711
"rooted in love, reflectiveness,

130
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:05,017
reason, and creativity."

131
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:07,285
That's a beautiful sentiment.

132
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:09,054
Does your friend know
what you do for a living?

133
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:11,892
Yeah, there was a shitty note with it,

134
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:16,059
but this whole concept is deep.

135
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,734
"Students for a Democratic Society."

136
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:25,504
That's a hell of a focus group.

137
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:28,136
It's how our generation feels.

138
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:29,680
It is what it is.

139
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:34,911
It's idealistic.

140
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:36,215
That's nice.

141
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:38,153
Your generation wants to talk

142
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:41,124
about that newly designed can
and the premium beans,

143
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:43,354
but we don't want to be told
what we should do

144
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,657
or how we should act.

145
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:46,732
We just want to be.

146
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:50,769
You just want to be
selling Martinson's Coffee?

147
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,667
Just listen to this.

148
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,644
So, the thought is,

149
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:08,914
every maternity ward will get a visit
from a registered nurse

150
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:11,581
with a doll and a crate of Pampers,

151
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:14,888
and she will extol their virtues,
which are many.

152
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,484
What did Draper say?

153
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:17,824
He liked it,

154
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,455
but he said the same thing
he keeps saying.

155
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:22,557
I can't get them to lower the price.

156
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:25,728
Do you know the years of R&D
P&G put into this?

157
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:26,998
Besides, they're worth it.

158
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:29,404
No boiling, no diaper service,
no plastic pants.

159
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,773
And the greatest benefit of all,
you can throw them away.

160
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:32,902
10 cents apiece,

161
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,604
you kind of think you should reuse them.

162
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:38,110
Mr. Draper went over these ideas

163
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:40,151
and had thoughts he would
like you all to discuss.

164
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:45,620
Well, it's 5:00. Are we going out?

165
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:46,714
I don't know, sweetheart.

166
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:47,793
Maybe.

167
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:49,088
I'll take those papers.

168
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,389
Good night, Miss Olson.

169
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:53,431
Jane, would you mind
helping us clean this up?

170
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:57,266
I'm meeting with Cooper tomorrow.

171
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,634
He said he wants to see me and only me.

172
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:01,104
Isn't that from West Side Story?

173
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:04,205
You know he's going
to ask you about the picture.

174
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:05,777
What picture?

175
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:07,345
Some new painting.

176
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:09,846
He calls people in to see what they think.

177
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:14,181
No, I think we're going to discuss
expanding the television department.

178
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:16,312
I heard it cost $10,000.

179
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:18,049
How does everybody know about this?

180
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:19,852
Are you making it up?

181
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:22,621
Last year, Harry went up to the roof
looking for cosmonauts.

182
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:25,862
Has anyone seen it?

183
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:27,364
Dale.

184
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,835
It's abstract expressionist.

185
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:32,370
What the hell does that mean?

186
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:34,970
Thank you all for ruining this.

187
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,599
You're the one who walked
to the opposite end of the office

188
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,177
to tell us you had a meeting.

189
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:42,076
Well, if you're lucky,
you'll have a meeting.

190
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:44,911
And I'm not going to tell you anything
about the damn picture.

191
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:47,349
Why don't you just go look at it?

192
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,890
I'm sorry, Jane,

193
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:54,892
but you just don't walk
into his office like that.

194
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:56,222
But he's gone for the day.

195
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:57,887
That doesn't matter.

196
00:09:57,997 --> 00:10:00,295
Miss Blankenship won't mind.

197
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,864
I'm going to go up and see it.

198
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:10,775
I'll go anywhere you go.

199
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:25,686
Well, she's gone.

200
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,281
What are you doing?

201
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:29,954
It's open.

202
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:32,826
Are you suicidal? Let's go.

203
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:34,900
I can't believe you all.

204
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,369
Take off your shoes.

205
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:43,171
I feel like we're skinny dipping.

206
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:44,742
Call me from jail.

207
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,536
You're gonna keep a lookout?

208
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,914
Just don't touch anything.

209
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:00,287
It's a Rothko.

210
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:01,985
Why the hell didn't Dale say that?

211
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,291
$10,000.

212
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,367
So it's smudgy squares?

213
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,335
That's interesting.

214
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:15,633
Two possibilities...

215
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:17,368
either Cooper loves it,

216
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:19,637
and you have to love it,

217
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:23,408
like in an "Emperor's New Clothes" situation,

218
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:24,915
or he thinks it's a joke

219
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,076
and you'll look like a fool
if you pretend to dig it.

220
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:30,349
People like him pretend
they understand this.

221
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:33,948
Maybe he has a brochure in here,
something that explains it.

222
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,550
I don't think it's supposed to be explained.

223
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:37,492
I'm an artist, okay?

224
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:40,030
It must mean something.

225
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:41,656
Maybe it doesn't.

226
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:43,735
Maybe you're just supposed
to experience it.

227
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:47,636
Because when you look at it,
you do feel something, right?

228
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:52,709
It's like looking into something very deep.

229
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:56,471
You could fall in.

230
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,215
That's true.

231
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:02,310
Did someone tell you that?

232
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:03,854
How could someone tell you that?

233
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:05,548
This is pointless. Let's go.

234
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:06,886
I'm ready.

235
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:23,702
Harry actually took the stairs.

236
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:27,301
We could have stolen it, couldn't we?

237
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,506
Who are you?

238
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:32,140
I was thinking I could write
a great short story about this...

239
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,811
you know, "The Day We Looked
at the Painting."

240
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,478
I'm a writer.

241
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:39,916
I thought you were an accountant.

242
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:41,549
Accounts.

243
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,252
I've been published.

244
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:45,353
The Atlantic Monthly, Parabolas.

245
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:48,092
That's right.
The story about the maple tree.

246
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,498
It was beautiful and sad.

247
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,662
Really? You read it?

248
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:53,932
Everybody read it.

249
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:55,700
People were jealous.

250
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,604
Where are you headed?
Are you hungry?

251
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:01,202
No. Good night.

252
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:17,052
So you're still working here.

253
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:19,324
You missed something,
my yellow-bellied friend.

254
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:22,127
Jane Siegal is a genuine thrill.

255
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:23,360
Breaking and entering.

256
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,369
I don't care about Jane.

257
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,405
Tell me about Coop's painting.

258
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:29,804
What about Mr. Cooper's painting?

259
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,011
Enjoy that.

260
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:40,608
Can I get another coffee here, please?

261
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:44,122
I'll tell you what I heard.

262
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:45,986
You, Mr. Cosgrove, and Jane

263
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:48,082
were in Mr. Cooper's office
looking at his painting.

264
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:50,492
Anything you'd like to correct?

265
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:52,826
Mind your own business.

266
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,304
I had nothing to do with it.

267
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,768
Thank you.

268
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,070
Nothing happened.

269
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:15,612
Look, if Kurt says we don't need artwork,
we don't need artwork.

270
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:17,018
Is that what Kurt said?

271
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:18,316
Is that what you said?

272
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:20,654
Don has his signature.

273
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:22,954
It's nice down here.

274
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:23,994
Hey.

275
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:25,393
Kenneth.

276
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:28,728
3:00, and he doesn't talk in the meeting.

277
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:33,968
How about last night?

278
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:35,597
Quite an adventure.

279
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:40,805
Listen, I was thinking about
what you said about my story,

280
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:43,381
about it being sad and beautiful?

281
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:47,348
You're not like everyone else around here.

282
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:50,388
I don't know if that's true.

283
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:55,285
Okay. Here goes.

284
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,658
Would you mind taking a look at this?

285
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:01,789
Are you kidding?

286
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,801
I don't want you to pull any punches.

287
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,029
Unless you hate it,

288
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:07,367
in which case, don't tell me.

289
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:08,770
I'm kind of fragile.

290
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:11,576
I'd be honored.

291
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,372
Well, great, then.

292
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,243
Take your time.

293
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:18,373
Ken.

294
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:20,076
Yeah.

295
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:23,086
You know, I can probably
read it by Sunday,

296
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:24,621
and you can come over for dinner,

297
00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:26,054
you know, with Kitty and I.

298
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:28,923
I know you need a home-cooked meal.

299
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:30,359
You have plans?

300
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:32,555
No.

301
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:34,189
Are you sure it's okay?

302
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,291
You want me to give this back?

303
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:45,441
Young people do not drink coffee,

304
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:47,341
and that can become a lifetime habit.

305
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,539
Now, we're aware

306
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:52,617
that unsuccessful attempts
have been made...

307
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:54,345
puppets and so forth...

308
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:57,047
to capture the attention of youth.

309
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,351
That's why we're here.

310
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,086
There's an old saying.

311
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:04,890
When one is in Indian country,

312
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:08,364
one needs a man who knows Indians.

313
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:09,456
Mr. Smith?

314
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:14,361
So.

315
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,441
Where do we start?

316
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:17,566
Joe Martinson.

317
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:18,870
Old cup of Joe.

318
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,172
They named it after him, right?

319
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:24,307
That's just ancient history now.

320
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,646
There have been a million ways
that the folks on this avenue

321
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:28,913
have tried to tell our generation what to do.

322
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:31,387
Except we don't want to be told what to do.

323
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,457
That's over.

324
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:38,459
We want to find things for ourselves.

325
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:40,464
We want to feel.

326
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:43,265
Okay.

327
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:45,963
Martinson's is a great coffee.

328
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:49,268
It's delicious, and it's hot, and it's brown.

329
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,741
That's all you need to say.

330
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,540
We don't need more than that.

331
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:56,170
Peggy. Sweetheart?

332
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:27,540
I don't know if I understand this.

333
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:29,746
It's a jingle, right?

334
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:33,011
It's a song, and it's a mood,

335
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:34,346
and it's a feeling.

336
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:36,683
It's definitely more than a jingle.

337
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:39,188
What do you think?

338
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:41,650
It stays with you.

339
00:17:43,962 --> 00:17:46,123
What are the pictures that go with this?

340
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,199
If you sign, we'll tell you.

341
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,446
So Media Purchases.

342
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:07,007
Starting in March,
I'm looking at column 5,

343
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:09,713
under Regional Affiliates.

344
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:16,056
Mr. Crane, focus, please.

345
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:20,222
We didn't make you head of television
just to shorten your attention span.

346
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:21,424
I'm sorry, sir.

347
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:24,434
I was admiring your painting.

348
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:28,768
The eye is drawn to it.

349
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:32,075
It's very modern.

350
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:34,407
Mark Rothko. I've read about him.

351
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:35,980
And?

352
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:39,110
What do you think about it?

353
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:44,721
Nobody has ever asked me that.

354
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:50,619
Probably because it's none of their business.

355
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:52,819
Right.

356
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:57,225
How does it strike you?

357
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:02,205
Sir, I know nothing about art.

358
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:05,708
Mr. Crane, you're here because of numbers.

359
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:06,903
Stick to that.

360
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:10,175
Don't concern yourself with aesthetics.

361
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:12,807
You'll get a headache.

362
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:14,385
Of course.

363
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:23,723
People buy things
to realize their aspirations.

364
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,457
It's the foundation of our business.

365
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,627
But between you and me
and the lamppost,

366
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:35,298
that thing should double
in value by next Christmas.

367
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:41,007
Where were we?

368
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:44,173
Column 5 here...
Regional Newspaper Affiliates.

369
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,515
Your hair is turning green.

370
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:52,283
You have to wear the bathing cap.

371
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:54,052
It squeezes my head.

372
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:02,865
Don't leave your wet suit on the floor.

373
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:04,299
Draper residence.

374
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:06,598
Is this the belle of the Hudson River Valley?

375
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,969
Who is this?

376
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:11,008
It's Jimmy Barrett, sweetheart.

377
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:13,975
Mr. Barrett.

378
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:17,647
Are you looking for Don?

379
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:19,341
Because he's at the office.

380
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:22,677
I know exactly what I'm doing.

381
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:27,623
ABC picked up Grin and Barrett,
my TV show, 39 episodes.

382
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:31,184
That's wonderful. Congratulations.

383
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:33,161
We're having a shindig at the Stork Club.

384
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:34,459
Donnie didn't get back to me,

385
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,158
so I figured if you're anything like my wife,

386
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:37,496
you book the dance card.

387
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,765
Monday night,
so the celebrities can come.

388
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:42,430
That sounds like fun,

389
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:45,032
but celebrities make me shy.

390
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:46,576
Keep playing that, gorgeous.

391
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:48,202
It works wonders.

392
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:51,645
I'll talk to Don about it.

393
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,445
Don't you want to go?

394
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:56,043
You can't leave me alone
with those people.

395
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:58,384
Ride the horse in, like Lady Godiva.

396
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:02,357
I think I should hang up now.

397
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:03,689
Betty,

398
00:21:03,795 --> 00:21:07,424
it would mean a lot to me
if you were there.

399
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:11,468
We will try. Have a nice day, Jimmy.

400
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:18,641
Mr. Phillips.

401
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:23,712
Right now there's a little boy

402
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:25,339
running over here from Martinson Coffee

403
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,008
with a check in his hand.

404
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:30,384
It's done. Congratulations.

405
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:33,715
Thanks.

406
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:35,417
You want me to send
for something for you?

407
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:37,085
No, but don't let me
dampen your spirits.

408
00:21:37,195 --> 00:21:38,890
Unfurl the sails, please.

409
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:44,531
That was good advance work.

410
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,900
That's my job.

411
00:21:47,005 --> 00:21:49,030
Maybe we'll get a shot at LifeSavers.

412
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:54,302
Mr. Cooper wants to speak with you.

413
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:57,208
We'll be right there.

414
00:21:57,316 --> 00:22:00,285
He just asked for you, Mr. Draper.

415
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,456
Thanks again.

416
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:26,535
Congratulations, Don.

417
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:28,112
Sit with us.

418
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:31,549
Thank you.

419
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:33,413
But I didn't do it alone.

420
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:35,679
Fascinating.

421
00:22:35,787 --> 00:22:38,881
Jim Van Dyke of Martinson Coffee
was thoroughly impressed.

422
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,457
He's inviting you to join the board

423
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,891
of the Museum of Early American Folk Arts.

424
00:22:42,994 --> 00:22:44,484
That's nice.

425
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:45,722
What is it?

426
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:47,298
Doesn't exist yet.

427
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:50,027
But I've seen the opening exhibit.

428
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:52,194
Whirligigs.

429
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:54,329
Do they need a campaign?

430
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:57,931
No. Philanthropy is the gateway to power.

431
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:00,477
If you say so.

432
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:03,173
We need you to continue
your excellence in advertising,

433
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:05,943
but also to start treating this
like part of a bigger business,

434
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,450
which it is.

435
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,351
I will.

436
00:23:10,455 --> 00:23:13,015
Do you understand what this means?

437
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:19,353
You're going to be wearing
your tuxedo a lot more.

438
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:24,262
It's time for the horse to catch the carrot.

439
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:31,371
Roger, would you mind?

440
00:23:41,219 --> 00:23:45,849
Would you agree that I know
a little bit about you?

441
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:49,190
A little.

442
00:23:49,294 --> 00:23:55,426
There are few people who get to decide
what will happen in our world.

443
00:23:56,601 --> 00:24:00,093
You have been invited to join them.

444
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:05,268
Pull back the curtain
and take your seat.

445
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:15,776
You're back.

446
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:17,878
I had a feeling.

447
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:20,150
You want to take it for a drive?

448
00:24:21,593 --> 00:24:23,652
Wayne, I would like to buy this car.

449
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:30,865
Jane, would you come with me, please?

450
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:32,903
Is something wrong?

451
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:34,301
Just tell me.

452
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:36,397
You want to have this conversation here?

453
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:37,600
Fine.

454
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:41,975
You broke into Mr. Cooper's office
with some executives after hours.

455
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,446
That's not true.

456
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:47,985
I'm not in the habit
of making empty accusations.

457
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:52,390
They made me. I had no choice.

458
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:54,755
Please. They'll do anything you say.

459
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,259
You work for Mr. Draper.

460
00:24:58,129 --> 00:24:59,426
What's wrong with you?

461
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:01,465
With me?

462
00:25:01,566 --> 00:25:02,897
Yes.

463
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:05,834
Are you the only one who's allowed
to have fun around here?

464
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:07,063
What?

465
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:09,800
Please. I don't need a mother.

466
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:12,103
I'm 20 years old.

467
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,440
Collect your things.

468
00:25:14,546 --> 00:25:15,740
What?

469
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:18,111
Get your things.

470
00:25:18,216 --> 00:25:20,116
You can't be serious.

471
00:25:20,218 --> 00:25:23,381
You want to have this conversation again
in front of Mr. Draper?

472
00:25:23,488 --> 00:25:26,457
I'm going to the break room
to find your replacement.

473
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:29,925
See that you are gone
by the time I return.

474
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:40,866
Don!

475
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:43,801
You like it?

476
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:46,002
I don't know what to say.

477
00:25:46,111 --> 00:25:47,908
It's gorgeous.

478
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:53,015
Slide over.

479
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:03,686
It's like the cockpit of a jet.

480
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:07,087
What's this for?

481
00:26:07,198 --> 00:26:08,825
That is a headlight sensor.

482
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:12,665
It automatically dims the lights
as you approach another car.

483
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:16,033
And these seats.

484
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:18,701
It was expensive.

485
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:20,505
- Do you love it?
- I do.

486
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:23,547
Well, you deserve it. You work so hard.

487
00:26:23,648 --> 00:26:26,947
I can't wait to pull up
to the Stork Club in this.

488
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:28,953
Any time you want.

489
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:32,350
Monday night?

490
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:37,227
Jimmy Barrett's throwing
a party for his TV show.

491
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:38,990
He called for you.

492
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,325
He called here?

493
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,366
He should have gone
through my secretary.

494
00:26:43,868 --> 00:26:46,701
I think he likes talking to me.

495
00:26:51,242 --> 00:26:53,210
The kids won't be home for an hour.

496
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:55,541
Want to take her around the block?

497
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,610
Not in here.

498
00:27:21,873 --> 00:27:22,840
Mr. Sterling?

499
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:26,677
I'm sorry. Ginger stepped away.

500
00:27:28,346 --> 00:27:29,973
Well. Hello there.

501
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:34,609
I just wanted to say good-bye
and thank you for being so kind to me.

502
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:36,118
Good-bye?

503
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:39,987
I've been fired.

504
00:27:40,091 --> 00:27:42,958
Draper's a tough desk, honey.

505
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:45,825
Actually, it was Miss Holloway.

506
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,928
I can see someone wanting
to reprimand you seriously.

507
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:54,597
But firing? It's a little permanent.

508
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:57,668
Do you want a drink?

509
00:27:57,776 --> 00:27:59,801
Not like you work here anymore.

510
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:06,250
Would you like
to tell me what happened?

511
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:07,648
You don't need to bother with this.

512
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:08,844
I want to.

513
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:13,216
I'm just trying to do my job.

514
00:28:13,324 --> 00:28:16,259
Miss Holloway is...

515
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:19,262
Well, she's going through a rough time.

516
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:20,558
She's engaged, you know.

517
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:23,256
Tell you what.

518
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,199
You go home...

519
00:28:25,303 --> 00:28:26,531
Where do you live?

520
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:28,936
In the Village.

521
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,371
Jane Street.

522
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:31,908
Jane on Jane Street.

523
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:33,739
That's a pretty picture.

524
00:28:36,614 --> 00:28:39,082
Listen, you go home
to your little apartment on Jane Street.

525
00:28:39,184 --> 00:28:41,345
By the time you come back here
on Monday morning,

526
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:43,683
this will all be taken care of.

527
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:46,690
Are you sure?

528
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:48,258
No more tears.

529
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:51,722
I don't know what to say.

530
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:54,526
Thank you, Mr. Sterling.
Thank you so much.

531
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:55,599
Roger.

532
00:29:13,618 --> 00:29:15,552
That's my favorite tie.

533
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:18,019
He's late. I was expecting that.

534
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:19,385
He is a bachelor.

535
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:30,290
You could smell heaven in the street.

536
00:29:30,401 --> 00:29:32,869
I'd like to take credit,
but it's all the maestro.

537
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:34,632
These are beautiful.

538
00:29:34,739 --> 00:29:36,434
Don't forget to put
an aspirin in the bottom.

539
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:38,441
Keeps 'em fresh.

540
00:29:38,543 --> 00:29:40,704
I know that. I told you that.

541
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:42,404
Can I offer you a drink?

542
00:29:42,514 --> 00:29:44,505
Beer if you have it.

543
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:47,346
But wine with the spaghetti. Okay?

544
00:29:48,486 --> 00:29:51,512
Your place is... really wild.

545
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,784
Once we decided not
to look for a bigger place,

546
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:55,484
we just let ourselves go.

547
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:59,456
How did you two meet?

548
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:00,929
It's a boring story.

549
00:30:01,032 --> 00:30:02,158
No, it's not.

550
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:05,361
I grew up a block away from him
in Baltimore.

551
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:08,735
I guess I just always had
a crush on an older man.

552
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:12,974
As soon as I moved my mother up here,
Kitty came along.

553
00:30:13,077 --> 00:30:14,977
Come, come. Taste this sauce.

554
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:20,249
Now, tell me what you think,
and be honest.

555
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:21,978
I'm fragile.

556
00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:26,520
It's really good.

557
00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:27,750
It's better than a restaurant.

558
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:35,129
I don't want this hanging in the air.

559
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:37,292
- What are you talking about?
- My story.

560
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:39,694
I don't want to sit here
the whole meal worrying

561
00:30:39,804 --> 00:30:43,137
and then find out you didn't read it
or that you did and you didn't like it.

562
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:44,572
Are you kidding? I loved it.

563
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,610
- Loved what?
- His story.

564
00:30:46,711 --> 00:30:50,147
Yes. He wouldn't stop talking about it,
but he won't let me read it.

565
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:51,840
I didn't know how you felt.

566
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:54,612
I wonder if one day
they'll rent this apartment

567
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:57,153
by bragging about the fact
that you ate here once.

568
00:30:57,255 --> 00:30:59,723
I'm going to be eating here all the time.

569
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:04,617
To "The Gold Violin,"
by Kenneth Cosgrove.

570
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:13,794
You really liked it?

571
00:31:13,905 --> 00:31:16,465
I did. It was lovely.

572
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:19,634
I saw one at the Met.

573
00:31:20,945 --> 00:31:24,278
It's perfect in every way,
except it couldn't make music.

574
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:25,747
Oh, my.

575
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:28,011
Well, shall we?

576
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:47,500
Is Bobby in the car again?

577
00:31:47,605 --> 00:31:49,505
No. He's running around.

578
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:54,977
So I don't understand.

579
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:59,243
You'd rather play checkers
than my "look at the clouds" game.

580
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:01,318
I'd rather play with Silly Putty.

581
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:03,580
I don't want it jammed between my seats.

582
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:07,923
You know what, Sally?
Go play with Bobby.

583
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:13,459
We should do this more often.

584
00:32:13,564 --> 00:32:15,361
We should only do this.

585
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,662
I have to go pee-pee.

586
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:23,104
Go behind a tree there.
No one's looking.

587
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:29,746
I want to tinkle outside.

588
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:31,610
I don't know.

589
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:33,013
It's different for boys.

590
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:36,348
I think everybody should go
before we get in the car.

591
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:37,443
Do you have to go?

592
00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:38,522
No.

593
00:32:40,658 --> 00:32:42,057
You kids are lucky.

594
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,025
When I was a little boy,

595
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:46,562
back on the farm,

596
00:32:46,664 --> 00:32:49,633
we had an outhouse
way out in the yard.

597
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:51,929
And on nights
when there was no moon,

598
00:32:52,036 --> 00:32:53,025
there was this rope,

599
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:56,595
and you had to feel for it in the dark
and pull yourself across.

600
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:59,404
I'm glad we didn't live in the olden days.

601
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:05,539
Are we rich?

602
00:33:08,219 --> 00:33:11,017
It's not polite to talk about money.

603
00:33:11,122 --> 00:33:14,489
I did it!

604
00:33:15,526 --> 00:33:17,653
We should probably get going
if we don't want to hit traffic.

605
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:20,287
Sally, pack up the checkers.

606
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,711
Check their hands.

607
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:42,083
Okay.

608
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:25,954
You get the last of it.

609
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,395
Should I get another?

610
00:34:27,498 --> 00:34:29,193
You can have mine.

611
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:32,064
Harry tell you anything about his meeting?

612
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:33,569
Harry's meeting with who?

613
00:34:33,671 --> 00:34:35,138
Mr. Cooper.

614
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,797
He says he knows the answer now.

615
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:38,535
Well? What was it?

616
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:40,508
He says I wouldn't understand.

617
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:45,145
Where do you live, Ken?

618
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:46,580
Murray Hill.

619
00:34:46,684 --> 00:34:49,551
I can walk to the office, but I don't.

620
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:52,851
I wonder if you're gonna get a call.

621
00:34:52,957 --> 00:34:55,391
I'm pretty sure he's going
through the whole roster.

622
00:34:55,493 --> 00:34:58,462
Although, Cosgrove
comes before Crane, right?

623
00:34:58,563 --> 00:35:02,226
My cousin has an advertising agency
in Montreal.

624
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:03,994
He's not interested in that.

625
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:07,230
How the heck did you
end up in accounts?

626
00:35:07,338 --> 00:35:11,069
Me and a bunch of my college buddies
heard there was dough.

627
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:12,938
I was the only one who got a job.

628
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:14,841
What about writing?

629
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,436
That's just for fun.

630
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:19,510
It's your hobby.

631
00:35:29,393 --> 00:35:30,325
I should go.

632
00:35:30,428 --> 00:35:32,396
You can't.

633
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:51,908
Don't you want coffee?

634
00:35:53,017 --> 00:35:56,077
Would it be rude to say that I have
a long ride back to Manhattan?

635
00:35:56,187 --> 00:35:58,678
I can wrap up a piece of pie for you.

636
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:01,917
- It's pine nuts and pineapple.
- If I eat any more,

637
00:36:02,026 --> 00:36:03,857
I'll burst.

638
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:05,758
You two have been wonderful.

639
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,425
Thanks for reading the story.

640
00:36:11,736 --> 00:36:13,226
You can let her read it.

641
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:14,998
I can't wait.

642
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,045
I'll see you tomorrow, I guess.

643
00:36:34,926 --> 00:36:37,258
Do you want to have some pie?

644
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:40,194
No. I'm not hungry.

645
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:41,663
I'm just going to clean up.

646
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:44,792
Do you even care that I want dessert?

647
00:36:44,902 --> 00:36:47,837
Of course I do. I'll go get it.

648
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:49,429
I'll get it.

649
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,633
What's the matter, Kitty?

650
00:36:51,742 --> 00:36:53,073
I don't work where you do.

651
00:36:53,177 --> 00:36:54,906
I've met these people once.

652
00:36:55,012 --> 00:36:57,480
How am I supposed to talk about them?

653
00:36:57,582 --> 00:36:59,447
Come on, Kitty.

654
00:37:01,285 --> 00:37:03,583
Do you even see me here?

655
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:05,417
Well, of course I do.

656
00:37:05,523 --> 00:37:07,388
Well, you wouldn't know it, Salvatore.

657
00:37:08,926 --> 00:37:10,621
I'm sorry.

658
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:13,026
We were just talking about work.

659
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,167
You're right.

660
00:37:17,268 --> 00:37:18,860
It was rude.

661
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:22,428
I tried to include myself.

662
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:25,873
A lot of people find me
very interesting, you know?

663
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:32,773
I am so sorry, Kitty.

664
00:37:40,491 --> 00:37:41,924
It's okay.

665
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:46,590
I'll get you some pie.

666
00:37:46,697 --> 00:37:48,392
You put your feet up.

667
00:37:48,499 --> 00:37:50,023
I'll take care of the kitchen.

668
00:37:51,168 --> 00:37:52,362
Okay.

669
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:28,438
I have tickets for the Mets tonight.

670
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:30,871
Great seats for probably a terrible game.

671
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,067
I'll be by at 5.

672
00:38:32,176 --> 00:38:34,144
No, you won't,
and please don't lurk near my desk.

673
00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:35,576
I'm being watched.

674
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,704
Okay.

675
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:40,113
Well, have a good day.

676
00:38:44,522 --> 00:38:45,580
Good morning.

677
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:48,318
Morning.

678
00:38:48,426 --> 00:38:50,394
I was going to call Kitty today,

679
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:52,155
but I don't know what
it's like with Italian people

680
00:38:52,263 --> 00:38:53,525
if you call someone's wife.

681
00:38:53,631 --> 00:38:54,928
It's okay.

682
00:38:55,032 --> 00:38:56,829
Give her a call. She'd like that.

683
00:38:56,934 --> 00:39:00,335
Well, I just wanted to thank her...
both of you, really.

684
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:01,462
Every once in a while,

685
00:39:01,572 --> 00:39:03,335
you wish you weren't
a bachelor, you know?

686
00:39:04,575 --> 00:39:07,100
And your home is kind of
what I have in mind,

687
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:08,803
the way you two are.

688
00:39:08,913 --> 00:39:12,007
Well, we really enjoyed having you.

689
00:39:40,077 --> 00:39:43,672
What on God's green earth
are you doing here?

690
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:51,449
Did Mr. Sterling speak with you?

691
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:52,783
No.

692
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:57,490
What could he possibly have to do with this?

693
00:39:58,596 --> 00:40:01,997
I'll do whatever you want,
but he said that you do this a lot.

694
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:03,964
Do what?

695
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:06,059
Lose your temper.

696
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:08,934
That you're impetuous
and it's not serious.

697
00:40:14,345 --> 00:40:17,712
And what were you doing
talking to Mr. Sterling?

698
00:40:17,815 --> 00:40:20,113
I ran into him on my way out.

699
00:40:20,217 --> 00:40:22,117
Did you?

700
00:40:24,388 --> 00:40:26,822
Is there a problem?

701
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:29,017
No.

702
00:40:29,126 --> 00:40:31,720
There's no problem at all.

703
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:33,592
It's very clear.

704
00:41:04,261 --> 00:41:05,922
Everyone looks so glamorous.

705
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:09,363
Believe me,
they're saying that about you.

706
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,128
It's my earrings.

707
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:13,999
Do you remember? Bermuda?

708
00:41:14,104 --> 00:41:15,366
I do.

709
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,668
Here he is.

710
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:19,140
Don Draper.

711
00:41:19,243 --> 00:41:21,108
I heard you had something
to do with this.

712
00:41:21,212 --> 00:41:22,679
Very little.

713
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,407
Betty, this is Andrew Colhold with ABC.

714
00:41:24,515 --> 00:41:25,743
A pleasure to meet you.

715
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:26,942
And you.

716
00:41:27,051 --> 00:41:29,417
Isn't this a pleasant surprise?

717
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,852
Hello, Mrs. Draper.
You look stunning.

718
00:41:31,956 --> 00:41:33,048
Don.

719
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,715
Hello, Mrs. Barrett.

720
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:39,194
Don, did Andrew tell you my idea
for working a few items into the show?

721
00:41:39,296 --> 00:41:40,854
Not yet.

722
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:42,364
Why don't I get us some drinks?

723
00:41:42,466 --> 00:41:44,024
That's okay. Let me get them.

724
00:41:44,134 --> 00:41:45,260
I'll do it.

725
00:41:45,369 --> 00:41:48,736
No, it sounds like you three
have business to discuss.

726
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:53,142
For example,
a woman's parking her car,

727
00:41:53,244 --> 00:41:56,042
and then Jimmy runs out and says
she's run over his Rolex watch,

728
00:41:56,146 --> 00:41:58,706
so then we show the watch.

729
00:41:58,816 --> 00:42:01,649
Of course Jimmy will need
a Rolex, I suppose.

730
00:42:01,752 --> 00:42:05,848
I don't care, as long
as we bury Candid Camera.

731
00:42:13,998 --> 00:42:16,466
If you're trying to blend
into the wall, you can't.

732
00:42:18,502 --> 00:42:19,560
Hello, Jimmy.

733
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,035
Hello, gorgeous.

734
00:42:21,138 --> 00:42:22,867
What are you doing
standing here all alone?

735
00:42:22,973 --> 00:42:24,702
They're talking business.

736
00:42:24,808 --> 00:42:25,900
I fled.

737
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:32,641
I'd better not.

738
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,149
I've had too much already.

739
00:42:34,251 --> 00:42:36,185
I insist.

740
00:42:38,255 --> 00:42:40,655
The drunker you are,
the funnier I become.

741
00:42:42,192 --> 00:42:43,682
ABC did research.

742
00:42:46,196 --> 00:42:48,221
Come on.
Let's keep each other company.

743
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,797
I wish I was a mosquito right now.

744
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:58,772
I would never leave you alone.

745
00:42:58,876 --> 00:43:00,810
Come to think of it,
I never do, do I?

746
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:02,276
No, you don't.

747
00:43:02,379 --> 00:43:04,176
I'd want you on my arm.

748
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:11,248
Look at us, over here at the kids' table.

749
00:43:11,355 --> 00:43:12,754
What do you mean?

750
00:43:12,856 --> 00:43:14,881
Them. Your husband.

751
00:43:17,394 --> 00:43:21,023
I've been standing behind guys
like that my whole life.

752
00:43:21,131 --> 00:43:22,530
I was lucky I was funny.

753
00:43:22,633 --> 00:43:26,000
If I wasn't funny,
I would never have gotten to meet you.

754
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:27,934
- That's not true.
- It is.

755
00:43:28,038 --> 00:43:30,666
It's hard to believe
there's anything better than you.

756
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:33,402
Hard to believe he could do
any better than you.

757
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:34,909
Please stop.

758
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:40,209
What do you think happened
between the two of them?

759
00:43:41,518 --> 00:43:42,678
Excuse me?

760
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:45,186
Oh, come on. Look at them.

761
00:43:53,063 --> 00:43:55,293
I don't like what you're saying.

762
00:43:55,399 --> 00:43:57,367
All I know is I know her,
and you know him,

763
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:59,663
and there they are,
and they don't care where we are.

764
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:00,702
Stop it.

765
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:02,704
- Hold on.
- Let me go.

766
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:05,070
I don't like it any more than you do.

767
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:11,038
You people are ugly and crude.

768
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:14,807
What people? You mean comedians?

769
00:44:20,691 --> 00:44:22,625
...a very unusual emergency.

770
00:44:22,726 --> 00:44:24,717
You know what must really annoy him?

771
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:27,296
All the interruptions
when we're not at home...

772
00:44:27,398 --> 00:44:29,958
signing for deliveries,
answering the phone,

773
00:44:30,067 --> 00:44:31,694
turning on the oven.

774
00:44:31,802 --> 00:44:34,828
You know I never ask him
to do that sort of thing

775
00:44:34,938 --> 00:44:37,202
unless it's impossible
for me to be here.

776
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:39,376
How about that Thanksgiving

777
00:44:39,476 --> 00:44:41,376
when your car broke down
and Daddy had to leave his office

778
00:44:41,478 --> 00:44:42,911
every 15 minutes to baste?

779
00:44:46,283 --> 00:44:48,843
Your father never complains or anything.

780
00:44:48,952 --> 00:44:51,045
Well, no. Daddy wouldn't.

781
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:55,484
I guess he wouldn't.

782
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:00,394
Leaving so soon?

783
00:45:00,497 --> 00:45:01,759
We didn't get to talk.

784
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:03,560
Betty's not feeling well.

785
00:45:03,667 --> 00:45:04,998
Too bad.

786
00:45:05,102 --> 00:45:06,626
Here, let me get that.

787
00:45:06,737 --> 00:45:08,329
It's the least I can do.

788
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:15,845
Thanks to you,
I got everything I wanted.

789
00:45:17,147 --> 00:45:18,978
I don't know if that's possible, Jimmy.

790
00:45:19,083 --> 00:45:20,482
I got my relationship with Utz,

791
00:45:20,584 --> 00:45:23,678
my show, my money, 39 on the air.

792
00:45:23,787 --> 00:45:25,948
I'm gonna be an institution.

793
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:28,149
I'll tell everyone I know.

794
00:45:28,258 --> 00:45:30,522
You know what I like about you?
Nothing.

795
00:45:30,627 --> 00:45:32,356
But it's okay.

796
00:45:32,463 --> 00:45:34,294
You got me everything I wanted.

797
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:35,865
What did you get?

798
00:45:35,966 --> 00:45:37,524
Bobbie?

799
00:45:37,634 --> 00:45:39,431
Lots of people have had that.

800
00:45:39,536 --> 00:45:41,299
Excuse me?

801
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:43,805
Please. I laugh at you.

802
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:46,967
I go home at night, and I laugh at you.

803
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:50,046
I don't know what you think happened.

804
00:45:51,348 --> 00:45:54,875
You. You want to step out, fine.

805
00:45:54,985 --> 00:45:56,577
Go to a whore.

806
00:45:56,687 --> 00:45:59,087
You don't screw another man's wife.

807
00:45:59,189 --> 00:46:00,747
You're garbage.

808
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:03,525
And you know it.

809
00:46:06,029 --> 00:46:07,519
Well.

810
00:46:07,631 --> 00:46:09,098
Good night, you two.

811
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:11,292
It's been a gas.

812
00:47:45,596 --> 00:47:47,427
