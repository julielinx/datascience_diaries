1
00:00:00,097 --> 00:00:01,821
Previously on Mad Men...

2
00:00:01,945 --> 00:00:02,917
Are you leaving me?

3
00:00:03,046 --> 00:00:04,899
We're leaving each other,
just like you said.

4
00:00:05,213 --> 00:00:08,289
And who's that woman,
your other wife?

5
00:00:08,431 --> 00:00:12,008
I ended up married to her because
I ran away to join the army.

6
00:00:12,251 --> 00:00:15,508
You want me to work up an entire
corporate image campaign for 10 dollars?

7
00:00:15,632 --> 00:00:16,599
How much do you want?

8
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,048
How much you got?

9
00:00:18,641 --> 00:00:22,888
When a housewife has a rapid weight
gain the cause is usually psychological.

10
00:00:24,068 --> 00:00:25,697
This can never happen again.

11
00:00:26,266 --> 00:00:27,357
What?

12
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,111
No, of course. I...

13
00:00:55,909 --> 00:00:59,672
Sync and corrections by n17t01

14
00:01:44,577 --> 00:01:47,846
How is fishing competitive?
Man versus fish?

15
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,581
- No.
- Morning.

16
00:01:49,615 --> 00:01:52,250
Man versus man.
The weighing, the measuring.

17
00:01:52,285 --> 00:01:54,752
Got to respect anything
that rewards you for silence.

18
00:01:54,787 --> 00:01:56,921
Come on.

19
00:01:56,956 --> 00:01:58,889
Morning, all.

20
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,495
My mother always said
good news could wait.

21
00:02:04,529 --> 00:02:06,697
But I spent an hour and a
half on the phone last night

22
00:02:06,731 --> 00:02:09,633
with my new best friend
Victor at the New York Times.

23
00:02:09,667 --> 00:02:11,469
Gonna get a paper route?

24
00:02:11,503 --> 00:02:15,271
No, they're doing some literary
profile on hip agencies.

25
00:02:15,306 --> 00:02:18,641
- Hep. - After an hour of invading
the details of my life--

26
00:02:18,675 --> 00:02:20,243
You shouldn't start it
with the mayflower.

27
00:02:20,277 --> 00:02:22,712
Anyway, I told him
to get in touch with you.

28
00:02:22,746 --> 00:02:24,514
He wants to see
what we've been up to.

29
00:02:24,548 --> 00:02:26,116
I'll have Joan put it together.

30
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,917
And don't worry about
an interview.

31
00:02:27,951 --> 00:02:30,185
He seemed to be only
interested in talking to me.

32
00:02:31,421 --> 00:02:33,722
Sterling Campbell Draper
Pryce, may I help you?

33
00:02:47,969 --> 00:02:49,870
And this one.

34
00:02:49,905 --> 00:02:51,506
That'll do it.

35
00:02:58,647 --> 00:03:00,515
Peggy really got
buried with Heinz.

36
00:03:00,549 --> 00:03:02,783
Yes, they are mostly
Mr. Ginsberg.

37
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:06,954
Look at all the great work you've
done as creative director.

38
00:03:06,988 --> 00:03:08,989
Look at all these voices,
all this talent.

39
00:03:10,324 --> 00:03:12,259
You really should put
the letter in there.

40
00:03:12,293 --> 00:03:14,562
Should I?
That was a year ago.

41
00:03:14,596 --> 00:03:16,430
As far as the world knows,
it wasn't really an ad.

42
00:03:16,464 --> 00:03:18,398
It's something to talk about.

43
00:03:20,068 --> 00:03:21,734
We're still suffering for it.

44
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:24,604
Might as well get
something out of it.

45
00:03:24,638 --> 00:03:26,273
Leave 'em.

46
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:42,921
Look, JC, if you golf with me you're gonna
win every time. No, because I'm terrible.

47
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,193
Okay.

48
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,928
Get Max Rosenberg on the phone.

49
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:52,163
I thought your tailor
was Italian.

50
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:54,365
I met him at the Javits
fundraiser.

51
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,735
He's got a piece of business.
It's a Jewish wine.

52
00:03:57,769 --> 00:04:01,005
- Why not bring it up at new business?
- Why?

53
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:03,941
Don't you think we're capable
of doing this on our own?

54
00:04:03,976 --> 00:04:06,077
Mr. Campbell is very good
for our business,

55
00:04:06,111 --> 00:04:07,877
but this requires your finesse

56
00:04:07,912 --> 00:04:10,481
and, frankly,
your semitic wife.

57
00:04:10,515 --> 00:04:12,616
Bert, how do you not know
I'm getting a divorce?

58
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:15,319
Not Mona, Jane.

59
00:04:15,353 --> 00:04:17,554
Jane and I
are getting divorced.

60
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:19,590
Already?

61
00:04:21,993 --> 00:04:23,526
How Jewish are they?

62
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,562
You know, "Fiddler on the
roof," audience or cast?

63
00:04:26,597 --> 00:04:29,332
The company is Manischewitz.
Max will know.

64
00:04:38,174 --> 00:04:40,609
You can't blink.
Try to keep your eyes open

65
00:04:40,643 --> 00:04:42,377
so the sting
from the air comes in.

66
00:04:42,411 --> 00:04:44,912
Like this.

67
00:04:48,451 --> 00:04:50,785
Daddy, don't forget
the colored pencils.

68
00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:53,588
Whining is not gonna get you anything.

69
00:04:53,623 --> 00:04:57,224
I'm crying because I need them so
badly for my family tree project.

70
00:05:03,097 --> 00:05:05,166
- Dinner's at 7:00?
- You're gonna work all day?

71
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,201
It's 3:30.

72
00:05:10,138 --> 00:05:12,905
- <i>Bye, boys.</i>
- Bye-bye.

73
00:05:18,679 --> 00:05:20,280
How'd you do that?

74
00:05:20,314 --> 00:05:23,550
Just keep 'em wide open and think
about something that makes you sad.

75
00:06:31,714 --> 00:06:33,615
They're probably
tying their shoes.

76
00:06:33,649 --> 00:06:35,884
- That's what it always is.
- I can't sit here all day.

77
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:37,452
I thought you could
park anywhere.

78
00:06:37,486 --> 00:06:40,021
Betty, I'm not an ambulance.
We're double-parked.

79
00:06:40,056 --> 00:06:41,656
<i>What do you think</i>
<i>you're doing, pal?</i>

80
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:44,059
Okay. Jesus.

81
00:06:45,327 --> 00:06:47,027
Just go get 'em.
I'll circle.

82
00:07:07,248 --> 00:07:08,815
The doorman said
you were downstairs.

83
00:07:08,849 --> 00:07:11,184
- Where's Megan?
- I don't know. In the bathroom.

84
00:07:11,218 --> 00:07:13,319
Hurry up, get everybody.

85
00:07:13,353 --> 00:07:15,688
Bobby, Gene, mom's here.

86
00:07:15,722 --> 00:07:17,290
<i>Come on.</i>

87
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:07,703
Oh!

88
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:10,906
Uh, we were waiting.

89
00:08:10,941 --> 00:08:13,342
And they buzzed you.

90
00:08:13,376 --> 00:08:15,244
Henry's double-parked.

91
00:08:15,278 --> 00:08:17,446
I'm sorry.
I've lost track of the time.

92
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,581
Don's late.

93
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,318
This is quite an apartment.

94
00:08:22,352 --> 00:08:24,719
Thank you.

95
00:08:24,753 --> 00:08:27,588
I think you've seen most of it.

96
00:08:27,622 --> 00:08:30,658
<i>- Bobby, come on.</i>
- I'll go get them.

97
00:08:30,692 --> 00:08:33,094
Daddy was supposed to bring
the colored pencils.

98
00:08:33,128 --> 00:08:34,996
I'll buy you some.
Let's go.

99
00:08:37,867 --> 00:08:40,100
Okay, goodbye.

100
00:08:43,972 --> 00:08:45,672
<i>Bye.</i>

101
00:08:45,706 --> 00:08:47,374
This is irritating.

102
00:08:48,743 --> 00:08:50,978
I'll see you in two weeks.

103
00:08:51,012 --> 00:08:52,980
Goodbye.

104
00:09:00,388 --> 00:09:04,190
A trail of Sno Balls
leading to bigger sales.

105
00:09:06,026 --> 00:09:08,961
A frozen machine that
makes money for vendors.

106
00:09:08,996 --> 00:09:12,531
Now, if it's for
the customers, the kids,

107
00:09:12,565 --> 00:09:15,768
do they get to
work the machine?

108
00:09:15,802 --> 00:09:17,937
Find out.

109
00:09:17,971 --> 00:09:19,906
A snowman...

110
00:09:22,009 --> 00:09:24,210
On the beach.

111
00:09:43,729 --> 00:09:46,030
A Sno Ball's chance in hell.

112
00:09:47,532 --> 00:09:49,466
They don't melt.

113
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,436
They're refreshing
for the damned.

114
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:54,771
They're sinful.

115
00:09:54,806 --> 00:09:56,740
The Sno Ball is the sin

116
00:09:56,774 --> 00:09:59,343
that gets you into hell.

117
00:09:59,377 --> 00:10:02,478
They're sinfully delicious.

118
00:10:04,848 --> 00:10:07,116
Jesus, not bad.

119
00:10:10,254 --> 00:10:12,989
Just put gene to bed.
I'll be right up.

120
00:10:38,046 --> 00:10:41,014
Everyone loves the cartoons
in the New Yorker.

121
00:10:41,048 --> 00:10:43,116
And I thought we could
do that kind

122
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:47,153
with the guy crawling across
the Sahara dying of thirst--

123
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:50,991
The long beard,
the tattered shirt.

124
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,625
Only there's four guys

125
00:10:52,659 --> 00:10:55,160
and each one has
a thought bubble above him.

126
00:10:55,195 --> 00:10:58,097
"Water, water,

127
00:10:58,131 --> 00:11:01,100
water, Sno Ball."

128
00:11:01,134 --> 00:11:04,169
- What's the line?
- Doesn't need one.

129
00:11:04,204 --> 00:11:07,473
Well, if you want to stay
with the New Yorker thing,

130
00:11:07,507 --> 00:11:09,174
maybe some kind
of cryptic joke.

131
00:11:09,209 --> 00:11:12,643
- I already have the joke.
- Okay. Your turn.

132
00:11:12,677 --> 00:11:15,880
Ahem. As much as I hate
following another comedian,

133
00:11:15,914 --> 00:11:18,182
Sno Ball,
because it's for kids,

134
00:11:18,217 --> 00:11:20,151
demands a big, loud joke.

135
00:11:20,185 --> 00:11:22,620
"Hit me in the face with
a Sno Ball" is the tag.

136
00:11:22,654 --> 00:11:25,189
And the picture is someone getting
hit in the face with a snowball.

137
00:11:25,224 --> 00:11:28,958
Not the drink, an actual
round, white, messy snowball.

138
00:11:28,993 --> 00:11:31,495
And when I say someone,
I mean a cop,

139
00:11:31,529 --> 00:11:34,464
school teacher with glasses,
businessman, Indian chief.

140
00:11:34,499 --> 00:11:37,634
Anybody kids hate.
And maybe a pig.

141
00:11:37,668 --> 00:11:40,737
Why a pig?

142
00:11:40,771 --> 00:11:43,439
I don't know,
but everybody laughed.

143
00:11:43,473 --> 00:11:44,940
Great, so that's a way to go.

144
00:11:44,974 --> 00:11:46,708
I agree.

145
00:11:46,743 --> 00:11:49,078
Also, Sno Ball comes
with its own slogan

146
00:11:49,112 --> 00:11:50,579
because when you
think of a snowball,

147
00:11:50,613 --> 00:11:52,981
there's a 90% chance you think
of its chance in hell.

148
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:59,220
Oh, right.
That's true.

149
00:11:59,255 --> 00:12:01,789
So I picture this devil

150
00:12:01,823 --> 00:12:04,725
with a mischievous smile
on his face,

151
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:08,196
sipping a Sno Ball in front
of the flames of hell.

152
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:10,731
The cup is beading
with condensation.

153
00:12:10,766 --> 00:12:12,900
And in your head
you hear his voice,

154
00:12:12,935 --> 00:12:16,537
"Yes, even me."

155
00:12:18,673 --> 00:12:20,807
Wow.

156
00:12:20,841 --> 00:12:22,376
That's actually good.

157
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:24,678
I'm glad I could surprise you.

158
00:12:26,381 --> 00:12:28,682
No, it's just damn impressive

159
00:12:28,716 --> 00:12:31,650
you could not write for so
long and come back with that.

160
00:12:31,685 --> 00:12:34,420
- It's good to know.
- Thank you.

161
00:12:35,956 --> 00:12:37,923
- It's great.
- I'm working on the line.

162
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,193
I'll do the rest of it.
That's the easiest part to change.

163
00:12:40,227 --> 00:12:41,894
So let's run
with both of these.

164
00:13:00,449 --> 00:13:02,117
May I?

165
00:13:02,151 --> 00:13:05,020
Judy Steckler,
half-pound loss.

166
00:13:10,992 --> 00:13:13,794
That's so good.
We both had a good week.

167
00:13:13,829 --> 00:13:15,262
I don't know what happened.

168
00:13:15,297 --> 00:13:17,664
I just wasn't
that hungry this week.

169
00:13:19,767 --> 00:13:23,103
Oh, stop it.
You're here. You came.

170
00:13:27,275 --> 00:13:30,043
This meeting can start
to define what is a good week

171
00:13:30,077 --> 00:13:32,813
and a bad week in our lives.

172
00:13:32,847 --> 00:13:34,648
But there are good weeks
and bad weeks

173
00:13:34,682 --> 00:13:36,149
for thin people, too.

174
00:13:38,453 --> 00:13:41,655
Coming to weight watchers
is not just a chance

175
00:13:41,689 --> 00:13:43,356
to feel better about yourself.

176
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:46,225
It's a chance to share
so that if, for example,

177
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:48,794
you're someone like me,
you don't stuff yourself

178
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:51,930
just to keep from telling
your family your problems.

179
00:13:51,965 --> 00:13:53,766
How was your week, everybody?

180
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,637
Betty?

181
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:03,174
Uh, well,

182
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:05,744
I had a bad week out there

183
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:07,612
after having
a good week in here.

184
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:09,981
Could you stand up, sweetheart?

185
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:15,853
Uh...

186
00:14:17,288 --> 00:14:20,223
I, you know, had a...

187
00:14:21,993 --> 00:14:24,294
A very trying experience.

188
00:14:25,797 --> 00:14:28,665
I was in an unfamiliar place

189
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,801
and I saw--

190
00:14:30,835 --> 00:14:34,771
Felt a lot of things
I wish I hadn't.

191
00:14:36,139 --> 00:14:39,208
And I lost a half a pound.

192
00:14:39,242 --> 00:14:41,644
And I feel like I should
pat myself on the back

193
00:14:41,678 --> 00:14:44,013
because it was really hard.

194
00:14:45,582 --> 00:14:48,517
We always talk about
our goal in pounds,

195
00:14:48,551 --> 00:14:50,485
but that's not
all it is, is it?

196
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,821
Thank you, Betty.

197
00:14:52,855 --> 00:14:56,257
<i>Anyone else?</i>
<i>Katherine with a "K."</i>

198
00:14:56,292 --> 00:14:59,961
Burke Devlin will never be a stranger in
Collinsport. Just do what you're told.

199
00:14:59,995 --> 00:15:02,831
But the way he looks at Vicky--
I know what that means.

200
00:15:02,865 --> 00:15:04,598
Who was she to him,
Mr. Collins?

201
00:15:04,633 --> 00:15:06,500
I've heard her name
too many times.

202
00:15:06,535 --> 00:15:09,069
What could that miserable
schoolmarm offer him that I can't?

203
00:15:09,103 --> 00:15:10,838
I'll kill myself!
I will!

204
00:15:13,742 --> 00:15:15,709
Who the hell is this woman?

205
00:15:16,711 --> 00:15:18,278
She's a new character.

206
00:15:18,313 --> 00:15:20,212
She's a cook and she's in love.

207
00:15:20,247 --> 00:15:22,214
She's insane.
She needs a drink.

208
00:15:23,717 --> 00:15:25,151
They want you to be emotional.

209
00:15:25,185 --> 00:15:26,519
You haven't even seen the show.

210
00:15:26,554 --> 00:15:28,354
I've seen a soap opera.

211
00:15:28,388 --> 00:15:30,189
I don't think
I've seen one this bad.

212
00:15:30,223 --> 00:15:31,991
And isn't this supposed
to be scary?

213
00:15:32,025 --> 00:15:33,593
I didn't come
for an acting lesson,

214
00:15:33,627 --> 00:15:35,794
but thank you for
making me more nervous.

215
00:15:35,829 --> 00:15:38,464
Come on, we used to
laugh about this together.

216
00:15:38,498 --> 00:15:41,032
You'll go in and turn
that Chuck into Tenderloin.

217
00:15:41,067 --> 00:15:43,602
You know what?
It's just so easy for you

218
00:15:43,636 --> 00:15:45,571
from your throne
on 73rd and Park.

219
00:15:45,605 --> 00:15:48,440
Some of us act for a living and
we wait tables when we don't.

220
00:15:48,475 --> 00:15:51,509
- That's not fair.
- No, it isn't.

221
00:15:51,543 --> 00:15:53,410
What do you want me to say?

222
00:15:53,445 --> 00:15:55,980
That I'd kill for an audition
in this piece of crap?

223
00:15:56,014 --> 00:15:57,682
I would.
Are you happy?

224
00:16:02,187 --> 00:16:05,189
Look, I'm sorry.
I'm nervous.

225
00:16:05,223 --> 00:16:07,157
I haven't had a job in a while

226
00:16:07,192 --> 00:16:09,793
and you're lucky, that's all.

227
00:16:09,827 --> 00:16:11,995
I am.

228
00:16:13,664 --> 00:16:16,065
I've got to go.
I've got a shift.

229
00:16:25,475 --> 00:16:26,876
What should I bring
for Thanksgiving?

230
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:28,878
Something sweet.

231
00:16:35,685 --> 00:16:38,353
<i>Mr. Ginsberg is here to see you.</i>

232
00:16:40,155 --> 00:16:42,957
I like the connect the dots.
What's it end up being?

233
00:16:42,992 --> 00:16:45,092
Actually, it's reminiscent

234
00:16:45,127 --> 00:16:46,727
of certain experiences
for some people.

235
00:16:46,761 --> 00:16:48,261
Have a seat.

236
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:56,269
- Michael, can you keep a secret?
- Nope.

237
00:16:59,106 --> 00:17:03,208
I need you to do some work for
me on a prospective account.

238
00:17:03,243 --> 00:17:05,678
It will involve
a client dinner.

239
00:17:05,712 --> 00:17:08,480
And murder.

240
00:17:11,585 --> 00:17:13,285
You're not going to dinner.

241
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:15,287
What I need from you
is a couple of ideas

242
00:17:15,321 --> 00:17:17,289
for a company called
monarch wines.

243
00:17:17,323 --> 00:17:19,057
The brand is Manischewitz.

244
00:17:19,091 --> 00:17:21,225
- You assume that I'm Jewish.
- Stop talking.

245
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:23,628
They make wine for Jews.

246
00:17:23,663 --> 00:17:26,230
And now they're making one they
want to sell to normal people.

247
00:17:26,265 --> 00:17:28,299
You know what I mean--
People like me.

248
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:29,834
I think they're open
to anything,

249
00:17:29,869 --> 00:17:32,904
but it has to be cheap,
surprise, but impactful.

250
00:17:32,939 --> 00:17:35,839
Bring me a couple of
your best by sundown Friday.

251
00:17:35,874 --> 00:17:37,741
I have done a little research.

252
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:41,979
You know, I work
for the agency.

253
00:17:42,013 --> 00:17:45,916
And I don't know I want
to keep a secret from Don.

254
00:17:45,951 --> 00:17:48,786
You know Don--
Tall guy, short temper.

255
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:51,253
For the purposes of this
dinner these are my ideas.

256
00:17:51,288 --> 00:17:53,623
If it works out, Don will
obviously pick you for it

257
00:17:53,657 --> 00:17:56,492
- and you can come up with them
all over again. - Yeah, but why?

258
00:17:56,526 --> 00:17:59,361
Well, Michael,

259
00:17:59,396 --> 00:18:01,731
when a man hates another man

260
00:18:01,765 --> 00:18:03,700
very, very much,

261
00:18:03,734 --> 00:18:06,668
sometimes he wants to know
that something is his,

262
00:18:06,703 --> 00:18:09,104
even if in the end
he has to give it up.

263
00:18:09,138 --> 00:18:10,806
You really do hate Campbell.

264
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,374
I don't devote the energy
to hating people anymore.

265
00:18:13,409 --> 00:18:14,943
It's for Mr. Cooper.

266
00:18:14,978 --> 00:18:17,679
And what's for me?
It's a lot of work.

267
00:18:17,714 --> 00:18:19,447
My paying clients might suffer.

268
00:18:19,482 --> 00:18:22,417
Jesus, I am bankrolling
this entire outfit.

269
00:18:24,252 --> 00:18:27,154
Say 100 now
and 100 Monday morning.

270
00:18:27,188 --> 00:18:28,623
You wipe your ass
with 200 bucks.

271
00:18:28,657 --> 00:18:31,092
Here, take it.

272
00:18:31,126 --> 00:18:33,594
I've got to start
carrying less cash.

273
00:18:37,966 --> 00:18:39,866
What are you doing?

274
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,701
I'm sorry.

275
00:18:41,736 --> 00:18:44,004
I can't eat fish
five times a week.

276
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:48,808
I'm sorry.

277
00:18:48,843 --> 00:18:51,578
I don't want you
to go to bed hungry.

278
00:18:51,613 --> 00:18:53,514
I don't do it all the time.

279
00:18:53,548 --> 00:18:55,681
Go to sleep.

280
00:18:58,218 --> 00:18:59,785
You better take it out.

281
00:19:14,634 --> 00:19:17,435
Sit down.
This is nice.

282
00:19:21,207 --> 00:19:23,375
Don't know that it's nice
that I've driven you to this

283
00:19:23,409 --> 00:19:25,410
because I can't control myself.

284
00:19:25,444 --> 00:19:27,611
Sweetheart, it's got
nothing to do with you.

285
00:19:29,514 --> 00:19:31,081
Well, what is it?

286
00:19:31,115 --> 00:19:33,750
Nothing.

287
00:19:33,785 --> 00:19:36,119
I've just been
putting it together

288
00:19:36,154 --> 00:19:38,922
that this job is a dead end.

289
00:19:38,956 --> 00:19:41,358
Does Lindsay want someone
else for the campaign?

290
00:19:41,393 --> 00:19:43,093
Lindsay's not running.

291
00:19:43,127 --> 00:19:45,361
He keeps saying that,
but, you know.

292
00:19:45,396 --> 00:19:47,863
Betty, I'm the one
who keeps saying it.

293
00:19:47,898 --> 00:19:50,099
Turns out he's the one
who means it.

294
00:19:50,133 --> 00:19:53,303
He wants to wait until '72,
but now's the time.

295
00:19:53,337 --> 00:19:56,272
Once he's out, rocky will
get the nomination.

296
00:19:57,841 --> 00:20:00,175
Rocky can't run.
He's divorced.

297
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:03,078
Nobody cares anymore.
He just got reelected governor.

298
00:20:06,282 --> 00:20:08,584
I bet on the wrong
horse, Betty.

299
00:20:09,819 --> 00:20:12,721
I jumped ship for nothing.

300
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:18,626
This is a setback.

301
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:21,629
You're always thinking
about other people,

302
00:20:21,663 --> 00:20:24,365
and then you're angry because
no one's thinking about you.

303
00:20:24,399 --> 00:20:25,899
But I am.

304
00:20:28,169 --> 00:20:30,771
It's so easy to blame
our problems on others,

305
00:20:30,805 --> 00:20:34,006
but really we're
in charge of ourselves.

306
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:36,376
And I'm here to help you

307
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:38,345
as you're here to help me.

308
00:20:40,147 --> 00:20:42,949
We'll figure out what's next.

309
00:20:52,225 --> 00:20:53,692
What time is it?

310
00:20:53,727 --> 00:20:56,027
Midnight, I think.

311
00:20:57,497 --> 00:20:59,765
Can I count it as tomorrow?

312
00:21:00,933 --> 00:21:03,201
Okay.

313
00:21:03,236 --> 00:21:05,169
Now.

314
00:21:18,096 --> 00:21:19,662
Hello?

315
00:21:19,697 --> 00:21:22,532
- Hello.
- What do you want?

316
00:21:22,566 --> 00:21:24,001
I want to have dinner.

317
00:21:24,035 --> 00:21:25,768
Is that a good idea?

318
00:21:25,803 --> 00:21:28,838
You know what, Jane?
When we took LSD,

319
00:21:28,873 --> 00:21:32,009
you swore to me that you would
always be there for me.

320
00:21:32,043 --> 00:21:35,311
Stop telling me things
I said that night.

321
00:21:35,345 --> 00:21:37,946
Like I know I didn't promise
to remarry right away

322
00:21:37,981 --> 00:21:39,648
just to save you alimony.

323
00:21:39,682 --> 00:21:42,684
No, this is true.
And I have a very painless exercise,

324
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:45,187
which is taking some extremely
important clients to dinner

325
00:21:45,222 --> 00:21:47,023
and having you on my arm.

326
00:21:47,057 --> 00:21:51,393
Why don't you ask Joanie?
She's a professional something.

327
00:21:51,427 --> 00:21:53,395
Because they're dying
to meet you.

328
00:21:53,429 --> 00:21:56,097
You'd like them.
It's a dinner.

329
00:21:56,132 --> 00:21:58,299
I'll owe you.

330
00:22:00,136 --> 00:22:02,070
I want you to buy me
a new apartment.

331
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:06,106
What's wrong with
the one you're in?

332
00:22:07,175 --> 00:22:09,376
Your mother is my landlord.

333
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:12,779
And honestly,
it has a lot of memories

334
00:22:12,813 --> 00:22:14,814
and it's painful to be here.

335
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:18,052
And I feel like I can't
start a new life

336
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:19,486
until I start a new life.

337
00:22:19,521 --> 00:22:21,287
This is the most expensive
dinner in history.

338
00:22:21,321 --> 00:22:24,757
Really? Because I found
the perfect one.

339
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:26,825
Well, you're lucky
I called, then.

340
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:29,362
Fine.

341
00:22:29,396 --> 00:22:31,864
Have your lawyer tell my lawyer
what time dinner is.

342
00:22:31,898 --> 00:22:34,833
I don't know, I feel like one
of us should say thank you.

343
00:22:34,868 --> 00:22:36,902
Thank you.

344
00:22:46,645 --> 00:22:48,547
What are you doing here?

345
00:22:53,386 --> 00:22:54,919
You can't be here.

346
00:22:54,954 --> 00:22:58,122
I missed you.

347
00:22:58,156 --> 00:23:01,959
And I kept thinking about you.

348
00:23:06,631 --> 00:23:08,966
I thought you were
done with me.

349
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,001
I forgot you.

350
00:23:11,035 --> 00:23:14,572
And then I saw you in the
New York Times Sunday magazine.

351
00:23:31,955 --> 00:23:34,856
- Can I go watch TV?
- Did you finish everything?

352
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:36,625
Yeah.
You can check it.

353
00:23:36,659 --> 00:23:39,361
Yeah?
I just might do that.

354
00:23:41,564 --> 00:23:44,466
My God, are you still
working on the tree?

355
00:23:44,501 --> 00:23:46,435
All they care about
is the names.

356
00:23:46,469 --> 00:23:49,870
Well, I have questions.
Do Megan and Henry get branches?

357
00:23:49,904 --> 00:23:53,174
Of course. They get a branch off
of us because we're your parents.

358
00:23:54,309 --> 00:23:56,277
What is this mess?

359
00:23:58,147 --> 00:24:00,080
You carry this around
with you every day?

360
00:24:04,718 --> 00:24:06,620
This goes in your math folder.

361
00:24:08,289 --> 00:24:10,557
This goes in your spelling.

362
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:17,164
Is this what
you're doing in class?

363
00:24:17,198 --> 00:24:19,533
No, I made it at daddy's.

364
00:24:19,567 --> 00:24:21,667
Well, it's very nice,

365
00:24:21,701 --> 00:24:24,303
although I don't know
why he's smiling.

366
00:24:33,647 --> 00:24:35,314
<i>"Lovely Megan,</i>

367
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:37,248
<i>I went to buy a light bulb.</i>

368
00:24:37,283 --> 00:24:39,551
<i>When I get back,</i>
<i>I'll see you better.</i>

369
00:24:39,585 --> 00:24:41,052
<i>Love, Don."</i>

370
00:24:46,392 --> 00:24:47,825
Everything looks good.

371
00:24:47,859 --> 00:24:49,460
I'll take care of this.
You can go.

372
00:24:56,668 --> 00:24:59,236
You know what?
Don't forget your daddy's first wife.

373
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:02,673
You're right here.
Elizabeth Hofstadt Francis.

374
00:25:02,707 --> 00:25:05,942
No, your father had
another wife before me.

375
00:25:07,478 --> 00:25:08,944
He did?

376
00:25:10,581 --> 00:25:12,348
I'm surprised
he didn't tell you that.

377
00:25:13,383 --> 00:25:15,017
Megan helped me.

378
00:25:16,453 --> 00:25:18,254
Just put it down.
It's Anna Draper.

379
00:25:18,288 --> 00:25:20,789
She's a deceased.
And turn it in already.

380
00:25:20,824 --> 00:25:22,758
I don't want another
call from school.

381
00:25:24,027 --> 00:25:25,493
Who is she?

382
00:25:27,096 --> 00:25:29,464
I don't know why Megan didn't tell you.
Ask her.

383
00:25:30,833 --> 00:25:33,000
Oh. Okay.

384
00:25:38,608 --> 00:25:40,574
Hey, I've got an office
just across the ladies' room

385
00:25:40,609 --> 00:25:42,142
from the insurance
company next door.

386
00:25:42,176 --> 00:25:44,311
- At least you're over here.
- I'm the head of my department.

387
00:25:44,346 --> 00:25:46,714
And I've been working
very hard and doing very well

388
00:25:46,748 --> 00:25:49,350
and nothing has changed here.
It's a lot of empty promises.

389
00:25:49,384 --> 00:25:51,017
What were you promised?

390
00:25:51,052 --> 00:25:52,819
Hello.

391
00:25:52,854 --> 00:25:55,088
It's a mess in there.

392
00:26:00,327 --> 00:26:03,630
Both campaigns draw you in, but in different ways.
This one's a series.

393
00:26:03,664 --> 00:26:06,899
If Harry rolls it out right, you
wonder who's gonna get hit next.

394
00:26:06,933 --> 00:26:08,701
- That's great.
- And this one pulls you in

395
00:26:08,736 --> 00:26:11,304
<i>as you hear the evil voice</i>
<i>inside your head.</i>

396
00:26:11,338 --> 00:26:14,406
"This could
change everything."

397
00:26:15,642 --> 00:26:17,376
<i>I think the devil is clever.</i>

398
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:19,678
"Snowball's chance in hell"
and so forth.

399
00:26:19,712 --> 00:26:22,814
But I think the getting hit in the
face has a loud, juvenile quality

400
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:25,216
that makes a Sno Ball seem
more fun than a soft drink.

401
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:26,918
Also, they kept talking
about refreshing,

402
00:26:26,952 --> 00:26:28,786
and this one is literally
a slap in the face.

403
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,321
The devil could
be a series, too.

404
00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:32,222
We could see what he's up to
in different situations.

405
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,191
And it's got the heat that
Warren talked about for thirst.

406
00:26:34,225 --> 00:26:35,493
This one's funnier.

407
00:26:38,697 --> 00:26:40,798
Let's lead with that one
and take them both.

408
00:26:40,832 --> 00:26:43,967
- Great.
- Funny stuff. Really good work.

409
00:26:43,968 --> 00:26:45,735
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

410
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:47,370
I've got drinks.

411
00:26:47,405 --> 00:26:51,007
- Take these to full color.
- Absolutely.

412
00:26:51,041 --> 00:26:53,075
- What time is it?
- Bye, creative.

413
00:26:54,144 --> 00:26:56,746
"Look on my works,
ye mighty, and despair."

414
00:26:59,049 --> 00:27:01,850
You should read the rest
of that poem, you boob.

415
00:27:06,556 --> 00:27:08,424
Come on.
Here.

416
00:27:08,458 --> 00:27:10,225
Bye-bye.

417
00:27:10,259 --> 00:27:11,760
Sally?

418
00:27:13,363 --> 00:27:15,964
- Sally.
- Bye.

419
00:27:15,998 --> 00:27:18,032
Have fun.

420
00:27:20,235 --> 00:27:22,337
Come on.
Let's go.

421
00:27:31,213 --> 00:27:34,080
Do you want me to make you something?
You haven't eaten.

422
00:27:34,114 --> 00:27:36,717
I told you I don't
want anything.

423
00:27:36,751 --> 00:27:38,685
Why are you being
so nasty today?

424
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,986
Because you're a phony.

425
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:43,523
Hey, you don't talk
to me like that.

426
00:27:43,558 --> 00:27:46,693
- Who is Anna?
- What?

427
00:27:46,728 --> 00:27:49,161
You acted like
you were friends with me.

428
00:27:49,195 --> 00:27:51,330
But you really do
whatever he says.

429
00:27:51,365 --> 00:27:53,298
And guess what.

430
00:27:53,333 --> 00:27:56,134
You're not special.
And neither was Anna.

431
00:27:56,169 --> 00:27:58,136
Where did you hear that?

432
00:27:58,171 --> 00:28:00,038
You were my friend first.

433
00:28:00,073 --> 00:28:02,007
Who told you about her?

434
00:28:02,041 --> 00:28:03,876
Someone who doesn't lie.

435
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:06,745
Someone who didn't just pretend
to care about my school project.

436
00:28:06,779 --> 00:28:09,381
Sally, listen to me.
I wasn't lying.

437
00:28:09,415 --> 00:28:11,683
I just-- I didn't think
it was my place to say.

438
00:28:11,717 --> 00:28:13,050
Everybody knows.

439
00:28:13,085 --> 00:28:15,620
You're a little girl.
And it's complicated.

440
00:28:15,654 --> 00:28:19,190
Fine, just keep
digging yourself deeper.

441
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,762
I don't know what
your mother told you,

442
00:28:24,796 --> 00:28:27,631
but your father and Anna got
married to help each other.

443
00:28:27,665 --> 00:28:30,567
They never lived together
and they never had any babies.

444
00:28:30,602 --> 00:28:33,970
- Honest.
- So why did he marry her?

445
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,306
It was a long time ago.

446
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:41,043
And back then it was the only
way to help each other out.

447
00:28:41,077 --> 00:28:43,546
So why did he marry you?

448
00:28:46,717 --> 00:28:49,285
- Talk to your father.
- I don't want to.

449
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:51,888
And don't tell him I asked.
I mean it.

450
00:28:53,923 --> 00:28:56,124
Are you going
to make yourself cry?

451
00:28:57,493 --> 00:28:59,961
I am your friend, you know.

452
00:29:06,769 --> 00:29:10,103
Ooh, Judy Steckler--
May I?

453
00:29:10,138 --> 00:29:12,540
Lost a full pound.

454
00:29:12,574 --> 00:29:14,942
Good.

455
00:29:15,944 --> 00:29:18,145
What a nice way to end things.

456
00:29:20,381 --> 00:29:22,349
I don't know what happened.

457
00:29:22,383 --> 00:29:24,418
No, it's good.

458
00:29:24,452 --> 00:29:28,421
Betty, you know maintaining
is better than gaining.

459
00:29:28,456 --> 00:29:30,457
It wasn't even a full week.

460
00:29:30,491 --> 00:29:33,292
Now everyone deserves
a round of applause.

461
00:29:35,963 --> 00:29:37,931
You came on a Saturday.

462
00:29:37,965 --> 00:29:41,299
This is the best thing you can do with
the challenge of Thanksgiving ahead.

463
00:29:41,334 --> 00:29:42,968
And we know it's not
just the meal.

464
00:29:43,002 --> 00:29:44,470
It's the cooking, right?

465
00:29:44,504 --> 00:29:45,838
You have to taste everything.

466
00:29:47,474 --> 00:29:49,240
<i>We're supposed to be</i>
<i>thankful for this,</i>

467
00:29:49,275 --> 00:29:53,411
but the food is just a symbol
of all the other things.

468
00:29:53,446 --> 00:29:56,981
We should fill ourselves
with our children,

469
00:29:57,015 --> 00:29:59,484
<i>our homes, our husbands,</i>

470
00:29:59,518 --> 00:30:03,220
our health, our happiness.

471
00:30:03,254 --> 00:30:06,323
So who has a plan for how
they're gonna handle the day?

472
00:30:06,358 --> 00:30:08,893
<i>And the day before?</i>

473
00:30:08,927 --> 00:30:11,496
<i>And let's not forget</i>
<i>about leftovers.</i>

474
00:30:16,501 --> 00:30:18,067
Just wanted to make
sure she was asleep.

475
00:30:18,102 --> 00:30:19,769
What's going on with her?

476
00:30:21,739 --> 00:30:25,108
She asked me about Anna.
Betty obviously told her.

477
00:30:26,343 --> 00:30:28,144
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

478
00:30:28,178 --> 00:30:31,213
But I think I handled
the situation as best I could.

479
00:30:31,247 --> 00:30:32,815
Who the hell told you
to say anything?

480
00:30:32,849 --> 00:30:34,884
What are you doing?

481
00:30:34,918 --> 00:30:37,486
- Damn it, this has nothing to do
with you. - Keep your voice down.

482
00:30:37,521 --> 00:30:39,454
<i>I'm not gonna let her keep
getting away with this crap.</i>

483
00:30:39,489 --> 00:30:40,823
<i>You're just gonna</i>
<i>make it worse.</i>

484
00:30:40,857 --> 00:30:42,892
And let her keep sticking
her fat nose in my business?

485
00:30:42,926 --> 00:30:45,459
- Let it go. - Yeah, and what
am I supposed to say to Sally?

486
00:30:45,494 --> 00:30:47,695
<i>Nothing. I promised her</i>
<i>I wouldn't tell you.</i>

487
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:49,430
<i>Jesus, who's the child here?</i>

488
00:30:49,464 --> 00:30:51,766
Get your hand off the phone.

489
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,768
You think this is an accident?

490
00:30:53,802 --> 00:30:56,738
If you call her, you're giving
her exactly what she wanted--

491
00:30:56,772 --> 00:31:00,274
The thrill of having poisoned
us from 50 miles away.

492
00:31:20,127 --> 00:31:22,295
I'm sorry.

493
00:31:24,131 --> 00:31:26,166
I didn't know what else to do.

494
00:31:31,872 --> 00:31:33,838
I'm sorry about that.

495
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:45,016
Hey.

496
00:31:46,686 --> 00:31:48,387
I didn't think
anybody'd still be here.

497
00:31:48,421 --> 00:31:51,456
I'm gonna leave in a minute.
You come to steal something?

498
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:53,657
Nah, I'm doing
some work for Roger.

499
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,827
But I'm not supposed
to tell anybody.

500
00:31:59,898 --> 00:32:03,234
It's a wine.
He's trying to reel them in.

501
00:32:03,268 --> 00:32:05,668
Wants to look smart
at the meeting.

502
00:32:05,703 --> 00:32:08,771
- And he asked you?
- What can I say?

503
00:32:08,806 --> 00:32:10,940
I have gifts and I'm grateful.

504
00:32:10,975 --> 00:32:14,111
Well, just so you know, he's not going
to pay you if you tell everybody.

505
00:32:14,145 --> 00:32:16,513
He already did.
Maybe I'll throw some of it

506
00:32:16,547 --> 00:32:18,315
your way if you tell me
what you think.

507
00:32:18,349 --> 00:32:20,283
I don't care.

508
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:48,445
- Hello. - The article came out
and we're not mentioned.

509
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,915
- What?
- It's a bullshit piece on the usual assholes.

510
00:32:51,949 --> 00:32:54,084
He compares them
to philosophers.

511
00:32:54,118 --> 00:32:55,753
Hold on.

512
00:32:55,787 --> 00:32:57,454
Page 52.

513
00:33:04,929 --> 00:33:07,430
Hold on.
Hold on.

514
00:33:10,834 --> 00:33:13,068
<i>170 is the kicker.</i>

515
00:33:19,276 --> 00:33:21,076
Jesus, they look like
Peter, Paul and Mary.

516
00:33:21,111 --> 00:33:22,577
Why are they picking them?

517
00:33:22,612 --> 00:33:24,045
I don't know and I don't care.

518
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:25,447
Maybe that's the problem.

519
00:33:25,481 --> 00:33:27,449
You were the one who talked
to him for an hour.

520
00:33:27,483 --> 00:33:29,718
I thought he was your best friend.
You obviously made no impression.

521
00:33:29,752 --> 00:33:31,720
- He's a rat bastard.
- You know what?

522
00:33:31,754 --> 00:33:34,122
Don't wake me up and
throw your failures in my face.

523
00:33:34,156 --> 00:33:36,324
It's Sunday, for Christ's sake.

524
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,894
Sally, get back here.
Boys, back to your room.

525
00:33:43,064 --> 00:33:45,065
Get over here.

526
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:51,405
- Do you have something
you want to ask me? - No.

527
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,206
You do but you thought
it'd be better to ask Megan.

528
00:33:53,241 --> 00:33:55,141
She wasn't supposed
to say anything.

529
00:33:55,175 --> 00:33:56,609
And what was she supposed
to do exactly?

530
00:33:56,644 --> 00:33:59,446
Not lie again.

531
00:34:01,782 --> 00:34:04,250
Well, I'm sorry.

532
00:34:04,284 --> 00:34:05,718
I know it's my fault

533
00:34:05,753 --> 00:34:07,987
that you even have to think
about things like this.

534
00:34:08,021 --> 00:34:10,856
- You're a little girl.
- I'm not a little girl.

535
00:34:10,890 --> 00:34:13,759
Well, then you should realize that your
mother doesn't care about hurting you.

536
00:34:13,793 --> 00:34:15,226
She just wants to hurt us.

537
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:16,862
- Are you done?
- No.

538
00:34:20,066 --> 00:34:22,835
Anna and I were married
because of a law.

539
00:34:22,869 --> 00:34:25,804
It wasn't romantic.
She was a friend.

540
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:28,873
And I would have told you
all about her, but she died.

541
00:34:30,442 --> 00:34:33,344
Is she the woman whose house
we went to in California?

542
00:34:33,378 --> 00:34:35,045
The one who called you dick?

543
00:34:39,518 --> 00:34:41,886
Yes.

544
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:44,588
And I really wish
you'd met her.

545
00:34:48,593 --> 00:34:50,527
Now, you realize an adult

546
00:34:50,561 --> 00:34:53,262
would apologize to Megan even
if telling her was an accident.

547
00:34:53,297 --> 00:34:54,664
Okay.

548
00:34:54,699 --> 00:34:57,501
Go hang up the phone
in my room.

549
00:35:10,346 --> 00:35:12,615
Anything for me in there?

550
00:35:12,649 --> 00:35:14,782
Why don't you have
Ginsberg get your lunch?

551
00:35:17,586 --> 00:35:20,588
That Mohawk work I did
for you was great.

552
00:35:20,623 --> 00:35:23,691
And I kept it a secret, which is
more than I can say for Ginsberg.

553
00:35:23,726 --> 00:35:26,661
It's Manischewitz.
He was perfect for it.

554
00:35:26,695 --> 00:35:28,830
I'm sick of hearing
people think that way.

555
00:35:28,864 --> 00:35:31,398
I'm not an airplane either.

556
00:35:31,432 --> 00:35:32,900
I can write for anything.

557
00:35:32,934 --> 00:35:34,367
You know, in the old buildings,

558
00:35:34,402 --> 00:35:36,770
they used to have
an executive elevator.

559
00:35:36,804 --> 00:35:39,606
You are not loyal.

560
00:35:39,641 --> 00:35:41,575
You only think about yourself.

561
00:35:41,609 --> 00:35:43,243
Were we married?

562
00:35:43,277 --> 00:35:44,745
Because you're thinking
about yourself, too.

563
00:35:44,779 --> 00:35:47,279
That's the way it is.
It's every man for himself.

564
00:35:50,283 --> 00:35:52,051
Quaid's department
developed Sno Ball,

565
00:35:52,085 --> 00:35:53,686
and he will remind you.

566
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:56,556
We've got Bob Dennison, who
speaks for the local bottlers.

567
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:58,223
<i>We'll also have Michael Lloyd</i>
<i>and Warren Kent,</i>

568
00:35:58,258 --> 00:36:00,059
who deal with
the local retailers.

569
00:36:01,628 --> 00:36:03,995
- You want me to get those?
- I'm not taking two.

570
00:36:15,007 --> 00:36:16,775
Sally?

571
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:20,878
Sally, get in here right now.

572
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:27,885
That was Mrs. Engel.

573
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:30,921
Apparently you got an A+
on your family tree.

574
00:36:30,956 --> 00:36:33,256
She thinks you're really
turning things around.

575
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:34,958
It's just a drawing.

576
00:36:34,992 --> 00:36:36,593
Well, I'm very proud of you.

577
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:41,430
You should thank Megan
for her help.

578
00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:43,432
She helped you, didn't she?

579
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:44,934
I guess so.

580
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:46,736
She just told me
the same stuff you did.

581
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:48,605
Oh.

582
00:36:50,007 --> 00:36:51,573
Really?

583
00:36:51,608 --> 00:36:53,842
You asked her about Anna?

584
00:36:53,876 --> 00:36:56,211
Yes. Daddy showed
me pictures

585
00:36:56,245 --> 00:36:58,213
and they spoke
very fondly of her.

586
00:37:01,751 --> 00:37:03,719
I guess you've earned some TV.

587
00:37:14,763 --> 00:37:17,064
So I pulled over to
the side of the interstate

588
00:37:17,099 --> 00:37:19,667
and I let him out with
his luggage and everything.

589
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:22,637
He is not related to me.

590
00:37:22,671 --> 00:37:24,271
Siegel's a very common name.

591
00:37:24,305 --> 00:37:28,475
You wouldn't want to think everyone
named Rosenberg is related to you.

592
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:30,577
I didn't want to say it.

593
00:37:30,612 --> 00:37:32,712
Lord knows there's been plenty
of prejudice in this country.

594
00:37:32,747 --> 00:37:35,782
But growing up in Manhattan,
I've always envied the humor,

595
00:37:35,816 --> 00:37:38,552
the closeness, the way your
people keep track of each other.

596
00:37:38,586 --> 00:37:42,054
So you married
your way in, huh?

597
00:37:42,088 --> 00:37:44,023
I've always thought
Jewish women

598
00:37:44,057 --> 00:37:45,824
are the most beautiful
women in the world.

599
00:37:48,295 --> 00:37:50,429
Now that's a sales pitch.

600
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:54,066
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- This is my son Bernard.

601
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,501
We're still on drinks.
Roger Sterling, this is my wife Jane.

602
00:37:56,536 --> 00:37:59,171
- Bernie.
- Nice to meet you.

603
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:02,507
I'm sorry about that.
I took the boat out.

604
00:38:02,542 --> 00:38:04,476
- We got stuck.
- Really? What kind of boat?

605
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:07,312
No, you two can discuss
the details later.

606
00:38:07,346 --> 00:38:09,981
My dad doesn't like yachts
because last time he was on one,

607
00:38:10,015 --> 00:38:11,482
he rode steerage.

608
00:38:11,516 --> 00:38:12,883
And look where you are now.

609
00:38:12,917 --> 00:38:16,320
I've been trying to find out
what Roger thinks,

610
00:38:16,354 --> 00:38:17,854
but he wanted to wait for you.

611
00:38:17,889 --> 00:38:19,823
I wanted to wait for dessert,
make sure you liked me.

612
00:38:19,857 --> 00:38:21,825
What's not to like?

613
00:38:24,329 --> 00:38:27,230
As I understand it,
you're trying to get Manischewitz

614
00:38:27,264 --> 00:38:29,031
into the hands of different
kinds of people.

615
00:38:29,066 --> 00:38:32,802
So to us, it seemed
the key was, well, different kind

616
00:38:32,836 --> 00:38:36,038
if you ever look at the side of
a bus, it's a moving billboard.

617
00:38:36,073 --> 00:38:38,908
The passengers can't see the ad, but
everyone can see the passengers.

618
00:38:38,942 --> 00:38:43,378
The idea was to put a picture of the
bus seats on the side of the bus

619
00:38:43,413 --> 00:38:45,447
right below the window
where the real people are,

620
00:38:45,481 --> 00:38:47,449
show the bottom halves
of their bodies

621
00:38:47,483 --> 00:38:50,051
with a case of Manischewitz
under each of their seats.

622
00:38:51,687 --> 00:38:55,724
So it looks like whoever's riding
the bus has bought the wine.

623
00:38:55,758 --> 00:38:57,726
Isn't that clever?

624
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,460
So you thought that up, huh?

625
00:38:59,494 --> 00:39:02,764
Well, I engaged some
of our creatives ad hoc

626
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:04,665
in anticipation of this dinner.

627
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:07,367
I figured even if you didn't like it,
you could see what we were capable of.

628
00:39:07,401 --> 00:39:09,870
- I know it's good.
- Do we need menus?

629
00:39:09,904 --> 00:39:12,039
- I do.
- I'm getting the Chateaubriand

630
00:39:12,073 --> 00:39:14,074
if someone will
split it with me.

631
00:39:14,109 --> 00:39:16,076
I thought you liked
the crabs Rangoon here.

632
00:39:16,111 --> 00:39:17,811
I just had some.

633
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,914
So, Roger, what kind
of boat do you have?

634
00:39:29,223 --> 00:39:32,458
Am I the only one who can work
and drink at the same time?

635
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:35,394
- What happened?
- They laughed,

636
00:39:35,428 --> 00:39:37,063
they bought it
and we already celebrated.

637
00:39:37,097 --> 00:39:39,030
I'm only here because I've got
three hours left on the coast.

638
00:39:39,065 --> 00:39:41,867
- Hot damn!
- I knew it.

639
00:39:41,901 --> 00:39:43,969
Hold on.
We work our ass off

640
00:39:44,003 --> 00:39:47,072
and we don't even warrant a call?
Blow by blow, please.

641
00:39:47,106 --> 00:39:49,875
Don pitched the hell out of
it, they said it was clever.

642
00:39:49,909 --> 00:39:52,677
And apparently kids like devils
in cartoons as I predicted.

643
00:39:54,712 --> 00:39:56,280
Oh, really?
They didn't like the other one?

644
00:39:56,314 --> 00:39:57,748
I don't know.
He left it in the cab.

645
00:39:57,783 --> 00:40:00,284
Are you kidding me?
They never even heard it?

646
00:40:00,318 --> 00:40:02,787
We made a sale.
Anything else?

647
00:40:09,227 --> 00:40:11,161
I'm going to order some dinner.

648
00:40:11,195 --> 00:40:13,963
Sure. He's gonna
be useless tonight.

649
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:21,635
So, you suddenly have no problem
telling people I'm Jewish?

650
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:23,670
You going to meet Bernie?

651
00:40:23,704 --> 00:40:26,406
What?
No.

652
00:40:26,441 --> 00:40:29,676
So you're not gonna call him in two
days and tell him we're separated?

653
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:32,211
You had your chance
to say who I sleep with.

654
00:40:32,246 --> 00:40:34,213
Well, you're supposed
to help me land this.

655
00:40:34,248 --> 00:40:36,450
So if something goes on
between the two of you,

656
00:40:36,484 --> 00:40:38,383
you'd better pretend
you're still married.

657
00:40:38,418 --> 00:40:40,986
I promise, bubala.

658
00:40:42,823 --> 00:40:44,723
I'm sorry.

659
00:40:46,493 --> 00:40:49,562
The least you can do is show me what the
better end of this deal looks like.

660
00:40:49,596 --> 00:40:52,230
- What do you mean?
- The apartment.

661
00:40:52,265 --> 00:40:54,265
Show it to me.

662
00:40:54,299 --> 00:40:56,233
When else am I
gonna get a chance?

663
00:40:56,268 --> 00:40:59,136
I'm not moved in.
I just got the key.

664
00:41:11,549 --> 00:41:13,750
Has a lot of potential.

665
00:41:14,986 --> 00:41:16,987
You think so?

666
00:41:20,024 --> 00:41:22,025
I have missed you.

667
00:41:47,984 --> 00:41:49,751
Roger, wait.

668
00:41:51,854 --> 00:41:53,788
What?

669
00:42:08,703 --> 00:42:11,238
I'm surprised
you're working today.

670
00:42:11,272 --> 00:42:13,840
We roll out all
our business this week.

671
00:42:13,874 --> 00:42:17,343
Well, I'm just gonna spend as
much time as I can with my girl

672
00:42:17,377 --> 00:42:19,879
before I'm trapped with
my family over the holiday.

673
00:42:19,914 --> 00:42:22,048
You know what, Howard?

674
00:42:22,082 --> 00:42:24,083
Why don't you spend
Thanksgiving with her,

675
00:42:24,117 --> 00:42:27,119
and I'll go to your house
and screw your wife?

676
00:42:28,556 --> 00:42:30,689
Are you kidding me?

677
00:42:30,723 --> 00:42:32,624
Good luck with that.

678
00:42:34,894 --> 00:42:37,462
But I guess the grass
is always greener, right?

679
00:42:46,705 --> 00:42:48,505
I know you saw me.

680
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:50,007
I thought you were
hiding from someone.

681
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:55,145
That was a bold
last-minute decision

682
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:56,747
going with your idea.

683
00:42:56,782 --> 00:42:58,515
I thought it was more
what they wanted.

684
00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:00,384
Well, we'll never know,
will we?

685
00:43:00,418 --> 00:43:01,985
Because they never heard mine.

686
00:43:02,019 --> 00:43:05,555
Look, I don't like going in
with two ideas. It's weak.

687
00:43:05,590 --> 00:43:07,691
And you don't wanna be weak,
so you picked yours.

688
00:43:07,725 --> 00:43:10,794
And they bought it,
which is our goal, isn't it?

689
00:43:10,828 --> 00:43:13,129
What do I care?

690
00:43:13,163 --> 00:43:15,131
I got a million of 'em.

691
00:43:15,165 --> 00:43:17,266
- A million.
- Good.

692
00:43:17,301 --> 00:43:19,468
I guess I'm lucky you work for me.

693
00:43:21,404 --> 00:43:23,072
I feel bad for you.

694
00:43:23,106 --> 00:43:25,140
I don't think about you at all.

695
00:43:31,314 --> 00:43:33,381
- Morning, Mr. Draper.
- Morning.

696
00:43:41,724 --> 00:43:44,892
I used the toothbrush in there.
I hope it's yours.

697
00:43:44,927 --> 00:43:47,328
Why did you do that?

698
00:43:47,362 --> 00:43:49,663
Jesus, it doesn't belong
to the dead guy, does it?

699
00:43:49,697 --> 00:43:51,297
It's pink.

700
00:43:51,332 --> 00:43:55,002
I told you why I wanted this
apartment and you ignored me.

701
00:43:56,638 --> 00:43:58,238
I hardly ignored you.

702
00:43:59,607 --> 00:44:02,676
Now this is no different
than the last place.

703
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:04,778
Really?
I think it's nicer.

704
00:44:04,812 --> 00:44:06,578
Not anymore.

705
00:44:08,615 --> 00:44:10,650
You ruined this.

706
00:44:19,225 --> 00:44:21,527
Shit.

707
00:44:21,561 --> 00:44:23,895
You get everything you want

708
00:44:23,929 --> 00:44:26,798
and you still had to do this.

709
00:44:28,567 --> 00:44:30,702
You're right.

710
00:44:33,706 --> 00:44:36,041
I don't know why I did that.

711
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:39,843
I feel terrible.

712
00:45:09,172 --> 00:45:11,173
Smells good.

713
00:45:12,709 --> 00:45:14,676
I just got off
the phone with Julia.

714
00:45:14,711 --> 00:45:17,578
- She got the part.
- Good for her.

715
00:45:17,612 --> 00:45:20,081
She asked me to buy champagne.

716
00:45:20,115 --> 00:45:22,516
And you will because
you want her to be happy.

717
00:45:24,052 --> 00:45:25,753
It's hot as hell in here.
Turn on the air.

718
00:45:25,787 --> 00:45:28,388
It's on full blast.
Go get ready.

719
00:45:28,423 --> 00:45:31,592
- Open the door at least.
- No, don't.

720
00:45:31,626 --> 00:45:34,060
The radio said there's
a smog emergency.

721
00:45:34,095 --> 00:45:36,930
The air is toxic.
I don't want that in here.

722
00:45:44,872 --> 00:45:48,007
That is
a good-looking bird.

723
00:45:49,508 --> 00:45:53,545
Mommy, wait. We're supposed to
say what we're thankful for.

724
00:45:53,579 --> 00:45:55,047
She's hungry, Bobby.

725
00:45:55,081 --> 00:45:57,850
No, I think it's nice.

726
00:45:57,884 --> 00:45:59,384
Go ahead, buddy.

727
00:45:59,418 --> 00:46:01,820
I'm thankful that
I have two houses

728
00:46:01,855 --> 00:46:04,422
and they're both really big
and I got a new sled.

729
00:46:08,026 --> 00:46:10,027
Doing well.

730
00:46:11,930 --> 00:46:15,166
I am thankful that
I have everything I want.

731
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,668
And that no one else
has anything better.

732
00:46:17,702 --> 00:46:20,371
Me, too.
