1
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:16,501
- Hello?
- Do you ever pray on a difficult problem?

2
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:19,905
Connie.

3
00:01:21,347 --> 00:01:23,178
I had this revelation.

4
00:01:23,516 --> 00:01:28,146
New York City is not
a domestic destination like, say, Dallas.

5
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:31,917
I'm sorry. What?

6
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:36,257
You know, God speaks to us.
We have an impulse and we act on it.

7
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:43,730
<i>- That's very interesting.
- So how do we know to do it, Don?</i>

8
00:01:44,003 --> 00:01:46,267
How do we know to do something?

9
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:49,302
Instinct.

10
00:01:49,642 --> 00:01:51,701
So, you're just like a dog?

11
00:01:53,546 --> 00:01:58,574
I knew the patina of the Waldorf would
shine over all my domestic properties,

12
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:01,119
but it hasn't worked abroad.

13
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:04,824
I know I just gave you New York,
but can you help me with that?

14
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:09,395
You want me to take
your international business, Connie?

15
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:14,924
I want you to earn it. A little bit of wow,
as a lady friend of mine used to say.

16
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:18,866
Let me think on that.

17
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:24,167
It sounds like pride, but I want Hiltons
all over the world, like missions.

18
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:27,271
I want a Hilton on the moon.
That's where we're headed.

19
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:30,507
Okay.

20
00:02:31,117 --> 00:02:35,281
America is wherever we look,
wherever we're going to be.

21
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:41,158
- That's very good, Connie.
- You're the one who said that to me.

22
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,428
Well, I guess it's not that memorable.

23
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:49,661
Write up a proposal for
the New York Hiltons as convention spaces.

24
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:52,897
Send it over to me by noon.
I'll take it on the plane.

25
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:54,731
Done.

26
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,704
Goodbye.

27
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,911
- I'm sorry about that.
- It's okay.

28
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:14,654
I don't think the 4:00 a. m. Feedings
are over yet.

29
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:17,786
"I want what I want when I want it,"

30
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:21,258
and you don't care what it does
to the rest of us.

31
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:24,928
Like someone else I know. Yeah.

32
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:29,166
Baby's up every three hours.
Hilton only calls every four.

33
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:31,004
I think you like it.

34
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:39,112
What are you doing?

35
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:43,412
I can't sleep. I'm going in.

36
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:03,002
What are you doing?

37
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:05,200
- I'm running.
- In the dark?

38
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:08,346
It's cool, it's quiet and no one bothers me.

39
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:13,151
You're wrong about that.

40
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:15,947
Let me give you a ride.
Where are you going?

41
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:19,286
I'm going home,
and the whole idea is to run there.

42
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,024
Well, take a break. You smoke?

43
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:27,165
<i>- The Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King...
- Take me up to Ross Lane.</i>

44
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,566
<i>...president of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference, spoke at the march.</i>

45
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:36,199
<i>I have a dream that my four little children...</i>

46
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:38,143
<i>- Don't.
... will one day live in a nation</i>

47
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:41,372
<i>where they will not be judged
by the color of their skin</i>

48
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:45,417
<i>but by the content of their character.
I have a dream today.</i>

49
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:53,284
<i>Two young women were brutally murdered
in their Upper East Side apartment...</i>

50
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:58,923
When school starts,
I'm going to read it to the kids the first day.

51
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:02,423
Do you think they can understand it?

52
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:07,369
I think they already know it, and it'd be nice
for them to hear an adult say it.

53
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:11,441
Who are you?

54
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,477
I mean, dumb or pure?

55
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:24,421
Running out here in the middle of the night
and I run into you.

56
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:29,526
- How did that happen?
- What are you doing on the road?

57
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:34,191
I don't know. I can't sleep.

58
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:40,867
- Right or left?
- Just let me out up here.

59
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:56,846
- It's a nice house.
- I rent the apartment over the garage.

60
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:01,584
- Have coffee with me.
- You'll be late for work.

61
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:05,022
I'm always late. It's coffee.

62
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:12,202
Maybe that's why you can't sleep.
Too much coffee.

63
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:32,790
Good morning.

64
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:37,154
Sorry.

65
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:40,230
How long have you been there?
I had no idea.

66
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,100
Can you get me some coffee, please?
And I need you to type this up

67
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:45,033
and get it to Hilton
before he leaves for Europe.

68
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:47,197
Actually, he's going to California.

69
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:50,867
He already left two messages on the service.
Do you want me to get him?

70
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:54,504
- This. Coffee. Hilton.
- Of course.

71
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:15,263
- Mr. Draper usually brings this in.
- He left early.

72
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:21,468
- Can we go outside now?
- It's raining. Go upstairs.

73
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:36,418
- I did not sleep last night.
- Go take a nap. I'll shop in the afternoon.

74
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:24,366
It could either be the view of the Acropolis,
or just these big columns,

75
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,438
like you're standing there.

76
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:31,943
Then below it,
"Your window on the world. Hilton," period.

77
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:35,939
That window looks as old to me
as those columns.

78
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:39,346
Did anybody look at a picture
of the Athens Hilton?

79
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:42,010
Sliding doors don't read as windows.

80
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:43,883
And believe it or not,
we're not allowed to pretend

81
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:47,949
that that's the view from the window
of the Hilton, because it's not.

82
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,618
Other than that?

83
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:51,887
The tag is flat.

84
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:55,357
- Well, that one's yours.
- That doesn't make it good.

85
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:57,459
If it's bad, don't use it.

86
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:00,869
What else?

87
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:06,642
There are 16 graphically-perfect reduced
photographs of Hilton hotels all on a grid.

88
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:09,874
- Simple headline.
- "Go. We'll meet you anywhere. "

89
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:16,647
Now that I can finally understand you, I am
less impressed with what you have to say.

90
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,721
That's your work, too.

91
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:24,558
- Who's we?
- We are Hilton.

92
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:27,428
And how do I know that?

93
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:30,764
Take out a magnifying glass
and look at one of those tiny hotels?

94
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:33,770
I write "Hilton" very big under this Greek.

95
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,065
There is no deadline.

96
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:41,306
I want to see work as you think of it.
Give me more ideas to reject.

97
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:44,009
I can't do this all by myself.

98
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:56,851
- I'm telling you, it's bad for me.
- What's that supposed to mean?

99
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:09,102
And cut! Well, I think we've finally got it.

100
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:12,033
I told you, you had it the first time,
if that's what you want.

101
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:14,635
And I told you I want what you want.

102
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:18,683
- Where is he supposed to be looking?
- Onto the horizon.

103
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:21,378
We want people to focus on the Lucky.

104
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:26,455
- This is what your father signed off on.
- Let me see it again.

105
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:30,157
Nathaniel, again, please.
Watch through the camera.

106
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:32,391
That's a good idea.

107
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:36,895
Action.

108
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:51,744
I just don't know what he's looking at.
I want him staring right at us at the end.

109
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:59,990
There's a style for the draw on these spots
and it's stop, inhale, 1,000-yard stare.

110
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,225
Tell me what you think.

111
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:09,966
I think you're the client
and we should do what you want.

112
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:13,971
- It can make people very uncomfortable.
- Walter Cronkite does it every night.

113
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:17,133
Let's take a risk together,
shall we, Sally?

114
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:22,139
Going again. This time, Nathaniel,
on the draw, look right in the lens.

115
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:35,489
<i>It's Wednesday, September 4th,
and currently 64 degrees in Manhattan.</i>

116
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,364
We have to get a pencil case.

117
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:50,805
- What's wrong with your pencil box?
- How was the first day?

118
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:54,070
I wish I could've found the camera,

119
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:55,870
just so we could see the difference
on your face

120
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:59,473
from when you left this morning
to when I picked you up.

121
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:02,681
- So, you like your teacher?
- She's okay.

122
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:05,416
It's Mrs. Patton. All they do is draw.

123
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:09,022
Is this today's mail?

124
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,033
- I'll get him.
- Would you?

125
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:48,766
You're so quiet. You must be tired.

126
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:54,071
I'm not tired. I really want a pencil case
to put in my loose-leaf.

127
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:56,671
We'll see.

128
00:12:57,743 --> 00:13:01,611
<i>Lucky Strike, the hard-working smoke
with that smooth and honest taste.</i>

129
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:05,115
- Cut.
- So, it's a rhythm?

130
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:09,219
That's true. Obviously, it'll sound better
with the announcer's voice.

131
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:11,687
It sounded like you had a half a pastrami
in your mouth.

132
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,726
It's a scratch track. I didn't know
you were gonna show it to the client.

133
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:16,658
I know I'm supposed to stay away
till the screening,

134
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:18,889
but I am fascinated by this process.

135
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:21,558
You're thinking about getting out
of cigarettes and into the movies?

136
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:23,760
Not while my father's alive.

137
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:28,030
Well, if we rerecord the sound tonight,
we can probably finish this.

138
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,268
I heard you the first time.
I'll be in the booth.

139
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:43,081
I'd appreciate it if you'd forget
all that nonsense I was saying before.

140
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:47,958
- What are you talking about?
- The movies, my father.

141
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:54,489
- Forgotten.
- Sorry, but I had a long, wet lunch.

142
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:59,271
- Really? Too much to drink.
- And other things.

143
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:03,633
Secretaries nowadays,
they don't give you a choice.

144
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:05,505
You know what I mean?

145
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:08,813
- I don't have a secretary.
- How'd my shot turn out?

146
00:14:08,914 --> 00:14:11,849
I'm not sure. I think it's gonna feel strange.

147
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:15,284
Lucky Strike has a way of doing things.
Look at this.

148
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:23,090
Yeah, see? I don't think that's so bad.

149
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:35,336
Come on. He's not coming back for a while.

150
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:39,772
I'll lock the door.

151
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:42,970
- I'm married.
- So am I.

152
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:48,909
- There's been a misunderstanding.
- I know what I know.

153
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:59,027
Jerry should have the tracks done.

154
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:02,567
You can see the whole thing tomorrow
or when it's done.

155
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:05,866
I'll probably be busy tomorrow.

156
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:13,637
I got it. You're at work. That's too bad.

157
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:36,299
<i>- How about a nasty old alligator?
- He has a point.</i>

158
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:38,996
<i>Down, Sue. I'll handle this.</i>

159
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:44,207
<i>"Henry, I'm so pleased there's a place
that I can write to you.</i>

160
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,170
<i>"The children are finally
back in school now, and I must admit</i>

161
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,806
<i>"that I like the idea of looking forward
to the mail's arrival every day.</i>

162
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:53,077
<i>"Well, not every day. Ha, ha.</i>

163
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:58,285
<i>"I don't write many letters anymore,
so I apologize in advance</i>

164
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:01,518
<i>"if I'm unable to accurately
express my thoughts.</i>

165
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,595
<i>"But I do have thoughts,</i>

166
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:08,394
<i>"and I suppose I wonder too much
where you are and what you're doing.</i>

167
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:15,071
<i>"We've only met three times,
you know that? Isn't that strange?</i>

168
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:19,771
<i>"I wish I had a clearer picture of you
in my mind.</i>

169
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:25,146
<i>"Anyway, that's all I have to report.
I hope to hear from you. B."</i>

170
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:38,894
Don't touch it.

171
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:42,695
- I've seen this one. It whitens.
- It's not about what you want to watch.

172
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:44,268
I have to make sure
they run every commercial.

173
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:47,237
<i>...pillowcases, socks, towels, everything.</i>

174
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:51,576
My mother-in-law says
I look like Perry Mason.

175
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:55,547
It's not a compliment.
It means she thinks you're fat.

176
00:16:57,883 --> 00:17:00,852
- Crane.
- Harry, it's Lee Garner.

177
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,780
I knew you'd still be there.

178
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:07,887
<i>- You work hard, don't you?
- For you? You bet.</i>

179
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:12,555
Look, I don't want to keep you,
but I have a bit of a problem.

180
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:17,199
- What's wrong?
- It's that Salvatore fellow, the director.

181
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:21,639
He's no good. I'd like him gone.

182
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:26,541
- What happened?
- Well, I can't work with him. Get rid of him.

183
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:30,680
- Well, I can't do that.
- Excuse me?

184
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:35,410
No, I'm not really... I can't.
Pete and Roger handle your account.

185
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:40,124
No, no. No, no, no, Harry.
I want you to take care of this,

186
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:43,925
and I want you to keep it just between us.

187
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:48,026
<i>Crane, you there?</i>

188
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:53,031
Listen, Lee. I hope you know
the commercial's turning out beautiful.

189
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:56,164
- You really have an eye, you know.
- I do, do I?

190
00:17:56,508 --> 00:18:00,569
<i>- Are you enjoying the city?
- I am. Plenty to do.</i>

191
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:05,410
Well, you have a good night.
I should get back to work.

192
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,944
- Sorry to trouble you. Good night.
- Good night.

193
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:14,285
- What was that?
- You don't want to know.

194
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,494
- I think I do.
- I can't tell you.

195
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:20,355
Now I really do.

196
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:25,696
- Lee Garner Jr. Asked me to get rid of Sal.
- What'd he do?

197
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:29,370
I didn't ask. He was drunk as a skunk
and he's scary to begin with.

198
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:30,942
What are you gonna do, call Campbell?

199
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:34,410
That's the other thing.
He said to keep it between us.

200
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:36,344
What are you gonna do?

201
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:40,582
I'm not gonna panic
and do something stupid like I usually do.

202
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:43,951
- That's a good start.
- I can't really do anything, can I?

203
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:45,785
He was really drunk.

204
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,925
The show's on.

205
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,051
Great, I missed all the commercials.

206
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:08,410
- Hello?
- Don, it's Conrad Hilton.

207
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:10,374
Is it?

208
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:14,915
Now, don't be like that.
I know it's a privilege to call you at home.

209
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:18,581
I don't think I've worn it out. It's 11:30.

210
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:24,554
- It's not a problem, Connie.
- Can you come have a drink with me?

211
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:29,230
- Right now?
- You can say no. I've heard it before.

212
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:33,237
And for all you know,
you're not the first person I asked.

213
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:35,973
I'll be there.

214
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:38,467
Give me an hour.

215
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:42,339
Hello?

216
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:49,483
- So what is that, moonshine?
- No, but it is from Prohibition.

217
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:54,058
I have two cases,
and they both say "hair tonic" on the side.

218
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:12,000
I remember this.

219
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:19,146
I think you know
I'm in a bit of a crisis tonight.

220
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:24,355
- I didn't know that.
- I think about my business day and night.

221
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:28,226
And I'm a harsh critic, especially of myself.

222
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:34,455
And sometimes it collects, and I feel bad.

223
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:43,035
And then I realize
maybe that's the reason I'm so lonesome.

224
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:48,671
- You might be working too much.
- I'm not working enough.

225
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:56,988
It's my purpose in life
to bring America to the world,

226
00:20:58,023 --> 00:21:00,116
whether they like it or not.

227
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:08,093
You know, we are a force of good, Don,
because we have God.

228
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:12,061
Communists don't.

229
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:16,533
It's their most important belief.
Did you know that?

230
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:20,004
I'm not an expert.

231
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:25,646
Generosity. The Marshall Plan,
you remember that?

232
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:32,780
Everyone who saw our ways
wanted to be us.

233
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:37,925
I'm glad you're telling me this.

234
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:44,998
After all the things we threw at Khrushchev,
you know what made him fall apart?

235
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:48,235
He couldn't get into Disneyland.

236
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,446
- That's good.
- You never heard that?

237
00:21:56,882 --> 00:22:00,648
Well, I did, but when I hear you say it,
it sounds beautiful.

238
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:06,947
I don't want any politics in my campaign.
You know that.

239
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:11,359
But there should be...

240
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:18,168
Goodness, and confidence.

241
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:23,671
Thanks for listening to me, Don.

242
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:28,172
You know, sometimes I look around here,

243
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:35,384
and I think, "By golly, I'm King Midas. "

244
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:41,823
Stop it. You're not.

245
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:50,762
You're my angel, you know that?
You're like a son.

246
00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:58,132
In fact,
sometimes you're more than a son to me

247
00:23:00,245 --> 00:23:03,146
because you didn't have what they had,

248
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:08,480
and you understand.

249
00:23:11,256 --> 00:23:12,553
Thank you.

250
00:23:18,663 --> 00:23:19,960
I mean it.

251
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,811
Come in, come in, come in.

252
00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:48,651
I drove all the way down to get the mail,
and then I turned around and I debated it.

253
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:52,719
- I went past the exit a dozen times, and...
- My girl is due back.

254
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,324
I know I shouldn't be here.

255
00:23:58,003 --> 00:24:00,267
It's just, I wanted to see you.

256
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,234
I wasn't thinking.

257
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:09,841
- What do I say? Why are you here?
- There you are.

258
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:13,641
Carla, this is Henry Francis.
He works for Governor Rockefeller.

259
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:15,583
It's nice to meet you.

260
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:22,053
So anyway, I think this is
an excellent venue for a fundraiser.

261
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:27,960
- Good. I'll have to check with my husband.
- Of course.

262
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:33,533
Carla, will you show Mr. Francis out?
I think I left the bath running.

263
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,500
- A pleasure to meet you.
- You as well.

264
00:24:57,128 --> 00:24:59,619
I can't get this. Lucy, do you mind?

265
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:09,735
Jesus, knock it off.

266
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:12,839
It's a Lucky Strike commercial.
It's got three cuts in it.

267
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:16,209
So the hillbilly says, "That ain't my finger. "

268
00:25:18,116 --> 00:25:21,279
I'm gonna have to hear
the beginning of that joke.

269
00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:26,622
Lee? Lee!

270
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:34,358
- What's going on?
- I have no idea.

271
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:37,862
Does someone know what's going on?
Speak up.

272
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:39,129
I know.

273
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:42,999
Lee Garner Jr. Called me
a couple of days ago. I'm sorry.

274
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:45,167
- Why is he calling you?
- I don't know.

275
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:48,405
- He did, and he told me to get rid of Sal.
- What?

276
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:51,107
And you made an executive decision
to do nothing?

277
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,343
He was really drunk.
I thought it would blow over.

278
00:25:53,451 --> 00:25:54,577
I didn't even think he'd remember.

279
00:25:54,686 --> 00:25:56,847
When you get in trouble,
you call Mommy and Daddy.

280
00:25:56,955 --> 00:25:59,355
He told me not to tell you,
so what was I supposed to do?

281
00:25:59,457 --> 00:26:03,052
Everyone's an account man. What exactly
do you think we do here, Crane?

282
00:26:03,161 --> 00:26:04,788
We handle clients.

283
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:08,956
- He wouldn't say a word. He just left.
- Sal, you're fired.

284
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:13,498
- Are you serious?
- Lee Garner Jr. Wants you fired.

285
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:20,409
We're gonna find out
what he wants to do with you, imbecile.

286
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:22,878
- Oh, God.
- What the hell happened?

287
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:26,374
What is going on?

288
00:26:26,484 --> 00:26:30,420
Now, you're gonna use your dying breath
to tell Don to fix this.

289
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:33,156
- Don?
- Lee Garner has a problem with creative,

290
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:37,251
let Don solve it.
He does it all now anyway. Now!

291
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:43,531
- What did Lee say to you?
- Nothing. I have to talk to Don.

292
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:47,127
- Let me talk to Don.
- I'm doing as I'm told. Is he busy?

293
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:51,237
I can see you and I can hear you.
What do you want?

294
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,504
Who died?

295
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:59,982
- I screwed up with Lee Garner Jr.
- What?

296
00:27:00,585 --> 00:27:03,748
- How do I explain this?
- He told Harry to fire me.

297
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,947
- Harry?
- I didn't, but now Roger did.

298
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:09,520
- Roger did what?
- He fired me.

299
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:13,496
Roger said to tell you to fix it.
Those are his words.

300
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:15,129
Fantastic.

301
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:19,930
That's a $25 million account
you stuck your nose in, Crane.

302
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,074
Just get out.

303
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:31,941
What happened?

304
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:35,611
Lee Garner got drunk,
and he told Harry to fire me,

305
00:27:35,787 --> 00:27:39,450
and then Roger got angry and he did.
I think if I get away from Lucky Strike

306
00:27:39,557 --> 00:27:42,185
and lay low from Roger for a day or two,
everything will be fine.

307
00:27:42,293 --> 00:27:45,456
I understand what just happened.
What happened with the cut?

308
00:27:45,563 --> 00:27:48,964
- The commercial's fine.
- Sal, something must've happened.

309
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:51,035
I can't help you unless you tell me.

310
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:55,266
- We had a misunderstanding.
- Jesus. I'm not gonna ask again.

311
00:28:02,647 --> 00:28:06,549
He was drunk,
and he cornered me in the editing room.

312
00:28:09,054 --> 00:28:10,749
- Cornered you?
- Yes.

313
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:15,419
And I backed him off,
I told him I was married,

314
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,995
and he was embarrassed and he left.

315
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:24,600
- You must've been really shocked.
- I was, believe me.

316
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,633
But nothing happened,

317
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:32,136
because nothing could have happened
because you're married?

318
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:37,170
- Don, I swear on my mother's life.
- You sure you want to do that?

319
00:28:41,152 --> 00:28:43,620
Who do you think you're talking to?

320
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:47,915
I guess I was just supposed to do
whatever he wanted?

321
00:28:48,026 --> 00:28:49,391
What if it was some girl?

322
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:53,863
That would depend on what kind of girl
it was and what I knew about her.

323
00:28:56,668 --> 00:28:57,999
You people.

324
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:04,335
I didn't do anything but turn him down.

325
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:07,577
He's a bully.

326
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,640
Lucky Strike can shut off our lights.

327
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:23,758
I think you know
that this is the way this has to be.

328
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:34,461
You'll do fine.

329
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:50,750
Get me Lee Garner Jr.

330
00:29:58,863 --> 00:30:00,558
I said I don't want salad.

331
00:30:00,665 --> 00:30:04,157
Watch your tone, young man.
Carla works for me, not you.

332
00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:08,933
- What do you want instead?
- You might as well call it a day.

333
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,537
Okay. Thank you.

334
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,406
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi.

335
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:21,042
How was your day?

336
00:30:23,388 --> 00:30:24,616
Not good.

337
00:30:28,526 --> 00:30:31,256
I didn't want to bother you with it,
but that man dropped by today

338
00:30:31,362 --> 00:30:34,195
from the governor's office. Carla met him.

339
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:39,395
Francine sent him over here.

340
00:30:39,704 --> 00:30:43,572
They want to have a fundraiser,
but her house isn't big enough.

341
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:47,038
I don't care, as long as I don't have to go.
When is it?

342
00:30:47,145 --> 00:30:49,079
Well, I should be going.

343
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,980
Soon. Next week, I think.

344
00:30:53,718 --> 00:30:56,846
- A fundraiser for Rockefeller.
- For the campaign.

345
00:30:59,224 --> 00:31:02,660
- I'm gonna go lay down. Good night, Carla.
- Good night.

346
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,496
- Good night, children.
- Good night.

347
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:06,621
Bye.

348
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:09,432
Good night, Mrs. Draper.

349
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:24,913
If you're here, do I have to be here?
Because I'm leaving.

350
00:31:25,783 --> 00:31:28,718
- No, go ahead.
- Good night, boss.

351
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:45,000
<i>- Henry Francis.
- Hello. I thought I'd get the service.</i>

352
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:48,132
This is Betty Draper.

353
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:52,632
I know that.
Listen, I shouldn't have come by like that.

354
00:31:53,378 --> 00:31:56,541
<i>- I hope I'm not calling too late.
- No, you're not.</i>

355
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,978
I checked with my husband
about the fundraiser.

356
00:32:00,351 --> 00:32:03,582
- The fundraiser?
- Yes, we'd be glad to do that.

357
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:08,151
How's Tuesday the 17th?
Can you make it then? Is that good for you?

358
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,861
Okay. I guess
you're going through with this.

359
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:14,459
I had to.

360
00:32:16,901 --> 00:32:19,369
I'll have my girl call you tomorrow
to make it official.

361
00:32:20,004 --> 00:32:23,201
I look forward to it. Let me know
what's usually provided by the host.

362
00:32:24,142 --> 00:32:25,200
Sure.

363
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,305
Goodbye.

364
00:32:29,314 --> 00:32:30,474
Good night, Betty.

365
00:32:36,354 --> 00:32:41,951
Rome, Tehran, Tokyo
are magnificent destinations,

366
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:45,761
and that's really been the focus
of almost every campaign you've had

367
00:32:45,863 --> 00:32:49,299
up till now.
How to lure the American traveler abroad.

368
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:54,735
What more do we need than a picture
of Athens to get our hearts racing?

369
00:32:54,939 --> 00:32:58,773
And yet the average American
experiences a level of luxury

370
00:32:58,876 --> 00:33:02,175
that belongs only to kings
in most of the world.

371
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:06,776
We're not chauvinists.
We just have expectations.

372
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:13,215
Well, now there's one word that promises
the thrill of international travel

373
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:18,092
with the comfort of home. Hilton.

374
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:25,259
"How do you say ice water
in Italian? Hilton. "

375
00:33:26,904 --> 00:33:31,671
"How do you say fresh towels
in Farsi? Hilton. "

376
00:33:33,277 --> 00:33:37,611
"How do you say hamburger
in Japanese? Hilton. "

377
00:33:40,718 --> 00:33:43,619
"Hilton. " It's the same in every language.

378
00:33:45,923 --> 00:33:50,292
Maybe fried chicken. I don't like
the sound of "hamburger" and "Hilton. "

379
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:53,721
Besides, "hamburger"
is already a foreign word.

380
00:33:53,998 --> 00:33:55,295
We'll see.

381
00:34:04,909 --> 00:34:08,276
It's good. Very good.

382
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:12,145
It's clever, yet friendly. Draws you in.

383
00:34:14,452 --> 00:34:16,386
But what about the moon?

384
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:20,188
- Excuse me?
- There's nothing about the moon.

385
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:22,986
Well, right now,
that's not an actual destination.

386
00:34:23,094 --> 00:34:26,689
That wasn't the point.
I said I wanted Hilton on the moon.

387
00:34:27,131 --> 00:34:29,895
I couldn't have been more clear about it.

388
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:36,303
Well, I'll admit I misunderstood that.
I'm sure there's a way to fit that into this.

389
00:34:41,345 --> 00:34:43,404
Well, isn't this something?

390
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:50,079
I'd like to speak with Don in private.

391
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:08,565
This is a good campaign, one of the best.

392
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:11,870
It's modern, it's witty, it's eye-catching.
It will change your business.

393
00:35:11,976 --> 00:35:15,776
Calm down.
I'm going to speak very honestly with you.

394
00:35:16,814 --> 00:35:21,012
I don't think folks do that often.
Probably scared.

395
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,586
Or they trust my work.

396
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:25,815
You want me to just say yes
to everything you do?

397
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:30,827
Most ad men believe that clients are
the thing that gets in the way of good work.

398
00:35:30,928 --> 00:35:33,021
I've never experienced that.

399
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:36,932
You did not give me what I wanted.

400
00:35:38,936 --> 00:35:41,097
I'm deeply disappointed, Don.

401
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:45,609
This is a great campaign.

402
00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:51,409
Fine. What do you want from me? Love?
Your work is good.

403
00:35:58,055 --> 00:36:02,082
But when I say I want the moon,
I expect the moon.

404
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:15,866
- I said if he ran, I'd support him.
- I haven't decided yet.

405
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:19,432
I voted for Kennedy.
I'll probably vote for him again.

406
00:36:22,146 --> 00:36:23,875
What a nice turnout.

407
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:28,142
- Where's Henry Francis?
- I don't know. Someone's supposed to talk.

408
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:31,482
I don't know anything about Rockefeller.
That's why I did this.

409
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:34,057
Well, I want to know
how he's gonna deal with the South.

410
00:36:34,158 --> 00:36:35,853
Do you know how bad it must be
for the negroes

411
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,793
to descend on Washington like that
just to be heard?

412
00:36:38,896 --> 00:36:41,865
Segregation is uncivilized. It's that simple.

413
00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:47,198
You know what my father says
about the South? "It's not 1963, it's 1863."

414
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,229
Thank you.

415
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:54,038
Mrs. Draper, I'm Elsa Kittridge
and I work with Mr. Francis.

416
00:36:54,145 --> 00:36:56,579
Pleasure to meet you.
I assume he's been delayed.

417
00:36:56,681 --> 00:37:00,879
Actually he asked that I address the group
on behalf of the governor.

418
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:04,350
That's disappointing.

419
00:37:05,423 --> 00:37:07,152
I mean, I don't think it's going
to help your fundraising

420
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:09,488
when you promise one thing
and deliver another.

421
00:37:09,594 --> 00:37:11,289
Well, perhaps you're right,

422
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:14,523
but he seemed to think
I was a better match to the group,

423
00:37:14,632 --> 00:37:16,600
and I am extremely informed.

424
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:19,727
In fact, I'm the person
who briefs Mr. Francis.

425
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:26,166
I think you'll see I won't embarrass you
in front of your friends.

426
00:37:26,944 --> 00:37:30,880
- Please, begin whenever you want.
- No, you begin, dear.

427
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:42,451
Excuse me, my name is Betty Draper.
Welcome to my home.

428
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:45,654
- We're going to listen to...
- Elsa Kittridge,

429
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:48,789
Associate in the Governor's
Information Office.

430
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:56,029
First I would like to dispel the rumor that
there is a mandatory contribution tonight.

431
00:37:56,140 --> 00:38:00,099
This is a taking of a pulse,
an exchange of ideas.

432
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:21,087
Please see that we're not disturbed.

433
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:31,498
Hey!

434
00:38:32,343 --> 00:38:34,743
<i>Mr. Francis, do you need anything?</i>

435
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:39,913
- No, Marjorie, I dropped something.
- Where were you last night?

436
00:38:40,284 --> 00:38:42,582
- Calm down.
- Why didn't you come?

437
00:38:42,853 --> 00:38:45,185
Why did you send that woman?

438
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:51,521
- I watched the door all night like a sap.
- I'm sorry, but I wanted you to come to me.

439
00:38:53,097 --> 00:38:55,463
- The ego.
- Would you listen to me?

440
00:38:55,633 --> 00:38:58,329
- You had to come to me.
- And why is that?

441
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:03,037
Because you're married.

442
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:31,998
No, Henry.

443
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:35,137
What's wrong?

444
00:39:35,806 --> 00:39:38,866
Please. We're locked in this office.

445
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:44,414
What? On the desk? On the couch?

446
00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:48,007
- We should get a room somewhere.
- No.

447
00:39:50,154 --> 00:39:51,519
It's tawdry.

448
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:56,222
I'm sorry.

449
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:01,859
I'm very sorry. I started this.

450
00:40:07,671 --> 00:40:09,730
I don't know what you want.

451
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:18,142
Goodbye.

452
00:40:27,324 --> 00:40:30,691
<i>- Mr. Sterling's here to see you.
- Send him in.</i>

453
00:40:34,498 --> 00:40:37,626
I heard Conrad Hilton left this building
in a huff yesterday.

454
00:40:37,735 --> 00:40:39,202
Who told you that?

455
00:40:39,303 --> 00:40:42,830
You've got your face so deep in Hilton's
lap, you're ignoring everything else.

456
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:46,376
- Everything's under control.
- You won't even let me meet the man.

457
00:40:46,477 --> 00:40:50,345
What do you think accounts does,
besides limit your brilliance?

458
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:54,484
I'd tell you,
but I don't want to hurt your feelings.

459
00:40:54,585 --> 00:40:55,882
Keep joking about it.

460
00:40:55,986 --> 00:41:00,082
We've had two clients in one week
leave here angry. Important clients.

461
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:02,921
Is that what you want this place
to be known for?

462
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:06,155
That and some guy losing his foot
in a lawnmower?

463
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:10,267
I want to put you on notice,
you are in over your head.

464
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,930
<i>These children,</i>

465
00:41:19,777 --> 00:41:23,577
<i>unoffending, innocent and beautiful,</i>

466
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:31,449
<i>were the victims
of one of the most vicious and tragic crimes</i>

467
00:41:33,557 --> 00:41:36,219
<i>ever perpetrated against humanity.</i>

468
00:41:39,396 --> 00:41:42,092
You can leave it on your station.
I don't mind.

469
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:44,463
- It's all right.
- What was that?

470
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:49,506
The funeral service
for the little girls in Birmingham.

471
00:41:50,908 --> 00:41:52,603
It's so horrifying.

472
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,371
Are you okay? Do you need a day off?

473
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:01,816
No, I'm fine. Thank you.

474
00:42:06,156 --> 00:42:10,388
I hate to say this, but it's really
made me wonder about civil rights.

475
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:13,762
Maybe it's not supposed
to happen right now.

476
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:19,359
- Hello, Mr. Draper.
- Hello.

477
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:23,438
You just missed bedtime.
They're probably still awake.

478
00:42:33,817 --> 00:42:37,218
No, don't bother with dinner.
We got Chinese takeout.

479
00:42:39,423 --> 00:42:42,392
Listen, Marty needs me
to look over this work.

480
00:42:42,993 --> 00:42:44,756
Don't wait up for me.

481
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:47,655
I love you, too.

482
00:43:33,077 --> 00:43:34,203
Betts.

483
00:43:35,813 --> 00:43:36,871
What?

484
00:43:38,415 --> 00:43:41,043
Hilton just called. I'm going in.

485
00:43:43,587 --> 00:43:45,521
I didn't hear the phone.

486
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,052
Go back to sleep.

487
00:44:16,286 --> 00:44:19,187
- Someone's going to see you.
- Then let me in.

488
00:44:36,373 --> 00:44:37,806
This is nice.

489
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:43,676
What can I do for you?

490
00:44:44,815 --> 00:44:47,181
I don't know. I wanted to talk.

491
00:44:48,585 --> 00:44:51,748
Right. Says the man
as he unbuckles his pants.

492
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:57,320
What do you want me to say?
You've been flirting with me for months.

493
00:44:58,829 --> 00:45:02,321
- So what?
- So, I can't stop thinking about you.

494
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:07,963
Because I'm new and different.
Or maybe I'm exactly the same.

495
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:12,270
Tell me you've run past that stretch
of highway in the past two weeks

496
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:14,207
and not thought of me,

497
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:16,706
not looked for me.

498
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:21,543
But then I have the luxury
of that last half-mile home

499
00:45:21,652 --> 00:45:25,247
where I go through every step of the future
until it ends.

500
00:45:25,823 --> 00:45:27,882
I know exactly how it ends.

501
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:29,920
So what?

502
00:45:31,962 --> 00:45:35,295
You live two miles from here.
Your daughter was my student.

503
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:37,799
I've seen your wife in the market.

504
00:45:38,035 --> 00:45:41,061
I don't think
you've done this before this way.

505
00:45:51,215 --> 00:45:52,546
I want you.

506
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:58,017
I don't care. Doesn't that mean anything
to someone like you?
