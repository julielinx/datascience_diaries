<i>Previously on</i> Mad Men.

2
00:00:06,822 --> 00:00:08,930
You don't want to do this,
you have a wife.

3
00:00:09,172 --> 00:00:10,181
Leave the ideas to me.

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:11,641
I have ideas.

5
00:00:11,883 --> 00:00:13,870
I don't let strange men
into my home.

6
00:00:14,385 --> 00:00:16,771
I'm not selling rifles here,
i'm in the tobacco business.

7
00:00:16,957 --> 00:00:18,481
What do you have
to be nervous about?

8
00:00:18,723 --> 00:00:20,073
Mr. Rumson is presenting
my copy today,

9
00:00:20,196 --> 00:00:21,476
to the <i>Belle Jolie</i> people.

10
00:00:21,662 --> 00:00:24,387
Don't waste your youth on age.

11
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:27,156
Mirabel... Mirabel...

12
00:00:29,667 --> 00:00:31,160
Your wife's name is Mona!

13
00:00:31,687 --> 00:00:33,746
It's Adam, your little brother.

00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:20,430
Listen, can you
mail this for me today?

16
00:01:20,917 --> 00:01:21,917
Sure.

17
00:01:22,651 --> 00:01:24,630
It's going to be at least 40 cents.

18
00:01:29,294 --> 00:01:30,426
Thank you.

19
00:02:02,363 --> 00:02:04,817
Mama, Mrs. Winter is a busybody.

20
00:02:06,742 --> 00:02:08,327
You're threatening me.

22
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:12,147
I'm glad he wants to see me, but I--

24
00:02:12,288 --> 00:02:14,272
I don't want to see him.

25
00:02:15,616 --> 00:02:18,715
I'm working a lot right now.
I don't have a lot of time.

26
00:02:20,196 --> 00:02:21,347
I have to go.

27
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:25,836
Were you listening to my phone call?

28
00:02:26,237 --> 00:02:28,111
You mean your personal phone call?

29
00:02:30,082 --> 00:02:31,456
Good morning, Mr. Draper.

30
00:02:31,645 --> 00:02:33,550
Peggy, will you get me
a glass of ice water?

31
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,612
Someone hasn't told
the sun it's october.

32
00:02:35,926 --> 00:02:37,429
- Miss holloway.
- Mr. Draper,

33
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:40,623
it's the clients luncheon. Mr. Cooper
said you were responsible

34
00:02:40,865 --> 00:02:42,125
while Mr. Sterling is out.

35
00:02:42,445 --> 00:02:45,356
Didn't you handle most of
Mr. Sterling's catering questions?

36
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:46,495
Continue doing that.

37
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:47,821
How is he? Have you visited?

38
00:02:48,197 --> 00:02:49,237
I have.

39
00:02:49,578 --> 00:02:50,675
He's less sickly.

40
00:02:51,948 --> 00:02:54,355
I hope he knows how
concerned we all are.

41
00:02:56,338 --> 00:02:58,043
- Good morning, chief.
- Don.

42
00:03:01,134 --> 00:03:02,660
She's been a bitch lately.

43
00:03:02,826 --> 00:03:04,763
- Anyone else noticed that?
- Absolutely.

44
00:03:04,994 --> 00:03:06,399
- I like it.
- Do you?

45
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,353
This got kicked over
from Ed Baltz at Compton.

46
00:03:14,678 --> 00:03:16,325
We sent them Firestone last month

47
00:03:16,567 --> 00:03:18,320
because of our conflict
with <i>Goodyear</i>.

48
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:19,912
This is how they repaid the favor.

49
00:03:20,155 --> 00:03:22,206
Look at that.
I think it's a modified

50
00:03:22,448 --> 00:03:23,527
lionel transformer.

51
00:03:23,747 --> 00:03:25,227
Well, I never thought i'd say this,

52
00:03:25,382 --> 00:03:26,669
but what does the research say?

53
00:03:26,911 --> 00:03:28,880
Weight loss is a hard thing to prove.

54
00:03:29,366 --> 00:03:31,862
No, it isn't. It's "before"
and "after" pictures

55
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,521
since the dawn of time.

56
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:36,876
Mr. Martin Buckwald, its inventor,
he calls it the P.E.R.,

57
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:38,931
or Passive Exercise Regime.

58
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,311
So it needs a name.

59
00:03:45,682 --> 00:03:47,138
The Electrocizer.

60
00:03:48,552 --> 00:03:50,266
For a slimmer, better you.

61
00:03:50,466 --> 00:03:51,945
That helps a little.

62
00:03:52,724 --> 00:03:53,811
Regarding slimmer,

63
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,088
Buckwald has a fair amount
of testimonials, but unfortunately

64
00:03:57,241 --> 00:03:58,701
none you can take a picture of.

65
00:03:58,943 --> 00:04:00,713
We tried to get
our own testimonials.

66
00:04:00,854 --> 00:04:02,906
Some of the fellas brought
it home to their wives.

67
00:04:03,008 --> 00:04:04,999
- And?
- It's tricky. I...

68
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:06,542
gave it to Jennifer.

69
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,920
She took it the wrong way.
She told me to wear it.

70
00:04:11,945 --> 00:04:13,166
Violet has it.

71
00:04:13,871 --> 00:04:16,586
She says the scales are the same,
but she hasn't given up on it

72
00:04:16,774 --> 00:04:18,429
like she does with diets
after a week.

73
00:04:19,056 --> 00:04:22,050
Mitch and some of the other guys--
We had eight belts.

74
00:04:22,488 --> 00:04:24,308
Again, there's been
no weight loss yet.

75
00:04:24,483 --> 00:04:25,478
Who cares if it works?

76
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,364
They're offering us
commission on media,

77
00:04:27,482 --> 00:04:29,774
plus a bounty on every unit
upside of last year's comps.

78
00:04:30,015 --> 00:04:31,692
But fake weight loss claims?

79
00:04:37,315 --> 00:04:38,396
Thank you.

80
00:04:45,735 --> 00:04:46,603
What about her?

81
00:04:46,968 --> 00:04:49,199
She's obviously losing
some kind of battle.

82
00:04:50,946 --> 00:04:53,068
You may have to let it out a little.

83
00:04:53,322 --> 00:04:56,007
Maybe you should put her on your
regimen of sprinting out the door

84
00:04:56,109 --> 00:04:56,949
every day at 5 to 5.

85
00:04:57,051 --> 00:04:58,094
What I'm saying is

86
00:04:58,335 --> 00:05:00,601
she did a heck of a job
on <i>Belle Jolie</i>.

87
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:02,968
Maybe lightning will strike twice.

88
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:05,435
I don't think Peggy's the answer.

89
00:05:06,751 --> 00:05:09,063
I promised Buckwald
we'd go with our big guns.

90
00:05:09,644 --> 00:05:12,020
Our big guns have been silent.

91
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:18,726
Did you need more water?

92
00:05:19,954 --> 00:05:22,209
This device is a new product.

93
00:05:23,772 --> 00:05:26,413
I would like you to give us
your thoughts on it.

94
00:05:27,506 --> 00:05:29,041
- Right now?
- No.

95
00:05:30,659 --> 00:05:33,212
It's a weight loss belt, it says.

96
00:05:34,069 --> 00:05:35,048
It...

97
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:37,988
stimulates the muscles,
imitating calisthenics.

98
00:05:38,459 --> 00:05:39,927
You'd be perfect for it.

99
00:05:41,213 --> 00:05:42,013
Why?

100
00:05:42,945 --> 00:05:44,331
Because you're a woman.

101
00:05:44,495 --> 00:05:46,601
And we'd like your point of view.

102
00:05:49,025 --> 00:05:50,313
I'm getting another account?

103
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:53,566
It's an assignment, not an account.

104
00:05:57,674 --> 00:06:00,198
Go ahead, sweetheart.
Take it for a spin.

105
00:06:05,441 --> 00:06:07,205
Am I allowed to change the name?

106
00:06:09,241 --> 00:06:10,041
Yes.

107
00:06:10,539 --> 00:06:11,567
Thank you.

108
00:06:13,049 --> 00:06:14,254
That'll be all.

109
00:06:20,184 --> 00:06:22,189
I need 3.59 for the phone bill.

110
00:06:22,571 --> 00:06:23,844
I told you I never use it.

111
00:06:24,019 --> 00:06:25,628
But you do use The Saltines

112
00:06:25,971 --> 00:06:28,460
and The Velveeta and The Liverwurst.
I never even got any.

113
00:06:28,885 --> 00:06:32,025
I had some people over while
you were out drinking on tuesday.

114
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,061
3.59.

115
00:06:33,877 --> 00:06:36,401
That's your half of the phone.
You should use it more.

116
00:06:37,002 --> 00:06:38,236
I have work to do.

117
00:06:39,395 --> 00:06:40,937
I don't know why you do that.

118
00:06:41,203 --> 00:06:42,698
When I leave the office, i'm done.

119
00:08:30,251 --> 00:08:31,848
Do you have to go home?

120
00:08:33,043 --> 00:08:34,043
No.

121
00:08:35,044 --> 00:08:35,853
Good.

122
00:08:36,122 --> 00:08:37,233
I don't want you to.

123
00:08:39,956 --> 00:08:41,172
I don't want to.

124
00:08:48,073 --> 00:08:49,693
Why is this hard for me?

125
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:55,331
Mostly because I can't even imagine
how hard it must be for you.

126
00:08:58,249 --> 00:08:59,787
I don't think about it.

127
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:02,511
I mean, I try not to.

128
00:09:03,255 --> 00:09:04,465
Must be a powerful mind

129
00:09:04,712 --> 00:09:05,895
you have there,

130
00:09:06,633 --> 00:09:08,524
because I can't control mine.

131
00:09:12,063 --> 00:09:14,412
I keep thinking
about us being together.

132
00:09:15,524 --> 00:09:17,856
- We are together.
- I know, but--

133
00:09:22,272 --> 00:09:24,921
I don't know if I understand
how this works,

134
00:09:26,297 --> 00:09:27,502
where it goes.

135
00:09:29,513 --> 00:09:31,251
I'm worried it's a fantasy.

136
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:34,713
It's not.

137
00:09:37,387 --> 00:09:38,462
I told you,

138
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:41,600
I'm right where I'm supposed to be.

139
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:55,956
I just haven't figured out
what to do yet.

140
00:10:12,376 --> 00:10:14,431
I'm sorry. Would you
like me to wait outside?

141
00:10:14,713 --> 00:10:15,953
It's up to you.

142
00:10:16,902 --> 00:10:17,902
I...

143
00:10:18,269 --> 00:10:20,940
I did the work on the weight
loss belt, like you asked.

144
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:22,279
That was fast.

145
00:10:22,652 --> 00:10:23,939
You asked me to.

146
00:10:24,412 --> 00:10:26,506
And what is your
unique point of view?

147
00:10:27,714 --> 00:10:28,930
I wrote it down.

148
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:31,484
Summarize.

149
00:10:32,824 --> 00:10:34,785
It's one day. I don't know
if I lost any weight.

150
00:10:34,922 --> 00:10:36,140
Do you feel different?

151
00:10:37,587 --> 00:10:38,832
I wrote it down.

152
00:10:47,203 --> 00:10:49,570
Peggy, you're saying even
less in here than you are now.

153
00:10:51,499 --> 00:10:53,199
It's hard to put into words.

154
00:10:53,441 --> 00:10:54,920
Then you have failed.

155
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,214
You definitely feel something

156
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:01,933
that I think some women...

157
00:11:02,737 --> 00:11:03,876
Would like to feel.

158
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:07,380
Where is that here?

159
00:11:10,634 --> 00:11:11,867
It vibrates.

160
00:11:14,192 --> 00:11:16,825
And that coincides
with how you wear it.

161
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:23,852
Oh. I see that here:

162
00:11:24,948 --> 00:11:26,023
"a sensation."

163
00:11:26,326 --> 00:11:27,326
Yes.

164
00:11:27,785 --> 00:11:29,511
It explains its success.

165
00:11:30,569 --> 00:11:33,363
And it basically made me think
it was probably...

166
00:11:33,698 --> 00:11:35,408
Unrelated to weight loss.

167
00:11:36,772 --> 00:11:39,155
We now have a benefit.
Now we have to figure out

168
00:11:39,293 --> 00:11:41,266
how to put it into words.
Have another go at it.

169
00:11:41,419 --> 00:11:43,614
I will work on that, mr. Draper.

170
00:11:45,076 --> 00:11:48,126
Peggy, just think about it deeply.

171
00:11:49,749 --> 00:11:50,945
Then forget it,

172
00:11:51,449 --> 00:11:52,826
and an idea will...

173
00:11:54,063 --> 00:11:55,344
Jump up in your face.

174
00:11:57,585 --> 00:11:58,637
Thank you.

175
00:12:09,725 --> 00:12:11,638
Excuse me, ma'am.
I hate to bother you.

176
00:12:11,963 --> 00:12:13,946
I'm from the Frederick
Air Conditioning company,

177
00:12:14,188 --> 00:12:16,268
and I'd like to talk to you
about an opportunity

178
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:17,909
to live in frozen comfort.

179
00:12:18,564 --> 00:12:19,973
I'm not interested.

180
00:12:20,491 --> 00:12:22,417
Could I trouble you
for a glass of water?

181
00:12:23,221 --> 00:12:25,013
It's a scorcher out here.

182
00:12:28,762 --> 00:12:29,762
Of course.

183
00:12:30,826 --> 00:12:31,756
Thank you.

184
00:13:01,687 --> 00:13:02,762
Thank you.

185
00:13:03,021 --> 00:13:06,290
You know, we have many units
in all price ranges.

186
00:13:08,117 --> 00:13:09,127
What?

187
00:13:10,676 --> 00:13:12,296
Well, I'm married to a salesman.

188
00:13:13,219 --> 00:13:15,327
And I'm sure my husband and I can

189
00:13:16,301 --> 00:13:17,969
brave another week or however long

190
00:13:18,211 --> 00:13:19,889
this indian summer's going to be.

191
00:13:20,071 --> 00:13:22,055
Can I come back when he is here?

192
00:13:22,236 --> 00:13:23,683
I mean, a unit

193
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:26,014
here or in your living room--

194
00:13:26,169 --> 00:13:27,942
We wouldn't even have to
alter your window.

195
00:13:28,047 --> 00:13:30,102
We could just cut
a hole right above it.

196
00:13:31,103 --> 00:13:32,407
And see this gap?

197
00:13:32,681 --> 00:13:34,946
That's where your cool air,
whatever there is of it,

198
00:13:35,122 --> 00:13:36,279
is escaping.

199
00:13:36,814 --> 00:13:38,825
- From that little space?
- Yes.

200
00:13:39,053 --> 00:13:41,378
And there's a science
to how heat patterns work.

201
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:43,542
Now, what you need is a unit

202
00:13:44,404 --> 00:13:46,371
here downstairs and
one in your bedroom.

203
00:13:46,681 --> 00:13:48,759
That's if you have
the right construction.

204
00:13:49,784 --> 00:13:51,132
That would be nice.

205
00:13:53,485 --> 00:13:56,361
I can take down some numbers,
you know, measure everything.

206
00:13:56,657 --> 00:13:58,259
Write up an estimate--

207
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:02,152
Something you could discuss with
your husband when he comes home.

208
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:04,414
I guess that would be okay.

209
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:23,720
You know...

210
00:14:24,422 --> 00:14:25,533
My husband...

211
00:14:27,128 --> 00:14:29,082
I think he would rather go to sears.

212
00:14:30,784 --> 00:14:32,251
If that's what you want.

213
00:14:32,722 --> 00:14:33,844
You should go.

214
00:14:34,384 --> 00:14:35,997
I can just guess what
this would cost

215
00:14:36,103 --> 00:14:38,228
and put it on your door
for your husband comes home.

216
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:39,461
Please go.

217
00:14:56,059 --> 00:14:57,113
Fernando,

218
00:14:57,359 --> 00:15:00,260
we are pleased to hear that case
sales have more than doubled.

219
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,282
We still believe that most of
the credit goes to your rum.

220
00:15:03,948 --> 00:15:05,368
Say hello from me.

221
00:15:05,781 --> 00:15:08,893
Bert Cooper says it is a unique
pleasure working with you.

222
00:15:09,683 --> 00:15:11,290
I just finished trying to talk

223
00:15:11,532 --> 00:15:13,918
<i>Lucky Strike</i> off a ledge.

224
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,253
Junior or senior?

225
00:15:15,397 --> 00:15:16,212
Senior.

226
00:15:16,454 --> 00:15:19,799
He's coming for lunch tomorrow
to see if Roger is still involved.

227
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:22,254
And they're having this lunch
bedside, I suppose?

228
00:15:22,383 --> 00:15:24,565
I invited him here
to see for himself.

229
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,332
He called my bluff.

230
00:15:28,874 --> 00:15:30,060
Clear tomorrow.

231
00:15:31,439 --> 00:15:33,043
I need you to...

232
00:15:33,883 --> 00:15:36,107
draw focus from our guest of honor.

233
00:15:39,186 --> 00:15:42,107
Bernie Perel is number 2 in his class
at Columbia law school.

234
00:15:42,298 --> 00:15:43,848
He works with <i>Morgenthau</i>,

235
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:47,267
and having been captivated by him
at more than one cocktail party,

236
00:15:47,629 --> 00:15:48,629
he is a charmer.

237
00:15:48,819 --> 00:15:50,266
I can see he does something for you,

238
00:15:50,368 --> 00:15:52,172
but I don't know if
this is the right time.

239
00:15:52,602 --> 00:15:55,361
Because you're getting
so much younger every day?

240
00:15:56,091 --> 00:15:58,827
Because I don't know if my
heart would be in it.

241
00:15:59,638 --> 00:16:01,632
Are you seeing that goy?

242
00:16:03,191 --> 00:16:04,052
A little bit.

243
00:16:04,441 --> 00:16:07,513
Well, I told you
I wouldn't let that stop me.

244
00:16:08,154 --> 00:16:09,682
What if he were...

245
00:16:10,501 --> 00:16:11,517
You're mumbling.

246
00:16:13,724 --> 00:16:15,396
What if he were married?

247
00:16:16,292 --> 00:16:17,595
My goodness.

248
00:16:19,957 --> 00:16:20,777
Jesus.

249
00:16:21,805 --> 00:16:23,086
Nothing's happened.

250
00:16:23,255 --> 00:16:24,255
Good.

251
00:16:26,217 --> 00:16:28,330
But I have been thinking about it.

252
00:16:29,692 --> 00:16:31,489
The two of us together.

253
00:16:34,355 --> 00:16:36,375
It feels so natural.
I feel so close to him.

254
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:37,980
Really?

255
00:16:38,494 --> 00:16:40,588
He's married, but I don't
think he's happy.

256
00:16:40,983 --> 00:16:42,164
Obviously.

257
00:16:44,857 --> 00:16:46,784
What does it matter?
Nothing's going to happen.

258
00:16:46,886 --> 00:16:48,495
All I know is what I see
in the movies.

259
00:16:48,648 --> 00:16:51,407
It's magical, and
then they start talking

260
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,018
about him leaving his wife,
and then he doesn't.

261
00:16:54,829 --> 00:16:56,352
I saw this one
where the husband gets

262
00:16:56,591 --> 00:16:58,041
the woman pregnant so he kills her.

263
00:16:58,222 --> 00:17:00,206
You don't want to be that woman.

264
00:17:03,894 --> 00:17:05,040
Go ahead.

265
00:17:10,782 --> 00:17:13,538
Please. Whatever it says,
it's going to seem related to this.

266
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,748
"You are your own worst enemy."

267
00:17:17,207 --> 00:17:18,353
That's yours.

268
00:17:30,321 --> 00:17:31,666
You look tired.

269
00:17:32,934 --> 00:17:34,103
I am.

270
00:17:35,843 --> 00:17:37,505
You're working too much.

271
00:17:40,213 --> 00:17:41,406
No, it's just--

272
00:17:45,811 --> 00:17:46,833
Maybe.

273
00:17:53,144 --> 00:17:54,928
It's too hot in here anyway.

274
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,274
You know, we're losing
a lot of our cool air

275
00:18:07,403 --> 00:18:09,716
through the windows
in the dining room?

276
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,340
What?

277
00:18:13,752 --> 00:18:16,358
Nothing. It's just something
the salesman said.

278
00:18:17,635 --> 00:18:19,562
What was he doing
in the dining room?

279
00:18:20,915 --> 00:18:22,647
What are you talking about?

280
00:18:25,466 --> 00:18:27,222
You let a stranger in my house?

281
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,965
- Don't raise your voice.
- I damn well will raise my voice.

282
00:18:30,224 --> 00:18:32,619
Do you have any idea
what could have happened?

283
00:18:32,748 --> 00:18:34,660
I could have bought
an air conditioner.

284
00:18:35,387 --> 00:18:36,412
It's hot.

285
00:18:37,066 --> 00:18:39,485
Salesmen go into people's
homes every day.

286
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,061
It's like when you

287
00:18:41,414 --> 00:18:44,185
turn on a television set
and then you turn it off. It--

288
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:46,841
Look, you didn't want
to spend the money--

289
00:18:46,943 --> 00:18:48,062
Good night, Betty.

290
00:19:09,182 --> 00:19:11,448
I feel like I should make a speech.

291
00:19:12,794 --> 00:19:13,741
Get back to work.

292
00:19:16,629 --> 00:19:17,912
Welcome back. You look good.

293
00:19:19,821 --> 00:19:20,821
Honey.

294
00:19:21,432 --> 00:19:23,251
One hour. That's all you get.

295
00:19:25,786 --> 00:19:27,507
Now, you be a good boy.

296
00:19:30,663 --> 00:19:32,307
I shall be both dog and pony.

297
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:33,634
Come on.

298
00:19:37,831 --> 00:19:39,087
He looks like death.

299
00:19:39,252 --> 00:19:42,528
I know. His hair and his skin
are the same color.

300
00:19:43,834 --> 00:19:44,945
Not really.

301
00:19:49,099 --> 00:19:50,257
That's the spot--

302
00:19:51,191 --> 00:19:52,905
Exactly where it happened.

303
00:19:53,975 --> 00:19:55,074
I can still feel it.

304
00:20:03,256 --> 00:20:06,896
Miss holloway, we brought you here
because of your discretion.

305
00:20:08,545 --> 00:20:09,954
Can you help us with this?

306
00:20:10,138 --> 00:20:11,260
His color?

307
00:20:12,809 --> 00:20:13,884
Hey, honey.

308
00:20:16,542 --> 00:20:18,586
Well, you know,
we don't need Miami beach,

309
00:20:18,754 --> 00:20:20,391
but just do what you can do.

310
00:20:32,945 --> 00:20:34,197
Can I kiss you?

311
00:20:34,801 --> 00:20:36,774
I don't know if I can handle it.

312
00:20:53,703 --> 00:20:56,885
We should have done this
for nixon before the debates.

313
00:20:58,282 --> 00:21:01,635
The arrogance of that campaign.
It's infuriating.

314
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:04,366
Being the incumbent is even harder.

315
00:21:04,509 --> 00:21:07,105
You can't just sit on your ass
and look presidential.

316
00:21:07,535 --> 00:21:10,358
You probably shouldn't get so upset.
It's not good for you.

317
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:11,998
I missed you.

318
00:21:13,488 --> 00:21:14,404
You know that, right?

319
00:21:16,861 --> 00:21:18,352
I missed you, too.

320
00:21:19,622 --> 00:21:22,324
Joannie, Joannie,
look at that mouth.

321
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,290
You're not doing my lips.

322
00:21:27,213 --> 00:21:30,135
My rouge is too dark,
but I have this light lipstick.

323
00:21:31,526 --> 00:21:34,873
You going to draw freckles on me,
too, like <i>Raggedy Andy</i>*?

324
00:21:38,168 --> 00:21:41,808
Look, I want to tell you something
because you're very dear to me,

325
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:45,710
and I hope you understand
it comes from the bottom of my...

326
00:21:46,043 --> 00:21:47,603
Damaged, damaged heart.

327
00:21:52,863 --> 00:21:55,610
You are the finest
piece of ass I ever had,

328
00:21:56,153 --> 00:21:58,044
and I don't care who knows it.

329
00:21:59,385 --> 00:22:02,250
I am so glad I got to
roam those hillsides.

330
00:22:03,111 --> 00:22:04,744
- Stop it.
- I mean it.

331
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:09,196
I've had a lot of time to think
about the things I've done

332
00:22:09,587 --> 00:22:10,961
and been sorry about,

333
00:22:11,148 --> 00:22:13,004
and being with you
is not one of them.

334
00:22:20,336 --> 00:22:21,136
red.

335
00:22:25,688 --> 00:22:27,518
That's not what I wanted.

336
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:31,274
You look better.

337
00:22:48,994 --> 00:22:50,567
I should have come over.

338
00:22:52,686 --> 00:22:55,504
That's a silly idea. Damn it.

339
00:22:56,143 --> 00:22:59,071
Soon the milk stains are going
to meet the sweat stains.

340
00:23:02,543 --> 00:23:04,680
Should we get out of here
and let her sleep?

341
00:23:04,993 --> 00:23:07,951
I'd love to, but the door's
noisier than our talking.

342
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:11,206
She's actually a good sleeper,
thank God,

343
00:23:11,419 --> 00:23:13,051
even with the heat rash.

344
00:23:13,889 --> 00:23:14,941
Poor thing.

345
00:23:15,448 --> 00:23:17,679
And it actually
gets hotter at night.

346
00:23:19,413 --> 00:23:21,352
Did you think about
buying an air conditioner

347
00:23:21,481 --> 00:23:22,990
from that pushy young man yesterday?

348
00:23:23,414 --> 00:23:25,164
Is that what he was selling?

349
00:23:27,028 --> 00:23:29,811
He looked like one
of Carlton's squash buddies.

350
00:23:30,907 --> 00:23:32,667
Made me sorry I answered the door.

351
00:23:33,256 --> 00:23:34,719
He was very pushy.

352
00:23:35,485 --> 00:23:37,833
He came in and started
measuring things.

353
00:23:38,839 --> 00:23:40,620
Don was not happy about that.

354
00:23:40,796 --> 00:23:41,676
Don was there?

355
00:23:41,947 --> 00:23:42,947
No.

356
00:23:46,935 --> 00:23:48,743
Carlton would break my arm.

357
00:23:51,081 --> 00:23:53,054
It was foolish letting him in.

358
00:24:01,446 --> 00:24:03,142
Why would you tell him?

359
00:24:06,505 --> 00:24:07,839
It just came up.

360
00:24:11,259 --> 00:24:12,602
I wasn't thinking.

361
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:14,184
What did he do?

362
00:24:14,341 --> 00:24:15,550
What do you think?

363
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:17,110
He lost his temper.

364
00:24:20,631 --> 00:24:22,129
He's very protective.

365
00:24:26,364 --> 00:24:29,312
Just as you requested,
a little of our local color:

366
00:24:29,636 --> 00:24:31,976
Pastrami, Coleslaw, sour pickles.

367
00:24:32,885 --> 00:24:34,130
I like it.

368
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:36,230
It's Yankee barbecue.

369
00:24:43,897 --> 00:24:45,156
They're all ours.

370
00:24:47,426 --> 00:24:48,940
Here they are now.

371
00:24:50,885 --> 00:24:52,482
- Hello, Lee.
- Hello, Don.

372
00:24:52,693 --> 00:24:53,821
- Lee
- Preston.

373
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:55,280
Jimmy, Preston,

374
00:24:55,755 --> 00:24:56,834
how do you do?

375
00:24:58,786 --> 00:24:59,891
It's wonderful to see you.

376
00:25:00,604 --> 00:25:03,841
Well, from what I hear, you boys had
all but given me up for dead.

377
00:25:04,083 --> 00:25:07,180
I don't think it's wrong
for us to express our concern

378
00:25:07,522 --> 00:25:08,638
for your well-being.

379
00:25:09,927 --> 00:25:12,651
Well, I know how much
you love your delicatessen.

380
00:25:13,852 --> 00:25:16,094
But I know
there's also something else

381
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:17,838
you want to discuss.

382
00:25:18,473 --> 00:25:20,316
You're worried
about losing the lawsuit?

383
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,735
There were no damages.

384
00:25:23,131 --> 00:25:24,411
But we lost.

385
00:25:24,584 --> 00:25:25,958
But there were no damages.

386
00:25:26,145 --> 00:25:28,270
Blame is one thing,
malice is another.

387
00:25:28,484 --> 00:25:29,534
I worked my way

388
00:25:29,776 --> 00:25:31,903
inside and out of the <i>F.T.C.</i>*

389
00:25:32,619 --> 00:25:34,205
Bought a lot of dinners
in Washington.

390
00:25:36,495 --> 00:25:37,750
You can't fight them.

391
00:25:38,178 --> 00:25:40,753
- That's what lawyers are for.
- Lawyers?

392
00:25:41,541 --> 00:25:44,006
I've seen a girl fight harder
on her first date

393
00:25:44,246 --> 00:25:45,971
than these beltway shuttlecocks.

394
00:25:49,237 --> 00:25:52,040
Listen, I'm a stockholder,
so I called Chester Conrad

395
00:25:52,142 --> 00:25:53,620
in the surgeon general's office,

396
00:25:53,722 --> 00:25:55,763
and he assured me it would
be at least three years

397
00:25:55,814 --> 00:25:57,255
before they could compile a report.

398
00:25:57,474 --> 00:25:59,129
But legislation is in progress.

399
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:00,356
We hear another year

400
00:26:00,598 --> 00:26:01,963
or two beyond that, they speculate

401
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,300
they're going to put warning
signs on the packages.

402
00:26:04,492 --> 00:26:07,146
There's still plenty of time before
we have to worry about that,

403
00:26:07,355 --> 00:26:08,379
during which

404
00:26:08,711 --> 00:26:10,274
we wait to see if share drops off

405
00:26:10,473 --> 00:26:13,035
before we run for The Hills
looking for a new campaign.

406
00:26:14,713 --> 00:26:17,061
- Is that true?
- Well, it must be.

407
00:26:17,356 --> 00:26:18,583
He just said it.

408
00:26:20,572 --> 00:26:22,754
Well, I've been spending
a lot of time with my wife.

409
00:26:25,854 --> 00:26:27,375
I'm glad we came by.

410
00:26:28,161 --> 00:26:29,147
I missed you all.

411
00:26:30,228 --> 00:26:31,971
You New Yorkers.

412
00:26:35,073 --> 00:26:36,306
To New Yorkers.

413
00:26:36,867 --> 00:26:38,123
May they always--

414
00:26:40,573 --> 00:26:42,113
Jesus. No again.

415
00:26:42,804 --> 00:26:43,806
Are you okay?

416
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:46,048
Just give him some air.
Give him some air.

417
00:26:46,776 --> 00:26:47,936
Give him air.

418
00:26:56,637 --> 00:26:57,780
- I'm okay.
- Don't talk.

419
00:26:57,907 --> 00:26:59,539
This was stupid.
I'll get the elevator.

420
00:26:59,656 --> 00:27:01,795
No, they're holding the elevator.

421
00:27:04,264 --> 00:27:05,264
I'm very sorry.

422
00:27:13,277 --> 00:27:16,849
Mona, sweetheart,
this was a mistake.

423
00:27:17,185 --> 00:27:20,061
I tried to talk him out of it,
but you people.

424
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,772
Mrs. Sterling, I had no idea.

425
00:27:23,959 --> 00:27:27,575
I used to think you couldn't put
a value on a human life,

426
00:27:27,845 --> 00:27:29,445
but I never asked
Bert Cooper, did i?

427
00:27:29,724 --> 00:27:31,803
- Sweetheart--
- Go to hell, Bert.

428
00:27:41,332 --> 00:27:44,630
I don't need to tell you that
Don has everything under control.

429
00:27:45,022 --> 00:27:46,144
I don't know.

430
00:27:46,892 --> 00:27:48,246
Without Sterling--

431
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:52,301
I may have a family business,
but I'm not an autocrat.

432
00:27:53,007 --> 00:27:54,311
I have a board,

433
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:59,959
and my son wants to be the executive
of an aluminum company.

434
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:02,478
Still, your board

435
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,190
should give credit
where credit is due.

436
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:07,951
Share?

437
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:10,968
We all like don draper,

438
00:28:12,182 --> 00:28:16,397
but if I was you, i'd find some way
to show him that you all do, too.

439
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:19,900
He's a dead man, you know,
even if he survives.

440
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:22,206
What are you talking about?
Most clients will put up

441
00:28:22,448 --> 00:28:25,585
with one coronary from a partner.
Cost of doing business. Two?

442
00:28:26,263 --> 00:28:27,538
Are we going down?

443
00:28:27,837 --> 00:28:30,381
I wrote, prepared, and sent out
my resume this afternoon,

444
00:28:30,819 --> 00:28:32,467
at company expense.

445
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:36,035
Look, it doesn't take a genius
to see what's going to happen.

446
00:28:36,088 --> 00:28:38,621
They'll bump draper up to partner.
Everyone will fall in line.

447
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,611
Draper.

448
00:28:39,714 --> 00:28:41,922
It would have happened a long time
ago if they weren't so greedy.

449
00:28:42,074 --> 00:28:43,757
They're already paying him
his weight in gold.

450
00:28:43,899 --> 00:28:45,980
Half the accounts at
this agency came for draper.

451
00:28:46,643 --> 00:28:48,551
Frank Birmingham brings
in a lot of accounts.

452
00:28:48,716 --> 00:28:50,412
Come on. You sit in
that conference room.

453
00:28:50,537 --> 00:28:52,145
Frank Birmingham brings them in,

454
00:28:52,368 --> 00:28:54,989
and while they're dozing off,
don goes through their wallets.

455
00:28:56,451 --> 00:28:58,024
What about Mitch Sullivan in media?

456
00:28:58,176 --> 00:29:00,328
He's fat, bald, and charmless.

457
00:29:01,529 --> 00:29:03,184
You think draper likes me?

458
00:29:03,873 --> 00:29:05,716
He rides me pretty hard sometimes.

459
00:29:05,953 --> 00:29:08,299
- It's hard to tell with him.
- He *** likes you.

460
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,380
- I work at it.
- I work at it, too.

461
00:29:10,622 --> 00:29:11,954
I can tell you do.

462
00:29:12,072 --> 00:29:14,103
You never know when he's doing it.

463
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,642
There's not a man in this room

464
00:29:16,817 --> 00:29:20,014
who's not holding don draper on their
shoulders so that he can reach partner.

465
00:29:20,861 --> 00:29:22,212
He's not going to fire you.

466
00:29:22,642 --> 00:29:24,519
- Who said anything about that?
- No one.

467
00:29:24,761 --> 00:29:26,938
It's just-- You don't think
he deserves it, do you?

468
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:32,541
Don't you know anything about
business, cleaning out the old guys?

469
00:29:32,754 --> 00:29:34,904
It's good for us. It opens up spots.

470
00:29:38,045 --> 00:29:40,288
My ma, she wouldn't shut up
about you.

471
00:29:41,088 --> 00:29:42,370
I told her I remembered you.

472
00:29:43,174 --> 00:29:44,496
Isn't that nice?

473
00:29:48,251 --> 00:29:50,253
- You smoke.
- All the time.

474
00:29:51,304 --> 00:29:53,828
It's practically mandatory
in our office.

475
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:02,662
Thank you.

476
00:30:04,897 --> 00:30:06,881
Brandy Alexander <i>forla donna</i>,

477
00:30:07,715 --> 00:30:09,018
and a <i>Rheingold</i>.

478
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,480
What, you don't like it?
I'll send it back.

479
00:30:17,745 --> 00:30:19,778
Well, my friend Joan always
orders them for me.

480
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:21,409
They're usually sweeter.

481
00:30:25,249 --> 00:30:26,581
She's a scream.

482
00:30:27,216 --> 00:30:28,719
She lives in the city.

483
00:30:32,253 --> 00:30:33,129
There's a bar

484
00:30:33,371 --> 00:30:35,465
in Manhattan where
the glasses are chilled.

485
00:30:38,502 --> 00:30:39,302
What's in that?

486
00:30:39,769 --> 00:30:40,803
I don't know.

487
00:30:46,924 --> 00:30:48,561
So you drive a truck.

488
00:30:49,601 --> 00:30:50,601
Yes.

489
00:30:51,536 --> 00:30:53,215
But I bought my own route.

490
00:30:54,355 --> 00:30:55,359
Wise potato chips.

491
00:30:56,039 --> 00:30:57,039
Really?

492
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,311
I have an area that's just mine.

493
00:31:02,349 --> 00:31:05,457
The route was expensive, but the
hard part was learning that truck.

494
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,914
Special license.

495
00:31:08,442 --> 00:31:10,958
We have a potato chip account: <i>UTZ</i>*.

496
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,044
- You get free ones?
- I do.

497
00:31:13,345 --> 00:31:15,254
I don't know.
I don't like potato chips.

498
00:31:17,206 --> 00:31:18,466
You live out here, right?

499
00:31:18,946 --> 00:31:21,201
Prospect park.
I have my own apartment.

500
00:31:21,482 --> 00:31:24,088
Well, I share it with
my roommate Marjorie.

501
00:31:24,889 --> 00:31:26,182
She's a character.

502
00:31:32,388 --> 00:31:36,067
My sister's a secretary
for <i>Bulova</i>* in Flushing.

503
00:31:37,887 --> 00:31:40,341
I just got a new account
the other day.

504
00:31:41,127 --> 00:31:43,487
I already wrote copy for
<i>Belle Jolie</i> lipsticks.

505
00:31:44,004 --> 00:31:45,932
It's going to be in
a bunch of magazines.

506
00:31:46,011 --> 00:31:46,911
Which ones?

507
00:31:47,153 --> 00:31:49,664
I don't think you read them.
They're about high fashion.

508
00:31:51,904 --> 00:31:53,900
Advertising doesn't work on me.

509
00:31:54,356 --> 00:31:57,174
It's just a lot of people screaming
at you from the walls and the tv.

510
00:31:58,927 --> 00:32:01,259
If advertising is good,
people never think it works.

511
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:04,262
How do they know it does?
Did they ever prove that?

512
00:32:06,193 --> 00:32:08,057
Why are you insulting what I do?

513
00:32:09,841 --> 00:32:11,352
"So you drive a truck."

514
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,439
You do.

515
00:32:14,825 --> 00:32:16,274
I'm my own boss, you know?

516
00:32:16,711 --> 00:32:18,109
You get off the train every day

517
00:32:18,351 --> 00:32:20,724
at Grand Central, and
they spray you with gold?

518
00:32:20,958 --> 00:32:21,980
Let me tell you,

519
00:32:22,573 --> 00:32:24,797
you can act like
you're from Manhattan,

520
00:32:24,973 --> 00:32:26,951
but you don't look like those girls.

521
00:32:37,574 --> 00:32:38,713
Hey, hold on.

522
00:32:39,628 --> 00:32:40,673
That wasn't nice.

523
00:32:40,915 --> 00:32:42,008
I feel sorry for you.

524
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:43,426
I said I'm sorry.

525
00:32:47,554 --> 00:32:49,668
Those people? In Manhattan?

526
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:52,835
They are better than us,

527
00:32:53,762 --> 00:32:55,938
because they want things
they haven't seen.

528
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:20,171
I'll be up.
I want to check on Roger.

529
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:35,279
- <i>Hello.</i>
- Hello. It's don draper.

530
00:33:36,354 --> 00:33:37,730
What can I do for you?

531
00:33:37,972 --> 00:33:39,816
I don't know what you do for anybody.

532
00:33:41,135 --> 00:33:43,903
- Mr. Draper, you sound hostile.
- <i>After hundreds of dollars,</i>

533
00:33:44,145 --> 00:33:47,031
all you've managed to do
is make her more unhappy.

534
00:33:48,524 --> 00:33:50,466
I understand
this is frustrating for you.

535
00:33:50,967 --> 00:33:53,327
This has nothing
to do with me. It's her.

536
00:33:53,856 --> 00:33:55,676
You took a woman with
a bad case of nerves,

537
00:33:55,829 --> 00:33:58,330
and you made her weaker,
not stronger.

538
00:33:59,955 --> 00:34:01,379
I'm afraid to leave her alone.

539
00:34:02,677 --> 00:34:06,411
All I can say is that it's
a process, and time is part of it.

540
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:09,554
If you'd like to expedite things,
we can put her in psychoanalysis.

541
00:34:10,106 --> 00:34:13,534
- What are you doing now?
- <i>Psychoanalytic psychotherapy.</i>

542
00:34:13,766 --> 00:34:16,584
<i>Psychoanalysis would mean
a minimum of three sessions a week</i>

543
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,263
<i>and optimally five.</i>

544
00:34:20,688 --> 00:34:21,688
Thank you.

545
00:34:22,308 --> 00:34:23,843
I'll think about that.

546
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:36,623
Over there.

547
00:34:37,683 --> 00:34:38,583
There's no chair.

548
00:34:48,151 --> 00:34:50,511
I really wish I could have
come in and prepared first.

549
00:34:50,851 --> 00:34:52,138
Sorry. This is the way it works.

550
00:34:53,176 --> 00:34:54,307
Of course.

551
00:34:57,861 --> 00:34:59,694
I only have one and a carbon.

552
00:34:59,965 --> 00:35:02,050
That's all I had time to do.
you'll have to share.

553
00:35:02,598 --> 00:35:04,442
Come on. Just give it
to one of the girls.

554
00:35:11,738 --> 00:35:13,162
Ready when you are.

555
00:35:16,049 --> 00:35:19,044
women lose weight so they'll feel
good about themselves:

556
00:35:19,778 --> 00:35:21,927
healthier, more attractive.

557
00:35:23,723 --> 00:35:24,962
rejuvenate has a latin root

558
00:35:25,204 --> 00:35:27,955
which literally means
"The return of youth."

559
00:35:29,004 --> 00:35:32,574
The Rejuvenator gives you
the flush and glow

560
00:35:33,031 --> 00:35:35,826
not only that you might have
after hours of exercise

561
00:35:36,072 --> 00:35:38,561
but certainly as a young girl.

562
00:35:39,463 --> 00:35:40,653
isn't it nice

563
00:35:41,095 --> 00:35:42,995
to feel that way whenever you want?

564
00:35:44,335 --> 00:35:47,740
combined with a sensible diet,
the Rejuvenator.

565
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,947
you'll love the way it makes you feel.

566
00:35:56,614 --> 00:35:58,996
look, i'm not going to wait to see
how don lands on this.

567
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:01,888
i'm going to tell you it's good.

568
00:36:02,241 --> 00:36:03,784
nice end run around the weight loss.

569
00:36:04,058 --> 00:36:06,683
I think it's good, too.
but what does it do?

570
00:36:14,126 --> 00:36:16,287
from what I understand, it provides

571
00:36:16,839 --> 00:36:19,142
the pleasure of a man
without the man.

572
00:36:21,025 --> 00:36:22,528
we've been replaced?

573
00:36:23,596 --> 00:36:26,429
that's why Mitch's wife
didn't want to take it off.

574
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:29,569
I'd love to see her in that.

575
00:36:30,351 --> 00:36:32,019
She's already so hot to trot.

576
00:36:32,183 --> 00:36:35,470
4th of july, that gingham halter
with the knot at the bottom.

577
00:36:35,585 --> 00:36:37,521
- She was falling out of it.
- Jayne Mansfield.

578
00:36:40,009 --> 00:36:41,831
Mitch's wife is very attractive.

579
00:36:42,542 --> 00:36:44,092
I don't know her.

580
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:46,690
First of all, no latin.

581
00:36:46,947 --> 00:36:48,720
You sound like a valedictorian.

582
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:50,923
and the name still isn't right.

583
00:36:52,303 --> 00:36:53,051
Lastly,

584
00:36:53,293 --> 00:36:55,887
you still might need to give us
a hint at what it does.

585
00:36:58,555 --> 00:37:00,238
I could be more explicit.

586
00:37:00,554 --> 00:37:03,739
I was thinking of calling
it stimulating.

587
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:06,494
I think you need, like, a code word,

588
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:08,878
like-- I don't know.

589
00:37:09,626 --> 00:37:10,693
like refreshing.

590
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:12,487
i'll think about that.

591
00:37:12,873 --> 00:37:15,239
My God. Freddie,
doesn't your wife have one?

592
00:37:16,425 --> 00:37:17,617
What's your point, Ken?

593
00:37:17,859 --> 00:37:20,232
My point is didn't
you say she loved it?

594
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:21,904
That's funny.

595
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:28,252
You know what to do here.

596
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:30,755
I'll get arrested just
doing the layouts.

597
00:37:32,803 --> 00:37:33,803
Now...

598
00:37:34,524 --> 00:37:35,928
that wasn't so bad.

599
00:37:41,495 --> 00:37:42,975
looks like everybody liked it.

600
00:37:44,492 --> 00:37:45,492
I can tell.

601
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:51,484
Freddie's wife does not look
like Mitch's,

602
00:37:51,726 --> 00:37:52,587
you know.

603
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:57,615
Good work, Pegs.

604
00:39:43,008 --> 00:39:43,930
Come in.

605
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:50,418
Mr. Draper, I don't want to
seem ungrateful,

606
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:52,647
but I think I could serve
<i>Sterling-Cooper</i> and you

607
00:39:52,779 --> 00:39:54,941
better as a copywriter if
I had my own desk.

608
00:39:55,673 --> 00:39:56,651
You have a desk.

609
00:39:58,977 --> 00:40:00,738
But now I have radio spots.

610
00:40:01,521 --> 00:40:04,921
Peggy, the conversation of
a raise is not inappropriate

611
00:40:05,362 --> 00:40:07,495
at this moment, but do not be timid.

612
00:40:08,519 --> 00:40:09,664
You presented like a man.

613
00:40:09,906 --> 00:40:11,374
now act like one.

614
00:40:13,183 --> 00:40:14,627
I want $5.00 a week more.

615
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:17,296
Jesus, what do you make?

616
00:40:18,224 --> 00:40:19,632
$35 a week.

617
00:40:20,437 --> 00:40:22,927
Well, that's a 15% kick.

618
00:40:24,696 --> 00:40:26,762
Don, a word.

619
00:40:38,263 --> 00:40:40,994
Cooper and Draper just went into
Sterling's office. Tell me when

620
00:40:41,173 --> 00:40:42,562
they come out of there, will you?

621
00:40:42,828 --> 00:40:45,438
sure. I'll just sit here
and watch the door.

622
00:40:45,973 --> 00:40:46,987
That's all I'll do.

623
00:40:47,147 --> 00:40:49,358
Who the hell do you think
you're talking to?

624
00:40:58,512 --> 00:40:59,505
is he dead?

625
00:40:59,991 --> 00:41:03,342
No. Quite the opposite.
They let him go home to convalesce.

626
00:41:04,243 --> 00:41:05,053
And?

627
00:41:06,821 --> 00:41:08,431
I want to make you a partner.

628
00:41:12,664 --> 00:41:15,959
As a symbolic gesture, I think telling
me that in here is in bad taste.

629
00:41:16,347 --> 00:41:18,677
That's the way it works.
Roger knows that.

630
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:21,440
i'm not adding your name
to the masthead.

631
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:24,197
I'm restoring faith to our clients.

632
00:41:25,821 --> 00:41:26,657
I accept.

633
00:41:27,162 --> 00:41:30,655
I'll start you at 12% and see how
both you and Roger do.

634
00:41:30,836 --> 00:41:32,622
of course you'll remain
Creative director,

635
00:41:32,864 --> 00:41:36,876
and to fill the position of head
of Account services,

636
00:41:37,118 --> 00:41:39,837
you are the only member of
the <i>Blue Ribbon committee</i>.

637
00:41:41,127 --> 00:41:42,590
Do I hire from inside or outside?

638
00:41:43,472 --> 00:41:47,136
I just made you partner.
Do I have to do everything?

639
00:41:47,848 --> 00:41:49,013
No contract.

640
00:41:53,482 --> 00:41:54,977
Of course you'd say that.

641
00:41:55,541 --> 00:41:57,682
Beware the nonconformist.

642
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:05,384
I'm going to introduce
you to Miss Ayn Rand.

643
00:42:06,355 --> 00:42:07,865
I think she'll salivate.

644
00:42:22,803 --> 00:42:24,006
is he dead?

645
00:42:27,365 --> 00:42:29,008
So when's he coming back?

646
00:42:31,992 --> 00:42:34,100
You know, I think this office
is too big for me.

647
00:42:35,356 --> 00:42:36,812
I might need it if I'm going to lure

648
00:42:37,009 --> 00:42:39,272
in Marty Brennen as
head of Account services.

649
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,482
Then it's true. Congratulations.

650
00:42:42,298 --> 00:42:43,401
- Thank you.
- I mean it.

651
00:42:44,638 --> 00:42:45,820
You know I admire your work.

652
00:42:46,879 --> 00:42:49,323
- I believe you.
- I hope you do.

653
00:42:50,268 --> 00:42:53,244
and I don't think it can be denied
that we make a very good team.

654
00:42:56,967 --> 00:42:58,152
You know what?

655
00:42:59,857 --> 00:43:01,406
I do like this office.

656
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:03,465
I think Roger would want
me to have it.

657
00:43:03,574 --> 00:43:06,212
that way he'll always know
he can have it back.

658
00:43:06,532 --> 00:43:09,343
I hope you're aware that I'd love
to throw my hat in the ring.

659
00:43:11,412 --> 00:43:12,466
I am now.

660
00:43:27,401 --> 00:43:29,226
Peggy, we have both
had very good days.

661
00:43:29,865 --> 00:43:30,865
i'm working on it.

662
00:43:30,866 --> 00:43:32,107
You may leave your post.

663
00:43:33,403 --> 00:43:34,619
It's 4:30.

664
00:43:35,201 --> 00:43:37,275
I'm sorry. That's the best
I can do at this point.

665
00:43:38,187 --> 00:43:39,624
I have work to do.

666
00:43:41,274 --> 00:43:42,823
you can have your raise.

667
00:43:44,183 --> 00:43:46,859
And I'll talk to Miss Holloway about
getting someone on your desk

668
00:43:47,010 --> 00:43:49,113
while you attend to your assignment.

669
00:43:49,972 --> 00:43:51,010
Can I tell her?

670
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:52,580
Sure.

671
00:43:53,379 --> 00:43:55,183
In the meantime,
go with your friends.

672
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:56,892
Celebrate.

673
00:43:57,542 --> 00:43:58,750
Good night, Mr. Draper.

674
00:44:14,618 --> 00:44:15,813
Good night.

675
00:45:47,273 --> 00:45:48,945
Back away from the set. Come on.

676
00:45:49,273 --> 00:45:50,747
you'll burn your eyes out.

677
00:45:51,566 --> 00:45:52,715
hi, daddy.

678
00:45:55,369 --> 00:45:59,356
I would have made you dinner, but I
called the office, and no one answered.

679
00:46:00,545 --> 00:46:02,057
Should I fix something?

680
00:46:02,316 --> 00:46:06,088
No. I was supposed to have a meeting
with a client, but it got cancelled.

681
00:46:16,563 --> 00:46:17,740
I got made partner.

682
00:46:19,058 --> 00:46:21,866
My god. Don, that's wonderful.

683
00:46:27,544 --> 00:46:30,253
Don, you were right about
letting people in the house.

684
00:46:30,881 --> 00:46:31,982
i'm so sorry.

685
00:46:36,037 --> 00:46:37,972
I don't want to talk about that.

686
00:46:48,848 --> 00:46:50,565
The heat's supposed
to break tomorrow.

687
00:46:51,423 --> 00:46:53,568
It'll probably be snowing
in two weeks.
