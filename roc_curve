    """Compute Receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
    Note: this implementation is restricted to the binary classification task.
    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <roc_metrics>`.
    Parameters
    ----------
    y_true : array, shape = [n_samples]
        True binary labels. If labels are not either {-1, 1} or {0, 1}, then
        pos_label should be explicitly given.
    y_score : array, shape = [n_samples]
        Target scores, can either be probability estimates of the positive
        class, confidence values, or non-thresholded measure of decisions
        (as returned by "decision_function" on some classifiers).
    pos_label : int or str, default=None
        The label of the positive class.
        When ``pos_label=None``, if y_true is in {-1, 1} or {0, 1},
        ``pos_label`` is set to 1, otherwise an error will be raised.
    sample_weight : array-like of shape (n_samples,), default=None
        Sample weights.
    drop_intermediate : boolean, optional (default=True)
        Whether to drop some suboptimal thresholds which would not appear
        on a plotted ROC curve. This is useful in order to create lighter
        ROC curves.
        .. versionadded:: 0.17
           parameter *drop_intermediate*.
    Returns
    -------
    fpr : array, shape = [>2]
        Increasing false positive rates such that element i is the false
        positive rate of predictions with score >= thresholds[i].
    tpr : array, shape = [>2]
        Increasing true positive rates such that element i is the true
        positive rate of predictions with score >= thresholds[i].
    thresholds : array, shape = [n_thresholds]
        Decreasing thresholds on the decision function used to compute
        fpr and tpr. `thresholds[0]` represents no instances being predicted
        and is arbitrarily set to `max(y_score) + 1`.

    roc_auc_score : Compute the area under the ROC curve
    Notes
    -----
    Since the thresholds are sorted from low to high values, they
    are reversed upon returning them to ensure they correspond to both ``fpr``
    and ``tpr``, which are sorted in reversed order during their calculation.
