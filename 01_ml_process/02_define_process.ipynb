    "In Entry 1, I decided to take the smallest problem I could find and solve just one aspect. Only after I've solved that single problem am I allowed to move on to the next. Jason Brownlee of [Machine Learning Mastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/start-here/) recommends small projects that take [no more than 5-15 hours](https://machinelearningmastery.com/self-study-machine-learning-projects/) from inception to presentation of the results. He also points out that with a good process in place, a specific problem can be addressed in [1-2 hours](https://machinelearningmastery.com/practice-machine-learning-with-small-in-memory-datasets-from-the-uci-machine-learning-repository/).\n",

One half was graded on the quantity of photos they produced: 100 photos = A, 90 photos = B, etc. The other half was graded on quality: only one photo had to be submitted, but it had to be as close to perfect as possible. The quantity group outperformed the quality group hands down because they spent the semester trying things out and learning by doing. The quality group got so focused on what constituted a good photo that they didn't actually take many photographs.
