1
00:00:07,891 --> 00:00:10,894
You unlock this door
with the key of imagination.

2
00:00:10,929 --> 00:00:13,279
Beyond it is another dimension-

3
00:00:13,314 --> 00:00:14,280
a dimension of sound,

4
00:00:15,567 --> 00:00:17,534
a dimension of sight,

5
00:00:17,569 --> 00:00:19,536
a dimension of mind.

6
00:00:19,571 --> 00:00:22,288
You're moving into a land
of both shadow and substance,

7
00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:24,040
of things and ideas.

8
00:00:24,075 --> 00:00:27,794
You've just crossed over
into the twilight zone.

9
00:01:24,636 --> 00:01:26,352
Hello?

10
00:01:31,357 --> 00:01:34,110
I'm sorry, i didn't hear.

11
00:01:34,145 --> 00:01:35,612
The thunder.

12
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:38,865
Hello?

13
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:44,370
Who's on the line, please?

14
00:02:07,295 --> 00:02:09,512
Hello?

15
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:13,516
Hello?

16
00:02:21,157 --> 00:02:22,659
Miss elva keene

17
00:02:22,694 --> 00:02:26,162
lives alone on the outskirts
of london flats,

18
00:02:26,197 --> 00:02:28,665
a tiny rural community in maine.

19
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,917
Up until now, the pattern
of miss keene's existence

20
00:02:30,952 --> 00:02:33,169
has been
that of lying in her bed

21
00:02:33,204 --> 00:02:35,922
or sitting in her wheelchair
reading books,

22
00:02:35,957 --> 00:02:37,423
listening to a radio,

23
00:02:37,674 --> 00:02:39,676
eating, napping,
taking medication

24
00:02:39,711 --> 00:02:42,795
and waiting for
something different to happen.

25
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,547
Miss keene doesn't know it yet

26
00:02:44,582 --> 00:02:46,799
but her period of waiting
has just ended,

27
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:49,552
for something different
is about to happen to her,

28
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:51,804
has, in fact,
already begun to happen

29
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:54,057
via two most unaccountable
telephone calls

30
00:02:54,092 --> 00:02:56,059
in the middle of a stormy night.

31
00:02:56,094 --> 00:02:59,062
Telephone calls
routed directly through

32
00:02:59,097 --> 00:03:02,315
the twilight zone.

33
00:03:50,246 --> 00:03:52,248
Hello?

34
00:03:53,249 --> 00:03:54,751
Hello?

35
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:04,761
Hello?

36
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:07,764
Hello!

37
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:09,766
Up early this morning.

38
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:11,768
What's the matter
with her?

39
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:13,519
No answer?

40
00:04:13,554 --> 00:04:14,771
Obviously.

41
00:04:14,806 --> 00:04:17,023
I imagine they're
pretty busy there

42
00:04:17,273 --> 00:04:19,525
this morning
with the storm and all.

43
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,526
Oh, miss finch?

44
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:22,779
This is elva keene
speaking.

45
00:04:22,814 --> 00:04:24,530
Yes, miss keene, can i help you?

46
00:04:24,565 --> 00:04:25,531
You can.

47
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:27,283
Last night about 2:00 a.m.

48
00:04:27,318 --> 00:04:28,534
My telephone rang.

49
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:31,037
I answered it, but no one spoke.

50
00:04:31,072 --> 00:04:34,290
I didn't even hear
the receiver being put down.

51
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,043
Not even a dial tone,
just silence!

52
00:04:37,078 --> 00:04:38,044
Well...

53
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:39,545
the same thing happened

54
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,797
a few moments later.

55
00:04:40,832 --> 00:04:42,048
Well, miss keene,

56
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:44,550
that storm just about ruined
our service.

57
00:04:44,801 --> 00:04:46,803
We've been flooded
with complaints

58
00:04:46,838 --> 00:04:49,555
about fallen wires
and bad connections.

59
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:52,058
I'd say you're pretty lucky
your telephone works at all.

60
00:04:52,308 --> 00:04:54,811
Would you say someone
was trying to call me

61
00:04:54,846 --> 00:04:57,063
and the connection was bad
because of the storm?

62
00:04:57,313 --> 00:05:01,317
That's as good an explanation
as any right now, miss keene.

63
00:05:01,352 --> 00:05:04,070
I'm sorry,
i wish i could be of more help

64
00:05:04,105 --> 00:05:06,823
but, oh,
the way things are right now!

65
00:05:06,858 --> 00:05:09,075
Well, is it likely
to happen again?

66
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:12,078
Well, i couldn't say,
miss keene, it might.

67
00:05:12,113 --> 00:05:14,947
It depends on what's causing it,
of course.

68
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:17,200
If it does, though,
you just call me

69
00:05:17,235 --> 00:05:19,952
and i'll have a special check
run on it.

70
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:21,204
Will you do that?

71
00:05:21,239 --> 00:05:22,205
Oh, very well.

72
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,707
Good. I'll wait
to hear from you, then.

73
00:05:24,742 --> 00:05:26,209
Good-bye, miss keene.

74
00:05:26,244 --> 00:05:27,460
Good-bye.

75
00:05:30,713 --> 00:05:32,215
Margaret?

76
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,716
Yes, miss keene?

77
00:05:33,751 --> 00:05:35,718
Did you call me
last night?

78
00:05:35,753 --> 00:05:37,970
At 2:00
in the morning?

79
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:39,722
Huh, no, ma'am,
not me.

80
00:05:39,757 --> 00:05:41,724
Well, you might have checked.

81
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,228
But i don't pay you for nights,
do i?

82
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:03,379
Here's your mail,
miss keene.

83
00:06:03,414 --> 00:06:05,381
Oh, thank you.

84
00:06:08,384 --> 00:06:10,386
An advertisement.

85
00:06:10,421 --> 00:06:12,138
Another advertisement.

86
00:06:12,173 --> 00:06:13,890
The light bill.

87
00:06:13,925 --> 00:06:15,892
Oh, how stimulating.

88
00:06:15,927 --> 00:06:17,894
You just heard
from your sister

89
00:06:17,929 --> 00:06:19,645
a few days ago,
didn't you?

90
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,646
Three weeks.

91
00:06:20,681 --> 00:06:22,398
Three weeks and two days

92
00:06:22,433 --> 00:06:24,150
to be exact, margaret.

93
00:06:24,185 --> 00:06:26,152
Has it been
that long?

94
00:06:26,187 --> 00:06:27,403
Yes, it has.

95
00:06:27,438 --> 00:06:30,156
Nobody cares
whether i live or die.

96
00:06:30,191 --> 00:06:32,158
Oh, sure, they do,
miss keene.

97
00:06:32,193 --> 00:06:33,659
You don't understand.

98
00:06:33,694 --> 00:06:36,412
You don't know
what it's like to be alone.

99
00:06:36,447 --> 00:06:38,164
Oh, now, miss keene.

100
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:47,924
Hello?

101
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:59,185
Hello?

102
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:04,941
Margaret?

103
00:07:04,976 --> 00:07:06,943
Come here, quickly.

104
00:07:07,944 --> 00:07:09,946
What is it,
miss keene?

105
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:15,701
There's nobody
on the line.

106
00:07:15,736 --> 00:07:17,203
Listen, listen.

107
00:07:17,238 --> 00:07:19,956
See if you can
hear the sound

108
00:07:19,991 --> 00:07:22,708
of a receiver
being put down.

109
00:07:22,743 --> 00:07:24,210
Not a thing.

110
00:07:24,245 --> 00:07:25,461
Wait!

111
00:07:26,462 --> 00:07:28,214
Oh, well,
it doesn't matter.

112
00:07:28,249 --> 00:07:29,465
I'll call miss finch

113
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,717
and have them
check on the line.

114
00:07:31,752 --> 00:07:33,719
You really think
it's necessary?

115
00:07:33,754 --> 00:07:34,971
Yes, i do.

116
00:07:35,006 --> 00:07:37,723
Am i to have calls like this
coming in all the time?

117
00:07:37,758 --> 00:07:40,726
But if it's a breakdown,
they'll fix it.

118
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:55,241
There we are.

119
00:07:55,276 --> 00:07:56,242
All comfy?

120
00:07:56,277 --> 00:07:57,243
Thank you.

121
00:07:57,493 --> 00:07:59,996
Don't let those calls
upset you, miss keene.

122
00:08:00,031 --> 00:08:01,497
I'm sure whatever
the trouble was

123
00:08:01,532 --> 00:08:04,250
the repairmen
have it fixed by now.

124
00:08:04,285 --> 00:08:07,753
Oh, why not leave
the receiver off the hook?

125
00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:09,622
Then whoever it is
can't call...

126
00:08:09,657 --> 00:08:11,123
though i'm sure
nobody will.

127
00:08:11,374 --> 00:08:12,375
Thank you.

128
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:15,511
I'll see you in the morning,
miss keene.

129
00:08:15,546 --> 00:08:17,013
Good night.
Good night.

130
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:06,679
Hello?

131
00:09:10,601 --> 00:09:12,068
What?

132
00:09:22,363 --> 00:09:24,080
Who's there?

133
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:28,834
Who's on the line?

134
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:32,088
Who is it?

135
00:09:37,093 --> 00:09:39,095
Who's there?

136
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:40,463
Hello?

137
00:09:40,498 --> 00:09:42,465
Hello!

138
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,467
Hello?

139
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:51,223
Hello?

140
00:09:52,475 --> 00:09:55,478
Hello?

141
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:59,365
Hello?

142
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:13,663
Miss keene, are you sure
it was someone saying "hello"?

143
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:15,164
It could've been...

144
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:16,916
i tell you it was someone.

145
00:10:16,951 --> 00:10:19,919
The same one who kept
listening to me saying "hello"

146
00:10:19,954 --> 00:10:22,171
over and over again
without answering back.

147
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:25,424
The same one who kept making
those horrible noises.

148
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:28,678
You have no idea though
whether it was a man or a woman?

149
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:31,180
I've already told you
there's no way of knowing.

150
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,432
It might be either one.

151
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:36,435
And you're positive it wasn't
someone on your party line?

152
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:40,189
Oh, don't you think i don't know
the people on my party line?

153
00:10:40,224 --> 00:10:41,941
Oh, sure you do, miss keene.

154
00:10:41,976 --> 00:10:43,192
Of course you do.

155
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:45,695
Well, i'll, um,
i'll have a man check your line

156
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:47,947
as soon as possible.

157
00:10:47,982 --> 00:10:49,699
The crews
are pretty busy right now

158
00:10:49,734 --> 00:10:51,200
on account of the storm, but...

159
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:55,204
but what am i to do
if this... person calls again?

160
00:10:55,239 --> 00:10:57,707
Try to get their name,
if you can.

161
00:10:57,742 --> 00:11:00,710
If you do that, why, we can take
immediate action, you see.

162
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:07,717
Yes.

163
00:11:11,354 --> 00:11:12,855
What did she say?

164
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:14,357
Nothing.

165
00:11:14,392 --> 00:11:16,859
It's obvious she doesn't
believe a word i told her.

166
00:11:16,894 --> 00:11:18,361
Oh, now.

167
00:11:18,396 --> 00:11:19,862
So far as she's concerned,

168
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:21,614
i'm just a nervous
old biddy

169
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:23,366
falling prey to
my imagination.

170
00:11:23,401 --> 00:11:24,867
But she's find
out differently.

171
00:11:24,902 --> 00:11:26,869
I shall just keep on
calling her and calling her

172
00:11:26,904 --> 00:11:28,871
until she does.

173
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:08,411
If i don't let them call,

174
00:12:08,446 --> 00:12:12,415
i... i shall never find out
who it is.

175
00:12:30,433 --> 00:12:32,435
Hello?

176
00:12:33,436 --> 00:12:35,438
Hello?

177
00:12:36,439 --> 00:12:38,441
Who is this?

178
00:12:39,442 --> 00:12:41,444
Hello?

179
00:12:41,479 --> 00:12:43,446
Who is calling?

180
00:12:45,448 --> 00:12:47,450
Hello?

181
00:12:47,485 --> 00:12:51,454
Please, who is calling?

182
00:12:51,489 --> 00:12:54,957
Hello?

183
00:12:54,992 --> 00:12:57,460
Can you hear me?

184
00:12:57,495 --> 00:12:58,961
Hello?

185
00:13:00,463 --> 00:13:02,465
Please!

186
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,467
Hello?

187
00:13:06,969 --> 00:13:08,471
Margaret!

188
00:13:10,473 --> 00:13:12,475
Margaret!

189
00:13:13,476 --> 00:13:15,227
What is it?

190
00:13:15,478 --> 00:13:17,096
It's a man who's been calling.

191
00:13:17,131 --> 00:13:18,848
How do you know?

192
00:13:18,883 --> 00:13:20,349
He's just called me!

193
00:13:20,384 --> 00:13:21,600
What does he want?

194
00:13:21,851 --> 00:13:22,852
I don't know.

195
00:13:22,887 --> 00:13:25,354
He just keeps on saying hello

196
00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:26,605
over and over again.

197
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,358
"Hello, hello, hello."

198
00:13:29,393 --> 00:13:31,360
Miss keene,
you've got to stop this.

199
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:33,746
You're working
yourself up over...

200
00:13:33,996 --> 00:13:34,747
over nothing?

201
00:13:34,997 --> 00:13:36,866
I didn't say that, miss keene.

202
00:13:36,901 --> 00:13:37,867
You were going to.

203
00:13:37,902 --> 00:13:40,119
Now, miss keene, i wasnot.

204
00:13:40,154 --> 00:13:41,370
I think i better

205
00:13:41,405 --> 00:13:43,122
put you
in your...

206
00:13:43,157 --> 00:13:45,374
i don't want to be
put in my bed!

207
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:48,127
I want to find out who
this terrible man is

208
00:13:48,162 --> 00:13:49,628
who keeps calling me!

209
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:51,380
What did miss finch
tell you?

210
00:13:51,415 --> 00:13:54,884
She told you it was
a bad connection,
didn't she?

211
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:56,135
It's not a connection.

212
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,386
It's a man!

213
00:13:57,421 --> 00:13:58,888
I didn't say
it wasn't.

214
00:13:58,923 --> 00:14:00,890
But if he keeps
saying hello

215
00:14:00,925 --> 00:14:02,391
obviously
he can't hear

216
00:14:02,426 --> 00:14:04,393
because of a bad
connection!

217
00:14:04,428 --> 00:14:05,394
He can hear me.

218
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:06,896
I know he can hear me!

219
00:14:06,931 --> 00:14:08,898
Then why don't
you hang up?

220
00:14:08,933 --> 00:14:10,399
You don't
have to listen.

221
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:11,400
Just hang up.

222
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:12,651
Is that so hard?

223
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:14,403
Over and over again.

224
00:14:14,438 --> 00:14:16,155
"Hello, hello...

225
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:17,656
hello."

226
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:18,657
There.

227
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:20,910
Now you don't
have to listen.

228
00:14:20,945 --> 00:14:23,412
Nobody can call you,
isn't that right?

229
00:14:23,447 --> 00:14:24,914
Leave it that way.

230
00:14:24,949 --> 00:14:26,665
If you want
to make a call

231
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:28,918
just hold down
the arm a second

232
00:14:28,953 --> 00:14:29,919
and dial.

233
00:14:29,954 --> 00:14:31,670
Isn't that right,
miss keene?

234
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:32,671
Miss keene?

235
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:34,924
Why does he keep callingme?

236
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,926
Why?!

237
00:15:24,473 --> 00:15:25,975
Oh!

238
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:18,777
Where are you?

239
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:23,532
I want to talk to you.

240
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:26,035
Where are you?

241
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:30,539
I want to talk to you.

242
00:16:30,574 --> 00:16:32,791
No. No!

243
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:35,044
Where are you?

244
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:40,299
I want to talk to you.

245
00:16:40,334 --> 00:16:42,301
Leave me alone!

246
00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:44,303
Leave me alone!

247
00:17:02,571 --> 00:17:04,573
Your play.

248
00:17:06,075 --> 00:17:07,576
What?

249
00:17:07,611 --> 00:17:08,577
Oh.

250
00:17:12,715 --> 00:17:14,717
What's the matter
with the girl?

251
00:17:14,752 --> 00:17:17,219
She promised a man
would check today

252
00:17:17,254 --> 00:17:19,722
and now the afternoon's
nearly over.

253
00:17:19,757 --> 00:17:23,475
Maybe he doesn't
have to check here, miss keene.

254
00:17:23,726 --> 00:17:25,978
Your play.

255
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:33,485
Shall i answer it?

256
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:42,111
Hello?

257
00:17:42,146 --> 00:17:43,362
Miss keene?

258
00:17:43,397 --> 00:17:45,114
No, this is
margaret phillips.

259
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:46,615
Here's miss keene.

260
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:48,617
It's miss finch.

261
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:51,370
Yes?

262
00:17:51,405 --> 00:17:52,871
About those calls

263
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:55,874
you say you've been receiving,
miss keene.

264
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:57,876
Sayi've been?

265
00:17:57,911 --> 00:18:00,379
We sent a man out to trace them.

266
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:02,381
I have his report here.

267
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:03,382
And?

268
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:05,884
He says he traced the difficulty

269
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,388
to a fallen wire
on the edge of town.

270
00:18:09,423 --> 00:18:11,140
Fallen wire?

271
00:18:11,175 --> 00:18:12,641
Yes, miss keene.

272
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:18,397
Do you mean to tell me
that there were no calls?

273
00:18:18,647 --> 00:18:20,399
Miss keene, there is no way

274
00:18:20,649 --> 00:18:24,153
that anyone could have phoned
from that location.

275
00:18:24,188 --> 00:18:26,655
But i'm sure
a manhascalled me.

276
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:28,540
There must be a phone there.

277
00:18:28,575 --> 00:18:31,043
There must be some way
he could call.

278
00:18:31,078 --> 00:18:34,046
Miss keene, the wire
is lying on the ground.

279
00:18:34,081 --> 00:18:37,800
Tomorrow, our crew will put it
back up, and you won't be...

280
00:18:37,835 --> 00:18:41,804
there must be some way
he could call me.

281
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:45,307
But there is no one out there.

282
00:18:45,342 --> 00:18:47,059
Out where?

283
00:18:47,309 --> 00:18:48,811
Where?

284
00:18:48,846 --> 00:18:51,563
Miss keene, it's the cemetery.

285
00:18:59,822 --> 00:19:01,824
What's wrong, miss keene?

286
00:19:02,825 --> 00:19:04,827
What is it?

287
00:19:04,862 --> 00:19:07,079
What's the matter,
miss keene?

288
00:19:14,703 --> 00:19:15,954
I wish
you'd tell me

289
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:18,957
why you want to come
out here, miss keene.

290
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:21,710
You know it
isn't good for you.

291
00:19:21,745 --> 00:19:24,213
If you hadn't made
such a to-do

292
00:19:24,248 --> 00:19:26,715
i'd never have come
in the first place.

293
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:30,469
What can there possibly
be out here to see?

294
00:19:48,871 --> 00:19:50,873
Over there.

295
00:20:07,256 --> 00:20:09,258
Here.

296
00:20:27,776 --> 00:20:29,778
Miss keene.

297
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,781
It's him.

298
00:20:32,816 --> 00:20:34,283
Miss keene, what's the matter?

299
00:20:34,318 --> 00:20:35,667
It's him.

300
00:20:35,702 --> 00:20:36,919
Brian.

301
00:20:36,954 --> 00:20:39,671
Who? What are you talking about?

302
00:20:39,706 --> 00:20:41,540
Brian.

303
00:20:41,575 --> 00:20:43,542
My fiance.

304
00:20:43,577 --> 00:20:45,544
Your f...?

305
00:20:47,296 --> 00:20:52,301
He died... a week
before we were to be married.

306
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:59,308
We were in a car together.

307
00:20:59,343 --> 00:21:02,561
I insisted upon driving.

308
00:21:02,596 --> 00:21:05,814
I was always insisting
upon everything...

309
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:08,817
determined to have my own way...

310
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:10,569
dominating him.

311
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:14,072
He always did what i said.

312
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:15,324
Always.

313
00:21:19,828 --> 00:21:23,332
I lost control of the car.

314
00:21:23,367 --> 00:21:26,335
I drove straight into a tree.

315
00:21:29,338 --> 00:21:31,340
Brian went...

316
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:34,343
right through the windshield.

317
00:21:38,347 --> 00:21:40,599
He was cut to pieces.

318
00:21:46,355 --> 00:21:48,357
I was crippled.

319
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,363
And now he's trying to reach me.

320
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,003
And now he's trying to reach me.

321
00:22:04,006 --> 00:22:06,508
I can talk to him.

322
00:22:11,013 --> 00:22:14,016
I won't be lonely anymore.

323
00:22:22,024 --> 00:22:23,775
Miss keene, i...

324
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:25,777
i can't leave you like this.

325
00:22:25,812 --> 00:22:26,778
I'll be all right.

326
00:22:26,813 --> 00:22:28,030
Good night.

327
00:22:28,897 --> 00:22:31,149
Good night, margaret.

328
00:22:36,038 --> 00:22:38,290
You'll call me if you need me?

329
00:22:38,325 --> 00:22:40,542
Yes, i will.

330
00:22:40,577 --> 00:22:42,044
I'll be home
all night.

331
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:44,546
Yes. Good night.

332
00:22:44,581 --> 00:22:47,416
Good night, margaret.

333
00:23:15,944 --> 00:23:17,946
Brian?

334
00:23:17,981 --> 00:23:19,948
Brian, are you there?

335
00:23:19,983 --> 00:23:22,451
Brian?

336
00:23:22,486 --> 00:23:25,454
Brian, if you're there,
speak to me.

337
00:23:25,489 --> 00:23:27,456
It's elva.

338
00:23:27,491 --> 00:23:29,207
Elva!

339
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:32,461
Please speak to me, it's elva.

340
00:23:32,496 --> 00:23:33,962
Please say so...

341
00:23:33,997 --> 00:23:35,964
you said

342
00:23:35,999 --> 00:23:37,966
leave you alone.

343
00:23:38,001 --> 00:23:43,221
I always do what you say.

344
00:23:43,256 --> 00:23:44,723
But, brian!

345
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:47,476
Brian, i didn't know it was you.

346
00:23:47,511 --> 00:23:48,477
I thought...

347
00:23:48,512 --> 00:23:50,979
brian, please,
please don't leave me.

348
00:23:51,014 --> 00:23:52,731
Please speak to me.

349
00:23:52,766 --> 00:23:54,733
I didn't mean to say...

350
00:23:56,985 --> 00:23:58,987
brian?

351
00:23:59,988 --> 00:24:01,740
Brian!

352
00:24:04,876 --> 00:24:06,628
According to the bible

353
00:24:06,663 --> 00:24:09,131
god created the heavens
and the earth.

354
00:24:09,166 --> 00:24:11,883
It is man's prerogative,
and woman's,

355
00:24:11,918 --> 00:24:15,137
to create their own particular
and private hell.

356
00:24:15,172 --> 00:24:17,139
Case in point, miss elva keene

357
00:24:17,174 --> 00:24:19,891
who in every sense
has made her own bed

358
00:24:19,926 --> 00:24:21,393
and now must lie in it

359
00:24:21,643 --> 00:24:22,894
sadder, but wiser

360
00:24:22,929 --> 00:24:26,398
by dint of a rather
painful lesson in responsibility

361
00:24:26,433 --> 00:24:28,650
transmitted from...
the twilight zone.
