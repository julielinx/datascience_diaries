1
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:12,962
You're traveling
through another dimension-

2
00:00:12,997 --> 00:00:16,716
a dimension not only of sight
and sound, but of mind,

3
00:00:16,751 --> 00:00:18,601
a journey into a wondrous land

4
00:00:18,636 --> 00:00:20,470
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

5
00:00:20,505 --> 00:00:21,721
That's the signpost up ahead.

6
00:00:21,756 --> 00:00:24,474
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

7
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,627
Now, you listen to me, baby...

8
00:00:44,662 --> 00:00:47,130
this is ace talking here-
your old loverboy, ace.

9
00:00:47,165 --> 00:00:49,632
We've been together
a long time, you and me,

10
00:00:49,667 --> 00:00:51,501
and i've been real good to you,
haven't i?

11
00:00:51,536 --> 00:00:53,386
I fed you, i took care of you,

12
00:00:53,421 --> 00:00:55,889
gave you everything you wanted,
right, right?

13
00:00:55,924 --> 00:00:59,642
Okay. Well, i think it's about
time you started paying off.

14
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:10,270
Oh, you m...

15
00:01:10,305 --> 00:01:11,521
all right.

16
00:01:11,556 --> 00:01:14,023
All right, sweetheart,
you've had your fun.

17
00:01:14,058 --> 00:01:15,909
Now let's get down
to serious business...

18
00:01:15,944 --> 00:01:19,662
although, i'm warning you,
you pay off, or you get out!

19
00:01:19,697 --> 00:01:22,165
Only kidding, only kidding.

20
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:37,547
Kitty, another
quarter.

21
00:01:37,582 --> 00:01:38,798
You ought to take
it easy, ace.

22
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:40,683
You're going to blow
a gasket one of these days.

23
00:01:40,718 --> 00:01:42,552
That's very funny,
very funny.

24
00:01:42,587 --> 00:01:43,803
Now, wait a second.

25
00:01:43,838 --> 00:01:45,054
I'll flip you
double or nothing

26
00:01:45,089 --> 00:01:46,306
for the meal-
what do you say?

27
00:01:46,341 --> 00:01:48,191
You sure like to get kicked
around, don't you?

28
00:01:48,226 --> 00:01:48,808
Never mind
what i like.

29
00:01:48,843 --> 00:01:50,693
Double or nothing-
is it a deal?

30
00:01:50,728 --> 00:01:51,311
Okay.

31
00:01:51,346 --> 00:01:53,196
All right, a
quarter, kitty.

32
00:01:53,231 --> 00:01:54,447
Look, ace, do you
always have to gamble...

33
00:01:54,482 --> 00:01:56,316
come on, will
you, come on!

34
00:01:56,351 --> 00:01:58,818
I can't keep on
losing forever.

35
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:02,572
You call it.

36
00:02:02,607 --> 00:02:03,823
Heads.

37
00:02:03,858 --> 00:02:05,708
Hey, let me see it.

38
00:02:05,743 --> 00:02:06,960
Heads. Thanks.

39
00:02:06,995 --> 00:02:08,828
That's a lucky quarter.

40
00:02:08,863 --> 00:02:10,713
Mind if i borrow it?

41
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,221
Hey!

42
00:02:25,094 --> 00:02:28,231
Oh... here's
your quarter.

43
00:02:28,266 --> 00:02:30,099
Thanks.

44
00:02:30,134 --> 00:02:33,236
Don't mention it.

45
00:02:33,271 --> 00:02:35,738
You ba...

46
00:02:35,773 --> 00:02:36,990
it ain't fair, jimbo.

47
00:02:37,025 --> 00:02:38,241
It just ain't fair.

48
00:02:38,276 --> 00:02:40,109
Maybe your luck
will change, ace.

49
00:02:40,144 --> 00:02:43,246
Yeah, maybe next time,
i'll get electrocuted.

50
00:02:43,281 --> 00:02:44,497
Where you going?

51
00:02:44,532 --> 00:02:46,366
Home and to bed.
Any objections?

52
00:02:46,401 --> 00:02:48,251
No, honey, i wouldn't
blame you if you quit.

53
00:02:48,286 --> 00:02:50,753
I can't; you owe me
three months' salary.

54
00:02:50,788 --> 00:02:54,123
Good night,
big-time operators.

55
00:02:54,158 --> 00:02:56,626
Night, kitty.

56
00:02:56,661 --> 00:02:58,511
When you two going
to get married?

57
00:02:58,546 --> 00:03:01,014
On what?

58
00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:02,265
And with what?

59
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,516
I got a little
saved up.

60
00:03:03,551 --> 00:03:04,767
You can use that.

61
00:03:04,802 --> 00:03:06,019
Well, a little
ain't enough.

62
00:03:06,054 --> 00:03:07,887
Girl like kitty
deserves the best,

63
00:03:07,922 --> 00:03:09,772
and the best comes high.

64
00:03:22,186 --> 00:03:23,403
Jimbo!

65
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:31,544
Jimbo!

66
00:03:32,161 --> 00:03:34,914
Jimbo, there's people
in there!

67
00:03:36,165 --> 00:03:38,051
Come on, jimbo,
lend a hand, will you?

68
00:04:04,694 --> 00:04:09,082
Portrait of a man who thinks
and thereby gets things done.

69
00:04:09,117 --> 00:04:13,202
Mr. Jimbo cobb might be called
a prime mover,

70
00:04:13,237 --> 00:04:15,705
a talent which has to be seen
to be believed.

71
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:18,207
In just a moment,
he'll show his friends and you

72
00:04:18,242 --> 00:04:20,710
how he keeps both feet
on the ground

73
00:04:20,745 --> 00:04:23,846
and his head
in the twilight zone.

74
00:04:37,894 --> 00:04:40,396
They took them
to the hospital.

75
00:04:40,431 --> 00:04:41,030
They'll be okay.

76
00:04:41,065 --> 00:04:42,899
The doc says it's just a few broken bones,

77
00:04:42,934 --> 00:04:44,784
nothing serious.

78
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:48,538
How'd you do
it, jimbo?

79
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:52,292
Do what?

80
00:04:52,327 --> 00:04:54,794
You know.

81
00:04:54,829 --> 00:04:57,297
This business of
the car up and down

82
00:04:57,332 --> 00:05:00,416
and then... and the
sparks in the...

83
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,170
how, jimbo?

84
00:05:04,205 --> 00:05:07,307
Come on, ace,
let's forget it, huh?

85
00:05:07,342 --> 00:05:09,809
All right.

86
00:05:09,844 --> 00:05:11,678
All right, if you
want to keep secrets.

87
00:05:11,713 --> 00:05:14,180
Okay, it's your business.

88
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,186
Ace?

89
00:05:20,221 --> 00:05:22,071
Yeah.

90
00:05:22,106 --> 00:05:23,323
I'll tell you.

91
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,446
I can't exactly
explain it, ace, but...

92
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,332
well, you see...

93
00:05:32,367 --> 00:05:36,336
i guess you might say
it's a power i got.

94
00:05:36,371 --> 00:05:40,089
I can move things around
just by thinking.

95
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:41,958
What?

96
00:05:41,993 --> 00:05:45,712
I know it sounds stupid,
but i can.

97
00:05:45,747 --> 00:05:49,465
I don't know how come or why
or anything, but i can.

98
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:51,968
Like since when?

99
00:05:52,003 --> 00:05:53,853
Well, like
since always.

100
00:05:53,888 --> 00:05:56,356
I never thought
there was anything special

101
00:05:56,391 --> 00:05:57,607
about it or anything.

102
00:05:57,642 --> 00:05:59,475
I thought everybody
could do it,

103
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:00,727
you know, like breathing.

104
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,863
I guess i was wrong.

105
00:06:03,898 --> 00:06:06,983
Oh, yeah...

106
00:06:07,018 --> 00:06:10,119
um, how come i never seen
you doing this before?

107
00:06:10,154 --> 00:06:11,988
Well, i had
to give it up.

108
00:06:12,023 --> 00:06:13,239
Why?

109
00:06:13,274 --> 00:06:15,742
Oh, you know,

110
00:06:15,777 --> 00:06:18,244
it got me in a lot of trouble
in school,

111
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:21,381
and i started getting these
real bad headaches after-

112
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:23,883
like now.

113
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:29,505
Uh... could you do this again?

114
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,257
Sure.
Like right now?

115
00:06:31,292 --> 00:06:33,142
Yeah, but i...
all right, show me.

116
00:06:33,177 --> 00:06:35,011
I got a headache. Come
on, come on, will you?

117
00:06:35,046 --> 00:06:36,896
Come on, show me.

118
00:06:36,931 --> 00:06:38,147
Come on.

119
00:06:38,182 --> 00:06:40,016
Now, do something
to this bed.

120
00:06:40,051 --> 00:06:41,901
Go ahead.

121
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:04,424
Could you make
something move

122
00:07:04,459 --> 00:07:05,675
that's a little
smaller,

123
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:06,926
like a quarter maybe?

124
00:07:06,961 --> 00:07:08,795
Sure. The smaller,
the easier.

125
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,046
All right.

126
00:07:10,081 --> 00:07:11,931
Give me a quarter,
will you?

127
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:20,940
Now, make that
come up heads.

128
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,812
You...

129
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:40,209
give me a seven.

130
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:45,465
Done!

131
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,716
You...

132
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:48,584
honest to...

133
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:51,087
oh...

134
00:07:51,122 --> 00:07:52,338
what's the matter?

135
00:07:52,373 --> 00:07:54,841
Oh, you big
stupid jerk!

136
00:07:54,876 --> 00:07:56,092
We've been beating
our brains out

137
00:07:56,127 --> 00:07:57,977
for four years working
that crummy joint.

138
00:07:58,012 --> 00:07:59,846
We could've been
living like kings!

139
00:07:59,881 --> 00:08:01,731
We could? How?

140
00:08:01,766 --> 00:08:03,599
You'll see.

141
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,991
Honest, when i think
of all the dough that i...

142
00:08:12,026 --> 00:08:13,860
hello, kitty, kitty.

143
00:08:13,895 --> 00:08:14,494
Can you get
ready to go

144
00:08:14,529 --> 00:08:16,362
on a short trip in
about ten minutes?

145
00:08:16,397 --> 00:08:17,613
Well, never mind-
i'll explain

146
00:08:17,648 --> 00:08:18,247
the whole thing
to you later-

147
00:08:18,282 --> 00:08:19,499
but you don't
have to pack.

148
00:08:19,534 --> 00:08:21,367
It's a short trip,
and be ready by 1:00.

149
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,011
All right.

150
00:08:32,046 --> 00:08:33,262
$100 on number eight.

151
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,131
$100? Ace, that's
all we've got.

152
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:37,016
Shh. Take it easy, kitty.

153
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:40,136
Eight!

154
00:08:42,924 --> 00:08:44,774
Come on, give
me that thing.

155
00:08:44,809 --> 00:08:46,025
What's the limit?
What's the limit?

156
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,894
$200. all right, 200 on four,

157
00:08:47,929 --> 00:08:49,145
200 on black, and
200 on an even.

158
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,030
Ace, take it easy.
Shh, please.

159
00:08:51,065 --> 00:08:52,281
200 on even,
black and four.

160
00:08:52,316 --> 00:08:53,533
200 four,
black and even.

161
00:08:53,568 --> 00:08:56,035
Okay.
There we go.

162
00:08:59,155 --> 00:09:01,040
Four...

163
00:09:01,075 --> 00:09:03,543
black and even.

164
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,661
Shovel it in, kid,
shovel it in.

165
00:09:15,671 --> 00:09:18,674
Winner.
Yeah!

166
00:09:18,709 --> 00:09:21,561
All right...

167
00:09:21,596 --> 00:09:22,678
seven again.

168
00:09:22,713 --> 00:09:26,566
Get down with this
lucky shooter, folks.

169
00:09:26,601 --> 00:09:27,183
Same bet, same bet.

170
00:09:27,218 --> 00:09:29,936
Get down with this
lucky winner, folks.

171
00:09:29,971 --> 00:09:31,187
Come on, baby.

172
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,575
Seven
- a winner, winner, winner, winner.

173
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:39,695
Come on, keep going, baby.

174
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:42,081
A winner-
a frontline winner.

175
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:47,837
All right,
three... three...

176
00:09:47,872 --> 00:09:49,088
sweetheart,
don't you think

177
00:09:49,123 --> 00:09:49,705
you ought to quit now?

178
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,957
Your luck's bound
to change.

179
00:09:50,992 --> 00:09:52,208
What do you mean,
change?

180
00:09:52,243 --> 00:09:53,459
Jimbo and i
worked out a system,

181
00:09:53,494 --> 00:09:55,344
ain't we, jimbo, huh?

182
00:09:55,379 --> 00:09:56,596
And a two.

183
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,465
Double three.

184
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,349
There you are!

185
00:10:00,384 --> 00:10:02,218
Have we got
a system, huh?

186
00:10:02,253 --> 00:10:03,469
Ace, i got to quit.

187
00:10:03,504 --> 00:10:04,103
My head's
killing me.

188
00:10:04,138 --> 00:10:06,606
Are you out
of your mi...

189
00:10:06,641 --> 00:10:08,474
okay, jimbo, okay.

190
00:10:08,509 --> 00:10:10,977
Okay, we'll cash in
these chips, huh?

191
00:10:11,012 --> 00:10:12,228
And then you get
an aspirin,

192
00:10:12,263 --> 00:10:12,862
and you lie down
somewhere.

193
00:10:12,897 --> 00:10:14,113
You'll feel 100% better.

194
00:10:14,148 --> 00:10:15,982
Okay, pay off,
will you?

195
00:10:16,017 --> 00:10:17,233
Boy.

196
00:10:17,268 --> 00:10:20,369
Cigars, cigarettes,

197
00:10:20,404 --> 00:10:22,238
chewing gum...

198
00:10:22,273 --> 00:10:27,243
honey... i'll have
some of those.

199
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:29,745
Oh, i'm afraid
i can't change a bill

200
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,998
this size, sir.
Who asked you to?

201
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,133
Come on, jimbo.

202
00:10:34,168 --> 00:10:37,253
Boy! Where's that... boy?

203
00:10:37,288 --> 00:10:40,389
Uh, uh, get those boxes
and be very careful with 'em.

204
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:43,509
All right, junior.
Come on, jimbo.

205
00:10:43,544 --> 00:10:46,012
You're going to take it easy,
feel like a million dollars.

206
00:10:46,047 --> 00:10:47,897
A million dollars...

207
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,827
well, this is
more like it.

208
00:11:01,862 --> 00:11:03,696
Oh, ace,
it's gorgeous.

209
00:11:03,731 --> 00:11:04,947
Beautiful!

210
00:11:04,982 --> 00:11:06,832
Not bad,
not bad at all.

211
00:11:06,867 --> 00:11:08,084
But, ace,
i don't think we should...

212
00:11:08,119 --> 00:11:09,335
forget it.

213
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:11,203
Junior, go out
and buy yourself

214
00:11:11,238 --> 00:11:13,089
a pair
of roller skates.

215
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:16,842
And, junior,
uh, pick up

216
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:18,711
some shaving cream,
toothbrush, you know,

217
00:11:18,746 --> 00:11:20,596
all that jazz, huh?

218
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,606
Jimbo, how do you feel?

219
00:11:30,641 --> 00:11:33,109
Ace, i'm tired.
I got to sleep.

220
00:11:33,144 --> 00:11:34,977
Sleep? What's
the matter with you?

221
00:11:35,012 --> 00:11:36,228
We're going to do the town,
have some fun.

222
00:11:36,263 --> 00:11:38,114
We just got started.
Come on.

223
00:11:38,149 --> 00:11:40,483
Well, i'll see you boys
in the morning.

224
00:11:40,518 --> 00:11:42,368
Now, look, don't
you fold up on me.

225
00:11:42,403 --> 00:11:44,236
Honey, will you get him
some aspirin?

226
00:11:44,271 --> 00:11:46,122
Oh, yes, i've got some
right here.

227
00:11:46,157 --> 00:11:47,373
I'll get some water.

228
00:11:47,408 --> 00:11:49,625
Come on, come on.
I'll fix your head.

229
00:11:51,494 --> 00:11:53,379
There you are.

230
00:11:53,414 --> 00:11:53,996
Ace?

231
00:11:54,031 --> 00:11:55,247
Yeah.

232
00:11:55,282 --> 00:11:56,499
I can't do it no more.

233
00:11:56,534 --> 00:11:58,384
Can't do what?

234
00:11:58,419 --> 00:12:00,886
It's wrong, ace.
It's cheating.

235
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:02,755
Cheating's wrong.

236
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,640
Jimbo, you're right.

237
00:12:04,675 --> 00:12:05,891
You mean it?

238
00:12:05,926 --> 00:12:07,143
We're going to quit?

239
00:12:07,178 --> 00:12:09,011
Sure, jimbo.
We're going to quit.

240
00:12:09,046 --> 00:12:11,514
Ace, you promise?

241
00:12:11,549 --> 00:12:15,267
Sure, kit, sure, after
just one more time.

242
00:12:15,302 --> 00:12:16,519
Come here.
There you are, jimbo.

243
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,021
Okay?

244
00:12:19,056 --> 00:12:20,272
One more time? Is it okay?

245
00:12:20,307 --> 00:12:22,775
Well, okay.
One more time.

246
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:25,277
All right, you take it easy
and rest tonight,

247
00:12:25,312 --> 00:12:27,163
and tomorrow
we'll fracture them.

248
00:12:27,198 --> 00:12:29,031
Kitty, you and me,
we're going out,

249
00:12:29,066 --> 00:12:30,916
and we're going to
tear the town apart!

250
00:12:30,951 --> 00:12:32,168
Ace, let's go
home right now.

251
00:12:32,203 --> 00:12:34,036
Home? What's
the matter with you?

252
00:12:34,071 --> 00:12:35,287
This is
my big chance.

253
00:12:35,322 --> 00:12:36,539
But i don't
want to take it.

254
00:12:36,574 --> 00:12:37,790
You've been very lucky.

255
00:12:37,825 --> 00:12:39,675
Think of all
the money you've won-

256
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:41,544
enough to last you
for the rest of your life.

257
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:44,046
Can't you leave well
enough alone, honey?

258
00:12:44,081 --> 00:12:45,931
Well, well enough isn't good enough for me.

259
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:47,183
Don't you understand?

260
00:12:47,218 --> 00:12:49,051
By tomorrow, i'll
have enough dough

261
00:12:49,086 --> 00:12:51,303
to own this state.
You understand that?

262
00:12:51,338 --> 00:12:53,439
The whole state.

263
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:57,309
Aceville, u.s.a.

264
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:01,697
Ace, you're sick.

265
00:13:01,732 --> 00:13:04,817
Honey, i've never been
healthier in my life.

266
00:13:04,852 --> 00:13:07,319
I want you to know that,
by tomorrow night,

267
00:13:07,354 --> 00:13:08,571
i'll be able
to get you...

268
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,456
wait a minute.

269
00:13:10,491 --> 00:13:11,707
Where you going?

270
00:13:11,742 --> 00:13:13,576
Back home!

271
00:13:13,611 --> 00:13:16,078
Look me up when
you're through

272
00:13:16,113 --> 00:13:17,963
playing
little caesar.

273
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:23,586
What's the matter with her?

274
00:13:23,621 --> 00:13:24,837
You've been ignoring her all night.

275
00:13:24,872 --> 00:13:26,722
Ain't very polite, ace.

276
00:13:27,089 --> 00:13:28,340
Well, i've been busy.

277
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,342
A man should never be that busy.

278
00:13:30,377 --> 00:13:31,594
Why don't you go after her?

279
00:13:31,629 --> 00:13:35,347
Kitty's worth more
than all the money in the world,

280
00:13:35,382 --> 00:13:37,233
isn't she?

281
00:13:37,268 --> 00:13:39,235
Yeah. Yeah, she is.

282
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:40,853
Well, then go after her.

283
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:46,358
Kitty?

284
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:50,746
Kitty, will you be reasonable? Will you?

285
00:13:50,781 --> 00:13:51,363
This is my big chance.

286
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:53,249
Are you going
to gamble tomorrow?

287
00:13:53,284 --> 00:13:54,500
Yes, but...

288
00:13:54,535 --> 00:13:55,117
well, good-bye then.

289
00:13:55,152 --> 00:13:56,368
But, kitty...

290
00:13:56,403 --> 00:13:58,254
kitty!

291
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:02,625
Cigars?
Cigarettes?

292
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:03,876
No. I don't...

293
00:14:03,911 --> 00:14:05,878
anything wrong, sir?

294
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:13,385
No.

295
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:16,388
Nothing at all.

296
00:14:16,423 --> 00:14:17,640
What's your name?
Sheila.

297
00:14:17,675 --> 00:14:18,891
Sheila, how
would you like

298
00:14:18,926 --> 00:14:21,393
to quit this crummy job
and work for me?

299
00:14:21,428 --> 00:14:22,645
Doing what?

300
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,530
Spending money, hmm?

301
00:14:24,565 --> 00:14:25,781
Come on.

302
00:14:25,816 --> 00:14:30,152
Here's a little salary
in advance- a grand.

303
00:14:30,187 --> 00:14:31,403
When do i start?

304
00:14:31,438 --> 00:14:32,655
Right now.

305
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:34,540
We'll have a ball.

306
00:14:34,575 --> 00:14:35,791
Something wrong here?

307
00:14:35,826 --> 00:14:37,042
Are you the manager?

308
00:14:37,077 --> 00:14:38,294
That's right.

309
00:14:38,329 --> 00:14:40,162
Well, i'd like to hire
your cigarette girl

310
00:14:40,197 --> 00:14:41,413
for the evening.

311
00:14:41,448 --> 00:14:43,299
Would it be all right?

312
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,052
Why, yes, yes. I believe
it'll be all right.

313
00:14:47,087 --> 00:14:48,304
I thought it would.

314
00:14:48,339 --> 00:14:49,555
Well, come on, sweetie.
We'll have...

315
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:52,057
oh, one more thing.

316
00:14:52,092 --> 00:14:53,309
Who's the biggest
gambler in town?

317
00:14:53,344 --> 00:14:54,560
Well, let's see...

318
00:14:54,595 --> 00:14:56,428
and i mean big.
No limits.

319
00:14:56,463 --> 00:14:59,565
Well, i believe mr. Nolan is
visiting with us this week.

320
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,433
Phil nolan?

321
00:15:01,468 --> 00:15:02,685
Right.

322
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,570
Well, you tell phil nolan
that ace wants to see him.

323
00:15:04,605 --> 00:15:05,821
Ace?

324
00:15:05,856 --> 00:15:08,324
Ace... ace larsen.
That's me. I live here.

325
00:15:08,359 --> 00:15:10,826
You tell him to call me
tomorrow at the hotel,

326
00:15:10,861 --> 00:15:12,695
and bring plenty
of lettuce-

327
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:14,580
and i mean this
kind of lettuce.

328
00:15:14,615 --> 00:15:15,831
Okay?
Okay.

329
00:15:15,866 --> 00:15:17,700
Live a little.

330
00:15:17,735 --> 00:15:19,585
We're going to tear
this town apart, honey!

331
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:20,836
What do you say?

332
00:15:20,871 --> 00:15:23,956
Great, but will you
wait till i get dressed?

333
00:15:23,991 --> 00:15:25,841
All right. But not too much.

334
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:49,064
Hello.

335
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:50,950
Yeah, he's here.

336
00:15:50,985 --> 00:15:52,201
Just a minute.

337
00:15:52,236 --> 00:15:54,703
Who's calling?

338
00:15:54,738 --> 00:15:56,572
Mr. Nolan?

339
00:15:56,607 --> 00:15:59,074
Just a minute, mr. Nolan.
Ace.

340
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:01,577
Come on. Leave me alone,
will you?

341
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:05,331
Ace, telephone.

342
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:10,336
It's mr. Nolan.

343
00:16:10,371 --> 00:16:12,221
Nol...?

344
00:16:12,256 --> 00:16:14,723
Uh... um...

345
00:16:14,758 --> 00:16:16,592
hi, phil.

346
00:16:16,627 --> 00:16:18,477
Good to hear from you, baby.

347
00:16:18,512 --> 00:16:19,728
This is ace larsen.

348
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,231
From where?

349
00:16:22,266 --> 00:16:24,099
From here. From nevada.

350
00:16:24,134 --> 00:16:25,985
Now, wait a minute, phil.
Wait a minute.

351
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:28,487
That's not a nice way to...

352
00:16:28,522 --> 00:16:30,356
all right, so you never
heard of me. You will.

353
00:16:30,391 --> 00:16:31,607
Now, you listen to me, buster.

354
00:16:31,642 --> 00:16:33,492
I got $200,000 in this room,
and i'm hot for a game.

355
00:16:33,527 --> 00:16:35,361
I'm ready to bet any part of it.

356
00:16:35,396 --> 00:16:36,612
Now, of course,
if the stakes

357
00:16:36,647 --> 00:16:38,497
is too high for you,

358
00:16:38,532 --> 00:16:41,000
i can always call somebody else.

359
00:16:41,035 --> 00:16:42,868
Ah. Well, that's better.

360
00:16:42,903 --> 00:16:46,005
All right. Room 208, right away.

361
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,758
And, uh... phil, uh...

362
00:16:49,793 --> 00:16:51,010
Yeah.

363
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:57,266
Ace, uh...
that mr. Nolan...

364
00:16:57,301 --> 00:16:59,768
he's from chicago,
isn't he?

365
00:16:59,803 --> 00:17:01,020
Yep.

366
00:17:01,055 --> 00:17:02,888
Isn't he a gangster?

367
00:17:02,923 --> 00:17:05,391
Yeah, he's a gangster.
So what?

368
00:17:05,426 --> 00:17:07,276
I hear he's awful mean.

369
00:17:07,311 --> 00:17:08,527
What are you
worrying about?

370
00:17:08,562 --> 00:17:10,396
You see, when
it comes to gambling,

371
00:17:10,431 --> 00:17:12,781
these guy have
their own code of honor.

372
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,653
What about kitty?

373
00:17:17,688 --> 00:17:18,904
I can't hear you, jimbo.

374
00:17:18,939 --> 00:17:20,789
I can't hear you at all.

375
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,298
You
larsen?

376
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:31,166
No, sir. My name's cobb.

377
00:17:31,201 --> 00:17:33,669
Come on in, phil.

378
00:17:33,704 --> 00:17:35,554

Let's see
the stuff.

380
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:41,176
Jimbo, he wants
to see the stuff.

381
00:17:41,211 --> 00:17:43,062
Well, i'm going
to have some breakfast

382
00:17:43,097 --> 00:17:44,313
while you're counting it.

383
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,181
Would you want something?

384
00:17:46,216 --> 00:17:48,684
Cup of coffee maybe, glass of juice.

385
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:51,820
I never gamble
on a full stomach.

386
00:17:51,855 --> 00:17:53,072
This is
ace larsen.

387
00:17:53,107 --> 00:17:55,574
I want room service, and i want...

388
00:17:55,609 --> 00:17:57,443
ace.

389
00:17:57,478 --> 00:18:00,579
A-c-e. Ace
larsen. Yeah.

390
00:18:00,614 --> 00:18:03,582
Uh... your boys want anything?

391
00:18:03,617 --> 00:18:06,085
They don't eat.

392
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:11,090
They don't eat?

393
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,843
Okay.

394
00:18:14,878 --> 00:18:19,214
Suppose we start off
with, uh... oh...

395
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:21,100
ten grand.

396
00:18:21,135 --> 00:18:22,351
Ten grand?

397
00:18:22,386 --> 00:18:23,602
What's the matter?
Too high?

398
00:18:23,637 --> 00:18:26,722
No, ten
grand's fine.

399
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,975
Now, let's...

400
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:33,112
suppose we play
with my dice, huh?

401
00:18:33,147 --> 00:18:35,614
Well, be my guest.

402
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,987
Happy?

403
00:18:42,022 --> 00:18:43,739
Now a little natural...

404
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:46,625
a natural...

405
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,379
and a seven
it is.

406
00:18:50,414 --> 00:18:51,997
Well, what
do you know?

407
00:18:52,032 --> 00:18:53,999
Starting off
great.

408
00:18:54,034 --> 00:18:56,502
Uh... suppose
we let it ride?

409
00:18:56,537 --> 00:18:58,504
You're covered.

410
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,509
You know, 11 would be nice now.

411
00:19:03,544 --> 00:19:05,260
Just a little old 11.

412
00:19:07,047 --> 00:19:08,897
11!

413
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,017
Seven.

414
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:13,902
Natural!

415
00:19:15,771 --> 00:19:17,656
A point.

416
00:19:17,691 --> 00:19:18,907
Two fours.

417
00:19:19,274 --> 00:19:19,908
Two fours.

418
00:19:19,943 --> 00:19:22,027
And two fours
it is.

419
00:19:22,062 --> 00:19:25,781
Some say that you can't
make a mistake...

420
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,791
go ahead.

421
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,293
But remember
this, larsen.

422
00:19:38,328 --> 00:19:40,179
People cheat
on me just once.

423
00:19:40,214 --> 00:19:41,430
Understand?

424
00:19:41,465 --> 00:19:42,931
Sure. Now that

425
00:19:42,966 --> 00:19:44,183
we got that straightened out, am i covered?

426
00:19:44,218 --> 00:19:46,051
You're covered.

427
00:19:46,086 --> 00:19:49,188
Well, i guess this is
my lucky day, huh, fellas?

428
00:19:49,223 --> 00:19:50,439
Hi.

429
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:51,940
Hi, sheila,
baby.

430
00:19:51,975 --> 00:19:53,692
You ready to take me
to lake mead?

431
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,943
Who's the dame?

432
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:57,813
My good luck charm.
My sweetheart. Any objections?

433
00:19:57,848 --> 00:19:59,064
Sheila, honey,
these are

434
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:00,566
some friends
of mine.

435
00:20:00,601 --> 00:20:01,817
We're playing a little penny ante game,

436
00:20:01,852 --> 00:20:03,202
but stick around. It
won't take much longer.

437
00:20:03,237 --> 00:20:05,454
Ace, there's something i...

438
00:20:05,489 --> 00:20:06,705
now, look, this is getting
to be a drag.

439
00:20:07,322 --> 00:20:07,956
What do you say

440
00:20:07,991 --> 00:20:10,459
we separate the men
from the boys, huh?

441
00:20:10,494 --> 00:20:13,462
So what do you say we...
we shoot the works?

442
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:17,216
Jimbo?

443
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:25,724
What's the matter,
nolan?

444
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:28,227
You're supposed to
be a big operator.

445
00:20:28,262 --> 00:20:29,478
You chicken?

446
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:30,729
All right,
larsen.

447
00:20:30,764 --> 00:20:32,598
Go ahead. Shoot
the works.

448
00:20:32,633 --> 00:20:33,849
You're covered.

449
00:20:33,884 --> 00:20:35,100
And where's the dough?

450
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:38,237
My credit's good.

451
00:20:38,272 --> 00:20:41,356
Sure, it is, phil.
Sure, it is.

452
00:20:41,391 --> 00:20:43,242
Lot of fun, huh, honey?
Right?

453
00:20:43,277 --> 00:20:45,244
Win a million,
lose a million.

454
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:47,112
Just like that. Right? Okay...

455
00:20:47,147 --> 00:20:48,997
11 is the number.

456
00:20:49,032 --> 00:20:49,615
Ace, i...

457
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:50,866
you got it?

458
00:20:50,901 --> 00:20:53,368
11... and this is it.

459
00:20:53,403 --> 00:20:54,620
Ace...

460
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,254
now, don't bother me.

461
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,623
Ace, listen. I...

462
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:01,126
11, 11, 11!

463
00:21:01,795 --> 00:21:04,129
And there it is!

464
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,268
Tough luck,
trouper.

465
00:21:09,303 --> 00:21:11,136
Huh?

466
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:14,890
You got
nerve, pal.

467
00:21:14,925 --> 00:21:16,141
I like that.

468
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:28,403
Next time
you want

469
00:21:28,438 --> 00:21:29,655
to play a little
game, trouper,

470
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:30,906
give us a call.

471
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:37,796
Ace, uh...
look, i'm sorry,

472
00:21:37,831 --> 00:21:40,299
but i was
trying to tell you.

473
00:21:40,334 --> 00:21:42,167
I... something happened.

474
00:21:42,202 --> 00:21:43,418
I lost the power.

475
00:21:43,453 --> 00:21:46,421
I guess a fuse
blew out.

476
00:21:49,925 --> 00:21:52,427
You're not mad at
me, are you, ace?

477
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:54,930
I mean, i
couldn't help it.

478
00:21:54,965 --> 00:21:57,432
You mean we're
not going to lake mead?

479
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:02,571
Well, he...
he blew his fuse.

480
00:22:08,944 --> 00:22:12,080
You blew...

481
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:19,955
you blew a fuse.

482
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,468
You sure you don't
want to stop them?

483
00:22:33,503 --> 00:22:34,720
What are
you talking...?

484
00:22:34,755 --> 00:22:35,971
Who needs that hunk
of junk anyway?

485
00:22:36,006 --> 00:22:37,856
That's strictly
for suckers.

486
00:22:37,891 --> 00:22:39,725
Come on. Out, out,
out, out, out.

487
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,610
Go on, you
one-armed bandit.

488
00:22:41,645 --> 00:22:44,112
Go rob somebody else
for a change.

489
00:22:47,232 --> 00:22:49,735
Um... kitty... kitty,
look, i was thinking,

490
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:52,237
you know, now that that
thing's out of here,

491
00:22:52,272 --> 00:22:54,122
i bet you
that jimbo and me

492
00:22:54,157 --> 00:22:55,374
could, you know,
we could

493
00:22:55,409 --> 00:22:57,993
pull enough money
each month to...

494
00:22:58,028 --> 00:23:00,495
after what we,
you know...

495
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:04,499
will you marry me?

496
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,636
Why don't
you be quiet!

497
00:23:07,671 --> 00:23:08,887
I'm proposing,
for crying out loud.

498
00:23:08,922 --> 00:23:11,390
Jimbo, do you
have a quarter?

499
00:23:16,011 --> 00:23:18,513
Call it.

500
00:23:18,548 --> 00:23:20,148
Heads?

501
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:28,407
All right, mr. Larsen,
iwillmarry you.

502
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:30,275
Oh, baby.

503
00:23:49,544 --> 00:23:54,049
Some people possess talent,
others are possessedbyit.

504
00:23:54,084 --> 00:23:57,803
When that happens,
the talent becomes a curse.

505
00:23:57,838 --> 00:24:00,305
Jimbo cobb knew
right from the beginning.

506
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:04,059
But, before ace larsen
learned that simple truth,

507
00:24:04,094 --> 00:24:07,813
he had to take a short trip
through the twilight zone.

508
00:24:12,501 --> 00:24:15,570
Rod serling,
creator ofthe twilight zone,

509
00:24:15,605 --> 00:24:17,456
will tell you
about next week's story

510
00:24:17,491 --> 00:24:21,526
after this word
from our alternate sponsor.

511
00:24:21,561 --> 00:24:24,379
And now, mr. Serling.

512
00:24:24,414 --> 00:24:27,249
Next week, mr. Charles beaumont
and mr. William idelson

513
00:24:27,284 --> 00:24:29,134
deliver a story on your doorstep

514
00:24:29,169 --> 00:24:31,636
with the title
"long distance call."

515
00:24:31,671 --> 00:24:33,505
It's uniquely
a flesh-and-fantasy tale

516
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:36,007
involving a small boy,
a toy telephone

517
00:24:36,042 --> 00:24:38,510
and the incredible faith
of a child.

518
00:24:38,545 --> 00:24:40,395
I hope you're around next week
at the usual time-

519
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:42,264
which, depending
on where you are, varies-

520
00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:45,400
and in the usual place-
the one that never varies-

521
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:48,520
the uncharted regions
of the twilight zone.

522
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:35,283
Be sure and see
the colgate-palmolive company's

523
00:25:35,318 --> 00:25:37,786
new comedy show,
my sister eileen,

524
00:25:37,821 --> 00:25:40,906
wednesday night
on many of these same stations.
