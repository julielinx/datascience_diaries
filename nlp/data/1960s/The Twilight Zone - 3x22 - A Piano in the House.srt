1
00:00:10,777 --> 00:00:13,897
You're traveling
through another dimension-

2
00:00:13,932 --> 00:00:17,033
a dimension not only of sight
and sound, but of mind,

3
00:00:17,068 --> 00:00:18,902
a journey into a wondrous land

4
00:00:18,937 --> 00:00:20,787
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

5
00:00:20,822 --> 00:00:23,907
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

6
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:43,309
Hello, is anyone there?

7
00:00:56,439 --> 00:00:58,324
Hello!

8
00:01:10,837 --> 00:01:13,339
Is anyone there?

9
00:01:29,973 --> 00:01:31,224
Well, how do you do?

10
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:33,726
I'm fitzgerald
fortune...

11
00:01:34,978 --> 00:01:36,863
the theater critic.

12
00:01:36,898 --> 00:01:39,866
So what?

13
00:01:39,901 --> 00:01:43,236
Isn't rudeness something of a
handicap in your line of work?

14
00:01:43,271 --> 00:01:45,238
What's that to you, hmm?

15
00:01:45,273 --> 00:01:47,740
When i saw the name
"treasures unlimited,"

16
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:50,243
i stepped through that door
fully expecting

17
00:01:50,278 --> 00:01:52,745
to encounter some
sentimental old biddy

18
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,882
in an ostrich-plumed hat and
a moth-eaten feather boa.

19
00:01:55,917 --> 00:01:57,133
Instead, to my sincere delight,

20
00:01:57,168 --> 00:01:59,636
i seem to have discovered
a misanthrope.

21
00:01:59,671 --> 00:02:00,887
What's that?

22
00:02:00,922 --> 00:02:02,755
A man who
despises people.

23
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,641
I got work to do, mister.

24
00:02:04,676 --> 00:02:06,509
What are you looking for?

25
00:02:06,544 --> 00:02:09,646
I am looking for a present
for my wife's birthday.

26
00:02:09,681 --> 00:02:12,148
Wrong place, wrong place,
junk shop.

27
00:02:12,183 --> 00:02:14,017
Exactly.

28
00:02:14,052 --> 00:02:15,518
You see, my wife has
the absurd notion

29
00:02:15,553 --> 00:02:18,021
that she would like to learn
to play the piano.

30
00:02:18,056 --> 00:02:20,523
Unfortunately,
she hasn't a trace of talent.

31
00:02:20,558 --> 00:02:23,026
So, do you happen to have
one of those old pianos

32
00:02:23,061 --> 00:02:24,277
that plays itself?

33
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:26,779
Got one. Don't know
if it works or not.

34
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:28,031
But it's old.

35
00:02:28,066 --> 00:02:29,916
Splendid.

36
00:02:32,168 --> 00:02:34,170
Would you mind showing it
to me, please?

37
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:41,044
You're taking a lot
of my time, mister.

38
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:43,546
You're taking an
equal amount of mine.

39
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:19,082
What birthday does
this make for your wife?

40
00:03:19,117 --> 00:03:20,333
The 26th.

41
00:03:20,368 --> 00:03:21,584
So young.

42
00:03:21,619 --> 00:03:24,721
You must be a man
of great personal magnetism

43
00:03:24,756 --> 00:03:26,089
to attract
a wife so young.

44
00:03:26,124 --> 00:03:27,340
I am.

45
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:29,225
Utterly romantic-

46
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:32,345
youth and wisdom, hand in hand.

47
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,596
How i'd
love to see

48
00:03:33,631 --> 00:03:35,481
the two of
you together.

49
00:03:35,516 --> 00:03:37,350
What... what a picture
you must make.

50
00:03:37,385 --> 00:03:41,738
And for her birthday, you're
giving her the gift of music.

51
00:03:41,773 --> 00:03:43,606
Oh, how touching.

52
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,491
What is the price
of the piano?

53
00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:48,611
Youaretaking your young bride
out somewhere tonight, hmm?

54
00:03:48,646 --> 00:03:50,496
Some quiet nook

55
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:53,616
where you can be lost together
in the midst of the great world,

56
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:54,867
looking into each other's eyes.

57
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:57,370
How much for the piano?

58
00:03:57,405 --> 00:03:59,872
It's worth $250,

59
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:02,375
but since it's for
a birthday present

60
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:04,260
i'll let you have it for $200.

61
00:04:04,295 --> 00:04:05,511
I shall
expect delivery

62
00:04:05,546 --> 00:04:06,763
before 6:00
this evening.

63
00:04:06,798 --> 00:04:09,882
The address is right here
on my check.

64
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:11,768
Certainly... i shouldn't like

65
00:04:11,803 --> 00:04:14,887
to have the little lady
disappointed on her birthday.

66
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:16,139
Has it
occurred to you

67
00:04:16,174 --> 00:04:18,641
that you're extraordinarily
susceptible

68
00:04:18,676 --> 00:04:19,892
to the power of music?

69
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:22,395
Isn't everybody?

70
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:25,531
Well... to some degree, yes.

71
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:31,788
You going to stand around
all day taking

72
00:04:31,823 --> 00:04:33,039
my good time?

73
00:04:33,074 --> 00:04:34,907
No, i was just going.

74
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:35,908
Oh, there's the door.

75
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:37,794
Tell me, are
you sentimental

76
00:04:37,829 --> 00:04:39,662
about anything else
beside birthdays?

77
00:04:40,296 --> 00:04:42,165
Birthdays? They're
a stupid waste

78
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,416
of time and money.

79
00:04:45,301 --> 00:04:46,552
Extraordinary.

80
00:04:56,562 --> 00:05:00,933
Mr. Fitzgerald fortune, theater
critic and cynic at large,

81
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,436
on his way to a birthday party.

82
00:05:03,471 --> 00:05:06,572
If he knew what is in store for
him, he probably wouldn't go,

83
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:09,075
because before
this evening is over

84
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:12,829
that cranky old piano is going
to play "those piano-roll blues"

85
00:05:12,864 --> 00:05:15,331
with some effects
that could happen only in

86
00:05:15,366 --> 00:05:17,200
the twilight zone.

87
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:51,868
Good evening, sir.

88
00:05:51,903 --> 00:05:53,119
You've dusted
the piano, i see.

89
00:05:53,154 --> 00:05:54,370
Yes, sir.

90
00:05:54,405 --> 00:05:56,239
It came an hour
ago, sir.

91
00:05:56,274 --> 00:05:58,124
Oh, marvin...

92
00:05:58,159 --> 00:05:59,375
yes, sir?

93
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:01,377
If you're going to wait
at the party tonight

94
00:06:01,412 --> 00:06:03,880
do you think you could manage to
do something about your face?

95
00:06:03,915 --> 00:06:05,131
My face, sir?

96
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:07,633
A party is supposed to be
a happy occasion.

97
00:06:07,668 --> 00:06:09,385
Do you think
you could manage to be

98
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,636
a little less miserable
than usual?

99
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:12,755
I will do my best, sir.

100
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:15,508
Is that you, gerald?

101
00:06:15,543 --> 00:06:17,393
Yes, esther.

102
00:06:21,764 --> 00:06:23,015
Hello, darling.

103
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,152
Esther, i want you
to let marvin go.

104
00:06:26,187 --> 00:06:27,403
What's he done?

105
00:06:27,438 --> 00:06:28,654
No, it's not anything
that he's done.

106
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:29,906
It's just the way he looks.

107
00:06:29,941 --> 00:06:32,408
I hate to come home every
evening and be confronted

108
00:06:32,443 --> 00:06:34,277
by that lugubrious
expression of his-

109
00:06:34,312 --> 00:06:36,162
unspeakably depressing.
Look at him!

110
00:06:36,197 --> 00:06:38,664
Looks as if he's going to burst
into tears at any moment.

111
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:41,167
Surely at least we can have
a servant who's cheerful

112
00:06:41,202 --> 00:06:42,418
to have around.

113
00:06:42,453 --> 00:06:45,538
There's no need to hurt
his feelings, dear.

114
00:06:45,573 --> 00:06:46,789
He has no feelings.

115
00:06:46,824 --> 00:06:48,040
The man's a clod.

116
00:06:49,792 --> 00:06:53,045
Well, you don't like the piano,
i take it.

117
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,432
Oh, i love the piano,
i really do.

118
00:06:56,467 --> 00:06:58,050
Eh, have you played it?

119
00:06:58,085 --> 00:06:59,936
I didn't know how it worked,

120
00:06:59,971 --> 00:07:02,438
so i thought i'd wait
until you came home.

121
00:07:02,473 --> 00:07:03,556
You see, i remembered

122
00:07:03,591 --> 00:07:06,058
that you wanted to learn
to play the piano.

123
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:07,310
This piano
plays itself.

124
00:07:07,345 --> 00:07:09,195
Yes, wasn't that
considerate of me?

125
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,446
See, i didn't want you

126
00:07:10,481 --> 00:07:12,315
to take all those
tedious lessons

127
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:14,200
and then find out
at the end of it all

128
00:07:14,235 --> 00:07:17,570
that you really had no
musical talent at all.

129
00:07:17,605 --> 00:07:18,204
I see.

130
00:07:18,821 --> 00:07:20,206
Well, darling?

131
00:07:20,241 --> 00:07:23,326
No thanks for
my birthday present?

132
00:07:23,361 --> 00:07:25,828
No emotion of any kind?

133
00:07:29,332 --> 00:07:31,217
Thank you, gerald.

134
00:07:31,252 --> 00:07:34,837
Well, now, let's hear
what this one sounds like.

135
00:07:34,872 --> 00:07:36,722
It has a happy-enough
sounding title.

136
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:48,601
Thank you, marvin.

137
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:55,491
Marvin, what on earth
is the matter with you?

138
00:07:55,526 --> 00:07:56,859
Are you feeling

139
00:07:56,894 --> 00:07:57,493
all right, marvin?

140
00:07:57,528 --> 00:07:59,996
I'm very well,
thank you, madame.

141
00:08:00,031 --> 00:08:02,114
But you're smiling.

142
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:03,366
Am i?

143
00:08:03,401 --> 00:08:05,251
You most
certainly are.

144
00:08:05,286 --> 00:08:08,371
That's probably
because i'm happy, sir.

145
00:08:08,406 --> 00:08:10,256
What are you
happy about?

146
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:11,507
Everything...

147
00:08:11,542 --> 00:08:14,627
i make good money,
got a nice place to live,

148
00:08:14,662 --> 00:08:17,763
my health, money in the bank,
i like my job!

149
00:08:18,381 --> 00:08:19,131
But you couldn't
possibly.

150
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:21,017
I treat you
atrociously.

151
00:08:21,052 --> 00:08:24,020
Oh, you don't bother me,
mr. Fortune, you tickle me.

152
00:08:24,055 --> 00:08:25,888
Sometimes it's all i can do

153
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:27,523
to keep from
laughing out loud

154
00:08:27,558 --> 00:08:29,392
when you have one
of your tantrums.

155
00:08:29,427 --> 00:08:32,528
I get a great kick of it
when you go around

156
00:08:32,563 --> 00:08:35,648
flicking the furniture
to see if i've dusted,

157
00:08:35,683 --> 00:08:39,402
or checking the silver
to see if it's polished.

158
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:01,307
I'm sorry if i spoke
out of place, sir.

159
00:09:01,342 --> 00:09:03,559
Oh, on the
contrary, marvin.

160
00:09:03,594 --> 00:09:04,810
I'm very
glad you did.

161
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:07,813
You may go,
thank you.

162
00:09:16,572 --> 00:09:19,075
What a strange
thing to happen.

163
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:19,692
Yes, wasn't it?

164
00:09:19,727 --> 00:09:21,577
Who would
have thought

165
00:09:21,612 --> 00:09:24,080
that beneath
that gloomy exterior

166
00:09:24,115 --> 00:09:26,582
the man was concealing
a sunny nature?

167
00:09:29,085 --> 00:09:32,838
Of course, i've always believed
that we have two faces-

168
00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:33,956
one that we wear

169
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:36,459
and the other
that we keep hidden.

170
00:09:36,494 --> 00:09:40,212
The problem has always
been to find some method

171
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:43,349
to make people reveal
their hidden faces.

172
00:09:43,384 --> 00:09:44,600
Yes, i suppose it helps

173
00:09:44,635 --> 00:09:47,720
if you know what
particular hidden face

174
00:09:47,755 --> 00:09:48,971
you're looking for.

175
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,227
How do you like
this music, esther?

176
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,622
You... beast!

177
00:10:06,657 --> 00:10:08,624
I've controlled
myself

178
00:10:08,659 --> 00:10:11,377
for six years...

179
00:10:11,412 --> 00:10:13,245
and i can't stand it any longer.

180
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:16,382
I was a stupid child
when i married you.

181
00:10:16,417 --> 00:10:20,386
I thought you
were a great man.

182
00:10:20,421 --> 00:10:22,505
But you aren't.
You're just a sadistic fiend.

183
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,390
You take pleasure
in humiliating me

184
00:10:24,425 --> 00:10:26,258
in front of
your clever friends.

185
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:28,894
You enjoy
hurting me.

186
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:31,263
I've stood your cruelty
for six years,

187
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:33,149
and i can't stand it anymore.

188
00:10:33,184 --> 00:10:36,018
Are you feeling well, my dear?

189
00:10:37,653 --> 00:10:40,773
I feel better
than i've felt for years.

190
00:10:40,808 --> 00:10:44,527
It's a great relief to tell you
what i really think about you.

191
00:10:44,562 --> 00:10:46,412
I've kept it bottled up
for so long.

192
00:10:46,447 --> 00:10:47,663
I thought
you needed me.

193
00:10:47,698 --> 00:10:50,166
I thought you needed
my love, but you don't.

194
00:10:50,201 --> 00:10:51,417
You just need someone
to bully

195
00:10:51,452 --> 00:10:53,285
and to torture
when you feel like it.

196
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:57,673
I tried to love you-
heaven knows i did-

197
00:10:57,708 --> 00:11:00,176
but i hate you.

198
00:11:00,211 --> 00:11:02,044
I hate you!

199
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,184
Congratulations,
my dear.

200
00:11:08,219 --> 00:11:10,052
A magnificent
performance.

201
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:11,804
If you'd been on stage, esther,

202
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,689
i should have given you
superlative reviews.

203
00:11:19,695 --> 00:11:22,198
I don't know what possessed me.

204
00:11:22,233 --> 00:11:23,199
Well, i do!

205
00:11:23,234 --> 00:11:25,067
I seem to have
bought you

206
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:27,570
a more interesting
birthday present

207
00:11:27,605 --> 00:11:28,204
than i'd thought.

208
00:11:28,239 --> 00:11:31,323
I wonder what
other people are hiding.

209
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:32,958
Gerald, promise me
that you won't play

210
00:11:32,993 --> 00:11:34,827
the piano again
at the party tonight.

211
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:36,579
I promise no such thing.

212
00:11:36,614 --> 00:11:40,332
I wasn't looking forward
to this party very much.

213
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,835
But now i think
we're going to have

214
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,970
a most
amusing evening.

215
00:11:58,517 --> 00:11:59,769
Good evening, marvin.

216
00:11:59,804 --> 00:12:01,020
Good evening, sir.

217
00:12:01,055 --> 00:12:01,654
Gerry?

218
00:12:02,271 --> 00:12:03,522
Greg! Good to see you.

219
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:04,774
Scotch?

220
00:12:04,809 --> 00:12:06,025
Of course.

221
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,276
You're unusually
cordial tonight.

222
00:12:07,311 --> 00:12:09,161
That is yoursmileyou're
wearing, isn't it?

223
00:12:09,196 --> 00:12:12,281
I took it out of cold storage
in honor of esther's birthday.

224
00:12:12,316 --> 00:12:14,166
Well, not i. I don't
plan to smile all evening.

225
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:16,669
I'm glad to see you share
my distaste for birthdays.

226
00:12:16,704 --> 00:12:17,920
Well, birthdays,
anniversaries

227
00:12:17,955 --> 00:12:20,423
and certain holidays i
overlook whenever possible.

228
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:22,925
They seem to imply
a certain sticky
human involvement

229
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,176
which i'd much
rather avoid.

230
00:12:24,211 --> 00:12:26,679
Oh, is that true?
I'd always gathered you were

231
00:12:26,714 --> 00:12:29,181
something of a ladies' man,
rather thickly involved.

232
00:12:29,216 --> 00:12:31,050
You've been
misinformed,
gerry, my boy.

233
00:12:31,085 --> 00:12:32,301
I'm much too selfish
to fall in love.

234
00:12:32,336 --> 00:12:34,186
And you're
miserable.

235
00:12:34,221 --> 00:12:35,438
Not in the least.

236
00:12:35,473 --> 00:12:38,557
I value the peace and quiet of
my orderly bachelor existence.

237
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:41,060
Lets me write my plays
without interference
from anyone.

238
00:12:41,095 --> 00:12:42,311
Oh, yes, how
is the new play?

239
00:12:42,812 --> 00:12:44,697
Brilliant.

240
00:12:44,732 --> 00:12:46,315
By the way, where is
the birthday girl?

241
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:48,818
Oh, she's still
at her makeup table.

242
00:12:48,853 --> 00:12:50,703
Her emotions
were showing,

243
00:12:50,738 --> 00:12:52,571
and she's covering up
a little.

244
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:55,708
Tell me, what do you think
of this amusing little toy

245
00:12:55,743 --> 00:12:56,959
i found for her?

246
00:12:56,994 --> 00:12:58,828
I haven't seen one
of those old jobs in years.

247
00:12:58,863 --> 00:12:59,462
Doesn't play, does it?

248
00:12:59,497 --> 00:13:01,213
It does, indeed.

249
00:13:01,248 --> 00:13:03,082
Plays remarkably well.

250
00:13:03,117 --> 00:13:04,967
Let me show you.

251
00:13:05,002 --> 00:13:08,087
I have a piece
especially for you.

252
00:13:12,376 --> 00:13:14,226
Romantic,
wouldn't you say?

253
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:19,098
Is esther pleased with it?

254
00:13:19,133 --> 00:13:21,600
Well, she hasn't shown
any great enthusiasm.

255
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:24,103
That doesn't sound like esther.

256
00:13:24,138 --> 00:13:27,857
Usually she's so grateful for
any small show of affection.

257
00:13:27,892 --> 00:13:30,359
I think that's
one of her most
lovable qualities-

258
00:13:30,394 --> 00:13:33,496
the ability to accept
a bouquet of daisies

259
00:13:33,531 --> 00:13:35,998
as though they were
the rarest of orchids.

260
00:13:36,033 --> 00:13:39,752
I remember i once gave her
a small ring, a turquoise ring.

261
00:13:39,787 --> 00:13:42,254
She accepted it as if
it were the hope diamond.

262
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:46,625
Oh, i remember when she brought
that ring back from mexico city.

263
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,762
But i seem to recall
that she went there alone.

264
00:13:49,797 --> 00:13:51,013
Yes, yes, she did.

265
00:13:51,048 --> 00:13:52,882
We ran into each
other down there.

266
00:13:52,917 --> 00:13:54,767
She never mentioned it.

267
00:13:54,802 --> 00:13:57,269
Wasn't that rather
an odd coincidence?

268
00:13:57,304 --> 00:13:59,772
Gerry, has it ever
occurred to you

269
00:13:59,807 --> 00:14:02,892
that i'm very deeply
in love with your wife?

270
00:14:02,927 --> 00:14:06,028
My dear greg...
i always believed that you were

271
00:14:06,063 --> 00:14:08,531
about as capable
of passion as a head of lettuce

272
00:14:08,566 --> 00:14:12,284
and esther's emotional power
was that of a newborn kitten.

273
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:13,536
Now don't speak of her that way.

274
00:14:13,571 --> 00:14:16,038
I'll speak of her
any way i please.

275
00:14:16,073 --> 00:14:17,289
She's my wife.

276
00:14:17,406 --> 00:14:18,657
You don't know esther at all.

277
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:20,543
Esther is full of love.

278
00:14:20,578 --> 00:14:23,045
Her skin is warm
and soft like velvet.

279
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:26,165
The scent of her hair is
enough to drive a man wild.

280
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,301
And... her hands are gentle,
sweet to kiss and to hold.

281
00:14:29,336 --> 00:14:30,553
Esther is music...

282
00:14:30,588 --> 00:14:31,804
gerald, no!

283
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,672
...honey, esther is...

284
00:14:34,924 --> 00:14:38,060
oh, i'm sorry you
did that, my dear.

285
00:14:38,095 --> 00:14:41,814
I don't know when i've been
so highly entertained.

286
00:14:41,849 --> 00:14:43,065
Esther, i'm sorry.

287
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,934
I can't explain
what happened.

288
00:14:44,969 --> 00:14:47,436
It's probably just as well.

289
00:14:47,471 --> 00:14:51,190
I never enjoyed
deceiving you, gerald.

290
00:14:51,225 --> 00:14:53,325
My dear, you're incapable
of deceiving me.

291
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,194
I've known for years
of your capacity

292
00:14:55,229 --> 00:14:57,696
for doing any number
of sordid little things.

293
00:14:57,731 --> 00:15:00,199
The only revelation
that's been made to me

294
00:15:00,234 --> 00:15:02,701
has been the specific details
of your squalid little affair.

295
00:15:03,988 --> 00:15:05,204
Oh, our guests
are arriving.

296
00:15:05,239 --> 00:15:07,089
Before i welcome them,

297
00:15:07,124 --> 00:15:08,958
may i wish you
a happy birthday, my dear,

298
00:15:08,993 --> 00:15:10,843
and hope that
the next 26 years

299
00:15:10,878 --> 00:15:12,711
will be equally
rewarding.

300
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:15,848
Gerald, please don't use
the piano again tonight.

301
00:15:15,883 --> 00:15:17,716
It's not something
that you fool with.

302
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:19,602
I'm not fooling
with it, my dear.

303
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:22,104
I'm using it with
deadly accuracy.

304
00:15:24,607 --> 00:15:26,475
Hi, marvin!

305
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:27,726
Good evening,
miss moore.

306
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:29,612
Marge, my dear,
do come in.

307
00:15:29,647 --> 00:15:32,731
Well, don't just stand there,
devouring me with your eyes.

308
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:33,983
Kiss me, you fool.

309
00:15:34,617 --> 00:15:35,868
Marge, i'm really
vexed with you.

310
00:15:35,903 --> 00:15:37,736
You promised me the
next time i saw you

311
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:39,622
you'd be as svelte
as an antelope.

312
00:15:39,657 --> 00:15:42,374
I've been on more diets
than arcaro has horses.

313
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:43,742
But somehow, i always manage

314
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:46,245
to get thrown
before the finish line.

315
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,496
Happy birthday, esther.

316
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:48,747
Thank you, marge.

317
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:51,250
I'm not even speaking
to you, handsome.

318
00:15:51,285 --> 00:15:55,004
Do you realize it's been
months since you've called me?

319
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:56,889
Somebody else been
taking my place?

320
00:15:56,924 --> 00:15:58,757
As a matter of fact, yes.

321
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:01,894
We've just been having an
illuminating discussion about

322
00:16:01,929 --> 00:16:04,396
greg's new romance.

323
00:16:04,431 --> 00:16:06,148
Don't tell me her name,

324
00:16:06,183 --> 00:16:08,651
or i just might
scratch her eyes out.

325
00:16:08,686 --> 00:16:12,404
Or worse yet, i might just sit
on her and mash her to death.

326
00:16:13,691 --> 00:16:14,907
Well, isn't somebody

327
00:16:14,942 --> 00:16:17,409
going to offer
me a drink?

328
00:16:17,444 --> 00:16:19,161
Oh, you'll have to talk
to marvin.

329
00:16:19,196 --> 00:16:21,664
I believe another stagecoach
is arriving.

330
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:24,166
Darling, you
look ravishing.

331
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:25,417
How are you?
Mwa.

332
00:16:25,452 --> 00:16:26,669
Hi.
Ross, good
to see you.

333
00:16:26,704 --> 00:16:29,171
Hello, mary.
Happy birthday.

334
00:16:31,674 --> 00:16:34,793
Oh, this looks marvelous.
Oh, this looks marvelous!

335
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:36,045
Why don't you have one?

336
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,296
Not with
my diet.

337
00:16:37,331 --> 00:16:37,930
Diet? What's that?

338
00:16:38,547 --> 00:16:39,798
All right, everyone,

339
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:42,301
now, may i have
your attention, please?

340
00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:44,186
Now, um, would
you just find seats.

341
00:16:44,221 --> 00:16:46,689
Anywhere, uh, on the floor
will be fine.

342
00:16:46,724 --> 00:16:48,557
Not me, i'd never
be able to get up.

343
00:16:48,592 --> 00:16:51,060
The time has come
for fun and games.

344
00:16:51,095 --> 00:16:54,196
Now, being mostly
friends of esther's

345
00:16:54,231 --> 00:16:56,315
you're probably inclined
to such intellectual pursuits

346
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,816
as, uh, spin the bottle
or pin the tail

347
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,452
on the donkey.
However, tonight

348
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:03,455
i thought rather than cater
to your juvenile mentalities

349
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,324
we might perhaps have
a rather more adult game.

350
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,826
When are we going
to cut the cake?
I'm hungry!

351
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:09,712
Compulsive eaters

352
00:17:09,747 --> 00:17:12,214
will find hors d'oeuvres
within arm's reach.

353
00:17:12,249 --> 00:17:14,967
Now, for this game,
we shall need a volunteer.

354
00:17:17,219 --> 00:17:19,471
Well, in the absence
of a volunteer

355
00:17:19,506 --> 00:17:21,974
i shall have to
conscript someone.

356
00:17:22,009 --> 00:17:23,842
Um... marge moore.

357
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:25,844
Me?

358
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:32,851
Okay, svengali,
uh, what's the caper?

359
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:34,103
All i want you

360
00:17:34,138 --> 00:17:37,239
to do is to listen
to some music, my dear.

361
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,993
Oh, well,
i can do that!

362
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:53,372
Talk to me,
marge.

363
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:56,508
Tell me what
you're feeling.

364
00:17:56,543 --> 00:17:59,011
My name isn't marge.

365
00:17:59,046 --> 00:18:01,513
What is your name?

366
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:06,518
My name is tina.

367
00:18:06,553 --> 00:18:09,021
Who are you, tina?

368
00:18:09,056 --> 00:18:11,523
I'm a little girl.

369
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:14,026
What do you
like to do?

370
00:18:14,061 --> 00:18:16,528
Oh, i love to dance.

371
00:18:16,563 --> 00:18:19,648
All right, tina, dance for us.

372
00:18:39,168 --> 00:18:41,053
Shh!

373
00:18:46,809 --> 00:18:51,180
All right, you
may stop dancing
now, tina.

374
00:18:51,215 --> 00:18:54,566
Tell me, are you always tina?

375
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:57,436
Not always.

376
00:18:57,471 --> 00:18:59,822
What else are you, marge?

377
00:18:59,857 --> 00:19:05,444
Sometimes, i pretend
that i'm a snowflake;

378
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:10,449
white and tiny
and perfectly formed.

379
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:12,084
I float
on the air

380
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:16,338
of a pale blue
moonlit night.

381
00:19:16,373 --> 00:19:18,957
I'm never lonely...

382
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:22,711
beautiful and slender.

383
00:19:22,746 --> 00:19:25,848
Oh, and i'm loved.

384
00:19:25,883 --> 00:19:31,470
I see a man with
his hand stretched out.

385
00:19:31,505 --> 00:19:35,858
I drift down
and reach that hand.

386
00:19:37,726 --> 00:19:43,365
I'm enclosed by his warmth
and i melt with his love.

387
00:19:59,283 --> 00:20:01,750
It was all in
fun, my dear.

388
00:20:01,785 --> 00:20:03,752
I chose you especially,
because i thought

389
00:20:03,787 --> 00:20:06,255
you'd enjoy a joke.

390
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:28,277
Gerald!

391
00:20:28,312 --> 00:20:29,027
Don't you think
that we've had

392
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:31,530
enough of that piano
for tonight?
Oh, not quite.

393
00:20:31,565 --> 00:20:32,781
Sit down, sit down,
everybody.

394
00:20:32,816 --> 00:20:34,666
I'm going to call
forth the devil.

395
00:20:34,701 --> 00:20:37,169
I hardly think we shall
get a volunteer,

396
00:20:37,204 --> 00:20:38,420
but that
doesn't matter.

397
00:20:38,455 --> 00:20:40,289
Esther, put
this on the piano.

398
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,425
Now, cheer up,
darling.

399
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:45,294
It's only a game.

400
00:20:55,973 --> 00:20:57,806
Now, this is going
to befaust.

401
00:20:57,841 --> 00:21:00,309
So if there really
is a devil among us

402
00:21:00,344 --> 00:21:02,194
we shall know it
soon enough.

403
00:21:27,336 --> 00:21:29,221
Say something, devil.

404
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:32,090
I'm afraid.

405
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,092
What are you afraid of, devil?

406
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:37,846
I'm afraid of the dark.

407
00:21:37,881 --> 00:21:40,599
Why, you're not a devil.

408
00:21:40,634 --> 00:21:43,735
You're just
a poor, frightened kid.

409
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:45,604
That's a secret.

410
00:21:47,489 --> 00:21:49,992
Tell us your
secret, gerry.

411
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:55,614
I'm afraid of you all.

412
00:21:56,865 --> 00:22:00,002
I'm afraid of people.

413
00:22:00,037 --> 00:22:02,504
There's a small,
frightened boy,

414
00:22:02,539 --> 00:22:06,258
and i've kept him
hidden away inside me.

415
00:22:06,293 --> 00:22:09,378
And he only likes
to hurt people,

416
00:22:09,413 --> 00:22:12,514
and i can't stop him
from doing it.

417
00:22:12,549 --> 00:22:16,385
Did you know
that i envied you, marge?

418
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,887
I can't embrace
the world as you do.

419
00:22:18,922 --> 00:22:22,391
And in my envy,
i released

420
00:22:22,426 --> 00:22:26,778
that frightened child inside me
and i let him hurt you.

421
00:22:26,813 --> 00:22:29,281
I tried to hurt you, too, greg.

422
00:22:29,316 --> 00:22:31,400
I gave bad reviews
to your plays

423
00:22:31,435 --> 00:22:33,902
when i should
have given praise.

424
00:22:33,937 --> 00:22:37,039
I coveted your talent
because i have none.

425
00:22:37,074 --> 00:22:39,908
And i hurt you
in every childish way i could.

426
00:22:39,943 --> 00:22:43,795
I, uh, i think we'd better go.

427
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,664
Esther...

428
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:50,052
i've hurt
you most of all.

429
00:22:50,087 --> 00:22:52,554
You came to
me with love,

430
00:22:52,589 --> 00:22:54,423
but you frightened me.

431
00:22:54,458 --> 00:22:56,308
I don't know how
to return love

432
00:22:56,343 --> 00:23:00,679
except as
a child does-

433
00:23:00,714 --> 00:23:04,433
with shrieks
and blows and
indifference.

434
00:23:04,468 --> 00:23:06,318
Good night,
esther.

435
00:23:06,353 --> 00:23:07,569
Uh...

436
00:23:07,604 --> 00:23:09,438
esther...

437
00:23:09,473 --> 00:23:12,190
will you
come with me?

438
00:23:12,225 --> 00:23:14,076
Where are you
all going?!

439
00:23:14,111 --> 00:23:15,944
I don't want
you to leave.

440
00:23:15,979 --> 00:23:17,829
Come back!

441
00:23:18,447 --> 00:23:21,083
If you leave me,
i'm going to be very naughty!

442
00:23:50,862 --> 00:23:53,365
Don't laugh at me.

443
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,485
I'm not laughing, mr. Fortune.

444
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,987
You're not funny anymore.

445
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:02,124
Mr. Fitzgerald fortune,

446
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,993
a man who went searching
for concealed persons

447
00:24:05,028 --> 00:24:09,381
and found himself
in the twilight zone.

448
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:17,305
Rod serling,
creator ofthe twilight zone,

449
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,174
will tell you
about next week's story

450
00:24:19,209 --> 00:24:21,059
after this message.

451
00:24:23,011 --> 00:24:24,513
And now, mr. Serling.

452
00:24:24,548 --> 00:24:27,599
A symbol of a sad but rather
commonplace event.

453
00:24:27,634 --> 00:24:30,101
An impressive funeral,
the deceased laid out

454
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:31,987
in a most acceptable manner...

455
00:24:32,022 --> 00:24:34,489
but in this case,
at the last moment deciding

456
00:24:34,524 --> 00:24:37,609
that in matters concerning
the trip to the great beyond,

457
00:24:37,644 --> 00:24:39,494
perhaps this trip
wasn't necessary.

458
00:24:39,529 --> 00:24:41,997
You'll see it next week
onthe twilight zone

459
00:24:42,032 --> 00:24:43,865
when we present
montgomery pittman's

460
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:47,619
"the last rites
of jeff myrtlebank."

461
00:24:47,654 --> 00:24:50,755
Very often when you write for a
living, you run across blocks-

462
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:53,258
moments when you can't think
of the right thing to say.

463
00:24:53,293 --> 00:24:55,760
Now happily, there are no blocks
to get in the way

464
00:24:55,795 --> 00:24:57,629
of the full pleasure
of chesterfield.

465
00:24:57,664 --> 00:24:59,514
Great tobaccos make it
a wonderful smoke.

466
00:24:59,549 --> 00:25:02,017
Try 'em; they satisfy.

467
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:33,415
This is james arness.

468
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:35,300
You know, it's only a short hop

469
00:25:35,335 --> 00:25:37,802
fromthe twilight zone
to dodge city andgunsmoke,

470
00:25:37,837 --> 00:25:41,056
saturday nights
over most of these stations.
