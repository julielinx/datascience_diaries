1
00:00:09,844 --> 00:00:12,312
You're traveling
through another dimension

2
00:00:12,347 --> 00:00:15,432
a dimension not only
of sight and sound, but of mind

3
00:00:16,066 --> 00:00:17,317
a journey into a wondrous land

4
00:00:17,352 --> 00:00:19,819
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

5
00:00:19,854 --> 00:00:21,688
That's the signpost up ahead.

6
00:00:21,723 --> 00:00:23,573
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

7
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:43,593
See anything?

8
00:00:43,628 --> 00:00:46,096
The tops of some trees
have been knocked down.

9
00:00:46,131 --> 00:00:47,964
Looks like something
hit that pond.

10
00:00:48,598 --> 00:00:51,718
Whatever it is will be under
the ice till next spring.

11
00:00:51,753 --> 00:00:52,352
A meteor or something, probably.

12
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:53,603
I better check in.

13
00:00:53,638 --> 00:00:56,106
That woman who phoned
said something

14
00:00:56,141 --> 00:00:57,974
about calling out
the national guard.

15
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:04,230
This is 118-3a, 118-3a

16
00:01:04,265 --> 00:01:06,733
reporting a check-out.

17
00:01:06,768 --> 00:01:08,618
Go ahead.

18
00:01:08,653 --> 00:01:12,372
Checking out a report on
an unidentified flying object.

19
00:01:12,407 --> 00:01:16,126
Supposed to have landed
in the area of hook's landing.

20
00:01:16,161 --> 00:01:18,878
Appears something
cut off the tops

21
00:01:18,913 --> 00:01:20,747
of some trees.

22
00:01:20,782 --> 00:01:22,382
Came down
in the ice

23
00:01:22,417 --> 00:01:23,633
at tracy's pond

24
00:01:23,668 --> 00:01:25,001
and we can't
see it now.

25
00:01:25,036 --> 00:01:26,252
Bill?

26
00:01:26,287 --> 00:01:27,253
Hold on.

27
00:01:27,288 --> 00:01:28,505
Yeah?

28
00:01:28,638 --> 00:01:30,507
There are footprints up here.

29
00:01:30,542 --> 00:01:32,392
They come up
from the pond and...

30
00:01:32,427 --> 00:01:35,512
looks like they got out
of whatever landed.

31
00:01:35,547 --> 00:01:38,648
Appears to be
some evidence that...

32
00:01:38,683 --> 00:01:40,517
we'll call you back.

33
00:01:40,552 --> 00:01:41,768
What's it all about?

34
00:01:41,803 --> 00:01:43,019
We don't know yet.

35
00:01:43,054 --> 00:01:44,270
How's that?

36
00:01:44,305 --> 00:01:47,407
We'll, uh... we'll call you back
in a little bit.

37
00:01:47,442 --> 00:01:48,658
All right, padgett

38
00:01:48,693 --> 00:01:51,778
but there's talk of the bridge
going out up there.

39
00:01:51,813 --> 00:01:53,663
When you can, take a look

40
00:01:53,698 --> 00:01:56,166
and make sure she's posted
and blocked off.

41
00:01:56,201 --> 00:01:59,285
Enough ice jammed against it
to cool the congo.

42
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,537
Roger and out.

43
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:13,299
No question about it.

44
00:02:13,334 --> 00:02:15,802
Something left
that pond...

45
00:02:15,837 --> 00:02:18,304
and went over
to the diner.

46
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,441
Looks like a bus

47
00:02:21,476 --> 00:02:22,692
in front
of that diner.

48
00:02:22,727 --> 00:02:23,943
You don't suppose

49
00:02:23,978 --> 00:02:25,812
it came out of
that pond, do you?

50
00:02:25,847 --> 00:02:27,063
Very funny.

51
00:02:27,098 --> 00:02:28,314
Sorry.

52
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:29,566
Let's leave the car

53
00:02:29,601 --> 00:02:31,451
and follow
these tracks.

54
00:02:31,486 --> 00:02:33,953
I want to be sure
they lead to the diner.

55
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:36,206
Wintry february night,
the present.

56
00:02:36,241 --> 00:02:39,325
A phone call
from a frightened woman

57
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,462
notating the arrival
of an unidentified flying object

58
00:02:42,497 --> 00:02:44,330
then the check-out you witnessed

59
00:02:44,365 --> 00:02:46,833
with two state troopers
verifying the event

60
00:02:46,868 --> 00:02:49,335
but with nothing
more enlightening to add

61
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,221
beyond evidence of some tracks

62
00:02:51,256 --> 00:02:53,723
leading across the highway
to a diner.

63
00:02:53,758 --> 00:02:56,843
You've heard of trying to find
a needle in a haystack?

64
00:02:56,878 --> 00:02:59,979
Well, stay with us and you'll be
part of an investigating team

65
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:03,099
whose mission is not to find
that proverbial needle-

66
00:03:03,134 --> 00:03:04,984
no, their task is even harder.

67
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:06,853
They've got to find
a martian in a diner

68
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:09,355
and in just a moment
you'll search with them

69
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:12,492
because you've just landed
in the twilight zone.

70
00:03:43,907 --> 00:03:45,158
Trouble?

71
00:03:51,915 --> 00:03:53,800
Whose bus is this
out here?

72
00:03:53,835 --> 00:03:55,051
That's mine,
officer.

73
00:03:55,086 --> 00:03:57,053
What's the problem?

74
00:03:57,088 --> 00:03:57,670
The bridge up ahead

75
00:03:57,705 --> 00:04:00,173
has been declared
temporarily impassable.

76
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:02,058
Ice floe stacked up
against it.

77
00:04:02,093 --> 00:04:02,675
Another pound
of weight

78
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:04,560
and it could be
driftwood.

79
00:04:04,595 --> 00:04:05,178
That's rough.

80
00:04:05,213 --> 00:04:06,429
Can't go back.

81
00:04:06,464 --> 00:04:08,932
There's a slide
up at the turnoff.

82
00:04:08,967 --> 00:04:10,183
Blocked
the whole road.

83
00:04:10,218 --> 00:04:12,068
Looks like
you're marooned.

84
00:04:12,103 --> 00:04:13,319
Till morning, anyway.

85
00:04:13,354 --> 00:04:14,570
Till morning?

86
00:04:14,605 --> 00:04:17,073
I've got to be in
boston at 9:00 a.m.

87
00:04:17,108 --> 00:04:20,193
You better start
walking, mister

88
00:04:20,228 --> 00:04:23,947
because that bus stays out there
until they fix the bridge.

89
00:04:23,982 --> 00:04:25,832
Either that or have them drop
some snowshoes.

90
00:04:25,867 --> 00:04:27,450
So you might as well
all get comfortable

91
00:04:27,485 --> 00:04:28,701
and get a little
hot food in you.

92
00:04:28,736 --> 00:04:30,586
Oh, that's just great.

93
00:04:30,621 --> 00:04:32,455
That's fine,
isn't it?

94
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:34,958
Get comfortable and get
a little hot food in you.

95
00:04:34,993 --> 00:04:36,843
That's precious
little consolation

96
00:04:36,878 --> 00:04:38,711
for missing my
meeting in boston.

97
00:04:40,748 --> 00:04:43,216
That's a fine bus
line you work for.

98
00:04:43,251 --> 00:04:44,467
They care so much

99
00:04:44,502 --> 00:04:46,352
about their schedules,
don't they?

100
00:04:46,387 --> 00:04:48,221
I wouldn't be too hard on them.

101
00:04:48,256 --> 00:04:50,723
They have no control
over the snow, bridges

102
00:04:50,758 --> 00:04:53,226
the sides of hills
that decide to come down.

103
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,111
That's pretty much
out of their hands.

104
00:05:05,488 --> 00:05:07,373
What do you think?

105
00:05:07,408 --> 00:05:10,493
They were all on the bus, weren't they?

106
00:05:10,528 --> 00:05:12,378
What's the trouble?
You looking for somebody?

107
00:05:15,498 --> 00:05:17,383
Driver, uh...

108
00:05:17,418 --> 00:05:19,886
you got a passenger
manifest?

109
00:05:21,137 --> 00:05:22,388
Passenger manifest?

110
00:05:22,423 --> 00:05:23,639
What do you think

111
00:05:23,674 --> 00:05:26,142
i got parked
out there, a 707?

112
00:05:26,177 --> 00:05:27,643
That's a 14-year-old bus

113
00:05:27,678 --> 00:05:28,895
and business is lousy.

114
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:31,397
My boss would run rum
across the border

115
00:05:31,432 --> 00:05:33,266
if there was a profit in it.

116
00:05:34,517 --> 00:05:37,020
I don't ask passengers
their names.

117
00:05:37,055 --> 00:05:39,522
We kiss them gently
and help them in.

118
00:05:39,557 --> 00:05:42,025
We're that glad to have them,
with or without names.

119
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,910
You know how many you had?

120
00:05:44,527 --> 00:05:45,778
Six.

121
00:05:45,813 --> 00:05:47,663
Unless one of them
fell out the window

122
00:05:47,698 --> 00:05:48,915
when we hit
a bump.

123
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,166
I picked up six

124
00:05:50,201 --> 00:05:52,668
and i'm supposed
to deliver six.

125
00:05:52,703 --> 00:05:53,920
Nobody fell out.

126
00:05:53,955 --> 00:05:55,788
Somebody must have jumped in.

127
00:05:55,823 --> 00:05:57,673
There are seven here now.

128
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:04,547
That's funny.

129
00:06:10,553 --> 00:06:13,439
I know i had
six people.

130
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:17,193
Thanks.

131
00:06:17,228 --> 00:06:19,062
Tell me, was there
anybody in here

132
00:06:19,097 --> 00:06:20,947
before the bus
stopped?

133
00:06:20,982 --> 00:06:22,815
No, i haven't
served anybody

134
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:24,067
since 11:00
this morning.

135
00:06:24,102 --> 00:06:26,569
I figured this whole
bunch got off the bus.

136
00:06:27,203 --> 00:06:29,822
We did- there was no one
in here when we came in.

137
00:06:29,857 --> 00:06:32,075
Then how do you account
for seven people?

138
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:35,328
That one beats me.

139
00:06:38,081 --> 00:06:41,217
One of them didn't
get off the bus.

140
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:44,587
Which one of you
wasn't on the bus?

141
00:06:44,622 --> 00:06:46,722
We were all
on the bus.

142
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:52,728
What kind of interrogation
is this, anyway?

143
00:06:52,763 --> 00:06:55,231
If we're going to be grilled,
i want to talk to a lawyer.

144
00:06:55,883 --> 00:06:57,100
That's a good one!

145
00:06:57,135 --> 00:06:59,602
First he wants snowshoes,
then he wants a lawyer.

146
00:07:00,236 --> 00:07:03,356
I don't remember
seeingyouon the bus.

147
00:07:03,391 --> 00:07:04,607
That's quite funny

148
00:07:04,642 --> 00:07:07,743
because i don't remember
seeing you neither.

149
00:07:07,778 --> 00:07:09,612
Makes one of us a liar,
don't it?

150
00:07:10,781 --> 00:07:12,615
This is preposterous.

151
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:14,117
What difference
does it make

152
00:07:14,152 --> 00:07:15,368
who was on the bus
and who wasn't

153
00:07:15,403 --> 00:07:17,870
or whether there were
six or seven or 120?

154
00:07:17,905 --> 00:07:21,007
Is this a diner
or gestapo headquarters?

155
00:07:21,042 --> 00:07:23,876
Oh, now, take it
easy, mister.

156
00:07:23,911 --> 00:07:25,761
What's it all about?

157
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:28,264
Did you hear
anything

158
00:07:28,299 --> 00:07:30,133
flying over
here tonight?

159
00:07:30,168 --> 00:07:30,883
Flying over here?

160
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:33,386
No, i haven't heard anything.

161
00:07:33,421 --> 00:07:35,271
We got a call
about two hours ago.

162
00:07:35,306 --> 00:07:39,025
Woman said she heard something
fly over and then come down.

163
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,893
Fly over here?

164
00:07:40,928 --> 00:07:42,778
From where?

165
00:07:42,813 --> 00:07:44,647
From up
there.

166
00:07:44,682 --> 00:07:47,400
An unidentified flying object.

167
00:07:47,435 --> 00:07:49,902
Unidentified flying object?

168
00:07:49,937 --> 00:07:53,656
Nothing's come down
from up there except snow.

169
00:07:53,691 --> 00:07:54,657
That's all
i've seen

170
00:07:54,692 --> 00:07:57,160
for the past
14 hours- snow.

171
00:07:57,195 --> 00:07:59,045
Where did she say
it came down?

172
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,296
Close to here.

173
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:03,549
Look, something did
land in tracy's pond.

174
00:08:03,584 --> 00:08:05,418
Left a trail
of broken branches

175
00:08:05,453 --> 00:08:06,669
before it hit.

176
00:08:06,704 --> 00:08:09,172
We found tracks
leading away from it.

177
00:08:09,207 --> 00:08:10,423
To where?

178
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:11,674
To here.

179
00:08:11,709 --> 00:08:14,060
You mean something landed
in tracy's pond

180
00:08:14,095 --> 00:08:15,311
and then came in here?

181
00:08:15,346 --> 00:08:16,562
That's crazy.

182
00:08:16,597 --> 00:08:19,682
Nothing's come in here
since 11:00 this morning.

183
00:08:19,717 --> 00:08:20,933
Nothing, except...

184
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:22,818
except me and
my passengers.

185
00:08:22,853 --> 00:08:25,321
Me and
six people.

186
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:28,574
That means that...

187
00:08:29,192 --> 00:08:32,328
one person here...

188
00:08:33,829 --> 00:08:36,332
george, i don't
like this.

189
00:08:36,367 --> 00:08:37,583
Easy, honey, easy.

190
00:08:37,618 --> 00:08:39,452
Let me get
this straight.

191
00:08:39,487 --> 00:08:40,703
You're trying
to tell us

192
00:08:40,738 --> 00:08:42,588
that there's one
person in here

193
00:08:42,623 --> 00:08:45,091
who landed in some
kind of a saucer

194
00:08:45,126 --> 00:08:46,342
and then came
in here?

195
00:08:46,377 --> 00:08:47,960
Came in here with us?

196
00:08:49,845 --> 00:08:52,348
Well, that's just not possible.

197
00:08:52,383 --> 00:08:53,599
We'd have seen them.

198
00:08:53,634 --> 00:08:54,850
Not necessarily.

199
00:08:54,885 --> 00:08:56,219
It's snowing
and dark.

200
00:08:56,254 --> 00:08:58,104
We climbed off
of that bus

201
00:08:58,139 --> 00:09:00,606
with our eyes closed
to get out of the snow.

202
00:09:00,641 --> 00:09:03,109
Anyone could have come in with
us and we wouldn't have noticed.

203
00:09:03,144 --> 00:09:04,727
You were all on
the bus together.

204
00:09:04,762 --> 00:09:07,230
You would have known
who the other passengers were.

205
00:09:07,265 --> 00:09:08,981
That don't
cut any ice.

206
00:09:09,016 --> 00:09:10,233
They loaded in the
snow at hook's landing.

207
00:09:10,268 --> 00:09:12,735
Tell you the truth,
i don't know who got on.

208
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:15,871
She's just like a science
fiction, that's what she is.

209
00:09:15,906 --> 00:09:17,123
A regular ray bradbury.

210
00:09:18,374 --> 00:09:20,243
Six humans
and one monster

211
00:09:20,278 --> 00:09:22,995
from outer space...

212
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:25,248
you wouldn't happen
to have an eye

213
00:09:25,283 --> 00:09:28,384
in the back
of your head, would you?

214
00:09:28,419 --> 00:09:30,886
I find you offensive,
you know that?

215
00:09:30,921 --> 00:09:33,389
What do you do now, officer?

216
00:09:33,424 --> 00:09:37,760
Look, lady, this isn't exactly
par for our courses either.

217
00:09:37,795 --> 00:09:41,514
We go off on a lot of nutty
assignments but this one...

218
00:09:41,549 --> 00:09:42,765
wow.

219
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,650
Well, i know how you begin.

220
00:09:44,685 --> 00:09:46,519
You pair off the couples.

221
00:09:46,554 --> 00:09:50,906
Since it's just one person
who doesn't belong here, you...

222
00:09:50,941 --> 00:09:52,775
you eliminate the couples.

223
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:54,277
We're exonerated.

224
00:09:54,312 --> 00:09:55,528
Cross us off.

225
00:09:55,563 --> 00:09:57,413
We're two
of the humans.

226
00:09:57,448 --> 00:09:59,282
Us, too

227
00:09:59,317 --> 00:10:00,533
my wife and i.

228
00:10:00,568 --> 00:10:02,418
We're in the clear.

229
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,789
What's the matter?

230
00:10:06,824 --> 00:10:08,040
I... i could
have sworn

231
00:10:08,075 --> 00:10:09,925
you had a mole
on your chin.

232
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:13,045
Mole on my chin?

233
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,182
Connie, i've never had
a mole on my chin.

234
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:18,684
I can tell you
what's going to happen.

235
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:20,553
We're all going
to get so panicky

236
00:10:20,588 --> 00:10:23,055
that everyone will
start picking up

237
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:25,558
invisible clues
from everybody else.

238
00:10:25,593 --> 00:10:26,809
This is nonsense.

239
00:10:26,844 --> 00:10:27,560
Of course it's nonsense

240
00:10:27,595 --> 00:10:30,062
if a husband and wife
start wondering

241
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:32,565
whether the husband
is really the husband

242
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,450
and the wife... is...

243
00:10:34,485 --> 00:10:36,319
now, wait a minute.

244
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:38,954
23 years is long enough

245
00:10:38,989 --> 00:10:41,457
for a woman to know
who she's married to.

246
00:10:41,492 --> 00:10:43,959
So i'll thank you
to stop looking at me

247
00:10:43,994 --> 00:10:46,462
as if i'd just put on this face
as part of a costume.

248
00:10:48,964 --> 00:10:50,833
I love this.

249
00:10:50,868 --> 00:10:52,718
She don't know who he is.

250
00:10:52,753 --> 00:10:54,587
He don't know who she is.

251
00:10:54,622 --> 00:10:56,472
We don't know who she is.

252
00:10:56,507 --> 00:10:58,974
And this lemon-sucker here

253
00:10:59,009 --> 00:11:01,477
he's the most suspicious
of the bunch.

254
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:07,233
You got a back door
to this place?

255
00:11:07,268 --> 00:11:09,101
Sure, why?

256
00:11:09,136 --> 00:11:10,486
Go back there and lock it.

257
00:11:10,521 --> 00:11:12,355
It's already
locked.

258
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:15,491
If that certain somebody
really is from outer space

259
00:11:15,526 --> 00:11:17,360
they'll just go
through the wall.

260
00:11:17,395 --> 00:11:18,611
Check them
for wings!

261
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:20,613
Check them for wings!

262
00:11:20,648 --> 00:11:21,864
Look under their coats.

263
00:11:25,501 --> 00:11:28,371
You got identification, grandpa?

264
00:11:30,005 --> 00:11:31,874
Left it in the pond
in my spaceship.

265
00:11:31,909 --> 00:11:34,377
Who won the world
series last year?

266
00:11:34,412 --> 00:11:37,513
What is this, a sort of
prolonged practical joke?

267
00:11:37,548 --> 00:11:38,764
I get it, i get it!

268
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:40,633
Pittsburgh pirates
won it.

269
00:11:40,668 --> 00:11:43,769
Took four out of seven
from the yankees.

270
00:11:43,804 --> 00:11:45,020
Eh?

271
00:11:45,055 --> 00:11:46,889
Sharp boys,
real sharp boys.

272
00:11:46,924 --> 00:11:50,025
Didn't figure us martians
would know nothing

273
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:52,528
about the great american
pastime, did you?

274
00:11:52,563 --> 00:11:53,145
Huh? Huh!

275
00:12:00,536 --> 00:12:03,539
You got
identification, miss?

276
00:12:03,574 --> 00:12:06,659
Well, no,
as a matter of fact, i don't.

277
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:12,298
I left my wallet...
i left it in my suitcase.

278
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:14,800
It was shipped on ahead.

279
00:12:14,835 --> 00:12:16,669
What's your name, miss?

280
00:12:16,704 --> 00:12:20,306
Ethel mcconnell,
i'm a professional dancer.

281
00:12:20,341 --> 00:12:23,058
How many legs?

282
00:12:23,426 --> 00:12:25,311
I'm going to belt you, grandpa.

283
00:12:25,346 --> 00:12:27,813
She was on the bus.

284
00:12:27,848 --> 00:12:29,315
How do you know?

285
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:32,568
She's the only one
i noticed.

286
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:36,439
Well, thank you.

287
00:12:36,474 --> 00:12:38,574
But who
noticed him?

288
00:12:42,945 --> 00:12:44,830
How do we know
you're the same one

289
00:12:45,448 --> 00:12:46,081
driving the bus?

290
00:12:46,116 --> 00:12:47,950
Ain't nobody
been exonerated yet

291
00:12:48,584 --> 00:12:49,201
that's for sure.

292
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:50,953
Let's cut this farce out.

293
00:12:50,988 --> 00:12:52,838
We'll all show
our identifications

294
00:12:52,873 --> 00:12:54,089
and put a stop to it.

295
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:56,592
The whole thing's ridiculous.

296
00:12:56,627 --> 00:12:57,960
Then how do
you explain

297
00:12:57,995 --> 00:12:59,845
the extra person
in here?

298
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,096
Yes, how
about that?

299
00:13:02,965 --> 00:13:04,216
Very simple.

300
00:13:04,251 --> 00:13:05,468
The driver's mistaken.

301
00:13:05,503 --> 00:13:07,353
Seven people
got on the bus

302
00:13:07,388 --> 00:13:09,855
and he thought
there were only six.

303
00:13:11,474 --> 00:13:13,359
Is that
possible?

304
00:13:13,394 --> 00:13:15,227
Not a chance
in the world.

305
00:13:15,262 --> 00:13:18,364
I counted heads
before we took off.

306
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,232
There were
sixpeople.

307
00:13:22,117 --> 00:13:22,735
Miss...

308
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,759
what caused that?

309
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:52,014
We, uh...

310
00:13:52,049 --> 00:13:54,517
we may get a laugh
out of all this

311
00:13:54,552 --> 00:13:55,768
in the morning

312
00:13:55,803 --> 00:13:57,019
in the meantime

313
00:13:57,054 --> 00:13:59,522
everyone stay right
where they are.

314
00:14:27,883 --> 00:14:29,768
Where are the troopers?

315
00:14:29,803 --> 00:14:32,271
Hmm? Oh,
stepped outside.

316
00:14:32,306 --> 00:14:34,773
Snow stopped.

317
00:14:34,808 --> 00:14:36,642
Say, haley...

318
00:14:36,677 --> 00:14:38,527
that wasn't your gag,
was it?

319
00:14:38,562 --> 00:14:41,647
I mean, the business about
the jukebox starting like that?

320
00:14:41,682 --> 00:14:44,783
Not me. I'm strictly short
orders and pay your taxes.

321
00:14:44,818 --> 00:14:47,903
I don't know anything
about science fiction.

322
00:14:47,938 --> 00:14:50,406
A jukebox is a jukebox,
and if that thing

323
00:14:50,441 --> 00:14:52,291
wants to start up
all on its own,

324
00:14:52,326 --> 00:14:54,159
you'll check with an
electrical engineer.

325
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:02,918
Take me to your leader.

326
00:15:02,953 --> 00:15:04,169
Take me to your leader!

327
00:15:16,565 --> 00:15:17,816
Find anything?

328
00:15:17,851 --> 00:15:18,434
No.

329
00:15:18,469 --> 00:15:20,319
Took a look
at the bridge.

330
00:15:20,354 --> 00:15:21,570
Holding up well.

331
00:15:21,605 --> 00:15:23,439
I know
that bridge.

332
00:15:23,474 --> 00:15:25,324
What's more,
i don't trust it.

333
00:15:25,359 --> 00:15:26,575
Well,
thank goodness

334
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:29,078
we needn't
concern ourselves

335
00:15:29,113 --> 00:15:30,329
with your judgment.

336
00:15:30,364 --> 00:15:32,448
If the bridge gets
a clean bill of health

337
00:15:32,483 --> 00:15:34,333
you'll drive that bus
right across it.

338
00:15:34,368 --> 00:15:36,201
Listen, you may be
a big shot in boston

339
00:15:36,236 --> 00:15:38,704
but when it comes
to bridges and buses

340
00:15:38,739 --> 00:15:39,955
i got seniority

341
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:41,206
and i tell you

342
00:15:41,241 --> 00:15:43,092
that bridge is
so old that...

343
00:15:47,096 --> 00:15:49,598
hey, what is this?

344
00:15:49,633 --> 00:15:52,101
Why did the lights
go out like that?

345
00:15:53,969 --> 00:15:55,220
We may be
losing power.

346
00:16:02,513 --> 00:16:03,729
This is weird.

347
00:16:03,764 --> 00:16:06,982
This is
just plain weird.

348
00:16:11,405 --> 00:16:13,122
Well, i wish
whoever it was

349
00:16:13,157 --> 00:16:14,990
would play his
cards right now.

350
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:16,625
Why don't they
do something?

351
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:19,745
What's the point of us
all staying cooped up

352
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:22,247
in here like this
and... and not...

353
00:16:22,282 --> 00:16:24,383
the point is
this, miss.

354
00:16:24,418 --> 00:16:25,884
We're all kids
in a closet here.

355
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:27,753
Nobody understands
what's going on.

356
00:16:27,788 --> 00:16:30,506
If there was some kind of a
saucer that landed in that pond

357
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:32,391
and he did
come in here

358
00:16:32,426 --> 00:16:34,259
i think it would be
a real healthy idea

359
00:16:34,294 --> 00:16:35,511
if we pinpointed that
particular somebody

360
00:16:36,145 --> 00:16:36,762
and kept him
from leaving.

361
00:16:36,797 --> 00:16:38,013
Makes sense.

362
00:16:38,048 --> 00:16:39,898
Maybe whoever it is
is invisible.

363
00:16:39,933 --> 00:16:41,767
Maybe they're
playing around.

364
00:16:41,802 --> 00:16:43,018
Cat and mouse.

365
00:16:43,053 --> 00:16:45,654
That is childish nonsense.

366
00:16:45,689 --> 00:16:46,905
It's as good
an explanation

367
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,157
as any i've heard.

368
00:16:48,192 --> 00:16:50,025
But what if the...

369
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,778
the thing doesn't
show itself?

370
00:16:52,813 --> 00:16:55,280
Do we just sit here
holding our breath?

371
00:16:55,315 --> 00:16:56,532
Yes. How about that?

372
00:16:56,567 --> 00:16:59,034
Well, if somebody
was to ask me...

373
00:16:59,069 --> 00:17:01,537
well, no one did ask you,
and no one will.

374
00:17:02,171 --> 00:17:04,673
Why don't you leave
the old man alone.

375
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:07,176
Who invited you into this?

376
00:17:07,211 --> 00:17:09,678
Well, i didn't realize we were
waiting for invitations,

377
00:17:09,713 --> 00:17:12,181
but you've got this big thing
about bossing everybody around.

378
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:16,301
Look, it's tough enough
just sitting here without...

379
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:36,321
get over there
and sit down, gramps.

380
00:17:49,585 --> 00:17:50,836
Yeah.

381
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:54,590
What's that?

382
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:55,841
It's okay?

383
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:00,229
All right, thanks.

384
00:18:02,097 --> 00:18:03,348
The bridge is okay.

385
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,985
Well, it's about time.

386
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,854
Shall we go?

387
00:18:08,889 --> 00:18:10,739
What do you think,
perry?

388
00:18:10,774 --> 00:18:11,990
Can't hold them.

389
00:18:12,025 --> 00:18:13,859
You're making
a big mistake, officer.

390
00:18:13,894 --> 00:18:15,110
Big mistake.

391
00:18:15,145 --> 00:18:16,995
You're letting
a monster out.

392
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,864
That may well be,
old man.

393
00:18:18,899 --> 00:18:19,498
May well be.

394
00:18:19,533 --> 00:18:20,749
Can't hold somebody

395
00:18:20,784 --> 00:18:23,252
on suspicion
of being a monster.

396
00:18:23,287 --> 00:18:25,120
You can roll them any time.

397
00:18:25,155 --> 00:18:26,371
All right.

398
00:18:26,406 --> 00:18:28,507
Are they sure
about that bridge?

399
00:18:28,542 --> 00:18:29,758
I don't like
that sucker.

400
00:18:29,793 --> 00:18:31,627
She swings
in the wind

401
00:18:31,662 --> 00:18:32,878
and she's not
a suspension.

402
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:35,514
That was the county engineer.

403
00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:37,633
The bridge has been checked out

404
00:18:37,668 --> 00:18:39,518
and declared
passable.

405
00:18:39,553 --> 00:18:42,020
We'll go on ahead,
cross the bridge first.

406
00:18:42,055 --> 00:18:44,523
You can pay your checks
right over here

407
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:45,774
ladies and gentlemen.

408
00:18:45,809 --> 00:18:48,277
Godspeed and
a safe trip.

409
00:18:48,312 --> 00:18:49,778
And you all come back

410
00:18:49,813 --> 00:18:51,647
and see us again,
you hear?

411
00:18:51,682 --> 00:18:55,400
That is...
all but one of you.

412
00:18:55,435 --> 00:18:57,536
Now, you had
the chili, right?

413
00:18:57,571 --> 00:18:59,404
That's 90 cents.

414
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:00,789
Thank you.

415
00:19:00,824 --> 00:19:03,792
And you had, what,
14 cups of coffee

416
00:19:03,827 --> 00:19:05,043
that was $1.40.

417
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:08,797
Good-bye, officer.

418
00:19:08,832 --> 00:19:10,666
Miss mcconnell.

419
00:19:20,676 --> 00:19:23,178
Well, i counted seven.

420
00:19:23,213 --> 00:19:24,429
That's right, seven.

421
00:19:24,464 --> 00:19:26,932
Betcha by the time we get
to boston, there'll be 17.

422
00:19:55,711 --> 00:19:56,962
Something for you?

423
00:19:58,213 --> 00:20:00,098
Coffee- black.

424
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:03,852
One coffee, black.

425
00:20:08,857 --> 00:20:11,360
Hey, uh,
didn't you, uh...

426
00:20:11,395 --> 00:20:13,228
what i mean is...

427
00:20:13,263 --> 00:20:15,731
didn't you go
out on that bus?

428
00:20:15,766 --> 00:20:16,982
I did indeed.

429
00:20:17,017 --> 00:20:20,118
Oh, yes, i went out
on that bus.

430
00:20:20,153 --> 00:20:21,987
And do you know
something?

431
00:20:22,022 --> 00:20:24,122
That bridge wasn't safe.

432
00:20:24,157 --> 00:20:25,991
It collapsed.

433
00:20:26,026 --> 00:20:29,745
The state police car,
the bus, everything

434
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:32,247
kerplunk, right into the river.

435
00:20:32,282 --> 00:20:34,750
It was a terrible scene.

436
00:20:34,785 --> 00:20:36,001
No one got out.

437
00:20:37,252 --> 00:20:37,886
Except you.

438
00:20:40,389 --> 00:20:41,640
Except me.

439
00:20:41,675 --> 00:20:45,394
Lucky, i guess, huh?

440
00:20:45,429 --> 00:20:47,262
Very lucky.

441
00:20:47,297 --> 00:20:49,147
But... but...

442
00:20:49,765 --> 00:20:51,016
but... what?

443
00:20:52,901 --> 00:20:54,152
You're not even wet.

444
00:20:55,404 --> 00:20:56,655
Wet...

445
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:57,906
what's "wet?"

446
00:20:57,941 --> 00:21:00,409
What do you mean
"what's 'wet? '"

447
00:21:00,444 --> 00:21:03,528
You landed in the river
but your clothes are all dry.

448
00:21:03,563 --> 00:21:05,280
Illusion, that's all.

449
00:21:05,315 --> 00:21:06,531
Just an illusion.

450
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:10,285
Like that jukebox
playing in the corner.

451
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,537
That's an
illusion, too.

452
00:21:16,925 --> 00:21:20,679
Or, uh, that
telephone ringing.

453
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:28,553
That's an illusion.

454
00:21:28,588 --> 00:21:30,439
Just a parlor trick.

455
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,809
What are you,
some kind of magician?

456
00:21:33,844 --> 00:21:35,560
Who, me?

457
00:21:35,595 --> 00:21:37,446
Oh, hardly.

458
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:44,820
Now, uh, before you,
uh, faint dead away

459
00:21:44,855 --> 00:21:49,825
i ought to explain that
the name isn't really ross...

460
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:54,830
and, uh, i wasn't
really going to boston.

461
00:21:54,865 --> 00:21:56,715
No, i was sent

462
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,217
as a kind of
advance scout.

463
00:21:59,252 --> 00:22:02,971
You know, these, uh...
cigarettes, do you call them?

464
00:22:03,006 --> 00:22:04,840
They taste wonderful.

465
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:07,342
We haven't got a thing
like this on mars.

466
00:22:07,377 --> 00:22:09,845
That's incidentally
where i come from.

467
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,981
We're beginning to colonize.

468
00:22:13,016 --> 00:22:16,101
My friends will be arriving
very shortly.

469
00:22:16,136 --> 00:22:18,603
I think they're
going to like it here.

470
00:22:18,638 --> 00:22:20,489
It's a lovely area.

471
00:22:20,524 --> 00:22:26,745
So... so remote, so pleasant,
so off the beaten track.

472
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:29,247
Just the perfect
spot for a colony

473
00:22:29,282 --> 00:22:31,750
don't you think,
mr. Haley?

474
00:22:31,785 --> 00:22:33,251
While we're waiting

475
00:22:33,286 --> 00:22:37,005
how about a little
what you call music?

476
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,874
I don't mind.

477
00:22:38,909 --> 00:22:41,376
I have to do a
little waiting myself.

478
00:22:41,411 --> 00:22:43,879
You see, mr. Ross...

479
00:22:43,914 --> 00:22:46,381
my name isn't haley.

480
00:22:46,416 --> 00:22:47,632
And i do agree with you.

481
00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:50,769
This is an extraordinary
place to colonize.

482
00:22:50,804 --> 00:22:53,271
We folks on venus
had the same idea.

483
00:22:53,306 --> 00:22:55,140
We got it
several years ago.

484
00:22:55,175 --> 00:22:58,894
And i think i really
ought to tell you now

485
00:22:58,929 --> 00:23:01,396
that your friends
are not coming.

486
00:23:01,431 --> 00:23:03,281
They've been
intercepted.

487
00:23:03,316 --> 00:23:05,784
Oh, a colony is coming.

488
00:23:06,401 --> 00:23:09,538
But it's from venus.

489
00:23:09,573 --> 00:23:12,657
And if you're still alive...

490
00:23:12,692 --> 00:23:15,794
i think you'll see
how we differ.

491
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,051
And i agree with you

492
00:23:23,668 --> 00:23:25,554
about what they
call music.

493
00:23:25,589 --> 00:23:28,056
Why don't you
play some?

494
00:23:33,061 --> 00:23:38,066
Incident on a small island,
to be believed or disbelieved.

495
00:23:38,101 --> 00:23:40,569
However, if a sour-faced dandy
named ross

496
00:23:40,604 --> 00:23:43,939
or a big, good-natured
counterman who handles a spatula

497
00:23:43,974 --> 00:23:46,441
as if he'd been born with one
in his mouth

498
00:23:46,476 --> 00:23:49,077
if either of these two entities
walk onto your premises

499
00:23:49,112 --> 00:23:52,197
you better hold their hands-
all three of them-

500
00:23:52,232 --> 00:23:55,333
or check the color of
their eyes- all three of them.

501
00:23:55,368 --> 00:23:57,202
The gentlemen in question

502
00:23:57,237 --> 00:24:00,956
might try to pull you
into the twilight zone.

503
00:24:03,758 --> 00:24:06,261
Rod serling, creator
ofthe twilight zone

504
00:24:06,296 --> 00:24:08,130
will tell you
about next week's story

505
00:24:08,165 --> 00:24:11,733
after this word
from our alternate sponsor.

506
00:24:12,234 --> 00:24:13,268
And now, mr. Serling.

507
00:24:13,303 --> 00:24:17,022
Mr. Burgess meredith is no
stranger to the twilight zone

508
00:24:17,057 --> 00:24:18,890
but his role
in next week's story

509
00:24:18,925 --> 00:24:20,142
is a unique one, even for him.

510
00:24:20,177 --> 00:24:23,895
The time will be the future,
the place just about anywhere

511
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:26,398
where men have been taken over
by a machine state.

512
00:24:26,433 --> 00:24:28,900
Our story is called
"the obsolete man."

513
00:24:28,935 --> 00:24:30,785
It may chill, it may provoke

514
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:32,654
but we're rather certain
it will leave a mark.

515
00:24:32,689 --> 00:24:35,790
Next week onthe twilight zone,
"the obsolete man."
