1
00:00:06,007 --> 00:00:09,109
You unlock this door
with the key of imagination.

2
00:00:09,144 --> 00:00:11,611
Beyond it is another dimension-

3
00:00:11,646 --> 00:00:13,480
a dimension of sound,

4
00:00:13,515 --> 00:00:15,365
a dimension of sight,

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,867
a dimension of mind.

6
00:00:17,902 --> 00:00:20,370
You're moving into a land
of both shadow and substance,

7
00:00:20,405 --> 00:00:22,238
of things and ideas.

8
00:00:22,273 --> 00:00:25,992
You've just crossed over
into the twilight zone.

9
00:00:34,751 --> 00:00:37,253
Picture of the spaceship e-89,

10
00:00:37,288 --> 00:00:41,007
cruising above the 13th planet
of star system 51.

11
00:00:41,042 --> 00:00:44,144
The year, 1997.

12
00:00:44,179 --> 00:00:45,512
In a little while, supposedly,

13
00:00:45,547 --> 00:00:47,397
the ship will be landed
and specimens taken-

14
00:00:47,432 --> 00:00:50,517
vegetable, mineral,
and, if any, animal.

15
00:00:50,552 --> 00:00:54,404
These will be brought back
to overpopulated earth

16
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:55,772
where technicians
will evaluate them,

17
00:00:55,807 --> 00:00:57,657
and if everything
is satisfactory,

18
00:00:57,692 --> 00:01:00,160
stamp their findings
with the word "inhabitable"

19
00:01:00,195 --> 00:01:03,530
and open up yet another planet
for colonization.

20
00:01:03,565 --> 00:01:07,283
These are the things
that aresupposedto happen.

21
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,789
Captain.

22
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,543
Something glittered
down there.

23
00:01:20,296 --> 00:01:23,683
It was at, uh,
255-417.

24
00:01:23,718 --> 00:01:26,186
I don't see anything.

25
00:01:26,221 --> 00:01:27,437
Something glittered.

26
00:01:27,472 --> 00:01:29,305
We've passed it now.

27
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,808
Well, we went over
a lake, you know.

28
00:01:32,442 --> 00:01:34,310
I know, sir,
it wasn't that.

29
00:01:34,345 --> 00:01:36,196
Okay, we'll have a look.

30
00:01:36,813 --> 00:01:38,698
But it was
probably the lake.

31
00:01:54,831 --> 00:01:57,967
Probably
wasting our time.

32
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:01,221
What are we turning for?

33
00:02:01,256 --> 00:02:02,472
What is it?

34
00:02:02,507 --> 00:02:04,340
Is something down there?

35
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:05,592
Mason thinks so.

36
00:02:05,627 --> 00:02:06,843
There was something.

37
00:02:06,878 --> 00:02:08,094
What?

38
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:11,231
I don't know yet.

39
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,602
We're almost there.

40
00:02:15,637 --> 00:02:17,487
I know what
you're thinking.

41
00:02:17,522 --> 00:02:18,738
Don't.

42
00:02:18,773 --> 00:02:21,241
It's got to happen sometime,
doesn't it?

43
00:02:21,276 --> 00:02:22,492
You're alien-contact
happy.

44
00:02:22,527 --> 00:02:24,360
About time.
Do you really think

45
00:02:24,994 --> 00:02:27,497
man's the only intelligent
life in the universe?

46
00:02:27,532 --> 00:02:28,748
All right,
not again.

47
00:02:28,783 --> 00:02:30,617
We're meeting
another race. Great.

48
00:02:30,652 --> 00:02:31,868
It would
be great.

49
00:02:31,903 --> 00:02:35,004
Man, wouldn't
that be something!
It's got
to happen...

50
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:36,256
why not to us?

51
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:37,507
There it is.

52
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:41,511
Looks like it might be a ship.

53
00:02:41,546 --> 00:02:43,379
Hardly.

54
00:02:45,381 --> 00:02:48,518
You mean
you're still not going to land?

55
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,387
Will you
take it easy?

56
00:02:51,422 --> 00:02:52,639
Will you?!

57
00:02:56,392 --> 00:02:59,529
We should take
specimens.

58
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:05,785
I don't like it.

59
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:08,288
Well, it's up
to you, captain.

60
00:03:11,407 --> 00:03:12,659
Okay.

61
00:03:14,544 --> 00:03:16,412
Ted, we're going down!

62
00:03:16,447 --> 00:03:18,915
We're-we're
going down!

63
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:21,417
I can't even talk
to him anymore.

64
00:03:21,452 --> 00:03:23,303
Yeah, what's
the matter with him?

65
00:03:23,338 --> 00:03:25,171
He's acting
strange lately.

66
00:03:25,206 --> 00:03:27,056
I don't know.

67
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:31,177
Air spring.

68
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:48,077
Places!

69
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:48,004
Picture of the crew
of the spaceship e-89:

70
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:49,639
Captain ross,

71
00:04:49,674 --> 00:04:50,890
lieutenant mason,

72
00:04:50,925 --> 00:04:52,141
lieutenant carter.

73
00:04:52,176 --> 00:04:54,644
Three men who have
just reached a place

74
00:04:54,679 --> 00:04:57,764
which is as far from home
as they will ever be.

75
00:04:57,799 --> 00:04:59,649
Three men
who in a matter of minutes

76
00:04:59,684 --> 00:05:02,151
will be plunged into
the darkest nightmare reaches

77
00:05:02,186 --> 00:05:04,654
of the twilight zone.

78
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:43,393
I'll, uh... check
the atmosphere.

79
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:59,659
We won't need helmets.

80
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:14,057
Mike.

81
00:06:14,092 --> 00:06:15,925
Mike!

82
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,428
Oh, thanks.

83
00:06:18,463 --> 00:06:20,313
Your jumper, captain.
Mason!

84
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:24,067
You can't wait to get out there,
can you?

85
00:06:24,102 --> 00:06:26,569
What's that supposed to mean?

86
00:06:26,604 --> 00:06:29,072
It means i don't like impetuous
crewmen; they make mistakes.

87
00:06:29,107 --> 00:06:31,574
Have i made any mistakes,
captain?

88
00:06:31,609 --> 00:06:33,192
You're on the verge.

89
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:36,195
Let me know when i make them.

90
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,865
We stay together.

91
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,734
No one takes any risks.

92
00:07:14,769 --> 00:07:17,236
That's an order, mason.

93
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,739
Yes, sir.

94
00:07:28,498 --> 00:07:31,634
Looks like one of our ships,
doesn't it?

95
00:07:31,669 --> 00:07:34,137
Don't jump
to conclusions.

96
00:07:34,172 --> 00:07:35,388
Well, doesn't it?

97
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:37,890
From what i
can see of the
rockets, it does.

98
00:07:37,925 --> 00:07:40,393
Rocket construction
could be standard everywhere.

99
00:07:40,428 --> 00:07:42,895
Even on another planet,
captain?

100
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,764
That's enough!

101
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:13,176
Itisone
of our ships.

102
00:08:13,211 --> 00:08:16,929
How could it get
this far off course?

103
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:20,683
I don't like it.

104
00:08:25,054 --> 00:08:26,305
Well, aren't we
going to go in

105
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,442
and find out
who they are?

106
00:08:30,693 --> 00:08:35,064
All right...
but stay together.

107
00:08:52,715 --> 00:08:54,584
It's from earth.

108
00:08:54,619 --> 00:08:55,835
There's no
doubt about it.

109
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,086
We don't know that.

110
00:08:57,121 --> 00:08:58,971
But look at the
structuring,
captain.

111
00:08:59,006 --> 00:09:00,840
We don't know that,
carter.

112
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,910
Nope.

113
00:10:10,945 --> 00:10:12,161
Well, maybe
it's pressurized.

114
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:15,298
No, it's not
very likely.

115
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:17,166
The door frame
is probably twisted.

116
00:10:17,201 --> 00:10:17,800
Try it
together, eh?

117
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:20,303
Yeah.

118
00:10:21,589 --> 00:10:22,805
If it doesn't open,

119
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,056
we'll have to
forget about it.

120
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:26,559
Forget about it?
There isn't time!

121
00:10:29,714 --> 00:10:30,930
It's moving!

122
00:10:30,965 --> 00:10:31,564
All right.

123
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:33,492
Here.

124
00:12:04,407 --> 00:12:07,159
Dear god.

125
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:13,476
Try the auxiliary
light system.

126
00:13:13,511 --> 00:13:15,344
The auxiliary
light system!

127
00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:17,847
Move!

128
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:20,983
I don't
understand.

129
00:13:21,018 --> 00:13:23,486
Oh, it's not
what it seems.

130
00:13:23,521 --> 00:13:24,103
I don't
understand.

131
00:13:24,138 --> 00:13:26,605
Will you hang on?

132
00:14:11,033 --> 00:14:13,536
Put it back.

133
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:23,546
Put it back!

134
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:42,181
What is this?

135
00:14:42,216 --> 00:14:43,816
All right,
don't let it get to you.

136
00:14:43,851 --> 00:14:46,318
It's me.

137
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:50,072
Come away.

138
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:52,575
It's me.

139
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:57,580
I said come away.

140
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:00,082
Carter!

141
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,719
It's not what it seems.

142
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:43,492
That was us
in there.

143
00:15:45,995 --> 00:15:47,246
We're dead.

144
00:15:47,281 --> 00:15:49,131
Can you imagine
what it was like

145
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:50,382
when this thing hit?

146
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:53,502
We're dead.

147
00:15:53,537 --> 00:15:54,753
Can you imagine?

148
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:56,005
No, our ship
is where we left it,

149
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:56,639
just as we left it.

150
00:15:56,674 --> 00:15:57,890
That isn't our ship!

151
00:15:57,925 --> 00:15:59,141
Those aren't our bodies!

152
00:15:59,176 --> 00:16:01,010
Can you imagine?
But they are!

153
00:16:01,045 --> 00:16:02,895
No. I don't
know what it is,

154
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:04,763
but there's a logical
explanation for this.

155
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:07,266
Everything has a
logical explanation!

156
00:16:07,301 --> 00:16:09,768
This is me...
imagine...

157
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:11,654
this is you...

158
00:16:11,689 --> 00:16:13,522
use your head.
It's not what it seems!

159
00:16:13,557 --> 00:16:14,773
Well, then, what is it?
What is it?

160
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:18,527
I don't know,
but think.

161
00:16:28,537 --> 00:16:29,788
Mason!

162
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:31,040
Yes, sir?

163
00:16:31,075 --> 00:16:32,291
We're leaving.
We're going back to the ship.

164
00:16:32,326 --> 00:16:34,176
Radio the station.
They'll tell us what to do.

165
00:16:34,211 --> 00:16:35,427
Yes, sir.

166
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:39,181
Shouldn't we bury...
our...

167
00:16:39,216 --> 00:16:42,301
they're not ours.
Will you go ahead?

168
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:46,689
We're alive.

169
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,808
Alive.

170
00:17:49,653 --> 00:17:52,121
Try it again.

171
00:17:52,156 --> 00:17:54,006
Captain,
i've been trying...

172
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:55,874
just try it again.

173
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:05,768
Earth station 1217,
earth station 1217,

174
00:18:05,803 --> 00:18:09,521
this is spaceship e-89,
e-89.

175
00:18:09,556 --> 00:18:10,773
Do you read me?

176
00:18:10,808 --> 00:18:15,144
Come in,
earth station 1217. over.

177
00:18:25,654 --> 00:18:26,905
What is this?

178
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:30,042
It was working before.

179
00:18:30,077 --> 00:18:31,910
Maybe it's
this planet.

180
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:33,162
What are
you talking about?

181
00:18:33,197 --> 00:18:34,413
Maybe there's an
interfering field...

182
00:18:34,448 --> 00:18:35,664
don't be ridiculous.

183
00:18:35,699 --> 00:18:36,915
Try the radionic signal.

184
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,801
Captain, it's not
going to work...
will you do

185
00:18:38,836 --> 00:18:40,669
what i tell you once?!

186
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:44,673
Yes, sir.

187
00:19:03,477 --> 00:19:05,327
Again.

188
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:20,959
Again.

189
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:22,344
Captain, if it didn't work

190
00:19:22,379 --> 00:19:25,464
the first time...
they didn't hear us.

191
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:27,966
This return signal works
on automatic.

192
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:29,218
Do i have to tell you that?

193
00:19:30,219 --> 00:19:33,355
All right.

194
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:35,858
But let's go over this
again and again,

195
00:19:35,893 --> 00:19:37,726
because there's got to be
an answer somewhere.

196
00:19:37,761 --> 00:19:38,977
Somewhere!

197
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:40,863
First, those are not
our bodies over there.

198
00:19:40,898 --> 00:19:42,114
That i'm sure of.

199
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:47,870
Now, use your heads.

200
00:19:47,905 --> 00:19:50,372
These are our bodies.

201
00:19:57,996 --> 00:20:00,499
These are our bodies!

202
00:20:20,402 --> 00:20:22,271
Listen.

203
00:20:22,306 --> 00:20:23,522
Wait a minute.

204
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:25,407
Do you both
remember

205
00:20:25,442 --> 00:20:26,658
what they told us
once in training

206
00:20:26,693 --> 00:20:28,527
about the theory of
circumnavigating time?

207
00:20:28,562 --> 00:20:30,779
They said it might be possible
for us to leave the earth

208
00:20:30,814 --> 00:20:33,282
during one year;
then, when we got back,

209
00:20:33,317 --> 00:20:35,167
though we thought
it was the same year,

210
00:20:35,202 --> 00:20:37,035
it might be the year before
or the year after.

211
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:37,669
Remember that?

212
00:20:37,704 --> 00:20:40,172
That was just a theory, captain.

213
00:20:40,207 --> 00:20:41,423
No, no, it's
not a theory,

214
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:43,292
because that's what's
happened to us!

215
00:20:43,327 --> 00:20:45,177
We've gone into some
kind of time warp

216
00:20:45,212 --> 00:20:46,428
right into the future.

217
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:49,047
And that ship standing out there
is in the future?

218
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:50,299
Is that what you're saying?

219
00:20:50,334 --> 00:20:52,801
No, no, only
the probable future.

220
00:20:52,836 --> 00:20:54,052
What does that mean?

221
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:56,555
That means we're not dead.

222
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:59,691
And it also means
we're going to be dead.

223
00:20:59,726 --> 00:21:00,943
Not if we don't go up.

224
00:21:00,978 --> 00:21:03,445
If we don't go up,
we can't crash.

225
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,696
Now, it's the only answer.

226
00:21:04,731 --> 00:21:06,448
We're alive
now, mason.

227
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:07,699
The only way
to make certain

228
00:21:07,734 --> 00:21:09,568
that we stay alive-
you, carter, me-

229
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:10,819
is not to go up.

230
00:21:10,854 --> 00:21:12,070
Then we can't crash.

231
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:14,573
We avoid it,
we prevent it.

232
00:21:14,608 --> 00:21:16,458
We stay.

233
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:22,464
That's easy enough
for you to decide, captain.

234
00:21:22,499 --> 00:21:23,081
Now, what does that mean?

235
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:26,835
You've got no one waiting
for you back on earth.

236
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,725
I've made my decision.

237
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,228
I say we vote on it.

238
00:21:36,845 --> 00:21:38,730
You do?

239
00:21:38,765 --> 00:21:41,233
You're not the only one,
captain.

240
00:21:41,268 --> 00:21:43,101
I'm the only one
that gives the orders.

241
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:44,987
Even where our lives
are concerned?

242
00:21:45,022 --> 00:21:46,855
Especially where your lives
are concerned!

243
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:50,609
I said we stay!

244
00:21:50,644 --> 00:21:51,860
For how long,
captain?

245
00:21:51,895 --> 00:21:53,111
I'm not setting
any limit, carter.

246
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:54,363
One month? Two months?
A year?

247
00:21:54,398 --> 00:21:55,614
I said i'm
not setting...
we don't have

248
00:21:55,649 --> 00:21:57,499
enough food to stay
that long.

249
00:21:57,534 --> 00:21:58,750
I've no doubt there's
edible food outside.

250
00:21:58,785 --> 00:22:00,369
How will we know what's edible
and what isn't?

251
00:22:00,404 --> 00:22:01,620
We have no testing equipment.

252
00:22:01,655 --> 00:22:03,255
We'll watch the animals.

253
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:05,257
I saw no animals, captain,
did you?

254
00:22:05,292 --> 00:22:06,258
There will be.

255
00:22:06,293 --> 00:22:08,010
If there are, it'll be
a different form of life

256
00:22:08,045 --> 00:22:09,261
from what we know.

257
00:22:09,296 --> 00:22:10,512
What could edible to them

258
00:22:10,547 --> 00:22:11,763
might be deadly poisonous
for us!

259
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:13,632
We'll worry about
that when the
time comes.

260
00:22:13,667 --> 00:22:14,883
The only important thing now

261
00:22:14,918 --> 00:22:16,768
is the preservation
of our lives!

262
00:22:16,803 --> 00:22:19,271
Now, it may not be necessary
to stay here permanently.

263
00:22:19,306 --> 00:22:20,522
We may figure something out.

264
00:22:20,557 --> 00:22:23,025
But for now,
the decision is to stay.

265
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,276
Not our decision.

266
00:22:24,311 --> 00:22:26,778
Have you a better solution?

267
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,585
Working at minimum capacity,

268
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:27,339
the ship's electrical system
can hold out for months.

269
00:23:27,374 --> 00:23:28,590
We won't be working

270
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:31,093
at minimum
capacity, captain.

271
00:23:31,128 --> 00:23:32,344
Why?

272
00:23:32,379 --> 00:23:37,599
'Cause we're going
to need heat- lots of it.

273
00:23:37,634 --> 00:23:39,468
It's only twilight,

274
00:23:39,503 --> 00:23:43,221
and already
the outside temperature is...

275
00:23:43,256 --> 00:23:45,107
minus 13 degrees.

276
00:23:45,142 --> 00:23:46,975
Would you rather go up,

277
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:51,363
take a risk of duplicating
that ship out there?

278
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:54,483
I don't know.

279
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:58,870
How could we
duplicate it,
captain?

280
00:23:58,905 --> 00:24:00,122
How can there...

281
00:24:00,157 --> 00:24:03,241
how can there be
two crashed ships

282
00:24:03,276 --> 00:24:04,493
two of me dead,

283
00:24:04,528 --> 00:24:06,995
two of you,
two of mason?

284
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:09,498
We'll go over it again.

285
00:24:09,533 --> 00:24:12,000
Eventually,
we'll find an answer.

286
00:25:22,954 --> 00:25:24,206
Hey, mike!

287
00:25:26,109 --> 00:25:27,959
Hi, boy.
When'd you get home?

288
00:25:27,994 --> 00:25:30,462
You're on leave, huh?

289
00:25:30,497 --> 00:25:32,330
Huh?

290
00:25:32,365 --> 00:25:34,216
I...

291
00:25:34,251 --> 00:25:36,084
well, you're looking fit.

292
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:39,838
I'll bet mary's glad
to have you back, huh?

293
00:25:39,873 --> 00:25:42,340
Mary?

294
00:25:44,226 --> 00:25:47,345
Uh, you mind if i walk
with you, mike?

295
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:50,482
When'd you get home?

296
00:25:50,517 --> 00:25:52,350
L-i just got here.

297
00:25:52,385 --> 00:25:55,487
You... well, i must say,
you rocket boys

298
00:25:55,522 --> 00:25:57,989
are traveling
informally these days.

299
00:25:58,024 --> 00:26:00,492
Uh, does, uh...
mary know you're coming?

300
00:26:00,527 --> 00:26:02,994
I don't think so.

301
00:26:03,029 --> 00:26:06,114
Oh, you're going
to surprise her, huh?

302
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:06,748
Yeah.

303
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:09,251
How long you got?

304
00:26:09,286 --> 00:26:11,753
I don't know.

305
00:26:11,788 --> 00:26:14,873
You all right, mike?

306
00:26:14,908 --> 00:26:17,375
Hello, mike.

307
00:26:19,377 --> 00:26:21,263
Hello, mike.

308
00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:26,268
Home on furlough?

309
00:26:30,639 --> 00:26:33,141
I don't know.

310
00:26:41,283 --> 00:26:42,534
Old mrs. Nolan.

311
00:26:42,569 --> 00:26:45,654
Still makes that long walk
to town every day.

312
00:26:45,689 --> 00:26:47,539
She'll go on forever.

313
00:26:47,574 --> 00:26:49,407
Hey, mike, now you're back,
how about some hunting, huh?

314
00:26:49,442 --> 00:26:52,544
Not that i ever hit anything
with this thing, but...

315
00:26:52,579 --> 00:26:54,412
hey! Hey, mike!

316
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,418
Mary!

317
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:03,555
Mary!

318
00:27:11,813 --> 00:27:14,316
Mary! Honey, i'm home!

319
00:27:16,818 --> 00:27:18,687
Mary?

320
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:22,440
Mary, honey...

321
00:27:23,692 --> 00:27:25,577
honey?

322
00:27:26,828 --> 00:27:28,697
Mary?

323
00:27:31,199 --> 00:27:32,450
Mary?

324
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:39,958
Mary?

325
00:27:41,209 --> 00:27:43,094
Mary?

326
00:28:18,246 --> 00:28:22,000
Carter?

327
00:28:22,035 --> 00:28:24,502
Carter.

328
00:28:24,537 --> 00:28:27,639
Carter, i'm talking
to you!

329
00:28:31,393 --> 00:28:33,261
What's the matter
with you?

330
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:42,654
What's the matter
with you?

331
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:50,161
I was home.

332
00:28:50,196 --> 00:28:52,664
What?

333
00:28:52,699 --> 00:28:55,784
I was home.

334
00:28:55,819 --> 00:28:57,669
You were here.

335
00:28:57,704 --> 00:28:59,537
Youarehere.

336
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,925
No...

337
00:29:04,542 --> 00:29:05,794
no.

338
00:29:05,829 --> 00:29:08,296
I swear i was home!

339
00:29:10,181 --> 00:29:12,050
There was a telegram...

340
00:29:15,804 --> 00:29:18,306
it said i'd been killed.

341
00:29:18,341 --> 00:29:20,191
Oh, no.

342
00:29:20,226 --> 00:29:23,311
No, you're alive.

343
00:29:24,562 --> 00:29:25,814
No.

344
00:29:25,849 --> 00:29:28,316
Those people-

345
00:29:28,351 --> 00:29:31,453
kramer, mrs. Nolan...

346
00:29:34,572 --> 00:29:37,075
they're dead!

347
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,960
I just remembered that!

348
00:29:38,995 --> 00:29:40,829
Now, stop it, carter.

349
00:29:40,864 --> 00:29:42,714
No, no, kramer,
kramer...

350
00:29:42,749 --> 00:29:44,582
he got killed in
a hunting accident.

351
00:29:44,617 --> 00:29:46,468
Mrs. Nolan...
now, you stop it!

352
00:29:46,503 --> 00:29:47,085
Now, you were here
all the time.

353
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,336
It never happened.

354
00:29:48,371 --> 00:29:50,221
There's an explanation
somewhere, and i'll find it.

355
00:29:50,256 --> 00:29:51,473
I swear to you,
we'll find it.

356
00:29:51,508 --> 00:29:53,975
You and mason and me,
we'll fi...

357
00:30:07,856 --> 00:30:09,741
mason!

358
00:30:12,243 --> 00:30:14,112
Mason!

359
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:21,002
Mason.

360
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:43,691
Twilight zonewill continue
after station identification.

361
00:30:53,451 --> 00:30:55,320
Mason.

362
00:30:55,355 --> 00:30:56,955
Where is he?

363
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:59,457
Where did he go?

364
00:30:59,492 --> 00:31:01,709
I don't know.

365
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,753
Oh, daddy,
i thought i'd never find you.

366
00:31:45,788 --> 00:31:47,872
Jeannie.

367
00:31:47,907 --> 00:31:51,259
I've looked and looked.

368
00:31:51,294 --> 00:31:53,761
I found him, i found him!

369
00:31:55,013 --> 00:31:56,881
Lunch is ready, daddy.

370
00:31:56,916 --> 00:31:58,883
And am i hungry

371
00:31:58,918 --> 00:32:01,386
after all that
searching.

372
00:32:03,271 --> 00:32:05,640
What's the matter, daddy?

373
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:13,147
Come here.

374
00:32:16,284 --> 00:32:18,152
What, daddy?

375
00:32:19,287 --> 00:32:20,538
Oh!

376
00:32:20,573 --> 00:32:24,292
Jeannie, jeannie.

377
00:32:24,327 --> 00:32:27,412
What is it, daddy?

378
00:32:28,663 --> 00:32:31,799
Oh, baby, is it you?

379
00:32:31,834 --> 00:32:33,051
What's wrong, daddy?

380
00:32:33,086 --> 00:32:34,919
Nothing, honey,
nothing.

381
00:32:34,954 --> 00:32:37,422
I'm just happy
to see you, that's all.

382
00:32:38,056 --> 00:32:38,673
Oh.

383
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:42,927
Was that your mother

384
00:32:42,962 --> 00:32:44,178
you were calling to
just now?

385
00:32:44,213 --> 00:32:45,430
Was it, honey?

386
00:32:45,465 --> 00:32:47,315
Yes, daddy.

387
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:48,566
You know.

388
00:32:48,601 --> 00:32:49,817
Where is she?

389
00:32:49,852 --> 00:32:52,937
Over by the
table, daddy.

390
00:32:52,972 --> 00:32:56,074
You stay right here.

391
00:32:56,109 --> 00:32:57,325
Don't go away.

392
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,193
Okay.

393
00:33:47,875 --> 00:33:49,127
Ted!

394
00:33:49,162 --> 00:33:50,128
Well, you startled me,

395
00:33:50,745 --> 00:33:53,881
bursting out of the bushes
like that.

396
00:34:01,389 --> 00:34:03,891
Ted? What is it?

397
00:34:08,431 --> 00:34:10,898
Oh, ruth.

398
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:14,652
Ruth.

399
00:34:14,687 --> 00:34:16,521
Sweetheart,
what's wrong?

400
00:34:18,406 --> 00:34:19,657
Nothing.

401
00:34:19,692 --> 00:34:21,526
Nothing now.

402
00:34:23,411 --> 00:34:25,279
Are you sure?

403
00:34:25,314 --> 00:34:27,165
Yes, i'm sure.

404
00:34:30,284 --> 00:34:32,787
Ah! Oh, all this,
just for lunch?

405
00:34:32,822 --> 00:34:34,038
My goodness.

406
00:34:34,073 --> 00:34:36,541
So emotional over
a little fried chicken.

407
00:34:36,576 --> 00:34:39,043
Where's jeannie?

408
00:34:39,078 --> 00:34:40,928
Back there.

409
00:34:42,797 --> 00:34:44,682
Were you asleep?

410
00:34:44,717 --> 00:34:46,551
Are you still asleep?

411
00:34:46,586 --> 00:34:51,939
Oh, if i am, i hope
i never wake up.

412
00:34:52,557 --> 00:34:55,693
I just want to
keep on dreaming.

413
00:35:07,071 --> 00:35:08,956
Let's go, mason.

414
00:35:08,991 --> 00:35:10,958
Ted, why is he here?

415
00:35:10,993 --> 00:35:12,827
Get out of here.

416
00:35:12,862 --> 00:35:14,579
I said let's go.

417
00:35:15,463 --> 00:35:17,331
Keep away from here.

418
00:35:17,366 --> 00:35:19,217
You're coming back
with me.

419
00:35:19,252 --> 00:35:20,468
Back?

420
00:35:20,503 --> 00:35:22,837
Where you belong, on the ship.

421
00:35:22,872 --> 00:35:24,338
No, ted.

422
00:35:24,373 --> 00:35:27,475
You're having
a hallucination, lieutenant.

423
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:30,595
No. No, it's real.

424
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:31,846
It isn't.

425
00:35:31,881 --> 00:35:33,097
You're coming with me.

426
00:35:33,731 --> 00:35:35,099
No. Now, keep away.

427
00:35:35,134 --> 00:35:36,984
Keep away from me!

428
00:35:37,019 --> 00:35:38,853
No!

429
00:35:44,992 --> 00:35:46,861
You're coming back!

430
00:35:46,896 --> 00:35:48,746
No, i'm staying.

431
00:35:48,781 --> 00:35:49,997
Let me go.

432
00:35:52,366 --> 00:35:54,252
Let go of me!

433
00:36:08,668 --> 00:36:10,518
I don't want to be here.

434
00:36:10,553 --> 00:36:14,889
I don't want
to be here.

435
00:36:14,924 --> 00:36:17,391
Ruth...

436
00:36:17,426 --> 00:36:19,277
ruth.

437
00:36:19,312 --> 00:36:21,145
Ruth?

438
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,648
Ruth.

439
00:36:23,683 --> 00:36:26,784
Ruth...

440
00:36:26,819 --> 00:36:29,287
ruth!

441
00:36:29,322 --> 00:36:31,155
There was no ruth,
no jeannie.

442
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:48,055
What does that say?

443
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:51,175
Read it.

444
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:53,811
"The wife and daughter
of space pilot ted mason died

445
00:36:53,846 --> 00:36:56,430
"early this morning
when the car that..."

446
00:36:56,465 --> 00:37:00,184
don't you see, ted?
You weren't there.

447
00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:01,435
You weren't there.

448
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:05,189
They're dead.
You're alive.

449
00:37:05,224 --> 00:37:07,692
I was there, paul.

450
00:37:08,326 --> 00:37:10,194
I was, i was.

451
00:37:10,229 --> 00:37:11,445
No, no, it just...
you took me away.

452
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,697
No, it isn't true.

453
00:37:12,732 --> 00:37:13,948
Isn't it?

454
00:37:13,983 --> 00:37:17,084
You took me away
from my wife and my home.

455
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:18,953
Well, you were both
here all the time.

456
00:37:18,988 --> 00:37:20,838
He was gone!

457
00:37:20,873 --> 00:37:23,341
No. We just couldn't
see him, that's all.

458
00:37:23,376 --> 00:37:24,592
What are
you talking about?

459
00:37:24,627 --> 00:37:27,094
I know what
it is now.

460
00:37:27,129 --> 00:37:28,963
That's what i'm
talking about.

461
00:37:28,998 --> 00:37:32,099
I was wrong.

462
00:37:38,356 --> 00:37:39,724
I was wrong.

463
00:37:39,759 --> 00:37:43,477
It has nothing to do
with circumnavigating time.

464
00:37:43,512 --> 00:37:44,729
Nothing at all.

465
00:37:44,764 --> 00:37:46,731
Remember what
you thought

466
00:37:46,766 --> 00:37:47,982
before you saw that
ship over there?

467
00:37:48,616 --> 00:37:51,235
Alien contact-
that's what you thought.

468
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:54,372
Well, that's exactly
what's happened to us.

469
00:37:54,407 --> 00:37:57,625
I thought you didn't
believe in alien contact.

470
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,876
Listen to me.

471
00:37:58,911 --> 00:38:00,628
Neither of you were home.

472
00:38:00,663 --> 00:38:03,130
That is not our ship.
Those are not our bodies.

473
00:38:03,165 --> 00:38:04,382
We've been tricked.

474
00:38:04,417 --> 00:38:05,383
By whom?

475
00:38:05,418 --> 00:38:06,634
By whoever it
is that lives

476
00:38:06,669 --> 00:38:07,885
on this planet
and doesn't want

477
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,136
anyone else
to live here.

478
00:38:11,138 --> 00:38:13,641
Well, don't you understand?

479
00:38:13,676 --> 00:38:15,509
We haven't been able
to see them,

480
00:38:15,544 --> 00:38:17,395
but there are aliens here...

481
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:19,263
but aliens who aren't
strong enough to kill us

482
00:38:19,298 --> 00:38:21,148
or drive us away by force.

483
00:38:21,183 --> 00:38:23,150
So what can they do?

484
00:38:23,185 --> 00:38:25,019
How can they keep
their planet

485
00:38:25,054 --> 00:38:26,270
from being colonized?

486
00:38:26,305 --> 00:38:28,773
By mind control.

487
00:38:28,808 --> 00:38:31,275
By picking
our brains

488
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:33,778
and finding
the death fear

489
00:38:33,813 --> 00:38:37,531
and making use of it
by-by showing our crashed ship

490
00:38:37,566 --> 00:38:38,783
and us dead inside it.

491
00:38:38,818 --> 00:38:40,668
Scaring us so much

492
00:38:40,703 --> 00:38:43,170
that we didn't dare
take off again.

493
00:38:43,205 --> 00:38:45,673
Therefore, we weren't
able to make a report

494
00:38:45,708 --> 00:38:46,924
about this planet.

495
00:38:46,959 --> 00:38:49,677
They even know that we can't
make a radio report

496
00:38:49,712 --> 00:38:52,179
back to earth because there's
too much interference here.

497
00:38:52,214 --> 00:38:54,548
A short while ago,
you didn't believe

498
00:38:54,583 --> 00:38:55,800
there was any
interference.

499
00:38:55,835 --> 00:38:57,685
I believe it now.

500
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:01,439
Everything that has happened
on this planet since we landed

501
00:39:01,474 --> 00:39:02,690
has been a delusion.

502
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:07,061
Oh, no...

503
00:39:07,096 --> 00:39:09,563
no, no, this happened.

504
00:39:09,598 --> 00:39:10,815
It happened.

505
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:11,699
It was a delusion.

506
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:14,819
Even mason's
disappearance?

507
00:39:14,854 --> 00:39:16,704
Why not?

508
00:39:16,739 --> 00:39:19,824
If they could make us believe
that we saw a crashed ship

509
00:39:19,859 --> 00:39:21,709
and our bodies inside that ship,

510
00:39:21,744 --> 00:39:23,577
they could make us believe
anything.

511
00:39:23,612 --> 00:39:26,213
It isn't out there, then?

512
00:39:26,248 --> 00:39:27,081
Oh, maybe you can see it.

513
00:39:27,116 --> 00:39:28,966
You may still be able
to touch it again,

514
00:39:29,001 --> 00:39:30,835
but that doesn't prove
it's really there.

515
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:34,338
What's going to prove
it isn't there, paul?

516
00:39:34,373 --> 00:39:38,092
What's going to prove
that you're right now?

517
00:39:38,127 --> 00:39:40,227
What's going to prove that?

518
00:39:40,262 --> 00:39:43,347
Us... going up...

519
00:39:43,382 --> 00:39:46,484
all the way back to earth.

520
00:39:46,519 --> 00:39:47,351
Proving there's
nothing

521
00:39:47,386 --> 00:39:49,854
keeping us here
but deluded fear.

522
00:39:51,739 --> 00:39:52,990
Wait a minute!

523
00:39:53,025 --> 00:39:57,361
Wait, wait a minute.

524
00:39:57,396 --> 00:39:58,612
Now, what if
you're wrong?

525
00:39:58,647 --> 00:39:59,864
I'm right.

526
00:39:59,899 --> 00:40:01,749
You thought you
were right before.

527
00:40:01,784 --> 00:40:03,617
You were ready to keep
us here indefinitely,

528
00:40:03,652 --> 00:40:05,503
you were so sure.

529
00:40:05,538 --> 00:40:07,371
Are you positive
enough now

530
00:40:07,406 --> 00:40:09,874
to risk all our
lives, paul?

531
00:40:09,909 --> 00:40:12,376
Yes, i am.

532
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:15,513
I'm not.

533
00:40:18,132 --> 00:40:19,383
Put it away, carter.

534
00:40:19,418 --> 00:40:21,268
Now, you're not going
to take us up.

535
00:40:21,303 --> 00:40:24,388
Remember what you said?

536
00:40:24,423 --> 00:40:25,022
If we stayed here,

537
00:40:25,057 --> 00:40:26,891
we'd freeze to death
or starve to death...

538
00:40:26,926 --> 00:40:29,393
you'd never see
earth again.

539
00:40:29,428 --> 00:40:30,644
He's right, mike.

540
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:33,531
That's no answer.
Put it away.

541
00:40:38,035 --> 00:40:40,154
We've got to go up.

542
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:45,159
We've got to go up.

543
00:40:49,547 --> 00:40:53,300
Oh, god...

544
00:40:53,335 --> 00:40:57,054
have mercy on our souls.

545
00:41:45,152 --> 00:41:48,289
All right.

546
00:42:31,582 --> 00:42:34,702
All right.

547
00:42:34,737 --> 00:42:37,204
Here we go.

548
00:43:50,027 --> 00:43:51,278
Twenty.

549
00:43:56,917 --> 00:43:58,786
Forty...

550
00:44:03,208 --> 00:44:04,425
we're out!

551
00:44:09,930 --> 00:44:11,181
Well...

552
00:44:11,216 --> 00:44:13,050
you were right.

553
00:44:13,085 --> 00:44:14,301
He was right.

554
00:44:14,336 --> 00:44:16,186
Boy, if ever i see
anything glitter

555
00:44:16,221 --> 00:44:17,438
on that viewer again,

556
00:44:17,473 --> 00:44:19,306
i'll just keep
my big mouth shut!

557
00:44:19,341 --> 00:44:22,443
Yeah... i was right.

558
00:44:22,478 --> 00:44:24,945
Hey, what are you...
what are you doing?

559
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:26,814
What?
Preparing
for a landing.

560
00:44:26,849 --> 00:44:28,699
What?
Well, now that we know
what it is,

561
00:44:28,734 --> 00:44:29,950
there's no reason
we shouldn't go back.

562
00:44:29,985 --> 00:44:31,201
No reason?!
What, are you out
of your mind?!

563
00:44:31,236 --> 00:44:32,453
We have orders, carter-

564
00:44:32,488 --> 00:44:33,704
pick up specimens
of foreign life.

565
00:44:33,739 --> 00:44:34,955
We're going to pick them up.

566
00:44:34,990 --> 00:44:36,206
No, we're not!
Carter, get
your hands off!

567
00:44:36,241 --> 00:44:38,709
You idiot!
Let go of that thing!

568
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:46,216
You did it!
You did it!

569
00:44:46,251 --> 00:44:47,468
What'd i tell you?!

570
00:44:47,503 --> 00:44:48,719
We're going
to crash!
No!

571
00:44:48,754 --> 00:44:49,970
We're going
to die!

572
00:44:50,005 --> 00:44:53,090
No!

573
00:44:53,125 --> 00:44:55,592
No, we're not going
to die.

574
00:44:57,478 --> 00:44:59,346
Carter, auxiliary engines!

575
00:44:59,381 --> 00:45:01,231
It's no use.

576
00:45:01,266 --> 00:45:01,849
Carter!

577
00:45:02,483 --> 00:45:03,734
Carter, you fool!

578
00:45:06,271 --> 00:45:08,739
Auxiliaries on!

579
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:31,879
I don't understand.

580
00:45:31,914 --> 00:45:33,130
Shut up!

581
00:45:33,165 --> 00:45:36,266
You haven't even got the guts
to fight for your own life.

582
00:45:36,301 --> 00:45:38,135
Are we still
going down?

583
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:40,020
You bet
we're going down.

584
00:45:40,055 --> 00:45:40,637
And when we get there,
you'll see that ship

585
00:45:41,271 --> 00:45:42,523
is no longer there-
gone, vanished!

586
00:45:42,558 --> 00:45:45,025
Because it was never there
in the first place.

587
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:46,894
Air springs.

588
00:45:46,929 --> 00:45:48,779
Yes, sir.

589
00:46:00,657 --> 00:46:02,409
Get set for touchdown.

590
00:46:40,948 --> 00:46:43,450
It's gone.

591
00:46:45,335 --> 00:46:46,587
How do we know
we're facing

592
00:46:46,622 --> 00:46:49,706
the right direction,
captain?

593
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:33,500
Gone, captain?

594
00:47:33,535 --> 00:47:34,751
All right, it's
still there.

595
00:47:34,786 --> 00:47:36,637
That doesn't
mean anything.

596
00:47:36,672 --> 00:47:39,756
I'll tell you
what it means.

597
00:47:39,791 --> 00:47:41,642
It means you're wrong.

598
00:47:41,677 --> 00:47:43,510
There's an explanation
for this somewhere.

599
00:47:43,545 --> 00:47:45,395
I don't know what
it is, but i'm
going to find it.

600
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:46,647
Well, you'll
never know.

601
00:47:46,682 --> 00:47:48,515
You know why,
captain?

602
00:47:48,550 --> 00:47:51,018
Because we've got
to go back up again.

603
00:47:51,053 --> 00:47:54,154
And this time,
we're really going to crash!

604
00:47:54,189 --> 00:47:57,274
No, we're not.

605
00:47:59,776 --> 00:48:03,530
We're not going
to crash...

606
00:48:03,565 --> 00:48:07,284
because we already
have crashed.

607
00:48:07,319 --> 00:48:08,919
What are you talking about?

608
00:48:08,954 --> 00:48:12,422
Stop fighting
it, captain.

609
00:48:12,457 --> 00:48:14,291
You're all out
of explanations.

610
00:48:14,326 --> 00:48:16,176
There's only
one left, and
you know it.

611
00:48:16,211 --> 00:48:18,679
I know nothing of the kind.

612
00:48:19,296 --> 00:48:20,681
Oh, yes, you do.

613
00:48:20,716 --> 00:48:21,932
Carter was home.

614
00:48:21,967 --> 00:48:23,183
That telegram

615
00:48:23,218 --> 00:48:24,434
was really there.

616
00:48:24,469 --> 00:48:26,937
I was with my wife
and my daughter

617
00:48:26,972 --> 00:48:28,805
because i'm
just like them now.

618
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:30,057
No, no.

619
00:48:30,092 --> 00:48:31,558
Accept it, captain.

620
00:48:31,593 --> 00:48:34,695
Stop trying to prove
that we're alive.

621
00:48:34,730 --> 00:48:36,196
We are alive.

622
00:48:36,231 --> 00:48:38,065
There's something
happening here-

623
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:41,201
i don't know what it is, but
there's an explanation for it.

624
00:48:41,236 --> 00:48:42,819
I've given you
the explanation.

625
00:48:42,854 --> 00:48:45,205
I don't accept it!

626
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:48,325
We're going to go over it again
until i find the answer!

627
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:49,209
Can't you see?

628
00:48:49,244 --> 00:48:51,078
That's what we've
been doing-

629
00:48:51,113 --> 00:48:53,580
going over itagain.

630
00:48:55,465 --> 00:48:57,334
Let us go, paul.

631
00:48:57,369 --> 00:48:58,335
No.

632
00:48:58,370 --> 00:49:01,221
We're dead, paul.

633
00:49:01,256 --> 00:49:03,724
Let us die.

634
00:49:03,759 --> 00:49:06,226
We're going to
go over it again,
do you hear?

635
00:49:06,261 --> 00:49:07,477
We're going to
go over it again!

636
00:49:07,512 --> 00:49:11,231
We're going to go
over itagain!

637
00:49:16,987 --> 00:49:20,107
Captain.

638
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:23,860
Something glittered
down there.

639
00:49:25,112 --> 00:49:28,865
It was at, uh,
255-417.

640
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:30,751
I don't see anything.

641
00:49:30,786 --> 00:49:33,253
Picture of a man
who will not see anything

642
00:49:33,288 --> 00:49:37,007
he does not choose to see,
including his own death.

643
00:49:37,042 --> 00:49:39,509
A man of such indomitable will

644
00:49:39,544 --> 00:49:41,378
that even the two men
beneath his command

645
00:49:41,413 --> 00:49:43,880
are not allowed
to see the truth:

646
00:49:43,915 --> 00:49:48,385
Which truth is that they are
no longer among the living...

647
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:49,636
that the movements they make
and the words they speak

648
00:49:49,671 --> 00:49:53,390
have all been made and spoken
countless times before

649
00:49:53,425 --> 00:49:56,526
and will be made and spoken
countless times again,

650
00:49:56,561 --> 00:49:58,395
perhaps even unto eternity.

651
00:49:59,029 --> 00:50:01,648
Picture of a latter-day
flying dutchman

652
00:50:01,683 --> 00:50:05,402
sailing into the twilight zone.

653
00:50:14,711 --> 00:50:17,214
Next, we delve into the realm
of american folklore,

654
00:50:17,249 --> 00:50:19,082
and through the offices
of a fine writer

655
00:50:19,117 --> 00:50:22,836
named earl hamner jr.,
we peruse a little witchcraft

656
00:50:22,871 --> 00:50:25,338
and bring you a story called,
"jess-belle."

657
00:50:25,373 --> 00:50:27,841
This exercise in terror
and talismans

658
00:50:27,876 --> 00:50:30,343
stars anne francis
and james best.

659
00:50:30,378 --> 00:50:33,980
? form a ring, circle right
with a pretty little thing?

660
00:50:39,102 --> 00:50:41,605
? now break that ring
with a corner swing?

661
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:45,358
? go back home, do-sl-do...?

662
00:50:50,614 --> 00:50:52,499
Elly!

663
00:50:53,116 --> 00:50:56,870
Elly! Elly! Elly!

664
00:50:59,122 --> 00:51:02,375
I ain't never seen no cat
with spots like that.

665
00:51:09,516 --> 00:51:10,767
A witch.

666
00:51:10,802 --> 00:51:13,270
That cat was a witch.
