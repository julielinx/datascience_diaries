1
00:00:11,327 --> 00:00:13,830
You're traveling
through another dimension

2
00:00:13,865 --> 00:00:16,950
a dimension not only
of sight and sound, but of mind

3
00:00:16,985 --> 00:00:18,835
a journey into a wondrous land

4
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:21,204
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

5
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:23,089
That's the signpost up ahead.

6
00:00:23,124 --> 00:00:25,208
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

7
00:00:33,349 --> 00:00:34,601
There was a village

8
00:00:34,636 --> 00:00:37,103
built of crumbling clay
and rotting wood

9
00:00:37,138 --> 00:00:40,223
and it squatted, ugly,
under a broiling sun

10
00:00:40,258 --> 00:00:44,611
like a sick and mangy animal
wanting to die.

11
00:00:44,646 --> 00:00:47,731
This village had a virus
shared by its people.

12
00:00:47,766 --> 00:00:51,234
It was the germ of squalor,
of hopelessness

13
00:00:51,269 --> 00:00:53,737
of a loss of faith.

14
00:00:53,772 --> 00:00:57,490
For the faithless, the hopeless,
the misery-laden

15
00:00:57,525 --> 00:00:59,993
there is time, ample time

16
00:01:00,028 --> 00:01:03,747
to engage in one of the other
pursuits of men.

17
00:01:03,782 --> 00:01:06,883
They begin to destroy
themselves.

18
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:26,069
Ladies and gents,
it's me, peter sykes

19
00:01:26,104 --> 00:01:29,189
peter sykes, back from st. Louis

20
00:01:29,224 --> 00:01:33,576
stocked up with everything
that's necessary

21
00:01:33,611 --> 00:01:35,445
for kitchen and barn

22
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:39,833
and the dry throat
and the swollen tongue.

23
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:04,974
Ha, ha!

24
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:06,860
Young mr. Gallegos,
i believe.

25
00:02:06,895 --> 00:02:09,979
Now, this is a very
special day, isn't it?

26
00:02:10,014 --> 00:02:10,613
Now, let's see.

27
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:13,116
What is this special
day, eh?

28
00:02:13,151 --> 00:02:14,367
Ah, now i remember.

29
00:02:14,402 --> 00:02:17,487
It has just this moment
come back to me.

30
00:02:17,522 --> 00:02:19,989
Today you gonna get hanged.

31
00:02:23,126 --> 00:02:26,246
Today, young mr. Gallegos,
killer of children

32
00:02:26,281 --> 00:02:28,131
dances on the gallows.

33
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:37,257
Well, what will it be
for you today, mr. Koch?

34
00:02:37,292 --> 00:02:39,142
Don't need any more
rope, do you?

35
00:02:41,644 --> 00:02:44,147
You ought to see
the fancy, five-strand hemp

36
00:02:44,182 --> 00:02:46,649
i sold the town
for your party, gallegos.

37
00:02:46,684 --> 00:02:49,769
It could lift five of you.

38
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:52,906
Any more at home
like you, gallegos?

39
00:02:54,157 --> 00:02:57,277
Well, what will be
your fancy, mr. Koch?

40
00:02:58,528 --> 00:02:59,779
What do i fancy,
sykes?

41
00:02:59,814 --> 00:03:02,282
I'll tell you
what i fancy.

42
00:03:02,317 --> 00:03:02,916
I'd like you

43
00:03:02,951 --> 00:03:04,784
to take your
fat carcass

44
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:06,035
and your
loud mouth

45
00:03:06,669 --> 00:03:07,921
out into
the open air.

46
00:03:07,956 --> 00:03:09,672
This is a small room

47
00:03:09,707 --> 00:03:12,175
and it's a hot time
of the morning.

48
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:20,300
Well, what about you, gallegos?

49
00:03:20,335 --> 00:03:22,185
What would your pleasure be?

50
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,436
Nice hacksaw, maybe?

51
00:03:24,687 --> 00:03:27,190
There's going to be
a funeral procession

52
00:03:27,225 --> 00:03:29,058
down that street, gallegos.

53
00:03:29,093 --> 00:03:31,561
You better go to the window
and watch.

54
00:03:31,596 --> 00:03:33,446
They're burying
the little girl

55
00:03:33,481 --> 00:03:35,698
that you mangled
under your wagon.

56
00:03:35,733 --> 00:03:36,950
You sobered
up now, eh?

57
00:03:36,985 --> 00:03:38,818
You remember
the little girl

58
00:03:38,853 --> 00:03:40,069
don't you?

59
00:03:40,104 --> 00:03:41,704
You got stinking drunk

60
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:44,824
and you raced your wagon
down that street

61
00:03:44,859 --> 00:03:45,575
and what you did

62
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:47,460
to that poor
little girl...

63
00:03:48,077 --> 00:03:48,711
uh-uh, gallegos.

64
00:03:48,746 --> 00:03:49,963
Hey...

65
00:03:49,998 --> 00:03:51,831
you'll have
plenty of chance

66
00:03:51,866 --> 00:03:54,334
to move around
this afternoon.

67
00:03:54,369 --> 00:03:55,718
You'll be
able to kick

68
00:03:55,753 --> 00:03:57,587
and kick
and kick.

69
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:03,593
You ought to take a drink
of this, sheriff.

70
00:04:03,628 --> 00:04:04,844
It's a good tonic.

71
00:04:06,095 --> 00:04:07,347
Just the thing

72
00:04:07,382 --> 00:04:10,483
to set you up fine
for a hanging.

73
00:04:10,518 --> 00:04:12,986
Makes you strong
and firm.

74
00:04:13,021 --> 00:04:14,854
Here, feel this.

75
00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:17,857
I don't touch
dog meat, sykes.

76
00:04:17,892 --> 00:04:20,360
You talk big
behind a badge, koch.

77
00:04:20,395 --> 00:04:24,113
Just sounds big to you
because you're a midget, sykes.

78
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:29,002
You know, i always had
a little question about you.

79
00:04:29,037 --> 00:04:32,121
You always had a thing
for foreigners and strays

80
00:04:32,156 --> 00:04:34,007
but you're mighty tight-lipped

81
00:04:34,042 --> 00:04:36,509
when it comes to
one of your own.

82
00:04:36,544 --> 00:04:40,513
You're not my own, sykes,
so don't claim any kinship.

83
00:04:40,548 --> 00:04:42,015
As for that boy
in there

84
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:42,632
he had his trial

85
00:04:43,266 --> 00:04:45,134
and today he's going
to swing for it.

86
00:04:45,169 --> 00:04:47,020
There's nothing
in his sentence

87
00:04:47,055 --> 00:04:48,888
that says he's got
to be tormented

88
00:04:48,923 --> 00:04:51,391
by a pig who sells
trinkets at funerals.

89
00:04:53,276 --> 00:04:53,893
Go on, sykes.

90
00:04:53,928 --> 00:04:56,279
Get out of here.

91
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:16,666
When this day is over, which
one will you weep for, koch?

92
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,057
I have tears enough for both.

93
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:54,837
Mr. And mrs. Canfield,
i'm real sorry about this.

94
00:05:54,872 --> 00:05:56,706
My condolences
to you.

95
00:05:56,741 --> 00:05:57,957
This afternoon
will be

96
00:05:57,992 --> 00:05:59,208
a lot more
cheery.

97
00:05:59,243 --> 00:06:01,094
Yes, we going
to string up

98
00:06:01,129 --> 00:06:02,345
the dirty
little animal

99
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,596
that done this.

100
00:06:03,631 --> 00:06:04,847
She going to
be avenged.

101
00:06:04,882 --> 00:06:06,716
You can set
your mind to rest

102
00:06:06,751 --> 00:06:07,967
on that score.

103
00:06:08,002 --> 00:06:10,470
We'll string up that
mangler of children

104
00:06:10,505 --> 00:06:12,355
if it's the last
thing we do.

105
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:22,982
Some other time,
huh, sykes?

106
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:24,867
Some other time

107
00:06:24,902 --> 00:06:27,370
you act like a man
with no brains

108
00:06:27,405 --> 00:06:28,621
but... not now.

109
00:06:28,656 --> 00:06:31,124
Now you keep quiet.

110
00:06:31,159 --> 00:06:32,992
Now, look at that,
will you?

111
00:06:33,027 --> 00:06:34,494
Ain't that
the most gall

112
00:06:34,529 --> 00:06:36,379
you ever seen
in one place?

113
00:06:36,414 --> 00:06:38,998
Gallegos' old man
shows his face in town

114
00:06:39,033 --> 00:06:40,883
in broad daylight

115
00:06:40,918 --> 00:06:44,003
and during the funeral
procession, too.

116
00:06:44,038 --> 00:06:47,140
Somebody ought to take
a horsewhip to that...

117
00:06:47,175 --> 00:06:49,008
that...

118
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:10,663
my father
wishes me

119
00:07:10,698 --> 00:07:12,165
to tell you
that...

120
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,033
my father
wishes for me

121
00:07:14,068 --> 00:07:15,284
to tell you

122
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:17,170
that his heart
is broken.

123
00:07:17,205 --> 00:07:19,672
That if
he could...

124
00:07:19,707 --> 00:07:20,923
if he could
give...

125
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:24,677
his own life in return.

126
00:07:24,712 --> 00:07:29,298
His own life in
return, estrelita.

127
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:32,435
His own life in
return, he would.

128
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:36,189
He would do so with
great willingness.

129
00:07:36,224 --> 00:07:38,057
He... he
understands...

130
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:40,693
get out of the way,
little girl.

131
00:07:40,728 --> 00:07:41,944
Get out of the way.

132
00:07:43,446 --> 00:07:45,448
Can't
you see...

133
00:07:45,483 --> 00:07:46,699
can't you see

134
00:07:46,734 --> 00:07:49,819
that we're burying
our daughter today?

135
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:21,984
Oh, please, please.

136
00:08:22,019 --> 00:08:24,487
My son did not mean
to do it.

137
00:08:24,522 --> 00:08:26,989
He... he's a lover of children

138
00:08:27,024 --> 00:08:28,241
as you
all are.

139
00:08:28,276 --> 00:08:31,994
He's a lover of children.

140
00:08:32,029 --> 00:08:32,612
Hey, ozzie!

141
00:08:32,647 --> 00:08:33,863
Vayase a la casa.

142
00:08:33,898 --> 00:08:35,748
No se le necesita aqui.

143
00:08:37,867 --> 00:08:39,118
He's not
needed here.

144
00:08:39,153 --> 00:08:42,255
Is that what you say
to your old father?

145
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:44,123
Father, take
estrelita home.

146
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:45,875
They will hurt you.

147
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,126
Please, go home now.

148
00:08:47,161 --> 00:08:50,012
Vayase a la casa,
por favor.

149
00:08:52,515 --> 00:08:55,384
Luis... luis.

150
00:08:55,419 --> 00:08:56,636
My lucky coin.

151
00:08:56,671 --> 00:09:00,022
It is said one can
make a wish on it.

152
00:09:00,057 --> 00:09:02,275
Go home,
old man.

153
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:04,527
Make your prayers
and make your wishes.

154
00:09:04,562 --> 00:09:05,778
Luis is right.

155
00:09:05,813 --> 00:09:08,648
You'll do
no good here.

156
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:13,653
You never been drunk,
mr. Sheriff?

157
00:09:13,688 --> 00:09:20,042
You never felt such
misery rising in you

158
00:09:20,077 --> 00:09:22,912
that salvation seemed
to look at you

159
00:09:22,947 --> 00:09:24,797
from only out of a bottle?

160
00:09:26,048 --> 00:09:29,802
You never felt pain?

161
00:09:29,837 --> 00:09:34,173
Such pain that you had to ride
through the night

162
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:36,058
and not look behind you?

163
00:09:36,093 --> 00:09:40,813
My son was hungry
and he felt such pain

164
00:09:40,848 --> 00:09:43,683
and he drank too much.

165
00:09:43,718 --> 00:09:46,185
He rode
down the street

166
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:49,322
not looking,
not seeing.

167
00:09:50,439 --> 00:09:52,942
And he had a sadness...

168
00:09:54,827 --> 00:09:57,330
deep inside.

169
00:09:57,365 --> 00:10:02,335
Sadness that there was not
enough to eat

170
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:05,454
sadness that he had no work

171
00:10:05,489 --> 00:10:09,208
sadness the earth
all around him

172
00:10:09,243 --> 00:10:12,962
was growing barren in the sun.

173
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:17,350
He did not see the little girl.

174
00:10:18,601 --> 00:10:22,355
He never saw her...
for an instant.

175
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:37,987
Psst, little girl.

176
00:10:38,022 --> 00:10:39,238
Wait.

177
00:10:41,123 --> 00:10:42,375
Now, you stay here.

178
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:44,243
I won't hurt you.

179
00:10:44,278 --> 00:10:45,494
Don't be afraid.

180
00:10:45,529 --> 00:10:48,631
You go tell your papa-
you understand?

181
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:51,133
Tell your papa
i want to help him.

182
00:10:51,168 --> 00:10:54,887
You tell him that
his coin is no good-

183
00:10:54,922 --> 00:10:56,138
it's worthless-

184
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:59,258
but that i have
a magic dust

185
00:10:59,293 --> 00:11:01,761
that turns hate
into love

186
00:11:01,796 --> 00:11:04,397
but it is very,
very precious

187
00:11:04,432 --> 00:11:07,516
very expensive,
comprende?

188
00:11:07,551 --> 00:11:08,768
Understand?

189
00:11:08,803 --> 00:11:09,402
Now...

190
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:11,771
now, you tell
your papa

191
00:11:11,806 --> 00:11:15,524
to bring 100 pesos
to my room

192
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:16,158
in one hour

193
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:19,912
and i will sell him
the magic dust

194
00:11:20,529 --> 00:11:24,283
that makes people
love and forgive.

195
00:11:24,318 --> 00:11:25,534
You understand, eh?

196
00:11:25,569 --> 00:11:27,420
Tell your papa,
comprende?

197
00:11:27,455 --> 00:11:28,671
Good, now you go.

198
00:11:33,676 --> 00:11:35,544
Magic dust.

199
00:11:58,067 --> 00:12:03,072
100 pesos of worth
of magic dust.

200
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:27,680
It should be
a good attendance today.

201
00:12:27,715 --> 00:12:30,816
When was it
god made people?

202
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:33,319
Was it the sixth day?

203
00:12:33,354 --> 00:12:36,439
He should have stopped
on the fifth.

204
00:12:36,474 --> 00:12:40,826
They're tired of hating
this place.

205
00:12:40,861 --> 00:12:43,329
The sun...

206
00:12:43,364 --> 00:12:46,449
the ground that is dead
under your feet.

207
00:12:46,484 --> 00:12:51,454
They must go out and find
something else to hate.

208
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:58,344
This isn't
a carnival, rogers.

209
00:12:58,379 --> 00:12:59,462
It's a hanging.

210
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:01,964
You mean the kids?

211
00:13:01,999 --> 00:13:03,849
They ain't never
seen a hanging.

212
00:13:03,884 --> 00:13:05,718
I figured it was time.

213
00:13:05,753 --> 00:13:06,969
Why?

214
00:13:07,004 --> 00:13:08,220
Why not?

215
00:13:08,255 --> 00:13:09,605
They'll learn
a lesson.

216
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,107
They'll see what happens
to drunks that kill kids.

217
00:13:13,976 --> 00:13:15,861
I guess that's pretty vital.

218
00:13:15,896 --> 00:13:18,364
How do you teach them
pain, rogers?

219
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,484
Shoot one of them
in the arm?

220
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:23,986
All right, you kids.

221
00:13:25,621 --> 00:13:28,123
Get down and stay together.

222
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:37,750
Is that the man they're going
to put the rope on?

223
00:13:39,502 --> 00:13:40,753
Si, little one.

224
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:42,004
I am the man.

225
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:44,507
Will it hurt?

226
00:13:47,009 --> 00:13:48,894
If god wills it.

227
00:13:50,145 --> 00:13:52,014
Go on, boy.

228
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:57,653
Get ready, luis.

229
00:13:57,688 --> 00:13:59,522
It's about that time.

230
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:02,658
I'm ready, sheriff.

231
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,823
Come on, let's
get it over with.

232
00:14:50,858 --> 00:14:52,708
Yeah, you should've done that
in the jail.

233
00:14:52,743 --> 00:14:53,959
Hang him!

234
00:14:53,994 --> 00:14:57,079
What are we waiting for?
Let's get to it.

235
00:14:57,114 --> 00:15:00,215
Come on, sheriff,
do your duty.

236
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,084
Get it over with.

237
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:33,365
The little girl
told you?

238
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,617
Yes, she told me.

239
00:15:34,652 --> 00:15:36,502
She said that
you had the dust.

240
00:15:36,537 --> 00:15:38,370
Dust with magic
properties.

241
00:15:38,405 --> 00:15:39,622
That's the idea.

242
00:15:39,657 --> 00:15:40,873
Little of this

243
00:15:40,908 --> 00:15:42,758
sprinkled over the
heads in the crowd

244
00:15:42,793 --> 00:15:45,878
will make them feel
sympathy for your son.

245
00:15:45,913 --> 00:15:46,512
It's very rare.

246
00:15:46,547 --> 00:15:47,763
Magic, you know.

247
00:15:47,798 --> 00:15:49,632
You brought money
with you?

248
00:15:50,265 --> 00:15:50,883
Yes.

249
00:15:52,134 --> 00:15:53,385
Gold pieces?

250
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,270
Where did you
get them?

251
00:15:55,305 --> 00:15:55,888
All my friends.

252
00:15:55,923 --> 00:15:58,641
All my friends went
into the city.

253
00:15:58,676 --> 00:16:01,777
One sold a wagon,
another sold a horse

254
00:16:01,812 --> 00:16:03,646
some borrowed.

255
00:16:03,681 --> 00:16:07,399
We got many pesos
and we converted them.

256
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:10,402
It will work,
mr. Sykes?

257
00:16:10,437 --> 00:16:13,539
The magic dust,
it will work?

258
00:16:13,574 --> 00:16:14,790
Yes.

259
00:16:14,825 --> 00:16:17,292
You sold the rope
to hang my son.

260
00:16:17,327 --> 00:16:20,412
Now you sell me that
which will save him?

261
00:16:20,447 --> 00:16:23,549
Well, i'm a businessman, mr. Gallegos.

262
00:16:23,584 --> 00:16:25,417
I sell that
which is needed.

263
00:16:25,452 --> 00:16:27,302
I make no
distinctions.

264
00:16:27,337 --> 00:16:28,554
This will work.

265
00:16:28,589 --> 00:16:31,674
I told you,
it's magic.

266
00:16:39,815 --> 00:16:43,435
Luis!

267
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:45,320
I'm coming, my son.

268
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:47,189
I'm coming!

269
00:16:47,224 --> 00:16:49,692
Just throw some in the air
over their heads

270
00:16:49,727 --> 00:16:51,577
and then watch the magic.

271
00:16:51,612 --> 00:16:52,828
Yeah, that's right.

272
00:16:52,863 --> 00:16:54,079
Then watch the magic.

273
00:17:01,837 --> 00:17:02,838
String him up.

274
00:17:02,873 --> 00:17:04,089
We waited
long enough.

275
00:17:04,124 --> 00:17:05,591
Let's not
stall it.

276
00:17:05,626 --> 00:17:07,459
Get it
over with.

277
00:17:07,494 --> 00:17:09,461
What are we
waiting for?

278
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:11,964
Hurry it up,
sheriff.

279
00:17:13,849 --> 00:17:15,100
Wait!

280
00:17:16,351 --> 00:17:17,603
Wait! Wait!

281
00:17:17,638 --> 00:17:20,105
You must pay heed
to the magic now.

282
00:17:20,723 --> 00:17:24,476
You must stop all of this
and pay heed to the magic.

283
00:17:24,511 --> 00:17:25,110
Magic.

284
00:17:25,145 --> 00:17:26,361
Magic!

285
00:17:26,396 --> 00:17:28,864
You must pay heed
to the magic.

286
00:17:28,899 --> 00:17:30,115
All of you!

287
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,366
Magic...

288
00:17:31,401 --> 00:17:32,618
magic... for love.

289
00:17:33,904 --> 00:17:35,120
For compassion.

290
00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:38,874
Magically so,
that my son can live.

291
00:17:38,909 --> 00:17:41,994
As you yourselves...
you once used to live.

292
00:17:42,029 --> 00:17:44,496
Magic... magic.

293
00:17:44,531 --> 00:17:47,633
You... you must pay heed
to the... to the magic.

294
00:17:47,668 --> 00:17:49,384
It's only
for love.

295
00:17:49,419 --> 00:17:51,253
The magic is
for love.

296
00:17:51,288 --> 00:17:54,389
The magic is
for the love.

297
00:17:54,424 --> 00:17:55,641
Magic...

298
00:17:55,891 --> 00:17:57,142
magic.

299
00:17:57,177 --> 00:18:00,262
You must pay heed to the magic.

300
00:18:00,297 --> 00:18:01,013
Magic...

301
00:18:01,048 --> 00:18:02,898
it is for love.

302
00:18:02,933 --> 00:18:04,149
It is
for love.

303
00:18:04,184 --> 00:18:07,903
The magic... is for love.

304
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:12,658
No!

305
00:18:12,693 --> 00:18:15,778
No...

306
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:43,555
but it was a new rope.

307
00:18:44,807 --> 00:18:46,692
Five-strand
hemp.

308
00:18:47,943 --> 00:18:50,445
Nobody could have broken it.

309
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,948
It couldn't have gotten broken.

310
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:59,204
What about it, mr. Canfield,
mrs. Canfield?

311
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:01,073
Oh, please,
please.

312
00:19:01,108 --> 00:19:03,208
It's the magic.

313
00:19:03,243 --> 00:19:07,579
You cannot try
to defeat the magic.

314
00:19:07,614 --> 00:19:09,081
Let's try
it again.

315
00:19:09,116 --> 00:19:10,966
There are only two people here

316
00:19:11,001 --> 00:19:14,086
who have the right
to ask for an eye for an eye.

317
00:19:15,337 --> 00:19:17,222
What about it, mrs. Canfield?

318
00:19:30,853 --> 00:19:32,738
No more today,
john.

319
00:19:32,773 --> 00:19:33,989
No more.

320
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:39,611
He killed our child.

321
00:19:39,646 --> 00:19:42,748
And part of himself
while doing it.

322
00:19:42,783 --> 00:19:44,616
And he's suffered
enough.

323
00:19:56,511 --> 00:20:00,883
Sheriff koch,
there must be...

324
00:20:00,918 --> 00:20:03,385
there must be another
hand in all of this

325
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:06,889
for the rope
to break like that.

326
00:20:06,924 --> 00:20:09,391
Another hand.

327
00:20:10,025 --> 00:20:11,276
Maybe...

328
00:20:11,311 --> 00:20:14,279
maybe the hand
of providence.

329
00:20:16,031 --> 00:20:18,533
You want to stop it
then, mr. Canfield?

330
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:36,802
John?

331
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,923
We leave it
like this?

332
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:43,425
We leave it like this.

333
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,310
One victim is enough.

334
00:20:48,931 --> 00:20:52,067
I think we should
all go home now.

335
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,852
I...

336
00:21:26,887 --> 00:21:28,103
i'm free.

337
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:31,857
Are any of us
free, luis?

338
00:21:31,892 --> 00:21:34,359
Well, you can
go home now.

339
00:21:34,394 --> 00:21:36,862
You have
that much freedom.

340
00:21:36,897 --> 00:21:39,364
Luis,
it was magic.

341
00:21:39,399 --> 00:21:41,867
It was...
magic dust.

342
00:21:41,902 --> 00:21:46,872
It brought back love
to the people.

343
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,877
Yes, father, it was magic.

344
00:21:51,912 --> 00:21:54,379
It's time to go home now.

345
00:21:54,414 --> 00:21:56,248
Please, let's go home now.

346
00:22:34,536 --> 00:22:37,672
New rope.

347
00:22:37,707 --> 00:22:40,175
Brand-new rope.

348
00:23:03,815 --> 00:23:06,318
Go ahead. Take 'em.

349
00:23:06,353 --> 00:23:07,569
They're yours.

350
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,582
Why?

351
00:23:20,617 --> 00:23:23,085
Don't understand.

352
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,336
Why?

353
00:23:26,221 --> 00:23:28,723
It must be magic.

354
00:23:31,226 --> 00:23:33,728
That's what she is, magic.

355
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:42,487
It was a very small,
misery-laden village

356
00:23:42,522 --> 00:23:44,356
on the day of a hanging

357
00:23:44,391 --> 00:23:47,492
and of little
historical consequence

358
00:23:47,527 --> 00:23:49,995
and if there's
any moral to it at all

359
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:53,115
let's say that
in any quest for magic

360
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:56,868
in any search for sorcery,
witchery, legerdemain

361
00:23:56,903 --> 00:23:59,371
first check the human heart.

362
00:23:59,406 --> 00:24:02,507
For inside this deep place
there's a wizardry

363
00:24:02,542 --> 00:24:05,627
that costs far more
than a few pieces of gold.

364
00:24:05,662 --> 00:24:08,763
Tonight's case in point
in the twilight zone.

365
00:24:14,636 --> 00:24:17,139
Rod serling, the creator
oftwilight zone

366
00:24:17,174 --> 00:24:19,024
will tell you
about next week's story

367
00:24:19,059 --> 00:24:21,526
after this word
from our alternate sponsor.

368
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:24,146
And now, mr. Serling.

369
00:24:24,181 --> 00:24:27,282
In this rather posh club,
you'll see a group of men

370
00:24:27,317 --> 00:24:30,402
argue a somewhat metaphysical
subject like time travel.

371
00:24:30,437 --> 00:24:32,904
One of them maintains it's
possible to go back in time

372
00:24:32,939 --> 00:24:35,407
make a few changes in history,
and, as a result

373
00:24:35,442 --> 00:24:37,292
do quite a job on the present

374
00:24:37,327 --> 00:24:39,794
in this case the assassination
of one abraham lincoln.

375
00:24:39,829 --> 00:24:42,297
Next week, a story called
"back there."

376
00:24:42,332 --> 00:24:43,548
I'd like you all
to come with us.

377
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:46,051
I think you'll find it
a most exciting journey.

378
00:24:46,086 --> 00:24:47,302
Thank you and good night.
