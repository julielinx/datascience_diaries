1
00:00:09,511 --> 00:00:11,978
You're traveling
through another dimension

2
00:00:12,013 --> 00:00:15,098
a dimension not only
of sight and sound, but of mind

3
00:00:15,133 --> 00:00:16,349
a journey into a wondrous land

4
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:18,852
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

5
00:00:18,887 --> 00:00:20,103
That's the signpost up ahead.

6
00:00:20,138 --> 00:00:23,239
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

7
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:32,615
Wordsworth. Romney.
Obsolescence.

8
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:34,501
He's waiting, chancellor.

9
00:00:34,536 --> 00:00:37,003
Order him in.

10
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,123
Wordsworth.

11
00:00:40,158 --> 00:00:42,625
Romney.

12
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,128
Obsolescence.

13
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,266
You walk into this room
at your own risk

14
00:00:50,301 --> 00:00:52,769
because it leads to the future,

15
00:00:52,804 --> 00:00:55,889
not a future that will be,
but one that might be.

16
00:00:55,924 --> 00:00:58,391
This is not a new world.

17
00:00:58,426 --> 00:01:01,528
It is simply an extension
of what began in the old one.

18
00:01:01,563 --> 00:01:04,647
It has patterned itself
after every dictator

19
00:01:04,682 --> 00:01:07,784
who has ever planted
the ripping imprint of a boot

20
00:01:07,819 --> 00:01:10,904
on the pages of history
since the beginning of time.

21
00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:14,040
It has refinements,
technological advances

22
00:01:14,075 --> 00:01:15,909
and a more
sophisticated approach

23
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:18,411
to the destruction
of human freedom,

24
00:01:18,446 --> 00:01:22,165
but like every one of the
superstates that preceded it,

25
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,667
it has one iron rule:

26
00:01:24,702 --> 00:01:28,421
Logic is an enemy,
and truth is a menace.

27
00:01:32,308 --> 00:01:37,931
This is mr. Romney wordsworth
in his last 48 hours on earth.

28
00:01:37,966 --> 00:01:39,816
He's a citizen of the state

29
00:01:39,851 --> 00:01:42,318
but will soon
have to be eliminated

30
00:01:42,353 --> 00:01:46,823
because he's built out of flesh
and because he has a mind.

31
00:01:46,858 --> 00:01:50,577
Mr. Romney wordsworth,
who will draw his last breaths

32
00:01:50,612 --> 00:01:53,079
in the twilight zone.

33
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:03,456
Wordsworth, romney-

34
00:02:03,491 --> 00:02:05,959
field investigation
obsolescence.

35
00:02:05,994 --> 00:02:08,461
Do you know why you're
here, mr. Wordsworth?

36
00:02:08,496 --> 00:02:09,712
Yes, sir.

37
00:02:09,747 --> 00:02:11,598
I'd ask you to speak up
a little, if you will.

38
00:02:11,633 --> 00:02:13,466
Yes, sir,
i know why i'm here.

39
00:02:13,501 --> 00:02:15,351
You've been under
investigation, mr. Wordsworth,

40
00:02:15,386 --> 00:02:17,854
for the mandatory period
of one year and 11 months.

41
00:02:17,889 --> 00:02:19,722
You're found
to be obsolete.

42
00:02:19,757 --> 00:02:21,474
The purpose of this hearing
is to make a finding

43
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:23,359
in the matter
and make a sentence accordingly.

44
00:02:23,394 --> 00:02:24,611
Do you understand that?

45
00:02:24,646 --> 00:02:25,862
I understand that.

46
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,364
Your occupation, mr. Wordsworth?

47
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:32,735
A librarian, sir.

48
00:02:35,872 --> 00:02:37,123
A what?

49
00:02:37,158 --> 00:02:39,626
A librarian, sir.

50
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:42,745
Has this man had counsel? Yes, sir, he has.

51
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,631
Are you sure he knows his
rights? He's been given

52
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:45,882
orientation, sir.

53
00:02:45,917 --> 00:02:49,636
Mr. Wordsworth, i'm told
that you've had coun...

54
00:02:49,671 --> 00:02:50,253
stand back

55
00:02:50,288 --> 00:02:52,755
in the light,
mr. Wordsworth!

56
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:54,641
I'm told you've
had counsel

57
00:02:54,676 --> 00:02:57,760
and been given orientation, mr. Wordsworth,

58
00:02:57,795 --> 00:03:00,263
but i'm still not
sure in my own mind

59
00:03:00,298 --> 00:03:03,399
that you understand the
purpose of this hearing.

60
00:03:03,434 --> 00:03:05,268
The field investigators
in your sector

61
00:03:05,303 --> 00:03:07,770
have classified you as obsolete.

62
00:03:07,805 --> 00:03:10,907
This finding carries with it
serious implications.

63
00:03:10,942 --> 00:03:14,027
Do you understand
that, mr. Wordsworth?

64
00:03:14,062 --> 00:03:17,780
Now i'll ask you
again your occupation.

65
00:03:17,815 --> 00:03:19,666
Iama librarian, sir.

66
00:03:19,701 --> 00:03:22,168
Thatismy occupation.
That is my profession.

67
00:03:22,203 --> 00:03:24,037
If you people choose
to call that "obsolete"...

68
00:03:24,072 --> 00:03:26,539
request clarification
of the term...

69
00:03:26,574 --> 00:03:29,676
yes, the term, mr.
Wordsworth, "you people"-

70
00:03:29,711 --> 00:03:30,927
you make reference
to the state?

71
00:03:30,962 --> 00:03:32,795
I make reference
to the state.

72
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:34,047
And you persist
in declaring

73
00:03:34,082 --> 00:03:36,549
your occupation as
being a librarian.

74
00:03:36,584 --> 00:03:37,800
That is correct, sir.

75
00:03:37,835 --> 00:03:41,688
A librarian-

76
00:03:41,723 --> 00:03:44,807
having to do...

77
00:03:44,842 --> 00:03:47,310
with books.

78
00:03:47,345 --> 00:03:49,812
Yes, sir, books.

79
00:03:50,947 --> 00:03:54,701
But since there are
no more books, mr. Wordsworth,

80
00:03:54,736 --> 00:03:56,569
there are no more libraries.

81
00:03:57,203 --> 00:03:59,706
And, of course, it follows
that there is very little call

82
00:03:59,741 --> 00:04:02,208
for the services of a librarian.

83
00:04:02,243 --> 00:04:02,825
Case in point:

84
00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:04,077
A minister.

85
00:04:04,112 --> 00:04:05,328
A minister
would tell us

86
00:04:05,962 --> 00:04:06,579
that his function

87
00:04:06,614 --> 00:04:09,082
is that of preaching
the word of god.

88
00:04:09,117 --> 00:04:10,967
And, of course,
it follows

89
00:04:11,002 --> 00:04:12,835
that since the
state has proven

90
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,721
that there is no god,
that would make

91
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:16,589
the function
of a minister

92
00:04:16,624 --> 00:04:18,474
somewhat academic,
as well.

93
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:19,726
There is a god.

94
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:27,233
You are in error,
mr. Wordsworth.

95
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,736
There is no god!

96
00:04:30,987 --> 00:04:32,238
The state

97
00:04:32,273 --> 00:04:34,857
has proven that
there is no god!

98
00:04:34,892 --> 00:04:37,360
You cannot erase god
with an edict!

99
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:43,750
You are obsolete,
mr. Wordsworth.

100
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,619
A lie.
No man is obsolete.

101
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,005
You have no function,
mr. Wordsworth.

102
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,125
You're an anachronism,
like a ghost from another time.

103
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,010
I am nothing more
than a reminder to you

104
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:57,130
that you cannot destroy truth
by burning pages.

105
00:04:57,165 --> 00:05:00,266
You're a bug, mr. Wordsworth,
a crawling insect;

106
00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:02,769
an ugly, misformed
little creature

107
00:05:02,804 --> 00:05:04,020
who has no purpose here,

108
00:05:04,055 --> 00:05:05,271
no meaning.

109
00:05:05,306 --> 00:05:06,522
I am a human being.

110
00:05:06,557 --> 00:05:09,642
You're a librarian,
mr. Wordsworth.

111
00:05:09,677 --> 00:05:11,027
You're a dealer
in books

112
00:05:11,062 --> 00:05:13,529
and two-cent fines and
pamphlets and closed stacks

113
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,398
and the musty insides of a language factory

114
00:05:16,032 --> 00:05:17,900
that spews out
meaningless words

115
00:05:17,935 --> 00:05:19,152
on an assembly
line-

116
00:05:19,187 --> 00:05:21,654
words, mr. Wordsworth,

117
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:24,791
that have no substance
and no dimension.

118
00:05:24,826 --> 00:05:26,659
Like air, like the wind,

119
00:05:26,694 --> 00:05:29,796
like a vacuum that you
make believe has an existence

120
00:05:29,831 --> 00:05:32,298
by scribbling index numbers
on little cards.

121
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:33,549
I don't care.

122
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:34,801
I tell you
i don't care.

123
00:05:34,836 --> 00:05:37,303
I'm a human being.
I exist!

124
00:05:37,338 --> 00:05:39,806
And if i speak
one thought aloud,

125
00:05:39,841 --> 00:05:41,057
that thought lives,

126
00:05:41,092 --> 00:05:44,177
even after
i'm shoveled into my grave!

127
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,562
Delusions, mr. Wordsworth,

128
00:05:46,597 --> 00:05:51,567
delusions that you inject into
your veins with printer's ink;

129
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:54,687
the narcotics
that you call literature-

130
00:05:54,722 --> 00:06:00,326
the bible, poetry, essays-
all kind, all of it an opiate

131
00:06:00,361 --> 00:06:02,695
to make you think
you have a strength

132
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:05,198
when you have
no strength at all.

133
00:06:05,233 --> 00:06:08,334
You have nothing but
spindly limbs and a dream

134
00:06:08,369 --> 00:06:10,837
and the state has
no use for your kind!

135
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:18,344
You waste our time,
mr. Wordsworth,

136
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:20,213
and you're not worth the waste.

137
00:06:20,248 --> 00:06:22,098
Instruct him.

138
00:06:22,133 --> 00:06:23,966
Romney wordsworth,
step back

139
00:06:24,001 --> 00:06:26,469
to await the finding
of this board.

140
00:06:26,504 --> 00:06:28,471
Yes, sir.

141
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:39,232
How do you find,
ladies and gentlemen?

142
00:06:39,267 --> 00:06:44,120
Obsolete.

143
00:06:44,155 --> 00:06:46,622
I concur.

144
00:06:46,657 --> 00:06:49,125
Romney wordsworth,
step forward.

145
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:55,631
The board finds
you obsolete.

146
00:06:56,883 --> 00:07:00,253
Your rights are as follows,
mr. Wordsworth:

147
00:07:00,288 --> 00:07:04,640
You are to be liquidated
within a period of 48 hours,

148
00:07:04,675 --> 00:07:09,011
but you have an option
as to method and precise time.

149
00:07:09,046 --> 00:07:11,647
There are several
prescribed methods,

150
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:16,018
pills, gas, electrocution-

151
00:07:16,053 --> 00:07:19,772
and it can be done immediately,
or an hour from now

152
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,023
or any specific time

153
00:07:21,157 --> 00:07:23,025
that you
request.

154
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:30,533
I am a very rich man.

155
00:07:30,568 --> 00:07:31,417
Louder.

156
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:35,788
I merely said
that i was a very rich man.

157
00:07:35,823 --> 00:07:38,925
I have such
a luxury of choices

158
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,793
that i choose
the following:

159
00:07:40,828 --> 00:07:42,678
To be given an assassin

160
00:07:42,713 --> 00:07:47,049
to whom i shall tell
the method of my execution.

161
00:07:47,084 --> 00:07:49,552
This is unheard-of.

162
00:07:49,587 --> 00:07:52,054
Mr. Wordsworth,
we don't understand

163
00:07:52,089 --> 00:07:54,557
the nature of
the request.

164
00:07:54,592 --> 00:07:57,693
Simply that you are
to assign me my assassin,

165
00:07:57,728 --> 00:08:01,447
but only he and i will know
the way that i'm to die.

166
00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:03,950
That will be acceptable,
mr. Wordsworth,

167
00:08:03,985 --> 00:08:05,818
provided your liquidation
is accomplished

168
00:08:05,853 --> 00:08:08,321
within the
48-hour period.

169
00:08:08,356 --> 00:08:11,457
Just one final request.

170
00:08:11,492 --> 00:08:15,828
I should like to die
with an audience.

171
00:08:15,863 --> 00:08:22,969
Ah, mr. Wordsworth,
that can be arranged, indeed.

172
00:08:23,004 --> 00:08:26,722
It's not unusual
that we televise executions.

173
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:29,225
It has an educative
effect on the population.

174
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,093
I have no doubt.

175
00:08:31,128 --> 00:08:36,098
Now, as to the time of the
liquidation, mr. Wordsworth...

176
00:08:36,133 --> 00:08:37,984
midnight,
tomorrow.

177
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:39,235
And the place?

178
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:41,103
In my room.

179
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:45,741
Agreed, mr. Wordsworth.

180
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:50,112
We will choose your liquidator
and send him over to you.

181
00:08:50,147 --> 00:08:53,249
He will be duty bound,
just as you prescribed,

182
00:08:53,284 --> 00:08:57,003
not to divulge the method
you've decided upon.

183
00:08:57,038 --> 00:08:59,505
That will be all,
mr. Wordsworth.

184
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,008
You may leave
and return to your room.

185
00:09:11,767 --> 00:09:15,521
An odd one,
and with very bizarre requests.

186
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:18,641
Bizarre, yes, but
to our advantage.

187
00:09:18,676 --> 00:09:22,144
We'll show the people
how this obsolete man,

188
00:09:22,179 --> 00:09:25,281
this librarian, dies.

189
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,898
Come in, chancellor.

190
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,269
Thank you for coming.

191
00:10:03,304 --> 00:10:05,771
Very irregular,
mr. Wordsworth.

192
00:10:05,806 --> 00:10:07,657
Do you know
why i've come?

193
00:10:07,692 --> 00:10:09,525
Do you?

194
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,776
Well, i invited you.

195
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:12,662
By all means,
you invited me,

196
00:10:12,697 --> 00:10:15,164
but why would i honor such an invitation?

197
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:17,033
A cryptic note
from a condemned man

198
00:10:17,667 --> 00:10:18,918
asking me
to visit him

199
00:10:18,953 --> 00:10:20,786
in the last hours
of his life.

200
00:10:20,821 --> 00:10:22,038
Hardly the norm,
mr. Wordsworth,

201
00:10:22,672 --> 00:10:26,425
hardly what i'm
accustomed to...

202
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,928
and somewhat
suspect, too.

203
00:10:30,179 --> 00:10:32,048
How do i know
i wasn't invited here

204
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:35,184
for that last pitiful
gesture of vengeance

205
00:10:35,219 --> 00:10:35,801
on the part
of the condemned?

206
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:37,053
Vengeance?

207
00:10:37,088 --> 00:10:39,555
Yes, i'm somewhat
responsible

208
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:42,058
for the finding
in your case.

209
00:10:42,093 --> 00:10:45,811
Your demise
in less than an hour

210
00:10:45,846 --> 00:10:49,565
can be attributed at least
in part to my decision.

211
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,953
I'll tell you
why i came, mr. Wordsworth-

212
00:10:53,988 --> 00:10:55,821
perhaps to prove
something to you.

213
00:10:55,856 --> 00:10:57,073
And that is?

214
00:10:57,108 --> 00:10:57,707
To prove to you

215
00:10:57,742 --> 00:11:01,460
that the state
has no fears, none at all.

216
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:03,963
No, you will forgive
me, chancellor.

217
00:11:03,998 --> 00:11:05,831
That has all the
elements of a joke.

218
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:08,334
I mean, you come to my room
to prove that the state

219
00:11:08,369 --> 00:11:10,219
isn't afraid of me?

220
00:11:10,254 --> 00:11:12,722
Oh, what an incredible
burden i must be,

221
00:11:12,757 --> 00:11:15,091
to have to prove
that the state isn't afraid

222
00:11:15,126 --> 00:11:18,227
of an obsolete librarian
like myself.

223
00:11:18,262 --> 00:11:20,096
No, i'll tell you
the reason you came.

224
00:11:20,131 --> 00:11:21,347
I'll tell you the reason,

225
00:11:21,382 --> 00:11:23,232
though you won't admit it
to yourself.

226
00:11:23,267 --> 00:11:26,986
What might that be?

227
00:11:27,021 --> 00:11:28,854
I don't fit your formulae.

228
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:30,106
Somewhere along the line,

229
00:11:30,141 --> 00:11:33,242
there's been a deviation
from the norm.

230
00:11:33,277 --> 00:11:36,996
Your state has everything
categorized, indexed, tagged.

231
00:11:37,031 --> 00:11:38,247
You are the strength.

232
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,750
People like me are the weakness.

233
00:11:40,785 --> 00:11:43,252
You control and order
and dictate,

234
00:11:43,287 --> 00:11:46,756
and my kind merely
follow and obey.

235
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:48,007
But something's
gone wrong, hasn't it?

236
00:11:48,042 --> 00:11:49,258
I don't fit, do i?

237
00:11:49,293 --> 00:11:51,761
Oh, yes, you fit,
mr. Wordsworth.

238
00:11:51,796 --> 00:11:54,013
In a few moments, you'll
be cringing and pleading

239
00:11:54,048 --> 00:11:55,264
just like they all do.

240
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:57,133
Oh, yes, indeed, you fit.

241
00:11:57,168 --> 00:11:59,018
You've got a worthless,
miserable little life,

242
00:11:59,053 --> 00:12:00,886
but you've got
an instinct for survival,

243
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,023
and in a few minutes, when you
feel life slipping away,

244
00:12:04,058 --> 00:12:07,143
when you feel your survival
is just a question of minutes,

245
00:12:07,178 --> 00:12:09,028
we'll see then
which is the stronger-

246
00:12:09,063 --> 00:12:10,279
the state

247
00:12:10,314 --> 00:12:12,148
or the
librarian.

248
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:16,285
I take it
you've had a talk

249
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,154
with whoever is assigned
to your liquidation.

250
00:12:18,189 --> 00:12:20,656
Yes, i have, indeed.

251
00:12:20,691 --> 00:12:22,541
Midnight, isn't it?

252
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:24,410
Yes, in about 40 minutes.

253
00:12:24,445 --> 00:12:25,661
See, they brought

254
00:12:25,696 --> 00:12:28,547
this equipment here
early this afternoon.

255
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:31,801
These two men put that up
in less than 15 minutes.

256
00:12:31,836 --> 00:12:34,920
It's remote control.
Very efficient.

257
00:12:37,807 --> 00:12:39,925
Well, we're being
televised now.

258
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:43,062
It's not unusual
that we televise executions.

259
00:12:43,097 --> 00:12:45,564
Last year,
in the mass executions,

260
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:47,433
we televised around the clock.

261
00:12:47,468 --> 00:12:51,187
1,300 people were put to death
in less than six hours.

262
00:12:51,222 --> 00:12:53,072
You never learn, do you?

263
00:12:53,107 --> 00:12:54,323
History teaches you nothing.

264
00:12:54,358 --> 00:12:55,574
On the contrary,

265
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:57,443
history teaches
us a great deal.

266
00:12:57,478 --> 00:13:01,697
We had predecessors
who had the right idea.

267
00:13:01,732 --> 00:13:02,331
Yes, hitler.

268
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:03,582
Hitler, of course.

269
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:04,834
Stalin.
Stalin, too-

270
00:13:04,869 --> 00:13:06,702
but their error was
not one of excess.

271
00:13:07,336 --> 00:13:09,205
It was simply not
going far enough.

272
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,340
Too many undesirables
were left around,

273
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,843
and undesirables eventually
form a core of resistance.

274
00:13:13,878 --> 00:13:17,596
Old people clutch at the past
and won't accept the new.

275
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:19,465
The sick, the maimed,
the deformed,

276
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,350
they fasten
onto the healthy body

277
00:13:21,385 --> 00:13:24,470
and damage it,
so we eliminate them.

278
00:13:24,505 --> 00:13:26,355
And people
like yourself-

279
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:27,606
they can perform

280
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,109
no useful function
for the state

281
00:13:30,144 --> 00:13:31,977
so we put an
end to them.

282
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:34,480
What a charming room you
have, mr. Wordsworth.

283
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:36,365
Have you lived here long?

284
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,616
Over 20 years.

285
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:39,485
I built
that furniture myself.

286
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,370
Yes, so i understand,
mr. Wordsworth.

287
00:13:41,405 --> 00:13:43,873
That, incidentally,
has kept you alive,

288
00:13:43,908 --> 00:13:45,124
that particular talent.

289
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:46,992
Carpentry, you
see, is a skill,

290
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:49,495
and the state provides
considerable leeway

291
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:51,997
for people who possess
certain skills.

292
00:13:52,032 --> 00:13:55,134
Unfortunately, you went
as far as you could go,

293
00:13:55,169 --> 00:13:57,002
which was insufficient.

294
00:13:57,037 --> 00:14:00,139
So in a few moments,
it will be the end

295
00:14:00,174 --> 00:14:02,641
of a rather
fruitless life

296
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:04,510
and mr. Romney wordsworth,

297
00:14:04,545 --> 00:14:11,400
librarian, goes to
his own nirvana.

298
00:14:11,435 --> 00:14:13,903
That's what they call
it in your books,

299
00:14:13,938 --> 00:14:15,771
isn't it, mr. Wordsworth?

300
00:14:15,806 --> 00:14:18,908
You aren't facing the
camera, mr. Wordsworth.

301
00:14:18,943 --> 00:14:20,159
You're cheating
your audience.

302
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:22,027
They want to see
how you die.

303
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:23,279
Please, mr. Wordsworth,

304
00:14:23,314 --> 00:14:25,164
turn around,
face the camera.

305
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:26,415
That's right.

306
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:28,918
And don't stifle
your emotions.

307
00:14:28,953 --> 00:14:31,170
If you feel like crying,
go ahead and cry.

308
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:33,672
Or if you want to plead,
plead, by all means.

309
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:36,175
Some high state official
might take pity on you.

310
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:38,677
Yes, that would
please you, would it?

311
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:40,546
A little abject
hand-wringing,

312
00:14:40,581 --> 00:14:42,431
chest pounding, falling down
on my hands and knees.

313
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:44,934
Suit yourself,
mr. Wordsworth.

314
00:14:44,969 --> 00:14:46,185
Unfortunately, i don't have time

315
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,436
to be entertained by them
when they do come.

316
00:14:47,471 --> 00:14:50,556
I have another appointment
this evening.

317
00:14:52,441 --> 00:14:54,944
Chancellor...

318
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:58,564
make it brief, mr. Wordsworth.

319
00:14:58,599 --> 00:15:01,700
You have plenty of time.
You're not going anywhere.

320
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,569
How's that?

321
00:15:03,604 --> 00:15:06,705
I'm afraid i haven't been
very fair with you.

322
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,825
I invited you here
for a very special reason.

323
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,710
Would you like to know
the method that i've chosen

324
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:13,579
for my liquidation?

325
00:15:13,614 --> 00:15:14,830
Well, in a very few moments,

326
00:15:14,865 --> 00:15:19,835
here in this room,
a bomb is going off.

327
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,589
Very thoughtful,
mr. Wordsworth:

328
00:15:23,624 --> 00:15:26,725
Relatively quick
and painless death.

329
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,594
Yes, isn't it?

330
00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:29,845
However, knowing
that you're going to be

331
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,096
blown to smithereens

332
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:32,348
in a few moments

333
00:15:32,383 --> 00:15:36,101
isn't the happiest thought
in the world, is it? Is it?

334
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:39,238
That depends on the individual,
mr. Wordsworth.

335
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:40,489
Indeed it does.

336
00:15:45,494 --> 00:15:48,614
What kind of idiocy is this,
mr. Wordsworth?

337
00:15:48,649 --> 00:15:50,499
You've locked the door.

338
00:15:50,534 --> 00:15:52,117
Oh, yes, yes,
i've locked the door.

339
00:15:52,152 --> 00:15:54,620
Now, question:

340
00:15:54,655 --> 00:15:57,122
How does a man react
to the knowledge

341
00:15:57,157 --> 00:15:59,625
that he's going
to be blown to bits

342
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:02,628
within a half an hour?

343
00:16:02,663 --> 00:16:06,515
That depends
on the individual.

344
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,137
So for myself...

345
00:16:12,172 --> 00:16:15,891
i'm going to sit down

346
00:16:15,926 --> 00:16:18,777
and read my bible.

347
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:21,530
It's been hidden here
for over 20 years.

348
00:16:21,565 --> 00:16:23,399
It's a crime
punishable by death,

349
00:16:23,434 --> 00:16:26,535
so it's the only possession
that i have

350
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:28,404
that has any value
at all to me.

351
00:16:28,439 --> 00:16:33,409
So i'm going
to just sit down and read it

352
00:16:33,444 --> 00:16:36,545
until the moment
of my death.

353
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,414
How will you spend

354
00:16:38,449 --> 00:16:40,416
your last moments,
chancellor?

355
00:16:40,451 --> 00:16:42,301
This is insane, wordsworth.
Let me out of here.

356
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,308
Let me out of here, someone!

357
00:16:49,343 --> 00:16:51,176
Guards, someone, anyone!

358
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:52,428
You're cheating the audience.

359
00:16:52,463 --> 00:16:54,313
You're not facing the cameras.

360
00:16:57,566 --> 00:16:58,817
Guards, somebody
down there!

361
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:00,686
There is no sense
in wasting your breath.

362
00:17:00,721 --> 00:17:01,320
There's nobody there.

363
00:17:01,355 --> 00:17:03,188
That's one of the rules
you made up yourself:

364
00:17:03,223 --> 00:17:05,074
Isolate the persons
to be liquidated.

365
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:06,325
That's what you said.

366
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,193
Oh, no, no, no, no.

367
00:17:08,228 --> 00:17:10,079
I think that there's
no one there,

368
00:17:10,114 --> 00:17:11,330
so why don't you
face the camera?

369
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:13,198
It's very important.
You said so yourself.

370
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:14,450
I'm beginning to
understand, wordsworth.

371
00:17:14,485 --> 00:17:16,952
Shoe on the other
foot- that's the idea?

372
00:17:16,987 --> 00:17:18,837
It's one thing for you

373
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:20,089
to do a little
cringing, pleading,

374
00:17:20,124 --> 00:17:21,340
but what a choice
opportunity

375
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,842
to show a member of the
state doing likewise.

376
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:25,711
But you're insane
if you think

377
00:17:25,746 --> 00:17:27,096
they'll let me
stay here.

378
00:17:27,131 --> 00:17:29,598
"They"? I ask clarification
of the term "they."

379
00:17:29,633 --> 00:17:31,467
Ah, you mean the state!

380
00:17:31,502 --> 00:17:33,969
Oh, i think they'll sit
on their hands for awhile.

381
00:17:34,004 --> 00:17:36,472
They wouldn't want
to miss this scene.

382
00:17:36,507 --> 00:17:38,223
Besides,
the act of rescue

383
00:17:38,258 --> 00:17:40,109
would be very
demeaning to them;

384
00:17:40,144 --> 00:17:42,611
to have to break
in here and rescue

385
00:17:42,646 --> 00:17:45,114
a high-ranking member
of the state,

386
00:17:45,149 --> 00:17:47,733
to snatch him out of the soup,
so to speak.

387
00:17:47,768 --> 00:17:49,618
No, i think they won't help you.

388
00:17:49,653 --> 00:17:52,738
I misjudged you, wordsworth.

389
00:17:52,773 --> 00:17:53,872
You underestimated me.

390
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,741
You wanted the whole country

391
00:17:55,776 --> 00:17:58,243
to see the way
that a librarian dies.

392
00:17:58,278 --> 00:17:59,878
Well, let
the country see

393
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:02,381
the way an official
of the state dies, too.

394
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:04,883
Face the cameras,
step into the light.

395
00:18:06,135 --> 00:18:08,003
Let the whole
country see

396
00:18:08,038 --> 00:18:09,254
the strength
of the state,

397
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:11,140
the resilience
of the state,

398
00:18:11,175 --> 00:18:12,391
the courage
of the state.

399
00:18:12,426 --> 00:18:14,893
Let the whole country
see the way

400
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:17,396
a valiant man of steel
faces his death.

401
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:19,898
You have a nirvana
coming up, too.

402
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,150
Why don't you
sit down,

403
00:18:21,185 --> 00:18:23,652
we'll have
a little chat.

404
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:28,657
Just you and me...
and the great equalizer,

405
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:34,279
'cause death
is a great equalizer.

406
00:18:34,314 --> 00:18:36,165
So here you have...

407
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,918
you have this strong,
handsome, uniformed,

408
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:43,038
bemedaled symbol
of giant authority,

409
00:18:43,073 --> 00:18:46,792
and this insignificant
librarian,

410
00:18:46,827 --> 00:18:49,928
and suddenly,
in the eyes of god,

411
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:56,802
there is precious little
to distinguish us.

412
00:19:06,195 --> 00:19:11,200
We shall see, wordsworth,
we shall see.

413
00:19:17,206 --> 00:19:21,577
"The lord is my shepherd,
i shall not want.

414
00:19:21,612 --> 00:19:25,330
"He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

415
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:29,718
"He leadeth me
beside the still waters.

416
00:19:29,753 --> 00:19:31,587
"He restoreth my soul.

417
00:19:31,622 --> 00:19:34,840
"He leadeth me
in the paths of righteousness

418
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:37,342
"for his namesake.

419
00:19:37,377 --> 00:19:39,845
"Yea, though i walk
through the valley

420
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,981
"of the shadow
of death, i will fear

421
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:45,851
"no evil, for
thou art with me.

422
00:19:45,886 --> 00:19:49,238
"Thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me.

423
00:19:49,273 --> 00:19:51,740
"Thou preparest a table
before me

424
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:53,609
"in the presence
of mine enemies.

425
00:19:53,644 --> 00:19:56,745
"Thou anointest
my head with oil.

426
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,865
"My cup runneth over.

427
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,750
"Surely goodness
and mercy

428
00:20:01,785 --> 00:20:04,253
shall follow me
all the days of my life."

429
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:08,006
"Defend me from them
that rise up against me.

430
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,509
"Deliver me from
the workers of inequity

431
00:20:10,544 --> 00:20:13,629
"and save me
from the bloody men.

432
00:20:13,664 --> 00:20:16,765
"For, lo,
they lie in wait for my soul.

433
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,268
"The mighty
are gathered against me,

434
00:20:19,303 --> 00:20:21,136
"not for my transgression,

"not for my sins, o god.

00:20:24,308 --> 00:20:26,141
"They run

"without my fault.

438
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:31,146
"Awake to help me,
and behold.

439
00:20:31,181 --> 00:20:33,649
Then, therefore,
o lord, god of hosts..."

440
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:39,905
"the fool
hath said in his heart:

"'There is no god.'

"The lord looked down

i called unto thee, o, lord.

"Let thine ears

to the voice
of my supplications..."

please, please, let me out.

451
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:11,186
In the name of god, let me out!

452
00:21:11,221 --> 00:21:13,322
Let me out!
Let me out!

453
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,824
Yes, chancellor,
in the name of god,

454
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:17,943
i will let you out.

455
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,977
Stand where
you are.

456
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:53,228
No further.

457
00:21:53,263 --> 00:21:55,113
You have been removed
from office.

458
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:58,233
The field investigators
have declared you obsolete.

459
00:21:58,268 --> 00:22:00,118
Obsolete?

460
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:01,370
You have disgraced
the state.

461
00:22:01,405 --> 00:22:02,621
You have proven
yourself a coward.

462
00:22:02,656 --> 00:22:05,741
You have therefore
no function.

463
00:22:05,776 --> 00:22:08,493
You are obsolete!

464
00:22:08,528 --> 00:22:10,996
But i'm not.
I'm not obsolete.

465
00:22:11,031 --> 00:22:13,498
You are obsolete.

466
00:22:13,533 --> 00:22:14,883
Obsolete, obsolete.

467
00:22:14,918 --> 00:22:17,002
You are obsolete.

468
00:22:17,037 --> 00:22:18,253
Obsolete...

469
00:22:18,288 --> 00:22:21,390
you're making a terrible
mistake, a tragic mistake.

470
00:22:21,425 --> 00:22:23,258
I'm not obsolete.

471
00:22:23,293 --> 00:22:24,509
I've worked for the state.

472
00:22:24,544 --> 00:22:25,761
I've helped the state.

473
00:22:25,796 --> 00:22:27,012
I helped give
the state strength.

474
00:22:27,047 --> 00:22:29,514
How can you call me obsolete?

475
00:22:29,549 --> 00:22:32,651
How can you?!

476
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,656
Please, i'm not obsolete.

477
00:22:37,691 --> 00:22:40,158
I...

478
00:22:52,421 --> 00:22:56,174
please, i...
please, i'm not obsolete.

479
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:59,928
L-i have a function,
i have a purpose.

480
00:22:59,963 --> 00:23:02,431
Please, i...

481
00:23:02,466 --> 00:23:03,682
please.

482
00:23:03,717 --> 00:23:07,052
I want to serve
the state, please.

483
00:23:07,087 --> 00:23:09,304
Please, no, i'm...

484
00:23:09,339 --> 00:23:10,439
i'm not obsolete.

485
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,558
No, no, i... i...
please, please.

486
00:23:13,593 --> 00:23:14,810
I'm not
obsolete, no!

487
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:18,563
I want to serve the state.

488
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:21,700
Please, please!

489
00:23:21,735 --> 00:23:24,202
No!

490
00:23:24,237 --> 00:23:26,705
I want to serve the state.

491
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,966
Please, i'm... i'm not obsolete.

492
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:45,340
The chancellor-
the late chancellor-

493
00:23:45,375 --> 00:23:46,591
was only partly correct.

494
00:23:46,626 --> 00:23:47,843
He was obsolete,

495
00:23:47,878 --> 00:23:50,979
but so is the state,
the entity he worshipped.

496
00:23:51,014 --> 00:23:54,733
Any state, any entity, any
ideology that fails to recognize

497
00:23:54,768 --> 00:23:56,601
the worth, the dignity,
the rights of man-

498
00:23:56,636 --> 00:23:59,104
that state is obsolete.

499
00:23:59,139 --> 00:24:01,606
A case to be filed under "m"
for mankind

500
00:24:01,641 --> 00:24:04,109
in the twilight zone.

501
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:10,999
Rod serling,
creator ofthe twilight zone,

502
00:24:11,034 --> 00:24:13,502
will tell you
about next week's story

503
00:24:13,537 --> 00:24:16,004
after this word
from our alternate sponsor.

504
00:24:16,972 --> 00:24:18,540
And now, mr. Serling.

505
00:24:18,575 --> 00:24:21,042
I'm about to show you
a picture of something

506
00:24:21,077 --> 00:24:22,928
that isn't what it looks like.

507
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,799
Pleasant little town,
it isn't this at all-

508
00:24:27,834 --> 00:24:29,684
it's a nightmare.

509
00:24:29,719 --> 00:24:31,186
It's a chilling,
frightening journey

510
00:24:31,221 --> 00:24:33,054
of one man
into a mystifying unknown.

511
00:24:33,089 --> 00:24:36,191
You're invited to join that man
in a most unique experience.

512
00:24:36,226 --> 00:24:39,311
Next week, earl holliman asks,
and you'll ask with him,

513
00:24:39,346 --> 00:24:40,562
"where is everybody?"

514
00:24:42,614 --> 00:24:43,815
Here's an item we forgot-

515
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:46,318
a moment for the people
who pay the tab.

516
00:24:46,353 --> 00:24:48,820
It's often said that a picture
is worth a thousand words,

517
00:24:48,855 --> 00:24:50,071
case in point.

518
00:24:50,705 --> 00:24:52,574
Before we meet again,

519
00:24:52,609 --> 00:24:55,076
try oasis-
you'll know what i mean.

520
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:46,177
Be sure and watchgunsmoke,
starring james arness,

521
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:49,931
saturday nights over most
of these same stations.
