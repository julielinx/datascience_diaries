1
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:13,513
You're traveling
through another dimension-

2
00:00:13,548 --> 00:00:16,516
a dimension not only of sight
and sound, but of mind.

3
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,518
A journey into a wondrous land

4
00:00:18,553 --> 00:00:21,021
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

5
00:00:21,056 --> 00:00:23,023
That's the signpost up ahead.

6
00:00:23,058 --> 00:00:24,724
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

7
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,554
A honey
from hunnicut!

8
00:00:54,589 --> 00:00:56,056
Drive it in
good health!

9
00:01:00,595 --> 00:01:02,062
Too much power, eh?

10
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:27,187
We're just looking.

11
00:01:27,222 --> 00:01:28,688
Well, that's what
we want you to do.

12
00:01:28,723 --> 00:01:30,190
Nobody pushes you
around here.

13
00:01:30,225 --> 00:01:31,391
No, sir, young man.

14
00:01:31,426 --> 00:01:33,893
Around here, you can pause,
exhale, check, recheck,

15
00:01:33,928 --> 00:01:34,894
think, peruse, contemplate,

16
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:36,896
wade through,
thumb over, dip into.

17
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:37,897
Be my guest, folks.

18
00:01:37,932 --> 00:01:39,899
We were thinking of
maybe a little coupe-

19
00:01:39,934 --> 00:01:41,401
something
around $500-

20
00:01:41,436 --> 00:01:43,403
but as late
a model as we can...

21
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:45,105
late?

22
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:47,107
You shock me, you know that?

23
00:01:47,142 --> 00:01:49,109
You know your husband
shocked me just then?

24
00:01:49,144 --> 00:01:50,110
Well, he was only...

25
00:01:50,145 --> 00:01:51,611
do you know why
you shocked me?

26
00:01:51,646 --> 00:01:53,313
I'll tell you why
you shocked me.

27
00:01:53,348 --> 00:01:54,814
It's because you've succumbed

28
00:01:54,849 --> 00:01:57,817
to the propaganda
of every cement-headed clod

29
00:01:57,852 --> 00:01:58,818
up and down this street.

30
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,820
I said propaganda.

31
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:03,823
They like to push
the late models,

32
00:02:03,858 --> 00:02:05,325
don't they?

33
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,326
They do, don't they?

34
00:02:06,361 --> 00:02:08,828
You know why they
push the late models?

35
00:02:08,863 --> 00:02:11,331
You think it's
because they're honest,

36
00:02:11,366 --> 00:02:13,833
law-abiding, rigidly
moral churchgoers?

37
00:02:13,868 --> 00:02:15,335
Let me tell you
something, young man.

38
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:16,336
They push...

39
00:02:16,371 --> 00:02:17,837
they push the late models

40
00:02:17,872 --> 00:02:19,839
because that is
where the profit margin is.

41
00:02:19,874 --> 00:02:22,842
They'll cram those
post-'54s down your gullet

42
00:02:22,877 --> 00:02:25,845
because they would rather
make a buck than a friend.

43
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,847
They would rather
make a profit

44
00:02:27,882 --> 00:02:28,848
than a relationship.

45
00:02:28,883 --> 00:02:30,850
They would rather
cram their wallets

46
00:02:30,885 --> 00:02:32,352
full of cash

47
00:02:32,387 --> 00:02:34,854
than fill their hearts
with the fellowship

48
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:36,356
of men to men.

49
00:02:36,391 --> 00:02:37,357
We're really
just looking

50
00:02:37,392 --> 00:02:38,858
for a good
transportation car,

51
00:02:38,893 --> 00:02:40,360
and we thought
the newer the car...

52
00:02:40,395 --> 00:02:42,862
new? That's where you've
completely gone wrong.

53
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:45,365
That's where you've
suddenly gone amiss.

54
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,368
That's the juncture that's
headed you into a blind alley.

55
00:02:48,403 --> 00:02:49,869
You don't want a new car.

56
00:02:49,904 --> 00:02:51,871
You don't want one
of those rinky-dink,

57
00:02:51,906 --> 00:02:53,873
slapped-together
on an assembly line,

58
00:02:53,908 --> 00:02:55,375
covered with
chintzy chrome,

59
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:58,378
fin tails, idiotic names
and no more workmanship

60
00:02:58,413 --> 00:02:59,879
than you can stick
into a thimble.

61
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,981
No.

62
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,983
I'll tell you what you want.

63
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:06,986
You want the craftsmanship
that comes with age

64
00:03:07,021 --> 00:03:09,489
the dependability
of proven performers

65
00:03:09,524 --> 00:03:12,992
the dignity of
traditional transportation.

66
00:03:13,027 --> 00:03:14,994
This is what you want.

67
00:03:15,029 --> 00:03:16,996
A '38 coupe.

68
00:03:17,031 --> 00:03:19,999
It'll get you where
you want to go.

69
00:03:20,034 --> 00:03:21,501
It'll get you back.

70
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:26,005
This, as the banner
already has proclaimed

71
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,507
is mr. Harvey hunnicut-

72
00:03:27,542 --> 00:03:29,509
an expert on commerce
and con jobs

73
00:03:29,544 --> 00:03:32,512
a brash, bright and larceny-
loaded wheeler and dealer

74
00:03:32,547 --> 00:03:35,515
who when the good lord
passed out a conscience

75
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:38,017
must have gone
for a beer and missed out.

76
00:03:38,052 --> 00:03:40,520
And these are a couple
of other characters-

77
00:03:40,555 --> 00:03:42,522
a little old man
in a model-a car

78
00:03:42,557 --> 00:03:46,025
but not just any old man
and not just any model-a.

79
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,528
There's something
very special about them.

80
00:03:48,563 --> 00:03:52,031
In a few moments, they'll give
harvey hunnicut something

81
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:54,534
that he's never
experienced before.

82
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:56,536
Through the good offices
of a little magic

83
00:03:56,571 --> 00:03:58,538
they will unload on mr. Hunnicut

84
00:03:58,573 --> 00:04:00,540
the absolute necessity
to tell the truth.

85
00:04:00,575 --> 00:04:03,042
Where they come from
is conjecturable

86
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:05,545
but as to where they're
heading, this we know:

87
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,548
Because all of them and you
are on the threshold

88
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:10,049
of the twilight zone.

89
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:15,054
And did you know
that the original prototype

90
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:17,056
of this car
was the mark ii tank?

91
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:20,059
When you go down the freeway,
everybody else, out of the way!

92
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:22,562
Where the gearshift is
used to be the cannon.

93
00:04:22,597 --> 00:04:25,064
Now, why don't you and i
sit down and talk turkey

94
00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:27,567
because this baby is
the one you're going to buy.

95
00:04:27,602 --> 00:04:30,570
This baby is the one that
you're going to drive off...

96
00:04:30,605 --> 00:04:32,071
well,
first of all...

97
00:04:32,106 --> 00:04:33,573
could we look
it over a bit?

98
00:04:33,608 --> 00:04:34,574
Look!

99
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:35,575
Here, sit in it.

100
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:37,076
Get the feel of it.

101
00:04:37,111 --> 00:04:38,077
Relish in the luxury.

102
00:04:38,112 --> 00:04:40,079
See how they built cars
in the days

103
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,081
when cars were really built!

104
00:04:42,116 --> 00:04:43,583
Come on, young fellow!

105
00:04:43,618 --> 00:04:45,084
You, too, madam.

106
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:46,085
Park yourself in there

107
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,588
and enjoy it to
your heart's content.

108
00:04:48,623 --> 00:04:51,090
Boy, you know what
you really should have

109
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,092
when you sit
in a car like this?

110
00:04:53,127 --> 00:04:55,094
Candlelight,
a bottle of good wine

111
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:57,096
because this baby here
has dignity.

112
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:02,101
Relax for a minute,
i'll be right back.

113
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:11,210
Oh, how do you do.

114
00:05:11,245 --> 00:05:12,712
Well, that depends, grandpa.

115
00:05:12,747 --> 00:05:14,213
If you came here
to park this

116
00:05:14,248 --> 00:05:15,715
i'll just charge you
nominal rates

117
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,216
but if you're here
to sell it

118
00:05:17,251 --> 00:05:18,217
you'll have to give me

119
00:05:18,252 --> 00:05:20,219
three and a half minutes
for my little laugh.

120
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:25,224
I'll give you 15 bucks for it.

121
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:27,226
Any junkman will give you 12.

122
00:05:27,261 --> 00:05:30,229
The smithsonian might top
us both by a buck or two.

123
00:05:30,264 --> 00:05:32,231
It's a wonderful old car

124
00:05:32,266 --> 00:05:36,235
and they built them better
in the old days, i think.

125
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,337
Ah, grandfather dear

126
00:05:37,372 --> 00:05:38,838
that is the old
rhubarb, the saw

127
00:05:38,873 --> 00:05:40,840
the turkey everybody
and his brother

128
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:42,342
is trying to pull
on the open market.

129
00:05:42,377 --> 00:05:44,844
Cars were built better
in the old days, ha!

130
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:45,845
Ten years ago

131
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,347
they didn't know
how to build cars.

132
00:05:47,382 --> 00:05:48,848
Now it's the new
cars that sell.

133
00:05:48,883 --> 00:05:49,849
Don't mind these.

134
00:05:49,884 --> 00:05:51,351
It's the new cars
that sell.

135
00:05:51,386 --> 00:05:52,352
It's the new cars
that run.

136
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:53,853
It's the new cars

137
00:05:53,888 --> 00:05:56,356
that combine the genius
of mind, muscle

138
00:05:56,391 --> 00:05:57,357
and the assembly line.

139
00:05:57,392 --> 00:05:58,858
Oh, please...

140
00:05:58,893 --> 00:06:00,860
but i'll tell you
what i'll do for you

141
00:06:00,895 --> 00:06:02,362
because i love
your face.

142
00:06:02,397 --> 00:06:04,364
You remind me of
my own grandfather

143
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:06,366
rest his soul,
a man of dignity

144
00:06:06,401 --> 00:06:08,368
down through his
declining years

145
00:06:08,403 --> 00:06:11,371
until he died rescuing a
capsized boatload of people

146
00:06:11,406 --> 00:06:12,372
on the east river.

147
00:06:12,407 --> 00:06:14,374
I'll give you
25 bucks for it.

148
00:06:14,409 --> 00:06:15,875
Probably have
to tear it down

149
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:17,877
sell it wheel by
wheel, bolt by bolt

150
00:06:17,912 --> 00:06:20,380
to any itinerant junkman
that comes around

151
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,381
but 25 i'll go.

152
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:22,882
$25?

153
00:06:22,917 --> 00:06:24,384
Mm-hmm.

154
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:25,885
I kind of need
the money

155
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,887
but couldn't
you make it 30?

156
00:06:27,922 --> 00:06:29,389
You try me,
old friend.

157
00:06:29,424 --> 00:06:30,890
What does that mean?

158
00:06:30,925 --> 00:06:33,893
That means that
25 is going, going...

159
00:06:33,928 --> 00:06:36,396
that means that
25 is... gone!

160
00:06:36,431 --> 00:06:37,397
There we are.

161
00:06:37,432 --> 00:06:38,898
Ten, 20, and 25.

162
00:06:38,933 --> 00:06:39,899
There we are.

163
00:06:39,934 --> 00:06:42,402
Now, i'll tell you
what you do.

164
00:06:42,437 --> 00:06:45,405
You go in that
little office there.

165
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,408
You take your car
registration papers

166
00:06:48,443 --> 00:06:50,410
with you,
and hold it...

167
00:06:50,445 --> 00:06:53,413
did i say car?

168
00:06:53,448 --> 00:06:55,415
Vehicle, hmm.

169
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:56,916
Now, here, hmm.

170
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,435
Comfy?

171
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:48,468
Signed, sealed and
delivered, mr. Uh...

172
00:07:48,503 --> 00:07:49,469
hunnicut.

173
00:07:49,504 --> 00:07:50,970
Oh, yes, and here
are the keys.

174
00:07:51,005 --> 00:07:52,472
Thank you.

175
00:07:52,507 --> 00:07:54,474
Oh, by the way,
mr. Hunnicut.

176
00:07:54,509 --> 00:07:55,975
There is one other
small item

177
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:58,978
i ought to mention
to you about the car.

178
00:07:59,013 --> 00:08:00,480
Do, do.

179
00:08:00,515 --> 00:08:02,482
It's haunted.

180
00:08:02,517 --> 00:08:04,383
Haunted?

181
00:08:04,418 --> 00:08:05,384
You don't say.

182
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:07,286
Oh, yes,
without a doubt.

183
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:08,788
The car is
quite haunted.

184
00:08:08,823 --> 00:08:10,289
It's been haunted

185
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:13,292
ever since it came off
the assembly line

186
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:15,294
and every single
one of its owners

187
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:17,296
can attest
to this fact.

188
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:18,798
Well, now,
i don't suppose

189
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:21,801
you'd mind telling me
how it's haunted, hmm?

190
00:08:21,836 --> 00:08:23,302
You sign right there.

191
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:24,804
Or how i can
un-haunt it?

192
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:26,806
Oh, you'll find
out soon enough.

193
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:28,808
I will.

194
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:32,311
As for un-haunting it

195
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:34,814
you'll have
to sell the car.

196
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:35,815
Oh.

197
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:37,817
Well, good day,
mr. Hunnicut.

198
00:08:37,852 --> 00:08:39,318
It's been
a real pleasure.

199
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:41,821
Likewise, likewise.

200
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:44,824
I think you may find

201
00:08:44,859 --> 00:08:48,828
that you have actually gotten
the best of the bargain at that.

202
00:08:48,863 --> 00:08:52,231
My ancient friend, you do me
the ultimate injustice.

203
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:55,735
Our little transaction,
haunted or otherwise

204
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:57,737
was my charity case for the day.

205
00:08:57,772 --> 00:08:59,739
You dwell on that, will you?

206
00:08:59,774 --> 00:09:01,741
Dwell on it.

207
00:09:01,776 --> 00:09:04,744
No, no, no, mr. Hunnicut.

208
00:09:04,779 --> 00:09:08,748
You dwell on it.

209
00:09:08,783 --> 00:09:11,250
And i rather think you will.

210
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:26,966
Well?

211
00:09:27,001 --> 00:09:27,967
How much is it?

212
00:09:28,002 --> 00:09:28,968
It's not for sale.

213
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,471
Why not?

214
00:09:32,506 --> 00:09:34,974
Uh... well, i don't know.

215
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:36,776
This car we were
just sitting in.

216
00:09:36,811 --> 00:09:38,778
That's the one
you were pushing.

217
00:09:38,813 --> 00:09:41,280
Yeah, sure.

218
00:09:41,315 --> 00:09:46,786
I... i guess
i'm not pushing it anymore.

219
00:09:46,821 --> 00:09:50,289
This is a wreck, it's a rum-dum.

220
00:09:50,324 --> 00:09:51,791
It...

221
00:09:51,826 --> 00:09:55,294
oh... it hasn't got any points,
it hasn't got any rings

222
00:09:55,329 --> 00:09:56,796
it hasn't got any plugs

223
00:09:56,831 --> 00:10:00,299
and it'll leak gasoline like
it owns every oil well in texas.

224
00:10:00,334 --> 00:10:03,402
But the tires...

225
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:05,705
are very bad,
and the chassis's been bent

226
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:09,208
and if i said anything
about it being a runabout

227
00:10:09,243 --> 00:10:12,712
why, i meant it would run
about a block and then stop.

228
00:10:12,747 --> 00:10:15,715
And it'll cost you double
what you pay for it

229
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,217
when you start taking
it in for repairs

230
00:10:18,252 --> 00:10:21,120
and you'll start taking
it in for repairs

231
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,123
every third thursday
of the month.

232
00:10:24,158 --> 00:10:26,626
Well, what else
have you got?

233
00:10:26,661 --> 00:10:27,927
Oh, what else,
well...

234
00:10:27,962 --> 00:10:29,929
i... i'll...

235
00:10:29,964 --> 00:10:33,432
i haven't anything else
worthwhile to show you.

236
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:37,937
Everything in this lot should
have been condemned years ago.

237
00:10:37,972 --> 00:10:40,439
I got more lemons
per square foot

238
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:42,441
than a fruit grower in salinas.

239
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:44,443
And what you ought to do

240
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:47,947
you ought to hit one
of those reputable places

241
00:10:47,982 --> 00:10:51,951
and get what you pay for,
and something you really like

242
00:10:51,986 --> 00:10:55,454
but, uh, you shouldn't
come around here anymore.

243
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:58,457
Okay.

244
00:10:58,492 --> 00:10:59,458
Thanks.

245
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:00,459
Yeah.

246
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:02,461
Oh, hey...

247
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:06,766
never mind.

248
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:11,370
Let's go look
at television sets.

249
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:28,087
Sorry, i'm late, boss.

250
00:11:28,122 --> 00:11:29,588
I was down
at the junkyard

251
00:11:29,623 --> 00:11:31,590
checking on the '34
chevy wheel discs.

252
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,092
I found four of them.

253
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:35,995
Hey, what's
the action, boss?

254
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,496
Hmm?

255
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:40,499
Oh, things are a
little quiet around...

256
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:43,002
irv, you won't
believe what i...

257
00:11:43,037 --> 00:11:44,503
nah, you won't...

258
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:48,007
hey, how about trying
to move that '35 essex?

259
00:11:48,042 --> 00:11:49,008
Move it is right.

260
00:11:49,043 --> 00:11:51,010
It won't get anywhere
under its own power.

261
00:11:51,045 --> 00:11:52,511
All right,
knock it down to 55

262
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:55,014
tell everybody it's a museum
piece, last of its kind.

263
00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:56,515
And look!

264
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,017
You keep that hood closed,
you dope!

265
00:11:58,052 --> 00:11:59,518
How many time i gotta tell
you...

266
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:02,021
when you got an engine you can't
see for rust

267
00:12:02,056 --> 00:12:03,522
you gotta play a little
hide-and-seek.

268
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:05,024
You don't
go advertising the fact

269
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:06,525
you're trying to job a car

270
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,528
that carried french soldiers to
the first battle of the marne.

271
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:10,529
Now listen, irv, i...

272
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,236
...want you to put
a sign on the car

273
00:12:17,271 --> 00:12:20,239
that says it's for sale
as is, no guarantees

274
00:12:20,274 --> 00:12:21,640
and i...

275
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:23,642
think you
better open up

276
00:12:23,677 --> 00:12:25,144
both sides
of the hood

277
00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:27,646
so they can get a better
look at the engine.

278
00:12:27,681 --> 00:12:30,649
You want to sell it or
keep it for an heirloom?

279
00:12:30,684 --> 00:12:32,251
What's the matter...

280
00:12:32,286 --> 00:12:34,253
do i look all right to you, irv?

281
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,256
What did you have for dinner?

282
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:38,758
No, no, this is nuts.

283
00:12:38,793 --> 00:12:41,260
This is power of suggestion
or something.

284
00:12:41,295 --> 00:12:42,762
Hey, that old gleep
that sold me

285
00:12:42,797 --> 00:12:44,764
that model-a,
a real nutsy.

286
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:45,765
Gave me a song
and dance

287
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,266
about a haunted car.

288
00:12:47,301 --> 00:12:48,567
You get that?

289
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:49,568
Haunted car.

290
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:51,070
And i was stupid enough

291
00:12:51,105 --> 00:12:53,572
to stand there
and listen to him.

292
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:57,076
What i should have done
was call up the local hatch

293
00:12:57,111 --> 00:12:59,078
reserved a rubber room
for him.

294
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:03,082
Honey, this is
your ever-loving.

295
00:13:03,117 --> 00:13:05,584
Now, look, baby
about tonight

296
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:07,586
i'm going
to be a little late.

297
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:09,588
Well, it's
inventory time.

298
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:12,591
Look, i told you it
was inventory time.

299
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:16,095
What i'm going to be
doing tonight is i...

300
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:19,098
i'm going to be
playing poker with the boys

301
00:13:19,133 --> 00:13:23,102
and when i told you it was
inventory time last month

302
00:13:23,137 --> 00:13:26,105
i was playing poker
with the boys then.

303
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,107
You were doing what!

304
00:13:28,142 --> 00:13:29,608
Honey, don't
listen to me!

305
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:31,610
This is nuts,
i'm sick or something.

306
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:34,613
Look, what i'm really
going to be doing tonight

307
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:38,117
is i'm... going to be
playing poker with the boys.

308
00:13:38,152 --> 00:13:39,118
What is this?

309
00:13:39,153 --> 00:13:40,619
Am i crazy or something?

310
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:43,122
I got no control
over what i'm saying.

311
00:13:43,157 --> 00:13:44,123
I got no control...

312
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:46,625
irv...

313
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,628
i'm in the midst of a calamity.

314
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:50,629
That old gleep
i was telling you about

315
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:54,133
the one who said
that car was haunted...

316
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:55,134
he was right.

317
00:13:55,169 --> 00:13:58,137
Whoever owns that car
has to tell the truth.

318
00:13:58,172 --> 00:14:00,039
Hey, irv, you dig?

319
00:14:00,074 --> 00:14:03,542
Did you ever hear
anything more ghastly?

320
00:14:03,577 --> 00:14:05,544
Me... harvey hunnicut

321
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:09,048
from now on, as long
as i own that car

322
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:11,550
i have to tell the truth.

323
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:29,568
Well, here are the signs
you wanted, boss.

324
00:14:29,603 --> 00:14:31,070
Yeah.

325
00:14:31,105 --> 00:14:33,572
I've heard of low pressure
before, boss

326
00:14:33,607 --> 00:14:36,575
but let's face it-
this is no pressure.

327
00:14:38,612 --> 00:14:42,081
Irv, you know my wife
isn't speaking to me.

328
00:14:42,116 --> 00:14:44,083
Would that that were
your only worry, boss.

329
00:14:44,118 --> 00:14:46,585
You haven't moved a car
off the lot in three days.

330
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,087
I know.

331
00:14:48,122 --> 00:14:50,089
That old lady who came in
yesterday afternoon

332
00:14:50,124 --> 00:14:52,591
to buy that old auburn...
i mean, let's level now.

333
00:14:52,626 --> 00:14:55,094
How do you start a sales pitch
by telling the customer

334
00:14:55,129 --> 00:14:57,096
that if the car
was one year older

335
00:14:57,131 --> 00:15:00,099
moses could have driven it
across the red sea?

336
00:15:00,134 --> 00:15:03,102
There's a limit
to honesty, boss!

337
00:15:03,137 --> 00:15:06,105
Irving, i...

338
00:15:07,141 --> 00:15:09,108
i used to feel
that way myself.

339
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:15,114
I hate to bother
you now, boss

340
00:15:15,149 --> 00:15:17,116
but it's that thing
about my raise.

341
00:15:17,151 --> 00:15:18,117
Your raise?

342
00:15:18,152 --> 00:15:19,618
Well, it's six months today

343
00:15:19,653 --> 00:15:21,620
i don't want to bug you,
but you promised.

344
00:15:21,655 --> 00:15:24,123
You said that in six months
if i'd sold three cars,

345
00:15:24,158 --> 00:15:25,424
that you
would turn...

346
00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:26,926
oh. Yeah, well, sure.

347
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,428
When i... i...

348
00:15:29,463 --> 00:15:31,931
the day you get more money
out of me,

349
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,433
it'll be below zero
in the fijis.

350
00:15:34,468 --> 00:15:36,435
Every yokel who works here

351
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:38,938
starts and stops
at the same salary.

352
00:15:38,973 --> 00:15:41,440
I only dangle that raise
in front of them

353
00:15:41,475 --> 00:15:43,943
just as long as it
takes them to get wise.

354
00:15:43,978 --> 00:15:47,346
Irv... irv...

355
00:15:47,381 --> 00:15:49,848
for you to get more money
out of me

356
00:15:49,883 --> 00:15:51,850
would be just about as easy
as...

357
00:15:51,885 --> 00:15:55,354
pouring hot butter
into a wildcat's ear.

358
00:15:58,057 --> 00:16:01,060
Irv, that hurt me
more than it did you.

359
00:16:01,095 --> 00:16:02,061
Correction.

360
00:16:02,096 --> 00:16:05,564
This is going to hurt you
a lot more than it hurts me.

361
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:46,305
What's your pleasure, sir?

362
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,806
Oh, luther grimbley here.

363
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:49,308
Honest luther grimbley.

364
00:16:49,343 --> 00:16:52,311
30 years in politics,
currently up for reelection.

365
00:16:52,346 --> 00:16:53,312
Alderman, 13th ward.

366
00:16:53,347 --> 00:16:55,314
You've probably heard of me.

367
00:16:55,349 --> 00:16:57,316
Delighted.

368
00:16:57,351 --> 00:16:58,817
Something nice
in a model-a?

369
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:00,319
Beautiful, isn't it?

370
00:17:00,354 --> 00:17:01,320
That depends.

371
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,823
If you take 12 aspirin
and shut your eyes tight

372
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:06,325
you might call
it beautiful.

373
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,327
But in the cold
light of day, son

374
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:09,828
it's a wreck.

375
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:11,330
What about
its condition?

376
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:14,833
Well, let me tell
you one thing...

377
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:17,336
the block's cracked.

378
00:17:17,371 --> 00:17:18,837
Block cracked?

379
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:19,838
Block cracked.

380
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:22,341
What else?

381
00:17:22,376 --> 00:17:24,343
You can see
for yourself.

382
00:17:24,378 --> 00:17:27,346
You take a good look
at these tires.

383
00:17:27,381 --> 00:17:28,847
The rubber's shot.

384
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:29,848
Yeah, sure is.

385
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:32,351
Might be good
for a few years

386
00:17:32,386 --> 00:17:33,352
not many, though.

387
00:17:33,387 --> 00:17:34,853
Many?

388
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:37,856
This car is living
on borrowed time.

389
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:41,360
What...
what's she worth?

390
00:17:41,395 --> 00:17:42,861
Oh...

391
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:46,865
i mean assuming some clod
who wanted a real bum car

392
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,867
to use for a gag
or something

393
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:50,869
maybe... uh...
50 bucks?

394
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:52,371
50 bucks!

395
00:17:52,406 --> 00:17:53,872
All right, maybe 60.

396
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:55,374
Why not 30?

397
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:56,975
You don't understand,
do you?

398
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:58,477
This is a bad car,
you see.

399
00:17:58,512 --> 00:17:59,978
It's a lemon.

400
00:18:00,013 --> 00:18:01,480
Lemon?

401
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:05,684
Why you dirty dog, you.

402
00:18:05,719 --> 00:18:07,186
You clever son of a gun.

403
00:18:07,221 --> 00:18:08,687
That's the truth.

404
00:18:08,722 --> 00:18:10,689
That's the absolute truth.

405
00:18:10,724 --> 00:18:12,191
I've seen all kinds
of routines

406
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:13,692
all kinds of routines

407
00:18:13,727 --> 00:18:15,694
but you clever
little cookie, you.

408
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:18,697
This is the old reverse
english, isn't it?

409
00:18:18,732 --> 00:18:20,199
The old twister-oo?

410
00:18:20,234 --> 00:18:22,201
Why you sharp-shooting,
sharpie!

411
00:18:22,236 --> 00:18:24,203
You knew i wanted it,
didn't you?

412
00:18:24,238 --> 00:18:25,704
You little devil you!

413
00:18:25,739 --> 00:18:26,705
You knew i wanted it.

414
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,207
I'll tell you what.

415
00:18:28,242 --> 00:18:30,209
I'll give you
25 bucks for it.

416
00:18:30,244 --> 00:18:33,212
On account of it's good politics
to drive an old car.

417
00:18:33,247 --> 00:18:36,715
Makes people think you're
not getting rich off of them.

418
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,717
25 bucks!

419
00:18:38,752 --> 00:18:39,718
How about 22½?

420
00:18:39,753 --> 00:18:41,220
Huh?

421
00:18:41,255 --> 00:18:43,722
I didn't notice
the dent in the fender.

422
00:18:43,757 --> 00:18:45,724
Oh.

423
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:50,329
I mean $22.50,
the car and no strings.

424
00:18:50,364 --> 00:18:52,831
No, uh, strings?

425
00:18:52,866 --> 00:18:55,334
You better trot out
the strings, buddy boy.

426
00:18:55,369 --> 00:18:56,835
Trot out the strings.

427
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:58,337
I want to know what i'm getting.

428
00:18:58,372 --> 00:19:03,842
Well, $22.50, the car as is,
and, uh...

429
00:19:03,877 --> 00:19:05,844
and, uh, what?

430
00:19:05,879 --> 00:19:09,348
Uh... well... uh...
the car's haunted.

431
00:19:09,383 --> 00:19:11,350
Haunted?

432
00:19:11,385 --> 00:19:13,252
The car is haunted?

433
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:18,757
So it's haunted.

434
00:19:18,792 --> 00:19:22,261
I swear, you're the
cleverest cookie in the...

435
00:19:22,296 --> 00:19:24,263
you ought to be
in politics.

436
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:26,765
Haunted?

437
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:29,768
How is it haunted?

438
00:19:29,803 --> 00:19:32,171
Well, whoever owns it
has to tell the truth.

439
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:38,877
Whoever owns it has
to tell the truth?

440
00:19:38,912 --> 00:19:40,679
The whole truth,
and the only way

441
00:19:40,714 --> 00:19:43,682
he can stop telling the truth
is to sell the car.

442
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:51,490
How about this baby?

443
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:52,991
That's no baby.

444
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:54,493
That's a great-grandfather.

445
00:19:54,528 --> 00:19:57,996
Hasn't got any transmission,
no rear end, no axle.

446
00:19:58,031 --> 00:19:59,498
That one's shot.

447
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:00,999
That's the goods,
is it?

448
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:03,502
You have to tell
the truth, don't you?

449
00:20:03,537 --> 00:20:05,003
That's it.

450
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:07,506
That's the reason
for the song and dance.

451
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:09,508
You have
to tell the truth.

452
00:20:09,543 --> 00:20:11,009
Well, what about
the model-a?

453
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:14,012
I mean, in spite of
the fact that it's haunted

454
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:17,015
it's, it's still a swell...
conversation piece.

455
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,517
For some people,
maybe

456
00:20:18,552 --> 00:20:22,020
but not for old,
honest luther grimbley.

457
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:24,523
Buddy boy,
i'm in politics.

458
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:25,524
When you tell me

459
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:29,528
i got to start telling
the truth all the time

460
00:20:29,563 --> 00:20:31,029
holy hanna!

461
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:32,531
You know something?

462
00:20:32,566 --> 00:20:36,034
I couldn't make
a single political speech.

463
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:39,037
I couldn't run
for office again.

464
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:41,540
Now why don't you
sell this car

465
00:20:41,575 --> 00:20:44,042
to boss ryan
over at 12th ward.

466
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:47,546
I'd love to hear him
tell the truth just once.

467
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:50,048
Or the mayor, the mayor!

468
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,550
Why don't you...?

469
00:20:51,585 --> 00:20:54,052
Hey, why not even
to this guy, huh?

470
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:55,053
Who?

471
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:56,555
This fella?

472
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,056
Say, that's
not a bad idea.

473
00:20:58,091 --> 00:21:00,559
If you could get him
to tell the truth

474
00:21:00,594 --> 00:21:02,561
that might be
the greatest gag

475
00:21:02,596 --> 00:21:04,062
of all time.

476
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,067
Yeah...

477
00:21:09,102 --> 00:21:11,069
why not, huh?

478
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:13,572
Oh, boy!

479
00:21:13,607 --> 00:21:15,073
That would be...

480
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:23,582
your reasoning seems
valid, mr. Hunnicut.

481
00:21:23,617 --> 00:21:26,084
It's your motives
that we're concerned...

482
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:27,586
don't worry
about my motives.

483
00:21:27,621 --> 00:21:29,588
I bought the car
for 25 bucks

484
00:21:29,623 --> 00:21:30,589
i'm selling
it for 25.

485
00:21:30,624 --> 00:21:32,591
Talk it over
with your boss.

486
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:48,407
I believe we'll accept
your terms, mr. Hunnicut.

487
00:21:48,442 --> 00:21:49,908
You say $25
american money.

488
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:51,410
25 american dollars.

489
00:21:51,445 --> 00:21:52,411
I got the papers.

490
00:21:52,446 --> 00:21:54,413
Now, this is
the bill of sale

491
00:21:54,448 --> 00:21:56,915
the transfer of title,
the car registration.

492
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:58,917
Have your boss sign all three of
them on the dotted lines there.

493
00:21:58,952 --> 00:22:00,919
I'm empowered to handle
the signatures myself.

494
00:22:00,954 --> 00:22:02,421
Oh, no, no.

495
00:22:02,456 --> 00:22:04,423
The boss has to sign
them, you dig?

496
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:06,925
The boss, the boss
has to sign them.

497
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,428
A sort of memento
or souvenir, is that it?

498
00:22:09,463 --> 00:22:12,431
Uh, yeah,
something like that.

499
00:22:12,466 --> 00:22:14,433
Well, i'll see
what i can do.

500
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,348
Here we are.

501
00:22:29,383 --> 00:22:31,350
And here is the money.

502
00:22:31,385 --> 00:22:32,351
25 american dollars.

503
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:33,852
You lucky dog, you.

504
00:22:33,887 --> 00:22:36,855
You got a million bucks
worth of propaganda here

505
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:38,357
you know that?

506
00:22:38,392 --> 00:22:39,358
Now all you have to do

507
00:22:39,393 --> 00:22:41,360
is to try to tell
your folks

508
00:22:41,395 --> 00:22:42,861
that this is the kind
of a car

509
00:22:42,896 --> 00:22:44,863
the average american drives.

510
00:22:44,898 --> 00:22:46,365
You try and
tell them that.

511
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,867
These are your copies,
these are mine.

512
00:22:48,902 --> 00:22:50,369
That does it.

513
00:22:50,404 --> 00:22:53,372
Your boss is now
the new owner of this car.

514
00:22:53,407 --> 00:22:54,873
Drive it right off, buddy boy.

515
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:56,875
You drive it right off.

516
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:02,881
Is this the living end!

517
00:23:02,916 --> 00:23:05,884
And i got
his signature right here.

518
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:07,386
Nikita khrushchev.

519
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,391
Uh, long distance?

520
00:23:12,426 --> 00:23:14,393
Operator, say,
if an american citizen

521
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:17,896
has something real important
in the way of news...

522
00:23:17,931 --> 00:23:19,398
uh, well...

523
00:23:19,433 --> 00:23:24,903
i mean if it affects the foreign
policy of the united states...

524
00:23:24,938 --> 00:23:29,908
well, what i'd really
like to know is...

525
00:23:29,943 --> 00:23:33,912
can you get me through
to jack kennedy?

526
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,416
Couldn't happen you say?

527
00:23:37,451 --> 00:23:39,418
Far-fetched, way out,
tilt-of-center?

528
00:23:39,453 --> 00:23:42,421
Possible, but the next time
you buy an automobile

529
00:23:42,456 --> 00:23:43,422
if it happens to look

530
00:23:43,457 --> 00:23:45,924
as if it's gone through
the battle of the marne

531
00:23:45,959 --> 00:23:49,428
and the seller is ready to throw
into the bargain one of his arms

534
00:23:53,967 --> 00:23:57,436
when you were actually at chavez
ravine watching the dodgers.

535
00:23:57,471 --> 00:23:59,938
It'll be a fact
that you're the proud possessor

536
00:23:59,973 --> 00:24:01,440

by an exclusive dealer

00:24:04,478 --> 00:24:05,944

miss agnes moorehead

00:24:30,003 --> 00:24:31,970
in a tension-riddled attempt
at escape

547
00:24:32,005 --> 00:24:34,473
from a pair of very improbable
housebreakers.

548
00:24:34,508 --> 00:24:37,476

fiction buffs, fantasy lovers

549

the edge of his seat

into the realm of terror.
