00:00:06,606 --> 00:00:09,726
You unlock this door
with the key of imagination.

2
00:00:09,761 --> 00:00:12,228
Beyond it is another dimension-

3
00:00:12,263 --> 00:00:12,862
a dimension of sound,

4
00:00:14,149 --> 00:00:15,982
a dimension of sight,

5
00:00:16,017 --> 00:00:18,485
a dimension of mind.

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,621
You're moving into a land
of both shadow and substance,

7
00:00:21,656 --> 00:00:22,872
of things and ideas.

8
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:27,877
You've just crossed over
into the twilight zone.

9
00:00:32,882 --> 00:00:33,500
Oh, jeffrey,

10
00:00:34,134 --> 00:00:35,385
put those in the study.

11
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:36,636
All right.

12
00:00:37,253 --> 00:00:37,887
Crowded downtown?

13
00:00:37,922 --> 00:00:39,756
The greatest
mardi gras ever.

14
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:41,391
Least that's what
they're saying.

15
00:00:42,008 --> 00:00:43,259
How is he?

16
00:00:43,893 --> 00:00:45,762
Not good, not
good at all.

17
00:00:45,797 --> 00:00:47,013
Doctor's with him now,

18
00:00:47,048 --> 00:00:48,898
but he wants to be advised
when the relatives arrive.

19
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:50,767
Those relatives of his.

20
00:00:50,802 --> 00:00:55,155
I'm quite sure
they'll make themselves known.

21
00:01:03,913 --> 00:01:05,782
Well, sawbones?

22
00:01:05,817 --> 00:01:07,667
Well, it's too fast,

23
00:01:07,702 --> 00:01:09,536
it's too weak,
and it's too uneven.

24
00:01:09,571 --> 00:01:10,787
Where were you

25
00:01:10,822 --> 00:01:14,174
when they taught bedside manner
at medical school?

26
00:01:14,209 --> 00:01:16,042
Trying out for soccer?

27
00:01:16,077 --> 00:01:20,046
Jason, i have been
your physician for 25 years,

28
00:01:20,081 --> 00:01:22,549
and the first time
i treated you for a head cold

29
00:01:22,584 --> 00:01:26,302
and i allowed myself
one compassionate cluck,

30
00:01:26,337 --> 00:01:27,554
you threw a lamp at me.

31
00:01:27,589 --> 00:01:30,056
That established the pattern
then and there.

32
00:01:30,091 --> 00:01:33,810
I have put up with your
inept ministrations

33
00:01:33,845 --> 00:01:35,061
all these years

34
00:01:35,096 --> 00:01:38,198
because your candor is
a refreshing departure

35
00:01:38,233 --> 00:01:40,700
from the modern
medical norm.

36
00:01:40,735 --> 00:01:43,820
I ask you a straight,
simple question,

37
00:01:43,855 --> 00:01:46,322
i get a straight,
simple response.

38
00:01:48,243 --> 00:01:49,459
Sam...

39
00:01:49,494 --> 00:01:50,710
yes, jason, what is it?

40
00:01:50,745 --> 00:01:54,964
The oft-asked question
how long?

41
00:01:54,999 --> 00:01:56,583
Oh, jason,
you can't exactly say...

42
00:01:56,618 --> 00:01:57,834
tell me, sam,

43
00:01:57,869 --> 00:01:59,586
do i have a week?

44
00:01:59,621 --> 00:02:02,088
Do i have a day and a half?

45
00:02:02,123 --> 00:02:05,225
Or is there no need
to wind my watch to cover

46
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:08,094
the possibilities of
the next four hours?

47
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:10,597
Jason... my guess is

48
00:02:10,632 --> 00:02:13,099
you can measure your life
in moments.

49
00:02:13,134 --> 00:02:14,601
It can come
at any time now.

50
00:02:14,636 --> 00:02:17,103
But that fact
you're still here

51
00:02:17,138 --> 00:02:19,606
is a tribute to...
to inner strength

52
00:02:19,641 --> 00:02:22,108
most of us
don't even possess.

53
00:02:22,143 --> 00:02:25,862
Nonsense. It's attributable
to a cross-grained orneriness.

54
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:29,866
And the fact that there are one
or two things left to do

55
00:02:29,901 --> 00:02:31,751
before i leave this earth.

56
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:38,758
That's why i must stay alive
at least until midnight.

57
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:42,378
All right, jason,
all right.

58
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:44,881
Doctor?

59
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:46,132
Yes?

60
00:02:46,167 --> 00:02:48,268
I'll see you tomorrow.

61
00:02:48,303 --> 00:02:52,272
Yes, jason,
i believe you will...

62
00:02:52,307 --> 00:02:54,774
god willing.

63
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:02,649
Mr. Jason foster,
a tired ancient

64
00:03:02,684 --> 00:03:05,785
who on this particular
mardi gras evening

65
00:03:05,902 --> 00:03:07,153
will leave the earth.

66
00:03:07,188 --> 00:03:09,656
But before departing,
he has some things to do,

67
00:03:09,691 --> 00:03:12,158
some services to perform,
some debts to pay

68
00:03:12,193 --> 00:03:14,661
and some justice to mete out.

69
00:03:14,696 --> 00:03:17,163
This is new orleans,
mardi gras time.

70
00:03:17,198 --> 00:03:20,917
It is also the twilight zone.

71
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:41,521
Oh, what a ghastly trip.

72
00:03:41,556 --> 00:03:42,772
I'm absolutely
exhausted!

73
00:03:43,406 --> 00:03:44,657
Here, take this,
jeffrey.

74
00:03:44,692 --> 00:03:45,909
And these, too.

75
00:03:45,944 --> 00:03:47,410
Yes, sir.

76
00:03:47,445 --> 00:03:49,279
Jeffrey, are
our rooms ready?

77
00:03:49,913 --> 00:03:51,781
Yes, ma'am,
all prepared.

78
00:03:51,816 --> 00:03:53,032
Oh, fine.
Thank you.

79
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:54,784
Good afternoon.

80
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:58,538
Dr. Thorn!

81
00:03:58,573 --> 00:04:01,040
How nice to see you!

82
00:04:01,075 --> 00:04:03,543
Well, emily,
how are you?

83
00:04:03,578 --> 00:04:06,679
Oh... i'm bearing up,
doctor,

84
00:04:06,714 --> 00:04:07,931
under the circumstances.

85
00:04:07,966 --> 00:04:10,433
You remember
my husband, wilfred?

86
00:04:10,468 --> 00:04:11,684
Oh, yes.

87
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:14,187
Hello, doctor.
We met some time ago.

88
00:04:14,222 --> 00:04:16,689
And this is my son,

89
00:04:16,724 --> 00:04:17,941
wilfred jr.

90
00:04:17,976 --> 00:04:18,558
Hi.

91
00:04:18,593 --> 00:04:20,443
And my daughter,

92
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:21,694
paula.

93
00:04:21,729 --> 00:04:22,312
Hello.

94
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:26,699
Your father has been
expecting you, emily.

95
00:04:26,734 --> 00:04:27,951
I'm awfully glad
you can be here.

96
00:04:27,986 --> 00:04:29,819
Oh, that silly mardi gras.

97
00:04:29,854 --> 00:04:32,322
Oh, really, the traffic
was just unspeakable.

98
00:04:32,357 --> 00:04:34,824
All the shouting,
screaming, rude people.

99
00:04:34,859 --> 00:04:36,709
It's a wonder
father's chauffeur

100
00:04:36,744 --> 00:04:37,961
was ever able
to get us...

101
00:04:37,996 --> 00:04:39,212
emily...

102
00:04:39,247 --> 00:04:41,214
your father is extremely ill.

103
00:04:41,249 --> 00:04:42,465
In my opinion,

104
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,968
it is only a matter
of days, even hours.

105
00:04:45,003 --> 00:04:48,087
Oh, how perfectly awful.

106
00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:50,590
But, of course,
we've been expecting it.

107
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:54,227
Haven't we?

108
00:04:55,345 --> 00:04:57,230
Oh, incidentally,
doctor,

109
00:04:57,265 --> 00:04:58,481
i've been getting

110
00:04:58,516 --> 00:05:02,235
these absolutely horrible
muscle spasms in my arm.

111
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,487
Sometimes they're
just unbearable.

112
00:05:04,522 --> 00:05:06,356
Perhaps you might
prescribe something...

113
00:05:06,391 --> 00:05:06,990
emily...

114
00:05:07,025 --> 00:05:08,858
i'm sorry,
but i have

115
00:05:08,893 --> 00:05:11,361
other patients
to visit today.

116
00:05:11,396 --> 00:05:12,996
Oh, yes, of course.

117
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:16,749
If you'll all excuse me.

118
00:05:16,784 --> 00:05:17,367
Oh, doctor?

119
00:05:17,402 --> 00:05:18,618
Yes?

120
00:05:18,653 --> 00:05:20,253
I'll see you
to the door.

121
00:05:20,288 --> 00:05:22,755
You two take
your mother upstairs.

122
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:27,126
Tell me, uh...

123
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:30,263
the old boy's
in bad shape, huh?

124
00:05:31,514 --> 00:05:33,383
"The old boy" is dying.

125
00:05:33,418 --> 00:05:35,268
Good afternoon.

126
00:05:44,527 --> 00:05:47,030
Well, father.

127
00:05:47,065 --> 00:05:48,281
Father.

128
00:05:48,316 --> 00:05:53,903
Oh! Father, you're awake.

129
00:05:55,154 --> 00:05:56,406
How are you, emily?

130
00:05:56,441 --> 00:05:58,908
Oh...

131
00:05:58,943 --> 00:06:00,793
i'm bearing up.

132
00:06:00,828 --> 00:06:02,045
Bearing up?

133
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,798
You sound like job
itemizing his calamities.

134
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:08,668
What's your illness
this month, emily?

135
00:06:08,703 --> 00:06:11,804
It doesn't matter, father.
I'll muddle through.

136
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:16,809
You are the four most changeless
people on this earth.

137
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:20,430
I don't like being ill, father,
if that's what you mean.

138
00:06:20,465 --> 00:06:21,681
Don't you?

139
00:06:21,716 --> 00:06:24,183
Well, i find that
hard to believe...

140
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:27,937
considering
in the past 25 years,

141
00:06:27,972 --> 00:06:29,822
you've been at death's door
so often,

142
00:06:29,857 --> 00:06:32,942
it's a wonder you haven't worn
a hole in the mat.

143
00:06:32,977 --> 00:06:34,577
Well!

144
00:06:34,612 --> 00:06:36,446
Father!

145
00:06:36,481 --> 00:06:38,331
And wilfred...

146
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:41,200
how's business?

147
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:44,954
Oh, making a little,
losing a little, father,

148
00:06:44,989 --> 00:06:47,457
but i manage
to keep my head above water.

149
00:06:47,492 --> 00:06:49,342
You know, wilfred,
i think the only book

150
00:06:49,377 --> 00:06:51,210
you ever read was a ledger.

151
00:06:53,096 --> 00:06:57,467
I think if someone cut you open,
they would find a cash register.

152
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:01,220
Oh, really, father?

153
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:01,854
Really.

154
00:07:06,476 --> 00:07:07,727
And you, paula.

155
00:07:07,762 --> 00:07:09,979
Delighted to see
you, grandfather.

156
00:07:10,014 --> 00:07:13,616
Now, that's friendly of you
to tell me that...

157
00:07:13,651 --> 00:07:16,119
considering
that you haven't seen me yet.

158
00:07:16,154 --> 00:07:19,238
All you've seen
is your mirror image.

159
00:07:19,989 --> 00:07:23,126
Oh, grandfather,
you're very naughty,

160
00:07:23,161 --> 00:07:24,627
really, you are.

161
00:07:24,662 --> 00:07:27,246
We've had the most miserable,
long trip,

162
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:30,383
and mother hasn't stopped
complaining one instant.

163
00:07:30,418 --> 00:07:31,634
Well!

164
00:07:31,669 --> 00:07:34,137
Do you hear that, father?

165
00:07:34,172 --> 00:07:36,389
The younger
generation.

166
00:07:36,424 --> 00:07:41,144
"He jests at scars
that never felt a wound."

167
00:07:41,179 --> 00:07:43,646
Oh, emily, my dear.

168
00:07:43,681 --> 00:07:48,017
I believe that my trouble
is hardening of the arteries

169
00:07:48,052 --> 00:07:49,268
in a very sick heart.

170
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:53,022
But if you don't stop playing
sarah bernhardt,

171
00:07:53,057 --> 00:07:54,273
i think i
shall succumb

172
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:57,410
to an intestinal
disorder.

173
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:04,283
And... there's wilfred jr.,

174
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:06,919
looking as
aware as ever.

175
00:08:07,537 --> 00:08:08,788
Wilfred, dear,

176
00:08:08,823 --> 00:08:11,424
tell grandfather
how nice it is to see him.

177
00:08:13,176 --> 00:08:16,295
It's nice to see you
again, grandfather.

178
00:08:16,546 --> 00:08:20,299
It was very nice and gracious
of you all to come see me.

179
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:23,936
Why, father dear, wild horses

180
00:08:23,971 --> 00:08:27,690
couldn't have kept us away,
even my own agony.

181
00:08:27,725 --> 00:08:30,193
Oh, i hope you
survive, emily.

182
00:08:30,228 --> 00:08:33,696
Now, i've planned
that you all have

183
00:08:33,731 --> 00:08:36,199
an excellent dinner
this evening,

184
00:08:36,234 --> 00:08:38,701
and then we're going
to have a surprise.

185
00:08:38,736 --> 00:08:41,821
Oh, grandfather,
it's mardi gras,

186
00:08:41,856 --> 00:08:44,323
and i was rather hoping
you'd know of some...

187
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:46,075
nice young man.

188
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:49,212
But we're going to have
a partyhere, paula.

189
00:08:49,247 --> 00:08:52,715
We're going to have
a marvelous time.

190
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:56,586
And i've arranged
for all of us to...

191
00:08:56,621 --> 00:08:58,471
to wear masks.

192
00:08:58,506 --> 00:08:59,472
What?

193
00:08:59,507 --> 00:09:01,090
Masks?

194
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,725
How droll, father.

195
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,976
Masks!

196
00:09:04,011 --> 00:09:07,096
I swear, you people
don't just celebrate

197
00:09:07,131 --> 00:09:08,981
the mardi gras,
you succumb to it.

198
00:09:10,134 --> 00:09:11,350
Masks, indeed.

199
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:13,236
That might be fun.

200
00:09:13,271 --> 00:09:16,239
Oh, it shall be,
junior, my boy.

201
00:09:16,274 --> 00:09:17,490
It shall be.

202
00:09:17,525 --> 00:09:20,610
Oh, perhaps not
the same degree

203
00:09:20,645 --> 00:09:22,495
of excitement
that you get

204
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:24,363
from torturing
small animals

205
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:26,866
as i've seen you
do in the past.

206
00:09:26,901 --> 00:09:28,117
Lay off, grandfather.

207
00:09:28,152 --> 00:09:30,620
Besides, that was
a long time ago.

208
00:09:30,655 --> 00:09:33,122
Wilfred's getting along
very well

209
00:09:33,157 --> 00:09:34,373
in school now, father.

210
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:36,259
He made
the football team.

211
00:09:36,294 --> 00:09:38,761
Chip off the old block,
right, son?

212
00:09:38,796 --> 00:09:40,630
Chip off the old
block, grandfather.

213
00:09:40,665 --> 00:09:42,515
Oh, i'm sure of it.

214
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:45,017
Now, why don't
you all go

215
00:09:45,052 --> 00:09:47,520
and prepare for dinner?

216
00:09:47,555 --> 00:09:49,388
We're going to have

217
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:51,891
a very interesting
evening.

218
00:09:51,926 --> 00:09:55,027
As a matter of fact,
i'll guarantee it.

219
00:09:55,062 --> 00:09:57,396
Anything you say,
father.

220
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:03,536
Come along, darlings.

221
00:10:12,295 --> 00:10:14,914
Excuse me, sir.

222
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:21,804
Your milk, mr. Foster.

223
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,307
Oh, thank
you, jeffrey.

224
00:10:24,342 --> 00:10:27,426
Anything else
i can do for you?

225
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:30,563
Yes. You may
get the masks

226
00:10:30,598 --> 00:10:33,683
and put them in the
study, if you will.

227
00:10:33,718 --> 00:10:35,568
Yes, sir.

228
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:07,133
Oh, really.

229
00:11:07,168 --> 00:11:10,269
I think this whole thing
is too ridiculous.

230
00:11:10,304 --> 00:11:12,772
It's the most exciting night
of the whole year,

231
00:11:12,807 --> 00:11:17,143
and we... we sit here in this...
this mausoleum.

232
00:11:17,178 --> 00:11:19,645
The whole city
of new orleans is dancing,

233
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,896
and what do we do?

234
00:11:20,931 --> 00:11:26,535
We have a death watch
for a crazy old man.

235
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:29,655
Did you have a swinging time
in new orleans, baby?

236
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,657
Oh, indeed.

237
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:34,794
We wore funny masks

238
00:11:34,829 --> 00:11:40,416
and all sat around
and looked at each other.

239
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:44,804
Oh, i'm so bored.

240
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:52,178
Ah, that'll be all,
jeffrey.

241
00:11:52,213 --> 00:11:53,429
Thank you.

242
00:11:53,464 --> 00:11:54,680
Yes, sir.

243
00:11:54,715 --> 00:11:57,817
Well, tell me, my loved ones,

244
00:11:57,852 --> 00:12:00,936
did you have a
satisfactory dinner?

245
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:02,822
Oh, yes, yes, yes,
we did, father.

246
00:12:02,857 --> 00:12:05,941
Sumptuous, father.
Really excellent.

247
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:09,078
Do you think it wise
to be up like this?

248
00:12:09,113 --> 00:12:09,945
Wise?

249
00:12:10,579 --> 00:12:14,333
No, no, but
necessary, assuredly.

250
00:12:14,368 --> 00:12:18,087
Tell me, have you
examined your masks?

251
00:12:18,122 --> 00:12:19,955
Ourmasks?

252
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,207
They're-they're,
uh, unique, father.

253
00:12:22,493 --> 00:12:24,960
They are very unique.

254
00:12:25,594 --> 00:12:28,714
You know, they are made
by an old cajun.

255
00:12:29,965 --> 00:12:31,851
"Made" is inaccurate.

256
00:12:31,886 --> 00:12:33,102
They are created.

257
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:37,606
I am told that in addition
to their artistic value,

258
00:12:37,641 --> 00:12:40,726
they have certain, uh...

259
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:43,229
certain properties.

260
00:12:46,115 --> 00:12:47,983
They're worn
only during the mardi gras,

261
00:12:48,018 --> 00:12:51,120
and there's a ritual
to the wearing.

262
00:12:51,155 --> 00:12:55,491
One tries to select a mask
that is the antithesis

263
00:12:55,526 --> 00:12:57,376
of what the wearer is.

264
00:12:57,411 --> 00:12:59,495
Oh, sure.

265
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:03,499
Well, that's, uh,
very interesting.

266
00:13:03,534 --> 00:13:06,635
Um, very interesting.

267
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,504
Yes, it is.

268
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:12,258
Now, shall we select
our masks?

269
00:13:12,293 --> 00:13:14,760
Tell me, wilfred,

270
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:18,514
how do you fancy
yourself?

271
00:13:18,549 --> 00:13:21,016
Oh, uh, i don't
understand, father.

272
00:13:21,051 --> 00:13:23,519
Oh, come now,
be candid.

273
00:13:24,153 --> 00:13:25,404
When you shave
in the morning,

274
00:13:25,439 --> 00:13:27,907
what looks back at you
from the mirror?

275
00:13:27,942 --> 00:13:29,158
Really, father,

276
00:13:29,193 --> 00:13:31,660
i think we're a little
old for parlor games...

277
00:13:31,695 --> 00:13:33,529
let me be the judge of that.

278
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:39,535
Now, i want an honest
self-assessment.

279
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:42,037
You're serious,
aren't you?

280
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:44,540
I was never more serious.

281
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:47,042
Well, i'm an
affable man.

282
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:48,928
I've always been
an affable man.

283
00:13:49,545 --> 00:13:51,430
Oh, you're
an affable man.

284
00:13:51,465 --> 00:13:54,550
Well, then,
you're, uh, friendly?

285
00:13:54,585 --> 00:13:58,304
You're outgoing?
You're, uh, extrovertish?

286
00:13:58,339 --> 00:14:00,189
I think so.

287
00:14:00,224 --> 00:14:02,691
Yes, then, along
with this affability,

288
00:14:02,726 --> 00:14:06,445
you have a certain rapport
with your fellow man.

289
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,696
Uh, yes, indeed.

290
00:14:07,731 --> 00:14:11,450
Uh-huh. Now, the opposite
of all this...

291
00:14:11,485 --> 00:14:14,570
amiability would be, uh...

292
00:14:14,605 --> 00:14:17,706
this face here.

293
00:14:17,741 --> 00:14:20,209
Look at it.

294
00:14:20,244 --> 00:14:21,460
Charming.

295
00:14:22,746 --> 00:14:24,580
Wear it!

296
00:14:24,615 --> 00:14:27,082
Live with it
a while, wilfred.

297
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:29,969
It has great subtlety, wilfred.

298
00:14:30,004 --> 00:14:33,722
There's greed,
avarice, cruelty...

299
00:14:33,757 --> 00:14:38,727
all of the character traits
that you don't have.

300
00:14:44,733 --> 00:14:49,104
Ah, and my dear, brave emily.

301
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:51,240
I'm really not
up to this, father.

302
00:14:51,275 --> 00:14:54,360
Of course you are, my dear.
You're up to anything.

303
00:14:54,395 --> 00:14:55,861
Your courage
dictates

304
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:58,998
this brief period
of sacrifice.

305
00:14:59,033 --> 00:15:00,616
Now...

306
00:15:00,651 --> 00:15:03,118
look at this
face, my dear.

307
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:05,621
The face of a
self-centered coward,

308
00:15:05,656 --> 00:15:07,506
a gutless flab...

309
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:11,877
in contrast to your
intrepid valor.

310
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:15,631
Here, emily.

311
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:18,767
And the one who walks
in beauty like the night.

312
00:15:18,802 --> 00:15:22,388
Frankly, grandfather, i think
this whole thing is a bore.

313
00:15:22,423 --> 00:15:25,891
Oh, but, paula,
look at that beauty,

314
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:28,527
that insolent
hauteur,

315
00:15:28,562 --> 00:15:31,030
that skin-deep
vanity.

316
00:15:31,065 --> 00:15:32,898
It has none
of your heart,

317
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:36,035
none of your
selflessness.

318
00:15:41,657 --> 00:15:43,542
Wear it, paula,

319
00:15:43,577 --> 00:15:46,662
just for a few hours.

320
00:15:46,697 --> 00:15:51,667
And the timid,
gentle wilfred jr. Over there.

321
00:15:54,169 --> 00:15:56,055
Ah, come on, grandfather.

322
00:15:56,090 --> 00:16:00,309
Now, this would be your mask,
wilfred, my boy.

323
00:16:00,344 --> 00:16:03,929
It's a face
of a dull, stupid clown-

324
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:09,435
in contrast to your
gentle refinement, your...

325
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:12,321
courteous civility.

326
00:16:12,356 --> 00:16:14,189
Here.

327
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:19,828
Uh... what about
your mask, father?

328
00:16:19,863 --> 00:16:21,330
Oh, this is mine.

329
00:16:21,365 --> 00:16:25,084
The face of death,
because i'm alive, understand?

330
00:16:25,119 --> 00:16:26,585
I shall wear
the thing

331
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,454
stalking me
at this moment.

332
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:33,459
Father, you
don't mean...

333
00:16:33,494 --> 00:16:35,344
we have towear
these ugly things?

334
00:16:35,379 --> 00:16:37,212
Only for a few hours.

335
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:39,715
Only till the unmasking
at midnight.

336
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:42,217
Well, i won't wear mine.

337
00:16:42,718 --> 00:16:43,969
Me neither.
It's stupid.

338
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:45,220
Well, father,

339
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:48,357
it seems we're
somewhat at odds here.

340
00:16:48,392 --> 00:16:51,110
Notreally, wilfred.

341
00:16:51,145 --> 00:16:54,229
You all came here
for one purpose:

342
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:57,366
To watch me go
and cry "bon voyage."

343
00:16:57,401 --> 00:17:00,369
To put coins
on my closed eyes

344
00:17:00,404 --> 00:17:02,121
and with your
free hands,

345
00:17:02,156 --> 00:17:04,623
start grabbing things
from my shelves.

346
00:17:04,658 --> 00:17:05,874
Father, that's cruel.

347
00:17:05,909 --> 00:17:07,126
That's truth!

348
00:17:07,161 --> 00:17:09,628
You came to reap
everything i've sown,

349
00:17:09,663 --> 00:17:12,748
to collect everything
i've built.

350
00:17:12,783 --> 00:17:15,250
Well, i shall not
disappoint you.

351
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:17,136
Everything is yours.

352
00:17:17,171 --> 00:17:19,004
Everything
is prepared.

353
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,005
The will is made.

354
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,890
The four of you inherit
everything i own.

355
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:24,393
Everything.

356
00:17:24,428 --> 00:17:30,015
Money, house, property holdings,
stocks, bonds- everything.

357
00:17:30,265 --> 00:17:33,402
Father, you're breaking
our hearts.

358
00:17:33,437 --> 00:17:36,522
That's the most touching thing
you ever dredged up

359
00:17:36,557 --> 00:17:39,024
by way of conversation, wilfred.

360
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:43,412
But i must include
this addendum,

361
00:17:43,447 --> 00:17:45,914
this small proviso.

362
00:17:45,949 --> 00:17:49,668
You shall wear your masks
until midnight.

363
00:17:49,703 --> 00:17:53,038
If any one of you
should take them off,

364
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:56,675
from my estate,
you shall each receive

365
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:58,544
train fare
back to boston,

366
00:17:58,927 --> 00:18:00,179
and that's it!

367
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,800
Well, we won't be
spoilsports.

368
00:18:04,835 --> 00:18:09,188
If this is your pleasure,
father, we'll indulge you.

369
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:38,217
And now, my dear ones,
we will wait until midnight.

370
00:18:46,842 --> 00:18:51,230
Oh... oh,
this is horrible.

371
00:18:51,265 --> 00:18:53,732
Oh, this is horrible,
father.

372
00:18:53,767 --> 00:18:55,601
I'm suffocating.

373
00:18:55,636 --> 00:18:58,103
I really am
suffocating!

374
00:18:58,138 --> 00:19:00,606
I've had dull times before,
grandfather,

375
00:19:00,641 --> 00:19:01,857
but this is the worst.

376
00:19:01,892 --> 00:19:02,491
This takes it.

377
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:06,245
I don't know about the rest
of you, but i've had it.

378
00:19:06,495 --> 00:19:08,363
I can't stand this thing
on my face another minute!

379
00:19:08,398 --> 00:19:09,615
I'm taking it off!

380
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,500
I don't care!

381
00:19:11,535 --> 00:19:12,751
Stop it!
You stop it!

382
00:19:12,786 --> 00:19:14,002
I don't blame her.

383
00:19:14,037 --> 00:19:15,871
I don't blame
her a bit!

384
00:19:15,906 --> 00:19:17,756
This is cruel,
father.

385
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,625
I have to agree,
father.

386
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,510
Really, this has gone
far enough.

387
00:19:21,545 --> 00:19:23,378
We've been here
for hours

388
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:25,264
staring at these
grotesque masks.

389
00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:27,132
I think
there is a limit.

390
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:29,017
Please, father,

391
00:19:29,052 --> 00:19:32,771
please let us
take them off now.

392
00:19:35,891 --> 00:19:39,645
Have you all had your say?

393
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,146
Paula?

394
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:42,648
Wilfred jr.?

395
00:19:42,683 --> 00:19:43,649
You, emily?

396
00:19:43,684 --> 00:19:45,534
And that captain
of industry

397
00:19:45,569 --> 00:19:47,402
you're married to?

398
00:19:47,437 --> 00:19:51,156
Is there nothing else
you have to say to me?

399
00:19:51,191 --> 00:19:54,293
Only that i'm-i'm
feeling buried alive.

400
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:57,546
Me, too! I think
you're out of your mind.

401
00:19:57,581 --> 00:19:59,414
Come on, let us
take them off!

402
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:00,666
Father, i appeal to you.

403
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,168
It's more
than just discomfort.

404
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:04,419
It's becoming unbearable.

405
00:20:09,424 --> 00:20:11,310
What is it, father?

406
00:20:11,345 --> 00:20:13,812
It's, uh, what
you've all been waiting for,

407
00:20:13,847 --> 00:20:16,932
i believe, wilfred.

408
00:20:16,967 --> 00:20:20,686
Now you can dig deep
in the treasury.

409
00:20:20,721 --> 00:20:23,188
Are you feeling
weaker, father?

410
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:27,075
At last, a note of hope
in your voice, emily.

411
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:29,444
Why must you
always say

412
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:31,330
miserable, cruel
things to me?!

413
00:20:31,365 --> 00:20:32,581
I quite agree, father.

414
00:20:32,616 --> 00:20:34,333
Why, indeed, emily.

415
00:20:34,368 --> 00:20:37,452
Because you're cruel
and miserable people.

416
00:20:38,086 --> 00:20:40,589
Because none of you respond
to love.

417
00:20:40,624 --> 00:20:44,343
Emily responds only to what
her petty hungers dictate.

418
00:20:44,378 --> 00:20:46,712
Wilfred responds only to things

419
00:20:46,747 --> 00:20:49,214
that have weight
and bulk and value.

420
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:52,217
Hefeelsbooks;
he doesn't read them.

421
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:53,969
He appraises paintings;

422
00:20:54,004 --> 00:20:58,357
he doesn't seek out
their truth or their beauty.

423
00:20:58,392 --> 00:21:00,859
And paula there
lives in a mirror.

424
00:21:01,476 --> 00:21:02,861
The world is
nothing to her

425
00:21:03,478 --> 00:21:05,364
but a reflection
of herself.

426
00:21:05,399 --> 00:21:07,733
And her brother.

427
00:21:07,768 --> 00:21:10,235
Humanity to him
is a small animal

428
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:13,372
caught in a trap
to be tormented.

429
00:21:13,407 --> 00:21:16,491
His pleasure
is the giving of pain,

430
00:21:16,526 --> 00:21:17,876
and from this,
he feels

431
00:21:17,911 --> 00:21:19,745
the same sense
of fulfillment

432
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:20,996
most human
beings get

433
00:21:21,031 --> 00:21:22,881
from a kiss
or an embrace!

434
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:26,001
You're caricatures!

435
00:21:26,036 --> 00:21:27,252
All of you.

436
00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:29,638
Without your
masks...

437
00:21:29,673 --> 00:21:32,758
you're caricatures.

438
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:43,402
And now...

439
00:21:43,437 --> 00:21:46,521
you're all very rich.

440
00:21:46,556 --> 00:21:52,160
Now you own everything
that i have owned.

441
00:21:52,195 --> 00:21:56,531
You kept your bargain.
You wore the masks.

442
00:21:56,566 --> 00:22:00,285
Enjoy yourselves, dear ones.

443
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,422
I've lived a full life.

444
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:07,793
May god pity you.

445
00:22:30,198 --> 00:22:32,067
He's dead.

446
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:38,323
At long last, he's dead.

447
00:22:38,358 --> 00:22:40,208
Good.

448
00:22:40,243 --> 00:22:42,077
Now, let's celebrate!

449
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,333
Wha... what's the matter?

450
00:22:48,368 --> 00:22:50,218
What's the matter
with you all?

451
00:22:53,588 --> 00:22:56,091
Oh!

452
00:22:59,227 --> 00:23:01,096
Oh...

453
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:04,850
oh... oh.

454
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:35,380
I called you
just as soon as i
found out, doctor.

455
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:45,390
This must be death.

456
00:23:45,425 --> 00:23:48,527
No horror, no fear.

457
00:23:48,562 --> 00:23:50,395
Nothing but peace.

458
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,543
Mardi gras incident.

459
00:24:04,578 --> 00:24:07,045
Thedramatis personae
being four people

460
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,296
who came to celebrate

461
00:24:08,331 --> 00:24:10,799
and, in a sense,
let themselves go.

462
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:13,301
This they did with a vengeance.

463
00:24:13,336 --> 00:24:16,421
They now wear the faces
of all that was inside them,

464
00:24:16,456 --> 00:24:18,924
and they'll wear them
for the rest of their lives-

465
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:22,060
said lives now to be spent
in shadow.

466
00:24:22,095 --> 00:24:25,180
Tonight's tale of men,
the macabre and masks

467
00:24:25,215 --> 00:24:27,065
on the twilight zone.

468
00:24:31,086 --> 00:24:32,938
And now, mr. Serling.

469
00:24:32,973 --> 00:24:34,189
Next time
out in the twilight zone,

470
00:24:34,224 --> 00:24:37,943
we do a probe in depth into a
current cancer known as hatred

471
00:24:37,978 --> 00:24:40,445
and we tell you the story
of a little midwestern village

472
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,330
which wakes up
on a violent morning

473
00:24:42,365 --> 00:24:45,450
to discover that there is
no morning, no light, no sun.

474
00:24:45,485 --> 00:24:47,953
Only a frightening
and pervading darkness.

475
00:24:47,988 --> 00:24:51,089
It stars michael constantine
and paul fix,

476
00:24:51,124 --> 00:24:55,460
and it's called, "i am
the night- color me black."
