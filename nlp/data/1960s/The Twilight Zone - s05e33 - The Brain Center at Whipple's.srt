00:00:06,523 --> 00:00:09,642
You unlock this door
with the key of imagination.

2
00:00:09,677 --> 00:00:12,028
Beyond it is another dimension-

3
00:00:12,063 --> 00:00:13,279
a dimension of sound,

4
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:16,533
a dimension of sight,

5
00:00:16,568 --> 00:00:18,401
a dimension of mind.

6
00:00:18,436 --> 00:00:21,538
You're moving into a land
of both shadow and substance,

7
00:00:21,573 --> 00:00:22,789
of things and ideas.

8
00:00:22,824 --> 00:00:26,543
You've just crossed over
into the twilight zone.

9
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:35,301
Good evening, happy
family members and stockholders

10
00:00:35,336 --> 00:00:38,421
of the w.v. Whipple
manufacturing corporation.

11
00:00:38,456 --> 00:00:40,423
This year, as you've
already perceived,

12
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:43,560
we are bringing you the story
of your company's progress

13
00:00:43,595 --> 00:00:45,428
via the motion picture screen.

14
00:00:45,463 --> 00:00:49,065
This is our main operating plant
in the midwest.

15
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,934
You will note
the number of employees

16
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:52,819
attending the assembly line.

17
00:00:52,854 --> 00:01:00,326
In this one plant,
your company employs 34,827 men.

18
00:01:00,361 --> 00:01:03,446
Added to 13 other major
whipple plants

19
00:01:03,481 --> 00:01:05,331
across the country,

20
00:01:05,366 --> 00:01:11,454
we employ a total
of close to 283,000 personnel.

21
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:14,841
And now, to the stunning
and exciting news

22
00:01:14,876 --> 00:01:17,343
which i believe you'll agree
shows, once again,

23
00:01:17,378 --> 00:01:20,463
that at whipple's,
we only take forward steps.

24
00:01:21,097 --> 00:01:23,716
Now, family members,
and stockholders

25
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:26,853
of the whipple corporation,

26
00:01:26,888 --> 00:01:30,607
thisis the x109b14

27
00:01:30,642 --> 00:01:34,360
modified transistorized
totally automatic

28
00:01:34,395 --> 00:01:37,480
assembly machine
which eliminates

29
00:01:37,515 --> 00:01:41,367
61,000 jobs,

30
00:01:41,402 --> 00:01:44,487
73 bulky, inefficient machines,

31
00:01:44,522 --> 00:01:51,377
81,000 needless man hours
per 11 working days

32
00:01:51,412 --> 00:01:55,748
and $4 million
in expenditures each year

33
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:59,502
for employee hospitalization,
employee insurance,

34
00:01:59,537 --> 00:02:03,256
employee welfare and
employee profit participation.

35
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:07,010
Even as you stockholders
are watching this film,

36
00:02:07,045 --> 00:02:13,266
the first model of the x109b14
modified transistorized machine

37
00:02:13,301 --> 00:02:15,151
is being placed into operations

38
00:02:15,186 --> 00:02:17,020
here in our midwestern
main plant.

39
00:02:17,654 --> 00:02:20,907
Within six months,
our entire production facilities

40
00:02:20,942 --> 00:02:22,775
will be totally automated.

41
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:26,029
Ladies and gentlemen,
from now on

42
00:02:26,064 --> 00:02:29,165
whipple will operate
from a brain center

43
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,919
with machines such as this one.

44
00:02:34,787 --> 00:02:36,039
Ladies and gentlemen
of the whipple family,

45
00:02:36,074 --> 00:02:43,546
this ends
our 1967 year-end report.

46
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:51,688
Well, hanley,

47
00:02:51,723 --> 00:02:53,556
will that bring
the stockholders

48
00:02:53,591 --> 00:02:54,807
to their feet
cheering?

49
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:56,059
Not that i need
encouragement.

50
00:02:56,094 --> 00:02:59,195
The movie speaks
for itself.

51
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:01,698
It does, indeed.

52
00:03:01,733 --> 00:03:04,200
You didn't
like it, hanley?

53
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:07,954
I'm a chief engineer,
mr. Whipple.

54
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:10,456
My duties consist
of plant management.

55
00:03:10,491 --> 00:03:12,325
I'm not a film critic.

56
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,461
Look, i didn't expect
four stars, hanley.

57
00:03:15,496 --> 00:03:17,964
But as plant manager,
i wanted your point of view

58
00:03:17,999 --> 00:03:20,466
on the film's content.

59
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:22,335
I thought you'd have
some enthusiasm

60
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,837
for the changes
we're planning.

61
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:27,974
Doesn't it give you
the lay of the land?

62
00:03:28,009 --> 00:03:29,225
Can't you answer that?

63
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,476
Oh, yes.

64
00:03:30,511 --> 00:03:32,979
It gives me
the lay of the land.

65
00:03:33,014 --> 00:03:34,847
Tell me

66
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:37,984
do you really expect
to automate in six months?

67
00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:40,486
Four months is
a better guess.

68
00:03:40,521 --> 00:03:42,355
Lots of things
are going

69
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,606
in the trash heap.

70
00:03:43,641 --> 00:03:45,491
Time clocks,
for instance.

71
00:03:45,526 --> 00:03:49,862
There won't be anybody
to punch in or out.

72
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:52,999
I'll donate them
to a museum.

73
00:03:55,251 --> 00:03:56,502
Something,
hanley?

74
00:03:56,537 --> 00:03:58,371
Yes, something.

75
00:03:58,406 --> 00:03:59,622
Something like

76
00:03:59,657 --> 00:04:01,507
a lot of men out of work!

77
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:05,261
That, unfortunately,
is progress, hanley.

78
00:04:05,296 --> 00:04:08,381
You're a solid man
on assembly line planning.

79
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:11,517
But when it comes to progress

80
00:04:11,552 --> 00:04:13,386
you're a foot-dragger.

81
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:22,028
Sweetheart, you and i
are going to spend

82
00:04:22,645 --> 00:04:24,530
a lot of time together.

83
00:04:24,565 --> 00:04:27,033
Indeed, we are.

84
00:04:27,068 --> 00:04:30,153
Indeed, indeed, indeed we are.

85
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:35,792
These are the players,
with or without a scorecard:

86
00:04:35,827 --> 00:04:37,660
In one corner, a machine;

87
00:04:37,695 --> 00:04:41,414
in the other,
one wallace v. Whipple, man.

88
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:43,299
And the game?

89
00:04:43,334 --> 00:04:46,419
It happens to be
the historical battle

90
00:04:46,454 --> 00:04:47,670
between flesh and steel,

91
00:04:47,705 --> 00:04:49,555
between the brain of man

92
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:52,058
and the product of man's brain.

93
00:04:52,093 --> 00:04:54,560
We don't make book on this one,
and predict no winner

94
00:04:54,595 --> 00:04:57,680
but we can tell you that
for this particular contest,

95
00:04:57,715 --> 00:04:59,565
there is standing room only

96
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,434
in the twilight zone.

97
00:05:21,504 --> 00:05:24,007
You know what
your trouble is?

98
00:05:24,042 --> 00:05:26,509
You're holding on tight
to this 19th century.

99
00:05:27,126 --> 00:05:29,629
I'm holding tight
to some principles-

100
00:05:29,664 --> 00:05:33,383
principles that have
to do with firing.

101
00:05:33,418 --> 00:05:36,519
The regret for
the wholesale firings

102
00:05:36,554 --> 00:05:39,639
of men who've worked here
from 20 to 30 years.

103
00:05:39,674 --> 00:05:41,524
Regret, indeed,
it's come to regret?

104
00:05:41,559 --> 00:05:43,393
I'll let you
handle the regrets.

105
00:05:43,428 --> 00:05:45,895
That'll be your
responsibility.

106
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:47,780
Have a sign made
for your desk.

107
00:05:47,815 --> 00:05:49,649
"Mr. Walter hanley,

108
00:05:49,684 --> 00:05:52,151
plant manager
in charge of regrets."

109
00:05:55,905 --> 00:05:57,156
Tell me,
why are you so eager

110
00:05:57,191 --> 00:05:59,659
to replace men
with machines?

111
00:05:59,694 --> 00:06:01,544
Did it ever
occur to you

112
00:06:01,579 --> 00:06:04,047
that you're trading
efficiency for pride?

113
00:06:04,082 --> 00:06:05,298
Pride?

114
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:06,549
Yes, pride!

115
00:06:06,584 --> 00:06:07,800
Craftsmanship.

116
00:06:07,835 --> 00:06:10,553
What a man feels
when he makes something.

117
00:06:10,588 --> 00:06:12,422
What does your
machine feel?

118
00:06:12,457 --> 00:06:13,673
Anything?

119
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:14,424
Anything at all?

120
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:16,309
What the devil
can i do with pride?

121
00:06:16,926 --> 00:06:19,429
Can it, bottle it,
wrap it, produce it?

122
00:06:19,464 --> 00:06:21,931
I'm not selling pride,
i'm selling product.

123
00:06:21,966 --> 00:06:24,434
Your father...
what about
my father?

124
00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:26,319
He ran this plant
for 40 years.

125
00:06:26,354 --> 00:06:27,820
He had an eye
for profit.

126
00:06:27,855 --> 00:06:29,689
He was never
inefficient, but...

127
00:06:29,724 --> 00:06:30,940
but what?

128
00:06:30,975 --> 00:06:32,191
He had something else
on his mind.

129
00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:35,945
What else did my father
have on his mind?

130
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,196
Good will.

131
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:40,950
And the welfare
of the people
who worked for him.

132
00:06:41,584 --> 00:06:42,835
Good will and the welfare
of the people

133
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,087
that worked for him, indeed.

134
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:47,840
In 40 years, my father doubled
the size of his plant

135
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:50,343
while his competitors
quadrupled theirs.

136
00:06:50,378 --> 00:06:54,097
His competitors,
who were less concerned

137
00:06:54,132 --> 00:06:55,965
with the good will
and welfare

138
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,850
of the people
that worked for them.

139
00:06:57,885 --> 00:07:00,970
They paid a fair wage
and got a fair day's work.

140
00:07:01,005 --> 00:07:04,107
But, if they could find
a machine to replace a man

141
00:07:04,142 --> 00:07:05,358
they did it.

142
00:07:05,393 --> 00:07:06,609
But they
didn't have

143
00:07:06,644 --> 00:07:07,860
plant managers
like yourself

144
00:07:07,895 --> 00:07:10,363
who went off
into a crying jag

145
00:07:10,398 --> 00:07:12,231
every time
a pink slip

146
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:14,117
was attached
to a time clock.

147
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:18,488
What's the name
of the plant foreman?

148
00:07:18,523 --> 00:07:20,373
Dickerson, dickerson,
that's his name.

149
00:07:20,408 --> 00:07:21,624
Get him up here for me,
will you?

150
00:07:21,659 --> 00:07:23,376
I'm going
to indulge in

151
00:07:23,411 --> 00:07:26,496
that heartfelt compassion
you hunger for.

152
00:07:26,531 --> 00:07:29,882
I'm going to give him and
his staff four months' notice.

153
00:07:29,917 --> 00:07:32,885
Now, hanley, is that
compassionate or isn't it?

154
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:36,005
Now, go get him, please,
get him up here

155
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,142
hold his hand, dry his eyes,
pat him on the head

156
00:07:39,177 --> 00:07:41,644
but get him up here.

157
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:47,266
So that's about the size
of it, mr. Dickerson,

158
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:48,518
you may tell
the entire day shift

159
00:07:49,152 --> 00:07:51,654
that they'll be pink-slipped
as of the first of july.

160
00:07:51,689 --> 00:07:54,157
We're here to set
it up, mr. Whipple.

161
00:07:54,192 --> 00:07:56,025
Oh, fine, i've checked
the machine over.

162
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,276
Just put it downstairs,
but treat it gently.

163
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:00,413
Handle it with care.

164
00:08:08,538 --> 00:08:11,674
Now, you realize that this
somewhat wholesale discharge

165
00:08:11,709 --> 00:08:13,543
has nothing to do
with dissatisfaction

166
00:08:13,578 --> 00:08:16,045
on your part
or that of the men.

167
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,548
It's merely progress,
mr. Dickerson.

168
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:21,050
Out with the old,
in with the new-
automation.

169
00:08:21,085 --> 00:08:22,301
That'll be all.

170
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:27,306
Yes, mr. Whipple.

171
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:31,694
That will be all.

172
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,823
Did you ever notice,
mr. Hanley,

173
00:08:43,858 --> 00:08:46,959
ever notice how it looks
like it had a face?

174
00:08:46,994 --> 00:08:48,828
An ugly face.

175
00:08:48,863 --> 00:08:51,964
A miserable, ugly face.

176
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:53,833
Whipple, he thinks
it's a machine.

177
00:08:53,868 --> 00:08:56,335
It's not a machine,
it's an enemy.

178
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,221
It's an opponent.

179
00:08:58,256 --> 00:09:04,477
I swear, we've got to hate
a thing like this.

180
00:09:12,602 --> 00:09:14,487
Getting awful late, dick.

181
00:09:14,522 --> 00:09:16,355
Should have closed
half an hour ago.

182
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,858
You know what
these are?

183
00:09:18,893 --> 00:09:20,109
Pair of hands?

184
00:09:20,144 --> 00:09:21,360
Yeah, pair of hands.

185
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:23,863
You know what
else they are?

186
00:09:23,898 --> 00:09:26,365
They're obsolete,
they're off the market.

187
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:32,004
They're like wooden wagons
trying to roll down a freeway.

188
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:37,009
Flesh and bone
and muscle and nerve

189
00:09:37,044 --> 00:09:39,512
but that don't cut
mustard anymore.

190
00:09:40,763 --> 00:09:42,632
I want to tell
you some...

191
00:09:42,667 --> 00:09:47,019
i'm going
to tell you something.

192
00:09:47,054 --> 00:09:50,773
There isn't amachine made

193
00:09:50,808 --> 00:09:52,642
that can beat a man.

194
00:09:52,677 --> 00:09:53,893
Isn't one...

195
00:09:53,928 --> 00:09:55,778
i'll prove it
to you!

196
00:09:57,647 --> 00:10:00,149
I'm going over there right now

197
00:10:00,184 --> 00:10:03,286
and i'm going
to prove it to you.

198
00:10:03,321 --> 00:10:07,039
I'm going to take
that new machine of whipple's

199
00:10:07,074 --> 00:10:08,291
and i'm going to turn it

200
00:10:08,326 --> 00:10:11,410
into nuts and bolts.

201
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:16,415
And if that slob with
the key chain gets in my way

202
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,918
i'm going
to strangle him with it.

203
00:10:33,316 --> 00:10:35,184
Dickerson!

204
00:10:35,219 --> 00:10:36,435
The watchman
called.

205
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,687
He said
you're drunk

206
00:10:37,722 --> 00:10:40,189
and barged right
past him.

207
00:10:40,224 --> 00:10:44,577
And he's right,
mr. Whipple.

208
00:10:44,612 --> 00:10:46,445
Iamdrunk.

209
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:50,833
And i did barge
right in.

210
00:10:50,868 --> 00:10:56,455
I've worked here for 30 years!

211
00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:00,209
And i've been foreman
for 17 of them.

212
00:11:00,244 --> 00:11:04,597
In my book, that gives me
some rights, mr. Whipple.

213
00:11:04,632 --> 00:11:07,350
Well, you've got
the wrong book, dickerson.

214
00:11:07,385 --> 00:11:09,218
You're drunk, disorderly

215
00:11:09,253 --> 00:11:11,103
and trespassing
on private property

216
00:11:11,138 --> 00:11:12,355
and subject to arrest.

217
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:16,726
Tell me something,
mr. Whipple.

218
00:11:16,761 --> 00:11:22,114
When you're dead and buried,
who will mourn for you?

219
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:24,867
Shall i tell you
the difference, mr. Dickerson,

220
00:11:24,902 --> 00:11:26,118
between you and it?

221
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:28,621
That machine costs
two cents an hour for current.

222
00:11:28,656 --> 00:11:29,872
It lasts indefinitely.

223
00:11:29,907 --> 00:11:32,375
It gets no wrinkles,
no arthritis,

224
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:33,626
no hardening of the arteries.

225
00:11:33,661 --> 00:11:36,746
That one machine is a lathe
operator, a press operator.

226
00:11:36,781 --> 00:11:41,133
Two machines replace 114 men

227
00:11:41,168 --> 00:11:43,636
that take no coffee breaks,
no sick leaves,

228
00:11:43,671 --> 00:11:44,887
no vacations with pay.

229
00:11:44,922 --> 00:11:47,390
And that, in my book,

230
00:11:47,425 --> 00:11:51,761
is worth considerably more
than you are.

231
00:11:54,764 --> 00:11:59,769
They should have stopped you
a year ago!

232
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:04,774
Somebody ought to held you down

233
00:12:04,809 --> 00:12:07,910
and put a bit in your head

234
00:12:07,945 --> 00:12:11,030
and poured in some reminders

235
00:12:11,065 --> 00:12:14,784
that men have to eat and work.

236
00:12:14,819 --> 00:12:17,286
And you can't pack them
in cosmoline

237
00:12:17,321 --> 00:12:20,423
like surplus tanks!

238
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:23,542
Or put them out to pasture
like old bulls!

239
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:27,296
I'm a man,
mr. Whipple!

240
00:12:27,331 --> 00:12:30,433
You hear me?
I'm a man!

241
00:12:30,468 --> 00:12:35,438
And that makes me better
than that...

242
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:38,557
hunk of metal, you hear me?!

243
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:39,942
Better!

244
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:47,450
What should i do?

245
00:12:47,485 --> 00:12:48,701
Stop him,
stop him!

246
00:12:49,318 --> 00:12:50,569
He has a crow bar!

247
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:51,454
I don't care!

248
00:12:51,489 --> 00:12:53,706
No, you can't
do that!

249
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:06,585
You see, machine?

250
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:13,476
It... took more than...
you to beat me.

251
00:13:15,344 --> 00:13:19,098
It... it took a man.

252
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:42,004
Oh, hanley, i've
been expecting you.

253
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:43,873
No doubt.

254
00:13:43,908 --> 00:13:47,626
They told me
you were at the hospital.

255
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:49,512
I just came from
the hospital.

256
00:13:49,547 --> 00:13:51,380
Fortunately for you,
mr. Whipple,

257
00:13:51,415 --> 00:13:53,883
dickerson's
going to live.

258
00:13:53,918 --> 00:13:57,019
Fortunately, other than
protecting my property

259
00:13:57,054 --> 00:13:58,888
i have no
involvement in that.

260
00:13:58,923 --> 00:14:00,773
Are the technicians
downstairs?

261
00:14:02,024 --> 00:14:03,893
I asked you a question.

262
00:14:03,928 --> 00:14:06,395
Are the technicians
repairing that machine?

263
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:08,280
It appears so.

264
00:14:08,315 --> 00:14:08,898
Ah, good.

265
00:14:08,933 --> 00:14:12,034
Oh, hanley,
this should interest you.

266
00:14:12,069 --> 00:14:15,154
This is a tape-controlled
seven axis.

267
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:16,405
It's called a sentry.

268
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,290
Know what it does?

269
00:14:18,325 --> 00:14:20,793
It keeps an eye
on every operation

270
00:14:20,828 --> 00:14:22,044
in the entire plant.

271
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,547
It keeps absolutely
accurate data

272
00:14:24,582 --> 00:14:27,666
on man hours, cost
hours, product rejects,

273
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:28,918
just everything!

274
00:14:28,953 --> 00:14:31,420
The most sophisticated
machine i've ever seen.

275
00:14:31,455 --> 00:14:33,923
I just bought it.

276
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:40,429
How many men
doesitreplace?

277
00:14:40,464 --> 00:14:41,680
This should
please you-

278
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:44,183
only one,
just one!

279
00:14:44,218 --> 00:14:47,937
As a matter of fact,
it replaces you.

280
00:14:50,439 --> 00:14:53,576
That's only
right, mr. Whipple,

281
00:14:53,611 --> 00:14:56,078
since the point
of my coming today

282
00:14:56,113 --> 00:14:57,947
was to give you
my notice.

283
00:14:57,982 --> 00:14:59,198
Oh, good,
good.

284
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:01,700
I suspected
as much.

285
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:03,586
You're a
sensible man

286
00:15:03,621 --> 00:15:06,705
and i'm sure you know
that an industrial team

287
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:10,459
has to be a
compatible team.

288
00:15:10,494 --> 00:15:12,962
And when two men rub
each other the wrong way,

289
00:15:12,997 --> 00:15:14,847
well, it's unrealistic
and impractical

290
00:15:14,882 --> 00:15:16,715
that they try to stay
on the same team.

291
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,852
In spite of the fact you
think i'm kind of an ogre,

292
00:15:19,887 --> 00:15:21,720
some sort of a
heartless scrooge,

293
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:24,223
i'm not going to
forget the many years

294
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:26,108
of hard work you put in
for me and my father.

295
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:29,862
I'm going to see that you get an
extremely liberal severance pay

296
00:15:29,897 --> 00:15:31,113
and what i'm sure
you'll agree

297
00:15:31,148 --> 00:15:32,982
is a far better
than average pension.

298
00:15:33,616 --> 00:15:35,484
That's very generous
of you.

299
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,987
There's something
i'd like to give you,

300
00:15:38,022 --> 00:15:38,621
if you don't mind.

301
00:15:38,656 --> 00:15:39,872
No, what is that?

302
00:15:40,489 --> 00:15:43,626
That's for you
from me.

303
00:15:43,661 --> 00:15:46,745
For your lack of
sensitivity, compassion.

304
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,248
Your heartless manipulation
of men and metals.

305
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:51,133
You can take
my severance pay,

306
00:15:51,168 --> 00:15:53,636
my pension, and
your good-bye speeches

307
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:55,504
and feed them
into your machine.

308
00:15:55,539 --> 00:15:57,756
Because when i walk away
from you,

309
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,008
i walk awayclean.

310
00:15:59,043 --> 00:16:02,144
And that, mr. Whipple,
is one hell of a trick!

311
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:10,019
A new watchman device.

312
00:16:10,054 --> 00:16:11,020
Take out your i.d. Card

313
00:16:11,055 --> 00:16:12,905
and hold it
in front of the door.

314
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,773
There are built-in
electric eyes.

315
00:16:46,055 --> 00:16:47,556
Yes,
mr. Whipple?

316
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:50,693
Oh, run a control
check, please.

317
00:16:50,728 --> 00:16:53,195
I already have,
two hours ago.

318
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:54,446
I did it right
after lunch, too.

319
00:16:54,481 --> 00:16:55,698
And if you
recall, sir,

320
00:16:55,733 --> 00:16:58,200
i did it this
morning, as well.

321
00:16:58,235 --> 00:17:00,703
Ever heard
of preventative
maintenance?

322
00:17:00,738 --> 00:17:01,954
It's my job,
mr. Whipple.

323
00:17:01,989 --> 00:17:05,074
What you're asking of
me isn't maintenance.

324
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:06,959
It's not
preventing a thing.

325
00:17:06,994 --> 00:17:08,577
Oh, indeed, and i suppose

326
00:17:08,612 --> 00:17:10,462
you know what's needed in this
plant and what isn't needed.

327
00:17:10,497 --> 00:17:12,715
I know that running
equipment checks

328
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,583
ten times a day
is a waste of time,

329
00:17:14,618 --> 00:17:15,834
a waste of effort,

330
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:17,720
and it's becoming
an idiotic ritual around here.

331
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:20,339
Young man, your presence is

332
00:17:20,374 --> 00:17:22,224
a necessity of the moment.

333
00:17:22,259 --> 00:17:24,093
Notice i stress "of the moment."

334
00:17:24,128 --> 00:17:25,728
Uh, a case in point.

335
00:17:25,763 --> 00:17:26,979
Case in point.

336
00:17:27,014 --> 00:17:28,847
Now, stay here,
observe this.

337
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:35,104
Dear sir

338
00:17:35,139 --> 00:17:37,606
yours of the 14th
received and acknowledged.

339
00:17:37,641 --> 00:17:40,109
Now is the time
for all good men

340
00:17:40,144 --> 00:17:41,360
to come to the aid
of their country

341
00:17:41,395 --> 00:17:43,245
etc., etc., etc., etc.

342
00:17:52,621 --> 00:17:53,872
A perfect letter.

343
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:56,375
Not one error
or erasure.

344
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:57,626
Typed at conception.

345
00:17:57,661 --> 00:17:58,877
Am i getting through,
young man?

346
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:01,380
You mean secretaries
are obsolete now.

347
00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:03,766
Precisely, obsolete.

348
00:18:03,801 --> 00:18:05,017
And do you know
what else it means?

349
00:18:05,052 --> 00:18:08,137
It means no more powder rooms,
no more coffee breaks.

350
00:18:08,172 --> 00:18:10,022
No more work stoppages

351
00:18:10,057 --> 00:18:11,890
due to sundry inconveniences

352
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:13,776
such as maternity and all that.

353
00:18:13,811 --> 00:18:17,146
Inconveniences like maternity?

354
00:18:17,181 --> 00:18:19,031
You'll have
to forgive me, mr. Whipple.

355
00:18:19,066 --> 00:18:20,899
But if we keep this up

356
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:22,151
we'll have wonderful products

357
00:18:22,186 --> 00:18:23,402
but mighty few people
to buy them.

358
00:18:23,437 --> 00:18:26,538
Happily that is not my concern.

359
00:18:26,573 --> 00:18:29,658
Providing efficiency-
that is my only concern.

360
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:35,414
Mr. Whipple?

361
00:18:35,449 --> 00:18:37,049
Have you looked

362
00:18:37,084 --> 00:18:38,300
around this place,
lately?

363
00:18:38,335 --> 00:18:39,551
Looked around?

364
00:18:39,586 --> 00:18:41,804
The cafeteria, for example.

365
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:43,055
It's like a cave.

366
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:44,923
Not a soul in there.

367
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,809
Just a few vending machines

368
00:18:46,844 --> 00:18:49,311
and music through
a loudspeaker.

369
00:18:49,346 --> 00:18:51,313
Have you seen
the parking lot?

370
00:18:51,348 --> 00:18:51,930
It's a desert.

371
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:54,433
No cars, no people.

372
00:18:54,468 --> 00:18:56,185
How very enlightening.

373
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,070
This place has
everything now

374
00:18:58,105 --> 00:18:58,687
for efficiency.

375
00:18:58,722 --> 00:19:00,572
Do you know
what it lacks?

376
00:19:00,607 --> 00:19:01,190
No, tell me.

377
00:19:01,225 --> 00:19:02,441
Voices.

378
00:19:02,476 --> 00:19:03,692
Laughter.

379
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:06,195
Whatever makes people
feel for people.

380
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:08,697
That's what it lacks.

381
00:19:08,732 --> 00:19:10,582
This is a lousy
place to work.

382
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:13,085
Then i'll spare you
further suffering.

383
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,336
You're discharged.

384
00:19:14,371 --> 00:19:16,205
I've been expecting that.

385
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,090
Actually, i've been wanting it.

386
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:19,958
I can't work here anymore.

387
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:21,844
It's too darn lonely.

388
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:29,351
And another thing, mr. Whipple,

389
00:19:29,386 --> 00:19:31,603
to do with
equipment checks

390
00:19:31,638 --> 00:19:32,855
and preventative
maintenance?

391
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:35,724
It might be a
good idea if you ran

392
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:38,227
an equipment
check on yourself!

393
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:47,619
Equipment check on myself!

394
00:19:47,654 --> 00:19:48,871
What insufferable rot!

395
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:51,373
Equipment check on myself!

396
00:19:55,744 --> 00:19:58,247
Did it occur to you

397
00:19:58,282 --> 00:20:00,632
that you're trading efficiency
for pride?

398
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:04,002
When you're dead and buried

399
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:07,389
who will mourn for you?

400
00:20:07,424 --> 00:20:10,893
I think it might be a good idea

401
00:20:10,928 --> 00:20:13,645
if you ran an equipment check...
on yourself!

402
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:24,022
Did it occur to you that you're
trading efficiency for pride?

403
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:29,027
When you're dead and buried
who will mourn for you?

404
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:31,530
I think it might be a good idea

405
00:20:31,565 --> 00:20:34,666
if you ran an equipment check...
on yourself!

406
00:20:34,701 --> 00:20:36,168
I think it might be a good idea

407
00:20:36,203 --> 00:20:38,036
if you ran an equipment check...
on yourself!

408
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:40,539
Did it occur to you that you're
trading efficiency for pride?

409
00:20:40,574 --> 00:20:43,675
When you're dead and buried
who will mourn for you?

410
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:26,835
What'll it be
mr. Whipple?

411
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:28,086
Beer, please.

412
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:43,101
To other days,
mr. Hanley.

413
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:45,604
And to other toasts.

414
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:48,106
I'll drink to that,
mr. Whipple.

415
00:21:53,862 --> 00:21:56,365
How are you finding retirement?

416
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,501
Oh, tolerable,
mr. Whipple, tolerable.

417
00:21:59,536 --> 00:22:02,004
I manage to...
i manage to keep busy

418
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:04,506
not as much as i'd like...

419
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:08,877
my wife says i'm underfoot,
but i do all right.

420
00:22:08,912 --> 00:22:12,631
But you know, it's kind of nice
to sleep late in the mornings.

421
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:18,887
It's important.
Uh... this retirement, i mean.

422
00:22:18,922 --> 00:22:20,772
Very important.

423
00:22:20,807 --> 00:22:24,526
A man should have time
for leisure when he grows older.

424
00:22:24,561 --> 00:22:28,897
It's important
he have time for leisure.

425
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:31,033
That's so, mr. Whipple.

426
00:22:32,901 --> 00:22:36,655
You know, when the
board of directors

427
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:38,540
first indicated to me

428
00:22:38,575 --> 00:22:40,409
that they thought i was
somewhat overtired,

429
00:22:40,444 --> 00:22:43,545
should relinquish some
of my responsibilities,

430
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:46,665
well, if the truth
were known, mr. Hanley,

431
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,167
i did feel some sort
of antipathy for them,

432
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:51,670
but, uh, they were right.

433
00:22:51,705 --> 00:22:54,172
They were quite
right, you know.

434
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:57,309
But with the perspective
of time,

435
00:22:57,344 --> 00:23:00,429
i realized they'd moved me
out of there.

436
00:23:00,464 --> 00:23:04,816
I'm not married, you know,

437
00:23:04,851 --> 00:23:07,319
and things get a little dull.

438
00:23:07,354 --> 00:23:11,073
Well, no, not, not dull, really.

439
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:12,324
I, uh, i manage
to keep myself busy

440
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:13,575
but there are times

441
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:16,695
when i wish... when i...

442
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:19,831
it's not right, hanley.

443
00:23:19,866 --> 00:23:21,083
It's-it's not right.

444
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,585
Cold, dispassionate,
impersonal...

445
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:26,705
they-they chuck a man out
right in his prime.

446
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:30,459
Chuck him out
like he was some kind of a part.

447
00:23:30,494 --> 00:23:32,961
Said i was neurotic
about things.

448
00:23:32,996 --> 00:23:35,464
Said that being alone

449
00:23:35,499 --> 00:23:36,715
with the machines
had warped me.

450
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:39,217
That was the expression
they used- "warped."

451
00:23:39,252 --> 00:23:41,103
It's not fair, hanley.

452
00:23:41,138 --> 00:23:42,354
It's not fair.

453
00:23:42,389 --> 00:23:43,605
A man has value.

454
00:23:44,222 --> 00:23:46,108
A man has worth.

455
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:52,731
They just snap their fingers,
and they bring in a replacement.

456
00:23:52,766 --> 00:23:54,616
They just bring in
a replacement.

457
00:23:54,651 --> 00:23:56,485
It, it isn't fair, hanley.

458
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:00,238
It, it isn't fair,
the way they diminish us.

459
00:24:00,273 --> 00:24:02,741
There are many bromides
applicable here-

460
00:24:02,776 --> 00:24:03,992
too much of a good thing,

461
00:24:04,027 --> 00:24:05,243
tiger by the tail,

462
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:08,380
as you sow, so shall ye reap.

463
00:24:08,415 --> 00:24:09,631
The point is that too often

464
00:24:09,666 --> 00:24:12,134
man becomes clever
instead of becoming wise,

465
00:24:12,169 --> 00:24:15,137
he becomes inventive,
but not thoughtful.

466
00:24:15,172 --> 00:24:17,639
And sometimes, as in the case
of mr. Whipple,

467
00:24:17,674 --> 00:24:20,142
he can create himself
right out of existence.

468
00:24:20,177 --> 00:24:22,644
Tonight's tale of oddness
and obsolescence

469
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:25,147
from the twilight zone.

470
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,402
And now, mr. Serling.

471
00:24:30,437 --> 00:24:32,270
Onthe twilight zonenext trip,

472
00:24:32,305 --> 00:24:35,407
we move into the area
of authentic folk singing.

473
00:24:35,442 --> 00:24:36,658
But this is folk singing

474
00:24:36,693 --> 00:24:38,527
like you've probably
never heard before.

475
00:24:38,562 --> 00:24:41,663
The words and the music
in this item are haunting indeed

476
00:24:41,698 --> 00:24:44,166
and this one provides
one of the more odd excursions

477
00:24:44,201 --> 00:24:46,034
into the places of shadow.

478
00:24:46,069 --> 00:24:47,285
Gary crosby and bonnie beecher

479
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,788
star in a most unusual tale
by anthony wilson.

480
00:24:49,823 --> 00:24:52,924
It's called
"come wander with me."
