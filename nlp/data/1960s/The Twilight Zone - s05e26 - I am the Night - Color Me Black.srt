1
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:10,694
You unlock this door
with the key of imagination.

2
00:00:10,729 --> 00:00:13,063
Beyond it is another dimension-

3
00:00:13,098 --> 00:00:14,314
a dimension of sound,

4
00:00:16,234 --> 00:00:17,450
a dimension of sight,

5
00:00:17,485 --> 00:00:19,319
a dimension of mind.

6
00:00:19,354 --> 00:00:23,073
You're moving into a land
of both shadow and substance,

7
00:00:23,108 --> 00:00:24,324
of things and ideas.

8
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:27,460
You've just crossed over
into the twilight zone.

9
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,093
Charlie?

10
00:00:43,128 --> 00:00:46,229
Go back to sleep,
ella, it's early.

11
00:00:46,264 --> 00:00:48,098
What time is it?

12
00:00:48,133 --> 00:00:49,349
My watch stopped.

13
00:00:49,384 --> 00:00:50,600
It's pitch black out.

14
00:00:50,635 --> 00:00:53,737
It must be 3:00 or
4:00 in the morning.

15
00:00:53,772 --> 00:00:55,605
Look how black
it is out there.

16
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,108
It's the middle
of the night.

17
00:00:58,143 --> 00:01:01,244
Oh, i think you're
crazy to get up now.

18
00:01:01,279 --> 00:01:02,495
What's so special

19
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:04,364
about hanging
a little...

20
00:01:04,399 --> 00:01:06,866
go back
to sleep, ella!

21
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:08,752
Well, why don't you?

22
00:01:08,787 --> 00:01:11,254
You'll have all
that excitement today.

23
00:01:11,289 --> 00:01:13,757
You're the one
that needs the sleep.

24
00:01:13,792 --> 00:01:16,876
Bring us breakfast
over about 8:30.

25
00:01:18,762 --> 00:01:21,264
What time they string him up?

26
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:25,635
Well, you know what i mean.

27
00:01:26,269 --> 00:01:27,520
What time does he get hung?

28
00:01:27,555 --> 00:01:30,640
He get'sexecutedat 9:30.

29
00:01:30,675 --> 00:01:32,275
And i hope
the whole town

30
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,526
doesn't turn out.

31
00:01:33,561 --> 00:01:36,029
When i see a bunch of
cold-blooded gawkers

32
00:01:36,064 --> 00:01:38,531
getting their jollies
from seeing a man die,

33
00:01:38,566 --> 00:01:39,783
i just...

34
00:01:41,651 --> 00:01:45,405
just bring us breakfast
over at 8:30.

35
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,290
Oh, charlie?

36
00:01:47,325 --> 00:01:49,292
How does he like his eggs?

37
00:01:49,327 --> 00:01:50,293
Edible.

38
00:01:50,328 --> 00:01:52,796
They're the last ones
he's going to eat

39
00:01:52,831 --> 00:01:54,047
so make them edible.

40
00:02:11,314 --> 00:02:12,432
I don't get it.

41
00:02:13,683 --> 00:02:15,568
What don't you get, deputy?

42
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:19,939
Sheriff, it's 7:30
in the morning,

43
00:02:19,974 --> 00:02:21,825
and it's pitch
black outside.

44
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,944
I've never seen
it any blacker,

45
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:27,447
but it's 7:30
in the morning.

46
00:02:27,482 --> 00:02:29,332
Now, what's
going on?

47
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,969
I don't know, deputy.

48
00:02:50,004 --> 00:02:54,357
It's 7:30 in the morning
and it's pitch black outside.

49
00:02:54,392 --> 00:02:57,477
To tell you the truth...

50
00:02:57,512 --> 00:02:59,362
i don't know why.

51
00:02:59,397 --> 00:03:01,865
I don't know why at all.

52
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,367
Sheriff charlie koch

53
00:03:04,402 --> 00:03:06,870
on the morning of an execution.

54
00:03:06,905 --> 00:03:10,623
As a matter of fact,
it's 7:30 in the morning.

55
00:03:10,658 --> 00:03:13,743
Logic and natural laws dictate
that at this hour

56
00:03:13,778 --> 00:03:14,994
there should be daylight.

57
00:03:15,029 --> 00:03:17,497
It is a simple rule
of physical science

58
00:03:17,532 --> 00:03:20,633
that the sun should rise
at a certain moment

59
00:03:20,668 --> 00:03:21,885
and supersede the darkness.

60
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,004
But at this given moment
sheriff charlie koch,

61
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:28,141
a deputy named pierce,
a condemned man named jagger,

62
00:03:28,176 --> 00:03:30,643
and a small,
inconsequential village

63
00:03:30,678 --> 00:03:33,763
will shortly find out that
there are causes and effects

64
00:03:33,798 --> 00:03:35,648
that have no precedent.

65
00:03:35,683 --> 00:03:38,768
Such is usually the case
in the twilight zone.

66
00:04:02,258 --> 00:04:02,875
How about that?

67
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:04,761
You see it
outside?

68
00:04:04,796 --> 00:04:06,629
You better
run an extra

69
00:04:06,664 --> 00:04:08,514
in that paper
of yours.

70
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:10,383
I've been answering
the phone

71
00:04:10,418 --> 00:04:12,268
since 6:00 this morning.

72
00:04:12,303 --> 00:04:16,022
One fellow called, said the
electricity had gone off-

73
00:04:16,057 --> 00:04:17,890
it was tomorrow night.

74
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:19,776
Another godly woman,

75
00:04:19,811 --> 00:04:24,147
who professes to read her good
book with admirable regularity,

76
00:04:24,182 --> 00:04:26,032
tells me it's
the end of the world

77
00:04:26,067 --> 00:04:30,403
and she can quote the chapter
and verse to support her thesis.

78
00:04:30,438 --> 00:04:32,905
Now, you're well-versed
in all things

79
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,408
regarding law and
order, sheriff koch.

80
00:04:35,443 --> 00:04:37,293
What's your thesis?

81
00:04:37,328 --> 00:04:38,544
It's quarter to 8:00.

82
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:40,413
It's quarter to
8:00 in the morning

83
00:04:40,448 --> 00:04:42,298
and it doesn't make
any sense.

84
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:44,801
Daylight should have
come two hours ago.

85
00:04:44,836 --> 00:04:46,669
Well, in between
reassuring people

86
00:04:46,704 --> 00:04:49,172
that this was not
an interplanetary
invasion,

87
00:04:49,207 --> 00:04:51,057
nor the end
of the world,

88
00:04:51,092 --> 00:04:53,559
i placed a call to
the state capital.

89
00:04:53,594 --> 00:04:55,428
Is it black there?

90
00:04:55,463 --> 00:04:57,313
It appears that
across the face

91
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,182
of the entire earth

92
00:04:59,217 --> 00:05:01,684
we are the only ones
groping in darkness.

93
00:05:01,719 --> 00:05:03,569
So it seems
the phenomenon

94
00:05:03,604 --> 00:05:05,438
is quite localized

95
00:05:05,473 --> 00:05:08,574
and we'll just have
to seek elsewhere

96
00:05:08,609 --> 00:05:11,694
for company to
share our misery.

97
00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:13,579
Have you seen
jagger this morning?

98
00:05:13,614 --> 00:05:14,831
I seen him.

99
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:17,950
I brought him in
a cup of coffee.

100
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:21,087
I also reminded him
about what day it was.

101
00:05:22,338 --> 00:05:24,207
I'll bet you did.

102
00:05:24,841 --> 00:05:27,960
How did you
occupy yourself
as a lad, deputy?

103
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:29,846
Torturing
small animals

104
00:05:29,881 --> 00:05:31,714
or just pulling
wings off flies?

105
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:34,217
What do you mean
by that, mr. Colbey?

106
00:05:34,252 --> 00:05:36,102
Nothing.

107
00:05:36,137 --> 00:05:37,970
Nothing at all.

108
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:40,473
Can i talk to jagger?

109
00:05:40,508 --> 00:05:42,358
Go right on in.

110
00:05:42,393 --> 00:05:44,227
As a point of
interest, sheriff,

111
00:05:44,861 --> 00:05:46,729
is jagger innocent?

112
00:05:46,764 --> 00:05:49,866
Mr. Colbey, that is a matter for
a jury, public opinion and god,

113
00:05:49,901 --> 00:05:52,368
and that, thank the lord,
has nothing to do with me.

114
00:05:52,403 --> 00:05:56,122
So let us all praise god
for the morning's impartiality.

115
00:05:56,157 --> 00:05:59,876
And for justice being served
deluxe style.

116
00:05:59,911 --> 00:06:01,744
Deputy...

117
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:04,247
why don't you shut your mouth.

118
00:06:04,282 --> 00:06:06,132
I got a right to an opinion.

119
00:06:06,167 --> 00:06:08,251
Indeed you have,
deputy.

120
00:06:08,286 --> 00:06:09,502
Indeed you have.

121
00:06:09,537 --> 00:06:13,256
But there's just a few
disturbing facets

122
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:14,507
about this case.

123
00:06:14,542 --> 00:06:15,758
One...

124
00:06:15,793 --> 00:06:18,644
the murdered man
was not a decent man.

125
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:21,764
He was a cross-burning,
psychopathic bully

126
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:23,649
who attacked the man in there.

127
00:06:23,684 --> 00:06:26,769
And two, deputy pierce here
saw it happen

128
00:06:26,804 --> 00:06:28,654
and then perjured himself.

129
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:31,157
Now, wait a minute!

130
00:06:31,192 --> 00:06:33,659
Perjured
is the word, deputy.

131
00:06:33,694 --> 00:06:36,162
Now, you said
jagger shot him

132
00:06:36,197 --> 00:06:38,030
from across the room.

133
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:39,916
No such thing.

134
00:06:45,421 --> 00:06:47,924
The murdered man had
powder burns all over him.

135
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:50,426
This might not have
proven self-defense

136
00:06:50,461 --> 00:06:53,546
but it would've pointed
to it and maybe helped it.

137
00:06:53,581 --> 00:06:56,682
And you, sheriff koch,
you saw the body.

138
00:06:56,717 --> 00:06:58,551
But i didn't hear
any comments

139
00:06:58,586 --> 00:06:59,802
on those
powder burns

140
00:06:59,837 --> 00:07:01,053
when you gave
your testimony.

141
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:05,441
And your courageous editor here
in covering the trial

142
00:07:05,476 --> 00:07:09,195
didn't see fit to include
this insignificant addendum

143
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:13,566
though he also knew at the time
he was being very selective

144
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:18,571
about what truths he was writing
about, what truths he wasn't.

145
00:07:18,606 --> 00:07:19,822
You're right, deputy.

146
00:07:19,857 --> 00:07:21,707
Justice is
being served...

147
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:24,827
on a platter with
its tongue cut out

148
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:27,964
just like the carcass
of any dead animal.

149
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:40,476
Let me know when
you're ready.

150
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:46,098
It's pitch black
outside.

151
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:48,601
Almost 8:00
in the morning.

152
00:07:48,636 --> 00:07:50,486
Not a speck
of daylight.

153
00:07:50,521 --> 00:07:52,989
This place doesn't
have any windows

154
00:07:53,024 --> 00:07:54,857
so it could
be christmas eve

155
00:07:54,892 --> 00:07:56,108
or the fourth of july

156
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:58,611
and i would not know
the difference.

157
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:02,365
You got any religious
affiliation, jagger?

158
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,616
None.

159
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,118
Anyone you want to see?

160
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:07,370
Nobody.

161
00:08:08,004 --> 00:08:09,255
Anything to say?

162
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:14,260
Nothing.

163
00:08:14,295 --> 00:08:16,762
No priest, no friends,
no comment.

164
00:08:16,797 --> 00:08:19,265
Just what have
you got, jagger?

165
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,133
I got the blues, mr. Colbey!

166
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:22,385
I got the blues.

167
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,887
I'm just about
an hour away
from a hanging

168
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:26,772
and i've been lying there

169
00:08:26,807 --> 00:08:28,274
and i have been thinking
that i would like

170
00:08:28,309 --> 00:08:31,394
to rip these bars apart
and get out of here.

171
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,781
Or i'd like to save everybody
else the trouble

172
00:08:35,816 --> 00:08:37,650
and hang myself right here.

173
00:08:39,535 --> 00:08:43,289
But, you see, i don't have
the strength for one

174
00:08:43,324 --> 00:08:45,157
or the guts for the other

175
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:49,545
so i'm just lying there,
and i am just waiting.

176
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:52,915
Well, in that case, would you
care to make a statement

177
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,166
about guilt or innocence?

178
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:57,920
Guilt or innocence, and you
want me to make a statement?

179
00:08:57,955 --> 00:08:59,171
I'd appreciate
one.

180
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:02,308
I don't think anybody
should leave this earth

181
00:09:02,343 --> 00:09:04,810
without making a comment-
you, me, anybody.

182
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:07,930
Well, that's a
reasonable request, mr. Colbey.

183
00:09:07,965 --> 00:09:11,067
Considering the fact that you're
not leaving this morning

184
00:09:11,102 --> 00:09:12,935
that's
reasonable.

185
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:16,072
I'm guilty, mr. Colbey.

186
00:09:16,107 --> 00:09:19,191
That take you off the hook?

187
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:21,694
And that's supposed
to mean what?

188
00:09:21,729 --> 00:09:23,446
That's supposed
to mean

189
00:09:23,481 --> 00:09:25,331
you're on the
popular side.

190
00:09:25,366 --> 00:09:27,199
There are good guys
and bad guys-

191
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:28,451
that's human nature.

192
00:09:28,486 --> 00:09:30,953
Well, i'm worse
than a bad guy.

193
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:32,955
I'm a town kook, i'm a neurotic.

194
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:35,458
I'm the one with the causes
and the banners.

195
00:09:35,493 --> 00:09:37,343
I'm the village idiot
who tries to be

196
00:09:37,378 --> 00:09:39,211
his brother's
keeper.

197
00:09:49,105 --> 00:09:50,973
Do you understand,
mr. Colbey?

198
00:09:51,008 --> 00:09:54,360
The man i killed
was the white knight.

199
00:09:54,395 --> 00:09:56,862
He did what
his other pals
in this town

200
00:09:56,897 --> 00:09:59,365
wanted to do and
didn't have the guts.

201
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,485
Hewas the cross burner,
the bomb thrower.

202
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:06,872
Hehandled the whipping of
some poor, scared colored guy.

203
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:10,242
Oh...

204
00:10:12,128 --> 00:10:13,379
the man you killed
was no saint

205
00:10:13,414 --> 00:10:15,881
but we don't dispense
life or death

206
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:17,750
just because somebody
offends us.

207
00:10:17,785 --> 00:10:20,252
That's the distinction
between men and animals.

208
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,505
Well, that's very well said.

209
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:25,007
That's very well said,
mr. Colbey.

210
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:26,258
You tell that
to the man

211
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:28,144
who's going to
fix my rope.

212
00:10:28,179 --> 00:10:30,646
You tell it to the sheriff
and his deputy

213
00:10:30,681 --> 00:10:33,766
to the townspeople
who are going to stand around

214
00:10:33,801 --> 00:10:36,902
and watch my eyes bulge out
and enjoy my agony.

215
00:10:36,937 --> 00:10:38,154
You tell them.

216
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:41,907
You tell them about
the difference

217
00:10:41,942 --> 00:10:43,159
between men
and animals.

218
00:10:43,194 --> 00:10:45,661
But you better be ready
to draw pictures

219
00:10:45,696 --> 00:10:48,164
because this language
they just don't dig!

220
00:11:21,599 --> 00:11:22,815
9:00 in the morning.

221
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:24,700
Why is it so dark?

222
00:11:24,735 --> 00:11:26,569
Is it
an eclipse?

223
00:11:26,604 --> 00:11:28,454
Can't be.

224
00:11:28,489 --> 00:11:30,322
I'm listening
to the radio.

225
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:31,574
Ain't no eclipse.

226
00:11:31,609 --> 00:11:32,825
It's weird.

227
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,710
It's just
plain weird.

228
00:11:34,745 --> 00:11:37,830
But scientists can offer
no explanation

229
00:11:37,865 --> 00:11:40,332
for the strange phenomenon
of darkness

230
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,835
that has suddenly
and inexplicably

231
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:45,337
covered the remote
little midwestern village.

232
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:48,090
It is now 9:00 a.m.
Eastern standard time

233
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:51,227
but last reports indicate
the darkness there is total.

234
00:11:51,262 --> 00:11:54,346
There is no remote hint
of any kind of daylight.

235
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:59,351
Looks pretty good.

236
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:03,105
That ought to
tend to him.

237
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:08,110
But who's going to tend to us?

238
00:12:10,613 --> 00:12:14,366
Who or what is going
to tend to us?

239
00:12:29,265 --> 00:12:31,884
Ten more minutes.

240
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:33,769
You, uh,
going to go through

241
00:12:33,804 --> 00:12:35,020
with this, sheriff?

242
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:36,889
Why not?

243
00:12:36,924 --> 00:12:40,643
The law says may 25,
at 9:30 in the morning.

244
00:12:40,678 --> 00:12:41,894
Well, it's may 25,

245
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:45,030
and it'll be 9:30
in the morning.

246
00:12:45,065 --> 00:12:47,283
Quite apart from
the fact, mr. Pierce,

247
00:12:47,318 --> 00:12:49,785
that you're not the
most sensitive of men,

248
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,654
did it ever occur to you

249
00:12:51,689 --> 00:12:53,539
there's something
odd going on here

250
00:12:54,156 --> 00:12:56,659
and we better dispense
with business as usual

251
00:12:56,694 --> 00:12:59,795
until we find out
exactly what is going on?

252
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:01,046
You know something?

253
00:13:01,081 --> 00:13:04,166
I take an awful lot
of dirt from you.

254
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:06,669
And just who
are you, anyway?

255
00:13:07,303 --> 00:13:09,805
A little-shot editor of
a crummy little paper.

256
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,308
That's right,
a crummy little paper

257
00:13:12,343 --> 00:13:14,810
that crawls along on
its hands and knees

258
00:13:14,845 --> 00:13:16,679
from one edition
to the other.

259
00:13:16,714 --> 00:13:19,815
You got more creditors
than you got readers.

260
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:21,066
That'll do
it, pierce.

261
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:22,935
No, that won't do it
by a long shot!

262
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:25,571
Now, maybe you
feel like turning

263
00:13:25,606 --> 00:13:26,822
your cheek
to this crumb

264
00:13:26,857 --> 00:13:28,691
but there ain't
no rule book

265
00:13:28,726 --> 00:13:29,942
that says i got to.

266
00:13:29,977 --> 00:13:32,328
He says
i perjured myself;

267
00:13:32,363 --> 00:13:34,196
says i lied.

268
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:36,582
He wasn't
throwing no bouquets

269
00:13:36,617 --> 00:13:37,199
at you, neither.

270
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:39,084
Maybe i don't deserve any.

271
00:13:40,336 --> 00:13:42,838
You were right, you know.

272
00:13:42,873 --> 00:13:45,341
I saw the victim.

273
00:13:45,376 --> 00:13:47,843
He did have powder burns.

274
00:13:47,878 --> 00:13:50,963
But when a committee
of townspeople came to me

275
00:13:50,998 --> 00:13:52,848
and said there'd be no autopsy,

276
00:13:52,883 --> 00:13:55,351
i just bent my head
and i nodded.

277
00:13:56,969 --> 00:14:00,606
We all got little axes
to grind, don't we?

278
00:14:00,641 --> 00:14:03,726
I want to be reelected
sheriff.

279
00:14:03,761 --> 00:14:05,861
You want to keep
selling newspapers.

280
00:14:05,896 --> 00:14:08,614
And deputy pierce here...

281
00:14:08,649 --> 00:14:10,866
he likes to feel
important;

282
00:14:10,901 --> 00:14:12,735
he likes
to be popular,

283
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:15,871
likes to stay on
the good side of people.

284
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:21,493
Here we are, gentlemen,
treading water in a sewer.

285
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:23,245
I don't take it
from him

286
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,130
and i don't take it
from you!

287
00:14:25,165 --> 00:14:27,383
You better unravel it, pierce,

288
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,136
or i'll spread you
all over this yard.

289
00:14:41,897 --> 00:14:44,900
Let's go get
the prisoner.

290
00:14:51,774 --> 00:14:53,659
At last, mr. Pierce.

291
00:14:53,694 --> 00:14:56,779
A labor of love, huh?

292
00:15:19,802 --> 00:15:21,687
Do you suppose, reverend,

293
00:15:21,722 --> 00:15:24,807
there might be some
theological explanation?

294
00:15:24,842 --> 00:15:27,309
Theological explanation?

295
00:15:27,344 --> 00:15:30,446
For the death, or the darkness,
or both.

296
00:15:30,481 --> 00:15:32,564
You know, reverend,

297
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:35,451
maybe if we thought
it was some divine act,

298
00:15:35,486 --> 00:15:37,953
we could sort of live with it.

299
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:52,835
This is not the first gallows,
reverend, nor the last.

300
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:59,224
Or he won't be the first
unhappy man died an early age.

301
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:03,595
We won't be the last mourners
on earth either.

302
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:04,847
Did you see him?

303
00:16:04,882 --> 00:16:06,732
Did you get to talk to him?

304
00:16:06,767 --> 00:16:09,852
Briefly.

305
00:16:09,887 --> 00:16:11,737
He wouldn't see me.

306
00:16:11,772 --> 00:16:13,605
Wouldn't even let me inside.

307
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,108
It's a pity.

308
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:19,244
He's a very lonely man.

309
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:24,249
But he won't be lonely
very long.

310
00:16:38,514 --> 00:16:41,016
He's got a few
minutes, hasn't he?

311
00:16:41,051 --> 00:16:42,267
He used them up already.

312
00:16:42,302 --> 00:16:43,519
We're four minutes behind.

313
00:16:43,554 --> 00:16:45,387
You can talk to
him, reverend.

314
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:46,638
Take
your time.

315
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:49,141
It'smytime.

316
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:51,026
I got nothing
to say.

317
00:16:51,061 --> 00:16:52,277
Then let's go.

318
00:16:52,312 --> 00:16:53,529
Let's get on
with it!

319
00:16:53,564 --> 00:16:55,397
Yeah!

320
00:16:55,432 --> 00:16:56,648
You don't want
to waste

321
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:57,900
your last minutes,
jagger.

322
00:16:57,935 --> 00:17:01,653
Now, you and i are
a different faith,

323
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:04,790
and obviously
a different color,

324
00:17:04,825 --> 00:17:08,544
but you stood up
for me and mine.

325
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:09,161
You spoke for us,

326
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:11,663
and god help us,
you killed for us.

327
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:13,298
And i feel
you deserve

328
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,167
some measure
of peace.

329
00:17:16,051 --> 00:17:17,920
I want to give you some.

330
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:21,173
That'll give me some peace.

331
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,058
I don't need
any words, reverend.

332
00:17:23,093 --> 00:17:25,561
No quotations in or out
of the bible.

333
00:17:25,596 --> 00:17:28,063
Come on, let's get it
over with!

334
00:17:28,098 --> 00:17:29,932
Yeah!

335
00:17:29,967 --> 00:17:32,434
Patience!

336
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:34,937
I promise you,
i will please you all,

337
00:17:34,972 --> 00:17:36,188
believe me.

338
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:38,941
I'll choke and suffer and dance.

339
00:17:38,976 --> 00:17:41,193
Oh, you'll get
your money's worth.

340
00:17:41,228 --> 00:17:41,827
Believe me.

341
00:17:45,616 --> 00:17:46,832
Quiet!
But i tell you

342
00:17:46,867 --> 00:17:49,334
what i won't give you,
you muckers!

343
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:51,954
I won't give you
the satisfaction of saying

344
00:17:51,989 --> 00:17:53,839
that i'm
sorry.

345
00:17:54,456 --> 00:17:55,207
Yeah!

346
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:56,458
Yeah, yeah!

347
00:17:58,745 --> 00:17:59,845
Yeah!

348
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,096
Yeah, yeah!

349
00:18:22,618 --> 00:18:25,120
Don't return
their hate.

350
00:18:25,155 --> 00:18:26,371
Don't dishonor
yourself.

351
00:18:26,406 --> 00:18:28,240
Why don't you
get out of here.

352
00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:30,125
I got too much
hate in me

353
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,376
to keep plugged up
anymore.

354
00:18:31,994 --> 00:18:35,881
When he came at you, jagger...

355
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:37,749
did it feel good to you then?

356
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:39,251
What difference?

357
00:18:39,286 --> 00:18:41,637
When you aimed that gun
at his head,

358
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:44,256
that wasn't such a bad moment,
was it?

359
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,141
Good, bad, who cares?

360
00:18:46,176 --> 00:18:49,261
When you killed him, jagger,

361
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:52,397
when you blew his head off,

362
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:54,900
there were no regrets then,
were there?

363
00:18:56,768 --> 00:18:58,403
You enjoyed that, didn't you?

364
00:18:59,521 --> 00:19:01,406
You know it!

365
00:19:01,441 --> 00:19:04,026
Yes, yes, i...

366
00:19:04,061 --> 00:19:05,911
i know it now.

367
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:10,666
Now i know it too well.

368
00:19:10,701 --> 00:19:12,534
You're guilty.

369
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:17,039
This manisguilty.

370
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:22,794
It's important to get
with the majority, isn't it?

371
00:19:24,046 --> 00:19:26,181
That's...

372
00:19:26,216 --> 00:19:29,301
that's a big thing nowadays,
isn't it, reverend?

373
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:33,689
That's all there is,
is the majority.

374
00:19:33,724 --> 00:19:38,060
The minority must have died
on the cross 2,000 years ago.

375
00:20:11,593 --> 00:20:13,478
You seen the light,
reverend.

376
00:20:13,513 --> 00:20:15,981
You really
seen the light.

377
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:20,352
Haveyou?

378
00:20:41,757 --> 00:20:43,125
Have any of you?

379
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:47,129
In all this darkness,

380
00:20:47,164 --> 00:20:50,265
is there anybody
who can make out the truth?

381
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:58,023
He hated and he killed
and now he dies.

382
00:20:59,274 --> 00:21:04,896
And you hated, you killed,

383
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:06,782
and now there's
not one of you...

384
00:21:06,817 --> 00:21:12,404
not one of you
who isn't doomed.

385
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:19,795
Do you know why it's dark?

386
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:23,548
Do you know why it is night
all around us?

387
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:26,418
Do you know what
the blackness is?

388
00:21:26,453 --> 00:21:30,806
It's the hatehefelt,
the hateyoufelt,

389
00:21:30,841 --> 00:21:33,925
the hate all of us feel,
and there's too much of it.

390
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,177
There's just too much.

391
00:21:35,212 --> 00:21:38,313
And so we had
to vomit it out.

392
00:21:38,348 --> 00:21:41,183
And now it's coming
up all around us

393
00:21:41,218 --> 00:21:43,068
and choking us.

394
00:21:43,103 --> 00:21:48,073
So much hate,
so much miserable hate.

395
00:21:49,324 --> 00:21:51,827
Look.

396
00:21:51,862 --> 00:21:54,946
Look what's happening.

397
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:56,832
It's getting even darker now.

398
00:21:58,083 --> 00:21:59,334
I can't...

399
00:22:01,203 --> 00:22:03,705
i can't hardly see
anything now.

400
00:22:10,212 --> 00:22:12,714
That's crazy, ain't it?

401
00:22:12,749 --> 00:22:14,599
I mean what he said.

402
00:22:14,634 --> 00:22:17,102
Ain't that crazy?

403
00:22:17,137 --> 00:22:18,970
You know what's
going to happen?

404
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:22,107
Believe me, you know
what's going to happen?

405
00:22:22,142 --> 00:22:23,975
This here stuff's going to lift.

406
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:26,478
It'll all of a sudden
just plain lift.

407
00:22:26,513 --> 00:22:30,232
Why it's just... just fog
is all it is.

408
00:22:30,267 --> 00:22:31,483
No more than fog.

409
00:22:31,518 --> 00:22:33,368
And it'll lift.

410
00:22:33,403 --> 00:22:34,619
And there'll
be the old sun,

411
00:22:35,237 --> 00:22:35,871
high up and bright.

412
00:22:35,906 --> 00:22:37,739
You wait and see.

413
00:22:37,774 --> 00:22:41,493
There'll be the old sun
shining to beat the band.

414
00:22:43,995 --> 00:22:47,749
Well, it could happen,
couldn't it?

415
00:22:47,784 --> 00:22:49,000
Couldn't that happen, koch?

416
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:54,005
Colbey?

417
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,142
There'll be sun again.

418
00:22:57,177 --> 00:23:00,262
There'll be daylight.

419
00:23:00,297 --> 00:23:04,649
I don't know.

420
00:23:04,684 --> 00:23:08,403
I don't know if there'll
ever be daylight again.

421
00:23:10,272 --> 00:23:12,774
Only god knows.

422
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:17,162
I'm sure only god knows.

423
00:23:24,286 --> 00:23:28,039
And still the phenomenon
remains unexplained

424
00:23:28,074 --> 00:23:31,793
except for the reports
coming in of similar occurrences

425
00:23:31,828 --> 00:23:34,296
here in the united states
and elsewhere.

426
00:23:34,331 --> 00:23:36,798
At 2:00 this afternoon
a dark cloud appeared

427
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:38,683
over a street in dallas, texas.

428
00:23:38,718 --> 00:23:42,437
The mayor of west berlin
verified that a rectangular area

429
00:23:42,472 --> 00:23:45,557
over the berlin wall
has suddenly gone dark.

430
00:23:45,592 --> 00:23:47,442
In budapest,
european newspapermen

431
00:23:47,477 --> 00:23:49,311
passed over censorship
an article

432
00:23:49,945 --> 00:23:53,064
about several square blocks,
including a political prison

433
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:56,818
which was suddenly thrown into
darkness early this morning.

434
00:23:56,853 --> 00:23:58,703
In birmingham, alabama,

435
00:23:58,738 --> 00:24:02,457
an area in shanghai, the entire
northern section of vietnam,

436
00:24:02,492 --> 00:24:04,326
a section of chicago, illinois,

437
00:24:04,361 --> 00:24:06,828
the darkness continues
to make itself known.

438
00:24:06,863 --> 00:24:09,331
A sickness known as hate;

439
00:24:09,366 --> 00:24:11,833
not a virus, not a microbe,
not a germ-

440
00:24:11,868 --> 00:24:14,336
but a sickness nonetheless,

441
00:24:14,371 --> 00:24:17,472
highly contagious,
deadly in its effects.

442
00:24:17,507 --> 00:24:19,975
Don't look for it
in the twilight zone-

443
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:21,843
look for it in a mirror.

444
00:24:21,878 --> 00:24:26,848
Look for it before the light
goes out altogether.

445
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:32,487
And now, mr. Serling.

446
00:24:32,522 --> 00:24:34,990
Next time out we bring you
a few decibels of sound

447
00:24:35,025 --> 00:24:36,241
in a bizarre opus about a man

448
00:24:36,276 --> 00:24:38,109
who breaks eardrums
for a living.

449
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:41,246
We welcome to the program
two fine talents,

450
00:24:41,281 --> 00:24:42,497
mr. John mcgiver
and miss penny singleton,

451
00:24:42,532 --> 00:24:44,366
who will prove
the following point:

452
00:24:44,401 --> 00:24:45,617
Namely that too much
of a good thing

453
00:24:45,652 --> 00:24:48,119
can have nightmarish results
and that all things

454
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:50,622
are not necessarily
as they meet the eye or the ear.

455
00:24:50,657 --> 00:24:55,844
Onthe twilight zonenext
"sounds and silences."
