1
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:12,595
You're traveling
through another dimension-

2
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,715
a dimension not only of sight
and sound, but of mind,

3
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,600
a journey into a wondrous land

4
00:00:17,635 --> 00:00:20,103
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

5
00:00:20,138 --> 00:00:22,605
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

6
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:33,867
Ooh!

7
00:00:33,902 --> 00:00:36,369
Positions for inspection!

8
00:00:39,489 --> 00:00:41,991
Come on, girls,
step it up, step it up, girls.

9
00:00:42,026 --> 00:00:43,376
Don't loiter.

10
00:00:43,411 --> 00:00:47,130
Small message of reassurance
to that horizontal young lady:

11
00:00:47,165 --> 00:00:48,998
Don't despair, help is en route.

12
00:00:49,033 --> 00:00:52,385
It's coming in an odd form
from a very distant place,

13
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,254
but it's nonetheless coming.

14
00:01:08,017 --> 00:01:10,520
You sent for me, chief?

15
00:01:11,806 --> 00:01:13,656
Apprentice angel
cavender,

16
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:16,159
it has come
to our attention

17
00:01:16,194 --> 00:01:19,279
that you are the only
angel of your class

18
00:01:19,314 --> 00:01:21,164
not to have
won your wings.

19
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:24,284
It has further come
to our attention

20
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:25,535
that you are a clod.

21
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:27,420
Before
reclassifying you,

22
00:01:27,455 --> 00:01:30,540
we're going to give
you one more chance.

23
00:01:42,552 --> 00:01:43,803
Nice-looking girl, chief.

24
00:01:43,838 --> 00:01:45,054
Precisely.

25
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:47,557
And she will be your project.

26
00:01:47,592 --> 00:01:49,058
You will return
to earth

27
00:01:49,093 --> 00:01:50,944
and supply her

28
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:55,315
aid, assistance and advice
for a period of 24 hours.

29
00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:00,320
If you are able to improve her
lot, we will reopen your case.

30
00:02:00,355 --> 00:02:04,073
You mean, chief,
that i still have a chance

31
00:02:04,108 --> 00:02:05,959
of getting my wings?

32
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,212
It will be taken
under advisement.

33
00:02:09,247 --> 00:02:11,080
Actually, cavender,

34
00:02:11,115 --> 00:02:12,966
there seems to be
considerable question

35
00:02:13,001 --> 00:02:14,834
about the damage
you can do

36
00:02:14,869 --> 00:02:16,085
with just
arms and legs,

37
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,337
not to mention
your mouth.

38
00:02:17,372 --> 00:02:19,088
Mm-hmm.

39
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,847
Submitted for your approval

40
00:02:27,882 --> 00:02:29,732
the case of one miss agnes grep

41
00:02:29,767 --> 00:02:34,103
put on earth with two left feet,
an overabundance of thumbs

42
00:02:34,138 --> 00:02:36,606
and a propensity
for falling down manholes.

43
00:02:36,641 --> 00:02:39,742
In a moment, she will be
up to her jaw in miracles

44
00:02:39,777 --> 00:02:42,862
brought by apprentice angel
harmon cavender,

45
00:02:42,897 --> 00:02:44,747
intent on winning his wings.

46
00:02:44,782 --> 00:02:45,999
And though it's a fact

47
00:02:46,034 --> 00:02:47,867
that both of them
should have stood in bed,

48
00:02:47,902 --> 00:02:49,118
they will tempt all the fates

49
00:02:49,153 --> 00:02:54,123
by moving into the cold,
gray dawn of the twilight zone.

50
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:13,860
Come on, girls,
step it up.

51
00:03:13,895 --> 00:03:16,362
Step it up,
girls.

52
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:23,736
You're the new one?

53
00:03:23,771 --> 00:03:25,238
Yes, sir, mr. Stout.

54
00:03:25,273 --> 00:03:28,374
And i would like to say
i'm just thrilled with this job.

55
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:31,127
If you don't mind, miss grep.

56
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,131
Now for the benefit
of the new recruit,

57
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:37,634
i will go over very quickly
the prescribed hand signals,

58
00:03:37,669 --> 00:03:39,385
indicating
assignment position

59
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,637
and order of the day.

60
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:43,756
Now, pay very close attention
to this, miss grep.

61
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:45,642
I will repeat it
only once.

62
00:03:45,677 --> 00:03:47,510
Very close
attention, miss grep.

63
00:03:47,545 --> 00:03:50,263
Now, the following
are the position signals:

64
00:03:50,298 --> 00:03:54,017
That means "spot girl, position
in the middle of the lobby"

65
00:03:54,052 --> 00:03:55,268
giving customers

66
00:03:55,303 --> 00:03:57,520
prescribed directions
as to seating arrangements,

67
00:03:57,555 --> 00:03:58,771
such as "stairway
to your right,"

68
00:03:58,806 --> 00:04:00,023
"aisle two
straight ahead,"

69
00:04:00,058 --> 00:04:02,525
"seating in the loge."

70
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,776
That means "30-minute break."

71
00:04:03,811 --> 00:04:06,279
This is "c".
That means "candy concession."

72
00:04:06,314 --> 00:04:07,413
That means
"box office."

73
00:04:07,448 --> 00:04:09,282
Requests for drinks
of water

74
00:04:09,317 --> 00:04:11,417
will be handled
in the following manner.

75
00:04:11,452 --> 00:04:13,786
I will respond
thusly...

76
00:04:13,821 --> 00:04:14,537
or thusly.

77
00:04:14,572 --> 00:04:15,788
That means "shoot."

78
00:04:15,823 --> 00:04:18,925
This is "shoot aisle one,"
"shoot aisle two,"

79
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:19,792
"shoot
aisle three,"

80
00:04:19,827 --> 00:04:21,044
and this is

81
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,679
"shoot the balcony"!

82
00:04:22,714 --> 00:04:23,796
All right,
girls?

83
00:04:23,831 --> 00:04:26,299
Ready for today's assignment?

84
00:04:26,334 --> 00:04:28,184
All right, now, rapaport...

85
00:04:28,219 --> 00:04:30,053
betton...

86
00:04:30,088 --> 00:04:31,304
burnett...

87
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:34,057
and the rest of you,
the same as yesterday.

88
00:04:34,092 --> 00:04:35,942
All right now, positions!
Go, girls!

89
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:42,565
Mr. Stout?

90
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:08,341
Um... there's
immediate seating

91
00:05:08,376 --> 00:05:10,843
in the loging...
balcony...

92
00:05:10,878 --> 00:05:14,597
uh... you can smoke
in the candy.

93
00:05:14,632 --> 00:05:16,482
No, uh,
there's lovely...

94
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:17,734
candy
over...

95
00:05:17,769 --> 00:05:20,853
oh, sit
anywhere.

96
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,361
Thank you.

97
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:40,623
Which aisle do they go?

98
00:05:40,658 --> 00:05:43,126
What do i do with these?

99
00:05:43,161 --> 00:05:44,377
Mr. Stout?

100
00:05:44,412 --> 00:05:46,879
Mr. Stout!

101
00:05:48,131 --> 00:05:49,382
Oh, my god.

102
00:05:49,417 --> 00:05:53,136
What's the signal
for "i'm sorry"?

103
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,670
Uh, don't panic,
miss grep.

104
00:06:27,705 --> 00:06:29,555
Please don't panic.

105
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:32,058
If-if you'll give me just
a moment, i can explain.

106
00:06:32,093 --> 00:06:33,676
I almost missed the bus.

107
00:06:33,711 --> 00:06:35,561
There used to be trolleys here,

108
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:37,430
and then they took up
the tracks.

109
00:06:37,465 --> 00:06:38,431
Yeah.

110
00:06:39,717 --> 00:06:42,819
I... i happen to be
your guardian angel.

111
00:06:42,854 --> 00:06:44,320
Now, i know
this might

112
00:06:44,355 --> 00:06:46,439
come to you as rather a shock.

113
00:06:46,474 --> 00:06:48,941
Used to cost a dime.

114
00:06:48,976 --> 00:06:50,193
Yes, i know.

115
00:06:50,228 --> 00:06:54,580
As i was saying, i've been
given 24 hours to help you

116
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:56,332
in every way
possible,

117
00:06:56,367 --> 00:06:59,085
and that doesn't preclude
the use of miracles.

118
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:02,588
Oh, here, i'll hold them.

119
00:07:02,623 --> 00:07:03,840
Now it's a quarter.

120
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,342
Uh, what's a quarter?

121
00:07:06,377 --> 00:07:08,094
The bus fare you pay.

122
00:07:08,129 --> 00:07:09,462
Yes, i know.

123
00:07:09,497 --> 00:07:11,964
That's just my point, miss grep.

124
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:15,101
I didn't pay to get on this bus.

125
00:07:15,218 --> 00:07:17,103
Shh.

126
00:07:17,138 --> 00:07:18,971
I'm an angel.

127
00:07:19,006 --> 00:07:20,857
I happen to be your angel.

128
00:07:20,892 --> 00:07:23,226
Don't you worry

129
00:07:23,261 --> 00:07:24,477
about it.

130
00:07:24,512 --> 00:07:26,729
I daydream a lot myself.

131
00:07:26,764 --> 00:07:30,483
Miss grep, wouldn't you at least
like to see a little miracle?

132
00:07:30,518 --> 00:07:34,237
Like for example,
instead of riding

133
00:07:34,272 --> 00:07:37,373
on this run-of-the-mill bus
like everybody does,

134
00:07:37,408 --> 00:07:39,242
how would you like to be riding

135
00:07:39,277 --> 00:07:42,378
in a flashy convertible
with a chauffeur?

136
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:46,382
You're cute.

137
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:50,753
Watch this.

138
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:55,141
Now once in a while,
i may louse these things up,

139
00:07:55,176 --> 00:07:56,392
but give me
a second

140
00:07:56,427 --> 00:08:00,146
to concentrate and...
and i think i'll make it.

141
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:04,150
I think i'm ready.

142
00:08:12,275 --> 00:08:14,777
Whoops!
I think i goofed.

143
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:23,786
Well, back in the bus.

144
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:37,934
When the supervisor

145
00:08:37,969 --> 00:08:39,802
comes to
claim the bus,

146
00:08:39,837 --> 00:08:41,304
tell him i've resigned.

147
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:49,195
Well, what have
you got to say now?

148
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:51,063
Excuse me,
this is my stop.

149
00:08:51,098 --> 00:08:53,566
It's been swell
chatting with you.

150
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:30,019
Hiya, gang.

151
00:09:30,054 --> 00:09:31,270
What do you say?

152
00:09:31,305 --> 00:09:32,521
Hi, aggie.

153
00:09:32,556 --> 00:09:33,773
You got candy today?

154
00:09:33,808 --> 00:09:35,658
Have i got some candy.

155
00:09:35,693 --> 00:09:36,909
You close your eyes.

156
00:09:36,944 --> 00:09:39,412
All right, here's one
for you,

157
00:09:39,447 --> 00:09:41,914
and here's one for you.

158
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:45,668
On this potato pancake stuff,
how many eggs?

159
00:09:45,703 --> 00:09:48,788
It's, uh, one egg
and half an onion.

160
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:51,290
How's the
job, aggie?

161
00:09:51,325 --> 00:09:52,541
Itwas, irv.

162
00:09:52,576 --> 00:09:53,793
Past tense.

163
00:09:53,828 --> 00:09:55,044
Ag, you didn't go
lose another one?

164
00:09:55,079 --> 00:09:56,929
Yup, lost another one.

165
00:09:56,964 --> 00:10:00,049
Plotzky's bijou
of famous hollywood hits.

166
00:10:00,084 --> 00:10:01,300
Oh, i was great
in reconnaissance

167
00:10:01,335 --> 00:10:05,054
and infiltration,
but i flunked close order drill.

168
00:10:05,089 --> 00:10:07,690
Oh, aggie, i
busted my cookie.

169
00:10:07,725 --> 00:10:08,941
You busted your cookie?

170
00:10:08,976 --> 00:10:11,444
Well, you know
doggone good and well

171
00:10:11,479 --> 00:10:13,312
i have another cookie
here for you, don't you?

172
00:10:13,347 --> 00:10:14,563
Thank you.

173
00:10:14,598 --> 00:10:16,198
You're welcome.
See you later.

174
00:10:16,233 --> 00:10:18,701
See you later, aggie.

175
00:10:35,584 --> 00:10:37,470
Don't panic!
Don't panic!

176
00:10:37,505 --> 00:10:38,721
I know.

177
00:10:38,756 --> 00:10:41,223
Um, i thought
i left you back there.

178
00:10:41,258 --> 00:10:43,726
Oh, perish the
thought, miss grep.

179
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:47,480
I am going to be with
you for 24 hours...

180
00:10:47,515 --> 00:10:51,233
uh, 23 hours and 31
minutes, to be exact.

181
00:10:51,268 --> 00:10:53,102
My dear miss grep,

182
00:10:53,137 --> 00:10:55,604
i am here to
change your life.

183
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:56,856
Uh-huh.

184
00:10:56,891 --> 00:10:59,358
You know, this is a kind
of an interesting place

185
00:10:59,393 --> 00:11:00,609
you have here.

186
00:11:00,644 --> 00:11:02,495
I like it.

187
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:04,363
Yeah, well, uh,
let's get down

188
00:11:04,398 --> 00:11:06,248
to business, shall we?

189
00:11:06,283 --> 00:11:08,117
Now, in cases
of this kind,

190
00:11:08,152 --> 00:11:10,619
i try to examine
the problems

191
00:11:10,654 --> 00:11:11,871
and then alleviate them.

192
00:11:11,906 --> 00:11:13,756
Now, in your case,
miss grep,

193
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,258
it seems that you can't
hold on to a job.

194
00:11:16,293 --> 00:11:18,127
Would you like
a cup of tea?

195
00:11:18,162 --> 00:11:21,130
No. Now the way we attack
this employment problem...

196
00:11:21,165 --> 00:11:22,381
a beer?

197
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:23,632
No. Is to fix it

198
00:11:23,667 --> 00:11:25,518
so that you're
independently wealthy

199
00:11:26,135 --> 00:11:28,020
and don't even
need employment.

200
00:11:28,055 --> 00:11:29,889
Wine? I have some sherry.

201
00:11:29,924 --> 00:11:31,774
Miss grep, we
are discussing

202
00:11:31,809 --> 00:11:33,642
the alteration of...

203
00:11:33,677 --> 00:11:34,894
of your
entire future.

204
00:11:34,929 --> 00:11:37,396
And i think we
ought to dispense

205
00:11:37,431 --> 00:11:38,647
with these
convivialities

206
00:11:38,682 --> 00:11:41,150
and proceed to...
do you have any gin?

207
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:44,286
No, but i could run down
to mrs. Rianti's apartment.

208
00:11:44,321 --> 00:11:45,538
Her husband makes it.

209
00:11:45,573 --> 00:11:46,789
No, thanks.
I've had that kind.

210
00:11:46,824 --> 00:11:48,657
Oh.

211
00:11:48,692 --> 00:11:51,660
Well, back to
business, shall we?

212
00:11:51,695 --> 00:11:57,917
Now, first of all, miss grep,
i... i don't think that...

213
00:11:57,952 --> 00:12:00,419
i don't think you can live here.

214
00:12:00,454 --> 00:12:01,921
No?

215
00:12:01,956 --> 00:12:02,805
Well, hardly.

216
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:07,176
Let's see
here...

217
00:12:07,211 --> 00:12:09,178
oh, yes, here's a good one.

218
00:12:09,213 --> 00:12:11,680
The morgan mansion
on sutton place.

219
00:12:11,715 --> 00:12:14,817
That's the last one
of its kind in new york city.

220
00:12:14,852 --> 00:12:16,068
Oh, a mansion.

221
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:19,188
And how do i pay
for this mansion?

222
00:12:19,223 --> 00:12:21,690
My dear miss grep,
there are all sorts of ways.

223
00:12:21,725 --> 00:12:24,193
I am not that
kind of girl!

224
00:12:24,228 --> 00:12:26,695
Yes, i have no doubt.

225
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:28,581
But as of this moment,

226
00:12:28,616 --> 00:12:31,700
you are independently
wealthy.

227
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:37,339
Now, let me see here-
oh, yes, savings account:

228
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:40,459
6-6-1-0-3, new york
national bank,

229
00:12:40,494 --> 00:12:42,962
agnes grep- that's you.

230
00:12:42,997 --> 00:12:47,349
$23,367 and 19 cents.

231
00:12:47,384 --> 00:12:49,218
Nineteen?

232
00:12:49,253 --> 00:12:50,469
Yeah, i hate
round numbers.

233
00:12:50,504 --> 00:12:52,354
Me, too.

234
00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:53,606
Looks better that way.

235
00:12:53,641 --> 00:12:55,474
About your social
activities...

236
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:59,862
well, i generally
go bowling on thursdays.

237
00:12:59,897 --> 00:13:01,730
Bowling, schmowling.

238
00:13:01,765 --> 00:13:03,616
That may be okay
for pinsetters,

239
00:13:03,651 --> 00:13:05,484
but not for
real society.

240
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:28,757
Whoops!

241
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,516
Oh, perfectly
charming party,
agnes, my dear.

242
00:13:37,551 --> 00:13:40,019
Why, i was talking
to tony about it.

243
00:13:40,054 --> 00:13:41,270
You look
ravishing, dear.

244
00:13:41,305 --> 00:13:42,521
Absolutely
ravishing.

245
00:13:42,556 --> 00:13:43,772
Oh, thank you
very much.

246
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,024
Doesn't she?

247
00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:46,275
Oh, yes.

248
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,536
All yours, my dear.

249
00:13:57,571 --> 00:13:59,421
Agnes, cherie!

250
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,175
Unravel the flesh,
will you?

251
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,044
My dear, you
are exquisite,

252
00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:06,929
enchanting,
delightful.

253
00:14:06,964 --> 00:14:08,797
And i intend
to notify charlie

254
00:14:08,832 --> 00:14:11,934
that this was the high
social point of the season.

255
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:13,802
My dear,
nobody in the world

256
00:14:13,837 --> 00:14:15,688
can throw
a party like you.

257
00:14:15,723 --> 00:14:17,189
Come along, my dear.

258
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,697
Now this is what
i call a miracle.

259
00:14:24,732 --> 00:14:28,067
The best martini
i ever conjured.

260
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,959
How do you do?

261
00:14:36,994 --> 00:14:37,576
I've seen all
of your movies

262
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,461
at least 60
or 70 times.

263
00:14:40,748 --> 00:14:42,715
I think you're...
wonderful.

264
00:14:46,503 --> 00:14:48,721
Oh, i'm sorry.

265
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,092
Mmm...

266
00:14:53,127 --> 00:14:55,594
sensationnel,
cherie, coco.

267
00:15:00,768 --> 00:15:01,984
A real blast,
isn't it?

268
00:15:02,019 --> 00:15:04,486
Yeah. Crazy.

269
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:08,741
Oh, are you
all right?

270
00:15:08,776 --> 00:15:09,992
You're terribly
stinky.

271
00:15:10,027 --> 00:15:11,243
Lovely party,
darling.

272
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:13,112
I had a
wonderful time.

273
00:15:13,147 --> 00:15:13,746
Come along.

274
00:15:14,363 --> 00:15:15,614
Swell having you.

275
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:17,499
Lovely party,
aggie.

276
00:15:17,534 --> 00:15:18,117
Thank you.

277
00:15:18,152 --> 00:15:20,002
Ravishing, darling,
ravishing.

278
00:15:20,037 --> 00:15:22,504
Yes, thank you.

279
00:15:44,393 --> 00:15:46,895
Oh... oh!

280
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:50,649
Oh, boy, what a blast.

281
00:15:52,569 --> 00:15:55,654
Harmon, old buddy,
you really outdid yourself.

282
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,167
Agnes...

283
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:29,071
my apartment-

284
00:16:29,106 --> 00:16:30,939
it's been rented.

285
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:33,442
Yeah, i... i know.

286
00:16:33,477 --> 00:16:36,578
My landlady- she
didn't even know me.

287
00:16:36,613 --> 00:16:37,196
She called me

288
00:16:37,231 --> 00:16:39,581
"miss."

289
00:16:39,616 --> 00:16:41,333
And you know
what irv said to me?

290
00:16:41,368 --> 00:16:43,702
Who's irv?

291
00:16:43,737 --> 00:16:45,204
My neighbor across the hall.

292
00:16:45,239 --> 00:16:47,089
He came out
to get the morning paper,

293
00:16:47,124 --> 00:16:48,957
and you know what he said?

294
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:52,594
He said, "what's
with you, sister?

295
00:16:52,629 --> 00:16:53,712
You
slumming?"

296
00:16:53,747 --> 00:16:54,963
Well, miss grep...

297
00:16:54,998 --> 00:16:56,849
you know that old saying:

298
00:16:56,884 --> 00:16:59,968
"You can't have your
cake and also eat it."

299
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:03,722
Why, i mean, somebody's
got to pay the fiddler.

300
00:17:03,757 --> 00:17:07,359
After all, you know
and everybody knows

301
00:17:07,976 --> 00:17:09,978
that the whole
philosophy of living

302
00:17:10,013 --> 00:17:12,481
is a kind of
a give-and-take thing.

303
00:17:12,516 --> 00:17:14,983
And after
all, when...

304
00:17:15,018 --> 00:17:17,870
well, what did you expect?

305
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:21,874
Oh, not much
of anything, really.

306
00:17:21,909 --> 00:17:23,125
Except...

307
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:27,496
oh, except that...

308
00:17:27,531 --> 00:17:28,747
except what?

309
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:31,884
Friends, maybe.

310
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:50,018
Hey, joe.

311
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,914
Pierre, morgan mansion,
sutton place.

312
00:18:01,949 --> 00:18:03,782
No.

313
00:18:03,817 --> 00:18:07,536
No morgan mansion
and no sutton place.

314
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:10,038
How's that?

315
00:18:10,073 --> 00:18:13,175
Mr. Cavender, i don't
want to go back there.

316
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:14,426
I want to stay
right here.

317
00:18:14,461 --> 00:18:17,546
You... you...
why, that's ridiculous.

318
00:18:17,581 --> 00:18:18,797
You can't stay here.

319
00:18:18,832 --> 00:18:20,682
24 hours of miracles,

320
00:18:20,717 --> 00:18:23,185
and i leave you
the way i found you?

321
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,436
Come on!

322
00:18:24,471 --> 00:18:26,939
I'd never get my wings.

323
00:18:26,974 --> 00:18:28,190
I'd be drummed out.

324
00:18:28,225 --> 00:18:29,441
I'd be reclassified.

325
00:18:29,476 --> 00:18:32,561
There's no telling
where they'd send me.

326
00:18:32,596 --> 00:18:35,814
Miss grep, didn't we have
a wonderful time?

327
00:18:35,849 --> 00:18:37,699
Don't you have
everything

328
00:18:37,734 --> 00:18:39,568
you always
wanted now?

329
00:18:39,603 --> 00:18:42,070
My dear miss grep...

330
00:18:42,105 --> 00:18:43,956
my charming miss grep...

331
00:18:43,991 --> 00:18:46,458
don't you want to be happy?

332
00:18:46,493 --> 00:18:48,961
Mr. Cavender,
you don't understand me.

333
00:18:48,996 --> 00:18:50,829
Iwashappy.

334
00:18:50,864 --> 00:18:52,714
I want it the way it was.

335
00:18:52,749 --> 00:18:54,583
The way it was? Unstable,

336
00:18:54,618 --> 00:18:57,085
unresolved and unemployed?

337
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,473
Disconnected, discombooberated
and behind in my rent.

338
00:19:01,508 --> 00:19:03,342
But that's for me.

339
00:19:03,377 --> 00:19:04,726
That and then...

340
00:19:04,761 --> 00:19:07,846
and the baby-sitting
and the bowling

341
00:19:07,881 --> 00:19:10,349
and the potato pancakes.

342
00:19:10,384 --> 00:19:11,733
Mr. Cavender...

343
00:19:13,602 --> 00:19:15,487
please.

344
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,858
Well, okay, miss grep.

345
00:19:19,893 --> 00:19:21,743
But i think
you're making

346
00:19:21,778 --> 00:19:22,995
an awful
mistake.

347
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:24,863
Are you sure?

348
00:19:24,898 --> 00:19:26,114
Uh-huh.

349
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,251
Okay.

350
00:19:29,286 --> 00:19:31,119
Here we go.

351
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:43,632
Well, i...
i tried, chief.

352
00:19:43,667 --> 00:19:46,134
Nobody can say i didn't try.

353
00:19:46,169 --> 00:19:49,888
Hey, joe, let me take
it up to the riantis.

354
00:19:49,923 --> 00:19:51,139
Oh, and joe...

355
00:19:52,426 --> 00:19:54,276
hey, what do
you say, ag?

356
00:19:54,311 --> 00:19:56,778
Hi, herb, top of
the morning to you,

357
00:19:56,813 --> 00:19:58,647
and don't shoot
till you see

358
00:19:58,682 --> 00:19:59,898
the whites
of their eyes!

359
00:20:01,149 --> 00:20:03,652
Oh, aggie, on this
potato pancake stuff-

360
00:20:03,687 --> 00:20:04,903
how many eggs?

361
00:20:04,938 --> 00:20:06,154
An even dozen.

362
00:20:06,189 --> 00:20:07,406
I'll be down
in a minute.

363
00:20:07,441 --> 00:20:09,291
Mrs. Rianti?

364
00:20:11,828 --> 00:20:13,045
Hi, darlings.

365
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,547
Listen, you all wait
right down here.

366
00:20:15,582 --> 00:20:17,416
I'll be down
in two seconds flat

367
00:20:17,451 --> 00:20:19,301
with some candy
and a cookie.

368
00:20:19,336 --> 00:20:20,552
Come on, kids.

369
00:20:21,169 --> 00:20:23,171
Aggie'll be back
in a minute.

370
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:46,578
Hey, mr. Cavender?

371
00:20:46,613 --> 00:20:47,829
Thanks a heap.

372
00:20:47,864 --> 00:20:49,081
But no thanks.

373
00:20:49,116 --> 00:20:51,583
You know something,
miss grep?

374
00:20:51,618 --> 00:20:54,586
You are the richest woman
i know.

375
00:20:54,621 --> 00:20:58,340
You have an abundance of wealth.

376
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:02,711
And it seems that i've had
to travel a very long distance

377
00:21:02,746 --> 00:21:05,847
to find out
that cash and contentment

378
00:21:05,882 --> 00:21:08,350
aren't necessarily synonymous.

379
00:21:08,385 --> 00:21:10,218
Well...

380
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,972
good-bye, miss grep.

381
00:21:14,007 --> 00:21:15,223
And, uh...

382
00:21:15,258 --> 00:21:17,726
don't take any wooden angels,

383
00:21:17,761 --> 00:21:18,727
you hear?

384
00:21:20,647 --> 00:21:21,863
Yeah-yeah, chief?

385
00:21:21,898 --> 00:21:24,983
You want to...
you want to talk to me...

386
00:21:25,018 --> 00:21:26,868
right away.

387
00:21:26,903 --> 00:21:29,371
Yeah, i'll-i'll be right up.

388
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:37,879
Smoking cigars
on assignment.

389
00:21:37,914 --> 00:21:39,748
Conduct unbecoming
an angel.

390
00:21:39,783 --> 00:21:41,633
Champagne-drinking.

391
00:21:41,668 --> 00:21:43,502
Gin and tonic
drinking.

392
00:21:43,537 --> 00:21:45,387
Gin fizz drinking.

393
00:21:45,422 --> 00:21:48,507
Gin on the rocks,
extra dry martinis.

394
00:21:48,542 --> 00:21:51,643
Inebriation.

395
00:21:51,678 --> 00:21:54,146
And i could go
on from there.

396
00:21:54,181 --> 00:21:57,265
Cavender, you're a disgrace

397
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,151
to the entire service.

398
00:21:59,186 --> 00:22:01,019
Uh, i know it, sir.

399
00:22:01,054 --> 00:22:04,773
I'm afraid you know
what this means.

400
00:22:04,808 --> 00:22:07,275
Re... classification, sir?

401
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:10,412
At least
reclassification.

402
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:18,537
I hate to do this,
cavender, i really do.

403
00:22:18,572 --> 00:22:21,673
I... i understand, sir.

404
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:23,542
As a matter
of fact, i...

405
00:22:25,462 --> 00:22:27,929
why, this is incredible.

406
00:22:27,964 --> 00:22:29,798
Why... why, she's...
she's...

407
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:31,683
happy- just look
at her, sir.

408
00:22:31,718 --> 00:22:33,552
Why, yes.

409
00:22:33,587 --> 00:22:36,188
Why, she's six times happier
than the way i found her.

410
00:22:36,223 --> 00:22:38,056
She's deliriously

411
00:22:38,091 --> 00:22:38,807
and totally
happy.

412
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:41,943
Well, i don't see
how that could be.

413
00:22:41,978 --> 00:22:43,562
But she is.
Just-just look at her.

414
00:22:43,597 --> 00:22:45,447
You see what she's doing, sir?

415
00:22:45,482 --> 00:22:46,314
What is that?

416
00:22:46,349 --> 00:22:47,566
She's bowling.

417
00:22:47,601 --> 00:22:50,068
She goes bowling
every thursday night.

418
00:22:50,103 --> 00:22:53,205
Are you supposed to keep
your finger in the ball

419
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,073
after it starts
down the lane?

420
00:22:55,108 --> 00:22:56,324
No, sir, i don't think

421
00:22:56,359 --> 00:22:58,827
she's quite got the hang
of it yet, sir.

422
00:22:58,862 --> 00:23:01,463
Ooh, i hope she didn't
hurt herself.

423
00:23:01,498 --> 00:23:03,331
Well, cavender,

424
00:23:03,366 --> 00:23:05,967
it seems that i've been
premature in my judgment.

425
00:23:06,002 --> 00:23:07,836
Your assignment was
to make her happy,

426
00:23:07,871 --> 00:23:10,338
and that's precisely
the way she is,

427
00:23:10,373 --> 00:23:12,841
so there's very little room
for doubt about your...

428
00:23:12,876 --> 00:23:14,726
go on, sir, i'm all ears.

429
00:23:14,761 --> 00:23:16,595
I noticed.

430
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:19,731
I think, under
the circumstances, cavender,

431
00:23:19,766 --> 00:23:22,234
since you've done so very well

432
00:23:22,269 --> 00:23:23,485
with that
subject,

433
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,736
it occurs
to me

434
00:23:24,771 --> 00:23:26,605
that there
are other

435
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,607
deserving subjects down there

436
00:23:28,642 --> 00:23:32,360
who might require
a little angelic assistance

437
00:23:32,395 --> 00:23:33,612
from time to time.

438
00:23:33,647 --> 00:23:36,748
Each one of them
will be your project.

439
00:23:36,783 --> 00:23:39,868
Oh, oh, oh, thank you,
thank you, sir.

440
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:45,123
In a strange way,
i feel rather sorry for them.

441
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:48,009
Thank you.

442
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:50,011
Thank you.

443
00:23:50,046 --> 00:23:51,880
A word to the wise now
to any and all

444
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:54,382
who might suddenly
feel the presence

445
00:23:54,417 --> 00:23:56,268
of a cigar-smoking helpmate

446
00:23:56,303 --> 00:23:58,770
who takes bankbooks out
of thin air.

447
00:23:58,805 --> 00:24:01,273
If you're suddenly aware
of any such celestial aids,

448
00:24:01,308 --> 00:24:03,141
it means that you're under
the beneficent care

449
00:24:03,176 --> 00:24:05,644
of one harmon cavender,
guardian angel,

450
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:10,031
and this message from
lots of luck.

451
00:24:43,865 --> 00:24:46,351
This is james arness.

452
00:24:46,386 --> 00:24:48,236
You know, it's only a short hop

453
00:24:48,271 --> 00:24:50,739
fromthe twilight zone
to dodge city ingunsmoke.

454
00:24:50,774 --> 00:24:53,859
Saturday nights
over most of these stations.
