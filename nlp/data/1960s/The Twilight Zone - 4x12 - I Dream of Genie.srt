1
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:11,277
You unlock this door
with the key of imagination.

2
00:00:11,312 --> 00:00:13,646
Beyond it is another dimension-

3
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:15,648
a dimension of sound,

4
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:18,151
a dimension of sight,

5
00:00:18,186 --> 00:00:20,036
a dimension of mind.

6
00:00:20,071 --> 00:00:23,156
You're moving into a land
of both shadow and substance,

7
00:00:23,191 --> 00:00:24,407
of things and ideas.

8
00:00:24,442 --> 00:00:28,161
You've just crossed over
into the twilight zone.

9
00:00:35,051 --> 00:00:37,554
Three glass
perfume bottles.

10
00:00:37,589 --> 00:00:39,422
Threecrystalbottles.

11
00:00:39,457 --> 00:00:41,925
To imprison the attar
of damask rose petals.

12
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,427
Two pottery jugs.

13
00:00:44,462 --> 00:00:46,312
Pottery jugs?

14
00:00:46,347 --> 00:00:47,680
Where's your
aesthetic sense, man?

15
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:50,183
You can't entice anyone
to buy "pottery jugs."

16
00:00:50,218 --> 00:00:52,685
You think people buy something
'cause what you call it?

17
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,822
People don'tbuyanything
in a gift shop.

18
00:00:55,857 --> 00:00:58,942
They come in because
they don't know what they want.

19
00:00:58,977 --> 00:01:00,827
And then i...
sell them something.

20
00:01:00,862 --> 00:01:03,830
Okay, what do you call
the pottery jugs?

21
00:01:03,865 --> 00:01:06,449
We'll display those alongside
a couple of those silk pillows,

22
00:01:06,484 --> 00:01:07,700
with a loaf of dark bread.

23
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:09,586
"A loaf of bread, a jug of wine,

24
00:01:09,621 --> 00:01:12,088
and thou beside me
singing in the wilderness."

25
00:01:13,491 --> 00:01:15,458
I'll unload them
in three days.

26
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:17,460
Okay, omar...

27
00:01:17,495 --> 00:01:19,963
what do you call this?

28
00:01:19,998 --> 00:01:21,214
Well...

29
00:01:21,249 --> 00:01:22,599
when we buy
a shipment from morocco,

30
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:24,467
sight unseen,
we take what we get.

31
00:01:24,502 --> 00:01:26,970
To sell this,
i'll have to high-pressure

32
00:01:27,005 --> 00:01:28,221
some unsuspecting sucker.

33
00:01:35,612 --> 00:01:38,114
Yes, sir, may i
help you, sir?

34
00:01:38,149 --> 00:01:39,983
Well, i, i hope so.

35
00:01:40,018 --> 00:01:42,735
I mean, i'm not sure.
I don't know what i want.

36
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:44,621
Well, suppose you
tell me the occasion

37
00:01:44,656 --> 00:01:46,239
and for whom
it's intended,

38
00:01:46,274 --> 00:01:49,375
and, uh...
leave it up to me.

39
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:53,746
Well, it's, it's got to be
something very special.

40
00:01:55,033 --> 00:01:56,249
Yes.

41
00:01:56,284 --> 00:01:57,500
A, um...

42
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:00,753
personal gift, sir?

43
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:02,639
Oh, not, not
toopersonal, no.

44
00:02:02,674 --> 00:02:05,758
You see, there's this, uh,
girl at my office,

45
00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:08,261
and she's...
she's like a goddess.

46
00:02:08,296 --> 00:02:11,397
And i wouldn't want her to
think that i was implying...

47
00:02:12,684 --> 00:02:14,517
i understand, sir.

48
00:02:14,552 --> 00:02:16,019
Oh, i have it.

49
00:02:16,054 --> 00:02:18,404
It's ideal, it's perfect,
it's marvelous.

50
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:19,656
It's romantic,

51
00:02:19,691 --> 00:02:20,907
but not forward,

52
00:02:20,942 --> 00:02:24,027
and yet, intime, in a subtle
sort of way, of course.

53
00:02:24,062 --> 00:02:25,278
Voila.

54
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:27,163
That, that old...?

55
00:02:27,198 --> 00:02:29,032
This magnificent
old antique-

56
00:02:29,067 --> 00:02:31,534
a truly distinguished antique-
fit for a goddess.

57
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:34,037
A continual reminder
of your-your good taste,

58
00:02:34,072 --> 00:02:36,039
your individuality,
your-your flair for romance.

59
00:02:36,074 --> 00:02:37,290
Note the tarnished metal.

60
00:02:37,325 --> 00:02:39,792
It testifies
to its true authenticity,

61
00:02:39,827 --> 00:02:41,678
and only $20.

62
00:02:41,713 --> 00:02:43,429
Here, put this
in a gift box

63
00:02:43,464 --> 00:02:45,298
for a most discriminating
gentleman.

64
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:46,549
Thank you, sir.

65
00:02:46,584 --> 00:02:49,052
And i trust that you will allow
me to serve you again

66
00:02:49,087 --> 00:02:50,303
when it comes time
for the, uh...

67
00:02:50,338 --> 00:02:52,188
engagement present?

68
00:02:52,223 --> 00:02:53,439
Hmm.

69
00:02:53,474 --> 00:02:55,308
Meet mr. George p. Hanley

70
00:02:55,343 --> 00:02:57,810
a man life treats
without deference,

71
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,062
honor or success.

72
00:02:59,097 --> 00:03:00,947
Waiters serve his soup cold.

73
00:03:00,982 --> 00:03:03,449
Elevator operators close doors
in his face.

74
00:03:03,484 --> 00:03:07,203
Mothers never bother to wait up
for the daughters he dates.

75
00:03:07,238 --> 00:03:08,454
George is a creature

76
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:10,957
of humble habits
and tame dreams.

77
00:03:10,992 --> 00:03:12,825
He's an ordinary man,
mr. Hanley,

78
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,077
but at this moment,

79
00:03:14,112 --> 00:03:17,213
the accidental possessor
of a very special gift...

80
00:03:17,248 --> 00:03:19,716
the kind of gift that measures
men against their dreams...

81
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,835
the kind of gift most of us
might ask for first

82
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,338
and possibly regret
to the last...

83
00:03:25,373 --> 00:03:27,223
if we,
like mr. George p. Hanley,

84
00:03:27,258 --> 00:03:29,726
were about to plunge headfirst
and unaware

85
00:03:29,761 --> 00:03:34,097
into our own personal
twilight zone.

86
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:16,055
Hi, there,
georgie-porgie.

87
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,307
Where were
you for lunch?

88
00:04:17,342 --> 00:04:18,558
Well, l-i had
a few errands.

89
00:04:18,593 --> 00:04:21,060
Well, you missed
the world's champion

90
00:04:21,095 --> 00:04:22,312
worst chili con carne

91
00:04:22,347 --> 00:04:24,814
ever offered
for human consumption.

92
00:04:24,849 --> 00:04:27,951
It set an historic new low

93
00:04:27,986 --> 00:04:31,070
even for that greasy spoon
nick dares to call a diner.

94
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:33,706
I don't care much for chili.

95
00:04:33,741 --> 00:04:36,209
Georgie, witness
a solemn vow for me, will you?

96
00:04:36,244 --> 00:04:39,963
Right now? But i have to enter
these municipal bonds.

97
00:04:39,998 --> 00:04:42,465
I, roger hackett,
do solemnly swear

98
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,585
never again to commit
gastronomic harl-kari at nick's,

99
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:49,339
beginning with the first day of
my promotion to head bookkeeper.

100
00:04:49,374 --> 00:04:53,092
But mr. Watson said that
each of us with equal seniority

101
00:04:53,127 --> 00:04:54,978
would have an equal chance.

102
00:04:55,013 --> 00:04:58,097
That is true, georgie,
old porgie, we're all equal.

103
00:04:58,132 --> 00:05:01,851
But some of us are just a teeny
bit more equal than others.

104
00:05:01,886 --> 00:05:03,102
Especially me.

105
00:05:03,353 --> 00:05:05,238
Now, mr. Watson
is fair, roger.

106
00:05:05,273 --> 00:05:07,740
Now, don't-don't
don't be overconfident.

107
00:05:08,992 --> 00:05:10,860
I'm sure he will
weigh carefully

108
00:05:10,895 --> 00:05:12,745
our comparative
experience

109
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,248
in debit
financing

110
00:05:15,283 --> 00:05:17,116
and in evaluating
liabilities.

111
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,368
That, old georgie,

112
00:05:18,403 --> 00:05:21,504
is one reason
i am more equal than you.

113
00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:23,373
W-what is?

114
00:05:23,408 --> 00:05:25,875
You're always thinking
about debits and liabilities

115
00:05:26,509 --> 00:05:28,378
when there are assets
like her around.

116
00:05:40,058 --> 00:05:41,274
Guess who?

117
00:05:41,309 --> 00:05:42,525
Roger?

118
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:45,028
Happy birthday...
oh!

119
00:05:45,063 --> 00:05:47,530
...to the prettiest girl
in this entire office!

120
00:05:47,565 --> 00:05:48,781
Happy birthday!

121
00:05:48,816 --> 00:05:50,650
Many more.

122
00:05:50,685 --> 00:05:52,535
No, but i'm theonlygirl.

123
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:56,289
And-and you would
remain the prettiest,

124
00:05:56,324 --> 00:05:57,540
even if this office
were staffed with

125
00:05:57,575 --> 00:06:00,043
the assembled
miss americas of
the past five years.

126
00:06:00,078 --> 00:06:03,162
Now, stop fishing
for compliments and
open your present.

127
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:06,299
Well... i wonder
what it could be.

128
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:09,302
Oh, roger!

129
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:11,804
Hey, hey!

130
00:06:12,422 --> 00:06:14,307
Oh, it's beautiful!

131
00:06:15,093 --> 00:06:16,309
Ann, put it on.

132
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,177
Fellas, fellas...

133
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:20,563
can you just picture
old man watson's puss

134
00:06:20,598 --> 00:06:23,066
when he calls her
in for dictation?
How 'bout that, huh?

135
00:06:23,101 --> 00:06:27,186
Mr. Watson has a mind for
a different kind of figure, sam.

136
00:06:29,107 --> 00:06:31,824
You, uh, really
like it, ann?

137
00:06:31,941 --> 00:06:33,826
Oh, roger, i absolutelyloveit.

138
00:06:33,861 --> 00:06:38,197
But, really, you shouldn't
have been so extravagant.

139
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:40,199
Well, after all, a girl
only has a birthday

140
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:41,834
once a year-
until she's 30, of course.

141
00:06:41,869 --> 00:06:44,087
And then she has them
once every two years...

142
00:06:45,373 --> 00:06:46,589
roger.

143
00:06:46,624 --> 00:06:47,840
Come over here.

144
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:05,608
There.

145
00:07:05,643 --> 00:07:08,728
Now, that's to show you
my appreciation.

146
00:07:08,763 --> 00:07:11,230
And to show you
that i haven't even learned

147
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:12,482
how to count to 30 yet.

148
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:26,629
M-mr. Watson.

149
00:07:28,498 --> 00:07:30,383
It... it's my birthday.

150
00:07:30,418 --> 00:07:31,634
Oh.

151
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:39,142
Do any of you happen to be
aware of the annual statement

152
00:07:39,177 --> 00:07:41,010
issued by this organization...

153
00:07:41,644 --> 00:07:42,895
no, sir, no, sir.

154
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,147
...on miss lawson's birthday?

155
00:07:44,182 --> 00:07:46,015
No, sir.

156
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:49,769
Then i'm sure it'll come
as an agreeable surprise

157
00:07:49,804 --> 00:07:52,271
that this company
has just completed

158
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:54,157
the best year in its history.

159
00:07:54,192 --> 00:07:56,659
And i believe that
this department

160
00:07:56,694 --> 00:07:59,162
had no little part
in that success.

161
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:00,413
Oh!

162
00:08:00,448 --> 00:08:02,281
Oh, that's
wonderful.

163
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:05,418
So, as a token of my
personal appreciation,

164
00:08:05,453 --> 00:08:07,920
i think that this
is an appropriate time

165
00:08:07,955 --> 00:08:11,040
to invite all of you
to be my guests

166
00:08:11,075 --> 00:08:12,291
at a celebration party

167
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:14,794
beginning as soon
as we can meet

168
00:08:14,829 --> 00:08:16,679
at the club tiki.

169
00:08:16,714 --> 00:08:18,548
Oh, mr. Watson.

170
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:20,433
Mr. Watson?
Yes?

171
00:08:20,468 --> 00:08:24,187
Mr. Watson,
you are a doll.

172
00:08:24,222 --> 00:08:26,055
Ah. Thank you.

173
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:28,558
And as for you, young lady,

174
00:08:28,593 --> 00:08:32,311
they're not the only ones
who appreciate you.

175
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:34,197
Uh, claudius?

176
00:08:37,985 --> 00:08:39,819
Oh...

177
00:08:39,854 --> 00:08:42,955
happy birthday

178
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:44,457
to the best-looking

179
00:08:44,492 --> 00:08:48,828
and the hardest-working,
secretary i ever had.

180
00:08:48,863 --> 00:08:52,465
Oh, mr. Watson,
they're just beautiful.

181
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,716
Yes.

182
00:08:53,751 --> 00:08:56,219
Oh, thank you,
thank you so much.

183
00:08:56,254 --> 00:08:58,087
Yes.

184
00:08:58,122 --> 00:08:59,972
Hey, let's go, kid,
before the old man

185
00:09:00,007 --> 00:09:02,475
discovers he's off his nut
and has himself committed.

186
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:05,595
I think he's a very
sweet, dear man.

187
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:08,097
Hap... happy
birthday, ann.

188
00:09:08,132 --> 00:09:09,348
Oh, well,
thank you, george.

189
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:11,234
Aren't you coming?

190
00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:13,102
Oh, yeah,
l-i'll be along.

191
00:09:13,137 --> 00:09:14,987
We'll see you there.
Come along, roger.

192
00:09:53,776 --> 00:09:56,896
Maybe i can use it
for an ashtray or something.

193
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:10,660
Hiya, buddy.

194
00:10:11,946 --> 00:10:14,413
Hey, how are you, huh?

195
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:16,916
Come here, attila.
Come on, boy.

196
00:10:16,951 --> 00:10:18,167
Here we go! Ha!

197
00:10:18,801 --> 00:10:20,670
Come on, how was
your day, huh?

198
00:10:20,705 --> 00:10:21,304
Here, look, hey!

199
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:26,309
Here you go, come on, beg.
Sit, sit, up, stand, sit.

200
00:10:26,344 --> 00:10:28,811
Heel, fall, atta boy!

201
00:10:28,846 --> 00:10:31,564
Oh, you ain't but
a good doggie.

202
00:10:31,599 --> 00:10:34,317
Oh, boy, oh, i
love you, attila.

203
00:10:34,352 --> 00:10:38,070
Okay, buddy, let's see
what's going on here, huh?

204
00:10:38,105 --> 00:10:39,322
Go on, go sit.

205
00:10:39,357 --> 00:10:41,190
Huh? There you go.

206
00:10:41,225 --> 00:10:42,441
Ah, there.

207
00:10:47,865 --> 00:10:50,333
Full moon, attila.

208
00:10:50,368 --> 00:10:53,452
Ooh, how are the girls?

209
00:10:54,704 --> 00:10:56,589
Here you go, there you are.

210
00:10:56,624 --> 00:10:58,457
Did you have a good day, too?

211
00:11:00,378 --> 00:11:02,211
Ah... boy.

212
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:05,965
Hmm.

213
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:11,604
Why does it always
happen to me, attila?

214
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:14,724
Come on, boy.

215
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:16,609
Hmm? Why does it
always happen to me?

216
00:11:16,644 --> 00:11:20,112
S-sometimes i think some
people must have been born

217
00:11:20,147 --> 00:11:22,615
with a-a silver spoon
in their mouths.

218
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:24,483
Me, i must have been born
with egg on my face.

219
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:26,235
Huh.

220
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:28,738
Now i didn't
give her any present.

221
00:11:28,773 --> 00:11:32,491
You know, attila, i know
just what people think of me.

222
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:34,744
A patsy, a jerk.

223
00:11:34,779 --> 00:11:38,497
Hmm, hmm...
especially that roger.

224
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:40,383
Sometimes i think
they're right.

225
00:11:40,418 --> 00:11:42,885
George p. Hanley.

226
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:46,005
Jerk.

227
00:11:47,792 --> 00:11:50,259
Hey, attila, what
are you barking at?

228
00:11:50,294 --> 00:11:51,510
That box?

229
00:11:54,397 --> 00:11:55,898
Well, come on, attila,

230
00:11:55,933 --> 00:11:57,767
you can't
bark at the box

231
00:11:57,802 --> 00:12:00,269
and hide in back of the
couch at the same time.

232
00:12:00,304 --> 00:12:03,406
You'll give yourself
some kind of a trauma.

233
00:12:03,441 --> 00:12:04,657
Be brave, boy,

234
00:12:04,692 --> 00:12:05,908
be brave.

235
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:11,530
We're two of a kind, you and me.

236
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:13,416
Come on,

237
00:12:13,451 --> 00:12:15,418
i'll show you.
Be brave, attila.

238
00:12:15,453 --> 00:12:18,037
Be brave! Here, boy.
Come here. Come on, fella.

239
00:12:18,072 --> 00:12:19,922
There you go.

240
00:12:19,957 --> 00:12:21,791
Here, look, i'll show it to you.

241
00:12:21,826 --> 00:12:23,042
Look, see?

242
00:12:23,077 --> 00:12:24,927
It's just a box with a...

243
00:12:24,962 --> 00:12:27,430
with a with a with
a beat-up old lamp in it.

244
00:12:27,465 --> 00:12:29,932
That's all. There.

245
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:33,936
Probably came
from some junkyard.

246
00:12:33,971 --> 00:12:35,187
See?

247
00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:38,941
Magnificent old antique,
of rare distinction.

248
00:12:38,976 --> 00:12:42,061
Boy, if being a jerk
is my vocation,

249
00:12:42,096 --> 00:12:44,563
at least i'm good at it.

250
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:48,317
Gosh... it's so tarnished,
it almost looks black.

251
00:12:48,352 --> 00:12:48,951
Hmm.

252
00:12:50,237 --> 00:12:51,454
Hmm? What's the matter?

253
00:12:53,322 --> 00:12:55,207
Eh, you tell 'em, attila.

254
00:12:55,242 --> 00:12:57,076
Like me, a little late.

255
00:12:57,111 --> 00:12:58,961
Well, let's clean it up.

256
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:05,835
Sure must be old,
if dirt's any sign.

257
00:13:19,348 --> 00:13:22,485
Who... who... who...

258
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,353
who were you expectin'?

259
00:13:24,388 --> 00:13:25,604
Who...?

260
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:28,107
I'm the genie in the lamp,
that's who.

261
00:13:28,142 --> 00:13:30,609
Aladdin, magic, the whole bit.

262
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:32,495
Ge-genie.

263
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:33,746
G-genie?
Yeah.

264
00:13:33,781 --> 00:13:36,248
You-you don't
look like a genie.

265
00:13:36,283 --> 00:13:39,368
Well, what difference
does the wardrobe make?

266
00:13:39,403 --> 00:13:40,619
The routine's the same.

267
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:43,122
You see, a couple
of thousand years ago,

268
00:13:43,157 --> 00:13:46,258
i used to wear those crazy
silk balloon long johns
with the wild turban.

269
00:13:46,293 --> 00:13:48,761
But let me tell
you something, jack.

270
00:13:48,796 --> 00:13:50,012
George.

271
00:13:50,047 --> 00:13:52,515
Jack, george,
as long as you're healthy.

272
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:54,383
Today, we dress
like the times.

273
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:56,268
Except for these.

274
00:13:56,303 --> 00:13:58,137
Velveteen mukluks.

275
00:13:58,172 --> 00:13:59,388
Mukluks.

276
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,890
Mm-hmm.

277
00:14:00,925 --> 00:14:02,141
Genie.

278
00:14:02,176 --> 00:14:04,026
If-if you
are the genie,

279
00:14:04,061 --> 00:14:07,780
then i must be the
master of the lamp.

280
00:14:07,815 --> 00:14:10,149
Big deal, master of the lamp.

281
00:14:10,184 --> 00:14:12,651
All right,
you got yourself a free wish.

282
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:15,154
There's supposed
to be three wishes.

283
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:16,789
Ah, there's the rub.

284
00:14:16,824 --> 00:14:18,657
There used to be three wishes.

285
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:21,794
But let me tell you
something, jack.

286
00:14:21,829 --> 00:14:23,412
George.

287
00:14:23,447 --> 00:14:25,798
You don't want
to change your name, huh?

288
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,049
Uh...

289
00:14:27,084 --> 00:14:29,552
the scene used
to include three wishes,

290
00:14:29,587 --> 00:14:32,671
but the recipients
were abusing the privilege,

291
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:33,923
so we had to cut down.

292
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:36,425
So, uh, give it
a little thought.

293
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,676
Give me a call.

294
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:39,562
But do me a favor, will you?

295
00:14:39,597 --> 00:14:40,813
Sleep on it.

296
00:14:40,848 --> 00:14:41,931
Sleep on it?

297
00:14:41,966 --> 00:14:43,816
Yeah, you know
the routine.

298
00:14:43,851 --> 00:14:46,936
Once you make the wish, that's
what you have to live with.

299
00:14:46,971 --> 00:14:49,438
What do people
usually wish for?

300
00:14:49,473 --> 00:14:52,575
Oh, let me tell
you something, jack-

301
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:53,826
george.

302
00:14:53,861 --> 00:14:55,077
The wildest.

303
00:14:55,112 --> 00:14:57,580
Oh, it's enough
to make you blush.

304
00:14:57,615 --> 00:14:59,448
A fortune, they wish for.

305
00:14:59,483 --> 00:15:01,333
Money, precious jewels...

306
00:15:01,368 --> 00:15:03,202
that's not so bad.

307
00:15:03,237 --> 00:15:05,087
It's not so bad, huh?

308
00:15:05,122 --> 00:15:06,956
You see, you're
no different
from the rest.

309
00:15:06,991 --> 00:15:09,458
All right, you get yourself
a lot of riches, a lot of dough.

310
00:15:09,493 --> 00:15:12,595
Now you're in trouble
with the internal revenue.

311
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:16,348
You got a lot
of phony charities
come buggin' you.

312
00:15:16,383 --> 00:15:18,350
Long-lost relatives come banging
at your door.

313
00:15:18,385 --> 00:15:20,219
It's enough to make you
flip your gourd.

314
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:22,104
Not-not wealth, huh?

315
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:24,473
Forget the wealth.

316
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:27,726
Maybe... love.

317
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:29,111
Love?

318
00:15:29,146 --> 00:15:31,614
That's what you'd wish for?

319
00:15:31,649 --> 00:15:34,116
What are you,
some kind of a kook?

320
00:15:34,151 --> 00:15:35,734
You call me back
from 2,000 years

321
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:38,237
to come and help you
and you wish for love?

322
00:15:38,272 --> 00:15:41,874
You don't wish for love, jack,
you find it.

323
00:15:41,909 --> 00:15:46,495
But i'm not really sure
what it is i want.

324
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:49,632
And if it isn't wealth or love,

325
00:15:49,667 --> 00:15:51,500
i... i don't know.

326
00:15:51,535 --> 00:15:54,503
Well, like i told you,
give it a little thought, huh?

327
00:15:55,137 --> 00:15:58,257
Ponder, drop it down the well
a couple of times,

328
00:15:58,292 --> 00:15:59,508
see if it splashes.

329
00:15:59,543 --> 00:16:02,645
But don't go rubbing that lamp
every time you get a bug,

330
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,513
'cause that smoke is murder
on my sinus.

331
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:08,651
The next time i make
the scene, that's it.

332
00:16:08,686 --> 00:16:10,519
Like, later...

333
00:16:10,554 --> 00:16:12,404
george.

334
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,784
I can't believe it.

335
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:30,172
Anything i want
in the whole world.

336
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:32,041
Anything!

337
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:40,799
But only one wish.

338
00:16:44,553 --> 00:16:45,804
Which one, attila?

339
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,439
Which one?

340
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:58,650
A million dollars.

341
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:02,404
No, he's right,
that's the 90% bracket.

342
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:04,289
Love?

343
00:17:04,324 --> 00:17:05,541
Too risky.

344
00:17:07,409 --> 00:17:09,294
George hanley...

345
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:11,797
first man on the moon.

346
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:16,168
George hanley...

347
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:17,419
scientist.

348
00:17:20,556 --> 00:17:23,058
General george p. Hanley...

349
00:17:23,093 --> 00:17:25,561
commander of the armies.

350
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:29,932
What if, what if
i were married to ann?

351
00:17:29,967 --> 00:17:33,068
What if... what if she were
some kind of a...

352
00:17:33,103 --> 00:17:36,822
some kind of a movie actress,
and i were her husband?

353
00:17:36,857 --> 00:17:39,324
That would be killing two birds
with one stone.

354
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:41,193
George...

355
00:17:41,228 --> 00:17:44,947
george hanley,
husband of-of ann...

356
00:17:44,982 --> 00:17:46,198
ann alexandra.

357
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:48,083
America's sweethearts.

358
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,586
The perfect couple.

359
00:17:50,621 --> 00:17:52,454
How about that?

360
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:54,339
Yeah...

361
00:17:54,374 --> 00:17:56,842
yeah, how about that?

362
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,596
Remember, miss alexandra,

363
00:18:00,631 --> 00:18:02,464
you love the guy so much

364
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:05,601
that you do
a loop-the-loop

365
00:18:05,636 --> 00:18:08,720
as soon as you smell
his after-shave lotion.

366
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:09,972
I'll try.

367
00:18:10,007 --> 00:18:11,857
Oh, darling.

368
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:15,611
Hello, dear.

369
00:18:15,646 --> 00:18:16,862
Ooh, ooh, ooh-

370
00:18:16,897 --> 00:18:18,113
makeup, georgie.

371
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:19,982
Oh...

372
00:18:20,017 --> 00:18:22,484
you wouldn't want me
to play my final scene

373
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:23,735
with smeared
lipstick, would you?

374
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,621
No, i guess not.

375
00:18:25,656 --> 00:18:26,738
Final scene?

376
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:28,624
Mm-hmm.

377
00:18:28,659 --> 00:18:31,126
It's been a long grind.

378
00:18:31,161 --> 00:18:34,246
They said you could have
a couple of weeks off,

379
00:18:34,281 --> 00:18:36,748
but that was six months ago.

380
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:38,000
Well...

381
00:18:38,035 --> 00:18:41,136
we could take
our honeymoon now.

382
00:18:41,171 --> 00:18:43,639
If you want to, that is.

383
00:18:43,674 --> 00:18:45,507
Want to?

384
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:46,758
Oh.

385
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:48,644
Ooh, georgie.

386
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:52,397
Makeup all day,
beauty creams all night.

387
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:56,768
Well, they don't pay a movie
star to look ugly, baby.

388
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:58,654
Besides...

389
00:18:58,689 --> 00:19:01,156
don't you think i'm
worth waiting for?

390
00:19:01,191 --> 00:19:04,276
Yeah, sure, but six months...

391
00:19:05,527 --> 00:19:07,412
places, please!

392
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:09,281
Be right there.

393
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:14,920
I won't be long.

394
00:19:24,546 --> 00:19:27,049
Oh, what a day!

395
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:33,305
Trying, endless day...

396
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,807
tonight, no... no
crawling into bed

397
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:39,561
right after dinner
to study your lines.

398
00:19:39,596 --> 00:19:42,698
And tomorrow morning,
no getting up at 4:30 a.m.

399
00:19:42,733 --> 00:19:45,817
To get to the
studio for makeup.

400
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:50,205
Oh, i like that face
just the way it is.

401
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:55,577
Oh, oh, i'm
sorry, darling.

402
00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:57,713
It's just
that i'm worn out

403
00:19:57,748 --> 00:20:01,466
from that ersatz d.w. Griffith
howling at me all day.

404
00:20:01,501 --> 00:20:03,335
I thought you liked him.

405
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:04,586
Yes, i suppose.

406
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:07,089
But he is so noisy.

407
00:20:07,124 --> 00:20:10,842
He always seems to measure
virility by decibels.

408
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:14,596
Well, i guess maybe
he'll be quieter

409
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:16,481
at the party tonight.

410
00:20:16,516 --> 00:20:18,350
What party?

411
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:19,601
Oh, did you forget?

412
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:22,738
The celebration party
on the set tonight.

413
00:20:22,773 --> 00:20:24,606
Oh, yeah.

414
00:20:27,743 --> 00:20:30,245
We'll... leave
the party early.

415
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:34,750
Oh!
Oh!

416
00:20:34,785 --> 00:20:37,252
Oh, gee!
Oh, georgie.

417
00:20:37,287 --> 00:20:39,755
Oh, dear.

418
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:42,874
Here, kiss me
right up there.

419
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:45,010
Oop! Be careful
of the hair, darling.
All right.

420
00:20:45,045 --> 00:20:47,512
There'll be a million
photographers there tonight,

421
00:20:47,547 --> 00:20:50,015
and andre will have a
convulsion if it's ruined.

422
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:51,016
There!

423
00:20:51,051 --> 00:20:53,518
Andre should carry
medical insurance.

424
00:20:53,553 --> 00:20:54,770
Now!

425
00:20:54,805 --> 00:20:58,523
What i want
is a nice, hot bath

426
00:20:59,141 --> 00:21:00,392
for about an hour.

427
00:21:01,643 --> 00:21:02,894
Would you like me
to rub your back?

428
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:05,397
No, thank you, darling.

429
00:21:05,432 --> 00:21:07,282
You know what
you could do for me?

430
00:21:07,317 --> 00:21:09,151
You could take the dog
for a walk.

431
00:21:09,186 --> 00:21:11,653
He's been cooped up all day.

432
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:21,663
Hi, boy, how are you?

433
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:25,417
There we go,
that's a good boy.

434
00:21:25,452 --> 00:21:27,919
Come on, there
we go, attila.

435
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:29,171
That a boy.

436
00:21:29,206 --> 00:21:31,673
Let's go for a
little walk, huh?

437
00:21:39,181 --> 00:21:42,317
George! George boy!

438
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:44,186
Hi.

439
00:21:44,221 --> 00:21:45,437
I want to talk to you.

440
00:21:45,472 --> 00:21:47,939
Ann mentioned something
about you needing a vacation.

441
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:49,825
Oh, not me. Her.

442
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,076
Both of us together.

443
00:21:51,111 --> 00:21:52,327
I'm not going
to mince words.

444
00:21:52,362 --> 00:21:57,332
You got to say it's okay for ann
to do my next picturebeowulf.

445
00:21:57,949 --> 00:22:01,086
Not a chance, eli.
It's our honeymoon.

446
00:22:01,121 --> 00:22:02,954
Great. I'm shootingbeowulf
on location-

447
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:04,206
make a great honeymoon.

448
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:06,708
Some honeymoon, hmm?

449
00:22:06,743 --> 00:22:10,462
Makeup call at 4:30 a.m.,
work all day,

450
00:22:10,497 --> 00:22:12,347
study lines all night.

451
00:22:12,382 --> 00:22:14,850
Do you know the last time i saw
her in the last six months

452
00:22:14,885 --> 00:22:16,101
when she wasn't sleeping

453
00:22:16,136 --> 00:22:20,472
she was getting herself swabbed
with makeup, beauty creams,

454
00:22:20,507 --> 00:22:22,357
rinses or some junk like that.

455
00:22:22,392 --> 00:22:24,226
She's a star.

456
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,111
You wouldn't want her
photographed

457
00:22:26,146 --> 00:22:27,979
with bags under eyes
or wrinkles.

458
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:31,116
All i want is to see her alone
with bags or wrinkles.

459
00:22:31,151 --> 00:22:33,618
You want the world's most
beautiful woman for a wife,

460
00:22:34,236 --> 00:22:35,487
you got to share her
with the world.

461
00:22:35,522 --> 00:22:37,122
I did for six months.

462
00:22:37,157 --> 00:22:38,990
Now i want the world
to share her back.

463
00:22:39,241 --> 00:22:42,994
Son... it's not for myself,

464
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:46,131
but no ann, nobeowulf.

465
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:47,999
But there are other stars.

466
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:51,753
Not like ann alexandra.

467
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:55,507
Millions of plain folks
all over the world

468
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:56,758
wait to see her.

469
00:22:56,793 --> 00:22:59,261
Little kids count their pennies.

470
00:22:59,296 --> 00:23:03,648
Mothers go without lunch.

471
00:23:03,683 --> 00:23:08,653
And brave men sacrifice even
the tiny luxury of a cigarette

472
00:23:08,688 --> 00:23:11,156
so they can buy a ticket
to a movie theater

473
00:23:11,191 --> 00:23:16,161
and escape the drab
drudgery of an
uncaring world

474
00:23:16,196 --> 00:23:21,166
watching their idol
ann alexandra.

475
00:23:21,201 --> 00:23:22,417
Looking like a fairy tale,

476
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:26,788
doing all the things they dream
but never get to do.

477
00:23:26,823 --> 00:23:29,291
I know.

478
00:23:29,326 --> 00:23:31,176
Well, then, george,

479
00:23:31,211 --> 00:23:33,678
couldn't you find it
in your heart

480
00:23:33,713 --> 00:23:38,049
to make this
one little sacrifice?

481
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:41,803
You're right, mr. Watson.

482
00:23:44,306 --> 00:23:48,693
I'll... i'll tell her
to do the picture.

483
00:23:48,728 --> 00:23:51,813
We'll make the sacrifice
together.

484
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:21,226
Ann, darling, you
look magnificent!

485
00:24:21,261 --> 00:24:23,728
You, too.

486
00:24:23,763 --> 00:24:26,848
Well, please, please,
i'd like to make
an announcement.

487
00:24:26,883 --> 00:24:28,733
Better yet, i'll
make it a toast.

488
00:24:29,351 --> 00:24:30,602
Thanks, old man.

489
00:24:30,637 --> 00:24:34,990
To the brightest star,
the most exciting
leading lady...

490
00:24:35,025 --> 00:24:37,492
the loveliest
woman in the world.

491
00:24:37,527 --> 00:24:39,995
Ann alexandra,
who has just agreed

492
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:41,863
to star with me
inbeowulf!

493
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:46,001
Congratulations.

494
00:24:46,036 --> 00:24:48,503
Now, darling,
remember the makeup.

495
00:24:48,538 --> 00:24:51,006
Besides, i'm not
as good in profile.

496
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:07,022
Hey, stop, thief!

497
00:25:07,057 --> 00:25:08,890
Who's that?

498
00:25:08,925 --> 00:25:10,775
Me, mister.

499
00:25:14,564 --> 00:25:16,398
You hiding?

500
00:25:16,433 --> 00:25:17,649
I snap something.

501
00:25:17,684 --> 00:25:20,785
Nobody down
on this level yet.

502
00:25:23,323 --> 00:25:24,539
Uh...

503
00:25:26,408 --> 00:25:28,910
you make
your repairs?

504
00:25:28,945 --> 00:25:31,413
Always i have
the accidents.

505
00:25:31,448 --> 00:25:35,550
It is because i am-
how you say?
Too much prone?

506
00:25:35,585 --> 00:25:38,053
Would you like
your drink now?

507
00:25:38,088 --> 00:25:40,555
No, no, that
is just to hold.

508
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:43,058
I am under the age.

509
00:25:43,093 --> 00:25:44,309
Under the age?

510
00:25:44,344 --> 00:25:46,811
To drink.

511
00:25:46,846 --> 00:25:48,680
I have this
terrible problem.

512
00:25:48,715 --> 00:25:51,816
You see, in the
years, i am a child,

513
00:25:51,851 --> 00:25:54,319
but i think i am mature.

514
00:25:54,936 --> 00:25:57,439
Don't you think i am...

515
00:25:57,474 --> 00:25:58,690
mature?

516
00:25:58,725 --> 00:26:01,192
Yeah, i think you're mature.

517
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:06,197
You are producer, no?

518
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:08,083
Me? No.

519
00:26:08,118 --> 00:26:09,951
Director?

520
00:26:09,986 --> 00:26:11,202
Mm-mm.

521
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:13,088
Writer?

522
00:26:13,123 --> 00:26:14,956
Sorry.

523
00:26:14,991 --> 00:26:17,459
Then l-i cannot
guess who you are.

524
00:26:17,494 --> 00:26:19,961
I'm george hanley.

525
00:26:19,996 --> 00:26:21,846
Who?

526
00:26:21,881 --> 00:26:24,349
Ann alexandra's husband.

527
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:26,968
Well, for pete's sake,

528
00:26:27,003 --> 00:26:28,853
give me back my drink!

529
00:26:28,888 --> 00:26:30,105
That's what you deserve

530
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:32,607
for wasting my time,
mr. Alexander.

531
00:26:49,491 --> 00:26:51,993
Now, aren't you glad
you're here tonight?

532
00:26:52,028 --> 00:26:53,878
Don't be egotistical.

533
00:26:54,496 --> 00:26:56,998
I had to be here, anyway.

534
00:26:57,033 --> 00:27:00,135
I don't understand you.

535
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:02,637
No man is supposed to.

536
00:27:03,254 --> 00:27:05,757
That's the way
we little girls are.

537
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:08,259
Well, that part
i understand.

538
00:27:15,517 --> 00:27:19,020
Mmm, i'll spoil
your makeup.

539
00:27:19,055 --> 00:27:20,905
Who cares?

540
00:27:32,033 --> 00:27:34,536
Ooh, oh.

541
00:27:34,571 --> 00:27:35,537
Oh, boy.

542
00:27:35,572 --> 00:27:37,422
Whew! I'm okay, boy.

543
00:27:37,457 --> 00:27:39,924
Wow, what a dream.

544
00:27:40,542 --> 00:27:42,427
You know something, attila?

545
00:27:42,462 --> 00:27:44,929
The trouble for a guy like me

546
00:27:44,964 --> 00:27:49,300
is that... when i want
something so much,

547
00:27:49,335 --> 00:27:53,054
it would hurt that much more
to lose it.

548
00:27:53,089 --> 00:27:56,191
Let's face it, l-i would
lose a wife like that.

549
00:27:56,226 --> 00:27:59,310
But i still got you, huh, boy?

550
00:27:59,345 --> 00:28:01,196
Yeah, you still love me.

551
00:28:03,099 --> 00:28:06,201
Well, at least
it makes it easier to choose.

552
00:28:06,236 --> 00:28:08,703
All i have to decide now

553
00:28:08,738 --> 00:28:12,457
is between the two other things
i've always wanted.

554
00:28:12,492 --> 00:28:14,959
Yeah. Hmm.

555
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:28,590
Twilight zonewill continue
after station identification.

556
00:28:50,412 --> 00:28:52,914
Good morning, george.

557
00:28:54,783 --> 00:28:56,668
George?

558
00:28:57,919 --> 00:28:59,788
Morning, rog.

559
00:28:59,823 --> 00:29:01,673
Morning.

560
00:29:08,581 --> 00:29:11,049
Well, today's
the day.

561
00:29:11,084 --> 00:29:13,551
For what, rog?

562
00:29:13,586 --> 00:29:15,437
What's got
into you?

563
00:29:15,472 --> 00:29:16,688
Me?

564
00:29:16,723 --> 00:29:18,556
All i said
was "morning, rog"

565
00:29:18,591 --> 00:29:21,693
and "for
what, rog?"

566
00:29:21,728 --> 00:29:24,195
I don't think
those are very
pregnant phrases.

567
00:29:26,064 --> 00:29:29,200
You're real feisty
this morning, aren't you,
georgie, old porgie?

568
00:29:29,235 --> 00:29:31,703
Hey, has watson said anything
to you about the promotion?

569
00:29:31,738 --> 00:29:34,205
Oh, the promotion.
I forgot about that.

570
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,457
Huh, yeah, i'll bet.

571
00:29:35,492 --> 00:29:36,708
Yes, sir.
Roger?
Hmm?

572
00:29:36,743 --> 00:29:40,462
Mr. Watson wants you
in his office right away.

573
00:29:40,497 --> 00:29:42,330
Oh, right away.

574
00:29:44,833 --> 00:29:46,718
This could be it.

575
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:52,340
Well...

576
00:29:52,375 --> 00:29:54,225
over the top.

577
00:29:57,345 --> 00:30:00,482
They'd never pick him.

578
00:30:00,517 --> 00:30:01,733
Never.

579
00:30:05,487 --> 00:30:09,240
George? The old boy
wants another check
on all these entries.

580
00:30:09,275 --> 00:30:11,109
For what?
A new account,
personal.

581
00:30:11,144 --> 00:30:12,994
Hey, this guy is so
loaded, he could pay off

582
00:30:13,029 --> 00:30:14,245
the national debt
out of petty cash.

583
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,748
But didn't you check those
entries after you made them?

584
00:30:16,783 --> 00:30:17,365
Well, sure!

585
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,868
Well, then why do we
have to do it again?

586
00:30:19,903 --> 00:30:22,370
That's not efficiency.
That's a waste of time.

587
00:30:22,405 --> 00:30:24,005
George...

588
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,874
how much do you make a week?

589
00:30:25,909 --> 00:30:28,510
Same as you, $98.50.

590
00:30:28,545 --> 00:30:29,878
Well, this joker makes
so much dough

591
00:30:29,913 --> 00:30:31,763
that he sweats more than $98.50

592
00:30:31,798 --> 00:30:33,631
every time he ties
his shoelaces.

593
00:30:33,666 --> 00:30:37,385
So, uh, waste
a little time, hmm?

594
00:30:57,405 --> 00:30:59,908
What about this wealth bit?

595
00:30:59,943 --> 00:31:03,661
I mean, even with
90% off for taxes,

596
00:31:03,696 --> 00:31:06,798
there, there'd still be
something left over.

597
00:31:06,833 --> 00:31:08,666
George hanley...

598
00:31:08,701 --> 00:31:12,420
no, make it g. Peter hanley...

599
00:31:12,455 --> 00:31:14,305
tycoon.

600
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:17,425
G. Peter hanley,
captain of industry.

601
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:20,562
Crown prince
of financial royalty.

602
00:31:20,597 --> 00:31:23,681
G. Peter hanley, rich guy.

603
00:31:30,572 --> 00:31:33,074
Beautiful day,
isn't it, sir?

604
00:31:33,109 --> 00:31:34,943
It'll do, it'll do.

605
00:31:34,978 --> 00:31:38,079
Will you be wanting me
for lunch, sir?

606
00:31:38,114 --> 00:31:39,948
I can't say,
but you'd better

607
00:31:39,983 --> 00:31:42,450
keep yourself available,
just in case...

608
00:31:42,485 --> 00:31:43,701
roger.

609
00:31:43,736 --> 00:31:45,587
Yes, sir.

610
00:31:50,126 --> 00:31:52,594
No, no, we
can't play now, boy.

611
00:31:52,629 --> 00:31:55,713
I'm so sorry, i couldn't
hold him, mr. Hanley.

612
00:31:55,748 --> 00:31:58,216
Yes. Roger, you better take
attila over to "21"

613
00:31:58,251 --> 00:32:00,718
and have the chef fix him up
a nice prime rib of beef, huh?

614
00:32:00,753 --> 00:32:02,604
Yes.
Oh, and not too fatty.

615
00:32:02,639 --> 00:32:03,855
Yes, sir.
Oh, also,

616
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:06,357
you better trot him
around the block
a couple of times.

617
00:32:06,392 --> 00:32:08,860
His appetite's
a bit jaded.
Yes, sir.

618
00:32:08,895 --> 00:32:10,728
Atta boy.

619
00:32:10,763 --> 00:32:13,231
Come on, boy.
Come on, boy.

620
00:32:14,482 --> 00:32:16,367
Paper, sir? Paper?

621
00:32:16,985 --> 00:32:18,236
Son...

622
00:32:18,271 --> 00:32:20,121
how old are you?

623
00:32:20,156 --> 00:32:21,372
Nine, sir.

624
00:32:21,407 --> 00:32:23,491
I see you here every morning.

625
00:32:23,526 --> 00:32:25,994
Don't you miss school?

626
00:32:26,029 --> 00:32:28,496
Oh, no, sir.
I wouldn't miss school.

627
00:32:28,531 --> 00:32:30,999
I get up at 5:00 for my papers,

628
00:32:31,034 --> 00:32:33,501
then i go to the afternoon
session at p.s. 31.

629
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:36,638
Incredible.

630
00:32:36,673 --> 00:32:38,506
What do your parents say?

631
00:32:38,541 --> 00:32:42,260
My mom is dead.

632
00:32:42,295 --> 00:32:46,014
My old man had a store,
but it went broke.

633
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:50,401
I'm sorry, son.

634
00:32:50,436 --> 00:32:51,653
I'll have that paper.

635
00:32:51,688 --> 00:32:52,904
Yes, sir.

636
00:32:54,772 --> 00:32:59,160
Gosh, i can't change $100 bill.

637
00:32:59,195 --> 00:33:01,663
I didn't expect you to, son.

638
00:33:27,555 --> 00:33:28,806
Good morning,
mr. Hanley.

639
00:33:28,841 --> 00:33:30,692
Trl-electronics, up 7/8
on the morning ticker.

640
00:33:30,727 --> 00:33:32,560
Glad to have
you back, sir.

641
00:33:32,595 --> 00:33:33,811
Thank you,
thank you.

642
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:38,199
How was
the riviera, sir?

643
00:33:38,234 --> 00:33:40,068
All right, i guess.

644
00:33:40,103 --> 00:33:43,204
It's kind of like
a suburban tract,

645
00:33:43,239 --> 00:33:45,073
only all castles.

646
00:33:48,826 --> 00:33:50,712
Gay social whirl,
was it, sir?

647
00:33:50,747 --> 00:33:55,717
I was about whirled out
after the first six parties.

648
00:33:55,752 --> 00:34:01,339
They even gave one
to celebrate the
incoming of the tide.

649
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:04,475
Miss lawson, would
you take care of these?
They're a bit soiled.

650
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:07,595
Certainly, mr. Hanley.

651
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,598
Can't they
be cleaned?

652
00:34:10,633 --> 00:34:11,849
We throw them away, sir.

653
00:34:11,884 --> 00:34:13,735
In your tax bracket,
it's cheaper.

654
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:14,986
I suppose, i suppose.

655
00:34:15,021 --> 00:34:16,854
Shall i start
the people in, sir?

656
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:18,106
Yes, you might as well.

657
00:34:18,141 --> 00:34:19,357
Very good, sir.

658
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:30,251
Dr. Watson...

659
00:34:32,754 --> 00:34:34,622
what brings you here, sir?

660
00:34:34,657 --> 00:34:36,507
Begging again,
i'm afraid.

661
00:34:36,542 --> 00:34:39,627
These days, a college
president is much
more concerned

662
00:34:40,261 --> 00:34:42,764
with salesmanship
than scholarship.

663
00:34:42,799 --> 00:34:43,381
Sit.

664
00:34:43,416 --> 00:34:44,632
Thank you, george.

665
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:55,893
You've come
to the right man, sir.

666
00:34:55,928 --> 00:35:00,281
George, you've already done
more for your alma mater

667
00:35:00,316 --> 00:35:03,401
than we have a right to ask.

668
00:35:03,436 --> 00:35:05,903
This is an emergency,
or i wouldn't be here.

669
00:35:05,938 --> 00:35:07,155
How much, sir?

670
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:08,906
Too much, but i'm hoping

671
00:35:08,941 --> 00:35:11,409
you'll be able
to start the ball rolling.

672
00:35:11,444 --> 00:35:13,544
Don't be coy with me, sir.

673
00:35:13,579 --> 00:35:15,413
How much?

674
00:35:15,448 --> 00:35:18,166
All together, 1,200,000.

675
00:35:18,201 --> 00:35:21,919
Now, if you could possibly
start us off

676
00:35:21,954 --> 00:35:24,422
with, say, uh,
ten or 20,000...

677
00:35:26,307 --> 00:35:27,558
you've got it.

678
00:35:27,593 --> 00:35:29,677
You're a generous man, g.p.

679
00:35:29,712 --> 00:35:31,562
We're all in your debt.

680
00:35:32,814 --> 00:35:34,682
George...

681
00:35:34,717 --> 00:35:36,567
you've made a mistake.

682
00:35:36,602 --> 00:35:39,687
No, sir, i've always been
rather good with figures.

683
00:35:39,722 --> 00:35:42,824
It's the entire sum,
1,200,000.

684
00:35:42,859 --> 00:35:44,075
Deductible.

685
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:46,194
No, george, i can't take this.

686
00:35:46,229 --> 00:35:47,445
But i want to give it.

687
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,330
So would others, george.

688
00:35:49,365 --> 00:35:53,701
Thousands of alumni, not as
successful, not as fortunate.

689
00:35:53,736 --> 00:35:56,204
But every bit as generous.

690
00:35:56,239 --> 00:35:59,957
Giving, sharing the burden
and the satisfaction

691
00:35:59,992 --> 00:36:03,711
is the cement which
binds their minds and hearts

692
00:36:03,746 --> 00:36:06,214
to our beloved alma mater.

693
00:36:06,249 --> 00:36:08,716
I can't let you
deprive them

694
00:36:08,751 --> 00:36:11,219
of the great privilege
of giving.

695
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:15,973
I was only trying
to help, sir.

696
00:36:16,008 --> 00:36:18,726
This isn't generosity, g.p.

697
00:36:18,761 --> 00:36:20,611
It's ostentation.

698
00:36:20,646 --> 00:36:22,480
I'm sorry.

699
00:36:24,365 --> 00:36:26,234
What should i do?

700
00:36:26,269 --> 00:36:30,621
Send me your check for
the 20,000 i asked for.

701
00:36:30,656 --> 00:36:32,490
Thank you.

702
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:34,992
Thank you.

703
00:36:35,027 --> 00:36:36,244
Don't mention it.

704
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:56,264
Well, sir, ready to see
how the old empire's faring?

705
00:36:56,299 --> 00:36:57,515
I suppose so.
A few little
items here

706
00:36:57,550 --> 00:37:00,017
i thought you wouldn't
want to miss, mr. Hanley.

707
00:37:00,052 --> 00:37:01,269
I thought
i already owned one

708
00:37:01,304 --> 00:37:02,520
of just about
everything ever made.

709
00:37:03,154 --> 00:37:04,405
Ah, you can't keep up

710
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,274
with yankee
ingenuity and productivity.

711
00:37:06,309 --> 00:37:09,410
We've got to buckle down
to some serious spending.

712
00:37:09,445 --> 00:37:11,279
We can't let you have
too much cash available,

713
00:37:11,314 --> 00:37:13,164
otherwise,
the government's liable

714
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:14,415
to invent a new tax bracket.

715
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:15,666
Now...

716
00:37:15,701 --> 00:37:19,921
here we have
a handsome little yacht.

717
00:37:19,956 --> 00:37:23,174
But i already own
a 94-footer docked
up at newport.

718
00:37:23,209 --> 00:37:26,928
This one makes that
look like a dinghy.
Handsome, isn't it?

719
00:37:26,963 --> 00:37:29,046
You know something,
masters?

720
00:37:29,081 --> 00:37:33,935
Buying things isn't
any fun for me anymore.

721
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:37,688
Before i had money,
i, i used to look forward

722
00:37:37,723 --> 00:37:39,557
to buying a secondhand car

723
00:37:39,592 --> 00:37:43,311
like a... like a... kid
waiting for christmas.

724
00:37:43,346 --> 00:37:47,698
Now there's no anticipation,
there's no hungering.

725
00:37:48,316 --> 00:37:49,567
I... i just write checks.

726
00:37:49,602 --> 00:37:52,069
Ah, you're feeling blue,
mr. Hanley.

727
00:37:52,104 --> 00:37:54,322
I used to enjoy little things

728
00:37:54,357 --> 00:37:58,709
like... an ice cream cone
when it was hot,

729
00:37:58,744 --> 00:38:00,578
a ball game...

730
00:38:00,613 --> 00:38:04,332
getting out of the apartment
for a walk in the park.

731
00:38:04,367 --> 00:38:06,834
Now every time i go
for a walk in the park,

732
00:38:06,869 --> 00:38:09,971
four people come up and ask me
when i'm going to subdivide it.

733
00:38:10,006 --> 00:38:13,724
Masters, i'm going to quit
buying things.

734
00:38:13,759 --> 00:38:15,226
That's subversive, sir.

735
00:38:15,261 --> 00:38:16,844
I beg your pardon?

736
00:38:16,879 --> 00:38:18,729
That's
un-american.

737
00:38:18,764 --> 00:38:20,481
Salesmanship is our way of life.

738
00:38:20,516 --> 00:38:22,984
Think of those men living
on blue sky and a prayer,

739
00:38:23,019 --> 00:38:25,486
depending on you
for their daily commission.

740
00:38:25,521 --> 00:38:27,355
They've got little ones,
mouths to feed.

741
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:30,992
No, mr. Hanley, you can't
stop buying, ever.

742
00:38:31,027 --> 00:38:32,360
Buying is your destiny.

743
00:38:32,395 --> 00:38:35,496
Don't waver now.
Do your duty, mr. Hanley.

744
00:38:35,531 --> 00:38:36,864
Do your duty.

745
00:38:36,899 --> 00:38:38,749
Congratulate me, george.

746
00:38:38,784 --> 00:38:41,252
Hey, george, i said
congratulate me.

747
00:38:41,287 --> 00:38:43,120
Con... congratulateyou?

748
00:38:43,155 --> 00:38:45,623
Gentlemen,
you are now looking

749
00:38:45,658 --> 00:38:47,508
at the new
head bookkeeper

750
00:38:47,543 --> 00:38:49,377
of this entire
organization.

751
00:38:49,412 --> 00:38:51,262
Congratulations.

752
00:38:51,297 --> 00:38:53,130
Very nice.
Congratulations, roger.

753
00:38:53,165 --> 00:38:55,633
Oh, thank you, thank
you, thank you.

754
00:38:55,668 --> 00:38:58,135
But the first
thing i want to
tell you guys

755
00:38:58,170 --> 00:38:59,387
is i intend to
keep my vow-

756
00:38:59,422 --> 00:39:01,272
no more lousy
lunches at nick's.

757
00:39:03,175 --> 00:39:05,026
Him...

758
00:39:05,061 --> 00:39:06,894
they gave it to him.

759
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:10,648
He wasn't even a good chauffeur.

760
00:39:37,475 --> 00:39:38,726
Well...

761
00:39:39,977 --> 00:39:43,097
we're down to
the last wish, attila.

762
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:47,351
I'd never keep a beautiful wife.

763
00:39:47,386 --> 00:39:51,739
And money... money's no fun
if you have everything.

764
00:39:51,774 --> 00:39:54,241
You just sit around
and look at it.

765
00:39:54,276 --> 00:39:56,110
Position.

766
00:39:56,145 --> 00:39:59,864
Power, that's-that's what makes
the world go 'round these days.

767
00:39:59,899 --> 00:40:03,000
Look at mr. Watson,
how he gave roger that job, huh?

768
00:40:04,286 --> 00:40:08,622
Believe me, if-if i
had power, i'd be fair.

769
00:40:10,508 --> 00:40:13,010
What do you think, attila?

770
00:40:13,045 --> 00:40:16,764
Do we dare wish
that third thing?

771
00:40:19,266 --> 00:40:20,518
Power.

772
00:40:20,553 --> 00:40:21,769
Prerogative.

773
00:40:21,804 --> 00:40:23,020
Push.

774
00:40:23,055 --> 00:40:24,271
Why not?

775
00:40:24,306 --> 00:40:26,774
George hanley, statesman.

776
00:40:26,809 --> 00:40:29,276
G.p. Hanley,
controller of destinies.

777
00:40:29,311 --> 00:40:32,396
George p. Hanley,
thegeorge p. Hanley.

778
00:40:32,431 --> 00:40:34,281
Leader of men.

779
00:40:43,407 --> 00:40:47,161
Oh, sir, you'll be exhausted.

780
00:40:47,196 --> 00:40:50,297
Let me tell them
to hurry on to the airport.

781
00:40:50,332 --> 00:40:52,166
Watson...

782
00:40:52,201 --> 00:40:55,302
these people elected me.

783
00:40:55,337 --> 00:40:59,423
They have placed
in these humble hands

784
00:40:59,458 --> 00:41:03,177
their individual destinies.

785
00:41:03,212 --> 00:41:05,062
I think it only fitting

786
00:41:05,097 --> 00:41:08,816
that they see just what kind
of destiny they're getting.

787
00:41:08,851 --> 00:41:11,936
They're getting the best,
mr. President.

788
00:41:11,971 --> 00:41:13,687
Thank you, watson.

789
00:41:13,722 --> 00:41:15,573
Thank you.

790
00:41:15,608 --> 00:41:19,326
That means a great deal
to me, coming from you.

791
00:41:23,732 --> 00:41:25,583
Very good, mr. Ambassador.

792
00:41:25,618 --> 00:41:27,451
I agree.

793
00:41:27,486 --> 00:41:29,954
No, there is nothing new
in our crisis.

794
00:41:29,989 --> 00:41:31,839
Yes, sir.

795
00:41:31,874 --> 00:41:33,707
Very good.

796
00:41:33,742 --> 00:41:35,593
We are in agreement.

797
00:41:35,628 --> 00:41:37,461
Yes, sir, very good.

798
00:41:37,496 --> 00:41:39,346
Then go ahead, sir.

799
00:41:39,381 --> 00:41:40,598
Mr. President,

800
00:41:40,633 --> 00:41:43,717
this pension legislation
will tear the party in two.

801
00:41:43,752 --> 00:41:45,853
If you let it come to the floor,
i for one won't get

802
00:41:45,888 --> 00:41:48,355
a single vote in november from
anyone over the age of ten.

803
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:50,224
Have you checked
with the majority leader

804
00:41:50,259 --> 00:41:51,475
to see if he can kill it
in committee?

805
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:53,360
No, i did not, sir.

806
00:41:53,395 --> 00:41:55,863
Ask him. Tell him
the president said, "handle it."

807
00:41:55,898 --> 00:41:57,364
Yes, sir.

808
00:41:57,399 --> 00:41:58,616
Yes?

809
00:41:58,651 --> 00:42:01,735
The situation is fraught with
tension in asia, mr. President.

810
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:04,238
We're not getting enough
intelligence down there.

811
00:42:04,273 --> 00:42:05,873
Hold on.

812
00:42:05,908 --> 00:42:07,741
Have the c.i.a. Prepare
a full staff study.

813
00:42:07,776 --> 00:42:08,993
Tell bill you need it
right away.

814
00:42:09,028 --> 00:42:10,878
Thank you, sir.

815
00:42:10,913 --> 00:42:12,997
No.
Your appointment
schedule, mr. President.

816
00:42:13,032 --> 00:42:14,248
Thank you, may.

817
00:42:14,283 --> 00:42:16,750
Move the press conference
to after lunch;

818
00:42:16,785 --> 00:42:18,002
i need a haircut.
Yes, sir.

819
00:42:18,037 --> 00:42:20,504
I'll make the u.n. Speech.
Tell lorenson

820
00:42:20,539 --> 00:42:22,389
to whip up a draft
and remind him- jokes.

821
00:42:22,424 --> 00:42:23,641
Yes, mr. President.

822
00:42:23,676 --> 00:42:24,892
Who are sonny and mickey?

823
00:42:24,927 --> 00:42:27,394
Oh, they're the cub
scouts who wrote you

824
00:42:27,429 --> 00:42:28,012
the letter
on citizenship.

825
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:29,263
You asked to
be reminded

826
00:42:29,298 --> 00:42:30,514
when they came
into the capitol.

827
00:42:30,549 --> 00:42:32,399
Aha.
Of course,
there's no time...

828
00:42:32,434 --> 00:42:35,152
make time.
We'll have haircuts together.

829
00:42:35,769 --> 00:42:38,272
Yes, sir. Oh, it's
almost 10:00.

830
00:42:38,307 --> 00:42:39,523
Pardon me, murray.

831
00:42:45,162 --> 00:42:48,916
20 million kilowatts
for the people of the southwest.

832
00:42:48,951 --> 00:42:52,036
Too bad i can't make
all these dedications in person.

833
00:42:52,286 --> 00:42:54,171
Miss may, pass this on
to the secretary of defense,

834
00:42:54,206 --> 00:42:55,422
marked "expedite."
Yes, sir.

835
00:42:55,457 --> 00:42:57,925
Save these for the cabinet
meeting, priority.
Yes, sir.

836
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:00,427
And get the economic advisory
council to dig in on this.

837
00:43:00,462 --> 00:43:03,547
Right away, sir.
See me after lunch,
murray, won't you?

838
00:43:12,091 --> 00:43:13,941
Hmm.

839
00:43:16,443 --> 00:43:18,312
Come, boy.

840
00:43:18,347 --> 00:43:20,197
Ah, come, attila.

841
00:43:21,483 --> 00:43:22,700
How's my boy, eh?

842
00:43:22,735 --> 00:43:24,568
Here we are.

843
00:43:24,603 --> 00:43:27,071
Good boy.

844
00:43:30,207 --> 00:43:31,458
Mmm.

845
00:43:58,986 --> 00:44:02,106
Oh, mr. President,
i had to see you.

846
00:44:02,141 --> 00:44:03,357
Who...

847
00:44:03,392 --> 00:44:06,493
wh-what are you
doing there, woman?

848
00:44:06,528 --> 00:44:08,362
L-i've been hiding
there all night, sir.

849
00:44:08,397 --> 00:44:10,247
It was the only way.

850
00:44:10,282 --> 00:44:12,116
They said you were
too busy.

851
00:44:12,151 --> 00:44:14,001
Oh, please, please
listen to me, sir.

852
00:44:14,036 --> 00:44:15,869
Don't send me away.

853
00:44:15,904 --> 00:44:19,623
Oh, my good woman,
come, here you are.

854
00:44:19,658 --> 00:44:21,508
Here you are.

855
00:44:21,543 --> 00:44:24,628
Now, what, what can
i do for you, madam?

856
00:44:25,879 --> 00:44:30,267
Mr. President, l-it's my son.

857
00:44:30,302 --> 00:44:32,770
He's just a boy.

858
00:44:32,805 --> 00:44:34,638
18.

859
00:44:34,673 --> 00:44:39,643
He fell asleep on guard duty,
and they said it was treason.

860
00:44:40,894 --> 00:44:44,648
They're going to hang
him, mr. President.

861
00:44:44,683 --> 00:44:46,533
Hang him.

862
00:44:46,568 --> 00:44:48,402
Easy now, easy.

863
00:44:48,437 --> 00:44:50,287
He's in the service, your boy?

864
00:44:50,322 --> 00:44:51,288
Yes, sir.

865
00:44:51,323 --> 00:44:55,042
The army, special duty
at the missile base.

866
00:44:55,077 --> 00:44:56,293
I see.

867
00:44:56,328 --> 00:45:01,165
Falling asleep on duty
is very serious.

868
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,300
Oh, i know, sir.

869
00:45:03,335 --> 00:45:07,054
Only a presidential
pardon can save him.

870
00:45:07,089 --> 00:45:08,305
Oh, please, sir.

871
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:10,174
He's a good boy.

872
00:45:10,209 --> 00:45:12,059
Just a little tired.

873
00:45:12,094 --> 00:45:13,811
It could
happen to anyone.

874
00:45:13,846 --> 00:45:16,930
Indeed it could, ma'am.

875
00:45:16,965 --> 00:45:18,932
Then you'll do it?

876
00:45:18,967 --> 00:45:20,818
You'll pardon him?

877
00:45:20,853 --> 00:45:24,188
If freedom is our battle cry,

878
00:45:24,223 --> 00:45:29,193
then justice and mercy
are our glory.

879
00:45:31,078 --> 00:45:37,334
Ma'am... you tell your boy that
when you see him tomorrow.

880
00:45:42,956 --> 00:45:46,093
Have the attorney general
prepare an order

881
00:45:46,128 --> 00:45:47,961
for executive clemency
immediately.

882
00:45:47,996 --> 00:45:49,713
Oh, thank you.

883
00:45:49,748 --> 00:45:52,216
Thank you, thank
you, mr. President.

884
00:45:52,251 --> 00:45:55,352
Mr. President,
you're a great man.

885
00:45:55,387 --> 00:46:00,357
Bless you.

886
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:15,372
You see, attila?

887
00:46:15,989 --> 00:46:19,126
Power is not
a difficult thing to handle.

888
00:46:19,161 --> 00:46:22,246
All one has to know
is how to use it.

889
00:46:24,166 --> 00:46:25,132
I couldn't wait,
mr. President.

890
00:46:25,749 --> 00:46:28,252
Those blips on the radar screen
have just been identified-

891
00:46:28,287 --> 00:46:30,754
spaceships.
From some
strange planet.

892
00:46:30,789 --> 00:46:32,389
Spaceships from another planet?

893
00:46:32,424 --> 00:46:33,640
Huge ones, hundreds of them.

894
00:46:33,675 --> 00:46:34,892
Well, what'll we do?

895
00:46:34,927 --> 00:46:36,760
We can't take chances.
Shoot them down!

896
00:46:36,795 --> 00:46:38,011
You can't, mr. President.

897
00:46:38,046 --> 00:46:39,897
There might be thousands
of innocent people aboard.

898
00:46:39,932 --> 00:46:41,148
They're headed directly for us.

899
00:46:41,183 --> 00:46:43,016
We signaled,
and they refused to answer.

900
00:46:43,051 --> 00:46:44,268
It might be the
greatest breakthrough

901
00:46:44,902 --> 00:46:46,770
of scientific investigation in
the history of the universe.

902
00:46:46,805 --> 00:46:48,155
If they're advanced
enough to get here,

903
00:46:48,772 --> 00:46:50,023
think of their weapons,
what they can do to us.

904
00:46:50,058 --> 00:46:52,526
Our only chance is to
get them with missiles
before they arrive!

905
00:46:52,561 --> 00:46:55,028
What if
they're friendly?
What if they aren't?

906
00:46:55,063 --> 00:46:55,662
Let them land.

907
00:46:55,697 --> 00:46:57,531
Counterattack before
it's too late.

908
00:46:57,566 --> 00:46:59,416
The decision is up to
you, mr. President.

909
00:46:59,451 --> 00:47:00,284
What about a staff study?

910
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:01,535
There isn't time!

911
00:47:01,570 --> 00:47:02,536
Can we call the congress?

912
00:47:02,571 --> 00:47:03,787
It's
too late!

913
00:47:03,822 --> 00:47:05,038
The secretary of defense?

914
00:47:05,073 --> 00:47:06,039
It's a matter of moments, sir.

915
00:47:06,074 --> 00:47:07,291
It's up to you!

916
00:47:07,326 --> 00:47:10,294
No, no, i can't decide!

917
00:47:10,329 --> 00:47:11,545
I can't decide, no!

918
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:14,681
Not me! Not me! Not me!

919
00:47:14,716 --> 00:47:18,051
Not me, not... not me.

920
00:47:18,086 --> 00:47:19,937
Yeah, you, mac.

921
00:47:19,972 --> 00:47:23,056
You and your mutt,
get off of my stoop.

922
00:47:23,091 --> 00:47:24,942
Oh, okay, okay.

923
00:47:24,977 --> 00:47:27,444
Come on, boy.

924
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:36,820
But you know something, attila?

925
00:47:36,855 --> 00:47:39,957
No matter what i wished for,
it wouldn't change anything.

926
00:47:40,574 --> 00:47:42,459
I'd still be me.

927
00:47:42,494 --> 00:47:43,710
George p. Hanley.

928
00:47:43,745 --> 00:47:46,213
Jerk.

929
00:47:46,248 --> 00:47:48,081
What's the quotation?

930
00:47:49,833 --> 00:47:51,718
"Men at some time

931
00:47:51,753 --> 00:47:54,221
are masters of their fates."

932
00:47:56,089 --> 00:48:00,477
"The fault," dear attila,
"is not in our stars,

933
00:48:00,512 --> 00:48:03,597
but in ourselves."

934
00:48:06,984 --> 00:48:08,852
Ourselves.

935
00:48:11,989 --> 00:48:13,490
Ourselves.

936
00:48:20,364 --> 00:48:24,117
Get ready, you bored, old genie.

937
00:48:24,152 --> 00:48:29,756
We're going to wish
for something... original!

938
00:49:28,432 --> 00:49:33,437
Yes, master, i am the
genie of the lamp.

939
00:49:33,472 --> 00:49:36,573
You may have three wishes.

940
00:49:36,608 --> 00:49:39,076
But when you have made them,

941
00:49:39,111 --> 00:49:43,447
you must return
the lamp to this alley

942
00:49:43,482 --> 00:49:46,583
where others may find it.

943
00:49:49,703 --> 00:49:53,457
At your service, sir.

944
00:49:53,492 --> 00:49:55,342
Mr. George p. Hanley,

945
00:49:55,377 --> 00:49:57,844
jerk.

946
00:49:57,879 --> 00:49:59,713
Genie.

947
00:50:00,347 --> 00:50:03,467
George p. Hanley,
a most ordinary man

948
00:50:03,502 --> 00:50:07,220
whom life treated without
deference, honor, or success.

949
00:50:07,255 --> 00:50:10,357
But a man wise enough to decide
on a most extraordinary wish

950
00:50:10,392 --> 00:50:13,477
that makes him
the contented permanent master

951
00:50:13,512 --> 00:50:17,864
of his own altruistic
twilight zone.
