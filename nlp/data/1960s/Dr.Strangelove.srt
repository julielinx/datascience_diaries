1
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:45,565
<i>For more than a year, ominous rumors
had been privately circulating...</i>

2
00:00:45,638 --> 00:00:48,072
<i>among high-level Western leaders...</i>

3
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:52,008
<i>that the Soviet Union had been at work
on what was darkly hinted to be...</i>

4
00:00:52,078 --> 00:00:55,776
<i>the ultimate weapon:
A doomsday device.</i>

5
00:00:55,849 --> 00:00:59,751
<i>Intelligence sources traced the site
of the top-secret Russian project...</i>

6
00:00:59,821 --> 00:01:02,517
<i>to the perpetually
fog-shrouded wasteland...</i>

7
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:05,991
<i>below the Arctic peaks
of the Zhokhov Islands.</i>

8
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:11,397
<i>What they were building or why it was
located in a remote, desolate place...</i>

9
00:01:11,467 --> 00:01:13,731
<i>no one could say.</i>

10
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,508
General Ripper, sir.

11
00:03:45,576 --> 00:03:47,510
Group Captain Mandrake speaking.

12
00:03:47,578 --> 00:03:49,569
This is General Ripper speaking.

13
00:03:49,647 --> 00:03:51,843
<i>- Yes, sir.
- Do you recognize my voice?</i>

14
00:03:51,917 --> 00:03:54,317
I do, sir. Why do you ask?

15
00:03:54,386 --> 00:03:56,149
Why do you think?

16
00:03:56,221 --> 00:03:59,817
I don't know, sir. We spoke
just a few moments ago, didn't we?

17
00:03:59,892 --> 00:04:05,125
You don't think I'd ask unless it was
pretty damned important, do you?

18
00:04:05,198 --> 00:04:06,632
No, I don't.

19
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,895
<i>Let's see if we can stay on the ball.</i>

20
00:04:09,836 --> 00:04:12,430
Has the Wing confirmed holding
at their fail-safe points?

21
00:04:12,506 --> 00:04:15,340
Yes, sir. The confirmations
have just come in.

22
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:19,039
Very well.
Now, listen to me carefully.

23
00:04:19,113 --> 00:04:21,912
The base is being put on condition red.

24
00:04:21,984 --> 00:04:24,214
I want this flashed
to all sections immediately.

25
00:04:24,286 --> 00:04:27,619
Condition red. Jolly good.
Keeps the men on their toes.

26
00:04:27,691 --> 00:04:29,955
This is not an exercise.

27
00:04:31,027 --> 00:04:32,892
Not an exercise?

28
00:04:34,598 --> 00:04:39,229
I shouldn't tell you this, but you're
a good officer and have a right to know.

29
00:04:39,303 --> 00:04:41,237
It looks like we're in a shooting war.

30
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:47,201
<i>- Oh, hell. Are the Russians involved?
- That's all I've been told.</i>

31
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:52,047
It came in on the red phone. I'm gonna
follow orders and seal this base tight.

32
00:04:53,152 --> 00:04:56,680
Now, I want you to transmit Plan R...

33
00:04:56,757 --> 00:04:58,691
R for Robert, to the Wing.

34
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:02,160
<i>- Plan R for Robert.
- Is it that bad, sir?</i>

35
00:05:02,229 --> 00:05:04,721
<i>- Looks like it's pretty hairy.
- Yes, sir.</i>

36
00:05:04,799 --> 00:05:06,824
Plan R for Robert.

37
00:05:06,901 --> 00:05:10,234
Last and possibly most important...

38
00:05:10,305 --> 00:05:14,538
I want all privately owned radios
to be immediately impounded.

39
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:18,547
They might be used to issue
instructions to saboteurs.

40
00:05:18,615 --> 00:05:21,482
As I previously arranged, Air Police
will have lists of all owners.

41
00:05:21,551 --> 00:05:25,545
I want every one collected
without exception.

42
00:05:25,623 --> 00:05:27,921
After you've done that,
report back to me.

43
00:05:55,057 --> 00:05:57,719
<i>In order to guard against
surprise nuclear attack...</i>

44
00:05:57,793 --> 00:06:01,230
<i>America's Strategic Air Command
maintains...</i>

45
00:06:01,297 --> 00:06:05,427
<i>a large force of B-52 bombers
airborne 24 hours a day.</i>

46
00:06:05,501 --> 00:06:10,405
<i>Each B-52 can deliver
a nuclear bomb load of 50 megatons...</i>

47
00:06:10,474 --> 00:06:15,503
<i>equal to 16 times the total
explosive force of all the bombs...</i>

48
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:20,142
<i>and shells used by all the armies
in World War II.</i>

49
00:06:20,218 --> 00:06:23,347
<i>Based in America,
the Airborne Alert Force...</i>

50
00:06:23,422 --> 00:06:26,220
<i>is deployed from the Persian Gulf
to the Arctic Ocean.</i>

51
00:06:26,292 --> 00:06:29,090
<i>But they have one geographical factor
in common.</i>

52
00:06:29,161 --> 00:06:33,121
<i>They are all two hours
from their targets inside Russia.</i>

53
00:07:53,157 --> 00:07:56,150
Major Kong, I know you'll think
this is crazy...

54
00:07:56,228 --> 00:07:59,891
but I just got a message from base
over the C.R.M. 114.

55
00:08:00,966 --> 00:08:04,926
It decodes as Wing attack Plan R.
R for Romeo.

56
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:12,308
Goldie, did you say
Wing attack Plan R?

57
00:08:12,379 --> 00:08:13,903
Yes, sir, I have.

58
00:08:17,719 --> 00:08:22,418
Goldie, how many times have
I told you guys that I don't want...

59
00:08:22,491 --> 00:08:24,426
<i>horsin'around on the airplane?</i>

60
00:08:24,494 --> 00:08:26,758
I'm not horsing around.
That's how it decodes.

61
00:08:26,829 --> 00:08:29,491
I've been to one world fair,
a picnic...

62
00:08:29,565 --> 00:08:33,434
<i>and a rodeo, and that's the stupidest
thing I heard over earphones.</i>

63
00:08:33,504 --> 00:08:35,404
You sure you got today's code?

64
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,932
Yes, sir.

65
00:08:38,008 --> 00:08:40,569
There's gotta be something wrong.

66
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:43,011
Wait a second, I'm coming back.

67
00:09:17,487 --> 00:09:21,150
Maybe you'd better get
a confirmation from base.

68
00:09:21,224 --> 00:09:22,658
Yes, sir.

69
00:09:43,784 --> 00:09:46,378
Major Kong, is it possible
this is some kind of loyalty test?

70
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:50,116
You know, give the go code and then
recall to see who would actually go?

71
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:54,321
Ain't nobody ever got
the go code yet.

72
00:09:54,395 --> 00:09:56,795
Old Ripper wouldn't be giving us
Plan R...

73
00:09:56,864 --> 00:09:59,493
unless them Ruskies had already
clobbered Washington...

74
00:09:59,568 --> 00:10:01,866
and a lot of other towns
with a sneak attack.

75
00:10:01,937 --> 00:10:03,199
Yes, sir.

76
00:10:03,272 --> 00:10:05,764
Major Kong,
message from base confirmed.

77
00:10:10,614 --> 00:10:12,981
Well, boys, I reckon this is it.

78
00:10:14,051 --> 00:10:17,316
Nuclear combat toe-to-toe
with the Ruskies.

79
00:10:32,372 --> 00:10:37,242
Boys, I ain't much of a hand
at making speeches.

80
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:41,979
But I got a fair idea
that something doggone important...

81
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:44,041
is going on back there.

82
00:10:44,119 --> 00:10:47,988
I've got a fair idea of the kind
of personal emotions...

83
00:10:48,057 --> 00:10:51,515
<i>that some of you fellows
may be thinking.</i>

84
00:10:51,594 --> 00:10:54,324
<i>Heck, I reckon you wouldn't be
human beings...</i>

85
00:10:54,397 --> 00:10:58,994
<i>if you didn't have pretty strong
personal feelings about nuclear combat.</i>

86
00:10:59,069 --> 00:11:02,005
<i>I want you to remember one thing.</i>

87
00:11:02,073 --> 00:11:04,837
<i>The folks back home
are counting on you.</i>

88
00:11:04,909 --> 00:11:07,241
<i>And by golly,
we ain't about to let them down.</i>

89
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:11,378
Tell you something else.

90
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:16,445
If this thing turns out to be half
as important as I figure it might be...

91
00:11:16,523 --> 00:11:20,550
I'd say you're all in line
for some important promotions...

92
00:11:20,627 --> 00:11:24,428
and personal citations
when this thing's over with.

93
00:11:24,498 --> 00:11:27,262
That goes for every last one of you...

94
00:11:27,334 --> 00:11:31,169
regardless of your race,
color or your creed.

95
00:11:31,239 --> 00:11:34,800
Now let's get this thing on the hump.
We got some flying to do.

96
00:11:48,425 --> 00:11:50,655
Buck, should I get it?

97
00:11:50,728 --> 00:11:52,663
Yeah, you'll have to.

98
00:11:58,603 --> 00:12:00,367
Hello?

99
00:12:00,439 --> 00:12:05,035
Yes, General Turgidson is here,
but he can't come to the phone now.

100
00:12:05,111 --> 00:12:07,376
This is his secretary, Miss Scott.

101
00:12:08,515 --> 00:12:10,710
Freddie, how are you?

102
00:12:10,784 --> 00:12:13,048
Fine. And you?

103
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,785
Oh, we were just catching up
on some of the general's paperwork.

104
00:12:17,859 --> 00:12:22,490
He's tied up.
I'm afraid he can't come to the phone.

105
00:12:23,565 --> 00:12:24,998
Just a minute.

106
00:12:25,067 --> 00:12:28,333
General Turgidson,
a Colonel Puntrich calling.

107
00:12:28,404 --> 00:12:30,338
Tell him to call back.

108
00:12:30,406 --> 00:12:35,105
Freddie, the general says
could you call back in a minute?

109
00:12:35,179 --> 00:12:37,113
He says it can't wait.

110
00:12:37,181 --> 00:12:40,514
For Pete's...
Find out what he wants.

111
00:12:40,584 --> 00:12:44,487
The general is in the powder room
right now.

112
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:46,820
Could you tell me what it's about?

113
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:52,357
Just a second. Apparently they monitored
a transmission eight minutes ago...

114
00:12:52,431 --> 00:12:54,922
from Burpelson Air Force Base.

115
00:12:56,770 --> 00:13:01,833
Right. It was directed to
the 843rd Bomb Wing on airborne alert.

116
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:07,069
It decoded as Wing attack Plan R.

117
00:13:07,148 --> 00:13:12,815
Well, tell him to call what's-his-name,
Base Commander Ripper.

118
00:13:12,888 --> 00:13:14,549
Do I have to think of everything?

119
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:19,220
The general suggests you call General
Ripper, the 843rd base commander.

120
00:13:19,296 --> 00:13:22,697
Oh. All communications are dead!

121
00:13:22,766 --> 00:13:26,168
Bull! Tell him to do it himself.

122
00:13:26,237 --> 00:13:31,174
The general asks if you could
possibly try again yourself.

123
00:13:31,242 --> 00:13:35,907
I see. He says he's tried personally
several times, but everything is dead.

124
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:38,745
Even the normal phone lines
are shut down.

125
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:48,859
Fred? Buck.
What's it look like?

126
00:13:50,464 --> 00:13:51,897
Yeah?

127
00:13:53,334 --> 00:13:56,327
Well, are you sure
it's Plan R?

128
00:13:57,572 --> 00:14:00,268
Huh. What's cooking
on the threat board?

129
00:14:00,342 --> 00:14:03,141
Nothing? Nothing at all?

130
00:14:05,314 --> 00:14:07,373
I don't like the look of this.

131
00:14:08,852 --> 00:14:11,480
Tell you what you better do,
old buddy.

132
00:14:11,555 --> 00:14:14,718
You better give Elmo and Charlie a blast
and bump everything up to condition red.

133
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:17,352
Stand by the blower.
I'll get back to you.

134
00:14:17,428 --> 00:14:19,623
- What's up?
- Nothing.

135
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:24,499
- Where's my shorts?
- On the floor. Where are you going?

136
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:26,333
No place.

137
00:14:26,405 --> 00:14:31,139
I thought I might mosey over to the
War Room to see what's doing over there.

138
00:14:31,211 --> 00:14:33,008
It's 3:00 in the morning.

139
00:14:33,079 --> 00:14:35,013
The air force never sleeps.

140
00:14:35,081 --> 00:14:39,018
Buck, honey, I'm not sleepy either.

141
00:14:41,689 --> 00:14:44,488
I know how it is, baby.

142
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:46,584
Tell you what you do.

143
00:14:47,629 --> 00:14:51,589
You start your countdown
and old Bucky will be back...

144
00:14:51,668 --> 00:14:55,229
before you can say "Blastoff!"

145
00:14:56,506 --> 00:15:00,603
<i>Your Commie has no regard
for human life, not even his own.</i>

146
00:15:01,779 --> 00:15:05,613
<i>For this reason, men, I want
to impress upon you the need...</i>

147
00:15:05,683 --> 00:15:07,777
<i>for extreme watchfullness.</i>

148
00:15:07,852 --> 00:15:11,879
<i>The enemy may come individually
or he may come in strength.</i>

149
00:15:11,957 --> 00:15:14,552
He may even come in the uniform
of our own troops.

150
00:15:15,528 --> 00:15:18,122
<i>But however he comes,
we must stop him.</i>

151
00:15:18,197 --> 00:15:20,962
<i>We must not allow him
to gain entrance to this base.</i>

152
00:15:22,502 --> 00:15:26,438
<i>Now, I am going to give you
three simple rules.</i>

153
00:15:26,506 --> 00:15:31,001
<i>First: Trust no one,
whatever his uniform or rank...</i>

154
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:33,570
<i>unless he is known to you personally.</i>

155
00:15:33,648 --> 00:15:36,516
<i>Secondly: Anyone or anything...</i>

156
00:15:36,585 --> 00:15:41,488
that approaches within 200 yards
of the perimeter is to be fired upon.

157
00:15:41,557 --> 00:15:47,190
Third: If in doubt, shoot first
and ask questions afterwards.

158
00:15:47,263 --> 00:15:50,631
<i>I would sooner accept a few casualties
through accident...</i>

159
00:15:50,701 --> 00:15:54,831
<i>than lose the entire base
and its personnel through carelessness.</i>

160
00:15:54,905 --> 00:15:59,036
<i>Any variation on these rules
must come from me personally.</i>

161
00:16:00,112 --> 00:16:02,945
<i>Now, men, in conclusion...</i>

162
00:16:03,015 --> 00:16:07,077
<i>I would like to say
that in the two years...</i>

163
00:16:07,153 --> 00:16:10,954
<i>that it has been my privilege
to be your commanding officer...</i>

164
00:16:11,025 --> 00:16:13,960
<i>I have always expected
the best from you...</i>

165
00:16:14,028 --> 00:16:17,931
<i>and you have never given me
anything less than that.</i>

166
00:16:17,999 --> 00:16:21,366
<i>Today the nation is counting on us.</i>

167
00:16:22,437 --> 00:16:25,271
<i>We are not going to let them down.</i>

168
00:16:25,341 --> 00:16:27,275
<i>Good luck to you all.</i>

169
00:16:57,477 --> 00:17:00,002
Here's the attack profile, sir.

170
00:17:27,778 --> 00:17:30,441
This is your attack profile.

171
00:17:30,515 --> 00:17:33,609
"To ensure that the enemy cannot monitor
voice transmission...

172

the C.R.M. 114 is to be switched
into all receiver circuits.

<i>This will block any transmission other
than those preceded by a code prefix. "</i>

177
00:17:53,274 --> 00:17:55,435
Stand by to set code prefix.

178
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:57,979
Roger. Ready to set code prefix.

179
00:17:58,046 --> 00:17:59,911
"Set code prefix."

180
00:18:09,459 --> 00:18:10,892
Code prefix set.

181
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,622
"Lock code prefix."

182
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:16,732
Code prefix locked.

183
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:20,293
"Switch all receiver circuits
to C.R.M. Discriminators."

184
00:18:21,506 --> 00:18:24,737
Switched to C.R.M. Discriminators.

185
00:18:24,809 --> 00:18:26,675
<i>"Check auto destruct circuits."</i>

186
00:18:29,982 --> 00:18:31,916
Auto destruct circuits checked.

187

"Primary target:
The I.C.B.M. Complex at Laputa.

Fused air burst at 10..."
Check..."12,000 feet."

198
00:19:29,016 --> 00:19:32,919
Excuse me, sir. Something rather
interesting has just cropped up.

199
00:19:32,988 --> 00:19:35,821
Listen to that. Music.
Civilian broadcasting.

200
00:19:37,425 --> 00:19:41,692
I think the Pentagon has given us
an exercise to check our readiness.

201
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:43,755
I think it's taking things too far.

202
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:46,860
Our fellows will be inside Russian
radar cover in about 20 minutes.

203
00:19:46,937 --> 00:19:50,168
Listen. Chock full of stations
all churning it out.

204
00:19:51,942 --> 00:19:53,706
- Mandrake?
- Yes, sir?

205
00:19:53,778 --> 00:19:57,214
I issued instructions for all radios
to be impounded.

206
00:19:57,282 --> 00:20:01,583
You did, and I was in the process of
impounding this when I switched it on.

207
00:20:01,654 --> 00:20:05,146
I thought our fellows hitting Russian
radar, dropping all their stuff...

208
00:20:05,224 --> 00:20:09,685
I'd better tell you because if they do,
it'll cause a stink.

209
00:20:09,763 --> 00:20:13,824
Group Captain,
the officer exchange program...

210
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:17,530
does not give you any special
prerogatives to question my orders.

211
00:20:17,605 --> 00:20:21,838
I realize that, sir, but I thought
you'd be pleased to hear the news.

212
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:24,674
After all, let's face it.

213
00:20:24,746 --> 00:20:28,740
We don't want to start a nuclear war
unless we have to, do we?

214
00:20:29,719 --> 00:20:33,382
Please sit down.
And turn that thing off.

215
00:20:33,456 --> 00:20:34,582
Yes, sir.

216
00:20:34,657 --> 00:20:39,561
What about the planes? Surely we must
issue the recall code immediately.

217
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:42,497
The planes are not going
to be recalled.

218
00:20:42,566 --> 00:20:45,434
My attack orders have been issued,
and the orders stand.

219
00:20:47,472 --> 00:20:51,637
If you'll excuse me for saying so,
that would be to my way of thinking...

220
00:20:51,711 --> 00:20:53,872
rather an odd way of looking at it

221
00:20:53,946 --> 00:20:56,346
If a Russian attack was in progress...

222
00:20:56,415 --> 00:21:00,352
we would certainly not be hearing
civilian broadcasting.

223
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:03,287
- Are you certain?
- I'm absolutely positive.

224
00:21:03,357 --> 00:21:06,088
What if it is true?

225
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:09,186
I'm afraid I'm still not with you, sir,
because I mean...

226
00:21:10,765 --> 00:21:13,132
if a Russian attack
was not in progress...

227
00:21:13,202 --> 00:21:17,571
then your use of Plan R... In fact,
your orders to the entire Wing...

228
00:21:25,048 --> 00:21:30,316
I would say, sir, that there was
something dreadfully wrong somewhere

229
00:21:31,389 --> 00:21:33,756
Why don't you take it easy,
Group Captain?

230
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:36,487
Please make me a drink
of grain alcohol and rainwater...

231
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:38,995
and help yourself
to whatever you'd like.

232
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:52,137
General Ripper, sir, as an officer
in Her Majesty's Air Force...

233
00:21:52,212 --> 00:21:55,478
it is my clear duty
under the present circumstances...

234
00:21:55,550 --> 00:22:00,249
to issue the recall code upon my
own authority and bring back the Wing.

235
00:22:00,321 --> 00:22:02,313
If you'll excuse me, sir.

236
00:22:10,934 --> 00:22:15,837
Sir, I must ask you for the key and the
recall code. Have you got them handy?

237
00:22:15,907 --> 00:22:18,398
I told you to take it easy,
Group Captain.

238
00:22:18,476 --> 00:22:21,036
There's nothing anybody can do now.

239
00:22:21,112 --> 00:22:23,547
I'm the only person who knows
the three-letter code group.

240
00:22:23,615 --> 00:22:26,175
I must insist
that you give them to me!

241
00:22:35,261 --> 00:22:39,255
Do I take it, sir, you are threatening
a brother officer with a gun?

242
00:22:40,534 --> 00:22:45,666
Mandrake, I suppose
it never occurred to you...

243
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:49,335
that while we're chatting here
so enjoyably...

244
00:22:49,411 --> 00:22:53,280
a decision is being made
by the president...

245
00:22:53,349 --> 00:22:56,512
and the joint chiefs in the War Room
at the Pentagon.

246
00:22:57,587 --> 00:23:03,185
When they realize there is
no possibility of recalling the Wing...

247
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:07,561
there will be only one course
of action open.

248
00:23:07,632 --> 00:23:09,532
Total commitment.

249
00:23:11,803 --> 00:23:16,241
Mandrake, do you recall what
Clemenceau once said about war?

250
00:23:17,543 --> 00:23:20,239
No, I don't think I do, sir. No.

251
00:23:21,915 --> 00:23:24,941
He said war was too important
to be left to the generals.

252
00:23:26,019 --> 00:23:30,616
When he said that 50 years ago...

253
00:23:30,691 --> 00:23:32,659
he might have been right.

254
00:23:32,727 --> 00:23:35,094
But today...

255
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:38,621
war is too important
to be left to politicians.

256
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:43,161
They have neither the time,
the training...

257
00:23:43,239 --> 00:23:46,299
nor the inclination
for strategic thought.

258
00:23:49,947 --> 00:23:53,439
I can no longer sit back
and allow...

259
00:23:53,517 --> 00:23:58,683
Communist infiltration,
Communist indoctrination...

260
00:23:58,757 --> 00:24:00,384
Communist subversion...

261
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:05,729
and the international
Communist conspiracy...

262
00:24:05,798 --> 00:24:08,665
to sap and impurify...

263
00:24:08,734 --> 00:24:12,068
all of our precious
bodily fluids.

264
00:24:18,246 --> 00:24:19,736
Staines, is everybody here?

265
00:24:19,814 --> 00:24:22,305
Mr. President, the secretary of state
is in Vietnam.

266
00:24:22,383 --> 00:24:26,343
The secretary of defense is in Laos, and
the vice president is in Mexico City.

267
00:24:26,422 --> 00:24:31,382
We can establish contact with them at
anytime. The undersecretaries are here.

268
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:34,555
Right. General Turgidson,
what's going on?

269
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:38,659
Mr. President...

270
00:24:38,735 --> 00:24:42,399
about 35 minutes ago...

271
00:24:42,473 --> 00:24:46,467
GeneralJack Ripper,
the commanding general...

272
00:24:46,545 --> 00:24:48,979
of Burpelson Air Force Base...

273
00:24:49,047 --> 00:24:52,312
issued an order to the 34 B-52s
of his Wing...

274
00:24:52,384 --> 00:24:54,512
which were airborne at the time...

275
00:24:54,587 --> 00:24:58,717
as part of a special exercise we were
holding called Operation Dropkick.

276
00:24:58,791 --> 00:25:03,491
It appears that the order
called for the planes...

277
00:25:03,564 --> 00:25:06,931
to attack their targets
inside Russia.

278
00:25:07,001 --> 00:25:11,234
The planes are fully armed
with nuclear weapons...

279
00:25:11,306 --> 00:25:14,833
with an average load
of 40 megatons each.

280
00:25:14,909 --> 00:25:19,370
The central display of Russia will
indicate the position of the planes.

281
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:24,082
The triangles
are their primary targets.

282
00:25:24,154 --> 00:25:27,089
The squares
are their secondary targets.

283
00:25:28,158 --> 00:25:33,461
The aircraft will begin penetrating
Russian radar cover within 25 minutes.

284
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:38,967
General Turgidson, I find this
very difficult to understand.

285
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:44,306
I understood I was the only one
to order the use of nuclear weapons.

286
00:25:45,445 --> 00:25:49,541
That's right, sir. You are
the only person authorized to do so.

287
00:25:49,616 --> 00:25:53,917
And although I hate to judge
before all the facts are in...

288
00:25:53,988 --> 00:25:57,617
it's beginning to look like
General Ripper exceeded his authority.

289
00:25:57,692 --> 00:26:02,562
It certainly does, far beyond the point
I would have imagined possible.

290
00:26:02,631 --> 00:26:06,261
Perhaps you're forgetting
the provisions of Plan R, sir.

291
00:26:06,335 --> 00:26:08,166
Plan R?

292
00:26:09,572 --> 00:26:13,134
Plan R is an emergency war plan...

293
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:15,735
in which a lower echelon commander
may order...

294
00:26:15,813 --> 00:26:18,941
nuclear retaliation
after a sneak attack...

295
00:26:19,016 --> 00:26:22,509
if the normal chain of command
has been disrupted.

296
00:26:22,587 --> 00:26:25,488
You approved it, sir.
You must remember.

297
00:26:27,026 --> 00:26:30,860
Surely you must recall, sir,
when Senator Beaufort made...

298
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:33,899
that big hassle about our deterrent
lacking credibility.

299
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:38,700
The idea was for Plan R to be
a sort of retaliatory safeguard.

300
00:26:38,772 --> 00:26:40,763
A safeguard?

301
00:26:40,841 --> 00:26:44,107
I admit the human element seems
to have failed us here.

302
00:26:44,178 --> 00:26:47,579
But the idea was to discourage
the Ruskies from any hope...

303
00:26:47,648 --> 00:26:52,245
they could knock out Washington, and
yourself, as part of a sneak attack...

304
00:26:52,321 --> 00:26:56,520
and escape retaliation because of lack
of proper command and control.

305
00:26:56,593 --> 00:26:59,289
I assume the planes will return
automatically...

306
00:26:59,362 --> 00:27:01,387
once they reach their fail-safe points.

307
00:27:02,499 --> 00:27:07,028
I'm afraid not. The planes were holding
at their fail-safe points...

308
00:27:07,104 --> 00:27:09,129
when the go code was issued.

309
00:27:09,206 --> 00:27:13,701
Once they fly beyond fail-safe, they do
not require a second order to proceed.

310
00:27:13,779 --> 00:27:15,713
They will continue
until they reach their target.

311
00:27:15,781 --> 00:27:18,842
Then why haven't you radioed the planes,
countermanding the go code?

312
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,546
We're unable to communicate
with any of the aircraft.

313
00:27:23,623 --> 00:27:25,819
Why?

314
00:27:25,893 --> 00:27:28,293
As you may recall, sir...

315
00:27:28,362 --> 00:27:31,992
one of the provisions
of Plan R provides...

316
00:27:32,066 --> 00:27:36,662
that once the go code
is received...

317
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:40,072
the normal S.S.B. Radios
in the aircraft...

318
00:27:40,142 --> 00:27:42,610
are switched into
a special coded device...

319
00:27:42,678 --> 00:27:45,739
which I believe is designated
as C.R.M. 114.

320
00:27:45,816 --> 00:27:50,253
In order to prevent the enemy
from issuing fake or confusing orders...

321
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:54,257
C.R.M. 114 is designed
not to receive at all...

322
00:27:54,325 --> 00:27:59,854
unless the message is proceeded by the
correct three-letter code group prefix.

323
00:27:59,931 --> 00:28:05,302
You mean to tell me you will be unable
to recall the aircraft?

324
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:08,306
That's the size of it.
However, we are plowing through...

325
00:28:08,374 --> 00:28:11,275
every possible three-letter combination
of the code.

326
00:28:11,344 --> 00:28:16,544
But since there are
17,000 permutations...

327
00:28:16,617 --> 00:28:20,212
it's going to take us about two
and a half days to transmit them all.

328
00:28:20,287 --> 00:28:23,052
How soon will the planes penetrate
Russian radar cover?

329
00:28:23,124 --> 00:28:26,616
- About 18 minutes from now.
- Are you in contact with General Ripper?

330
00:28:26,695 --> 00:28:31,599
No, sir. General Ripper sealed off
the base and cut off communications.

331
00:28:31,667 --> 00:28:33,294
Where did you get this information?

332
00:28:33,369 --> 00:28:36,965
General Ripper called
Strategic Air Command Headquarters...

333
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,565
shortly after he issued the go code.

334
00:28:39,643 --> 00:28:43,273
I have a portion of the conversation
transcript if you'd like me to read it.

335
00:28:43,348 --> 00:28:45,111
Read it.

336
00:28:46,918 --> 00:28:49,682
The duty officer asked
General Ripper...

337
00:28:49,754 --> 00:28:53,020
to confirm the fact that he had
issued the go code and he said:

338
00:28:54,026 --> 00:28:58,327
"Yes, gentlemen, they are on their way
in and no one can bring them back.

339
00:28:58,398 --> 00:29:01,196
For the sake of our country
and our way of life...

340
00:29:01,268 --> 00:29:03,964
I suggest you get the rest of SAC
in after them.

341
00:29:04,037 --> 00:29:08,941
Otherwise, we will be totally destroyed
by Red retaliation.

342
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:14,313
My boys will give you the best kind
of start: 1,400 megatons worth.

343
00:29:14,383 --> 00:29:17,944
And you sure as hell
won't stop them now.

344
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:20,888
So let's get going.
There's no other choice.

345
00:29:20,957 --> 00:29:25,826
God willing, we will prevail
in peace and freedom from fear...

346
00:29:25,895 --> 00:29:29,297
and in true health
through the purity...

347
00:29:29,366 --> 00:29:33,235
and essence of our natural...

348
00:29:33,305 --> 00:29:34,738
fluids.

349
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,731
God bless you all."

350
00:29:39,678 --> 00:29:42,307
Then he hung up.

351
00:29:42,381 --> 00:29:45,976
We're still trying to figure out
the meaning of that last phrase, sir.

352
00:29:46,052 --> 00:29:50,387
There's nothing to figure out.
This man is obviously a psychotic.

353
00:29:50,457 --> 00:29:55,555
I'd like to hold off judgment
until all the facts are in.

354
00:29:55,630 --> 00:30:00,226
General Turgidson, when you instituted
the human reliability tests...

355
00:30:00,301 --> 00:30:04,238
you assured me there was no possibility
of such a thing ever occurring.

356
00:30:06,208 --> 00:30:10,270
Well, I don't think it's fair
to condemn a whole program...

357
00:30:10,347 --> 00:30:13,009
because of a single slipup, sir.

358
00:30:13,083 --> 00:30:15,608
I want to speak to General Ripper
on the telephone.

359
00:30:15,685 --> 00:30:17,210
That's impossible.

360
00:30:17,288 --> 00:30:21,190
General Turgidson, I am becoming
less and less interested...

361
00:30:21,258 --> 00:30:24,820
in your estimates
of what is possible and impossible.

362
00:30:25,998 --> 00:30:27,431
General Faceman.

363
00:30:27,499 --> 00:30:28,659
Yes, sir?

364
00:30:28,734 --> 00:30:31,101
Are there any army units
stationed near Burpelson?

365
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:33,229
I'll just check, sir.

366
00:30:38,078 --> 00:30:39,511
Hello?

367
00:30:41,081 --> 00:30:44,312
I told you never to call me here.
Don't you know where I am?

368
00:30:46,721 --> 00:30:49,383
Look, baby, I can't talk to you now.

369
00:30:49,457 --> 00:30:52,017
My president needs me.

370
00:30:52,094 --> 00:30:55,723
Of course Bucky would rather
be there with you.

371
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:59,963
Of course it isn't only physical.

372
00:31:00,037 --> 00:31:02,505
I deeply respect you
as a human being.

373
00:31:02,572 --> 00:31:05,666
Someday I'm going to make you
Mrs. Buck Turgidson.

374
00:31:06,844 --> 00:31:09,779
Oh, listen, you go back to sleep.

375
00:31:09,847 --> 00:31:12,816
Bucky will be there as soon as he can.

376
00:31:12,884 --> 00:31:17,481
All right. Listen, don't forget
to say your prayers.

377
00:31:24,497 --> 00:31:28,434
Apparently,
the 23rd Airborne Division...

378
00:31:28,502 --> 00:31:31,335
is stationed seven miles away
at Alvarado.

379
00:31:31,405 --> 00:31:35,672
General Faceman, I want them to enter
the base, locate General Ripper...

380
00:31:35,744 --> 00:31:38,110
and put him in immediate
telephone contact with me.

381
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,807
Yes, sir.

382
00:31:39,881 --> 00:31:41,542
Mr. President?

383
00:31:41,616 --> 00:31:43,209
If I may advise.

384
00:31:43,286 --> 00:31:47,552
Under a condition red, it is standard
procedure that the base be sealed off...

385
00:31:47,623 --> 00:31:50,388
and the base defended
by base security troops.

386
00:31:50,461 --> 00:31:54,898
Any force trying to enter would
certainly encounter heavy casualties.

387
00:31:54,965 --> 00:31:59,027
General Turgidson, with all due respect
for your defense team...

388
00:31:59,104 --> 00:32:01,834
my boys can brush them aside
without too much trouble.

389
00:32:02,774 --> 00:32:07,542
Mr. President, there are one or two
points I'd like to make, if I may?

390
00:32:08,581 --> 00:32:10,014
Go ahead, General.

391
00:32:11,518 --> 00:32:16,182
One: Our hopes for recalling
the 843rd Bomb Wing...

392
00:32:16,256 --> 00:32:20,557
are quickly being reduced
to a very low order of probability.

393
00:32:20,628 --> 00:32:23,654
Two: In less than 15 minutes
from now...

394
00:32:23,731 --> 00:32:26,724
the Ruskies will be making
radar contact with the planes.

395
00:32:26,802 --> 00:32:28,793
Three: When they do...

396
00:32:28,871 --> 00:32:32,501
they will go absolutely ape and
strike back with everything they've got.

397
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:36,477
Four: If prior to this time...

398
00:32:36,546 --> 00:32:40,005
we have done nothing to suppress
their retaliatory capabilities...

399
00:32:40,084 --> 00:32:43,747
we will suffer virtual annihilation.

400
00:32:46,825 --> 00:32:51,489
Five: Lf, on the other hand...

401
00:32:53,365 --> 00:32:58,702
we immediately launched an attack
on their airfields and missile bases...

402
00:32:58,771 --> 00:33:01,969
we'd stand a damn good chance
of catching them with their pants down.

403
00:33:02,042 --> 00:33:04,408
Hell, we've got
a five-to-one missile superiority.

404
00:33:04,478 --> 00:33:07,242
We could easily assign three missiles
to every target...

405
00:33:07,314 --> 00:33:10,716
and still have a very effective reserve
force for any other contingency.

406
00:33:10,785 --> 00:33:16,156
Six: An unofficial study which
we undertook of this eventuality...

407
00:33:16,225 --> 00:33:21,162
indicated that we would destroy
90% of their nuclear capabilities.

408
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:23,358
We would therefore prevail...

409
00:33:23,433 --> 00:33:26,630
and suffer only modest and acceptable
civilian casualties...

410
00:33:26,703 --> 00:33:31,141
from their remaining force which would
be badly damaged and uncoordinated.

411
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:34,667
General, it is the avowed policy
of our country...

412
00:33:34,745 --> 00:33:36,906
never to strike first
with nuclear weapons.

413
00:33:36,982 --> 00:33:41,681
Well, Mr. President, General Ripper
has already invalidated that policy.

414
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:46,191
That was not an act of national policy.
There are still alternatives open to us.

415
00:33:47,193 --> 00:33:52,029
Mr. President, we are rapidly
approaching a moment of truth...

416
00:33:52,099 --> 00:33:55,262
both for ourselves as human beings
and for the life of our nation.

417
00:33:55,336 --> 00:33:57,964
Truth is not always a pleasant thing.

418
00:33:58,038 --> 00:34:00,599
But it is necessary now
to make a choice:

419
00:34:00,675 --> 00:34:03,439
To choose between two admittedly
regrettable...

420
00:34:03,511 --> 00:34:06,970
but nevertheless distinguishable
postwar environments.

421
00:34:07,049 --> 00:34:11,850
One, where 20 million people are killed;
the other, 150 people killed.

422
00:34:11,921 --> 00:34:14,891
You're talking about mass murder,
General, not war.

423
00:34:14,958 --> 00:34:18,553
Mr. President, I'm not saying
we wouldn't get our hair mussed.

424
00:34:18,629 --> 00:34:23,260
But I do say no more than
10 to 20 million killed. Tops!

425
00:34:23,334 --> 00:34:25,325
Depending on the breaks.

426
00:34:25,403 --> 00:34:29,397
I will not go down in history as
the greatest mass murderer since Hitler!

427
00:34:29,475 --> 00:34:32,069
It might be better
if you were more concerned...

428
00:34:32,144 --> 00:34:35,478
with the American people than
with your image in the history books.

429
00:34:35,548 --> 00:34:38,574
General Turgidson,
I've heard quite sufficient from you.

430
00:34:38,652 --> 00:34:41,052
Thank you very much.

431
00:34:41,121 --> 00:34:43,682
Mr. President, they have
the ambassador waiting upstairs.

432
00:34:43,758 --> 00:34:47,387
- Good. Any difficulty?
- He's having a fit about the M.P.s.

433
00:34:47,461 --> 00:34:49,930
That can't be helped.
Have him brought here straightaway.

434
00:34:49,998 --> 00:34:51,556
Yes, sir.

435
00:34:51,633 --> 00:34:54,158
Is that the Russian ambassador?

436
00:34:54,236 --> 00:34:56,330
Yes, it is, General.

437
00:34:58,441 --> 00:35:01,410
Am I to understand
the Russian ambassador...

438
00:35:01,477 --> 00:35:03,844
is to be admitted entrance
to the War Room?

439
00:35:03,914 --> 00:35:06,781
That is correct.
He is here on my orders.

440
00:35:09,687 --> 00:35:11,883
I don't know exactly how
to put this, sir...

441
00:35:11,956 --> 00:35:15,392
but are you aware of what a breach
of security that would be?

442
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:19,625
He'll see everything.
He'll see the big board.

443
00:35:20,566 --> 00:35:22,898
That is precisely the idea, General.

444
00:35:22,968 --> 00:35:25,199
That is precisely the idea.

445
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:30,642
Staines, get Premier Kissoff
on the hot line.

446
00:35:37,785 --> 00:35:41,688
<i>"Survival kit contents check.</i>

447
00:35:41,757 --> 00:35:46,695
<i>In them you will find

three lipsticks,
three pair of nylon stockings."

459
00:36:23,505 --> 00:36:28,238
Shoot, a fellow could have a pretty
good weekend in Vegas with that stuff.

460
00:36:33,749 --> 00:36:36,617
- You don't have any fresh fish?
- I'm afraid not, sir.

461
00:36:36,686 --> 00:36:38,881
- Your eggs are fresh?
- Yes, sir.

462
00:36:38,955 --> 00:36:42,914
I will have poached eggs. And bring me
some cigars, please. Havana cigars.

463
00:36:42,993 --> 00:36:46,395
That will be all, sir?
I'll see to it right away.

464
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:49,661
Try one of theseJamaican cigars,
Ambassador. They're good.

465
00:36:49,734 --> 00:36:53,193
Thank you, no. I do not support the work
of imperialist stooges.

466
00:36:53,272 --> 00:36:55,866
Oh, only Commie stooges, huh?

467
00:36:55,941 --> 00:36:57,499
Mr. President.

468
00:36:59,379 --> 00:37:02,678
You're gonna let that lousy Commie punk
vomit all over us like this?

469
00:37:02,749 --> 00:37:03,841
Mr. President?

470
00:37:03,917 --> 00:37:07,684
They haven't reached Premier Kissoff.
They don't know where he is...

471
00:37:07,755 --> 00:37:10,155
and he won't be back for two hours.

472
00:37:11,225 --> 00:37:13,717
Try B-8-6-5-4-3 Moscow.

473
00:37:13,795 --> 00:37:15,888
You would never have found him
through his office.

474
00:37:15,964 --> 00:37:19,992
Our premier is a man of the people,
but he is also a man, if you follow.

475
00:37:20,069 --> 00:37:22,765
- Degenerate atheistic Commie.
- What did you say?

476
00:37:22,839 --> 00:37:26,401
I said Premier Kissoff is
a degenerate atheistic Commie!

477
00:37:26,477 --> 00:37:29,412
- Have this ignorant fool...
- I'm sorry!

478
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:33,416
Mr. President,
I think they're trying the number.

479
00:37:44,063 --> 00:37:47,191
Gentlemen, you can't fight in here.
This is the War Room!

480
00:37:47,266 --> 00:37:50,100
What is going on here?
I demand an explanation.

481
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:54,436
This clumsy fool tried to plant
that ridiculous camera on me.

482
00:37:54,508 --> 00:37:57,103
You bet your sweets, Mr. Commie!
Look at this, Mr. President.

483
00:37:57,178 --> 00:38:00,773
This lousy Commie rat was taking
pictures with this of the big board!

484
00:38:01,849 --> 00:38:03,715
Mr. Ambassador!

485
00:38:03,785 --> 00:38:08,051
This clumsy fool attempted to plant
that ridiculous camera on me.

486
00:38:08,123 --> 00:38:10,991
That's a damn lie!
I saw him with my own eyes.

487
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:15,258
This is outrageous. I have never heard
of such behavior in the War Room before.

488
00:38:15,331 --> 00:38:17,823
Mr. President, I think
they're getting him on the line.

489
00:38:45,833 --> 00:38:47,767
You got to hand it to those Commies.

490
00:38:47,835 --> 00:38:52,363
Yeah. Those trucks sure look like
the real thing, don't they?

491
00:38:52,441 --> 00:38:54,375
I wonder where they got them from.

492
00:38:54,443 --> 00:38:56,707
Probably bought them
from the army as war surplus.

493
00:39:00,417 --> 00:39:04,478
Okay, open up at 200 yards.

494
00:40:01,719 --> 00:40:05,383
Tell him where you are and that
you'll speak if I say anything untrue...

495
00:40:05,457 --> 00:40:07,755
but nothing more than that.

496
00:40:09,361 --> 00:40:12,763
Alexi? Alexi, please.
I beg you.

497
00:40:13,833 --> 00:40:16,427
But I don't have a phone.

498
00:40:16,503 --> 00:40:19,064
Give him the phone.

499
00:40:45,869 --> 00:40:50,239
I've done as you asked.
Be careful. I think he is drunk.

500
00:40:53,244 --> 00:40:57,705
Hello? Hello, Dimitri?

501
00:40:57,783 --> 00:41:00,183
Listen, I can't hear too well.

502
00:41:00,252 --> 00:41:03,518
Could you turn the music down
a little?

503
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:05,524
That's much better.

504
00:41:05,592 --> 00:41:08,220
Yeah. Yeah.

505
00:41:09,497 --> 00:41:12,295
Fine. I can hear you now, Dimitri.

506
00:41:12,366 --> 00:41:15,859
Clear and plain
and coming through fine.

507
00:41:15,938 --> 00:41:20,341
I'm coming through fine, too, eh?
Good.

508
00:41:20,409 --> 00:41:24,369
Well, then, as you say,
we're both coming through fine. Good.

509
00:41:24,447 --> 00:41:26,381
It's good that you're fine...

510
00:41:26,449 --> 00:41:28,713
and I'm fine.

511
00:41:28,785 --> 00:41:32,017
I agree with you.
It's great to be fine.

512
00:41:32,923 --> 00:41:35,118
Now, Dimitri...

513
00:41:35,192 --> 00:41:40,893
you know how we've always talked
about the possibility...

514
00:41:40,966 --> 00:41:43,662
of something going wrong
with the bomb.

515
00:41:45,037 --> 00:41:47,005
The bomb, Dimitri.

516
00:41:48,207 --> 00:41:50,835
The hydrogen bomb.

517
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:53,880
Well, now, what happened is...

518
00:41:53,947 --> 00:41:58,179
one of our base commanders,
he had a sort of...

519
00:41:58,252 --> 00:42:01,484
Well, he went a little funny
in the head.

520
00:42:01,556 --> 00:42:04,650
You know, just a little funny.

521
00:42:04,726 --> 00:42:08,356
And he went and did a silly thing.

522
00:42:09,431 --> 00:42:11,365
I'll tell you what he did.

523
00:42:11,433 --> 00:42:13,766
He ordered his planes...

524
00:42:15,438 --> 00:42:17,906
to attack your country.

525
00:42:17,974 --> 00:42:20,375
Let me finish, Dimitri.

526
00:42:21,379 --> 00:42:23,347
Let me finish, Dimitri.

527
00:42:23,414 --> 00:42:26,611
Listen, how do you think
I feel about it?

528
00:42:26,684 --> 00:42:29,552
Can you imagine how I feel
about it, Dimitri?

529
00:42:31,089 --> 00:42:33,250
Why do you think I'm calling you?

530
00:42:33,325 --> 00:42:35,351
Just to say hello?

531
00:42:36,429 --> 00:42:38,829
Of course I like to speak to you!

532
00:42:38,898 --> 00:42:41,423
Of course I like to say hello!

533
00:42:41,501 --> 00:42:43,697
Not now, but anytime, Dimitri.

534
00:42:43,771 --> 00:42:47,798
I'm just calling up to tell you
something terrible has happened.

535
00:42:47,875 --> 00:42:50,868
Of course, it's a friendly call.

536
00:42:50,946 --> 00:42:55,212
Listen, if it wasn't friendly,
you probably wouldn't have even got it.

537
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:02,287
They will not reach their targets
for at least another hour.

538
00:43:02,358 --> 00:43:05,453
I am positive, Dimitri.

539
00:43:05,529 --> 00:43:07,963
I've been all over this
with your ambassador.

540
00:43:08,031 --> 00:43:10,523
It is not a trick.

541
00:43:10,602 --> 00:43:12,069
I'll tell you.

542
00:43:12,136 --> 00:43:15,970
We'd like to give your Air Staff
a complete rundown on the targets...

543
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:19,306
the flight plans
and defensive systems of the planes.

544
00:43:19,378 --> 00:43:24,315
Yes, if we're unable
to recall the planes...

545
00:43:24,383 --> 00:43:27,046
I'd say, well...

546
00:43:28,455 --> 00:43:32,825
we're just gonna have to help you
destroy them, Dimitri.

547
00:43:32,894 --> 00:43:35,829
I know they're our boys.

548
00:43:35,897 --> 00:43:38,422
Listen. Now, who should we call?

549
00:43:40,269 --> 00:43:44,763
Who should we call?
Sorry, you faded away.

550
00:43:45,974 --> 00:43:49,843
The Peoples Central
Air Defense Headquarters.

551
00:43:49,913 --> 00:43:52,211
Where is that, Dimitri?

552
00:43:52,282 --> 00:43:54,410
In Omsk. Right.

553
00:43:55,486 --> 00:43:56,748
Yes.

554
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:59,721
You'll call them first, will you?

555
00:44:01,226 --> 00:44:04,161
Do you happen to have the phone number
on you, Dimitri?

556
00:44:06,031 --> 00:44:09,024
What? I see.
Just ask for Omsk information.

557
00:44:11,103 --> 00:44:15,234
I'm sorry too, Dimitri.
I'm very sorry.

558
00:44:15,309 --> 00:44:19,143
All right, you're sorrier than I am.
But I am sorry as well.

559
00:44:21,448 --> 00:44:23,713
I am as sorry as you are, Dimitri.

560
00:44:23,785 --> 00:44:25,753
Don't say that you're more sorry
than I am...

561
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:28,755
because I'm capable of being
just as sorry as you are.

562
00:44:28,823 --> 00:44:30,758
So we're both sorry, all right?

563
00:44:30,826 --> 00:44:32,259
All right.

564
00:44:33,495 --> 00:44:37,762
Yes, he's right here. Yes, he wants
to talk to you. Just a second.

565
00:44:50,314 --> 00:44:52,010
What?

566
00:45:10,704 --> 00:45:13,572
What? What is it? What?

567
00:45:13,641 --> 00:45:16,667
The fools. The mad fools.

568
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:20,241
What's happened?

569
00:45:20,316 --> 00:45:22,648
The doomsday machine.

570
00:45:22,718 --> 00:45:25,278
The doomsday machine?
What is that?

571
00:45:25,354 --> 00:45:30,759
A device which will destroy
all human and animal life on Earth.

572
00:45:30,827 --> 00:45:33,091
All human and animal life?

573
00:45:47,946 --> 00:45:50,245
- Mandrake?
- Yes, Jack?

574
00:45:51,551 --> 00:45:55,146
Have you ever seen a Commie
drink a glass of water?

575
00:45:55,221 --> 00:45:59,784
Well, I can't say I have, Jack.

576
00:46:00,995 --> 00:46:05,865
Vodka. That's what they drink,
isn't it? Never water.

577
00:46:05,934 --> 00:46:10,338
I believe that's what they drink, yes.

578
00:46:10,406 --> 00:46:13,864
On no account will a Commie
ever drink water...

579
00:46:13,943 --> 00:46:16,275
and not without good reason.

580
00:46:17,347 --> 00:46:20,009
Oh, yes.

581
00:46:20,084 --> 00:46:25,148
I can't quite see
what you're getting at.

582
00:46:26,291 --> 00:46:29,488
Water. That's what I'm getting at.
Water.

583
00:46:31,029 --> 00:46:34,488
Mandrake, water is the source
of all life.

584
00:46:36,035 --> 00:46:39,631
Seven-tenths of this Earth's surface
is water.

585
00:46:39,706 --> 00:46:43,039
Why, do you realize that...

586
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:46,171
70% of you is water?

587
00:46:46,247 --> 00:46:47,680
Good Lord.

588
00:46:47,748 --> 00:46:52,880
And as human beings,
you and I need fresh, pure water...

589
00:46:52,955 --> 00:46:56,550
to replenish
our precious bodily fluids.

590
00:46:56,625 --> 00:46:59,355
- You beginning to understand?
- Yes.

591
00:47:06,703 --> 00:47:11,971
Have you never wondered why I drink
only distilled water...

592
00:47:12,042 --> 00:47:16,446
or rainwater,
and only pure grain alcohol?

593
00:47:16,515 --> 00:47:19,814
It did occur to me, Jack, yes.

594
00:47:20,919 --> 00:47:24,879
Have you ever heard of fluoridation
of water?

595
00:47:25,958 --> 00:47:29,793
Yes, I have heard of that, Jack, yes.

596
00:47:29,863 --> 00:47:31,797
Do you know what it is?

597
00:47:31,865 --> 00:47:34,993
No, no, I don't know what it is.

598
00:47:35,068 --> 00:47:39,005
Do you realize that fluoridation...

599
00:47:39,073 --> 00:47:41,906
is the most monstrously conceived...

600
00:47:41,976 --> 00:47:44,775
and dangerous Communist plot
we have ever had to face?

601
00:47:51,188 --> 00:47:53,156
Two can play at that game, soldier.

602
00:47:58,262 --> 00:48:00,992
That's nice shooting, soldier!

603
00:48:25,459 --> 00:48:27,519
Mandrake, come here.

604
00:48:27,596 --> 00:48:29,621
You calling me, Jack?

605
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:32,132
Come over here
and help me with this belt.

606
00:48:35,171 --> 00:48:38,163
I haven't had very much experience...

607
00:48:38,241 --> 00:48:41,040
with those sort of machines.

608
00:48:41,111 --> 00:48:44,911
I've only ever pressed a button
in my old Spitfire.

609
00:48:44,982 --> 00:48:48,612
In the name of Her Majesty and the
Continental Congress, feed me this belt.

610
00:48:48,686 --> 00:48:53,453
Jack, I'd love to come,
but what's happened, you see...

611
00:48:53,524 --> 00:48:56,323
the string in my leg is gone.

612
00:48:57,396 --> 00:49:01,196
- The what?
- The string. I never told you.

613
00:49:01,267 --> 00:49:05,170
I've got a gammy leg.
Oh, dear. Gone. Shot off.

614
00:49:07,307 --> 00:49:10,971
Mandrake, come over here.
The redcoats are coming.

615
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:16,244
When it is detonated, it will produce
enough radioactive fallout...

616
00:49:16,318 --> 00:49:18,252
so that in ten months...

617
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:21,414
the surface of the Earth
will be as dead as the moon!

618
00:49:21,490 --> 00:49:24,460
Come on, De Sadesky!
That's ridiculous!

619
00:49:24,527 --> 00:49:28,657
Our studies show even the worst fallout
is down to a safe level after two weeks.

620
00:49:28,731 --> 00:49:33,760
- You never heard of cobalt theoium G.
- What about it?

621
00:49:33,837 --> 00:49:37,934
Cobalt thorium G has
a radioactive half-life of 93 years.

622
00:49:38,009 --> 00:49:41,103
If you take 50 H bombs
in the 100 megaton range...

623
00:49:41,179 --> 00:49:43,579
and jacket them
with cobalt thorium G...

624
00:49:43,648 --> 00:49:48,279
when they are exploded,
they will produce a doomsday shroud...

625
00:49:48,354 --> 00:49:50,652
a lethal cloud of radioactivity...

626
00:49:50,723 --> 00:49:55,161
which will encircle the Earth
for 93 years!

627
00:49:55,228 --> 00:49:58,789
What a load of Commie bull.
I mean, after all.

628
00:49:59,867 --> 00:50:02,529
I'm afraid I don't understand
something, Alexi.

629
00:50:02,603 --> 00:50:06,232
Is the premier threatening to explode it
if our planes carry out their attack?

630
00:50:06,308 --> 00:50:08,868
No, sir. It is not a thing
a sane man would do.

631
00:50:08,944 --> 00:50:11,879
The doomsday machine is designed
to trigger itself automatically.

632
00:50:11,947 --> 00:50:14,212
Surely you can disarm it somehow.

633
00:50:14,284 --> 00:50:18,220
It is designed to explode if
any attempt is made to un-trigger it.

634
00:50:18,288 --> 00:50:19,550
Automatically?

635
00:50:19,622 --> 00:50:22,217
It's a Commie trick!
We're wasting valuable time!

636
00:50:22,293 --> 00:50:25,387
Look at the big board!
They're getting ready to clobber us!

637
00:50:25,463 --> 00:50:30,128
This is absolute madness.
Why should you build such a thing?

638
00:50:30,202 --> 00:50:32,170
There are those of us
who fought against it.

639
00:50:32,237 --> 00:50:34,296
But in the end, we could not keep up
with the expense involved...

640
00:50:34,373 --> 00:50:38,902
in the arms race, the space race
and the peace race.

641
00:50:38,978 --> 00:50:44,212
At the same time, our people grumbled
for more nylons and washing machines.

642
00:50:44,284 --> 00:50:46,844
Our doomsday scheme cost us
just a small fraction...

643
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:50,152
of what we have been spending on defense
in a single year.

644
00:50:50,225 --> 00:50:54,662
The deciding factor was when we learned
your country was working similarly...

645
00:50:54,729 --> 00:50:56,664
and we were afraid of a doomsday gap!

646
00:50:56,732 --> 00:51:00,099
This is preposterous! I've never
approved of anything like that.

647
00:51:00,169 --> 00:51:03,002
<i>Our source was The New York Times.</i>

648
00:51:03,072 --> 00:51:06,975
Dr. Strangelove, do we have anything
like that in the works?

649
00:51:07,043 --> 00:51:09,511
A moment, please, Mr. President.

650
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:15,686
Under the authority granted me...

651
00:51:15,753 --> 00:51:19,918
as director of weapons research
and development...

652
00:51:19,992 --> 00:51:24,190
I commissioned last year
a study of this project...

653
00:51:24,263 --> 00:51:26,494
by the Bland Corporation.

654
00:51:26,566 --> 00:51:29,729
Based on the findings of the report...

655
00:51:29,803 --> 00:51:35,299
my conclusion was that this idea
was not a practical deterrent...

656
00:51:35,376 --> 00:51:39,210
for reasons which at this moment
must be all too obvious.

657
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:42,682
You mean it is possible for them
to have built such a thing?

658
00:51:46,856 --> 00:51:51,725
Mr. President, the technology required
is easily within the means...

659
00:51:51,794 --> 00:51:56,198
of even the smallest nuclear power.

660
00:51:56,266 --> 00:52:00,225
It requires only the will to do so.

661
00:52:01,239 --> 00:52:05,107
But how is it possible for this thing
to be triggered automatically...

662
00:52:05,176 --> 00:52:07,508
and at the same time
impossible to un-trigger?

663
00:52:07,579 --> 00:52:11,607
Mr. President,
it is not only possible...

664
00:52:11,684 --> 00:52:13,618
it is essential.

665
00:52:13,686 --> 00:52:18,124
That is the whole idea
of this machine, you know.

666
00:52:18,191 --> 00:52:23,391
Deterrence is the art of producing
in the mind of the enemy...

667
00:52:23,464 --> 00:52:26,058
the fear of attack.

668
00:52:26,133 --> 00:52:31,071
And so because of the automated and
irrevocable decision-making process...

669
00:52:31,139 --> 00:52:35,041
which rules out human meddling...

670
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:39,070
the doomsday machine is terrifying...

671
00:52:39,148 --> 00:52:41,241
and simple to understand...

672
00:52:41,317 --> 00:52:45,015
and completely credible
and convincing.

673
00:52:45,089 --> 00:52:48,422
I wish we had one of them
doomsday machines.

674
00:52:48,492 --> 00:52:52,088
But this is fantastic, Strangelove.
How can it be triggered automatically?

675
00:52:52,163 --> 00:52:55,963
It's remarkably simple to do that.

676
00:52:56,034 --> 00:52:59,562
When you merely wish to bury bombs...

677
00:52:59,639 --> 00:53:01,971
there's no limit to the size.

678
00:53:02,041 --> 00:53:04,271
After that, they are connected...

679
00:53:04,343 --> 00:53:08,371
to a gigantic complex of computers.

680
00:53:08,448 --> 00:53:14,183
Now then, a specific and clearly
defined set of circumstances...

681
00:53:14,255 --> 00:53:17,713
under which the bombs
are to be exploded...

682
00:53:17,792 --> 00:53:21,820
is programmed into a tape memory bank.

683
00:53:21,897 --> 00:53:24,991
Hmm. Strangelove?

684
00:53:26,068 --> 00:53:29,129
What kind of a name is that?
That ain't no Kraut name, is it?

685
00:53:29,205 --> 00:53:31,503
He changed it when he became a citizen.

686
00:53:31,575 --> 00:53:34,568
It used to be Merkwurdichliebe.

687
00:53:34,645 --> 00:53:39,014
Well, a Kraut by any other name,
uh, Stainsey?

688
00:53:40,918 --> 00:53:45,288
The whole point of
the doomsday machine...

689
00:53:45,357 --> 00:53:48,919
is lost if you keep it a secret!

690
00:53:48,995 --> 00:53:51,156
Why didn't you tell the world?

691
00:53:51,230 --> 00:53:55,633
It was to be announced
at the Party Congress on Monday.

692
00:53:55,703 --> 00:53:59,036
As you know,
the premier loves surprises.

693
00:54:47,528 --> 00:54:49,758
Stay with me, Mandrake.

694
00:54:54,936 --> 00:54:57,632
All right, now feed me.
Feed me, boy.

695
00:55:27,506 --> 00:55:32,570
Don't you think we'd be better off
away from this flying glass?

696
00:55:32,646 --> 00:55:34,705
We're okay here.

697
00:55:36,350 --> 00:55:40,377
Mandrake, do you realize that
in addition to fluoridating the water...

698
00:55:40,455 --> 00:55:44,017
there are studies underway
to fluoridate salt, flour...

699
00:55:44,093 --> 00:55:49,121
fruit juices, soup, sugar,
milk, ice cream?

700
00:55:49,198 --> 00:55:50,461
Ice cream.

701
00:55:50,533 --> 00:55:52,967
- Children's ice cream.
- Good Lord.

702
00:55:53,036 --> 00:55:55,470
You know when fluoridation
first began?

703
00:55:56,506 --> 00:55:58,441
No, I don't, Jack.

704
00:55:58,509 --> 00:56:00,977
1946.

705
00:56:01,045 --> 00:56:03,809
1946, Mandrake.

706
00:56:03,881 --> 00:56:08,182
How does that coincide with
your postwar Commie conspiracy, huh?

707
00:56:08,253 --> 00:56:11,552
It's incredibly obvious, isn't it?

708
00:56:11,623 --> 00:56:17,153
A foreign substance is introduced
into our precious bodily fluids...

709
00:56:17,230 --> 00:56:20,496
without the knowledge
of the individual.

710
00:56:20,567 --> 00:56:22,501
Certainly without any choice.

711
00:56:24,304 --> 00:56:27,604
That's the way a hard-core Commie works.

712
00:56:29,043 --> 00:56:32,274
Jack. Tell me, Jack.

713
00:56:32,347 --> 00:56:35,010
When did you first become...

714
00:56:35,084 --> 00:56:37,848
Well, develop this theory?

715
00:56:38,954 --> 00:56:41,185
Well, l...

716
00:56:41,258 --> 00:56:44,819
I first became aware of it, Mandrake...

717
00:56:44,895 --> 00:56:46,886
during the physical act of love.

718
00:56:48,666 --> 00:56:52,932
Yes, a profound sense of fatigue...

719
00:56:53,004 --> 00:56:55,565
feeling of emptiness followed.

720
00:56:55,641 --> 00:56:59,407
Luckily I was able to interpret
these feelings correctly.

721
00:57:00,813 --> 00:57:02,441
Loss of essence.

722
00:57:04,083 --> 00:57:07,814
I can assure you it has not recurred,
Mandrake.

723
00:57:07,887 --> 00:57:10,823
Women sense my power...

724
00:57:12,059 --> 00:57:14,186
and they seek the life essence.

725
00:57:15,462 --> 00:57:18,796
I do not avoid women, Mandrake.

726
00:57:18,867 --> 00:57:21,768
But I do deny them my essence.

727
00:57:21,837 --> 00:57:24,705
Yes, yes, Jack.

728
00:57:37,354 --> 00:57:39,482
Cease fire!

729
00:58:00,781 --> 00:58:02,476
My boys must have surrendered.

730
00:58:02,550 --> 00:58:04,882
There it is.

731
00:58:04,952 --> 00:58:06,784
Jack, listen.

732
00:58:06,855 --> 00:58:10,188
While there's still time, I beg you,
let's recall the Wing and...

733
00:58:12,327 --> 00:58:15,161
Those boys were like my children.

734
00:58:16,733 --> 00:58:18,792
Now they let me down.

735
00:58:18,868 --> 00:58:20,563
No, not a bit.

736
00:58:20,637 --> 00:58:23,436
I'm sure they all gave it
their very best.

737
00:58:23,507 --> 00:58:25,998
I'm equally sure they all died
thinking of you...

738
00:58:26,076 --> 00:58:28,807
every man jack of them, Jack.

739
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,542
Supposing a bit of water
has gone off, eh?

740
00:58:31,616 --> 00:58:33,914
Certainly one can never be too sure
about those things.

741
00:58:33,985 --> 00:58:36,955
But look at me.
Do I look all rancid and clotted?

742
00:58:37,023 --> 00:58:39,821
Look at me, Jack. Look.

743
00:58:39,892 --> 00:58:43,989
And I drink a lot of water.
I'm what you might call a water man.

744
00:58:44,064 --> 00:58:47,431
And I can swear to you, my boy,
swear to you...

745
00:58:47,501 --> 00:58:49,766
that there's nothing wrong
with my bodily fluids.

746
00:58:49,837 --> 00:58:52,328
Not a thing, Jackie.

747
00:58:52,407 --> 00:58:54,705
Mandrake, were you ever
a prisoner of war?

748
00:58:54,776 --> 00:58:58,440
Well, Jack, the time's running very...

749
00:58:58,514 --> 00:59:01,574
- What?
- Were you ever a prisoner of war?

750
00:59:01,650 --> 00:59:03,743
Yes, I was, as a matter of fact.

751
00:59:03,819 --> 00:59:06,914
Did they torture you?

752
00:59:06,990 --> 00:59:10,016
Yes, they did.
I was tortured by theJapanese.

753
00:59:10,093 --> 00:59:11,755
Not a pretty story.

754
00:59:11,829 --> 00:59:13,421
What happened?

755
00:59:13,497 --> 00:59:17,797
I don't know, Jack. It's difficult
to think under these conditions.

756
00:59:17,868 --> 00:59:20,099
Well, what happened was...

757
00:59:20,172 --> 00:59:23,573
they got me on the old
Rangoon-Inchinawa Railway.

758
00:59:23,642 --> 00:59:28,012
I was laying train lines
for the bloodyJapanese puff-puffs.

759
00:59:28,081 --> 00:59:31,312
No, I mean, when they tortured you,
did you talk?

760
00:59:33,053 --> 00:59:35,044
No, l...

761
00:59:35,122 --> 00:59:39,388
Well, I don't think they wanted me
to talk, really, or say anything.

762
00:59:39,460 --> 00:59:42,555
It was their way of having
a bit of fun, the swine.

763
00:59:42,630 --> 00:59:45,963
The strange thing is,
they make such bloody good cameras.

764
00:59:47,703 --> 00:59:53,335
Those clowns outside will give me
a good going-over soon for the code.

765
00:59:56,346 --> 00:59:59,713
Yes, you may have quite a point
there, Jack.

766
01:00:00,817 --> 01:00:03,810
I don't know how well
I could stand up under torture.

767
01:00:03,888 --> 01:00:07,153
The answer to that is,
no one ever does.

768
01:00:07,225 --> 01:00:11,356
And my advise to you
is to give me the code now.

769
01:00:11,430 --> 01:00:14,331
If those devils come back
and try any rough stuff...

770
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:17,666
we'll fight them together
like we did just now on the floor.

771
01:00:17,737 --> 01:00:21,264
You with your gun and me
with a belt of ammo, feeding you.

772
01:00:21,341 --> 01:00:24,140
"Feed me," you said,
and I was feeding you, Jack.

773
01:00:24,211 --> 01:00:26,873
You know, Mandrake...

774
01:00:26,947 --> 01:00:30,179
I happen to believe in
a life after this one...

775
01:00:31,686 --> 01:00:35,122
and I know I'll have to answer
for what I've done.

776
01:00:36,958 --> 01:00:38,426
And I think I can.

777
01:00:38,494 --> 01:00:41,725
Yes, of course you can.
Of course you can. You can.

778
01:00:41,798 --> 01:00:44,232
I'm a religious man myself,
you know.

779
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:48,169
I believe in all that sort of thing
and I'm hoping, you know, Jack...

780
01:00:48,238 --> 01:00:51,105
You've dropped your gun, Jack.

781
01:00:51,175 --> 01:00:54,771
No, Jack, let me take that for you.

782
01:00:54,846 --> 01:00:58,338
You know what I'm hoping? I'm hoping
you're going to give me the code, boy.

783
01:01:00,119 --> 01:01:02,747
You're going to wash and brush up?
What a good idea.

784
01:01:02,822 --> 01:01:05,416
Always did wonders for a man,
a wash and brush up.

785
01:01:05,491 --> 01:01:08,256
Water on the back of the neck
makes you feel marvelous.

786
01:01:08,328 --> 01:01:11,092
That's what we need: Water on
the back of the neck and the code.

787
01:01:11,164 --> 01:01:14,760
Supposing I play a little guessing game
with you, Jack boy?

788
01:01:14,836 --> 01:01:17,828
I'll try and guess
what the code is...

789
01:01:34,324 --> 01:01:38,819
Copilot to navigator.
I'm ready with the fuel figures now.

790
01:01:38,896 --> 01:01:41,866
We have 109,000 total...

791
01:01:41,933 --> 01:01:44,766
<i>79,000 in the mains...</i>

792
01:01:44,836 --> 01:01:47,634
<i>and 30,000 in the auxiliaries.</i>

793
01:01:47,706 --> 01:01:49,641
<i>And that works out
to roughly...</i>

794
01:01:49,709 --> 01:01:53,167
<i>seven hours, 15 minutes
endurance from this time.</i>

795
01:01:54,313 --> 01:01:55,746
D.S.O. To Captain.

796
01:01:55,815 --> 01:01:58,910
I have an unidentified
radar blip.

797
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:02,914
Distance: 60 miles.

798
01:02:04,092 --> 01:02:07,255
Approximate speed:
Mach three.

799
01:02:07,328 --> 01:02:09,262
Looks like
a missile tracking us.

800
01:02:12,201 --> 01:02:14,260
Confirmed:
Definite missile track.

801
01:02:14,336 --> 01:02:16,395
<i>Commence evasive action right.</i>

802
01:02:22,646 --> 01:02:26,310
<i>Missile still closing range.</i>

803
01:02:26,384 --> 01:02:30,377
Distance: 50 miles.
Continue evasive action.

804
01:02:30,454 --> 01:02:33,185
Lock E.C.M. To target intercept mode.

805
01:02:33,258 --> 01:02:36,887
E.C.M. Locked to
target intercept mode.

806
01:02:36,962 --> 01:02:39,397
Missile still tracking
and closing distance.

807
01:02:39,465 --> 01:02:43,458
Range: 40 miles.
Continue evasive action.

808
01:02:46,373 --> 01:02:50,639
<i>Electronic Guidance Scrambler
to blue grid.</i>

809
01:02:50,711 --> 01:02:54,204
<i>Missile still tracking steady
and closing distance.</i>

810
01:02:54,282 --> 01:02:56,216
Range: 30 miles.

811
01:02:58,486 --> 01:03:02,719
<i>Missile still closing true and steady.
Continue evasive action.</i>

812
01:03:10,267 --> 01:03:12,258
Range: 20 miles.

813
01:03:12,336 --> 01:03:16,205
<i>Missile still closing distance
and tracking steady.</i>

814
01:03:16,274 --> 01:03:18,708
Attack range gate
on maximum scan.

815
01:03:18,776 --> 01:03:21,210
Range gate on maximum scan.

816
01:03:21,279 --> 01:03:24,147
Range: 10 miles.

817
01:03:24,216 --> 01:03:28,175
Missile track deflecting.
Continue evasive action.

818
01:03:28,254 --> 01:03:31,520
Deflection increasing.
Range: Eight miles.

819
01:03:31,591 --> 01:03:35,527
Deflection still increasing.
Range: Six miles.

820
01:03:35,595 --> 01:03:38,292
Missile still deflecting.
Range: Four miles.

821
01:03:44,106 --> 01:03:47,303
Range: Two miles.
Missile still deflecting.

822
01:03:47,376 --> 01:03:49,640
Range: One mile.
Missile detonated!

823
01:03:56,319 --> 01:03:58,413
- Start lever to cut off!
- Cut off!

824
01:04:01,825 --> 01:04:03,258
We're losin' power!

825
01:04:11,703 --> 01:04:14,036
Re-select essential power!

826
01:04:14,106 --> 01:04:16,131
Essential power re-selected.

827
01:04:22,749 --> 01:04:24,683
The hatch is stuck!

828
01:04:28,256 --> 01:04:29,689
Hit emergency power!

829
01:04:32,193 --> 01:04:35,027
- Extinguishers!
- Roger!

830
01:04:41,771 --> 01:04:45,036
- Transfer switches!
- Transferred!

831
01:04:45,108 --> 01:04:47,372
- Boost pumps off!
- Cut off!

832
01:04:59,124 --> 01:05:01,115
Fuel valves three, four and six!

833
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:15,073
Give me full power!

834
01:05:27,957 --> 01:05:30,551
Peace on Earth.

835
01:05:35,198 --> 01:05:37,894
P.O.E.

836
01:05:37,968 --> 01:05:40,836
Purity of Essence.

837
01:05:40,905 --> 01:05:44,432
O.P.O.E.

838
01:05:55,588 --> 01:05:57,920
Put your hands over your head.

839
01:05:57,991 --> 01:06:00,620
What do you think you're doing?
Who are you?

840
01:06:00,694 --> 01:06:02,559
Put your hands over your head.

841
01:06:02,630 --> 01:06:06,225
What kind of suit
do you call that, fella?

842
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:08,292
What do you mean, suit?

843
01:06:08,370 --> 01:06:10,804
This happens to be
an R.A.F. Uniform...

844
01:06:10,872 --> 01:06:15,207
and I am Group Captain Lionel Mandrake,
General Ripper's executive officer.

845
01:06:15,278 --> 01:06:16,802
Where's General Ripper?

846
01:06:16,879 --> 01:06:19,712
He's dead, in the bathroom.

847
01:06:19,782 --> 01:06:21,944
Where's the bathroom?

848
01:06:22,019 --> 01:06:23,452
Next to you.

849
01:06:32,931 --> 01:06:35,662
I don't know what stupid game
this is you're playing...

850
01:06:35,734 --> 01:06:37,861
but I've got a good idea
what the recall code is...

851
01:06:37,937 --> 01:06:40,462
and I have to get in touch
with SAC headquarters immediately!

852
01:06:40,539 --> 01:06:44,237
Put your hands over your head
and keep 'em there! Go on.

853
01:06:44,311 --> 01:06:46,006
Got any witnesses?

854
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:48,013
What are you talking about?
He shot himself!

855
01:06:48,081 --> 01:06:50,107
While he was shavin'?

856
01:06:50,184 --> 01:06:53,347
Now look, Colonel Bat Guano...

857
01:06:53,421 --> 01:06:55,889
if that really is your name...

858
01:06:55,957 --> 01:06:59,826
may I tell you that I have
a very good idea...

859
01:06:59,895 --> 01:07:02,921
I think, hope, pray...
what the recall code is.

860
01:07:02,998 --> 01:07:05,729
It's some theme he kept repeating.
A variation on...

861
01:07:05,802 --> 01:07:09,033
"Peace on Earth" or "Purity of Essence,"
one of those.

862
01:07:09,105 --> 01:07:12,940
Put your hands on top of your head.
Start walkin'.

863
01:07:13,010 --> 01:07:16,241
Don't you know that General Ripper
went mad...

864
01:07:16,313 --> 01:07:19,715
and sent the whole Wing
to attack the Soviets?

865
01:07:19,784 --> 01:07:23,311
- What are you talkin' about?
- I'll tell you what I'm talking about.

866
01:07:23,388 --> 01:07:27,485
I'm going to pick up this red telephone,
which is connected to SAC...

867
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:28,993
and I hope...

868
01:07:30,530 --> 01:07:32,691
Blast. Blast.

869
01:07:32,765 --> 01:07:36,759
Shot away, I expect, by one of your men
during this ridiculous fighting!

870
01:07:38,205 --> 01:07:40,231
Right.

871
01:07:40,308 --> 01:07:43,709
All right, Charlie, I've been
wastin' too much time on you.

872
01:07:43,778 --> 01:07:47,579
I got a lot of wounded men outside.
Start walkin'.

873
01:08:09,875 --> 01:08:13,709
All the radio gear is out,
including the C.R.M. 114.

874
01:08:13,779 --> 01:08:16,943
I think the auto-destruct mechanism
got hit and blew itself up.

875
01:08:21,454 --> 01:08:24,686
The fire is out.
The emergency power is on.

876
01:08:24,758 --> 01:08:28,250
Everything checks out all right.
Will advise.

877
01:08:28,329 --> 01:08:30,058
Roger. Navigator?

878
01:08:30,130 --> 01:08:35,592
I've worked out our rate of fuel loss
at approximately 1-6-2 per minute.

879
01:08:35,670 --> 01:08:38,469
<i>This gives us a radius of action
sufficient to take out...</i>

880
01:08:38,541 --> 01:08:41,908
<i>primary and secondary targets,
but we will not...</i>

881
01:08:41,978 --> 01:08:46,143
repeat, not be able to make it back
to any base or neutral country.

882
01:08:47,084 --> 01:08:49,644
<i>However, we would have
enough fuel to ditch...</i>

883
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:52,451
<i>at weather ship Tango Delta...</i>

884
01:08:52,523 --> 01:08:55,788
<i>grid coordinates 0-0-3-6-9-1.</i>

885
01:09:00,566 --> 01:09:03,000
Well, boys,
we got three engines out.

886
01:09:03,068 --> 01:09:06,869
We got more holes in us
than a horse trader's mule.

887
01:09:06,940 --> 01:09:08,965
The radio is gone,
and we're leakin' fuel.

888
01:09:09,042 --> 01:09:12,478
And if we was flyin' any lower,
we'd need sleigh bells on this thing.

889
01:09:12,545 --> 01:09:15,538
But we got one little budge
on them Ruskies.

890
01:09:15,616 --> 01:09:17,550
At this height
they might harpoon us...

891
01:09:17,618 --> 01:09:20,713
but they sure ain't gonna spot us
on no radar screen.

892
01:09:31,901 --> 01:09:33,835
The other way.

893
01:09:33,903 --> 01:09:36,304
- Where are you taking me?
- To the main gate.

894
01:09:38,375 --> 01:09:41,833
Colonel, I must know what you think
has been going on here.

895
01:09:41,912 --> 01:09:43,847
- You wanna know what I think?
- Yes.

896
01:09:43,915 --> 01:09:46,611
I think you're some kind
of deviated "prevert."

897
01:09:46,685 --> 01:09:49,416
I think General Ripper found out
about your "preversion"...

898
01:09:49,488 --> 01:09:51,786
and that you were organizing
some kind of mutiny of"preverts."

899
01:09:51,857 --> 01:09:54,257
Now, move!

900
01:09:54,326 --> 01:09:57,660
On top of that, I don't know anything
about any planes attacking Russia.

901
01:09:57,731 --> 01:10:01,531
I was told to get Ripper on the phone
with the President of the United States.

902
01:10:01,601 --> 01:10:06,369
Now just one second.
You just said "the president."

903
01:10:06,441 --> 01:10:08,671
What about the president?

904
01:10:08,743 --> 01:10:11,907
The president wants to speak
to General Ripper, doesn't he?

905
01:10:11,980 --> 01:10:14,574
Now, General Ripper is dead,
is he not?

906
01:10:14,650 --> 01:10:16,880
I am General Ripper's
executive officer...

907
01:10:16,952 --> 01:10:19,922
so the president will want
to speak to me, won't he?

908
01:10:19,989 --> 01:10:23,720
There's a telephone box over there
and the line may be open.

909
01:10:23,793 --> 01:10:26,592
You wanna talk to
the President of the United States?

910
01:10:26,664 --> 01:10:29,531
I don't want to talk to him, Colonel,
I've got to talk to him.

911
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:33,264
And if you don't put that gun away
and stop this stupid nonsense...

912
01:10:33,338 --> 01:10:37,365
the Court of Inquiry on this
will give you such a pranging...

913
01:10:37,442 --> 01:10:41,539
you'll be lucky to end up wearing the
uniform of a bloody toilet attendant!

914
01:10:46,352 --> 01:10:49,982
Go ahead, try and get the President
of the United States on the phone.

915
01:10:52,659 --> 01:10:54,719
Try any "preversions,"
I'll blow your head off.

916
01:11:09,346 --> 01:11:12,179
Operator? This is
Group Captain Lionel Mandrake.

917
01:11:12,249 --> 01:11:14,308
I'm speaking from
Burpelson Air Force Base.

918
01:11:14,384 --> 01:11:18,287
Something urgent has come up and I want
you to place a person-to-person call...

919
01:11:18,356 --> 01:11:21,450
with President Merkin Muffley
in the Pentagon, Washington, D.C.

920
01:11:22,828 --> 01:11:26,025
<i>Burpelson 3-9-1-8-0.</i>

921
01:11:27,232 --> 01:11:32,296
No, I'm perfectly serious.
The President of the United States.

922
01:11:32,372 --> 01:11:35,273
I'm sorry,
I haven't got enough change.

923
01:11:35,341 --> 01:11:38,778
Could you make this
a collect call, Operator?

924
01:11:50,725 --> 01:11:54,355
Just one second, Operator.
They won't accept the call.

925
01:11:54,430 --> 01:11:56,330
Have you got 55 cents?

926
01:11:56,399 --> 01:11:59,426
Do you think I'd go into combat
with loose change in my pocket?

927
01:12:01,805 --> 01:12:04,706
Operator, look.

928
01:12:04,775 --> 01:12:08,268
Is it possible to make this
an ordinary trunk call?

929
01:12:08,346 --> 01:12:11,110
Well, what do you call it?
You know...

930
01:12:11,182 --> 01:12:14,175
Oh, station-to-station.

931
01:12:18,290 --> 01:12:21,783
Oh, blast!
I'm still 20 cents short.

932
01:12:23,663 --> 01:12:27,100
Operator, hold on.
I shan't keep you a second.

933
01:12:27,168 --> 01:12:31,332
Colonel, that Coca-Cola machine.
I want you to shoot the lock off it.

934
01:12:31,405 --> 01:12:33,464
There may be change in there.

935
01:12:37,012 --> 01:12:38,479
That's private property.

936
01:12:38,547 --> 01:12:41,483
Can you possibly imagine
what is going to happen to you...

937
01:12:41,551 --> 01:12:44,247
your frame outlook,
way of life and everything...

938
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:48,849
when they learn you have obstructed
a phone call to the president?

939
01:12:48,926 --> 01:12:52,919
Can you imagine?
Shoot it off!

940
01:12:52,997 --> 01:12:56,627
Shoot with the gun! That's what
the bullets are for, you twit!

941
01:12:56,701 --> 01:13:00,159
Okay, I'm gonna get
your money for you.

942
01:13:00,238 --> 01:13:04,369
But if you don't get the president on
the phone, you know what's gonna happen?

943
01:13:04,443 --> 01:13:08,038
You're gonna have to answer
to the Coca-Cola Company.

944
01:13:17,358 --> 01:13:20,293
<i>This is SAC
Communications Control.</i>

945
01:13:20,361 --> 01:13:23,762
<i>The recall code O.P. E...</i>

946
01:13:23,831 --> 01:13:25,766
<i>is being acknowledged "roger"...</i>

947
01:13:25,834 --> 01:13:30,737
<i>by elements of
the 8-4-3 Bomb Wing.</i>

948
01:13:30,806 --> 01:13:32,798
<i>These are the details.</i>

949
01:13:32,876 --> 01:13:37,438
<i>Missions 12, 22, 30 and 38...</i>

950
01:13:37,514 --> 01:13:41,076
<i>are reported destroyed
by enemy action.</i>

951
01:13:41,152 --> 01:13:45,748
<i>All other missions have
acknowledged recall code.</i>

952
01:13:45,824 --> 01:13:47,758
<i>This is SAC Communications Control.</i>

953
01:13:47,826 --> 01:13:49,487
<i>Over and out.</i>

954
01:13:49,561 --> 01:13:51,461
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

955
01:13:51,530 --> 01:13:53,931
Gentlemen.

956
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,934
Mr. President.

957
01:13:56,002 --> 01:13:58,095
I'm not a sentimentalist by nature...

958
01:13:58,171 --> 01:14:01,437
but I think I know what's
in every heart in this room.

959
01:14:01,508 --> 01:14:05,342
I think we all ought
to bow our heads...

960
01:14:05,412 --> 01:14:07,472
and give a prayer of thanks
for our deliverance.

961
01:14:07,549 --> 01:14:08,982
Lord...

962
01:14:10,218 --> 01:14:14,815
we have heard the wings
of the Angel of Death...

963
01:14:14,890 --> 01:14:17,757
fluttering over our heads
from the Valley of Fear.

964
01:14:17,827 --> 01:14:20,489
You have seen fit to deliver us
from the forces of evil...

965
01:14:20,563 --> 01:14:22,156
Excuse me, sir.

966
01:14:22,232 --> 01:14:25,360
Premier Kissoff s calling again
and he's hopping mad.

967
01:14:32,110 --> 01:14:36,047
Fuel flow on active engines
and leakage has increased.

968
01:14:36,115 --> 01:14:40,142
Now works out at 2-0-5.

969
01:14:41,220 --> 01:14:43,212
Estimate remaining fuel...

970
01:14:43,289 --> 01:14:47,191
<i>at 8-7-9-0.</i>

971
01:14:50,531 --> 01:14:54,399
Roger.
Confirm 2-0-5 per minute...

972
01:14:54,468 --> 01:14:58,530
<i>and remaining fuel 8-7-9-0.</i>

973
01:15:05,048 --> 01:15:09,144
No, no, Dimitri,
there must be some mistake.

974
01:15:09,218 --> 01:15:11,277
No, I'm certain of that.

975
01:15:11,354 --> 01:15:15,553
I'm perfectly certain
of that, Dimitri.

976
01:15:15,626 --> 01:15:18,527
Just a second.
You know what he says?

977
01:15:18,595 --> 01:15:20,860
He says one of the planes
hasn't turned back.

978
01:15:20,932 --> 01:15:23,526
He says according to information
forwarded by our Air Staffs...

979
01:15:23,601 --> 01:15:26,537
it's headed for
the missile complex at Laputa.

980
01:15:29,542 --> 01:15:32,477
That's impossible, Mr. President.

981
01:15:32,545 --> 01:15:34,605
I mean,
look at the big board.

982
01:15:34,681 --> 01:15:37,809
Thirty-four planes, 30 recalls
acknowledged and four splashes...

983
01:15:37,884 --> 01:15:40,752
and one of them
was targeted for Laputa.

984
01:15:43,691 --> 01:15:46,888
Dimitri, look, we've got
an acknowledgement from every plane...

985
01:15:46,961 --> 01:15:50,227
except the four you've shot down.

986
01:15:57,574 --> 01:15:59,974
Hang on a second, Dimitri.

987
01:16:00,043 --> 01:16:03,377
He says their air defense now only
claims three aircraft confirmed.

988
01:16:03,447 --> 01:16:05,915
The fourth may only be damaged.

989
01:16:08,085 --> 01:16:10,020
Mr. President...

990
01:16:10,088 --> 01:16:12,454
I'm beginnin' to smell
a big, fat Commie rat.

991
01:16:12,524 --> 01:16:16,393
I mean, supposin' Kissoff is lyin'
about that fourth plane...

992
01:16:16,462 --> 01:16:18,623
just lookin' for
an excuse to clobber us?

993
01:16:18,698 --> 01:16:21,132
If the spaghetti hits the fan,
we're in trouble.

994
01:16:25,239 --> 01:16:27,833
Dimitri, look,
if this report is true...

995
01:16:27,908 --> 01:16:31,538
and the plane manages
to bomb the target...

996
01:16:31,613 --> 01:16:35,845
is this gonna set off
the doomsday machine?

997
01:16:39,088 --> 01:16:41,056
Are you sure?

998
01:16:42,258 --> 01:16:46,821
Well, I guess you're just gonna have
to get that plane, Dimitri.

999
01:16:46,897 --> 01:16:49,957
I'm sorry they're jamming
your radar and flying so low...

1000
01:16:50,033 --> 01:16:52,229
but they're trained to do it.

1001
01:16:52,303 --> 01:16:53,964
It's initiative.

1002
01:16:55,673 --> 01:16:58,540
Look, Dimitri, you know
exactly where they're going...

1003
01:16:58,609 --> 01:17:01,773
and I'm sure your entire air defense
can stop a single plane.

1004
01:17:04,950 --> 01:17:09,547
It's not gonna help either one of us
if the doomsday machine goes off, is it?

1005
01:17:11,090 --> 01:17:16,358
There's no point in you getting
hysterical at a moment like this!

1006
01:17:16,430 --> 01:17:20,662
Keep your feet on the ground
when you're talking, Dimitri.

1007
01:17:20,734 --> 01:17:22,999
I am not...
I am not getting...

1008
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:25,505
No, Dimitri, I'm just worried.

1009
01:17:25,574 --> 01:17:27,474
That's all.

1010
01:17:27,542 --> 01:17:30,603
Now look, if our Air Staffs say
its primary target is Laputa...

1011
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:34,639
and its secondary target is Borchov,
it's true.

1012
01:17:34,717 --> 01:17:36,151
You gotta believe it!

1013
01:17:36,220 --> 01:17:39,951
Dimitri, can I give you
just one word...

1014
01:17:40,023 --> 01:17:43,357
Can I give you just one word
of advice, Dimitri?

1015
01:17:43,428 --> 01:17:45,089
Listen, Dimitri.

1016
01:17:45,163 --> 01:17:48,724
Put everything you've got into
those two sectors, and you can't miss!

1017
01:17:55,107 --> 01:17:58,771
Sir, if we continue to lose fuel
at the present rate...

1018
01:17:58,845 --> 01:18:02,975
I estimate we only have
38 minutes flying time...

1019
01:18:03,049 --> 01:18:05,518
which will not even take us
as far as the primary.

1020
01:18:05,586 --> 01:18:09,522
Doggone it, Sweets, you told me that
you could get me to the primary!

1021
01:18:09,590 --> 01:18:13,425
I'm sorry, sir. That estimate was based
on the original loss rate factor...

1022
01:18:13,495 --> 01:18:15,292
not at 2-0-5.

1023
01:18:15,364 --> 01:18:17,628
I don't give a hoot in hell
how you do it...

1024
01:18:17,699 --> 01:18:19,861
you just get me to
the primary, you hear?

1025
01:18:19,936 --> 01:18:23,372
I'm sorry, sir,
but those are the figures.

1026
01:18:23,439 --> 01:18:26,705
We'll be lucky to reach
weather ship at Tango Delta.

1027
01:18:26,777 --> 01:18:28,972
Well, shoot!

1028
01:18:29,046 --> 01:18:33,381
We ain't come this far just
to dump this thing in the drink.

1029
01:18:33,451 --> 01:18:35,442
What's the nearest
target of opportunity?

1030
01:18:44,230 --> 01:18:46,961
Sir, if the rate of loss
does not increase...

1031
01:18:47,034 --> 01:18:50,800
we have a chance
to reach target 3-8-4...

1032
01:18:50,871 --> 01:18:55,707
grid coordinate 0-0-3-6-9-1...

1033
01:18:55,777 --> 01:18:59,645
and possibly make it from there
to the Tango Delta weather ship.

1034
01:18:59,714 --> 01:19:01,842
What kind of a target
is that, anyhow?

1035
01:19:01,917 --> 01:19:05,853
Sir, that's the I.C.B.M.
Complex at Kotloss.

1036
01:19:05,921 --> 01:19:11,656
All right.
Designating new target: 3-8-4.

1037
01:19:11,728 --> 01:19:14,720
<i>Give me a headin'on that just as soon
as you get it worked out.</i>

1038
01:19:26,912 --> 01:19:31,782
We'll keep our fingers crossed.
Remember, we're all in this together.

1039
01:19:31,851 --> 01:19:35,685
We're right behind you,
we're with you all the way.

1040
01:19:35,755 --> 01:19:39,487
Yes. We'll keep the line open.

1041
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:40,993
All right, Dimitri.

1042
01:19:43,364 --> 01:19:44,798
General Turgidson...

1043
01:19:44,866 --> 01:19:48,097
is there really a chance
for that plane to get through?

1044
01:19:49,804 --> 01:19:52,239
Mr. President,
if I may speak freely.

1045
01:19:52,308 --> 01:19:55,937
The Ruskie talks big, but frankly
we think he's short of know-how.

1046
01:19:56,011 --> 01:20:00,506
You can't expect ignorant peons
to understand a machine like our boys.

1047
01:20:00,584 --> 01:20:03,018
That's not meant as an insult,
Mr. Ambassador.

1048
01:20:03,086 --> 01:20:05,680
We all know how much guts
the average Ruskie's got.

1049
01:20:05,757 --> 01:20:08,885
Look at all of them Nazis killed
off, and they still wouldn't quit!

1050
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:10,860
Can't you stick to the point?

1051
01:20:10,928 --> 01:20:14,660
Well, sir,
if the pilot's good, see...

1052
01:20:14,733 --> 01:20:18,897
I mean, if he's really sharp,
he can barrel that baby in so low.

1053
01:20:18,971 --> 01:20:23,466
You oughta see it! It's a sight!
A big plane like a 52! Vroom!

1054
01:20:23,543 --> 01:20:26,603
Its jet exhaust fryin' chickens
in the barnyard!

1055
01:20:26,679 --> 01:20:29,808
- But has he got a chance?
- Has he got a chance?

1056
01:20:29,884 --> 01:20:31,317
Hell, ye...

1057
01:20:56,815 --> 01:20:58,248

Second safety.

1084
01:22:33,624 --> 01:22:36,287
Check bomb door circuits

1085
01:22:46,873 --> 01:22:50,331

1098
01:23:56,352 --> 01:24:00,288
Stay on the bomb run, Ace. I'm goin'
down below and see what I can do.

1099
01:24:13,238 --> 01:24:14,705
Stay on the bomb run.

1100
01:24:14,773 --> 01:24:18,972
I'm gonna get them doors open
if it harelips everybody on Bear Creek!

1101
01:25:12,538 --> 01:25:15,440
Target orange grid reference checks.

Target in sight!
Where in hell is Major Kong?

1123
01:27:10,139 --> 01:27:11,401
What about Major Kong?

1124
01:27:39,606 --> 01:27:43,303
Mr. President, I would not
rule out the chance...

1125
01:27:43,377 --> 01:27:46,438
to preserve a nucleus
of human specimens.

1126
01:27:46,514 --> 01:27:49,415
It would be quite easy...

1127
01:27:51,820 --> 01:27:56,917
at the bottom of some
of our deeper mine shafts.

1128
01:27:56,992 --> 01:28:01,828
The radioactivity would never penetrate
a mine some thousands of feet deep.

1129
01:28:01,898 --> 01:28:06,165
And in a matter of weeks, sufficient
improvements in dwelling space...

1130
01:28:06,237 --> 01:28:08,171
could easily be provided.

1131
01:28:08,239 --> 01:28:11,003
How long would you have
to stay down there?

1132
01:28:11,075 --> 01:28:14,944
Well, that's, you know...

1133
01:28:15,013 --> 01:28:17,675
Cobalt thorium G.

1134
01:28:27,928 --> 01:28:31,762
Radioactive half-life of...

1135
01:28:33,834 --> 01:28:38,568
I would think that possibly
one hundred years.

1136
01:28:40,909 --> 01:28:44,903
You mean, people could actually
stay down there for 100 years?

1137
01:28:44,981 --> 01:28:47,211
<i>It would not be difficult,
Mein Fuhrer.</i>

1138
01:28:47,283 --> 01:28:49,514
Nuclear reactors could...

1139
01:28:49,586 --> 01:28:51,952
I'm sorry, Mr. President.

1140
01:28:52,022 --> 01:28:55,822
Nuclear reactors could provide
power almost indefinitely.

1141
01:28:55,892 --> 01:28:58,726
Greenhouses could maintain
plant life.

1142
01:28:58,796 --> 01:29:02,391
Animals could be bred
and slaughtered.

1143
01:29:02,467 --> 01:29:06,905
A quick survey would have to be made of
the available mine sites in the country.

1144
01:29:06,972 --> 01:29:10,773
But I would guess
that a dwelling space...

1145
01:29:10,844 --> 01:29:14,507
for several hundred thousand of
our people could easily be provided.

1146
01:29:14,581 --> 01:29:17,709
Well, I would hate
to have to decide...

1147
01:29:17,785 --> 01:29:20,686
who stays up and who goes down.

1148
01:29:20,755 --> 01:29:24,657
Well, that would not be
necessary, Mr. President.

1149
01:29:24,725 --> 01:29:27,593
It could easily be accomplished
with a computer.

1150
01:29:27,662 --> 01:29:29,960
And the computer could
be set and programmed...

1151
01:29:30,032 --> 01:29:33,093
to accept factors
from youth, health...

1152
01:29:33,169 --> 01:29:36,332
sexual fertility, intelligence...

1153
01:29:36,406 --> 01:29:38,897
and a cross-section
of necessary skills.

1154
01:29:38,975 --> 01:29:41,240
Of course, it would be
absolutely vital...

1155
01:29:41,311 --> 01:29:45,270
that our top government
and military men be included...

1156
01:29:45,349 --> 01:29:50,185
to foster and impart the required
principles of leadership and tradition.

1157
01:29:56,228 --> 01:29:59,163
Naturally, they would breed
prodigiously.

1158
01:29:59,231 --> 01:30:02,030
There would be much time
and little to do.

1159
01:30:03,637 --> 01:30:08,575
But with the proper breeding techniques
and a ratio of, say...

1160
01:30:08,643 --> 01:30:11,407
ten females to each male...

1161
01:30:11,479 --> 01:30:16,110
they could then work their way back
to the present gross national product...

1162
01:30:16,185 --> 01:30:17,948
within 20 years.

1163
01:30:19,154 --> 01:30:21,884
But look, Doctor.
Wouldn't this nucleus of survivors...

1164
01:30:21,957 --> 01:30:27,055
be so grief-stricken
and anguished that they...

1165
01:30:27,130 --> 01:30:30,623
well, envy the dead
and not want to go on living?

1166
01:30:30,701 --> 01:30:33,534
No, sir. Excuse me.

1167
01:30:42,814 --> 01:30:46,751
When they go down into the mine,
everyone would still be alive.

1168
01:30:46,819 --> 01:30:48,912
There would be
no shocking memories...

1169
01:30:48,988 --> 01:30:53,653
and the prevailing emotion will be one
of nostalgia for those left behind...

1170
01:30:53,727 --> 01:30:56,594
combined with a spirt of...

1171
01:30:56,663 --> 01:30:59,098
bold curiosity for
the adventure ahead!

1172
01:31:16,620 --> 01:31:18,554
Doctor...

1173
01:31:20,758 --> 01:31:26,196
you mentioned the ratio
of ten women to each man.

1174
01:31:26,264 --> 01:31:29,393
Now, wouldn't that
necessitate the abandonment...

1175
01:31:29,468 --> 01:31:33,268
of the so-called
monogamous sexual relationship?

1176
01:31:33,338 --> 01:31:36,968
I mean, as far as men were concerned?

1177
01:31:37,043 --> 01:31:38,408
Regrettably, yes.

1178
01:31:38,478 --> 01:31:43,849
But it is a sacrifice required
for the future of the human race.

1179
01:31:43,918 --> 01:31:48,913
I hasten to add that since each man
will be required to do prodigious...

1180
01:31:50,692 --> 01:31:52,626
service along these lines...

1181
01:31:52,694 --> 01:31:56,495
the women will have to be selected
for their sexual characteristics...

1182
01:31:56,566 --> 01:32:00,332
which will have to be of
a highly stimulating nature.

1183
01:32:00,403 --> 01:32:04,238
I must confess, you have an
astonishingly good idea there, Doctor.

1184
01:32:05,409 --> 01:32:06,842
Thank you, sir.

1185
01:32:06,910 --> 01:32:09,880
We ought to look at this
from the military point of view.

1186
01:32:09,948 --> 01:32:13,884
I mean,
supposing the Ruskies...

1187
01:32:13,952 --> 01:32:16,887
stashed away some big bombs,
see, and we didn't?

1188
01:32:16,955 --> 01:32:19,857
When they come out in 100 years,
they could take over!

1189
01:32:19,925 --> 01:32:21,688
I agree, Mr. President.

1190
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:25,356
They might try a sneak attack so they
could take over our mine shaft space.

1191
01:32:25,432 --> 01:32:30,062
It'd be extremely naive of us to
imagine that these new developments...

1192
01:32:30,136 --> 01:32:33,072
are gonna cause any change
in Soviet expansionist policy!

1193
01:32:33,140 --> 01:32:35,973
I mean, we must be
increasingly on the alert...

1194
01:32:36,043 --> 01:32:38,569
to prevent them from taking over
other mine shaft space...

1195
01:32:38,647 --> 01:32:40,581
in order to breed more
prodigiously than we do...

1196
01:32:40,649 --> 01:32:43,777
thus knocking us out through
superior numbers when we emerge!

1197
01:32:43,852 --> 01:32:47,949
Mr. President, we must not allow
a mine-shaft gap!

1198
01:32:48,024 --> 01:32:50,117
Sir!

1199
01:32:50,193 --> 01:32:52,457
I have a plan...

1200
01:32:53,998 --> 01:32:56,330
<i>Mein Fuhrer...</i>

1201
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:58,994
I can walk!
