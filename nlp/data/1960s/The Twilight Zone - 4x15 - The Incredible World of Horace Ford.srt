1
00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:10,727
You unlock this door
with the key of imagination.

2
00:00:10,762 --> 00:00:13,229
Beyond it is another dimension-

3
00:00:13,264 --> 00:00:15,732
a dimension of sound,

4
00:00:15,767 --> 00:00:16,983
a dimension of sight,

5
00:00:17,018 --> 00:00:19,486
a dimension of mind.

6
00:00:19,521 --> 00:00:22,622
You're moving into a land
of both shadow and substance,

7
00:00:22,657 --> 00:00:23,873
of things and ideas.

8
00:00:23,908 --> 00:00:28,878
You've just crossed over
into the twilight zone.

9
00:00:39,255 --> 00:00:41,758
Listen, horace...

10
00:00:43,678 --> 00:00:44,894
now, why did
you do that?

11
00:00:44,929 --> 00:00:46,146
Do what?

12
00:00:46,181 --> 00:00:47,397
You know, with
the cap pistol.

13
00:00:47,432 --> 00:00:48,648
Scared the pants
off of you, right?

14
00:00:48,683 --> 00:00:50,517
Look, horace...

15
00:00:50,552 --> 00:00:52,402
you do it almost
every day.

16
00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:54,904
Boy, i love
cap pistols.

17
00:00:54,939 --> 00:00:56,773
They got a great smell.
Smell that.

18
00:00:56,808 --> 00:00:58,658
I know what it
smells like.

19
00:00:58,693 --> 00:01:00,527
When i was a kid,
i always had a cap pistol.

20
00:01:00,562 --> 00:01:01,778
Listen, leonard,

21
00:01:01,813 --> 00:01:03,663
do you remember ken maynard
in the movies?

22
00:01:03,698 --> 00:01:04,914
All the other kids
on the block

23
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:06,166
were tom mix,
except me.

24
00:01:06,201 --> 00:01:07,417
I was ken maynard.

25
00:01:07,452 --> 00:01:09,285
Me and my horse tarzan.

26
00:01:11,206 --> 00:01:13,673
Look, horace,
i came in here

27
00:01:13,708 --> 00:01:14,924
to talk to you
about your design

28
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:16,793
for the new
robot toy.

29
00:01:16,828 --> 00:01:19,295
Now, there's
something out
of whack.

30
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:23,049
Listen, we used to gallop
out of the theater

31
00:01:23,084 --> 00:01:25,552
and shoot up
the whole neighborhood.

32
00:01:27,472 --> 00:01:28,688
Got you,
right in the heart.

33
00:01:28,723 --> 00:01:29,939
Are you cuckoo?

34
00:01:29,974 --> 00:01:31,191
You're cuckoo.

35
00:01:31,226 --> 00:01:32,442
You missed me a mile.

36
00:01:32,477 --> 00:01:34,310
Bing! Bing! Bing!

37
00:01:34,345 --> 00:01:36,196
Horace, have you got
any idea

38
00:01:36,231 --> 00:01:37,447
how loud you're yelling?

39
00:01:37,482 --> 00:01:38,698
I'll bet you can hear that

40
00:01:38,733 --> 00:01:40,567
al the way down
in mr. Judson's office.
How much? How much?

41
00:01:40,602 --> 00:01:41,317
I'll bet you my ball
of silver paper.

42
00:01:41,352 --> 00:01:42,569
You remember
that, leonard?

43
00:01:42,604 --> 00:01:43,820
Remember when we used
to collect tin foil

44
00:01:43,855 --> 00:01:45,705
from those cigarette
packs and roll 'em
in a great big ball?

45
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:46,456
Horace, i came in here

46
00:01:46,491 --> 00:01:48,324
to talk to you
about the new robot toy.

47
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:51,461
Now, i've worked in the office
next to you for 15 years.

48
00:01:51,496 --> 00:01:53,329
I know all about how you used
to collect tin foil.

49
00:01:53,364 --> 00:01:54,581
Now, will you listen
to me for a second?

50
00:01:54,616 --> 00:01:57,083
You must have had a
very miserable time

51
00:01:57,118 --> 00:01:57,717
when you were a kid.

52
00:01:57,752 --> 00:01:59,586
Right. I couldn't wait
till i grew up.

53
00:01:59,621 --> 00:02:00,837
All right, what
do you want?

54
00:02:00,872 --> 00:02:02,722
There's something wrong
with this.

55
00:02:02,757 --> 00:02:03,973
There is not!

56
00:02:04,008 --> 00:02:05,225
I designed that toy!

57
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:06,476
There's nothing
wrong with that toy.

58
00:02:06,511 --> 00:02:07,727
Kids'll be crazy
about that.

59
00:02:08,344 --> 00:02:08,978
Listen, you know
what that does?

60
00:02:09,013 --> 00:02:10,847
I know what it does.
I mean, i mean,

61
00:02:10,882 --> 00:02:12,732
a toy where the
eyes light up

62
00:02:12,767 --> 00:02:13,983
and it talks and
everything...
horace, i'm trying

63
00:02:14,018 --> 00:02:15,852
to help you.
It's a good toy.

64
00:02:15,887 --> 00:02:17,103
I know it's a good toy,

65
00:02:17,138 --> 00:02:18,354
but it can't
be turned out

66
00:02:18,389 --> 00:02:20,857
at the price
mr. Judson wants.

67
00:02:20,892 --> 00:02:22,108
Now, look here...

68
00:02:22,143 --> 00:02:23,359
he's going to blow
his stack

69
00:02:23,394 --> 00:02:25,245
when he sees this.

70
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,113
It's got too many parts,
believe me.

71
00:02:27,148 --> 00:02:29,616
You think
it's wrong?

72
00:02:29,651 --> 00:02:31,501
Well, i know it is.

73
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:43,630
Look, all you have to
do is work it over.

74
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:45,515
How's betty?

75
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:46,766
What?

76
00:02:46,801 --> 00:02:48,017
Betty.

77
00:02:48,052 --> 00:02:50,520
Well, now, what
has betty got
to do with...?

78
00:02:50,555 --> 00:02:54,274
Thanks a lot.
I'll look it over.

79
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:22,302
Mr. Horace ford,

80
00:03:22,337 --> 00:03:24,804
who has a preoccupation
with another time-

81
00:03:24,839 --> 00:03:27,307
a time of childhood,
a time of growing up,

82
00:03:27,342 --> 00:03:29,809
a time of street games,
stickball and hide and go seek.

83
00:03:29,844 --> 00:03:32,312
He has a reluctance
to check out a mirror

84
00:03:32,347 --> 00:03:34,180
and see the nature
of his image-

85
00:03:34,215 --> 00:03:35,682
proof positive
that the time he dwells in

86
00:03:35,717 --> 00:03:36,933
has already passed him by.

87
00:03:37,567 --> 00:03:39,435
But in a moment or two,
he'll discover

88
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,687
that mechanical toys
and memories

89
00:03:40,722 --> 00:03:42,572
and daydreaming
and wishful thinking

90
00:03:42,607 --> 00:03:44,824
and all manner
of odd and special events

91
00:03:44,859 --> 00:03:47,327
can lead one
into a special province,

92
00:03:47,362 --> 00:03:48,578
uncharted and unmapped-

93
00:03:48,613 --> 00:03:51,080
a country of both shadow
and substance

94
00:03:51,115 --> 00:03:53,583
known as the twilight zone.

95
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,310
Laura... what's the matter?

96
00:04:20,345 --> 00:04:22,195
I don't want horace
to see this.

97
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23,446
It's his birthday
present.

98
00:04:23,481 --> 00:04:25,315
Well, how are you?

99
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,566
Exhausted.

100
00:04:26,601 --> 00:04:29,068
It's not easy
shopping for
your husband.

101
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:31,571
What did you get him?

102
00:04:31,606 --> 00:04:33,072
Oh, a smoking jacket.

103
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:34,958
That proves
he's going to be 38.

104
00:04:34,993 --> 00:04:37,460
The surprise party's all set
for friday night?

105
00:04:37,495 --> 00:04:38,711
All set.

106
00:04:38,746 --> 00:04:39,963
Wh-what's the plan?

107
00:04:39,998 --> 00:04:43,082
Everybody's going to meet
at your place at 7:30,

108
00:04:43,117 --> 00:04:46,219
and then you're all coming over
to our place together at 8:00.

109
00:04:46,254 --> 00:04:48,721
Horace thinks the two of us
are going to a movie.

110
00:04:48,756 --> 00:04:51,224
I'll make him answer the door
when you ring.

111
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:53,092
He'll go through the floor.

112
00:04:53,127 --> 00:04:57,347
Oh, len, would
you take this
home with you?

113
00:04:57,382 --> 00:04:58,598
I don't want...
i don't want

114
00:04:58,633 --> 00:04:59,849
horace to see it
around the house.

115
00:04:59,884 --> 00:05:01,734
Sure. I'll bring it
with me friday night.

116
00:05:01,769 --> 00:05:02,986
Thanks. Is he busy?

117
00:05:03,021 --> 00:05:04,854
Well, pretty.

118
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:06,105
I'm going to
take him home.

119
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,991
It's almost
6:00, anyway.

120
00:05:08,026 --> 00:05:09,242
See you friday.

121
00:05:09,277 --> 00:05:11,744
So long, honey.

122
00:05:12,996 --> 00:05:15,498
Horace, horace!

123
00:05:15,533 --> 00:05:17,867
Oh, mr. Judson.

124
00:05:17,902 --> 00:05:19,752
What are you doing
at the window?

125
00:05:19,787 --> 00:05:22,255
Nothing, just thinking.

126
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:23,756
Thinking about what?

127
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:26,626
I don't know... business.

128
00:05:26,876 --> 00:05:27,510
Whose business?

129
00:05:27,545 --> 00:05:28,761
You certainly haven't
been doing

130
00:05:28,796 --> 00:05:30,013
very much thinking
about ours.

131
00:05:30,048 --> 00:05:31,881
Take a look at this.

132
00:05:37,887 --> 00:05:39,772
Well, look at it.

133
00:05:39,807 --> 00:05:41,641
I know what it is.

134
00:05:41,676 --> 00:05:43,526
Well, what happened?

135
00:05:43,561 --> 00:05:45,395
I don't know, mr. Judson.

136
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,646
Do you know how much
we could lose

137
00:05:46,681 --> 00:05:49,148
if we put this toy
into production the way it is?

138
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:49,899
That's a good toy.

139
00:05:49,934 --> 00:05:52,402
Very good, but that has
nothing to do with it.

140
00:05:52,437 --> 00:05:54,904
Look, horace, you've
been here a long while.

141
00:05:54,939 --> 00:05:56,155
It's time you realized
that we're in business

142
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:56,789
to make a profit.

143
00:05:56,824 --> 00:05:58,658
Now, this robot toy
is too complicated,

144
00:05:58,693 --> 00:06:00,543
too many parts,
and i want it simplified.

145
00:06:00,578 --> 00:06:01,794
What do you want
to simplify?

146
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:03,413
Well, the eyes don't have
to light up.

147
00:06:03,448 --> 00:06:06,549
Sure, the eyes have to light up!

148
00:06:06,584 --> 00:06:07,800
What, do you want to ruin
the whole thing?!

149
00:06:07,835 --> 00:06:10,303
The eyes lighting up-
that's the beauty part!

150
00:06:10,338 --> 00:06:12,171
That's the
terrific thing.

151
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:12,805
What's the matter, horace?

152
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,674
Nothing! Well, you're
just talking

153
00:06:14,709 --> 00:06:15,925
about ruining
the whole thing!

154
00:06:16,559 --> 00:06:17,176
I don't want to argue
about it.

155
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:18,311
I just want
the whole design redone,

156
00:06:18,346 --> 00:06:19,562
and i need it
right away.

157
00:06:19,597 --> 00:06:21,431
Listen, don't
you remember

158
00:06:21,466 --> 00:06:22,682
when you used
to play soldiers?

159
00:06:22,717 --> 00:06:26,436
Well, this robot thing...

160
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:35,828
laura...

161
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:40,199
is this the office of
horace maxwell ford?

162
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:43,336
Oh, hello, laura.

163
00:06:43,371 --> 00:06:45,204
Well, aren't you
surprised to see me?

164
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:47,090
Yeah, i'm surprised.
What time is it?

165
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:47,707
About 6:00.

166
00:06:47,742 --> 00:06:48,958
Horace, i've never
been so exhausted

167
00:06:49,592 --> 00:06:50,209
in my whole life.

168
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:51,461
I've been shopping
all day long.

169
00:06:51,496 --> 00:06:54,597
I'm going to take you home.
Okay.

170
00:06:54,632 --> 00:06:56,466
I'm going to fall
into bed tonight,

171
00:06:56,501 --> 00:06:59,602
literally
fall into bed.

172
00:06:59,637 --> 00:07:01,471
Boy, i got
some homework to do.

173
00:07:01,506 --> 00:07:02,722
Oh, not again.

174
00:07:02,757 --> 00:07:03,973
What is it?

175
00:07:04,008 --> 00:07:05,224
That robot toy.

176
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:06,476
I'm telling you,
that nutty mr. Judson

177
00:07:06,511 --> 00:07:08,361
is trying to ruin
the whole thing.

178
00:07:08,396 --> 00:07:11,481
That toy has no meaning
unless the eyes light up.

179
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:20,239
Hello, children.

180
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:22,125
How's my boy?

181
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,376
Fine.

182
00:07:23,411 --> 00:07:23,993
You hungry?

183
00:07:24,028 --> 00:07:25,244
A little.

184
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:27,130
Good, dinner's
almost ready.

185
00:07:27,165 --> 00:07:28,381
Oh, laura, there's
something's wrong

186
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:29,632
with the chicken.

187
00:07:29,667 --> 00:07:31,501
It's like leather.

188
00:07:31,536 --> 00:07:33,386
These birds they
sell you nowadays-

189
00:07:33,421 --> 00:07:35,254
like people don't
know what chickens
are anymore.

190
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:37,140
It looks all
right to me.

191
00:07:37,175 --> 00:07:39,008
Well, how was
the office today?

192
00:07:39,043 --> 00:07:40,259
It was okay.

193
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:42,145
What's the matter?

194
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,397
Nothing. Nothing's the matter.

195
00:07:44,432 --> 00:07:47,266
No, i can tell
just from your voice.

196
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:48,267
What is it?

197
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:50,770
Nothing. Everything's fine.
Let's have dinner.

198
00:07:50,805 --> 00:07:52,655
Boy, i'm telling you,

199
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:54,524
that mr. Judson
is just plain nuts.

200
00:07:54,559 --> 00:07:57,026
The guy reminds me of corey.

201
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:02,031
Hey, mom,
you remember mr. Corey?

202
00:08:02,066 --> 00:08:05,535
Mr. Corey, mom-
i had him in 5-b.

203
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:06,786
Hey, hey, laura,

204
00:08:06,821 --> 00:08:08,037
listen, did i ever
tell you

205
00:08:08,072 --> 00:08:09,288
what we used
to call him?

206
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:10,540
Hey, guess.

207
00:08:10,575 --> 00:08:11,791
Come on, let's get
ready for dinner.

208
00:08:11,826 --> 00:08:13,042
I'm not even going
to tell you.

209
00:08:13,077 --> 00:08:14,927
I'll never forget
the time

210
00:08:14,962 --> 00:08:16,796
he caught me
with a candy ball in my mouth,

211
00:08:16,831 --> 00:08:18,047
see, the kind
that-that change colors

212
00:08:18,082 --> 00:08:19,298
while you suck on them.

213
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,184
Horace...
boy, he made me stand up,

214
00:08:21,219 --> 00:08:22,435
and every minute,
he'd point that pointer at me

215
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:24,937
and he'd say,
"mr. Ford, what
color is it?

216
00:08:24,972 --> 00:08:26,189
What color is
it, mr. Ford?"

217
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:28,691
I got to take it
out of my mouth
and tell him.

218
00:08:28,726 --> 00:08:31,194
Oh, i thought hermy brandt'd
bust trying not to laugh.

219
00:08:31,229 --> 00:08:32,445
Horace...

220
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,697
hermy brandt...

221
00:08:34,732 --> 00:08:39,702
boy, the greatest stickball
player in the whole world.

222
00:08:39,737 --> 00:08:40,953
I'll never forget
this time...

223
00:08:40,988 --> 00:08:41,571
horace...

224
00:08:41,606 --> 00:08:43,322
this fire drill, see?
One time...

225
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:44,574
do you know what he used
to do in fire drill?

226
00:08:44,609 --> 00:08:46,459
Let's have dinner.
He'd... oh!

227
00:08:46,494 --> 00:08:48,961
Gee... what great times.

228
00:08:49,579 --> 00:08:50,830
I was ten.

229
00:08:50,865 --> 00:08:54,584
Boy, what great,
great times.

230
00:08:54,619 --> 00:08:57,086
Horace, why
don't you stop?

231
00:08:57,121 --> 00:08:59,589
Nobody cares about when
you were ten anymore.

232
00:08:59,624 --> 00:09:00,840
I care.

233
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,091
You're almost 38.

234
00:09:02,126 --> 00:09:03,342
So what?

235
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:04,594
You don't act
38 sometimes.

236
00:09:04,629 --> 00:09:05,845
So what?

237
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,730
That's what i
mean- "so what."

238
00:09:07,765 --> 00:09:09,599
What kind of an
answer is "so what"?

239
00:09:09,634 --> 00:09:11,484
I'm telling you it's dry.
Why do you have
to keep talking

240
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,735
about when you
were a kid?

241
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:13,986
It's still dry.

242
00:09:14,103 --> 00:09:17,240
Why don't you just be quiet
for once, will you?!

243
00:09:17,275 --> 00:09:18,491
Horace!

244
00:09:24,113 --> 00:09:27,250
Horace?
Let him go.

245
00:09:34,757 --> 00:09:36,008
Horace.

246
00:09:36,043 --> 00:09:39,629
Laura was probably
just tired.

247
00:09:39,664 --> 00:09:41,514
She didn't
mean to yell.

248
00:09:41,549 --> 00:09:43,382
Hey...

249
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:46,519
hey, you remember hermy brandt?

250
00:09:46,554 --> 00:09:47,887
No.

251
00:09:47,922 --> 00:09:49,772
Listen, how come
you never remember anything

252
00:09:49,807 --> 00:09:51,023
about randolph street?

253
00:09:51,058 --> 00:09:52,892
It was a terrible street.

254
00:09:52,927 --> 00:09:54,143
I just want to forget it.

255
00:09:54,178 --> 00:09:55,895
What was terrible?

256
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:59,649
I had the greatest times.

257
00:09:59,684 --> 00:10:01,534
Like, like, you remember

258
00:10:01,569 --> 00:10:03,402
when pop used to give me
the indian burn?

259
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:07,907
Why do you always have to talk
about when you were a kid?

260
00:10:07,942 --> 00:10:11,410
Ah... randolph street.

261
00:10:12,662 --> 00:10:15,798
You know what i think
i'm going to do?

262
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:18,918
I think i'm going back there
right now.

263
00:10:18,953 --> 00:10:19,919
Horace?

264
00:10:21,804 --> 00:10:24,307
Why shouldn't i?

265
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:28,060
Horace...

266
00:10:28,095 --> 00:10:30,563
it's just a dirty
old street.

267
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,431
What are you going to see?

268
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:34,934
Stay home.

269
00:10:34,969 --> 00:10:37,436
Where are
you going?

270
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:38,070
Horace?

271
00:10:38,688 --> 00:10:41,190
Horace, listen...

272
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,111
frank on a roll?

273
00:11:19,146 --> 00:11:21,364
Three cents each.

274
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:32,625
Bread and butter.
Bread and butter.

275
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:35,745
Davy!

276
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:39,498
You come home
or you're going to get smacked!

277
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,752
Ice cream!

278
00:11:42,787 --> 00:11:44,003
Get your chocolate,
vanilla,

279
00:11:44,038 --> 00:11:45,888
strawberry ice cream!

280
00:11:45,923 --> 00:11:48,391
Get your ice cream here!

281
00:11:48,426 --> 00:11:51,260
Watch where
you're going.

282
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:05,524
Give me that back!

283
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,914
Ring-a-levio,
caught, caught, caught.

284
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:15,668
Ring-a-levio.

285
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:34,186
Hey, hermy.

286
00:12:34,221 --> 00:12:35,938
Hermy brandt,
come on.

287
00:12:58,828 --> 00:13:01,330
Well, it's nice of you
to come back.

288
00:13:01,365 --> 00:13:03,466
Laura?
Where were you?

289
00:13:03,501 --> 00:13:06,585
Why didn't you tell me
where you were going?

290
00:13:07,837 --> 00:13:09,088
Listen, laura...

291
00:13:10,973 --> 00:13:14,727
i was down on randolph street.

292
00:13:14,762 --> 00:13:15,978
What's the matter?

293
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:18,481
I don't know.

294
00:13:23,486 --> 00:13:25,354
I don't know.

295
00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:28,491
Laura...

296
00:13:28,526 --> 00:13:29,742
there's something
i got to tell you.

297
00:13:29,777 --> 00:13:32,244
Take off your hat.

298
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:34,113
I know.

299
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:38,501
Listen...

300
00:13:38,536 --> 00:13:42,872
hey, uh... i saw some kids
on the block...

301
00:13:42,907 --> 00:13:47,259
little kids- maybe...
maybe ten, 11 years old.

302
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:51,630
Laura...

303
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:54,767
they were the kids
i played with when i was ten.

304
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:58,521
The same kids.

305
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,642
You're perspiring.

306
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:04,894
L-i'm not.

307
00:14:04,929 --> 00:14:06,145
You're not
listening to me.

308
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,396
I heard you.

309
00:14:07,431 --> 00:14:11,150
I think you're catching cold
or something.

310
00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:13,652
Wipe off your face.

311
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,160
Wipe off your face.

312
00:14:25,548 --> 00:14:28,667
They couldn't have been
the same kids, dear.

313
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:31,804
That's nonsense.

314
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,306
Well, they were.

315
00:14:34,341 --> 00:14:36,175
I saw them.

316
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:39,929
L-i saw...
hermy brandt

317
00:14:39,964 --> 00:14:42,431
and george lambert
and cy wright.

318
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:43,682
Well, maybe
they justlooked

319
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:44,934
like some kids
you used to know...

320
00:14:44,969 --> 00:14:46,185
no, i'm telling
you, they were.

321
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:49,321
Horace, you're talking
like a child.

322
00:15:12,461 --> 00:15:14,964
He dropped this.

323
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:42,458
You can't turn these things out
like donuts!

324
00:15:42,493 --> 00:15:46,829
Well, you tell him
i am rushing it!

325
00:15:46,864 --> 00:15:49,331
What does he think i am?!

326
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:51,834
Aw, let him do it!

327
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:54,970
Sure, sure, you tell him that!

328
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:58,724
What does he want
out of me?!

329
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:01,226
Judson?
Yeah.

330
00:16:01,261 --> 00:16:03,729
Well, he wants to get
that toy in production

331
00:16:03,764 --> 00:16:04,346
in time for christmas.

332
00:16:04,381 --> 00:16:06,231
Well, what's
he nagging me for?!

333
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:07,483
He's got six months.

334
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,985
Now, take it
easy, horace.

335
00:16:10,486 --> 00:16:12,354
Look, he's a pretty nice guy,
but he's a businessman.

336
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:13,605
Now, you got to remember that.

337
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,991
Uh, don't you start
on me, too.

338
00:16:16,026 --> 00:16:17,860
What's wrong, horace?

339
00:16:18,994 --> 00:16:20,863
I don't know. I...

340
00:16:20,898 --> 00:16:23,365
listen, i... i'm very nervous.

341
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,868
I saw a kid last night.

342
00:16:25,903 --> 00:16:27,119
You ever been
on-on randolph street?

343
00:16:27,154 --> 00:16:29,371
Well, it doesn't make
any difference.

344
00:16:29,406 --> 00:16:32,007
Randolph is-is my old street
when-when i was a kid.

345
00:16:32,042 --> 00:16:33,258
He was wearing knickers,

346
00:16:33,293 --> 00:16:34,760
this kid i saw.

347
00:16:34,795 --> 00:16:36,512
You remember when you used
to wear knickers,

348
00:16:36,547 --> 00:16:37,763
where the...
where the buckles and all-

349
00:16:37,798 --> 00:16:39,014
they're all the time
slipping down?

350
00:16:39,049 --> 00:16:40,883
So he was wearing these...

351
00:16:40,918 --> 00:16:43,385
kids never wear knickers
anymore!

352
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,270
I'm telling you, never!

353
00:16:45,305 --> 00:16:49,024
But he is...
wearing these knickers and...

354
00:16:49,059 --> 00:16:51,527
you won't believe this...

355
00:16:51,562 --> 00:16:53,395
but i swear it's true.

356
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:55,898
I was...

357
00:16:55,933 --> 00:16:59,034
walking on the street...

358
00:16:59,069 --> 00:17:02,154
and all of a sudden, i hear
a kid yelling, "ring-a-levio!"

359
00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:03,038
Ring-a...?

360
00:17:03,073 --> 00:17:04,907
Well, that's a game
we used to play.

361
00:17:04,942 --> 00:17:07,159
Ring-a-levio.

362
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:11,547
You... you know how that can
make you feel, hearing that?

363
00:17:11,582 --> 00:17:13,415
I was a very good
ring-a-levio player.

364
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:14,666
See, you got
to be very fast.

365
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:15,918
You need a lot
of stamina.

366
00:17:15,953 --> 00:17:17,169
Boy, the running
you have to do.

367
00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:19,054
See, first,
you choose up sides.

368
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:20,923
You go, "one potato,
two potato, three potato, four."

369
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:23,425
You remember that?
You remember that?

370
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,676
And then one side's
got to hide.

371
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:26,562
So, this time, i'm hiding
behind the grocery,

372
00:17:26,597 --> 00:17:29,064
back behind where
they keep the cartons and all...

373
00:17:29,099 --> 00:17:31,567
well, now, horace...
and i fell asleep.

374
00:17:31,602 --> 00:17:34,069
Is that ridiculous?
I fell asleep.

375
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:37,823
When i woke up, i take one look
at my mickey mouse wa...

376
00:17:37,858 --> 00:17:40,692
mickey mouse watch.

377
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:42,578
Oh...

378
00:17:42,613 --> 00:17:45,080
gee, i haven't thought
of that in 20 years.

379
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:47,583
Hey, you remember when you had
a mickey mouse watch?

380
00:17:47,618 --> 00:17:48,834
What a deal that was...

381
00:17:48,869 --> 00:17:50,702
horace, uh...
i got some work

382
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:52,087
stacked up
on my desk.

383
00:17:52,122 --> 00:17:53,956
L-i just stopped
in to say hello.

384
00:17:53,991 --> 00:17:55,841
I wanted to tell you
about how silly...

385
00:17:55,876 --> 00:17:57,709
i'll see you
later, huh?

386
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:19,481
Horace...

387
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:20,115
i want to ask
you something.

388
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:21,366
What was the
point in shouting

389
00:18:21,401 --> 00:18:22,618
at my secretary
on the phone?

390
00:18:22,653 --> 00:18:24,486
She was shouting at me!

391
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:25,737
I was in the same
room with her.

392
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:27,623
She spoke in a
normal voice.

393
00:18:27,658 --> 00:18:29,374
Aren't you happy
with your work here?

394
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:31,877
Sure.

395
00:18:31,912 --> 00:18:33,996
Horace, you're a fine designer.

396
00:18:34,031 --> 00:18:35,881
You have value for this company.

397
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:37,132
For our sake as well as yours,

398
00:18:37,167 --> 00:18:38,383
i don't like
to see it dissipated.

399
00:18:38,418 --> 00:18:41,136
But you've been
behaving badly.

400
00:18:41,171 --> 00:18:43,255
Is there something wrong,
maybe at home?

401
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:47,392
L-i'm just trying
to get this thing done here!

402
00:18:47,427 --> 00:18:50,646
I'm not speaking just to hear
the sound of my own voice.

403
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,692
Horace!

404
00:19:36,727 --> 00:19:37,943
I'm sorry i'm late.

405
00:19:37,978 --> 00:19:40,445
The subway was tied up
for about 20 minutes.

406
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,314
Somebody jumped?
Nobody jumped.

407
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:43,565
Why do you have to think

408
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,816
of something like that
right off?

409
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:46,702
Well, it happens.
Just read the papers.

410
00:19:46,737 --> 00:19:48,570
Something broke down.

411
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:51,707
You can't kiss your
poor old mother
hello anymore?

412
00:19:51,742 --> 00:19:53,575
Yeah, sure.

413
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:56,078
Don't bother to wash up.

414
00:19:56,712 --> 00:19:58,580
It's overcooked already.

415
00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:00,465
You tired?

416
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,717
Yeah.

417
00:20:01,752 --> 00:20:03,585
Listen, horace...

418
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:06,722
there's a great double bill
at the regent.

419
00:20:06,757 --> 00:20:08,590
I'm going back
there tonight.

420
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:09,841
Where?

421
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:12,344
Randolph street.

422
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:13,595
What for?

423
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:15,480
I got to see
those kids.

424
00:20:15,515 --> 00:20:16,982
Why?

425
00:20:17,017 --> 00:20:17,599
Because i want
to see them.

426
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:18,850
It's important.

427
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:20,736
Important?

428
00:20:20,771 --> 00:20:21,987
Veal cutlet.

429
00:20:22,604 --> 00:20:23,238
Succotash.

430
00:20:23,273 --> 00:20:24,489
It's canned,

431
00:20:24,524 --> 00:20:25,741
but you can hardly tell it
from fresh.

432
00:20:25,776 --> 00:20:27,609
Now, help yourself
to the meat, horace.

433
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:30,746
If it's stringy,
blame it on the subway.

434
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:35,000
You sure nobody jumped?

435
00:20:35,035 --> 00:20:36,868
Mother.

436
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:39,371
What's so great about disasters?

437
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:40,505
What?

438
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:43,625
You know, i remember you
from randolph street.

439
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,510
Every time there was an accident
or something,

440
00:20:45,545 --> 00:20:47,379
you was always right there
in the front row, watching.

441
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:49,881
Horace.

442
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,266
Well, it's the truth.

443
00:20:51,301 --> 00:20:51,883
Now, what-what about that time

444
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:54,386
that harvey bender got his arm
caught in the fire hydrant?

445
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:56,888
We all think they're going to
have to bust it to get it loose.

446
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:58,774
You never budged
out of the front row.

447
00:20:58,809 --> 00:21:01,526
Harvey bender?
Who's harvey bender?

448
00:21:01,561 --> 00:21:03,528
What are
you talking about?

449
00:21:03,563 --> 00:21:05,397
If that wasn't
the nuttiest thing...

450
00:21:05,432 --> 00:21:07,899
what's he talking about?

451
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:09,284
The hottest day
of the summer,

452
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:11,787
and he thinks to clog up
the fire hydrant.

453
00:21:11,822 --> 00:21:13,905
What do you mean, you don't
remember harvey bender?

454
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,041
Gee, we were
all playing emmy, see,

455
00:21:16,076 --> 00:21:17,909
you know, you know,
on a manhole cover,

456
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:19,795
and man, i'm cleaning up.

457
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:22,297
Oh, gosh, i remember it
just as if it was this morning.

458
00:21:22,332 --> 00:21:26,668
See, i got this big fat purey,
and i'm...

459
00:21:26,703 --> 00:21:28,053
i'm cleaning up, and all
of a sudden, this nut says,

460
00:21:28,088 --> 00:21:29,921
"let's open up
the fire hydrant."

461
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:32,424
Ah, that was the nuttiest kid,
i swear.

462
00:21:32,459 --> 00:21:34,059
His favorite thing was

463
00:21:34,094 --> 00:21:35,310
shake, spear,
sock in the ear.

464
00:21:35,345 --> 00:21:37,179
Horace, stop it!

465
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:52,194
What's the matter?

466
00:21:52,229 --> 00:21:53,445
Just stop it.

467
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:57,332
He was one of the kids
last night.

468
00:21:57,367 --> 00:21:59,201
Who was one of the kids?

469
00:21:59,236 --> 00:21:59,835
Harvey bender.

470
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:01,703
What are you talking about?

471
00:22:01,738 --> 00:22:03,588
I saw him last night.

472
00:22:03,623 --> 00:22:06,091
Don't you know
that's impossible?

473
00:22:06,126 --> 00:22:07,959
I know what i see.

474
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:11,713
He was ten years old
whenyouwere ten years old.

475
00:22:11,748 --> 00:22:14,216
He's as old as you are.

476
00:22:14,251 --> 00:22:15,467
I tell you, i saw him.

477
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:17,352
He's a grown-up man!

478
00:22:17,387 --> 00:22:20,472
Well, you think so...
you think so, do you?

479
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:23,608
Let me tell you, i saw him
last night on randolph street.

480
00:22:23,643 --> 00:22:26,111
And i saw george lambert,
and i saw cy wright,

481
00:22:26,146 --> 00:22:27,979
and they arestillkids!

482
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:30,365
Horace, what are you saying?

483
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,983
Feel his head.

484
00:22:32,018 --> 00:22:32,734
He's got a fever.

485
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:33,985
Now, leave me alone.
I got no fever.

486
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,488
Mother, be quiet.

487
00:22:36,523 --> 00:22:38,990
Horace, sit down.

488
00:22:40,242 --> 00:22:41,493
Feel his head.

489
00:22:41,528 --> 00:22:43,378
Will you let me alone?

490
00:22:43,413 --> 00:22:45,247
Mother...

491
00:22:45,282 --> 00:22:47,132
listen, darling,

492
00:22:47,167 --> 00:22:50,886
i want to talk to
you quietly just
for a minute.

493
00:22:50,921 --> 00:22:53,755
I don't know what's been
happening at the office,

494
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:56,258
but i see you
when you come home at night,

495
00:22:56,293 --> 00:22:58,760
you're tired.

496
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:00,645
I mean,

497
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,765
overwork can cause...

498
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,650
i want you to see a doctor.

499
00:23:06,902 --> 00:23:08,770
What for?

500
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:10,655
Just to have a checkup.

501
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:13,158
Yeah, you think i'm imagining
this thing about the kids.

502
00:23:13,193 --> 00:23:14,276
No, i don't.

503
00:23:14,311 --> 00:23:15,527
Yes, you do.

504
00:23:15,562 --> 00:23:16,161
Horace, listen.

505
00:23:16,196 --> 00:23:18,530
Where are
you going?

506
00:23:19,781 --> 00:23:21,666
Horace!

507
00:23:21,701 --> 00:23:23,535
Please.

508
00:23:52,314 --> 00:23:53,198
Frank on a roll?

509
00:23:53,233 --> 00:23:55,450
Three cents each.

510
00:24:02,958 --> 00:24:06,077
Bread and butter.
Bread and butter.

511
00:24:07,329 --> 00:24:09,214
Davy!

512
00:24:09,249 --> 00:24:12,334
You come home,
or you're going to get smacked!

513
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,587
Ice cream!

514
00:24:15,622 --> 00:24:16,838
Get your chocolate,
vanilla,

515
00:24:16,873 --> 00:24:18,723
strawberry
ice cream here!

516
00:24:18,758 --> 00:24:19,975
Ice cream!

517
00:24:21,261 --> 00:24:24,095
Watch where
you're going.

518
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:40,362
Give me that back!

519
00:24:42,864 --> 00:24:46,001
Ring-a-levio,
caught, caught, caught.

520
00:24:49,754 --> 00:24:52,257
Ring-a-levio.

521
00:25:10,025 --> 00:25:11,526
Hey, hermy.

522
00:25:11,561 --> 00:25:12,777
Hermy brandt,
come on.

523
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:24,039
Let's swipe some apples.
You each grab one.

524
00:25:24,074 --> 00:25:25,907
Hey, micky, larry.

525
00:25:26,908 --> 00:25:28,159
Hey, wait!

526
00:25:31,162 --> 00:25:32,914
Can you imagine
not being invited

527
00:25:32,949 --> 00:25:34,165
to that birthday party?

528
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:34,799
Can you imagine?

529
00:25:34,834 --> 00:25:37,919
Yeah, and i'm supposed
to be his best friend.

530
00:25:37,954 --> 00:25:38,553
He stinks!

531
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:40,555
We ought to mob-ilize him,
right, hermy?

532
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:43,308
Oh, and how.

533
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:53,184
Horace?

534
00:25:54,436 --> 00:25:56,938
Horace.

535
00:25:56,973 --> 00:26:00,692
Horace, are
you all right?

536
00:26:00,727 --> 00:26:04,446
Why don't you
say something?

537
00:26:04,481 --> 00:26:08,833
Same thing happened
all over again.

538
00:26:08,868 --> 00:26:11,953
Well, sit down
over here.

539
00:26:12,587 --> 00:26:14,456
I was worried
about you.

540
00:26:14,491 --> 00:26:16,958
I'm glad
you're home.

541
00:26:16,993 --> 00:26:21,963
I mean, the way
you ran out of here...

542
00:26:21,998 --> 00:26:24,466
nothing changed.

543
00:26:24,501 --> 00:26:28,853
Same man wanted me
to buy a hot dog.

544
00:26:28,888 --> 00:26:32,607
Those people says
"bread and butter."

545
00:26:32,642 --> 00:26:35,110
This big guy
bumped into me.

546
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:37,612
What are
you talking about?

547
00:26:37,647 --> 00:26:38,863
I'm telling
you, laura,

548
00:26:38,898 --> 00:26:40,732
i'm telling you,
laura, no-nothing
changed.

549
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:42,617
It's some kind
of a pattern,

550
00:26:42,652 --> 00:26:44,486
and i'm in it.

551
00:26:44,521 --> 00:26:46,371
The kids...

552
00:26:46,406 --> 00:26:48,873
they... i mean, they
swipe some apples,

553
00:26:48,908 --> 00:26:52,627
they run into an
alley, and i heard
them talking.

554
00:26:52,662 --> 00:26:55,130
I almost died.

555
00:26:55,165 --> 00:26:56,998
I mean it.

556
00:26:57,632 --> 00:27:02,003
I remember being in
it from 28 years ago,

557
00:27:02,038 --> 00:27:03,888
but i don't
remember how.

558
00:27:03,923 --> 00:27:08,259
Oh, god, horace... stop.

559
00:27:09,511 --> 00:27:11,396
Listen, i'm going
to call a doctor.

560
00:27:11,431 --> 00:27:13,264
You're not.

561
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:13,898
I don't need
a doctor.

562
00:27:13,933 --> 00:27:16,401
I'm not sick.
I saw this.

563
00:27:16,436 --> 00:27:21,406
Please. Now, you have
to listen to me.

564
00:27:21,441 --> 00:27:25,160
You have to have some help
on this thing.

565
00:27:25,195 --> 00:27:27,662
Just let me
alone, will you?

566
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:36,421
Why don't you get into bed
for a couple of days?

567
00:27:36,456 --> 00:27:39,541
I mean, you don'thave
to go to work.

568
00:27:39,576 --> 00:27:42,677
Stay home
from the office.

569
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:14,576
He dropped this.

570
00:28:47,742 --> 00:28:51,496
Twilight zonewill continue
after station identification.

571
00:29:07,378 --> 00:29:08,630
Laura, hey,

572
00:29:08,665 --> 00:29:09,881
aren't you supposed
to be home

573
00:29:09,916 --> 00:29:11,766
baking a birthday
cake or something?

574
00:29:11,801 --> 00:29:13,017
Now, don't tell me

575
00:29:13,052 --> 00:29:14,269
it's going to
be store-bought-

576
00:29:14,304 --> 00:29:16,137
not a woman with
your talents.

577
00:29:16,172 --> 00:29:18,640
I don't want horace
to see me.

578
00:29:18,675 --> 00:29:21,142
I have to tell
you something.

579
00:29:21,177 --> 00:29:22,393
I don't know
how he got

580
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:23,645
to the office
this morning.

581
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,530
I begged him
to stay home.

582
00:29:25,565 --> 00:29:27,398
Leonard, i've
got to get him

583
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:28,650
to see a doctor.

584
00:29:28,685 --> 00:29:29,901
What are
you talking about?

585
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:31,786
Well, something's
happening to him.

586
00:29:31,821 --> 00:29:33,037
It's this thing
with the kids.

587
00:29:33,072 --> 00:29:34,289
He's...

588
00:29:34,324 --> 00:29:36,157
well, it's
like it's...

589
00:29:36,192 --> 00:29:38,660
eating him alive.

590
00:29:38,695 --> 00:29:40,545
Laura...

591
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:43,047
look, he-he's had that
ever since i can remember.

592
00:29:43,082 --> 00:29:45,550
I mean, i've always been able
to snap him out of it.

593
00:29:45,585 --> 00:29:46,801
Not now.

594
00:29:46,836 --> 00:29:49,921
You know he's
been going back
to his old street?

595
00:29:49,956 --> 00:29:52,423
Yeah, he started
to tell me about it.

596
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:55,176
He tells me he sees kids
that he grew up with,

597
00:29:55,211 --> 00:29:57,679
and they're the same age.

598
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:01,432
I don't know what
to say to him.

599
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:03,318
Len, he's got to have help.

600
00:30:03,353 --> 00:30:06,437
I'm not saying i'm the best wife
in the world, but i try.

601
00:30:06,472 --> 00:30:07,071
L-i try hard.

602
00:30:07,106 --> 00:30:10,191
Now, i make a home
for his mother.

603
00:30:10,226 --> 00:30:12,694
That's not easy.

604
00:30:12,729 --> 00:30:14,579
But i love horace.

605
00:30:14,614 --> 00:30:16,447
Sometimes i don't know
what to say to him,

606
00:30:16,482 --> 00:30:18,333
but i love him.

607
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:20,201
Do you want me to talk to him?

608
00:30:20,236 --> 00:30:24,589
Len... make him see a doctor.

609
00:30:24,624 --> 00:30:26,457
I'm afraid.

610
00:30:27,091 --> 00:30:30,845
I'm afraid for his job
and for him.

611
00:30:32,096 --> 00:30:34,599
I'm just afraid.

612
00:30:34,634 --> 00:30:35,850
I will.

613
00:30:35,885 --> 00:30:37,719
L-l-i'll talk to him.

614
00:30:37,754 --> 00:30:42,106
Look, uh... laura,
it's after 4:00 now,

615
00:30:42,141 --> 00:30:44,609
and the surprise party
is tonight.

616
00:30:44,644 --> 00:30:46,477
Now, suppose i hold off
until tomorrow?

617
00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:49,614
L-i just don't want to get him
upset before the party.

618
00:30:49,649 --> 00:30:52,734
Oh... but he's so upset now.

619
00:30:52,769 --> 00:30:55,486
Len...

620
00:30:55,521 --> 00:30:57,989
help me get him to
a doctor tomorrow.

621
00:30:58,024 --> 00:31:00,491
L-i'll talk to him.

622
00:31:00,526 --> 00:31:02,994
I'll see you
at 8:00 sharp.

623
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:17,141
I just finished
the designs

624
00:31:17,176 --> 00:31:18,393
for that
kangaroo toy.

625
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:20,895
Mr. Hop-hop,
they're going to call it.

626
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:22,764
Thought i'd come in
and kill some time.

627
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:25,266
Who thought of that name,
"mr. Hop-hop"?

628
00:31:25,301 --> 00:31:26,517
I did.

629
00:31:26,552 --> 00:31:27,769
No kidding. When?

630
00:31:27,804 --> 00:31:29,020
Last week.

631
00:31:29,055 --> 00:31:30,905
Oh, it's a real good name.
Catchy.

632
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:32,156
Listen, leonard,

633
00:31:32,191 --> 00:31:35,276
did you ever hear
of this thing...

634
00:31:35,311 --> 00:31:37,779
"step on a crack

635
00:31:37,814 --> 00:31:40,281
and break your
mother's back"?

636
00:31:40,316 --> 00:31:42,784
And it's got
another part to it.

637
00:31:42,819 --> 00:31:45,920
I... i've been
trying to remember
it all day,

638
00:31:45,955 --> 00:31:47,171
and i can't
remember it.

639
00:31:47,206 --> 00:31:48,423
I never heard of it.

640
00:31:48,458 --> 00:31:50,925
Look, you were telling me
a story yesterday

641
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,794
about something that happened
on your old block,

642
00:31:52,829 --> 00:31:55,296
and you never did
finish it.

643
00:31:55,331 --> 00:31:56,547
"Step on a crack..."

644
00:31:56,582 --> 00:31:59,684
what happened
the other night?

645
00:31:59,719 --> 00:32:01,552
I don't want
to tell you.

646
00:32:01,587 --> 00:32:03,438
You'd just give
me a blank look

647
00:32:03,473 --> 00:32:05,306
and tell me i'm
crazy or something.

648
00:32:05,341 --> 00:32:06,557
What are
you talking about?

649
00:32:06,592 --> 00:32:08,443
I don't want
to tell you.

650
00:32:12,196 --> 00:32:12,814
Hello, leonard.

651
00:32:12,849 --> 00:32:14,699
I'd like to speak
to horace alone

652
00:32:14,734 --> 00:32:15,950
for a minute,
if you don't mind.

653
00:32:15,985 --> 00:32:17,819
Oh, mr. Judson,
i was just going to ask you

654
00:32:17,854 --> 00:32:20,321
to come in and go over
that hop-hop toy with me.

655
00:32:20,356 --> 00:32:21,572
In a little while.
I'll see you in your office.

656
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:22,824
Well, the designs
are all finished.

657
00:32:22,859 --> 00:32:25,960
In a little while,
leonard.

658
00:32:30,965 --> 00:32:32,834
How are you,
horace?

659
00:32:32,869 --> 00:32:34,085
Okay.

660
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,336
You look tired.

661
00:32:35,371 --> 00:32:36,587
I'm not tired.

662
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:38,473
I thought maybe
you'd have

663
00:32:38,508 --> 00:32:40,341
the robot toy design
finished by now,

664
00:32:40,376 --> 00:32:41,592
and i'd like
to see it.

665
00:32:41,627 --> 00:32:43,478
I don't have them.

666
00:32:43,513 --> 00:32:44,729
Why not?

667
00:32:44,764 --> 00:32:45,980
I don't know why not.

668
00:32:46,015 --> 00:32:47,231
I just haven't
gotten to them.

669
00:32:47,266 --> 00:32:49,100
What have you
been doing?

670
00:32:49,135 --> 00:32:50,351
What have
i been doing?

671
00:32:50,386 --> 00:32:53,488
What-what-what do you think
i've been doing?

672
00:32:53,523 --> 00:32:55,356
Well, horace, you...

673
00:32:55,391 --> 00:32:57,241
you haven't been very
helpful around here

674
00:32:57,276 --> 00:32:58,493
for quite a while.

675
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:02,246
Helpful? I don't know
how you can say that.

676
00:33:02,281 --> 00:33:04,499
That toy has to get
into production.

677
00:33:04,534 --> 00:33:05,750
Maybe you'd
better start on
something else,

678
00:33:05,785 --> 00:33:07,001
and leonard
can finish up.

679
00:33:07,036 --> 00:33:09,120
Listen, that's my design,

680
00:33:09,155 --> 00:33:11,005
and nobody else is touching it.

681
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,875
I still run this firm, horace.

682
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:16,511
You are not taking my stuff!

683
00:33:16,546 --> 00:33:18,379
Lower your voice.

684
00:33:18,414 --> 00:33:20,631
Look, horace,
i'm trying to be decent to you

685
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:21,883
because i think
there's something wrong.

686
00:33:21,918 --> 00:33:23,518
I think maybe
you're ill.

687
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:25,520
I'd like you to take
a leave of absence,

688
00:33:25,555 --> 00:33:27,388
and i want you
to see a psychiatrist.

689
00:33:27,423 --> 00:33:29,891
I think you're approaching
a nervous breakdown.

690
00:33:29,926 --> 00:33:32,393
I am not approaching
any nervous breakdown,

691
00:33:32,428 --> 00:33:33,644
and i don't know
who you think you are,

692
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:34,896
talking to me like that!

693
00:33:34,931 --> 00:33:36,898
I'm only trying to help.

694
00:33:36,933 --> 00:33:38,783
There's nothing wrong with me.

695
00:33:38,818 --> 00:33:41,035
That may be, but if there is,

696
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:42,904
it-it's nothing
to be ashamed of.

697
00:33:42,939 --> 00:33:45,406
I want you to take
a leave of absence and find out.

698
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,543
I am not taking
any leave of absence.

699
00:33:51,662 --> 00:33:53,548
Well, the way things are,

700
00:33:53,583 --> 00:33:55,416
i'm afraid
you can't work here anymore.

701
00:33:55,451 --> 00:33:58,553
All right, all right,
all right, all right!

702
00:33:58,588 --> 00:34:01,672
All right, then,
i can't work here anymore!

703
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:03,558
I'm sorry, horace.

704
00:34:03,593 --> 00:34:05,426
I wish you'd think about it.

705
00:34:05,461 --> 00:34:08,179
Would you please
just get out of here?!

706
00:34:08,214 --> 00:34:10,681
Would you, please?!

707
00:34:31,335 --> 00:34:32,587
Laura.

708
00:34:32,622 --> 00:34:35,706
All right, uh,
one chocolate chip.

709
00:34:35,741 --> 00:34:39,460
543 dayton street,
apartment "d."

710
00:34:39,495 --> 00:34:41,345
"D" as in david.

711
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:43,214
That's right.

712
00:34:43,249 --> 00:34:44,465
10:00 tonight.

713
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,716
Thank you.

714
00:34:45,751 --> 00:34:46,968
Laura, do you think

715
00:34:47,003 --> 00:34:48,853
i bought enough
potato chips?

716
00:34:48,888 --> 00:34:50,721
Oh, mm-hmm.

717
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:51,973
What shall i
do with this

718
00:34:52,008 --> 00:34:53,224
so horace
won't see it?

719
00:34:53,259 --> 00:34:54,475
Well, i don't know.

720
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:57,612
Maybe put it
in your bedroom somewhere.

721
00:34:57,647 --> 00:34:59,480
Where is he?

722
00:34:59,515 --> 00:35:00,731
What time is it?

723
00:35:00,766 --> 00:35:01,983
Ten of 8:00.

724
00:35:02,018 --> 00:35:03,234
I'm getting worried
about him.

725
00:35:03,269 --> 00:35:04,485
He should have been
home an hour ago.

726
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:07,622
He probably got stuck
at the office.

727
00:35:07,657 --> 00:35:08,873
I'm going to
call him there.

728
00:35:08,908 --> 00:35:10,741
It looks good.

729
00:35:10,776 --> 00:35:13,244
The way they bake cakes
these days,

730
00:35:13,279 --> 00:35:16,380
i hope it tastes
as good as it looks.

731
00:35:20,134 --> 00:35:22,003
Well, hello.

732
00:35:22,038 --> 00:35:23,888
How come you're
so late?

733
00:35:23,923 --> 00:35:25,139
I didn't know
what time it is.

734
00:35:25,174 --> 00:35:26,390
Why, it's
ten of 8:00.

735
00:35:26,425 --> 00:35:29,510
Hello, dear.

736
00:35:32,013 --> 00:35:33,898
I'm fired.

737
00:35:33,933 --> 00:35:35,149
You're what?

738
00:35:35,184 --> 00:35:36,651
I'm fired.

739
00:35:36,686 --> 00:35:39,153
What are you
talking about?

740
00:35:39,188 --> 00:35:41,022
Mother.

741
00:35:41,057 --> 00:35:42,907
I went and had a hamburger
at the drugstore.

742
00:35:42,942 --> 00:35:45,409
That's why i'm late.

743
00:35:46,661 --> 00:35:49,163
You're fired from your job?

744
00:35:49,198 --> 00:35:51,415
Will you,
for heaven's sakes?

745
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:53,784
Horace, i want to know.

746
00:35:53,819 --> 00:35:55,670
You're trying to be funny.

747
00:35:55,705 --> 00:35:57,288
No.

748
00:35:57,323 --> 00:35:59,790
Why were you fired?

749
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:02,927
I was inadequate in my work.

750
00:36:02,962 --> 00:36:04,795
Well, that's not so.

751
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:07,298
Iwasinadequate in my work.

752
00:36:07,333 --> 00:36:08,933
Who said that?

753
00:36:10,685 --> 00:36:13,804
It doesn't
matter, horace.

754
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:16,941
What doesn't
matter?

755
00:36:16,976 --> 00:36:19,443
A man loses a job
he's had for 15 years,

756
00:36:19,478 --> 00:36:22,563
and it doesn't matter?

757
00:36:22,598 --> 00:36:24,448
What do they mean, inadequate?

758
00:36:24,483 --> 00:36:26,317
A man like you?

759
00:36:26,352 --> 00:36:28,819
A top designer
of toys?

760
00:36:28,854 --> 00:36:30,705
Do they know what they've got?

761
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:35,076
Pure gold.

762
00:36:35,111 --> 00:36:36,327
Mother.

763
00:36:36,362 --> 00:36:38,212
Listen, maybe they don't know,

764
00:36:38,247 --> 00:36:41,332
but i know what you did
for them in 15 years.

765
00:36:41,367 --> 00:36:42,583
They've got to be told.

766
00:36:43,217 --> 00:36:45,720
Your life's blood
is in that place.

767
00:36:45,755 --> 00:36:47,588
Look...

768
00:36:47,623 --> 00:36:51,342
i want you to get whoever it is
down there at that firm there-

769
00:36:51,377 --> 00:36:54,478
that mr. Johnson
or whatever his name is-

770
00:36:54,513 --> 00:36:56,981
get him on the wire
and tell him what's what.

771
00:36:57,016 --> 00:36:58,849
I'm not calling anybody.

772
00:37:08,242 --> 00:37:10,111
But you're fired.

773
00:37:10,146 --> 00:37:13,864
$140 a week.

774
00:37:13,899 --> 00:37:18,252
Do you think you can find
$140 a week on the street?

775
00:37:18,287 --> 00:37:20,755
What's going
to happen to us?

776
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:23,257
I don't know.

777
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:26,877
Because all of a sudden,

778
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:29,380
my whole life
is going before me.

779
00:37:29,415 --> 00:37:31,882
I don't know why.

780
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:36,887
I can't tell you what it is...

781
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:42,526
but it's been ups and downs,
ups and downs.

782
00:37:42,561 --> 00:37:46,280
I'm 61 years old, 61.

783
00:37:46,315 --> 00:37:49,400
It's time i shouldn't
be afraid anymore.

784
00:37:49,435 --> 00:37:51,152
Why don't
you look at me

785
00:37:51,187 --> 00:37:53,654
when i'm talking
to you?!

786
00:37:53,689 --> 00:37:55,906
What's going to happen to me?!

787
00:37:55,941 --> 00:37:57,792
Shut up!

788
00:37:59,794 --> 00:38:04,415
I am going to talk
to horace alone.

789
00:38:14,058 --> 00:38:15,926
What did i do wrong?

790
00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:21,182
Ever, in my whole life?

791
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:33,077
If somebody could tell me...

792
00:38:43,704 --> 00:38:46,207
i couldn't help it.

793
00:38:46,242 --> 00:38:48,092
It's only a
job, darling.

794
00:38:48,127 --> 00:38:50,594
There are plenty
of other jobs.

795
00:38:50,629 --> 00:38:53,097
You were stagnating
there, horace.

796
00:38:53,132 --> 00:38:54,348
I never had another job.

797
00:38:54,965 --> 00:38:57,468
What are you
going to do?

798
00:39:01,222 --> 00:39:03,724
Why did she have to cry?

799
00:39:03,759 --> 00:39:05,609
She's an old woman, horace.

800
00:39:05,644 --> 00:39:09,363
I mean, it's unfair
for her to cry.

801
00:39:09,398 --> 00:39:13,117
Well, that's always her first
reaction to trouble- crying.

802
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:14,985
She'll be all right.

803
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,871
Did you get any severance pay?

804
00:39:16,906 --> 00:39:18,739
I don't know what i got.

805
00:39:18,774 --> 00:39:20,624
I just walked out.

806
00:39:20,659 --> 00:39:23,127
Well, we'll forget about it
for now.

807
00:39:23,162 --> 00:39:24,995
We'll think about it
this weekend.

808
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,881
Monday, you can start looking.

809
00:39:26,916 --> 00:39:28,749
We'll make a list
of places.

810
00:39:28,784 --> 00:39:30,634
She's scared stiff.

811
00:39:30,669 --> 00:39:32,753
She'll be all right.

812
00:39:32,788 --> 00:39:36,140
I have to support her...

813
00:39:38,642 --> 00:39:41,145
...and you...

814
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:44,899
horace, i have
to tell you something.

815
00:39:44,934 --> 00:39:46,767
And me- that
makes three people.

816
00:39:46,802 --> 00:39:48,018
Well, you think
that's easy?

817
00:39:48,053 --> 00:39:49,904
You know what
mr. Corey says
to me today?

818
00:39:49,939 --> 00:39:51,155
He says he thinks
that he's...

819
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:54,275
mr. Corey was
your teacher in 5-b.

820
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:56,160
Well, mr. Judson.

821
00:39:56,195 --> 00:39:58,028
You know what mr.
Judson says to me?

822
00:39:58,063 --> 00:39:59,914
He says he-he
thinks i'm having
a nervous breakdown.

823
00:39:59,949 --> 00:40:00,531
He's out of his mind.

824
00:40:00,566 --> 00:40:01,782
Listen, laura,
i'm telling you,

825
00:40:01,817 --> 00:40:03,667
i saw those kids.

826
00:40:03,702 --> 00:40:04,919
I know who they are.

827
00:40:04,954 --> 00:40:06,170
Horace...

828
00:40:06,205 --> 00:40:06,787
they were running

829
00:40:06,822 --> 00:40:08,038
up and down the street,

830
00:40:08,073 --> 00:40:09,924
and-and-and swiping apples,

831
00:40:09,959 --> 00:40:11,792
and yelling, and having fun.

832
00:40:11,827 --> 00:40:13,043
That's all they were doing-

833
00:40:13,078 --> 00:40:14,929
having fun.

834
00:40:15,546 --> 00:40:17,431
They yell, "fins."

835
00:40:17,466 --> 00:40:19,934
Listen...
did you ever yell "fins"?

836
00:40:19,969 --> 00:40:22,436
But that's not what
we were talking about.

837
00:40:22,471 --> 00:40:24,305
Itiswhat
we were talking about-

838
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:25,556
me having to make a living
for three people

839
00:40:25,591 --> 00:40:27,441
while they're
just swiping apples

840
00:40:27,476 --> 00:40:28,058
and running up and down
the street.

841
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:29,944
Well, you're a
grown-up man!

842
00:40:29,979 --> 00:40:32,062
What do you think
you're supposed to do?

843
00:40:32,097 --> 00:40:33,948
They were sore
'cause some kid

844
00:40:33,983 --> 00:40:35,199
hadn't invited them
to a birthday party.

845
00:40:35,234 --> 00:40:37,701
That was their biggest problem
in their whole life!

846
00:40:37,736 --> 00:40:40,821
Horace, now,
you've got to stop!

847
00:40:47,711 --> 00:40:51,465
You don't have to shout.

848
00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:56,470
Horace?

849
00:40:56,505 --> 00:40:58,973
Horace, where
are you going?

850
00:40:59,008 --> 00:41:00,224
You can't go out now!

851
00:41:00,259 --> 00:41:04,595
You can't! Horace!

852
00:41:07,731 --> 00:41:09,600
What's wrong with him?

853
00:41:10,234 --> 00:41:13,988
Tell me, laura.

854
00:41:14,023 --> 00:41:15,856
What are you
going to do?

855
00:41:15,891 --> 00:41:17,107
Who are you
going to call?

856
00:41:17,142 --> 00:41:17,741
Laura, for
heaven's sakes,

857
00:41:17,776 --> 00:41:19,610
i've got to know
what's going on here.

858
00:41:19,645 --> 00:41:20,861
Who are you
going to call?

859
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:22,746
I don't know.

860
00:41:22,781 --> 00:41:23,998
That's the whole thing.

861
00:41:24,033 --> 00:41:26,500
I don't know
who i'm going to call.

862
00:41:26,535 --> 00:41:27,751
What's the name
of a doctor?

863
00:41:27,786 --> 00:41:30,871
Tell me the name
of a doctor.

864
00:41:32,157 --> 00:41:34,625
Horace?

865
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:38,512
Surprise!

866
00:41:38,547 --> 00:41:39,763
Happy birthday!

867
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:10,461
Frank on a roll?

868
00:42:10,496 --> 00:42:13,330
Three cents each.

869
00:42:20,721 --> 00:42:23,841
Bread and butter.
Bread and butter.

870
00:42:25,092 --> 00:42:26,977
Davy!

871
00:42:27,012 --> 00:42:30,097
You come home,
or you're going to get smacked!

872
00:42:30,981 --> 00:42:32,850
Ice cream!

873
00:42:32,885 --> 00:42:34,735
Get your chocolate,
vanilla,

874
00:42:34,770 --> 00:42:36,604
strawberry ice cream!

875
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:39,490
Watch where
you're going.

876
00:42:52,753 --> 00:42:56,624
Ring-a-levio,
caught, caught, caught.

877
00:42:56,659 --> 00:42:59,760
Ring-a-levio.

878
00:43:14,642 --> 00:43:16,143
Hey, hermy.

879
00:43:16,178 --> 00:43:17,778
Hermy brandt,
come on.

880
00:43:19,897 --> 00:43:21,398
Come on.

881
00:43:28,038 --> 00:43:30,541
Let's swipe some apples.
You each grab one.

882
00:43:30,576 --> 00:43:31,792
Hey, micky, larry.

883
00:43:33,043 --> 00:43:34,912
Hey... wait.

884
00:43:38,415 --> 00:43:39,667
Hey, can you imagine
not being invited

885
00:43:39,702 --> 00:43:40,918
to that birthday party?

886
00:43:40,953 --> 00:43:42,169
Can you imagine?

887
00:43:42,204 --> 00:43:44,922
Yeah, and i'm supposed
to be his best friend.

888
00:43:44,957 --> 00:43:45,556
He stinks!

889
00:43:46,173 --> 00:43:47,558
We ought to mob-ilize him,
right, hermy?

890
00:43:47,593 --> 00:43:49,310
Oh, and how.

891
00:43:49,345 --> 00:43:51,061
Why don't we bust in
on the party?

892
00:43:51,096 --> 00:43:52,930
Fellas.

893
00:43:52,965 --> 00:43:54,181
Oh, what for?

894
00:43:54,216 --> 00:43:56,433

00:43:59,722 --> 00:44:02,823

898
00:44:02,858 --> 00:44:04,074
I have to tell you this.

899
00:44:04,692 --> 00:44:06,076
Step on a line,
you break your father's spine.

900
00:44:06,111 --> 00:44:07,945
Will you
cut it out?

901
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:10,447

905
00:44:18,624 --> 00:44:21,091

00:44:25,998 --> 00:44:27,348

912
00:44:38,644 --> 00:44:39,860

913
00:44:39,895 --> 00:44:41,478

914
00:44:41,513 --> 00:44:43,364

915
00:44:43,399 --> 00:44:45,866

916
00:44:45,901 --> 00:44:48,369

00:44:48,404 --> 00:44:51,989

929
00:45:44,425 --> 00:45:47,795
He dropped this.

930
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:22,773
Oh!

931
00:47:31,031 --> 00:47:33,534
Horace.

932
00:47:33,569 --> 00:47:36,036
I'm here.

933
00:47:36,071 --> 00:47:39,156
It's all right,
horace, i'm here.

934
00:47:39,191 --> 00:47:41,658
Laura?

935
00:47:41,693 --> 00:47:46,046
Yes. It's all right.

936
00:47:46,081 --> 00:47:48,549
Laura?

937
00:47:50,417 --> 00:47:52,920
Don't ask me anything.

938
00:47:52,955 --> 00:47:54,171
I won't.

939
00:47:54,206 --> 00:47:57,307
Because i could never...

940
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:01,061
just don't.

941
00:48:05,432 --> 00:48:07,935
Are you all right now?

942
00:48:07,970 --> 00:48:09,820
Yes.

943
00:48:09,855 --> 00:48:12,940
But you're all cut
and everything.

944
00:48:12,975 --> 00:48:15,442
It doesn't matter.

945
00:48:15,477 --> 00:48:17,945
Let's go home.

946
00:48:21,698 --> 00:48:26,086
I don't know what
happened to me, laura.

947
00:48:26,121 --> 00:48:29,206
I have no idea.

948
00:48:31,091 --> 00:48:34,211
But...

949
00:48:34,246 --> 00:48:36,713
for one minute...

950
00:48:36,748 --> 00:48:41,101
or one second...

951
00:48:41,136 --> 00:48:44,855
or maybe one hour-

952
00:48:44,890 --> 00:48:47,975
i don't know-

953
00:48:48,010 --> 00:48:51,111
i saw something that...

954
00:48:51,146 --> 00:48:55,482
made every memory
i ever had a lie.

955
00:48:56,984 --> 00:48:59,486
Because when i was a kid,

956
00:48:59,521 --> 00:49:06,376
it was an ugly, sad,
unbearable nightmare.

957
00:49:08,879 --> 00:49:11,381
And i saw it.

958
00:49:11,416 --> 00:49:14,501
I know what it was.

959
00:49:14,536 --> 00:49:18,255
I remember it now.

960
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:21,391
I don't know what happened
to you, either, horace,

961
00:49:21,426 --> 00:49:23,894
but i think
we're all like that.

962
00:49:23,929 --> 00:49:29,516
We remember what was good,
and we black out what was bad,

963
00:49:29,551 --> 00:49:32,653
maybe because we couldn't live
if we didn't.

964
00:49:34,905 --> 00:49:35,522
Let's go home.

965
00:49:35,557 --> 00:49:38,659
There's a
party waiting.

966
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:02,432
Exit mr. And mrs. Horace ford,

967
00:50:02,467 --> 00:50:04,935
who have lived
through a bizarre moment

968
00:50:04,970 --> 00:50:08,055
not to be calibrated
on normal clocks or watches.

969
00:50:08,090 --> 00:50:09,940
Time has passed, to be sure,

970
00:50:09,975 --> 00:50:13,060
but it's the special time
in the special place

971
00:50:13,095 --> 00:50:16,813
known as... the twilight zone.
