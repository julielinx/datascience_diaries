1
00:00:06,591 --> 00:00:10,310
You unlock this door
with the key of imagination.

2
00:00:10,345 --> 00:00:12,062
Beyond it
is another dimension-

3
00:00:12,097 --> 00:00:14,564
a dimension of sound,

4
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:16,449
a dimension of sight,

5
00:00:16,484 --> 00:00:18,952
a dimension of mind.

6
00:00:18,987 --> 00:00:21,454
You're moving into a land
of both shadow and substance,

7
00:00:21,489 --> 00:00:23,323
of things and ideas.

8
00:00:23,358 --> 00:00:27,077
You've just crossed over
into the twilight zone.

9
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:41,224
Okay, and thank you for calling.

10
00:00:41,259 --> 00:00:43,093
Yeah.

11
00:00:43,128 --> 00:00:44,978
We'll be watching.

12
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:04,864
That was
colonel connacher, honey.

13
00:01:04,899 --> 00:01:07,367
He says daddy is just fine.

14
00:01:07,402 --> 00:01:09,869
Will he... will he
be going up soon?

15
00:01:09,904 --> 00:01:11,121
In just about
an hour.

16
00:01:11,156 --> 00:01:14,874
That's what
colonel connacher said.

17
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:18,011
Do you want
to go back to sleep?

18
00:01:18,046 --> 00:01:20,513
I don't blame you.
I can't sleep either.

19
00:01:20,548 --> 00:01:23,016
I'll tell you what.

20
00:01:23,051 --> 00:01:25,518
I'll make some
coffee for me

21
00:01:25,553 --> 00:01:28,021
and some cocoa
for you.

22
00:01:28,056 --> 00:01:30,523
And you wash your
face and hands

23
00:01:30,558 --> 00:01:31,775
and comb your hair.

24
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:34,894
And then we'll turn on
the television set, okay?

25
00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:36,146
Okay.

26
00:02:19,689 --> 00:02:22,192
Be safe, bob.

27
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:25,945
Be safe, darling.

28
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:32,202
And come back.

29
00:02:32,237 --> 00:02:36,206
In the vernacular of space
this is t minus one hour-

30
00:02:36,241 --> 00:02:40,593
60 minutes before a human being
named major robert gaines

31
00:02:40,628 --> 00:02:43,713
is lifted off from
the mother earth and rocketed

32
00:02:43,748 --> 00:02:46,216
into the sky
farther and longer

33
00:02:46,251 --> 00:02:48,718
than any man ahead of him.

34
00:02:48,753 --> 00:02:52,972
Call this one of the first
faltering steps of man

35
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:55,358
to sever the umbilical cord
of gravity

36
00:02:55,393 --> 00:02:57,861
and stretch out a fingertip
toward an unknown.

37
00:02:57,896 --> 00:03:00,613
Shortly, we'll join
this astronaut named gaines

38
00:03:00,648 --> 00:03:04,984
and embark on an adventure,
because the environs overhead-

39
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:07,487
the stars, the sky,
the infinite space-

40
00:03:07,522 --> 00:03:09,989
are all part
of a vast question mark

41
00:03:10,024 --> 00:03:13,126
known as the twilight zone.

42
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:02,258
Huh. Pulse normal?

43
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,127
Reasonable.

44
00:04:04,162 --> 00:04:07,263
Someplace between
nonchalance and panic.

45
00:04:07,298 --> 00:04:09,132
I know the feeling.

46
00:04:09,167 --> 00:04:10,883
I called helen. She's fine.

47
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:12,769
Says to tell you
they'll be waiting.

48
00:04:12,804 --> 00:04:14,270
Bless you for that.

49
00:04:14,305 --> 00:04:16,773
Do you have any messages
for the angels?

50
00:04:16,808 --> 00:04:20,393
Hmm... give them a kiss for me-
any that you meet.

51
00:04:20,428 --> 00:04:23,896
On my last orbit, i'll lasso
a pair of gossamer wings

52
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:26,399
and ship them down
to you air express- collect.

53
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:30,153
Kind of an odd feeling,

54
00:04:30,787 --> 00:04:33,906
knowing i'll be moving
around the earth for a week.

55
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:35,792
That's progress.

56
00:04:35,827 --> 00:04:37,660
Gus grissom went 302 miles,

57
00:04:37,695 --> 00:04:40,797
glenn made three orbits,
schirra handled six.

58
00:04:40,832 --> 00:04:45,168
And you, bobby boy, are
going to go round and round.

59
00:04:45,203 --> 00:04:48,921
And, when you come back down,
maybe we'll be that much closer

60
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:51,424
to filing a claim
on some more sky.

61
00:04:51,459 --> 00:04:52,675
Good luck, buddy.

62
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:53,926
Thanks, bill.
Thanks a lot.

63
00:04:55,178 --> 00:04:57,680
This is capcom.

64
00:04:57,715 --> 00:05:02,068
Time is now at
t minus one minute
and counting.

65
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:08,324
Better hurry.

66
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:18,951
This is capcom.

67
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:25,208
The mx ten countdown
is now t minus
25 seconds.

68
00:05:25,243 --> 00:05:29,212
T minus 20 seconds

69
00:05:29,247 --> 00:05:30,463
19...

70
00:05:30,498 --> 00:05:32,965
18...

71
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,468
17... 16...

72
00:05:35,503 --> 00:05:38,104
15... 14...

73
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:40,606
13... 12...

74
00:05:40,641 --> 00:05:41,858
11...

75
00:05:41,893 --> 00:05:43,726
ten...

76
00:05:43,761 --> 00:05:45,728
nine... eight...

77
00:05:45,763 --> 00:05:48,865
seven... six...

78
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,367
five... four...

79
00:05:51,402 --> 00:05:55,488
three... two... one...

80
00:05:55,523 --> 00:05:56,739
zero.

81
00:06:21,397 --> 00:06:23,399
Go ahead, ten.
We read you loud and clear.

82
00:06:23,434 --> 00:06:27,153
Zero g, and i feel fine.

83
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:32,775
Spacecraft is beginning
to turn now.

84
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:33,659
Roger.

85
00:06:33,694 --> 00:06:35,528
Turnaround has started.

86
00:06:35,563 --> 00:06:38,664
Spacecraft is almost over.

87
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:44,420
I can see the booster just
a couple of yards behind me.

88
00:06:44,455 --> 00:06:45,671
It's quite a sight.

89
00:06:45,706 --> 00:06:48,791
Roger, ten. We still
read you loud and clear.

90
00:06:48,826 --> 00:06:50,676
Next transmission, bermuda.

91
00:06:50,711 --> 00:06:54,797
Roger. Understand
next transmission, bermuda.

92
00:06:56,299 --> 00:06:59,435
Phebus ten, bermuda.

93
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:01,437
Capcom tech on hm.

94
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:13,950
Phebus ten,

95
00:07:13,985 --> 00:07:15,818
this is zanzibar captech.

96
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:18,955
We have solid
telemetry contact.

97
00:07:22,825 --> 00:07:30,967
Phebus ten.

98
00:07:31,002 --> 00:07:33,469
Capcom calling phebus ten.

99
00:07:33,504 --> 00:07:34,971
We now have i.o.s., over.

100
00:07:35,006 --> 00:07:37,473
Phebus ten, your
voice transmissions

101
00:07:37,508 --> 00:07:39,976
are starting to
fade very badly.

102
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:43,846
Capcom, capcom,
this is phebus ten.

103
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:46,349
I've lost contact with you.

104
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:54,490
I've lost radar here!
I've lost radar!

105
00:07:54,525 --> 00:07:56,859
We don't have
contact here, either.

106
00:07:56,894 --> 00:07:58,110
No contact at all.

107
00:07:59,362 --> 00:08:01,864
Capcom tech calling phebus ten.

108
00:08:02,498 --> 00:08:05,618
Capcom, capcom,
this is phebus ten.

109
00:08:34,897 --> 00:08:36,782
Open the blinds,
nurse.

110
00:08:36,817 --> 00:08:38,034
Yes, doctor.

111
00:08:42,405 --> 00:08:45,408
Well, how
about it, gaines?

112
00:08:45,443 --> 00:08:46,659
Can you talk?

113
00:08:48,544 --> 00:08:49,161
Sure.

114
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:51,047
Sure, i can talk.

115
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:53,549
Hey, billy.

116
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,168
What happened?

117
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:58,054
Well, we were waiting

118
00:08:58,089 --> 00:09:00,556
for you to wake up
to tell us, bob.

119
00:09:00,591 --> 00:09:01,674
Tell you?

120
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:04,176
I can't tell you anything,
i blacked out.

121
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:06,679
We lost you
on radar

122
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:08,064
and radio.

123
00:09:08,099 --> 00:09:09,315
Absolutely
no contact.

124
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,183
It boils down
to this, gaines-

125
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:13,686
you're the only one
who can explain it.

126
00:09:13,721 --> 00:09:15,571
I can't explain anything.

127
00:09:18,074 --> 00:09:21,193
I had an odd sensation.

128
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:24,330
Last thing i remember
is the 15th orbit.

129
00:09:25,581 --> 00:09:28,701
After that,
i don't remember anything

130
00:09:28,736 --> 00:09:29,952
except this bed.

131
00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:32,455
I couldn't reach
the cape at all.

132
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:33,706
I kept trying.

133
00:09:33,741 --> 00:09:36,208
Why don't you let him
get some sleep?

134
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:38,711
I think he'll feel
a little clearer later on.

135
00:09:38,746 --> 00:09:40,846
I won't be any clearer
than i am right now.

136
00:09:40,881 --> 00:09:42,715
How could you lose me on radar?

137
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,600
Bill, do you mean to tell me

138
00:09:44,635 --> 00:09:47,103
every single tracking
station blacked out?

139
00:09:47,138 --> 00:09:48,220
Really, gentlemen, i...

140
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:51,357
just one last
question, please.

141
00:09:54,477 --> 00:09:56,362
Bob, there's
only one way

142
00:09:56,397 --> 00:10:00,733
you could head
back toward earth.

143
00:10:00,768 --> 00:10:03,986
That's just to spiral in,
and then head for water.

144
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,123
Your spacecraft
was found, intact,

145
00:10:07,158 --> 00:10:09,625
46 miles from where
you were launched.

146
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,128
Intact, bob,
on the ground.

147
00:10:12,163 --> 00:10:13,996
There was no evidence
of any damage,

148
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:15,247
not even a dent.

149
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:19,635
Somehow, some way, you
brought that spacecraft in,

150
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:20,886
and you landed her.

151
00:10:20,921 --> 00:10:21,504
Tell me how.

152
00:10:21,539 --> 00:10:24,006
Would you please explain to me

153
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:27,760
how you performed
an absolutely impossible act?

154
00:10:27,795 --> 00:10:29,011
I didn't.

155
00:10:29,046 --> 00:10:31,514
I had nothing
to do with it.

156
00:10:31,549 --> 00:10:34,650
I blacked out, general.
I simply blacked out.

157
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:39,021
There was some
factor up there,

158
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:42,024
something which i had
no control over,

159
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:43,909
something which must have...

160
00:10:44,527 --> 00:10:47,029
must have taken over for me.

161
00:10:48,664 --> 00:10:51,167
Hmm. Okay, uh...

162
00:10:51,202 --> 00:10:54,286
we'll talk
about it later.

163
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:56,789
This whole thing is
temporarily classified-

164
00:10:56,824 --> 00:10:59,291
i mean everything about it.

165
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:01,794
We'll simply make
the statement

166
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:04,296
that he regained
entry and he landed.

167
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:07,433
He's shaken up but
not seriously hurt.

168
00:11:07,468 --> 00:11:09,185
And that's the feed.
No extensions,

169
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,687
no enlargements
beyond that
simple statement.

170
00:11:11,722 --> 00:11:14,306
After we've been
able to probe this
thing a little while,

171
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:17,443
we might be able
to come up with
something we can let go.

172
00:11:17,478 --> 00:11:20,563
But, in the meantime,
it's a one-line release.

173
00:11:20,598 --> 00:11:23,699
"He got
back down." unquote.

174
00:11:26,068 --> 00:11:28,571
You get some
rest, bob.

175
00:11:28,606 --> 00:11:30,456
Talk to
you later.

176
00:11:33,576 --> 00:11:34,827
Yeah, you, uh...

177
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:36,078
sleep it off.

178
00:11:36,113 --> 00:11:38,581
There's an explanation
for everything.

179
00:11:38,616 --> 00:11:41,083
Well, don't worry about it now.

180
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:42,968
You're, uh, all doped up,

181
00:11:43,003 --> 00:11:44,837
and you're also dead tired.

182
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:47,840
You sleep it off,
and i'll see
what i can do

183
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:50,342
about getting you a
leave to get on home.

184
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:52,228
So rest easy, pal.

185
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:57,233
Bill?

186
00:11:58,601 --> 00:12:00,486
All along, i thought

187
00:12:00,521 --> 00:12:03,606
there was some kind
of malfunction up there-

188
00:12:03,641 --> 00:12:06,742
fuel or propulsion
or just communication.

189
00:12:06,777 --> 00:12:09,495
Maybe the malfunction
was closer to home.

190
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:11,997
Maybe it was
right up here
between my ears.

191
00:12:12,032 --> 00:12:14,500
Maybe astronaut robert gaines
went off the tracks.

192
00:12:14,535 --> 00:12:15,751
Maybe he couldn't
cut the mustard.

193
00:12:15,786 --> 00:12:18,871
Look, you talk like that-
you think like that-

194
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:21,373
and you'll come around
to believing it.

195
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:23,259
And that's stupid, bob.

196
00:12:23,294 --> 00:12:25,761
We're dealing with
nine natural laws

197
00:12:25,796 --> 00:12:28,264
plus a whole string
of imponderables.

198
00:12:28,299 --> 00:12:30,132
And reasons are going
to come out-

199
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:32,017
legitimate, rational reasons.

200
00:12:32,052 --> 00:12:35,771
Now, you just lie there
and breathe through your nose.

201
00:12:35,806 --> 00:12:37,022
I'll call
helen again

202
00:12:37,057 --> 00:12:38,891
and tell her
you're resting

203
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:40,776
and you'll
be home soon.

204
00:12:40,811 --> 00:12:42,027
Will i? Will i be home?

205
00:12:42,062 --> 00:12:45,781
Yeah. Unless you persuade
all the people around here

206
00:12:45,816 --> 00:12:47,650
that you need an attendant.

207
00:12:47,685 --> 00:12:49,535
Dream good.

208
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:51,403
I'll see you later.

209
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:10,806
Well?

210
00:13:10,841 --> 00:13:13,309
Oh, it'll all come
out in the wash.

211
00:13:13,344 --> 00:13:15,177
Will it?

212
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:17,062
Let me tell you
something, colonel...

213
00:13:17,097 --> 00:13:20,182
a man is sent up into space,
and then he orbits.

214
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:23,319
There are only three ways
he can break off contact.

215
00:13:23,354 --> 00:13:25,187
One is ionization,
and that didn't occur.

216
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:28,324
The other is sunspots,
and that didn't occur.

217
00:13:28,359 --> 00:13:30,192
The third is the man's death,

218
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:32,077
and he's lying there
on that bed

219
00:13:32,112 --> 00:13:33,946
breathing five by five.

220
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:38,951
All right, i'm waiting
for a fresh alternative,

221
00:13:38,986 --> 00:13:41,453
one i can take
without flinching.

222
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,956
One maybe i can repeat
to the president

223
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:48,344
without worrying about him
sticking me in a rubber room.

224
00:13:48,379 --> 00:13:49,595
What happened to gaines?

225
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:52,097
Where was he
for six solid hours

226
00:13:52,132 --> 00:13:54,600
when nobody in the world
could find him?

227
00:13:54,635 --> 00:13:58,971
How did he make a reentry
without burning up into a flake?

228
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:02,107
Sometime we'll
have to ask him.

229
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:14,620
Give her my love.

230
00:14:14,655 --> 00:14:16,238
Thanks for services rendered.

231
00:14:16,273 --> 00:14:17,489
I'll talk to you later.

232
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:19,241
No question about it.

233
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:20,492
Home, james.

234
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:00,282
Welcome home.

235
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:05,921
What's the matter, bob?

236
00:15:05,956 --> 00:15:09,041
Is that what you
did for therapy
while i was gone-

237
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:10,926
put up that fence?

238
00:15:10,961 --> 00:15:12,177
What do you mean?

239
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:15,297
That fence wasn't there
when i left last week.

240
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:17,182
Are you kidding me?

241
00:15:17,217 --> 00:15:20,302
That fence was there
when we bought the house.

242
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:24,056
Outer space does things
to memories, doesn't it?

243
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:25,941
Yeah.

244
00:15:25,976 --> 00:15:28,444
Yeah, so it appears.

245
00:15:39,555 --> 00:15:42,574
America's latest manned
orbital spaceflight

246
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:44,460
ends on a note of mystery today.

247
00:15:44,495 --> 00:15:47,579
With a cloak of secrecy being
placed over the entire project.

248
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:50,082
Millions were watching
the orbital flight

249
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:51,333
on television when, suddenly,

250
00:15:51,834 --> 00:15:54,336
the pictures were interrupted
with a terse announcement

251
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:56,839
that no further coverage
would be forthcoming.

252
00:15:56,874 --> 00:15:58,090
General stanley eaton

253
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:01,093
announced late this afternoon
that further information

254
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:03,595
would be forthcoming
at a later date

255
00:16:03,846 --> 00:16:05,097
but that, for the moment,

256
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:07,599
all aspects
of astronaut gaines' flight

257
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:09,485
would continue
to be top secret

258
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,987
pending further
investigation of data.

259
00:16:13,856 --> 00:16:15,107
You got any more
coffee out there?

260
00:16:15,142 --> 00:16:16,992
I'm making some.

261
00:16:17,027 --> 00:16:18,243
It'll be better in a minute.

262
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:20,746
I'm going upstairs
and put on a bathrobe.

263
00:16:20,781 --> 00:16:21,997
I'll be right back.

264
00:16:22,032 --> 00:16:23,866
Do you want maggie
to go get it for you?

265
00:16:23,901 --> 00:16:26,368
Both you and maggie
have been treating me

266
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:28,871
like a cross between
an eccentric millionaire

267
00:16:28,906 --> 00:16:30,756
and a piece
of fragile dresden.

268
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:32,624
I'll get my own
bathrobe, woman.

269
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:33,876
Be right back.

270
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:02,037
That's funny.

271
00:17:02,072 --> 00:17:03,906
Some chicken colonel
back at the base

272
00:17:03,941 --> 00:17:06,408
is going to be running
home in his undershirt.

273
00:17:06,443 --> 00:17:08,293
Bob, your
coffee's ready.

274
00:17:08,328 --> 00:17:10,796
You want us to
bring you up a cup?

275
00:17:10,831 --> 00:17:12,664
No, honey. I'll be right down.

276
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,550
Want to hear something funny?

277
00:17:14,585 --> 00:17:16,418
I ran off
with somebody's shirt-

278
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:18,303
a full colonel's, no less.

279
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:09,721
Bob?

280
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:10,973
What?

281
00:18:13,475 --> 00:18:15,360
Are you all right?

282
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:20,365
Helen...

283
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,617
without trying
to scare you,

284
00:18:21,652 --> 00:18:24,119
and without trying
to make you wonder

285
00:18:24,154 --> 00:18:25,988
whether i've still
got all my marbles,

286
00:18:26,023 --> 00:18:28,490
i'd like to ask
you a question.

287
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:30,375
What is it?

288
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:33,495
When i left-

289
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:35,998
when i walked out of here-

290
00:18:36,033 --> 00:18:37,883
what was my rank?

291
00:18:37,918 --> 00:18:39,751
Your rank?

292
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:41,637
What was my rank?

293
00:18:41,672 --> 00:18:43,505
What do you mean?

294
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,390
Wasn't i a major?

295
00:18:45,425 --> 00:18:47,893
Haven't i been
a major for 13 months?

296
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:51,647
Are you serious?

297
00:18:51,682 --> 00:18:55,400
No, i'm playing games with you.

298
00:18:55,435 --> 00:18:57,903
Helen, i want you to tell me.

299
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,023
You're a colonel, bob.

300
00:19:01,058 --> 00:19:03,525
You're a
full colonel.

301
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:07,279
You've been a
colonel since
last march.

302
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:11,033
Last march?

303
00:19:11,667 --> 00:19:12,918
Last march.

304
00:19:12,953 --> 00:19:16,672
I want to say
something to you now.

305
00:19:16,707 --> 00:19:18,540
I, um...

306
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:22,928
i don't know what
happened up there.

307
00:19:22,963 --> 00:19:25,430
I have no idea.

308
00:19:25,465 --> 00:19:26,682
But, uh...

309
00:19:26,717 --> 00:19:28,550
i know you
don't want

310
00:19:28,585 --> 00:19:29,801
to talk
about it-

311
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:33,555
that's why we haven't
said anything- but, uh...

312
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,440
something must
have happened, bob.

313
00:19:35,475 --> 00:19:37,059
Some delusions.

314
00:19:40,195 --> 00:19:42,064
Some distortions.

315
00:19:42,099 --> 00:19:44,566
Like that fence
outside the house.

316
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,451
I don't remember it.

317
00:19:46,486 --> 00:19:49,571
And yet you said
it had been there

318
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:51,456
when we bought
the house.

319
00:19:51,491 --> 00:19:54,576
And that business
with bill connacher.

320
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:58,330
He told me he called you
before the flight.

321
00:19:58,365 --> 00:20:00,215
He made it
a point to tell me.

322
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,084
And then, afterward...

323
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:07,089
afterward, he said
there'd been no such
phone conversation.

324
00:20:07,124 --> 00:20:09,591
It's unimportant.

325
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:13,345
It's insignificant, really.

326
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,230
And yet...

327
00:20:17,733 --> 00:20:20,235
and yet it all
seems to be part

328
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:22,738
of some sort
of crazy pattern.

329
00:20:24,606 --> 00:20:26,491
Something is very wrong,

330
00:20:26,526 --> 00:20:28,994
because he did
tell me he called.

331
00:20:29,029 --> 00:20:32,114
That fence wasn't there,
and those eagles have never been

332
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:35,867
on my collar before
because, when i left
here, i was a major.

333
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:42,758
You, um...
you told me once

334
00:20:42,793 --> 00:20:45,877
that there are whole
areas of space medicine

335
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:49,014
that we know
practically
nothing about.

336
00:20:49,049 --> 00:20:51,633
Phenomena and
reaction patterns

337
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:54,136
that can only
be guessed at.

338
00:20:54,171 --> 00:20:56,638
I'm sure this
is one of them.

339
00:20:56,673 --> 00:21:01,026
I'm sure there's nothing
wrong with you but a...

340
00:21:01,061 --> 00:21:02,277
couple of fixations

341
00:21:02,312 --> 00:21:05,397
that are going
to go away with time.

342
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:09,901
Now...

343
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:13,655
let's go downstairs
and have a cup
of coffee.

344
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:16,158
And don't let
a white fence

345
00:21:16,193 --> 00:21:18,043
and a promotion end
the world for you.

346
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:21,296
If that's as far as it goes,
i'll try not to.

347
00:21:21,913 --> 00:21:23,165
But what if...

348
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,417
what if other things...?

349
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:25,977
Um...

350
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:29,731
i'd like colonel
william connacher, please.

351
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:45,380
I was, uh...

352
00:22:45,415 --> 00:22:47,883
i was just, uh...

353
00:22:47,918 --> 00:22:50,385
going to call
bill connacher

354
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,254
to ask him
if he'd like to...

355
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:54,005
like to what?

356
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,142
Come over for dinner.

357
00:23:01,263 --> 00:23:03,765
Bob, i, uh...
i just called bill

358
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,268
to have him give me
some reassurance.

359
00:23:06,303 --> 00:23:08,770
I remember that...
that he said once

360
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:12,524
that there are some aspects
to prolonged weightlessness

361
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:13,775
that makes...

362
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:16,278
look, really, like i
said, i'm all right.

363
00:23:16,313 --> 00:23:18,780
It's you people
i'm worried about.

364
00:23:18,815 --> 00:23:21,917
Now, where's
my coffee?

365
00:23:21,952 --> 00:23:23,785
I'll get it for you.

366
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:26,922
Don't break any more
saucers, mother's helper.

367
00:23:26,957 --> 00:23:28,790
I'll try not to.

368
00:23:39,434 --> 00:23:42,554
Helen?

369
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:45,056
Helen, i think it'd
be a whole lot better-

370
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:47,559
a whole lot better- if we
dropped all the pretenses.

371
00:23:47,594 --> 00:23:51,196
If you think there's something
wrong with me, just say so.

372
00:23:51,231 --> 00:23:54,950
And honey,
i'd consider it
a real favor-

373
00:23:54,985 --> 00:23:57,452
a major favor- if you wouldn't
walk past me on tiptoe

374
00:23:57,487 --> 00:23:58,703
with forced smiles

375
00:23:58,738 --> 00:24:01,823
and "there's nothing
wrong with you" dialogue.

376
00:24:01,858 --> 00:24:03,708
All right?

377
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:06,828
All right.

378
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,091
Ahh!

379
00:24:20,126 --> 00:24:21,977
I helped mommy
make the pie.

380
00:24:22,012 --> 00:24:25,096
You know, someday, i'm going
to lose you to a navy ensign

381
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:27,599
who'll marry you
for your father's money

382
00:24:27,634 --> 00:24:30,101
and your cooking.

383
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:33,238
Now, honey, you know
i don't take sugar.

384
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,245
Maggie...

385
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,113
honey, what's
the matter?

386
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:43,615
Nothing.

387
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:45,500
Nothing's
the matter.

388
00:24:46,117 --> 00:24:49,254
Maggie, here.

389
00:24:49,289 --> 00:24:51,122
Tell daddy
what's the matter.

390
00:24:52,123 --> 00:24:54,009
Daddy...

391
00:24:54,044 --> 00:24:56,511
daddy, you're different.

392
00:24:56,546 --> 00:24:58,129
Well, how, honey?

393
00:24:58,164 --> 00:25:00,015
How am i different?

394
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:01,883
I don't know.

395
00:25:01,918 --> 00:25:03,134
I don't know, but you are.

396
00:25:03,768 --> 00:25:05,020
Youaredifferent.

397
00:25:05,055 --> 00:25:06,888
You're very different. There...

398
00:25:06,923 --> 00:25:08,773
there's something
wrong.

399
00:25:09,391 --> 00:25:10,642
Maggie!

400
00:25:12,394 --> 00:25:14,896
What does
she mean?

401
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:19,901
I don't know.

402
00:25:19,936 --> 00:25:21,152
What does
she mean?

403
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:24,906
What does she mean,
i'm different?

404
00:25:24,941 --> 00:25:28,043
Well, am i?

405
00:25:28,078 --> 00:25:29,294
Am i, helen?

406
00:25:29,329 --> 00:25:31,162
Have i changed
somehow

407
00:25:31,197 --> 00:25:33,665
between now
and when i left?

408
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:37,419
I can't...

409
00:25:39,921 --> 00:25:42,424
i can't
explain it to you.

410
00:25:42,459 --> 00:25:44,309
I don't know how.

411
00:25:46,177 --> 00:25:49,314
I have changed,
haven't i?

412
00:25:49,349 --> 00:25:52,434
There is something
different about me.

413
00:25:52,469 --> 00:25:54,319
The child sensed it.

414
00:25:54,354 --> 00:25:57,439
You have, too.

415
00:25:57,474 --> 00:25:59,324
You have,
haven't you?

416
00:26:01,192 --> 00:26:02,444
Yes, i have.

417
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:04,946
How?

418
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:08,700
I...

419
00:26:10,585 --> 00:26:12,454
i don't know. I...

420
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:17,459
i just don't
know. It's...

421
00:26:17,494 --> 00:26:21,212
it's just that you're...
you're not the same somehow.

422
00:26:27,469 --> 00:26:29,971
You didn't have to
call bill connacher.

423
00:26:30,605 --> 00:26:33,108
That wasn't necessary.

424
00:26:33,143 --> 00:26:36,861
Tomorrow i'll turn myself in
for psychiatric help.

425
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:41,483
I don't know what it is
that happened.

426
00:26:41,518 --> 00:26:42,734
Something did.

427
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:45,236
Something is
tearing us all apart.

428
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:48,990
Something so remote, we can't
even put it into words.

429
00:26:49,025 --> 00:26:53,244
Something...
something, until we
find out what it is,

430
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,747
it's going
to wreck us, helen.

431
00:27:00,135 --> 00:27:02,387
Ivan, there was nothing
he could tell you

432
00:27:02,422 --> 00:27:04,255
that occurred in space

433
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:07,392
that could give us some key
or something to all this?

434
00:27:07,427 --> 00:27:11,763
Nothing that he
could relate to me.

435
00:27:11,798 --> 00:27:15,266
I wouldn't recommend that
he remain here, however.

436
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:18,403
For the time being,
i'd like to treat him
as an outpatient.

437
00:27:18,438 --> 00:27:20,271
Have him come in
at intervals,

438
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:22,774
but in no way suggest
to him that he's in

439
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:25,910
an aberrant condition requiring
psychological treatment.

440
00:27:25,945 --> 00:27:27,162
This is one
of those instances

441
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:29,664
where the psychology
of the situation

442
00:27:29,699 --> 00:27:31,533
requires
very careful handling.

443
00:27:31,568 --> 00:27:34,669
We're right back
where we started, then.

444
00:27:34,704 --> 00:27:37,789
Uh... mrs. Gaines, i don't
mean to sound callous.

445
00:27:37,824 --> 00:27:40,925
He's an exceptional gentleman,
that husband of yours.

446
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,794
I think he'll be out
of the woods in no time.

447
00:27:42,829 --> 00:27:45,930
My concern happens to be,
very specifically,

448
00:27:45,965 --> 00:27:47,799
a space project, not a man.

449
00:27:47,834 --> 00:27:50,935
I understand, sir.

450
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:54,689
Mrs. Gaines,
what about that fence?

451
00:27:54,724 --> 00:27:57,809
It was there when
we bought the house.

452
00:27:57,844 --> 00:28:00,311
And when did he seem
surprised that it was there?

453
00:28:00,346 --> 00:28:02,814
The moment that he came
home yesterday morning.

454
00:28:04,699 --> 00:28:09,704
Really a very strange
collection of delusions.

455
00:28:09,739 --> 00:28:12,207
A white picket fence...

456
00:28:12,824 --> 00:28:14,709
a story...

457
00:28:14,744 --> 00:28:16,578
his own rank...

458
00:28:16,613 --> 00:28:19,714
and the last thing he said
was he doubted very much

459
00:28:19,749 --> 00:28:23,468
if president kennedy
would pin any medals on him.

460
00:28:23,503 --> 00:28:25,336
President who?

461
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:26,588
Kennedy.

462
00:28:26,623 --> 00:28:28,473
Someone named john kennedy.

463
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:29,841
Who's john kennedy?

464
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:33,094
Someone who
colonel gaines has decided

465
00:28:33,129 --> 00:28:34,979
is president of
the united states.

466
00:28:35,014 --> 00:28:36,848
And i share your bewilderment.

467
00:28:36,883 --> 00:28:39,350
I never heard of him either.

468
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:46,941
Twilight zonewill continue
after station identification.

469
00:29:13,101 --> 00:29:15,603
It isn't easy to say.

470
00:29:15,638 --> 00:29:17,472
Well...

471
00:29:17,507 --> 00:29:19,357
if it isn't
easy to say,

472
00:29:19,392 --> 00:29:21,226
then it's
better said,

473
00:29:21,261 --> 00:29:23,728
so get it out.

474
00:29:23,763 --> 00:29:26,865
Maggie's
noticed it, too.

475
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,733
Noticed what?

476
00:29:28,768 --> 00:29:32,487
That there's something...

477
00:29:32,522 --> 00:29:36,875
there's something
differentabout him.

478
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:41,246
It's something i can't
put my finger on, but...

479
00:29:41,281 --> 00:29:46,885
there's some...
there's something different.

480
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,753
Suggesting what?

481
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:53,758
Suggesting nothing.

482
00:29:53,793 --> 00:29:56,895
Something or everything.

483
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:58,763
What can it suggest?

484
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:03,151
Simply that there's
a man in my house who...

485
00:30:04,402 --> 00:30:06,271
a man in your house who what?

486
00:30:06,306 --> 00:30:10,658
The question is, a man
in my house whoiswhat?

487
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:15,663
Better, a man in
my house who is who?

488
00:30:17,782 --> 00:30:19,667
I think you just overshot me,

489
00:30:19,702 --> 00:30:22,170
unless i'm reading
you very wrong.

490
00:30:22,205 --> 00:30:25,924
No, maybe you're
reading me very right.

491
00:30:29,043 --> 00:30:31,546
Reassure me, bill.

492
00:30:31,581 --> 00:30:33,431
Tell me that,
uh... this thing

493
00:30:33,466 --> 00:30:38,436
my daughter and i
have this ice-cold
feeling about is way off.

494
00:30:38,471 --> 00:30:41,556
Tell us that we're
just being carried away

495
00:30:41,591 --> 00:30:44,058
by his problem.

496
00:30:44,093 --> 00:30:45,944
Tell us...

497
00:30:47,195 --> 00:30:49,063
tell us...

498
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:54,702
tell us that the
man in this house
is bob gaines.

499
00:30:56,571 --> 00:30:57,822
Hello, bill.

500
00:30:57,857 --> 00:30:59,073
How are you?

501
00:30:59,108 --> 00:31:00,325
Fine.

502
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,827
I just dropped over
to see how you were.

503
00:31:02,862 --> 00:31:04,078
Me?

504
00:31:04,113 --> 00:31:05,330
Well, that depends.

505
00:31:05,365 --> 00:31:09,083
Depends on just what are the
current standards for sanity-

506
00:31:09,118 --> 00:31:10,969
the acceptable outer limits.

507
00:31:11,004 --> 00:31:14,088
I've been going over a set
of encyclopedias up there,

508
00:31:14,123 --> 00:31:15,974
and jotting down some notes.

509
00:31:16,009 --> 00:31:18,476
I've uncovered some
very revealing items.

510
00:31:18,511 --> 00:31:20,979
There are some pretty
basic historical facts

511
00:31:21,014 --> 00:31:22,847
that simply don't jibe.

512
00:31:22,882 --> 00:31:24,098
For example,

513
00:31:24,133 --> 00:31:25,600
it talks about
a man named anderson

514
00:31:25,635 --> 00:31:28,102
who was sent
by the united states government

515
00:31:28,137 --> 00:31:29,988
to supervise the construction
of the panama canal.

516
00:31:30,023 --> 00:31:31,239
So?

517
00:31:31,274 --> 00:31:33,741
So, i never heard
of anyone
named anderson.

518
00:31:33,776 --> 00:31:36,244
It happened
to be a man
named goethals.

519
00:31:36,279 --> 00:31:39,998
It also talks about an american
ace named eddie rickenbacker

520
00:31:40,033 --> 00:31:42,500
from world war i
who was lost on a raft

521
00:31:42,535 --> 00:31:45,003
in the next war and never found.

522
00:31:45,038 --> 00:31:46,371
That's right.

523
00:31:46,406 --> 00:31:48,873
He crashed, and that
was the end of it.

524
00:31:48,908 --> 00:31:51,376
But that wasn't the end of it.

525
00:31:51,411 --> 00:31:52,627
The raft was found.

526
00:31:52,662 --> 00:31:54,512
Rickenbacker was saved.

527
00:31:54,547 --> 00:31:58,883
He became the president
of an airlines company.

528
00:31:58,918 --> 00:32:00,768
I've got dozens of items
like that.

529
00:32:00,803 --> 00:32:03,271
Men talked about
who never existed.

530
00:32:03,306 --> 00:32:05,773
Men who existed
and not even mentioned.

531
00:32:05,808 --> 00:32:09,277
Historical events that i know
happened a certain way

532
00:32:09,312 --> 00:32:11,145
somehow, according to
the encyclopedia,

533
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:13,648
didn't happen,
or happened another way.

534
00:32:13,683 --> 00:32:16,034
The things i remember
are not delusions.

535
00:32:16,069 --> 00:32:20,405
They're the legitimate
recollections of things
as i remember them.

536
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,656
But somehow, some way,

537
00:32:21,691 --> 00:32:25,410
this world seems to have
turned upside down for me.

538
00:32:25,445 --> 00:32:28,546
Well, not in
every way, you understand.

539
00:32:28,581 --> 00:32:31,666
Uh... by and large,
the people are the same.

540
00:32:31,701 --> 00:32:33,551
The names,
the streets,

541
00:32:33,586 --> 00:32:36,054
the mutual recollections
we all have

542
00:32:36,089 --> 00:32:37,305
of people and events.

543
00:32:37,672 --> 00:32:40,174
It's as if there were...

544
00:32:40,209 --> 00:32:44,562
there were another world
parallel to mine.

545
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:48,316
As if this world
were almost a twin,

546
00:32:48,351 --> 00:32:50,184
except for
some minor differences

547
00:32:50,219 --> 00:32:53,321
that happened somewhere
along the line of evolution.

548
00:32:54,689 --> 00:32:57,191
Bob, for the
love of heaven...

549
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:05,950
do you want to follow
that line of reasoning?

550
00:33:05,985 --> 00:33:08,453
Because, if you do,
there are a couple

551
00:33:08,488 --> 00:33:11,589
of built-in conditions
that go along with it.

552
00:33:11,624 --> 00:33:13,091
Conditions that
i don't think you

553
00:33:13,126 --> 00:33:14,959
or anyone else
wants to admit.

554
00:33:14,994 --> 00:33:17,462
First and foremost,

555
00:33:17,497 --> 00:33:19,964
they happen to
be that if all
this is true-

556
00:33:19,999 --> 00:33:22,467
if you suddenly uncovered
a theory

557
00:33:22,502 --> 00:33:24,352
that there are two earths,

558
00:33:24,387 --> 00:33:27,472
two sets of people,
two histories-

559
00:33:27,507 --> 00:33:30,608
and you somehow, inexplicably,

560
00:33:30,643 --> 00:33:33,728
crossed over to
the other dimension-

561
00:33:33,763 --> 00:33:36,230
then you're not
who we think you are.

562
00:33:36,265 --> 00:33:38,733
And we're not
who you think we are.

563
00:33:48,993 --> 00:33:50,244
Maggie?

564
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:51,496
Bob!

565
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:54,999
Let's get it out,
shall we?

566
00:33:55,034 --> 00:33:58,753
I'm so sick of
tiptoeing and whispers.

567
00:33:58,788 --> 00:34:00,004
Maggie!

568
00:34:03,508 --> 00:34:04,759
Come down here, baby.

569
00:34:04,794 --> 00:34:06,644
Come down right away.

570
00:34:17,021 --> 00:34:19,273
Honey...

571
00:34:19,308 --> 00:34:22,410
think this over
before you answer...

572
00:34:22,445 --> 00:34:24,278
but answer.

573
00:34:27,031 --> 00:34:28,916
Who am i, honey?

574
00:34:30,284 --> 00:34:32,537
Tell mommy and colonel
connacher who i am.

575
00:34:32,572 --> 00:34:33,788
Bob, please.

576
00:34:33,823 --> 00:34:35,039
No.

577
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:39,043
Now, sweetheart...

578
00:34:39,078 --> 00:34:42,180
you say whatever's on your mind.

579
00:34:42,215 --> 00:34:44,048
Tell them who i am.

580
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:49,554
I don't know who you are.

581
00:34:49,804 --> 00:34:51,689
Maggie, this
is your daddy.

582
00:34:51,724 --> 00:34:52,940
This is
your daddy.

583
00:34:52,975 --> 00:34:56,310
He's not my daddy.

584
00:34:56,345 --> 00:34:58,813
I don't know who he is.

585
00:35:01,949 --> 00:35:04,452
Oh, that wasn't fair.

586
00:35:04,487 --> 00:35:07,572
You've taken a little
child, impressionable-

587
00:35:07,607 --> 00:35:10,708
you've superimposed
on her your own doubts.

588
00:35:10,743 --> 00:35:12,577
I've done nothing
of the sort.

589
00:35:12,612 --> 00:35:14,462
I merely let her
say out loud

590
00:35:14,497 --> 00:35:16,964
what helen's been
thinking all along.

591
00:35:18,833 --> 00:35:22,587
And, heaven help me,
what i've been thinking.

592
00:35:28,092 --> 00:35:31,979
What you've just
told me is fantastic.

593
00:35:32,014 --> 00:35:34,482
How can you possibly...?

594
00:35:34,517 --> 00:35:36,350
It's incredible.

595
00:35:36,385 --> 00:35:37,602
Incredible.

596
00:35:37,637 --> 00:35:39,854
I helped build that spacecraft.

597
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:44,242
I know it very well.

598
00:35:44,277 --> 00:35:46,110
And this one

599
00:35:46,145 --> 00:35:48,613
is not the same one
we sent off.

600
00:35:48,648 --> 00:35:50,498
It's almost
a twin to it,

601
00:35:50,533 --> 00:35:53,000
down to the very
last nut and bolt,

602
00:35:53,035 --> 00:35:55,503
but it's simply not
the same spacecraft.

603
00:35:55,538 --> 00:35:57,371
It's a different vehicle.

604
00:35:57,406 --> 00:36:01,759
It's almost as if it came
out of the same mold,

605
00:36:01,794 --> 00:36:03,010
but every now and then-

606
00:36:03,045 --> 00:36:08,633
in the wiring,
in the control panel
and in the structure-

607
00:36:08,668 --> 00:36:11,769
there's a tiny
insignificant alteration.

608
00:36:11,804 --> 00:36:13,020
You add them all up

609
00:36:13,055 --> 00:36:16,774
and you come up with one
very irrevocable fact:

610
00:36:16,809 --> 00:36:21,145
Colonel gaines went up
in one spacecraft,

611
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:24,282
but he's obviously
come back in another.

612
00:36:24,317 --> 00:36:27,285
That leaves us
with two alternatives.

613
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:31,038
Colonel gaines
actually blacked out

614
00:36:31,073 --> 00:36:34,158
and has no knowledge
of what occurred.

615
00:36:34,193 --> 00:36:36,661
Or two:

616
00:36:36,696 --> 00:36:39,163
Colonel gaines is not
who we think he is.

617
00:37:02,069 --> 00:37:03,321
Colonel...

618
00:37:03,356 --> 00:37:07,074
i want you to examine
this vehicle carefully.

619
00:37:07,109 --> 00:37:10,828
I want you to be
able to say to me,

620
00:37:10,945 --> 00:37:13,447
without a single
shred of doubt,

621
00:37:13,482 --> 00:37:15,950
that this is the spacecraft
you were sent up in,

622
00:37:15,985 --> 00:37:17,835
and the spacecraft
you came down in.

623
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:19,704
This is of the essence now.

624
00:37:19,739 --> 00:37:21,589
Phebus ten, bermuda.

625
00:37:21,624 --> 00:37:22,840
Capcom tech m.h.m.

626
00:37:22,875 --> 00:37:25,343
You understand me?

627
00:37:25,378 --> 00:37:27,211
What?

628
00:37:27,246 --> 00:37:29,096
What's the matter with you?

629
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:34,101
Bob, what the general
is trying to get at

630
00:37:34,136 --> 00:37:35,970
is that there are

631
00:37:36,005 --> 00:37:39,106
delusions that a man
can suffer under stress.

632
00:37:39,141 --> 00:37:42,860
Now, all we want to do now is
try to retrace the chronology

633
00:37:42,895 --> 00:37:45,363
from the blastoff
through the orbits.

634
00:37:45,398 --> 00:37:48,482
And we want you
to check over
this capsule.

635
00:37:49,116 --> 00:37:51,619
I am talking about
a microscopic check, now, bob.

636
00:37:51,654 --> 00:37:54,121
We want to make
absolutely certain

637
00:37:54,156 --> 00:37:56,624
that we can separate
what is delusion

638
00:37:56,659 --> 00:37:59,126
from what might
conceivably be

639
00:37:59,161 --> 00:38:01,629
an incredible
series of events.

640
00:38:01,664 --> 00:38:03,497
The weather in the recovery are
is excellent.

641
00:38:03,532 --> 00:38:04,749
Bob, what's the matter with you?

642
00:38:04,784 --> 00:38:08,502
Three-foot waves,
only one-tenth cloud coverage,

643
00:38:08,537 --> 00:38:11,005
ten miles visibility.

644
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,890
Don't you hear that voice?

645
00:38:12,925 --> 00:38:14,759
Phebus ten, phebus ten...

646
00:38:14,794 --> 00:38:17,261
capcom tech, do you read me?

647
00:38:17,296 --> 00:38:19,764
Don't you hear that voice?

648
00:38:19,799 --> 00:38:21,649
What are you talking about?

649
00:38:21,684 --> 00:38:23,517
What voice are
you talking about?

650
00:38:23,552 --> 00:38:25,403
Leave the retro package on

651
00:38:25,438 --> 00:38:26,654
through the entire reentry.

652
00:38:26,689 --> 00:38:28,522
Gaines will have to override...

653
00:38:28,557 --> 00:38:30,408
that voice.

654
00:38:30,443 --> 00:38:31,659
...to 0.05...

655
00:38:34,814 --> 00:38:36,664
that voice!

656
00:38:40,034 --> 00:38:41,919
Retract the scope.

657
00:38:41,954 --> 00:38:43,170
Do you read?

658
00:38:43,205 --> 00:38:46,290
Don't you hear
that voice?

659
00:38:46,325 --> 00:38:49,427
Recommend you go
to reentry attitude and...

660
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:08,562
we'll give you the countdown
on retro-sequence time, bob.

661
00:39:08,597 --> 00:39:10,448
You're looking good.

662
00:39:10,483 --> 00:39:13,818
We have only 50 seconds
to retrograde. Over.

663
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,571
I'll give you a mark.

664
00:39:17,606 --> 00:39:19,457
45...

665
00:39:21,325 --> 00:39:22,576
mark.

666
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:27,832
I am on 8scs now,
and backing it up manually.

667
00:39:27,867 --> 00:39:29,967
30 seconds, bob.

668
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:34,338
Capcom, this is phebus ten.

669
00:39:34,373 --> 00:39:36,223
The retro warning is on.

670
00:39:36,258 --> 00:39:38,092
Roger, bob.

671
00:39:38,127 --> 00:39:40,594
Leave your retro pack on
through your pass over texas.

672
00:39:40,629 --> 00:39:41,846
Do you read?

673
00:39:41,881 --> 00:39:42,730
Roger.

674
00:39:45,232 --> 00:39:47,735
Five... four... three...

675
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:51,489
two... one... fire.

676
00:39:54,026 --> 00:39:56,494
Retros are firing.

677
00:39:56,529 --> 00:40:00,865
I'm starting my reentry now.

678
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:04,618
I'm going to fly by wire.

679
00:40:04,653 --> 00:40:07,755
I'm down to 15% on manual.

680
00:40:10,257 --> 00:40:13,010
Capcom, this is phebus ten.

681
00:40:13,045 --> 00:40:16,013
It's a real fireball out there.

682
00:40:16,048 --> 00:40:16,881
How are you doing?

683
00:40:16,916 --> 00:40:18,766
What's your general condition?

684
00:40:18,801 --> 00:40:20,017
How are you feeling?

685
00:40:20,052 --> 00:40:22,770
I'm feeling... i'm feeling fine.

686
00:40:22,805 --> 00:40:24,638
Condition is good.

687
00:40:25,139 --> 00:40:27,641
There's an awful lot
of fire out there.

688
00:40:27,676 --> 00:40:29,276
Capcom...

689
00:40:31,779 --> 00:40:34,281
one last question:

690
00:40:34,316 --> 00:40:36,650
Go ahead, bob. Go ahead.

691
00:40:36,685 --> 00:40:38,652
Who's the president
of the united states?

692
00:40:43,657 --> 00:40:45,543
Say again, would you, bob?

693
00:40:45,578 --> 00:40:48,045
We don't think we
got that. Say again.

694
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:51,549
Who is the president
of the united states?

695
00:40:51,584 --> 00:40:54,802
It sounds like you're
asking who the president is.

696
00:40:54,837 --> 00:40:57,171
That's precisely the question.

697
00:41:04,678 --> 00:41:07,181
I hope you said kennedy.

698
00:41:08,432 --> 00:41:10,317
I hope you said kennedy.

699
00:41:28,586 --> 00:41:29,837
Open the blinds, nurse.

700
00:41:29,872 --> 00:41:31,705
Yes, doctor.

701
00:41:39,213 --> 00:41:42,099
Our wandering boy is awake.

702
00:41:42,134 --> 00:41:43,968
Bill.

703
00:41:44,003 --> 00:41:45,853
Right here, buddy.

704
00:41:45,888 --> 00:41:47,471
How you feeling, gaines?

705
00:41:49,356 --> 00:41:51,859
That depends.

706
00:41:51,894 --> 00:41:54,979
Did you hear that last
question i asked up there?

707
00:41:55,014 --> 00:41:56,230
Just before reentry?

708
00:41:56,265 --> 00:41:58,115
You asked who
the president is.

709
00:41:58,150 --> 00:42:00,618
Was that some
sort of a gag?

710
00:42:00,653 --> 00:42:02,486
I didn't hear the answer.

711
00:42:02,521 --> 00:42:03,120
It was no gag.

712
00:42:03,155 --> 00:42:04,989
President kennedy.

713
00:42:05,024 --> 00:42:08,125
You were only gone
two days, major,
not two years.

714
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:17,384
What happened on that
second morning, gaines,
about your 15th orbit?

715
00:42:17,419 --> 00:42:21,138
We lost all contact
with you for a period
of almost six hours.

716
00:42:21,173 --> 00:42:26,143
No radar, no contact at all.

717
00:42:26,178 --> 00:42:28,646
We couldn't find out
what was wrong here.

718
00:42:28,681 --> 00:42:31,148
And we asked you that question
several times

719
00:42:31,183 --> 00:42:33,017
after we picked
you up again,

720
00:42:33,052 --> 00:42:34,268
but you ignored it.

721
00:42:34,902 --> 00:42:36,770
Six hours?

722
00:42:36,805 --> 00:42:38,272
That's how long it took.

723
00:42:38,307 --> 00:42:40,157
Then you came back in
loud and clear.

724
00:42:40,192 --> 00:42:41,775
I think later, sir.

725
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:44,278
Right now, i think
he should rest.

726
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:48,032
Bill...

727
00:42:48,067 --> 00:42:50,284
something...
something
happened.

728
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:53,170
I know you're not
going to believe this.

729
00:42:53,205 --> 00:42:56,924
I'm not absolutely certain
that i believe it myself.

730
00:42:56,959 --> 00:42:58,792
There's another dimension.

731
00:42:58,827 --> 00:43:02,546
I don't know how it exists
or where it exists.

732
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:07,551
But there's another world,
parallel to ours-

733
00:43:07,586 --> 00:43:10,688
the same people,
the same places,

734
00:43:10,723 --> 00:43:13,190
most of the same
chronology of events.

735
00:43:13,225 --> 00:43:14,441
Except, now and then,

736
00:43:14,476 --> 00:43:16,944
there's something
a little bit
different.

737
00:43:16,979 --> 00:43:18,195
How do you know
all this?

738
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:19,813
Because i was there, general.

739
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:22,316
I was there for almost a week.

740
00:43:22,351 --> 00:43:23,200
That's impossible.

741
00:43:23,235 --> 00:43:25,703
We only lost you
for about six hours.

742
00:43:25,738 --> 00:43:28,822
We had contact with you
all the rest of the time.

743
00:43:28,857 --> 00:43:30,207
I can't help that, sir.

744
00:43:30,242 --> 00:43:33,327
During that six hours,
i lived out a week.

745
00:43:33,362 --> 00:43:35,579
Doing what?

746
00:43:35,614 --> 00:43:38,716
Looking at our counterparts.
Looking at us.

747
00:43:38,966 --> 00:43:40,217
Us?

748
00:43:40,252 --> 00:43:42,720
Us, as we exist
in a parallel world.

749
00:43:42,755 --> 00:43:46,473
One that exists alongside,
but which we can't see.

750
00:43:46,508 --> 00:43:48,342
The world i stumbled into.

751
00:43:48,377 --> 00:43:49,843
I don't know how.

752
00:43:49,878 --> 00:43:53,597
Some kind of
space-time continuum,

753
00:43:53,632 --> 00:43:55,482
some warpage.

754
00:43:55,517 --> 00:43:58,102
There's a doorway
up there somewhere into it.

755
00:43:58,137 --> 00:43:59,353
It exists.

756
00:43:59,388 --> 00:44:02,489
Every now and then,
i think it's possible

757
00:44:02,524 --> 00:44:05,609
for somebody to fall through it,
and i did.

758
00:44:05,644 --> 00:44:07,494
How did you get back, bob?

759
00:44:07,529 --> 00:44:09,363
I don't
even know that.

760
00:44:09,398 --> 00:44:13,751
All i can remember is running
toward the spacecraft.

761
00:44:13,786 --> 00:44:17,504
Then... i was up there again...

762
00:44:17,539 --> 00:44:20,007
and then i was back here.

763
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:26,013
Well...

764
00:44:26,048 --> 00:44:28,515
bob, i think, uh...

765
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:31,018
sleep on this for a
little while, will you?

766
00:44:31,053 --> 00:44:32,269
Why?

767
00:44:32,304 --> 00:44:34,138
Because...

768
00:44:34,173 --> 00:44:37,891
i think, uh... this may
just be a delusion.

769
00:44:37,926 --> 00:44:39,143
Delusion?

770
00:44:39,178 --> 00:44:42,279
Bill, i can recount
to you every minute

771
00:44:42,314 --> 00:44:44,782
and everything that happened.

772
00:44:44,817 --> 00:44:49,153
Every line of dialogue,
every person that i met.

773
00:44:49,188 --> 00:44:51,655
I could recall to you
the streets,

774
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:52,906
the places, everything.

775
00:44:52,941 --> 00:44:55,409
This was no delusion.
It was no dream.

776
00:44:55,444 --> 00:44:57,911
I have no proof.

777
00:44:57,946 --> 00:45:00,414
I've told you that.

778
00:45:00,449 --> 00:45:01,665
Mm-hmm.

779
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:04,168
Well, um,
okay, major...

780
00:45:04,203 --> 00:45:07,304
we'll talk
about it later.

781
00:45:08,555 --> 00:45:11,675
Did anybody
phone helen?

782
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:14,812
She, uh... asked what
you wanted for supper.

783
00:45:16,063 --> 00:45:18,565
Will i be
able to leave?

784
00:45:19,817 --> 00:45:21,685
At least for an overnight.
Mm-hmm.

785
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:24,822
I want you back first thing in
the morning for some critique.

786
00:45:24,857 --> 00:45:27,324
I want to have a look
at those psychiatrists' faces

787
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:31,695
when you start talking to them
about parallel dimensions.

788
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:34,198
Meanwhile,
get some rest, major.

789
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:45,209
One last question.

790
00:45:45,244 --> 00:45:46,460
Be my guest.

791
00:45:47,094 --> 00:45:50,214
If we each have a counterpart,

792
00:45:50,249 --> 00:45:52,716
and you saw them,

793
00:45:52,751 --> 00:45:53,967
where was yours, bob?

794
00:45:54,002 --> 00:45:57,104
I don't know,
but he was a colonel.

795
00:45:57,139 --> 00:45:58,355
A full colonel.

796
00:45:58,390 --> 00:46:00,224
I hope he got back,

797
00:46:00,259 --> 00:46:03,977
'cause he has
a very beautiful wife

798
00:46:04,012 --> 00:46:07,731
and a very lovely
little daughter.

799
00:46:07,766 --> 00:46:09,616
I hope he got back.

800
00:46:25,749 --> 00:46:27,634
What do you think?

801
00:46:27,669 --> 00:46:29,503
Uh-uh.

802
00:46:29,538 --> 00:46:31,388
I don't think.

803
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:33,257
Not on this one, sir.

804
00:46:33,292 --> 00:46:35,142
What kind of trauma...?

805
00:46:35,177 --> 00:46:38,262
Something to set him
tilt like that? I...

806
00:46:38,297 --> 00:46:40,147
can we call
it "tilt," sir?

807
00:46:40,182 --> 00:46:42,015
Oh, what else?
Another dimension?

808
00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:45,769
Another world
parallel to ours?
Call that rational?

809
00:46:45,804 --> 00:46:47,654
Up there, who knows
what's rational

810
00:46:47,689 --> 00:46:48,906
and what isn't?

811
00:46:48,941 --> 00:46:51,408
We don't even
know the rules, sir,

812
00:46:51,443 --> 00:46:52,659
let alone the facts.

813
00:46:53,946 --> 00:46:55,779
We're...

814
00:46:55,814 --> 00:46:57,664
we're like little ants

815
00:46:57,699 --> 00:47:00,784
that have just
made it to the desert.

816
00:47:00,819 --> 00:47:03,287
Now we say we've
conquered the sahara

817
00:47:03,322 --> 00:47:05,789
and we haven't
conquered anything.

818
00:47:05,824 --> 00:47:08,926
We're only starting to find
the mysteries, general.

819
00:47:08,961 --> 00:47:11,428
We haven't even
begun to solve them.

820
00:47:11,463 --> 00:47:13,931
We're going to do
a lot of groping

821
00:47:13,966 --> 00:47:17,050
through a lot of dark nights,
through a lot of dark space,

822
00:47:17,085 --> 00:47:19,553
before we find the clues,
let alone the answers.

823
00:47:19,588 --> 00:47:22,689
We've got a long
way to go, sir.

824
00:47:25,192 --> 00:47:27,060
Okay.

825
00:47:29,563 --> 00:47:31,448
General?

826
00:47:34,568 --> 00:47:36,453
There's a message
from capcom, sir.

827
00:47:36,488 --> 00:47:38,322
I'll give it to you
as we got it.

828
00:47:38,357 --> 00:47:39,573
It doesn't make
much sense.

829
00:47:39,608 --> 00:47:42,075
Let me be the judge of that.
What's the message?

830
00:47:42,110 --> 00:47:43,961
Capcom reports telemetry

831
00:47:43,996 --> 00:47:46,463
with an
unidentified space vehicle.

832
00:47:47,714 --> 00:47:49,583
What?

833
00:47:49,618 --> 00:47:51,468
Yes, sir.
They had voice communication

834
00:47:51,503 --> 00:47:53,337
for about a minute and a half.

835
00:47:53,372 --> 00:47:55,839
The spacecraft identified
itself asastro seven,

836
00:47:55,874 --> 00:47:57,090
and the person
in it said-

837
00:47:57,125 --> 00:47:58,342
what'd he say?
What'd he say?

838
00:47:58,377 --> 00:48:01,478
He identified himself
as a colonel robert gaines.

839
00:48:01,513 --> 00:48:04,598
He asked for
reentry data.

840
00:48:05,232 --> 00:48:07,100
Colonelrobert gaines?

841
00:48:07,135 --> 00:48:08,352
Yes, sir.

842
00:48:08,387 --> 00:48:10,854
Then we got some garbled stuff,
and then nothing.

843
00:48:10,889 --> 00:48:12,105
And then what?

844
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:13,357
And then nothing, sir.

845
00:48:13,392 --> 00:48:17,110
We lost the visual sighting.
We lost all voice.

846
00:48:17,145 --> 00:48:19,613
The thing just disappeared.

847
00:48:20,864 --> 00:48:24,001
Get a transcript
of everything
that was said.

848
00:48:24,618 --> 00:48:26,503
Have it brought
to my office.

849
00:48:26,538 --> 00:48:29,006
And keep trying
to raise, uh...
whoever it was.

850
00:48:29,041 --> 00:48:30,257
Yes, sir.
We're still trying.

851
00:48:30,292 --> 00:48:32,125
Good. Uh... you
keep me in touch.

852
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,011
Yes, sir.

853
00:48:36,513 --> 00:48:38,382
Well, bill...

854
00:48:38,417 --> 00:48:40,884
you certainly were right

855
00:48:40,919 --> 00:48:43,387
when you said we
haven't even begun.

856
00:48:43,422 --> 00:48:45,889
We don't have
all the answers.

857
00:48:45,924 --> 00:48:48,392
We've got
a long way to go.

858
00:48:48,427 --> 00:48:51,528
What's on your mind?

859
00:48:51,563 --> 00:48:54,031
One thing. I'd
like to tell
astronaut gaines

860
00:48:54,066 --> 00:48:57,150
that his proof
just showed up
on a radar screen,

861
00:48:57,185 --> 00:48:57,784
however briefly.

862
00:48:57,819 --> 00:49:00,287
Yeah. Be my guest.

863
00:49:18,805 --> 00:49:20,674
Do me a favor,
would you, honey?

864
00:49:20,709 --> 00:49:22,926
Tell me who i am.

865
00:49:22,961 --> 00:49:24,811
What, daddy?

866
00:49:24,846 --> 00:49:26,063
Thank you, honey.

867
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:29,182
That's all
i need to know.

868
00:49:41,078 --> 00:49:42,946
Welcome home.

869
00:49:42,981 --> 00:49:44,831
It's good
to be home.

870
00:49:46,583 --> 00:49:48,452
Major robert gaines,

871
00:49:48,487 --> 00:49:52,839
a latter-day voyager just
returned from an adventure.

872
00:49:52,874 --> 00:49:54,091
Submitted to you

873
00:49:54,126 --> 00:49:57,844
without any recommendations
as to belief or disbelief.

874
00:49:57,879 --> 00:49:59,096
You can accept or reject.

875
00:49:59,131 --> 00:50:02,215
You pays your money,
and you takes your choice.

876
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:04,101
But credulous or incredulous,

877
00:50:04,136 --> 00:50:07,854
don't bother to ask anyone
for proof that it could happen.

878
00:50:07,889 --> 00:50:10,357
The obligation's
a reverse challenge-

879
00:50:10,392 --> 00:50:12,225
prove that itcouldn't.

880
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:15,362
This happens
to be the twilight zone.

881
00:50:21,702 --> 00:50:24,821
A new author joins the ranks
of thetwilight zonecrew

882
00:50:24,856 --> 00:50:29,209
when john furia jr. Gives us
several stunningly new twists

883
00:50:29,244 --> 00:50:32,579
to a classic character
in "i dream of genie."

884
00:50:32,614 --> 00:50:35,716
Join howard morris,
patrica barry and loring smith

885
00:50:35,751 --> 00:50:38,835
as they take their trip
into the twilight zone.

886
00:50:41,722 --> 00:50:44,841
Who...
who... who...?

887
00:50:44,876 --> 00:50:46,727
Who were
you expecting?

888
00:50:46,762 --> 00:50:47,978
Who...?

889
00:50:48,013 --> 00:50:50,480
I'm a genie in a lamp.
That's who.

890
00:50:50,515 --> 00:50:52,983
Aladdin, magic,
the whole bit.

891
00:50:53,018 --> 00:50:55,485
If... if you
