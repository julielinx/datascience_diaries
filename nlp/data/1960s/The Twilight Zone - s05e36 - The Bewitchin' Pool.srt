1
00:00:06,606 --> 00:00:09,726
You unlock this door
with the key of imagination.

2
00:00:09,761 --> 00:00:11,611
Beyond it is another dimension-

3
00:00:11,646 --> 00:00:12,862
a dimension of sound,

4
00:00:14,149 --> 00:00:15,982
a dimension of sight,

5
00:00:16,017 --> 00:00:17,867
a dimension of mind.

6
00:00:17,902 --> 00:00:20,987
You're moving into a land
of both shadow and substance,

7
00:00:21,022 --> 00:00:22,238
of things and ideas.

8
00:00:22,273 --> 00:00:26,626
You've just crossed over
into the twilight zone.

9
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:35,001
Children, your father
and i are going to divorce.

10
00:00:35,036 --> 00:00:38,254
Now if you don't
know what that means,

11
00:00:38,289 --> 00:00:40,140
well, it means that he's
going to live in one place,

12
00:00:40,175 --> 00:00:42,008
and, well, i'm going
to live in another

13
00:00:42,043 --> 00:00:43,893
just as far apart as we can get.

14
00:00:43,928 --> 00:00:46,763
What we want to
know from you kids

15
00:00:46,798 --> 00:00:49,899
is do you want to live
with me or with her?

16
00:00:49,934 --> 00:00:53,653
Now, it's going to
be up to you two.

17
00:00:53,688 --> 00:00:58,024
You've got to
make up your minds.

18
00:00:58,059 --> 00:00:59,909
We want it the way it was.

19
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:01,778
You better forget that.

20
00:01:01,813 --> 00:01:03,663
Amen.

21
00:01:03,698 --> 00:01:06,166
This time we'll be good.

22
00:01:06,201 --> 00:01:10,537
We won't fight, or cry
or make noise.

23
00:01:10,572 --> 00:01:13,673
We'll be good, won't we, jeb?

24
00:01:13,708 --> 00:01:15,041
What do you
mean, sport?

25
00:01:15,675 --> 00:01:20,046
Y'all hate each other
'cause you got us.

26
00:01:20,081 --> 00:01:21,548
Well, i'll tell you one thing...

27
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:22,799
if it hadn't been for you two,

28
00:01:22,834 --> 00:01:25,301
we wouldn't have stuck together
as long as we have.

29
00:01:25,336 --> 00:01:27,187
So show us
a little consideration.

30
00:01:27,222 --> 00:01:30,557
We don't have to stay
with neither one of you.

31
00:01:30,592 --> 00:01:32,692
Come on, jeb.

32
00:01:33,309 --> 00:01:35,195
Come back here!

33
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:36,446
We're not through
with you.

34
00:01:38,314 --> 00:01:40,817
What do you kids
think you're doing?

35
00:01:40,852 --> 00:01:41,951
We can't get back.

36
00:01:41,986 --> 00:01:43,820
We've got to.

37
00:01:46,322 --> 00:01:47,574
What are
they doing?

38
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:48,825
Come out!

39
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:49,459
Jeb, get out of there.

40
00:01:49,494 --> 00:01:50,710
You hear your daddy?

41
00:01:50,745 --> 00:01:52,579
Aunt t, help us, please!

42
00:01:52,614 --> 00:01:53,830
Aunt t?

43
00:01:53,865 --> 00:01:55,715
Come out of there!
Please, aunt t.

44
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:56,966
Kids!

45
00:01:57,001 --> 00:01:58,218
Jeb?

46
00:01:58,253 --> 00:01:58,835
What do they mean,
"aunt t"?

47
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:00,720
What do you kids
think you're doing?
Jeb?

48
00:02:00,755 --> 00:02:01,971
Do you hear your daddy?

49
00:02:02,006 --> 00:02:03,223
You're really going
to get it this time.

50
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,474
Sport, do you hear me?
Jeb?

51
00:02:04,509 --> 00:02:06,976
Are you coming out of there,
or i'm coming after you?!

52
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,599
They're down there
an awful long time.

53
00:02:12,634 --> 00:02:15,101
Yeah, i know.

54
00:02:15,136 --> 00:02:16,986
Do something-
they're drowning!

55
00:02:19,489 --> 00:02:23,243
Hurry!

56
00:02:23,278 --> 00:02:25,745
Oh! Please don't let them drown.

57
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:28,865
Don't let them drown.

58
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:32,752
They're not down there.

59
00:02:32,787 --> 00:02:36,506
They've got to be.

60
00:02:37,123 --> 00:02:39,008
They're not down there.

61
00:02:43,012 --> 00:02:45,515
A swimming pool
not unlike any other pool-

62
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:48,635
a structure built
of tile and cement and money,

63
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:51,137
a backyard toy for the affluent,

64
00:02:51,172 --> 00:02:53,022
wet entertainment
for the well-to-do.

65
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,776
But to jeb and sport sharewood,
this pool holds mysteries

66
00:02:57,393 --> 00:02:59,896
not dreamed of
by the building contractor

67
00:02:59,931 --> 00:03:02,398
not guaranteed
in any sales brochure.

68
00:03:02,433 --> 00:03:04,284
For this pool has a secret exit

69
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,152
that leads
to a never-never land,

70
00:03:06,187 --> 00:03:08,655
a place designed
for junior citizens

71
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:11,157
who need a long voyage
away from reality

72
00:03:11,192 --> 00:03:14,911
into the bottomless regions
of the twilight zone.

73
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:35,281
Introduction to
a perfect setting:

74
00:03:35,316 --> 00:03:39,669
Colonial mansion, spacious
grounds, heated swimming pool-

75
00:03:39,704 --> 00:03:41,537
all the luxuries money can buy.

76
00:03:41,572 --> 00:03:45,291
Brother and sister,

77
00:03:45,326 --> 00:03:49,679
names jeb and sport, healthy,
happy, normal youngsters.

78
00:03:49,714 --> 00:03:53,800
Gloria sharewood by name,

79
00:03:53,835 --> 00:03:55,685
glamorous by nature.

80
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,438
Gil sharewood,

81
00:03:58,473 --> 00:04:00,940
handsome, prosperous,
the picture of success.

82
00:04:01,557 --> 00:04:04,060
A man who has achieved
every man's ambition-

83
00:04:04,095 --> 00:04:07,814
beautiful children,
beautiful home, beautiful wife.

84
00:04:07,849 --> 00:04:10,066
Idyllic? Obviously.

85
00:04:10,101 --> 00:04:14,454
But don't look too carefully,
don't peek behind the facade.

86
00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:18,207
The idyll may have feet of clay.

87
00:04:18,242 --> 00:04:20,460
You're home early,
darling.

88
00:04:20,495 --> 00:04:23,579
Just what were you
doing in town today?

89
00:04:23,614 --> 00:04:25,465
So now i'm being followed.

90
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:28,217
Darn you
loud-mouthed kids!

91
00:04:28,252 --> 00:04:30,086
Pipe down
out there.

92
00:04:30,121 --> 00:04:31,721
Jeb?

93
00:04:31,756 --> 00:04:33,589
You're still
holding your breath?

94
00:04:33,624 --> 00:04:36,092
You're gonna suffocate yourself.

95
00:04:36,127 --> 00:04:38,845
It's the only way
i can keep quiet.

96
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,981
Mama didn't mean
we couldn't breathe.

97
00:04:42,016 --> 00:04:43,850
It was the yelling
and the hollering

98
00:04:43,885 --> 00:04:45,101
that was making her head ache.

99
00:04:45,136 --> 00:04:47,487
I'm just a natural born
screamer.

100
00:04:47,522 --> 00:04:49,989
Can't play unless i holler.

101
00:04:50,024 --> 00:04:52,742
I saw your car in the parking
lot next to the tv station.

102
00:04:52,777 --> 00:04:55,862
I had an interview-
anything wrong with that?

103
00:04:55,897 --> 00:04:59,615
I'm sick and tired
of my talent going to waste.

104
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:00,867
Your what?

105
00:05:00,902 --> 00:05:02,118
My talent.

106
00:05:02,153 --> 00:05:06,506
Now what high-fashion model
can hold a candle to me?

107
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:08,374
Is that what you
are this week?

108
00:05:08,409 --> 00:05:10,259
High-fashion model?

109
00:05:10,294 --> 00:05:14,013
Seems to me that last week
you were an artist.

110
00:05:14,048 --> 00:05:16,516
If they call me,
i'll take the job.

111
00:05:16,551 --> 00:05:20,269
You've got a job here-
taking care of those kids.

112
00:05:20,304 --> 00:05:21,521
What's the maid for,
sugar?

113
00:05:21,556 --> 00:05:22,772
What are you for, sugar?

114
00:05:22,807 --> 00:05:25,274
Look down there-
what do you see?

115
00:05:25,309 --> 00:05:26,893
A swimming pool.

116
00:05:26,928 --> 00:05:29,395
A pretend game, stupid.

117
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:31,147
What do you see?

118
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:32,648
Well...

119
00:05:32,683 --> 00:05:37,653
a river, and you and me floating
down on a raft like tom sawyer.

120
00:05:37,688 --> 00:05:38,905
See, jeb?
Mm-hmm.

121
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:42,041
We're coming
to an island

122
00:05:42,076 --> 00:05:45,161
full of caves
and rattle snakes

123
00:05:45,196 --> 00:05:46,412
and pirates.

124
00:05:46,447 --> 00:05:48,297
And witches.

125
00:05:48,332 --> 00:05:50,416
Well, you can have one witch,
just one.

126
00:05:50,451 --> 00:05:52,168
A fat one.

127
00:05:52,203 --> 00:05:54,170
Whoever heard of a fat witch?

128
00:05:54,205 --> 00:05:56,672
Well, i don't like skinny ones.

129
00:05:56,707 --> 00:05:58,558
They don't make fat ones.

130
00:05:58,593 --> 00:05:59,675
Look, it's my witch.

131
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:02,178
I can make them fat
if i want to.

132
00:06:02,213 --> 00:06:03,563
It's my game!

133
00:06:03,598 --> 00:06:05,181
Darn you loud-mouth kids.

134
00:06:05,681 --> 00:06:08,184
Now pipe down out there.

135
00:06:08,219 --> 00:06:13,189
I love you, sport.

136
00:06:13,224 --> 00:06:14,440
You're silly.

137
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:21,831
I'll have
my supper now.

138
00:06:21,866 --> 00:06:24,951
Cook for you after
the way you talked?

139
00:06:24,986 --> 00:06:26,836
Baby, you drink your supper.

140
00:06:26,871 --> 00:06:28,704
Oh, you witch.

141
00:06:31,242 --> 00:06:36,212
In the yard is a big, old swing
made out of a car tire.

142
00:06:36,247 --> 00:06:38,714
There's a little boy swinging.

143
00:06:38,749 --> 00:06:43,719
He gets tired of swinging
and goes into the kitchen.

144
00:06:43,754 --> 00:06:45,721
Smells like chocolate cake.

145
00:06:45,756 --> 00:06:47,607
There's a lady there.

146
00:06:47,642 --> 00:06:50,726
She picks the little boy up
and hugs him.

147
00:06:50,761 --> 00:06:53,863
The little boy is happy.

148
00:06:53,898 --> 00:06:57,617
The lady gives the little boy
chocolate cake and...

149
00:06:57,652 --> 00:07:00,119
have we been bad?

150
00:07:00,154 --> 00:07:01,988
Heck, no.

151
00:07:02,023 --> 00:07:05,124
Maybe i was bad
and i didn't know it.

152
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:08,878
Aw, fishhooks,
they'll stop after a while.

153
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:12,999
Hey! Want to have some fun?

154
00:07:13,034 --> 00:07:16,002
Where'd you
come from?

155
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:24,143
What mischief
you brats in now?

156
00:07:24,178 --> 00:07:25,645
Talking to this boy.

157
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,263
What boy?

158
00:07:27,298 --> 00:07:29,515
He's gone!

159
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,400
Darn fool
kids.

160
00:07:31,435 --> 00:07:33,903
Your supper's
going to be ready soon.

161
00:07:33,938 --> 00:07:35,771
You better be there on time.

162
00:07:35,806 --> 00:07:37,657
Now do you
hear me?

163
00:07:38,274 --> 00:07:38,908
Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am.

164
00:07:45,414 --> 00:07:47,283
Come on, you guys.

165
00:07:47,318 --> 00:07:49,035
Where?

166
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:51,037
A secret place. Come on!

167
00:07:51,072 --> 00:07:53,039
Who are you,
where are you from?

168
00:07:53,074 --> 00:07:54,674
Follow me!

169
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:58,794
Let's go
with that boy.

170
00:07:58,829 --> 00:08:00,680
She said
not to leave.

171
00:08:00,715 --> 00:08:02,548
They don't care
what we do.

172
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,433
Come on.

173
00:08:08,339 --> 00:08:10,189
They're going to
hurt each other.

174
00:08:10,224 --> 00:08:11,440
Listen, boy,
i'm older than you

175
00:08:11,475 --> 00:08:13,309
and i'm ordering you
what to do.

176
00:08:13,344 --> 00:08:15,194
Now, follow me.

177
00:08:33,462 --> 00:08:35,331
Howdy.

178
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:54,100
We weren't sure
you was coming.

179
00:08:54,135 --> 00:08:57,103
Aunt t sent these
just in case.

180
00:08:57,138 --> 00:08:58,354
Aunt t?

181
00:08:58,389 --> 00:08:59,605
Where are we?

182
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,490
At aunt t's.

183
00:09:01,525 --> 00:09:02,108
Where's that?

184
00:09:02,143 --> 00:09:03,859
Secret place.

185
00:09:03,894 --> 00:09:06,495
Sure got here funny.

186
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:11,500
Just dived in our pool
and came out here.

187
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,380
Sport, how did
we get here?

188
00:09:24,415 --> 00:09:28,768
I figure there's a hole in our
pool that nobody knows about.

189
00:09:28,803 --> 00:09:30,636
Maybe we got
caught in the tide.

190
00:09:31,922 --> 00:09:35,024
Don't you laugh
at my brother.

191
00:09:35,059 --> 00:09:37,526
Don't you laugh
at me, either.

192
00:09:37,561 --> 00:09:40,029
I'll chew you up
and spit you out.

193
00:09:40,064 --> 00:09:41,897
Let's see you!

194
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:44,400
I'll get you.

195
00:09:57,913 --> 00:09:59,665
Come and get me!

196
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,802
Aunt t, she's going to
beat me up, aunt t!

197
00:10:02,837 --> 00:10:04,670
Are you really,
child?

198
00:10:04,705 --> 00:10:07,807
Yes, ma'am, i aim to.

199
00:10:07,842 --> 00:10:10,926
I'll have to ask you
to fight outside.

200
00:10:10,961 --> 00:10:14,063
You're liable to break up
something in here.

201
00:10:14,098 --> 00:10:17,183
And i guess-
fight fair, fight fair.

202
00:10:17,218 --> 00:10:22,822
No hitting a man when he's down,
no hitting below the belt.

203
00:10:22,857 --> 00:10:25,324
You know the rules.

204
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:28,444
Now, while they're
settling their difficulties

205
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,329
you can finish icing the cake.

206
00:10:30,364 --> 00:10:32,198
Thank you, ma'am.

207
00:10:32,233 --> 00:10:34,083
And when
the two come back

208
00:10:34,118 --> 00:10:35,951
if they have
any teeth left

209
00:10:35,986 --> 00:10:37,837
they can help
us eat it.

210
00:10:37,872 --> 00:10:41,590
My, you are
very accomplished.

211
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:46,595
Have you had much
experience with cakes?

212
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:49,098
No, ma'am,
this is my first one.

213
00:10:49,133 --> 00:10:51,600
One would
never guess it.

214
00:10:51,635 --> 00:10:53,719
Oh, what,
back already?

215
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:55,604
We didn't go yet.

216
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:56,856
May i do that?

217
00:10:56,891 --> 00:10:58,107
Me, too?

218
00:10:58,142 --> 00:11:01,861
I thought you were going
to beat each other up.

219
00:11:01,896 --> 00:11:03,729
We'd rather do that.

220
00:11:03,764 --> 00:11:08,117
All right, you come round
here and be the boss.

221
00:11:08,152 --> 00:11:10,619
Sit down
right there.

222
00:11:10,654 --> 00:11:12,488
You're such
solemn children.

223
00:11:12,523 --> 00:11:14,990
Don't you know
how to laugh?

224
00:11:15,025 --> 00:11:16,492
What's there to laugh at?

225
00:11:16,527 --> 00:11:19,628
Well, i'm rather
a ridiculous old party.

226
00:11:19,663 --> 00:11:21,497
You could laugh at me.

227
00:11:21,532 --> 00:11:24,500
You're not funny, you're nice.

228
00:11:24,535 --> 00:11:25,751
Oh, thank you.

229
00:11:25,786 --> 00:11:29,505
Riddles, then-
who knows a riddle?

230
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:33,008
What do you call somebody
who crosses the ocean twice

231
00:11:33,043 --> 00:11:36,145
and doesn't take a bath
either way?

232
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,264
What would you call him, whitt?

233
00:11:38,299 --> 00:11:40,266
A dirty double-crosser.

234
00:11:41,435 --> 00:11:43,903
Aunt t,
all the frosting's gone.

235
00:11:43,938 --> 00:11:47,656
Well, you've made
a handsome job of the cake.

236
00:11:47,691 --> 00:11:51,410
Now, while it's cooling,
i'll assign you new children

237
00:11:51,445 --> 00:11:52,661
to your chores

238
00:11:52,696 --> 00:11:55,781
and i'll show you
where your rooms will be.

239
00:11:59,168 --> 00:12:01,036
Why,
what's the matter?

240
00:12:01,071 --> 00:12:02,922
We didn't come
here to stay.

241
00:12:02,957 --> 00:12:06,041
My dear, children
always come here to stay.

242
00:12:07,328 --> 00:12:08,544
No.

243
00:12:08,579 --> 00:12:09,795
But i want to.

244
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:12,047
Jeb sharewood, come back here.

245
00:12:12,082 --> 00:12:14,049
I want to stay
with aunt t.

246
00:12:14,084 --> 00:12:15,434
She's a kidnapper.

247
00:12:15,469 --> 00:12:16,685
No!

248
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,188
I've seen children
i would have stolen

249
00:12:19,223 --> 00:12:21,056
to get away
from unworthy parents,

250
00:12:21,091 --> 00:12:23,559
but i always resisted
the temptation.

251
00:12:23,594 --> 00:12:25,311
Sport? Jeb?

252
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:27,196
They're calling us.

253
00:12:27,231 --> 00:12:29,198
But i want to stay, sport.

254
00:12:29,233 --> 00:12:31,951
You darn kids, where are you?

255
00:12:31,986 --> 00:12:33,819
We better go home.

256
00:12:33,854 --> 00:12:37,706
Those voices you hear calling
at first seem quite strong,

257
00:12:37,741 --> 00:12:40,209
but after a while, they'll fade

258
00:12:40,244 --> 00:12:43,329
and one day, you simply
can't hear them anymore.

259
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:44,713
Sport?

260
00:12:44,748 --> 00:12:46,582
We've got to go home.

261
00:12:46,617 --> 00:12:48,334
Can you tell me why?

262
00:12:48,369 --> 00:12:52,588
Because we're their children,
we love them and they love us.

263
00:12:52,623 --> 00:12:54,974
Then you must
go back.

264
00:12:55,009 --> 00:12:56,842
And you, too.

265
00:12:56,877 --> 00:12:59,345
Your sister's reasons
are quite valid.

266
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,596
How do we
get home?

267
00:13:00,631 --> 00:13:02,481
Same way
you got here.

268
00:13:02,516 --> 00:13:04,350
We'll come see
you again soon.

269
00:13:04,385 --> 00:13:06,852
Oh, no, my darlings.

270
00:13:06,887 --> 00:13:09,989
I expect this
is our good-bye.

271
00:13:10,024 --> 00:13:13,108
Finding your way here again
would be quite difficult,

272
00:13:13,143 --> 00:13:14,360
if not impossible.

273
00:13:14,395 --> 00:13:16,245
Good-bye, aunt t.

274
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,496
I'll race you back
to the swimming hole!

275
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:50,830
Have you found them?

276
00:13:50,865 --> 00:13:51,831
Not a sign.

277
00:13:51,866 --> 00:13:53,082
I told them
not to leave this yard.

278
00:13:53,117 --> 00:13:55,584
They
have no respect for you.

279
00:13:55,619 --> 00:13:56,218
You're not firm enough.

280
00:13:56,253 --> 00:13:58,721
You just don't spend
enough time with them.

281
00:13:58,756 --> 00:13:59,338
You try putting up with

282
00:13:59,373 --> 00:14:01,841
their screaming and whining
24 hours a day.

283
00:14:01,876 --> 00:14:03,843
Mama!

284
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:07,596
Sport! Jeb!

285
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:10,099
Where have you two been?

286
00:14:10,134 --> 00:14:13,853
We've been calling you
for an hour.

287
00:14:13,888 --> 00:14:16,605
Get out
of that pool.

288
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,857
Sport, where
have you been?

289
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,359
Jeb, get out
of there now.
In the pool.

290
00:14:20,394 --> 00:14:22,862
You're lying,
i looked there.

291
00:14:22,897 --> 00:14:24,113
We really were, daddy.

292
00:14:24,148 --> 00:14:26,615
We came up
on the other side

293
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:29,118
and made a chocolate
cake with aunt t.

294
00:14:29,153 --> 00:14:31,620
Cake with... what's
he talking about?

295
00:14:31,655 --> 00:14:32,872
We caught a fish.

296
00:14:32,907 --> 00:14:35,374
He's just making
things up, daddy.

297
00:14:35,409 --> 00:14:36,625
He's lying
to cover up

298
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,877
whatever
you been in.

299
00:14:37,912 --> 00:14:40,379
I want the truth,
boy, no more lies.

300
00:14:40,414 --> 00:14:42,264
I wasn't
lying, i wasn't.

301
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:43,515
Jeb,
listen to me.

302
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:46,635
Get to your room
and stand in the corner

303
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:49,138
until you're ready
to tell the truth.

304
00:14:49,173 --> 00:14:50,389
It was just a game, daddy.

305
00:14:50,424 --> 00:14:52,892
We were just pretending.
There isn't any aunt t.

306
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,777
You go along
too, sport.

307
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:01,033
Those darn kids.

308
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:04,787
Sport? Jeb?

309
00:15:04,822 --> 00:15:05,404
Sport?

310
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:07,289
Here, mama.

311
00:15:07,324 --> 00:15:09,158
What are you
doing here, sport?

312
00:15:09,193 --> 00:15:10,409
I got up early.

313
00:15:10,444 --> 00:15:12,294
I couldn't sleep.

314
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:15,414
Well, where's
your brother jeb?

315
00:15:15,449 --> 00:15:16,665
In his room.

316
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,550
He's not in
the house anyplace.

317
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:20,419
I haven't seen him.

318
00:15:20,454 --> 00:15:21,670
Is breakfast ready?

319
00:15:22,304 --> 00:15:24,306
No. Now, your father's waiting.

320
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:26,809
Want to have a talk
with you kids.

321
00:15:26,844 --> 00:15:28,177
What about?

322
00:15:28,212 --> 00:15:30,062
There's going to be
some changes around here.

323
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:31,931
Things going to be better, mama?

324
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:34,566
You bet your sweet life
they are.

325
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:35,818
Now you go find jeb.

326
00:16:02,845 --> 00:16:05,347
Another one
of your chores, jeb,

327
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:08,467
will be to help whitt
bring in the wood.

328
00:16:08,502 --> 00:16:11,353
Why do there have to be chores?

329
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:14,223
Every child
must have chores to do.

330
00:16:14,258 --> 00:16:18,610
It teaches him dignity of work
and the joy of labor.

331
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:20,980
Makes big muscles,
too, like mine.

332
00:16:21,015 --> 00:16:22,865
Let's see.

333
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,733
Big,
ain't it?

334
00:16:24,768 --> 00:16:25,367
Wow.

335
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:27,870
Oh, come along, boys,
keep working.

336
00:16:27,905 --> 00:16:31,623
Aunt t,
what are all the shoes for?

337
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:32,992
For the children.

338
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:36,996
You mean all the children got
holes in their swimming pools?

339
00:16:37,031 --> 00:16:37,997
Oh, my dear, no.

340
00:16:38,032 --> 00:16:40,499
Some of them come down chimneys

341
00:16:40,534 --> 00:16:43,635
or you open a door
and there they are.

342
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:47,389
Sometimes you find them
on street corners or doorsteps

343
00:16:47,424 --> 00:16:49,258
like whitt there.

344
00:16:53,047 --> 00:16:57,399
Oh, sport,
dear, come in!

345
00:16:57,434 --> 00:16:59,518
I can't, i'm dripping wet.

346
00:16:59,553 --> 00:17:01,153
Oh, one minute.

347
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:07,526
There you are, my dear.

348
00:17:07,561 --> 00:17:08,777
Thank you, ma'am.

349
00:17:08,812 --> 00:17:11,280
I told you she'd come.

350
00:17:11,315 --> 00:17:14,416
Well, i'm surprised
that either one of you made it.

351
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:18,787
It's very rare that anybody
comes back here the second time.

352
00:17:21,924 --> 00:17:23,792
Sorry to bother you, ma'am.

353
00:17:23,827 --> 00:17:26,295
You're not
bothering me.

354
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:30,049
I'm glad to have somebody
to help me do my needlepoint.

355
00:17:30,084 --> 00:17:31,300
You do sew?

356
00:17:31,335 --> 00:17:33,052
No, ma'am.

357
00:17:33,685 --> 00:17:38,057
Well, you'll be surprised
how quickly you'll learn how.

358
00:17:38,092 --> 00:17:39,942
I can't stay.

359
00:17:39,977 --> 00:17:41,193
Oh.

360
00:17:41,228 --> 00:17:43,062
I only came
to get jeb.

361
00:17:43,097 --> 00:17:44,947
I ain't going.

362
00:17:44,982 --> 00:17:49,318
Things are going to be
different at home now, jeb.

363
00:17:49,353 --> 00:17:50,569
Mama told me.

364
00:17:50,604 --> 00:17:52,204
Told you what?

365
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:55,324
They aren't going
to yell at each other.

366
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:57,209
Is that all?

367
00:17:57,244 --> 00:17:57,826
No.

368
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:00,329
We're going to
take trips.

369
00:18:00,364 --> 00:18:00,963
Where?

370
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:05,968
Oh, everywhere-
disneyland, ohio...

371
00:18:06,003 --> 00:18:09,088
australia,
the north pole.

372
00:18:09,123 --> 00:18:10,973
Anywhere
we want to go.

373
00:18:11,008 --> 00:18:14,093
I don't want to go
to them places.

374
00:18:14,128 --> 00:18:15,978
Are you coming
or do i throw you

375
00:18:16,013 --> 00:18:19,098
over my shoulder
like a sack of potatoes?

376
00:18:19,133 --> 00:18:22,851
Sport, has something
changed at home?

377
00:18:22,886 --> 00:18:23,735
Yes, ma'am.

378
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,604
Everything will be
different now.

379
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:27,606
In what way?

380
00:18:27,641 --> 00:18:29,608
They're going to love us.

381
00:18:29,643 --> 00:18:31,243
Really?

382
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:32,995
Yes, ma'am, my mama told me.

383
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:36,115
She wants to tell jeb, too.

384
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:38,750
Jeb, you'd look undignified
if sport threw you

385
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:41,870
across her shoulder
like a bag of potatoes.

386
00:18:41,905 --> 00:18:43,755
If i was you,
i'd go willingly.

387
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,624
I'm staying right here.

388
00:18:45,659 --> 00:18:50,629
If we leave this time,
we won't never get to come back.

389
00:18:50,664 --> 00:18:52,764
If what sport tells us is true,

390
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,267
you weren't meant
to be here at all

391
00:18:55,302 --> 00:18:57,136
but at home
with your mother and father.

392
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:00,139
Do i have to go?

393
00:19:00,174 --> 00:19:02,141
I strongly advise it.

394
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:10,899
There's only one
truly precious thing
in the world

395
00:19:10,934 --> 00:19:14,036
that one human being
can give to another

396
00:19:14,071 --> 00:19:15,287
and that's love.

397
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:17,656
If i was
a young person

398
00:19:17,691 --> 00:19:21,410
on my way to receive
that wondrous gift,

399
00:19:21,445 --> 00:19:24,796
i'd go with
a smile on my face.

400
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:26,665
Oh, much better.

401
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,918
And i do think
if love was waiting
somewhere for me,

402
00:19:29,953 --> 00:19:33,672
well, i'd run to it
just swiftly as the wind.

403
00:19:33,707 --> 00:19:35,557
You ain't kidding me?

404
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:36,808
I ain't kidding.

405
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:38,060
Bye, whitt.

406
00:19:38,095 --> 00:19:39,311
Bye.

407
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:44,316
Don't worry, aunt t,
everything will be all right.

408
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:46,185
Good-bye,
love.

409
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:54,326
Maybe, um, we ought
to wait till tonight.

410
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:56,828
No, let's get it over
with now.

411
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:59,948
I've got people
waiting at the office.

412
00:19:59,983 --> 00:20:02,451
For once put your family
ahead of your office.

413
00:20:02,486 --> 00:20:03,702
You miserable...

414
00:20:03,737 --> 00:20:04,953
breakfast ready?

415
00:20:04,988 --> 00:20:07,706
I told you to find jeb,
not play in the pool.

416
00:20:07,741 --> 00:20:09,591
He was
in the pool.

417
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,211
Don't you know what happens
to children who lie?

418
00:20:12,594 --> 00:20:15,097
They go to hell
and get burned up.

419
00:20:15,132 --> 00:20:17,849
Sit down, your father's
got some good news.

420
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:19,101
Sport told me.

421
00:20:19,136 --> 00:20:21,603
We're going to be
a happy family

422
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:22,854
and take trips.

423
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:25,357
Jeb, uh...

424
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:28,477
uh...
you tell them.

425
00:20:28,512 --> 00:20:32,231
Children, your father
and i are going to divorce.

426
00:20:32,266 --> 00:20:35,867
Now if you don't
know what that means,

427
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:37,736
well, it means that he's
going to live in one place,

428
00:20:37,771 --> 00:20:38,987
and, well, i'm going
to live in another

429
00:20:39,621 --> 00:20:41,490
just as far apart as we can get.

430
00:20:41,525 --> 00:20:44,376
What we want to
know from you kids

431
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:47,496
is do you want to live
with me or with her?

432
00:20:47,531 --> 00:20:51,250
Now, it's going to be
up to you two.

433
00:20:51,285 --> 00:20:55,637
You've got to
make up your minds.

434
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:57,506
We want it the way it was.

435
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,391
You better forget that.

436
00:20:59,426 --> 00:21:01,260
Amen.

437
00:21:01,295 --> 00:21:03,762
This time we'll be good.

438
00:21:03,797 --> 00:21:08,150
We won't fight or cry
or make noise.

439
00:21:08,185 --> 00:21:11,270
We'll be good, won't we, jeb?

440
00:21:11,305 --> 00:21:13,272
What do you
mean, sport?

441
00:21:13,307 --> 00:21:17,776
Y'all hate each other
'cause you got us.

442
00:21:17,811 --> 00:21:19,027
Well, i'll tell you one thing...

443
00:21:19,062 --> 00:21:20,279
if it hadn't been for you two,

444
00:21:20,314 --> 00:21:22,781
we wouldn't have stuck together
as long as we have.

445
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:25,033
So show us
a little consideration.

446
00:21:25,068 --> 00:21:28,170
We don't have to stay
with neither one of you.

447
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,289
Come on, jeb.

448
00:21:30,922 --> 00:21:32,791
Come back here!

449
00:21:32,826 --> 00:21:34,042
We're not through
with you.

450
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:38,430
What do you kids
think you're doing?

451
00:21:38,465 --> 00:21:39,548
We can't get back.

452
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:40,799
We've got to.

453
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:45,304
What are
they doing?

454
00:21:45,339 --> 00:21:46,555
Come out!

455
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:47,806
Jeb, get out of there.

456
00:21:47,841 --> 00:21:48,440
You hear your daddy?

457
00:21:48,475 --> 00:21:50,309
Aunt t, help us, please!

458
00:21:50,344 --> 00:21:51,560
Aunt t?

459
00:21:51,595 --> 00:21:53,445
Come out of there!
Please, aunt t.

460
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,696
Kids!

461
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:55,947
Jeb?

462
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:57,199
What's the matter
with them?

463
00:21:57,234 --> 00:21:58,450
Are you coming out of there?

464
00:21:58,485 --> 00:22:02,704
Aunt t, please!
Aunt t, aunt t, help us!

465
00:22:02,739 --> 00:22:04,573
Aunt t, please take us.

466
00:22:07,709 --> 00:22:08,577
What do they mean,
"aunt t"?

467
00:22:08,612 --> 00:22:10,462
What do you kids
think you're doing?

468
00:22:10,497 --> 00:22:11,713
Do you hear your daddy?

469
00:22:11,748 --> 00:22:12,964
You're really going
to get it this time.

470
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:14,216
Sport, do you hear me?
Jeb?

471
00:22:14,251 --> 00:22:16,718
Are you coming out of there,
or i'm coming after you?!

472
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:22,341
They're down there
an awful long time.

473
00:22:22,376 --> 00:22:24,226
Yeah, i know.

474
00:22:24,261 --> 00:22:26,728
Do something-
they're drowning!

475
00:22:29,231 --> 00:22:32,984
Hurry!

476
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,237
Oh! Please don't let them drown.

477
00:22:35,272 --> 00:22:38,357
Don't let them drown.

478
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,363
They're not down there.

479
00:22:44,398 --> 00:22:48,617
They've got to be.

480
00:22:48,652 --> 00:22:50,502
They're not down there.

481
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:08,019
Howdy!

482
00:23:26,189 --> 00:23:31,159
Jeb? Sport?

483
00:23:31,194 --> 00:23:33,662
Isn't this good,
jeb?

484
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:38,049
What's the matter,
sport?

485
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:40,168
Thought i heard something.

486
00:23:40,203 --> 00:23:45,807
Children, where are you?

487
00:23:45,842 --> 00:23:47,676
Please come back.

488
00:23:47,711 --> 00:23:48,927
Aunt t...

489
00:23:48,962 --> 00:23:52,063
may i have another
piece of cake, please?

490
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:53,064
Me, too.

491
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:54,316
Indeed.

492
00:23:54,351 --> 00:23:56,184
Isn't it good?

493
00:23:56,219 --> 00:23:58,069
Oh, this is fine.

494
00:23:58,104 --> 00:23:59,321
Good cake.

495
00:23:59,356 --> 00:24:00,572
Mm-hmm.

496
00:24:01,858 --> 00:24:04,693
A brief epilogue
for concerned parents:

497
00:24:04,728 --> 00:24:05,944
Of course there isn't
any such place

498
00:24:05,979 --> 00:24:07,946
as the gingerbread house
of aunt t

499
00:24:07,981 --> 00:24:09,197
and we grown-ups know

500
00:24:09,232 --> 00:24:11,450
there's no door at the bottom
of a swimming pool

501
00:24:11,485 --> 00:24:12,701
that leads to a secret place.

502
00:24:12,736 --> 00:24:13,952
But who can say how real

503
00:24:13,987 --> 00:24:17,088
the fantasy world
of lonely children can become?

504
00:24:17,123 --> 00:24:18,957
For jeb and sport sharewood,

505
00:24:18,992 --> 00:24:21,460
the need for love
turned fantasy into reality.

506
00:24:21,495 --> 00:24:26,465
They found a secret place
in the twilight zone.
