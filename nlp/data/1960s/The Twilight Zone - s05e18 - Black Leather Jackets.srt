1
00:00:07,724 --> 00:00:10,977
You unlock this door
with the key of imagination.

2
00:00:11,012 --> 00:00:13,229
Beyond it is another dimension-

3
00:00:13,264 --> 00:00:14,481
a dimension of sound,

4
00:00:15,517 --> 00:00:17,484
a dimension of sight,

5
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:19,736
a dimension of mind.

6
00:00:19,771 --> 00:00:22,489
You're moving into a land
of both shadow and substance,

7
00:00:22,524 --> 00:00:23,990
of things and ideas.

8
00:00:24,025 --> 00:00:27,744
You've just crossed over
into the twilight zone.

9
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:07,153
You know
who they are?

10
00:03:07,188 --> 00:03:08,905
No, i don't know.

11
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,407
Strange type
for this neighborhood.

12
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:17,413
And you stay away
from them, young lady.

13
00:03:26,055 --> 00:03:28,057
Is that it, boys?

14
00:03:28,092 --> 00:03:29,559
Yeah, man,
that's it.

15
00:03:29,594 --> 00:03:33,062
Ain't you got any furniture,
any chairs or rugs or anything?

16
00:03:33,097 --> 00:03:34,814
Man, i said
that's it.

17
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:37,066
Okay, mac, okay.

18
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,322
We got work to do.

19
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:18,474
Three strangers
arrive in a small town.

20
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:20,977
Three men in
black leather jackets

21
00:04:21,012 --> 00:04:22,979
in an empty rented house.

22
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:25,982
We'll call them steve
and scott and fred,

23
00:04:26,017 --> 00:04:28,234
but their names
are not important.

24
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:29,736
Their missionis...

25
00:04:29,771 --> 00:04:31,988
as three men
on motorcycles lead us

26
00:04:32,023 --> 00:04:33,990
into the twilight zone.

27
00:04:56,681 --> 00:04:58,014
What's wrong with the tv?

28
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:03,269
It's not
just the tv.

29
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:06,272
All the lights in the
house are flickering.

30
00:05:06,522 --> 00:05:09,275
Did you leave something
on in the kitchen?

31
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,277
Dishwasher,
anything like that?

32
00:05:11,527 --> 00:05:13,529
No, dishes
are all stacked.

33
00:05:13,564 --> 00:05:16,282
Tv's still off.

34
00:05:21,037 --> 00:05:23,790
It might be the
aerial wire, stu,

35
00:05:23,825 --> 00:05:25,041
it slipped loose or
something once before.

36
00:05:25,076 --> 00:05:27,043
I doubt if that would affect
all the lights in the house

37
00:05:27,078 --> 00:05:30,296
but it's easy enough to check.

38
00:05:36,302 --> 00:05:38,304
It seems all right.

39
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:48,314
Martha, come here a moment.

40
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:49,565
Look.

41
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,068
That wasn't there
this morning, was it?

42
00:05:52,103 --> 00:05:54,203
No. The andersons
took their antenna

43
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:55,955
with them when
they moved.

44
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:56,956
Just our luck.

45
00:05:56,991 --> 00:05:57,957
What?

46
00:05:57,992 --> 00:05:59,208
Ham radio operators.

47
00:05:59,243 --> 00:06:00,209
You know what they do

48
00:06:00,244 --> 00:06:01,711
to radio
and television reception.

49
00:06:01,746 --> 00:06:02,712
Daddy?

50
00:06:02,747 --> 00:06:03,713
Yeah, ellen?

51
00:06:03,748 --> 00:06:04,964
I don't know what's the matter,

52
00:06:04,999 --> 00:06:07,467
but i was listening to my radio
while i was studying

53
00:06:07,502 --> 00:06:10,219
and all of a sudden, it began
picking up these weird voices.

54
00:06:10,254 --> 00:06:11,721
Ham radio
operators.

55
00:06:11,756 --> 00:06:14,724
Is there anything
we can do about it?

56
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:18,227
We can make sure they've
got a license to operate.

57
00:06:18,262 --> 00:06:20,980
Well, do you think
you should, stu?

58
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:24,484
Those men seem so, kind
of threatening, somehow.

59
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,782
Hello?

60
00:07:19,288 --> 00:07:21,290
Anybody home?

61
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:32,168
Good evening.

62
00:07:32,203 --> 00:07:34,670
I'm stu tillman.

63
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:36,672
Live over next door.

64
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:38,925
Been having a little
trouble over there

65
00:07:39,175 --> 00:07:41,677
with my electricity-
it fades on and off.

66
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:46,432
Now you boys don't happen to
be ham radio operators, do you?

67
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:50,436
What's so funny?

68
00:07:50,471 --> 00:07:52,572
Big daddy want to know
what's so funny.

69
00:07:52,607 --> 00:07:55,575
Who are you boys any way?

70
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:57,326
We are monsters,
daddy-o.

71
00:07:57,361 --> 00:07:59,078
We came from outer space.

72
00:07:59,113 --> 00:08:01,330
Take us to
your leader.

73
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:03,082
Now just a minute...

74
00:08:03,117 --> 00:08:04,584
cool it, daddy-o,

75
00:08:04,619 --> 00:08:06,335
or i'll disintegrate you
with my ray gun.

76
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:08,087
Now you...

77
00:08:08,122 --> 00:08:09,839
look at this cat dance.
No, wait, wait.

78
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:11,340
Wait, wait, wait.

79
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:14,594
Wait. Wait a minute!

80
00:08:14,844 --> 00:08:17,847
Wait a minute!

81
00:08:17,882 --> 00:08:20,349
I'm going to get the
police on you fellas.

82
00:08:20,384 --> 00:08:21,851
And i'm going to
call my lawyer.

83
00:08:21,886 --> 00:08:25,104
You're going to be sorry
that you did this...

84
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:27,106
forget it.

85
00:09:16,272 --> 00:09:18,274
Stu?

86
00:09:21,777 --> 00:09:23,779
Stu, what is it?

87
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:25,781
What's happened to you?

88
00:09:29,785 --> 00:09:33,039
Stu, those men, what
have they done to you?

89
00:09:33,074 --> 00:09:34,540
Nothing.

90
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:36,792
They didn't do anything.

91
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:40,046
Well, you were... you
were going to ask them

92
00:09:40,296 --> 00:09:42,548
about the
television interference.

93
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:45,051
Oh, it wasn't them,
they're nice boys.

94
00:09:45,086 --> 00:09:47,553
They're three
very nice boys.

95
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:52,308
Oh, hey, wait for me.

96
00:09:53,809 --> 00:09:55,561
Darn you.

97
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,951
Trouble?

98
00:10:01,986 --> 00:10:03,202
Did you see that bus?

99
00:10:03,237 --> 00:10:04,203
It pulled right away.

100
00:10:04,238 --> 00:10:05,454
It's like a game with them.

101
00:10:05,489 --> 00:10:07,206
They like to make people suffer.

102
00:10:07,241 --> 00:10:08,708
Why do they do that?

103
00:10:08,743 --> 00:10:09,825
Beats me.

104
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,077
Thank your lucky stars

105
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:13,329
you don't have to depend
on buses to get around.

106
00:10:13,462 --> 00:10:15,464
Stars are lucky?

107
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:17,333
You know that old expression.

108
00:10:17,466 --> 00:10:19,719
I understand
about the constellations-

109
00:10:19,754 --> 00:10:22,722
the nature of
the galactic structure, but...

110
00:10:22,757 --> 00:10:25,975
i mean, i dig stars,
but they're lucky?

111
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:26,976
That's a gas.

112
00:10:27,011 --> 00:10:28,227
Yeah, so are you.

113
00:10:28,262 --> 00:10:29,979
One minute you
sound like a professor

114
00:10:30,014 --> 00:10:32,982
and the next minute, you're
talking like a beatnik.

115
00:10:33,017 --> 00:10:34,233
You need a ride?

116
00:10:34,268 --> 00:10:37,236
You're not going by
the library, are you?

117
00:10:37,271 --> 00:10:38,237
I could.

118
00:10:38,272 --> 00:10:39,989
With me on
the backseat?

119
00:10:40,024 --> 00:10:41,490
Why not?

120
00:10:43,993 --> 00:10:44,994
You ready?

121
00:10:45,029 --> 00:10:45,995
Yes.

122
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:56,622
I told her to stay
away from those boys.

123
00:10:56,657 --> 00:10:59,375
She missed her bus
and he offered a ride.

124
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:01,377
I'm sure
that's all it is.

125
00:11:01,412 --> 00:11:02,878
I would
have driven her.

126
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:04,380
But you're not a
handsome, young man

127
00:11:04,415 --> 00:11:05,631
on a motorcycle, dear.

128
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:21,397
I don't see any library.

129
00:11:21,432 --> 00:11:23,149
Well, it's on
the other side of park,

130
00:11:23,184 --> 00:11:24,900
but you got me here
so quickly,

131
00:11:24,935 --> 00:11:25,901
i thought i'd walk.

132
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:27,153
Would you like to walk?

133
00:11:27,188 --> 00:11:29,405
Sure.

134
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:37,663
Pretty, isn't it?

135
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:39,165
Mm-hmm.

136
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,169
You know, this is kind
of a special place with me.

137
00:11:43,204 --> 00:11:44,670
I come here some times

138
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:47,423
and i just try
to figure things out.

139
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:48,674
Like what?

140
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:49,925
Well, for one thing,

141
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:53,179
did you know that you have
lived next door to me

142
00:11:53,214 --> 00:11:55,681
for a week and you've
never said hello?

143
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:57,183
Hello.

144
00:11:57,218 --> 00:11:58,684
My name is ellen.

145
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:00,436
My name is scott.

146
00:12:00,471 --> 00:12:01,437
Where are you from?

147
00:12:01,472 --> 00:12:03,439
I mean, where did you live
before you moved next door?

148
00:12:03,474 --> 00:12:04,940
Long way from here.

149
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:06,192
Where?

150
00:12:06,227 --> 00:12:08,194
Oh, i doubt you ever
even heard of it.

151
00:12:08,229 --> 00:12:11,947
Could be- geography
is one of my worst subjects.

152
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:13,449
Have you finished school?

153
00:12:13,484 --> 00:12:15,701
Yes. Ten years ago.

154
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:17,953
Ten years ag...
oh, you're not that old.

155
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:19,955
I'm older than you'd think.

156
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,957
My people just don't
show their age.

157
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:24,460
Well, my family's
the same way.

158
00:12:24,495 --> 00:12:25,711
You know, my grandmother
lived to be 90

159
00:12:25,961 --> 00:12:26,962
and you would've
taken her for 60

160
00:12:26,997 --> 00:12:28,964
until the day she died.

161
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:30,216
What's the matter?

162
00:12:30,251 --> 00:12:32,968
I've never seen
anything so beautiful.

163
00:12:33,969 --> 00:12:35,971
Thank you.

164
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:38,474
Well, i guess
i'd better be going

165
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:41,477
before the
library closes.

166
00:12:44,613 --> 00:12:46,982
It's not as late
as i thought it was.

167
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:48,984
Tell me more
about yourself.

168
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:51,487
He'll be here,
he got delayed.

169
00:12:51,522 --> 00:12:53,989
I'm not interested
in excuses.

170
00:13:20,149 --> 00:13:21,901
Be at ease.

171
00:13:21,936 --> 00:13:23,519
Where is your brother?

172
00:13:23,554 --> 00:13:25,154
We no longer
trust our brother.

173
00:13:25,189 --> 00:13:26,655
What has he done?

174
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:29,909
Formed an attachment here
with one of the people.

175
00:13:29,944 --> 00:13:31,160
What kind of attachment?

176
00:13:31,195 --> 00:13:32,528
I'm not sure yet.

177
00:13:32,563 --> 00:13:35,531
He's with a young girl,
in spite of our orders.

178
00:13:35,566 --> 00:13:37,032
Proceed
without him.

179
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:39,285
We've been in touch
with all units.

180
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,670
The second wave has
landed successfully

181
00:13:41,705 --> 00:13:43,422
and is concealed as planned.

182
00:13:43,457 --> 00:13:45,424
With the landing
of the third wave

183
00:13:45,459 --> 00:13:48,677
we will be in key positions
throughout the country.

184
00:13:48,712 --> 00:13:49,678
Excellent.

185
00:13:49,713 --> 00:13:51,931
The people-
are they suspicious?

186
00:13:51,966 --> 00:13:53,182
Not a bit.

187
00:13:53,217 --> 00:13:56,185
They're a stupid race,
as our research told us.

188
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,187
An inferior breed
given to killing, hatred,

189
00:13:58,222 --> 00:14:00,940
making war, greed
and cruelty to one another.

190
00:14:00,975 --> 00:14:03,192
The universe can
well do without them.

191
00:14:03,227 --> 00:14:07,446
You will receive your
instructions for the final move

192
00:14:07,481 --> 00:14:10,065
in a few days.

193
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:24,129
Once again, your brother
has failed to report.

194
00:14:24,164 --> 00:14:25,881
He has ignored our orders.

195
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:28,133
He has spent
the past five days

196
00:14:28,168 --> 00:14:29,885
in the company
of the girl.

197
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,136
We have seen it.

198
00:14:31,171 --> 00:14:33,389
Now there is no other choice.

199
00:14:33,424 --> 00:14:35,140
Proceed without him.

200
00:14:35,175 --> 00:14:38,894
His fate is his own making.

201
00:14:43,899 --> 00:14:46,151
Where are you from, scott?

202
00:14:46,186 --> 00:14:47,903
Does it
really matter?

203
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:50,406
No, i don't suppose so.

204
00:14:50,441 --> 00:14:52,658
It's just that
you're so different

205
00:14:52,908 --> 00:14:55,160
from anybody else
i've ever known.

206
00:14:55,195 --> 00:14:56,662
Is that bad?

207
00:14:56,697 --> 00:14:58,664
No, not really.

208
00:14:58,699 --> 00:15:01,166
You like me,
don't you?

209
00:15:01,201 --> 00:15:03,669
Well, you know that, scott.

210
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:05,921
Very much?

211
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:07,423
Yes, very much.

212
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:10,542
Do you know the word...

213
00:15:10,793 --> 00:15:11,794
"love"?

214
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:13,796
Well, of course, silly.

215
00:15:13,831 --> 00:15:15,547
What an odd question.

216
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:16,932
What's odd about it?

217
00:15:16,967 --> 00:15:19,935
Don't you read your
newspapers, your magazines?

218
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:22,438
Listen to your television
programs? Your radio?

219
00:15:22,473 --> 00:15:23,689
We have.

220
00:15:23,724 --> 00:15:25,941
We? Scott, who is we?

221
00:15:25,976 --> 00:15:27,693
Well, that doesn't matter.

222
00:15:27,728 --> 00:15:30,195
Your planet is
filled with hate, ellen.

223
00:15:30,446 --> 00:15:31,447
Hate, violence,
mistrust.

224
00:15:31,482 --> 00:15:34,450
I don't see how anyone
as nice as you

225
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,201
has survived
this long.

226
00:15:36,236 --> 00:15:39,204
I'm certainly no
different from anybody else.

227
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:42,458
I haven't seen a single report
on anyone like you.

228
00:15:42,493 --> 00:15:43,709
Report?

229
00:15:43,744 --> 00:15:45,461
Scott, you talk in riddles.

230
00:15:45,496 --> 00:15:49,465
Sometimes you make me feel like
an insect under a microscope.

231
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,717
Please, i'd like to go home.

232
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:54,470
I'm very sorry

233
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,473
but i feel as though
you have been lying to me.

234
00:15:57,723 --> 00:16:01,226
I don't know why or what
it is you're trying to hide,

235
00:16:01,261 --> 00:16:03,729
but i know you're
not what you seem.

236
00:16:03,764 --> 00:16:05,230
What if i'm not?

237
00:16:05,265 --> 00:16:08,484
Do you think you're in
any position to judge me?

238
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:10,235
Any of you?

239
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,988
Please, i would
like to go home.

240
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:16,241
I'm sorry, ellen.

241
00:16:16,276 --> 00:16:18,243
It's my fault.

242
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:20,245
I expected too much.

243
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:27,252
I've done no harm.

244
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:29,505
I'm telling you the truth.

245
00:16:32,007 --> 00:16:34,760
What have you been doing
the last few days?

246
00:16:34,795 --> 00:16:37,763
Yesterday when i sent you
to the ship for food?

247
00:16:37,798 --> 00:16:41,016
Last night, when you were
supposed to be on guard?

248
00:16:41,051 --> 00:16:42,518
You think
i don't know?

249
00:16:42,553 --> 00:16:44,136
I've been watching you
every minute.

250
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:46,138
I told them before we came
you were too young.

251
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:47,389
Loose your head,

252
00:16:47,424 --> 00:16:49,391
you'd run into situations
you couldn't handle.

253
00:16:49,426 --> 00:16:52,394
I told you, i've done no harm.

254
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:54,396
Didn't tell her a thing?

255
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:55,898
No.

256
00:16:55,933 --> 00:16:57,900
You're not getting a chance to.

257
00:16:57,935 --> 00:16:59,902
We're too close
to finishing this mission.

258
00:17:02,538 --> 00:17:04,540
From here to the end,

259
00:17:04,575 --> 00:17:07,042
you're just along
for the ride.

260
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:25,427
Report.

261
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:28,180
Bacteria unit 59,
reporting in.

262
00:17:28,215 --> 00:17:30,182
The test has been
an unqualified success.

263
00:17:30,217 --> 00:17:31,567
Good.

264
00:17:31,602 --> 00:17:35,070
Units 70 through 100 have
reported the same results.

265
00:17:35,105 --> 00:17:37,823
What is your time estimate?

266
00:17:37,858 --> 00:17:39,691
30 minutes
to the reservoir.

267
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:40,943
Approximately 24 hours

268
00:17:40,978 --> 00:17:43,195
for the bacteria
to contaminate the water.

269
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:45,697
How soon before you see results?

270
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:48,450
Within 30 hours, we shall
witness 50% fatalities.

271
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:50,953
I'd estimate a total
of approximately 48 hours

272
00:17:50,988 --> 00:17:52,704
before
complete extermination.

273
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:55,707
Have you coordinated
with other units in your area?

274
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:57,593
We have.
There are 29 bacteria units

275
00:17:57,628 --> 00:17:59,845
covering water supplies
in this state.

276
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,846
We should easily reach

277
00:18:00,881 --> 00:18:03,348
complete population saturation
within two days.

278
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:04,716
Very well.

279
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:07,469
Begin operation invasion
phase two

280
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:09,354
at once.

281
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:13,108
Scott!

282
00:18:13,143 --> 00:18:15,110
It doesn't matter anymore.

283
00:18:29,992 --> 00:18:31,243
Scott...

284
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:33,245
come down, i've got to see you.

285
00:18:33,495 --> 00:18:34,880
It's so late.

286
00:18:34,915 --> 00:18:36,632
It's important.

287
00:18:38,634 --> 00:18:40,886
All right.

288
00:18:57,019 --> 00:18:58,020
Scott?

289
00:18:59,655 --> 00:19:02,157
You're making
a mistake, scott.

290
00:19:03,659 --> 00:19:05,661
These people
aren't worth it.

291
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,420
Scott?

292
00:19:17,673 --> 00:19:20,425
Ellen, you've got
to get away from here.

293
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,677
What do you mean?

294
00:19:21,712 --> 00:19:23,545
Get away, you're in danger.

295
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,430
I don't understand.

296
00:19:25,465 --> 00:19:28,684
Something terrible will happen,
many people will die.

297
00:19:28,719 --> 00:19:31,436
I'll take you someplace
where you'll be safe.

298
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:33,188
You're frightening me.

299
00:19:33,223 --> 00:19:34,690
What's going to happen?

300
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,058
I can't tell you that.

301
00:19:36,093 --> 00:19:37,559
It wouldn't matter if i did.

302
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:39,061
We have to leave right now.

303
00:19:39,096 --> 00:19:42,064
Are you frightening me
into running away with you?

304
00:19:42,099 --> 00:19:43,315
Listen to me!

305
00:19:43,565 --> 00:19:45,817
In 24 hours, every man, woman,
child, cat, dog,

306
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:47,569
everything alive
is going to be dead.

307
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:49,821
Oh, scott, don't, please.

308
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:51,206
Not just in this town.

309
00:19:51,241 --> 00:19:53,458
All over your country,
all over your world.

310
00:19:53,493 --> 00:19:54,459
My world?

311
00:19:54,494 --> 00:19:56,461
Scott, it's your world, too.

312
00:19:56,496 --> 00:19:59,214
No, it isn't.

313
00:19:59,249 --> 00:20:00,966
What do you...

314
00:20:01,001 --> 00:20:02,968
scott, who are you?

315
00:20:03,003 --> 00:20:05,220
We came from out there, ellen,

316
00:20:05,255 --> 00:20:06,972
from beyond those stars.

317
00:20:07,007 --> 00:20:10,092
There are thousands of
us on this planet now.

318
00:20:10,127 --> 00:20:13,095
We need space,
we've come to set up colonies.

319
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:15,981
Scott, you can't be serious.

320
00:20:16,016 --> 00:20:17,349
We have had bacteria units

321
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:19,601
in every country on this planet
for months.

322
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:22,604
Each unit has enough germs
to poison the drinking supply

323
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:24,356
of the entire world population.

324
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:27,359
I will walk with you
to your friends' house.

325
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:30,112
You had better let them
call you a doctor.

326
00:20:30,147 --> 00:20:32,364
No, you've got
to listen to me.

327
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:35,617
Scott, please, i love you,
but you're not well.

328
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:39,121
Ellen!

329
00:20:41,623 --> 00:20:44,626
All right, ellen,
what's this all about?

330
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:47,129
Oh, daddy, i don't
know what to do.

331
00:20:47,164 --> 00:20:50,132
Begin by telling
me what you were
doing outside.

332
00:20:50,167 --> 00:20:52,634
Scott said
he had to see me...

333
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:56,388
i think he's lost
his mind, he's never
been like this before.

334
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:57,639
He was almost raving.

335
00:20:57,674 --> 00:20:59,141
What did he say?

336
00:20:59,176 --> 00:21:00,392
Crazy things.

337
00:21:00,427 --> 00:21:03,895
He's a space man, they're
taking over the earth

338
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,897
and we're
all going to die.

339
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:07,649
We better get
him some help.

340
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,917
Deputy sheriff harper.

341
00:21:25,952 --> 00:21:28,170
No, sheriff holly's on vacation.

342
00:21:28,205 --> 00:21:29,921
This is his deputy.

343
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:32,057
Well, this is stuart tillman.

344
00:21:32,092 --> 00:21:34,059
I live at 11575 amanda drive.

345
00:21:34,094 --> 00:21:36,561
There's a young man
next door to me

346
00:21:36,596 --> 00:21:39,564
i think might be
a little mentally disturbed.

347
00:21:39,815 --> 00:21:41,817
I feel he
ought to be picked up

348
00:21:41,852 --> 00:21:44,820
before he can do harm
to himself or somebody else.

349
00:21:44,855 --> 00:21:47,072
What makes you think
he's mentally disturbed?

350
00:21:47,322 --> 00:21:51,193
He's been scaring my daughter
with man from mars stories.

351
00:21:51,228 --> 00:21:53,945
He claims he's part
of an invasion force

352
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:57,699
that's going to take over the
world or some such silly thing.

353
00:21:57,734 --> 00:22:00,702
All right, mr. Tillman,
i know exactly what to do.

354
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:02,204
Thank you for calling.

355
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:14,216
Yes?

356
00:22:14,251 --> 00:22:15,717
Please listen to me.

357
00:22:15,752 --> 00:22:16,718
You may speak.

358
00:22:16,753 --> 00:22:18,470
What we're doing is wrong.

359
00:22:18,505 --> 00:22:20,972
We should save these creatures,
not exterminate them.

360
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:22,724
It's true they murder
and hurt one another

361
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:25,477
and they're subject to
unreasonable hate and prejudice.

362
00:22:25,512 --> 00:22:28,230
But these are only the brutes,
and you find them in any race.

363
00:22:28,265 --> 00:22:30,482
Most of these people have
the capacity for love.

364
00:22:30,517 --> 00:22:31,733
I know it.

365
00:22:31,867 --> 00:22:33,869
Our research disproves that.

366
00:22:33,904 --> 00:22:38,123
They are a world of angry,
frightened people.

367
00:22:38,158 --> 00:22:39,991
No, i tell you,
they learn love from their god

368
00:22:40,242 --> 00:22:41,493
and teach it to their children.

369
00:22:41,528 --> 00:22:42,994
There's more of love here
than hate.

370
00:22:43,245 --> 00:22:44,496
There's no need to kill them.

371
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:46,131
It is too late.

372
00:22:46,248 --> 00:22:47,749
Not if you order them to stop.

373
00:22:47,784 --> 00:22:50,135
For you... a defector?

374
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:52,888
A traitor to your own people?

375
00:22:52,923 --> 00:22:54,139
No, i'm not.

376
00:22:54,174 --> 00:22:56,141
A traitor.

377
00:22:59,761 --> 00:23:00,762
Mr. Tillman?

378
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:01,763
Yes.

379
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:03,265
Deputy
sheriff harper.

380
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,267
Oh, won't
you come in?

381
00:23:05,302 --> 00:23:07,519
Martha, ellen!

382
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:12,524
This is my daughter,
ellen, and mrs. Tillman.

383
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:13,775
How do you do?

384
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:15,026
Hello.

385
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:17,028
Go ahead, tell
him, ellen.

386
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:18,280
I don't know...

387
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:21,283
your father said the boy
was mentally disturbed.

388
00:23:21,318 --> 00:23:23,034
How did you
decide that?

389
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:24,786
Well...

390
00:23:24,821 --> 00:23:27,038
ellen! Ellen!

391
00:23:29,791 --> 00:23:31,543
Ellen, there's no more time.

392
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:34,546
Come in, son.

393
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:39,301
Tell us all about it.

394
00:23:39,336 --> 00:23:40,802
Don't listen to him.

395
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:42,804
He's one of us, he's
with the advance units.

396
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:44,306
Advance units?

397
00:23:44,341 --> 00:23:47,058
What kind of
advance units, son?

398
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:49,060
They told me
you were ill, son

399
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:51,313
so i took the
necessary precautions.

400
00:23:51,348 --> 00:23:52,314
No...

401
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:54,816
no!

402
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:56,701
Don't fight them, son.

403
00:23:56,818 --> 00:23:59,821
It'll only make it more
difficult for all of us.

404
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:05,327
Don't worry, folks.

405
00:24:05,362 --> 00:24:07,329
We'll take good
care of him.

406
00:24:07,364 --> 00:24:09,831
Someday i'm sure
he'll thank you.

407
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:13,468
Portrait of an american family

408
00:24:13,503 --> 00:24:16,471
on the eve of invasion
from outer space.

409
00:24:16,506 --> 00:24:18,473
We know it's merely fiction.

410
00:24:18,508 --> 00:24:22,477
And yet, think twice when you
drink your next glass of water.

411
00:24:22,512 --> 00:24:24,980
Find out if it's
from your local reservoir

412
00:24:25,015 --> 00:24:26,481
or possibly it came
direct to you...

413
00:24:26,516 --> 00:24:28,733
from the twilight zone.

414
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:32,354
And now, mr. Serling.

415
00:24:32,389 --> 00:24:34,105
Next time out
onthe twilight zone,

416
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,357
richard matheson provides us

417
00:24:35,392 --> 00:24:37,859
with a tour de force
in suspense and the unexpected

418
00:24:37,894 --> 00:24:39,361
with a show called "night call."

419
00:24:39,396 --> 00:24:41,863
It stars one of the most
immanent actresses of our time,

420
00:24:41,898 --> 00:24:43,114
miss gladys cooper,

421
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:45,116
and it poses
the kind of question that arises

422
00:24:45,151 --> 00:24:48,119
when a telephone keeps ringing
and you realize that the caller

423
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:50,121
has not been on earth
for a number of years.

424
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:52,624
I hope this intrigues
because i think the show will.

425
00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:55,377
Next time out, "night call."
