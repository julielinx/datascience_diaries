1
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:12,879
You're traveling
through another dimension-

2
00:00:12,914 --> 00:00:16,016
a dimension not only of sight
and sound, but of mind,

3
00:00:16,051 --> 00:00:17,884
a journey into a wondrous land

4
00:00:17,919 --> 00:00:19,769
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

5
00:00:19,804 --> 00:00:22,889
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

6
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:31,147
Viva clemente!

7
00:00:31,182 --> 00:00:33,033
Viva clemente! Viva clemente!

8
00:00:33,068 --> 00:00:36,036
Viva! Viva!

9
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,541
You hear that?

10
00:00:41,576 --> 00:00:45,295
Do you hear that
"viva clemente, viva clemente

11
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:49,666
viva, viva, viva, viva,
viva, viva, viva, viva"?

12
00:00:49,701 --> 00:00:50,550
Viva
clemente!

13
00:00:50,585 --> 00:00:52,419
Viva!

14
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:58,174
To the revolution.

15
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:22,198
Ah, do you know...
do you know why i laugh?

16
00:01:22,233 --> 00:01:23,450
I laugh
because
there is

17
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:27,704
so much... so much stuff
bubbling inside of me,

18
00:01:27,739 --> 00:01:30,206
and i didn't know
in the beginning...

19
00:01:30,241 --> 00:01:33,960
i didn't know when
this moment would happen,

20
00:01:33,995 --> 00:01:37,097
how i would react to it,
what i would do-

21
00:01:37,132 --> 00:01:40,216
if i would drink or laugh
or get drunk or...

22
00:01:40,251 --> 00:01:42,102
i didn't know.

23
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:50,360
What makes a man drunk- wine,
or that mob screaming his name?

24
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:54,114
I'm going to make
a toast to you.

25
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:58,234
I'm going
to toast
my friends.

26
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,873
To cristo,
the bold one...

27
00:02:03,908 --> 00:02:06,376
to d'alessandro,
the dedicated one...

28
00:02:06,411 --> 00:02:09,496
to tabal,
the quiet one...

29
00:02:09,531 --> 00:02:13,249
to garcia,
the strong one.

30
00:02:13,284 --> 00:02:16,753
To the four
lieutenants of
the revolution.

31
00:02:16,788 --> 00:02:20,507
To the new heads
of the government.

32
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,027
All right,
bring him in.

33
00:02:41,062 --> 00:02:42,912
We'll start
with that.

34
00:02:45,281 --> 00:02:47,784
This is the face
of ramos clemente,

35
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:50,920
a year ago, a beardless,
nameless worker of the dirt

36
00:02:50,955 --> 00:02:55,175
who plodded behind a mule,
furrowing someone else's land.

37
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:57,677
And he looked up
at a hot central american sun

38
00:02:58,294 --> 00:03:00,180
and he pledged the impossible:

39
00:03:00,215 --> 00:03:02,048
He made a vow that
he would lead an avenging army

40
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:05,802
against the tyranny
that put the ache in his back

41
00:03:05,837 --> 00:03:07,053
and the anguish in his eyes.

42
00:03:07,088 --> 00:03:08,304
And now, one year later,

43
00:03:08,339 --> 00:03:11,441
the dream of the impossible
has become a fact.

44
00:03:11,476 --> 00:03:14,561
In just a moment, we will
look deep into this mirror

45
00:03:14,596 --> 00:03:17,063
and see the aftermath
of a rebellion...

46
00:03:17,098 --> 00:03:18,948
in the twilight zone.

47
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:47,393
You
disappoint me.

48
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:51,764
You recognize
that man?

49
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:54,901
That one- the
one in the picture.

50
00:03:54,936 --> 00:03:57,403
Arrogance
in full braid.

51
00:03:57,438 --> 00:03:58,655
What is he now?

52
00:03:58,690 --> 00:03:59,906
Hey.

53
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:02,408
Hey...

54
00:04:02,443 --> 00:04:04,277
what is he know?

55
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:08,665
He's an old man
in a dirty uniform.

56
00:04:10,533 --> 00:04:13,036
What is it you want
with me, clemente?

57
00:04:13,071 --> 00:04:14,921
Not what i want...

58
00:04:14,956 --> 00:04:17,423
not what i want.

59
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:21,177
Not whatiwant!

60
00:04:21,212 --> 00:04:23,046
Whattheywant!

61
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:27,684
Notwhat i want,
whattheywant!

62
00:04:27,719 --> 00:04:29,552
Whattheywant!

63
00:04:31,089 --> 00:04:32,305
Whattheywant!

64
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,190
But i'm not going
to place you

65
00:04:34,225 --> 00:04:35,441
against the wall.

66
00:04:35,476 --> 00:04:38,561
No, no, that's a cheap
death for underlings.

67
00:04:38,596 --> 00:04:40,446
The firing squad
is for followers!

68
00:04:40,481 --> 00:04:41,698
Not for leaders!

69
00:04:41,733 --> 00:04:44,817
No, no, general. You're
too good. Too good.

70
00:04:44,852 --> 00:04:47,320
For you, i'm going
to strip you naked

71
00:04:47,355 --> 00:04:48,571
and cover you
with honey.

72
00:04:48,606 --> 00:04:52,325
Then i'm going to tie
you to the ground
under a hot sun,

73
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,827
and then i'm going
to let the ants at you.

74
00:04:54,862 --> 00:04:56,713
And, every time
that you scream,

75
00:04:56,748 --> 00:04:58,581
i'm going
to drink wine.

76
00:04:58,616 --> 00:05:00,466
And every time that
you pray for mercy,

77
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:02,335
i'm going to
laugh out loud.

78
00:05:03,586 --> 00:05:07,974
Because i want you to take
a long time to die, de cruz.

79
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:11,094
One part death for every
acre of land you stole,

80
00:05:11,129 --> 00:05:12,979
then one part death

81
00:05:13,014 --> 00:05:16,733
for every morsel you took
out of a peasant's mouth,

82
00:05:16,768 --> 00:05:18,601
and one part death

83
00:05:18,636 --> 00:05:21,738
for every voice that
you stifled by decree.

84
00:05:21,773 --> 00:05:23,606
I will not oblige
you, clemente,

85
00:05:23,641 --> 00:05:25,491
with a cry or a plea.

86
00:05:25,526 --> 00:05:26,993
You can strip off my flesh

87
00:05:27,028 --> 00:05:30,113
because it is there for you,
and easily done.

88
00:05:30,148 --> 00:05:31,364
But my manhood...

89
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:35,752
my manhood,
you greasy little peon,

90
00:05:35,787 --> 00:05:39,505
this... this is as far
from you as the moon.

91
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:43,259
Greasy peon, eh?

92
00:05:43,294 --> 00:05:44,377
Greasy...

93
00:05:44,412 --> 00:05:48,131
he's to be judged,
not tormented.

94
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:50,016
Heis the animal.

95
00:05:50,051 --> 00:05:51,884
And you
are not, eh?

96
00:05:53,805 --> 00:05:57,523
You are the
purists, hmm?

97
00:05:57,558 --> 00:06:01,394
The saviors, the
avenging angels, eh?

98
00:06:02,645 --> 00:06:07,650
Gentlemen... you will
soon be disillusioned.

99
00:06:07,685 --> 00:06:10,153
You are me.

100
00:06:10,188 --> 00:06:13,289
You are de cruz.

101
00:06:13,324 --> 00:06:15,792
You are battista, you are
castro, you are trujillo.

102
00:06:15,827 --> 00:06:19,162
You are the keepers
of the grab bags.

103
00:06:19,197 --> 00:06:20,413
Oh, you can
wave your flags

104
00:06:20,448 --> 00:06:22,298
and put up
your statues

105
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:23,549
and embrace
all the people,

106
00:06:24,167 --> 00:06:27,303
the oldest and
the youngest, but...

107
00:06:27,338 --> 00:06:32,308
we are all
the same breed.

108
00:06:32,343 --> 00:06:34,811
We are the spoilers.

109
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:38,181
We care
for no one...

110
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:41,934
no one
but ourselves.

111
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:48,825
He presents
his case,

112
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,693
and we are his
best witnesses.

113
00:06:50,728 --> 00:06:53,329
We corroborate
everything he says.

114
00:06:55,198 --> 00:06:58,951
You cannot help
but do it.

115
00:06:58,986 --> 00:07:01,454
You think this room...

116
00:07:01,489 --> 00:07:03,956
the people out there...

117
00:07:03,991 --> 00:07:08,961
you think these are
the fruits of victory?

118
00:07:08,996 --> 00:07:11,464
The spoils.

119
00:07:11,499 --> 00:07:14,600
They are simply
a legacy, clemente-

120
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:16,469
what i pass on to you.

121
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:19,355
Power you shall have,
general clemente.

122
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:22,475
Certainly power,
enough to make you giddy.

123
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:26,229
But there are other things
in the inheritance,

124
00:07:26,264 --> 00:07:28,731
and you'll find them
soon enough:

125
00:07:28,766 --> 00:07:31,117
Fear...

126
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:35,488
fear.

127
00:07:35,523 --> 00:07:36,739
The chief legacy.

128
00:07:39,242 --> 00:07:42,378
Fear of
assassination...

129
00:07:42,413 --> 00:07:44,247
fear of disloyalty,

130
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:47,383
fear of rebellion,
fear of a...

131
00:07:47,418 --> 00:07:49,886
another clemente
hiding in the hills.

132
00:07:51,754 --> 00:07:54,257
God help you.

133
00:07:54,292 --> 00:07:56,142
God pity you.

134
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,145
Take him out,
now!

135
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:05,401
I see you have
found my mirror, too.

136
00:08:05,436 --> 00:08:07,270
An old woman
brought it to me

137
00:08:07,305 --> 00:08:10,406
ten years ago, when
i'd first taken over.

138
00:08:10,441 --> 00:08:12,275
She said it was magic.

139
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:14,160
She said,
by looking into it,

140
00:08:14,195 --> 00:08:17,280
i could see the faces
of my assassins.

141
00:08:20,701 --> 00:08:22,535
Maybe she's right.

142
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:25,671
Look deep,
general clemente.

143
00:08:25,706 --> 00:08:27,540
Find out who
your assassins are.

144
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,676
You will see them
in that mirror.

145
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:35,047
You will see them in the mirror.
In the dark corners.

146
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:39,435
You will see them
in the crowd.

147
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:41,938
You will see them everywhere.

148
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,954
Cristo, how many
prisoners are there?

149
00:08:57,989 --> 00:09:00,456
Here in the capital?
Well, a thousand.

150
00:09:00,491 --> 00:09:02,325
Have them shot
immediately.

151
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,576
But... the trials.

152
00:09:03,611 --> 00:09:05,461
We don't have
time for trials.

153
00:09:05,496 --> 00:09:07,463
But for murder
there is plenty of time,

154
00:09:07,498 --> 00:09:08,714
hmm?

155
00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:11,217
What are you,
some kind of a chameleon?

156
00:09:11,252 --> 00:09:14,971
What is this ease with
which you strip off one color

157
00:09:15,006 --> 00:09:16,222
and put on
another?

158
00:09:16,257 --> 00:09:17,473
You turn
my stomach.

159
00:09:17,508 --> 00:09:20,593
Murderers can never be murdered.

160
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,095
Murderers can only be executed!

161
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:26,732
Cristo...

162
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:29,235
take tabal
and garcia.

163
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:31,103
Carry out
that order.

164
00:09:31,138 --> 00:09:32,355
Gladly.

165
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:56,762
A mirror that reflects
the faces of my assassins.

166
00:09:56,797 --> 00:09:59,882
Isn't that intriguing?

167
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:04,770
Isn't that
intriguing,
d'alessandro?

168
00:10:04,805 --> 00:10:07,523
You know, i had no idea
that some...

169
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:17,533
you!

170
00:10:17,568 --> 00:10:19,402
It was you!

171
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:21,287
It was you.

172
00:10:21,322 --> 00:10:22,538
Ramos...

173
00:10:22,573 --> 00:10:23,155
i saw you.

174
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:25,041
Ramos, what's
the matter?

175
00:10:25,076 --> 00:10:27,543
I saw you in the
mirror, with a gun.

176
00:10:27,578 --> 00:10:28,160
What gun?

177
00:10:28,195 --> 00:10:30,663
You sound like
some demented man.

178
00:10:30,698 --> 00:10:31,914
I would have to be you.

179
00:10:31,949 --> 00:10:34,417
I should have known
that it would be you,

180
00:10:34,452 --> 00:10:36,302
you moralist,
you dedicated one.

181
00:10:36,337 --> 00:10:38,170
It would have
to be you.

182
00:10:38,205 --> 00:10:39,422
I knew!

183
00:11:09,487 --> 00:11:11,337
Why are they so quiet?

184
00:11:11,372 --> 00:11:12,588
They scream for justice

185
00:11:12,623 --> 00:11:15,091
and, when you
give it to them,

186
00:11:15,126 --> 00:11:16,959
they're suddenly bored,

187
00:11:16,994 --> 00:11:19,462
like an audience
at a cheap burlesque.

188
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,964
The entertainment
must be varied.

189
00:11:21,999 --> 00:11:25,101
Every five minutes,
must be a costume change.

190
00:11:25,136 --> 00:11:26,969
But i know them very well.

191
00:11:27,004 --> 00:11:30,723
You fill their stomachs,
and you empty their brains.

192
00:11:30,758 --> 00:11:33,109
They have cheap tastes
and short memories.

193
00:11:33,144 --> 00:11:35,611
What's the matter, tabal?

194
00:11:35,646 --> 00:11:38,731
Is there something
that's sitting heavy on you?

195
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:45,621
That.

196
00:11:45,656 --> 00:11:48,124
That sits heavy on me.

197
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,628
That is what sits heavy on me!

198
00:11:52,663 --> 00:11:55,131
And the death of a man
who was my friend.

199
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:57,633
That puts a hook
into my heart.

200
00:11:57,668 --> 00:11:59,502
D'alessandro...

201
00:11:59,537 --> 00:12:00,753
an assassin.

202
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,255
And that is
the worst lie of all!

203
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:07,009
That was a lie, ramos.

204
00:12:07,044 --> 00:12:09,512
He was no assassin.

205
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:13,649
What's the matter?

206
00:12:13,684 --> 00:12:15,518
What's going on?

207
00:12:17,438 --> 00:12:21,774
Oh. Still at it, huh?

208
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,030
Leave it be, ramos.

209
00:12:28,065 --> 00:12:30,533
You can talk yourself
into an illusion.

210
00:12:30,568 --> 00:12:33,035
You can make yourself
believe anything.

211
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,319
What is it, ramos?

212
00:13:07,354 --> 00:13:08,571
Well...

213
00:13:08,606 --> 00:13:09,822
what is it?
The mirror
again?

214
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,707
No, no.

215
00:13:11,742 --> 00:13:14,210
You think you
saw something
in the mirror?

216
00:13:14,245 --> 00:13:17,079
No, no. No, i'm concerned
about de cruz.

217
00:13:17,114 --> 00:13:18,964
I'm worried
about de cruz.

218
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:20,216
Tabal,
take garcia.

219
00:13:20,251 --> 00:13:21,467
Go over to
the prison.

220
00:13:21,502 --> 00:13:23,335
Take a look
at de cruz

221
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:24,587
and report
back to me.

222
00:13:24,622 --> 00:13:27,089
Report back to you what?

223
00:13:27,124 --> 00:13:28,340
About his health?

224
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:32,094
I'm concerned whether
he's being properly guarded.

225
00:13:34,597 --> 00:13:35,848
Yes, sir.

226
00:13:35,883 --> 00:13:37,733
Do you have a message
for de cruz?

227
00:13:37,768 --> 00:13:40,853
Should we tell him
that he was right
about the fears?

228
00:13:40,888 --> 00:13:43,355
That there are
assassins under the bed,

229
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:45,858
in the shadows,
and all around
the room?

230
00:13:45,893 --> 00:13:47,743
Tabal...

231
00:13:47,778 --> 00:13:50,863
you have your freedom
and you have your life,

232
00:13:50,898 --> 00:13:53,999
but you have them both
on my sufferance.

233
00:13:54,034 --> 00:13:55,868
Don't throw them away.

234
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:59,004
Yes, general.

235
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,632
Hello?

236
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:12,768
Hello? Hello?

237
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:14,637
What are you doing,
sleeping?

238
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,522
This is general clemente.

239
00:14:16,557 --> 00:14:18,390
That's correct.

240
00:14:18,425 --> 00:14:20,276
This is urgent.

241
00:14:20,311 --> 00:14:21,527
I want the prison.

242
00:14:21,562 --> 00:14:24,647
No, i want the front gate,
not the office.

243
00:14:24,682 --> 00:14:25,898
That's right.

244
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:29,652
This is general clemente.

245
00:14:29,687 --> 00:14:33,405
In a few moments, two men
are going to arrive there-

246
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,542
spies- and they are
to be shot on sight.

247
00:14:36,577 --> 00:14:40,296
Their names are
tabal and garcia.

248
00:14:40,331 --> 00:14:42,164
I know who they are!

249
00:14:42,199 --> 00:14:43,415
And i knowwhatthey are!

250
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,918
And they are to be shot!

251
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,923
That's right.

252
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:53,425
You let me know
when it's done.

253
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,435
Cristo...

254
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,938
sir?

255
00:15:05,973 --> 00:15:07,823
Any complaints?

256
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:12,194
None.

257
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:15,331
None, eh?

258
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:19,084
Why should there be?

259
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:22,838
A pie cut into
two pieces

260
00:15:22,873 --> 00:15:25,958
is better than
a pie cut in five.

261
00:15:25,993 --> 00:15:28,460
Pie... pie...

262
00:15:28,495 --> 00:15:29,712
this is no pie.

263
00:15:29,747 --> 00:15:31,597
These are the
lives of friends.

264
00:15:31,632 --> 00:15:34,099
They were... they
were very close.

265
00:15:34,134 --> 00:15:35,968
We were very close.
You know that.

266
00:15:36,003 --> 00:15:37,853
We were like brothers.

267
00:15:37,888 --> 00:15:39,722
See, that's what
i don't understand-

268
00:15:39,757 --> 00:15:41,607
i don't understand
how it is

269
00:15:41,642 --> 00:15:42,858
that i could
crush them out,

270
00:15:42,893 --> 00:15:44,727
and i don't
think about it,

271
00:15:44,762 --> 00:15:46,612
i don't feel it.
I just crush them.

272
00:15:46,647 --> 00:15:50,366
Men cannot be brothers
in these settings.

273
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:55,371
You must expect this
from now on.

274
00:15:57,873 --> 00:16:00,993
When a man
has power,

275
00:16:01,028 --> 00:16:02,878
he has enemies,

276
00:16:02,913 --> 00:16:04,747
and now you
have enemies.

277
00:16:04,782 --> 00:16:07,249
Enemies, yes,
i understand that,

278
00:16:07,284 --> 00:16:09,134
but must my friends
be my enemies?

279
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:16,642
From now on, ramos,
you have no friends.

280
00:16:16,677 --> 00:16:19,762
You have followers
and you have competitors.

281
00:16:19,797 --> 00:16:22,264
That is the breakdown
of the world now.

282
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,768
You must live
with it.

283
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:36,412
How do you classify
yourself, cristo?

284
00:16:36,447 --> 00:16:38,914
Myself?

285
00:16:38,949 --> 00:16:41,417
I am a follower,
general.

286
00:16:41,452 --> 00:16:43,285
A follower...

287
00:16:45,788 --> 00:16:47,039
for how long?

288
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:48,424
How long?

289
00:16:48,459 --> 00:16:49,925
How long will you be a follower?

290
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,794
Until some quiet moment
when my back is turned?

291
00:16:51,829 --> 00:16:54,046
No...

292
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:59,051
only until that moment

293
00:16:59,086 --> 00:17:04,056
when you prove to me
that you cannot lead.

294
00:17:04,091 --> 00:17:08,444
Only until that moment
when i think perhaps...

295
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:10,312
perhaps what?

296
00:17:10,347 --> 00:17:14,066
Perhaps i am stronger than you.

297
00:17:14,101 --> 00:17:18,954
You'll be eaten by worms
before that moment comes.

298
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:28,213
What is it?

299
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:39,842
Take a drink of wine.

300
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:43,979
It will make you
feel better.

301
00:17:44,014 --> 00:17:45,230
That's right.

302
00:17:45,848 --> 00:17:47,733
That's right.
Have a glass of wine.

303
00:17:47,768 --> 00:17:48,984
I'll feel better.

304
00:17:49,019 --> 00:17:51,487
Well, go ahead.
Have a glass of wine.

305
00:17:51,522 --> 00:17:53,355
It will make you
sleep better.

306
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:55,858
Yes, it would make me
sleep better, wouldn't it?

307
00:17:55,893 --> 00:17:57,109
For how long?

308
00:17:57,144 --> 00:17:59,611
For how long will
it make me sleep?

309
00:17:59,646 --> 00:18:02,114
Maybe for all
eternity, eh?

310
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:07,870
You are demented.

311
00:18:07,905 --> 00:18:09,755
You've gone crazy.

312
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,006
Why did
you do that?

313
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:12,257
Because i'm crazy.

314
00:18:12,292 --> 00:18:15,377
And because
i'm allergic to poison.

315
00:18:15,412 --> 00:18:18,630
I also have
a yen to live.

316
00:18:32,394 --> 00:18:34,279
Yes?

317
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:38,033
Yes, he's here.

318
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:42,404
When?

319
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,792
All right.
I will tell him.

320
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:55,551
That was the gatehouse
of the prison.

321
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:59,421
The guards have shot
tabal and garcia.

322
00:18:59,456 --> 00:19:01,924
They are both dead.

323
00:19:01,959 --> 00:19:03,809
And what shall we do now,
cristo?

324
00:19:03,844 --> 00:19:05,060
Shall we mourn for them?

325
00:19:05,095 --> 00:19:07,563
They were our friends,
weren't they?

326
00:19:07,598 --> 00:19:10,065
But, then again,
they can't be our friends

327
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:13,185
because they can't be friends
andassassins.

328
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,436
They cannot be both.

329
00:19:14,471 --> 00:19:16,939
That was your point,
wasn't it, eh?

330
00:19:24,114 --> 00:19:25,948
Ramos!

331
00:19:26,949 --> 00:19:30,702
There was no poison
in that wine.

332
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,959
I had nothing
like that in mind.

333
00:19:36,994 --> 00:19:38,210
Nothing
of the sort.

334
00:19:38,245 --> 00:19:41,346
You are imagining things.

335
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:44,967
Look! I'll show you.

336
00:19:47,469 --> 00:19:49,972
It's an illusion, you see?

337
00:19:50,007 --> 00:19:51,223
It's just a mirror.

338
00:19:51,258 --> 00:19:54,359
An ordinary
mirror.

339
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:58,113
But it's glass, you see?
Just glass!

340
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:09,241
Now you will be all alone.

341
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:15,497
Now i'm afraid...

342
00:20:15,532 --> 00:20:18,000
you'll be
very lonely.

343
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:28,010
But you have just killed
a better man,

344
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,145
ramos.

345
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:04,046
General clemente.

346
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:09,051
I am father tomas.

347
00:21:14,056 --> 00:21:15,941
Yes?

348
00:21:15,976 --> 00:21:18,443
You will forgive
me, general,

349
00:21:18,478 --> 00:21:20,946
but this must
be said now.

350
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:24,700
What must be said?

351
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:31,456
The executions- they have
been going on now for a week.

352
00:21:31,491 --> 00:21:34,576
The people are appalled.

353
00:21:34,611 --> 00:21:38,330
Is this what we are to expect
from the new regime?

354
00:21:38,365 --> 00:21:40,582
I have enemies, father.
I have enemies.

355
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:44,970
And, as long as i have enemies,
the executions will continue.

356
00:21:45,005 --> 00:21:48,090
They'll continue 24 hours
a day, seven days a week.

357
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,592
And, if that disturbs
the people,

358
00:21:50,627 --> 00:21:52,477
well, then, if that's...

359
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:54,980
then what?

360
00:21:56,848 --> 00:21:58,734
Then let them do
something about it.

361
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:00,602
Let them go in the caves.

362
00:22:00,637 --> 00:22:02,487
Let them starve for a year!

363
00:22:02,522 --> 00:22:04,990
Let them raise
an army like i did!

364
00:22:05,025 --> 00:22:06,858
I don't care what they do!

365
00:22:06,893 --> 00:22:08,610
General clemente,

366
00:22:08,645 --> 00:22:12,998
the victory is not
so sweet, is it?

367
00:22:13,033 --> 00:22:16,752
Instead of the flavor of wine,
it's the taste

368
00:22:16,787 --> 00:22:18,120
of ashes.

369
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,257
Father...

370
00:22:24,626 --> 00:22:26,511
i can't stand it.

371
00:22:26,546 --> 00:22:28,380
I can't live like this.

372
00:22:28,415 --> 00:22:30,265
I'm frightened.

373
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:33,385
From morning till night,
from night till morning,

374
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:36,521
i hold my breath
and i keep looking in back of me

375
00:22:36,556 --> 00:22:38,390
to see if there is something.

376
00:22:38,425 --> 00:22:41,526
I want to know, why do
i have so many enemies?

377
00:22:41,893 --> 00:22:46,898
It is the story
of all tyrants, general.

378
00:22:46,933 --> 00:22:51,286
They have but one real enemy,

379
00:22:51,321 --> 00:22:56,291
and this is the one
they never recognize...

380
00:22:56,326 --> 00:22:58,160
until too late.

381
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,921
God help you.

382
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,954
The last assassin.

383
00:23:42,989 --> 00:23:46,091
And they never learn.

384
00:23:46,126 --> 00:23:50,462
They never seem to learn.

385
00:23:50,497 --> 00:23:53,348
Ramos clemente,
a would-be god in dungarees

386
00:23:53,383 --> 00:23:55,217
strangled by an illusion-

387
00:23:55,252 --> 00:23:58,970
that will-o'-the-wisp mirage
that dangles from the sky

388
00:23:59,005 --> 00:24:02,724
in front of the eyes of
all ambitious men, all tyrants.

389
00:24:02,759 --> 00:24:05,861
And any resemblance
to tyrants living or dead

390
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:07,729
is hardly coincidental,

391
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:10,866
whether it be here
or in the twilight zone.

392
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:17,456
Rod serling,
creator ofthe twilight zone,

393
00:24:17,491 --> 00:24:19,324
will tell you
about next week's story

394
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:23,645
after this word
from our alternate sponsor.

395
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,713
And now, mr. Serling.

396
00:24:24,748 --> 00:24:27,833
It's traditional
in the great american western

397
00:24:27,868 --> 00:24:29,718
the climax of any given story

398
00:24:29,753 --> 00:24:31,586
is the gun down
on the main street.

399
00:24:31,621 --> 00:24:33,472
Next week, montgomery pittman
has written a story

400
00:24:33,507 --> 00:24:36,591
in which we have our gun down,
and then go on from there.

401
00:24:36,626 --> 00:24:37,843
It's a haunting little item

402
00:24:37,878 --> 00:24:39,728
about a top gun as he was alive,

403
00:24:39,763 --> 00:24:42,230
and his operation after death.

404
00:24:42,265 --> 00:24:44,733
This is one for rainy nights
and power failures.

405
00:24:44,768 --> 00:24:45,984
But, wherever you watch it,

406
00:24:46,019 --> 00:24:47,853
i think
it will leave its imprint.

407
00:25:17,299 --> 00:25:19,384
There's an economic
upswing coming.

408
00:25:19,419 --> 00:25:21,136
How will it affect you?

409
00:25:21,171 --> 00:25:23,021
