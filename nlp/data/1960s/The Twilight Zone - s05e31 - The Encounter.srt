1
00:00:06,606 --> 00:00:09,726
You unlock this door
with the key of imagination.

2
00:00:09,761 --> 00:00:11,611
Beyond it is another dimension-

3
00:00:11,646 --> 00:00:12,862
a dimension of sound,

4
00:00:14,149 --> 00:00:15,982
a dimension of sight,

5
00:00:16,017 --> 00:00:17,867
a dimension of mind.

6
00:00:17,902 --> 00:00:20,987
You're moving into a land
of both shadow and substance,

7
00:00:21,022 --> 00:00:22,872
of things and ideas.

8
00:00:22,907 --> 00:00:27,877
You've just crossed over
into the twilight zone.

9
00:01:15,425 --> 00:01:16,676
Hello?

10
00:01:16,711 --> 00:01:17,927
Anybody home?

11
00:01:17,962 --> 00:01:19,796
Yeah.

12
00:01:19,831 --> 00:01:21,681
Mr. Fenton?

13
00:01:21,716 --> 00:01:23,550
Yeah, that's right.

14
00:01:23,585 --> 00:01:26,052
Mrs. Boles down the
street sent me over.

15
00:01:26,087 --> 00:01:27,937
She said you wanted someone
to take care of your lawn?

16
00:01:27,972 --> 00:01:30,440
I rang the doorbell,
but nobody answered.

17
00:01:30,475 --> 00:01:31,558
Then i heard your radio.

18
00:01:31,593 --> 00:01:33,443
The front door was wide open.

19
00:01:33,478 --> 00:01:35,195
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's right.
Come on up.

20
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:37,697
If it's just the front
you want taken care of,

21
00:01:38,314 --> 00:01:40,817
i can handle it for,
oh, seven bucks a month.

22
00:01:40,852 --> 00:01:43,319
That sounds fair enough.

23
00:01:43,354 --> 00:01:46,456
I'll come every wednesday
if it's convenient.

24
00:01:46,491 --> 00:01:47,707
Sold.

25
00:01:47,742 --> 00:01:48,958
Great, well, thanks
a lot, mr. Fenton.

26
00:01:48,993 --> 00:01:49,576
So long.
No, wait a minute.

27
00:01:49,611 --> 00:01:50,827
Come on up.

28
00:01:50,862 --> 00:01:52,712
We'll sit down
and have a beer on it.

29
00:01:52,747 --> 00:01:54,464
No, thanks just the same.

30
00:01:54,499 --> 00:01:56,332
No, i mean it.
I've got plenty on ice.

31
00:01:56,367 --> 00:01:58,218
Anyway, you can make
a small fortune up here

32
00:01:58,835 --> 00:02:00,086
helping me clean out
some of this junk.

33
00:02:00,121 --> 00:02:01,971
How about it?

34
00:02:02,006 --> 00:02:04,474
Well, ten minutes.

35
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:08,845
What did you say
your name is, boy?

36
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,730
Arthur. Arthur takamuri.

37
00:02:10,765 --> 00:02:12,599
Arthur?
That's right.

38
00:02:12,634 --> 00:02:13,850
Well, that's funny.

39
00:02:13,885 --> 00:02:15,101
What is?

40
00:02:15,136 --> 00:02:16,352
Why arthur?

41
00:02:16,387 --> 00:02:18,238
Why not?

42
00:02:18,273 --> 00:02:19,489
I was born in
this country.

43
00:02:19,524 --> 00:02:21,357
Sure. I didn't
mean anything.

44
00:02:21,392 --> 00:02:23,860
I'm just as much american
as anybody, you know.

45
00:02:23,895 --> 00:02:25,111
Well, now, who
said you're not?

46
00:02:25,146 --> 00:02:27,614
You're too
darn sensitive.

47
00:02:27,649 --> 00:02:29,499
Yeah, i guess i am.

48
00:02:29,534 --> 00:02:32,001
Truth is, my name is taro.

49
00:02:32,036 --> 00:02:33,870
I changed it.

50
00:02:33,905 --> 00:02:37,624
A rose is a rose,
you get what i mean?

51
00:02:37,659 --> 00:02:39,509
No.

52
00:02:39,544 --> 00:02:41,377
Oh, what a mess.

53
00:02:41,412 --> 00:02:43,263
This attic's been
like this for 20 years.

54
00:02:43,298 --> 00:02:45,765
Knee-deep in junk.

55
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,885
I found some stuff i haven't
even seen since the war.

56
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,136
Hey, get a load of
this, will you?

57
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,273
Can you imagine
i once got into it?

58
00:02:53,308 --> 00:02:54,524
Sure, why not?

59
00:02:54,559 --> 00:02:57,026
Yeah, you're just
being polite.

60
00:02:57,061 --> 00:02:59,529
I'm a tub of
rancid lard now,

61
00:02:59,564 --> 00:03:01,397
but i was pretty
tough once.

62
00:03:01,432 --> 00:03:04,534
I went all through
saipan and okinawa.

63
00:03:04,569 --> 00:03:06,402
Yeah.

64
00:03:06,437 --> 00:03:08,905
Check my fruit salad.
Crazy, huh?

65
00:03:15,044 --> 00:03:17,547
You ever see one of these?

66
00:03:17,582 --> 00:03:20,049
Yeah.

67
00:03:20,084 --> 00:03:22,552
It's a genuine
samurai sword.

68
00:03:23,052 --> 00:03:25,555
Not a fake
like most you see around.

69
00:03:27,056 --> 00:03:30,310
I took it off a jap officer
who tried to cut off my noggin.

70
00:03:30,345 --> 00:03:32,562
There's something
engraved on it.

71
00:03:32,597 --> 00:03:35,064
Maybe you can
translate it for me.

72
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:36,933
Sorry, i can't speak any
language but english.

73
00:03:36,968 --> 00:03:38,818
Oh, come on, boy.

74
00:03:38,853 --> 00:03:42,572
My mother spoke japanese,
but me, i never learned.

75
00:03:42,607 --> 00:03:45,074
You said you wanted me to help
you clean up this junk.

76
00:03:45,109 --> 00:03:46,326
Oh, yeah.

77
00:03:46,361 --> 00:03:47,327
Yeah, that's right.

78
00:03:47,944 --> 00:03:49,195
But first i've got to get
a couple of beers.

79
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,080
My throat's full of dust.

80
00:03:51,115 --> 00:03:52,949
Throw anything you want
on the floor and sit down.

81
00:03:52,984 --> 00:03:55,451
Be back in a jiffy.

82
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:15,471
I'm going to kill him.

83
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:20,476
I'm going to kill him.

84
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:26,115
Why?

85
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:28,618
Two men alone in an attic;

86
00:04:28,653 --> 00:04:31,120
a young japanese-american

87
00:04:31,155 --> 00:04:34,741
and a seasoned veteran
of yesterday's war.

88
00:04:34,776 --> 00:04:37,243
It's 20 odd years
since pearl harbor,

89
00:04:37,278 --> 00:04:40,380
but two ancient opponents
are moving into position

90
00:04:40,415 --> 00:04:43,499
for a battle in an attic
crammed with skeletons-

91
00:04:43,534 --> 00:04:47,887
souvenirs, mementos,
old uniforms and rusted metals-

92
00:04:47,922 --> 00:04:50,390
ghosts from the dim reaches
of the past

93
00:04:50,425 --> 00:04:54,143
that will lead us
into the twilight zone.

94
00:05:16,234 --> 00:05:19,335
Well, here we are,
nice and cold.

95
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:23,706
You partial to beer, carl?

96
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:25,591
The name's arthur.

97
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:26,843
Oh, yeah, yeah,
i forgot.

98
00:05:26,878 --> 00:05:28,094
It's just that, uh...

99
00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:30,596
well, you don't look
like an arthur to me.

100
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:33,716
You don't look like
a soldier, either.

101
00:05:33,751 --> 00:05:35,601
Well, you got me there, boy.

102
00:05:35,636 --> 00:05:38,104
And while we're
at it, mr. Fenton,

103
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:39,972
i get bugged by "boy."

104
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:43,109
Europeans are always
calling the natives "boy,"

105
00:05:43,144 --> 00:05:44,977
and moaning about the
white man's burden.

106
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:46,863
Well, the facts are,

107
00:05:46,898 --> 00:05:48,731
i'm a full-grown man.
I work for a living,

108
00:05:48,766 --> 00:05:51,234
and i answer to arthur,
takamuri,

109
00:05:51,269 --> 00:05:54,987
and believe it or not,
sometimes to mr. Takamuri.

110
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:58,124
Oh, brother,
are you wound up.

111
00:05:58,159 --> 00:06:01,244
You do this every time a
guy offers you a beer?

112
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:03,746
Now here, take it. Go on.

113
00:06:03,781 --> 00:06:06,249
I'm sorry.

114
00:06:06,284 --> 00:06:08,751
I guess i got
a headache from the sun.

115
00:06:08,786 --> 00:06:10,002
Ah, forget it, forget it.

116
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:11,888
The war's over.

117
00:06:11,923 --> 00:06:14,390
But in case you
don't know it,

118
00:06:14,425 --> 00:06:17,510
there ain't a service man
who saw combat in the pacific

119
00:06:17,545 --> 00:06:19,395
who doesn't
respect the japanese.

120
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:22,515
They fought like tigers,

121
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:25,768
and it was rare you could
take them without killing 'em.

122
00:06:25,803 --> 00:06:27,653
Bonzai.

123
00:06:27,688 --> 00:06:29,522
Okay.

124
00:06:29,557 --> 00:06:31,407
Bonzai.

125
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:40,783
Say, uh...

126
00:06:40,818 --> 00:06:43,286
where'd i leave
that pigsticker?

127
00:06:43,321 --> 00:06:43,920
What?

128
00:06:43,955 --> 00:06:46,422
You know, the sword.

129
00:06:46,457 --> 00:06:49,542
Oh, didn't you leave it
on this table here?

130
00:06:49,577 --> 00:06:52,545
Well, that's where
i thought i left it.

131
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,047
But it's not there now.

132
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:58,184
Boy, that thing
gives me the willies.

133
00:06:58,219 --> 00:07:00,052
It's funny if i lost it.

134
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:03,189
I've been trying to
lose it for years.

135
00:07:03,224 --> 00:07:05,057
Never could make it though.

136
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:06,809
I should have left it,

137
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:09,312
instead of picking it up
as a souvenir.

138
00:07:09,347 --> 00:07:11,197
You know what i mean?

139
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:15,201
You know, i've...

140
00:07:15,236 --> 00:07:18,321
i've tried to give it away,

141
00:07:18,356 --> 00:07:22,074
sell it, hock it,

142
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:25,828
throw it out with the garbage.

143
00:07:25,863 --> 00:07:29,582
But it always comes back.

144
00:07:29,617 --> 00:07:31,467
Oh, nothing supernatural.

145
00:07:31,502 --> 00:07:33,970
I don't believe in that jazz.

146
00:07:34,005 --> 00:07:38,341
But when people refuse it,
even wrapped as a gift,

147
00:07:38,376 --> 00:07:41,477
when the men on the garbage
truck bring it in,

148
00:07:41,512 --> 00:07:43,346
well, you give up
after a while.

149
00:07:43,381 --> 00:07:45,848
Say...

150
00:07:45,982 --> 00:07:49,101
you wouldn't like to have it,
would you?

151
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:50,353
No.

152
00:07:50,388 --> 00:07:52,238
What would i do with it?

153
00:07:52,273 --> 00:07:55,992
Why, give it back to me,
of course, point first.

154
00:07:56,027 --> 00:07:58,744
I don't know what
you're talking about.

155
00:08:02,365 --> 00:08:04,867
I was just kidding.

156
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:07,003
Don't let it bother you.

157
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:09,872
I don't blame you
for not wanting it.

158
00:08:09,907 --> 00:08:11,123
It's a pretty ugly thing.

159
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:14,260
Especially with
what's engraved on the blade.

160
00:08:14,295 --> 00:08:17,263
Oh, sure,
i know what it says.

161
00:08:17,298 --> 00:08:20,883
I had one of our interpreters
translate it for me

162
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:22,134
right after i got it.

163
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:27,773
It says
"the sword will avenge me."

164
00:08:27,808 --> 00:08:30,276
Isn't that it,
arthur?

165
00:08:30,311 --> 00:08:31,527
I wouldn't know.

166
00:08:31,562 --> 00:08:33,029
Oh, come off it, arthur.

167
00:08:33,064 --> 00:08:34,780
Look, mr. Fenton,
i work for a living,

168
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,032
and i'm kind of in a hurry.

169
00:08:36,067 --> 00:08:37,033
Listen, taro.

170
00:08:37,068 --> 00:08:39,535
What's all this stuff
about working for a living?

171
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:40,786
Now you mentioned that twice.

172
00:08:40,821 --> 00:08:42,038
Don't you think
i work for a living?

173
00:08:42,073 --> 00:08:43,539
I didn't say...

174
00:08:43,574 --> 00:08:45,408
i've been working for a living
ever since i was a kid

175
00:08:45,443 --> 00:08:47,910
and at a job a lot
tougher than mowing lawns,

176
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:49,161
i'll tell you that.

177
00:08:50,413 --> 00:08:54,166
Right up until last week when
i got laid off, i drove a cat.

178
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:55,418
You know what a cat is, arthur?

179
00:08:56,052 --> 00:08:58,554
Well, i can tell you this,
it ain't no sports car.

180
00:08:58,589 --> 00:09:02,308
It's a big earthmover.

181
00:09:02,343 --> 00:09:06,062
You ever move the earth, arthur?

182
00:09:06,097 --> 00:09:08,564
Nah, of course not.

183
00:09:08,599 --> 00:09:10,433
You manicure it.

184
00:09:11,067 --> 00:09:12,935
I've got to get going.

185
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,820
Oh, what's the rush?

186
00:09:14,855 --> 00:09:16,939
Sit down, drink your beer.

187
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:19,442
Just tell me
where you hid the sword.

188
00:09:19,477 --> 00:09:20,693
Where i did what?

189
00:09:20,728 --> 00:09:23,195
You buried it somewhere
to get it out of the way.

190
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,081
You're crazy.

191
00:09:25,116 --> 00:09:27,583
Look, i left that sword
right there on the table.

192
00:09:27,618 --> 00:09:28,834
I remember it distinctly.

193
00:09:30,086 --> 00:09:31,337
Listen, taro-

194
00:09:31,372 --> 00:09:35,091
excuse me, arthur-

195
00:09:35,126 --> 00:09:37,593
are you by any chance
afraid of me?

196
00:09:37,628 --> 00:09:38,844
Why should i be?

197
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:41,347
Well, i can think
of a couple reasons,

198
00:09:41,964 --> 00:09:43,849
one being my background.

199
00:09:43,884 --> 00:09:45,101
I was in a fighting outfit.

200
00:09:45,136 --> 00:09:46,352
You know what that means?

201
00:09:47,603 --> 00:09:49,472
Well, it's not like
the recruiting posters,

202
00:09:49,507 --> 00:09:50,723
i can tell you that.

203
00:09:50,758 --> 00:09:53,859
A nice, clean-cut lad,

204
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:56,362
who helps old ladies
across the street.

205
00:09:56,397 --> 00:09:58,864
He has to be a highly-trained
combat machine,

206
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:01,367
with split-second reactions
in place of emotions.

207
00:10:01,402 --> 00:10:03,235
He's on wires, on his toes.

208
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,121
His nerve ends are dead,

209
00:10:05,156 --> 00:10:08,240
and he's as cold and as hard
and rigid as his helmet.

210
00:10:10,626 --> 00:10:13,746
In fact, there's nothing...
nothing more terrible

211
00:10:13,781 --> 00:10:18,134
to meet on a dark night
than a fighting man

212
00:10:18,169 --> 00:10:20,002
with an m1, a thompson,
a grenade,

213
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:22,505
or even his bare hands.

214
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:26,892
Over here!

215
00:10:26,927 --> 00:10:29,395
Come out and die...

216
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:39,405
some dirty son of heaven,

217
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,159
out in the jungle
just asking for it.

218
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:48,164
So i... i thought i'd oblige.

219
00:10:48,199 --> 00:10:51,917
Started circling out behind him,

220
00:10:51,952 --> 00:10:56,922
a simple exercise for somebody

221
00:10:56,957 --> 00:11:00,676
with more luck than brains.

222
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,334
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

223
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:44,220
I was only telling you
how it was.

224
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:52,344
I'm sorry.

225
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:54,847
Boy, for a minute there,
i thought you were gonna...

226
00:11:54,882 --> 00:11:56,732
i don't know what got into me.

227
00:11:56,767 --> 00:11:58,601
I really don't.

228
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:05,858
You used that sword
like you were mowing a lawn.

229
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,118
You didn't get that sword
the way you said you did.

230
00:12:16,752 --> 00:12:18,003
No?
No.

231
00:12:18,038 --> 00:12:21,006
You shot that officer
after he surrendered.

232
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:22,625
You're crazy.

233
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:26,262
The japanese officer dropped
the sword and surrendered.

234
00:12:26,297 --> 00:12:28,130
You killed him in cold blood.

235
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:31,133
All right, so what if i did?

236
00:12:31,767 --> 00:12:33,636
So what if i did?

237
00:12:33,671 --> 00:12:35,137
I don't know.

238
00:12:35,172 --> 00:12:36,388
That's your problem.

239
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:38,891
I...

240
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:43,896
i don't feel well.

241
00:12:45,147 --> 00:12:46,398
What am i doing here?

242
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:48,901
I've got to get out of here.

243
00:12:55,658 --> 00:12:58,160
Mr. Fenton, the door's stuck!

244
00:12:58,195 --> 00:13:00,546
Well, you must be weak.

245
00:13:00,581 --> 00:13:01,797
Pull on it.

246
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:05,668
It won't move.

247
00:13:05,703 --> 00:13:06,919
Did you lock it?

248
00:13:06,954 --> 00:13:09,171
Now, how could i do
a thing like that?

249
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:11,056
It hasn't got a lock.

250
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:13,559
Here, let me try.

251
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:26,689
Well... it looks like

252
00:13:26,724 --> 00:13:29,191
you're not supposed
to leave just yet.

253
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:31,076
What do you mean?

254
00:13:31,111 --> 00:13:32,945
I don't know.

255
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,447
I don't know what i mean.

256
00:13:57,052 --> 00:13:59,555
Well...

257
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:02,057
i don't know
what's making it stick.

258
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:03,309
It never did that before.

259
00:14:03,344 --> 00:14:04,560
But never mind, boy.

260
00:14:04,595 --> 00:14:06,445
There must be some tools
up here.

261
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,564
We'll take it
off the hinges.

262
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:09,198
Nah, forget
the window.

263
00:14:09,698 --> 00:14:10,316
It's too high.

264
00:14:10,351 --> 00:14:12,201
Well, we could break
a pane of glass

265
00:14:12,236 --> 00:14:14,069
and yell for help, but
let's save that for last.

266
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:16,572
See if you can
find a screwdriver.

267
00:14:27,216 --> 00:14:29,718
Well...

268
00:14:29,753 --> 00:14:32,221
look at the boy.

269
00:14:32,256 --> 00:14:34,723
Becoming a samurai?

270
00:14:34,758 --> 00:14:35,975
Well, forget it, boy.

271
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:37,843
You couldn't make it.

272
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:39,094
Now, if you ever
try to come at me

273
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:39,728
with that thing again,

274
00:14:39,763 --> 00:14:42,231
i'll chop you up
like hamburger.

275
00:14:46,602 --> 00:14:48,487
I don't like that kind
of talk, mr. Fenton.

276
00:14:48,522 --> 00:14:50,356
No?
No.

277
00:14:50,391 --> 00:14:52,858
I got a short fuse,
so don't strike matches.

278
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:56,495
I grew up in honolulu.

279
00:14:57,112 --> 00:14:59,615
I was at pearl harbor
when it was bombed.

280
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,000
Were you one of the pilots?

281
00:15:01,035 --> 00:15:03,252
I was four years old.

282
00:15:03,287 --> 00:15:06,372
My father and mother lived
in hawaii all their lives.

283
00:15:06,407 --> 00:15:08,874
My father worked for the navy
as a civilian.

284
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:11,377
Oh, yeah? Doing what?

285
00:15:12,628 --> 00:15:15,130
He helped build
the docks at pearl.

286
00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:17,016
He was foreman
of a construction gang.

287
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:21,270
He was a war hero.

288
00:15:23,138 --> 00:15:28,143
He was on the docks when
they came that sunday morning.

289
00:15:28,178 --> 00:15:31,897
He was there when the first wave
of bombers came over...

290
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:36,285
standing there, watching men
of his own race destroy

291
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,405
what he'd built
with his own hands.

292
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:42,541
The bombers flew overhead.

293
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:47,546
I stood on the hillside
where we lived,

294
00:15:47,581 --> 00:15:50,666
looked up at the sky
and saw them.

295
00:15:50,701 --> 00:15:52,551
And my mother held my hand

296
00:15:52,586 --> 00:15:55,671
and tried to make me run
inside the house...

297
00:15:55,706 --> 00:15:58,173
but i stood.

298
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:00,676
And i watched the planes...

299
00:16:00,711 --> 00:16:03,178
while down below at the harbor,

300
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:05,064
my father was trying
to warn the sailors,

301
00:16:05,099 --> 00:16:07,566
trying to tell the men
on the ships what was happening.

302
00:16:07,601 --> 00:16:08,817
But the bombers came anyway,

303
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:11,320
and i could hear
the boom, boom, boom, boom

304
00:16:11,355 --> 00:16:13,188
as the bombs exploded.

305
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:15,691
And i could see the smoke.

306
00:16:15,726 --> 00:16:18,827
And my mother was crying,

307
00:16:18,862 --> 00:16:21,330
and my father was yelling
to warn the sailors,

308
00:16:21,365 --> 00:16:23,198
yelling for them to fire back.

309
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:25,951
Boom! Boom! Boom!

310
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:27,836
Planes circled overhead.

311
00:16:27,871 --> 00:16:29,088
They dropped their bombs.

312
00:16:59,234 --> 00:17:01,737
That's not the way
it happened.

313
00:17:04,239 --> 00:17:07,993
He was a traitor.

314
00:17:09,878 --> 00:17:11,747
He signaled the planes.

315
00:17:11,782 --> 00:17:15,501
He showed them
where to drop the bombs.

316
00:17:17,386 --> 00:17:20,506
He was a traitor.

317
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:23,008
My old man was a traitor.

318
00:17:29,264 --> 00:17:30,649
I got to get out of here.

319
00:17:30,684 --> 00:17:33,769
Arthur! Arthur!

320
00:17:33,804 --> 00:17:35,654
Now, you'd better sit down
and have a fresh beer.

321
00:17:35,689 --> 00:17:38,157
You need it.

322
00:17:38,192 --> 00:17:41,276
Aw, that's stupid.

323
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:42,528
Y-y-you come up here

324
00:17:42,563 --> 00:17:45,030
to make a few
bucks mowing lawns.

325
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:46,915
I ask you to
have a beer...

326
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:48,784
because, well,
if you must know,

327
00:17:48,819 --> 00:17:50,035
i was kind of lonesome.

328
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:53,288
My old lady got...
got teed off last night

329
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:55,791
and went to sleep
over at her sister's.

330
00:17:55,826 --> 00:17:58,927
But she'll be back.

331
00:17:58,962 --> 00:18:02,681
I... i guess i drink too much.

332
00:18:04,933 --> 00:18:08,053
You know, arthur,
you're a...

333
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:08,687
you're a pretty
nice joe.

334
00:18:08,722 --> 00:18:10,556
You know, i knew
that right away

335
00:18:10,591 --> 00:18:11,190
when i first saw you.

336
00:18:11,225 --> 00:18:12,441
That's why...

337
00:18:12,476 --> 00:18:13,058
well, that's why
i asked you up

338
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:14,309
to have a beer.

339
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:17,446
So i can... i
can tell you,

340
00:18:17,481 --> 00:18:19,948
man to man, it's been
pretty rough lately.

341
00:18:19,983 --> 00:18:23,702
I... well, they
canned me from my job,

342
00:18:23,737 --> 00:18:26,205
put somebody
else on the cat.

343
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:26,822
Can you imagine?

344
00:18:26,857 --> 00:18:28,707
Just-just-just
because i had

345
00:18:28,742 --> 00:18:30,576
a few lousy
drinks one day.

346
00:18:30,611 --> 00:18:33,078
Ah, no...

347
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:36,215
no, it wasn't the booze.

348
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,717
That was just an excuse.

349
00:18:38,752 --> 00:18:39,968
It's all that
cheap labor

350
00:18:40,003 --> 00:18:41,837
they're bringing
over here.

351
00:18:41,872 --> 00:18:44,973
Yeah, they're letting
them in from everywhere-

352
00:18:45,008 --> 00:18:49,344
mexico, puerto rico,
china, japan- foreigners.

353
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:52,598
We make hawaii a state;
look what we get.

354
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:55,350
Ah, i'm...

355
00:18:55,385 --> 00:18:57,853
i'm getting off the subject.

356
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:00,989
My wife.

357
00:19:01,024 --> 00:19:02,608
Well, like i
said, she...

358
00:19:02,643 --> 00:19:06,361
went over to sleep at
her sister's last night.

359
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:10,115
Said she was all
washed up with me.

360
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,366
Can you tie that?

361
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:13,869
Now, that's
gratitude for you.

362
00:19:13,904 --> 00:19:15,754
But she's going
to come back.

363
00:19:15,789 --> 00:19:17,623
Mm-hmm.

364
00:19:17,658 --> 00:19:22,010
She knows what side her
bread's buttered on.

365
00:19:22,045 --> 00:19:26,381
And if she doesn't,
well, who needs her?

366
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:28,884
Who needs her?

367
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:32,020
A man can make it
alone, huh, arthur?

368
00:19:32,055 --> 00:19:33,889
I mean, well, women
are a dime a dozen.

369
00:19:33,924 --> 00:19:37,025
Anybody that's been to
the orient knows that.

370
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:43,282
What's the
matter, arthur?

371
00:19:43,317 --> 00:19:46,034
Or do you want me
to call you taro now?

372
00:19:47,903 --> 00:19:52,291
Listen, kid,
don't take it so hard.

373
00:19:52,326 --> 00:19:54,159
I mean, you know,
just because your old man

374
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:56,662
was a sneaky little
double-dealing traitor,

375
00:19:56,697 --> 00:19:57,913
that doesn't mean you are.

376
00:19:57,948 --> 00:19:59,164
I mean, what
the devil?

377
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:01,049
You don't have to
go and change your
name and all

378
00:20:01,084 --> 00:20:04,169
and-and forget
you know how to
speak japanese.

379
00:20:05,053 --> 00:20:08,173
There was sneaks and
double-crossers on both sides.

380
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:09,057
Like you.

381
00:20:09,092 --> 00:20:10,559
Now wait a minute.

382
00:20:10,594 --> 00:20:11,810
Wait a minute, buddy.

383
00:20:11,845 --> 00:20:13,679
You're no better.

384
00:20:13,714 --> 00:20:15,564
You're a murderer.

385
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:17,432
You killed a defenseless man.

386
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:18,684
Now take it easy.

387
00:20:18,719 --> 00:20:21,820
What happened on okinawa-
you can't blame that on me.

388
00:20:21,855 --> 00:20:24,323
Now, we were told
not to take prisoners.

389
00:20:24,358 --> 00:20:25,073
That's right.

390
00:20:25,108 --> 00:20:26,942
"No prisoners,"
they said.

391
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:29,444
Well, you...

392
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:31,196
you can't hold a
man responsible

393
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:34,333
for obeying orders,
now, can you?

394
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,201
In the pacific, we were told

395
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:37,452
that you guys
weren't even human-

396
00:20:37,487 --> 00:20:39,338
you were... you were
some species of an ape-

397
00:20:39,373 --> 00:20:43,091
and not to worry
about burning you
out of the caves.

398
00:20:43,126 --> 00:20:46,211
Now all of a sudden, you're
fine people, highly cultured.

399
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:50,599
And it's propaganda about
your lousy transistor radios.

400
00:20:53,101 --> 00:20:58,106
Put that sword down, arthur,
and let's have a beer together.

401
00:20:58,141 --> 00:21:00,609
I don't like to drink alone.

402
00:21:05,614 --> 00:21:07,482
Arthur?

403
00:21:08,984 --> 00:21:12,120
Arthur?

404
00:21:12,155 --> 00:21:14,239
Well, arthur, didn't i tell you?

405
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:15,490
I'm all alone now.

406
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:17,743
My wife up
and left me.

407
00:21:17,778 --> 00:21:20,245
I called the foreman
on the job yesterday,

408
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,496
and he hung
up the phone.

409
00:21:21,997 --> 00:21:23,882
I'm not such a bad guy, arthur.

410
00:21:23,917 --> 00:21:26,385
Why is all this happening?

411
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,002
Why?

412
00:21:31,139 --> 00:21:34,259
All right.

413
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:36,762
Don't answer.

414
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:40,515
If that's what you're here for,
kill me.

415
00:21:43,151 --> 00:21:45,020
Go on, i dare you.

416
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:49,408
Come on, taro,
i'm waiting for you.

417
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:55,530
Oh... so that's it.

418
00:21:56,782 --> 00:21:59,284
You're just trying to scare me.

419
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:01,169
Well, all right.

420
00:22:01,204 --> 00:22:03,038
I'm scared...

421
00:22:03,073 --> 00:22:04,923
but not of dying.

422
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:07,426
Of living.

423
00:22:07,461 --> 00:22:09,294
I can't make it, arthur,

424
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:11,797
or taro, or whatever
your name is.

425
00:22:11,832 --> 00:22:14,299
There's nothing left. Nothing!

426
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:18,053
I've got a box
full of decorations over there.

427
00:22:18,088 --> 00:22:19,938
Decorations!

428
00:22:19,973 --> 00:22:23,058
First, you're an ape,
and now all of a sudden,

429
00:22:23,093 --> 00:22:26,812
you're-you're some kind
of highly-cultured people.

430
00:22:26,847 --> 00:22:29,314
I've been pushed and pulled
this way and that way

431
00:22:29,349 --> 00:22:33,702
until i hate everybody,
you dirty little jap!

432
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:57,536
Bonzai!

433
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:15,053
Two men in an attic,
locked in mortal embrace.

434
00:24:15,088 --> 00:24:18,807
Their common bond
guilt-

435
00:24:18,842 --> 00:24:22,561
a disease all too prevalent
amongst men

436
00:24:22,596 --> 00:24:26,932
both in and out
of the twilight zone.

437
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:30,902
And now, mr. Serling.

438
00:24:30,937 --> 00:24:32,771
Next time out,
we move into the area

439
00:24:32,806 --> 00:24:35,273
of graveyards
and the dear departed

440
00:24:35,308 --> 00:24:36,525
and we tell you a story

441
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,410
about a most distinctive
type of fella

442
00:24:38,445 --> 00:24:41,530
who happily enough has an
equally distinctive profession-

443
00:24:41,565 --> 00:24:44,032
he raises the dead.

444
00:24:44,067 --> 00:24:46,535
Onthe twilight zonenext time,
john dehner, stanley adams

445
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:48,420
and j. Pat o'malley
lend selective talents

446
00:24:48,455 --> 00:24:52,791
to a little item called
"mr. Garrity and the graves."
