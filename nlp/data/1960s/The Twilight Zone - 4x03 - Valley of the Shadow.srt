1
00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:11,361
You unlock this door
with the key of imagination.

2
00:00:11,396 --> 00:00:13,229
Beyond it is another dimension-

3
00:00:13,264 --> 00:00:15,365
a dimension of sound,

4
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:17,867
a dimension of sight,

5
00:00:17,902 --> 00:00:19,736
a dimension of mind.

6
00:00:19,771 --> 00:00:22,872
You're moving into a land
of both shadow and substance,

7
00:00:22,907 --> 00:00:24,741
of things and ideas.

8
00:00:24,776 --> 00:00:29,129
You've just crossed over
into the twilight zone.

9
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:53,463
Oh, i didn't hear you.

10
00:01:53,498 --> 00:01:55,965
Are you sick,
young man?

11
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,217
No.

12
00:01:57,252 --> 00:01:59,085
You look sick.

13
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,588
My husband
looked like that

14
00:02:01,623 --> 00:02:03,473
just before
he died-

15
00:02:03,508 --> 00:02:05,341
all white
and pasty.

16
00:02:05,376 --> 00:02:06,593
No, no, i'm all right.

17
00:02:06,628 --> 00:02:09,095
Just what he said,

18
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:12,849
just those words-
"i'm all right."

19
00:02:12,884 --> 00:02:13,983
Went to bed.

20
00:02:14,018 --> 00:02:15,852
Next morning, went to wake him-

21
00:02:15,887 --> 00:02:18,988
there he was sprawled out dead.

22
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:22,358
You don't drink, do you?

23
00:02:22,393 --> 00:02:23,610
No.

24
00:02:23,645 --> 00:02:26,112
Well, that's
what killed
my jack.

25
00:02:26,147 --> 00:02:28,615
I told him
it was the devil's work,

26
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:29,866
but he wouldn't listen to me.

27
00:02:29,901 --> 00:02:33,002
And you can see where he is now.

28
00:02:33,037 --> 00:02:36,122
Oh, the devil's
all around us, mister,

29
00:02:36,157 --> 00:02:38,625
all around us,
everywhere we go.

30
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,510
If we don't fight him,

31
00:02:40,545 --> 00:02:43,379
if we don't
stand up to him,

32
00:02:43,414 --> 00:02:46,132
we suffer
eternal torment.

33
00:02:46,167 --> 00:02:48,017
Yeah, i'm sure
you're right.

34
00:02:48,052 --> 00:02:49,886
I know i'm right,

35
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:52,388
and i'll tell you
how i know.

36
00:02:52,423 --> 00:02:54,023
It was on a sunday.

37
00:02:54,058 --> 00:02:56,526
I was ironing, if you please,

38
00:02:56,561 --> 00:03:00,897
and that's when it came
out of a clear blue sky.

39
00:03:00,932 --> 00:03:04,033
Oh, the dear good lord's
own sweet breath

40
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:07,287
and his voice
like an electric shock-

41
00:03:07,322 --> 00:03:09,038
i was revelated!

42
00:03:09,073 --> 00:03:14,661
Oh, praise him, mister,
and praise his good works!

43
00:03:14,696 --> 00:03:15,912
Do you read the book?

44
00:03:15,947 --> 00:03:17,797
What book is that?

45
00:03:17,832 --> 00:03:19,666
Why, the good book!

46
00:03:19,701 --> 00:03:22,552
Oh, yes, all the time.

47
00:03:22,587 --> 00:03:25,922
You sure you're telling
the truth, now?

48
00:03:25,957 --> 00:03:29,175
We may be a mile underground,
but he hears every word.

49
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,677
Yes, it's the truth!

50
00:03:35,717 --> 00:03:40,069
All right, leviticus,
chapter five, verse two.

51
00:03:40,104 --> 00:03:44,324
Perfect, you're perfect.

52
00:03:44,359 --> 00:03:45,074
Well?

53
00:03:45,109 --> 00:03:46,943
Lady, please!

54
00:03:46,978 --> 00:03:50,079
"Or if a soul touch
any unclean thing,

55
00:03:50,114 --> 00:03:52,949
"whether it be a carcass
of an unclean beast,

56
00:03:52,984 --> 00:03:55,451
"or a carcass
of unclean cattle,

57
00:03:55,486 --> 00:03:59,205
"or a carcass of unclean
creeping things, and if it be

58
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,090
"hidden from him,

59
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:05,461
he shall also be
unclean and guilty."

60
00:04:05,496 --> 00:04:06,713
Lady, go away!

61
00:04:06,748 --> 00:04:08,598
Don't you want to be saved?

62
00:04:08,633 --> 00:04:10,466
No, i just want
to be left alone!

63
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:12,352
We're never alone,
young man-

64
00:04:12,387 --> 00:04:13,353
don't you know that?

65
00:04:13,388 --> 00:04:14,604
He's always with us,

66
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:16,856
and he'll help us
if we only let him,

67
00:04:16,891 --> 00:04:19,225
but we've got
to be saved first.

68
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,977
Here, read this.

69
00:04:21,012 --> 00:04:23,479
Take it, read it!

70
00:04:25,982 --> 00:04:27,233
It'll change your life.

71
00:04:27,268 --> 00:04:29,736
Oh, the devil means
to have you, mister,

72
00:04:29,771 --> 00:04:31,621
but i won't let him.

73
00:04:31,656 --> 00:04:34,240
I'll fight with you,
and we'll win.

74
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:35,742
Listen to me,
mister,

75
00:04:35,777 --> 00:04:38,244
it's salvation
i'm talking about!

76
00:04:39,495 --> 00:04:41,247
No, no, no!

77
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:52,508
What you have just witnessed
could be the end

78
00:04:52,543 --> 00:04:55,645
of a particularly
terrifying nightmare.

79
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,896
It isn't.

80
00:04:56,931 --> 00:04:58,147
It's the beginning.

81
00:04:58,182 --> 00:05:00,650
Although alan talbot
doesn't know it,

82
00:05:00,685 --> 00:05:02,518
he's about to enter
a strange new world

83
00:05:02,553 --> 00:05:07,523
too incredible to be real,
too real to be a dream.

84
00:05:07,558 --> 00:05:10,026
It's called the twilight zone.

85
00:05:43,693 --> 00:05:45,561
I'm sorry to
bother you, ma'am,

86
00:05:45,596 --> 00:05:47,447
but, like, i belong to
the junior woodchucks,

87
00:05:47,482 --> 00:05:49,315
and if you buy a
ten-year subscription

88
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,566
to theladies'
home companion,

89
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:52,452
i get a genuine toy
typewriter free.

90
00:05:52,487 --> 00:05:53,703
Now, what do you say?

91
00:05:53,738 --> 00:05:56,823
No, thank you
very much.

92
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:02,462
Hi.

93
00:06:02,497 --> 00:06:03,713
You ready?

94
00:06:03,748 --> 00:06:04,964
And willing.

95
00:06:04,999 --> 00:06:07,467
You disappointed?

96
00:06:07,502 --> 00:06:10,586
I'm a little surprised.

97
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,591
I told you
that there were lines

98
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:17,477
that i did not cross.

99
00:06:17,512 --> 00:06:18,728
I know. I was
going to wait

100
00:06:18,763 --> 00:06:19,345
till after we
got married,

101
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,596
but something
came over me.

102
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:21,848
I lost my
self-control.

103
00:06:21,883 --> 00:06:23,733
Well, you look
around for it.

104
00:06:23,768 --> 00:06:26,235
And i'll get you
some coffee.

105
00:06:30,106 --> 00:06:31,357
How come so late?

106
00:06:31,392 --> 00:06:33,242
Who's late?

107
00:06:33,277 --> 00:06:35,111
Who's late? You're late.

108
00:06:35,745 --> 00:06:36,996
What, five minutes?

109
00:06:37,031 --> 00:06:40,116
No, 45 minutes.

110
00:06:40,151 --> 00:06:42,618
Honey, i keep telling you,
get rid of that sundial.

111
00:06:42,653 --> 00:06:44,504
Okay, so you overslept.

112
00:06:44,539 --> 00:06:46,372
Just remember,
it wasn't my idea

113
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:48,257
to leave at 5:00
in the morning.

114
00:06:48,292 --> 00:06:49,509
Look, i did
notoversleep.

115
00:06:49,544 --> 00:06:51,377
I left the hotel
at 4:30 a.m.

116
00:06:51,412 --> 00:06:53,262
I got on the subway,
i got off the subway,

117
00:06:53,297 --> 00:06:54,630
i came here-
therefore...

118
00:06:54,665 --> 00:06:56,516
therefore you must
have stopped someplace

119
00:06:56,551 --> 00:06:59,635
and had a few short beers,
because now it's almost 6:00.

120
00:07:03,773 --> 00:07:04,390
See?

121
00:07:04,425 --> 00:07:08,144
Yeah, i see, but
i don't understand.

122
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:15,284
Alan, you're going
to be very proud of me.

123
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:16,536
Why?

124
00:07:16,571 --> 00:07:19,038
You wanted to take
a lunch, huh?

125
00:07:20,289 --> 00:07:22,792
So i roasted us a chicken.

126
00:07:22,827 --> 00:07:24,660
Oh, great!

127
00:07:27,797 --> 00:07:29,048
Jess...

128
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:29,665
yeah?

129
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:32,802
Are you sure?

130
00:07:39,058 --> 00:07:40,309
What do you mean?

131
00:07:40,344 --> 00:07:42,428
I mean, do you know
what you're doing?

132
00:07:42,463 --> 00:07:46,432
Yes, i do.

133
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:52,071
I am a spinster
well over 20 years old...

134
00:07:52,106 --> 00:07:55,191
and i am sound of mind

135
00:07:55,226 --> 00:07:57,577
and sound of body.

136
00:07:57,612 --> 00:07:59,445
I'm going to visit
a town

137
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,948
i have never seen
before

138
00:08:01,983 --> 00:08:04,200
for the purpose
of meeting and impressing

139
00:08:04,235 --> 00:08:06,085
a woman i've never
heard of before

140
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,954
for the purpose
of marrying a guy

141
00:08:07,989 --> 00:08:10,456
i've known
for exactly four days.

142
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:11,707
What's so odd
about that?

143
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:13,593
No, i'm serious.

144
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:15,461
Well, so am i.

145
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:20,099
Shouldn't you...
shouldn't you know

146
00:08:20,134 --> 00:08:21,968
more about me
or something?

147
00:08:22,003 --> 00:08:25,104
Like what?

148
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:28,224
I know your name is alan talbot.

149
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:31,360
I know that you come
from coeurville, new york,

150
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:33,863
that you live
in a big white house

151
00:08:33,898 --> 00:08:36,365
surrounded by rosebushes
and trees

152
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,485
and that you do
scientific research on a bomb.

153
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,988
Not a bomb, a computer,
electronics.

154
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:44,490
Now, you see, you're
romanticizing me already.

155
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:46,375
Don't interrupt.

156
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:48,878
You're visiting new york city

157
00:08:48,913 --> 00:08:51,380
for the pure
morbid pleasure of it.

158
00:08:51,415 --> 00:08:54,500
You make $600 a month.

159
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:55,751
You're very kind
to small animals

160
00:08:55,786 --> 00:08:58,254
and very nice
to old chestnut vendors.

161
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:02,008
And now you're
very lonely.

162
00:09:02,043 --> 00:09:04,510
And you're
desperately in need

163
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:08,264
of a woman who's five foot three

164
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:13,269
who answers to the name
of jessica connelly, right?

165
00:09:13,304 --> 00:09:15,154
Right.

166
00:09:15,189 --> 00:09:17,657
And youaresingle.

167
00:09:17,692 --> 00:09:19,525
At the present.

168
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,029
Alan...

169
00:09:23,064 --> 00:09:25,531
do you think i'm going
to like coeurville?

170
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:27,416
Only if you
happen to like

171
00:09:27,451 --> 00:09:28,668
great little towns

172
00:09:28,703 --> 00:09:31,170
full of warm,
friendly people.

173
00:09:31,205 --> 00:09:32,421
You've only been gone
a week,

174
00:09:32,456 --> 00:09:34,290
and already
you're homesick.

175
00:09:34,325 --> 00:09:35,541
Well, i better like it.

176
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:37,426
You will, and you'll
love aunt mildred.

177
00:09:37,461 --> 00:09:39,929
Now, come on,
quit stalling!

178
00:09:52,476 --> 00:09:53,693
Walter!

179
00:09:55,229 --> 00:09:57,697
Walter, no!

180
00:09:57,732 --> 00:09:59,815
No, it isn't right.

181
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:02,201
Send me back.

182
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:12,078
Walter...

183
00:10:12,113 --> 00:10:13,329
alan...

184
00:10:13,364 --> 00:10:17,083
alan. Alan.

185
00:10:17,118 --> 00:10:20,219
You were having
a nightmare.

186
00:10:20,254 --> 00:10:23,973
What, in the middle
of the morning?

187
00:10:24,008 --> 00:10:25,841
Who's walter?

188
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:27,093
Who's who?

189
00:10:27,128 --> 00:10:30,229
You kept saying
"walter."

190
00:10:30,264 --> 00:10:33,983
Oh, well, this is
a poor time to tell you,

191
00:10:34,018 --> 00:10:35,851
but he happens
to be my brother.

192
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:38,354
Oh?
Yes, it's
a tragic situation.

193
00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:40,856
We keep him locked
in the cellar.

194
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:42,108
I don't like
to think about it.

195
00:10:42,143 --> 00:10:43,993
Oh, alan, you idiot!

196
00:10:44,028 --> 00:10:45,861
I don't know
any walter.

197
00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:47,747
Well, maybe awake, you
don't know any walter,

198
00:10:47,782 --> 00:10:50,249
but asleep, you're
scared to death of him!

199
00:10:50,284 --> 00:10:53,369
I said i don't know
any walter.

200
00:10:53,404 --> 00:10:55,254
Okay...

201
00:10:55,289 --> 00:10:58,374
okay, you big grouch.

202
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:00,876
You want me to drive?

203
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:02,762
Sure, but just
be careful.

204
00:11:02,797 --> 00:11:05,264
It's not paid
for yet.

205
00:11:09,018 --> 00:11:12,772
Ooh, changing
of the guard.

206
00:11:12,807 --> 00:11:14,640
Hey, you see that?
Yeah.

207
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:16,525
I used to play here
when i was a kid.

208
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,777
Every time i ran
away from home,

209
00:11:17,812 --> 00:11:21,530
i got just
about this far.

210
00:11:21,565 --> 00:11:23,399
Hey, you see
that road?
Uh-huh.

211
00:11:23,434 --> 00:11:26,152
Love alley,
we used to call it.

212
00:11:26,187 --> 00:11:28,788
Great place for
sparking the girlies.

213
00:11:28,823 --> 00:11:30,656
And how would you know?

214
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:32,541
Well, my love, in
sparking circles,

215
00:11:32,576 --> 00:11:34,410
i was known as the
human electrode.

216
00:11:34,445 --> 00:11:38,798
The human electrode.
What am i getting into?

217
00:12:05,109 --> 00:12:07,576
Oh, alan,
it's lovely.

218
00:12:07,611 --> 00:12:09,445
There's the new
brunswick hotel
over there.

219
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,698
They got an ice cream parlor
and a magazine store.

220
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:14,200
You can also buy
cigarettes in there

221
00:12:14,235 --> 00:12:16,085
if you can prove
you're over 21.

222
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,205
Mr. Van brooks
isverystrict
about that.

223
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,090
Do you think
i could get by?

224
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:22,958
Well, maybe...

225
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:24,844
maybe not.

226
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:26,712
That's where we
buy our groceries.

227
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:27,963
That's a fine
old store.

228
00:12:28,597 --> 00:12:29,849
Around the corner
is the depot.

229
00:12:29,884 --> 00:12:31,100
You can't see
that from here.

230
00:12:31,135 --> 00:12:32,351
And the library's
down on oak street.

231
00:12:32,386 --> 00:12:33,602
And over there is...

232
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:40,109
well, don't stop now.

233
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:42,611
Alan, what is it?

234
00:12:42,646 --> 00:12:45,731
Well, either
i've got the worst
memory in the world,

235
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:47,616
or they put up
a new building.

236
00:12:47,651 --> 00:12:49,985
In one week?

237
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,488
Well, it's pre-fab.

238
00:12:52,523 --> 00:12:53,622
I tell you,
young lady,

239
00:12:53,657 --> 00:12:54,874
they don't
build buildings

240
00:12:54,909 --> 00:12:57,376
the way they used to.

241
00:12:57,411 --> 00:13:00,496
Alan, do me
a little favor, huh?

242
00:13:00,531 --> 00:13:01,747
Sure.

243
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:03,632
Could we stop and have
a little quick one

244
00:13:03,667 --> 00:13:04,250
before we meet the gang?

245
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:06,135
Just a wee little one.

246
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:08,003
In the first place,
there's no gang to meet.

247
00:13:08,038 --> 00:13:09,255
There's just
aunt mildred.

248
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:10,506
And in the
second place,

249
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:13,008
there's not one
bar in coeurville.

250
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:15,511
Really? I thought
i saw one.

251
00:13:15,546 --> 00:13:17,396
Nope, nearest
one's temple,

252
00:13:17,431 --> 00:13:18,647
15 miles away.

253
00:13:18,682 --> 00:13:19,899
I'll take you
in the hotel

254
00:13:19,934 --> 00:13:21,767
and buy you a
cup of coffee.

255
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:23,652
That's fine.

256
00:13:38,667 --> 00:13:40,536
Something i can do
for you folks?

257
00:13:40,571 --> 00:13:42,421
Where's the
restaurant?

258
00:13:42,456 --> 00:13:44,290
Four doors down,
kelsey's cafe.

259
00:13:44,325 --> 00:13:45,541
No, i mean
the one here.

260
00:13:45,576 --> 00:13:46,175
What happened?
Did you close?

261
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:50,546
Never had one here.
Just a hotel.

262
00:13:50,581 --> 00:13:52,431
This is the
new brunswick?

263
00:13:52,466 --> 00:13:54,934
Yes, sir.

264
00:13:54,969 --> 00:13:56,802
I see.

265
00:13:56,837 --> 00:14:01,190
I know how absent-minded
you scientific men are,

266
00:14:01,225 --> 00:14:02,441
so i know you won't mind
my asking-

267
00:14:02,476 --> 00:14:03,692
are you sure
this is the right town?

268
00:14:03,727 --> 00:14:05,561
Course i'm sure.

269
00:14:05,596 --> 00:14:07,446
Well, alan,
don't snap at me.

270
00:14:07,481 --> 00:14:09,949
I'm sorry, i guess
i'm just nervous.

271
00:14:09,984 --> 00:14:11,200
Look, jess,
let's go home

272
00:14:11,235 --> 00:14:12,451
and get something
there, all right?

273
00:14:12,486 --> 00:14:13,702
Sure, fine.

274
00:14:13,737 --> 00:14:16,205
Is that
your mr. Van brooks?

275
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,073
No. I don't
know who he is.

276
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:20,576
It's as though 20
years have gone by.

277
00:14:20,611 --> 00:14:22,461
Everything's
different.

278
00:14:22,496 --> 00:14:25,581
I think you're just looking
at things for the first time.

279
00:14:25,616 --> 00:14:28,083
I've lived near times square
all my life,

280
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:31,220
but i don't remember
seeing it, really, for years.

281
00:14:31,255 --> 00:14:33,088
They could've put up
half a dozen new buildings-

282
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:36,225
i'd never notice
because i just don't look.

283
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:36,842
Yeah, that's
probably it.

284
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:52,491
Now, thati would
recognize anywhere.

285
00:14:52,526 --> 00:14:53,108
You like it?

286
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:54,994
What if i didn't?

287
00:14:55,029 --> 00:14:57,496
Of course i do.
It's charming.

288
00:14:57,531 --> 00:14:58,747
Come on!

289
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:15,130
The first thing
we're going to do

290
00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:16,382
is paint it- pink.

291
00:15:16,417 --> 00:15:19,518
Why not purple?

292
00:15:19,553 --> 00:15:22,638
Oh, she must have it
locked from the inside.

293
00:15:22,673 --> 00:15:24,523
Aunt mildred?

294
00:15:24,558 --> 00:15:26,392
Aunt mildred!

295
00:15:26,427 --> 00:15:27,643
Alan, you're going
to shake up the
whole neighborhood.

296
00:15:28,277 --> 00:15:29,528
Well, i have to.
She's hard-of-hearing.

297
00:15:29,563 --> 00:15:30,779
Aunt mildred?

298
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:35,034
What do you want?

299
00:15:35,069 --> 00:15:36,285
I'm alan talbot.

300
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,536
So?

301
00:15:37,571 --> 00:15:39,405
So i happen to live here.

302
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,040
Now, would you mind
telling me who you are

303
00:15:41,075 --> 00:15:42,908
and what you're doing
in my house?

304
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:44,043
Are you crazy
or something?

305
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:45,911
Wait a minute.
Where's aunt mildred?

306
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:46,545
Who?

307
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:49,048
Mildred talbot.

308
00:15:49,665 --> 00:15:50,916
Now, listen, mister, let
me tell you something.

309
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:52,801
You've made some
kind of a mistake.

310
00:15:52,836 --> 00:15:54,053
I live here.

311
00:15:54,088 --> 00:15:56,055
I've lived here
for nine years.

312
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:57,306
I bought this place
from gerald butler,

313
00:15:57,341 --> 00:15:59,174
and i've got the deed
to prove it.

314
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:00,559
I don't know anybody
named mildred,

315
00:16:00,594 --> 00:16:02,428
and i don't know
you, either.

316
00:16:02,463 --> 00:16:03,679
Now, you get
off my property,

317
00:16:03,714 --> 00:16:06,181
or i'll call
the sheriff!

318
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:09,318
Wait!

319
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:36,478
Alan, what are
you going to do?

320
00:16:36,513 --> 00:16:37,730
What would you
do if you found

321
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:39,615
some stranger living
in your house?

322
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:40,232
Call the police!

323
00:16:53,495 --> 00:16:56,382
Hi.

324
00:16:59,501 --> 00:17:01,003
Who'd you want to see?

325
00:17:01,038 --> 00:17:04,506
Would you tell mrs.
Cook i'd like to use
the phone, please?

326
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:06,642
Mrs. Cook?

327
00:17:06,677 --> 00:17:08,510
Yes. Please hurry.

328
00:17:08,545 --> 00:17:10,396
I'm sorry.
Mrs. Cook doesn't live here.

329
00:17:10,431 --> 00:17:11,647
She died.

330
00:17:11,682 --> 00:17:13,148
What?!

331
00:17:13,183 --> 00:17:16,268
About three... three years ago,
i think.

332
00:17:16,303 --> 00:17:18,771
You aren't her cousin
from sweden, are you?

333
00:17:18,806 --> 00:17:20,155
No, i'm not her
cousin from sweden!

334
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:22,024
I'm alan talbot, and
i live next door,

335
00:17:22,059 --> 00:17:23,909
and i had lunch with
mrs. Cook a week ago!

336
00:17:23,944 --> 00:17:26,412
Thank you very much.
Come on, alan.

337
00:17:29,164 --> 00:17:31,166
I had lunch with
agatha cook a week ago,

338
00:17:31,201 --> 00:17:33,035
just before i
left for new york.

339
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:35,537
I know you did.
You mentioned it.

340
00:17:35,572 --> 00:17:38,674
Jess, i don't know
what's going on...

341
00:17:38,709 --> 00:17:40,542
but i'm going
to find out.

342
00:17:56,058 --> 00:17:59,194
Well, that's it.
That's where i work.

343
00:17:59,229 --> 00:18:02,948
The university of coeurville,
established 1912.

344
00:18:02,983 --> 00:18:05,451
Over there- that four-story
building- you see it?

345
00:18:06,068 --> 00:18:08,070
My office
is on the second floor.

346
00:18:08,105 --> 00:18:09,955
Well, what do you think of it?

347
00:18:11,073 --> 00:18:12,958
I don't know what to think.

348
00:18:12,993 --> 00:18:14,827
Well, maybe
they moved it.

349
00:18:14,862 --> 00:18:16,078
Sure. In the week
i've been gone,

350
00:18:16,113 --> 00:18:17,963
they took it apart
brick by brick

351
00:18:17,998 --> 00:18:19,832
and moved it somewhere else.

352
00:18:19,867 --> 00:18:21,083
For pete's sake,
i've made this drive

353
00:18:21,118 --> 00:18:22,968
twice a day for over ten years.

354
00:18:23,003 --> 00:18:25,721
You'd think i'd forget?

355
00:18:25,756 --> 00:18:28,223
I'm sorry.

356
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:31,977
It's okay.

357
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:52,614
Did you get everything
all straightened out?

358
00:18:52,649 --> 00:18:53,866
Sure. I'm out
of my mind.

359
00:18:53,901 --> 00:18:54,500
Oh, alan...

360
00:18:54,535 --> 00:18:55,751
i don't know what
else to think.

361
00:18:55,786 --> 00:18:57,002
What else
can i think?

362
00:18:57,037 --> 00:18:58,871
Somebody i never
saw before living
in my house?

363
00:18:58,906 --> 00:19:00,122
Woman i had lunch
with a week ago

364
00:19:00,157 --> 00:19:01,373
dead three years?

365
00:19:01,408 --> 00:19:03,258
New buildings
in the town?

366
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:09,631
This is going
to sound crazy, i know,

367
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:11,517
but do you remember
what you said

368
00:19:11,552 --> 00:19:13,385
when we tried to get coffee
at that hotel?

369
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,888
The one that didn't have
the coffee shop?

370
00:19:15,923 --> 00:19:20,893
You said it was as though
coeurville had aged 20 years.

371
00:19:20,928 --> 00:19:22,144
Do you remember?

372
00:19:22,179 --> 00:19:24,029
20 years in a week?

373
00:19:24,064 --> 00:19:25,898
Well, maybe not in one week.

374
00:19:25,933 --> 00:19:28,400
What do you mean?

375
00:19:28,435 --> 00:19:31,537
I'm not sure.

376
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:35,290
But what if it's true?

377
00:19:35,325 --> 00:19:37,793
What if 20 years have gone by?

378
00:19:39,661 --> 00:19:41,547
I'm rip van winkle?

379
00:19:41,582 --> 00:19:44,049
Well, why not?

380
00:19:44,084 --> 00:19:47,169
Alan, it's a possibility,
isn't it?

381
00:19:47,204 --> 00:19:48,420
No, i thought
about that.

382
00:19:48,455 --> 00:19:50,305
That doesn't hold up
for a lot of reasons.

383
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,808
For one thing, it would
make me at least 45 years old,

384
00:19:52,843 --> 00:19:54,676
unless i left town
when i was ten,

385
00:19:54,711 --> 00:19:55,928
and that couldn't be,
because i went

386
00:19:55,963 --> 00:19:59,064
to high school and college here!

387
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:00,933
Except there aren't
any records showing

388
00:20:00,968 --> 00:20:02,818
i ever went to coeurville high.

389
00:20:02,853 --> 00:20:05,320
And the university i work for,
dear old coeurville u.,

390
00:20:05,355 --> 00:20:05,938
doesn't even exist!

391
00:20:05,973 --> 00:20:07,823
It never existed!

392
00:20:09,691 --> 00:20:12,194
Well...

393
00:20:12,229 --> 00:20:14,079
what about your aunt?

394
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:17,199
I just checked.

395
00:20:17,234 --> 00:20:19,084
There's not a trace of evidence

396
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:20,953
that a mildred talbot
ever lived here.

397
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:23,956
It was an idea.

398
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:28,343
Come on.

399
00:20:28,378 --> 00:20:29,595
Where to now?

400
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:31,463
The cemetery.

401
00:20:52,367 --> 00:20:54,870
Alan, why are
you doing this?

402
00:20:54,905 --> 00:20:57,372
To find out if the
world's gone crazy...

403
00:20:57,407 --> 00:20:59,875
or if i have.

404
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:02,377
My parents are
buried here.

405
00:21:02,412 --> 00:21:05,497
If i can just find
their graves...

406
00:21:16,258 --> 00:21:17,509
over there-

407
00:21:17,544 --> 00:21:18,760
talbots have been
buried in that plot

408
00:21:18,795 --> 00:21:21,263
for over 50 years.

409
00:21:40,282 --> 00:21:42,167
Oh!

410
00:21:42,202 --> 00:21:43,535
Those the ones?

411
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:45,420
That's them, all right.

412
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:48,540
I'm sorry.

413
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:57,933
This man says
you caused

414
00:21:57,968 --> 00:21:59,184
a disturbance
at his house.

415
00:21:59,219 --> 00:21:59,801
Do you admit it?

416
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:02,938
Yes, i made a mistake.

417
00:22:02,973 --> 00:22:04,806
Said you claimed
it was your house.

418
00:22:04,841 --> 00:22:07,309
Well, i thought it was.

419
00:22:07,344 --> 00:22:09,194
I'm sorry.

420
00:22:09,229 --> 00:22:11,697
Are you satisfied?

421
00:22:11,732 --> 00:22:13,565
Well, as long as
he owns up to it.

422
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,199
But you better
not come

423
00:22:14,234 --> 00:22:15,450
pestering me again,
young fellow!

424
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:18,570
I won't!

425
00:22:18,605 --> 00:22:22,324
Go on back to the car.
I'll be along in a minute.

426
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:27,329
What's your
name, son?

427
00:22:27,364 --> 00:22:29,214
Alan talbot.

428
00:22:29,249 --> 00:22:30,465
Is this
your wife?

429
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,585
No... we're
just friends.

430
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,470
Well, mr. Talbot,
do you want

431
00:22:35,505 --> 00:22:37,339
to tell me what you're
doing in coeurville?

432
00:22:37,374 --> 00:22:39,224
You the sheriff?
That's right.

433
00:22:39,259 --> 00:22:40,475
What happened
to carl jasperson?

434
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:41,727
He's the man
i replaced.

435
00:22:41,762 --> 00:22:42,978
Do you know him?

436
00:22:43,013 --> 00:22:44,846
He's my godfather.

437
00:22:44,881 --> 00:22:46,732
Where can i find him?

438
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,851
Over there.

439
00:22:53,605 --> 00:22:54,856
Oh, miss...

440
00:22:57,359 --> 00:22:58,610
i can't force you
to do anything,

441
00:22:58,645 --> 00:22:59,861
because you haven't
broken any laws,

442
00:22:59,896 --> 00:23:01,747
but i'd like to suggest
that you take your friend

443
00:23:01,782 --> 00:23:02,998
to see a doctor.

444
00:23:03,033 --> 00:23:04,249
He looks sick.

445
00:23:04,284 --> 00:23:07,369
And the way he was staring
at that grave...

446
00:23:07,404 --> 00:23:09,871
is he kin
to walter ryder?

447
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:16,128
I don't know.

448
00:23:22,384 --> 00:23:24,886
Let's go, alan.

449
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:44,039
How do you feel?

450
00:23:45,907 --> 00:23:47,793
Alan?

451
00:23:51,046 --> 00:23:52,914
Darling, i know
how upset you are,

452
00:23:52,949 --> 00:23:56,051
but there's a rational
explanation for all this.

453
00:23:56,086 --> 00:23:58,804
There has to be.

454
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:03,175
A friend of mine,
dr. Matthews...

455
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:05,060
he had a patient once

456
00:24:05,095 --> 00:24:06,928
who couldn't even remember
her own name.

457
00:24:06,963 --> 00:24:10,432
She was on
a plane...

458
00:24:10,467 --> 00:24:11,683
suddenly, she
couldn't remember

459
00:24:11,718 --> 00:24:15,437
where she was going,
or why, or anything.

460
00:24:15,472 --> 00:24:16,688
When he first
talked to her,

461
00:24:16,723 --> 00:24:17,939
she couldn't
remember

462
00:24:17,974 --> 00:24:21,076
a thing about
her life.

463
00:24:21,111 --> 00:24:24,830
But after two weeks,
she was just fine.

464
00:24:24,865 --> 00:24:27,332
It was a form
of amnesia.

465
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:33,588
I think you should
see him, alan.

466
00:24:33,623 --> 00:24:36,091
You'll like
dr. Matthews.

467
00:24:36,126 --> 00:24:39,211
Put it down, alan! Get away!

468
00:24:39,246 --> 00:24:41,713
Run, walter, run!

469
00:24:41,748 --> 00:24:42,964
Stop the car!

470
00:24:42,999 --> 00:24:45,467
Are you going to be sick?

471
00:24:45,502 --> 00:24:47,352
Yes! Hurry, stop the car!

472
00:24:55,896 --> 00:24:59,614
Look out, you'll kill me with
that... kill me with that...

473
00:24:59,649 --> 00:25:03,985
kill me... kill me...
kill... kill...

474
00:25:11,528 --> 00:25:13,378
jess, can you give me a hand?

475
00:25:13,995 --> 00:25:16,498
I'm coming, alan!

476
00:25:17,132 --> 00:25:19,000
Hurry!

477
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:28,643
No!

478
00:25:28,678 --> 00:25:31,146
Jess, get away from me!

479
00:25:33,014 --> 00:25:34,900
Get away from me!

480
00:25:34,935 --> 00:25:38,019
Get in the car and drive away
as quick as you can!

481
00:25:38,054 --> 00:25:39,905
Alan, let me help you!

482
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:42,407
No! I'll see you later
at your apartment.

483
00:25:42,442 --> 00:25:43,658
How are you going
to get back there?

484
00:25:43,693 --> 00:25:44,910
Never mind, just go!

485
00:25:46,161 --> 00:25:48,029
Go now, jess!

486
00:25:49,531 --> 00:25:50,165
Run!

487
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:57,539
Kill me! Kill me!

488
00:25:57,574 --> 00:25:59,424
Kill me! Kill me! Kill me!

489
00:26:06,047 --> 00:26:08,550
Kill me! Kill me! Kill me!

490
00:26:40,715 --> 00:26:41,967
Mister, are
you all right?

491
00:26:42,002 --> 00:26:43,835
Are you all
right, mister?

492
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:45,086
I didn't see
you, honest!

493
00:26:45,121 --> 00:26:46,338
I came around
the turn.

494
00:26:46,373 --> 00:26:48,223
I didn't see you.

495
00:26:48,258 --> 00:26:50,091
Is it bad?

496
00:26:50,126 --> 00:26:51,343
I don't know.

497
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:23,308
Twilight zonewill continue
after station identification.

498
00:27:42,377 --> 00:27:44,245
Thank you.

499
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,247
You sure you're
all right, mister?

500
00:27:46,282 --> 00:27:48,133
Yes, i'm fine now.

501
00:27:48,168 --> 00:27:50,001
I still think you
ought to see a doctor.

502
00:27:50,036 --> 00:27:53,138
No, i'm all right, see?
I'm not even bleeding.

503
00:27:53,173 --> 00:27:56,257
Not on the outside, maybe,
but what about on the inside?

504
00:27:56,292 --> 00:27:57,008
I mean, i've heard
of accidents

505
00:27:57,043 --> 00:27:58,893
where guys are
hurt really bad

506
00:27:58,928 --> 00:27:59,511
and they don't
even know it.

507
00:27:59,546 --> 00:28:00,762
Look, i'm fine.

508
00:28:00,797 --> 00:28:01,396
Well, sure.

509
00:28:01,431 --> 00:28:03,264
All i'm trying
to say is...

510
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:04,766
i'd hate to be responsible

511
00:28:04,801 --> 00:28:06,651
if you started a hemorrhage
or something.

512
00:28:06,686 --> 00:28:07,902
It wasn't my fault.

513
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,522
I mean, you admitted
that yourself,
but even so...

514
00:28:10,557 --> 00:28:13,024
look, i signed a paper
absolving you of any blame.

515
00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:13,658
Isn't that enough?

516
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:16,277
Yeah. Don't get sore, mister.

517
00:28:16,312 --> 00:28:18,163
I'm just worried
about you is all.

518
00:28:18,913 --> 00:28:21,416
Uh, mister?

519
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:24,536
It's none of my business, but...

520
00:28:24,571 --> 00:28:27,038
how come you were wandering
around out there

521
00:28:27,073 --> 00:28:29,541
in the middle of nowhere?

522
00:28:29,576 --> 00:28:32,427
I don't know.

523
00:28:32,462 --> 00:28:35,547
Thank you. I'm sorry
i've caused you any trouble.

524
00:28:35,582 --> 00:28:37,932
Mister, i'm just glad
you're alive.

525
00:29:54,509 --> 00:29:55,760
Yes?

526
00:29:55,795 --> 00:29:57,011
Alan?

527
00:29:57,046 --> 00:30:00,131
Darling, i've been calling
every 15 minutes.

528
00:30:00,166 --> 00:30:01,382
I've been so worried.

529
00:30:01,417 --> 00:30:03,268
What happened?

530
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:07,272
I'm not sure.

531
00:30:07,307 --> 00:30:10,391
Are you all right?

532
00:30:10,426 --> 00:30:12,277
I don't know.

533
00:30:12,312 --> 00:30:14,395
Alan...

534
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:17,649
look, jess, why don't
you just forget about me?

535
00:30:17,684 --> 00:30:19,534
I don't know what's going on.

536
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,537
Listen to me.

537
00:30:22,572 --> 00:30:23,788
I called dr. Matthews

538
00:30:23,823 --> 00:30:27,542
and i made an appointment
for you for tomorrow morning.

539
00:30:27,577 --> 00:30:30,662
I'll be at the hotel
to pick you up at 9:30.

540
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:37,302
You'd do that after
everything that's happened?

541
00:30:37,337 --> 00:30:40,555
Yes, i would.

542
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:43,057
Mr. Talbot, i...

543
00:30:43,092 --> 00:30:46,177
i didn't plan
on falling in love with you,

544
00:30:46,212 --> 00:30:49,314
but i did...

545
00:30:49,349 --> 00:30:51,816
and i'm stuck with it,
for better or for worse.

546
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:58,072
Well, thank you.

547
00:30:58,107 --> 00:31:00,074
Would you like me
to come over now?

548
00:31:00,109 --> 00:31:02,827
No, uh...

549
00:31:02,862 --> 00:31:04,078
uh...

550
00:31:04,113 --> 00:31:07,198
i'll see you
tomorrow morning.

551
00:31:07,233 --> 00:31:08,449
Good night, jess.

552
00:31:08,484 --> 00:31:11,586
Try not to worry, please.

553
00:31:12,837 --> 00:31:14,706
Good night.

554
00:32:45,179 --> 00:32:46,431
Hello, alan.

555
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:58,059
I've been waiting for you.

556
00:33:12,957 --> 00:33:14,208
You real?

557
00:33:14,243 --> 00:33:16,711
Well, that's a matter
of opinion.

558
00:33:16,746 --> 00:33:18,579
I used to think so,
years ago.

559
00:33:18,614 --> 00:33:21,716
Now i'm not so sure.

560
00:33:21,751 --> 00:33:22,967
Sit down, alan,
over there.

561
00:33:23,002 --> 00:33:24,836
I'll pour us
a drink.

562
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:29,590
Go on, sit down.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

563
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:48,609
By the way, you almost killed me
with those scissors.

564
00:33:48,644 --> 00:33:50,495
Did you know that?

565
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:53,614
It's a shame you didn't.

566
00:33:53,649 --> 00:33:58,619
But then nothing
ever works out right for me.

567
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:03,007
See how close it was?

568
00:34:06,761 --> 00:34:08,012
Who are you?

569
00:34:08,047 --> 00:34:09,514
You already know that.
You must.

570
00:34:09,549 --> 00:34:10,765
How else could
you have found me?

571
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,633
I looked you up
in the phone book.

572
00:34:12,668 --> 00:34:15,136
Yeah, but how...

573
00:34:15,171 --> 00:34:17,021
oh, i see.

574
00:34:17,056 --> 00:34:19,524
You've been to coeurville,
haven't you?

575
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:21,392
Yes!

576
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,780
And you know... what?

577
00:34:25,815 --> 00:34:27,148
Your name.

578
00:34:27,183 --> 00:34:28,399
That's all?

579
00:34:28,434 --> 00:34:29,650
That's all.

580
00:34:29,685 --> 00:34:32,787
In that case, you better have
some of that drink.

581
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:51,172
Exactly eight days ago, you
were born here in this house.

582
00:34:51,207 --> 00:34:53,424
What?!

583
00:34:53,459 --> 00:34:56,561
I made the delivery myself.

584
00:35:00,314 --> 00:35:02,183
You're drunk!

585
00:35:02,218 --> 00:35:06,187
A little bit...
but not drunk enough.

586
00:35:06,222 --> 00:35:08,689
Will you join me?

587
00:35:08,724 --> 00:35:10,324
I guarantee
no hangover.

588
00:35:10,359 --> 00:35:12,193
Wasn't that thoughtful
of me?

589
00:35:12,228 --> 00:35:14,695
Look, i'm in no mood
for jokes, mister.

590
00:35:15,329 --> 00:35:15,947
Well, that's a pity,

591
00:35:15,982 --> 00:35:17,832
because this whole thing
is a joke.

592
00:35:17,867 --> 00:35:20,334
Yeah, well, i'm
not laughing.

593
00:35:20,369 --> 00:35:23,454
You will,
because the joke's on me.

594
00:35:23,489 --> 00:35:24,705
Would you get
to the point?

595
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:27,091
Well, you've been to coeurville.

596
00:35:27,126 --> 00:35:29,594
You know that alan talbot
never lived there.

597
00:35:29,629 --> 00:35:32,713
You know you've been behaving
oddly of late.

598
00:35:32,748 --> 00:35:35,216
Judging from that handkerchief
on your arm,

599
00:35:35,251 --> 00:35:38,970
i'd say you know
about that, too.

600
00:35:39,005 --> 00:35:42,356
So, with all
this information,

601
00:35:42,391 --> 00:35:46,110
what do i need to tell you?

602
00:35:46,145 --> 00:35:48,229
Who am i?!

603
00:35:48,264 --> 00:35:52,984
You're nobody, alan,
nobody at all.

604
00:35:53,019 --> 00:35:54,869
Stop it, walter!

605
00:35:54,904 --> 00:35:58,623
Well, whois this watch
i'm wearing? Ask me that!

606
00:35:58,658 --> 00:36:01,125
Whois the refrigerator
in the kitchen?

607
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:04,245
Don't you understand?

608
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,496
No.

609
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:09,884
You're a machine, alan,
a mechanical device.

610
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:13,004
I don't believe it!

611
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:16,140
I don't blame you.
I wouldn't believe it, either.

612
00:36:16,175 --> 00:36:19,260
But it's true.

613
00:36:19,295 --> 00:36:23,014
The fact is, you were born
a long time ago, inside my head.

614
00:36:23,049 --> 00:36:24,899
All kids have dreams,
don't they?

615
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:26,767
Well, you were mine.

616
00:36:26,802 --> 00:36:28,019
The others thought

617
00:36:28,054 --> 00:36:31,155
about joining the army
or flying to mars.

618
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:34,275
They finally grew up
and they forgot their dreams.

619
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:36,777
I didn't.

620
00:36:36,812 --> 00:36:41,782
I thought about one thing
and longed for one thing always.

621
00:36:41,817 --> 00:36:44,919
Just one.

622
00:36:44,954 --> 00:36:46,787
A perfect artificial man.

623
00:36:46,822 --> 00:36:48,422
Not a robot-

624
00:36:48,457 --> 00:36:51,542
a duplicate
of a human being.

625
00:36:53,427 --> 00:36:55,930
Well, it was harmless.

626
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:59,684
Not even very imaginative
for a child.

627
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:03,938
But then i became an adult.

628
00:37:03,973 --> 00:37:07,692
Only somewhere along the line,
i forgot to grow up-

629
00:37:07,727 --> 00:37:10,811
like most geniuses.

630
00:37:10,846 --> 00:37:15,199
I kept my dream.

631
00:37:15,234 --> 00:37:17,068
I created you, alan.

632
00:37:17,103 --> 00:37:18,953
Is that straight enough for you?

633
00:37:20,204 --> 00:37:22,707
You're not only drunk,
you're crazy!

634
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:26,460
How would you explain that?

635
00:37:26,495 --> 00:37:29,580
Why, it's an artificial arm.
I don't know!

636
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,584
You expect me to believe
i'm a machine

637
00:37:33,619 --> 00:37:34,835
when i know i'm not?

638
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:36,087
That's ridiculous!

639
00:37:36,122 --> 00:37:38,589
I eat, i drink, i sleep!

640
00:37:38,624 --> 00:37:41,342
Didn't i tell you
i wanted a perfect creation?

641
00:37:44,979 --> 00:37:46,847
Alan...

642
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:54,739
alan, i want you
to come with me.

643
00:37:54,774 --> 00:37:55,990
Where?

644
00:37:56,025 --> 00:38:00,361
Well, let's call it
the, uh, delivery room.

645
00:38:00,396 --> 00:38:04,749
Don't you want to see
where you were born?

646
00:38:24,935 --> 00:38:26,187
Your birthplace.

647
00:38:30,941 --> 00:38:33,944
Come on.

648
00:39:12,733 --> 00:39:15,736
Turn it off!

649
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:34,004
Over here, alan.

650
00:39:41,762 --> 00:39:44,265
Your brothers.

651
00:39:46,267 --> 00:39:48,519
Alan talbot i...

652
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:52,773
alan talbot ii.

653
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:56,527
Factory rejects.

654
00:39:56,562 --> 00:39:58,396
Any questions?

655
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:02,283
Where did you get the money
for all this?

656
00:40:04,785 --> 00:40:06,654
I told you,
i'm a genius!

657
00:40:06,689 --> 00:40:07,905
When i found out

658
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:09,790
how much i'd need
for my work,

659
00:40:09,825 --> 00:40:11,659
i developed
an improved calculator.

660
00:40:11,694 --> 00:40:14,795
Try electronics turns out
3,000 or 4,000 a year.

661
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:16,046
I get the royalties.

662
00:40:16,081 --> 00:40:18,549
The money was
the least of it.

663
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,919
The failures, though,
they were bad.

664
00:40:21,954 --> 00:40:23,804
I can't tell you how many times
i've failed

665
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:25,673
and had to start over again.

666
00:40:25,708 --> 00:40:28,426
You did this all by yourself?

667
00:40:28,461 --> 00:40:31,178
No, that wouldn't
have been possible.

668
00:40:31,213 --> 00:40:34,932
I'm afraid the day
of the lone inventor has passed.

669
00:40:34,967 --> 00:40:36,567
I had some of the best
scientific minds

670
00:40:36,602 --> 00:40:37,818
in the world
assisting me.

671
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:39,069
But, of course,

672
00:40:39,104 --> 00:40:40,321
they didn't take
the project seriously.

673
00:40:40,356 --> 00:40:42,189
To them,
it was just a game-

674
00:40:42,224 --> 00:40:44,074
a lot of theoretical
wool-gathering.

675
00:40:44,109 --> 00:40:45,326
How would
it be possible

676
00:40:45,361 --> 00:40:47,828
to create an entire
nervous system

677
00:40:47,863 --> 00:40:49,697
that worked like
a real one?

678
00:40:49,732 --> 00:40:50,948
How could the brain
be duplicated

679
00:40:50,983 --> 00:40:53,451
with all its subtleties?

680
00:40:53,486 --> 00:40:57,204
You see, i was after
real intelligence.

681
00:40:57,239 --> 00:40:59,089
Mere reactions weren't enough.

682
00:40:59,124 --> 00:41:00,958
Those mannequins can react.

683
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:04,712
My creation had
to have a memory.

684
00:41:05,346 --> 00:41:08,466
He had to have
abstract reasoning power,

685
00:41:08,501 --> 00:41:10,351
a past, a personality.

686
00:41:10,386 --> 00:41:12,853
Millions
of intricate facets

687
00:41:12,888 --> 00:41:14,722
multiplied by millions

688
00:41:14,757 --> 00:41:17,224
to make true intelligence.

689
00:41:17,259 --> 00:41:19,109
Now...

690
00:41:19,144 --> 00:41:21,612
to accomplish this
from the beginning

691
00:41:21,647 --> 00:41:24,114
would have been
impossible.

692
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,734
I don't know
what you're talking about.

693
00:41:26,769 --> 00:41:29,236
What do you mean,
you decided to use yourself?

694
00:41:29,271 --> 00:41:30,371
Just that.

695
00:41:30,406 --> 00:41:33,491
In certain of your cells,
i made certain impressions.

696
00:41:33,526 --> 00:41:35,993
My own memories went
into the cells.

697
00:41:36,028 --> 00:41:38,496
Some of my talents,
some of my knowledge-

698
00:41:38,531 --> 00:41:40,381
bits and pieces of myself.

699
00:41:40,416 --> 00:41:43,501
So now you're telling me
that i'm you?

700
00:41:43,536 --> 00:41:45,002
That's right.

701
00:41:45,037 --> 00:41:48,889
Well, that's impossible.
I'm me! This is my flesh!

702
00:41:50,891 --> 00:41:53,394
Nonconductive plastic.

703
00:41:53,429 --> 00:41:58,399
I admit, it feels like flesh...
but then, that was the idea.

704
00:41:58,434 --> 00:42:00,901
You see, i cushioned
the mechanical parts

705
00:42:00,936 --> 00:42:04,021
with a foam layer,
and then i worked out a...

706
00:42:04,056 --> 00:42:06,524
but that's not what you want
to hear, is it?

707
00:42:08,409 --> 00:42:10,277
You lived in coeurville?

708
00:42:10,312 --> 00:42:11,529
Yes.

709
00:42:11,564 --> 00:42:14,665
For your past, i gave you
my memories of the town.

710
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:17,167
Some of them must have been
inaccurate and incomplete.

711
00:42:17,202 --> 00:42:19,036
I left coeurville 20 years ago.

712
00:42:19,071 --> 00:42:22,172
Going there must have been
quite an experience.

713
00:42:22,207 --> 00:42:24,675
Yeah, it was.

714
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:27,177
What about the university?

715
00:42:27,212 --> 00:42:30,297
Fictitious.
I had to give you a job.

716
00:42:30,332 --> 00:42:31,549
Well, aunt mildred!

717
00:42:32,182 --> 00:42:35,302
All the old ladies
i've ever known rolled into one.

718
00:42:35,936 --> 00:42:39,056
After my parents died,
i lived alone.

719
00:42:39,091 --> 00:42:47,197
The reputation as a don juan is,
i regret to say, imaginary.

720
00:42:47,232 --> 00:42:49,066
Well, that's about it, alan.

721
00:42:49,101 --> 00:42:50,951
The rest you can fill in,
up to last week, anyway.

722
00:42:50,986 --> 00:42:52,202
What about last week?

723
00:42:52,237 --> 00:42:55,956
I wish i knew.
Something went wrong.

724
00:42:55,991 --> 00:42:57,207
I couldn't understand.

725
00:42:57,242 --> 00:42:59,076
You suddenly attacked me
with a pair of scissors

726
00:42:59,111 --> 00:43:00,961
and then ran away.

727
00:43:00,996 --> 00:43:03,464
As you know, i've been unable
to find you since.

728
00:43:03,499 --> 00:43:05,332
What's wrong with me?

729
00:43:05,367 --> 00:43:07,217
I'm not sure.

730
00:43:07,252 --> 00:43:09,720
Whatever it is,
it's wrong with me, too.

731
00:43:09,755 --> 00:43:12,840
We're all potential murderers,
alan, all of us.

732
00:43:12,875 --> 00:43:16,594
But if we're normal, we're
protected by our inhibitions.

733
00:43:16,629 --> 00:43:19,096
You've wanted to kill?

734
00:43:19,131 --> 00:43:20,347
Of course. Everybody has.

735
00:43:20,382 --> 00:43:24,101
But my own inhibitions
have held my impulses in check.

736
00:43:24,735 --> 00:43:27,855
I couldn't kill, no matter
how much i might want to.

737
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:29,740
So what are you saying?

738
00:43:29,775 --> 00:43:31,609
With you, something
went wrong.

739
00:43:32,242 --> 00:43:35,362
To put it even clearer, alan,
you're insane.

740
00:43:42,252 --> 00:43:44,121
Can i be treated?

741
00:43:44,156 --> 00:43:46,006
Repaired, you mean?

742
00:43:46,041 --> 00:43:47,257
I don't know.

743
00:43:47,292 --> 00:43:49,126
Why not?

744
00:43:49,161 --> 00:43:50,377
Well, as much
as i hate to admit it,

745
00:43:51,011 --> 00:43:52,880
luck had a great deal
to do with your creation.

746
00:43:52,915 --> 00:43:54,131
Skill alone wasn't enough.

747
00:43:55,382 --> 00:43:56,634
You saying i'm an accident?

748
00:43:56,669 --> 00:43:57,885
I'm afraid so.

749
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:01,639
You see, alan, i was like
a blind man with a machine gun.

750
00:44:02,272 --> 00:44:04,775
I kept firing
and reloading and firing,

751
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:06,644
and finally i hit the target,
but it was off-center.

752
00:44:06,679 --> 00:44:08,529
I don't even know
if i could come close again.

753
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:10,531
That's the story
of my life,

754
00:44:10,566 --> 00:44:11,782
right down the line.

755
00:44:11,817 --> 00:44:14,284
Success
in the little things.

756
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:16,787
Failure
in the big ones.

757
00:44:16,822 --> 00:44:18,656
I told myself
i wanted to make

758
00:44:18,691 --> 00:44:21,158
an artificial man,
but i think

759
00:44:21,193 --> 00:44:23,661
what i really wanted
was to build

760
00:44:23,696 --> 00:44:26,163
another walter ryder-

761
00:44:26,198 --> 00:44:28,666
only without
the drawbacks.

762
00:44:28,701 --> 00:44:31,168
Sort of a reverse
jekyll and hyde.

763
00:44:31,203 --> 00:44:34,922
Everything i wished i was,
my creation would be.

764
00:44:34,957 --> 00:44:37,424
Where i was shy,
he would be aggressive.

765
00:44:37,459 --> 00:44:41,812
Where i was cold and withdrawn,
he would be warm and outgoing.

766
00:44:41,847 --> 00:44:44,314
Loneliness would
be unknown to him.

767
00:44:44,349 --> 00:44:48,068
Disease and pain
and death- all unknown.

768
00:44:48,103 --> 00:44:49,937
He would be unselfish.

769
00:44:49,972 --> 00:44:53,691
He would be ambitious
but not fanatical.

770
00:44:53,726 --> 00:44:56,827
And, oh, alan,
he would be perfect!

771
00:44:56,862 --> 00:44:58,696
That was my dream:

772
00:44:58,731 --> 00:45:00,581
A perfect version
of myself.

773
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:03,834
I ought to kill you.

774
00:45:06,336 --> 00:45:11,341
That's right. You should.

775
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:14,595
There's somebody else,
walter- a girl.

776
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:16,597
We were going to be
married next week.

777
00:45:16,632 --> 00:45:17,848
Is she pretty?

778
00:45:17,883 --> 00:45:20,350
Pretty, intelligent...

779
00:45:20,385 --> 00:45:22,219
and lonely-

780
00:45:22,254 --> 00:45:24,104
something you ought
to be able to understand.

781
00:45:27,107 --> 00:45:28,358
I'm sorry, alan.

782
00:45:28,393 --> 00:45:31,478
Well, that's
a great consolation.

783
00:45:31,513 --> 00:45:33,981
You sure you can't fix me?

784
00:45:34,016 --> 00:45:36,984
Even if i could,
it wouldn't solve your problems.

785
00:45:37,019 --> 00:45:38,869
The girl would find out
eventually.

786
00:45:38,904 --> 00:45:39,737
How?

787
00:45:39,772 --> 00:45:43,490
Well, for one thing, she would
grow old and you wouldn't.

788
00:45:43,525 --> 00:45:44,742
For another, being a machine,

789
00:45:44,777 --> 00:45:46,627
you would suffer
a breakdown someday.

790
00:45:46,662 --> 00:45:49,747
All of these things
never occurred to you?

791
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:54,885
I guess i didn't really think
i'd succeed as well as i did.

792
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,637
What does
it matter anyway?

793
00:45:56,672 --> 00:45:57,888
There's nothing
that can be done.

794
00:45:57,923 --> 00:45:59,139
Yes, there is.

795
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:01,642
You're going to create

796
00:46:01,677 --> 00:46:02,893
another alan talbot.

797
00:46:02,928 --> 00:46:05,395
No, i just told you!

798
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:07,898
You heard me-
another alan talbot!

799
00:46:07,933 --> 00:46:10,651
Only this one's going
to be right.

800
00:46:10,686 --> 00:46:12,519
And he's going to walk
out of here tonight,

801
00:46:12,554 --> 00:46:14,404
and he's going to marry
a girl named jess,

802
00:46:14,439 --> 00:46:16,907
and for the first time
in his miserable life,

803
00:46:16,942 --> 00:46:18,776
he's going to be happy.

804
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:21,278
Well, i don't understand.

805
00:46:21,313 --> 00:46:23,030
You give me
a pencil.

806
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:30,537
Now, this is
her name...

807
00:46:30,572 --> 00:46:32,422
and address.

808
00:46:32,457 --> 00:46:33,674
She said she
would meet me

809
00:46:33,709 --> 00:46:36,176
at 9:30 in
the morning,

810
00:46:36,211 --> 00:46:39,296
but she'll
be home now.

811
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:56,196
What's the matter, alan?
What is it?

812
00:47:03,203 --> 00:47:04,454
Now, you take it.

813
00:47:04,489 --> 00:47:06,957
Take it and get out... now.

814
00:47:07,574 --> 00:47:08,208
And hurry!

815
00:47:10,112 --> 00:47:11,962
Alan...

816
00:47:11,997 --> 00:47:13,213
alan?

817
00:47:55,290 --> 00:47:57,124
Just a minute.

818
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:02,763
Who is it?

819
00:48:02,798 --> 00:48:04,014
I'm sorry to
bother you, ma'am,

820
00:48:04,049 --> 00:48:05,883
but, uh, see,
like, i belong

821
00:48:05,918 --> 00:48:09,019
to the junior
woodchucks,
and, uh...

822
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:17,394
come in, alan.

823
00:48:28,038 --> 00:48:30,540
Why are you looking
at me like that?

824
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:35,545
I don't know.

825
00:48:38,048 --> 00:48:40,550
I've been so worried.

826
00:48:40,585 --> 00:48:43,053
After yesterday, i didn't-

827
00:48:43,088 --> 00:48:44,922
forget yesterday.

828
00:48:44,957 --> 00:48:46,807
Whatever happened,
forget that.

829
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:49,309
Oh, but, alan...

830
00:48:49,344 --> 00:48:50,560
please?

831
00:48:50,595 --> 00:48:53,680
We just had a rotten nightmare,
that's all.

832
00:48:53,715 --> 00:48:57,434
Now we're awake, and
everything's going to be fine.

833
00:48:57,469 --> 00:48:59,319
Will you try to believe that?

834
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:02,439
Do you?

835
00:49:02,474 --> 00:49:05,325
Yes.

836
00:49:09,079 --> 00:49:10,948
Okay.

837
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:14,084
Then so do i.

838
00:49:14,119 --> 00:49:18,455
If you promise
to tell me about it someday.

839
00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:20,958
I promise, someday.

840
00:49:20,993 --> 00:49:24,094
Now, will you fix
me a cup of coffee?

841
00:49:24,129 --> 00:49:25,963
Sure.

842
00:49:25,998 --> 00:49:30,600
Would you like something to eat?

843
00:49:30,635 --> 00:49:33,720
How about a couple of mother
connelly's hand-fried eggs?

844
00:49:33,755 --> 00:49:34,972
They're guaranteed

845
00:49:35,007 --> 00:49:36,857
to make a new man
out of you.

846
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:43,113
Thank you.

847
00:49:57,494 --> 00:49:59,379
In a way it can be said

848
00:49:59,414 --> 00:50:02,499
that walter ryder succeeded
in his life's ambition,

849
00:50:02,534 --> 00:50:05,635
even though the man he created
was, after all, himself.

850
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:09,389
There may be easier ways
to self-improvement,

851
00:50:09,424 --> 00:50:11,258
but sometimes it happens
that the shortest distance

852
00:50:11,293 --> 00:50:15,012
between two points
is a crooked line

853
00:50:15,047 --> 00:50:17,514
through the twilight zone.

854
00:50:22,052 --> 00:50:23,270
The ingredients:

855
00:50:23,305 --> 00:50:25,772
An american destroyer,
the pacific ocean,

856
00:50:25,807 --> 00:50:29,526
and a ghostly sound of hammering
from 30 fathoms below.

857
00:50:29,561 --> 00:50:33,914
They add up to a strange tale
of the bizarre and nightmarish.

858
00:50:33,949 --> 00:50:35,782
Mike kellin
and simon oakland star

859
00:50:35,817 --> 00:50:38,285
in a very different kind
oftwilight zone

860
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:42,039
which we call
"the thirty fathom grave.

861
00:50:49,214 --> 00:50:52,182
Ain't that a kick
in the head.

862
00:50:52,217 --> 00:50:53,433
What do you
suppose it is?

863
00:50:53,468 --> 00:50:56,553
Ghosts, man, ghosts.

864
00:50:56,588 --> 00:50:59,689
Here it is,
7-1-4.

865
00:50:59,724 --> 00:51:04,061
"Commissioned

866
00:51:04,096 --> 00:51:07,197
