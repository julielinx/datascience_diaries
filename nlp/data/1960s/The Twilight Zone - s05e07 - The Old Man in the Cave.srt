1
00:00:06,606 --> 00:00:09,726
You unlock this door
with the key of imagination.

2
00:00:09,761 --> 00:00:12,112
Beyond it is
another dimension-

3
00:00:12,147 --> 00:00:14,614
a dimension of sound,

4
00:00:14,649 --> 00:00:16,483
a dimension of sight,

5
00:00:16,518 --> 00:00:18,368
a dimension of mind.

6
00:00:18,403 --> 00:00:21,488
You're moving into a land
of both shadow and substance,

7
00:00:21,523 --> 00:00:23,373
of things and ideas.

8
00:00:23,408 --> 00:00:26,493
You've just crossed over
into the twilight zone.

9
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:54,654
Been to the
cave, jason?

10
00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:56,523
Did you see
goldsmith?

11
00:00:56,558 --> 00:00:58,408
Did he talk
to the old man?

12
00:00:58,443 --> 00:01:00,276
Goldsmith's
still up there.

13
00:01:00,311 --> 00:01:00,910
He said
to tell you

14
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:04,030
he's getting a message
from the old man.

15
00:01:04,065 --> 00:01:06,533
He'll bring it down with
him in a few minutes.

16
00:01:06,568 --> 00:01:09,035
Is he asking
about this food?

17
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,537
It's all pre-bomb,
all of it.

18
00:01:10,572 --> 00:01:12,422
It's safe as anything.

19
00:01:12,457 --> 00:01:13,423
Why do we have
to keep waiting

20
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:14,674
for the old man?

21
00:01:14,709 --> 00:01:17,177
Why don't we just take
our chances with it?

22
00:01:17,212 --> 00:01:18,795
We already
took chances.

23
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:19,429
The old man told us

24
00:01:19,464 --> 00:01:21,931
not to plant on
the north acreage;

25
00:01:21,966 --> 00:01:23,183
that it was
poisonous.

26
00:01:23,218 --> 00:01:24,434
This is what came up.

27
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:30,690
Did these grow, evie,

28
00:01:31,307 --> 00:01:35,061
or did somebody leave
them to us in a will?

29
00:01:35,096 --> 00:01:36,312
They were the best.

30
00:01:36,347 --> 00:01:38,198
The best?!

31
00:01:39,449 --> 00:01:41,317
Hate to see the worst!

32
00:01:45,071 --> 00:01:47,574
I don't think we ought
to eat those, evie.

33
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:50,710
I say we just better
bury them with honors.

34
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:55,715
That's what goldsmith
went to the cave for-

35
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,584
to ask the old man

36
00:01:57,619 --> 00:02:00,086
what land we should
try this time.

37
00:02:00,121 --> 00:02:01,971
The old man, indeed.

38
00:02:02,006 --> 00:02:05,091
Who knows where he gets
his omniscient knowledge,

39
00:02:05,126 --> 00:02:06,976
but evie's right.

40
00:02:07,011 --> 00:02:09,979
He knows
about land.

41
00:02:10,014 --> 00:02:12,482
Remember those tomatoes
that came up?

42
00:02:12,517 --> 00:02:14,984
You remember he sent
a message to goldsmith,

43
00:02:15,019 --> 00:02:16,236
telling usnotto plant them?

44
00:02:16,271 --> 00:02:19,105
Oh... they were monstrous.

45
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,609
Like... rotten watermelons.

46
00:02:22,644 --> 00:02:24,494
They tasted...

47
00:02:24,529 --> 00:02:25,745
but, jason,

48
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,497
all of this stuff's pre-bomb.

49
00:02:27,532 --> 00:02:28,748
I just know it.

50
00:02:28,783 --> 00:02:30,500
Let's wait for goldsmith.

51
00:02:30,535 --> 00:02:33,620
See what the old man has to say.

52
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,515
What about
the food?

53
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:48,017
Wait till goldsmith
gets back from the cave.

54
00:02:48,052 --> 00:02:49,886
Wait till he has a chance
to ask the old man.

55
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:52,388
I'm surprised
at you, all of you.

56
00:02:52,423 --> 00:02:56,142
Man doesn't live by bread
or canned food alone,

57
00:02:56,177 --> 00:02:58,645
or freak carrots,
or mutated tomatoes.

58
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:01,147
But do me a favor,
will you?

59
00:03:01,182 --> 00:03:04,284
Don't ask me what
hedoeslive by.

60
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:11,157
In this tenth illustrious
year after the bomb,

61
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,660
i wouldn't be able
to tell you.

62
00:03:13,695 --> 00:03:15,161
Announcement!

63
00:03:15,196 --> 00:03:17,046
I have an
announcement.

64
00:03:19,549 --> 00:03:21,417
We've just had
communication

65
00:03:21,452 --> 00:03:23,303
from the old man
in the cave.

66
00:03:23,338 --> 00:03:25,805
There's an 80% possibility
of rain tomorrow.

67
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,674
The wind's from the northeast.

68
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:29,425
This means that
there will likely be

69
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:32,562
a very high radioactive count
in the precipitation.

70
00:03:32,597 --> 00:03:34,931
Now place all rain
barrels upside down,

71
00:03:34,966 --> 00:03:37,433
and keep all
water troughs
covered.

72
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:41,187
As to the canned goods there,

73
00:03:41,222 --> 00:03:45,325
the old man says that
they're contaminated

74
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,827
and should be
destroyed.

75
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:50,947
What you're looking at

76
00:03:50,982 --> 00:03:52,832
is a legacy
that man left to himself.

77
00:03:52,867 --> 00:03:55,335
A decade previous,
he pushed his buttons

78
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:58,338
and a nightmarish moment later
woke up to find

79
00:03:58,373 --> 00:04:01,841
that he had set the clock back
a thousand years.

80
00:04:01,876 --> 00:04:04,961
His engines, his medicines,
his science

81
00:04:04,996 --> 00:04:06,846
were buried in a mass tomb

82
00:04:06,881 --> 00:04:09,966
covered over by the biggest
gravedigger of them all-

83
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,468
a bomb.

84
00:04:12,503 --> 00:04:14,971
And this is the earth,
ten years later,

85
00:04:15,006 --> 00:04:17,473
a fragment of
what was once a whole,

86
00:04:17,508 --> 00:04:19,359
a remnant of
what was once a race.

87
00:04:19,394 --> 00:04:24,981
The year is 1974,
and this is the twilight zone.

88
00:05:12,195 --> 00:05:14,697
Do you have anyone in charge?

89
00:05:14,732 --> 00:05:16,833
I'm in charge.

90
00:05:16,868 --> 00:05:18,951
Do you have a name?

91
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:21,838
Goldsmith.

92
00:05:21,873 --> 00:05:23,339
Hmm.

93
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:28,961
This place-

94
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:30,213
does it have a name?

95
00:05:30,248 --> 00:05:33,349
And if it does... major?

96
00:05:33,384 --> 00:05:35,718
If it does, father,
we'd like to hear it.

97
00:05:35,753 --> 00:05:37,470
Uh... who are you?

98
00:05:37,505 --> 00:05:39,355
Major french is my name.

99
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,606
Central states commander.

100
00:05:40,641 --> 00:05:42,475
We're being sent around
to organize.

101
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,726
Organize?

102
00:05:43,761 --> 00:05:45,611
Yes, that's what i said.

103
00:05:45,646 --> 00:05:48,731
Now, how many people
do you have here?

104
00:05:48,766 --> 00:05:51,234
We haven't counted lately.

105
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:53,736
What about food?

106
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:55,621
There's sufficient.

107
00:05:55,656 --> 00:05:56,873
Hmm.

108
00:05:56,908 --> 00:05:58,124
You grow your own?

109
00:05:58,159 --> 00:05:59,992
Some.

110
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:04,380
We have a supply of prewar
canned goods left over.

111
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:07,383
We'll need some quarters.

112
00:06:07,418 --> 00:06:09,252
Harber, have a look around.

113
00:06:09,287 --> 00:06:11,137
Douglas, you stay with the jeep.

114
00:06:11,172 --> 00:06:12,388
Furman...

115
00:06:12,423 --> 00:06:14,891
stay with me.

116
00:06:17,393 --> 00:06:20,513
Major, uh,
what do you want?

117
00:06:20,548 --> 00:06:21,764
Painless things.

118
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:24,267
We'd like quarters
for the four of us,

119
00:06:24,302 --> 00:06:26,769
rations for as
long as we're here

120
00:06:26,804 --> 00:06:28,654
and no trouble.

121
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:29,906
That last part-

122
00:06:29,941 --> 00:06:31,774
no trouble.

123
00:06:31,809 --> 00:06:34,277
I don't think you
understand, major.

124
00:06:34,312 --> 00:06:36,779
We don't recognize
your authority here.

125
00:06:36,814 --> 00:06:39,916
We've had transients
pass through on occasion,

126
00:06:39,951 --> 00:06:41,784
but they didn't stay.

127
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:44,537
Like you, they represented
themselves as authorities,

128
00:06:44,572 --> 00:06:48,291
but we discovered they carried
their headquarters with them.

129
00:06:48,326 --> 00:06:51,427
They represented
no one but themselves.

130
00:06:51,462 --> 00:06:54,547
Well, this is a new breed,
mr. Goldsmith.

131
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:57,183
This whole area will
be organized now.

132
00:06:57,218 --> 00:06:59,685
It will be set up
into military sectors,

133
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:04,690
each controlled by
a local constabulary-

134
00:07:04,725 --> 00:07:05,942
yours truly.

135
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:08,444
Well, you and
your constabulary

136
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,564
can remain overnight
and we'll be glad

137
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,449
to share our
food with you,

138
00:07:13,484 --> 00:07:14,066
bed you down.

139
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,068
Tomorrow morning, you'd better

140
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:17,954
do your organizing
somewhere else.

141
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:23,576
Mr. Goldsmith,
the following is unofficial.

142
00:07:23,611 --> 00:07:27,330
Now, we'd like you
to make your transition here

143
00:07:27,365 --> 00:07:28,581
as easy as possible.

144
00:07:28,616 --> 00:07:31,083
Now, under certain
circumstances,

145
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:33,586
we might even
allow you to remain

146
00:07:33,621 --> 00:07:34,837
in nominal control.

147
00:07:34,872 --> 00:07:38,341
That's assuming that you
don't give us any trouble.

148
00:07:38,376 --> 00:07:40,226
Now, that's unofficial.

149
00:07:40,261 --> 00:07:42,478
The following is official.

150
00:07:50,987 --> 00:07:55,992
Now, let me fill you in on the
situation here, mr. Goldsmith.

151
00:07:56,027 --> 00:07:58,611
Between buffalo, new york,
and atlanta, georgia,

152
00:07:58,646 --> 00:08:01,747
there are probably
around 500 people alive.

153
00:08:01,782 --> 00:08:02,999
You know why.

154
00:08:03,034 --> 00:08:04,867
Because there's
no authority,

155
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:06,118
there's
no discipline.

156
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:08,004
We're here to
give you both.

157
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:10,506
And if you give us any trouble-

158
00:08:10,873 --> 00:08:12,758
any trouble
atall-

159
00:08:12,793 --> 00:08:16,379
i'm going to hang you

160
00:08:16,414 --> 00:08:18,881
from that balcony
right over there.

161
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:30,393
Well, now, what about
it, mr. Goldsmith?

162
00:08:30,428 --> 00:08:32,278
You want
to cooperate

163
00:08:32,313 --> 00:08:34,146
or do you want
your neck broken?

164
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,283
We already have
an authority.

165
00:08:37,318 --> 00:08:40,036
We've had him
for better than ten years.

166
00:08:40,071 --> 00:08:40,653
Whatisall this?

167
00:08:40,688 --> 00:08:41,904
Poison.

168
00:08:41,939 --> 00:08:44,407
It's contaminated
food.

169
00:08:44,907 --> 00:08:46,158
Who says so?

170
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:49,295
The old man
in the cave.

171
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:55,918
A, uh, old man
in a cave...

172
00:09:01,057 --> 00:09:02,925
have any of you looked
at yourselves

173
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,810
in the mirror lately?

174
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:08,564
You all look like skeletons,
you know that?

175
00:09:08,599 --> 00:09:09,815
Just like skeletons.

176
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:12,935
Where is this old man
who keeps you on a diet?

177
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,186
When does he come out?

178
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:16,072
He never
comes out.

179
00:09:16,107 --> 00:09:17,940
He stays
in the cave.

180
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:21,694
Well, i'm not surprised,
mr. Goldsmith.

181
00:09:21,729 --> 00:09:23,579
I'm not surprised at all.

182
00:09:23,614 --> 00:09:26,949
Off lake erie, we've got a pack
of weirdies up there

183
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:28,834
that bay at the moon
once a week.

184
00:09:28,869 --> 00:09:30,703
And then around
what used to be chicago,

185
00:09:30,738 --> 00:09:33,839
man, we got a real
swinging cult going there.

186
00:09:33,874 --> 00:09:36,342
They've built themselves
a statue

187
00:09:36,377 --> 00:09:38,210
made out of fissionable lead.

188
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:40,096
This is their deity.

189
00:09:40,963 --> 00:09:41,714
What do we have here?

190
00:09:41,749 --> 00:09:44,216
We have an invisible
old man in a cave.

191
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:45,468
Now, come on, mr. Goldsmith.

192
00:09:45,503 --> 00:09:47,353
Now, when you take it out

193
00:09:47,388 --> 00:09:49,855
and run it around the block
a couple of times,

194
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:51,724
don't you think
it sounds kind of nutty?

195
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:54,226
We've survived, major french.

196
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:56,112
The rest of the world has died

197
00:09:56,147 --> 00:09:59,231
of radioactivity,
strontium 90, plague.

198
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:00,483
We survived.

199
00:10:00,518 --> 00:10:02,368
Because of the old man, huh?

200
00:10:02,403 --> 00:10:05,237
That's right,
because of the old man.

201
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:06,489
He cues you in, huh?

202
00:10:06,524 --> 00:10:08,374
He tells you
what's poisonous,

203
00:10:08,409 --> 00:10:10,876
what's radioactive,
that whole bit?

204
00:10:10,911 --> 00:10:13,996
As long as he's alive,
we'll be alive.

205
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:19,385
Do you know something?

206
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,253
Now, i don't think any of you

207
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:23,139
are going to die
of radioactivity.

208
00:10:23,174 --> 00:10:26,258
I think if you're going to kick
off, you're going to kick off

209
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:29,395
either from malnutrition
or from being conned to death.

210
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:34,266
If that's true, major, at least
it'll be a painless death.

211
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:35,518
Mr. Goldsmith,

212
00:10:35,553 --> 00:10:37,770
check this.

213
00:10:37,805 --> 00:10:40,272
The booking odds are as follows.

214
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:43,909
500 to one that your old man
is a soft-in-the-head hermit

215
00:10:43,944 --> 00:10:46,412
who doesn't even know
what year it is.

216
00:10:46,447 --> 00:10:48,914
That's not for us to say.

217
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:51,167
That's for you toask!

218
00:10:51,202 --> 00:10:53,035
All of you!

219
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:59,291
Friends, romans, farm animals,
we are now going up to the cave

220
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:01,794
and check your favorite recluse.

221
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:05,548
We're going to bring him
out in the sunshine

222
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:08,684
and get a good look at him.

223
00:11:08,719 --> 00:11:10,553
And then we're going to decide

224
00:11:10,588 --> 00:11:12,438
if he's worthwhile
keeping alive.

225
00:11:12,473 --> 00:11:14,940
Come on, you're
coming with us.

226
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:31,574
All right, goldsmith,

227
00:11:31,609 --> 00:11:34,076
do you want to
tell us about this?

228
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:35,327
How do you open it?

229
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:36,579
I don't know.

230
00:11:36,614 --> 00:11:38,964
To my knowledge, it's
never been opened.

231
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:42,084
But the old man
lives inside, right?

232
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:44,837
How does helive?

233
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:47,339
How does he stay alive?

234
00:11:48,591 --> 00:11:49,842
I don't know.

235
00:11:49,877 --> 00:11:51,727
How do you know
he'sinthere?

236
00:11:51,762 --> 00:11:53,846
How do you communicate with him?

237
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:57,733
He sends out
notes... messages.

238
00:11:59,235 --> 00:12:02,988
He sends out notes and messages.

239
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:09,495
Well, gentlemen,
we really have a prize here.

240
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:11,363
We get the blue ribbon for this.

241
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:16,368
An idiot leading
the idiots.

242
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,873
Douglas, throw me
that hand grenade.

243
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:27,379
You people better
make some tracks.

244
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:29,882
Might make
your eyes smart.

245
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:03,799
Old man, this is
just the beginning!

246
00:13:03,834 --> 00:13:06,302
You hear?!

247
00:13:06,337 --> 00:13:07,553
Just the beginning.

248
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:24,570
Douglas...

249
00:13:24,605 --> 00:13:25,821
car.

250
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:32,695
Don't take
this food out.

251
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:34,580
You hear, it's
contaminated.

252
00:13:34,615 --> 00:13:35,831
Sure, mr. Goldsmith.

253
00:13:35,866 --> 00:13:37,833
Stop it! Listen
to me, all of you.

254
00:13:37,868 --> 00:13:39,335
Listen to me!

255
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:42,204
There's every possibility
that all of those cans

256
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:44,089
contain enough strontium 90

257
00:13:44,124 --> 00:13:47,209
to kill every man, woman
and child in this village.

258
00:14:54,777 --> 00:14:56,662
Oh, come on, mr. Goldsmith,

259
00:14:56,697 --> 00:15:00,416
why don't you tell us how
disappointed you are, huh?

260
00:15:00,451 --> 00:15:06,038
Oh, mr. Goldsmith,
you are kooky, you know that?

261
00:15:06,073 --> 00:15:08,540
You've got enough food
in that pile over there

262
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:09,792
to feed us all
for a good long time.

263
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:13,545
There's enough poison
in those cans

264
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,048
to kill us all
in ten days.

265
00:15:17,933 --> 00:15:20,436
Most of it was canned
after the bomb.

266
00:15:20,471 --> 00:15:22,304
We've no idea
where it came from;

267
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:23,555
who processed it.

268
00:15:25,307 --> 00:15:29,695
All right, let's lay it on
the line there, mr. Goldsmith.

269
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:33,449
Here, now.

270
00:15:33,484 --> 00:15:34,566
Come on,
who'd like

271
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:37,069
a nice square meal
for a change, huh?

272
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:38,320
Anybody else?
Dig in.

273
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:40,823
Okay, anybody else
want to continue

274
00:15:40,858 --> 00:15:42,708
to play
kindergarten games

275
00:15:42,743 --> 00:15:44,576
with mr. Goldsmith here,

276
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:47,079
go home
and chew on an old bone.

277
00:15:48,964 --> 00:15:50,966
No, don't be fools!

278
00:15:51,001 --> 00:15:52,468
Don't commit suicide!

279
00:15:52,503 --> 00:15:54,970
Don't let these pack rats
invade our homes,

280
00:15:55,005 --> 00:15:56,839
turn order upside down!

281
00:15:56,874 --> 00:15:58,340
Stop it, stop it!

282
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,225
Don't eat the food.

283
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,094
Hey, look
at this!

284
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:03,979
We just repealed prohibition!

285
00:16:34,376 --> 00:16:36,879
Just like christmas, huh?

286
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:40,632
Like thanksgiving.

287
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:43,135
Yeah, thanksgiving, too.

288
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:47,523
What's your name?

289
00:16:47,558 --> 00:16:48,774
Jason.

290
00:16:48,809 --> 00:16:51,276
Jason?

291
00:16:51,311 --> 00:16:53,779
Jason and the golden fleece.

292
00:16:53,814 --> 00:16:56,899
Yeah, i'm a literate man,
you know that?

293
00:16:56,934 --> 00:16:59,401
I went to college, jason.

294
00:16:59,436 --> 00:17:02,538
Yeah, i went to college.

295
00:17:04,406 --> 00:17:06,291
What did
you learn?

296
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:13,165
Well, if it isn't the
illustrious mr. Goldsmith,

297
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,919
keeper of the legend,
protector of the fables,

298
00:17:16,954 --> 00:17:20,055
and the lord, high
chamberlain of the cave.

299
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:23,559
You look hungry,
mr. Goldsmith.

300
00:17:23,594 --> 00:17:25,427
And thirsty.

301
00:17:29,099 --> 00:17:31,567
You've got 100 cases
of that stuff over there.

302
00:17:31,602 --> 00:17:34,069
Now, you want to break
every bottle, man,

303
00:17:34,104 --> 00:17:35,320
you've got a big job.

304
00:17:35,355 --> 00:17:39,074
Do you have any remote idea what
you've brought to this village?

305
00:17:39,109 --> 00:17:40,943
Yeah.

306
00:17:40,978 --> 00:17:42,828
Yeah, i brought
into this village

307
00:17:42,863 --> 00:17:44,079
the first square meal

308
00:17:44,114 --> 00:17:47,199
that any of these people
have had in ten years.

309
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:51,587
And the first six protracted
hours of enjoyment

310
00:17:51,622 --> 00:17:53,455
that any of them
have had since...

311
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,706
you started
leading them

312
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:55,958
around by
the nose.

313
00:17:55,993 --> 00:17:58,460
Now, why don't you
unbend, old man?

314
00:17:58,495 --> 00:18:00,345
Can you answer me that?

315
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,597
Why don't you unbend?

316
00:18:01,632 --> 00:18:04,716
You came as intruders,

317
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:06,602
but now you're murderers.

318
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:10,355
Only god knows
how many people

319
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:12,224
will die because
of tonight.

320
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:14,109
The old man
in the cave warned us

321
00:18:14,144 --> 00:18:15,978
about this food dozens of times.

322
00:18:16,013 --> 00:18:17,863
He warned us.

323
00:18:17,898 --> 00:18:21,617
Old man
in the cave!

324
00:18:21,652 --> 00:18:24,119
The old man in a cave!

325
00:18:24,154 --> 00:18:26,622
Now hear this!

326
00:18:29,124 --> 00:18:32,878
There is no old man in the cave!

327
00:18:32,913 --> 00:18:35,998
He's a lie!

328
00:18:36,033 --> 00:18:37,249
He's a concoction.

329
00:18:37,284 --> 00:18:40,385
Nobody's seen him,
nobody's heard him,

330
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:43,505
nobody knows who he is,
or where he's from.

331
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,756
You made him up.

332
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,642
You cut him
out of whole cloth!

333
00:18:46,677 --> 00:18:49,761
Now, i don't know what
your graft is, goldsmith...

334
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:51,647
i don't know
how you get paid off,

335
00:18:51,682 --> 00:18:53,515
but i do know
that it's time

336
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:56,652
you let these people know
what's in that cave.

337
00:18:56,687 --> 00:18:59,771
Open the cave,
goldsmith.

338
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:06,028
You'll have to
kill me first.

339
00:19:11,033 --> 00:19:15,420
Mister, i have killed
a hundred times you.

340
00:19:15,455 --> 00:19:18,540
That's how
i've stayed alive.

341
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:21,677
Jason, gather up

342
00:19:21,712 --> 00:19:22,678
your people

343
00:19:22,713 --> 00:19:25,047
and we're going up
to the cave.

344
00:19:27,049 --> 00:19:28,300
He'll open it for us.

345
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:30,435
Harber, follow me.

346
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,304
Everybody!

347
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:35,440
Everybody,
he's going up to the cave.

348
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:42,948
Get him out of there!

349
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:50,455
Please, please,
all of you, listen.

350
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:51,707
Listen to me.

351
00:19:51,742 --> 00:19:54,826
There's no reason,
no reason under the sun

352
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,329
why this cave
must be opened;

353
00:19:57,364 --> 00:19:59,831
why you must see
the old man.

354
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:03,835
All you have to know is
that he's kept us alive.

355
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,721
He's let us survive.

356
00:20:05,756 --> 00:20:10,842
Goldsmith, we've survived
for ten years!

357
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:13,345
But we haven't lived.

358
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,847
Jason, he didn't drop the bomb.

359
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:18,350
He didn't kill off this earth.

360
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:20,235
We did that to ourselves.

361
00:20:21,236 --> 00:20:24,990
All he's done is to let us
survive our mistake.

362
00:20:25,025 --> 00:20:29,995
All he's done is to let us plant
a seed again and let it grow.

363
00:20:33,749 --> 00:20:36,868
All the compassion
that's left on this earth

364
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:38,120
is in that cave.

365
00:20:38,155 --> 00:20:39,371
Well, then,
make him open the cave!

366
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:41,873
Let's see the
old man now!

367
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:43,258
Open up
that door!

368
00:20:43,293 --> 00:20:44,509
All right.

369
00:21:19,294 --> 00:21:21,663
My god!

370
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:26,301
My dear god!

371
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:36,061
It's a machine.

372
00:21:37,312 --> 00:21:39,181
It's a computer.

373
00:21:40,682 --> 00:21:45,187
There's your old man,
there's your tyrant.

374
00:21:45,222 --> 00:21:47,072
Kill it.

375
00:21:48,323 --> 00:21:50,192
Well, you've got to kill it.

376
00:21:50,227 --> 00:21:52,077
You've been hungry
long enough.

377
00:21:52,112 --> 00:21:53,328
Now, kill it!

378
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:10,462
All right,
all right!

379
00:22:10,497 --> 00:22:12,097
All right!

380
00:22:15,851 --> 00:22:18,353
All right, you're free now.

381
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:20,105
You understand?

382
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,973
You're free!

383
00:23:20,282 --> 00:23:24,035
When we talked about the ways
that men could die,

384
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:27,789
we forgot the chief method
of execution.

385
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:31,543
We forgot faithlessness,
major french.

386
00:23:31,578 --> 00:23:33,678
Maybe you're not to blame.

387
00:23:33,713 --> 00:23:38,049
Maybe if it weren't you,
it would have been someone else.

388
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:46,057
Maybe this has to be
the destiny of man.

389
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:48,560
I wonder if that's true.

390
00:23:50,445 --> 00:23:52,948
I wonder.

391
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:57,319
I guess i'll never know.

392
00:24:00,322 --> 00:24:02,824
I guess i'll never know.

393
00:24:02,859 --> 00:24:06,578
Mr. Goldsmith, survivor,

394
00:24:06,613 --> 00:24:10,332
an eyewitness to
man's imperfection,

395
00:24:10,367 --> 00:24:13,468
an observer of
the very human trait of greed

396
00:24:13,503 --> 00:24:15,971
and a chronicler
of the last chapter-

397
00:24:16,006 --> 00:24:17,839
the one reading "suicide."

398
00:24:17,874 --> 00:24:19,724
Not a prediction
of what is to be,

399
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:22,227
just a projection
of what could be.

400
00:24:22,262 --> 00:24:25,981
This has been
the twilight zone.

401
00:24:30,001 --> 00:24:32,187
And now, mr. Serling.

402
00:24:32,222 --> 00:24:33,438
Next onthe twilight zone,

403
00:24:33,473 --> 00:24:35,323
the distinguished
sir cedric hardwicke

404
00:24:35,358 --> 00:24:36,575
lends us
his considerable talent,

405
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:39,077
along with the very accomplished
miss constance ford.

406
00:24:39,694 --> 00:24:41,580
They appear in what can
most aptly be described

407
00:24:41,615 --> 00:24:43,448
as one of the shockers
in our schedule.

408
00:24:43,483 --> 00:24:45,333
The play is called
"uncle simon,"

409
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:48,453
and this we submit is a relative
you've never met before.

410
00:24:48,488 --> 00:24:50,338
It's a story
with a final curtain

411
00:24:50,373 --> 00:24:52,207
i doubt anyone can predict.

412
00:24:52,242 --> 00:24:54,709
Next ontwilight zone,
"uncle simon."
