1
00:00:10,393 --> 00:00:12,896
You're traveling
through another dimension-

2
00:00:12,931 --> 00:00:16,032
a dimension not only of sight
and sound, but of mind,

3
00:00:16,067 --> 00:00:17,901
a journey into a wondrous land

4
00:00:17,936 --> 00:00:20,403
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

5
00:00:20,438 --> 00:00:22,906
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

6
00:00:54,687 --> 00:00:57,190
Pinto!

7
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:00,944
You're covered on all sides.

8
00:01:01,945 --> 00:01:02,946
Raise your hands.

9
00:01:22,465 --> 00:01:23,099
He's still alive.

10
00:01:23,134 --> 00:01:25,602
Let's get him
into the old jail.

11
00:01:38,982 --> 00:01:40,233
Well, they did it.

12
00:01:40,268 --> 00:01:41,484
They shot him down.

13
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:43,119
I never thought
they'd do that-

14
00:01:43,154 --> 00:01:44,988
not to pinto sykes-
not that easy.

15
00:01:45,023 --> 00:01:47,240
He's ain't got more
than a few minutes

16
00:01:47,275 --> 00:01:48,491
left to live, johnny rob.

17
00:01:48,526 --> 00:01:50,376
You go fetch
his paw and sister.

18
00:01:50,411 --> 00:01:52,245
All right,
mothershed.

19
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:55,999
Yes, sir.

20
00:01:56,034 --> 00:01:57,884
That's the end of that!

21
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,643
Normally, the old man
would be correct-

22
00:02:06,678 --> 00:02:09,145
this would be the end
of the story.

23
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:12,265
We've had the traditional
shootout on the street,

24
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,150
and the badman
will soon be dead,

25
00:02:14,185 --> 00:02:17,270
but some men of legend
and folktale have been known

26
00:02:17,305 --> 00:02:20,406
to continue having their way
even after death.

27
00:02:20,441 --> 00:02:23,526
The outlaw and killer
pinto sykes was such a person.

28
00:02:23,561 --> 00:02:26,663
And, shortly, we'll see
how he introduces the town-

29
00:02:26,698 --> 00:02:29,782
and a man named conny miller,
in particular-

30
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:31,668
to the twilight zone.

31
00:03:03,066 --> 00:03:04,067
Who's that?

32
00:03:10,073 --> 00:03:12,709
It's me, conny. Jasen.

33
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,714
Why'd they fence off that
piece of street down there?

34
00:03:17,749 --> 00:03:19,082
It's his blood.

35
00:03:19,117 --> 00:03:21,584
If you could see down
under all that dust,

36
00:03:21,619 --> 00:03:24,721
you could see
his blood down there.

37
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:26,222
Whose blood?

38
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:27,724
Pinto sykes'.

39
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:30,226
They shot
and killed him

40
00:03:30,261 --> 00:03:32,095
day before
yesterday.

41
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:46,359
Well, well. Lookee what
the wind blowed in.

42
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:47,493
Hello, conny.

43
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:49,996
Jim.

44
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:53,116
Same, conny?

45
00:03:59,255 --> 00:04:02,375
That's... that's
all for me.

46
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:07,130
Did you notice our little fence
out in the street, conny?

47
00:04:07,165 --> 00:04:09,015
That i did...

48
00:04:09,632 --> 00:04:11,517
and i know
what's in it, too.

49
00:04:11,552 --> 00:04:14,020
The blood
of pinto sykes.

50
00:04:14,055 --> 00:04:16,522
Who shot him?

51
00:04:16,557 --> 00:04:17,774
We did.

52
00:04:17,809 --> 00:04:19,642
Who is "we,"
mothershed?

53
00:04:19,677 --> 00:04:22,145
Us. The whole town.

54
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,396
Not me.

55
00:04:23,431 --> 00:04:25,281
I don't believe
in gunfire myself.

56
00:04:25,316 --> 00:04:27,784
Only eight of us
actually fired,

57
00:04:27,819 --> 00:04:30,286
but the whole town
was behind it.

58
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,406
We'll have to admit

59
00:04:33,441 --> 00:04:35,908
the whole town ain't
much of a marksman.

60
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:37,794
Out of eight shots fired,

61
00:04:37,829 --> 00:04:39,662
only one of them hit him.

62
00:04:39,697 --> 00:04:42,298
We don't even
know who it was

63
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:43,549
that got him.

64
00:04:44,801 --> 00:04:47,303
Bullet passed right through him.

65
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:51,674
No one's bragging
that they did it.
No, sir.

66
00:04:51,709 --> 00:04:52,925
No one's
taking credit

67
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,177
for that piece
of gunplay.

68
00:04:59,217 --> 00:05:00,683
You know something,
mr. Mothershed?

69
00:05:00,718 --> 00:05:02,568
Maybe, by now,
pinto knows

70
00:05:02,603 --> 00:05:05,071
who it was
that killed him.

71
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:11,944
Reckon you're some
disappointed, conny,

72
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:13,830
being as how you
spent so much time

73
00:05:13,865 --> 00:05:15,698
trying to find him
for yourself.

74
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:16,949
That i am, ira.

75
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:19,452
Four months wasted
looking for him,

76
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,954
and i could have
found him here.

77
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,459
That ain't the way
pinto tells it.

78
00:05:26,494 --> 00:05:29,595
He claimed you didn't
even try to catch up to him.

79
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:33,349
Hello, johnny rob.

80
00:05:33,384 --> 00:05:37,103
Still as big a blabbermouth
as ever, i find.

81
00:05:37,138 --> 00:05:40,606
You do spout off
a lot, johnny rob.

82
00:05:40,641 --> 00:05:43,109
But no need to get
riled, conny.

83
00:05:43,144 --> 00:05:44,360
Us here ain't saying

84
00:05:44,395 --> 00:05:46,863
that you didn't actually
try to catch him,

85
00:05:46,898 --> 00:05:48,114
but it is a fact

86
00:05:48,149 --> 00:05:51,234
that pinto claimed
that on his deathbed.

87
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:54,987
He talked
before he died?

88
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:56,873
He lived
a half hour

89
00:05:56,908 --> 00:05:57,490
after he
was shot.

90
00:05:57,525 --> 00:05:59,375
Talked
a blue streak

91
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:00,626
right up to
the very end.

92
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:03,746
What did he say about me?

93
00:06:03,781 --> 00:06:06,883
I reckon that
conny deserves

94
00:06:06,918 --> 00:06:08,134
to hear it all.

95
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:12,505
We got a new
circuit judge, conny-

96
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,390
a young fellow
named ed thackeray.

97
00:06:14,425 --> 00:06:16,259
He was through
here last week,

98
00:06:16,294 --> 00:06:18,761
and we went to him
with our complaints.

99
00:06:18,796 --> 00:06:21,264
We told him
how one pinto sykes

100
00:06:21,299 --> 00:06:23,149
is wanted by the law
in three states,

101
00:06:23,184 --> 00:06:24,400
but treats this town

102
00:06:24,435 --> 00:06:26,903
like it was his
personal property

103
00:06:26,938 --> 00:06:29,405
just because he was
born and raised here.

104
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:32,775
And we tell how we hired you-

105
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:35,912
conny miller-
to track him down,

106
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:39,031
but we ain't had much results.

107
00:06:45,323 --> 00:06:46,539
Well, sir...

108
00:06:46,574 --> 00:06:49,041
this thackeray
gets mad at us-

109
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:52,795
tells us to grow up
and act like men,

110
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,680
or else leave town

111
00:06:54,715 --> 00:06:57,800
and move to where
men can protect us.

112
00:06:57,835 --> 00:07:00,937
He gets us
kind of fired up.

113
00:07:00,972 --> 00:07:02,805
So we hold a meeting,

114
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,942
and we all agree
to work as one

115
00:07:05,977 --> 00:07:09,061
so that the next time
pinto rode in

116
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:12,448
we all join in,
and we take him.

117
00:07:12,483 --> 00:07:14,317
Day before yesterday,
he rode in.

118
00:07:14,352 --> 00:07:16,202
Now, do you want
to tell it, ira?

119
00:07:16,237 --> 00:07:18,704
That's about all
there is to tell.

120
00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:19,322
He rode in.

121
00:07:19,357 --> 00:07:21,824
Eight of the town
gunned him down

122
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:23,075
out in the street.

123
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,327
That's all there is.

124
00:07:24,362 --> 00:07:26,829
No, that is not
all there is.

125
00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:28,714
All right,
you tell it.

126
00:07:30,967 --> 00:07:34,720
We sent for
his paw- dan sykes-

127
00:07:34,755 --> 00:07:37,223
and for his
sister ione...

128
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,725
i know the names
of his family.

129
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,594
I was born here, too.

130
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:43,479
He spent the last
few minutes

131
00:07:43,514 --> 00:07:44,730
talking to them.

132
00:07:44,765 --> 00:07:47,233
He told his paw
how sorry he was

133
00:07:47,268 --> 00:07:49,735
that he hadn't
turned out better,

134
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:52,238
and his paw allowed

135
00:07:52,273 --> 00:07:55,992
as to how he'd
turned out right well.

136
00:07:56,027 --> 00:07:58,494
He told ione
how he wished

137
00:07:58,529 --> 00:08:02,248
she'd marry a fine
man and move away.

138
00:08:06,002 --> 00:08:08,504
Asked to be buried near his maw,

139
00:08:08,539 --> 00:08:12,258
only 20 feet away,
as she's too true a woman

140
00:08:12,293 --> 00:08:15,378
to have the likes
of him any closer.

141
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:18,514
What did he say
about me?

142
00:08:18,549 --> 00:08:22,885
He got real riled
when he mentioned you.

143
00:08:24,805 --> 00:08:27,273
He said, the slower
he ran away,

144
00:08:27,308 --> 00:08:29,775
the slower
you chased him.

145
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:33,529
He said he waited
for you in albuquerque.

146
00:08:33,564 --> 00:08:36,032
Even sent word
where he was.

147
00:08:36,067 --> 00:08:37,283
You never showed up.

148
00:08:37,318 --> 00:08:39,785
He said you
ought to be able

149
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,654
to catch him now

150
00:08:41,689 --> 00:08:44,156
but, that if
you ever come

151
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:47,293
anyways close
to his grave,

152
00:08:47,328 --> 00:08:49,795
he'll reach up and grab you.

153
00:08:55,418 --> 00:08:57,920
He lied... even
on his deathbed.

154
00:08:57,955 --> 00:09:00,423
I searched
all over albuquerque-

155
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:01,674
every saloon, hotel.

156
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:04,810
He wasn't even in
that town long enough

157
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:07,930
to rent himself a room
for the night.

158
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:22,695
Hello, ione.

159
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:27,700
Give me a bottle
of rye, mr. Bodley.

160
00:09:27,735 --> 00:09:29,585
Seems your paw is
hitting the drinking

161
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,836
a might heavy, ione.

162
00:09:30,871 --> 00:09:32,705
Maybe you ought
to try to get him

163
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,590
to tone it down.

164
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:35,841
He's a fine man.

165
00:09:35,876 --> 00:09:37,093
Now, the folks
here in town,

166
00:09:37,128 --> 00:09:40,212
they don't hold
it against him
that he's pinto's paw.

167
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:45,217
This ain't for my paw,
mr. Bodley.

168
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,103
It's for me.

169
00:09:48,971 --> 00:09:53,609
Well, look what
the wind blew in.

170
00:09:53,644 --> 00:09:55,478
Hello, ione.

171
00:09:55,513 --> 00:09:56,729
And how are you?

172
00:09:56,764 --> 00:09:58,614
Fine. Just fine.

173
00:09:58,649 --> 00:10:00,483
How's yourself?

174
00:10:00,518 --> 00:10:02,368
Just tolerable.

175
00:10:02,403 --> 00:10:04,236
You know,
my brother and i

176
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:06,122
were just
talking about you

177
00:10:06,157 --> 00:10:07,990
just the day
before yesterday.

178
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:11,127
He's real sorry
he's been missing you.

179
00:10:11,162 --> 00:10:13,629
We told him, ione.

180
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:16,132
Even about how
pinto's going

181
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:18,000
to reach up
and grab him?

182
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:19,885
We told him that, too.

183
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:23,506
You been chasing him
for so long, conny,

184
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:26,008
you ought to feel lucky tonight.

185
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:29,145
You know right
where he is.

186
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:33,399
All you got to do
is walk out there.

187
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:40,272
Isn't that nice?

188
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:03,546
That whole sykes family-
they never was real bright.

189
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:11,687
Tell me something,
conny.

190
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:14,190
Are you afraid
of pinto's grave?

191
00:11:14,225 --> 00:11:16,692
The rest of us are.
Now, how about you?

192
00:11:16,727 --> 00:11:18,561
Are you afraid?

193
00:11:18,596 --> 00:11:19,812
No.

194
00:11:19,847 --> 00:11:22,948
I'm going to tell you
something, johnny rob.

195
00:11:22,983 --> 00:11:26,068
I was never afraid of pinto
when he was alive,

196
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:29,205
and i sure ain't afraid of him
now that he's dead.

197
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,707
I don't believe that.

198
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:33,576
I ain't armed!

199
00:11:33,611 --> 00:11:34,827
Hold it,
conny.

200
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:36,712
Let's not
have any
bloodshed.

201
00:11:36,747 --> 00:11:38,581
Nobody calls
me a coward.

202
00:11:43,586 --> 00:11:45,471
Now, you didn't
let me finish

203
00:11:46,088 --> 00:11:47,973
what i was going
to say, conny.

204
00:11:48,008 --> 00:11:49,842
I don't think
you're a coward.

205
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:51,727
Leastwise,
i don't think

206
00:11:51,762 --> 00:11:54,230
you're afraid of
anybody in this room.

207
00:11:54,265 --> 00:11:56,098
Especially not me.

208
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:57,349
I'm just
a poor old boy.

209
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:59,235
I work hard
for not too much.

210
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:01,604
But dogs and
kids like me.

211
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:04,740
They follow me around
all the time.

212
00:12:04,775 --> 00:12:06,609
Sure is windy
tonight, ain't it?

213
00:12:06,644 --> 00:12:08,494
No, sir,
i don't think

214
00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:10,362
there's anybody
afraid of me.

215
00:12:12,248 --> 00:12:14,750
Whether you were
afraid of pinto alive-

216
00:12:14,785 --> 00:12:16,001
only you know that.

217
00:12:16,036 --> 00:12:18,254
But what i was
going to say

218
00:12:18,289 --> 00:12:20,756
before you hit me
and hurt me

219
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:22,758
was... well, now,
i'll bet-

220
00:12:22,793 --> 00:12:25,261
i'm not accusing,
you understand-

221
00:12:25,296 --> 00:12:27,129
but i'll bet

222
00:12:27,164 --> 00:12:30,266
that you won't call
on pinto tonight.

223
00:12:31,634 --> 00:12:35,137
Why don't you shut up
before you really get hurt?

224
00:12:35,172 --> 00:12:36,388
It's almost midnight.

225
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:38,274
Now, i'll bet you

226
00:12:38,309 --> 00:12:40,142
you won't walk
out of here

227
00:12:40,177 --> 00:12:42,027
at midnight sharp...

228
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:44,780
and visit
pinto's grave.

229
00:12:47,149 --> 00:12:49,652
Now, i got
a $20 gold piece.

230
00:12:49,687 --> 00:12:51,537
Now, i'll bet you...

231
00:12:51,572 --> 00:12:57,159
i'll bet you this $20 gold piece
it took me 20 weeks to save

232
00:12:57,194 --> 00:13:00,296
that you won't do
what i just said.

233
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:15,811
I'm going to tell
you something, boy.

234
00:13:15,846 --> 00:13:17,062
I don't like you.

235
00:13:17,097 --> 00:13:18,931
I never have,
and i never will.

236
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:21,934
So old blabbermouth
got hisself

237
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:24,436
a $20 gold piece, huh?

238
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:27,573
Well, i just happen
to have one, too

239
00:13:27,608 --> 00:13:29,441
and it just
covers yours.

240
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:31,327
I guess,
in a little while,

241
00:13:31,362 --> 00:13:33,829
one of us will have
$40 instead of $20.

242
00:13:33,864 --> 00:13:35,080
That's right.

243
00:13:35,115 --> 00:13:36,332
And, when i get back,

244
00:13:36,367 --> 00:13:38,834
i don't want you
hanging around here

245
00:13:38,869 --> 00:13:41,337
where i can see you.
You understand?

246
00:13:41,372 --> 00:13:42,588
Conny.

247
00:13:44,206 --> 00:13:45,457
You don't want to put up

248
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:46,709
another $20, do you?

249
00:13:51,714 --> 00:13:53,599
Are you saying
that you want

250
00:13:53,634 --> 00:13:55,467
to bet against me,
too, steinhart?

251
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:57,353
Betting's my
business, conny.

252
00:13:57,388 --> 00:13:59,722
You don't think i got the nerve?

253
00:13:59,757 --> 00:14:00,973
I didn't say that.

254
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:03,475
I just said i'd bet
$20 you don't go.

255
00:14:09,767 --> 00:14:10,733
There.

256
00:14:11,367 --> 00:14:13,869
Keep an eye
on the bets, ira.

257
00:14:13,904 --> 00:14:15,120
Sure, conny.

258
00:14:21,377 --> 00:14:23,879
I still got some
betting money left.

259
00:14:23,914 --> 00:14:25,497
I can't afford
to bet tonight.

260
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:28,000
Steinhart just took all
i can afford to lose.

261
00:14:28,035 --> 00:14:31,754
Well, if steinhart hadn't
hadn't taken all your money,

262
00:14:31,789 --> 00:14:33,005
whose side
would you be on?

263
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,890
I reckon i'd bet
agin you, conny.

264
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:38,010
What's wrong with you?

265
00:14:38,045 --> 00:14:39,261
You people know me.

266
00:14:39,296 --> 00:14:41,146
How come now
you think i'm afraid?

267
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:44,266
Because we'd
be afraid.

268
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:45,517
You can draw
your gun

269
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:46,769
real fast,
conny.

270
00:14:46,804 --> 00:14:48,020
We've seen you.

271
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:49,271
But, out in
that graveyard,

272
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:51,774
that gun won't be
worth a copper cent.

273
00:14:51,809 --> 00:14:54,910
I don't get my nerve
from this gun, mothershed.

274
00:14:54,945 --> 00:14:58,664
I had it long before i could
pick one of them up.

275
00:14:58,699 --> 00:14:59,915
Conny...

276
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,418
before you go,

277
00:15:02,453 --> 00:15:04,920
we've got to work out
a little detail.

278
00:15:04,955 --> 00:15:07,423
Since you're doing
this job by yourself,

279
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:09,291
how will we be sure
you've done it?

280
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:10,542
What do you mean?

281
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:13,045
What's to keep you
from going

282
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,930
to the edge
of the graveyard,

283
00:15:14,965 --> 00:15:18,050
then telling us
you've gone all the way?

284
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:23,689
You saying you don't
trust me, steinhart?

285
00:15:23,724 --> 00:15:25,557
Business is
business, conny.

286
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:27,443
And, with me,
this is business.

287
00:15:27,478 --> 00:15:28,694
Then, in that case,

288
00:15:28,729 --> 00:15:31,196
i guess you'll have
to keep me company

289
00:15:31,231 --> 00:15:33,816
so you can protect
your own interests.

290
00:15:33,851 --> 00:15:35,067
I have another way.

291
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:37,569
Give me your
bowie knife, ira.

292
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:45,327
What's that for?

293
00:15:45,362 --> 00:15:47,830
When you arrive
at your destination,

294
00:15:47,865 --> 00:15:49,715
simply stick it
into the grave.

295
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:50,966
Then, at daylight
tomorrow,

296
00:15:51,001 --> 00:15:53,469
we'll see the proof
of your visit.

297
00:15:53,504 --> 00:15:54,970
If we see it
within five feet

298
00:15:55,005 --> 00:15:56,221
of the fresh earth,

299
00:15:56,256 --> 00:15:58,090
we'll concede
the wager.

300
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:59,975
One thing,
conny.

301
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:01,477
Won't nobody
go up there

302
00:16:01,512 --> 00:16:02,728
and steal
that knife

303
00:16:02,763 --> 00:16:03,979
once you've
planted it.

304
00:16:07,349 --> 00:16:09,852
Keep the bottle
on the bar, ira.

305
00:16:10,486 --> 00:16:11,737
I won't be long.

306
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:20,422
Conny.

307
00:17:21,673 --> 00:17:22,925
Hello, ione.

308
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:29,181
Come to see pinto?

309
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:29,815
Maybe.

310
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:34,820
You're braver
than i thought.

311
00:17:34,855 --> 00:17:36,071
Hmm... here.

312
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:39,191
Maybe a good
belt of red-eye

313
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:42,327
will make it
all easier.

314
00:17:42,362 --> 00:17:45,447
I don't get my nerve
out of a bottle, ione.

315
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:52,337
You go on up there
and see pinto.

316
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:55,207
I just came
from there.

317
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:57,960
He's waiting for you.

318
00:20:27,075 --> 00:20:28,944
I don't
understand it.

319
00:20:28,979 --> 00:20:30,829
It's morning,
he ain't back yet.

320
00:20:30,864 --> 00:20:32,698
Maybe he didn't
have the nerve

321
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:34,583
to come back
and face us

322
00:20:34,618 --> 00:20:37,703
when he didn't have
the nerve to do it.

323
00:20:37,738 --> 00:20:38,337
Not likely.

324
00:20:38,372 --> 00:20:40,205
His horse is
still here.

325
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,090
I just can't
help feeling

326
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:43,959
somehow i got
a man killed.

327
00:20:43,994 --> 00:20:46,461
Now, it's full
daylight, johnny rob

328
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:48,964
and we can all think
with clear heads.

329
00:20:48,999 --> 00:20:50,215
Deep down,
we all know

330
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:53,352
that the dead can't
really hurt nobody.

331
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:05,364
Morning!

332
00:21:06,615 --> 00:21:07,866
Good morning, ione.

333
00:21:07,901 --> 00:21:10,369
What are you doing
with that plate?

334
00:21:10,404 --> 00:21:11,737
This is his.

335
00:21:11,772 --> 00:21:12,988
He used to eat
out of it

336
00:21:13,023 --> 00:21:14,873
when he was
a little boy.

337
00:21:14,908 --> 00:21:16,742
I'm going to put it
on his grave.

338
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:18,627
I'll go with you.

339
00:21:18,662 --> 00:21:21,747
I got to see what
happened out there.

340
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:25,500
Well, i reckon

341
00:21:25,535 --> 00:21:28,003
we can't spend
the rest of our days

342
00:21:28,038 --> 00:21:30,505
being afraid
of a dead man.

343
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,890
I'll come with you.

344
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:50,659
I knowed it!

345
00:21:50,694 --> 00:21:53,161
I knowed it!
I got a man killed.

346
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:58,033
Cut it out,
johnny rob.

347
00:21:58,068 --> 00:21:59,284
You're acting
like a baby.

348
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:01,787
It's not your
fault, boy.

349
00:22:01,822 --> 00:22:03,038
What do you mean?

350
00:22:03,073 --> 00:22:04,289
What happened?

351
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:06,792
The whole story
is right there.

352
00:22:06,827 --> 00:22:07,426
Look at him.

353
00:22:14,049 --> 00:22:15,300
He came up here.

354
00:22:15,335 --> 00:22:17,185
He had more courage
than i thought.

355
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:19,054
There's his knee prints.

356
00:22:19,089 --> 00:22:20,939
He knelt by the grave.

357
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:24,693
He pulled his knife
from his belt

358
00:22:24,728 --> 00:22:27,195
and plunged it into the grave,

359
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:29,064
but the wind was strong,

360
00:22:29,099 --> 00:22:31,566
and it blew his coattail
over the grave.

361
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:33,452
Being dark,
he didn't notice

362
00:22:33,487 --> 00:22:36,571
he'd put his knife
through his own coattail,

363
00:22:36,606 --> 00:22:38,457
pinioning it
to the grave.

364
00:22:38,492 --> 00:22:40,325
Then he started to rise.

365
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,210
As he did so,
perhaps halfway up

366
00:22:42,245 --> 00:22:45,964
he felt a sudden tug-
the knife holding his coattail.

367
00:22:45,999 --> 00:22:50,335
But, in his own mind, pinto
reached out and grabbed him.

368
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:52,838
He was already
scared half to death,

369
00:22:52,873 --> 00:22:54,089
and that
finished him.

370
00:22:54,723 --> 00:22:57,092
His heart gave way,
that's all.

371
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:05,851
There you are, bud.

372
00:23:10,238 --> 00:23:13,358
So you think conny's death
was an accident?

373
00:23:13,393 --> 00:23:14,743
That he stuck
the knife

374
00:23:14,778 --> 00:23:15,994
in his own
coattail?

375
00:23:16,029 --> 00:23:17,746
Yes, ma'am.

376
00:23:17,781 --> 00:23:20,866
How did his coattail
get over the grave?

377
00:23:20,901 --> 00:23:23,118
For some reason,
he had it unbuttoned.

378
00:23:23,153 --> 00:23:25,003
The wind must have
done the rest.

379
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:30,008
What direction was the wind
from last night?

380
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:32,010
The south. Why?

381
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:34,880
The south...

382
00:23:36,131 --> 00:23:38,016
same as now.

383
00:23:39,267 --> 00:23:41,136
Look at
my cloak.

384
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:47,275
I'm standing in the
same spot conny was.

385
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:48,527
Look at my cloak.

386
00:23:50,395 --> 00:23:53,532
Is the wind blowing it
across the grave?

387
00:23:58,537 --> 00:24:01,039
You take this
with a grain of salt

388
00:24:01,074 --> 00:24:04,159
or a shovelful of earth,
as shadow or as substance.

389
00:24:04,194 --> 00:24:07,913
We leave it up to you.
And, for any further research,

390
00:24:07,948 --> 00:24:12,083
check under "g" for "ghosts"...
in the twilight zone.

391
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:14,503
Rod serling,
creator ofthe twilight zone,

392
00:24:14,538 --> 00:24:17,005
will tell you
about next week's story

393
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:20,876
after this word
from our alternate sponsor.

394
00:24:20,911 --> 00:24:22,377
And now, mr. Serling.

395
00:24:22,412 --> 00:24:24,846
Next week, we borrow
from the exceptional talent

396
00:24:24,881 --> 00:24:26,731
of author jerome bixby.

397
00:24:26,766 --> 00:24:29,234
It's an adaptation
of what has been called

398
00:24:29,269 --> 00:24:32,988
one of the most terrifying
modern fantasies ever written.

399
00:24:33,023 --> 00:24:34,239
What you'll see is, in a sense,

400
00:24:34,274 --> 00:24:37,359
a portrait of a monster
as a young boy.

401
00:24:37,394 --> 00:24:40,495
Next week's very special
excursion into the twilight zone

402
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:42,998
is called "it's a good life."

403
00:24:43,033 --> 00:24:44,866
I hope we see you then.

404
00:25:18,033 --> 00:25:19,284
This is james arness.

405
00:25:19,901 --> 00:25:21,152
You know, it's only a short hop

406
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:24,289
fromthe twilight zone
to dodge city andgunsmoke-

407
00:25:24,324 --> 00:25:26,791
saturday nights
over most of these stations.
