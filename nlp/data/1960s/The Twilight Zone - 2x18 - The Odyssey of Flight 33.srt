1
00:00:11,379 --> 00:00:13,847
You're traveling
through another dimension

2
00:00:13,882 --> 00:00:16,966
a dimension not only
of sight and sound, but of mind

3
00:00:17,001 --> 00:00:18,852
a journey into a wondrous land

4
00:00:18,887 --> 00:00:20,720
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

5
00:00:20,755 --> 00:00:22,605
That's the signpost up ahead.

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,108
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

7
00:00:52,001 --> 00:00:54,504
Global 33, receiving okay.

8
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,892
Magellan, how about
a flight progress report?

9
00:00:58,927 --> 00:01:00,760
Coming up,
skipper.

10
00:01:00,795 --> 00:01:03,897
Global 33,
receiving okay.

11
00:01:03,932 --> 00:01:05,148
We'll be about
four minutes

12
00:01:05,183 --> 00:01:08,902
behind flight plan
at 30-degrees west.

13
00:01:08,937 --> 00:01:10,770
Check. Captain,
gander wants to know

14
00:01:10,805 --> 00:01:13,273
if you intend
an altitude change

15
00:01:13,308 --> 00:01:14,524
after we
pass 30 west.

16
00:01:14,559 --> 00:01:15,775
Advise gander negative.

17
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:17,660
Negative altitude change.

18
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:24,417
You'll be pleased to know

19
00:01:24,452 --> 00:01:26,920
that thanks to the quality
of this aircraft

20
00:01:26,955 --> 00:01:29,422
and the fine weather
and my brilliant flying

21
00:01:29,457 --> 00:01:31,291
we'll hit idlewild
on schedule

22
00:01:31,326 --> 00:01:33,793
if our speed holds up.

23
00:01:33,828 --> 00:01:35,044
Send it in, wyatt.

24
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:36,296
Yes, sir.

25
00:01:36,331 --> 00:01:39,432
Shannon, shannon,
copy, gander.

26
00:01:39,467 --> 00:01:43,186
Global flight 33,
position 52 north

27
00:01:43,221 --> 00:01:46,439
30 west, time 14:03.

28
00:01:46,474 --> 00:01:48,942
Flight level 35,000.

29
00:01:48,977 --> 00:01:53,563
Estimating 51 north,
40 west at 14:45.

30
00:01:53,598 --> 00:01:55,448
Estimating idlewild 18:30.

31
00:01:55,483 --> 00:01:58,568
Fuel remaining, 79560.

32
00:01:58,603 --> 00:02:00,453
Temperature, minus 57.

33
00:02:00,488 --> 00:02:04,207
Report received, captain.

34
00:02:04,242 --> 00:02:06,075
How we doing
back there, janie?

35
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:08,578
Oh, your passengers
are highly content

36
00:02:08,613 --> 00:02:10,213
but on behalf
of the stewardesses

37
00:02:10,248 --> 00:02:12,081
i would like
to respectfully request

38
00:02:12,116 --> 00:02:14,584
that we get to new york
as soon as possible.

39
00:02:14,619 --> 00:02:15,835
One's going to the opera

40
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,720
two have
heavy dates

41
00:02:17,755 --> 00:02:20,223
and the fourth is available
to any honorable

42
00:02:20,258 --> 00:02:21,474
and single male crew member.

43
00:02:24,012 --> 00:02:25,228
Oh, hold
it a minute.

44
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,348
Do you feel anything?

45
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,850
Feel anything?

46
00:02:30,885 --> 00:02:32,735
No, what do you mean?

47
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:35,855
I don't know-
i felt something...

48
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:40,243
something funny,
like the sensation of speed.

49
00:02:40,278 --> 00:02:42,745
I can't put my finger on it.

50
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:43,997
I guess i'm getting old.

51
00:02:44,032 --> 00:02:46,499
True airspeed 470, we're level.

52
00:02:46,534 --> 00:02:49,002
Suppose we picked up
a tail wind?

53
00:02:49,037 --> 00:02:53,373
Yeah, maybe those
jet streams are tricky.

54
00:02:53,408 --> 00:02:57,126
It's that crazy feeling
i can't shake.

55
00:02:57,161 --> 00:03:00,263
I can't feel a tail wind,
but i feel something.

56
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,131
Everything looks fine.

57
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:05,885
Magellan, try and get me
a ground-speed check

58
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,136
with the doppler.

59
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:11,524
Indicates 900.

60
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:12,775
That's impossible.

61
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:14,644
I better check with loran.

62
00:03:14,679 --> 00:03:16,145
What's going on?

63
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,031
Hold it a minute.

64
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:26,789
Skipper, loran indicates
a ground speed of 830 knots.

65
00:03:26,824 --> 00:03:29,292
I never heard of a tail wind
like that.

66
00:03:29,327 --> 00:03:31,160
Check it again.

67
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:33,663
See if you
can raise

68
00:03:33,698 --> 00:03:35,548
weather ship
charlie.

69
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:36,799
Ask him for
a radar fix

70
00:03:36,834 --> 00:03:38,668
on the ground-
speed check.

71
00:03:38,703 --> 00:03:39,919
Magellan,
are you sure

72
00:03:39,954 --> 00:03:41,804
about that
ground speed?

73
00:03:41,839 --> 00:03:45,925
I'm not only sure,
but we're still accelerating.

74
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,176
980 now.

75
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,313
1,120.

76
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,433
1,500.

77
00:03:53,468 --> 00:03:55,435
Global 33 tocharlie.

78
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,186
God in heaven,
i can't even keep up with it.

79
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:04,077
Global 33 to weather
shipcharlie.

80
00:04:04,112 --> 00:04:07,196
Global 33
to weather shipcharlie.

81
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,333
What aboutcharlie?

82
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,584
Nothing, sir,
i can't raise them.

83
00:04:11,619 --> 00:04:13,453
2,100.

84
00:04:13,488 --> 00:04:16,339
Well, i hope the wings stay on.

85
00:04:16,374 --> 00:04:18,207
Don't worry about the wings.

86
00:04:18,242 --> 00:04:20,093
It's the true airspeed
that counts.

87
00:04:20,128 --> 00:04:21,961
Ground speed means nothing.

88
00:04:21,996 --> 00:04:25,098
Well, now, we just hit
one lulu of a jet stream.

89
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:28,217
Magellan.

90
00:04:28,252 --> 00:04:31,354
My needle just reversed
past gander v.o.r.

91
00:04:31,389 --> 00:04:32,605
How could we get past...?

92
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,108
Give me a fast position check.

93
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,227
Skipper, we are past gander.

94
00:04:38,262 --> 00:04:40,113
We must be doing 3,000 knots.

95
00:04:42,231 --> 00:04:44,734
Try to raise harmon control
or moncton or boston.

96
00:04:44,769 --> 00:04:47,236
At this speed,
you might as well try

97
00:04:47,271 --> 00:04:48,488
to get idlewild.

98
00:04:48,523 --> 00:04:51,624
Harmon control,
this is global 33.

99
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:55,995
Harmon, do you read us?

100
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,749
Moncton.

101
00:05:02,251 --> 00:05:06,005
Moncton, this
is global 33.

102
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,891
Boston.

103
00:05:08,926 --> 00:05:12,645
Boston control,
this is global 33.

104
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:17,016
Boston, please
acknowledge.

105
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:22,021
Idlewild.

106
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:25,158
Idlewild, this is global 33.

107
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,529
Idlewild, do
you read us?

108
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:37,670
It's no soap.

109
00:05:37,705 --> 00:05:39,539
I can't raise anyone.

110
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:54,554
You're riding on a jet airliner

111
00:05:54,589 --> 00:05:56,439
en route from london
to new york.

112
00:05:56,474 --> 00:05:58,941
You're at 35,000 feet
atop an overcast

113
00:05:58,976 --> 00:06:02,061
and roughly 55 minutes
from idlewild airport

114
00:06:02,096 --> 00:06:06,449
but what you've seen occur
inside the cockpit of this plane

115
00:06:06,484 --> 00:06:08,951
is no reflection on the aircraft
or the crew.

116
00:06:08,986 --> 00:06:12,705
It's a safe, well-engineered,
perfectly designed machine

117
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,574
and the men you've just met

118
00:06:14,609 --> 00:06:17,076
are a trained, cool,
highly efficient team.

119
00:06:17,111 --> 00:06:20,213
The problem is simply that
the plane is going too fast

120
00:06:20,248 --> 00:06:23,332
and there is nothing
within the realm of knowledge

121
00:06:23,367 --> 00:06:25,218
or at least logic
to explain it.

122
00:06:25,253 --> 00:06:27,086
Unbeknownst to
passenger and crew

123
00:06:27,121 --> 00:06:29,589
this aeroplane is heading
into an uncharted region

124
00:06:29,624 --> 00:06:32,725
well-off the beaten track
of commercial travelers.

125
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,228
It's moving into
the twilight zone.

126
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:39,599
What you're about to see we
call "the odyssey of flight 33."

127
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,916
I hope you're proud
of the fly-boys.

128
00:06:56,951 --> 00:06:59,419
I'm seeingthe
valkyrietonight.

129
00:06:59,454 --> 00:07:00,670
Oh, janie.

130
00:07:00,705 --> 00:07:01,287
I've always had

131
00:07:01,322 --> 00:07:03,172
a thing about
valhalla.

132
00:07:03,207 --> 00:07:04,424
Be a good egg and tell
me i'm going to make it

133
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:06,292
in time
for the curtain.

134
00:07:06,327 --> 00:07:07,927
Let me put it to you this way:

135
00:07:07,962 --> 00:07:11,047
I only hope that the valhalla
you're talking about

136
00:07:11,082 --> 00:07:14,801
is at the metropolitan opera
house in little old new york.

137
00:07:14,836 --> 00:07:16,686
Instead of...?

138
00:07:16,721 --> 00:07:19,806
Instead of a conducted tour
through the real thing.

139
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:22,942
We're in trouble.

140
00:07:22,977 --> 00:07:24,193
How bad?

141
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:26,696
They don't know yet.

142
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:29,065
Go ahead, serve it.

143
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:34,070
Paula, remember:

144
00:07:34,105 --> 00:07:37,457
"Coffee, tea or milk?"
And with a smile.

145
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:40,576
You've got a deal.

146
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,470
You know, you talk
about ailments.

147
00:07:50,505 --> 00:07:52,972
Well, i had an aunt
once in boise, idaho

148
00:07:53,007 --> 00:07:54,223
had one of the
worst livers

149
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:56,092
in the medical
history of the state.

150
00:07:56,127 --> 00:07:59,228
That woman, when she
passed on, rest her soul

151
00:07:59,263 --> 00:08:00,480
would you believe it,

152
00:08:00,515 --> 00:08:02,982
there were five
medical associations

153
00:08:03,017 --> 00:08:07,353
who were bidding just to get
her liver in a bottle on display.

154
00:08:07,388 --> 00:08:09,856
But her mother- that
was my father's sister-

155
00:08:09,891 --> 00:08:12,992
she absolutely refused to
let them show her liver.

156
00:08:13,027 --> 00:08:15,495
And it was like i said to
my late husband, you can...

157
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:18,614
what did you say you were, dear?

158
00:08:18,649 --> 00:08:21,000
Group captain, madame.

159
00:08:21,035 --> 00:08:24,754
I'm military attache to the
british embassy in washington.

160
00:08:24,789 --> 00:08:26,622
Oh, isn't that
wonderful.

161
00:08:26,657 --> 00:08:28,508
You know,
i had a nephew

162
00:08:28,543 --> 00:08:30,877
in the navy
in the second world war.

163
00:08:30,912 --> 00:08:32,128
Yes, he was...

164
00:08:32,163 --> 00:08:35,014
he was on a
cruiser or a...

165
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:38,134
p.t. Boat, or
something like that.

166
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:40,636
Or maybe it was
a battleship.

167
00:08:40,671 --> 00:08:42,522
Did you feel anything?

168
00:08:42,557 --> 00:08:45,391
Well, i felt a little
queasy when we took off

169
00:08:45,426 --> 00:08:48,528
but like my late husband
always used to say

170
00:08:48,563 --> 00:08:51,647
i've got a stomach
that's just like...

171
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:56,152
it's odd.

172
00:08:56,187 --> 00:08:57,403
It's very odd, indeed.

173
00:08:57,438 --> 00:08:59,906
I have the strangest sensation
of speed.

174
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,793
Acceleration.

175
00:09:03,828 --> 00:09:04,660
Oh!

176
00:09:04,695 --> 00:09:06,546
Oh, dear,
terribly sorry.

177
00:09:06,581 --> 00:09:08,664
Got a little nerves, miss?

178
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,801
Heavy date in new york.

179
00:09:11,836 --> 00:09:13,052
Little shook up.

180
00:09:13,087 --> 00:09:14,921
I don't blame
you then.

181
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,181
Another channel...

182
00:09:25,216 --> 00:09:27,066
well, what about it?

183
00:09:27,101 --> 00:09:28,317
Not a thing, captain.

184
00:09:28,352 --> 00:09:30,186
Not a single thing.

185
00:09:30,221 --> 00:09:32,688
Either everybody out there
is off whack- everybody-

186
00:09:32,723 --> 00:09:33,940
or we are.

187
00:09:33,975 --> 00:09:35,191
Well, check
your equipment again.

188
00:09:35,226 --> 00:09:36,442
I checked it four times.

189
00:09:36,477 --> 00:09:37,693
All right,
knock it off.

190
00:09:37,728 --> 00:09:38,945
I might
as well try

191
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,830
to bull our way through and see if...

192
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:47,837
did we hit
something?

193
00:09:47,872 --> 00:09:50,339
I don't know.
Check for damage.

194
00:09:50,374 --> 00:09:52,842
Number three and four
are still on the wing.

195
00:09:52,877 --> 00:09:53,459
They look okay.

196
00:09:53,494 --> 00:09:54,710
Ditto one
and two.

197
00:09:54,745 --> 00:09:56,596
Everything seems
to be in a piece.

198
00:09:56,631 --> 00:09:58,464
Purcell, go aft and check for cabin damage.

199
00:09:58,499 --> 00:09:59,715
Report back
right away.

200
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:00,967
Right.

201
00:10:01,002 --> 00:10:02,218
I'd better get
on the horn

202
00:10:02,253 --> 00:10:03,469
and calm
down anybody

203
00:10:03,504 --> 00:10:04,720
that needs
calming down.

204
00:10:04,755 --> 00:10:05,972
Tell the girls
to stay with it.

205
00:10:06,007 --> 00:10:07,223
Right.

206
00:10:09,725 --> 00:10:10,977
We're in trouble.

207
00:10:11,012 --> 00:10:12,862
I don't know what
kind of trouble.

208
00:10:12,897 --> 00:10:15,982
That light, that crazy light-
what was it?

209
00:10:16,017 --> 00:10:18,484
Something we'll have
to find out-

210
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:20,369
quick too.

211
00:10:20,404 --> 00:10:22,872
What was that shaking?
Turbulence?

212
00:10:22,907 --> 00:10:24,123
I doubt it.

213
00:10:24,158 --> 00:10:26,626
It was more like a...
like a...

214
00:10:26,661 --> 00:10:27,877
like a what?

215
00:10:27,912 --> 00:10:31,631
Like a sound shockwave

216
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:34,133
as if we'd gone
past the speed of sound.

217
00:10:34,168 --> 00:10:35,635
You mean we hit mach one?

218
00:10:36,252 --> 00:10:38,137
We broke the sound barrier?

219
00:10:38,172 --> 00:10:41,257
But we didn't get
any mach warning bell.

220
00:10:41,292 --> 00:10:42,758
We probably wouldn't have

221
00:10:42,793 --> 00:10:45,895
not with a true airspeed
of only 470.

222
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:47,763
I don't know what it is.

223
00:10:47,798 --> 00:10:49,015
I just don't know.

224
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:52,768
See, magellan's last speed check
was 3,000 knots.

225
00:10:52,803 --> 00:10:57,156
We could have gone through
some kind of a sound barrier

226
00:10:57,191 --> 00:11:00,910
but... no kind of
a sound barrier i ever heard of.

227
00:11:00,945 --> 00:11:02,161
Magellan-

228
00:11:02,196 --> 00:11:04,030
can you give
me a fix now?

229
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,676
Global 33 to
harmon control...

230
00:11:16,711 --> 00:11:19,178
whatever that bump was, skipper

231
00:11:19,213 --> 00:11:21,681
it's really knocked out
everything.

232
00:11:21,716 --> 00:11:24,183
Global 33, moncton.

233
00:11:24,218 --> 00:11:27,303
The altimeter and rate of climb
are steady, skipper.

234
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:30,439
Captain, i can't reach

235
00:11:30,474 --> 00:11:33,559
gander, moncton or
boston or anybody.

236
00:11:33,594 --> 00:11:37,313
Either they're off the
air or we are or both.

237
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,815
Hatch, give me
a sun line.

238
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:41,701
I'll need a
heading to idlewild

239
00:11:41,736 --> 00:11:44,203
from our last
known position.

240
00:11:44,238 --> 00:11:47,323
If we can't raise anyone,
we'll establish visual contact.

241
00:11:47,358 --> 00:11:48,574
Skipper, you can't do that.

242
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,459
If we leave this altitude

243
00:11:50,494 --> 00:11:53,579
well run smack-dab into the
middle of 20 other flights.

244
00:11:53,614 --> 00:11:56,082
Have you got
any other alternative, craig?

245
00:11:56,117 --> 00:11:57,967
Sooner or later,
we're going to have

246
00:11:58,002 --> 00:11:59,835
to find a landmark
and go v.f.r.

247
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:02,972
Without radio contact,
we're deaf and dumb.

248
00:12:03,007 --> 00:12:05,474
As long as we stay up here,
we're also blind.

249
00:12:05,509 --> 00:12:07,977
There's no damage there, skip.

250
00:12:08,012 --> 00:12:09,845
Everybody's shook up
and curious.

251
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,731
They're also plenty scared.

252
00:12:11,766 --> 00:12:15,351
Them and me.

253
00:12:17,853 --> 00:12:20,356
Well, "ours is not
to reason why."

254
00:12:20,391 --> 00:12:23,109
Into the valley
of public relations.

255
00:12:23,144 --> 00:12:24,360
Ladies and
gentlemen

256
00:12:24,395 --> 00:12:26,245
this is
captain farver.

257
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:30,366
I want to assure you that
everything is under control

258
00:12:30,401 --> 00:12:31,617
and there is no danger.

259
00:12:31,652 --> 00:12:34,754
We encountered
a little clear air turbulence

260
00:12:34,789 --> 00:12:36,005
and atmospheric phenomena

261
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,125
but there's been no damage
to the aircraft

262
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,627
except for some
temporary radio malfunction.

263
00:12:41,662 --> 00:12:44,130
There's no cause for alarm

264
00:12:44,165 --> 00:12:45,381
and i'll keep you posted.

265
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:47,883
If we run according to schedule

266
00:12:47,918 --> 00:12:51,637
we should be landing at idlewild
inside of the next 40 minutes.

267
00:12:51,672 --> 00:12:52,638
Thank you.

268
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,643
Purcell, what's the fuel?

269
00:12:57,678 --> 00:13:02,031
71,435 pounds.

270
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:07,653
I don't feel that strange
sensation of speed anymore.

271
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,539
Magellan,
how about

272
00:13:10,574 --> 00:13:12,408
that heading
to idlewild?

273
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,162
Part of this is
scientific, skipper.

274
00:13:16,197 --> 00:13:18,664
Part of it's
kentucky windage.

275
00:13:18,699 --> 00:13:20,549
Try 262, that's as
close as i can get.

276
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:23,803
All right, you all know
what we're up against.

277
00:13:23,838 --> 00:13:25,671
We have no radio contact.

278
00:13:25,706 --> 00:13:29,425
Apparently, we're out of touch
with all ground-radar points.

279
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,310
We don't know where we are.

280
00:13:31,345 --> 00:13:33,179
We're not even sure
if we're on airways.

281
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,064
This beast gulps fuel.

282
00:13:35,099 --> 00:13:36,932
We all know that only too well.

283
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:40,686
So we've got
one chance.

284
00:13:40,721 --> 00:13:42,571
We'll go through
this overcast

285
00:13:42,606 --> 00:13:43,823
and try to find

286
00:13:43,858 --> 00:13:45,691
something that
looks familiar.

287
00:13:45,726 --> 00:13:47,576
Uh... it's
very possible

288
00:13:47,611 --> 00:13:49,445
that we might
hit something

289
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,696
on the way down

290
00:13:50,731 --> 00:13:53,199
but it's a chance
we've got to take.

291
00:13:53,234 --> 00:13:55,701
I wanted you to know
where we stand

292
00:13:55,736 --> 00:13:59,455
so everybody keep a sharp
lookout for any other traffic

293
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:01,340
and keep your fingers crossed.

294
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:04,460
I guess a few prayers wouldn't
be out of order either.

295
00:14:05,461 --> 00:14:08,597
All right, craig,
let's go down.

296
00:14:08,632 --> 00:14:10,466
Hit the horn button.

297
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,004
Skipper?

298
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:54,009
I don't get it.

299
00:14:54,044 --> 00:14:56,512
It happens to be
a fact, though.

300
00:14:56,547 --> 00:14:59,648
That's manhattan
island down there.

301
00:14:59,683 --> 00:15:01,650
Manhattan island?

302
00:15:01,685 --> 00:15:03,519
How could it be
manhattan island?

303
00:15:03,554 --> 00:15:04,770
Where's the skyline?

304
00:15:04,805 --> 00:15:06,655
Where are all the buildings?

305
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:09,158
I don't know where they are,
but that's new york city.

306
00:15:09,193 --> 00:15:12,161
One little item seems to be amiss.

307
00:15:12,196 --> 00:15:13,412
The passengers...

308
00:15:13,447 --> 00:15:15,281
yeah, i don't
blame them.

309
00:15:15,316 --> 00:15:17,166
Well, we're over land.

310
00:15:17,201 --> 00:15:18,417
I don't see any...

311
00:15:19,034 --> 00:15:19,668
any what, janie?

312
00:15:19,703 --> 00:15:22,788
Any city, right?

313
00:15:22,823 --> 00:15:25,541
We don't either.

314
00:15:25,576 --> 00:15:28,043
Now, that's manhattan island
down there.

315
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:29,929
There's the east river.

316
00:15:29,964 --> 00:15:31,797
There's the hudson river.

317
00:15:31,832 --> 00:15:33,682
That's staten island.

318
00:15:33,717 --> 00:15:36,185
We've got all the
topographical clues we need.

319
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:39,305
The problem seems to be
the real estate's there

320
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:43,058
it's just the city and eight
million people are missing.

321
00:15:43,093 --> 00:15:45,561
In short, there is no new york.

322
00:15:45,596 --> 00:15:46,812
It's disappeared.

323
00:15:46,847 --> 00:15:49,949
Skipper, verify something
for me, would you?

324
00:15:49,984 --> 00:15:51,200
And in a hurry?

325
00:15:51,235 --> 00:15:53,068
Look!

326
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,207
It's not possible.

327
00:15:58,242 --> 00:16:00,709
What in the name
of everything holy

328
00:16:00,744 --> 00:16:01,961
is going on?

329
00:16:33,442 --> 00:16:34,693
What's the score?

330
00:16:34,728 --> 00:16:36,578
We've been circling
for a half an hour?

331
00:16:36,613 --> 00:16:38,447
They said they'd
keep in touch,

332
00:16:38,482 --> 00:16:39,698
but not to come in.

333
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,954
Well, what do you
think, skipper?

334
00:16:45,989 --> 00:16:47,840
Well, we've
flown over

335
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:49,091
what should be

336
00:16:49,126 --> 00:16:50,342
schenectady,
albany

337
00:16:50,377 --> 00:16:52,845
points north.

338
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,347
I'll give you a
surmise, gentlemen.

339
00:16:55,382 --> 00:16:57,850
You may want to truss me up with ropes

340
00:16:57,885 --> 00:17:00,969
but it's the only single
explanation i can give.

341
00:17:01,004 --> 00:17:07,109
Somehow in some way we not only
went through the sound barrier

342
00:17:07,144 --> 00:17:10,229
but we've gone back in time.

343
00:17:10,264 --> 00:17:12,231
Well, what do we do about it?

344
00:17:12,266 --> 00:17:14,116
Skipper?

345
00:17:14,151 --> 00:17:16,618
Fuel is down to 49,435 pounds.

346
00:17:16,653 --> 00:17:19,738
Then here's what we're
going to do about it.

347
00:17:19,773 --> 00:17:22,241
We're going to push this baby up

348
00:17:22,276 --> 00:17:24,743
until she's going as fast
as she can.

349
00:17:24,778 --> 00:17:28,497
We're going to climb till we get
back into that jet stream

350
00:17:28,532 --> 00:17:32,885
and then... we're going to try
to go back where we came from.

351
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:38,507
All right, craig.

352
00:17:38,542 --> 00:17:39,141
Let's do it.

353
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:00,662
700 knots.

354
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:02,781
780.

355
00:18:04,032 --> 00:18:05,284
800.

356
00:18:06,535 --> 00:18:08,287
900 knots.

357
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,293
I think we're going to make it.

358
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:18,931
We're picking it up again.
Do you feel it?

359
00:18:18,966 --> 00:18:20,182
We're picking it up again.

360
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:28,307
Look, i know you've got
your hands full

361
00:18:28,342 --> 00:18:29,558
but somebody get on the pipe.

362
00:18:29,593 --> 00:18:32,694
I've got three passengers back
there that are nearly hysterical

363
00:18:32,729 --> 00:18:33,312
and those two kids

364
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,314
back in the
tourist section

365
00:18:35,349 --> 00:18:37,699
have half the passengers
climbing the walls.

366
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:50,829
We made it!

367
00:18:50,864 --> 00:18:52,714
Look, we're back!

368
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:03,475
Ladies and
gentlemen

369
00:19:04,092 --> 00:19:05,344
this is
captain farver.

370
00:19:05,379 --> 00:19:07,846
We encountered some momentary
difficulty back there

371
00:19:07,881 --> 00:19:10,349
but as you can see,
we're over new york city now

372
00:19:10,384 --> 00:19:12,851
and should be landing
inside of just a few minutes.

373
00:19:12,886 --> 00:19:14,102
Thank you.

374
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,239
What about
idlewild?

375
00:19:17,274 --> 00:19:18,490
Nothing doing,
captain.

376
00:19:18,525 --> 00:19:19,741
Our v.h.f.
Is still out.

377
00:19:19,776 --> 00:19:21,610
Maybe their's
is out, too.

378
00:19:21,645 --> 00:19:23,495
Try using a
high frequency.

379
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:24,746
I did already,
captain.

380
00:19:24,781 --> 00:19:26,615
There's nothing
from idlewild.

381
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:29,001
What about
la guardia?

382
00:19:29,036 --> 00:19:30,869
Somebody ought
to hear us.

383
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:34,122
La guardia

384
00:19:34,157 --> 00:19:34,873
this is
global 33.

385
00:19:34,908 --> 00:19:36,758
La guardia,
come in, please.

386
00:19:36,793 --> 00:19:39,878
This is la guardia tower.

387
00:19:39,913 --> 00:19:41,129
Who is calling, please?

388
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,883
La guardia, this
is global 33.

389
00:19:44,918 --> 00:19:46,134
We're on the
northeast leg

390
00:19:46,169 --> 00:19:47,386
of la guardia range.

391
00:19:47,421 --> 00:19:49,888
Our v.o.r. And i.l.s.
Appear inoperative.

392
00:19:49,923 --> 00:19:52,391
Request radar
vector to idlewild.

393
00:19:52,426 --> 00:19:53,642
You request what?

394
00:19:53,677 --> 00:19:56,778
Radar vector to
idlewild i.l.s.

395
00:19:56,813 --> 00:19:59,898
What flight did you say
this was?

396
00:19:59,933 --> 00:20:02,651
La guardia, this is
global airlines flight 33.

397
00:20:02,686 --> 00:20:03,902
Now, stop fooling around.

398
00:20:03,937 --> 00:20:05,787
We're short on fuel.

399
00:20:05,822 --> 00:20:07,656
Global 33?

400
00:20:07,691 --> 00:20:10,158
What kind of aircraft is this?

401
00:20:10,193 --> 00:20:11,410
This is a jet aircraft.

402
00:20:11,445 --> 00:20:13,662
Did you say ajetaircraft?

403
00:20:13,697 --> 00:20:14,913
Let me handle it.

404
00:20:14,948 --> 00:20:16,798
La guardia, this is a jet.

405
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:18,667
We have four,
big lovely turbines

406
00:20:18,702 --> 00:20:22,421
and they're getting hungry,
running short on fuel.

407
00:20:22,456 --> 00:20:24,306
We want a radar vector
to idlewild.

408
00:20:24,341 --> 00:20:26,808
Do you have us in radar contact
or don't you?

409
00:20:26,843 --> 00:20:28,677
I don't know who you are

410
00:20:28,712 --> 00:20:30,562
and we don't know
anything at all

411
00:20:30,597 --> 00:20:33,065
about radar or jets
or anything else

412
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,317
but if you're really low on fuel

413
00:20:35,352 --> 00:20:37,185
we'll clear you to land here.

414
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:39,688
Captain, their
longest runway

415
00:20:39,723 --> 00:20:41,573
is less than
5,000 feet.

416
00:20:41,608 --> 00:20:44,076
Do you think we ought
to take a chance?

417
00:20:44,111 --> 00:20:47,829
Global 33, you're cleared
to land on runway 22.

418
00:20:47,864 --> 00:20:50,949
Altimeter 29-88,
winds south, ten miles per hour.

419
00:20:50,984 --> 00:20:52,834
The captain is to report

420
00:20:52,869 --> 00:20:56,588
to the c.a.a. Office immediately
after landing.

421
00:20:56,623 --> 00:20:58,457
Roger, we'll
keep in touch.

422
00:20:58,707 --> 00:20:59,958
C.a.a.?

423
00:20:59,993 --> 00:21:03,095
They haven't called the
federal aviation agency

424
00:21:03,712 --> 00:21:04,963
c.a.a. In years.

425
00:21:04,998 --> 00:21:07,466
Now, we're going
down below, craig.

426
00:21:07,501 --> 00:21:09,351
Hit the horn button.

427
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:24,483
Skipper,
do you know what that is?

428
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,743
I know exactly what it is.

429
00:21:34,778 --> 00:21:37,879
It's the new york world's fair.

430
00:21:37,914 --> 00:21:39,131
The new york
world's fair?

431
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:41,633
But that means
we'd be back in...

432
00:21:41,668 --> 00:21:44,136
1939.

433
00:21:44,171 --> 00:21:45,387
We came back.

434
00:21:45,422 --> 00:21:47,255
We came back

435
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:51,009
but, dear god,
not far enough.

436
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:57,265
We can't land...

437
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:00,402
we can't land
at la guardia.

438
00:22:00,437 --> 00:22:02,270
We can't land
in 1939.

439
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:07,909
We've got
to try again.

440
00:22:07,944 --> 00:22:11,029
What about the passengers?

441
00:22:14,783 --> 00:22:19,171
I think...
we better let them in on it.

442
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:25,427
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain.

443
00:22:25,462 --> 00:22:28,547
What i'm about to tell you...

444
00:22:28,582 --> 00:22:30,432
what i'm about to tell you

445
00:22:30,467 --> 00:22:32,934
is something i can't
explain myself.

446
00:22:32,969 --> 00:22:35,437
Your crew is as much in the dark
as you are.

447
00:22:35,472 --> 00:22:39,808
If you look out from the
left-hand side of this aircraft

448
00:22:39,843 --> 00:22:46,698
you'll see directly below
an area called lake success.

449
00:22:46,733 --> 00:22:49,818
Those buildings aren't
the united nations.

450
00:22:49,853 --> 00:22:54,206
They happen to be... they
happen to be the world's fair.

451
00:22:54,241 --> 00:22:57,959
What i'm trying to tell you is

452
00:22:57,994 --> 00:23:02,964
that somehow, some way,
in some manner

453
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:09,838
this aircraft has gone back
into time and it's 1939

454
00:23:09,873 --> 00:23:12,974
but we're going to try
to increase our speed

455
00:23:13,009 --> 00:23:15,477
and go back
through the same sound barrier

456
00:23:15,512 --> 00:23:17,979
we've already done twice before.

457
00:23:18,014 --> 00:23:21,099
I don't know if we can do it.

458
00:23:21,134 --> 00:23:27,355
All i ask of you is that
you remain calm and pray.

459
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:32,994
A global jet airliner
en route from london to new york

460
00:23:33,029 --> 00:23:36,114
on an uneventful afternoon
in the year 1961

461
00:23:36,149 --> 00:23:38,617
but now reported overdue
and missing

462
00:23:38,652 --> 00:23:41,119
and by now searched
for on land, sea and air

463
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:44,873
by anguished human beings,
fearful of what they'll find

464
00:23:44,908 --> 00:23:47,375
but you and i know where she is.

465
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:49,261
You and i know what's happened.

466
00:23:49,296 --> 00:23:51,129
So if some moment, any moment

467
00:23:51,164 --> 00:23:53,014
you hear the sound
of jet engines

468
00:23:53,049 --> 00:23:54,266
flying atop the overcast

469
00:23:54,883 --> 00:23:56,768
engines that sound
searching and lost

470
00:23:56,803 --> 00:23:59,137
engines that sound desperate

471
00:23:59,172 --> 00:24:01,640
shoot up a flare
or do something.

472
00:24:01,675 --> 00:24:04,776
That would be global 33
trying to get home

473
00:24:04,811 --> 00:24:07,279
from the twilight zone.

474
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:15,036
Rod serling, creator
ofthe twilight zone

475
00:24:15,071 --> 00:24:16,905
will tell you
about next week's story

476
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:19,391
after this word
from our alternate sponsor.

477
00:24:19,426 --> 00:24:21,793
And now, mr. Serling.

478
00:24:21,828 --> 00:24:23,044
I've only got about 18 seconds

479
00:24:23,079 --> 00:24:26,164
to tell you that next week
mr. Burgess meredith returns

480
00:24:26,199 --> 00:24:29,301
tothe twilight zone
as mr. Dingle the strong.

481
00:24:29,336 --> 00:24:31,169
He plays the role
of an incredible little man

482
00:24:31,204 --> 00:24:33,054
who's given the strength
of about 500 men

483
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:36,174
and comes out of it as a kind
of 20th century hercules

484
00:24:36,209 --> 00:24:37,425
and samson all rolled into one.

485
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:39,311
Its designed to send you right
from your set

486
00:24:39,346 --> 00:24:40,562
into a fast bowl of spinach.

487
00:24:43,717 --> 00:24:44,933
It's catching.
