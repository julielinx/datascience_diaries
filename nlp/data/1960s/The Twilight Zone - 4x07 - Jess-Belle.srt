1
00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:10,727
You unlock this door
with the key of imagination.

2
00:00:10,762 --> 00:00:13,229
Beyond it is another dimension-

3
00:00:13,264 --> 00:00:15,115
a dimension of sound,

4
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,983
a dimension of sight,

5
00:00:17,018 --> 00:00:19,486
a dimension of mind.

6
00:00:19,521 --> 00:00:22,622
You're moving into a land
of both shadow and substance,

7
00:00:22,657 --> 00:00:24,491
of things and ideas.

8
00:00:24,526 --> 00:00:28,878
You've just crossed over
into the twilight zone.

9
00:01:12,922 --> 00:01:14,174
Billy-ben?

10
00:01:32,308 --> 00:01:34,194
You're late.

11
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:36,696
Sure i'm late,
pretty thing.

12
00:01:36,731 --> 00:01:39,199
I've been in
town today.

13
00:01:39,234 --> 00:01:41,067
How come you didn't
take me with you?

14
00:01:41,102 --> 00:01:42,952
Well, i did the
next best thing.

15
00:01:42,987 --> 00:01:44,821
I thought about you
every step of the way.

16
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:48,708
You got a sweet
and lying tongue.

17
00:01:48,743 --> 00:01:51,211
You are a fair thing.

18
00:01:51,246 --> 00:01:53,079
What'd you do in town?

19
00:01:58,084 --> 00:02:00,336
Will you stop that?

20
00:02:00,371 --> 00:02:01,588
What are folks gonna say?

21
00:02:01,623 --> 00:02:03,473
Well, ain't nobody out here

22
00:02:03,508 --> 00:02:05,341
except you and me
and the man in the moon.

23
00:02:05,376 --> 00:02:09,095
You're a right high-spirited man
to have walked to town and back.

24
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:11,598
Well, i went for
a right high-
spirited reason.

25
00:02:11,633 --> 00:02:13,483
Now close your eyes.
I got something for you.

26
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:24,744
You can open them now.

27
00:02:26,863 --> 00:02:29,365
It's the prettiest thing
i ever did see!

28
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,502
Oh, billy!

29
00:02:32,537 --> 00:02:35,004
I'm proud enough to cry.

30
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:47,884
I love you...
with all my enduring life.

31
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:50,386
And i the
same for you.

32
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,643
Can i show it
to everybody?

33
00:02:56,678 --> 00:02:59,145
If that'd bring
you pleasure.

34
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,648
How the girls
are going to envy me.

35
00:03:16,546 --> 00:03:18,414
Folks.

36
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:25,922
Now that everybody's here,
i'm proud to bid you welcome.

37
00:03:25,957 --> 00:03:31,561
Now, i want everybody to dance
until you wear out the fiddler.

38
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:34,564
And i want everybody to eat

39
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:38,318
until you had to let out
your belts to the last notch.

40
00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:42,689
The land was good
to me this year.

41
00:03:42,724 --> 00:03:43,940
The good lord
blessed it

42
00:03:43,975 --> 00:03:47,694
with rain
when rain was needed

43
00:03:47,729 --> 00:03:50,196
and a kindly sun
to follow.

44
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:53,833
And this barn is heavy
with the yield of it.

45
00:03:53,868 --> 00:03:54,834
Amen.

46
00:03:54,869 --> 00:03:57,337
But that's just
one of the reasons

47
00:03:57,372 --> 00:03:59,205
we're celebrating
here tonight.

48
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,959
A decent, good and true man
has come to me

49
00:04:02,994 --> 00:04:06,095
and asked for the hand
of my daughter, ellwyn,

50
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:07,964
and she has

51
00:04:07,999 --> 00:04:09,465
my endearing love

52
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:13,603
and my blessing
to marry...

53
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:15,221
billy-ben turner.

54
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:18,107
And now,
good people,

55
00:04:18,142 --> 00:04:20,610
the food and drink
are at your pleasure.

56
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:28,117
Wonder what's wrong
with jess-belle.

57
00:04:28,152 --> 00:04:29,986
Going home early,
i reckon.

58
00:04:30,021 --> 00:04:31,237
Why don't you go see

59
00:04:31,272 --> 00:04:33,740
if you can't talk
her into coming back?

60
00:04:33,775 --> 00:04:36,876
She'll come back
if she's of a mind to.

61
00:04:36,911 --> 00:04:39,379
Well, evening's
young yet.

62
00:04:39,414 --> 00:04:41,881
It'd spoil my party
if folks leave early.

63
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:44,384
Well, l-i...
go on ahead,
honey.

64
00:04:45,001 --> 00:04:46,886
Go on.

65
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,655
Jess-belle.

66
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:07,523
Don't you
come near me.

67
00:05:07,558 --> 00:05:10,777
I thought you might want
to wish us well, jess.

68
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:13,913
You'll have nothing from me.

69
00:05:13,948 --> 00:05:17,033
No need for you to take on so.

70
00:05:17,068 --> 00:05:18,918
What'd you want me to do?

71
00:05:18,953 --> 00:05:20,787
Run in there,
throw my arms around her,

72
00:05:20,822 --> 00:05:22,038
tell her how glad i am?

73
00:05:22,073 --> 00:05:24,540
Jess, i'm sorry.

74
00:05:25,174 --> 00:05:26,426
Remember the night
we clung together

75
00:05:26,461 --> 00:05:30,179
in the sweet night grass
down by eagle rock mountain?

76
00:05:30,214 --> 00:05:33,933
The moonlight made us see
a silver mist on the fog below.

77
00:05:33,968 --> 00:05:36,436
I remember.

78
00:05:36,471 --> 00:05:38,938
The day we ran through
the scotch broom field,

79
00:05:38,973 --> 00:05:40,807
and the sun was
blazing hot,

80
00:05:40,842 --> 00:05:43,309
and we fell
together...

81
00:05:43,344 --> 00:05:46,446
and you touched me?

82
00:05:46,481 --> 00:05:50,817
The fire in me burned
as hot as the white sun.

83
00:05:50,852 --> 00:05:52,702
The fire's turned
to ashes now, jess.

84
00:05:52,737 --> 00:05:54,570
It still
burns- here.

85
00:05:54,605 --> 00:05:56,456
But it's different
with ellwyn and me.

86
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:01,461
Pretty clothes
and her daddy's land?

87
00:06:01,496 --> 00:06:02,712
Is that the difference,
billy-ben?

88
00:06:02,747 --> 00:06:06,466
No. No, that's not
the difference.

89
00:06:06,501 --> 00:06:10,219
I... i love her
in a... quiet way.

90
00:06:10,254 --> 00:06:11,471
You know, it...

91
00:06:11,506 --> 00:06:13,973
i don't want to hear.

92
00:06:18,728 --> 00:06:19,979
Billy-ben.

93
00:06:22,598 --> 00:06:24,600
Tell your love a thing from me,
will you?

94
00:06:24,635 --> 00:06:25,852
What's that?

95
00:06:25,887 --> 00:06:28,988
Tell her not to start making
her wedding dress right yet.

96
00:06:29,023 --> 00:06:31,491
Why should i tell her
a thing like that?

97
00:06:31,526 --> 00:06:34,494
She ain't married you yet,
billy-ben.

98
00:06:34,529 --> 00:06:36,362
Maybe she never will.

99
00:06:36,397 --> 00:06:39,749
? fair was elly glover?

100
00:06:39,784 --> 00:06:43,503
? dark was jess-belle?

101
00:06:43,538 --> 00:06:47,256
? both they loved the same man?

102
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:52,261
? and both
they loved him well.?

103
00:06:52,296 --> 00:06:56,382
The twilight zone has existed
in many lands, in many times.

104
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:58,134
It has roots in history,

105
00:06:58,169 --> 00:07:00,019
in something that happened
long, long ago,

106
00:07:00,054 --> 00:07:01,888
and got told about

107
00:07:01,923 --> 00:07:04,524
and handed down from one
generation of folk to the other.

108
00:07:04,559 --> 00:07:07,643
In the telling, the story gets
added to and embroidered on

109
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:10,780
so that what might have happened
in the time of the druids

110
00:07:10,815 --> 00:07:12,648
is told as if it took place
yesterday

111
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:13,900
in the blue ridge mountains.

112
00:07:13,935 --> 00:07:17,036
Such stories are best told
by an elderly grandfather

113
00:07:17,071 --> 00:07:19,539
on a cold winter's night
by the fireside...

114
00:07:19,574 --> 00:07:22,658
in the southern hills
of the twilight zone.

115
00:07:28,631 --> 00:07:33,002
? graveyard dust?

116
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:38,641
? and breast of dove?

117
00:07:38,676 --> 00:07:43,646
? bubble, bubble?

118
00:07:43,681 --> 00:07:48,651
? wine of love...?

119
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:06,419
Granny hart?

120
00:08:06,454 --> 00:08:09,672
Well, what you bothering
an old woman for

121
00:08:09,707 --> 00:08:11,541
this time of night?

122
00:08:11,576 --> 00:08:13,426
I got to talk to you.

123
00:08:13,461 --> 00:08:15,294
Well, sit down.

124
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:19,682
Folks say you
got a power.

125
00:08:19,717 --> 00:08:22,802
Oh, folks say
a lot of things.

126
00:08:22,837 --> 00:08:25,188
They say mose crowley's
cow sickened and died

127
00:08:25,223 --> 00:08:27,056
when he shot that
hawk you used to keep.

128
00:08:27,091 --> 00:08:29,559
Well, that hawk
was my pet.

129
00:08:29,594 --> 00:08:32,061
He used to roost
in that big black pine

130
00:08:32,096 --> 00:08:33,946
right outside the door.

131
00:08:33,981 --> 00:08:37,450
When molly unger's
baby was a-dyin'
of a fever,

132
00:08:37,485 --> 00:08:39,318
she went somewhere and
got a potion for him.

133
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:40,570
Folks say she
came here.

134
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:41,704
She did.

135
00:08:41,739 --> 00:08:44,824
And that little baby lived,
didn't he?

136
00:08:44,859 --> 00:08:45,958
Lived?

137
00:08:45,993 --> 00:08:47,827
But he's accursed with fits.

138
00:08:47,862 --> 00:08:49,078
Oh.

139
00:08:49,113 --> 00:08:52,832
His mama won't let
him out of the house.

140
00:08:52,867 --> 00:08:55,334
What else do they say about me?

141
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:58,471
They say you're a witch.

142
00:09:01,259 --> 00:09:04,343
Oh, sugar,
if i was a witch,

143
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:06,229
i'd be out riding around
on my broom

144
00:09:06,264 --> 00:09:08,097
instead of sitting
'round here alone,

145
00:09:08,731 --> 00:09:11,851
minding my own business.

146
00:09:11,886 --> 00:09:15,605
Whatever you are...
will you help me?

147
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,490
Well, it depends, sugar.

148
00:09:17,525 --> 00:09:19,742
I want to win
a man's love.

149
00:09:20,243 --> 00:09:23,996
Well... womankind, jess,

150
00:09:24,031 --> 00:09:26,499
got her own kind
of witchcraft for that.

151
00:09:26,534 --> 00:09:29,502
He was mine for a while.

152
00:09:29,537 --> 00:09:31,370
Came sneaking off at night,

153
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:33,873
kept a-quiet what went on
between him and me.

154
00:09:33,908 --> 00:09:36,375
Never took me anyplace
for the world to know.

155
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:39,512
He made me promises.

156
00:09:39,547 --> 00:09:42,632
He made them when his face
was hot as blood.

157
00:09:42,667 --> 00:09:45,134
Forgot them as soon as he was
ten feet from my door.

158
00:09:46,135 --> 00:09:48,020
Honey...

159
00:09:48,055 --> 00:09:51,140
you don't know much
about men, do you?

160
00:09:51,175 --> 00:09:52,525
Only him.

161
00:09:53,776 --> 00:09:55,027
What man?

162
00:09:55,062 --> 00:09:56,779
Billy-ben turner.

163
00:09:56,814 --> 00:10:00,283
Oh, he is a pretty one

164
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:04,654
with nice, big, strong arms
to hold a gal.

165
00:10:04,689 --> 00:10:07,907
Can you make him
love me the way he
did a long time ago,

166
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:11,043
when a night wouldn't
pass but what he had
to come to see me?

167
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:13,412
How much money
did you bring me?

168
00:10:14,163 --> 00:10:16,048
I don't have
any money.

169
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:19,168
Well, how did
you expect to pay me?

170
00:10:19,203 --> 00:10:21,671
I'll give you my
pearl hairpin.

171
00:10:21,706 --> 00:10:23,556
It's a real pearl,

172
00:10:23,591 --> 00:10:24,807
brought back
from overseas

173
00:10:24,842 --> 00:10:26,676
by my daddy in
one of the wars,

174
00:10:26,711 --> 00:10:29,812
and the stick's
real silver.

175
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:32,932
Take it
out of my sight.

176
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:39,188
Is that all you got
to offer me?

177
00:10:39,223 --> 00:10:41,691
That's everything
on earth i own,

178
00:10:41,726 --> 00:10:44,827
except the clothes
on my back.

179
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:50,449
Well, honey,
you better run along home

180
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:54,203
and live your life
without billy-ben turner.

181
00:10:54,238 --> 00:10:58,207
I don't have any
life without him.

182
00:10:58,242 --> 00:11:00,710
You got to help me.

183
00:11:03,846 --> 00:11:09,101
Well, i got something
i could give you, but...

184
00:11:09,136 --> 00:11:11,604
the price is high.

185
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:14,106
What is the price?

186
00:11:15,858 --> 00:11:22,114
You'll know
in the midnight hour of time.

187
00:11:24,233 --> 00:11:26,736
Whatever it is, i'll pay.

188
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,518
Drink.

189
00:12:35,938 --> 00:12:37,807
Does he love me now?

190
00:12:37,842 --> 00:12:41,444
After his eyes fall next on you,

191
00:12:41,479 --> 00:12:43,562
he'll never look
at another woman

192
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:46,065
as long as he can look
at you.

193
00:12:48,818 --> 00:12:50,069
? then form a ring?

194
00:12:50,104 --> 00:12:51,954
? flick that ring
with a corner swing?

195
00:12:51,989 --> 00:12:54,457
? now do-sl-do to your own
down the line?

196
00:12:54,492 --> 00:12:56,959
? now promenade,
go two by two?

197
00:12:56,994 --> 00:12:58,828
? walk back home
like you always do?

198
00:12:58,863 --> 00:13:01,831
? now you all join hands,
form a ring?

199
00:13:01,866 --> 00:13:03,082
? circle right
with the pretty little thing?

200
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:12,725
? now break that ring
with a corner swing?

201
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,845
? go back home, do-sl-do?

202
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,597
? now it's promenade,
go 'round the town...?

203
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,608
I never
in my life...

204
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:32,111
what come
over that boy?

205
00:13:32,146 --> 00:13:34,613
Whatever it was,
he'll answer
to me for it.

206
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:37,116
It's a shame
and a disgrace.

207
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:40,252
If billy-ben expects you
to marry him after this,

208
00:13:40,287 --> 00:13:42,121
he'll have
to think again.

209
00:13:42,156 --> 00:13:44,006
He won't be marrying me.

210
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:47,760
Well, i'm glad to see
you got spirit, child.

211
00:13:47,795 --> 00:13:50,262
I'd still have him
if i could.

212
00:13:50,297 --> 00:13:54,016
If he were to come back
in here this very minute,

213
00:13:54,051 --> 00:13:56,519
i'd just go running
to him.

214
00:13:56,554 --> 00:14:00,272
I'd not allow you
to shame yourself
like that.

215
00:14:00,307 --> 00:14:03,392
He won't be back.

216
00:14:03,427 --> 00:14:06,529
I won't even get
the chance.

217
00:14:06,564 --> 00:14:09,648
Jess-belle bewitched him.

218
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:16,539
You're enough
to drive a man crazy.

219
00:14:16,574 --> 00:14:19,658
You're sure a master
hand with the sweet
words, billy-ben.

220
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:21,544
When we're married,

221
00:14:21,579 --> 00:14:25,297
it'll be a hateful thing
to leave you in the morning.

222
00:14:25,332 --> 00:14:27,166
I won't let you leave.

223
00:14:27,201 --> 00:14:29,051
Going to lock
the door

224
00:14:29,086 --> 00:14:30,920
and keep you
home all day.

225
00:14:30,955 --> 00:14:34,306
How'll we live
if i don't work my land?

226
00:14:34,341 --> 00:14:35,558
When you're
in the fields,

227
00:14:35,593 --> 00:14:37,426
i'll hide behind
a juniper tree,

228
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:39,311
sing songs to tease
you home again.

229
00:14:39,929 --> 00:14:40,563
And where will
the money come from

230
00:14:40,598 --> 00:14:43,682
for the pretties
i'll buy you?

231
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:45,568
What will
you buy me?

232
00:14:45,603 --> 00:14:48,070
I don't know,
maybe dresses of silk

233
00:14:48,105 --> 00:14:49,939
and combs
for your hair.

234
00:14:53,442 --> 00:14:56,695
Looks like the
moon's going down.

235
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:57,329
I better go.

236
00:14:57,947 --> 00:14:58,581
I won't let you.

237
00:14:58,616 --> 00:14:59,832
I'm going to keep you here
all night.

238
00:14:59,867 --> 00:15:01,083
I can't.
Why not?

239
00:15:01,118 --> 00:15:02,952
Mama's home, and
she's waiting for me.

240
00:15:02,987 --> 00:15:04,203
Why, you never worried
about mama before.

241
00:15:04,238 --> 00:15:05,454
Let go of me,
billy-ben.

242
00:15:05,489 --> 00:15:06,705
I want you to stay here
with me.

243
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,208
Billy-ben,
let go of me!

244
00:15:11,093 --> 00:15:12,962
Sorry.

245
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:16,098
It don't matter.

246
00:15:16,133 --> 00:15:19,852
Nothing can change
the love i hold for you.

247
00:15:19,887 --> 00:15:22,354
Then take me home.

248
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,992
Good night.

249
00:15:43,027 --> 00:15:43,626
Just one more kiss.

250
00:15:43,661 --> 00:15:45,494
No.

251
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:47,997
Who's that
brought you home?

252
00:15:48,032 --> 00:15:50,499
Oh, jess-belle,
don't go right to bed.

253
00:15:50,534 --> 00:15:51,750
Come sit a spell

254
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:53,636
and tell me
about the dance.

255
00:15:53,671 --> 00:15:55,504
Jess-belle, don't...

256
00:16:22,464 --> 00:16:25,284
? by day, she knew
a woman's form?

257
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:29,038
? by night, a witch's spell?

258
00:16:29,073 --> 00:16:32,174
? for love of billy turner?

259
00:16:32,209 --> 00:16:35,928
? accursed was jess-belle.?

260
00:16:35,963 --> 00:16:37,796
Well, i didn't mean
to frighten you.

261
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:39,048
Hold out your hand.

262
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:40,933
I got something
for you.

263
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:46,305
Elly's ring.

264
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,190
Jess-belle's ring.

265
00:16:48,225 --> 00:16:50,059
It belongs to
the one i love,

266
00:16:50,094 --> 00:16:51,310
and the one i
love is you.

267
00:16:51,345 --> 00:16:53,812
Every minute i'm
away from you

268
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:55,064
is a suffering
and a torment.

269
00:16:55,099 --> 00:16:56,949
Suffering and torment.

270
00:16:56,984 --> 00:17:00,069
You know what suffering
and torment means?

271
00:17:00,104 --> 00:17:01,954
Sure.

272
00:17:01,989 --> 00:17:04,456
It's having a girl that
your heart's craving

273
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:06,325
and have her
keep putting the
wedding day off.

274
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:10,079
All kinds of torment
in the world, i reckon.

275
00:17:10,114 --> 00:17:11,964
What would you know
of torment, girl?

276
00:17:11,999 --> 00:17:15,084
There's a torment comes
from buying something

277
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,586
and finding out
the price is dear.

278
00:17:17,621 --> 00:17:20,723
What did you buy
that cost so dear?

279
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:23,225
Something i love.

280
00:17:25,094 --> 00:17:27,596
Do you still love
it, though the
price was high?

281
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:30,733
Better than life.

282
00:17:30,768 --> 00:17:31,984
Better than me?

283
00:17:33,235 --> 00:17:35,738
Ain't nothing i love
better than you.

284
00:17:35,773 --> 00:17:38,857
I went to see
the preacher today, jess.

285
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:42,494
What'd you want with him?

286
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:45,247
Well, you wouldn't set the date,
so i went ahead and set it.

287
00:17:45,282 --> 00:17:46,749
He's going to marry
us come next sunday.

288
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:48,617
I can't be ready by then.

289
00:17:48,652 --> 00:17:49,251
Why not?

290
00:17:49,286 --> 00:17:50,502
I talked to
your mama.

291
00:17:50,537 --> 00:17:52,371
She said your
wedding dress
will be sewed.

292
00:17:52,406 --> 00:17:54,123
And my house is clean.

293
00:17:54,158 --> 00:17:56,625
Everything new
and waiting for you.

294
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:00,763
You haven't changed your mind,
have you, jess?

295
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,765
No.

296
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,767
Then why do you keep putting off
the wedding date?

297
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:07,386
I can't tell you, billy-ben.

298
00:18:07,421 --> 00:18:09,521
Shouldn't be any secrets
between us.

299
00:18:10,773 --> 00:18:14,526
I'm going away from you
for a while.

300
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:17,646
I'll give you my word
when i come back.

301
00:18:17,681 --> 00:18:19,031
Oh, stay now, jess.

302
00:18:19,148 --> 00:18:20,399
I got a craving
to be with you
every minute.

303
00:18:20,434 --> 00:18:22,284
Let go of me, billy.
I never knew a man

304
00:18:22,651 --> 00:18:24,536
could have such a love
as i hold for you.

305
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:25,154
There's no peace from it.

306
00:18:25,189 --> 00:18:27,039
It burns night
and day.

307
00:18:27,074 --> 00:18:28,290
I got a terrible
yearning.

308
00:18:53,816 --> 00:18:55,067
Didn't you hear me knocking?

309
00:18:55,102 --> 00:18:59,188
I never let trouble in the door
if i can help it.

310
00:18:59,223 --> 00:19:00,439
How you know i'm trouble?

311
00:19:00,474 --> 00:19:04,193
Why, child,
there ain't much i don't know.

312
00:19:04,228 --> 00:19:06,078
Well, then if
you know so much,

313
00:19:06,113 --> 00:19:07,329
maybe you can help me.

314
00:19:07,364 --> 00:19:09,832
Well, i already helped
you once.

315
00:19:09,867 --> 00:19:11,083
You want to change
your mind

316
00:19:11,118 --> 00:19:12,951
now that you got
what you wanted?

317
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:14,837
I haven't got
what i want.

318
00:19:14,872 --> 00:19:16,705
Oh, don't tell me

319
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,842
you haven't got the love
of billy-ben turner.

320
00:19:19,877 --> 00:19:21,710
I got his love,
all right,

321
00:19:21,745 --> 00:19:22,961
but i can't take it
for fear he'd find

322
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:26,098
the price i
paid for it.

323
00:19:26,133 --> 00:19:27,966
I tried to find pity
for him and for me,

324
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:29,218
but i can't.

325
00:19:29,253 --> 00:19:31,103
It's like my heart's
been cut out

326
00:19:31,138 --> 00:19:32,354
and stone put where
the heart was.

327
00:19:32,389 --> 00:19:34,223
Oh, that ain't
your heart, honey.

328
00:19:34,258 --> 00:19:35,474
What then?

329
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:37,359
Oh, there's lots
of names for it-

330
00:19:37,394 --> 00:19:40,479
some folks
calls it "soul."

331
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:43,615
That was in the
bargain, too?

332
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:44,867
Oh, that's always
in the bargain

333
00:19:44,902 --> 00:19:46,735
if you barter...

334
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:49,238
with witches.

335
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:57,996
You said you
weren't a witch.

336
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:00,499
You said you
just had power!

337
00:20:00,534 --> 00:20:03,001
You might as well know
the truth, honey,

338
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:05,504
now that you're one, too.

339
00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:07,389
I changed you.

340
00:20:07,424 --> 00:20:09,508
Well, then change me back.

341
00:20:09,543 --> 00:20:12,010
Let me be a woman again.

342
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:14,396
Oh, you can't never change.

343
00:20:14,431 --> 00:20:18,150
What you are,
you're gonna be till you die.

344
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:21,019
Then i hope i die soon.

345
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:23,522
Well, you're looking
at it all wrong.

346
00:20:23,557 --> 00:20:28,527
Be a witch.
Take a witch's pleasure.

347
00:20:28,562 --> 00:20:32,281
Take the man you bargained for.

348
00:20:32,316 --> 00:20:34,416
Don't you think i want to?

349
00:20:34,451 --> 00:20:36,285
How long do you think
i'd keep him

350
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,421
if he finds out what happens
when the clock strikes 12:00?

351
00:20:39,456 --> 00:20:41,924
That's worst of all-

352
00:20:41,959 --> 00:20:44,293
not knowing
what i'm going to do,

353
00:20:44,328 --> 00:20:46,795
waking and not
knowing what
i've done.

354
00:20:47,429 --> 00:20:48,046
Change me back.

355
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:51,183
Please, i'll pay.
I promise i'll pay.

356
00:20:51,218 --> 00:20:54,803
Well, your promises
ain't much good.

357
00:20:54,838 --> 00:20:56,688
You're already trying
to get out of paying

358
00:20:56,723 --> 00:20:58,557
for the first favor i done you.

359
00:20:58,592 --> 00:21:00,692
I can't live this way.

360
00:21:00,727 --> 00:21:02,561
Please!

361
00:21:02,596 --> 00:21:06,698
Take the man you bargained for.

362
00:21:06,733 --> 00:21:09,818
Give him a witch's love.

363
00:21:09,853 --> 00:21:11,954
I can't do that to billy-ben.

364
00:21:11,989 --> 00:21:14,823
You paid the price.

365
00:21:14,858 --> 00:21:17,326
Take what you paid for.

366
00:21:17,361 --> 00:21:18,577
I can't do that

367
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:20,462
to billy-ben!

368
00:21:43,852 --> 00:21:45,103
Billy-ben.

369
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:46,989
Oh, jess.

370
00:21:47,024 --> 00:21:50,108
I've been out
of my mind.

371
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:52,611
I searched this whole
county over for you.

372
00:21:52,646 --> 00:21:54,496
Cursed myself every
step of the way

373
00:21:54,531 --> 00:21:57,616
for upsetting you
the way i did today.

374
00:21:57,651 --> 00:22:00,118
Jess, you hellcat,
where you been?

375
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:03,872
I went away... to think.

376
00:22:03,907 --> 00:22:06,375
And did you
think of me?

377
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:08,260
You were all
i thought about.

378
00:22:08,295 --> 00:22:11,380
And did you think
of me with love?

379
00:22:11,415 --> 00:22:13,265
Yes, billy.

380
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,767
Jess... i won't
crowd you

381
00:22:15,802 --> 00:22:18,270
on the wedding
day again.

382
00:22:18,305 --> 00:22:19,521
Now, whatever's
been troubling you,

383
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:22,641
you don't even
have to tell me.

384
00:22:22,676 --> 00:22:23,892
You just settle it

385
00:22:23,927 --> 00:22:25,777
and you can set
your own day

386
00:22:25,812 --> 00:22:27,029
for the wedding.

387
00:22:27,064 --> 00:22:29,531
There will be no wedding,
billy-ben.

388
00:22:30,148 --> 00:22:33,285
Oh, j-jess, don't say
a thing like that.

389
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,787
There will be no wedding.

390
00:22:35,822 --> 00:22:38,290
No wedding
between you and me.

391
00:22:38,325 --> 00:22:40,792
I'd as soon hear
my death bell as
what you're saying.

392
00:22:40,827 --> 00:22:43,912
I'd as soon hear
my own death bell as say it.

393
00:22:43,947 --> 00:22:45,797
Then forget
it was said.

394
00:22:45,832 --> 00:22:47,666
Oh, i love you, jess,

395
00:22:47,701 --> 00:22:50,168
and i want you
to be my wife.

396
00:22:50,203 --> 00:22:52,054
That's all i know.

397
00:22:52,089 --> 00:22:54,556
You would not want me
for long.

398
00:22:55,173 --> 00:22:57,059
One night, you'd turn
away from me.

399
00:22:57,094 --> 00:22:59,561
Oh, curse me
for a fool

400
00:22:59,596 --> 00:23:03,315
if that day
would ever come.

401
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:05,817
I set you free
from any promise, billy.

402
00:23:05,852 --> 00:23:08,320
Take this.

403
00:23:09,571 --> 00:23:10,822
No, it...

404
00:23:10,857 --> 00:23:13,325
this belongs here.

405
00:23:14,611 --> 00:23:16,445
You hear that?

406
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,581
It's a night bird
calling its mate.

407
00:23:19,616 --> 00:23:21,450
His mate won't come.

408
00:23:21,485 --> 00:23:25,587
I saw her on the trail tonight
winging up against the sky.

409
00:23:25,622 --> 00:23:28,707
The nighthawks swooped up
out of the pines

410
00:23:28,742 --> 00:23:30,592
and tore her breast open.

411
00:23:30,627 --> 00:23:31,460
She fell at my feet

412
00:23:31,495 --> 00:23:33,962
and ran off
in the bushes to die.

413
00:23:33,997 --> 00:23:36,465
It was just an omen, jess.

414
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,350
It don't mean
you're going to die.

415
00:23:38,385 --> 00:23:40,218
Billy-ben...

416
00:23:40,253 --> 00:23:43,972
if old man death came
walking down eagle rock trail,

417
00:23:44,007 --> 00:23:47,109
i'd run to meet him...

418
00:23:47,144 --> 00:23:50,228
and i'd beg him on my knees
to take me with him.

419
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:53,865
Jess, what's cursing you?

420
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,368
I got a right
to know.

421
00:23:58,620 --> 00:23:59,871
It's late.

422
00:23:59,906 --> 00:24:01,490
I got to go!

423
00:24:01,525 --> 00:24:02,124
Wait, jess.

424
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,243
Billy-ben, if you
love me, stand aside!

425
00:24:32,654 --> 00:24:34,523
Jess?

426
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:36,408
Jess-belle?

427
00:24:43,281 --> 00:24:45,167
Jess?

428
00:25:05,487 --> 00:25:09,241
Twilight zonewill continue
after station identification.

429
00:25:22,204 --> 00:25:24,673
? an awful night
was spent by all?

430
00:25:24,708 --> 00:25:27,676
? on eagle rock who dwell?

431
00:25:27,711 --> 00:25:32,063
? strange things were seen
by moonlight's pall?

432
00:25:32,098 --> 00:25:38,320
? but none saw jess-belle.?

433
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:00,959
Take the man you bargained for.

434
00:26:00,994 --> 00:26:04,713
Give him a witch's love.

435
00:26:05,347 --> 00:26:07,849
Nothing can change you, sugar.

436
00:26:07,884 --> 00:26:10,101
Witch you are,

437
00:26:10,136 --> 00:26:14,472
and witch you'll always be.

438
00:26:14,507 --> 00:26:16,975
You've paid the price.

439
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:19,477
Take what you've paid for.

440
00:26:19,512 --> 00:26:23,231
Take what
you've paid for.

441
00:26:23,266 --> 00:26:29,487
Take what you've paid for.

442
00:26:32,525 --> 00:26:35,627
Billy-ben?

443
00:26:36,913 --> 00:26:39,381
Billy-ben?

444
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:54,396
Jess.

445
00:26:54,431 --> 00:26:56,264
Jess, what's the matter?

446
00:26:56,299 --> 00:26:58,767
Now, why has something
got to be the matter?

447
00:26:58,802 --> 00:27:01,903
I just wanted to see you.

448
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,782
I never saw
such a night.

449
00:27:13,817 --> 00:27:17,535
The animals kept moving around
and crying out.

450
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:19,421
Cow got fractious

451
00:27:19,456 --> 00:27:23,174
and tried to kick out
the side of the stall.

452
00:27:23,209 --> 00:27:25,043
The sheep was bleatin'.

453
00:27:25,078 --> 00:27:27,545
Look-look like
they were looking

454
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,431
in the jaws of wolves.

455
00:27:29,466 --> 00:27:30,682
I had to go out there
two or three times

456
00:27:30,717 --> 00:27:31,933
and quiet 'em down.

457
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:35,053
I'll fix your
breakfast for you.

458
00:27:36,304 --> 00:27:39,441
Well, now, that's my girl.

459
00:27:41,309 --> 00:27:44,446
I'll, uh, fix
the fire for you.

460
00:27:44,481 --> 00:27:46,564
I'll fix it for you
every morning.

461
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,320
And your dinner and your supper,
too, if you let me.

462
00:27:52,355 --> 00:27:56,074
Well, honey, haven't i been
begging you to do just that?

463
00:27:56,109 --> 00:27:57,959
Then next sunday,

464
00:27:57,994 --> 00:28:01,079
come what may,
i'll be your wife.

465
00:28:15,844 --> 00:28:17,729
Hello, jess.

466
00:28:17,764 --> 00:28:20,849
You're a long way from
home, elly glover.

467
00:28:23,485 --> 00:28:27,238
Lots of wildflowers around here.

468
00:28:27,273 --> 00:28:30,358
Saw a patch of old maid's fern
up on the mountain.

469
00:28:32,243 --> 00:28:35,363
I notice a lot of vixenwort
around here myself.

470
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:41,119
I just came
from billy-ben's.

471
00:28:41,154 --> 00:28:43,621
Fixed his breakfast
for him.

472
00:28:44,873 --> 00:28:49,878
Well... i reckon
that's no concern of mine.

473
00:28:53,014 --> 00:28:54,883
Circuit preacher's
gonna marry us

474
00:28:54,918 --> 00:28:56,768
when he comes around
next sunday.

475
00:28:58,887 --> 00:29:02,023
Well, i wish you happiness...

476
00:29:02,058 --> 00:29:03,892
for his sake.

477
00:29:04,893 --> 00:29:06,778
You still love him, elly?

478
00:29:06,813 --> 00:29:09,280
The last time
i saw billy-ben turner's face,

479
00:29:09,315 --> 00:29:11,783
he was under a magic spell...

480
00:29:11,818 --> 00:29:16,154
and even the love i hold for him
couldn't break it.

481
00:29:16,189 --> 00:29:19,908
There's ways,
but such ways end bad.

482
00:29:19,943 --> 00:29:22,410
What ways you talking about?

483
00:29:22,445 --> 00:29:23,912
I think you know.

484
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:32,053
Jealous, ain't you?

485
00:29:32,088 --> 00:29:34,556
No.

486
00:29:35,173 --> 00:29:37,058
I'm heartsick

487
00:29:37,093 --> 00:29:40,178
to see wrong done
to a good man.

488
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:45,567
I got news there's a wildcat
loose in the county.

489
00:29:45,602 --> 00:29:47,435
Ain't you scared
to be up here alone?

490
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:49,687
I'll be home by dark.

491
00:29:49,722 --> 00:29:51,573
That cat won't venture out
until nightfall.

492
00:29:51,608 --> 00:29:55,326
Can't tell what a wildcat
will do.

493
00:29:55,361 --> 00:29:58,830
Well, i reckon
we don't have much to fear.

494
00:29:58,865 --> 00:30:01,950
My daddy says that killer cat's
going to be dead by morning.

495
00:30:01,985 --> 00:30:04,202
Oh?

496
00:30:04,237 --> 00:30:06,087
Since when your daddy been able
to look in the future

497
00:30:06,122 --> 00:30:07,338
and tell what's going to be?

498
00:30:07,373 --> 00:30:10,458
Why, he's going hunting
for that cat tonight.

499
00:30:10,493 --> 00:30:13,595
Him, and obed miller,
and billy-ben, and all the men.

500
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:16,848
Billy-ben never said nothing
to me about going.

501
00:30:16,883 --> 00:30:19,350
Obed miller just went over
and asked him.

502
00:30:19,385 --> 00:30:20,969
I reckon that cat

503
00:30:21,004 --> 00:30:23,471
better stay home tonight
if it's smart.

504
00:30:24,973 --> 00:30:26,858
I reckon.

505
00:30:35,617 --> 00:30:37,485
What's the matter
with you tonight, jess?

506
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:40,622
You just as nervous
as a fox in a forest fire.

507
00:30:40,657 --> 00:30:44,375
You gonna take all night
with that hem, mama?

508
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:46,744
You never would've had
such a fine dress

509
00:30:46,779 --> 00:30:47,996
without billy-ben havin'
given me the money.

510
00:30:48,031 --> 00:30:50,498
You know that, don't you?

511
00:30:50,533 --> 00:30:53,635
Saw old elly glover today.

512
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:56,137
She was picking wildflowers
up on the mountain.

513
00:30:56,172 --> 00:30:57,255
How'd she look?

514
00:30:57,290 --> 00:31:00,508
Looked sickly,
like she might die soon.

515
00:31:00,543 --> 00:31:03,394
I didn't even know
the poor thing was ailing.

516
00:31:03,429 --> 00:31:04,896
Looked terrible.

517
00:31:04,931 --> 00:31:07,398
There, now you
can get out of it

518
00:31:07,433 --> 00:31:08,650
and hand it to me.

519
00:31:08,685 --> 00:31:09,901
I ought to make

520
00:31:09,936 --> 00:31:11,152
some of that tonic
i used to make

521
00:31:11,187 --> 00:31:12,403
and take it to her.

522
00:31:12,438 --> 00:31:14,272
You and your tonics.

523
00:31:14,307 --> 00:31:16,774
You're worse
than granny ha...

524
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:21,162
granny hart?

525
00:31:21,197 --> 00:31:23,031
Well, everyone knows

526
00:31:23,066 --> 00:31:25,533
she sells them old potions
and things.

527
00:31:25,568 --> 00:31:29,287
She ain't sold none
to you, has she?

528
00:31:29,921 --> 00:31:33,041
Don't talk crazy talk.

529
00:31:33,076 --> 00:31:36,794
Is that what made
billy-ben turner blind

530
00:31:36,829 --> 00:31:39,297
to every other woman on
earth save jess-belle?

531
00:31:40,548 --> 00:31:42,433
Where would i get
the money

532
00:31:42,468 --> 00:31:43,685
for potions and powders?

533
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:47,188
That old woman don't
always ask for money.

534
00:31:47,223 --> 00:31:51,559
That's what makes my
heart turn cold as ice.

535
00:31:51,594 --> 00:31:54,696
Jess, how did
you pay her?

536
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:05,707
Oh, god, jess, how
did you pay her?!

537
00:32:08,826 --> 00:32:11,329
With my flesh
and my blood...

538
00:32:11,364 --> 00:32:14,465
and my soul...

539
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,334
and my brain...

540
00:32:16,369 --> 00:32:20,088
and my sleep...

541
00:32:20,123 --> 00:32:22,590
and my hands...

542
00:32:22,625 --> 00:32:25,727
and my heart and my head.

543
00:32:26,594 --> 00:32:30,348
I paid dear
for billy-ben.

544
00:32:30,383 --> 00:32:31,599
Jess!

545
00:32:31,634 --> 00:32:33,484
Kneel down with me.

546
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,353
It's too late, mama.

547
00:32:35,388 --> 00:32:37,855
We'll pray to
god to help you.

548
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:41,609
My prayers aren't answered
in heaven anymore.

549
00:32:42,243 --> 00:32:44,746
I'll think of a way
to help you.

550
00:32:44,781 --> 00:32:46,748
You can do one thing

551
00:32:46,783 --> 00:32:51,119
if you want to see me alive
in the morning.

552
00:32:51,154 --> 00:32:53,621
Bolt my door
when i go to bed tonight.

553
00:32:53,656 --> 00:32:54,872
No matter what happens,

554
00:32:54,907 --> 00:32:58,009
don't open that door
until morning.

555
00:33:54,315 --> 00:33:56,184
Hold it, men.

556
00:33:56,219 --> 00:33:58,069
I think old blaze
has found something.

557
00:33:58,686 --> 00:34:00,571
Let's go.

558
00:34:00,606 --> 00:34:02,440
I think he's struck trail.

559
00:34:10,733 --> 00:34:12,583
What's the matter, blue?

560
00:34:12,618 --> 00:34:15,703
You having
a bad dream?

561
00:34:15,738 --> 00:34:18,339
Something scare you?

562
00:34:18,374 --> 00:34:19,590
You're going to be
all right now.

563
00:34:19,625 --> 00:34:21,459
Just calm down
and go back to sleep.

564
00:34:21,494 --> 00:34:23,211
It's going to
be all right.

565
00:34:41,863 --> 00:34:43,731
Elly!

566
00:34:46,234 --> 00:34:48,736
Elly.

567
00:34:51,407 --> 00:34:53,991
I ain't ever seen no cat
with spots like that.

568
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:02,383
A witch.

569
00:35:02,418 --> 00:35:04,252
That cat was a witch.

570
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,761
Well...

571
00:35:14,395 --> 00:35:17,515
our work is done
for this night.

572
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:18,766
Come on, elly.

573
00:35:18,801 --> 00:35:20,651
Come on.

574
00:35:25,022 --> 00:35:27,525
What ails you, billy-ben?

575
00:35:28,276 --> 00:35:30,161
Nothing.

576
00:35:30,196 --> 00:35:32,029
I'm all right.

577
00:35:47,295 --> 00:35:50,431
I'm enduring glad
to see you, elly.

578
00:35:51,682 --> 00:35:52,934
Well...

579
00:35:55,436 --> 00:35:57,939
good to see you,
too, billy.

580
00:35:57,974 --> 00:36:00,441
It's been a long spell.

581
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:05,446
I'd appreciate it
if you'd let me come

582
00:36:05,481 --> 00:36:09,200
and sit up with you
some night soon.

583
00:36:09,817 --> 00:36:12,954
Well...

584
00:36:12,989 --> 00:36:15,456
that'd be right fine.

585
00:36:16,707 --> 00:36:19,210
Come anytime you want.

586
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:39,313
? warm was elly glover?

587
00:36:39,348 --> 00:36:43,067
? cold dead was jess-belle?

588
00:36:43,102 --> 00:36:46,821
? and husband
would be billy-ben?

589
00:36:46,856 --> 00:36:51,826
? of the one he loved so well.?

590
00:36:58,699 --> 00:36:59,333
Well, miss ossie.

591
00:36:59,368 --> 00:37:00,585
Billy-ben.

592
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:02,453
Won't you come on in?

593
00:37:02,488 --> 00:37:04,956
Oh, well, i won't stay
but just a minute.

594
00:37:04,991 --> 00:37:07,458
I... i just wanted
to wish you

595
00:37:07,493 --> 00:37:08,709
all the happiness
in the world

596
00:37:09,343 --> 00:37:10,595
on your wedding day.

597
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:13,097
Oh, now, i
appreciate that.

598
00:37:13,132 --> 00:37:15,600
But aren't you coming
to the wedding?

599
00:37:15,635 --> 00:37:18,102
Oh, well, i wouldn't spoil
the day for elly.

600
00:37:18,137 --> 00:37:20,605
She'd see me
and think of jess-belle.

601
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,473
There's no shadow
of jess-belle

602
00:37:22,508 --> 00:37:24,358
between elly and me.

603
00:37:24,393 --> 00:37:26,861
God grant
there never will be.

604
00:37:26,896 --> 00:37:29,363
Uh, i was just
having some coffee.

605
00:37:29,398 --> 00:37:32,483
Won't you sit down?

606
00:37:36,871 --> 00:37:39,373
It's been a
full year now

607
00:37:39,408 --> 00:37:42,493
since jess-belle's
been dead.

608
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:46,247
How do you know
she's dead, billy-ben?

609
00:37:48,749 --> 00:37:51,252
I saw her die.

610
00:37:53,754 --> 00:37:57,508
Now, don't ask me
to tell you any
more than that.

611
00:37:57,543 --> 00:37:58,759
I brought you something

612
00:37:58,794 --> 00:38:00,645
i thought you ought
to have, billy-ben.

613
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:04,398
It used to belong
to jess-belle.

614
00:38:04,433 --> 00:38:05,650
Poor jess.

615
00:38:05,685 --> 00:38:08,152
I appreciate
it, miss ossie.

616
00:38:08,187 --> 00:38:10,655
I brought it
for a special reason.

617
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:11,906
It's made of silver,

618
00:38:11,941 --> 00:38:15,660
and silver is one thing
a witch is scared of.

619
00:38:15,695 --> 00:38:17,528
What witch would
want to harm elly?

620
00:38:17,563 --> 00:38:21,165
I've got a terrible thing
to tell you, billy-ben:

621
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,034
A secret about jess-belle.

622
00:38:23,069 --> 00:38:26,287
I know a secret
about jess-belle myself.

623
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:30,791
The same night
that she disappeared, we talked,

624
00:38:30,826 --> 00:38:35,796
and not meaning to, she...
she mentioned granny hart.

625
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:41,435
And then i found out something
i'd sooner be dead than know.

626
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:44,555
Jess-belle was witched.

627
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:47,308
I didn't know it myself till...

628
00:38:47,343 --> 00:38:48,559
that night she died.

629
00:38:48,594 --> 00:38:51,562
She ain't dead, billy-ben.

630
00:38:53,814 --> 00:38:55,700
But i was there.

631
00:38:55,735 --> 00:38:58,202
I fired one of the shots myself.

632
00:38:58,237 --> 00:39:02,573
I've spent many
a restless night

633
00:39:02,608 --> 00:39:03,824
grieving about that.

634
00:39:03,859 --> 00:39:05,710
Billy-ben...

635
00:39:05,745 --> 00:39:06,961
some months back,

636
00:39:06,996 --> 00:39:11,332
i went into
jess-belle's room...

637
00:39:11,367 --> 00:39:14,468
and there
on jess-belle's pillow

638
00:39:14,503 --> 00:39:16,971
was a wart toad sitting.

639
00:39:17,006 --> 00:39:20,091
Now, l-i grabbed a broom

640
00:39:20,126 --> 00:39:22,593
and i brought that down

641
00:39:23,227 --> 00:39:27,598
with all my might
on that ugly thing...

642
00:39:27,633 --> 00:39:31,352
and it just disappeared
in a cloud of smoke

643
00:39:31,387 --> 00:39:35,740
and went floating out
through the window.

644
00:39:35,775 --> 00:39:38,242
Well, may-maybe it was
just a cloud of dust,

645
00:39:38,859 --> 00:39:41,996
and-and the toad, uh,
fall onto the floor.

646
00:39:42,031 --> 00:39:43,864
No, it was the spirit
of jess-belle.

647
00:39:43,899 --> 00:39:46,867
Miss ossie, now, i saw her die.

648
00:39:46,902 --> 00:39:51,505
Billy-ben, don't you know
you can't kill a witch?!

649
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:54,625
They just change
to something else!

650
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,510
But if a person's good
and strong,

651
00:39:56,545 --> 00:39:59,013
a witch can't harm them,
i've heard.

652
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,515
It's said.

653
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:15,029
Well, then... elly has nothing
to fear from jess-belle.

654
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:22,536
I'm sorry, miss ossie,
but i got to hurry.

655
00:40:22,571 --> 00:40:24,405
I'm going to be late
for my own wedding.

656
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:28,159
I hope and pray there won't be
nobody there who...

657
00:40:28,194 --> 00:40:30,661
who wasn't invited.

658
00:40:30,696 --> 00:40:31,912
To have and
to hold

659
00:40:31,947 --> 00:40:33,798
from this
day forward.

660
00:40:33,833 --> 00:40:36,917
To have and to hold
from this day forward.

661
00:40:36,952 --> 00:40:39,920
For better, for worse;
for richer, for poorer.

662
00:40:39,955 --> 00:40:42,423
For better, for worse...

663
00:40:42,458 --> 00:40:44,925
for richer, for poorer.

664
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,428
In sickness
and in health.

665
00:40:47,463 --> 00:40:48,679
In sickness

666
00:40:48,714 --> 00:40:49,930
and in health.

667
00:40:49,965 --> 00:40:51,816
To love and
to cherish

668
00:40:51,851 --> 00:40:53,684
till death
us do part.

669
00:40:53,719 --> 00:40:56,187
To love

670
00:40:56,222 --> 00:40:58,439
and to cherish
until death

671
00:40:58,474 --> 00:40:59,073
us do part.

672
00:40:59,108 --> 00:41:01,075
According

673
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:02,326
to god's holy
ordinance,

674
00:41:02,361 --> 00:41:04,829
i thereto plight
thee my troth.

675
00:41:04,945 --> 00:41:07,448
According to god's
holy ordinance,

676
00:41:07,483 --> 00:41:10,584
i thereto plight thee my troth.

677
00:41:18,092 --> 00:41:19,960
Join hands.

678
00:41:21,962 --> 00:41:23,848
Those whom god hath joined
together,

679
00:41:23,883 --> 00:41:25,716
let no man put asunder.

680
00:41:25,751 --> 00:41:28,853
I now pronounce you
man and wife.

681
00:41:46,487 --> 00:41:49,623
Aren't you forgetting
something?

682
00:41:49,658 --> 00:41:52,743
Well, not to
my knowing.

683
00:41:52,778 --> 00:41:54,628
Oh, there you go.

684
00:41:54,663 --> 00:41:57,131
You know you're acting
like a husband already?

685
00:41:57,166 --> 00:41:58,999
Are you going
to let your bride walk

686
00:41:59,034 --> 00:42:02,136
across your threshold?

687
00:42:12,146 --> 00:42:14,014
Welcome home, darling.

688
00:42:14,049 --> 00:42:16,517
Thank you, billy-ben.

689
00:42:17,768 --> 00:42:19,653
There's no knowing
how happy i am.

690
00:42:19,688 --> 00:42:20,905
This day has brought me

691
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:25,276
the happiest, happiest
moments of my life.

692
00:42:25,311 --> 00:42:27,161
Billy-ben?

693
00:42:28,412 --> 00:42:30,781
Something has hold of my arm!

694
00:42:30,816 --> 00:42:32,666
I don't see nothing.

695
00:42:32,701 --> 00:42:33,918
Let go!

696
00:42:33,953 --> 00:42:35,786
What's come over you?

697
00:42:35,821 --> 00:42:38,923
I... i never
did that, billy.

698
00:42:38,958 --> 00:42:40,791
Not of my own will.

699
00:42:40,826 --> 00:42:43,294
Something took hold
of me.

700
00:42:43,329 --> 00:42:45,179
Well, i saw nothing.

701
00:42:45,214 --> 00:42:47,681
There's something
here, billy-

702
00:42:47,716 --> 00:42:52,052
something we can't hear
nor see,

703
00:42:52,087 --> 00:42:54,555
but i can feel it.

704
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:57,057
Something... evil.

705
00:42:57,092 --> 00:43:00,194
Something... cold.

706
00:43:07,067 --> 00:43:08,319
Take me home, billy!

707
00:43:08,354 --> 00:43:10,321
Elly, you are home.

708
00:43:10,356 --> 00:43:12,206
But something
don't want me here!

709
00:43:12,241 --> 00:43:14,708
I know what it
is that's trying
to chase you out.

710
00:43:14,743 --> 00:43:16,577
But, elly... elly!

711
00:43:16,612 --> 00:43:19,713
You will stay,
you hear?

712
00:43:19,748 --> 00:43:22,216
You will stay.

713
00:43:31,592 --> 00:43:34,094
Now, i've got to go
away from you

714
00:43:34,129 --> 00:43:35,346
for a little, short time.

715
00:43:35,381 --> 00:43:37,231
Do you trust
in the lord?

716
00:43:37,266 --> 00:43:37,848
Yes.

717
00:43:37,883 --> 00:43:40,234
Well, then hold his word
in your hand...

718
00:43:40,269 --> 00:43:42,736
and his word'll protect you.

719
00:43:42,771 --> 00:43:45,856
But if the devil himself
should come into this room,

720
00:43:45,891 --> 00:43:47,992
do not leave
that chair.

721
00:44:06,126 --> 00:44:08,012
The door's open.

722
00:44:09,263 --> 00:44:11,131
Granny hart?

723
00:44:11,166 --> 00:44:13,634
I'm just curling
my hair

724
00:44:13,669 --> 00:44:15,519
so's i look pretty
for you, billy-ben.

725
00:44:16,136 --> 00:44:19,640
Granny, i... i'm short on time.

726
00:44:19,675 --> 00:44:20,891
Ain't i a beauty?

727
00:44:20,926 --> 00:44:24,028
How'd you like me
for a sweetheart?

728
00:44:24,395 --> 00:44:28,032
I already got a sweetheart,
and i just made her my bride.

729
00:44:28,649 --> 00:44:30,534
Elly glover...

730
00:44:30,569 --> 00:44:32,403
of the golden hair?

731
00:44:32,438 --> 00:44:34,905
She's a beauty, too.

732
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:36,156
Well, i'll not have
her beauty long

733
00:44:36,191 --> 00:44:38,659
unless you help me
rid myself of a witch.

734
00:44:38,694 --> 00:44:41,795
Jess-belle don't like
you being married, do she?

735
00:44:41,830 --> 00:44:43,664
Your jess-belle,
all right.

736
00:44:43,699 --> 00:44:45,549
Oh, i know.

737
00:44:45,584 --> 00:44:49,303
I witched that gal
so she could win your love.

738
00:44:49,338 --> 00:44:51,805
I never wanted
no witch's love.

739
00:44:52,923 --> 00:44:56,677
Humans don't know nothing
about loving.

740
00:44:56,712 --> 00:44:58,429
Well, i know
enough, if...

741
00:44:58,464 --> 00:45:01,565
anything happens
to elly,

742
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:02,816
i couldn't
go on living.

743
00:45:02,851 --> 00:45:04,818
Oh, jess-belle
ain't going to hurt

744
00:45:04,853 --> 00:45:06,070
your little bride.

745
00:45:06,105 --> 00:45:08,572
She's just teasing
and having a good time.

746
00:45:08,607 --> 00:45:10,441
Granny, i left
my wife alone.

747
00:45:10,476 --> 00:45:12,326
Now, i got to
get back to her!

748
00:45:12,943 --> 00:45:14,828
Nothing is holding
you here, boy.

749
00:45:14,863 --> 00:45:17,698
You got to tell me
how to rid myself
of jess-belle.

750
00:45:17,733 --> 00:45:20,584
Well, i don't
hardly know no way...

751
00:45:20,619 --> 00:45:23,087
unless'n you kill her.

752
00:45:23,122 --> 00:45:24,455
You can't kill her.

753
00:45:24,490 --> 00:45:26,957
All she does is go
up in a puff of smoke

754
00:45:26,992 --> 00:45:29,460
and then she comes
right back again!

755
00:45:29,495 --> 00:45:31,345
There's ways.

756
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:32,596
Well, tell me.

757
00:45:32,631 --> 00:45:35,466
How you gonna
to pay me?

758
00:45:35,501 --> 00:45:38,602
Well, what do you want?

759
00:45:38,637 --> 00:45:40,471
A lock of your hair.

760
00:45:41,105 --> 00:45:44,224
You'll not trick
me like that!

761
00:45:49,898 --> 00:45:51,115
It takes lots of money

762
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:54,868
to learn how to kill
a witch.

763
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:02,993
You go home...

764
00:46:03,028 --> 00:46:05,496
make a figure
of jess-belle.

765
00:46:05,531 --> 00:46:10,501
Then put on it clothes
that jess-belle has worn.

766
00:46:10,536 --> 00:46:13,637
Then, if you have
the courage,

767
00:46:13,672 --> 00:46:17,391
stab it through the heart
with silver.

768
00:46:39,913 --> 00:46:42,416
It's got to be
a dress she wore.

769
00:46:42,451 --> 00:46:44,284
She wore it... once.

770
00:46:44,918 --> 00:46:46,787
And billy-ben...

771
00:46:46,822 --> 00:46:49,923
when the time comes,
if your hand fails you,

772
00:46:49,958 --> 00:46:53,043
remember there
was a good part
to jess-belle,

773
00:46:53,078 --> 00:46:55,546
and that part of
her would bless you

774
00:46:55,581 --> 00:46:59,299
for ending what
she's now become.

775
00:47:09,810 --> 00:47:12,696
I told you to stay in the house.
You all right, elly?

776
00:47:14,064 --> 00:47:17,818
That thing you felt in our house
was the spirit of jess-belle.

777
00:47:17,853 --> 00:47:20,320
She was a witch.

778
00:47:20,355 --> 00:47:22,206
But i know
how to get rid of witches.

779
00:47:22,241 --> 00:47:26,577
You'll never be rid
of me, billy-ben.

780
00:47:26,612 --> 00:47:27,828
Jess-belle.

781
00:47:27,863 --> 00:47:31,832
Come on, billy-ben...

782
00:47:31,867 --> 00:47:34,334
dance with me...

783
00:47:34,369 --> 00:47:36,220
in the moonlight.

784
00:48:59,419 --> 00:49:00,671
Elly.

785
00:49:01,922 --> 00:49:03,423
Elly!

786
00:49:03,458 --> 00:49:07,177
May hell swallow me up
if i've killed you, too.

787
00:49:11,565 --> 00:49:14,067
Billy-ben?

788
00:49:15,319 --> 00:49:17,187
You just rest
a minute.

789
00:49:19,072 --> 00:49:21,575
What are we doing here
like this?

790
00:49:21,610 --> 00:49:24,077
Don't you remember?

791
00:49:24,695 --> 00:49:26,580
I remember a wedding.

792
00:49:28,448 --> 00:49:30,334
Did i dream that?

793
00:49:30,369 --> 00:49:31,585
No.

794
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:34,087
You're my pretty
little bride.

795
00:49:35,956 --> 00:49:37,207
Well, then...

796
00:49:37,242 --> 00:49:40,961
i should be cooking you
some supper.

797
00:49:42,212 --> 00:49:43,463
Billy-ben, look!

798
00:49:46,967 --> 00:49:50,470
My mama says when you see
a falling star,

799
00:49:51,104 --> 00:49:54,858
that means a witch
has just died.

800
00:49:55,475 --> 00:49:58,612
So i've heard tell.

801
00:50:01,732 --> 00:50:05,369
? fair was elly glover?

802
00:50:05,404 --> 00:50:09,740
? dark was jess-belle?

803
00:50:09,775 --> 00:50:13,493
? both they loved the same man?

804
00:50:13,528 --> 00:50:19,132
? and both
they loved him well.?

805
00:50:22,135 --> 00:50:23,970
Next ontwilight zone,

806
00:50:24,005 --> 00:50:27,090
a most unusual program
called "miniature."

807
00:50:27,125 --> 00:50:29,476
The very eminent
charles beaumont takes us

808
00:50:29,511 --> 00:50:31,978
into a brand-new realm
of science fiction and fantasy

809
00:50:32,013 --> 00:50:33,847
that is at the same time
intriguing

810
00:50:33,882 --> 00:50:36,349
and strangely believable.

811
00:50:40,737 --> 00:50:43,240
Uh, e-excuse me.

812
00:50:43,275 --> 00:50:43,857
Oh, yes, sir?

813
00:50:43,892 --> 00:50:45,108
I guess this
may sound silly,

814
00:50:45,143 --> 00:50:46,359
but how did they
manage that?

815
00:50:46,394 --> 00:50:48,245
How do they manage what?

816
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:50,113
In there, in
the glass case?

817
00:50:50,148 --> 00:50:53,500
Oh. Well, i couldn't say
exactly.

818
00:50:53,535 --> 00:50:54,751
According
to the museum officials,

819
00:50:54,786 --> 00:50:57,254
the girl.

820
00:50:57,289 --> 00:50:59,122
Have you seen her?

821
00:51:00,006 --> 00:51:01,258
Yes.

822
00:51:01,293 --> 00:51:03,009
W-well, is-is she all right?

823
00:51:03,044 --> 00:51:04,878
L-l-i've been worried sick.

824
00:51:10,016 --> 00:51:13,136
Be careful.
