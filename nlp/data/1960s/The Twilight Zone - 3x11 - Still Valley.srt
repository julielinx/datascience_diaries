1
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:12,262
You're traveling
through another dimension-

2
00:00:12,297 --> 00:00:16,016
a dimension not only of sight
and sound, but of mind,

3
00:00:16,051 --> 00:00:17,884
a journey into a wondrous land

4
00:00:17,919 --> 00:00:20,387
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

5
00:00:20,422 --> 00:00:22,272
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

6
00:00:26,643 --> 00:00:30,397
The time is 1863,
the place the state of virginia.

7
00:00:30,432 --> 00:00:33,533
The event is a bloodletting
known as the civil war

8
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,151
a tragic moment in time

9
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:38,905
when a nation was split
into two fragments,

10
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,042
each fragment
deeming itself a nation.

11
00:00:42,077 --> 00:00:43,910
What is it?

12
00:00:43,945 --> 00:00:45,662
I thought
i heard something.

13
00:00:45,697 --> 00:00:46,913
Yanks?

14
00:00:46,948 --> 00:00:50,050
I don't hear 'em no more.

15
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,312
Dauger, you figure
this would fire

16
00:01:02,347 --> 00:01:04,814
if you was to press
the trigger?

17
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:06,066
I reckon.

18
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:09,819
What's the idea,
paradine?

19
00:01:09,854 --> 00:01:11,071
The idea is, dauger,

20
00:01:11,106 --> 00:01:13,573
you ain't a right arm to me
or a left arm.

21
00:01:13,608 --> 00:01:15,442
You're just
some extra baggage

22
00:01:15,477 --> 00:01:18,578
that breathes hard
and splits my rations.

23
00:01:18,613 --> 00:01:21,698
You figure you'll shape up
by the end of the war?

24
00:01:21,733 --> 00:01:24,834
I can't help it!

25
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:26,703
It used to...

26
00:01:26,738 --> 00:01:30,457
it used to be i never
give it any thought.

27
00:01:30,492 --> 00:01:31,708
It used to be like

28
00:01:31,743 --> 00:01:35,462
it was some kind of game
we was playing like kids.

29
00:01:35,497 --> 00:01:37,347
King of
the mountain.

30
00:01:37,382 --> 00:01:39,215
Hide and go seek.

31
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:43,219
Blind man's bluff.

32
00:01:43,254 --> 00:01:45,722
But it ain't that way
anymore, paradine.

33
00:01:45,757 --> 00:01:48,224
I seen too much
of this business.

34
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:50,110
I was at the second manassas.

35
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:00,120
You haven't got

36
00:02:00,155 --> 00:02:02,622
a nerve in your body,
have you?

37
00:02:02,657 --> 00:02:05,125
Just as many as you, son.

38
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,376
From head to boot.

39
00:02:06,411 --> 00:02:10,130
Only i don't concern myself
as much as you.

40
00:02:10,165 --> 00:02:11,998
You're worrying about dead men

41
00:02:12,033 --> 00:02:13,883
and lost battles.

42
00:02:13,918 --> 00:02:17,003
That's just too much area
to fret in.

43
00:02:17,038 --> 00:02:20,140
I'm worrying about two scouts
on a mission,

44
00:02:20,175 --> 00:02:23,259
and a dirty piece
of brown paper.

45
00:02:23,294 --> 00:02:25,762
It says the yanks are going
to take up a position

46
00:02:25,797 --> 00:02:27,013
in the chano valley.

47
00:02:27,048 --> 00:02:29,516
We got to scout them
and report back

48
00:02:29,551 --> 00:02:31,401
as soon as they get
into that town

49
00:02:31,436 --> 00:02:33,269
down there below.

50
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:49,285
Yanks?

51
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,171
Yanks, probably.

52
00:02:51,206 --> 00:02:53,673
Horses, positive.

53
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:55,425
How many?

54
00:02:56,711 --> 00:02:58,545
It's a patrol,
i figure.

55
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,796
20, 30 men.

56
00:03:02,967 --> 00:03:04,801
That's funny.

57
00:03:04,836 --> 00:03:06,052
What is?

58
00:03:06,087 --> 00:03:07,303
Well, i know
i heard horses,

59
00:03:07,338 --> 00:03:09,189
and it's coming
from down there.

60
00:03:09,806 --> 00:03:10,440
They're yanks.

61
00:03:10,475 --> 00:03:12,308
Ain't no question
about that.

62
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,947
Listen, joe,
we're exposing ourselves here.

63
00:03:17,982 --> 00:03:20,450
This is no place
to stand out in the open.

64
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:24,204
If they are yanks,

65
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,323
they'd be in that town
down there by now.

66
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:31,711
Be as noisy as
a county fair.

67
00:03:31,746 --> 00:03:35,465
There ain't a
sound anymore.

68
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,333
Reckon i better
get down there

69
00:03:37,368 --> 00:03:39,219
and take a close look.

70
00:03:39,254 --> 00:03:41,721
Listen, joe...
let's pull out.

71
00:03:41,756 --> 00:03:43,590
I don't like it.

72
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:44,591
You heard 'em.

73
00:03:44,626 --> 00:03:47,093
We found out
what we had to find out-

74
00:03:47,128 --> 00:03:48,978
the yankees are
in the valley.

75
00:03:49,013 --> 00:03:50,230
So we go back
and report.

76
00:03:50,847 --> 00:03:52,732
What's the point
in going down there?

77
00:03:52,767 --> 00:03:54,601
The point is we got
to count their heads,

78
00:03:54,636 --> 00:03:55,852
their horses
and their guns.

79
00:03:55,887 --> 00:03:57,737
We got to get a look at
their regimental number.

80
00:03:58,354 --> 00:03:59,606
That enough point
for you, mr. Dauger?

81
00:03:59,641 --> 00:04:00,857
I don't care.

82
00:04:00,892 --> 00:04:02,742
I just don't care
anymore.

83
00:04:02,777 --> 00:04:04,611
I only got
one big mission left

84
00:04:04,646 --> 00:04:05,862
and that's to stay alive.

85
00:04:05,897 --> 00:04:08,364
All right, i say
we go down in that valley.

86
00:04:08,399 --> 00:04:11,501
And we wave a shirt
and throw down our carbines.

87
00:04:13,369 --> 00:04:15,371
Mr. Dauger, i
extend my sympathy

88
00:04:15,406 --> 00:04:19,125
so long as your yellow
eats at your insides.

89
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,127
But when it crawls
into my bivouac

90
00:04:21,162 --> 00:04:23,012
and tries to climb
up on my horse,

91
00:04:23,047 --> 00:04:24,264
i withdraw my sympathy

92
00:04:24,299 --> 00:04:26,132
and give you the
back of my hand.

93
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:34,274
So far, you and me pledge
nothing to the confederacy

94
00:04:34,309 --> 00:04:36,776
except a lack of sleep
and empty bellies.

95
00:04:36,811 --> 00:04:39,896
But there's a couple
of hundred thousand others

96
00:04:39,931 --> 00:04:40,780
pledged
a lot more.

97
00:04:40,815 --> 00:04:42,031
You're making
it appear

98
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:43,900
like they did it
for nothing.

99
00:04:43,935 --> 00:04:46,402
Now you stay here.

100
00:04:46,437 --> 00:04:47,654
If you hear a shot,

101
00:04:47,689 --> 00:04:51,407
you get back to the lieutenant
at a fast gallop

102
00:04:51,442 --> 00:04:54,544
'cause that will mean
they're down there in force.

103
00:04:54,579 --> 00:04:56,412
And you tell him what happened.

104
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:58,915
If you haven't heard from me
in 15 minutes,

105
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,416
you get back
there anyway.

106
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,919
Listen, you going
down there alone?

107
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:05,305
Just me and this brave horse.

108
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,556
For want of anything else.

109
00:05:08,424 --> 00:05:11,427
This is joseph paradine,

110
00:05:11,462 --> 00:05:12,679
confederate cavalry,

111
00:05:12,714 --> 00:05:14,564
as he heads down
toward a small town

112
00:05:14,599 --> 00:05:15,815
in the middle of a valley.

113
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:17,066
But very shortly,

114
00:05:17,101 --> 00:05:20,186
joseph paradine will
make contact with the enemy.

115
00:05:20,221 --> 00:05:22,689
He will also make contact
with an outpost

116
00:05:22,724 --> 00:05:25,191
not found on a military map-

117
00:05:25,226 --> 00:05:28,328
an outpost called
the twilight zone.

118
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,911
Hey!

119
00:07:41,946 --> 00:07:43,796
Hey, yank!

120
00:07:43,831 --> 00:07:45,047
Sleeping.

121
00:07:45,082 --> 00:07:50,052
Must be sleeping
or are you dead?

122
00:07:50,087 --> 00:07:53,172
Are you dead?!

123
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:57,310
Plague maybe.

124
00:07:57,345 --> 00:07:59,178
Some kind of sickness.

125
00:07:59,213 --> 00:08:01,063
But that would take hours.

126
00:08:01,098 --> 00:08:03,566
You wouldn't all be like this.

127
00:08:03,601 --> 00:08:05,434
Not all at the same time.

128
00:08:05,469 --> 00:08:07,937
Must be asleep.

129
00:08:07,972 --> 00:08:10,439
No wounds.

130
00:08:10,474 --> 00:08:12,325
Not a sign of blood.

131
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:14,827
Wake up.

132
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:17,947
Wake up.

133
00:08:17,982 --> 00:08:19,832
Go on.

134
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:22,335
Wake up, go ahead.

135
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:23,586
You aren't dead.

136
00:08:23,621 --> 00:08:26,088
None of you are dead.

137
00:08:26,123 --> 00:08:27,957
Wake up, yanks!

138
00:08:27,992 --> 00:08:31,093
None of you are dead!

139
00:08:31,128 --> 00:08:34,096
All right, yanks,
you're all my prisoners!

140
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:35,965
Come on, yanks!

141
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,101
You're all my prisoners!

142
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:48,361
Well, you come
to the right place.

143
00:08:48,396 --> 00:08:51,480
You sure come
to the right place, boys.

144
00:08:51,515 --> 00:08:57,119
Food, clothing.

145
00:08:57,154 --> 00:08:58,371
Ammunition.

146
00:08:58,406 --> 00:09:00,873
What you got
is what we need.

147
00:09:00,908 --> 00:09:03,242
You hear me, yank?

148
00:09:03,277 --> 00:09:04,377
You come
to the right valley.

149
00:09:04,412 --> 00:09:06,879
Nothing around here
but hungry confederates.

150
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:24,013
I don't understand.

151
00:09:24,048 --> 00:09:27,149
I just don't understand.

152
00:09:27,184 --> 00:09:29,652
What's happened to you?

153
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:31,520
Why are you...

154
00:09:31,555 --> 00:09:34,023
why are you all quiet like this?

155
00:09:34,058 --> 00:09:37,159
None of you can speak?

156
00:09:37,194 --> 00:09:40,279
None of you can move.

157
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:04,303
First meat i've had
in a couple of months, you hear?

158
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,581
Wind... must be the wind.

159
00:10:32,616 --> 00:10:36,335
It has to be the wind.

160
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:03,529
All right, in there,
you'd best come out now.

161
00:11:03,564 --> 00:11:05,414
You hear?

162
00:11:05,449 --> 00:11:09,168
You'd better come out now
or i'm coming in.

163
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:28,688
Oh, well, old man.

164
00:11:28,723 --> 00:11:32,441
You don't know how close
you come to dying just then.

165
00:11:32,476 --> 00:11:34,310
Now, you'd better tell me

166
00:11:34,345 --> 00:11:37,446
just who you are
and what you're doing here.

167
00:11:37,481 --> 00:11:39,315
I was just about

168
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:42,451
to ask you for the
same information, son.

169
00:11:42,486 --> 00:11:43,703
When i first seen you

170
00:11:43,738 --> 00:11:44,820
coming up the street,

171
00:11:44,855 --> 00:11:46,706
i thought you
was a yank.

172
00:11:46,741 --> 00:11:49,825
You don't know how close
youcome to dying.

173
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:54,213
What was you going to use,
grandpa, that book?

174
00:11:54,248 --> 00:11:57,333
That's a pretty heavy thing
to be throwing.

175
00:11:57,368 --> 00:11:59,218
This book,

176
00:11:59,253 --> 00:12:01,721
but i wasn't aiming
to throw it...

177
00:12:01,756 --> 00:12:02,972
just use it...

178
00:12:03,007 --> 00:12:06,726
like i used it on them.

179
00:12:06,761 --> 00:12:09,228
I done that, you know.

180
00:12:09,263 --> 00:12:11,847
Put them all to sleep.

181
00:12:11,882 --> 00:12:16,235
You don't believe
me, do you?

182
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,486
You think i'm lying.

183
00:12:17,521 --> 00:12:19,989
I ain't
called you no liar.

184
00:12:20,024 --> 00:12:21,857
Something happened
to 'em,

185
00:12:21,892 --> 00:12:24,360
but there must be
some natural explanation.

186
00:12:24,395 --> 00:12:25,611
They just couldn't...

187
00:12:28,783 --> 00:12:31,250
"natural explanation."

188
00:12:31,867 --> 00:12:33,119
Now, don't that take all.

189
00:12:33,154 --> 00:12:37,256
This here's
what done it.

190
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:39,759
This here book.

191
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:48,634
That wasn't
bright of you.

192
00:12:48,669 --> 00:12:51,137
That wasn't
bright of you at all.

193
00:12:51,172 --> 00:12:53,022
Listen, old man.

194
00:12:53,057 --> 00:12:54,890
You may be
harmless enough,

195
00:12:54,925 --> 00:12:57,026
but i got no time
to fiddle around

196
00:12:57,061 --> 00:12:58,277
with black magic

197
00:12:58,312 --> 00:13:00,146
or any other
old men's games.

198
00:13:00,181 --> 00:13:01,397
Games?

199
00:13:01,432 --> 00:13:03,282
Games, you call it?

200
00:13:03,317 --> 00:13:07,036
When there in front of you
stands the enemy?

201
00:13:07,071 --> 00:13:08,904
Not even a twitch?

202
00:13:08,939 --> 00:13:12,041
Not even a move
in the eyeball?

203
00:13:12,076 --> 00:13:13,909
Well!

204
00:13:17,081 --> 00:13:19,548
"Ye soldier, conjured here

205
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:22,668
"in the name
of the prince of darkness,

206
00:13:22,703 --> 00:13:25,171
ye shall remain
silent and..."

207
00:13:25,206 --> 00:13:27,056
now, listen, old man...!

208
00:13:27,091 --> 00:13:30,810
How 'bout it now, johnny reb?

209
00:13:30,845 --> 00:13:31,427
You believe me?

210
00:13:31,462 --> 00:13:33,312
I reckon you
believe me now

211
00:13:33,347 --> 00:13:35,815
being as you can't
move a muscle.

212
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:36,932
Being as you

213
00:13:36,967 --> 00:13:39,435
can't speak even
a word out loud

214
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:43,189
you're just going to have to
stand there and listen to...

215
00:13:43,224 --> 00:13:45,074
listen to me speak at you.

216
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:48,194
Oh, i know you
can still hear me

217
00:13:48,229 --> 00:13:51,330
'cause i only used
half the power.

218
00:13:51,365 --> 00:13:53,833
My name's teague.

219
00:13:53,868 --> 00:13:56,952
I lived down yon by the creek.

220
00:13:58,239 --> 00:14:01,957
I'm a witchman,
like my pappy 'fore me.

221
00:14:01,992 --> 00:14:05,711
He was the seventh son
of a seventh son,

222
00:14:05,746 --> 00:14:08,214
and i was his seventh son.

223
00:14:08,249 --> 00:14:11,967
I know conjure stuff
forward and backward

224
00:14:12,002 --> 00:14:13,469
and up and down.

225
00:14:13,504 --> 00:14:14,720
It's my living.

226
00:14:14,755 --> 00:14:18,974
And then the yanks come

227
00:14:19,009 --> 00:14:23,979
and all the people
run afore 'em... 'cept me.

228
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,984
Invaders!

229
00:14:29,019 --> 00:14:30,870
Tyrants!

230
00:14:30,905 --> 00:14:35,241
Thieving skunks to boot!

231
00:14:35,276 --> 00:14:37,126
But i fixed them.

232
00:14:37,161 --> 00:14:39,628
I didn't do no la-dl-da.

233
00:14:39,663 --> 00:14:42,131
I opened the book,
and i read the words,

234
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:47,136
and you can see
what happened to them.

235
00:14:47,171 --> 00:14:50,890
Now... now, you listen
to me, johnny reb.

236
00:14:50,925 --> 00:14:54,009
Your... your secession-

237
00:14:54,044 --> 00:14:56,512
you fight the yanks.

238
00:14:56,547 --> 00:15:00,266
Now, you be good and
don't give me no argument-

239
00:15:00,301 --> 00:15:02,151
blink your right eye.

240
00:15:03,938 --> 00:15:07,022
Now you'll be able
to move again

241
00:15:07,057 --> 00:15:09,775
as soon as i
read the words.

242
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:12,278
"Ye soldier,
conjured here

243
00:15:12,313 --> 00:15:14,780
"in the name of the
prince of darkness,

244
00:15:14,815 --> 00:15:17,917
ye can now move and speak."

245
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:25,541
Hypnotism.

246
00:15:25,576 --> 00:15:26,792
Hypnotism?

247
00:15:26,827 --> 00:15:28,043
Hypnotism?!

248
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,797
This is conjure stuff.

249
00:15:39,054 --> 00:15:41,557
And what i done
to them yanks,

250
00:15:41,592 --> 00:15:44,059
i can do to the
whole union army-

251
00:15:44,094 --> 00:15:45,945
freeze 'em all
in their tracks.

252
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:48,447
I can open up a
path to washington

253
00:15:48,482 --> 00:15:51,567
so that bobby lee
could ride in there

254
00:15:51,602 --> 00:15:54,703
with three confederate
troopers and take over

255
00:15:54,738 --> 00:15:55,955
the whole country.

256
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:57,823
Magic.

257
00:15:57,858 --> 00:16:00,326
You claim it's magic.

258
00:16:00,361 --> 00:16:02,211
I don't claim it.

259
00:16:02,246 --> 00:16:03,462
I say it.

260
00:16:03,497 --> 00:16:07,216
Itismagic.

261
00:16:07,251 --> 00:16:11,587
It's what i read in the book

262
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:15,975
and now... you seen it.

263
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:18,477
You felt it.

264
00:16:18,512 --> 00:16:22,231
You mean you could...
you could do this

265
00:16:22,266 --> 00:16:24,483
to the whole
union army?

266
00:16:24,518 --> 00:16:29,738
Could and would.

267
00:16:29,773 --> 00:16:31,607
Why don't you, old man?

268
00:16:31,642 --> 00:16:33,492
Why don't you?

269
00:16:33,527 --> 00:16:38,497
For one good reason,
one good reason only.

270
00:16:38,532 --> 00:16:42,251
I'm goin' to die.

271
00:16:42,286 --> 00:16:48,507
Mm. I'm goin' to die
afore the sun goes down.

272
00:16:48,542 --> 00:16:51,010
I got a feelin' in my bones.

273
00:16:51,045 --> 00:16:54,129
I can smell death,
and hear it comin'

274
00:16:54,164 --> 00:16:57,883
on a white horse
galloping straight at me,

275
00:16:57,918 --> 00:17:00,386
galloping, galloping
straight at me.

276
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:01,770
Old mr. Death

277
00:17:01,805 --> 00:17:04,273
come to pluck me
out of the livin'.

278
00:17:04,308 --> 00:17:06,141
So i ain't goin'
to be around

279
00:17:06,176 --> 00:17:08,277
to do what's got to be done.

280
00:17:08,312 --> 00:17:10,779
I'm leaving it
up to you.

281
00:17:10,814 --> 00:17:12,031
Me?

282
00:17:12,066 --> 00:17:17,903
I can tell about a man's looks,
his eyes, his head,

283
00:17:17,938 --> 00:17:19,154
hold on his weapon.

284
00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:22,291
I can tell all about that man...

285
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:26,161
and i'm choosing you.

286
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:35,304
You can find everything
you need in this book-

287
00:17:35,339 --> 00:17:42,177
spells, talisman,
curses, everything.

288
00:17:47,182 --> 00:17:48,434
Here.

289
00:17:48,469 --> 00:17:50,936
Take it.

290
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:54,690
Don't seem right.

291
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,943
Don't seem right at all.

292
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,446
There's something...

293
00:18:00,481 --> 00:18:01,697
something unclean,

294
00:18:01,732 --> 00:18:06,085
like being in league with the...

295
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,336
that's it.

296
00:18:07,371 --> 00:18:09,838
You got it right, johnny reb.

297
00:18:09,873 --> 00:18:13,592
You said it like it's got
the devil.

298
00:18:13,627 --> 00:18:17,713
That's who you're
in league with,

299
00:18:17,748 --> 00:18:20,849
the devil himself.

300
00:18:20,884 --> 00:18:27,723
That's who we'll have fighting
the devil.

301
00:18:27,758 --> 00:18:30,225
The devil.

302
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,230
The devil.

303
00:18:36,231 --> 00:18:39,368
The devil.

304
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,624
Halt. Who goes there?

305
00:18:45,659 --> 00:18:46,875
Paradine,
troop scout.

306
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:49,995
Advance and be recognized.

307
00:18:56,251 --> 00:19:00,005
You've been gone a
long time, paradine.

308
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,256
We give you up,

309
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:04,393
dead or prisoner
by this time.

310
00:19:04,428 --> 00:19:05,644
Neither, lieutenant.

311
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:10,015
Not time for either
of it, it appears.

312
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:13,769
Well, a man's got to do
his reading, don't he.

313
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,021
Well, out with it, man.

314
00:19:16,056 --> 00:19:17,272
What'd you see?

315
00:19:17,307 --> 00:19:19,158
More'n you'd believe,
lieutenant.

316
00:19:19,193 --> 00:19:21,026
Where was their advance party?

317
00:19:21,061 --> 00:19:23,529
We haven't heard a sound
from that valley all day.

318
00:19:23,564 --> 00:19:26,031
Their advance party's
in that town,

319
00:19:26,066 --> 00:19:28,534
and the main body's
spread out behind.

320
00:19:28,569 --> 00:19:30,419
Are you drunk or something?

321
00:19:30,454 --> 00:19:32,921
Now, there hasn't been a sound
from down there all day,

322
00:19:32,956 --> 00:19:35,424
not a sound.

323
00:19:35,459 --> 00:19:38,544
Lieutenant, you got
every right to call me mad,

324
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:41,680
but the reason
you didn't hear 'em is...

325
00:19:41,715 --> 00:19:42,931
is they're all asleep.

326
00:19:42,966 --> 00:19:47,186
Put to sleep by magic-
black magic.

327
00:19:47,221 --> 00:19:49,054
It's right here
in this book.

328
00:19:49,089 --> 00:19:52,808
A little old man by the name
of teague- he done it.

329
00:19:52,843 --> 00:19:54,693
Paradine, the
order's out.

330
00:19:54,728 --> 00:19:57,196
You're to take
yourself to bed.

331
00:19:57,813 --> 00:19:59,064
You're to sleep
the night.

332
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:01,567
Make your report to
me in the morning.

333
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,569
This is my report, lieutenant.

334
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,956
Where's mallory's troop?

335
00:20:07,991 --> 00:20:10,459
They went up the north ridge
late this morning.

336
00:20:10,494 --> 00:20:12,961
Yeah, there's a group of yankees
camped up there, wasn't there?

337
00:20:12,996 --> 00:20:14,830
Company strength at least,
wasn't there?

338
00:20:14,865 --> 00:20:16,081
That's what we figured?

339
00:20:16,116 --> 00:20:17,966
But what's that got to do
with all this?

340
00:20:18,001 --> 00:20:20,469
On the way back here,
lieutenant, i...

341
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:22,971
i... i opened the book,

342
00:20:23,006 --> 00:20:24,840
and i read from a page of it.

343
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:26,725
Halt. Who goes there?

344
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:31,096
I conjured up a spell, and i...

345
00:20:31,131 --> 00:20:33,599
and i turned it in the direction
of that ridge.

346
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:40,489
Mallory, paradine says...

347
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:47,362
l-i just seen something
l-i can't explain

348
00:20:47,397 --> 00:20:51,116
no more'n any of my men
can explain it,

349
00:20:51,151 --> 00:20:53,001
but they seen it too.

350
00:20:53,036 --> 00:20:56,622
We was walking up that ridge
in the scrimmage line

351
00:20:56,657 --> 00:20:59,758
scared out of our boots,
'cause it was so quiet.

352
00:20:59,793 --> 00:21:01,627
We thought them yankees

353
00:21:01,662 --> 00:21:04,763
was waiting for us
just beyond the parapet.

354
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:07,883
Yeah, they was waiting,
all right-

355
00:21:07,918 --> 00:21:12,271
standing straight and tall,
guns to port,

356
00:21:12,306 --> 00:21:13,889
frozen like statues.

357
00:21:13,924 --> 00:21:15,140
Dead?

358
00:21:15,175 --> 00:21:17,025
Not dead.

359
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:20,779
Not dead
and not alive.

360
00:21:20,814 --> 00:21:26,151
Just frozen stock-still
like rocks.

361
00:21:26,186 --> 00:21:29,905
Lieutenant, this done it.

362
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,407
Paradine, this is
the devil's work.

363
00:21:32,442 --> 00:21:34,910
Well, what's this
all about?

364
00:21:34,945 --> 00:21:38,046
This book- an old man
give it to me in town.

365
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:40,048
It is the devil's work.

366
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:41,300
I know that.

367
00:21:41,335 --> 00:21:45,053
But maybe it's time
we called muster on the devil.

368
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:48,173
Maybe it's the only
thing left for us.

369
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:50,058
We ain't got enough guns.

370
00:21:50,093 --> 00:21:51,927
We ain't got enough food.

371
00:21:51,962 --> 00:21:53,812
We ain't got enough of anything.

372
00:21:53,847 --> 00:21:55,681
We're losing, lieutenant.

373
00:21:55,716 --> 00:21:58,183
The confederacy's
cracking up into little pieces

374
00:21:58,218 --> 00:21:59,434
right in front of our eyes.

375
00:21:59,469 --> 00:22:01,937
It's bleeding to death
every day.

376
00:22:01,972 --> 00:22:05,691
We ain't got enough blood left
to make a change.

377
00:22:05,726 --> 00:22:08,193
I don't know much about satan,

378
00:22:08,228 --> 00:22:15,083
but this cause of ours is...
is dying right in front of us.

379
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:22,841
Paradine, open up the book
and read from it out loud.

380
00:22:22,876 --> 00:22:27,212
Make it good for every
union soldier in the field.

381
00:22:27,247 --> 00:22:29,715
Freeze 'em. Put 'em
into the earth or something,

382
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:32,851
but make it good.

383
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:42,227
"Satan... satan,
i call upon you,

384
00:22:42,262 --> 00:22:44,112
"and in so doing

385
00:22:44,147 --> 00:22:46,615
i revoke the name of..."

386
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:54,122
go on, joe, read it.

387
00:22:54,157 --> 00:22:58,493
He calls upon us to
revoke the name of god.

388
00:23:01,997 --> 00:23:05,133
Leave it be, dauger.

389
00:23:05,168 --> 00:23:06,385
You said yourself

390
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,636
it's the only thing
we got left.

391
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:10,138
He's right, paradine.

392
00:23:10,173 --> 00:23:13,258
God help us,
thatisall we have left.

393
00:23:13,293 --> 00:23:14,760
What do we call 'em?

394
00:23:14,795 --> 00:23:17,262
Damn yankees,
don't we, lieutenant?

395
00:23:17,297 --> 00:23:21,016
That's the phrase,
ain't it- "damn yanks"?

396
00:23:21,051 --> 00:23:23,518
If i read aloud
from this book,

397
00:23:23,553 --> 00:23:26,655
it'll be the confederacy
that's damned.

398
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:28,523
It's that book
or it's the end.

399
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:30,409
Then let it be the end!

400
00:23:30,444 --> 00:23:33,528
If it must come,
let it come.

401
00:23:33,563 --> 00:23:36,665
If this cause is to be buried

402
00:23:37,282 --> 00:23:41,036
let it be put
in hallowed ground.

403
00:23:43,538 --> 00:23:47,292
Let it be put
in hallowed ground.

404
00:23:47,327 --> 00:23:50,295
On the following morning,
sergeant paradine

405
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:53,048
and the rest of these men
were moved up north

406
00:23:53,083 --> 00:23:55,550
to a little town
in pennsylvania,

407
00:23:55,585 --> 00:23:57,436
an obscure little place

408
00:23:57,471 --> 00:24:00,188
where a battle was brewing,
a town called gettysburg,

409
00:24:00,223 --> 00:24:01,440
and this one was fought

410
00:24:01,475 --> 00:24:03,942
without the help of the devil-
small historical note

411
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:05,811
not to be found
in any known books

412
00:24:05,846 --> 00:24:11,450
but part of the records
in the twilight zone.

413
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:17,239
Rod serling,
creator ofthe twilight zone,

414
00:24:17,274 --> 00:24:19,124
will tell you
about next week's story

415
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:22,844
after this message.

416
00:24:22,879 --> 00:24:24,846
And now, mr. Serling.

417
00:24:24,881 --> 00:24:25,664
Next week onthe twilight zone

418
00:24:25,699 --> 00:24:28,800
we once again borrow the talents
of mr. Charles beaumont

419
00:24:28,835 --> 00:24:30,669
who's written a script
especially for us

420
00:24:30,704 --> 00:24:31,920
called "the jungle."

421
00:24:31,955 --> 00:24:33,171
Now this is designed

422
00:24:33,206 --> 00:24:35,056
for the reasonably
impressionable amongst you

423
00:24:35,091 --> 00:24:36,308
who find nothing to laugh about

424
00:24:36,343 --> 00:24:38,810
when somebody mentions
the words "black magic."

425
00:24:38,845 --> 00:24:41,930
Mr. John dehner stars
in another small excursion

426
00:24:41,965 --> 00:24:44,432
into the darker regions
of the imagination.

427
00:24:44,467 --> 00:24:46,935
Next week, "the jungle."

428
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:19,134
This is james arness.

429
00:25:19,169 --> 00:25:21,019
You know, it's only a short hop

430
00:25:21,054 --> 00:25:23,522
fromthe twilight zone
to dodge city ingunsmoke.

431
00:25:23,557 --> 00:25:26,024
Saturday nights
over most of these stations.
