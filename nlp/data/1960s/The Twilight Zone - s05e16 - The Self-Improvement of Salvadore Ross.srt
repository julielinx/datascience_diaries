00:00:07,974 --> 00:00:11,227
You unlock this door
with the key of imagination.

2
00:00:11,262 --> 00:00:13,229
Beyond it is another dimension-

3
00:00:13,264 --> 00:00:14,230
a dimension of sound,

4
00:00:15,266 --> 00:00:17,734
a dimension of sight,

5
00:00:17,769 --> 00:00:19,486
a dimension of mind.

6
00:00:19,521 --> 00:00:22,989
You're moving into a land
of both shadow and substance,

7
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:24,741
of things and ideas.

8
00:00:24,776 --> 00:00:27,994
You've just crossed over
into the twilight zone.

9
00:00:38,254 --> 00:00:39,255
Hey!

10
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:41,257
You with the
rich boyfriend.

11
00:00:41,292 --> 00:00:44,511
Well, come on, just
because i'm successful,

12
00:00:44,546 --> 00:00:46,763
that don't make me stuck-up.

13
00:00:48,049 --> 00:00:49,265
? la-la.?

14
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:50,767
Hello, sal.

15
00:00:50,802 --> 00:00:52,268
Whose is it?

16
00:00:52,303 --> 00:00:54,270
Oh, it couldn't
be mine, huh?

17
00:00:54,305 --> 00:00:55,772
Come on, whose is it?

18
00:00:55,807 --> 00:00:57,774
It belongs to
this guy halpert.

19
00:00:58,024 --> 00:00:59,526
He's about 170 years old

20
00:00:59,776 --> 00:01:01,778
and owns half
of connecticut.

21
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:04,781
How do you know him?

22
00:01:05,031 --> 00:01:06,783
I got a new job
washing cars

23
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:08,785
in the building
where he lives.

24
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:11,788
I see this little beauty
waiting for action.

25
00:01:11,823 --> 00:01:14,791
Battery might run down,
something like that.

26
00:01:14,826 --> 00:01:18,044
You mean he doesn't know
you have his car?

27
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:20,046
He doesn't care,
he digs me.

28
00:01:20,081 --> 00:01:22,549
See, i've done him
some small favors.

29
00:01:22,584 --> 00:01:24,801
And... well,
come on, let's go!

30
00:01:24,836 --> 00:01:26,052
No, thanks very much.

31
00:01:26,087 --> 00:01:27,804
No, wait, i ain't lying.

32
00:01:27,839 --> 00:01:30,306
Only time he leaves
is to dig chicks

33
00:01:30,341 --> 00:01:31,808
and try and find out

34
00:01:31,843 --> 00:01:33,810
how it was
when he was young.

35
00:01:33,845 --> 00:01:35,562
Well, i'm sorry,
i'm tired

36
00:01:35,597 --> 00:01:36,813
and i told my father

37
00:01:37,063 --> 00:01:39,065
i'd play chess
with him tonight.

38
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,817
Chess? Wait a minute.

39
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:43,319
Okay.

40
00:01:43,354 --> 00:01:44,704
Okay, i...

41
00:01:44,739 --> 00:01:46,956
watch how i can make nice.

42
00:01:46,991 --> 00:01:48,208
Oh, gee, i'm sorry.

43
00:01:48,243 --> 00:01:50,460
Well, i'll borrow
the wheels again

44
00:01:50,495 --> 00:01:52,962
next friday, and
be by to pick you up.

45
00:01:52,997 --> 00:01:54,964
Now, wasn't that
polite?

46
00:01:54,999 --> 00:01:55,965
Yes.

47
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,467
Very polite.

48
00:01:58,468 --> 00:02:01,221
I meant what i said
the last time, sal.

49
00:02:01,256 --> 00:02:02,972
No, you didn't.

50
00:02:03,007 --> 00:02:03,973
Yes, i did.

51
00:02:04,008 --> 00:02:05,975
We can't keep
seeing each other.

52
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:07,477
I should never
have let it

53
00:02:07,512 --> 00:02:08,978
get started
in the first place.

54
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:12,232
Sure, as long as you're
the saintly social worker

55
00:02:12,267 --> 00:02:14,984
and i'm one of the crumbs,
everything's all right.

56
00:02:15,019 --> 00:02:16,986
But as soon as
we get too close,

57
00:02:17,021 --> 00:02:18,988
you notice i got
dirt on my hands.

58
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:20,240
That has nothing...

59
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:22,492
and i don't talk
like your old man.

60
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:25,612
Sal, we're just
two people

61
00:02:25,647 --> 00:02:27,864
who are never going
to understand each other.

62
00:02:27,899 --> 00:02:30,116
Baby...

63
00:02:30,151 --> 00:02:32,368
with your education,
you can think up

64
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:34,621
a better "dear john"
than that.

65
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:38,007
I'm sorry.

66
00:02:39,008 --> 00:02:40,260
Listen.

67
00:02:40,295 --> 00:02:43,012
I won't always have
dirt on my hands.

68
00:02:43,047 --> 00:02:46,015
I don't need no books
to show me the way up.

69
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:48,268
I got the map,
i'll get there.

70
00:02:48,303 --> 00:02:50,019
Leah, is something the matter?

71
00:02:59,395 --> 00:03:01,397
No.

72
00:03:01,432 --> 00:03:03,399
No, dad, there's
nothing wrong.

73
00:03:03,434 --> 00:03:05,902
No, there's
nothing wrong, dad.

74
00:03:06,903 --> 00:03:08,404
Hello, sal.

75
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:10,907
Are you happy that
you've convinced her

76
00:03:10,942 --> 00:03:14,410
she's too much for a bum
like salvadore ross, hmm?

77
00:03:14,445 --> 00:03:17,297
I admit i wouldn't choose you
for my daughter.

78
00:03:17,332 --> 00:03:19,799
But it's not my decision-
it's hers.

79
00:03:19,834 --> 00:03:22,051
Besides, i may be
wrong about you.

80
00:03:22,086 --> 00:03:24,804
She obviously sees you
differently than i do.

81
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:28,308
No, i don't.

82
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:31,060
Not anymore.

83
00:03:44,574 --> 00:03:48,828
Why can't i want something
in my life and get it?!

84
00:03:51,115 --> 00:03:53,082
Just once!

85
00:03:54,584 --> 00:03:58,338
Confidential personnel file
on salvadore ross.

86
00:03:58,373 --> 00:04:01,341
A volatile mixture
of fury and frustration.

87
00:04:01,376 --> 00:04:02,842
Distinguishing
physical characteristic:

88
00:04:02,877 --> 00:04:05,094
A badly broken hand
which will require

89
00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:07,847
emergency treatment
at the nearest hospital.

90
00:04:07,882 --> 00:04:09,849
Ambition:

91
00:04:09,884 --> 00:04:12,352
Shows great determination
toward self-improvement.

92
00:04:12,602 --> 00:04:14,103
Estimate of potential success:

93
00:04:14,138 --> 00:04:16,606
A sure bet for a listing
inwho's who-

94
00:04:16,641 --> 00:04:19,609
in the twilight zone.

95
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:38,461
Here we are, mr. Ross.

96
00:04:38,496 --> 00:04:40,213
The orthopedic ward is full.

97
00:04:40,248 --> 00:04:42,966
But you'll be just fine
in here for tonight.

98
00:04:43,001 --> 00:04:45,218
Why don't you just
let me go home?

99
00:04:45,253 --> 00:04:47,470
The doctor
has to prepare the cast

100
00:04:47,505 --> 00:04:49,472
after he checks
the x-rays tomorrow.

101
00:04:49,507 --> 00:04:50,473
Good night.

102
00:04:50,508 --> 00:04:51,474
Wait a minute!

103
00:04:51,509 --> 00:04:52,976
Where are my clothes?

104
00:04:53,011 --> 00:04:55,228
Your clothes are in that closet.

105
00:04:55,263 --> 00:04:57,230
Now, good night.
Good night.
Good night.

106
00:05:00,268 --> 00:05:02,485
You do something to your hand?

107
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,736
No.

108
00:05:03,771 --> 00:05:06,489
I came here
for a good night's sleep.

109
00:05:06,524 --> 00:05:09,492
The waldorf
was getting on my nerves.

110
00:05:09,527 --> 00:05:11,244
I bet it hurts.

111
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:12,996
Yeah, it hurts.

112
00:05:13,031 --> 00:05:14,747
You're still lucky, though.

113
00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:17,000
My luck wins prizes.

114
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,502
No, i...

115
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:21,004
i mean it.

116
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,008
I've got this awful congestion
in my chest.

117
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:30,013
Are you griping about a cold?

118
00:05:30,048 --> 00:05:33,266
At your age,
it might just be a cold.

119
00:05:33,301 --> 00:05:37,020
But at mine, it could
easily turn into pneumonia.

120
00:05:37,055 --> 00:05:39,272
You know, young man,

121
00:05:39,307 --> 00:05:42,025
you could break both legs
and an elbow

122
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,777
and still be swimming
inside a month.

123
00:05:44,812 --> 00:05:45,778
Yeah?

124
00:05:45,813 --> 00:05:47,280
Well, if you think...

125
00:05:47,315 --> 00:05:50,033
you think this is so great,
let's swap.

126
00:05:50,068 --> 00:05:53,536
You take my busted hand,
i'll take your lousy cold.

127
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:00,043
It's a deal.

128
00:07:05,975 --> 00:07:07,727
Oh, my hand.

129
00:07:07,762 --> 00:07:10,229
What's the matter
with my hand?

130
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,231
Oh.

131
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:13,983
What have you done?

132
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:17,370
Quite a bargain we made,
huh, pop?

133
00:07:17,405 --> 00:07:18,621
No, please.

134
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:20,873
I want to swap back.

135
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:25,495
Please, look, it'll never heal,
not at my age.

136
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:27,997
All deals are final.

137
00:07:38,543 --> 00:07:40,760
If you buy this,
mr. Halpert,

138
00:07:40,795 --> 00:07:43,763
it'll be the best thing
that ever happened to you.

139
00:07:44,514 --> 00:07:46,015
Come in.

140
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:54,023
Wow, some pad!

141
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:56,275
Strange for a man
of my years-

142
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,027
that's what
you're thinking?

143
00:07:58,277 --> 00:08:00,279
Oh, no, listen,
i always figure

144
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:02,532
you still know
how to swing.

145
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:04,283
Well, where is it?

146
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:05,284
What?

147
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,786
This wonderful item

148
00:08:06,821 --> 00:08:08,788
that i'm supposed
to purchase.

149
00:08:08,823 --> 00:08:11,541
Uh... well, you're
looking at it.

150
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:15,044
I'm looking at it?

151
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:16,295
Yeah, it's youth,

152
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,548
that's what i want
to sell you.

153
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:20,299
Youth that
comes in bot...?

154
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:21,801
Get out of here.

155
00:08:21,836 --> 00:08:23,052
No, wait a minute.

156
00:08:23,087 --> 00:08:24,303
I read in the paper

157
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:26,055
you're 72 years
old, right?

158
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:28,057
I'm 26.

159
00:08:28,092 --> 00:08:31,310
Now, what would you give
to be 26 again?

160
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:32,695
You're the kookiest kid

161
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:34,947
they ever turned loose
in the streets.

162
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:36,566
Okay, think
what you want

163
00:08:36,601 --> 00:08:38,317
but just listen, will you?

164
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:39,819
It won't hurt anything.

165
00:08:39,854 --> 00:08:42,321
Come on, how much would you give

166
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:44,457
to be 26 years old
again?

167
00:08:44,492 --> 00:08:45,458
How much?

168
00:08:45,493 --> 00:08:46,826
Well, come on, how much?

169
00:08:46,861 --> 00:08:48,828
Um... a million bucks?

170
00:08:48,863 --> 00:08:51,080
All right,
let's say a million dollars.

171
00:08:51,115 --> 00:08:53,082
And what about this pad,
do you own it?

172
00:08:53,117 --> 00:08:54,083
Yes, i own it.

173
00:08:54,118 --> 00:08:55,718
Do you throw that in
as part of the deal?

174
00:08:55,753 --> 00:08:58,721
How do you propose to deliver
these years you rave about?

175
00:09:01,724 --> 00:09:04,977
I'm going to sell
youmyyears.

176
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:08,481
All right,
tell you what,

177
00:09:08,516 --> 00:09:10,733
you wrap the years up
and mail them to me, huh?

178
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:12,735
Wait, a minute,
how about the pad?

179
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:14,737
Is that going to
be part of the deal?

180
00:09:14,772 --> 00:09:15,988
Yes, i'll make it
part of the deal.

181
00:09:16,023 --> 00:09:17,490
I wouldn't think
of taking your years

182
00:09:17,525 --> 00:09:18,991
for anything less
than their worth.

183
00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:21,244
Man, a million bucks,
and this pad-

184
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,496
you just bought
46 years, mr. Halpert.

185
00:09:23,531 --> 00:09:24,747
I'm sure i did.

186
00:09:24,782 --> 00:09:26,249
No, you're not sure.

187
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:29,001
But you got a big
surprise in store.

188
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:32,505
Go on, get out of here.

189
00:09:37,795 --> 00:09:40,263
Come in.

190
00:09:40,298 --> 00:09:43,266
Here are the evening papers
you ordered, sir.

191
00:09:43,301 --> 00:09:44,767
Come in.

192
00:09:44,802 --> 00:09:46,769
Shut the door.

193
00:09:48,771 --> 00:09:52,525
Come all the way in,
let's have a look at you.

194
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,277
You're the new owner.

195
00:09:54,312 --> 00:09:57,029
I was wondering
why i hadn't seen you.

196
00:09:57,064 --> 00:09:59,782
Well, uh... i've
been staying in.

197
00:09:59,817 --> 00:10:01,284
But i've seen you, uh,

198
00:10:01,319 --> 00:10:02,785
operating the elevator.

199
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,036
Oh?

200
00:10:04,071 --> 00:10:06,289
What happened to mr. Halpert?

201
00:10:06,324 --> 00:10:08,658
Oh, well
he decided to take a cruise

202
00:10:08,693 --> 00:10:10,910
with some young friends of his.

203
00:10:10,945 --> 00:10:12,545
He'll be away
so long

204
00:10:12,662 --> 00:10:14,163
he was kind enough to...

205
00:10:14,198 --> 00:10:15,665
sell me this place.

206
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,550
Sounds just like mr. Halpert.

207
00:10:17,585 --> 00:10:20,052
He sure knew
how to spend his money.

208
00:10:20,087 --> 00:10:23,055
How much do you
make a year?

209
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:25,808
Well, um, right now

210
00:10:25,843 --> 00:10:28,561
i get $52.50 a week,
plus tips.

211
00:10:28,596 --> 00:10:29,562
Hmm.

212
00:10:29,597 --> 00:10:32,565
Well, then, this
should help some.

213
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:36,068
Here we are.

214
00:10:36,103 --> 00:10:37,320
Picture of lincoln

215
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,572
just for
bringing the papers.

216
00:10:39,607 --> 00:10:41,324
Mr. Ross,
i have a feeling

217
00:10:41,359 --> 00:10:43,576
you'll get very good
service here.

218
00:10:43,611 --> 00:10:46,579
How would you like
to make more...

219
00:10:46,614 --> 00:10:47,580
lots more?

220
00:10:47,615 --> 00:10:50,583
Just so long as
it's legal, mr. Ross.

221
00:10:50,618 --> 00:10:52,335
How old are you?

222
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:53,336
Nineteen.

223
00:10:53,371 --> 00:10:56,088
Would you like to be 20?

224
00:10:56,123 --> 00:10:58,090
I'll make it one of these years.

225
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:01,844
What would you say
if someone wanted to buy

226
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:04,847
a year of your life
for say, uh...

227
00:11:04,882 --> 00:11:06,349
$250?

228
00:11:06,384 --> 00:11:08,351
I suppose i'd tell him

229
00:11:08,386 --> 00:11:10,853
to go take a leap at the moon.

230
00:11:10,888 --> 00:11:14,473
You wouldn't sell a year
of your life for that money?

231
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:16,359
I enjoy my life, mr. Ross.

232
00:11:16,394 --> 00:11:18,110
The days may be
dull, but...

233
00:11:18,361 --> 00:11:21,614
i wouldn't swap
some of my nights for...

234
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:24,617
all the crown jewels
in a golden bucket.

235
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,377
Wait, come back!

236
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,881
Yes, sir?

237
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:43,135
You thought i was joking,
didn't you?

238
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:45,137
I don't think i know

239
00:11:45,172 --> 00:11:47,139
what you're talking
about, mr. Ross.

240
00:11:47,174 --> 00:11:48,641
What's your name?

241
00:11:48,676 --> 00:11:50,643
Albert... rowe.

242
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:55,398
Well, you can put
that in later, hmm?

243
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,152
Here we are.

244
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:03,155
Now...

245
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:10,029
doesn't that make it
more reasonable?

246
00:12:12,281 --> 00:12:14,283
That's a thousand dollars,
mr. Ross.

247
00:12:14,318 --> 00:12:15,534
That's right, albert.

248
00:12:15,785 --> 00:12:18,537
What do i have to do?

249
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:20,289
I told you- nothing.

250
00:12:20,324 --> 00:12:22,041
If you accept this,

251
00:12:22,076 --> 00:12:25,544
you'll wake up in the morning
one year older, that's all.

252
00:12:25,795 --> 00:12:28,547
Does it really make
that much difference

253
00:12:28,798 --> 00:12:30,299
whether you're 19 or 20?

254
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:32,551
Now that you put it that way,

255
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:35,805
l-i guess 20 is
not such a bad age.

256
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,306
Fine.

257
00:12:37,341 --> 00:12:39,692
Then you've made
a deal, albert.

258
00:12:39,727 --> 00:12:42,194
A very,
very good deal.

259
00:12:42,229 --> 00:12:44,947
Nice doing business
with you, mr. Ross...

260
00:12:44,982 --> 00:12:45,948
and albert.

261
00:12:45,983 --> 00:12:48,200
Pass the word
among your friends

262
00:12:48,235 --> 00:12:50,953
i'm always good for cash
on these terms.

263
00:12:50,988 --> 00:12:53,956
They'll be...
beating down your doors.

264
00:12:53,991 --> 00:12:57,209
Who knows,
i might decide to sell you

265
00:12:57,244 --> 00:12:58,711
a couple more years myself.

266
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:05,835
I'll be here, albert.

267
00:13:24,153 --> 00:13:25,404
Thank you for waiting.

268
00:13:25,439 --> 00:13:27,406
Yes, sir.

269
00:13:27,441 --> 00:13:29,408
You're new here,
aren't you?

270
00:13:29,443 --> 00:13:30,910
Yes, sir.

271
00:13:46,675 --> 00:13:49,178
Thank you, mr. Ross.

272
00:13:54,718 --> 00:13:56,185
I'm coming.

273
00:13:59,688 --> 00:14:01,440
Is leah home yet?

274
00:14:01,475 --> 00:14:03,442
No, not yet she isn't.

275
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:08,948
You don't mind
if i wait for her, do you?

276
00:14:08,983 --> 00:14:11,450
Haven't seen you
for quite a while.

277
00:14:11,485 --> 00:14:12,701
Well, i've been busy

278
00:14:12,736 --> 00:14:15,955
making myself worthy
of your daughter.

279
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:18,707
Leave her alone, please.

280
00:14:18,742 --> 00:14:20,075
Come on.

281
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:22,077
Look, my nails are clean.

282
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:24,330
I'm dressed
in the right clothes.

283
00:14:24,365 --> 00:14:26,332
You're obviously
doing very well

284
00:14:26,367 --> 00:14:27,333
and i'm glad.

285
00:14:27,368 --> 00:14:29,335
Then why tell me
to leave her alone?

286
00:14:29,585 --> 00:14:31,837
I'm a good catch, mr. Maitland.

287
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:33,339
A real good catch.

288
00:14:33,374 --> 00:14:34,590
Not for leah.

289
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:38,093
Yes... exactly for leah.

290
00:14:39,094 --> 00:14:40,229
Tell me, what is it

291
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:42,481
that makes you
so superior, huh?

292
00:14:42,731 --> 00:14:44,233
I mean, what
have you done

293
00:14:44,268 --> 00:14:46,485
that puts you on
the top shelf?

294
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,487
Teaching in that
rattrap school

295
00:14:48,522 --> 00:14:49,989
all your life?

296
00:14:50,024 --> 00:14:52,241
No, not teaching,
um, baby-sitting.

297
00:14:52,276 --> 00:14:55,244
And you come home
from the war...

298
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:56,745
and what do you bring?

299
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:57,997
A game leg

300
00:14:58,032 --> 00:14:59,999
and a handful
of crummy souvenirs

301
00:15:00,034 --> 00:15:01,750
to put on your wall.

302
00:15:02,751 --> 00:15:04,253
You know what you are?

303
00:15:04,288 --> 00:15:06,255
You're a loser, mr. Maitland.

304
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:08,257
Even worse than
i used to be.

305
00:15:08,292 --> 00:15:11,760
And you want leah to marry
somebody like you, huh?

306
00:15:11,795 --> 00:15:14,013
Yes, even though
in your eyes i'm a failure.

307
00:15:14,263 --> 00:15:16,015
Would you be a good husband
to her?

308
00:15:20,135 --> 00:15:23,138
I can buy her anything
if i want to.

309
00:15:23,173 --> 00:15:24,640
Do you love her?

310
00:15:24,675 --> 00:15:26,892
I want her,
mr. Maitland.

311
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:28,394
That's not enough.

312
00:15:28,429 --> 00:15:31,647
Leah needs somebody
who is kind and...

313
00:15:31,682 --> 00:15:33,399
hi, dad.

314
00:15:33,434 --> 00:15:35,150
Hello, dear.

315
00:15:37,653 --> 00:15:39,405
Hello, sal.

316
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:42,408
Hi.

317
00:15:42,443 --> 00:15:43,909
Your father and i

318
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:47,162
were having a
pleasant little chat.

319
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:50,049
I've worked very hard
to improve myself.

320
00:15:50,084 --> 00:15:51,800
Haven't i, mr. Maitland?

321
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,671
You certainly look
very prosperous.

322
00:15:55,921 --> 00:15:57,172
I've had some luck.

323
00:15:57,207 --> 00:15:59,058
Did you?

324
00:15:59,093 --> 00:16:00,809
I'm glad.

325
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:05,064
You know, you even
sound different.

326
00:16:05,099 --> 00:16:07,066
Oh, you
noticed that.

327
00:16:07,101 --> 00:16:10,069
Well, i met this young fellow
from college

328
00:16:10,104 --> 00:16:13,072
and he needed some money,
so we made a deal.

329
00:16:13,107 --> 00:16:16,325
I paid him to help me
improve my way of talking.

330
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:18,444
You must have worked
very hard, sal.

331
00:16:18,479 --> 00:16:21,196
I'll tell you
about it over supper.

332
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:22,948
No, thank you
very much.

333
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:24,950
I'm really
so busy tonight.

334
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:26,201
Nonsense.

335
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:28,704
I've worked so hard
at improving myself

336
00:16:28,739 --> 00:16:31,957
even your father can't
object to you going out with me.

337
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:33,842
Can you,
mr. Maitland?

338
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:36,962
Would you mind, dad?

339
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:38,213
Leah, you know

340
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:41,717
i've never tried
to tell you what to do.

341
00:16:41,752 --> 00:16:43,719
I won't stay out late.

342
00:16:43,754 --> 00:16:46,722
And i would like to hear
about everything

343
00:16:46,855 --> 00:16:48,607
that's been
happening to you.

344
00:16:48,642 --> 00:16:52,227
Just give me a couple
of minutes to change.

345
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:58,484
See?

346
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:10,996
Now tell me

347
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:13,499
you feel nothing
but a blank.

348
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:23,008
That, uh...

349
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:25,761
that never was the problem.

350
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:29,264
Well, then, what
was the problem?

351
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:32,151
You broke off with me
because i was wrong.

352
00:17:32,186 --> 00:17:34,153
What guy is right
for you, leah?

353
00:17:34,188 --> 00:17:37,156
Tell me what kind of
guy is right for you

354
00:17:37,191 --> 00:17:38,907
and i'll be that guy.

355
00:17:38,942 --> 00:17:40,659
It doesn't work that way.

356
00:17:40,694 --> 00:17:44,163
Well, i've got a christmas
morning surprise for you, baby.

357
00:17:44,198 --> 00:17:45,914
It works that way with me.

358
00:17:45,949 --> 00:17:48,417
I can be
anything i want.

359
00:17:48,452 --> 00:17:52,171
I can buy
anything i want.

360
00:17:52,206 --> 00:17:54,423
I wish i could
explain it to you.

361
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:57,176
It's not something
that you can buy.

362
00:17:57,211 --> 00:17:59,178
You name it.

363
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:04,183
It's the kind
of person you are.

364
00:18:04,218 --> 00:18:08,187
The things you care about,
the people you care about.

365
00:18:08,222 --> 00:18:10,189
I'm not criticizing you.

366
00:18:10,224 --> 00:18:12,691
It's just the way
you are.

367
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:17,446
What way, hmm?

368
00:18:19,448 --> 00:18:20,949
You don't care about me.

369
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:23,819
Not really.

370
00:18:23,854 --> 00:18:26,321
You don't care about anybody.

371
00:18:28,457 --> 00:18:30,459
Are you gentle?

372
00:18:32,461 --> 00:18:34,713
Are you kind?

373
00:18:34,748 --> 00:18:35,964
The man i marry

374
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:38,217
is going to have
to have compassion

375
00:18:38,252 --> 00:18:41,220
because otherwise,
i won't be able to love him.

376
00:18:41,255 --> 00:18:44,223
You mean like
your stupid old man

377
00:18:44,258 --> 00:18:45,474
who rushes up eager
to get pushed around?

378
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:50,979
Yes. I think my father's
a compassionate man.

379
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:55,234
He cares about people
just because they're people!

380
00:18:55,269 --> 00:18:58,487
That's the kind of man
i'm talking about.

381
00:18:59,988 --> 00:19:02,741
I'm tired, sal.

382
00:19:02,776 --> 00:19:04,743
I'm going home.

383
00:19:04,778 --> 00:19:05,994
Come here.

384
00:19:13,502 --> 00:19:15,504
Don't you understand?

385
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:20,008
It's not something
that you can buy.

386
00:19:21,009 --> 00:19:22,261
Go on, get out.

387
00:19:22,511 --> 00:19:24,379
Get out of here.

388
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:42,648
Hello, dad.

389
00:19:42,683 --> 00:19:44,650
Hello.

390
00:19:44,685 --> 00:19:45,901
Oh, mr. Maitland.

391
00:19:45,936 --> 00:19:48,403
You shouldn't have
waited up for us.

392
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:50,405
Here she is,
safe and sounder

393
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:52,658
than she was
before she left.

394
00:19:52,693 --> 00:19:54,159
I'm sorry, dad.

395
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:55,410
It's all right.

396
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:56,662
It's nice to know

397
00:19:56,912 --> 00:19:58,163
that somebody
worries about me though.

398
00:19:58,413 --> 00:20:01,416
Don't flatter yourself
so much, my dear.

399
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:03,669
I really wanted
to talk to sal.

400
00:20:05,053 --> 00:20:07,306
All right.

401
00:20:07,341 --> 00:20:09,808
If, uh, you two
will excuse me,

402
00:20:09,843 --> 00:20:13,312
i've really got
a very busy day tomorrow.

403
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:18,567
Good-bye, sal.

404
00:20:18,602 --> 00:20:21,820
So long.

405
00:20:21,855 --> 00:20:23,322
Good night, dad.

406
00:20:23,357 --> 00:20:25,574
Good night, dear.

407
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:32,831
I'm glad you came in.

408
00:20:32,866 --> 00:20:34,833
Oh, well, you're going
to be even gladder.

409
00:20:34,868 --> 00:20:36,335
I've thought
a lot about it,

410
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:38,837
and though i realize that
you are what you are

411
00:20:38,872 --> 00:20:40,839
and it's not my place
to judge you...

412
00:20:40,874 --> 00:20:42,341
oh, look, i don't care

413
00:20:42,376 --> 00:20:43,842
please, please.
What you think of me...

414
00:20:43,877 --> 00:20:47,596
i cannot let you ruin
her life by marrying her.

415
00:20:47,631 --> 00:20:49,715
I came here
strictly on business.

416
00:20:50,966 --> 00:20:53,468
You've got something
i want to buy

417
00:20:53,503 --> 00:20:56,722
and i'm prepared to offer you
$100,000 for it.

418
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:03,362
Now let that sum

419
00:21:03,397 --> 00:21:05,864
stir around in your head
for a minute-

420
00:21:05,899 --> 00:21:10,369
$100,000.

421
00:21:10,404 --> 00:21:13,372
Now that's enough
to take care of you

422
00:21:13,407 --> 00:21:15,374
and to provide for leah.

423
00:21:15,409 --> 00:21:19,878
What do i have that's
worth that kind of money?

424
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:25,133
Well...

425
00:21:25,168 --> 00:21:28,387
it's a little hard to explain.

426
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:51,910
I love you very much.

427
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:05,924
Hello, mr. Maitland.

428
00:22:05,959 --> 00:22:07,426
I was just telling leah

429
00:22:07,676 --> 00:22:09,678
that i was hoping
you'd be home.

430
00:22:09,713 --> 00:22:12,431
L- i wanted to talk to you.

431
00:22:12,466 --> 00:22:13,932
Can i come in?

432
00:22:13,967 --> 00:22:15,434
Yes.

433
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:34,820
Honey, would you
leave us alone

434
00:22:34,855 --> 00:22:36,321
for a few minutes?

435
00:22:36,356 --> 00:22:37,823
It won't take long.

436
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:41,827
I love you.

437
00:22:57,976 --> 00:23:00,979
I've got something
i want to say to you.

438
00:23:01,014 --> 00:23:05,984
I'm sorry for all the worry
and grief i've caused you.

439
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:11,106
You see,
you were right about me.

440
00:23:11,141 --> 00:23:15,110
I wanted to marry leah
to prove something...

441
00:23:15,145 --> 00:23:16,862
i, i...

442
00:23:16,897 --> 00:23:20,365
you see,
she was a prize, a symbol.

443
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:24,002
But all that's changed.

444
00:23:24,037 --> 00:23:25,504
And i know now

445
00:23:25,539 --> 00:23:29,007
that i'm very much
in love with her.

446
00:23:29,257 --> 00:23:31,510
And i'll make her
a good husband,

447
00:23:31,545 --> 00:23:33,011
i promise you that.

448
00:23:33,046 --> 00:23:35,514
I warned you
i wouldn't let it happen.

449
00:23:35,549 --> 00:23:38,517
You don't understand.

450
00:23:38,552 --> 00:23:42,270
It's all changed.

451
00:23:42,305 --> 00:23:46,274
I'm asking you
for forgiveness...

452
00:23:46,309 --> 00:23:47,776
for compassion.

453
00:23:49,778 --> 00:23:51,780
Compassion?

454
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:55,534
Don't you remember?

455
00:23:55,569 --> 00:23:58,036
I sold it to you yesterday.

456
00:24:08,163 --> 00:24:11,416
The salvadore ross program
for self-improvement.

457
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:14,169
The all-in-one,
surefire success course

458
00:24:14,204 --> 00:24:16,171
that lets you lick the bully

459
00:24:16,206 --> 00:24:18,924
learn the language,
dance the tango

460
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:21,426
and anything else
you want to do-

461
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:23,178
or think you want to do.

462
00:24:23,213 --> 00:24:24,679
Money-back guarantee.

463
00:24:24,714 --> 00:24:26,932
Offer limited to...
the twilight zone.

464
00:24:30,819 --> 00:24:32,771
And now, mr. Serling.

465
00:24:32,806 --> 00:24:35,524
On our next outing,
charles beaumont comes through

466
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:37,526
with another delightful
flight of futuristic fantasy

467
00:24:37,561 --> 00:24:40,028
about a society of another time
in which you literally

468
00:24:40,063 --> 00:24:42,030
can't tell the players
without a scorecard-

469
00:24:42,065 --> 00:24:44,282
they all appear
in an identical mold.

470
00:24:44,533 --> 00:24:46,034
Collin wilcox, richard long,

471
00:24:46,069 --> 00:24:47,786
and special guest star
suzy parker

472
00:24:47,821 --> 00:24:49,287
appear in a program called

473
00:24:49,322 --> 00:24:51,039
"number twelve
looks just like you."

474
00:24:51,074 --> 00:24:55,043
I hope you're around
to catch the similarity.
