1
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:11,561
You're traveling
through another dimension,

2
00:00:11,596 --> 00:00:14,698
a dimension not only
of sight and sound, but of mind

3
00:00:14,733 --> 00:00:16,566
a journey into a wondrous land

4
00:00:16,601 --> 00:00:18,451
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

5
00:00:18,486 --> 00:00:20,070
That's the signpost up ahead.

6
00:00:20,105 --> 00:00:22,572
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

7
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:35,719
I know it's...
it's an incredible story.

8
00:00:35,754 --> 00:00:39,839
I, of all people, know this,
that you won't believe me

9
00:00:39,874 --> 00:00:40,724
no, not at first.

10
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:43,843
But i'm going to tell you
the whole thing.

11
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:46,346
Then you will believe,
because you must.

12
00:00:46,381 --> 00:00:50,233
You must believe!

13
00:00:50,268 --> 00:00:53,987
It happened many years ago,
after the first world war.

14
00:00:54,022 --> 00:00:57,741
I was on a walking trip
through central europe.

15
00:00:57,776 --> 00:01:03,363
But one night i...
one night i got lost in a storm.

16
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:27,520
Yes? What is it?

17
00:01:29,272 --> 00:01:30,523
Please...

18
00:01:30,558 --> 00:01:31,775
please, let me in.

19
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:33,026
I'm lost.

20
00:01:33,061 --> 00:01:35,528
I'm sorry, we don't
allow visitors

21
00:01:35,563 --> 00:01:36,780
in the hermitage.

22
00:01:36,815 --> 00:01:38,031
Oh, i'm not
a visitor.

23
00:01:38,066 --> 00:01:39,899
I'm... i'm
a stranger here.

24
00:01:39,934 --> 00:01:42,402
I'm... i'm lost.

25
00:01:42,437 --> 00:01:44,287
No, you don't
understand.

26
00:01:44,904 --> 00:01:46,156
I'm lost.

27
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:29,833
I'll be all right
once i dry out.

28
00:02:29,868 --> 00:02:31,084
Wait here.

29
00:02:31,119 --> 00:02:34,204
I have to speak
to brother jerome.

30
00:02:52,355 --> 00:02:55,475
Brother jerome
will see you now.

31
00:02:59,264 --> 00:03:00,480
What was that?

32
00:03:00,515 --> 00:03:01,731
The wind.

33
00:03:01,766 --> 00:03:02,982
Come.

34
00:03:28,641 --> 00:03:29,893
Why have you come here?

35
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:34,898
My... my name is ellington.

36
00:03:34,933 --> 00:03:38,017
I'm on a walking trip,
but got lost in the storm.

37
00:03:39,304 --> 00:03:41,154
Excuse me.

38
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:44,908
I saw light here.

39
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:48,161
What do you want from us?

40
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:51,531
Shelter

41
00:03:51,566 --> 00:03:54,534
and maybe
some food.

42
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:56,419
We cannot help you.

43
00:03:56,454 --> 00:03:58,288
You will have to leave.

44
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:03,927
Now, mr. Ellington... now.

45
00:04:35,825 --> 00:04:38,962
The prostrate form
of mr. David ellington-

46
00:04:38,997 --> 00:04:42,715
scholar, seeker of truth, and
regrettably, finder of truth-

47
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,418
a man who will shortly arise
from his exhaustion

48
00:04:45,453 --> 00:04:48,554
to confront a problem
that has tormented mankind

49
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:50,423
since the beginning of time-

50
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:53,559
a man who knocked on a door
seeking sanctuary

51
00:04:53,594 --> 00:04:57,313
and found instead the outer
edges of the twilight zone.

52
00:05:44,527 --> 00:05:45,778
Help me!

53
00:05:45,813 --> 00:05:49,532
No, please, in the name
of mercy, help me.

54
00:05:49,567 --> 00:05:51,401
You're not one of them.

55
00:05:51,436 --> 00:05:53,286
No, my name
is ellington.

56
00:05:53,321 --> 00:05:54,537
I'm an american.

57
00:05:54,572 --> 00:05:55,788
Shh!

58
00:05:55,823 --> 00:05:57,657
We have only moments.

59
00:05:57,692 --> 00:06:00,159
Come closer... come.

60
00:06:03,913 --> 00:06:05,798
They're mad,
mr. Ellington...

61
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:07,667
all of them, raving mad.

62
00:06:07,702 --> 00:06:11,421
Listen, i was in the village
in schwartzwald.

63
00:06:11,456 --> 00:06:15,174
I was walking in the street
with my woman.

64
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:19,312
We paused to rest by a tree

65
00:06:19,347 --> 00:06:20,563
and we kissed.

66
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:23,683
Is it wrong to kiss?

67
00:06:23,718 --> 00:06:24,934
Tell me.

68
00:06:27,437 --> 00:06:28,688
I... i don't think so.

69
00:06:28,723 --> 00:06:31,190
Of course you don't.

70
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:34,944
You don't think so,
i don't think so.

71
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:37,447
But jerome...
the lecherous old fool.

72
00:06:37,482 --> 00:06:44,337
We looked up... and i saw him
standing close by.

73
00:06:44,372 --> 00:06:46,839
I tried to open
my mouth to speak,

74
00:06:46,874 --> 00:06:48,091
but before i could
utter a sound,

75
00:06:48,126 --> 00:06:49,959
he raised that heavy staff
he carries.

76
00:06:49,994 --> 00:06:50,593
You've seen it?

77
00:06:53,096 --> 00:06:55,848
And he hit me again and again.

78
00:06:55,883 --> 00:06:58,851
Why?

79
00:06:58,886 --> 00:07:00,103
For revenge.

80
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:04,223
Because she refused
his advances.

81
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:06,109
He took his fury out on me.

82
00:07:06,144 --> 00:07:11,731
I... i'm sorry, i... i find this
difficult to believe.

83
00:07:11,766 --> 00:07:13,616
Of course you do,
mr. Ellington.

84
00:07:13,651 --> 00:07:14,867
That's the strength
of the man.

85
00:07:14,902 --> 00:07:19,238
He makes his madness
seem a harmless thing.

86
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:23,626
The... the madness
of a religious zealot.

87
00:07:23,661 --> 00:07:26,746
This is not a religious order,
mr. Ellington.

88
00:07:26,781 --> 00:07:28,631
These so-called
brothers of truth,

89
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:31,751
they're outcasts, misfits,
cut off from the world

90
00:07:31,786 --> 00:07:34,253
because the world
won't have them.

91
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:37,757
Mr. Ellington,
please.

92
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:39,008
You must
believe me.

93
00:07:39,642 --> 00:07:42,895
I don't say they're evil.

94
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,147
I say they're mad.

95
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,152
Where are you going?

96
00:07:49,187 --> 00:07:51,020
I'll speak to jerome.

97
00:07:51,055 --> 00:07:53,523
No! He's the greatest
maniac of them all.

98
00:07:53,558 --> 00:07:55,408
But then how can
i help you?

99
00:07:55,443 --> 00:07:56,659
Mr. Ellington!

100
00:07:58,411 --> 00:07:59,028
I did not know

101
00:07:59,063 --> 00:08:01,531
that you were
well enough to walk.

102
00:08:01,566 --> 00:08:04,033
Come with me,
please.

103
00:08:04,068 --> 00:08:05,284
I must talk
with you.

104
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:07,170
This way.

105
00:08:19,682 --> 00:08:22,185
I must ask you to leave
the hermitage, mr. Ellington.

106
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:25,304
We have no facilities
for the care of the ill.

107
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:27,190
Arrangements can made
at schwartzwald.

108
00:08:27,225 --> 00:08:28,441
Just a minute.

109
00:08:28,476 --> 00:08:30,309
No, not a minute, not another second, mr. Ellington
- now!

110
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:31,561
Why?

111
00:08:31,596 --> 00:08:33,446
I have already
explained that.

112
00:08:33,481 --> 00:08:35,314
No, you've
explained nothing.

113
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:40,319
No one asked me to come
here, i realize that,

114
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:42,205
but that's no excuse
for your behavior.

115
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,456
My son...

116
00:08:43,491 --> 00:08:44,073
i'm not your son.

117
00:08:44,108 --> 00:08:45,324
You don't understand.

118
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:46,576
That's right, i don't.

119
00:08:46,611 --> 00:08:47,827
So why don't you tell me?

120
00:08:47,862 --> 00:08:50,329
Why are you in such
a hurry for me to leave?

121
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:52,215
What are you afraid
i'll find out?

122
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,083
It's the man you have
locked up in the cell,

123
00:08:54,717 --> 00:08:55,334
isn't it, brother?

124
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:57,220
Well, that isn't
a secret anymore.

125
00:08:57,255 --> 00:08:58,471
I know about him.

126
00:08:58,506 --> 00:08:59,722
What man is this,
mr. Ellington?

127
00:08:59,757 --> 00:09:00,973
The one we just left.

128
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:03,476
The one who's been
screaming his head off.

129
00:09:03,511 --> 00:09:06,596
I'm not sure you know
what you're saying.

130
00:09:09,732 --> 00:09:10,983
Look, brother,

131
00:09:11,018 --> 00:09:12,852
i don't know much
about this cult of yours-

132
00:09:12,887 --> 00:09:15,354
what's permitted,
what isn't permitted-

133
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:17,857
but i seriously doubt
if you have the authority

134
00:09:17,892 --> 00:09:19,742
to imprison a man
against his will.

135
00:09:19,777 --> 00:09:20,359
That is quite true.

136
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:22,245
We have
no such authority.

137
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,113
Then why have you done it?

138
00:09:24,148 --> 00:09:26,616
No man has ever
been imprisoned

139
00:09:26,651 --> 00:09:29,118
in the hermitage,
mr. Ellington.

140
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:32,255
I was just talking
with him.

141
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:34,123
You talked to no man.

142
00:09:34,158 --> 00:09:37,877
You have been very ill,
mr. Ellington.

143
00:09:37,912 --> 00:09:39,762
You've suffered
delirium.

144
00:09:44,802 --> 00:09:49,138
Oh, now don't tell me
you didn't hear that.

145
00:09:49,173 --> 00:09:52,275
Honest men make
unconvincing liars.

146
00:09:59,148 --> 00:10:01,033
I'll find out
eventually, you know?

147
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:02,285
What do you mean?

148
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,536
Just what i say.

149
00:10:03,571 --> 00:10:06,656
The police will be
very interested to learn

150
00:10:06,691 --> 00:10:09,792
that you people are keeping
a man in prison here.

151
00:10:09,827 --> 00:10:11,661
I tell you,
there is no man!

152
00:10:11,696 --> 00:10:13,546
All right, just forget it.

153
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:20,169
Mr. Ellington...

154
00:10:20,204 --> 00:10:22,054
yes?

155
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:24,557
Would you really
go to the police?

156
00:10:24,592 --> 00:10:27,059
Would you?

157
00:10:32,682 --> 00:10:35,184
Very well.

158
00:10:35,219 --> 00:10:37,069
I have told you
the truth

159
00:10:37,104 --> 00:10:38,938
but only
a part of it.

160
00:10:38,973 --> 00:10:40,823
Now i see i shall
have to tell you

161
00:10:40,858 --> 00:10:43,326
the whole truth.

162
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:50,199
Shut the door,
mr. Ellington.

163
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,843
Then you do hear it?

164
00:11:00,878 --> 00:11:03,963
As i have heard it
every hour of every day

165
00:11:03,998 --> 00:11:06,465
for five long years.

166
00:11:07,717 --> 00:11:09,602
Why did
you lie?

167
00:11:09,637 --> 00:11:10,853
I didn't.

168
00:11:12,722 --> 00:11:16,475
When i told you that no man
howled at the hermitage,

169
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,361
i was being perfectly honest.

170
00:11:20,863 --> 00:11:23,983
What you saw is not a man.

171
00:11:24,018 --> 00:11:27,737
It is the devil himself.

172
00:11:45,221 --> 00:11:49,592
Yes, the devil himself.

173
00:11:49,627 --> 00:11:52,094
What you saw in the cell
is satan.

174
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:55,848
Otherwise known
as the dark angel,

175
00:11:55,883 --> 00:12:03,489
ahriman, asmodeus,
belial, diabolus, the devil.

176
00:12:03,524 --> 00:12:05,357
You asked for the truth.

177
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:07,860
Now you have it.

178
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:10,996
You do believe me,
don't you?

179
00:12:12,248 --> 00:12:15,367
Uh... sure, of course.

180
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:19,121
No, now it is you who are
lying, mr. Ellington.

181
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:21,006
You don't
believe me at all.

182
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:22,258
Quite to the contrary.

183
00:12:22,293 --> 00:12:25,377
You're now quite certain
of what you suspected-

184
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:26,629
that i am mad.

185
00:12:26,664 --> 00:12:28,514
Sit down,
mr. Ellington

186
00:12:28,549 --> 00:12:29,765
and we'll see.

187
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,016
Let me tell you a story

188
00:12:31,051 --> 00:12:34,770
and we'll see how certain
you are that i am mad-

189
00:12:34,805 --> 00:12:37,273
how certain you are
of anything.

190
00:12:37,308 --> 00:12:42,895
I suppose you fancy yourself
a sophisticated man.

191
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,780
You consider us to be primitive

192
00:12:44,815 --> 00:12:47,283
because we live
here in solitude,

193
00:12:47,318 --> 00:12:50,402
away from the so-called
"real world."

194
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:51,654
We are misfits.

195
00:12:51,689 --> 00:12:52,905
No, no...

196
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:53,539
oh, please.

197
00:12:53,574 --> 00:12:54,790
I know all the theories.

198
00:12:54,825 --> 00:12:56,041
I assure you, brother, that...

199
00:12:56,076 --> 00:12:57,293
no, mr. Ellington.

200
00:12:57,328 --> 00:13:00,412
It is i who am assuring you.

201
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:04,166
I am not the ignorant fanatic
i would appear.

202
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:07,920
Oh, i coped with your world
for 40 years...

203
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:11,056
and rather successfully at that.

204
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:12,925
The best schools,
a degree in philosophy,

205
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:16,679
a job that took me
to the ends of the earth.

206
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:22,935
This beard...

207
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:25,437
this staff...

208
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:27,323
and this faith...

209
00:13:27,358 --> 00:13:31,694
are merely the results
of a different point of view.

210
00:13:31,729 --> 00:13:33,829
If you could
understand that,

211
00:13:33,864 --> 00:13:36,332
you could listen
to what i have to say

212
00:13:36,367 --> 00:13:37,583
with an open mind.

213
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:45,341
Five years ago, there were
no howls in the hermitage.

214
00:13:45,376 --> 00:13:47,843
There was simply
the bombed-out ruin

215
00:13:47,878 --> 00:13:51,597
of an old castle belonging
to the family wolfen.

216
00:13:51,632 --> 00:13:54,717
Baron wolfen gave it
to the brotherhood of truth

217
00:13:54,752 --> 00:13:56,602
as a gesture of charity.

218
00:13:56,637 --> 00:13:59,104
Our job was
to tend the vineyards

219
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:02,858
and save what souls we could
by constant prayer.

220
00:14:02,893 --> 00:14:06,729
But this isn't a religious
order, is it, brother?

221
00:14:06,764 --> 00:14:09,865
We feel that we are
recognized by god.

222
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,734
Truth is
our dogma.

223
00:14:11,769 --> 00:14:14,737
We believe it to be
man's greatest weapon

224
00:14:14,772 --> 00:14:17,873
against the devil,
who is the father of all lies.

225
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:20,743
All right, go on
with your story.

226
00:14:21,377 --> 00:14:22,628
You were tending
the vineyards.

227
00:14:22,663 --> 00:14:25,748
At that time, shortly
after the great war,

228
00:14:26,382 --> 00:14:28,250
the world was in chaos.

229
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:30,135
Everywhere
was unhappiness

230
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:33,255
except in this
little village below.

231
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:36,392
For some reason,
the people of schwartzwald

232
00:14:36,427 --> 00:14:38,260
refused to yield
to despair.

233
00:14:38,295 --> 00:14:40,145
They lost none
of their faith.

234
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:43,899
They continued as they
had been for centuries-

235
00:14:43,934 --> 00:14:48,270
honest, god-fearing
and happy.

236
00:14:48,904 --> 00:14:50,773
This village was
a plum to satan

237
00:14:50,808 --> 00:14:53,275
one he could not resist,
so he came here

238
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:55,778
and embarked upon
a program of corruption.

239
00:14:55,813 --> 00:14:57,029
But you stopped him.

240
00:14:57,663 --> 00:14:58,914
Yes!

241
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:01,417
You see, mr. Ellington,

242
00:15:01,452 --> 00:15:05,788
he made the same mistake
thatyouhave made.

243
00:15:05,823 --> 00:15:07,673
He underestimatedme.

244
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:10,175
He thought he would
have no difficulty

245
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:12,044
in tempting the old fool.

246
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,180
But i had him in a cell before
he knew what happened.

247
00:15:15,215 --> 00:15:18,300
But if he's the devil,
how do you keep him locked up?

248
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:21,437
With the staff of truth-

249
00:15:21,472 --> 00:15:24,556
the one barrier he cannot pass.

250
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:27,059
Tell me, how did
yourecognize him?

251
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:28,310
He doesn't look evil.

252
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:32,698
The devil hath power
to assume a pleasing shape.

253
00:15:32,733 --> 00:15:37,069
I had seen him before
in all parts of the world

254
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:41,457
in all forms and guises,
wherever there was sin

255
00:15:41,492 --> 00:15:43,959
wherever there
was strife

256
00:15:43,994 --> 00:15:48,330
wherever there was corruption, persecution

257
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:50,215
there he was also.

258
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:54,586
Sometimes he was only a
spectator, a face in the crowd,

259
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:58,340
but always he was there.

260
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:01,477
Now...

261
00:16:01,512 --> 00:16:04,596
you see, i hope,
why you must say nothing

262
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:07,733
of what you've seen
and heard here.

263
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:12,104
Brother, it's not
that i doubt you

264
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:15,240
you understand,
only isn't it possible

265
00:16:15,275 --> 00:16:17,109
you might have
made a mistake?

266
00:16:17,144 --> 00:16:18,994
No! Think,
mr. Ellington.

267
00:16:19,029 --> 00:16:20,863
Think of the peace
of the world

268
00:16:20,898 --> 00:16:22,748
these last five years.

269
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:24,616
Think of
this country now.

270
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:25,868
Is there
another like it?

271
00:16:25,903 --> 00:16:27,753
You haven't put
an end to suffering.

272
00:16:27,788 --> 00:16:29,621
There's still
murders, robberies.

273
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:30,873
Even now while
we're talking,

274
00:16:30,908 --> 00:16:32,508
people are starving.

275
00:16:32,543 --> 00:16:35,010
The suffering man
wasmeantto endure.

276
00:16:35,045 --> 00:16:37,513
We cause most of
our own griefs.

277
00:16:37,548 --> 00:16:39,381
We need no help
from him.

278
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,266
It is the unnatural
catastrophes,

279
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:44,386
the great wars, the
overwhelming pestilences

280
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:46,889
the wholesale sinning
that we have stopped.

281
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,143
I believe you, brother.

282
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:53,028
Do youtruly?

283
00:16:53,063 --> 00:16:54,279
Yes.

284
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:56,148
I admit, i was
doubtful at first,

285
00:16:56,183 --> 00:16:58,650
but you've convinced me,
absolutely.

286
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:01,153
I promise to keep
your secret.

287
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:02,037
Good, my son.

288
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:05,791
Tomorrow, if you
feel well enough,

289
00:17:05,826 --> 00:17:08,293
you may leave.

290
00:17:08,328 --> 00:17:09,795
In the meantime,

291
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:12,297
brother christophorus
will look after you.

292
00:17:12,332 --> 00:17:17,920
Please, go directly
to his room.

293
00:17:17,955 --> 00:17:19,805
Good night, brother.

294
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:58,961
He lied to you, didn't he?

295
00:17:58,996 --> 00:18:00,846
I can see that.

296
00:18:00,881 --> 00:18:03,348
What did he say?

297
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:05,851
He said you
were the devil.

298
00:18:06,468 --> 00:18:08,353
The devil...

299
00:18:08,388 --> 00:18:09,605
that's good.

300
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,473
That's wonderful.

301
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:13,976
What a dream
for an old devil-

302
00:18:14,011 --> 00:18:16,478
to catch the devil
and lock him up.

303
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:22,734
You don't believe him,
do you?

304
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:24,620
No, of course not.

305
00:18:24,655 --> 00:18:25,871
Then help me.

306
00:18:25,906 --> 00:18:28,373
Look, here, why don't i just
go get the authorities?

307
00:18:28,408 --> 00:18:30,876
It would be
my death warrant.

308
00:18:30,911 --> 00:18:33,996
The authorities would return
and find nothing.

309
00:18:34,031 --> 00:18:35,881
Jerome is mad...

310
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:39,001
but he's shrewd, too.

311
00:18:42,137 --> 00:18:46,508
Brother jerome was fearful
you might lose your way.

312
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:48,393
Come.

313
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:02,157
Why are you locking
the door?

314
00:19:02,192 --> 00:19:04,660
To protect you.

315
00:19:04,695 --> 00:19:06,528
Rest now, mr. Ellington.

316
00:19:06,563 --> 00:19:09,665
Remember you're still
a very sick man.

317
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:05,587
You've come.

318
00:20:05,622 --> 00:20:06,221
Good!

319
00:20:06,256 --> 00:20:08,090
What do you
want me to do?

320
00:20:08,724 --> 00:20:09,975
Lift off
the wooden bolt.

321
00:20:13,729 --> 00:20:15,597
Is this all
that holds you in?

322
00:20:15,632 --> 00:20:16,848
Yes, lift it off.

323
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:19,351
Well, why haven't
you done it yourself?

324
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:21,236
Please, there's
no time for talk.

325
00:20:21,271 --> 00:20:23,739
Mr. Ellington,
in the name of mercy.

326
00:20:23,774 --> 00:20:26,241
If you fail now,
they'll kill both of us.

327
00:20:26,276 --> 00:20:28,744
Don't you understand that?

328
00:20:35,617 --> 00:20:36,868
Hurry, hurry!

329
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:42,257
Stop! Stop!

330
00:20:46,628 --> 00:20:48,380
Put this on- the storm.

331
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:52,077
I'm sorry
for you, my son.

332
00:21:52,112 --> 00:21:53,328
All your life

333
00:21:53,363 --> 00:21:55,197
you will remember
this night

334
00:21:55,232 --> 00:21:58,950
and you'll know,
mr. Ellington

335
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:00,202
whom you have
turned loose

336
00:22:00,237 --> 00:22:02,704
upon the world.

337
00:22:02,739 --> 00:22:05,207
I... i didn't believe you.

338
00:22:05,242 --> 00:22:08,960
I... i saw him and
didn't recognize him.

339
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:12,097
That is
man's weakness

340
00:22:12,132 --> 00:22:14,599
and satan's
strength.

341
00:22:18,353 --> 00:22:20,222
In that moment

342
00:22:20,257 --> 00:22:23,975
i decided to spend the rest
of my life tracking him down

343
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:26,478
to recapture
the evil i'd released

344
00:22:26,513 --> 00:22:29,865
the evil that soon took the
shape of the second world war

345
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:32,984
the korean war,
the hideous new weapons of war.

346
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:37,372
I swore i'd find him again
as brother jerome had done.

347
00:22:37,407 --> 00:22:39,875
It took many years,
but i did it.

348
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:41,743
See, i have him in there now.

349
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:44,246
So you understand now?

350
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,748
You understand why you must not

351
00:22:46,783 --> 00:22:49,251
under any circumstances,
go near that door.

352
00:22:49,286 --> 00:22:51,136
You see
how important it is

353
00:22:51,171 --> 00:22:52,387
that he stay locked up.

354
00:22:52,422 --> 00:22:53,638
Good.

355
00:22:53,673 --> 00:22:58,009
I am sending him back
to brother jerome.

356
00:22:58,044 --> 00:23:02,397
He'll do a bit of howling,
but pay no attention to that.

357
00:23:02,432 --> 00:23:04,266
It's a trick, i know.

358
00:23:04,301 --> 00:23:06,768
Yes, i must go now.

359
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:08,019
I must go, i...

360
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:10,522
i have
preparations to make.

361
00:23:10,557 --> 00:23:14,910
I'll be back
in just a few minutes.

362
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:23,034
Remember... remember...

363
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:25,537
keep that door locked.

364
00:23:50,347 --> 00:23:54,065
You can catch the devil,
but you can't hold him long.

365
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:57,819
Ask brother jerome,
ask david ellington.

366
00:23:57,854 --> 00:24:01,573
They know,
and they'll go on knowing

367
00:24:01,608 --> 00:24:06,578
till the end of their days, and
beyond, in the twilight zone.

368
00:24:11,316 --> 00:24:14,386
Rod serling, creator
of the twilight zone,

369
00:24:14,421 --> 00:24:16,254
will tell you about
next week's story

370
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:18,757
after this word from
our alternate sponsor.

371
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:21,593
And now, mr. Serling.

372
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:30,986
Next week, you'll see
these bandages unwrapped,

373
00:24:31,021 --> 00:24:34,105
and you'll get a good, close
look at the face beneath them.

374
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,357
It's an excursion into the odd

375
00:24:35,392 --> 00:24:37,242
and into the very,
very different.

376
00:24:37,277 --> 00:24:39,110
Our play is called
"the eye of the beholder,"

377
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:40,362
and it comes recommended.

378
00:24:40,397 --> 00:24:42,247
I hope we'll see you next week
onthe twilight zone.

379
00:24:42,864 --> 00:24:44,749
Thank you and good night.

380
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:31,930
Be sure and see
the colgate-palmolive company's

381
00:25:31,965 --> 00:25:34,432
new comedy show,
my sister eileen

382
00:25:34,467 --> 00:25:37,569
wednesday night on many
of these same stations.
