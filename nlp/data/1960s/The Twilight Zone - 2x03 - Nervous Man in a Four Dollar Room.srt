1
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,779
You're traveling
through another dimension-

2
00:00:12,814 --> 00:00:15,915
a dimension not only of sight
and sound, but of mind.

3
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:18,418
A journey into a wondrous land
of imagination.

4
00:00:18,453 --> 00:00:20,787
Next stop, the twilight zone.

5
00:00:40,475 --> 00:00:41,691
Yeah?

6
00:00:41,726 --> 00:00:45,445
Oh, hello, george.
I been expecting your call.

7
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,199
Yeah, i been sitting here
waiting for you.

8
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:52,952
Yeah, it's kind of
a hot night out, ain't it?

9
00:00:52,987 --> 00:00:56,706
Yeah, well, that's what i want
to talk to you about, george.

10
00:00:56,741 --> 00:00:59,826
I was wondering
what you had in mind tonight.

11
00:01:01,077 --> 00:01:02,328
Now... now,
wait a minute, george.

12
00:01:02,363 --> 00:01:04,831
Now, i been sitting here
three, four hours now.

13
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:07,333
I been roasting to death
out there and...

14
00:01:07,368 --> 00:01:09,836
well, i like to go
out of my mind, george...

15
00:01:09,871 --> 00:01:11,087
george?

16
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:16,092
George, look, will you...

17
00:01:16,127 --> 00:01:17,343
george, will...

18
00:01:17,378 --> 00:01:18,595
george, will you let me...

19
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:21,097
will you listen to me, george?
Will you listen to me?

20
00:01:21,132 --> 00:01:23,600
Now, look, i'm not trying
to cop out, george.

21
00:01:23,635 --> 00:01:24,851
I am not trying to cop out.

22
00:01:24,886 --> 00:01:27,987
I'd just like to know what
you had in mind, that's all.

23
00:01:28,022 --> 00:01:30,490
You know i got a tendency
toward nerves, george,

24
00:01:30,525 --> 00:01:33,610
and, well, you can sit in
a hotel room only so long and...

25
00:01:33,645 --> 00:01:36,112
well, it's such a hot night
outside, george.

26
00:01:38,615 --> 00:01:40,500
George, look,
i'm not complaining, george.

27
00:01:40,535 --> 00:01:42,368
You know i'm not complaining,
george.

28
00:01:42,403 --> 00:01:45,505
I'm going to do the job,
whatever it is. You know that.

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,373
You got a number one boy
here, george.

30
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:49,259
I'm going to do the job, but...

31
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:53,630
george?

32
00:01:56,766 --> 00:01:58,635
Hey, george?

33
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:01,771
George?

34
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:16,786
This is mr. Jackie rhoades,
age 34,

35
00:02:16,821 --> 00:02:19,289
and, where some men leave
a mark of their lives

36
00:02:19,324 --> 00:02:21,157
as a record of their
fragmentary existence on earth,

37
00:02:21,192 --> 00:02:25,044
this man leaves a blot-
a dirty, discolored blemish

38
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:28,164
to document a cheap
and undistinguished sojourn

39
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:30,049
amongst his betters.

40
00:02:31,301 --> 00:02:33,803
What you're about
to watch in this room

41
00:02:33,838 --> 00:02:37,557
is a strange mortal combat
between a man and himself.

42
00:02:37,592 --> 00:02:40,059
For, in just a moment,
mr. Jackie rhoades,

43
00:02:40,094 --> 00:02:43,179
whose life has been given over
to fighting adversaries,

44
00:02:43,214 --> 00:02:45,682
will find his most formidable
opponent in a cheap hotel room

45
00:02:45,717 --> 00:02:47,567
that is, in reality,

46
00:02:47,602 --> 00:02:50,069
the outskirts
of the twilight zone.

47
00:03:07,071 --> 00:03:08,288
Yeah?

48
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:11,424
Yeah? Who is it?

49
00:03:14,544 --> 00:03:15,795
George.

50
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:19,549
How are you, george?

51
00:03:19,584 --> 00:03:20,800
I'm in the pink.

52
00:03:20,835 --> 00:03:22,051
How are you, jackie?

53
00:03:22,086 --> 00:03:23,303
Oh, i'm all right, george.
I'm all right.

54
00:03:23,338 --> 00:03:25,805
I'm just a little nervous
about the action tonight.

55
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,439
I was...

56
00:03:30,193 --> 00:03:33,062
it's a gorgeous place
you got here, jackie.

57
00:03:33,097 --> 00:03:36,449
Well, four bucks a night,
you can't go wrong, you know.

58
00:03:36,484 --> 00:03:37,700
Four bucks a night.

59
00:03:37,735 --> 00:03:39,319
No, you can't go wrong,

60
00:03:39,354 --> 00:03:41,204
but you could get
roasted to death,

61
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:43,072
or poisoned by
small creatures.

62
00:03:43,107 --> 00:03:46,209
What about tonight,
george? What's the job?

63
00:03:46,244 --> 00:03:48,077
Does it make
any difference?

64
00:03:48,112 --> 00:03:49,462
Difference?

65
00:03:49,497 --> 00:03:52,582
No, no, no. It don't
make no difference.

66
00:03:52,617 --> 00:03:53,833
I was just wondering.

67
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:56,469
I just wondered what you
had in mind. That was all.

68
00:03:56,504 --> 00:03:58,338
What would you like to do,
jackie?

69
00:03:58,373 --> 00:03:59,589
What's your heart's desire?

70
00:03:59,624 --> 00:04:02,091
Oh, you're kidding me, george.

71
00:04:02,126 --> 00:04:03,343
You're pulling my leg.

72
00:04:03,378 --> 00:04:05,845
I know you.
You're pulling my leg.

73
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:09,599
Well, if it was up to me,
i'd... i'd, uh...

74
00:04:09,634 --> 00:04:10,350
well...

75
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:12,852
if it was up
to me, george,

76
00:04:12,887 --> 00:04:16,606
i'd like some decent
odds for a change.

77
00:04:16,641 --> 00:04:18,107
I don't mind a little
shakedown- a little bunco-

78
00:04:18,741 --> 00:04:20,610
but it's just that i'm
getting all the hard stuff.

79
00:04:20,645 --> 00:04:23,112
You know i almost got
picked up the last two times.

80
00:04:23,147 --> 00:04:24,364
Remember the heist?

81
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:26,866
That kind of stuff
ain't for me, george.

82
00:04:26,901 --> 00:04:30,503
Except they pick me up
one more time, george,

83
00:04:30,538 --> 00:04:33,006
it's three strikes
and out.

84
00:04:34,257 --> 00:04:36,759
I'm long gone,
and for good.

85
00:04:38,628 --> 00:04:41,130
Boy, it's so hot in
here, ain't it, george?

86
00:04:41,165 --> 00:04:42,382
Ain't it hot?

87
00:04:42,417 --> 00:04:44,884
Anybody ever tell you
what you look like?

88
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:48,021
You look like a man trying
to catch a subway at 5:00.

89
00:04:48,056 --> 00:04:50,523
You always look like
somebody's squeezing you

90
00:04:50,558 --> 00:04:51,774
through a door.

91
00:04:51,809 --> 00:04:53,643
What do you do to sleep
at night, jackie,

92
00:04:53,678 --> 00:04:54,894
hide in the locked closet?

93
00:04:54,929 --> 00:04:56,779
Now, look, george,
i'm not knocking you,

94
00:04:56,814 --> 00:04:58,031
and i don't see why

95
00:04:58,066 --> 00:04:59,282
you all the time
gotta knock me.

96
00:04:59,317 --> 00:05:01,150
All i'm asking
from you is...

97
00:05:04,287 --> 00:05:07,407
george, what's the job
i've got to do tonight?

98
00:05:07,442 --> 00:05:09,292
All right, i'll
tell you, jackie.

99
00:05:09,327 --> 00:05:11,794
Tonight, i'm going
to let you be a man.

100
00:05:11,829 --> 00:05:14,297
I'm going to let you
show some muscle

101
00:05:14,332 --> 00:05:14,914
for a change.

102
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:18,668
No shakedowns, no
deliveries to a fence-

103
00:05:18,703 --> 00:05:20,553
nothing little, jackie.

104
00:05:20,588 --> 00:05:22,422
Not tonight.

105
00:05:24,307 --> 00:05:28,678
Tonight, jackie, you're
getting up in the world.

106
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:40,440
Now, there's an old man

107
00:05:40,475 --> 00:05:42,942
runs a little bar
on 38th street

108
00:05:42,977 --> 00:05:44,827
between lexington
and sixth.

109
00:05:44,862 --> 00:05:48,081
He's a feisty old bum.
He's always giving us trouble.

110
00:05:48,116 --> 00:05:50,199
He don't want to pay
off for the jukeboxes,

111
00:05:50,234 --> 00:05:51,451
he don't want to
pay for protection.

112
00:05:51,486 --> 00:05:52,702
We lecture him
all the time,

113
00:05:52,737 --> 00:05:53,953
but he spits
in our eye.

114
00:05:53,988 --> 00:05:55,838
So, tomorrow morning,

115
00:05:55,873 --> 00:05:58,958
they find the old gleep
sprawled across his bar.

116
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:06,599
And then all the rest
swing in line.

117
00:06:06,634 --> 00:06:08,468
Now, that's
simple, jackie.

118
00:06:08,503 --> 00:06:09,719
Even you
can understand.

119
00:06:10,353 --> 00:06:11,721
Kill him?

120
00:06:11,756 --> 00:06:14,223
You want me to kill him?

121
00:06:14,258 --> 00:06:15,725
You're the one, jackie.

122
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:20,363
But, george, i can get sent up
for just carrying that thing.

123
00:06:20,398 --> 00:06:22,865
George,
this one ain't for me.

124
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,234
Listen, you're in hock to
me for your collar buttons,

125
00:06:25,269 --> 00:06:27,120
so don't tell me what's
for you and what isn't.

126
00:06:27,155 --> 00:06:28,988
But i never done anything
like this before, george.

127
00:06:29,023 --> 00:06:30,239
I'm strictly
breaking and entering.

128
00:06:30,274 --> 00:06:31,491
I'm nickels and dimes.

129
00:06:31,526 --> 00:06:32,742
You put me in an alley,
i do a mug job,

130
00:06:32,777 --> 00:06:33,993
but i got to do it
from behind.

131
00:06:34,028 --> 00:06:35,244
I got no guts, george.

132
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:37,130
You know that, george.
I got no guts.

133
00:06:37,165 --> 00:06:39,632
Why don't you get
a couple other guys, huh?

134
00:06:39,667 --> 00:06:40,883
Get a couple
of torpedoes?

135
00:06:40,918 --> 00:06:44,003
'Cause every torpedo i got in
the line is gonna get picked up

136
00:06:44,038 --> 00:06:45,254
the minute they find
that old gleep.

137
00:06:45,289 --> 00:06:47,140
Because you're not
going to get picked up

138
00:06:47,175 --> 00:06:49,642
because you're nickel-and-dime
and everybody knows it.

139
00:06:49,677 --> 00:06:50,893
You never did
a job like this

140
00:06:50,928 --> 00:06:52,762
because you never could
do a job like this,

141
00:06:52,797 --> 00:06:54,647
and that's why you're
gonna do this one, jackie.

142
00:06:54,682 --> 00:06:57,150
And that's how you're
going to get away with it.

143
00:06:57,185 --> 00:06:59,018
But, george,
i got no guts.

144
00:06:59,053 --> 00:07:00,903
Get guts, jackie! I
don't care where from.

145
00:07:00,938 --> 00:07:03,406
You get them under the bed,
you buy them from a vendor,

146
00:07:03,441 --> 00:07:04,657
you grow them in a pot.

147
00:07:04,692 --> 00:07:05,908
I don't care,
but you get them,

148
00:07:05,943 --> 00:07:08,411
and you do the job.

149
00:07:08,446 --> 00:07:10,913
Now, he closes
that bar at 2:00.

150
00:07:10,948 --> 00:07:14,033
You be there when
he's about to lock up,

151
00:07:14,068 --> 00:07:15,284
and you do it.

152
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:20,923
And i'll be back
here at 2:30, jackie.

153
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:22,792
And if i find out

154
00:07:22,827 --> 00:07:24,677
that you welshed
on me, jackie-

155
00:07:25,294 --> 00:07:26,546
that you chickened out-

156
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,431
you're dead.

157
00:07:33,436 --> 00:07:35,938
Hey... george.

158
00:07:35,973 --> 00:07:37,807
Hey, george!

159
00:07:37,842 --> 00:07:39,692
George!

160
00:07:39,727 --> 00:07:42,195
George! Please, george!

161
00:08:32,862 --> 00:08:34,747
Look at you.

162
00:08:35,364 --> 00:08:37,250
Look at you. What's the beef?

163
00:08:37,285 --> 00:08:39,118
Go out and get rid
of an old man.

164
00:08:39,153 --> 00:08:41,003
Some dopey old man.

165
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:43,506
He's going to be 90 years old,
maybe 100 years.

166
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:46,626
That's what he is-
some dopey old man- a gleep.

167
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:50,379
Hey, that's what george
called him- a gleep.

168
00:08:50,414 --> 00:08:52,265
That's what
george called him- a gleep.

169
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:59,138
Boy, i wish i could trade you,
and i could use another model.

170
00:09:02,892 --> 00:09:04,777
Aw, it's not your fault.

171
00:09:04,812 --> 00:09:06,028
It's not my fault.

172
00:09:06,063 --> 00:09:07,897
It's just the breaks,
that's all.

173
00:09:07,932 --> 00:09:09,782
Why am i scared?

174
00:09:09,817 --> 00:09:12,285
Why am i, all the time, scared?

175
00:09:17,907 --> 00:09:19,792
I'm all the time scared.

176
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:28,301
Oh, man, i've had a long haul.

177
00:09:28,336 --> 00:09:30,169
How many nights in a tank?

178
00:09:30,204 --> 00:09:32,672
How many nights in stir?

179
00:09:32,707 --> 00:09:35,808
How many nights in a cheap,
lousy little room like this?

180
00:09:35,843 --> 00:09:38,311
Four bucks a night
to roast to death.

181
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,931
Nail biter.

182
00:09:41,966 --> 00:09:44,433
Scared, nervous
little nail biter.

183
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:49,438
Hey, george! You ain't no judge
of people, george!

184
00:09:49,473 --> 00:09:51,324
You ought to peel cantaloupes!

185
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:53,192
You ought to stick
with apples and oranges, george,

186
00:09:53,227 --> 00:09:55,077
because you ain't no judge
of people!

187
00:09:55,112 --> 00:09:56,946
Jackie rhoades the killer!

188
00:09:59,483 --> 00:10:02,585
Hey, jackie rhoades, killer!

189
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:11,344
I know you, jackie rhoades.
You ain't no killer.

190
00:10:11,379 --> 00:10:13,846
But you got to kill tonight.

191
00:10:13,881 --> 00:10:15,097
Kill or be killed.

192
00:10:15,132 --> 00:10:18,217
So you do the job
and you're dead anyway,

193
00:10:18,252 --> 00:10:21,971
because you know you never
got away with anything.

194
00:10:22,006 --> 00:10:25,725
You live till tomorrow,
and that's how it ends.

195
00:10:30,112 --> 00:10:32,615
Boy, i wish
i could trade you in.

196
00:10:40,122 --> 00:10:41,374
No matches.

197
00:10:41,991 --> 00:10:44,493
Cigarettes and no matches,
that's me all over.

198
00:10:44,528 --> 00:10:47,630
That's jackie rhoades,
the halfway boy.

199
00:10:47,665 --> 00:10:50,132
That's the story of my life.

200
00:10:59,293 --> 00:11:00,509
Hello, jackie.

201
00:11:03,012 --> 00:11:05,514
Come back here!

202
00:11:05,549 --> 00:11:07,266
You're not running out
on me this time!

203
00:11:09,437 --> 00:11:11,904
You talking to me?

204
00:11:17,526 --> 00:11:18,778
You talking to me?

205
00:11:18,813 --> 00:11:21,280
Who you...?
Yeah, sure you are.

206
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:23,783
Now me and the mirror,
we're having a talk.

207
00:11:23,818 --> 00:11:25,034
I've had it, huh?

208
00:11:25,069 --> 00:11:26,919
All my marbles are gone.

209
00:11:26,954 --> 00:11:28,170
This is how it happens.

210
00:11:28,205 --> 00:11:28,788
This...

211
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:31,290
yeah, this is
how it happens,

212
00:11:31,325 --> 00:11:33,175
but you ain't lost
your marbles yet,

213
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:35,678
and i mean to see
that you keep them.

214
00:11:35,713 --> 00:11:37,546
Who are you?

215
00:11:37,581 --> 00:11:40,049
I'm you, jackie,
and you're me.

216
00:11:40,084 --> 00:11:41,300
How's that?

217
00:11:41,335 --> 00:11:43,185
You're me
and i'm you?

218
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,054
Oh, this is crazy.

219
00:11:45,089 --> 00:11:46,939
This is really crazy.

220
00:11:46,974 --> 00:11:48,808
This is crazy! Crazy!

221
00:11:50,059 --> 00:11:52,561
Jackie, i'm part
of you, jackie.

222
00:11:52,596 --> 00:11:53,813
Another part of you.

223
00:11:53,848 --> 00:11:56,315
Don't you even
remember me?

224
00:11:56,350 --> 00:12:00,069
You used to know me
a long time ago, jackie.

225
00:12:00,104 --> 00:12:03,205
A very long time ago,
you were up for grabs.

226
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,708
You could have gone
one way or the other.

227
00:12:05,743 --> 00:12:08,210
You could have gone
my way or your way.

228
00:12:08,245 --> 00:12:09,462
You went your way.

229
00:12:09,497 --> 00:12:11,964
You know what
that means, jackie?

230
00:12:11,999 --> 00:12:13,833
No, i don't.

231
00:12:13,868 --> 00:12:16,335
A cheap, weak, scared

232
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:18,838
half vulture,
all mouse.

233
00:12:18,873 --> 00:12:21,340
That's what
you are, jackie.

234
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,225
All right,
so knock me.

235
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:26,345
So i'm this and i'm that,
and i'm this and i'm that.

236
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,596
Look, here, buddy,

237
00:12:27,631 --> 00:12:28,230
whatever i am,

238
00:12:28,265 --> 00:12:30,733
i got flesh and bones
and i breathe.

239
00:12:30,768 --> 00:12:33,235
And. In just a couple
of hours from now,

240
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:35,738
i'm going to put
the finger on somebody!

241
00:12:35,773 --> 00:12:36,989
So, ha-ha!

242
00:12:37,024 --> 00:12:38,858
What do you do
for a living, huh?

243
00:12:38,893 --> 00:12:41,360
Haunt people in mirrors, huh?

244
00:12:41,395 --> 00:12:43,245
Listen to me, boy. Listen to me.

245
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:46,365
I'm having an argument
with a big piece of glass.

246
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,868
Listen, glass, i'm leaving.

247
00:12:48,903 --> 00:12:50,753
See, i'm pulling out.

248
00:12:50,788 --> 00:12:51,370
I'm pulling out.

249
00:12:51,405 --> 00:12:53,255
I've had it with you.

250
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:53,873
I'm a mouse, huh?

251
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:55,758
Well, you're nothing!

252
00:12:55,793 --> 00:12:56,759
Jackie...

253
00:13:06,804 --> 00:13:08,771
jackie.

254
00:13:15,644 --> 00:13:17,530
Now, jackie...

255
00:13:25,154 --> 00:13:27,656
jackie, don't pass out
on me now.

256
00:13:27,691 --> 00:13:30,793
Jackie, we've got
a big night ahead of us.

257
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:57,853
Where you going?

258
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:02,241
What's it to you?

259
00:14:02,276 --> 00:14:03,492
Everything.

260
00:14:03,527 --> 00:14:05,995
Everything you do
is everything to me.

261
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:07,246
Can't you get that?

262
00:14:07,281 --> 00:14:09,114
Oh, yeah, yeah,
now i get it.

263
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:11,617
I'm talking to myself.

264
00:14:11,652 --> 00:14:14,119
That's just who
you are talking to-

265
00:14:14,154 --> 00:14:16,005
part of yourself- the part
you never let come out.

266
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,256
Now, listen, buddy.

267
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:19,124
You got no invitation
to come out now,

268
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:22,261
so you can go right back
where you came from.

269
00:14:22,296 --> 00:14:23,512
Who needs you?

270
00:14:23,547 --> 00:14:25,381
You do.
You've always needed me.

271
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:28,384
Wait a minute.

272
00:14:28,419 --> 00:14:31,520
Now i get it.

273
00:14:31,555 --> 00:14:32,137
Yeah, now i get it.

274
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:33,389
You're chicken, too.

275
00:14:33,424 --> 00:14:35,274
You're scared
i'll get caught

276
00:14:35,309 --> 00:14:36,525
same as me.

277
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,394
You're scared
this is the last job,

278
00:14:39,028 --> 00:14:41,530
so you make a big noise
like a conscience

279
00:14:41,565 --> 00:14:42,781
so the big man don't say

280
00:14:42,816 --> 00:14:44,650
you been goofing off
all my life.

281
00:14:44,685 --> 00:14:47,152
It means more than
that to me, jackie.

282
00:14:47,187 --> 00:14:49,038
You think i can
keep quiet now

283
00:14:49,073 --> 00:14:51,540
while you go out and
get us both killed?

284
00:14:51,575 --> 00:14:52,791
Killed?

285
00:14:52,826 --> 00:14:54,043
That's right.
You said so yourself-

286
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:56,545
you never got away
with nothing,

287
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:59,048
and you know you won't
get away with this.

288
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:00,916
And i got
a right to live.

289
00:15:00,951 --> 00:15:03,419
You had the same chances
as me- no chance.

290
00:15:04,053 --> 00:15:05,304
So, if i'm wrong
and you're right,

291
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:07,172
then how come every move
i made turned out wrong?

292
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:09,058
How about that, huh?

293
00:15:09,093 --> 00:15:10,926
Because, every time
i tried to talk to you,

294
00:15:10,961 --> 00:15:12,177
you listened
to somebody else.

295
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:13,429
That was your mistake.

296
00:15:13,464 --> 00:15:16,565
Okay, wise guy,
you know so much,

297
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,068
then how come you don't
know the big thing?

298
00:15:19,103 --> 00:15:20,319
Big thing?

299
00:15:20,354 --> 00:15:22,187
Don't you ever
look in a mirror?

300
00:15:22,222 --> 00:15:24,690
I was a runt.
I was a skinny little runt.

301
00:15:24,725 --> 00:15:26,575
When you want to join
a street gang,

302
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:28,444
you got to go
along with them.

303
00:15:28,479 --> 00:15:30,329
You back down,
they give you business.

304
00:15:30,364 --> 00:15:32,197
They call you a chicken,

305
00:15:32,232 --> 00:15:33,449
and yell,
"you ain't got it!"

306
00:15:33,484 --> 00:15:35,951
Yeah, you went
along with them.

307
00:15:35,986 --> 00:15:38,454
And you made me
go along, too.

308
00:15:38,489 --> 00:15:41,590
The first time, we
were ten years old.

309
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:42,841
Remember that?

310
00:15:42,876 --> 00:15:44,710
The class picnic?

311
00:15:44,745 --> 00:15:46,595
The teacher had a locket,
and the catch broke,

312
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:47,846
and she laid it down,

313
00:15:47,881 --> 00:15:49,715
and some of the big kids
dared you to swipe it.

314
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,600
Well, i didn't
want to swipe it.

315
00:15:51,635 --> 00:15:52,851
I told you,
i was a runt.

316
00:15:52,886 --> 00:15:54,103
They dared me.

317
00:15:54,138 --> 00:15:55,971
And, a year later,
they dared you

318
00:15:56,006 --> 00:15:57,856
to break into that
grocery store with them,

319
00:15:57,891 --> 00:15:59,108
and you went along,

320
00:15:59,143 --> 00:16:00,976
and you dragged
me along, too,

321
00:16:01,011 --> 00:16:02,227
and we got caught.

322
00:16:02,262 --> 00:16:04,730
And you spent
the next 11 months

323
00:16:04,765 --> 00:16:06,615
in reform school,
and so did i.

324
00:16:08,484 --> 00:16:10,369
What did that
prove, jackie?

325
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:14,740
Yak, yak, yak, yak.
Talk my ear off.

326
00:16:14,775 --> 00:16:16,375
No wonder
i cut you down.

327
00:16:16,992 --> 00:16:19,495
You're walking on your
lower lip all the time.

328
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:21,997
What do you want from me anyway?

329
00:16:22,032 --> 00:16:23,882
You know what i want.

330
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,134
No, i don't

331
00:16:25,169 --> 00:16:27,002
but i'll tell you
what i do know-

332
00:16:27,037 --> 00:16:28,253
i got to go out
and do a job.

333
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:30,756
I got to knock off an
old gleep on 38th street.

334
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:32,641
And, if i don't do it
by 2:00 a.m.,

335
00:16:32,676 --> 00:16:33,892
you can take
what's left of me

336
00:16:33,927 --> 00:16:35,761
and scrape it off
that mirror with a spoon!

337
00:16:35,796 --> 00:16:37,646
I ain't got much time.
I got to go now.

338
00:16:37,681 --> 00:16:40,149
You got less time
than you think.

339
00:16:40,184 --> 00:16:42,651
But you never had time.
You didn't have time

340
00:16:42,686 --> 00:16:44,520
when that parole officer
tried to help you.

341
00:16:44,555 --> 00:16:46,155
You could have
listened to him,

342
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:48,023
but you joined another gang.

343
00:16:48,058 --> 00:16:50,526
Six months later,
you were in jail again,

344
00:16:50,561 --> 00:16:52,411
and that parole officer
couldn't help you

345
00:16:52,446 --> 00:16:55,030
any more than janey reardon could.

346
00:16:55,664 --> 00:16:57,533
Janey reardon.

347
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:01,286
Janey reardon.

348
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,794
Janey reardon.

349
00:17:12,548 --> 00:17:14,433
She was a nice kid.

350
00:17:14,468 --> 00:17:16,301
She was a
beautiful woman.

351
00:17:16,336 --> 00:17:18,187
She tried to
set you straight.

352
00:17:18,222 --> 00:17:20,055
I loved her, jackie.

353
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:21,940
I loved janey reardon.

354
00:17:21,975 --> 00:17:23,058
You loved her?

355
00:17:23,093 --> 00:17:24,309
You got a nerve.

356
00:17:24,344 --> 00:17:26,195
How could you love anybody?

357
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:28,063
You're just a piece of glass.

358
00:17:28,098 --> 00:17:30,949
I could love, jackie.

359
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:34,703
I could love.

360
00:17:34,738 --> 00:17:36,572
I needed her, jackie.

361
00:17:36,607 --> 00:17:37,206
So did you.

362
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:40,325
I tried to tell you
how much we needed her,

363
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,211
but you graduated
from the gang

364
00:17:42,246 --> 00:17:44,079
into the shakedown rackets.

365
00:17:44,114 --> 00:17:45,964
Big shot, huh?

366
00:17:45,999 --> 00:17:47,833
Two years we
spent in the pen

367
00:17:47,868 --> 00:17:49,084
on that one.

368
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:50,335
And, when
we got out,

369
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:52,838
janey reardon
had gotten married

370
00:17:52,873 --> 00:17:54,089
and moved away.

371
00:17:54,124 --> 00:17:55,974
She walked out of
your life, jackie.

372
00:17:56,009 --> 00:17:57,226
Out ofourlife!

373
00:17:59,728 --> 00:18:00,979
You cheated me out of her.

374
00:18:01,014 --> 00:18:03,482
Don't tell me your troubles.
It's nothing to me.

375
00:18:03,517 --> 00:18:04,733
Dames i can take or leave alone.

376
00:18:04,768 --> 00:18:06,602
Dames you can take
or leave, huh?

377
00:18:06,637 --> 00:18:08,487
That's a statement
for the press.

378
00:18:08,522 --> 00:18:10,989
You wouldn't want to have
a girl, would you, jackie?

379
00:18:11,607 --> 00:18:12,858
Somebody sweet and pretty.

380
00:18:12,893 --> 00:18:14,743
Somebody who would love you.

381
00:18:14,778 --> 00:18:16,612
Somebody who'd be kind
and gentle with you.

382
00:18:16,647 --> 00:18:18,497
You don't need that,
do you, jackie?

383
00:18:18,532 --> 00:18:20,999
Why don't you cut it out?

384
00:18:21,034 --> 00:18:22,501
Will you do that?

385
00:18:22,536 --> 00:18:24,369
Will you knock it off?

386
00:18:25,621 --> 00:18:27,506
What do you want from me anyway?

387
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:30,008
I'm asking you,
what do you want from me?

388
00:18:30,043 --> 00:18:31,877
I'm still waiting to hear.

389
00:18:31,912 --> 00:18:33,128
What do you want?

390
00:18:33,163 --> 00:18:34,379
I want to take over,
jackie.

391
00:18:34,414 --> 00:18:35,631
I want to call the shots.

392
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:37,516
I want you to let me out.

393
00:18:37,551 --> 00:18:38,767
I want a chance to live.

394
00:18:38,802 --> 00:18:40,636
I want to live
with all the guts

395
00:18:40,671 --> 00:18:41,887
and goodness
you left behind.

396
00:18:41,922 --> 00:18:43,772
I want to live
the dreams you dreamed

397
00:18:43,807 --> 00:18:45,641
and never had
the guts to live.

398
00:18:45,676 --> 00:18:47,526
Fat chance, buster.
Big fat chance.

399
00:18:47,561 --> 00:18:49,394
I'm me and
you're you!

400
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:50,896
And that's no statement
for the press.

401
00:18:50,931 --> 00:18:52,147
That's the goods.

402
00:18:52,182 --> 00:18:54,650
I'm going out
and knock me off an old man now,

403
00:18:54,685 --> 00:18:55,901
and i'm going to cut me

404
00:18:55,936 --> 00:18:57,152
a nice slice of cabbage
for my troubles.

405
00:18:57,187 --> 00:18:59,037
I'm calling the shots!

406
00:18:59,072 --> 00:19:00,289
And neither you or anybody else

407
00:19:00,324 --> 00:19:01,540
is telling jackie rhoades
what to do!

408
00:19:01,575 --> 00:19:02,791
Neither you or anybody else!

409
00:19:04,077 --> 00:19:05,294
Yeah?

410
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:07,162
Oh... yeah, george.

411
00:19:07,197 --> 00:19:09,665
Uh... george, i'm doing
what you told me, george.

412
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,550
I'm just on my way out now.

413
00:19:11,585 --> 00:19:14,052
Yeah, george. I'm just leaving.

414
00:19:14,087 --> 00:19:15,304
Yeah. Honest, george. Honest.

415
00:19:15,339 --> 00:19:17,806
I'm... i'm... i'm on my way now.

416
00:19:17,841 --> 00:19:19,675
Yeah. Yeah, i'm... i'm...

417
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:20,926
i'm going to leave right now,
george.

418
00:19:20,961 --> 00:19:23,428
I'll meet you back here
at 2:30, okay?

419
00:19:23,463 --> 00:19:25,931
Yeah. I'll meet you
right back here, george.

420
00:19:25,966 --> 00:19:27,182
Okay.

421
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:45,334
Hey!

422
00:19:45,369 --> 00:19:47,202
Hey, there.

423
00:19:47,237 --> 00:19:49,705
Hey, where are you?

424
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,590
Hey, glass, come on out here.

425
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:53,458
Come on. Do your job now.

426
00:19:53,493 --> 00:19:57,212
Hey, come on, i want to see
how i look, glass. Come on.

427
00:19:57,247 --> 00:19:59,348
It don't make any
difference, jackie,

428
00:19:59,383 --> 00:20:01,216
because you're
not going anywhere.

429
00:20:01,251 --> 00:20:03,719
You go out that door,
you're finished.

430
00:20:03,754 --> 00:20:04,970
We're both finished.

431
00:20:05,005 --> 00:20:06,855
That's the door
to nowhere.

432
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:08,724
Jackie, jackie,
let me out!

433
00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:09,975
I want to take over.

434
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:11,226
I got to take over!

435
00:20:11,261 --> 00:20:13,729
I want a decent job,
some friends.

436
00:20:13,764 --> 00:20:15,614
I got a job.
I got friends.

437
00:20:15,649 --> 00:20:16,365
I got everything i want.

438
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,867
You got nothing. You got
nothing but a pain inside.

439
00:20:18,902 --> 00:20:21,370
You got no friends. You got
nothing! You are nothing!

440
00:20:21,405 --> 00:20:23,238
It's time to be something.

441
00:20:23,273 --> 00:20:24,489
Jackie, let me out.

442
00:20:24,524 --> 00:20:26,375
Let me take over, jackie.

443
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:28,243
This is your last chance.

444
00:20:28,278 --> 00:20:31,880
All right, i'll let you
out of there.

445
00:20:31,915 --> 00:20:35,000
Come on out of there, wise guy.

446
00:20:35,035 --> 00:20:36,251
Come on out!

447
00:20:41,256 --> 00:20:45,644
What a phony.

448
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,512
You're a liar!

449
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:15,040
Get up, little man.

450
00:21:15,075 --> 00:21:20,045
I'm going to take your
skin off foot by foot.

451
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:25,050
Nobody went to the old
man's bar tonight, jackie.

452
00:21:25,085 --> 00:21:26,935
Nobody at all.

453
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:31,306
At last reports, he was
in excellent health...

454
00:21:31,341 --> 00:21:32,557
thanks to you.

455
00:21:32,592 --> 00:21:36,311
Thanks to you, you
raunchy little welsher.

456
00:21:36,346 --> 00:21:40,565
Well, what do you got to say
for yourself, crumb, huh?

457
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,951
What have you got
to say for yourself?

458
00:21:50,459 --> 00:21:52,961
What have i got to say
for myself, george?

459
00:21:52,996 --> 00:21:54,830
Not much.

460
00:21:54,865 --> 00:21:57,332
I resign.

461
00:21:57,367 --> 00:22:01,086
That's it,
george.

462
00:22:01,121 --> 00:22:02,971
I resign.

463
00:22:03,006 --> 00:22:04,840
You what?

464
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:07,342
I resign.

465
00:22:07,377 --> 00:22:09,094
You can have
your gun back,

466
00:22:09,129 --> 00:22:10,979
plus the following.

467
00:22:28,997 --> 00:22:30,866
Move out, george.

468
00:22:36,505 --> 00:22:39,007
And don't ever come back...

469
00:22:39,042 --> 00:22:40,258
for anything.

470
00:22:57,776 --> 00:23:00,278
Room clerk, this is jackie...

471
00:23:00,313 --> 00:23:02,781
this is john rhoades, room 14.

472
00:23:02,816 --> 00:23:04,032
I'm checking out.

473
00:23:04,067 --> 00:23:07,152
No, i'm not coming back.

474
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:10,288
No, as a matter of fact,
nothing's all right.

475
00:23:10,323 --> 00:23:13,408
The room's too hot,
too small and too dirty.

476
00:23:13,443 --> 00:23:16,545
It's just the place for bums,
but not for me.

477
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:24,803
Hey, hey,
what's to do now?

478
00:23:24,838 --> 00:23:26,671
What's to do now?

479
00:23:26,706 --> 00:23:29,174
Now we go look
for a job.

480
00:23:29,209 --> 00:23:32,310
Now maybe
we get married.

481
00:23:32,345 --> 00:23:35,430
Now maybe we stop
biting our nails.

482
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:51,947
Exit mr. John rhoades, formerly
a reflection in a mirror,

483
00:23:51,982 --> 00:23:55,083
a fragment
of someone else's conscience,

484
00:23:55,118 --> 00:23:56,952
a wishful thinker
made out of glass,

485
00:23:56,987 --> 00:23:58,837
but now made out of flesh,

486
00:23:58,872 --> 00:24:01,339
and on his way
to join the company of men.

487
00:24:01,374 --> 00:24:04,459
Mr. John rhoades,
with one foot through the door

488
00:24:04,494 --> 00:24:06,962
and one foot out
of the twilight zone.

489
00:24:11,082 --> 00:24:14,186
Rod serling
the creator oftwilight zone,

490
00:24:14,221 --> 00:24:16,054
will tell you
about next week's story

491
00:24:16,089 --> 00:24:19,424
after this word
from our alternate sponsor.

492
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:21,977
And now, mr. Serling.

493
00:24:22,012 --> 00:24:23,862
These are familiar items,
i'm sure-

494
00:24:23,897 --> 00:24:26,982
television set, electric razor,
clock, typewriter-

495
00:24:27,017 --> 00:24:28,867
the normal,
everyday accoutrements

496
00:24:28,902 --> 00:24:31,369
that are part and parcel
of 20th century progress.

497
00:24:31,404 --> 00:24:33,872
But, next week, you'll see them
under different circumstances,

498
00:24:34,489 --> 00:24:36,374
and in a totally
dissimilar guise.

499
00:24:36,409 --> 00:24:39,494
They'll be machines,
but they'll also be monsters.

500
00:24:39,529 --> 00:24:41,997
Our story is called
a thing about machines,

501
00:24:42,032 --> 00:24:43,882
and it will be here
waiting for you

502
00:24:43,917 --> 00:24:45,133
in the twilight zone.

503
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:31,830
Seethe new andy griffith show
each week

504
00:25:31,865 --> 00:25:33,715
over most of these stations.

505
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:35,584
