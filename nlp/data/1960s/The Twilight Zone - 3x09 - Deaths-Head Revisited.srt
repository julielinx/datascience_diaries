1
00:00:11,378 --> 00:00:13,880
You're traveling
through another dimension-

2
00:00:13,915 --> 00:00:17,017
a dimension not only of sight
and sound, but of mind,

3
00:00:17,052 --> 00:00:18,885
a journey into a wondrous land

4
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,388
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

5
00:00:21,423 --> 00:00:23,890
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

6
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,161
Yes, sir.

7
00:00:45,196 --> 00:00:47,047
I've just arrived in town.

8
00:00:47,082 --> 00:00:48,915
Do you have
accommodations here?

9
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:50,800
I can give you
a lovely front room

10
00:00:50,835 --> 00:00:52,052
overlooking
the square.

11
00:00:52,087 --> 00:00:53,920
Would you care
to see it?

12
00:00:53,955 --> 00:00:56,423
I am sure it will
be satisfactory.

13
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,815
Yes? Anything wrong?

14
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:07,067
No, sir.

15
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,188
Mr. Schmidt?

16
00:01:12,223 --> 00:01:13,073
That's what i've written.

17
00:01:13,108 --> 00:01:14,324
Of course, sir.

18
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:14,691
Of course, what?

19
00:01:14,726 --> 00:01:17,327
I... i just meant, sir...

20
00:01:17,362 --> 00:01:18,945
i just wondered...

21
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:20,196
it's just that...

22
00:01:20,231 --> 00:01:23,333
what?
You just wondered what?

23
00:01:23,368 --> 00:01:27,087
It's just that...
you remind me

24
00:01:27,122 --> 00:01:28,588
of someone.
Oh?

25
00:01:28,623 --> 00:01:29,839
During the war.

26
00:01:29,874 --> 00:01:31,708
Go on.

27
00:01:31,743 --> 00:01:36,096
There were... there were
s.s. Stationed here.

28
00:01:36,131 --> 00:01:37,964
They used to come to the inn
very often.

29
00:01:37,999 --> 00:01:41,101
I spent the war years
on the russian front-

30
00:01:41,136 --> 00:01:42,969
the panzer division.

31
00:01:43,004 --> 00:01:45,855
Of course.

32
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:51,111
Was it a prison or
something you had here?

33
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:54,230
Something of
the sort, sir.

34
00:01:54,265 --> 00:01:56,232
Was it a prison?

35
00:01:56,267 --> 00:01:57,984
A camp, sir.

36
00:01:58,019 --> 00:01:58,868
How's that?

37
00:01:58,903 --> 00:02:02,739
A camp, mr. Schmidt.

38
00:02:02,774 --> 00:02:05,241
A concentration camp.

39
00:02:06,242 --> 00:02:09,379
A concentration camp.

40
00:02:09,414 --> 00:02:10,630
Really?

41
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:13,750
Now, that's odd.

42
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,637
For the life of me,
i can't seem to recall

43
00:02:17,672 --> 00:02:20,140
the name of this town.

44
00:02:20,175 --> 00:02:22,008
Sir?

45
00:02:22,043 --> 00:02:23,259
The name of this town!

46
00:02:27,263 --> 00:02:29,766
What is the name of this town?

47
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:34,154
Dachau, sir.

48
00:02:34,189 --> 00:02:36,656
Dachau.

49
00:02:36,691 --> 00:02:39,159
Of course, dachau.

50
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:42,912
The camp, it's that group
of buildings

51
00:02:42,947 --> 00:02:44,164
up on the hill, isn't it?

52
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:46,032
It is, indeed.

53
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:51,037
But most of us would like it
burned to the ground.

54
00:02:57,043 --> 00:03:00,797
Mr. Schmidt, recently arrived
in a small bavarian village

55
00:03:00,832 --> 00:03:03,933
which lies eight miles
northwest of munich-

56
00:03:03,968 --> 00:03:06,436
a picturesque, delightful
little spot

57
00:03:06,471 --> 00:03:08,304
one time known for its scenery,

58
00:03:08,339 --> 00:03:10,807
but more recently
related to other events

59
00:03:10,842 --> 00:03:15,195
having to do with some of the
less positive pursuits of man:

60
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:17,697
Human slaughter, torture,
misery and anguish.

61
00:03:17,732 --> 00:03:20,200
Mr. Schmidt,
as we will soon perceive,

62
00:03:20,235 --> 00:03:23,953
has a vested interest in the
ruins of a concentration camp,

63
00:03:23,988 --> 00:03:27,073
for once, some 17 years ago,
his name was gunther lutze.

64
00:03:27,108 --> 00:03:29,576
He held the rank
of a captain in the ss.

65
00:03:29,611 --> 00:03:32,712
He was a black-uniformed,
strutting animal

66
00:03:32,747 --> 00:03:35,215
whose function in life
was to give pain,

67
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,083
and like his colleagues
of the time

68
00:03:37,118 --> 00:03:38,968
he shared the one affliction

69
00:03:39,003 --> 00:03:42,088
most common amongst
that breed known as nazis:

70
00:03:42,123 --> 00:03:43,973
He walked the earth
without a heart.

71
00:03:44,008 --> 00:03:46,476
And now
former s.s. Captain lutze

72
00:03:46,511 --> 00:03:48,978
will revisit his old haunts,
satisfied perhaps

73
00:03:49,013 --> 00:03:52,098
that all that is awaiting him
in the ruins on the hill

74
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:53,983
is an element of nostalgia.

75
00:03:54,018 --> 00:03:56,486
What he does not know,
of course,

76
00:03:56,521 --> 00:04:00,240
is that a place like dachau
cannot exist only in bavaria.

77
00:04:00,275 --> 00:04:02,108
By its nature,
by its very nature,

78
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:07,864
it must be one of the populated
areas of the twilight zone.

79
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,862
All right, pigs, up!

80
00:05:29,897 --> 00:05:31,748
Time to greet
the morning.

81
00:05:31,783 --> 00:05:33,616
On your feet, filth!

82
00:05:33,651 --> 00:05:34,867
We have a nice day

83
00:05:34,902 --> 00:05:35,752
ahead of us.

84
00:05:35,787 --> 00:05:37,003
It's snowing.

85
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,123
Temperature's are
slightly below zero.

86
00:05:40,158 --> 00:05:42,625
You will all assemble
in the square.

87
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,761
And dress.

88
00:05:44,796 --> 00:05:47,880
We'll do some
exercises.

89
00:05:47,915 --> 00:05:55,271
I and you!

90
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:26,919
Detention...

91
00:06:26,954 --> 00:06:28,671
yes, i remember you.

92
00:06:28,706 --> 00:06:31,808
We had some good times
in this building.

93
00:06:33,711 --> 00:06:35,561
Such good times.

94
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,589
You'd like
water, number...

95
00:07:03,624 --> 00:07:05,958
23575?

96
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:09,212
Is that what you'd like?
You'd like water?

97
00:07:09,247 --> 00:07:11,848
But why should you care?

98
00:07:11,883 --> 00:07:15,601
It's only been five days
since you've been fed.

99
00:07:15,636 --> 00:07:19,222
Five little days!

100
00:07:49,752 --> 00:07:52,889
Good afternoon, captain,
and welcome back.

101
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,391
We've been waiting.

102
00:08:06,769 --> 00:08:08,771
That's right, captain.

103
00:08:08,806 --> 00:08:11,274
We've been waiting
for a long time.

104
00:08:11,309 --> 00:08:17,280
You're... you're becker...
alfred becker.

105
00:08:17,315 --> 00:08:18,531
I remember you.

106
00:08:18,566 --> 00:08:21,033
And well you should.

107
00:08:21,068 --> 00:08:24,170
How well you should,
captain lutze.

108
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,218
You don't look
so bad, becker.

109
00:08:39,253 --> 00:08:42,355
No, as a matter of fact,
you look quite well.

110
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:45,474
You don't seem to
have changed at all.

111
00:08:45,509 --> 00:08:48,611
That's it...
you haven't changed.

112
00:08:48,646 --> 00:08:50,479
Why, it's been...

113
00:08:50,514 --> 00:08:52,365
it's been
15 or 16 years.

114
00:08:52,982 --> 00:08:54,367
It's been 17 years, captain,

115
00:08:54,402 --> 00:08:56,869
since you and i
last saw each other.

116
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,989
Really?

117
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:04,877
You're the caretaker
around here?

118
00:09:04,912 --> 00:09:07,997
In a manner
of speaking.

119
00:09:08,032 --> 00:09:11,751
It's odd how
paths cross, and...

120
00:09:13,002 --> 00:09:14,754
we meet again

121
00:09:14,789 --> 00:09:17,256
under somewhat
happier circumstances.

122
00:09:21,045 --> 00:09:23,512
What was that?

123
00:09:23,547 --> 00:09:24,764
It sounded like...

124
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:26,399
the wind, captain?

125
00:09:26,434 --> 00:09:27,900
Wind?

126
00:09:27,935 --> 00:09:29,769
Perhaps.

127
00:09:29,804 --> 00:09:32,271
Perhaps it was the wind, eh?

128
00:09:32,306 --> 00:09:35,157
Of course.

129
00:09:37,026 --> 00:09:39,528
Of course it was the wind.

130
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,282
It was not the wind.

131
00:09:43,317 --> 00:09:47,036
It was...

132
00:09:47,071 --> 00:09:48,287
it was what,
captain?

133
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:51,924
Stop calling me captain!

134
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:54,427
I'm not a soldier anymore.

135
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:57,546
You never were
a soldier.

136
00:09:57,581 --> 00:09:58,798
The uniform
you wore

137
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,049
cannot be stripped off.

138
00:10:00,084 --> 00:10:03,185
It was part of you, part of
your flesh, part of your body.

139
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,437
It was a piece of your mind.

140
00:10:04,472 --> 00:10:08,190
A tattoo,
captain.

141
00:10:08,225 --> 00:10:10,559
A skull and
crossbones

142
00:10:10,594 --> 00:10:13,062
burned into
your soul.

143
00:10:13,097 --> 00:10:14,313
I was a soldier, becker.

144
00:10:14,348 --> 00:10:16,816
No, captain, you were a sadist.

145
00:10:16,851 --> 00:10:19,318
You were a monster
who derived pleasure

146
00:10:19,353 --> 00:10:20,569
from
giving pain.

147
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,073
Listen to me, becker.

148
00:10:24,108 --> 00:10:25,324
There's no more war.

149
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:27,209
That's all in the past.

150
00:10:27,244 --> 00:10:28,461
There are no more camps.

151
00:10:28,496 --> 00:10:30,329
It's ridiculous.

152
00:10:30,364 --> 00:10:34,083
It's utterly ridiculous
to dwell on these things.

153
00:10:34,118 --> 00:10:36,585
You did as you
thought best, and i...

154
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:39,722
i functioned as i was told.

155
00:10:42,877 --> 00:10:45,344
What is
this noise?

156
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:47,229
Strange that it
should disturb you

157
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:49,732
so it never
used to, captain.

158
00:10:49,767 --> 00:10:50,983
When your
victims screamed

159
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:52,852
you weren't
so sensitive.

160
00:10:52,887 --> 00:10:54,737
But now, they
are not screaming.

161
00:10:54,772 --> 00:10:57,857
No, they
are reacting.

162
00:10:57,892 --> 00:11:00,359
They just heard you
offer the apology

163
00:11:00,394 --> 00:11:03,496
for all the monsters
of our times.

164
00:11:03,531 --> 00:11:04,747
"We did as
we were told."

165
00:11:04,782 --> 00:11:06,615
"We functioned
as ordered."

166
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:07,867
"We merely
carried out

167
00:11:07,902 --> 00:11:09,752
directives from
our superiors."

168
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:14,256
Familiar,
is it, captain?

169
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:18,010
It was the nazi theme music
at nuremberg,

170
00:11:18,045 --> 00:11:21,130
the new lyrics
to thegotterdammerung,

171
00:11:21,165 --> 00:11:26,135
the plaintive litany of
the master race as it lay dying.

172
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:28,020
"We did not do, others did."

173
00:11:28,055 --> 00:11:29,889
Or "someone else did it.

174
00:11:29,924 --> 00:11:31,140
"We never
even knew

175
00:11:31,175 --> 00:11:33,025
that it was
being done."

176
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:36,145
Or "we did it,
but others told us to."

177
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:40,533
Captain lutze...

178
00:11:40,568 --> 00:11:44,286
ten million
human beings

179
00:11:44,321 --> 00:11:48,040
were tortured to death
in camps like this.

180
00:11:48,075 --> 00:11:54,296
Men, women, children,
infants, tired old men-

181
00:11:54,331 --> 00:11:56,799
you burned them in furnaces.

182
00:11:56,834 --> 00:11:59,301
You shoveled
them into
the earth.

183
00:11:59,336 --> 00:12:03,055
You tore up
their bodies
in rage,

184
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:06,809
and now you come back
to your scenes of horror

185
00:12:06,844 --> 00:12:10,563
and you wonder that the misery
that you planted

186
00:12:10,598 --> 00:12:12,431
has lived after you?

187
00:12:18,437 --> 00:12:22,825
There's no point in talking
about this any longer.

188
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:25,327
I must leave you
now, becker.

189
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:35,838
I told you i had
to leave, becker!

190
00:12:35,873 --> 00:12:37,840
Why did you come back,
captain lutze?

191
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:39,708
You changed your name.

192
00:12:39,743 --> 00:12:42,845
You were quite safe down
there in south america.

193
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,965
What could possibly have
brought you back here?

194
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,217
One misses
the fatherland, becker.

195
00:12:48,252 --> 00:12:50,719
One grows nostalgic
for the good old days.

196
00:12:50,754 --> 00:12:51,971
I had thought...

197
00:12:53,222 --> 00:12:55,724
i had hoped that
with the passage of time

198
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:56,976
sanity would have returned,

199
00:12:57,011 --> 00:12:59,478
people would be willing
to forget the...

200
00:12:59,513 --> 00:13:01,363
little mistakes of the past.

201
00:13:01,398 --> 00:13:03,866
Little mistakes?

202
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:08,237
Little mis...?

203
00:13:08,272 --> 00:13:10,122
You ask
too much,

204
00:13:10,157 --> 00:13:13,242
captain lutze... far too much.

205
00:13:13,277 --> 00:13:16,996
Why not ask for the earth
to stop revolving in its axis?

206
00:13:17,031 --> 00:13:19,498
Don't ask
the impossible,
captain lutze.

207
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:20,749
Do not ask forgiveness

208
00:13:20,784 --> 00:13:23,886
from those whom you
have destroyed to a point

209
00:13:23,921 --> 00:13:25,754
past
forgiveness.

210
00:13:25,789 --> 00:13:28,257
But time is short, captain.

211
00:13:28,292 --> 00:13:32,645
We have something
to accomplish here today.

212
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,513
Accomplish?

213
00:13:34,548 --> 00:13:35,764
What?

214
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:37,016
Your trial.

215
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,769
It is time
for your trial,
captain.

216
00:13:40,804 --> 00:13:44,907
The court is convening
in compound six.

217
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:48,410
The court?

218
00:13:48,445 --> 00:13:49,662
What is this nonsense?

219
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:50,913
Is this a joke?

220
00:13:50,948 --> 00:13:54,033
No... no joke, captain.

221
00:13:54,068 --> 00:13:55,284
Your trial.

222
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:01,173
You will be tried for
crimes against humanity.

223
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:03,042
By whom?
Who will try me?

224
00:14:03,077 --> 00:14:04,927
You're insane, becker.

225
00:14:04,962 --> 00:14:07,429
You were insane when i used
to string you up and...

226
00:14:07,464 --> 00:14:11,300
when you used to
string me up, captain?

227
00:14:11,335 --> 00:14:13,185
Suspended over
a hot pipe?

228
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:16,939
Feed me salt water
until my tongue swelled?

229
00:14:16,974 --> 00:14:19,441
Burned me with
cigarette butts
all over

230
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:21,310
and laughed
when i screamed

231
00:14:21,345 --> 00:14:23,195
to please put
an end to it,

232
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:25,698
to please have mercy
and kill me?

233
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:30,069
Your memory's quite good,
captain.

234
00:14:30,104 --> 00:14:31,954
Quite good,
indeed.

235
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:35,207
Come.

236
00:14:35,242 --> 00:14:36,325
Shall we go?

237
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,827
The court is waiting.

238
00:14:38,862 --> 00:14:40,079
No!

239
00:15:16,865 --> 00:15:19,368
Shall we proceed,
captain lutze?

240
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:28,010
Please.

241
00:15:28,045 --> 00:15:29,261
Please let me
out of here.

242
00:15:29,296 --> 00:15:31,764
This... this is...
this is inhuman!

243
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,883
I must get
out of here.

244
00:15:34,918 --> 00:15:36,769
I must get
out of here!

245
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:43,642
We inmates of compound six,
dachau concentration camp

246
00:15:43,677 --> 00:15:46,779
versus gunther lutze,
captain, s.s.

247
00:15:46,814 --> 00:15:51,150
That he condemned to death

248
00:15:51,185 --> 00:15:54,286
without a trial
1,700 human beings.

249
00:15:54,321 --> 00:15:56,155
Indictment two:

250
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:59,158
That he did maim and
torture without provocation

251
00:15:59,193 --> 00:16:01,660
thousands and thousands
of human beings.

252
00:16:01,695 --> 00:16:02,911
No... no...

253
00:16:02,946 --> 00:16:04,797
that he did
deliberately condone

254
00:16:04,832 --> 00:16:07,299
the use of criminal
medical experiments

255
00:16:07,334 --> 00:16:08,550
on women and children.

256
00:16:08,585 --> 00:16:09,802
No!

257
00:16:09,837 --> 00:16:11,053
No! No!

258
00:16:11,088 --> 00:16:15,424
That he did
personally murder at least...

259
00:16:15,459 --> 00:16:17,926
oh... oh, no! No!

260
00:16:17,961 --> 00:16:21,430
No! No!

261
00:16:21,465 --> 00:16:22,681
No!

262
00:16:22,716 --> 00:16:25,818
That he did sign

263
00:16:25,853 --> 00:16:28,570
and put into effect
specific orders

264
00:16:28,605 --> 00:16:31,690
calling for the gassing
and cremating

265
00:16:31,725 --> 00:16:33,575
of one million human beings.

266
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,872
I...

267
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,991
i fell asleep.

268
00:17:23,026 --> 00:17:26,745
No, you were unconscious
for awhile.

269
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:29,998
I had such a dream.

270
00:17:30,033 --> 00:17:33,001
You had no dream, captain.

271
00:17:33,036 --> 00:17:36,505
Of course i had a dream.

272
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:41,510
I dreamt... there were people
in this room.

273
00:17:41,545 --> 00:17:44,646
There was a trial.

274
00:17:44,681 --> 00:17:46,515
Ghostly figures.

275
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:48,016
They are still here.

276
00:17:48,051 --> 00:17:49,902
They have never left.

277
00:17:49,937 --> 00:17:54,273
They walk the buildings
in the square outside.

278
00:17:54,308 --> 00:17:56,775
You didn't bury them
deep enough, captain.

279
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:59,278
You didn't cover them up
with enough earth,

280
00:17:59,313 --> 00:18:02,414
or perhaps the bullets
were too small a caliber,

281
00:18:02,449 --> 00:18:04,283
or the flames
not sufficiently hot,

282
00:18:04,318 --> 00:18:06,785
or perhaps
there wasn't enough gas.

283
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:12,791
Becker... becker, who are you?

284
00:18:12,826 --> 00:18:15,544
Did you forget?

285
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:18,046
The caretaker.

286
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:22,801
This... this trial...

287
00:18:22,836 --> 00:18:25,053
the trial is over,
captain lutze.

288
00:18:25,088 --> 00:18:28,440
You have been
found guilty.

289
00:18:28,475 --> 00:18:31,193
It's time to pronounce sentence.

290
00:18:36,064 --> 00:18:38,567
You are going
to pronounce sentence?

291
00:18:38,602 --> 00:18:41,703
Is that what you have
in mind now?

292
00:18:41,738 --> 00:18:43,572
You will pronounce sentence,

293
00:18:43,607 --> 00:18:47,326
and then you shall execute
that sentence?

294
00:18:47,361 --> 00:18:49,828
Is that correct?

295
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:01,223
Pigs!
Filth!

296
00:19:01,258 --> 00:19:04,092
You will all assemble
in the square!

297
00:19:04,127 --> 00:19:06,595
You will pass sentence
on captain lutze!

298
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:09,097
You will crawl
out of your graves

299
00:19:09,132 --> 00:19:10,983
to see that justice is done!

300
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:15,487
Where are they?

301
00:19:15,522 --> 00:19:16,738
Where's the judge?

302
00:19:16,773 --> 00:19:17,990
Where's the jury?

303
00:19:18,025 --> 00:19:19,858
Where's
the executioner?

304
00:19:19,893 --> 00:19:21,743
Shall i tell you
where they are?

305
00:19:21,778 --> 00:19:22,995
In your mind.

306
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:24,863
You've hatched
them out of
your hatred.

307
00:19:24,898 --> 00:19:26,748
You've planned
your vengeance

308
00:19:26,783 --> 00:19:29,251
out of the crazy
quilt of your
imagination

309
00:19:29,286 --> 00:19:31,753
sewed together with
thin little threads

310
00:19:31,788 --> 00:19:33,005
of wishful thinking.

311
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,507
Why didn't i kill you
when i had a chance?

312
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:36,758
Why didn't
i...?

313
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:43,015
Becker?

314
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:47,386
Becker, i did kill you.

315
00:19:47,421 --> 00:19:50,522
I killed you the night...

316
00:19:50,557 --> 00:19:52,391
you killed me

317
00:19:52,426 --> 00:19:55,527
the night the americans
came close to the camp.

318
00:19:55,562 --> 00:19:58,647
You tried to
burn it down,
remember?

319
00:19:58,682 --> 00:20:02,401
You tried to kill everyone
who was left.

320
00:20:02,436 --> 00:20:05,537
In my case, you succeeded.

321
00:20:05,572 --> 00:20:09,291
So i think it would be a waste
of time, captain, wouldn't it-

322
00:20:09,326 --> 00:20:13,045
a waste of your
precious time-

323
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,798
of that little time you have
left to murder me again?

324
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:26,308
Captain lutze.

325
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:32,564
Captain lutze, you have
been tried and found guilty

326
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:35,684
of crimes against humanity.

327
00:20:35,719 --> 00:20:38,820
It is the unanimous
judgment of this court

328
00:20:38,855 --> 00:20:41,940
that from this day on,
you shall be rendered insane.

329
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:47,579
What is this nonsense?

330
00:20:47,614 --> 00:20:49,448
What is this gibberish?

331
00:20:49,483 --> 00:20:52,584
What is this madness?!

332
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:56,088
At this gate,
you shot down

333
00:20:56,123 --> 00:20:58,590
hundreds of people
with machine guns.

334
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:00,459
Do you feel it
now, captain?

335
00:21:00,494 --> 00:21:02,961
Do you feel
the bullets

336
00:21:02,996 --> 00:21:04,212
smashing into
your body?

337
00:21:04,247 --> 00:21:06,715
Do you feel the agony
of tortured lead?

338
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:14,222
On these posts,
by the anguished hour

339
00:21:14,257 --> 00:21:18,610
you hung up human beings
to die a slow death.

340
00:21:18,645 --> 00:21:20,729
Do you feel
their torture now?

341
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,989
In this room, captain,

342
00:21:31,024 --> 00:21:34,126
the things you did
to human beings

343
00:21:34,161 --> 00:21:35,377
are unmentionable.

344
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,748
How does their
torment feel?

345
00:21:57,934 --> 00:22:01,019
Captain lutze, if
you can still reason,

346
00:22:01,054 --> 00:22:04,773
if there's still any
portion of your mind

347
00:22:04,808 --> 00:22:09,161
that can still function,
take this thought with you.

348
00:22:09,196 --> 00:22:12,280
This is not hatred,
this is retribution.

349
00:22:12,315 --> 00:22:18,537
This is not revenge,
this is justice.

350
00:22:18,572 --> 00:22:21,039
But this is only
the beginning, captain.

351
00:22:21,074 --> 00:22:22,924
Only the beginning.

352
00:22:22,959 --> 00:22:29,181
Your final judgment
will come from god.

353
00:22:36,304 --> 00:22:38,190
Well, he's so full
of sedatives now

354
00:22:38,225 --> 00:22:40,058
he doesn't even know
he's on the earth,

355
00:22:40,093 --> 00:22:41,943
but i want him
in the hospital,

356
00:22:41,978 --> 00:22:44,446
and i want him
strapped to the bed.

357
00:22:44,481 --> 00:22:45,697
Doctor?

358
00:22:45,732 --> 00:22:47,065
What happened to him?

359
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,568
I drove him up here myself
not two hours ago.

360
00:22:49,603 --> 00:22:51,319
He was
all right then.

361
00:22:51,354 --> 00:22:52,571
I have no idea.

362
00:22:52,606 --> 00:22:55,707
I only know that he is
screaming through pain.

363
00:22:55,742 --> 00:22:58,210
No, it's more than pain,
it's agony.

364
00:22:58,245 --> 00:23:00,712
And there isn't a mark on him.

365
00:23:00,747 --> 00:23:05,333
He's insane,
a raving maniac.

366
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:07,969
But what could happen
in two hours

367
00:23:08,004 --> 00:23:10,472
to turn a man
into a raving maniac?

368
00:23:10,507 --> 00:23:12,974
That, somebody will have
to tell me that.

369
00:23:14,843 --> 00:23:16,094
Dachau.

370
00:23:16,129 --> 00:23:19,731
Why does it
still stand?

371
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,102
Why do we
keep it standing?

372
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:29,107
There is an answer
to the doctor's question.

373
00:23:29,142 --> 00:23:31,610
All the dachaus
must remain standing-

374
00:23:31,645 --> 00:23:34,112
the dachaus, the belsens,
the buchenwalds,

375
00:23:34,147 --> 00:23:35,997
the auschwitzes, all of them.

376
00:23:36,032 --> 00:23:37,866
They must remain standing

377
00:23:37,901 --> 00:23:41,002
because they are a monument
to a moment in time

378
00:23:41,037 --> 00:23:44,756
when some men decided to turn
the earth into a graveyard.

379
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:47,259
Into it, they shoveled
all of their reason,

380
00:23:47,294 --> 00:23:49,127
their logic, their knowledge,

381
00:23:49,162 --> 00:23:51,012
but worst of all,
their conscience.

382
00:23:51,047 --> 00:23:52,881
And the moment we forget this-

383
00:23:52,916 --> 00:23:56,017
the moment we cease to be
haunted by its remembrance-

384
00:23:56,052 --> 00:23:57,886
then we become
the gravediggers.

385
00:23:57,921 --> 00:24:00,388
Something to dwell on
and to remember,

386
00:24:00,423 --> 00:24:02,891
not only in the twilight zone,

387
00:24:02,926 --> 00:24:06,027
but wherever men
walk god's earth.

388
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:15,120
Rod serling, creator of
the twilight zone,

389
00:24:15,155 --> 00:24:17,622
will tell you about
next week's story

390
00:24:17,657 --> 00:24:19,491
after this message.

391
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:22,294
And now, mr. Serling.

392
00:24:22,329 --> 00:24:25,413
Next week, we see what will
happen to a world that,

393
00:24:25,448 --> 00:24:29,167
with each passing hour, draws
closer and closer to the sun.

394
00:24:29,202 --> 00:24:32,304
This is a nightmare in depth,
in which we watch

395
00:24:32,339 --> 00:24:34,806
two doomed women spend
their last hours

396
00:24:34,841 --> 00:24:37,309
struggling for survival
against a fiery orb

397
00:24:37,344 --> 00:24:41,062
that moves over the top of
a hot, still, deserted city.

398
00:24:41,097 --> 00:24:42,931
We call it "the midnight sun,"

399
00:24:42,966 --> 00:24:45,433
and we also recommend it
most highly.

400
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,265
This is james arness.

401
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,134
You know, it's only a short hop

402
00:25:19,169 --> 00:25:21,636
fromthe twilight zone
to dodge city andgunsmoke,

403
00:25:21,671 --> 00:25:24,139
saturday nights,
over most of these stations.
