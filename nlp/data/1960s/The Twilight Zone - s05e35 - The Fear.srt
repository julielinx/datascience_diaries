1
00:00:05,889 --> 00:00:09,025
You unlock this door
with the key of imagination.

2
00:00:09,642 --> 00:00:11,528
Beyond it is another dimension-

3
00:00:11,563 --> 00:00:12,779
a dimension of sound,

4
00:00:14,065 --> 00:00:15,899
a dimension of sight,

5
00:00:15,934 --> 00:00:17,784
a dimension of mind.

6
00:00:17,819 --> 00:00:20,904
You're moving into a land
of both shadow and substance,

7
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:22,155
of things and ideas.

8
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:25,909
You've just crossed over
into the twilight zone.

9
00:01:18,711 --> 00:01:20,597
Evening, ma'am.

10
00:01:20,632 --> 00:01:22,465
Are you miss scott?

11
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,466
That's right.

12
00:01:23,501 --> 00:01:26,603
Well, i'm trooper
franklin, miss scott.

13
00:01:26,638 --> 00:01:29,722
May i come in
for a moment?

14
00:01:34,477 --> 00:01:36,362
Thank you.

15
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:40,116
Attractive place.

16
00:01:40,151 --> 00:01:41,985
That's gracious
of you to say so.

17
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,236
What else is new?

18
00:01:43,271 --> 00:01:45,121
You came into
town this morning?

19
00:01:45,156 --> 00:01:47,123
It's an unhappy pilgrimage

20
00:01:47,158 --> 00:01:48,992
that i'm forced
to make every week.

21
00:01:49,027 --> 00:01:53,379
No one will deliver my supplies,
so i have to get them myself.

22
00:01:53,414 --> 00:01:57,133
Was there anything else,
trooper franklin?

23
00:01:57,168 --> 00:01:59,636
Uh, mr. Barth
down at the general store

24
00:01:59,671 --> 00:02:02,138
said something
about you telling him

25
00:02:02,173 --> 00:02:05,892
you'd seen some kind of lights
in the sky last night.

26
00:02:05,927 --> 00:02:07,760
So?

27
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:09,012
Well...

28
00:02:09,047 --> 00:02:10,897
i just thought i'd, uh...

29
00:02:10,932 --> 00:02:14,017
come up here and ask you
a few questions about it.

30
00:02:14,052 --> 00:02:16,519
That's intrepid of you, trooper.

31
00:02:16,554 --> 00:02:18,655
I did see
something last night.

32
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:21,774
I did mention it to that
pickle barrel wheeler-dealer.

33
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:26,162
I mentioned it because the
run of dialogue is so dull

34
00:02:26,197 --> 00:02:29,282
it makes me want to retire
from the human race.

35
00:02:29,317 --> 00:02:32,418
I'm up to here in rainfall,
wind velocity,

36
00:02:32,453 --> 00:02:34,921
snowfalls and
gripping bingo games.

37
00:02:35,171 --> 00:02:38,925
So i thought i'd
inject something new
into the dialogue.

38
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,176
I see.

39
00:02:44,047 --> 00:02:45,298
Well, uh...

40
00:02:46,549 --> 00:02:49,686
what kind of lights
would you say they were?

41
00:02:49,721 --> 00:02:53,189
If you're looking for a red-hot
gun-'em-down battle against evil

42
00:02:53,224 --> 00:02:55,058
head north because
you won't find it here.

43
00:02:55,093 --> 00:02:57,560
You're here from
new york, miss scott?

44
00:02:57,595 --> 00:02:59,445
Is that a misdemeanor?

45
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,314
No, no, not
at all, i...

46
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:03,199
i was just interested.

47
00:03:03,234 --> 00:03:05,702
We heard you'd
taken a place up here.

48
00:03:05,737 --> 00:03:07,570
A cabin, you living alone.

49
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:11,958
You were some sort
of a... fashion editor?

50
00:03:11,993 --> 00:03:13,826
Yes.

51
00:03:15,078 --> 00:03:17,580
I was some sort
of a fashion editor.

52
00:03:17,615 --> 00:03:20,717
My yearly salary would have
bought the main street

53
00:03:20,752 --> 00:03:23,836
of that rinky-dink
whistle-stop down there.

54
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:28,224
I had what is euphemistically
known as a nervous breakdown.

55
00:03:29,592 --> 00:03:31,594
So i came up here to be alone.

56
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:35,348
Said journey being the
biggest rock i ever pulled

57
00:03:35,383 --> 00:03:37,233
because you can't be alone here.

58
00:03:37,268 --> 00:03:39,352
You have to share
your private life

59
00:03:39,387 --> 00:03:40,987
with country bumpkins.

60
00:03:41,022 --> 00:03:42,238
And, um...

61
00:03:42,273 --> 00:03:44,741
gilbert and sullivan
state troopers.

62
00:03:46,609 --> 00:03:49,996
Repeating, trooper,
since your ears seem to flap:

63
00:03:50,031 --> 00:03:53,116
There is nothing for you here,
so why not run along?

64
00:03:53,616 --> 00:03:54,867
I think you're quite right.

65
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:57,370
There isn't
much here for me.

66
00:03:57,405 --> 00:04:01,007
Or, for that
matter, anyone else.

67
00:04:01,042 --> 00:04:02,875
What's that
supposed to mean?

68
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,511
That's supposed to mean
that in your book

69
00:04:05,546 --> 00:04:09,882
anyone who hasn't bought
their clothes on fifth avenue

70
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:11,768
is considered a bumpkin.

71
00:04:12,135 --> 00:04:14,637
And everybody
who doesn't
broaden their as

72
00:04:14,672 --> 00:04:16,522
is considered
provincial.

73
00:04:16,557 --> 00:04:18,775
And that elusive
thing called culture

74
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:21,894
is really only
an inheritable legacy

75
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:25,648
available only
to insufferable snobs

76
00:04:25,683 --> 00:04:27,533
of which, miss scott,

77
00:04:27,568 --> 00:04:31,287
i'm afraid you are
a charter member.

78
00:04:44,585 --> 00:04:46,419
What's happened?

79
00:05:00,316 --> 00:05:04,070
You're not frightened,
are you, miss scott?

80
00:05:04,105 --> 00:05:05,938
I'm afraid you put me

81
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:08,441
in the wrong sorority,
mr. Franklin.

82
00:05:08,476 --> 00:05:11,577
I'm a charter member,
but not of snobs.

83
00:05:11,612 --> 00:05:14,080
I'm the founder and
the chairman of the board

84
00:05:14,115 --> 00:05:16,582
of the society
of frightened people.

85
00:05:16,617 --> 00:05:19,702
So frightened that
they can't face the world

86
00:05:20,336 --> 00:05:23,456
and they go away
to little mountain retreats.

87
00:05:23,491 --> 00:05:24,707
They act superior

88
00:05:24,742 --> 00:05:28,461
because they think it hides
their tensions and neuroses.

89
00:05:28,496 --> 00:05:30,963
Thank you for
an honest answer.

90
00:05:32,215 --> 00:05:35,351
Why don't you rustle
up some hot coffee

91
00:05:35,386 --> 00:05:36,602
for the two of us?

92
00:05:36,637 --> 00:05:38,471
I'll go out
and check around

93
00:05:38,506 --> 00:05:42,225
and stay with you
an hour or so to see
if it comes back.

94
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,110
I'll drive you back
into town if you'd like.

95
00:05:44,145 --> 00:05:45,361
What was it?

96
00:05:45,396 --> 00:05:47,864
The noise
and the lights?

97
00:05:47,899 --> 00:05:50,983
A meteor or maybe an
aircraft off its course.

98
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:53,486
Those would be the
rational explanations.

99
00:05:53,521 --> 00:05:55,988
Give me an
irrational one.

100
00:05:57,874 --> 00:06:00,376
Maybe something
from outer space.

101
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:08,501
"There are more things

102
00:06:08,536 --> 00:06:11,003
"in heaven and
earth, horatio,

103
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:14,140
than are dreamt of
in your philosophy."

104
00:06:14,757 --> 00:06:16,642
That's shakespeare,
miss scott.

105
00:06:16,677 --> 00:06:19,762
That's shakespeare,
but what is that?

106
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:25,401
The major ingredient
of any recipe for fear

107
00:06:25,902 --> 00:06:27,153
is the unknown.

108
00:06:27,188 --> 00:06:30,907
And here are two characters
about to partake of the meal.

109
00:06:30,942 --> 00:06:34,026
Miss charlotte scott,
a fashion editor,

110
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:36,779
and mr. Robert franklin,
a state trooper...

111
00:06:36,814 --> 00:06:39,916
and the third member
of the party, the unknown,

112
00:06:39,951 --> 00:06:43,669
that has just landed
a few hundred yards away.

113
00:06:43,704 --> 00:06:46,789
This person or thing
is soon to be met.

114
00:06:46,824 --> 00:06:49,292
This is a mountain cabin

115
00:06:49,327 --> 00:06:53,045
but it is also
a clearing in the shadows

116
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,548
known as the twilight zone.

117
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:14,177
Mr. Franklin,
did you see anything?

118
00:08:14,212 --> 00:08:15,795
Not much.

119
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,680
You better go back inside.

120
00:08:17,715 --> 00:08:19,549
I'll be right back.

121
00:08:57,086 --> 00:09:00,223
Haven't you ever heard
of an emergency brake?

122
00:09:00,258 --> 00:09:02,725
Yup, heard and used.

123
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,228
But this emergency brakewason.

124
00:09:05,263 --> 00:09:06,479
There's only two of us

125
00:09:06,514 --> 00:09:08,981
and neither of us
were near the car.

126
00:09:09,016 --> 00:09:09,599
Who pushed it?

127
00:09:10,233 --> 00:09:11,484
Maybe nobody.

128
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,986
Maybe the brake just gave out.

129
00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:15,855
You believe that?

130
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:17,106
For the time being.

131
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,860
That's the only explanation
i can conjure up.

132
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:42,381
The radio's dead.

133
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,267
No power
at all.

134
00:09:44,302 --> 00:09:46,135
You got a phone inside?

135
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:49,272
That's one concession
to privacy that i didn't make.

136
00:09:49,307 --> 00:09:51,140
I've got a telephone
and some coffee.

137
00:09:51,175 --> 00:09:53,643
At this moment, both are
luxury items in my book.

138
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:02,535
Oh, uh, better lock it.

139
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:06,289
You've just applied
for membership, hmm?

140
00:10:06,324 --> 00:10:09,408
My club for
frightened people.

141
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:11,294
Lady, i've been
in two wars,

142
00:10:11,329 --> 00:10:14,413
and i've been a policeman
between and after.

143
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:16,299
And i'm not
ashamed to say

144
00:10:16,334 --> 00:10:20,670
that i've racked
up more scared hours
than most rabbits.

145
00:10:20,705 --> 00:10:23,806
Thank you for
an honest answer.

146
00:10:23,841 --> 00:10:26,309
Miss scott, maybe
you can learn this,

147
00:10:26,344 --> 00:10:28,811
maybe it'll help you.

148
00:10:28,846 --> 00:10:32,565
But being frightened... it's a
normal, natural human function

149
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,816
just like breathing.

150
00:10:33,851 --> 00:10:38,187
It's how you react to fright,
that's what really counts.

151
00:10:38,222 --> 00:10:41,324
You can get the shakes
and crawl under a bed

152
00:10:41,359 --> 00:10:45,077
or you can clench your fists
and go about your business.

153
00:10:45,112 --> 00:10:48,831
You can clench your fists,
but i'll be under the bed.

154
00:10:48,866 --> 00:10:53,202
Being frightened hasn't
hurt your sense of humor,
has it?

155
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:05,715
You got two beds?

156
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,600
I might like
to do a little crawling

157
00:11:07,635 --> 00:11:10,102
under one of them myself.

158
00:11:10,137 --> 00:11:11,354
Your phone is dead.

159
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:23,616
I'll tell you this much,
miss scott.

160
00:11:23,651 --> 00:11:26,736
Despite all you may have heard
about officers of the law,

161
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:29,872
we react
like normal human beings.

162
00:11:29,907 --> 00:11:33,242
A roaring fire,
a mountain cabin,

163
00:11:33,277 --> 00:11:35,745
hot coffee...

164
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:38,247
you know, if i live long enough
to retire,

165
00:11:38,282 --> 00:11:41,384
it doesn't sound like
a bad later life, does it?

166
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,640
What's the matter?

167
00:11:47,675 --> 00:11:50,142
Listen, don't
you hear it?

168
00:11:50,177 --> 00:11:52,011
It's up there.

169
00:11:52,046 --> 00:11:53,896
Where?

170
00:11:53,931 --> 00:11:55,765
Oh... it's
on the roof.

171
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,650
Is there an attic
or something?

172
00:11:57,685 --> 00:11:58,901
No.

173
00:11:58,936 --> 00:12:01,404
Is there some way
to get up on the roof?

174
00:12:01,439 --> 00:12:03,272
Not from inside.

175
00:12:03,307 --> 00:12:06,409
Oh, please, please don't
go out there, please.

176
00:12:06,444 --> 00:12:10,162
Now, lady, you may have
been a hot fashion editor

177
00:12:10,197 --> 00:12:12,031
but when it comes
to greeting intruders

178
00:12:12,066 --> 00:12:14,533
you're something
else again.

179
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:16,419
Now, you lock
this after me.

180
00:12:16,454 --> 00:12:18,921
And don't open it
until i tell you to.

181
00:12:18,956 --> 00:12:21,424
No, you bet
your life i won't.

182
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,416
Who is it?

183
00:14:27,451 --> 00:14:29,301
It's me.

184
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:35,558
Well...

185
00:14:35,593 --> 00:14:37,426
did you see anything?

186
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:39,311
I didn't imagine it,
did i?

187
00:14:39,346 --> 00:14:41,814
There was something
up on the roof.

188
00:14:41,849 --> 00:14:43,682
Sounded like footsteps.

189
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:45,568
Did you find anything?

190
00:14:45,603 --> 00:14:48,070
There's nothing on the
roof, nothing at all.

191
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:50,573
Not on the roof, anyway.

192
00:14:50,608 --> 00:14:54,326
Maybe it's just, maybe it's
just a little imagination

193
00:14:54,361 --> 00:14:56,195
seeping into
the both of us.

194
00:14:56,230 --> 00:15:00,583
Maybe it's the night, maybe
it's the loneliness up here.

195
00:15:00,618 --> 00:15:02,585
If there was
something on the roof

196
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:05,087
it would have
crushed this house flat.

197
00:15:05,122 --> 00:15:06,338
Why?

198
00:15:06,373 --> 00:15:08,340
Because the thing,

199
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,209
or whatever it is,

200
00:15:10,244 --> 00:15:13,963
moved the car back
to where it was

201
00:15:13,998 --> 00:15:16,465
and i think i know
how it was done.

202
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,351
It was carried
in somebody's hand.

203
00:15:19,386 --> 00:15:21,854
There are fingerprints
on the car-

204
00:15:21,889 --> 00:15:24,974
big fingerprints.

205
00:15:25,009 --> 00:15:26,859
And if they are
fingerprints,

206
00:15:26,894 --> 00:15:29,979
then we shouldn't
have any trouble

207
00:15:30,014 --> 00:15:31,864
finding our invader.

208
00:15:35,618 --> 00:15:37,486
Because he must stand

209
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:40,623
better than 500 feet high.

210
00:16:10,554 --> 00:16:12,404
Good morning.

211
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:14,907
Morning.

212
00:16:14,942 --> 00:16:17,409
What time do you make it?

213
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:21,163
Uh, it's 6:00.

214
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:22,414
Ooh.

215
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:24,283
You get
much sleep?

216
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:26,168
Couple of hours,
off and on.

217
00:16:26,203 --> 00:16:28,037
How about you?

218
00:16:28,072 --> 00:16:31,790
About the same,
i guess.

219
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:33,792
I, uh...

220
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:37,546
i didn't hear anything.

221
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:38,297
I didn't either.

222
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:44,303
Well, let's greet the morning...

223
00:16:45,554 --> 00:16:48,691
and whoever else
happens to be in it.

224
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:55,624
You got any, uh, friends,
a little bent upstairs?

225
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:58,127
Somebody who'd go to
these kind of extremes?

226
00:17:58,162 --> 00:18:00,012
If i did have,
they'd have been committed

227
00:18:00,047 --> 00:18:01,263
a long time before this.

228
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:22,151
What is it?

229
00:18:22,785 --> 00:18:25,904
Take a look at this.

230
00:18:32,795 --> 00:18:34,663
It's a footprint.

231
00:18:34,698 --> 00:18:37,166
Yeah, that's what
it is, all right.

232
00:18:37,201 --> 00:18:38,417
It's a footprint.

233
00:18:38,452 --> 00:18:39,668
Look at the size of it.

234
00:18:39,703 --> 00:18:41,553
Let's get out
of here, let's run.

235
00:18:41,588 --> 00:18:43,172
Where to?

236
00:18:43,207 --> 00:18:45,174
To the village, down the road.

237
00:18:45,209 --> 00:18:46,425
Somewhere away from here.

238
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:48,427
Use your head, will you?

239
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:50,312
It's 30 miles to the village.

240
00:18:50,347 --> 00:18:53,432
No matter what
direction
we turn

241
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:56,568
there's somebody out here
as high as a mountain

242
00:18:56,603 --> 00:19:00,939
who could just reach down and
crush us with his little finger

243
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:04,693
block our way with his big toe.

244
00:19:04,728 --> 00:19:05,944
What can we do?

245
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:10,582
I can try and fix
that car radio

246
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:12,451
and phone for help.

247
00:19:14,203 --> 00:19:17,339
You can do whatever you like

248
00:19:17,374 --> 00:19:19,208
but i'm not staying here.

249
00:19:19,243 --> 00:19:21,093
I'm getting out.

250
00:19:21,128 --> 00:19:24,096
Miss scott!

251
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:58,497
I can't believe it.

252
00:19:58,532 --> 00:20:00,999
All right,
miss scott, take off.

253
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:04,136
I'll try and keep
this nightmare occupied.

254
00:20:04,171 --> 00:20:07,890
Maybe you can reach the village
and get some help.

255
00:20:07,925 --> 00:20:10,893
You think they'd ever
hear the end of my story

256
00:20:10,928 --> 00:20:12,761
before they locked me up?

257
00:20:12,796 --> 00:20:16,515
Honey, that's only
one of the risks

258
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:19,401
we have to take.

259
00:20:19,436 --> 00:20:21,520
Why doesn't it
do something?

260
00:20:21,555 --> 00:20:23,405
Now, that's a good question.

261
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,908
Because if it
wanted to destroy us

262
00:20:25,943 --> 00:20:29,027
it could have done it
a long time ago.

263
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:33,031
Us, the village down below
and the whole state.

264
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:36,034
Go on, miss scott,
take off, will you?

265
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:39,788
No. No, as scared as i am,
i want to stay.

266
00:20:39,823 --> 00:20:43,542
Yes, i want
to stay with you.

267
00:20:43,577 --> 00:20:48,547
All right, but i
think i better fill
you in on something.

268
00:20:48,582 --> 00:20:51,683
I've got to fight
that with this.

269
00:20:51,718 --> 00:20:54,803
That's like trying
to bring down a bomber

270
00:20:54,838 --> 00:20:56,688
with a peashooter.

271
00:20:56,723 --> 00:20:59,191
But it's all we've got.

272
00:21:57,866 --> 00:21:59,751
Uh, oh...

273
00:21:59,786 --> 00:22:01,003
oh.

274
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,762
It's a balloon.

275
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,631
Fantastic.

276
00:22:13,882 --> 00:22:15,767
It's...

277
00:22:15,802 --> 00:22:17,269
unbelievable.

278
00:22:17,304 --> 00:22:19,137
But that's what it is.

279
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:21,023
It's a balloon.

280
00:22:21,058 --> 00:22:22,641
That's it?

281
00:22:22,676 --> 00:22:25,394
Is this what we've
been frightened of?

282
00:22:25,429 --> 00:22:27,896
A fugitive from
a thanksgiving day parade?

283
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:33,535
Not quite.

284
00:22:55,173 --> 00:22:57,676
This is what we've
been frightened of.

285
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:01,680
Take a look at it,
miss scott.

286
00:23:01,715 --> 00:23:04,816
Look at the source
of our nightmare.

287
00:23:04,851 --> 00:23:08,570
Great leader, this
is earth explorer one.

288
00:23:08,605 --> 00:23:10,439
Must report failure.

289
00:23:10,474 --> 00:23:12,324
Burned trees, dug up shoe print

290
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:14,826
sprayed fingerprint
on earth vehicle

291
00:23:14,861 --> 00:23:17,329
moved it by magnet,
inflated giant figure.

292
00:23:17,364 --> 00:23:21,199
Entire operation ended by earth
man's failure to be frightened.

293
00:23:21,234 --> 00:23:23,085
Repeat, failure
to be frightened.

294
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,587
Request permission
to depart earth.

295
00:23:25,622 --> 00:23:27,456
Please, oh, please,
great leader

296
00:23:27,491 --> 00:23:29,958
let us depart
before they crush us.

297
00:23:41,103 --> 00:23:43,605
You know something?

298
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,108
I wish them luck.

299
00:23:46,143 --> 00:23:50,112
Maybe the next place they land,
they can be the giants.

300
00:23:50,147 --> 00:23:51,730
What of our next visitors?

301
00:23:51,765 --> 00:23:54,866
What if they are giants?

302
00:23:54,901 --> 00:23:57,869
Well, i think you'd
spit in their eye.

303
00:23:57,904 --> 00:23:59,738
That's what i think.

304
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,743
Fear, of course,
is extremely relative.

305
00:24:04,778 --> 00:24:08,497
It depends on who can look
down and who must look up.

306
00:24:08,532 --> 00:24:10,382
It depends on other vagaries

307
00:24:10,417 --> 00:24:12,884
like the time,
the mood, the darkness.

308
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:16,004
But it's been said before
with great validity

309
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:19,758
that the worst thing there
is to fear is fear itself.

310
00:24:19,793 --> 00:24:22,894
Tonight's tale of terror
and tiny people

311
00:24:22,929 --> 00:24:25,397
onthe twilight zone.
