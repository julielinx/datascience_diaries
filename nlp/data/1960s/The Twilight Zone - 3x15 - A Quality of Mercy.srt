1
00:00:09,776 --> 00:00:12,278
You're traveling
through another dimension-

2
00:00:12,313 --> 00:00:15,398
a dimension not only of sight
and sound, but of mind,

3
00:00:15,433 --> 00:00:17,283
a journey into a wondrous land

4
00:00:17,318 --> 00:00:19,786
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

5
00:00:19,821 --> 00:00:22,288
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

6
00:00:46,062 --> 00:00:48,431
Short.

7
00:00:48,466 --> 00:00:50,316
5-0.

8
00:00:50,351 --> 00:00:53,570
5-0.

9
00:00:53,605 --> 00:00:54,821
That's right, still.

10
00:00:56,689 --> 00:00:58,575
They say that's their limit.

11
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:06,082
Hello.
This is baker company f.o.

12
00:01:06,117 --> 00:01:07,951
You've wrecked
some rice paddies,

13
00:01:07,986 --> 00:01:09,836
you've knocked down
a grove of palm trees.

14
00:01:09,871 --> 00:01:11,704
What we're trying
to figure out is

15
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:13,590
if there's something
in your religion

16
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:14,841
that says you're not supposed

17
00:01:14,876 --> 00:01:16,709
to send a shell
into a cave.

18
00:01:16,744 --> 00:01:19,846
How's that?

19
00:01:19,881 --> 00:01:22,348
Yeah, we can bypass it.

20
00:01:22,383 --> 00:01:24,217
Well, look, all
you've done so far

21
00:01:24,252 --> 00:01:26,719
is ruin some real estate
and kept some japs awake.

22
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:28,605
Anybody back there
figure out how long

23
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,107
it takes the enemy
to die of insomnia?

24
00:01:31,142 --> 00:01:33,610
Yeah.

25
00:01:36,112 --> 00:01:37,363
Yeah, all right.

26
00:01:37,981 --> 00:01:39,866
Okay. Well,
keep in touch.

27
00:01:39,901 --> 00:01:43,620
Hey, sarge, what goes?

28
00:01:43,655 --> 00:01:45,488
They're going to
fire for effect

29
00:01:45,523 --> 00:01:47,373
until late
this afternoon.

30
00:01:47,408 --> 00:01:49,242
If they can't
smoke them out,

31
00:01:49,277 --> 00:01:50,493
maybe we'll bypass it.

32
00:01:50,528 --> 00:01:51,744
Yeah.

33
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:53,880
Well, that's what
i like to hear.

34
00:01:53,915 --> 00:01:55,748
Amen.

35
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:57,634
Well, i feel
better already.

36
00:01:57,669 --> 00:01:58,885
I've got no big yen

37
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,753
to run into
anything anymore,

38
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:02,639
not at this
stage of the game.

39
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:10,146
Let's go up.

40
00:02:17,654 --> 00:02:19,522
You don't think
they'd expect us

41
00:02:19,557 --> 00:02:22,025
to go at that
frontally, do you?

42
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,910
When two air strikes

43
00:02:23,945 --> 00:02:25,778
and an afternoon
of lobbing shells

44
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:27,664
doesn't accomplish anything,

45
00:02:27,699 --> 00:02:30,166
you better start
counting your cartridges

46
00:02:30,201 --> 00:02:32,669
because we are
the bottom of the barrel.

47
00:02:32,704 --> 00:02:35,788
When they can't move
an enemy with the big stuff,

48
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:38,925
that's when they call out
the queen of battle-

49
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,793
the everloving infantry.

50
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:42,679
Yeah, well,
what do you think?

51
00:02:42,714 --> 00:02:44,547
A month? More? Less?

52
00:02:44,582 --> 00:02:46,432
I don't know.
We got them ringed.

53
00:02:46,467 --> 00:02:48,301
They're finished on okinawa.

54
00:02:48,336 --> 00:02:51,938
The trouble with these
little bandy-legged buzzards

55
00:02:51,973 --> 00:02:54,440
is that they just don't know
when to quit.

56
00:02:54,475 --> 00:02:56,309
Look at them.

57
00:02:56,344 --> 00:02:58,811
They're in there,
holed up in that cave,

58
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:00,063
beaten, sick, starved...

59
00:03:00,697 --> 00:03:02,565
and yet there's no one in there

60
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,068
to tell them that the war's
over for them.

61
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:10,707
Those poor guys.

62
00:03:12,575 --> 00:03:14,961
It's august, 1945,

63
00:03:14,996 --> 00:03:18,715
the last grimy pages
of a dirty, torn book of war.

64
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,583
The place is

65
00:03:20,618 --> 00:03:22,468
the philippine islands.

66
00:03:22,503 --> 00:03:26,222
The men are what's left of
a platoon of american infantry

67
00:03:26,257 --> 00:03:28,091
whose dulled and tired eyes

68
00:03:28,126 --> 00:03:30,593
set deep
in dulled and tired faces

69
00:03:30,628 --> 00:03:33,096
can now look toward a miracle-

70
00:03:33,131 --> 00:03:36,849
that moment when the nightmare
appears to be coming to an end.

71
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:39,986
But they've got one more battle
to fight,

72
00:03:40,021 --> 00:03:42,488
and in a moment,
we'll observe that battle.

73
00:03:42,523 --> 00:03:44,991
August, 1945,
philippine islands.

74
00:03:45,026 --> 00:03:48,111
But in reality it's high noon
in the twilight zone.

75
00:04:30,787 --> 00:04:35,158
Which one of you is
sergeant causarano?

76
00:04:38,294 --> 00:04:39,545
That'd be me.

77
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,797
I'm lieutenant katell.

78
00:04:40,832 --> 00:04:42,665
I'm taking over the platoon.

79
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,168
What's your situation here,
sergeant?

80
00:04:45,203 --> 00:04:46,419
Well, we're observing

81
00:04:46,454 --> 00:04:50,173
for a mortar company,
lieutenant.

82
00:04:55,812 --> 00:04:57,680
That cave down there-

83
00:04:57,715 --> 00:04:59,565
a bunch of japs
holed up in it.

84
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,685
We've been trying to
get them out of there

85
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,570
for two days.
Nothing doing.

86
00:05:04,605 --> 00:05:07,073
Your binoculars, please,
sergeant.

87
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,837
Tough little item.

88
00:05:20,872 --> 00:05:22,705
Looks like we'll have to do

89
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,208
a little mopping up
by ourselves.

90
00:05:25,243 --> 00:05:26,459
Sir?

91
00:05:26,494 --> 00:05:28,344
We'll go at it frontally.

92
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:30,213
Move right in there
and wipe them out.

93
00:05:30,248 --> 00:05:31,464
Hey, lieutenant,

94
00:05:31,499 --> 00:05:32,715
you sure you got
the right platoon?

95
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,966
What about it, sergeant,
can we go it alone?

96
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:35,218
Go it alone?

97
00:05:35,253 --> 00:05:36,469
Pardon me, sir,

98
00:05:36,504 --> 00:05:40,857
but you've just inherited
a pretty good outfit,

99
00:05:40,892 --> 00:05:42,358
but we're notthatgood.

100
00:05:42,393 --> 00:05:44,861
This is infantry,
not kamikaze.

101
00:05:44,896 --> 00:05:46,729
I told you he had
the wrong platoon.

102
00:05:46,764 --> 00:05:50,116
I think he's got
the wrong army.

103
00:05:50,151 --> 00:05:52,618
Your name is what?

104
00:05:52,653 --> 00:05:55,121
Watkins, andrew j. Watkins.

105
00:05:55,156 --> 00:05:57,874
Are you accustomed
to talking to an officer

106
00:05:57,909 --> 00:05:59,876
lying on your back?

107
00:06:05,381 --> 00:06:07,250
I'm not accustomed

108
00:06:07,285 --> 00:06:09,752
to talking to
an officer any way.

109
00:06:09,787 --> 00:06:11,003
We lost the last three
we had,

110
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:12,889
and there's usually
a little space of time...

111
00:06:12,924 --> 00:06:14,140
well, you've been
assigned another one.

112
00:06:14,175 --> 00:06:15,391
You've got to learn
to live with him.

113
00:06:15,426 --> 00:06:16,642
We'll start off with
a little reminder.

114
00:06:16,677 --> 00:06:19,145
When you talk
to an officer,

115
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,647
you stand up on
your two feet.

116
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:24,150
We've been in
the line 33 days.

117
00:06:24,185 --> 00:06:25,401
We haven't had
much sleep.

118
00:06:25,436 --> 00:06:27,270
You have my sympathy,
sergeant.

119
00:06:27,305 --> 00:06:29,155
My job is to lead this platoon,

120
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,406
and i intend to lead it my way.

121
00:06:30,441 --> 00:06:32,909
When i tell you to jump,
you'll jump.

122
00:06:32,944 --> 00:06:36,028
If i tell you to stand up,
you'll stand up.

123
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:38,531
If i tell you to head
toward that cave,

124
00:06:38,566 --> 00:06:40,416
that's exactly
what you'll do.

125
00:06:40,451 --> 00:06:42,919
Begging the lieutenant's
pardon...

126
00:06:42,954 --> 00:06:44,787
sergeant?

127
00:06:44,822 --> 00:06:47,924
What are
your orders,
lieutenant?

128
00:06:49,827 --> 00:06:52,929
We'll have to go right
in there and wipe them out.

129
00:06:52,964 --> 00:06:54,797
What about it,
sergeant?

130
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,185
Are you asking my opinion,
lieutenant?

131
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,053
I'm willing
to discuss it.

132
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:02,939
Well, chronologically,
lieutenant,

133
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:04,807
first thing you should do

134
00:07:05,441 --> 00:07:07,310
is take that gold bar
off your helmet

135
00:07:07,345 --> 00:07:09,812
and take the one
off your collar

136
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:11,697
and put it
in your pocket.

137
00:07:11,732 --> 00:07:14,200
The japs may be
half-beaten, half-starved,

138
00:07:14,235 --> 00:07:16,068
but they're not dumb.

139
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:17,954
They're tough
and they're shrewd

140
00:07:17,989 --> 00:07:19,205
and they got eyes.

141
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,959
We lost three platoon officers
because they made

142
00:07:22,994 --> 00:07:25,461
slight motions of commands
with their hands,

143
00:07:25,496 --> 00:07:27,964
and that's what
the japs look for-

144
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,215
the guy in command.

145
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,717
I intended to
remove the insignia.

146
00:07:31,752 --> 00:07:34,220
Now what about
attacking the cave?

147
00:07:34,255 --> 00:07:36,722
Well, maybe we'll
have to do it eventually,

148
00:07:36,757 --> 00:07:39,225
but the war
isn't going to end

149
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,476
before dinnertime.

150
00:07:40,511 --> 00:07:43,596
I say we sit on it
the rest of the day

151
00:07:43,631 --> 00:07:46,098
and see what
some 105's can do.

152
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:47,350
Maybe you're right.

153
00:07:47,385 --> 00:07:49,852
But it strikes me
we could move in there

154
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:51,737
and wipe them out
inside of an hour.

155
00:07:51,772 --> 00:07:54,240
Lob grenades in
and pulverize them.

156
00:07:54,275 --> 00:07:56,108
Lieutenant...

157
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:58,861
how long have you
been out here?

158
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:02,615
What's that got to do with it?

159
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:05,001
Not a heck of a lot, i suppose,

160
00:08:05,036 --> 00:08:07,503
but you talk like
it's a football game

161
00:08:07,538 --> 00:08:09,372
and this is no football game.

162
00:08:09,407 --> 00:08:11,257
It's one long, hard gut ache

163
00:08:11,874 --> 00:08:13,759
with a lot of torn-up,
mangled guys.

164
00:08:13,794 --> 00:08:16,879
It's going to take a long time
for us to forget it.

165
00:08:16,914 --> 00:08:19,265
You have to remember,
lieutenant,

166
00:08:19,882 --> 00:08:21,767
you haven't
been shot at yet.

167
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:24,770
And you haven't
shot anybody either.

168
00:08:24,805 --> 00:08:26,772
You got here ahead of me,
i'll concede you that,

169
00:08:26,807 --> 00:08:28,641
but when it comes
to killing japanese,

170
00:08:28,676 --> 00:08:33,029
i think you'll find me a
pretty efficient officer.

171
00:08:40,903 --> 00:08:42,788
That's a filthy
piece, soldier.

172
00:08:42,823 --> 00:08:45,908
I want clean weapons
in this platoon

173
00:08:45,943 --> 00:08:47,793
because we're
going to kill japs.

174
00:08:48,411 --> 00:08:49,662
That's my job.

175
00:08:49,697 --> 00:08:51,547
This outfit
better shape up.

176
00:08:55,918 --> 00:08:57,920
This one is
bloodthirsty.

177
00:08:57,955 --> 00:09:00,423
You don't think
he'll want us

178
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:02,174
to scalp them?

179
00:09:05,428 --> 00:09:07,930
No sleep or no guts,
which is it?

180
00:09:07,965 --> 00:09:11,067
You're tired of
killing japs, is that it?

181
00:09:11,102 --> 00:09:13,569
Or you just got
no stomach for it?

182
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:16,072
Lieutenant...

183
00:09:16,107 --> 00:09:18,574
we're about
24 months up on you.

184
00:09:18,609 --> 00:09:20,443
Now we've seen enough dead men

185
00:09:20,478 --> 00:09:22,945
to last us for the rest
of our lives.

186
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:26,082
The rest of our lives,
lieutenant, and then some.

187
00:09:26,117 --> 00:09:29,201
Now, you got a big yen
to do some killing?

188
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,704
Okay,
we'll do some killing for you,

189
00:09:31,739 --> 00:09:34,206
but don't ask us
to stand up and cheer.

190
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:09,375
Causarano.

191
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:18,751
Those flamethrowers
arrive yet?

192
00:10:18,786 --> 00:10:20,002
Yes, sir.

193
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:22,505
Figure we can move in
behind the next barrage

194
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,390
and get within 50 yards
of the opening.

195
00:10:24,425 --> 00:10:27,510
Those flamethrowers can do
a lot of damage, can't they?

196
00:10:27,545 --> 00:10:28,761
They can, indeed, sir.

197
00:10:28,796 --> 00:10:30,646
What about
the phosphorous grenades?

198
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:32,515
I'd hate to
be hit by one.

199
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,400
Check with company

200
00:10:34,435 --> 00:10:36,268
about the time
of the next mortar barrage,

201
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:40,022
and we'll move in there.

202
00:10:50,032 --> 00:10:51,283
You're going to have

203
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:52,535
to double-time
this one, sergeant.

204
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:53,786
That is, if you're going
to keep up with me.

205
00:10:53,821 --> 00:10:55,037
Yeah.

206
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:56,288
Well?

207
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:57,540
Nothing, lieutenant.

208
00:10:57,575 --> 00:10:58,791
I'm not your
cup of tea,

209
00:10:58,826 --> 00:11:00,543
am i, sergeant?

210
00:11:00,578 --> 00:11:01,794
You got a little bit

211
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:04,296
too much vinegar
for me, lieutenant.

212
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:09,301
Look, we could
bypass them.

213
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:11,187
There aren't
20 japs in there,

214
00:11:11,222 --> 00:11:13,689
and they're sick
and half-starved.

215
00:11:13,724 --> 00:11:14,940
But they're japs.

216
00:11:14,975 --> 00:11:16,559
They're men,
lieutenant.

217
00:11:16,594 --> 00:11:19,695
You've got a funny
group here, sergeant,

218
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:22,198
and you're the oddball
of the bunch.

219
00:11:22,233 --> 00:11:24,066
If i had to size you up,

220
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:26,569
i'd say you've either
got battle fatigue

221
00:11:26,604 --> 00:11:28,454
or you're chicken.

222
00:11:29,705 --> 00:11:31,574
Well, maybe neither

223
00:11:31,609 --> 00:11:33,459
and maybe a little
bit of both.

224
00:11:33,494 --> 00:11:35,961
I don't know, but
the way i size you...

225
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:38,464
go ahead, sergeant,
how do you size me up?

226
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:42,835
All right. You're
a pea green shavetail

227
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,720
just fresh
from some campus.

228
00:11:44,755 --> 00:11:46,589
You're afraid

229
00:11:46,624 --> 00:11:49,975
you won't bag your limit,
or worse, all shook up

230
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:52,478
because somebody might spot you
as a johnny-come-lately

231
00:11:52,513 --> 00:11:53,729
instead of a killer of men.

232
00:11:53,764 --> 00:11:55,731
I think that
ought to do it.

233
00:11:55,766 --> 00:11:58,234
You asked me, you're
going to get it.

234
00:11:58,269 --> 00:11:59,485
You want to prove your manhood,

235
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,353
but it's a little late
in the day,

236
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:03,856
and there aren't many choices
left as to how to do it.

237
00:12:03,891 --> 00:12:06,358
It all boils down
to that lousy cave

238
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:08,861
full of sick, pitiful,
half-dead losers

239
00:12:08,896 --> 00:12:11,363
and a platoon of
dirty, tired men

240
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:13,866
that have their craw
full of this war.

241
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:15,751
You're a lousy soldier,
and that goes

242
00:12:15,786 --> 00:12:18,871
for the rest
of these poor, sick boys

243
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:20,756
you want me
to bottle-feed.

244
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:23,759
When you fight a war,
you fight a war.

245
00:12:23,794 --> 00:12:26,879
And you kill until
you're ordered to stop.

246
00:12:26,914 --> 00:12:29,381
I got your message,
lieutenant.

247
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,884
There's always someone like you

248
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:35,387
that sneaks in
before they close the door

249
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:37,890
to grind an ax before he gives

250
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:39,525
that final order.

251
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,894
What's your pleasure,
lieutenant?

252
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:45,648
How many men have to die
before you're satisfied?

253
00:12:45,683 --> 00:12:47,650
Offhand, i'd say all of them.

254
00:12:47,685 --> 00:12:50,152
No matter who they are
or where they are,

255
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:52,655
if they're the enemy,
they get it!

256
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:55,157
First day of the war
or last day of the war,

257
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:56,408
they get it!

258
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:10,673
Lieutenant yamuri,

259
00:13:11,173 --> 00:13:13,676
you dropped
your glasses, sir.

260
00:14:29,718 --> 00:14:31,587
Lieutenant yamuri, sir,

261
00:14:31,622 --> 00:14:34,089
that was exceedingly
brave, sir,

262
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:36,592
trying to get at
the americans that way

263
00:14:36,627 --> 00:14:38,477
and single-handedly.

264
00:14:39,728 --> 00:14:42,231
)
The americans?

265
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:48,487
Those are americans
in the cave?

266
00:14:48,522 --> 00:14:50,356
Yes, sir.

267
00:14:50,391 --> 00:14:53,492
We figure there are
20 or 30 of them.

268
00:14:53,527 --> 00:14:55,361
Most of them wounded.

269
00:14:55,396 --> 00:15:00,115
Are you... are you
all right, sir?

270
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,257
Where are we?

271
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:12,011
Who are you?

272
00:15:12,046 --> 00:15:15,130
Who am i, sir?

273
00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:17,633
Sergeant yamasaki.

274
00:15:17,668 --> 00:15:20,135
Are you all right,
lieutenant?

275
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:23,272
Are you...
feeling well?

276
00:15:23,307 --> 00:15:25,774
Where are we?

277
00:15:25,809 --> 00:15:27,643
I asked you a question.

278
00:15:27,678 --> 00:15:28,894
Where are we?!

279
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:30,779
Why... why...

280
00:15:30,814 --> 00:15:33,282
corregidor, sir.

281
00:15:33,317 --> 00:15:35,150
When?

282
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:37,036
When, sir?

283
00:15:37,653 --> 00:15:40,155
You mean, what is
the day's date.

284
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:42,658
May 4, sir.

285
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:47,663
May 4, sir.

286
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:57,056
It can't be may.

287
00:15:57,091 --> 00:15:58,924
It's august.

288
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,809
August 6.

289
00:16:00,844 --> 00:16:02,678
I... humbly ask
the lieutenant

290
00:16:02,713 --> 00:16:04,563
to forgive me,

291
00:16:04,598 --> 00:16:06,432
but i must
correct him.

292
00:16:06,467 --> 00:16:08,934
The day is may 4.

293
00:16:10,819 --> 00:16:12,688
May 4, when?

294
00:16:13,322 --> 00:16:14,573
What year?

295
00:16:14,608 --> 00:16:17,693
The year 1942.

296
00:16:17,728 --> 00:16:18,944
Is...

297
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:21,447
is the lieutenant
all right?

298
00:16:21,482 --> 00:16:25,200
Perhaps... perhaps
a touch of malaria.

299
00:16:27,703 --> 00:16:29,588
What did you call me?

300
00:16:29,623 --> 00:16:32,091
You called me
by a name.

301
00:16:32,126 --> 00:16:33,959
Lieutenant
yamuri, sir.

302
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:36,462
I called you
lieutenant yamuri.

303
00:16:36,497 --> 00:16:40,215
I called you
by your name, sir.

304
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:43,969
No.

305
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:45,220
No!

306
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:46,722
What happened to me?

307
00:16:46,757 --> 00:16:47,973
What's going on?

308
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:49,224
What happened?

309
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:57,733
Yamuri,

310
00:16:57,768 --> 00:16:59,118
are you sick?

311
00:16:59,153 --> 00:17:01,620
I require an answer,
lieutenant.

312
00:17:01,655 --> 00:17:03,489
I asked you
if you were sick.

313
00:17:03,524 --> 00:17:05,124
We shall be moving out shortly,

314
00:17:05,159 --> 00:17:06,992
and if you are too ill to move,

315
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:08,744
we shall
leave you here.

316
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:09,995
Leave me here?

317
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,880
We have
no transport

318
00:17:11,915 --> 00:17:13,749
for the wounded,
lieutenant.

319
00:17:13,784 --> 00:17:16,385
We shall shortly move up,
and you shall remain here.

320
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:21,390
My name is not yamuri,
i swear to you.

321
00:17:21,425 --> 00:17:23,892
Something's happened.

322
00:17:23,927 --> 00:17:25,761
My name is not yamuri.

323
00:17:25,796 --> 00:17:27,646
My name is...

324
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:36,405
i'm all right.

325
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,907
Forgive me, sir.
I'm all right now.

326
00:17:38,942 --> 00:17:40,159
You what?

327
00:17:40,194 --> 00:17:42,661
I was feverish for a moment.

328
00:17:42,696 --> 00:17:44,530
I'm all right now.

329
00:17:44,565 --> 00:17:45,781
You sure?

330
00:17:45,816 --> 00:17:47,032
Yes, sir.

331
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:48,283
Very sure.

332
00:17:48,318 --> 00:17:50,786
Sergeant...

333
00:17:50,821 --> 00:17:53,038
we move out
in five minutes.

334
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:54,289
Yes, sir.

335
00:17:54,324 --> 00:17:55,541
Be ready
in five minutes.

336
00:17:55,576 --> 00:17:59,044
Unfortunately, the artillery
was unable to do its job.

337
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:01,547
We will attack the cave
in force.

338
00:18:01,582 --> 00:18:03,432
Prisoners, sir?

339
00:18:03,467 --> 00:18:04,683
What?

340
00:18:04,718 --> 00:18:06,552
Are we to take
any prisoners

341
00:18:06,587 --> 00:18:07,803
if any surrender?

342
00:18:07,838 --> 00:18:10,305
If any do, i suppose we can.

343
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,557
Yamuri...

344
00:18:11,592 --> 00:18:12,808
take the first
section.

345
00:18:12,843 --> 00:18:14,693
Move forward
very quickly.

346
00:18:14,728 --> 00:18:15,944
Drop down 50 yards

347
00:18:15,979 --> 00:18:17,813
in front of
the opening.

348
00:18:17,848 --> 00:18:19,064
Watch for
my signal.

349
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:21,567
We will cover you
with automatic fire

350
00:18:21,602 --> 00:18:23,452
before you make the attack.

351
00:18:23,487 --> 00:18:25,320
Then section
two and three

352
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:26,572
will follow you in.

353
00:18:26,607 --> 00:18:27,823
Understood?

354
00:18:27,858 --> 00:18:29,074
Yes.

355
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:30,709
I didn't hear you.

356
00:18:30,744 --> 00:18:32,578
I understand, sir.

357
00:18:34,463 --> 00:18:36,965
Your section, sir.

358
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:40,586
You said
there were wounded in there.

359
00:18:40,621 --> 00:18:42,471
I think so,
lieutenant.

360
00:18:42,506 --> 00:18:45,841
When they ran inside,
they were carrying each other.

361
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:48,343
There are no more
than 20 or 30 men inside.

362
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:51,096
It shouldn't be
too difficult.

363
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:52,981
Americans.

364
00:18:53,016 --> 00:18:55,350
20 or 30 americans.

365
00:18:55,385 --> 00:18:57,853
I didn't hear
what you said, yamuri.

366
00:18:57,888 --> 00:19:00,355
What did you just say?

367
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:05,994
There are wounded
in there, sir.

368
00:19:06,029 --> 00:19:07,246
Perhaps...

369
00:19:07,281 --> 00:19:08,497
perhaps what?

370
00:19:08,532 --> 00:19:11,617
Perhaps we can let them
surrender or perhaps...

371
00:19:11,652 --> 00:19:14,119
or? Or what?

372
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:16,004
Or perhaps we can
leave them there-

373
00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:18,507
bypass them.

374
00:19:18,542 --> 00:19:21,009
Bypass them, lieutenant?

375
00:19:21,044 --> 00:19:22,878
Is that tactical?

376
00:19:22,913 --> 00:19:25,380
Or is that some sudden
nugget of compassion

377
00:19:26,014 --> 00:19:27,883
that you have unearthed
in your fever?

378
00:19:27,918 --> 00:19:29,134
But they-they
are wounded.

379
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:30,385
They can't do
us much harm.

380
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,888
Neither can they
sink a battleship,

381
00:19:32,923 --> 00:19:36,024
but nevertheless,
we have to destroy them.

382
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:37,893
A reminder, lieutenant-

383
00:19:37,928 --> 00:19:41,029
the identity
of the men in the cave,

384
00:19:41,064 --> 00:19:43,532
they are americans,
they are enemy-

385
00:19:43,567 --> 00:19:46,034
healthy, wounded,
walking or lying,

386
00:19:46,069 --> 00:19:47,903
they are the enemy.

387
00:19:47,938 --> 00:19:51,039
The japanese army
does not bypass.

388
00:19:51,074 --> 00:19:52,291
The japanese army attacks.

389
00:19:52,326 --> 00:19:56,044
They japanese army
wipes out its opponents.

390
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:57,913
But they are
wounded, sir.

391
00:19:58,547 --> 00:20:01,049
They are wounded
and beaten.

392
00:20:01,084 --> 00:20:02,301
Lieutenant yamuri,

393
00:20:02,336 --> 00:20:06,054
odd that you
should require this reminder,

394
00:20:06,089 --> 00:20:09,808
but the comparative health
and well-being of the enemy-

395
00:20:09,843 --> 00:20:11,677
his comfort
or his discomfort,

396
00:20:11,712 --> 00:20:14,179
the degree of his anguish
or his incapacities-

397
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:16,682
have no more bearing
on a military action,

398
00:20:16,717 --> 00:20:19,184
a tactical move
or a decision of command

399
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:20,435
than the fortunes
of an anthill

400
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:22,938
that you step on
when we move out to attack.

401
00:20:22,973 --> 00:20:24,189
They are the enemy.

402
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:26,074
They are american.

403
00:20:26,109 --> 00:20:27,326
If, when we enter the cave

404
00:20:27,361 --> 00:20:29,828
and they are lying
on the ground,

405
00:20:29,863 --> 00:20:31,079
i can assure you

406
00:20:31,114 --> 00:20:32,948
i will have
no more compunction

407
00:20:32,983 --> 00:20:34,833
about making them
a head shorter

408
00:20:34,868 --> 00:20:37,336
than i would stepping
on that anthill.

409
00:20:37,371 --> 00:20:38,587
But they are men.

410
00:20:38,622 --> 00:20:41,089
They are enemy,
and this is war,

411
00:20:41,124 --> 00:20:42,341
and in war, you kill.

412
00:20:42,376 --> 00:20:43,592
You kill, lieutenant.

413
00:20:43,627 --> 00:20:45,460
You kill until
you are ordered

414
00:20:45,495 --> 00:20:46,094
to stop killing.

415
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:47,963
You kill until you
are ordered

416
00:20:47,998 --> 00:20:49,214
to stop killing.

417
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:50,465
No!

418
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:56,104
Sections, assemble.

419
00:20:56,139 --> 00:20:57,356
Sergeant yamasaki,

420
00:20:57,391 --> 00:20:59,858
you will handle
the first section.

421
00:20:59,893 --> 00:21:01,109
Sergeant hiro,

422
00:21:01,144 --> 00:21:02,978
you will take
the second section.

423
00:21:03,013 --> 00:21:04,229
Lieutenant ishimoto,

424
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:06,114
yours is
the third section.

425
00:21:06,149 --> 00:21:07,983
All right?
We move out.

426
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:17,993
I will take care of
you when we return.

427
00:21:18,028 --> 00:21:19,244
Captain!

428
00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:24,249
What you do to those men
in the cave...

429
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:27,135
will it shorten the war
by a week,

430
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:30,255
by a day, by an hour?

431
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,758
May i ask the captain

432
00:21:32,793 --> 00:21:34,643
what is his pleasure?

433
00:21:34,678 --> 00:21:36,511
How many must die

434
00:21:36,546 --> 00:21:37,763
before
he's satisfied?

435
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:39,648
Offhand, lieutenant yamuri,

436
00:21:39,683 --> 00:21:41,400
i would say all of them.

437
00:21:41,435 --> 00:21:43,902
I don't care where they are
or who they are.

438
00:21:43,937 --> 00:21:47,022
If they are the enemy,
they are to be destroyed.

439
00:21:47,057 --> 00:21:50,776
First day of the war,
last day of the war,

440
00:21:51,026 --> 00:21:52,277
we destroy them!

441
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:15,300
Any time you say,
lieutenant.

442
00:22:19,688 --> 00:22:21,556
Any time you say,
lieutenant.

443
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:24,059
Form lines for
the duck shoot.

444
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:35,320
Causarano...

445
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:42,210
something happened.

446
00:22:42,245 --> 00:22:43,462
Something...

447
00:22:43,497 --> 00:22:44,713
lieutenant katell.

448
00:22:44,748 --> 00:22:45,964
Orders, lieutenant.

449
00:22:45,999 --> 00:22:47,833
They want us
off the hill.

450
00:22:47,868 --> 00:22:49,084
Who says?

451
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:51,586
Colonel hardin
at headquarters.

452
00:22:51,621 --> 00:22:53,221
The air force
dropped a bomb

453
00:22:53,256 --> 00:22:55,090
on japan
this morning.

454
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:56,975
They call it
an atomic bomb.

455
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:58,844
Hello. What's
all this about?

456
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:02,481
They figure the bomb
will end the war

457
00:23:02,516 --> 00:23:04,349
in a of couple days.

458
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:06,234
They want the units
to pull back

459
00:23:06,269 --> 00:23:08,103
and see
what happens.

460
00:23:08,138 --> 00:23:10,605
Let's get ready
to move out of here.

461
00:23:13,742 --> 00:23:14,993
You with us,
lieutenant?

462
00:23:18,148 --> 00:23:20,615
Yeah, i'm with you.

463
00:23:22,751 --> 00:23:25,871
Is it something,
lieutenant?

464
00:23:27,756 --> 00:23:30,258
Yeah, it's something.

465
00:23:32,127 --> 00:23:33,378
Well, i
wouldn't fret.

466
00:23:33,413 --> 00:23:35,263
There'll
be other caves

467
00:23:35,298 --> 00:23:36,515
and other wars,

468
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:39,017
other human beings
you can knock off.

469
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:43,388
I hope not.

470
00:23:43,423 --> 00:23:46,525
God help us, i hope not.

471
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:51,530
"The quality of mercy
is not strained.

472
00:23:51,565 --> 00:23:54,032
"It droppeth as the gentle rain
from heaven

473
00:23:54,067 --> 00:23:55,901
"upon the place beneath.

474
00:23:55,936 --> 00:23:59,654
It blesseth him that gives
and him that takes."

475
00:23:59,689 --> 00:24:02,157
Shakespeare,

476
00:24:02,192 --> 00:24:04,659
but applicable to any moment
in time

477
00:24:04,694 --> 00:24:07,162
to any group of soldiery,
to any nation

478
00:24:07,197 --> 00:24:09,047
on the face of the earth,

479
00:24:09,664 --> 00:24:12,167
or, as in this case,
to the twilight zone.

480
00:24:15,003 --> 00:24:17,222
Rod serling,
creator ofthe twilight zone,

481
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:19,724
will tell you
about next week's story

482
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:23,512
after this message.

483
00:24:23,547 --> 00:24:25,063
And now, mr. Serling.

484
00:24:25,098 --> 00:24:28,817
Next week, an excursion into the
shadowland of the hereafter.

485
00:24:28,852 --> 00:24:31,319
Miss gladys cooper
and mr. Robert redford

486
00:24:31,354 --> 00:24:32,571
combine sizeable talents

487
00:24:32,606 --> 00:24:34,439
to bring you a script
by george clayton johnson

488
00:24:35,073 --> 00:24:36,942
entitled, "nothing in the dark."

489
00:24:36,977 --> 00:24:38,827
The dark, in this case,

490
00:24:38,862 --> 00:24:41,329
being the little nooks,
crannies and closets

491
00:24:41,364 --> 00:24:43,832
of those regions
presided over by mr. Death.

492
00:24:43,867 --> 00:24:48,203
I hope you'll be with us next
week for "nothing in the dark."

493
00:25:18,149 --> 00:25:21,870
Our population's expanding
faster than our colleges.

494
00:25:21,905 --> 00:25:24,372
For more classrooms
and finest professors,

495
00:25:24,407 --> 00:25:26,875
help the college
of your choice.
