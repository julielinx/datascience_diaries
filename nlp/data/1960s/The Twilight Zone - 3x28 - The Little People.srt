1
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:12,262
You're traveling
through another dimension-

2
00:00:12,297 --> 00:00:15,382
a dimension not only of sight
and sound, but of mind,

3
00:00:15,417 --> 00:00:17,267
a journey into a wondrous land

4
00:00:17,302 --> 00:00:19,135
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

5
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,272
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

6
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:49,799
Well, how
did you do?

7
00:00:49,834 --> 00:00:51,668
It's repairable.

8
00:00:51,703 --> 00:00:54,671
But i won't be able to touch
any of those gimbal bearings

9
00:00:54,706 --> 00:00:55,922
until they cool off.

10
00:00:55,957 --> 00:00:57,807
It's like a furnace
in there now.

11
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:02,929
And that grand moment
will come when?

12
00:01:02,964 --> 00:01:04,314
Maybe tomorrow night...

13
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:06,182
the following morning.

14
00:01:07,852 --> 00:01:10,937
That's a swig
from the old bottle, isn't it?

15
00:01:10,972 --> 00:01:15,325
Oh, you sure picked a nice place
to set down, fletcher-

16
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,193
the floor of a canyon.

17
00:01:17,228 --> 00:01:20,330
I took you to the first mass
of land that loomed up.

18
00:01:20,365 --> 00:01:22,198
And just for the record,
mr. Craig,

19
00:01:22,233 --> 00:01:25,335
i didn't pepper the nose of
that vehicle with meteor holes.

20
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:27,837
I also didn't foul up
those rocket boosters.

21
00:01:27,872 --> 00:01:29,706
That's something
you can chalk up to nature.

22
00:01:29,741 --> 00:01:31,458
All right, all right.

23
00:01:31,493 --> 00:01:35,845
It just strikes me as kind of
a deadhead place to set down-

24
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,348
on the floor
of a canyon.

25
00:01:40,216 --> 00:01:45,221
"Food concentrate, comma,
able-1-6-3, comma-

26
00:01:45,256 --> 00:01:47,724
modified dinner plan."

27
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,478
Whoever invented
this stuff

28
00:01:51,513 --> 00:01:53,363
must have had
stomach trouble.

29
00:01:53,398 --> 00:01:55,231
A very bitter
character

30
00:01:55,266 --> 00:01:57,117
with no compassion
for his fellow men

31
00:01:57,734 --> 00:01:58,368
or their stomachs.

32
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,373
Oh, there may come
a moment in time

33
00:02:03,408 --> 00:02:05,241
when i'll enjoy this.

34
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:10,246
There may come a moment
when you'll lick a rock

35
00:02:10,281 --> 00:02:12,132
as if it were
a thanksgiving turkey,

36
00:02:12,749 --> 00:02:14,000
but for the time
being, buddy,

37
00:02:14,035 --> 00:02:16,503
you'll eat
what is prescribed to eat!

38
00:02:16,538 --> 00:02:18,388
If you've got
any set of complaints,

39
00:02:18,423 --> 00:02:20,256
you put them down
in a ledger;

40
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:22,142
don't spray them
all over me!

41
00:02:22,177 --> 00:02:24,010
It's a waste
of effort.

42
00:02:24,045 --> 00:02:26,513
It's also dull,
and it's tough to live with.

43
00:02:26,548 --> 00:02:27,764
You read me, craig?

44
00:02:27,799 --> 00:02:29,649
Loud and clear.

45
00:02:29,684 --> 00:02:31,518
Then dwell on it!

46
00:02:31,553 --> 00:02:33,403
And while
you're dwelling on it

47
00:02:33,438 --> 00:02:35,271
you might count
a few blessings.

48
00:02:35,306 --> 00:02:37,157
We don't have
much food or water,

49
00:02:37,192 --> 00:02:39,659
but we landed in a place
where there's oxygen

50
00:02:39,694 --> 00:02:40,910
and we can survive.

51
00:02:40,945 --> 00:02:42,162
We walked away from it

52
00:02:42,197 --> 00:02:44,030
without a single bone
out of place.

53
00:02:44,065 --> 00:02:45,665
The standing order
is as follows:

54
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,168
You got tears to shed,
save them for night

55
00:02:48,203 --> 00:02:50,036
and weep them
into your pillow.

56
00:02:50,071 --> 00:02:51,287
Don't bother me
with them!

57
00:02:51,322 --> 00:02:53,289
Now how do you read me?

58
00:02:53,324 --> 00:02:58,294
Still loud and
clear, commander.

59
00:02:59,796 --> 00:03:01,681
But there are times

60
00:03:01,716 --> 00:03:03,550
when a man gets
sick to death

61
00:03:03,585 --> 00:03:06,052
of being led around
by the nose.

62
00:03:06,087 --> 00:03:10,440
That's a big thing with
you, isn't it, craig?

63
00:03:10,475 --> 00:03:11,691
What is?

64
00:03:11,726 --> 00:03:12,942
Taking orders,

65
00:03:12,977 --> 00:03:15,445
being on the receiving
end of a command.

66
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,947
It's hard for you to
live with, isn't it?

67
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:22,318
If i had my druthers

68
00:03:22,353 --> 00:03:24,204
i might stick in
a few changes.

69
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:25,455
Hmm, like what?

70
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:26,706
Say again?

71
00:03:26,741 --> 00:03:29,209
I mean, beyond us
getting out of here.

72
00:03:29,244 --> 00:03:31,711
Let's say this is
the end of the line.

73
00:03:31,746 --> 00:03:34,214
Now, how would you
sweeten the pot?

74
00:03:34,249 --> 00:03:36,082
A sirloin steak,
a blonde, what?

75
00:03:36,117 --> 00:03:38,585
How about
mumblety-peg, fletcher?

76
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,836
Or maybe 20 questions?

77
00:03:39,871 --> 00:03:41,721
Look, try me
after dinner...

78
00:03:41,756 --> 00:03:43,590
i may feel up
to charades.

79
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:46,092
Point of interest
is all.

80
00:03:46,127 --> 00:03:49,846
I'm just interested
in what makes you tick.

81
00:03:49,881 --> 00:03:53,600
Or maybe it's what makes
you tick so loudly.

82
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,736
What do you hunger
for most, craig?

83
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,997
Try this one, fletch...

84
00:04:08,032 --> 00:04:12,368
i'd like a whole lot
of people at my elbow:

85
00:04:12,403 --> 00:04:14,254
The more the merrier,

86
00:04:14,289 --> 00:04:16,756
the louder the better,

87
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:21,127
and i'd like yankee stadium
right alongside.

88
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,630
But i'd like them on my terms.

89
00:04:23,665 --> 00:04:26,132
That's what i'm getting at.

90
00:04:26,167 --> 00:04:28,635
What are your terms?

91
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:33,022
I'd like to be
the number one straw boss.

92
00:04:33,057 --> 00:04:35,525
I'dlike to give the orders.

93
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:38,027
Uh-huh...

94
00:04:38,062 --> 00:04:40,530
i'll bet you would.

95
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,169
What's the
matter?

96
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:06,923
What's the
matter with you?

97
00:05:08,174 --> 00:05:09,425
Did you hear that?

98
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:12,562
Hear what?

99
00:05:12,597 --> 00:05:14,430
That sound.

100
00:05:14,465 --> 00:05:15,682
What sound?

101
00:05:15,717 --> 00:05:17,684
Fletch, i heard something...

102
00:05:17,719 --> 00:05:19,569
i... i heard a sound...

103
00:05:19,604 --> 00:05:21,437
a sound like... like...

104
00:05:23,358 --> 00:05:24,574
a sound
like what?

105
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:31,447
Voices.

106
00:05:31,482 --> 00:05:32,699
People.

107
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,086
The time is the space age.

108
00:05:37,121 --> 00:05:40,840
The place is a barren landscape
of a rock-walled canyon

109
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:43,960
that lies millions of miles
from the planet earth.

110
00:05:43,995 --> 00:05:46,462
The cast of characters?
You've met them-

111
00:05:46,497 --> 00:05:48,965
william fletcher,
commander of the spaceship;

112
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,850
his copilot, peter craig.

113
00:05:50,885 --> 00:05:54,604
The other characters who inhabit
this place you may never see,

114
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,855
but they're there,

115
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:57,724
as these two gentlemen
will soon find out.

116
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,860
Because they're about to partake
in a little exploration

117
00:06:00,895 --> 00:06:05,231
into that gray, shaded area
in space and time

118
00:06:05,266 --> 00:06:08,368
that's known
as the twilight zone.

119
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:30,256
Well, where has
my wandering boy been

120
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:31,507
most of the day?

121
00:06:31,542 --> 00:06:34,644
You take a lot
of walks, buddy.

122
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:38,648
Something better to do?

123
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,768
Yeah, there is.

124
00:06:41,803 --> 00:06:44,904
Like, uh,
checking over a radio,

125
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:46,773
like looking over
a hydraulic system,

126
00:06:46,808 --> 00:06:49,275
a propulsion system,
an ejection system,

127
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,526
a thrust chamber.

128
00:06:50,561 --> 00:06:53,029
Yeah, there are a few things.

129
00:06:53,064 --> 00:06:58,034
Where are you spending most
of your time these days?

130
00:06:58,069 --> 00:07:00,536
Still hearing
your voices?

131
00:07:00,571 --> 00:07:02,422
Maybe.

132
00:07:02,457 --> 00:07:06,042
You know, i think it would be
an exceptionally good idea

133
00:07:06,077 --> 00:07:08,544
if you'd get to work
on those charts again.

134
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:27,947
It's hot, isn't it?

135
00:07:27,982 --> 00:07:31,067
Passable.

136
00:07:31,102 --> 00:07:33,453
You some kind of a camel, craig?

137
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:36,572
What do you mean?

138
00:07:36,607 --> 00:07:39,459
I haven't seen you
take any water.

139
00:07:39,494 --> 00:07:41,828
Well, uh...

140
00:07:41,863 --> 00:07:44,580
i'm a whiskey man myself,
or hadn't you noticed?

141
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:47,717
You're going to have
to do better than that.

142
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:53,339
Why, what gives,
craig?

143
00:07:53,374 --> 00:07:54,590
Say again?

144
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:55,842
Your ears
don't lap.

145
00:07:55,877 --> 00:07:58,978
Your water hasn't been
touched in 24 hours.

146
00:07:59,013 --> 00:08:00,847
Now, you couldn't
have discovered

147
00:08:00,882 --> 00:08:02,732
any mountain
stream up there

148
00:08:02,767 --> 00:08:04,600
and kept it all
for your lonesome?

149
00:08:04,635 --> 00:08:06,486
Why don't you
talk sense...

150
00:08:06,521 --> 00:08:07,737
why don't you?!

151
00:08:07,772 --> 00:08:08,988
For the last
two days

152
00:08:09,023 --> 00:08:10,857
you've been taking
off on safari

153
00:08:10,892 --> 00:08:13,993
every morning when
that double sun comes up.

154
00:08:14,028 --> 00:08:15,244
Where do you go, craig,

155
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:18,364
and what do you find
wherever it is you do go?

156
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:20,249
I'll tell you what...

157
00:08:20,284 --> 00:08:23,369
let's you and me make
that trek together, huh?

158
00:08:23,404 --> 00:08:25,872
Thanks, but no thanks.

159
00:08:27,123 --> 00:08:28,374
I'm tired.

160
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,259
Look, craig...

161
00:08:39,135 --> 00:08:40,386
where'd you find this?

162
00:08:40,421 --> 00:08:42,271
Uh, i... i... i told you-

163
00:08:42,306 --> 00:08:44,140
i've been
looking around.

164
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:49,779
It's wet.

165
00:08:49,814 --> 00:08:51,647
You found water,
didn't you?

166
00:08:51,682 --> 00:08:52,899
Where?

167
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,401
About a
mile ahead...

168
00:08:55,436 --> 00:08:57,286
it's just a crummy
little stream...

169
00:08:57,321 --> 00:08:59,789
but enough for you
to drink out of!

170
00:08:59,824 --> 00:09:01,040
Aw, come on, fletch,

171
00:09:01,075 --> 00:09:02,909
i was going to
show it to you.

172
00:09:02,944 --> 00:09:05,411
As a matter of fact,
i've been testing it.

173
00:09:05,446 --> 00:09:08,548
I just found out it was
pure a little bit ago.

174
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:11,050
You know,
i underrated you, mister.

175
00:09:11,085 --> 00:09:12,919
I knew you were
a grousing malcontent,

176
00:09:12,954 --> 00:09:15,421
but i didn't know
you were a cheat!

177
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,682
It's just a variety
of lichen...

178
00:09:26,717 --> 00:09:28,568
you don't mind
if i look at it

179
00:09:28,603 --> 00:09:30,436
through the
magnifier, do you?

180
00:09:30,471 --> 00:09:32,321
Or have you done
that already?

181
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:57,213
Trees.

182
00:09:57,248 --> 00:10:02,718
Yes, that's what they are...
trees.

183
00:10:02,753 --> 00:10:05,855
I might as well go
the whole route now.

184
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:09,609
They were alongside
of a stream...

185
00:10:09,644 --> 00:10:11,477
it runs about 100 feet.

186
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:15,615
It's about
2½ inches wide.

187
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:18,985
If you think that's something...

188
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,236
look at this.

189
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:29,629
Look at it!

190
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:41,891
Then...

191
00:10:41,926 --> 00:10:43,759
the voices?

192
00:10:43,794 --> 00:10:46,262
You want to see
more, fletch?

193
00:10:46,297 --> 00:10:48,147
Yeah... yeah,
i sure do.

194
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,901
Come on.

195
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:23,049
It's fantastic.

196
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,804
To us, that stream
is just a stream.

197
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:33,059
That clump of little green weeds
is so much moss.

198
00:11:33,094 --> 00:11:36,195
But they are trees,
and that stream is a river,

199
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:38,698
and if you look closely-

200
00:11:38,733 --> 00:11:39,565
i mean, really close-

201
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,450
you'll see a
couple of items

202
00:11:41,485 --> 00:11:44,320
that aren't par
for the course.

203
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,711
It's incredible.

204
00:11:51,746 --> 00:11:54,830
It's a whole race of people
no bigger than ants.

205
00:11:54,865 --> 00:11:57,717
Yeah, a whole
race of people.

206
00:11:57,752 --> 00:12:00,219
And while you were
preoccupying yourself

207
00:12:00,254 --> 00:12:02,088
with gluing
together an engine

208
00:12:02,123 --> 00:12:03,339
i was making contact.

209
00:12:03,374 --> 00:12:04,590
In their language?

210
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:07,093
I don't know it yet,
and they don't know ours,

211
00:12:07,128 --> 00:12:08,978
but they know mathematics.

212
00:12:09,013 --> 00:12:10,846
That's the language i've used-

213
00:12:10,881 --> 00:12:13,349
symbols, equations,
number progressions.

214
00:12:13,384 --> 00:12:15,851
And they're bright,
they learn fast.

215
00:12:15,886 --> 00:12:17,103
And cooperative, fletch!

216
00:12:17,138 --> 00:12:20,239
You wouldn't believe
how cooperative they are!

217
00:12:20,274 --> 00:12:22,108
I've told them all my wants.

218
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:24,610
They've shown me where
the edible plants are.

219
00:12:24,645 --> 00:12:27,113
Last night,
i ate up one of their forests.

220
00:12:27,148 --> 00:12:29,615
What else did you tell them?

221
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:30,866
Oh, basic stuff:

222
00:12:30,901 --> 00:12:33,002
Where we're from,
how we got here,

223
00:12:33,037 --> 00:12:36,756
what's it's like on earth,
how advanced we are.

224
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:41,127
But i've only scratched
the surface, fletcher.

225
00:12:41,162 --> 00:12:43,012
I've only just begun.

226
00:12:45,881 --> 00:12:47,133
Begun what?

227
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,388
What do you think?

228
00:12:52,423 --> 00:12:54,273
All my life
i've wanted to sit

229
00:12:54,308 --> 00:12:56,776
in front of the wagon
and hold the reins.

230
00:12:56,811 --> 00:12:59,895
Well, what do you think
i've got here now?

231
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:01,147
A whole race
of little people

232
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,283
who look up to me like
a giant out of the sky.

233
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:08,654
They're scared,
fletch, petrified.

234
00:13:08,689 --> 00:13:11,157
And so they do
what they're told.

235
00:13:11,192 --> 00:13:12,408
Because this giant...

236
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,544
is like some avenging
angel to them.

237
00:13:15,579 --> 00:13:21,167
I've graduated, fletcher,
from a slob with a slide rule

238
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,920
to... to...

239
00:13:24,955 --> 00:13:28,674
to a god.

240
00:13:28,709 --> 00:13:29,925
Craig, they're people.

241
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,811
They're flesh and blood.

242
00:13:31,846 --> 00:13:34,313
They're no different than us!

243
00:13:34,348 --> 00:13:35,681
Sure they are.

244
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:40,686
Because they've been created
inmyimage.

245
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:52,448
Stop it!

246
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:56,202
You're no god, craig.

247
00:13:56,237 --> 00:13:58,087
That's not what
you are at all!

248
00:13:59,955 --> 00:14:01,841
The only trouble
is that...

249
00:14:01,876 --> 00:14:03,709
by now you've probably
gotten them

250
00:14:03,744 --> 00:14:05,594
to believe in the devil.

251
00:14:07,498 --> 00:14:08,714
I'm sorry.

252
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:13,102
I'm truly sorry.

253
00:14:13,137 --> 00:14:14,970
Please forgive us.

254
00:14:15,005 --> 00:14:16,856
Forgive us, please.

255
00:14:49,505 --> 00:14:52,641
Craig!

256
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:05,154
Craig!

257
00:15:07,022 --> 00:15:09,525
Craig!

258
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:33,933
Top of the morning,
commander.

259
00:15:33,968 --> 00:15:35,184
Hear what i said?

260
00:15:35,219 --> 00:15:37,686
Top of the morning,
commander.

261
00:15:37,721 --> 00:15:43,309
Even gods have to observe
some of the amenities.

262
00:15:43,344 --> 00:15:45,194
Good likeness, huh?

263
00:15:47,062 --> 00:15:49,565
The little people
did that.

264
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,319
They did it overnight.

265
00:15:53,354 --> 00:15:55,070
Ah, you should
have seen them.

266
00:15:55,105 --> 00:15:57,573
A very impressive sight,
commander.

267
00:15:57,608 --> 00:15:59,575
A thousand of them
working from the ground up

268
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:02,077
like the egyptian slaves
on the pyramids,

269
00:16:02,112 --> 00:16:04,580
like the lilliputians
with gulliver.

270
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:08,717
A very impressive sight,
commander.

271
00:16:08,752 --> 00:16:11,220
What do you give them
in return, craig?

272
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:16,225
My smiling beneficence.

273
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:19,345
I won't tramp my feet down
on their town.

274
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:24,850
They picked themselves
a corker of a deity.

275
00:16:24,885 --> 00:16:27,353
It's too bad they don't know

276
00:16:27,388 --> 00:16:29,238
who they're breaking
their backs for.

277
00:16:29,273 --> 00:16:30,489
Meaning what?

278
00:16:30,524 --> 00:16:32,608
They're worshipping
a heartless slob

279
00:16:32,643 --> 00:16:35,110
whose insides are the
same as that statue's!

280
00:16:35,145 --> 00:16:36,996
Yeah, it's a good
likeness, craig.

281
00:16:37,031 --> 00:16:39,498
And an hour from now
they can sell it for junk!

282
00:16:39,533 --> 00:16:41,367
Now, let's get
back to the ship,

283
00:16:41,402 --> 00:16:42,618
we're taking off.

284
00:16:42,653 --> 00:16:44,503
What do
you mean?

285
00:16:44,538 --> 00:16:45,754
The ship's repaired.

286
00:16:45,789 --> 00:16:47,006
We'll start
the countdown

287
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:48,507
in 15 minutes.

288
00:16:49,124 --> 00:16:51,010
The orbital position
here is perfect.

289
00:16:51,627 --> 00:16:52,878
You fixed the ship?

290
00:16:52,913 --> 00:16:55,631
Yeah, i did, ineed.

291
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:56,882
And a hundred years from now,

292
00:16:56,917 --> 00:16:59,385
when your little friends
realize how they got taken,

293
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,636
and that i'm the guy

294
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:02,521
that removed you
from their lives,

295
00:17:02,556 --> 00:17:05,641
who knows...

296
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:10,029
...maybe they'll
build a statue to me.

297
00:17:10,064 --> 00:17:11,897
Now it's a pity

298
00:17:11,932 --> 00:17:14,149
they can't capture
that look, craig,

299
00:17:14,184 --> 00:17:16,035
that clinical look.

300
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:22,157
Sick, scared little man,
full of delusions of grandeur.

301
00:17:22,192 --> 00:17:24,660
Let's go, buddy,
we haven't a...

302
00:17:29,164 --> 00:17:31,800
this one you'll have to navigate
on your own.

303
00:17:31,835 --> 00:17:33,669
Put the gun away, craig.

304
00:17:33,704 --> 00:17:36,805
After i see you climb
aboard that ship

305
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,057
and take off.

306
00:17:38,092 --> 00:17:39,925
Throw your gun
over here.

307
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,815
Sick, sure, but just how sick
i didn't realize.

308
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:50,185
You've only got
about 12 minutes, commander.

309
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,688
You can waste them
psychoanalyzing me

310
00:17:52,723 --> 00:17:54,573
or you can play it smart,

311
00:17:54,608 --> 00:17:56,442
get aboard
that ship

312
00:17:56,477 --> 00:17:57,693
and head
for home.

313
00:17:57,728 --> 00:18:00,829
I'm staying behind.

314
00:18:00,864 --> 00:18:02,581
Why, craig?

315
00:18:02,616 --> 00:18:04,450
Reason this one out, will you?

316
00:18:04,485 --> 00:18:06,335
Will you reason this one out?

317
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:08,837
You'll play make-believe
for another 48 hours,

318
00:18:08,872 --> 00:18:10,706
then you're going
to crack wide open.

319
00:18:10,741 --> 00:18:13,459
Yeah, you'll have
a million little microbes

320
00:18:13,494 --> 00:18:15,961
honoring you
with torchlight parades,

321
00:18:15,996 --> 00:18:19,214
but you're going to die
of loneliness, buddy.

322
00:18:19,249 --> 00:18:21,100
Come on...

323
00:18:21,135 --> 00:18:23,602
put the gun away
and come with me, huh?

324
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,855
Did you hear what i said?

325
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:33,729
You're down to eight minutes,
commander.

326
00:18:33,764 --> 00:18:37,483
If you're still here
eight minutes from now,

327
00:18:37,518 --> 00:18:39,985
i'm going to have to kill you.

328
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,621
This is
a monotheistic
society here-

329
00:18:43,238 --> 00:18:46,375
just room for one god.

330
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:48,877
Take off!

331
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:53,999
Craig, i feel sorry
for you, buddy.

332
00:18:54,034 --> 00:18:55,250
I really do.

333
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,947
All right, my little friends,

334
00:19:58,982 --> 00:20:03,452
comes now the new age.

335
00:20:03,487 --> 00:20:07,206
The age of...

336
00:20:07,241 --> 00:20:09,708
the age of peter craig.

337
00:20:21,336 --> 00:20:23,222
Oh, my little friends,

338
00:20:23,257 --> 00:20:25,724
we've got
a lot of plans to make.

339
00:20:27,628 --> 00:20:30,729
A lot of projects to work out.

340
00:20:30,764 --> 00:20:33,232
Much work.

341
00:20:33,267 --> 00:20:38,237
A whole lot of work.

342
00:20:45,145 --> 00:20:48,247
That's a reminder,
little friends,

343
00:20:48,282 --> 00:20:50,115
there must be discipline here.

344
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:54,503
Discipline above all.

345
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,010
There'll be periodic moments

346
00:21:02,045 --> 00:21:05,130
where i must remind you
that you must not anger me.

347
00:21:05,165 --> 00:21:07,015
That's important now.

348
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:10,135
You must not anger me.

349
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:45,170
Let us begin
to build the statue again.

350
00:21:45,205 --> 00:21:48,307
Let us to commence to begin.

351
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:02,321
It's just a ship,
that's all it is.

352
00:22:03,607 --> 00:22:09,194
Now, if you keep quiet,
they'll go away, understand?

353
00:22:09,229 --> 00:22:11,697
If you just keep quiet,
it'll go away.

354
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:42,861
See, i told you
it would go away.

355
00:22:57,993 --> 00:23:00,379
Go away!

356
00:23:00,414 --> 00:23:02,247
You can't stay here!

357
00:23:02,282 --> 00:23:04,132
Go away!

358
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:11,506
Don't you understand?!

359
00:23:11,541 --> 00:23:13,392
I'm the god!

360
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:18,397
I'm the god,
don't you understand?!

361
00:23:18,432 --> 00:23:20,649
I'm the god!

362
00:23:26,807 --> 00:23:28,657
What have you got?

363
00:23:28,692 --> 00:23:30,525
A man.

364
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,778
A tiny little man.

365
00:23:32,813 --> 00:23:34,162
Why, you've crushed
him to death.

366
00:23:34,197 --> 00:23:35,414
I didn't mean to.

367
00:23:35,449 --> 00:23:36,665
Say, do you suppose

368
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,533
there are more
of them down there?

369
00:23:38,568 --> 00:23:40,419
I don't know. What's
the difference?

370
00:23:40,454 --> 00:23:41,670
We're not
here exploring.

371
00:23:41,705 --> 00:23:44,172
We're here
making repairs.

372
00:23:44,207 --> 00:23:46,675
Come on, come on,
let's get out of here.

373
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:05,310
The case
of navigator peter craig-

374
00:24:05,345 --> 00:24:07,195
a victim of a delusion.

375
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:10,949
In this case, the dream dies
a little harder than the man.

376
00:24:10,984 --> 00:24:13,452
A small exercise
in space psychology

377
00:24:13,487 --> 00:24:18,457
that you can try on for size
in the twilight zone.

378
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,744
Rod serling,
creator ofthe twilight zone,

379
00:24:22,779 --> 00:24:25,247
will tell you
about next week's story

380
00:24:25,282 --> 00:24:28,450
after this message.

381
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:30,502
And now, mr. Serling.

382
00:24:30,537 --> 00:24:33,638
Next week, an exceptionally fine
actor named theodore bikel

383
00:24:33,673 --> 00:24:34,890
portrays a misguided kook

384
00:24:34,925 --> 00:24:38,643
who fancies himself some kind
of guardian of law and order.

385
00:24:38,678 --> 00:24:40,512
He decides
that it's his mission in life

386
00:24:40,547 --> 00:24:42,397
to eradicate evil
the world over.

387
00:24:42,432 --> 00:24:43,648
Now this one is told
very far out,

388
00:24:43,683 --> 00:24:44,900
but considering
the nature of the times,

389
00:24:44,935 --> 00:24:46,768
it happens to be very close in.

390
00:24:46,803 --> 00:24:48,653
Next week,
an exercise in insanity.

391
00:24:48,688 --> 00:24:49,905
It's called "four o'clock."

392
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:52,407
Set your watches and come on in.

393
00:24:52,442 --> 00:24:54,910
This cigarette-
chesterfield king-

394
00:24:54,945 --> 00:24:58,029
gives all the advantages
of extra length and much more.

395
00:24:58,064 --> 00:25:00,532
The great taste
of 21 vintage tobaccos

396
00:25:00,567 --> 00:25:03,034
grown mild, aged mild
and blended mild.

397
00:25:03,069 --> 00:25:07,422
No wonder they satisfy
so completely.

398
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:38,870
This is james arness.

399
00:25:38,905 --> 00:25:40,739
You know, it's only a short hop

400
00:25:40,774 --> 00:25:43,241
fromthe twilight zone
to dodge city ingunsmoke.

401
00:25:43,276 --> 00:25:46,628
Saturday nights
over most of these stations.
