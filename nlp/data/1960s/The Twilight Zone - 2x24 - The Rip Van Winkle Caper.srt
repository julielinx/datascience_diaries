1
00:00:10,211 --> 00:00:12,679
You're traveling
through another dimension

2
00:00:12,714 --> 00:00:15,815
a dimension not only
of sight and sound, but of mind

3
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:17,684
a journey into a wondrous land

4
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:19,569
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

5
00:00:19,604 --> 00:00:21,438
That's the signpost up ahead.

6
00:00:21,473 --> 00:00:24,574
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

7
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:08,485
Good work, gentlemen.

8
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,370
Apples in the barrel.

9
00:01:10,405 --> 00:01:10,987
Yeah, so far,

10
00:01:11,022 --> 00:01:12,872
but we ain't
spent anything yet.

11
00:01:12,907 --> 00:01:14,741
Yeah, you know
brooks is right.

12
00:01:14,776 --> 00:01:16,626
$1 million worth
of gold bullion,

13
00:01:16,661 --> 00:01:18,495
and i'm still
wearing coveralls,

14
00:01:19,129 --> 00:01:20,997
and i got $1.20
in my pocket.

15
00:01:21,032 --> 00:01:23,500
That's this year,
senor decruz.

16
00:01:23,535 --> 00:01:26,002
Today, this,
but tomorrow...

17
00:01:26,636 --> 00:01:31,007
tomorrow, gentlemen...
like croesus, midas

18
00:01:31,042 --> 00:01:32,258
and all rolled
into one.

19
00:01:32,293 --> 00:01:34,144
Man, you see that
train engineer

20
00:01:34,179 --> 00:01:35,395
when he hit
them brakes?

21
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,012
He looked like
he thought

22
00:01:36,047 --> 00:01:37,897
the world was
coming to an end.

23
00:01:37,932 --> 00:01:38,515
Why not?

24
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:40,400
When i blow up tracks,
i blow up tracks.

25
00:01:40,435 --> 00:01:42,902
Point out a foundry
for me, decruz,

26
00:01:42,937 --> 00:01:44,020
i'll forge
you a medal.

27
00:01:44,055 --> 00:01:46,523
Oh, come on, come on,
look out, look out.

28
00:01:46,558 --> 00:01:47,774
Get out of the way.

29
00:01:47,809 --> 00:01:49,909
What's your
trouble, brooks?

30
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:51,778
May we get to
business now?

31
00:01:51,813 --> 00:01:53,029
Let's get the carts

32
00:01:53,064 --> 00:01:54,914
and start
unloading.

33
00:01:58,034 --> 00:01:59,919
Come on, come on.

34
00:02:01,171 --> 00:02:01,788
Down.

35
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:07,427
Oh, man, you're
a heavy little thing.

36
00:02:07,462 --> 00:02:09,929
Are there any more
at home like you?

37
00:02:09,964 --> 00:02:13,183
All right, gentlemen,
procedure as follows:

38
00:02:13,218 --> 00:02:14,801
The gold in the cave

39
00:02:14,836 --> 00:02:17,303
then mr. Decruz will
destroy the vehicles.

40
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,440
Okay, buddy boy,
let's go.

41
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,570
Thepiece de
resistancenow.

42
00:02:33,605 --> 00:02:35,455
The real culmination.

43
00:02:36,706 --> 00:02:39,209
Ultimate ingenuity.

44
00:02:39,244 --> 00:02:41,711
It is one thing,
gentlemen,

45
00:02:41,746 --> 00:02:44,464
to stop a train on its way
from fort knox to los angeles

46
00:02:44,499 --> 00:02:46,332
and steal its cargo.

47
00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:51,971
It's another thing
to remain free to spend it.

48
00:02:52,006 --> 00:02:53,590
And spend it
we shall.

49
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:55,475
Yeah, but when?

50
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:56,976
Don't you know, mr. Decruz?

51
00:02:57,011 --> 00:02:58,845
I would have thought

52
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,346
that this aspect
of the plan

53
00:03:00,381 --> 00:03:02,849
would be particularly
clear in your mind.

54
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,493
Maldito vidrio.

55
00:03:14,744 --> 00:03:17,247
Rip van winkle.

56
00:03:17,282 --> 00:03:19,115
That's what we are.

57
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,000
Four rip van winkles.

58
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:24,754
I'm not sure.

59
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:27,006
Whatare you not sure of,
mr. Decruz?

60
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:31,261
Just... lying down
in one of these...

61
00:03:31,296 --> 00:03:33,763
these glass caskets

62
00:03:33,798 --> 00:03:36,883
and getting put to sleep.

63
00:03:36,918 --> 00:03:39,135
I like to know
what i'm doing.

64
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:40,386
You know what you're doing-

65
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:41,638
i've explained it
very precisely to you.

66
00:03:41,673 --> 00:03:43,523
All four of us
will be placed

67
00:03:43,558 --> 00:03:45,892
in a state of
suspended animation,

68
00:03:45,927 --> 00:03:49,028
and when we wake up,
that's when we'll take our gold

69
00:03:49,063 --> 00:03:51,281
and enjoy it.

70
00:03:51,316 --> 00:03:53,149
I say everybody
takes his cut now

71
00:03:53,184 --> 00:03:55,034
and takes his own chances.

72
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:56,903
What you say,
decruz-

73
00:03:56,938 --> 00:03:58,788
but that ain't
what we agreed on.

74
00:03:58,823 --> 00:04:00,657
We agreed we'd
stash the gold here

75
00:04:00,692 --> 00:04:03,793
and then do whatever
farwell tells us to do.

76
00:04:03,828 --> 00:04:05,662
So far he ain't
been wrong-

77
00:04:05,697 --> 00:04:08,164
not about anything.

78
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:10,667
The train, the gold...

79
00:04:10,702 --> 00:04:13,169
gas he used to put

80
00:04:13,204 --> 00:04:15,054
a whole trainload
of people to sleep-

81
00:04:15,089 --> 00:04:17,557
everything.

82
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:19,425
All we had to do was

83
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:22,562
step over a lot of
horizontal folks snoring.

84
00:04:22,597 --> 00:04:24,180
Transfer a fortune

85
00:04:24,215 --> 00:04:26,683
like it was
cotton candy.

86
00:04:26,718 --> 00:04:27,934
Amen to that.

87
00:04:27,969 --> 00:04:29,819
Amen to that,
sure.

88
00:04:29,854 --> 00:04:31,688
But how about
to this?

89
00:04:31,723 --> 00:04:34,691
None of you mind
being helpless

90
00:04:34,726 --> 00:04:37,193
and... closed up in these?

91
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:41,080
No, mr. Decruz.

92
00:04:41,115 --> 00:04:42,949
None of us mind.

93
00:04:45,335 --> 00:04:47,203
How long, farwell?

94
00:04:47,238 --> 00:04:50,340
How long?

95
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:53,459
I don't know exactly.

96
00:04:53,494 --> 00:04:54,711
I can only surmise.

97
00:04:54,746 --> 00:04:56,596
I would say that...

98
00:04:58,715 --> 00:04:59,349
...i would say

99
00:04:59,384 --> 00:05:01,851
approximately
100 years

100
00:05:01,886 --> 00:05:03,720
from today's date.

101
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:10,977
100 years,
gentlemen,

102
00:05:11,012 --> 00:05:14,731
and we shall walk
the earth again...

103
00:05:14,766 --> 00:05:16,616
as rich men, however.

104
00:05:16,651 --> 00:05:19,986
As extremely rich men.

105
00:05:20,021 --> 00:05:22,488
100 years.

106
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:31,748
Just like rip van winkle.

107
00:05:31,783 --> 00:05:33,633
Introducing four experts

108
00:05:33,668 --> 00:05:36,135
in the questionable
art of crime:

109
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:39,889
Mr. Farwell, expert on
noxious gases, former professor

110
00:05:39,924 --> 00:05:43,643
with a doctorate in both
chemistry and physics;

111
00:05:43,678 --> 00:05:47,397
mr. Erbie, expert in
mechanical engineering;

112
00:05:47,432 --> 00:05:50,516
mr. Brooks, expert in
the use of firearms

113
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:51,768
and other weaponry;

114
00:05:51,803 --> 00:05:54,904
and mr. Decruz,
expert in demolition

115
00:05:54,939 --> 00:05:57,407
and various forms
of destruction.

116
00:05:58,658 --> 00:05:59,909
The time is now

117
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:03,780
and the place is a mountain cave
in death valley, u.s.a.

118
00:06:03,815 --> 00:06:06,916
In just a moment these four men
will utilize the services

119
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,419
of a truck placed in cosmoline

120
00:06:09,454 --> 00:06:12,538
loaded with a hot heist, cooled
off by a century of sleep

121
00:06:12,573 --> 00:06:15,675
and then take a drive
into the twilight zone.

122
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,725
All right, gentlemen.

123
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,479
First of all, i want to know
if you can hear me...

124
00:06:36,514 --> 00:06:40,867
knock once on the side
as i call your name.

125
00:06:40,902 --> 00:06:42,735
Decruz?

126
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:47,240
Brooks.

127
00:06:47,275 --> 00:06:49,742
Erbie.

128
00:06:51,028 --> 00:06:53,496
Now i'm going to give you,
in chronology,

129
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:55,381
precisely what will happen.

130
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:58,501
First,
you are to check your airlocks

131
00:06:58,536 --> 00:07:01,254
located on your right.

132
00:07:01,289 --> 00:07:03,139
See it there?

133
00:07:03,174 --> 00:07:05,007
The red arrow
should be pointed

134
00:07:05,042 --> 00:07:07,894
toward "closed and locked."

135
00:07:07,929 --> 00:07:11,647
Now you are each to count ten,
very slowly.

136
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:14,150
When you come
to the end of the count,

137
00:07:14,185 --> 00:07:18,521
reach down with your left hand,

138
00:07:18,654 --> 00:07:21,157
there's a small
green button there.

139
00:07:21,192 --> 00:07:23,025
See it?

140
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,278
You are to press
this button.

141
00:07:25,313 --> 00:07:28,414
You will hear
a slight hissing sound.

142
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:30,283
This will be the gas

143
00:07:30,318 --> 00:07:32,785
being measured
into the enclosures.

144
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:37,790
All right, gentlemen,
check your airlocks first.

145
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:42,795
Now begin to count

146
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:45,681
and on ten,
release the gas.

147
00:08:01,197 --> 00:08:03,699
Good night, gentlemen.

148
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:04,951
Pleasant dreams.

149
00:08:04,986 --> 00:08:06,569
Good sleep.

150
00:08:06,604 --> 00:08:12,208
I'll see you
in the next century.

151
00:08:12,243 --> 00:08:16,579
Next... century.

152
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:12,385
It didn't work.

153
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,637
It didn't...

154
00:09:14,672 --> 00:09:17,139
we don't have any beards,

155
00:09:17,174 --> 00:09:19,642
and our nails didn't grow.

156
00:09:22,778 --> 00:09:24,647
Well, mr. Farwell,

157
00:09:24,682 --> 00:09:27,783
with the big brain
and all the answers,

158
00:09:27,818 --> 00:09:29,402
why didn't it work?

159
00:09:29,437 --> 00:09:31,287
It must have worked.

160
00:09:31,322 --> 00:09:33,155
It was foolproof.

161
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,909
All the body functions stopped.

162
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:40,046
There wouldn't be any growth
of beard or nails

163
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:41,797
or anything
else!

164
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:43,049
I tell you,
it worked.

165
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:06,689
Well, look.

166
00:10:06,724 --> 00:10:09,191
The road's
still there.

167
00:10:09,226 --> 00:10:11,077
It hasn't changed.

168
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:14,196
It hasn't changed
one bit!

169
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:18,584
Carajo.

170
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:19,835
Mastermind, big brain.

171
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,587
Instead of
a hundred years,

172
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:22,838
maybe it's an hour,

173
00:10:22,873 --> 00:10:25,341
and so we're
still hot.

174
00:10:25,376 --> 00:10:26,208
And all that gold in there

175
00:10:26,243 --> 00:10:28,094
is just like
a lot garbage to us now

176
00:10:28,129 --> 00:10:29,345
because everybody
and his brother

177
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,213
is going to be looking for it.

178
00:10:31,248 --> 00:10:32,465
Erbie.

179
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,967
We forgot erbie.

180
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:49,482
This is what did it.

181
00:10:49,517 --> 00:10:53,235
Must have fallen
from the top of the cave,

182
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:56,372
cracked the glass,
the gas escaped.

183
00:10:57,623 --> 00:11:01,744
Mr. Erbie has proven my point,
however, gentlemen.

184
00:11:01,779 --> 00:11:03,629
He's definitely
proven my point...

185
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:06,132
the hard way.

186
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:15,508
How... how long
would it take

187
00:11:15,543 --> 00:11:18,010
for such a thing
to happen?

188
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:21,147
A year,

189
00:11:21,182 --> 00:11:23,649
or a hundred years.

190
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:26,152
Chances are,
mr. Decruz,

191
00:11:26,187 --> 00:11:28,654
that we're now
in the year 2061.

192
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:30,523
2060...

193
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,910
wow.

194
00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:36,162
Okay.

195
00:11:36,197 --> 00:11:37,413
Now the next step, huh?

196
00:11:37,448 --> 00:11:39,915
We load the gold
into the truck

197
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:42,418
and take it to the first city
we get to, huh?

198
00:11:42,453 --> 00:11:44,170
And then we take
it to a fence

199
00:11:44,205 --> 00:11:46,038
or melt it down
ourselves in some way.

200
00:11:46,073 --> 00:11:47,923
That's the deal,
isn't it?

201
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:49,792
Why is it, mr. Decruz,

202
00:11:49,827 --> 00:11:51,677
that greedy men
are the most dreamless,

203
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:53,546
least imaginative,
the stupidest?

204
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,548
Now, listen to me, farwell...

205
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,433
for the first
time in history

206
00:11:57,468 --> 00:12:00,936
we have taken a century
and put it in our hip pocket.

207
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:04,056
We've taken a lease on life
and outlived our stay.

208
00:12:04,091 --> 00:12:06,559
We've had our cake
but we're still going to eat.

209
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:09,695
That's quite an adventure
out there, mr. Decruz,

210
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:12,815
though you're a little
insensitive to it.

211
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:15,818
It's a world
we've never seen before-

212
00:12:15,853 --> 00:12:19,321
a brand-new, exciting world

213
00:12:19,356 --> 00:12:22,458
that we are going
to walk through.

214
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:25,578
But with gold,
farwell.

215
00:12:25,613 --> 00:12:27,463
With a million bucks
worth of gold.

216
00:12:27,498 --> 00:12:29,965
That's how we're going to walk through it.

217
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,217
Of course.

218
00:12:35,971 --> 00:12:40,726
I wonder...
what kind of a world.

219
00:12:52,488 --> 00:12:54,857
We all loaded up?

220
00:12:54,892 --> 00:12:56,108
All loaded.

221
00:12:56,143 --> 00:12:57,993
Okay, let's pull out.

222
00:12:58,028 --> 00:12:59,245
Brooks, you drive.

223
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,496
I'll hop in the back

224
00:13:00,531 --> 00:13:02,364
and make sure the gold
doesn't fall off.

225
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,250
Well, aren't you
the most thoughtful little thing

226
00:13:04,285 --> 00:13:05,501
that ever
come down the pike?

227
00:13:05,536 --> 00:13:06,118
What's the matter?

228
00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:09,255
You stay in back
and watch the gold, huh?

229
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:11,757
Decruz, i wouldn't
trust you with gold

230
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:14,877
if it was filling in
your own mother's tooth.

231
00:13:14,912 --> 00:13:16,762
No, buddy boy,
you drive.

232
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:18,013
I'll check the back.

233
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:19,265
Well, okay.

234
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,516
Okay, amigo.

235
00:13:20,551 --> 00:13:23,636
Where's the
water can?

236
00:13:23,671 --> 00:13:25,888
We might as well
get that loaded.

237
00:13:25,923 --> 00:13:27,773
Over there where
we buried erbie.

238
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,795
Decruz!

239
00:14:31,587 --> 00:14:34,089
Mr. Brooks had
a very bad accident.

240
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,460
I keep underestimating
you, mr. Decruz.

241
00:14:38,495 --> 00:14:40,346
Yeah, well,
we'll do it my way now.

242
00:14:40,381 --> 00:14:42,214
We'll pack
as much as we can,

243
00:14:42,249 --> 00:14:44,099
put them in
two knapsacks,

244
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:45,351
and hit the road.

245
00:14:45,386 --> 00:14:47,853
I can't think of any
other alternative

246
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:49,355
at the moment.

247
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:18,133
Hold it, decruz, hold it.

248
00:15:18,168 --> 00:15:20,252
I've... got to rest.

249
00:15:31,146 --> 00:15:32,398
How we doing,
farwell?

250
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,517
The map said...

251
00:15:35,552 --> 00:15:38,020
the map said 28 miles
to the next town.

252
00:15:38,055 --> 00:15:39,271
At this rate,

253
00:15:39,306 --> 00:15:41,774
we won't reach it
till tomorrow afternoon.

254
00:15:41,809 --> 00:15:44,276
At this rate,
you'll never reach it.

255
00:15:51,667 --> 00:15:57,923
There hasn't been a car,
not a single car.

256
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:58,791
What if...?

257
00:15:58,826 --> 00:16:00,042
"What if" what?

258
00:16:00,077 --> 00:16:02,428
What if there were a war?

259
00:16:02,463 --> 00:16:05,547
What if they dropped a bomb?

260
00:16:05,582 --> 00:16:08,300
What if this highway
stretched to...

261
00:16:08,335 --> 00:16:10,185
stretched to what?

262
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,688
Stretched to nothing,
mr. Decruz?

263
00:16:12,723 --> 00:16:14,556
Stretched to nothing at all?

264
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:20,195
Wouldn't it be the irony
of all ironies-

265
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:24,566
walk... till our hearts burst

266
00:16:24,601 --> 00:16:28,203
carrying all this gold?

267
00:16:34,495 --> 00:16:36,962
There's a world left, farwell,

268
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:37,830
and that proves it.

269
00:16:37,865 --> 00:16:39,715
That means there's
a town up ahead.

270
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,717
We're going to make it, buddy.

271
00:16:41,752 --> 00:16:43,585
We're going to make it.

272
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:46,221
Come on. Let's get going.

273
00:17:08,744 --> 00:17:11,246
My canteen is gone.

274
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:13,749
I must have left it
back on the road

275
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,251
the last place
we stopped.

276
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:18,871
I haven't any water.

277
00:17:18,906 --> 00:17:20,756
Water?

278
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:23,876
Oh, i believe there's some water
around here you could drink.

279
00:17:23,911 --> 00:17:26,762
Let's see, uh...
oh, here's some water.

280
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,516
One drink, one bar of gold.

281
00:17:30,551 --> 00:17:32,267
That's the price.

282
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,770
You're out of your mind.

283
00:17:34,805 --> 00:17:36,889
That's the price.

284
00:17:36,924 --> 00:17:40,025
One drink, one bar of gold.

285
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:43,645
I keep underrating you,
mr. Decruz.

286
00:17:46,281 --> 00:17:48,150
You're quite
an entrepreneur.

287
00:17:48,185 --> 00:17:49,401
Ain't it the truth.

288
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,296
One drink,
one bar of gold.

289
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:05,050
That's the going rate
today, mr. Farwell.

290
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:08,170
It may change tomorrow-
i haven't checked the market-

291
00:18:08,205 --> 00:18:11,306
but for today it's one for one.

292
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,926
Let's go,
mr. Farwell.

293
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:16,872
What's the matter?

294
00:19:16,907 --> 00:19:18,123
You pooped already?

295
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:19,625
You had a good
night's sleep,

296
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,493
and we've only
been on the road

297
00:19:21,528 --> 00:19:22,127
a couple hours.

298
00:19:22,162 --> 00:19:23,996
Stop... must stop.

299
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:26,498
Must have water,
decruz.

300
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:27,749
Must have water.

301
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:33,388
Well, all right,
farwell.

302
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:39,011
I got about a quarter
of a canteen left.

303
00:19:39,046 --> 00:19:39,645
Please, decruz.

304
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,398
Please, decruz.

305
00:19:43,433 --> 00:19:45,901
Mr. Farwell,
the rate of exchange

306
00:19:45,936 --> 00:19:48,904
has gone up a little bit today.

307
00:19:48,939 --> 00:19:50,772
It's two bars
of gold

308
00:19:50,807 --> 00:19:52,024
for one swallow.

309
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,791
Water, please.

310
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:36,878
Mister... mister...

311
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:41,266
this is gold here.

312
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:47,522
You can have it.

313
00:21:47,557 --> 00:21:50,025
Drive me to town.

314
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,893
If you give me water...

315
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:56,281
gold...

316
00:21:56,898 --> 00:22:00,035
it's real gold.

317
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:02,537
You can have it.

318
00:22:02,572 --> 00:22:05,040
I'll give it to you.

319
00:22:05,075 --> 00:22:08,160
I'll... give it to you.

320
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:22,808
Poor old fella.

321
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,561
Poor old fella.

322
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:32,184
I wonder where you came from.

323
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:46,698
Who is it, george?

324
00:22:46,733 --> 00:22:48,583
What's the matter
with him?

325
00:22:48,618 --> 00:22:49,201
Some old tramp.

326
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:51,086
That's what he was.

327
00:22:51,121 --> 00:22:52,337
He's dead.

328
00:22:52,372 --> 00:22:53,588
What's that?

329
00:22:53,623 --> 00:22:55,457
Gold- that's what
he said it was.

330
00:22:55,492 --> 00:22:56,708
He wanted
to give it to me

331
00:22:56,743 --> 00:22:58,593
in exchange
for a lift into town.

332
00:22:58,628 --> 00:23:00,462
Gold? Now, what
in the world

333
00:23:00,497 --> 00:23:02,964
would he be doing
with this gold?

334
00:23:02,999 --> 00:23:05,851
I don't know, he was probably
off his rocker.

335
00:23:05,886 --> 00:23:08,353
Anybody walking in the desert
this time of day

336
00:23:08,388 --> 00:23:10,222
would be off his rocker.

337
00:23:11,606 --> 00:23:13,475
Can you imagine that?

338
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:14,726
He offered this to me

339
00:23:14,761 --> 00:23:17,229
as if it was really
worth something.

340
00:23:17,264 --> 00:23:20,365
You know, wasn't it worth
something once, george?

341
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,485
I mean, didn't people
use gold for money?

342
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,370
Sure, about
a hundred years or so ago,

343
00:23:25,405 --> 00:23:28,490
before they found a way
of manufacturing it.

344
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:34,129
When we get back into town,

345
00:23:34,164 --> 00:23:37,249
we'll have the police
come out and pick him up.

346
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,136
The last
of four rip van winkles

347
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:43,638
who all died precisely
the way they lived:

348
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,141
Chasing an idol across the sand

349
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:48,643
to wind up bleached dry
in the hot sun

350
00:23:48,678 --> 00:23:49,895
as so much desert flotsam

351
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:53,648
worthless as the gold bullion
they built a shrine to-

352
00:23:53,683 --> 00:23:56,151
tonight's lesson
in the twilight zone.

353
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,748
Rod serling,
creator ofthe twilight zone,

354
00:24:09,783 --> 00:24:12,250
will tell you
about next week's story

355
00:24:12,285 --> 00:24:14,753
after this word
from our alternate sponsor.

356
00:24:16,471 --> 00:24:17,973
And now, mr. Serling.

357
00:24:18,008 --> 00:24:20,459
There are all kinds of wagers
and all kinds of odds,

358
00:24:20,494 --> 00:24:22,961
from the spin
of a roulette wheel

359
00:24:22,996 --> 00:24:26,097
to a two dollar across the board
at a racetrack.

360
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:27,716
But next week
onthe twilight zone,

361
00:24:27,751 --> 00:24:30,218
with the aid
of mr. Franchot tone,

362
00:24:30,253 --> 00:24:33,972
we tell the story of possibly
the strangest bet ever to occur

363
00:24:34,007 --> 00:24:35,857
in the annals of chance.

364
00:24:35,892 --> 00:24:38,977
Our program is called
"the silence."

365
00:24:39,012 --> 00:24:40,862
I hope we'll see you then.

366
00:24:40,897 --> 00:24:43,365
Here's something that doesn't
require any imagination-

367
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,233
it's oasis.

368
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,987
If you just took this puff,

369
00:24:49,022 --> 00:24:51,490
you'd agree
it's the softest taste of all.

370
00:24:51,525 --> 00:24:53,375
Before we meet again,

371
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:57,128
try oasis
for the softest taste of all.

372
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,793
Be sure and watchgunsmoke,
starring james arness,

373
00:25:44,828 --> 00:25:48,547
saturday nights over most
of these same stations.
