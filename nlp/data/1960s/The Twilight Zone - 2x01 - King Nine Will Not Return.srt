1
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,680
You're traveling
through another dimension-

2
00:00:13,715 --> 00:00:16,816
a dimension not only of sight
and sound, but of mind.

3
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:19,936
A journey into a wondrous land
of imagination.

4
00:00:19,971 --> 00:00:23,690
Next stop,
the twilight zone.

5
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:39,706
This is africa, 1943.

6
00:00:39,741 --> 00:00:42,208
War spits out
its violence overhead,

7
00:00:42,243 --> 00:00:45,345
and the sandy graveyard
swallows it up.

8
00:00:47,847 --> 00:00:49,716
Her name isking nine:

9
00:00:49,751 --> 00:00:52,218
B-25 medium bomber,
12th air force.

10
00:00:52,253 --> 00:00:55,355
On a hot, still morning,
she took off from tunisia

11
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:57,223
to bomb the southern tip
of italy.

12
00:00:57,258 --> 00:01:00,360
An errant piece of flak
tore a hole in a wing tank

13
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:04,114
and, like a wounded bird,
this is where she landed-

14
00:01:04,149 --> 00:01:07,233
not to return on this day
or any other day.

15
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,543
Oh...

16
00:02:06,578 --> 00:02:10,296
oh, yeah, i remember now.

17
00:02:10,331 --> 00:02:13,433
At least i remember
parts of it.

18
00:02:13,468 --> 00:02:15,301
Wing tank hit...

19
00:02:15,336 --> 00:02:17,804
and lost fuel all the way over,

20
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:21,558
fell behind, went off course
and bellied in.

21
00:02:21,593 --> 00:02:24,060
And the crew...

22
00:02:24,694 --> 00:02:26,563
what about the crew?

23
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:31,568
Hey, did they bail out?

24
00:02:31,603 --> 00:02:35,455
Did i order them to bail out?

25
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,323
No.

26
00:02:37,358 --> 00:02:38,575
No, i didn't.

27
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:41,077
We all rode it in-
all of us.

28
00:02:41,112 --> 00:02:46,716
Me...

29
00:02:46,751 --> 00:02:49,219
i'm james embry, captain.

30
00:02:49,254 --> 00:02:51,087
Yeah, yeah, that's who i am.

31
00:02:51,122 --> 00:02:52,338
Uh... blake, copilot

32
00:02:52,373 --> 00:02:55,475
kransky, radio operator
and wave-scanner,

33
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:56,726
and jimenez, navigator.

34
00:02:56,761 --> 00:02:58,595
Connors- he was a tail gunner.

35
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:01,097
Klein- he was
the upper turret gunner.

36
00:03:01,132 --> 00:03:03,600
Now, let's see. Who else?
Who else?

37
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,146
Blake?

38
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:53,900
Blake?

39
00:04:06,796 --> 00:04:08,665
Jimenez?

40
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,167
Jimenez?

41
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,062
Blake?

42
00:04:23,097 --> 00:04:25,565
Connors?

43
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,685
Kransky?

44
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,570
Klein?

45
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,826
Jimenez?

46
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:39,946
Hey!

47
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,197
Hey!

48
00:04:41,232 --> 00:04:44,200
All right, now. All right, now.

49
00:04:44,235 --> 00:04:46,703
Piece it together.
Piece it together.

50
00:04:46,738 --> 00:04:48,588
That's what i have to do.

51
00:04:48,623 --> 00:04:51,090
Just piece it all together.

52
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,342
We bellied in...

53
00:04:52,377 --> 00:04:53,593
we bellied in,

54
00:04:53,628 --> 00:04:57,347
and i must have been thrown
clear of the plane.

55
00:04:57,382 --> 00:04:59,849
Yeah. Yeah,
that's what happened.

56
00:04:59,884 --> 00:05:02,969
It knocked me cold.

57
00:05:03,004 --> 00:05:04,854
Yeah, i may have been out
for hours.

58
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:09,859
And then the others were...

59
00:05:09,894 --> 00:05:12,362
what about the others?

60
00:05:12,397 --> 00:05:15,481
Where are they?

61
00:05:15,516 --> 00:05:16,733
They didn't jump.

62
00:05:16,768 --> 00:05:19,235
Their chutes are still here.

63
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:21,120
And they're not dead.

64
00:05:21,155 --> 00:05:24,240
They... they couldn't be dead.

65
00:05:24,275 --> 00:05:27,377
And, if they left the plane
and started walking,

66
00:05:27,412 --> 00:05:29,879
why didn't they take me?

67
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,500
Blake!

68
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:37,003
Klein! Kransky!

69
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:38,254
Connors?

70
00:05:38,289 --> 00:05:40,139
Jiminez?

71
00:05:58,408 --> 00:05:59,659
King ninecallingfirefly.

72
00:05:59,694 --> 00:06:01,527
Mayday. Mayday.

73
00:06:01,562 --> 00:06:03,413
King ninecallingfirefly.
Mayday! Mayday!

74
00:06:03,448 --> 00:06:05,281
King ninecallingfirefly.

75
00:06:05,316 --> 00:06:06,532
Come in, please.

76
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,171
King ninecallingfirefly.

77
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:14,040
Mayday! Mayday! Come in, please!

78
00:06:35,945 --> 00:06:38,448
Ah, easy now, easy now.

79
00:06:38,483 --> 00:06:40,316
Think about it some.

80
00:06:40,351 --> 00:06:43,453
Don't go off half-cocked.

81
00:06:43,488 --> 00:06:45,955
There are reasons.

82
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,824
There are explanations.

83
00:06:47,859 --> 00:06:52,211
The crew is someplace
and... and, for some reason,

84
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:56,582
and i'm alone for some reason.

85
00:06:56,617 --> 00:06:59,085
Everything looks tilt,
but there's...

86
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,970
there's logic behind it.

87
00:07:01,005 --> 00:07:02,839
There's logic for everything.

88
00:07:02,874 --> 00:07:03,840
I just have to...

89
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:06,342
i just have to keep it cool,
that's all.

90
00:07:06,377 --> 00:07:10,730
Think about it rationally.

91
00:07:10,765 --> 00:07:12,598
The main thing...

92
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:13,850
the main thing
i got to keep in mind is

93
00:07:13,885 --> 00:07:18,237
i'm responsible for this crew.

94
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:20,106
I'm in charge.

95
00:07:20,141 --> 00:07:23,242
As far as it's within my power,
i got to keep them alive.

96
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,362
I got to get them out of this.

97
00:07:26,397 --> 00:07:27,613
I command this aircraft,

98
00:07:27,648 --> 00:07:30,750
and i'm in charge,
and i'm responsible.

99
00:07:34,155 --> 00:07:35,371
Blake?

100
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,508
Blake, is that you?

101
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:42,261
Blake?

102
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:49,635
Blake?

103
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:44,574
Klein?

104
00:08:44,609 --> 00:08:46,442
Sergeant klein?

105
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:50,830
You incredibly stupid jerk, you.

106
00:08:50,865 --> 00:08:53,332
You dropped your canteen.

107
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:55,201
You stupid bronx cowboy, you.

108
00:08:55,236 --> 00:08:58,337
You're in the desert now,
you idiot.

109
00:08:58,372 --> 00:09:00,840
You're going to need water.

110
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,845
I still have
to nursemaid you guys, huh?

111
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,713
Some crew i got here.

112
00:09:07,748 --> 00:09:08,965
Run around the...

113
00:09:12,101 --> 00:09:14,854
it's not funny, boys.

114
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:18,608
It's strictly not... not funny.

115
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:38,494
Blake! Blake!

116
00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:40,379
Blake...

117
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:42,882
it's me, embry.

118
00:09:42,917 --> 00:09:44,750
It's me, embry, blake.

119
00:09:44,785 --> 00:09:46,752
Blake.

120
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:57,396
Blake?

121
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:03,019
Blake, where'd you go?

122
00:10:03,054 --> 00:10:06,155
Blake?

123
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:09,275
What's the gag?

124
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:11,160
Oh, come on, fellas.

125
00:10:11,195 --> 00:10:14,914
I'm responsible for you guys.

126
00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:17,416
Don't you understand?

127
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:18,668
I'm responsible.

128
00:10:38,354 --> 00:10:39,605
Mayday.

129
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,856
King ninecallingfirefly.

130
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:42,725
King nine
callingfirefly.

131
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,976
Mayday. Mayday.

132
00:10:44,011 --> 00:10:46,479
Pancaked in desert
one hour and 30 minutes

133
00:10:46,514 --> 00:10:47,730
from last checkpoint.

134
00:10:47,765 --> 00:10:49,615
Bearing 29...

135
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:02,745
hallucinations...

136
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:07,750
the whole thing
could be an hallucination.

137
00:11:07,785 --> 00:11:10,252
I could be lying
out there in the sand

138
00:11:10,287 --> 00:11:13,389
with a fractured skull.

139
00:11:13,424 --> 00:11:16,509
I might not even
be standing here.

140
00:11:16,544 --> 00:11:20,262
I might be dying out there
in the desert.

141
00:11:20,297 --> 00:11:22,765
All this is what i'm just...

142
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,267
making up in my mind.

143
00:11:25,302 --> 00:11:28,404
Or maybe i'm... i'm sleeping,

144
00:11:28,439 --> 00:11:30,906
and i'm having a dream.

145
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:35,911
Hey, maybe i'll wake up,
and i'll be back at the base.

146
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:38,414
Or maybe i tied one on,

147
00:11:38,449 --> 00:11:41,534
and i'm in a booth
at a bar someplace...

148
00:11:41,569 --> 00:11:43,419
with a pretty girl.

149
00:11:46,574 --> 00:11:49,675
Oh, this one tears it.

150
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:52,178
This one really tears it.

151
00:11:52,213 --> 00:11:55,297
Wait till the medics
get ahold of me.

152
00:11:55,332 --> 00:11:57,800
They'll never let loose.

153
00:11:57,835 --> 00:11:59,051
They'll have
to put me on tour.

154
00:11:59,086 --> 00:12:02,188
If they ever let me
out of the bin, that is.

155
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:09,061
Now, just a second.

156
00:12:09,096 --> 00:12:11,564
Just a second.

157
00:12:11,599 --> 00:12:14,700
I saw him sitting there.

158
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:16,569
Yeah.

159
00:12:16,604 --> 00:12:19,705
And that was no hallucination.

160
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:27,213
I saw blake sitting right here.

161
00:12:27,248 --> 00:12:29,081
Nobody can tell me different.

162
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:31,584
I saw him sitting
right in this seat.

163
00:12:31,619 --> 00:12:33,469
Blake!

164
00:12:33,504 --> 00:12:35,721
Connors! Klein!

165
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:37,590
How about it, crew?!

166
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:39,475
You hear me, anybody?!

167
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,343
Hey!

168
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:12,875
All right, king ninecrew!

169
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:15,377
This is your captain!

170
00:13:16,011 --> 00:13:18,514
How about it, you guys?

171
00:13:18,549 --> 00:13:20,382
I'm responsible for you jerks!

172
00:13:20,417 --> 00:13:22,885
You're giving me
some bum action here!

173
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,770
You're throwing curves,
gentlemen!

174
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:27,139
How about it, team?

175
00:13:27,174 --> 00:13:28,390
How about it, crew?

176
00:13:28,425 --> 00:13:31,527
Look, i'm supposed
to look after you guys!

177
00:13:37,032 --> 00:13:38,400
Blake!

178
00:13:38,435 --> 00:13:40,286
Connors!

179
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,053
Klein...

180
00:13:58,088 --> 00:13:59,922
i'm sorry.

181
00:13:59,957 --> 00:14:02,424
I didn't know.

182
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:05,811
Rest in peace, buddy.

183
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:10,816
Rest in peace, kid.

184
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:17,690
Hey...

185
00:14:17,725 --> 00:14:20,192
what kind of aircraft are those?

186
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:31,704
Wait a minute here.

187
00:14:31,739 --> 00:14:33,589
What kind of pla...?

188
00:14:33,624 --> 00:14:35,457
What are they?

189
00:14:35,492 --> 00:14:38,594
I've never seen any planes
like that before.

190
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,096
I've never seen any jets.

191
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:42,348
Jets?

192
00:14:42,383 --> 00:14:43,599
Jet aircraft?

193
00:14:43,634 --> 00:14:46,101
How do i know
about jet aircraft?

194
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:47,353
This is 1943.

195
00:14:47,388 --> 00:14:50,472
There's no such thing
as jet aircraft,

196
00:14:50,507 --> 00:14:51,724
but i know about it.

197
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:56,111
I know about jet aircraft-
f-106s, f-105s, b-58s.

198
00:14:56,146 --> 00:14:57,363
I know all about it.

199
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,617
Hey!

200
00:15:01,652 --> 00:15:04,370
Hey, where you guys going?!

201
00:15:04,405 --> 00:15:06,872
Hey, what's going on here?!

202
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:09,375
Hey, what are you doing here?!

203
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,877
Blake!

204
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:13,879
Blake! Connors?!

205
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:15,748
Blake!

206
00:15:15,783 --> 00:15:19,501
You ever hear a jet aircraft-

207
00:15:19,536 --> 00:15:22,638
f-105s, f-106s, b-58s?

208
00:15:22,673 --> 00:15:25,140
Jets! Jets!

209
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,260
Crew!

210
00:15:28,295 --> 00:15:29,511
Hey, crew!

211
00:15:29,546 --> 00:15:32,648
Now, come on,
we got to get out of here.

212
00:15:32,683 --> 00:15:34,516
We've got to get out.

213
00:15:34,551 --> 00:15:37,653
Now, we're not going
to be able to walk out.

214
00:15:37,688 --> 00:15:38,904
We can't walk out.

215
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:40,155
That's for sure.

216
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,407
That's for positive.

217
00:15:41,442 --> 00:15:43,275
We're going to have to fly.

218
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:45,160
Fly.

219
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:47,663
Come on, boys! Come on!

220
00:15:47,698 --> 00:15:50,165
We're going to have
to prop up the ship,

221
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,034
get the wheels down,

222
00:15:52,069 --> 00:15:55,788
try to take her off-
get her in the air.

223
00:15:55,823 --> 00:15:58,290
And, boys, i'll get her back.

224
00:15:58,325 --> 00:16:00,175
You can trust me.

225
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:02,044
I'll get her back.

226
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,703
It doesn't make
any difference...

227
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:32,708
because you're an illusion.

228
00:16:32,743 --> 00:16:35,210
You don't even exist.

229
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:41,467
I'm dead...

230
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,220
or i'm knocked out...

231
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:48,974
or i'm off in limbo someplace.

232
00:16:50,225 --> 00:16:51,477
Oh...

233
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,230
oh, i see.

234
00:16:55,265 --> 00:16:57,733
I'm unconscious.

235
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:05,240
Or i'm cracked up
in some army base.

236
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:10,245
Some teeny-weeny little ward.

237
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,875
Or i don't exist...

238
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,628
any more than you do.

239
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,016
Crew, i'm all right.

240
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:32,885
Come on, crew.

241
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,770
Come on back.

242
00:17:34,805 --> 00:17:37,890
You can break the silence now.

243
00:17:37,925 --> 00:17:39,775
I got an idea.

244
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:42,277
Hey, you can yell at me.

245
00:17:42,312 --> 00:17:44,279
Yell at me!

246
00:17:47,434 --> 00:17:51,153
Oh, hey, why don't you just...?

247
00:17:51,188 --> 00:17:53,655
Oh, this is funny.

248
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:54,907
Why don't you just...

249
00:17:54,942 --> 00:17:58,043
spring up out of the sand
like a bunch of jumping jacks,

250
00:17:58,078 --> 00:18:01,797
and just stand there,
and just laugh, see?

251
00:18:04,299 --> 00:18:06,168
Just... la...

252
00:18:14,309 --> 00:18:16,178
klein!

253
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,183
Klein!

254
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:24,570
Fellas, i knew
you'd come back.

255
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:34,196
Oh, no.

256
00:18:34,231 --> 00:18:36,081
Fellas?

257
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:37,950
No.

258
00:18:37,985 --> 00:18:40,452
Now, look, fellas. Please...

259
00:18:40,487 --> 00:18:41,703
klein.

260
00:18:41,738 --> 00:18:43,589
Blake?

261
00:18:43,624 --> 00:18:45,457
Kransky?

262
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:53,599
Phantoms.

263
00:18:53,634 --> 00:18:56,101
Everything's a phantom.

264
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:01,106
There isn't a thing...

265
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:06,111
not a single thing that's real.

266
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:08,614
Oh, god.

267
00:19:08,649 --> 00:19:11,116
Oh, god, what's happening here?

268
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:13,619
What's happening?

269
00:19:13,654 --> 00:19:17,372
Won't you let me in on it?

270
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:22,995
Please let me in on it, god.

271
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:26,748
Please let me in on it.

272
00:19:26,783 --> 00:19:28,634
Oh, god.

273
00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:31,753
Let me in on it.

274
00:19:31,788 --> 00:19:34,256
Oh, god.

275
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:36,758
Oh, please.

276
00:19:36,793 --> 00:19:39,261
Please...

277
00:19:39,296 --> 00:19:41,763
james embry, age 41, single.

278
00:19:41,798 --> 00:19:43,649
It happened this morning.

279
00:19:43,684 --> 00:19:46,151
Went by a newsstand,
looked at a paper,

280
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:47,402
then went into shock.

281
00:19:47,437 --> 00:19:51,156
When the ambulance got there,
he was almost catatonic.

282
00:19:51,191 --> 00:19:52,407
Is this what set it
off? This front page?

283
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:54,276
That's why i thought

284
00:19:54,311 --> 00:19:56,161
we ought to have
a psychiatrist in on it.

285
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:01,033
It's very odd.

286
00:20:01,068 --> 00:20:02,918
I thought so, too,

287
00:20:02,953 --> 00:20:05,420
so i checked with the
pentagon in washington

288
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:06,672
on his army background.

289
00:20:06,707 --> 00:20:07,923
Captain, air force, b-25,

290
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:09,791
africa and italy,
37 missions,

291
00:20:09,826 --> 00:20:12,294
discharged august 1943,
recurrent fevers.

292
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:15,297
Some suggestion of
psychological disturbance,

293
00:20:15,332 --> 00:20:16,548
but he was discharged

294
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:19,051
before they could find out
much about it.

295
00:20:19,086 --> 00:20:20,302
And this
was his plane.

296
00:20:20,337 --> 00:20:21,553
His plane and his crew.

297
00:20:21,588 --> 00:20:22,804
Took off for italy

298
00:20:23,438 --> 00:20:25,307
on what was supposed
to be a routine flight.

299
00:20:25,342 --> 00:20:27,809
Embry never went
on that last mission.

300
00:20:27,844 --> 00:20:29,444
Reported in ill,

301
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:31,947
and someone else flew
the plane for him.

302
00:20:31,982 --> 00:20:33,198
Never got back.

303
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:34,566
And, for 17 years,

304
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:37,069
he's been carrying that
around in his gut.

305
00:20:40,455 --> 00:20:42,708
You're all right,
mr. Embry.

306
00:20:42,743 --> 00:20:44,326
You're in a hospital.

307
00:20:44,361 --> 00:20:45,577
We'll look
after you.

308
00:20:45,612 --> 00:20:49,331
Crazy dream.

309
00:20:49,366 --> 00:20:51,833
I went back.

310
00:20:52,467 --> 00:20:54,970
I went back to the desert.

311
00:20:55,005 --> 00:20:57,089
That's all right,
mr. Embry...

312
00:20:57,124 --> 00:20:58,340
no, no, no.

313
00:20:58,375 --> 00:20:59,591
Sorry, mr. Embry.

314
00:20:59,626 --> 00:21:01,476
You went back
to the desert.

315
00:21:01,511 --> 00:21:02,728
Then what?

316
00:21:02,763 --> 00:21:05,230
I went back to my plane.

317
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:07,099
I was looking
for the fellas.

318
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:09,601
I looked everywhere
for them.

319
00:21:09,636 --> 00:21:11,486
I saw blake,

320
00:21:11,521 --> 00:21:13,989
but it was... it was
a mirage, an illusion.

321
00:21:14,024 --> 00:21:15,240
He wasn't there.

322
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:17,109
None of them were there.

323
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:19,611
It was an illusion,
mr. Embry

324
00:21:19,646 --> 00:21:22,114
but you're out of it now.

325
00:21:22,149 --> 00:21:24,866
You're going
to be all right.

326
00:21:24,901 --> 00:21:28,003
I should have been on the plane.

327
00:21:28,038 --> 00:21:31,123
I should have gone
on that mission.

328
00:21:31,158 --> 00:21:33,125
I chickened out!

329
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,376
You didn't
chicken out.

330
00:21:34,411 --> 00:21:35,627
You had no way
of knowing

331
00:21:36,261 --> 00:21:38,130
that plane wasn't
going to come back.

332
00:21:38,165 --> 00:21:40,015
Now you
realize it more

333
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:41,266
as time goes by,

334
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:42,517
and you'll feel
better for it.

335
00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:44,386
It's out in the open now.

336
00:21:44,421 --> 00:21:48,140
You don't have to hide it
in a pit deep inside of you.

337
00:21:48,175 --> 00:21:51,526
That's what's been hurting you
all these years.

338
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:57,399
Another crazy thing...

339
00:21:57,434 --> 00:22:02,154
uh... uh... an illusion
or a dream or whatever.

340
00:22:02,189 --> 00:22:05,290
I was out there in the desert

341
00:22:05,325 --> 00:22:07,159
and...

342
00:22:07,194 --> 00:22:09,661
above me...

343
00:22:09,696 --> 00:22:12,164
in the sky...

344
00:22:12,199 --> 00:22:15,917
jets.

345
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:22,174
Isn't that wild?

346
00:22:22,209 --> 00:22:24,059
1943.

347
00:22:24,094 --> 00:22:27,179
African desert.

348
00:22:27,214 --> 00:22:30,932
And jet planes overhead.

349
00:22:30,967 --> 00:22:32,818
Just as if i...

350
00:22:32,853 --> 00:22:35,937
just as if i...
had gone back there...

351
00:22:35,972 --> 00:22:37,189
today.

352
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:45,330
Did i?

353
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:47,833
Did i go back?

354
00:22:47,868 --> 00:22:51,586
Did i go back to my plane?

355
00:22:51,621 --> 00:22:53,705
In your mind...

356
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,590
that's how you went back.

357
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:57,459
Only in your mind.

358
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:02,964
Only in my mind.

359
00:23:03,598 --> 00:23:05,467
Go back to sleep now,
mr. Embry.

360
00:23:05,502 --> 00:23:07,352
You're going
to be all right.

361
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:17,362
I think the worst part
of it is over.

362
00:23:17,397 --> 00:23:19,865
At least the guilt
is out in the open,

363
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,116
and he knows
what it is.

364
00:23:21,151 --> 00:23:23,618
That illusion certainly
seems real to him.

365
00:23:23,653 --> 00:23:25,487
In a couple of days,
a week,

366
00:23:25,522 --> 00:23:26,738
it will lose all reality.

367
00:23:26,773 --> 00:23:28,623
Doctor, these are
mr. Embry's clothes.

368
00:23:28,658 --> 00:23:29,875
You left them in
the examination room.

369
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:31,126
Put them on
the desk here, nurse.

370
00:23:31,161 --> 00:23:32,994
I'm going back in the room.
I'll take them in.

371
00:23:33,029 --> 00:23:34,246
I'd like to talk to him
in a day or so.

372
00:23:34,281 --> 00:23:35,747
Fine. I'll keep
a check on him.

373
00:23:35,782 --> 00:23:38,250
What's that?

374
00:23:41,386 --> 00:23:43,889
It's sand.

375
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,642
Enigma buried in the sand-

376
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,145
a question mark
with broken wings

377
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:54,516
that lies in silent grace
as a marker in a desert shrine.

378
00:23:54,551 --> 00:23:57,018
Odd how the real
consorts with the shadows-

379
00:23:57,053 --> 00:23:59,521
how the present
fuses with the past.

380
00:23:59,556 --> 00:24:00,772
How does it happen?

381
00:24:00,807 --> 00:24:03,909
The question is on file
in the silent desert.

382
00:24:03,944 --> 00:24:05,160
And the answer?

383
00:24:05,195 --> 00:24:08,914
The answer is waiting for us
in the twilight zone.

384
00:24:13,668 --> 00:24:16,171
Rod serling, the creator
oftwilight zone,

385
00:24:16,206 --> 00:24:18,039
will tell you
about next week's story

386
00:24:18,074 --> 00:24:20,542
after this word
from our alternate sponsor.

387
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:24,379
And now, mr. Serling.

388
00:24:24,414 --> 00:24:26,882
Inside this curio shop
next week,

389
00:24:26,917 --> 00:24:28,767
from amidst
this old-school rococo

390
00:24:28,802 --> 00:24:30,635
and some fusty,
moth-eaten antiquary,

391
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:31,887
will emerge a bottle- this one.

392
00:24:31,922 --> 00:24:34,389
And from it will step a genie

393
00:24:34,424 --> 00:24:36,274
to give mr. Luther adler
four wishes.

394
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:38,143
But he'll discover,
as will all of you,

395
00:24:38,178 --> 00:24:40,028
that there's an economics
to magic-

396
00:24:40,063 --> 00:24:41,897
a high cost of wishing.

397
00:24:41,932 --> 00:24:43,782
Next week,
a most intriguing tale-

398
00:24:43,817 --> 00:24:45,033
the man in the bottle.

399
00:24:45,068 --> 00:24:46,902
Thank you, and good night.
