1
00:00:07,223 --> 00:00:10,360
You unlock this door
with the key of imagination.

2
00:00:10,395 --> 00:00:12,228
Beyond it is another dimension-

3
00:00:12,263 --> 00:00:13,480
a dimension of sound...

4
00:00:14,649 --> 00:00:16,483
a dimension of sight...

5
00:00:16,518 --> 00:00:18,985
a dimension of mind.

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,488
You're moving into a land
of both shadow and substance,

7
00:00:21,523 --> 00:00:22,739
of things and ideas.

8
00:00:23,373 --> 00:00:26,493
You've just crossed over
into the twilight zone.

9
00:00:45,261 --> 00:00:47,147
Christie.

10
00:00:47,182 --> 00:00:51,518
Honey, i want you to run
upstairs with your present.

11
00:00:51,553 --> 00:00:52,902
Can't daddy see it?

12
00:00:52,937 --> 00:00:54,154
Not right away.

13
00:00:54,189 --> 00:00:55,405
All right?

14
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,907
Yes, mommy.

15
00:01:04,781 --> 00:01:05,415
Hi.

16
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:06,666
Hi, daddy.

17
00:01:06,701 --> 00:01:07,917
What did you buy?

18
00:01:07,952 --> 00:01:08,535
Nothing much.

19
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:09,919
Go on, christie.

20
00:01:09,954 --> 00:01:11,171
Wait a minute,
christie.

21
00:01:11,206 --> 00:01:11,788
What have you got there?

22
00:01:12,422 --> 00:01:13,673
It's just a doll, erich.

23
00:01:13,708 --> 00:01:15,542
She doesn't need another doll.

24
00:01:15,577 --> 00:01:17,427
She's had her eye
on it for months.

25
00:01:17,462 --> 00:01:18,678
I thought we agreed...

26
00:01:18,713 --> 00:01:21,181
christie,
show daddy your doll.

27
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:33,693
She's alive, daddy.

28
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:36,813
And her name is talky tina.

29
00:01:36,848 --> 00:01:39,699
For heaven sakes, annabelle,
a doll like that could cost...

30
00:01:39,734 --> 00:01:41,451
i put it on the account.

31
00:01:41,486 --> 00:01:43,820
Tina does everything.

32
00:01:43,855 --> 00:01:46,322
She moves, and she can talk,

33
00:01:46,357 --> 00:01:48,825
and i just love her already.

34
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:52,579
My name is talky tina,
and i love you very much.

35
00:01:52,614 --> 00:01:55,582
All right, how much did it cost?

36
00:01:55,617 --> 00:01:57,584
I told you, i...

37
00:01:57,619 --> 00:01:59,586
i know, you charged it,
but how much did it cost?

38
00:01:59,621 --> 00:02:00,587
Erich, that's enough.

39
00:02:00,622 --> 00:02:02,472
How much did it cost, annabelle?

40
00:02:02,507 --> 00:02:04,090
Erich, i don't think
it's the price of the doll

41
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:05,341
that's upsetting you.

42
00:02:05,376 --> 00:02:08,478
Now we'll get more
of that freudian gibberish

43
00:02:08,513 --> 00:02:10,346
you've been getting
from her doctor, huh?

44
00:02:10,381 --> 00:02:13,483
It isn't dr. Lubin's fault
she feels rejected.

45
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:18,488
My name is talky tina,
and i love you very much.

46
00:02:18,523 --> 00:02:20,990
Will you shut that thing off?!

47
00:02:27,997 --> 00:02:31,117
Oh, erich, how could you?

48
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:06,035
My name is talky tina,
and i don't think i like you.

49
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:11,658
Talky tina,
a doll that does everything,

50
00:03:11,693 --> 00:03:17,547
a lifelike creation of plastic
and springs and painted smile.

51
00:03:17,582 --> 00:03:19,415
To erich streator,

52
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:22,552
she is a most unwelcome addition
to his household-

53
00:03:22,587 --> 00:03:25,054
but without her
he'd never enter

54
00:03:25,089 --> 00:03:26,923
the twilight zone.

55
00:03:49,948 --> 00:03:51,781
My name is talky tina

56
00:03:51,816 --> 00:03:54,918
and i think i could
even hate you.

57
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:08,047
My name is talky tina,
and you'll be sorry.

58
00:04:12,435 --> 00:04:13,803
Why, erich?

59
00:04:13,838 --> 00:04:15,555
I don't like what it says.

60
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,690
You didn't have to throw it.

61
00:04:17,725 --> 00:04:22,061
It has quite
a vocabulary.

62
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:23,947
Here...

63
00:04:23,982 --> 00:04:27,700
listen.

64
00:04:27,735 --> 00:04:31,704
My name is talky tina,
and i love you very much.

65
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:37,827
Yeah, well, that's not
what it said a minute ago.

66
00:04:40,964 --> 00:04:43,082
I don't know how much more
of this i can take.

67
00:04:43,117 --> 00:04:45,585
Exactly what is
it you're taking,
annabelle?

68
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,470
Your anger
toward christie.

69
00:04:47,505 --> 00:04:50,473
I know you're having a
difficult time adjusting to her,

70
00:04:50,508 --> 00:04:52,342
but i can't let you
treat her this way.

71
00:04:52,377 --> 00:04:53,593
She's my daughter, erich.

72
00:04:53,628 --> 00:04:54,844
I love her.

73
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:56,729
"I love her."

74
00:04:57,347 --> 00:04:57,981
But i don't love her.

75
00:04:58,016 --> 00:04:59,849
I'm only her stepfather,

76
00:04:59,884 --> 00:05:01,734
and i'm incapable
of loving children

77
00:05:01,769 --> 00:05:03,603
because we can't
have any of our own.

78
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:06,239
Isn't that what you're
saying, annabelle?

79
00:05:06,274 --> 00:05:08,107
Erich, believe me, it's not.

80
00:05:08,142 --> 00:05:11,244
You could love christie,
i know you could

81
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:13,746
if you'd give yourself
half a chance.

82
00:05:13,781 --> 00:05:16,499
Good. I'm glad i'm not
the cold, cruel ogre

83
00:05:16,534 --> 00:05:18,368
that mommy and
daughter think i am.

84
00:05:18,403 --> 00:05:20,870
I appreciate all the
faithyou have in me.

85
00:05:20,905 --> 00:05:22,755
Erich, please
give us a chance-

86
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,007
christie and me.

87
00:05:24,042 --> 00:05:25,875
I know you got more
than you bargained for

88
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,126
when you married me.

89
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:30,263
Two for the price
of one, wasn't it?

90
00:05:30,298 --> 00:05:34,017
But we'll do anything
to make you happy- both of us.

91
00:05:34,052 --> 00:05:35,885
Daddy?

92
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:44,027
I'm sorry, daddy,
if i made you mad.

93
00:05:44,062 --> 00:05:45,895
It's all right,
christie.

94
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:47,780
It's all daddy's fault, okay?

95
00:05:47,815 --> 00:05:49,032
Sure, daddy.

96
00:05:49,067 --> 00:05:50,900
Here, dear.

97
00:05:54,072 --> 00:05:58,408
My name is talky tina,
and i love you very much.

98
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:08,418
Be a good girl, tina,
and eat your supper.

99
00:06:08,453 --> 00:06:11,554
Eat your own supper,
christie.

100
00:06:14,924 --> 00:06:18,428
I didn't know
your doll could wink.

101
00:06:18,463 --> 00:06:20,179
Tina can't wink, daddy.

102
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:23,933
Really? I thought...

103
00:06:23,968 --> 00:06:25,184
never mind.

104
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:27,070
Where'd you buy her?

105
00:06:27,105 --> 00:06:27,820
Mason's.

106
00:06:27,855 --> 00:06:30,323
She'll be a good playmate
for christie.

107
00:06:30,358 --> 00:06:33,443
Mm-hmm. Lacking a brother
or sister, you mean?

108
00:06:33,478 --> 00:06:35,328
I didn't say that.

109
00:06:35,363 --> 00:06:37,697
But that's why you bought
the doll, isn't it?

110
00:06:37,732 --> 00:06:38,948
Sort of a reminder?

111
00:06:38,983 --> 00:06:40,950
It hadn't occurred to me,

112
00:06:40,985 --> 00:06:45,338
but if that's what
you want to think...

113
00:06:52,462 --> 00:06:53,713
it's linda.

114
00:06:53,748 --> 00:06:55,598
Are you through
with your dinner?

115
00:06:55,633 --> 00:06:56,849
Yes, mommy.

116
00:06:56,884 --> 00:06:58,101
May i take tina?

117
00:06:58,136 --> 00:06:59,352
Not outside.

118
00:06:59,387 --> 00:07:02,472
You can show her
to linda later.

119
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:14,233
My name is talky tina,
and i'm beginning to hate you.

120
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:33,753
My name is erich streator,
and i'm going to get rid of you.

121
00:07:33,788 --> 00:07:35,138
You wouldn't dare.

122
00:07:35,173 --> 00:07:36,889
Oh?

123
00:07:39,008 --> 00:07:40,893
Wouldn't i?

124
00:07:40,928 --> 00:07:42,762
Annabelle would hate you,

125
00:07:42,797 --> 00:07:44,647
christie would hate you,

126
00:07:44,682 --> 00:07:46,516
andlwould hate you.

127
00:07:49,652 --> 00:07:52,772
Just seeing
how it works.

128
00:07:58,027 --> 00:07:58,661
Ow!

129
00:08:00,565 --> 00:08:02,415
So you have feelings.

130
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:04,283
Doesn't everything?

131
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:06,786
Then i can hurt you.

132
00:08:06,821 --> 00:08:10,540
Not really,
butlcould hurtyou.

133
00:08:13,828 --> 00:08:15,678
Threats from a doll.

134
00:08:15,713 --> 00:08:17,930
Who are you
talking to?

135
00:08:17,965 --> 00:08:19,182
Oh, here.

136
00:08:19,217 --> 00:08:21,050
The game's over.

137
00:08:21,085 --> 00:08:22,301
Game?

138
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:24,804
Come on, annabelle,
get off it.

139
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:27,306
How dense do you
think i am?

140
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:29,942
I wish i knew
what you were talking about.

141
00:08:29,977 --> 00:08:33,062
I admit i don't know much
about modern times

142
00:08:33,097 --> 00:08:35,565
like putting walkie-talkies
in dolls...

143
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,816
walkie-talkies?

144
00:08:36,851 --> 00:08:39,318
Get off it,
will you, annabelle?

145
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:42,455
I mean, all that stuff
about hating me

146
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:45,575
and that last bit about,
uh, feelings-

147
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:48,077
"doesn't everything?"

148
00:08:48,112 --> 00:08:49,962
You belong in comedy.

149
00:08:49,997 --> 00:08:52,465
I think i'll have more coffee.

150
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,836
Linda wants
to see tina.

151
00:08:56,871 --> 00:09:00,590
All right, dear.

152
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:04,343
My name is talky tina,
and i love you very much.

153
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:06,229
Isn't she
sweet, daddy?

154
00:09:08,731 --> 00:09:11,234
You can think
whatever you want to,

155
00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:12,485
but it's not true.

156
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,987
I'm not playing
a trick on you.

157
00:09:15,022 --> 00:09:16,239
Go ahead, pretend.

158
00:09:16,274 --> 00:09:18,107
But i know there's
a microphone around here.

159
00:09:18,142 --> 00:09:20,610
You and christie are trying
to get even with me,

160
00:09:20,645 --> 00:09:22,495
isn't that it?

161
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:24,363
That's ridiculous, erich,
and you know it.

162
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:25,615
Is it?

163
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:26,866
Then how come the doll

164
00:09:26,901 --> 00:09:28,751
doesn't talk to me
when you're in the room?

165
00:09:28,786 --> 00:09:30,620
You're really serious.

166
00:09:30,655 --> 00:09:32,505
You really mean it.

167
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:33,756
Of course i mean it.

168
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:35,007
So tell me.

169
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:37,510
There's nothing to tell!

170
00:09:37,545 --> 00:09:39,378
All right, don't tell me.

171
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:41,881
Keep your secret.

172
00:09:43,801 --> 00:09:45,017
But you'll be sorry.

173
00:09:48,271 --> 00:09:50,139
Christie?

174
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,276
Christie?

175
00:10:32,815 --> 00:10:35,935
You are going to be sorry.

176
00:11:02,845 --> 00:11:05,348
Where's tina, daddy?

177
00:11:05,383 --> 00:11:07,216
I wouldn't know.

178
00:11:07,251 --> 00:11:08,467
You had her, daddy.

179
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:10,353
Go ask your mother.

180
00:11:10,388 --> 00:11:12,221
She's already asked me.

181
00:11:12,256 --> 00:11:13,472
Hmm. And what did
you tell her?

182
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:15,975
That i don't know
where she is.

183
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,860
Do you, erich?

184
00:11:17,895 --> 00:11:19,729
Where is she, daddy?

185
00:11:19,764 --> 00:11:20,980
Well, now, if your
mother can't tell you,

186
00:11:21,015 --> 00:11:22,865
then neither can i.

187
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,368
Tina must be somewhere
about, christie.

188
00:11:25,403 --> 00:11:27,236
Let's see
if we can find her.

189
00:11:27,271 --> 00:11:28,487
Yes, mommy.

190
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:43,636
Hello? Hello?

191
00:11:43,671 --> 00:11:49,258
My name is talky tina,
and i'm going to kill you.

192
00:12:00,736 --> 00:12:02,605
Who is this?

193
00:12:03,239 --> 00:12:04,490
Annabelle?

194
00:12:04,525 --> 00:12:10,112
Hello?

195
00:12:50,786 --> 00:12:52,655
Annabelle?

196
00:12:55,157 --> 00:12:56,408
Annabelle?

197
00:12:58,294 --> 00:12:59,545
Where is she?

198
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,796
She's still looking.

199
00:13:00,831 --> 00:13:02,047
I don't mean
christie.

200
00:13:02,082 --> 00:13:03,916
We haven't found the doll,
if that's what you mean.

201
00:13:03,951 --> 00:13:05,167
That's exactly
what i mean.

202
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:06,418
You knew i put her
in the trash can.

203
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:07,670
You what?

204
00:13:07,705 --> 00:13:10,172
But she's
not there now.

205
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:11,423
Erich, how could you?

206
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,309
I've had enough
of this nonsense.

207
00:13:13,344 --> 00:13:14,560
A joke is a joke

208
00:13:14,595 --> 00:13:16,428
but you're carrying
it too far.

209
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:17,680
Me?

210
00:13:17,715 --> 00:13:18,314
You!

211
00:13:18,349 --> 00:13:19,565
And christie!

212
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,067
Will the two
of you stop it?!

213
00:13:22,102 --> 00:13:23,936
Erich, i haven't
seen the doll.

214
00:13:23,971 --> 00:13:26,438
I haven't even
seen it since dinner.

215
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:27,823
I swear it.

216
00:13:27,858 --> 00:13:30,442
You're telling the truth?

217
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:32,945
You didn't take it?

218
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:33,946
I didn't take it.

219
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:37,700
But i think it's dreadful,
your putting it there.

220
00:13:37,735 --> 00:13:41,203
But who?

221
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:42,454
The phone call.

222
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:45,207
What phone call?

223
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:47,343
You were on the extension,
you said...

224
00:13:47,378 --> 00:13:49,211
what are you
talking about?

225
00:13:49,246 --> 00:13:51,714
Didn't you do it?

226
00:13:51,749 --> 00:13:54,216
Do what?

227
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:56,218
No, it couldn't have been you.

228
00:13:56,253 --> 00:13:58,721
How could you have made
the phone ring?

229
00:13:58,756 --> 00:14:00,606
I mean, there are ways, but...

230
00:14:00,641 --> 00:14:01,724
erich...

231
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:02,975
the telephone rang.

232
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:04,360
I answered it.

233
00:14:04,395 --> 00:14:07,479
The doll's voice
was loud and clear.

234
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:13,118
It said, "my name is talky tina,
and i'm going to kill you."

235
00:14:13,153 --> 00:14:13,869
What?

236
00:14:13,904 --> 00:14:15,487
Would i lie?

237
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:18,123
Erich, i don't
know what to say.

238
00:14:18,158 --> 00:14:21,243
Well, the doll's disappeared.

239
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:24,380
If it wasn't you,
it had to be christie.

240
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:26,749
Erich.

241
00:15:11,293 --> 00:15:13,796
I told you
you'd be sorry.

242
00:15:13,831 --> 00:15:17,049
Christie.

243
00:15:17,084 --> 00:15:18,300
Wake up, christie.

244
00:15:18,934 --> 00:15:19,551
Daddy?

245
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:21,437
Go back to sleep,
christie.

246
00:15:21,472 --> 00:15:22,688
I want my tina.

247
00:15:22,723 --> 00:15:24,556
I'm going to borrow
tina for a little while.

248
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:26,442
Tina belongs to me.
Go back to sleep!

249
00:15:26,477 --> 00:15:28,310
What's happening?

250
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:29,561
The doll was
in her bed.

251
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:30,813
She's the one who's
been doing it.

252
00:15:30,848 --> 00:15:33,315
Daddy, daddy, please.

253
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:35,200
I'm not your daddy!

254
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:41,457
There, there.

255
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:07,483
Die.

256
00:16:07,518 --> 00:16:09,852
You'll die.

257
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:22,114
I thought you said
you had feelings.

258
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:24,867
I can stand it if you can.

259
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:27,429
Erich?

260
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:31,183
Erich, what
are you doing?

261
00:17:31,218 --> 00:17:32,434
What i have to do.

262
00:17:33,068 --> 00:17:34,436
Erich, don't.

263
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:36,688
Leave me alone.

264
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:40,252
What are you doing?

265
00:18:40,287 --> 00:18:42,137
What do you think
i'm doing?

266
00:18:42,172 --> 00:18:43,388
But why?

267
00:18:43,423 --> 00:18:46,508
How could i live with you
after what you've done?

268
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:47,759
I had to- the doll.

269
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:51,513
You had to, to show your hatred
for me and christie.

270
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:53,398
Now, look, annabelle.

271
00:18:53,433 --> 00:18:54,650
That doll talked to me.

272
00:18:54,685 --> 00:18:57,769
That doll said things
no doll should say.

273
00:18:57,804 --> 00:18:59,655
I had to get rid of it.

274
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:02,157
You've become
a stranger to me, erich,

275
00:19:02,192 --> 00:19:04,026
a sick,
neurotic stranger.

276
00:19:04,061 --> 00:19:07,779
You're filled with blind,
unreasonable hate.

277
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:10,916
You better see
a good psychiatrist.

278
00:19:16,538 --> 00:19:18,423
I couldn't have imagined it.

279
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:21,543
Tell him you tried
to kill a doll.

280
00:19:21,578 --> 00:19:25,931
I couldn't...

281
00:19:25,966 --> 00:19:32,187
what did you do
with it?

282
00:19:32,222 --> 00:19:34,690
I'll give it back.

283
00:19:34,725 --> 00:19:38,443
I'll give it back
to christie.

284
00:19:38,478 --> 00:19:41,563
Will that
solve things?

285
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:45,317
I don't know, erich.

286
00:20:29,611 --> 00:20:32,114
My name is talky tina,

287
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:34,616
and i don't forgive you.

288
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:36,501
Shut up.

289
00:20:36,536 --> 00:20:39,004
Please, shut up.

290
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:09,151
Tina.

291
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:12,904
Tina.

292
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:14,790
Oh, tina.

293
00:21:51,728 --> 00:21:54,830
What is it?

294
00:21:54,865 --> 00:21:58,583
I heard something.

295
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:02,954
Erich, i don't
hear anything.

296
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:08,593
No, stay there.

297
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:45,190
Erich!

298
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:52,314
Erich.

299
00:23:52,349 --> 00:23:56,067
My name is talky tina...

300
00:23:56,701 --> 00:24:00,455
...and you'd better
be nice to me.

301
00:24:03,825 --> 00:24:06,962
Of course, we all know
dolls can't really talk,

302
00:24:06,997 --> 00:24:09,464
and they certainly
can't commit murder.

303
00:24:09,499 --> 00:24:11,333
But to a child

304
00:24:11,368 --> 00:24:13,835
caught in the middle
of turmoil and conflict,

305
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:15,086
a doll can become many things:

306
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:18,223
Friend, defender, guardian.

307
00:24:18,258 --> 00:24:20,725
Especially a doll
like talky tina,

308
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,228
who did talk
and did commit murder-

309
00:24:23,263 --> 00:24:26,348
in the misty region
of the twilight zone.

310
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:33,405

00:24:39,696 --> 00:24:41,530
when man sits in his own rubble

314
00:24:41,565 --> 00:24:44,032

he's left to himself.
