1
00:00:06,606 --> 00:00:09,726
You unlock this door
with the key of imagination.

2
00:00:09,761 --> 00:00:11,611
Beyond it
is another dimension-

3
00:00:11,646 --> 00:00:13,363
a dimension of sound...

4
00:00:14,149 --> 00:00:17,867
a dimension of sight,
a dimension of mind.

5
00:00:17,902 --> 00:00:21,621
You're moving into a land
of both shadow and substance,

6
00:00:21,656 --> 00:00:23,490
of things and ideas.

7
00:00:23,525 --> 00:00:26,626
You've just crossed over
into the twilight zone.

8
00:01:45,321 --> 00:01:47,207
Couple of beers,
honey, huh?

9
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:50,960
Man, listen
to that squeak.

10
00:01:50,995 --> 00:01:52,212
What do you expect?

11
00:01:52,247 --> 00:01:54,080
Well, when we
get paid off,

12
00:01:54,115 --> 00:01:56,583
he'll get all the
oil paste he needs.

13
00:01:56,618 --> 00:01:57,834
If we can find any.

14
00:01:57,869 --> 00:01:59,719
Well, why shouldn't we?

15
00:01:59,754 --> 00:02:01,588
Because they don't
make it anymore.

16
00:02:01,623 --> 00:02:04,724
That's crazy, there's
plenty of b2's around.

17
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:05,341
Name five.

18
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:10,346
Will he be all right?

19
00:02:10,381 --> 00:02:12,232
If he don't get hit.

20
00:02:13,483 --> 00:02:15,985
Well, it's no use
glaring at me

21
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,237
you know
he's shot.

22
00:02:17,272 --> 00:02:20,356
That ain't true,
he just needs a little work.

23
00:02:20,391 --> 00:02:22,242
Yeah, a little
$3,000, 4,000 overhaul

24
00:02:22,277 --> 00:02:24,744
with parts they
don't make anymore.

25
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:27,247
Thanks.

26
00:02:32,869 --> 00:02:34,120
The way
you tell it, pole,

27
00:02:34,155 --> 00:02:37,257
you'd think he was ready
for the scrapheap.

28
00:02:37,292 --> 00:02:38,508
Ain't he?

29
00:02:38,543 --> 00:02:40,009
No, he ain't.

30
00:02:40,044 --> 00:02:41,878
There's plenty of fight
left in maxo.

31
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:46,266
Well, is he going
to be all right?

32
00:02:46,301 --> 00:02:48,017
Steel, i don't know.

33
00:02:48,052 --> 00:02:49,269
He needs work-
you know that.

34
00:02:49,304 --> 00:02:51,137
The trigger springs
in his left arm

35
00:02:51,172 --> 00:02:53,022
has been rewired
so many times,

36
00:02:53,057 --> 00:02:54,274
it's just about had it.

37
00:02:54,309 --> 00:02:56,142
He's got no protection
on that side.

38
00:02:56,177 --> 00:02:58,027
The eye lens
is cracked.

39
00:02:58,062 --> 00:03:01,147
The leg cables
are worn- they
got no tension.

40
00:03:01,182 --> 00:03:02,398
Even his gyro is off.

41
00:03:02,433 --> 00:03:04,901
Not to mention
the oil paste
he ain't got.

42
00:03:04,936 --> 00:03:06,152
We'll get him some.

43
00:03:06,187 --> 00:03:08,037
Yeah, afterthe fight.

44
00:03:08,072 --> 00:03:09,906
What aboutduring
the fight?

45
00:03:09,941 --> 00:03:11,157
He'll be creaking
around that ring

46
00:03:11,192 --> 00:03:12,408
like a steam shovel.

47
00:03:12,443 --> 00:03:13,660
It'll be a miracle
if he goes two rounds.

48
00:03:13,695 --> 00:03:15,545
It's not that bad, pole.

49
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,413
It's worse-
wait till that crowd

50
00:03:17,448 --> 00:03:19,916
gets a load of battling maxo
from philadelphia.

51
00:03:19,951 --> 00:03:22,418
We'll be lucky to get
our car fare home

52
00:03:22,453 --> 00:03:23,670
much less 500 bucks.

53
00:03:23,705 --> 00:03:26,172
They can't back out
of the contract.

54
00:03:26,207 --> 00:03:28,675
The contract is
for battling maxo-

55
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,560
not this steam
shovel here.

56
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:33,062
Maxo's going to do all right.

57
00:03:33,097 --> 00:03:34,314
Against a b7?

58
00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:38,067
It's a starter b7- don't even
have the kinks worked out yet.

59
00:03:38,102 --> 00:03:39,936
Aw...

60
00:03:42,438 --> 00:03:44,324
battling maxo-
one-round maxo

61
00:03:44,359 --> 00:03:46,192
the battling
steam shovel.

62
00:03:46,227 --> 00:03:47,443
Will you shut up?

63
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:50,580
What are you always
knocking him for?

64
00:03:50,615 --> 00:03:52,448
He's been doing all right
for five years.

65
00:03:52,483 --> 00:03:53,082
He'll keep doing okay.

66
00:03:53,117 --> 00:03:55,585
Okay, so he needs a little work,
a little oil paste.

67
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,087
We get the 500 bucks,
we'll get him that stuff-

68
00:03:58,122 --> 00:04:00,590
new trigger spring,
oil paste, eye lens, everything.

69
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:09,349
Yeah, you'll do okay, boy.

70
00:04:09,384 --> 00:04:11,217
You'll do okay.

71
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:17,473
Sports item, circa 1974:

72
00:04:17,508 --> 00:04:19,976
Battling maxo, b2, heavyweight,

73
00:04:20,011 --> 00:04:23,112
accompanied by his
manager and handler,

74
00:04:23,147 --> 00:04:27,233
arrives in maynard, kansas,
for a scheduled six-round bout.

75
00:04:27,268 --> 00:04:30,987
Battling maxo is a robot,
or, to be exact, an android,

76
00:04:31,022 --> 00:04:34,123
an automaton
resembling a human being.

77
00:04:34,158 --> 00:04:37,877
Only these automatons have
been permitted in the ring

78
00:04:37,912 --> 00:04:40,997
since prizefighting was
legally abolished in 1968.

79
00:04:41,032 --> 00:04:44,133
This is the story of that
scheduled six-round bout.

80
00:04:44,168 --> 00:04:46,636
More specifically,
the story of two men

81
00:04:46,671 --> 00:04:49,138
shortly to face
that remorseless truth:

82
00:04:49,173 --> 00:04:51,007
That no law can be passed

83
00:04:51,042 --> 00:04:54,143
which will abolish cruelty
or desperate need,

84
00:04:54,178 --> 00:04:56,646
nor, for that matter,
blind animal courage.

85
00:04:56,681 --> 00:04:59,148
Location for the facing
of said truth

86
00:04:59,183 --> 00:05:01,017
a small, smoke-filled arena

87
00:05:01,052 --> 00:05:04,153
just this side
of the twilight zone.

88
00:05:39,722 --> 00:05:40,973
Oh, for...

89
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:42,225
tip him, huh.

90
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:45,361
What's the use?
Tip him!

91
00:05:52,235 --> 00:05:54,120
Okay.

92
00:05:58,491 --> 00:05:59,742
You know,
i don't get you, pole.

93
00:05:59,777 --> 00:06:01,627
After seven months,
we finally get a bout

94
00:06:01,662 --> 00:06:02,879
and all you can do
is complain.

95
00:06:02,914 --> 00:06:04,130
Some bout-
maynard, kansas,

96
00:06:04,165 --> 00:06:06,632
the prizefighting
center of the nation.

97
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:08,501
It's a start, ain't it?

98
00:06:08,536 --> 00:06:10,753
What we earn here,
we can put maxo back in shape.

99
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:12,004
Huh, if he wins.
Hah!

100
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:13,256
You know,
i don't get you, pole.

101
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:14,507
He's our fighter.

102
00:06:14,542 --> 00:06:15,758
Now, why do you keep
writing him off?

103
00:06:15,793 --> 00:06:17,009
I'm a class-a
mechanic, steel,

104
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:18,261
not a daydreaming kid.

105
00:06:18,296 --> 00:06:19,512
We got us a piece
of dead iron here.

106
00:06:19,547 --> 00:06:21,397
Shh. Somebody will hear you.

107
00:06:21,432 --> 00:06:23,266
Simple mechanics-
maxo will be lucky

108
00:06:23,301 --> 00:06:25,151
to get out of the ring
with his head on.

109
00:06:25,186 --> 00:06:27,653
Wrong. It's a starter
b7, full of kinks.

110
00:06:27,688 --> 00:06:28,905
Just full of them.

111
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:32,024
Sure, sure.

112
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:36,529
Come in.

113
00:06:38,414 --> 00:06:39,665
Mr. Nolan?

114
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,917
No, maxwell.

115
00:06:40,952 --> 00:06:44,036
Nolan will be back in
a couple of minutes.

116
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:47,790
I'm, uh...
i'm kelly.

117
00:06:47,825 --> 00:06:49,675
Battling maxo's
manager.

118
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:50,927
Oh, yeah.

119
00:06:50,962 --> 00:06:53,429
And this is pole,
my mechanic.

120
00:06:53,464 --> 00:06:55,298
Sit down. Nolan
will be right back.

121
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:56,549
Oh, thanks, thanks.

122
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:03,439
Uh... maybe
you heard

123
00:07:03,474 --> 00:07:05,308
about my fighter,
mr. Maxwell.

124
00:07:05,343 --> 00:07:06,559
Hmm?

125
00:07:06,594 --> 00:07:08,060
You heard of my fighter?

126
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:09,312
Nope.

127
00:07:09,347 --> 00:07:10,563
Oh, he was almost the world's

128
00:07:10,598 --> 00:07:11,814
heavyweight champion once.

129
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:16,202
I... i used to be
a heavyweight myself.

130
00:07:16,237 --> 00:07:18,704
Before the law was passed,
of course.

131
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:24,327
Yeah, i used to box under
the name of "steel" kelly.

132
00:07:24,362 --> 00:07:28,080
They called me that because
i never got knocked down.

133
00:07:29,966 --> 00:07:31,834
Not... not once.

134
00:07:33,469 --> 00:07:36,589
Well, going to be
a great fight tonight, huh?

135
00:07:38,474 --> 00:07:41,227
My boy took dimsey the rock
back in '71.

136
00:07:41,262 --> 00:07:42,478
You remember that.

137
00:07:42,513 --> 00:07:43,095
Nope.

138
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,347
It was all over the

139
00:07:44,382 --> 00:07:45,598
east coast newspapers-

140
00:07:45,633 --> 00:07:46,849
boston, new york, philly.

141
00:07:46,884 --> 00:07:49,352
Well, that's where
we're from- philly.

142
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:54,357
Yeah, biggest upset of the
year- made the headlines.

143
00:07:54,991 --> 00:07:55,608
Mr. Nolan?

144
00:07:55,643 --> 00:07:56,859
Hmm?

145
00:07:56,894 --> 00:07:58,110
Kelly.

146
00:07:58,145 --> 00:07:59,996
I was wondering
if you'd make it.

147
00:08:00,031 --> 00:08:00,613
Your fighter in shape?

148
00:08:00,648 --> 00:08:03,115
Oh, yes, sir, my mechanic here
took him apart

149
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:06,252
and put him back together
before we left philly.

150
00:08:06,287 --> 00:08:07,503
You're lucky
to get a bout.

151
00:08:07,538 --> 00:08:11,257
We ain't used nothing less
than b4's in almost two years.

152
00:08:11,292 --> 00:08:14,377
Fighter we had got ruined
in a car wreck, though.

153
00:08:14,412 --> 00:08:16,262
Oh, you got nothing
to worry about, mr. Nolan.

154
00:08:16,297 --> 00:08:17,513
My fighther's in top shape.

155
00:08:17,548 --> 00:08:18,764
Hey, you know,

156
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:21,267
he took dimsey the rock
back in '71.

157
00:08:21,302 --> 00:08:23,135
I just want a good fight.

158
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,021
Oh, you'll get it, mr. Nolan.

159
00:08:25,056 --> 00:08:26,889
You'll get it.

160
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:28,774
Oh, uh, do you have a ready room

161
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:30,026
that we can use?

162
00:08:30,061 --> 00:08:32,528
I like to give him
a last-minute check.

163
00:08:32,563 --> 00:08:34,397
Number five, down the hall.

164
00:08:34,432 --> 00:08:36,282
And your bout's at 9:00.

165
00:08:36,317 --> 00:08:37,783
Yes, sir.

166
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:42,154
Oh, mr. Nolan, uh... i, uh...

167
00:08:42,405 --> 00:08:44,907
you'll get your money
after you deliver a fight.

168
00:08:44,942 --> 00:08:48,661
Yes, sir.

169
00:08:48,696 --> 00:08:49,912
Okay, see you then.

170
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:53,049
Mr. Maxwell.

171
00:08:54,417 --> 00:08:55,918
Oh, boy.

172
00:08:59,055 --> 00:09:00,306
Five.

173
00:09:10,933 --> 00:09:13,436
I want you to check
him over good, now.

174
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,070
What for?

175
00:09:14,105 --> 00:09:15,321
Did you hear me?

176
00:09:15,356 --> 00:09:17,189
Yeah.

177
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:19,075
He's going to take
that lousy b7.

178
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:21,577
Sure he is,
with his teeth.

179
00:09:21,612 --> 00:09:24,080
I wish we'd have gotten
that oil paste.

180
00:09:24,115 --> 00:09:27,833
I told you they wouldn't sell
any here- why should they?

181
00:09:27,868 --> 00:09:30,953
Maxo is probably the only b2
in a thousand miles.

182
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:39,712
I hear morley's
coming out with
a b9 this year.

183
00:09:39,747 --> 00:09:41,597
Hypertrigger in
both arms and legs.

184
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:45,968
All steeled aluminum,
triple gyro, triple-
twisted wiring.

185
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:49,722
Say it'll be able
to stand up after
knockdowns, too.

186
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:58,230
Well, is he okay?

187
00:09:58,265 --> 00:09:59,482
Sure, he's great.

188
00:10:02,618 --> 00:10:04,487
If this
doesn't blow.

189
00:10:04,522 --> 00:10:05,738
Well, why should it?

190
00:10:05,773 --> 00:10:08,874
It's subpar, i told you
that eight months ago.

191
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:11,377
Well, we'll get another
one after the bout.

192
00:10:11,412 --> 00:10:13,879
Yeah, another 75 bucks
down the drain.

193
00:10:13,914 --> 00:10:16,382
Look, he's earning us
$500, ain't he?

194
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:20,136
Go easy on that left.

195
00:10:20,171 --> 00:10:23,139
If it don't work now,
it won't work tonight.

196
00:10:23,174 --> 00:10:24,890
Save it.

197
00:10:24,925 --> 00:10:27,393
Okay, set him so he don't
counterpunch.

198
00:10:50,032 --> 00:10:52,034
Oh, they'll hear him
in the back row.

199
00:10:52,535 --> 00:10:54,420
All right, try the rest.

200
00:10:54,455 --> 00:10:56,789
He'll get more than two punches
thrown at his head.

201
00:10:56,824 --> 00:10:58,674
Try the rest, i said.

202
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:16,192
Okay, put him
on automatic.

203
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:31,707
Oh, he's beautiful,
just beautiful.

204
00:11:31,742 --> 00:11:33,576
We got to
put him on defense.

205
00:11:33,611 --> 00:11:35,461
He'll get
chopped to pieces

206
00:11:35,496 --> 00:11:36,712
if we let him move in.

207
00:11:36,747 --> 00:11:37,963
No.

208
00:11:37,998 --> 00:11:38,581
Oh, for...

209
00:11:38,616 --> 00:11:40,466
he's a b2, steel, a b2!

210
00:11:40,501 --> 00:11:42,968
He's going to get
slaughtered anyway

211
00:11:43,003 --> 00:11:44,837
we might as well
save the...

212
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:47,973
but the contract
calls for him to
be on offensive.

213
00:11:48,008 --> 00:11:49,225
Ah, what's the use?

214
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,093
Come on, let's
test him some more.

215
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:52,344
What for, he's...

216
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:54,847
will you just
do like i say?

217
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:01,103
What'd you do?

218
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:03,606
I told you not to
mess with that left.

219
00:12:03,641 --> 00:12:04,857
So help you
if you broke it.

220
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:06,742
Ifibroke it!

221
00:12:06,777 --> 00:12:09,245
Listen, this heap's been
going on borrowed time

222
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,113
for the past
three years.

223
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:13,616
Don't you talk to me
about breakages!

224
00:12:13,651 --> 00:12:14,867
Open him up.

225
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:16,752
Sure, sure.

226
00:12:21,123 --> 00:12:23,008
You just find
another mechanic

227
00:12:23,043 --> 00:12:24,376
who could have kept
this steam shovel going

228
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:25,628
these last few years-

229
00:12:25,663 --> 00:12:26,378
you just find one.

230
00:12:42,778 --> 00:12:44,029
Fix it.

231
00:12:44,064 --> 00:12:44,647
Steel, i...

232
00:12:44,682 --> 00:12:45,898
fix it.

233
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:47,149
Steel, i can't.

234
00:12:47,184 --> 00:12:49,034
Look, you broke it,
now you fix it!

235
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:50,286
Let go of me.

236
00:12:50,321 --> 00:12:51,537
It's got to be fixed.

237
00:12:51,572 --> 00:12:53,405
It needs a new spring.

238
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,657
Then get one.

239
00:12:54,692 --> 00:12:57,793
They don't have them here,
don't you understand?

240
00:12:57,828 --> 00:12:59,662
They don't
make them anymore.

241
00:13:25,321 --> 00:13:27,823
Well, if they don't
watch the fights...

242
00:13:27,858 --> 00:13:29,074
what?

243
00:13:29,109 --> 00:13:32,194
If nolan and maxwell
don't watch the bouts.

244
00:13:32,695 --> 00:13:35,197
What are you talk...

245
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:37,082
what are you, crazy?

246
00:13:37,117 --> 00:13:38,334
You're out of your mind.

247
00:13:38,369 --> 00:13:40,202
You can't do that.

248
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:42,705
We deliver a fight
or we don't get paid.

249
00:13:43,339 --> 00:13:45,207
Come on, steel,
they'll never let you.

250
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:46,458
You can't make them
believe that...

251
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:48,344
listen, you can't do it.

252
00:13:48,379 --> 00:13:50,212
Nobody knows what
maxo looks like.

253
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:55,467
Only those two guys
in the office saw me,

254
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:58,604
and if nolan and maxwell
don't watch the bouts,

255
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,106
well, why should
the crowd know?

256
00:14:01,141 --> 00:14:02,358
Steel!

257
00:14:02,393 --> 00:14:04,226
Well, the b2's bleed just
like any of the new ones,

258
00:14:04,261 --> 00:14:05,477
and bruise and
the whole thing.

259
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:07,980
Look, i can wire
my sister.

260
00:14:08,015 --> 00:14:10,482
She'll send us the
dough to get back east.

261
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:14,236
Steel, i know a guy in philly
wants to sell a b5 cheap.

262
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,739
We can scurry up
the cash with it.

263
00:14:16,774 --> 00:14:18,624
Steel, use your head,
will you?

264
00:14:18,659 --> 00:14:21,126
It's a b7-
you'll get mangled.

265
00:14:22,878 --> 00:14:25,497
I'm not going to
let you do it, i...

266
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,885
you're going to help me

267
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,388
or i'm going to
beat your brains out.

268
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:36,141
You'll get killed, steel.

269
00:14:39,895 --> 00:14:41,146
Then i will.

270
00:15:18,968 --> 00:15:20,219
Hey.

271
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:22,721
You're late.

272
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:25,858
Where's the owner?

273
00:15:25,893 --> 00:15:28,978
In the audience.

274
00:15:39,622 --> 00:15:41,373
I should've told him.

275
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:42,625
I would've killed
you if you had.

276
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,493
You'll have to towel
me off between rounds.

277
00:15:44,528 --> 00:15:46,378
Between what round?
You won't last even one.

278
00:15:46,413 --> 00:15:47,630
What do you think
you're going up against,

279
00:15:47,665 --> 00:15:48,881
another fighter?

280
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:51,383
You're going against
a machine, you big, dumb...

281
00:15:51,418 --> 00:15:52,635
just do like i say, huh?

282
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:54,503
If i towel you off,
they'll know, won't they?

283
00:15:54,538 --> 00:15:56,388
Look, they ain't seen a
b2 around here in years.

284
00:15:56,423 --> 00:15:57,640
Nolan said so.

285
00:15:57,675 --> 00:15:59,508
Anybody asks, just tell
them it's an oil leak.

286
00:15:59,543 --> 00:16:01,393
Sure, sure.

287
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:13,656
Well, if it ain't
battlin' maxo!

288
00:16:13,691 --> 00:16:16,158
Scrap iron, scrap iron!

289
00:16:16,193 --> 00:16:18,027
Scrap iron, scrap iron!

290
00:16:56,949 --> 00:17:00,202
Ladies and gentlemen!

291
00:17:00,237 --> 00:17:03,322
The fifth contest
of the evening-

292
00:17:03,357 --> 00:17:06,458
a six-round heavyweight bout

293
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:09,578
featuring, from philadelphia,

294
00:17:09,613 --> 00:17:13,966
a b2, battling maxo!

295
00:17:19,088 --> 00:17:21,090
Get that pile of junk
out of here!

296
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:23,592
Rattlin' maxo, you mean!

297
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:30,099
And his opponent, our own b7,

298
00:17:30,134 --> 00:17:33,235
the maynard flash.

299
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:52,121
This is
your last chance.

300
00:17:52,156 --> 00:17:52,755
Get out.

301
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:54,623
Stay away
from him, then.

302
00:18:14,276 --> 00:18:16,395
Get that tanker a bicycle!

303
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:18,397
Get that junk pile out of there!

304
00:18:29,792 --> 00:18:31,660
Don't do it.

305
00:18:54,183 --> 00:18:56,685
Kill him, kill him, kill him!

306
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,937
Kill him!

307
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:52,491
No.

308
00:20:13,896 --> 00:20:15,764
What a fighterheis!

309
00:20:20,769 --> 00:20:23,272
Can you get up?

310
00:20:23,307 --> 00:20:24,523
Steel, can you get up?

311
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:26,408
All right,
hold it, now.

312
00:20:26,443 --> 00:20:27,659
Hold it.

313
00:20:27,694 --> 00:20:30,529
The robe.

314
00:20:30,564 --> 00:20:31,163
What?

315
00:20:31,198 --> 00:20:33,031
Get the robe.

316
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:40,038
Hold it down,
that's enough, now.

317
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,682
Ladies and gentlemen,
the winner,

318
00:20:50,717 --> 00:20:54,436
in two minutes and 20
seconds of the first round,

319
00:20:54,471 --> 00:20:56,305
the maynard flash!

320
00:21:03,347 --> 00:21:06,448
Get that pile of tin
out of here!

321
00:21:06,483 --> 00:21:08,317
Rusty pile of junk!

322
00:21:08,352 --> 00:21:09,568
Get out of here!

323
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:07,125
You big, dumb...

324
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:11,013
what?

325
00:22:11,048 --> 00:22:12,264
Go get the money.

326
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:14,016
But...

327
00:22:14,051 --> 00:22:15,267
now.

328
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:53,055
Oh, you get
the money, huh?

329
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:54,306
Did you get the money?

330
00:22:54,341 --> 00:22:55,557
Half of it.

331
00:22:55,592 --> 00:22:56,675
What do you mean?

332
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:59,811
He wouldn't pay five c's
for a one-rounder.

333
00:22:59,846 --> 00:23:00,679
Are you kidding?

334
00:23:00,714 --> 00:23:03,815
Steel, steel, there's
nothing we can do about it.

335
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:06,318
He's got a bunch
of toughs in there.

336
00:23:06,353 --> 00:23:08,186
We're lucky he
didn't run us

337
00:23:08,221 --> 00:23:10,072
out of town
on the rails.

338
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:16,945
Okay.

339
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,196
We'll take the bus back.

340
00:23:18,231 --> 00:23:20,699
We'll take the bus
back all the way.

341
00:23:20,734 --> 00:23:23,702
That'll cost us
about 60, 70 bucks.

342
00:23:23,737 --> 00:23:26,204
That'll leave us 200 almost.

343
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:30,592
We can get a new lens plate,
trigger springs, oil paste.

344
00:23:30,627 --> 00:23:32,461
Yeah, lots of oil paste.

345
00:23:32,496 --> 00:23:34,346
Maxo will be good as new, huh?

346
00:23:34,381 --> 00:23:36,715
We'll get some
good bouts,
maxo, huh?

347
00:23:38,967 --> 00:23:41,470
That's all he needs
is a little overhaul-

348
00:23:41,505 --> 00:23:44,606
oil paste, trigger springs,
eye lens.

349
00:23:44,641 --> 00:23:47,109
Yeah, maxo's going
to be all right.

350
00:23:47,144 --> 00:23:49,978
We'll show 'em
what a good
b2 can do

351
00:23:50,013 --> 00:23:51,613
huh, maxo, right? Right.

352
00:23:51,648 --> 00:23:53,482
Right, pole, huh?

353
00:23:53,517 --> 00:23:54,483
Huh?

354
00:23:54,518 --> 00:23:55,734
Sure, steel.

355
00:23:57,235 --> 00:23:59,121
Portrait of a losing side,

356
00:23:59,156 --> 00:24:02,240
proof positive that you
can't outpunch machinery.

357
00:24:02,275 --> 00:24:04,126
Proof also of something else:

358
00:24:04,161 --> 00:24:06,628
That no matter
what the future brings,

359
00:24:06,663 --> 00:24:10,382
man's capacity to rise to the
occasion will remain unaltered.

360
00:24:10,417 --> 00:24:13,502
His potential for tenacity
and optimism continues,

361
00:24:13,537 --> 00:24:16,638
as always, to outfight,
outpoint and outlive

362
00:24:16,673 --> 00:24:19,141
any and all changes
made by his society,

363
00:24:19,176 --> 00:24:22,260
for which three cheers
and a unanimous decision

364
00:24:22,295 --> 00:24:25,397
rendered from the twilight zone.
