1
00:00:11,229 --> 00:00:13,697
You're traveling
through another dimension

2
00:00:13,732 --> 00:00:16,199
a dimension not only
of sight and sound, but of mind

3
00:00:16,234 --> 00:00:18,084
a journey into a wondrous land

4
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:20,587
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

5
00:00:20,622 --> 00:00:21,838
That's the signpost up ahead.

6
00:00:21,873 --> 00:00:23,707
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

7
00:00:27,093 --> 00:00:30,847
Uniquely american institution
known as the neighborhood bar.

8
00:00:30,882 --> 00:00:34,601
Reading left to right are
mr. Anthony o'toole, proprietor

9
00:00:34,636 --> 00:00:36,469
who waters his drinks
like geraniums

10
00:00:37,103 --> 00:00:39,606
but who stands four-square
for peace and quiet

11
00:00:39,641 --> 00:00:41,474
and for booths for ladies.

12
00:00:41,509 --> 00:00:44,611
This is mr. Joseph j. Callahan,
an unregistered bookie

13
00:00:44,646 --> 00:00:47,113
whose entire life is
any sporting event

14
00:00:47,148 --> 00:00:48,982
with two sides
and a set of odds.

15
00:00:49,017 --> 00:00:52,118
His idea of a meeting at
the summit is any dialogue

16
00:00:52,153 --> 00:00:55,872
between a catcher and pitcher
with more than one man on base.

17
00:00:55,907 --> 00:00:58,992
And this animated citizen
is every anonymous bettor

18
00:00:59,027 --> 00:01:00,243
who ever dropped rent money

19
00:01:00,278 --> 00:01:03,997
on a horse race or prize fight
or a floating crap game

20
00:01:04,032 --> 00:01:07,133
and who took out his
frustrations and his insolvency

21
00:01:07,168 --> 00:01:09,636
on any vulnerable fellow
barstool companion

22
00:01:09,671 --> 00:01:11,504
within arm's and fist's reach.

23
00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:15,258
And this is mr. Luther dingle,
a vacuum cleaner salesman

24
00:01:15,293 --> 00:01:18,394
whose volume of business
is roughly that

25
00:01:18,429 --> 00:01:19,646
of a valet
at a hobo convention.

26
00:01:19,681 --> 00:01:22,766
He's a consummate failure
in almost everything

27
00:01:22,801 --> 00:01:25,902
but is a good listener
and has a prominent jaw.

28
00:01:25,937 --> 00:01:27,771
Don't give me
that, callahan.

29
00:01:27,806 --> 00:01:29,656
I don't pay off
on a bum call.

30
00:01:29,691 --> 00:01:32,158
Three umpires call
the man out.

31
00:01:32,193 --> 00:01:33,409
I call
the man out.

32
00:01:33,444 --> 00:01:35,912
60,000 fans call
the man out.

33
00:01:35,947 --> 00:01:38,281
The final score was
pittsburgh 3, dodgers nothing.

34
00:01:38,316 --> 00:01:40,166
You and i got an even bet, pal.

35
00:01:40,201 --> 00:01:41,417
I happened to have the pirates.

36
00:01:41,452 --> 00:01:43,286
You got the dodgers.

37
00:01:43,321 --> 00:01:45,171
So you owe me
five dollars.

38
00:01:45,206 --> 00:01:47,040
The ball was foul
when it hit him

39
00:01:47,075 --> 00:01:49,542
so instead of an out,
it was a foul ball.

40
00:01:49,577 --> 00:01:52,679
So who's to say there wouldn't
have been a man on base?

41
00:01:52,714 --> 00:01:55,181
And when pignatano got a single
a run would have scored.

42
00:01:55,216 --> 00:01:56,432
And furthermore, callahan,

43
00:01:56,467 --> 00:01:59,552
you're nothing but a cheating
insult to the american bookie.

44
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:05,191
I'll give you five seconds
to take back that innuendo.

45
00:02:06,309 --> 00:02:07,560
Callahan, i told you
once before already.

46
00:02:07,595 --> 00:02:10,063
You start another brawl
in here

47
00:02:10,098 --> 00:02:12,565
and i'm going to fix
that mouth of yours

48
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,818
so any future
drinking you'll do

49
00:02:14,853 --> 00:02:16,069
is gonna be through
a tube stuck in a vein.

50
00:02:16,104 --> 00:02:17,704
Me? Why me?
Tell it to the troublemaker.

51
00:02:17,739 --> 00:02:18,955
The number-one welcher

52
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:21,958
of all the western states
sitting over here.

53
00:02:21,993 --> 00:02:25,962
His father owes my father from
the second dempsey-tunney fight.

54
00:02:25,997 --> 00:02:27,213
Yeah? Yeah? Yeah?

55
00:02:27,248 --> 00:02:29,082
Mainly on account of
it was a bum call.

56
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:33,837
Hey, buddy, did you see
the tunney fight?

57
00:02:33,872 --> 00:02:35,722
You remember the referee
with the long count?

58
00:02:35,757 --> 00:02:37,590
The guy was knocked
clear out of the ring.

59
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:40,093
You could have gone up in the
stands, got a can of beer

60
00:02:40,128 --> 00:02:41,344
engaged in a
little conversation

61
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:43,229
come back,
sit down in your seat

62
00:02:43,264 --> 00:02:45,098
and the referee still
wasn't finished counting.

63
00:02:45,133 --> 00:02:46,349
Now, i ask you,
how about that?

64
00:02:46,384 --> 00:02:47,984
I ask you,
how about it?

65
00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:49,235
Me?

66
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,486
Yeah, yeah, you.

67
00:02:50,521 --> 00:02:52,355
Did you watch the game
on television last night?

68
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,606
You talk about
bum calls.

69
00:02:53,641 --> 00:02:54,858
Duke snider was up

70
00:02:54,893 --> 00:02:56,109
and it was in
the ninth inning.

71
00:02:56,144 --> 00:02:57,360
Two men were out.

72
00:02:57,395 --> 00:02:59,245
Howard and moon were
on first and second.

73
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,114
And this umpire
with no pupils in his eyes

74
00:03:01,149 --> 00:03:02,999
calls a foul ball an out.
Did you see it?

75
00:03:03,034 --> 00:03:06,753
) as a matter of fact i did
watch the game on television.

76
00:03:06,788 --> 00:03:09,255
Exceptional defensive play,
exceptional.

77
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:11,758
Abner d-d-doubleday
would have been proud.

78
00:03:11,793 --> 00:03:14,510
Never mind about
abner doubleday.

79
00:03:14,545 --> 00:03:17,630
I'm willing to leave
it up to you.

80
00:03:17,665 --> 00:03:19,515
Was it a foul ball
or was it an out?

81
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:22,635
It appears to me that the ball
fell into fair territory

82
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,520
and therefore when
striking the ground

83
00:03:24,555 --> 00:03:25,772
and hitting the batter

84
00:03:25,807 --> 00:03:27,640
the rules very definitely state
the batter was out.

85
00:03:27,675 --> 00:03:30,143
You asked the man,
you got an answer.

86
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:32,028
Of course you
realize, pal

87
00:03:32,063 --> 00:03:34,530
that you're
calling me a liar.

88
00:03:34,565 --> 00:03:36,399
Now, i'm not an
unreasonable man

89
00:03:36,434 --> 00:03:38,284
so i'm going
to give you

90
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,535
one more chance.

91
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:41,404
Was it a
foul ball

92
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:42,155
or was it
an out?

93
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:44,657
Well, it's
my considered opinion...

94
00:03:47,911 --> 00:03:49,796
how's come you got to
always be hitting dingle?

95
00:03:50,413 --> 00:03:52,916
You hit him last week,
you him the week before.

96
00:03:52,951 --> 00:03:54,167
A man can only
stand so much.

97
00:03:54,202 --> 00:03:56,052
I'm tired of this guy
contradicting me.

98
00:03:56,087 --> 00:03:57,303
And when a guy
calls me a liar

99
00:03:57,338 --> 00:03:59,172
there's my honor
to be considered.

100
00:03:59,207 --> 00:04:00,423
Your honor?

101
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:01,674
You've got nothing
in line in you

102
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:03,559
from the bottom
of your arches

103
00:04:03,594 --> 00:04:04,811
to where you
part your hair

104
00:04:04,846 --> 00:04:06,062
which is pretty tough
to find.

105
00:04:06,097 --> 00:04:07,313
And when you die

106
00:04:07,348 --> 00:04:09,816
they'll have to screw you in the ground.

107
00:04:09,851 --> 00:04:11,067
Am i crooked?

108
00:04:11,102 --> 00:04:12,936
You got to
believe me.

109
00:04:12,971 --> 00:04:14,187
Am i crooked?

110
00:04:14,222 --> 00:04:16,072
Dingle, dingle,
for once...

111
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:19,192
for once, why can't
you be neutral?

112
00:04:19,227 --> 00:04:20,443
Am i crooked?

113
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,328
Why don't you tell the man?

114
00:04:22,363 --> 00:04:24,197
Wait a minute,
back off.

115
00:04:24,232 --> 00:04:27,333
Are you serious
about this?

116
00:04:27,368 --> 00:04:32,956
And these two unseen gentlemen
are visitors from outer space.

117
00:04:32,991 --> 00:04:36,092
They're about to alter
the destiny of luther dingle

118
00:04:36,127 --> 00:04:37,961
by leaving him a legacy

119
00:04:37,996 --> 00:04:40,463
the kind you can't
hardly find no more.

120
00:04:40,498 --> 00:04:43,599
In just a moment, a sad-faced,
perennial punching bag

121
00:04:43,634 --> 00:04:46,719
who missed even the caboose
of life's gravy train

122
00:04:46,754 --> 00:04:48,604
will take a short constitutional

123
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,107
into that most
unpredictable region

124
00:04:51,142 --> 00:04:54,227
that we refer to
as the twilight zone.

125
00:04:57,697 --> 00:05:00,199
This man don't know the
first thing about baseball.

126
00:05:03,354 --> 00:05:05,204
If anybody
can tell me

127
00:05:05,239 --> 00:05:06,456
the phillies
deserved

128
00:05:06,491 --> 00:05:08,958
winning the pennant that year

129
00:05:08,993 --> 00:05:10,827
they're out
of their minds.

130
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:13,963
You sure
we're invisible?

131
00:05:13,998 --> 00:05:15,214
Beyond any doubt.

132
00:05:15,249 --> 00:05:16,466
I wish they were.

133
00:05:16,501 --> 00:05:18,217
You don't have
to do that.

134
00:05:19,754 --> 00:05:21,587
You don't even
have to answer.

135
00:05:21,622 --> 00:05:24,090
Just because he don't like the phillies...

136
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:25,341
let me tell him.

137
00:05:25,376 --> 00:05:28,478
You have a brain of
your own, don't you?

138
00:05:28,513 --> 00:05:30,346
You have your
own viewpoint.

139
00:05:30,381 --> 00:05:33,483
What did you think of
the phillies of 1953?

140
00:05:33,518 --> 00:05:34,734
Phillies... 1953?

141
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:35,985
That's right.

142
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,854
That's right,
phillies of 1953.

143
00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:40,606
You ever see such jerky-looking creatures?

144
00:05:40,641 --> 00:05:41,858
And one head yet.

145
00:05:41,893 --> 00:05:43,109
Typical earthmen.

146
00:05:43,144 --> 00:05:44,994
Not really though.
The one in the middle,

147
00:05:45,029 --> 00:05:46,863
the one who just suffered
the physical damage

148
00:05:47,497 --> 00:05:49,365
he may be the one
we've been looking for.

149
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,616
How do you mean?

150
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:52,502
Silence,
i'm receiving his waves.

151
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:55,004
Name is dingle, abject coward

152
00:05:55,039 --> 00:06:00,009
does not even possess what earth
creatures call minimum muscles.

153
00:06:00,044 --> 00:06:01,878
Decidedly a sub-physical type.

154
00:06:02,378 --> 00:06:04,263
I think we have
found our subject.

155
00:06:04,298 --> 00:06:06,766
You intend to give him
the additional strength?

156
00:06:06,801 --> 00:06:09,268
We haven't found
anyone weaker, have we?

157
00:06:09,303 --> 00:06:12,388
I believe he will be
an exceptional subject.

158
00:06:12,423 --> 00:06:14,891
Give him around 11 secograms atomic weight.

159
00:06:14,926 --> 00:06:18,027
That should make him
roughly 300 times stronger

160
00:06:18,062 --> 00:06:19,896
than the average
human being.

161
00:06:19,931 --> 00:06:21,781
Yes, i think
that will do it.

162
00:06:21,898 --> 00:06:24,400
We had better contact central laboratories

163
00:06:24,435 --> 00:06:26,903
tell them we have
found a subject.

164
00:06:26,938 --> 00:06:29,155
In other words,
you're telling me

165
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:32,291
that you thought robin
roberts had more stuff

166
00:06:32,326 --> 00:06:32,909
than clem levine?

167
00:06:33,543 --> 00:06:35,411
Well, to be frank and candid

168
00:06:35,446 --> 00:06:38,548
those two men,
as good as they both are

169
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,416
and all things
being equal...

170
00:06:40,451 --> 00:06:42,919
come on already,
take your pick.

171
00:06:42,954 --> 00:06:44,804
Roberts?

172
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:49,175
For the last time.

173
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:51,060
You start one more
roughhouse in here

174
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:53,563
and i won't let
you come back.

175
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:55,431
Now, look what
you've done.

176
00:06:55,466 --> 00:06:58,684
How you feeling,
dingle?

177
00:06:58,719 --> 00:07:01,187
C-c-clem l-l-l-levine
was definitely superior.

178
00:07:01,222 --> 00:07:03,072
You see?
All i made him do

179
00:07:03,107 --> 00:07:04,323
was see things
clearer.

180
00:07:04,358 --> 00:07:06,075
I can observe him now.

181
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:07,944
Let him have it.

182
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:22,208
How about it, dingle?

183
00:07:22,243 --> 00:07:24,093
How you doing?

184
00:07:24,128 --> 00:07:26,596
Definitely clem levine.

185
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:29,715
Dingle, would
you mind

186
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,601
a little advice?

187
00:07:31,636 --> 00:07:34,103
Now, the whole world
is full of guys

188
00:07:34,138 --> 00:07:36,606
that are going to get
punched in the nose

189
00:07:36,641 --> 00:07:39,108
no matter who they
pick in a ball game

190
00:07:39,143 --> 00:07:41,227
who they
vote for.

191
00:07:41,262 --> 00:07:43,729
Now, you want
to know my advice

192
00:07:43,764 --> 00:07:44,981
for what you should do

193
00:07:45,016 --> 00:07:46,866
for the rest
of your life?

194
00:07:46,901 --> 00:07:48,734
Just don't talk,
just nod.

195
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:51,237
Somebody asks you who
you like in the third

196
00:07:51,272 --> 00:07:52,488
you just smile.

197
00:07:52,523 --> 00:07:54,624
Understand, dingle?

198
00:07:57,627 --> 00:07:59,495
What's the matter?

199
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:01,380
It's very odd.

200
00:08:01,415 --> 00:08:02,632
What's odd?

201
00:08:02,667 --> 00:08:05,751
I... i feel f-f-funny.

202
00:08:05,786 --> 00:08:07,003
Funny?

203
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:08,254
Yeah.

204
00:08:15,011 --> 00:08:16,262
Wonder what
caused that?

205
00:08:16,297 --> 00:08:17,513
Caused what?

206
00:08:18,014 --> 00:08:20,516
Well, this vacuum
cleaner, it's...

207
00:08:20,551 --> 00:08:21,767
light as a feather.

208
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:23,653
Not that the machine
isn't right.

209
00:08:23,688 --> 00:08:26,772
No, sir, it's the lightest on the market.

210
00:08:26,807 --> 00:08:27,657
Yes, sir,
i tell you

211
00:08:27,692 --> 00:08:30,776
it's a handy-dandy
piece of merchandise.

212
00:08:31,027 --> 00:08:33,529
Guaranteed to lighten the load
and lengthen the life

213
00:08:34,163 --> 00:08:36,666
of that partner in the home,
th-th-the housewife.

214
00:08:36,701 --> 00:08:41,671
But i didn't know
it was this light.

215
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:54,934
Dingle, i always
figured you

216
00:08:54,969 --> 00:08:56,185
for a nice guy.

217
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,187
You never caused me no trouble.

218
00:08:58,222 --> 00:09:00,056
Now why all of a sudden
you got to wreck my front door?

219
00:09:00,091 --> 00:09:02,558
Mr. O'toole,
i'm mystified.

220
00:09:02,593 --> 00:09:04,443
I'm absolutely
mystified.

221
00:09:04,478 --> 00:09:08,197
This door seemed to come
right off in my hand.

222
00:09:21,711 --> 00:09:23,579
You here again?

223
00:09:23,614 --> 00:09:24,830
Didn't my old man say

224
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:26,832
he was gonna punch you
in the nose

225
00:09:26,867 --> 00:09:28,718
if you came around here
bothering us again?

226
00:09:28,753 --> 00:09:30,970
You're quite right.

227
00:09:31,005 --> 00:09:32,221
It's the wrong number.

228
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:34,090
I was headed
across the street.

229
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:41,731
Now that's not the best
of all possible manners, is it?

230
00:09:41,766 --> 00:09:45,101
Aw, go peddle your vacuum
cleaners, you creep

231
00:09:45,136 --> 00:09:47,603
and throw me
my ball back.

232
00:09:49,605 --> 00:09:51,607
All right, run out for the pass.

233
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:06,622
Hey, mister, where'd you learn
to fling a ball like that?

234
00:10:06,657 --> 00:10:08,507
Why, i don't know.
I really don't...

235
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:09,759
what is happening?

236
00:10:09,794 --> 00:10:11,010
What on earth is
happening to me?

237
00:10:11,045 --> 00:10:13,512
Taxi, taxi, please.
Thank you.

238
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:23,639
Oh, believe me, this is as much
a mystery to me as it is to you.

239
00:10:23,674 --> 00:10:26,776
They don't make handles like
they used to, do they?

240
00:10:27,643 --> 00:10:29,528
Oh, i'm sorr...

241
00:10:54,705 --> 00:10:57,173
excuse me, miss.

242
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:58,424
Yes.

243
00:10:58,459 --> 00:11:01,560
I don't want you to
think i'm a masher.

244
00:11:01,595 --> 00:11:03,429
I'm certainly
not a masher.

245
00:11:03,464 --> 00:11:07,817
But would you mind
answering a question?

246
00:11:07,852 --> 00:11:09,685
That depends.

247
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,938
Well, what i mean
is looking at me

248
00:11:12,973 --> 00:11:16,692
in a perfunctory,
cursory first surveil

249
00:11:16,727 --> 00:11:19,829
do i appear abnormal
in any way?

250
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,948
Not at all.

251
00:11:22,983 --> 00:11:25,584
Not unless you plan
to use that in the park.

252
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:26,836
Oh, that.

253
00:11:26,871 --> 00:11:29,955
Do you know that up
until a few hours ago

254
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:31,841
i sold those.

255
00:11:31,876 --> 00:11:34,093
Or i went through
the motions.

256
00:11:34,128 --> 00:11:35,961
I was a very
bad salesman.

257
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:37,213
Miserable.

258
00:11:37,248 --> 00:11:39,098
You know, last week

259
00:11:39,133 --> 00:11:41,600
i only made 89 cents
in commissions.

260
00:11:41,635 --> 00:11:44,603
That was for
an attachment.

261
00:11:44,638 --> 00:11:47,723
It's the
upholstery nozzle.

262
00:11:47,758 --> 00:11:50,226
And i sold it to a drunk

263
00:11:50,261 --> 00:11:53,362
who thought it was
a divining rod for alcohol.

264
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:57,116
Oh, i fully expect
to be fired

265
00:11:57,151 --> 00:11:59,618
but that is the least of my trouble.

266
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:03,873
Would you be interested

267
00:12:03,908 --> 00:12:05,741
in hearing the most
of my worries?

268
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:06,992
Go ahead.

269
00:12:07,027 --> 00:12:08,878
Watch.

270
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,269
You see?

271
00:12:33,304 --> 00:12:35,771
Now, w-w-watch this.

272
00:12:44,914 --> 00:12:47,166
Hey, buddy, i'm a reporter
with thebulletin.

273
00:12:47,201 --> 00:12:48,417
Would you mind doing that again?

274
00:12:48,452 --> 00:12:49,668
With the rock?

275
00:12:49,703 --> 00:12:50,920
That's right.

276
00:12:50,955 --> 00:12:52,788
Incidentally,
what's the gag?

277
00:12:52,823 --> 00:12:54,673
There's no gag, see?

278
00:12:55,925 --> 00:12:57,793
Get another
one of those.

279
00:12:57,828 --> 00:12:59,678
This i got to get
in the paper.

280
00:13:05,301 --> 00:13:07,803
Goodness.

281
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:08,057
Mr. Dingle, if what
we hear is true

282
00:15:08,092 --> 00:15:10,559
do you realize how much money can be made

283
00:15:10,594 --> 00:15:12,428
on a tour with
our carnival?

284
00:15:12,463 --> 00:15:14,313
Mr. Dingle, this
is a con artist.

285
00:15:14,348 --> 00:15:16,181
Your future lies
in television.

286
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:18,067
You're the walking,
talking embodiment

287
00:15:18,102 --> 00:15:20,569
of every american male's
wish fulfillment.

288
00:15:20,604 --> 00:15:22,438
You're john q. Citizen.

289
00:15:22,473 --> 00:15:23,689
You're babbitt,
you're tom, dick and harry.

290
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:26,191
Now here's our idea
for the series.

291
00:15:26,226 --> 00:15:28,694
A simple 15-minute
address by you

292
00:15:28,729 --> 00:15:31,196
with little examples of
your physical prowess.

293
00:15:31,231 --> 00:15:33,699
It's a natural for
breakfast cereals

294
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,201
tonics, vitamin
pills, anything.

295
00:15:36,236 --> 00:15:37,453
And i keep
telling you

296
00:15:37,488 --> 00:15:38,704
you line up
with me

297
00:15:38,739 --> 00:15:40,589
i'll get you some easy setups.

298
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:42,458
Inside of
eight months

299
00:15:42,493 --> 00:15:43,709
i'll have
you fighting

300
00:15:43,744 --> 00:15:45,594
for the world
championship.

301
00:15:45,629 --> 00:15:47,463
That's so
ridiculous.

302
00:15:47,498 --> 00:15:50,599
Would the people
surrounding mr. Dingle

303
00:15:50,634 --> 00:15:53,102
just get out of
the way, please.

304
00:15:53,137 --> 00:15:54,353
Out of the way.

305
00:15:54,388 --> 00:15:58,107
The camera in there and
that light there and...

306
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,483
hello, there, friends.

307
00:16:07,518 --> 00:16:13,739
Jason abernathy here with your
show, tv probes the unusual.

308
00:16:13,774 --> 00:16:19,995
And our unusual subject today
is mr. Luther dingle

309
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:23,749
who, if what actual
onlookers say is true

310
00:16:23,784 --> 00:16:26,885
is the world's strongest man.

311
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,137
Mr. Dingle...

312
00:16:28,172 --> 00:16:31,256
mr. Dingle, would you care
to give us an example

313
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:34,393
of this fantastic alleged
strength of yours?

314
00:16:34,428 --> 00:16:37,513
I'd be ha-happy to.

315
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:41,266
Is it all right,
mr. O'toole if i...

316
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:42,267
are you kidding?

317
00:16:42,302 --> 00:16:44,153
I ain't done so much business

318
00:16:44,188 --> 00:16:46,655
since the night they repealed
the 18th amendment.

319
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:49,908
Be my guest,
mr. Dingle.

320
00:16:53,028 --> 00:16:58,667
First, i'd like to start
with simple things.

321
00:17:13,048 --> 00:17:15,551
Wonderful.

322
00:18:02,598 --> 00:18:04,483
Wait a minute, dingle.

323
00:18:04,518 --> 00:18:08,854
Ain't you ever heard of
bygones being bygones?

324
00:18:17,246 --> 00:18:19,114
That's amazing.

325
00:18:25,754 --> 00:18:28,006
Bravo!

326
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,760
Had enough?

327
00:18:31,795 --> 00:18:33,629
Most inferior.

328
00:18:33,664 --> 00:18:36,131
We give him the
strength of 300 men

329
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:38,634
and he uses it
for petty exhibition.

330
00:18:38,669 --> 00:18:40,519
Give him 20 or
30 seconds more

331
00:18:40,554 --> 00:18:42,387
then remove the power.

332
00:18:42,422 --> 00:18:43,639
Excellent idea.

333
00:18:43,674 --> 00:18:45,524
And i think
we should be off.

334
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:48,026
Three planets on
tomorrow's itinerary.

335
00:18:48,061 --> 00:18:50,529
One should be particularly interesting-

336
00:18:50,564 --> 00:18:52,397
contains only females.

337
00:18:54,149 --> 00:18:55,400
And now, ladies...

338
00:18:55,435 --> 00:18:57,286
and now, ladies and gentlemen

339
00:18:57,321 --> 00:18:59,788
i believe the most
unique trick of all

340
00:18:59,823 --> 00:19:03,542
i shall raise this entire
building with my bare hands.

341
00:19:03,577 --> 00:19:06,044
What? Raise
the building?

342
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:07,296
He can't
do that.

343
00:19:07,331 --> 00:19:09,164
I don't
believe it.

344
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:25,814
I don't know.

345
00:19:25,849 --> 00:19:28,317
He seems to
have lost it.

346
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,337
He's a fake, that's what he is.

347
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:59,598
I feel sorry for him.

348
00:19:59,633 --> 00:20:00,849
Poor little guy

349
00:20:00,884 --> 00:20:02,718
he's lost
his belief.

350
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:17,733
He's a sad little man,
isn't he?

351
00:20:17,768 --> 00:20:20,235
Uh-oh!
Uh-oh!

352
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:29,494
All right, leave off
of poor dingle here.

353
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:31,997
Now, come on,
everybody out of here.

354
00:20:32,032 --> 00:20:33,248
Come on, beat it.

355
00:20:33,283 --> 00:20:34,499
Ladies and gentlemen

356
00:20:34,534 --> 00:20:37,002
you have this station's
abject apology.

357
00:20:37,037 --> 00:20:40,138
We didn't realize that it
was a trick... obviously...

358
00:20:40,173 --> 00:20:42,641
well, we're
off the air...

359
00:20:42,676 --> 00:20:44,509
for good, i think.

360
00:20:44,544 --> 00:20:47,646
So long, hercules.

361
00:20:48,263 --> 00:20:49,514
Bring that thing
out of here.

362
00:21:01,695 --> 00:21:03,528
How are you, fellas?

363
00:21:03,563 --> 00:21:04,162
Nice seeing you.

364
00:21:04,197 --> 00:21:05,414
Where are
you from?

365
00:21:05,449 --> 00:21:07,282
Venus. How about you?

366
00:21:07,317 --> 00:21:08,917
Mars. Conducting
experiments?

367
00:21:08,952 --> 00:21:10,168
Yeah,
and you?

368
00:21:10,203 --> 00:21:11,420
Sudden introduction
of strength

369
00:21:11,455 --> 00:21:13,288
to subnormal earthman.

370
00:21:13,323 --> 00:21:14,539
How about you?

371
00:21:14,574 --> 00:21:17,426
Sudden introduction of
extreme intelligence.

372
00:21:17,461 --> 00:21:19,294
Find any interesting
subjects?

373
00:21:19,329 --> 00:21:20,929
That one over there.

374
00:21:20,964 --> 00:21:22,547
He's referred to
as a dingle.

375
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,551
He certainly is
sub-physical.

376
00:21:26,586 --> 00:21:29,688
I wouldn't be surprised
if he's sub-mental, too.

377
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:42,067
Looks likely enough.

378
00:21:42,102 --> 00:21:45,203
Give him the intelligence quota ray.

379
00:21:45,238 --> 00:21:46,455
How strong?

380
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:48,323
Make it about...

381
00:21:48,358 --> 00:21:49,574
let's see.

382
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:52,077
Perhaps 500 times
more intelligent

383
00:21:52,112 --> 00:21:53,962
than the
average human.

384
00:22:15,851 --> 00:22:17,486
Roebuck's ready.

385
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:19,988
Here's the pitch.

386
00:22:20,023 --> 00:22:21,239
High and outside.

387
00:22:21,274 --> 00:22:23,742
He couldn't hit the
length of the bat.

388
00:22:23,777 --> 00:22:25,610
I'll lay you five
to one he gets on.

389
00:22:25,645 --> 00:22:27,496
Logan? Are you
out of your mind?

390
00:22:27,531 --> 00:22:28,747
Hey, hey, dingle.

391
00:22:28,782 --> 00:22:29,748
What about it?

392
00:22:29,783 --> 00:22:30,999
What will he do?

393
00:22:31,034 --> 00:22:33,502
Various factors are
brought into play here

394
00:22:33,537 --> 00:22:36,004
involving the laws
of probability

395
00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:38,507
interspersed with
the process of calculus

396
00:22:38,542 --> 00:22:41,626
fenaglian laws of chance
and the subdivisional grepple

397
00:22:41,661 --> 00:22:44,129
which is based on
the position of bodies

398
00:22:44,164 --> 00:22:46,631
in mathematical relationship
to other bodies.

399
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:49,768
Now, in this case,
using the two factors

400
00:22:49,803 --> 00:22:52,888
represented by the
divisions involved

401
00:22:52,923 --> 00:22:55,390
i think that the batter will
unquestionably hit a home run.

402
00:22:55,425 --> 00:22:58,527
A home run by johnny logan.

403
00:22:58,562 --> 00:22:59,778
Holy mackerel!

404
00:22:59,813 --> 00:23:01,029
How about that?

405
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,149
Light.

406
00:23:04,184 --> 00:23:05,400
...two to one.

407
00:23:05,435 --> 00:23:08,537
A tremendous blow over
the left-field fence.

408
00:23:08,572 --> 00:23:11,039
Now, it appears to
me it is apparent

409
00:23:11,074 --> 00:23:12,290
in a
mathematical plan

410
00:23:12,325 --> 00:23:14,159
that the entire
quantum theory

411
00:23:14,194 --> 00:23:16,044
of space and
time relativity

412
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:19,164
must have been equated
with the parellelian role

413
00:23:19,199 --> 00:23:21,666
of definitive numerical
dialectic algebraic

414
00:23:21,701 --> 00:23:23,552
and must be
further annotated...

415
00:23:23,587 --> 00:23:26,671
exit mr. Luther dingle,
formerly vacuum cleaner salesman

416
00:23:26,706 --> 00:23:29,174
strongest man on earth,
and now mental giant.

417
00:23:29,209 --> 00:23:32,928
These latter powers will likely
be eliminated before too long

418
00:23:32,963 --> 00:23:34,813
but mr. Dingle has an appeal

419
00:23:34,848 --> 00:23:36,681
to extra-terrestrial note-takers

420
00:23:36,716 --> 00:23:39,818
as well as to frustrated
and insolvent bet-losers.

421
00:23:39,853 --> 00:23:41,069
Offhand, i'd say

422
00:23:41,104 --> 00:23:44,189
he was in for a great deal
of extremely odd periods

423
00:23:44,224 --> 00:23:46,691
simply because there are
so many inhabited planets

424
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:48,577
who send down observers

425
00:23:48,612 --> 00:23:51,696
and also because of course
mr. Dingle lives his life

426
00:23:51,731 --> 00:23:55,450
with one foot in his mouth and
the other in the twilight zone.

427
00:24:01,923 --> 00:24:05,043
Rod serling, the creator
ofthe twilight zone

428
00:24:05,078 --> 00:24:06,928
will tell you
about next week's story

429
00:24:06,963 --> 00:24:09,414
after this word
from our alternate sponsor.

430
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:12,017
And now, mr. Serling.

431
00:24:14,469 --> 00:24:16,972
A radio.

432
00:24:17,007 --> 00:24:18,857
A carryover from that other era

433
00:24:18,892 --> 00:24:20,725
when quiz shows
went up to only $64

434
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,228
and entertainment was aimed
only at the ears.

435
00:24:23,263 --> 00:24:25,113
Mr. Charles beaumont
has given us

436
00:24:25,148 --> 00:24:26,982
a most unusual story
called "static."

437
00:24:27,017 --> 00:24:28,867
We invite you to watch
mr. Dean jagger

438
00:24:28,902 --> 00:24:31,987
fiddle with a few of these
knobs, change a few stations

439
00:24:32,022 --> 00:24:33,238
and find a couple of programs

440
00:24:33,273 --> 00:24:35,740
that are broadcast
only in the twilight zone.

441

00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:22,537
see the newandy griffith show
each week

443
00:25:22,572 --> 00:25:24,422
over most of these stations.
