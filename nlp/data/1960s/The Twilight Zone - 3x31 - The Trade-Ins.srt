1
00:00:09,876 --> 00:00:12,379
You're traveling
through another dimension-

2
00:00:12,414 --> 00:00:16,132
a dimension not only of sight
and sound, but of mind,

3
00:00:16,167 --> 00:00:18,018
a journey into a wondrous land

4
00:00:18,053 --> 00:00:20,520
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

5
00:00:20,555 --> 00:00:23,023
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

6
00:00:41,826 --> 00:00:44,294
"Well," i says
to jack pershing,

7
00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:46,162
"general, we ain't
going to get

8
00:00:46,197 --> 00:00:47,414
"no artillery
support.

9
00:00:47,449 --> 00:00:49,299
"They're dug in too deep.

10
00:00:49,334 --> 00:00:51,801
"Well, we're going to
have to enfilade 'em.

11
00:00:51,836 --> 00:00:54,304
"That's what
we're going
to have to do.

12
00:00:54,339 --> 00:00:56,172
"We'll have to
enfilade 'em

13
00:00:56,207 --> 00:00:57,424
to beat the band."

14
00:00:59,961 --> 00:01:01,811
Frisby, when are
you going to burn

15
00:01:01,846 --> 00:01:03,063
that mouth organ

16
00:01:03,098 --> 00:01:04,931
or at least learn
how to play it?

17
00:01:04,966 --> 00:01:06,816
Well, it
relaxes me.

18
00:01:06,851 --> 00:01:08,068
Well,
"old black jack"

19
00:01:08,103 --> 00:01:10,570
knew who he was
dealing with.

20
00:01:10,605 --> 00:01:11,821
He didn't call me

21
00:01:11,856 --> 00:01:14,324
"old enfiladin'
frisby" for nothing.

22
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:15,575
Horseradish.

23
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:18,078
Where do you keep
the horseradish,
frisby?

24
00:01:18,113 --> 00:01:20,580
Top shelf.

25
00:01:20,615 --> 00:01:21,831
And ketchup?

26
00:01:21,866 --> 00:01:24,334
Right in back of
the cash register.

27
00:01:24,369 --> 00:01:25,585
Well, the
next morning,

28
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,088
we attacked up
and down the line,

29
00:01:28,123 --> 00:01:29,956
and the rest is history.

30
00:01:29,991 --> 00:01:31,207
Smashed them to bits.

31
00:01:31,242 --> 00:01:33,093
Four and a half
hours later,

32
00:01:33,128 --> 00:01:36,212
we were in paris,
and an hour later,

33
00:01:36,247 --> 00:01:37,464
we're
in berlin.

34
00:01:37,499 --> 00:01:38,715
Oh...

35
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,851
be my guest.

36
00:01:41,886 --> 00:01:43,353
Frisby, you're
the biggest liar

37
00:01:43,388 --> 00:01:45,221
that ever set by a stove.

38
00:01:45,256 --> 00:01:47,107
You doubting
my word?

39
00:01:47,142 --> 00:01:48,358
You can start with that.

40
00:01:48,393 --> 00:01:50,226
I'm not just
doubting your word.

41
00:01:50,261 --> 00:01:51,478
I'm calling
you a liar.

42
00:01:51,513 --> 00:01:52,729
How can you get

43
00:01:52,764 --> 00:01:54,614
from paris to berlin
in one hour?

44
00:01:54,649 --> 00:01:55,865
Find the celery, pete?

45
00:01:56,901 --> 00:01:58,118
Yep.

46
00:01:58,153 --> 00:01:59,369
How about turnips?

47
00:01:59,404 --> 00:02:00,620
Oh, all out.

48
00:02:00,655 --> 00:02:01,738
Get some
in the morning.

49
00:02:01,773 --> 00:02:02,989
We're waiting, frisby.

50
00:02:03,024 --> 00:02:05,492
How do you go
from paris to berlin

51
00:02:05,527 --> 00:02:06,743
in one hour?

52
00:02:06,778 --> 00:02:09,879
Well, now, that's what made
the operation so fantastic.

53
00:02:09,914 --> 00:02:11,748
See, i was doing
a little reconortin'

54
00:02:11,783 --> 00:02:13,633
and found a back route.

55
00:02:13,668 --> 00:02:14,884
Well, that's very
interesting, frisby,

56
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:16,136
except last week,

57
00:02:16,171 --> 00:02:17,387
you sat right in
that dang chair

58
00:02:17,422 --> 00:02:19,255
and told us you was
in the balloon corps.

59
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,141
Over the battle
of the marne,

60
00:02:21,176 --> 00:02:21,758
you shot down three

61
00:02:21,793 --> 00:02:23,009
german fokkers
with a pistol

62
00:02:23,044 --> 00:02:24,894
and directed
the artillery

63
00:02:24,929 --> 00:02:26,146
so the marines
could win.

64
00:02:26,181 --> 00:02:28,014
Well, i did, indeed.

65
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,020
But that was
a year later.

66
00:02:34,055 --> 00:02:37,774
Let's see, that was...

67
00:02:37,809 --> 00:02:40,910
april 1917.

68
00:02:40,945 --> 00:02:42,779
Well, looks like rain.

69
00:02:42,814 --> 00:02:44,664
Tell by the clouds.

70
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:47,167
Always tell by the clouds.

71
00:02:47,202 --> 00:02:49,035
Now, that big
job up there

72
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:51,538
that is astrata
cumulus opacus.

73
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,794
You fellows know
anything about
meterology?

74
00:02:57,829 --> 00:02:59,679
Here we go again.

75
00:02:59,714 --> 00:03:02,182
I can't say
we do, frisby.

76
00:03:02,217 --> 00:03:04,050
Well, i can say
that i do.

77
00:03:04,085 --> 00:03:06,553
Majored in it at the
university of wichita.

78
00:03:06,588 --> 00:03:07,804
Got my doctorate.

79
00:03:07,839 --> 00:03:10,306
Wrote a thesee
at the age of 13

80
00:03:10,341 --> 00:03:12,192
that's still used
as standard text.

81
00:03:12,227 --> 00:03:14,694
Meterology and you
it's called.

82
00:03:14,729 --> 00:03:15,945
Folks that know say

83
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,814
it's the most
scholarly treatment

84
00:03:17,849 --> 00:03:20,950
of the subject in the
history of the field.

85
00:03:20,985 --> 00:03:23,453
"Old cumulus frisby"
they called me.

86
00:03:25,356 --> 00:03:28,458
"Cumulus frisby."

87
00:03:28,493 --> 00:03:30,326
This guy's
a meteorologist,

88
00:03:30,361 --> 00:03:32,212
i'm vice-president
johnson.

89
00:03:32,247 --> 00:03:33,830
What did you say, lyndon?

90
00:03:33,865 --> 00:03:36,332
All finished,
frisby.

91
00:03:36,367 --> 00:03:37,584
Want to add it up?

92
00:03:37,619 --> 00:03:40,720
No, you go ahead and
do it for me, pete.

93
00:03:40,755 --> 00:03:43,223
Pencil and paper right
there on the counter.

94
00:03:43,258 --> 00:03:46,976
Do it by hand, only i had
a kind of a busy day,

95
00:03:47,011 --> 00:03:48,845
and i'm all pooped.

96
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,981
Say, did i ever tell
you fellas about the time

97
00:03:52,016 --> 00:03:55,735
i gave a demonstration
with the computer machines?

98
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:58,238
18 of them lined up
in an auditorium.

99
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:03,493
Columns of figures,
eight digits apiece.

100
00:04:03,528 --> 00:04:05,862
Now, no pencils or
no paper, mind you-

101
00:04:05,897 --> 00:04:07,614
all in the head.

102
00:04:07,649 --> 00:04:10,750
Why, folks just came
from miles around.

103
00:04:10,785 --> 00:04:11,618
What happened?

104
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,620
I didn't think
anybody'd ever ask.

105
00:04:13,655 --> 00:04:14,871
Well,

106
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:18,124
four of 'em broke down
from overwork, two of 'em

107
00:04:18,159 --> 00:04:20,627
came up
with the incorrect answer,

108
00:04:20,662 --> 00:04:24,264
and i beat them all
by 21 seconds.

109
00:04:24,299 --> 00:04:26,766
"Old archimedes frisby"
they called me.

110
00:04:27,383 --> 00:04:29,269
Well, now that does it!

111
00:04:29,304 --> 00:04:31,137
I mean, i just
can't take anymore, frisby.

112
00:04:31,172 --> 00:04:33,022
I mean, i wouldn't mind
if you was a bright liar-

113
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,525
i mean, you know,
if there was some logic to it-

114
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,393
but, well, daggone,
the way you tell it,

115
00:04:37,428 --> 00:04:39,279
you'd have to be
100 different people

116
00:04:39,314 --> 00:04:40,530
living in 200 places

117
00:04:40,565 --> 00:04:41,781
during 12 periods
of american history.

118
00:04:41,816 --> 00:04:43,650
Hallelujah
and amen.

119
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:46,786
Well, now,
who can that be?

120
00:04:48,072 --> 00:04:49,906
Customers most likely.

121
00:04:49,941 --> 00:04:52,408
You just said a nasty word.

122
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:55,044
You know the only
industrious thing

123
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:58,164
about frisby's whole body
is his mouth.

124
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:02,552
Easy, easy,
i'm coming.

125
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:07,557
The reluctant gentleman with the
sizeable mouth is mr. Frisby.

126
00:05:07,592 --> 00:05:10,059
He has all the drive
of a broken camshaft

127
00:05:10,094 --> 00:05:11,928
and the aggressive vinegar
of a corpse.

128
00:05:11,963 --> 00:05:13,813
As you've no doubt gathered,

129
00:05:13,848 --> 00:05:15,682
his big stock-in-trade
is the tall tale.

130
00:05:15,717 --> 00:05:19,435
Now, what he doesn't know
is that the visitors out front

131
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:21,938
are a very special breed,
destined to change his life

132
00:05:21,973 --> 00:05:25,692
beyond anything even his fertile
imagination could manufacture.

133
00:05:25,727 --> 00:05:28,828
The place is pitchville flats,
the time is the present.

134
00:05:28,863 --> 00:05:32,582
But mr. Frisby's on the first
leg of a rather fanciful journey

135
00:05:32,617 --> 00:05:35,084
into the place we call
the twilight zone.

136
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,553
Do you want gas, or something?

137
00:05:53,588 --> 00:05:54,804
That's the idea.

138
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:57,306
Why didn't you
pour it yourself?

139
00:05:57,341 --> 00:05:59,192
Well, as a
matter of fact,

140
00:05:59,227 --> 00:06:00,443
we're not
too accustomed

141
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:02,311
to these rear
engine jobs.

142
00:06:02,346 --> 00:06:04,197
Oh, you're
not, huh?

143
00:06:04,232 --> 00:06:06,065
Well...

144
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,568
i am.

145
00:06:08,603 --> 00:06:10,069
Matter of fact...

146
00:06:11,821 --> 00:06:13,706
i'm responsible
for her.

147
00:06:13,741 --> 00:06:16,209
You developed
them, did you?

148
00:06:16,244 --> 00:06:17,460
Oh, indeed i did.

149
00:06:17,495 --> 00:06:19,962
Got a phone call one
time from henry ford

150
00:06:19,997 --> 00:06:22,465
asking me to fly
out to detroit.

151
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,585
And i did, and
48 hours later,

152
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,836
i had developed

153
00:06:26,871 --> 00:06:30,590
the first rear
engine automobile.

154
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:34,343
Mister, you're looking
at the granddaddy

155
00:06:34,378 --> 00:06:36,846
of the american
automobile.

156
00:06:36,881 --> 00:06:39,849
Right after i finished
that designing job,

157
00:06:39,884 --> 00:06:42,351
henry ford said to me,
"rear engine"-

158
00:06:42,386 --> 00:06:45,488
what he always called me,
"old rear engine frisby"-

159
00:06:45,523 --> 00:06:47,106
"rear engine,"
he says,

160
00:06:47,141 --> 00:06:49,609
"you are an
automotive genius."

161
00:06:49,644 --> 00:06:51,994
And i couldn't very well
argue with him

162
00:06:52,029 --> 00:06:54,497
on account of
he was telling the truth.

163
00:06:54,532 --> 00:06:55,748
Do you want it filled up?

164
00:06:55,783 --> 00:06:56,866
If you don't mind.

165
00:06:56,901 --> 00:06:58,117
Not at all.

166
00:06:59,403 --> 00:07:01,871
Not at all.

167
00:07:06,876 --> 00:07:08,761
Right under there.

168
00:07:08,796 --> 00:07:10,630
I know, i know.

169
00:07:10,665 --> 00:07:12,515
I put it
under there.

170
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:16,886
This is the man.

171
00:07:16,921 --> 00:07:18,771
Frisby.

172
00:07:18,806 --> 00:07:20,640
Is that his name?

173
00:07:20,675 --> 00:07:22,525
Frisby, an incredible
specimen-

174
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,027
done everything,
knows everything,

175
00:07:25,062 --> 00:07:28,781
studied in most of their
major universities.

176
00:07:28,816 --> 00:07:31,901
Holds a doctorate in
at least eight fields.

177
00:07:31,936 --> 00:07:33,152
Obviously a key man.

178
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,039
Water and oil okay?

179
00:07:37,074 --> 00:07:39,408
I believe they are,
but you might check them.

180
00:07:39,443 --> 00:07:42,161
Might just as well
while i'm here.

181
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:54,674
Well, that will be $1.80.

182
00:07:57,927 --> 00:07:59,178
Ten bucks.

183
00:07:59,213 --> 00:08:00,429
Is that what it is?

184
00:08:00,464 --> 00:08:02,315
Oh, yes, ten dollars.

185
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:04,567
You folks from around here?

186
00:08:04,602 --> 00:08:07,937
No, we're from
quite a ways off.

187
00:08:07,972 --> 00:08:08,821
Oh.

188
00:08:08,856 --> 00:08:11,190
Well, if you're going
to drive a spell,

189
00:08:11,225 --> 00:08:13,693
why, you better
check in some place

190
00:08:13,728 --> 00:08:15,578
fore you get started,

191
00:08:15,613 --> 00:08:19,332
'cause those are
mean-looking old clouds.

192
00:08:19,367 --> 00:08:21,834
Looks like it'll
rain shortly.

193
00:08:21,869 --> 00:08:23,703
Can you tell when
it's going to rain?

194
00:08:23,738 --> 00:08:25,588
Tell? Rain?

195
00:08:25,623 --> 00:08:27,456
Mister, i can tell

196
00:08:27,491 --> 00:08:29,342
when the
humidity drops

197
00:08:29,377 --> 00:08:31,844
one half of
one percent.

198
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:33,713
Why, i can
predict fog, smog,

199
00:08:33,748 --> 00:08:35,598
rain, hail,
sleet and snow

200
00:08:35,633 --> 00:08:39,101
24 hours before
it happens.

201
00:08:39,136 --> 00:08:40,970
Mr. Frisby,
we were wondering...

202
00:08:41,005 --> 00:08:42,221
uh, we'll very likely

203
00:08:42,256 --> 00:08:44,106
be seeing you soon,
mr. Frisby.

204
00:08:44,141 --> 00:08:45,358
Well,
i hope you do.

205
00:08:45,393 --> 00:08:46,859
And remember what
i told you

206
00:08:46,894 --> 00:08:48,110
about the weather.

207
00:08:48,145 --> 00:08:51,230
You better check into
a motel or something

208
00:08:51,265 --> 00:08:52,481
until it blows over.

209
00:08:52,516 --> 00:08:54,984
We'll probably
do that.

210
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:58,120
Thank you again,
mr. Frisby.

211
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,885
Well, odd fella.

212
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,388
Why, they believe
what you was saying?

213
00:09:15,423 --> 00:09:17,890
No, just kind of odd.

214
00:09:17,925 --> 00:09:19,759
Handed me a ten dollar bill

215
00:09:19,794 --> 00:09:22,261
like they didn't even know
what it was.

216
00:09:22,296 --> 00:09:23,512
Well, how come
you didn't tell 'em

217
00:09:23,547 --> 00:09:26,015
you was alexander hamilton,
and that's your picture on it?

218
00:09:27,301 --> 00:09:29,151
That's one of
the few things

219
00:09:29,186 --> 00:09:30,403
i ain't heard
him claim.

220
00:09:30,438 --> 00:09:32,271
I'll see you
tomorrow, frisby.

221
00:09:32,306 --> 00:09:33,522
Yeah.

222
00:09:34,809 --> 00:09:36,025
I'll see you tomorrow, frisby.

223
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,276
Okay, pete.

224
00:09:39,814 --> 00:09:41,664
Well... 5:00.

225
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,418
That seems like a...

226
00:09:45,453 --> 00:09:47,920
reasonable hour to close up.

227
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,306
Mr. Frisby?

228
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:11,060
Frisby here.

229
00:10:11,095 --> 00:10:13,062
Mr. Frisby?

230
00:10:13,097 --> 00:10:18,067
If you walk out of your store
and head east down the highway

231
00:10:18,102 --> 00:10:21,821
for 200 yards,
you'll have quite an adventure.

232
00:10:26,075 --> 00:10:29,211
H-how was that?

233
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:37,336
You're not frightened, are you?

234
00:10:37,371 --> 00:10:39,472
Frightened?

235
00:10:39,507 --> 00:10:43,225
Me?

236
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,094
"Stonewall frisby"?

237
00:10:47,596 --> 00:10:50,733
Why, dwight david eisenhower
said to me

238
00:10:50,768 --> 00:10:55,738
when i was the very first man
to climb into a landing craft

239
00:10:55,773 --> 00:10:58,240
headed for the french coast...

240
00:11:02,611 --> 00:11:06,365
that was june the 6th...

241
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:10,753
1944.

242
00:11:10,788 --> 00:11:15,124
"Stoney," ike said, "stoney...

243
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:19,512
"you lead the invasion.

244
00:11:19,547 --> 00:11:21,380
"There'll be mines...

245
00:11:22,631 --> 00:11:25,768
"german e-boats...

246
00:11:25,803 --> 00:11:27,636
"stuka divebombers...

247
00:11:27,671 --> 00:11:29,522
"coast artillery...

248
00:11:29,557 --> 00:11:32,024
but you can do it."

249
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:33,893
Exceptional.

250
00:11:33,928 --> 00:11:35,778
Well?

251
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,532
L-i don't think
i better take the walk.

252
00:11:39,567 --> 00:11:42,034
It looks like rain.

253
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:43,903
Then youarefrightened.

254
00:11:43,938 --> 00:11:46,405
We had thought that
you'd be the one man

255
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,908
willing to take almost any risk.

256
00:11:48,943 --> 00:11:52,661
That may be very well, but...

257
00:11:52,696 --> 00:11:55,798
who may i ask
is saying all this?

258
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:57,666
If you walk down the road
as i suggested,

259
00:11:57,701 --> 00:12:00,669
you'll find out.

260
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:03,806
Well, rain
or no rain,

261
00:12:03,841 --> 00:12:05,674
i never was one

262
00:12:05,709 --> 00:12:07,560
to duck a little
excitement.

263
00:12:07,595 --> 00:12:09,428
W-w-who are you?

264
00:12:09,463 --> 00:12:11,931
You'll find out.

265
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:20,940
Well, all right, but wait till
i get my things put away.

266
00:12:20,975 --> 00:12:22,825
That won't be necessary.

267
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,693
You won't be coming back.

268
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,110
Come right ahead, mr. Frisby.

269
00:12:58,145 --> 00:13:00,613
We're waiting for you.

270
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:08,737
That's right, we're
waiting for you inside.

271
00:13:13,777 --> 00:13:16,879
Impressed, mr. Frisby?

272
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:18,747
Impressed?

273
00:13:20,034 --> 00:13:21,884
Why, with this rinky-dink?

274
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:25,638
This looks like a flea on a dog

275
00:13:25,673 --> 00:13:28,757
compared to the one
that i designed

276
00:13:28,792 --> 00:13:31,260
for the united states
space agency.

277
00:13:31,295 --> 00:13:36,265
And that was back in 1951.

278
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:39,401
"Old rocket thrust frisby"
they called me.

279
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:48,527
Please, mr. Frisby,
be so good as to enter.

280
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:03,926
How do you do,
mr. Frisby?

281
00:14:03,961 --> 00:14:05,177
Welcome, mr. Frisby.

282
00:14:05,212 --> 00:14:07,046
How do you do?

283
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,813
Yeah.

284
00:14:24,848 --> 00:14:27,316
Movie prop,
ain't it?

285
00:14:27,351 --> 00:14:29,201
Yeah, that's what
it is, ain't it?

286
00:14:29,818 --> 00:14:31,070
One of them
hollywood things

287
00:14:31,105 --> 00:14:34,206
advertisin' a flying
saucer picture or something.

288
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,960
Yeah, that's it...

289
00:14:37,995 --> 00:14:39,211
ain't it?

290
00:14:39,246 --> 00:14:41,714
In a word,
mr. Frisby, no.

291
00:14:41,749 --> 00:14:44,083
This is actually
a flying saucer,

292
00:14:44,118 --> 00:14:46,585
and we-
my colleagues and l-

293
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,470
are from another planet.

294
00:14:48,505 --> 00:14:50,589
L-l-i got
to be going.

295
00:14:50,624 --> 00:14:51,840
Correction,
mr. Frisby.

296
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:53,726
You are
staying.

297
00:14:53,761 --> 00:14:56,228
So why don't
you relax

298
00:14:56,263 --> 00:14:58,731
and be
comfortable?

299
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:17,533
What else did you gentlemen want
to know about?

300
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,035
Your research
in liquid propellants.

301
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:21,287
Oh, yeah.

302
00:15:21,322 --> 00:15:23,172
Liquid propellants.

303
00:15:23,207 --> 00:15:26,926
Mixed up the first batch
of that myself in my cellar.

304
00:15:26,961 --> 00:15:29,428
Folks in the hometown wanted me
to run for congress

305
00:15:29,463 --> 00:15:31,931
on account of
i'd got the country back

306
00:15:31,966 --> 00:15:33,799
in the space race.

307
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:38,187
But if there's one thing
i ain't, it's egotistical.

308
00:15:38,222 --> 00:15:41,307
I figure, it's a man's
patriotic duty

309
00:15:41,342 --> 00:15:43,192
to invent a liquid

310
00:15:43,227 --> 00:15:45,060
propellant if he has a mind to.

311
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:47,696
And i was a mind to.

312
00:15:47,731 --> 00:15:50,699
Well, even as a boy
at princeton university,

313
00:15:50,734 --> 00:15:54,453
they used to call me
"old liquid propellant frisby."

314
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:56,322
Next question.

315
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,458
Mr. Frisby,
forgive me,

316
00:15:59,493 --> 00:16:00,709
but you mentioned princeton.

317
00:16:00,744 --> 00:16:03,829
It's my understanding
that you went to the university

318
00:16:03,864 --> 00:16:04,463
of wichita.

319
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,332
Well, that, too.

320
00:16:06,367 --> 00:16:08,217
Happens to be a fact

321
00:16:08,252 --> 00:16:10,085
that i hold a degree

322
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,222
in 38 major universities

323
00:16:13,257 --> 00:16:15,090
of advanced schools
of higher learning.

324
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:17,476
Got a rogue scholarship, too,

325
00:16:18,093 --> 00:16:19,345
but i had to turn that down,

326
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:22,481
because i wouldn't bow
to the queen.

327
00:16:22,516 --> 00:16:24,984
Well, i think
that ought to take care

328
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:26,235
of all of your questions.

329
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,486
Now, if you don't mind,

330
00:16:28,103 --> 00:16:29,355
i'll be getting
home for supper.

331
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:31,857
I...

332
00:16:31,892 --> 00:16:33,108
say, it's getting late,

333
00:16:33,143 --> 00:16:34,994
and i got to get
home for supper.

334
00:16:35,029 --> 00:16:38,113
I got to get out of here.

335
00:16:38,148 --> 00:16:40,616
I gather that
you don't quite
understand

336
00:16:40,651 --> 00:16:42,501
the situation,
mr. Frisby.

337
00:16:42,536 --> 00:16:43,118
How's that?

338
00:16:43,153 --> 00:16:45,621
You're not going home
for supper.

339
00:16:45,656 --> 00:16:47,506
You shall have supper here.

340
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:48,507
Here?

341
00:16:48,542 --> 00:16:49,758
Precisely.

342
00:16:49,793 --> 00:16:56,015
In exactly... well, 14 minutes
by your measure of time,

343
00:16:56,632 --> 00:16:57,883
we'll be departing.

344
00:16:57,918 --> 00:17:00,386
Departing from
where to where?

345
00:17:00,421 --> 00:17:01,637
From here
to our planet.

346
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,273
You see, mr. Frisby,
our assignment here

347
00:17:04,308 --> 00:17:07,393
was to secure a
representative
earth specie,

348
00:17:07,428 --> 00:17:09,895
hopefully the
most brilliant
we could find.

349
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:11,780
There seems
to be no question

350
00:17:11,815 --> 00:17:13,649
that your
accomplishments

351
00:17:13,684 --> 00:17:15,150
are far and away
more extensive

352
00:17:15,185 --> 00:17:17,653
than those of
any other human
being on earth.

353
00:17:17,688 --> 00:17:18,904
Mine?

354
00:17:18,939 --> 00:17:20,155
Frisby's?

355
00:17:22,076 --> 00:17:23,909
Now, wait a minute.

356
00:17:23,944 --> 00:17:25,794
Wait a minute.

357
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:30,165
I'm just an old country boy
with a big mouth.

358
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,417
Oh,

359
00:17:31,452 --> 00:17:32,668
come now,
mr. Frisby.

360
00:17:32,703 --> 00:17:34,553
You do yourself a
terrible injustice.

361
00:17:34,588 --> 00:17:35,804
We know

362
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:37,306
all about you

363
00:17:37,341 --> 00:17:39,174
andyour
accomplishments.

364
00:17:39,209 --> 00:17:41,677
Accomplishments?

365
00:17:41,712 --> 00:17:48,567
Well, uh, i guess you might
just as well know now as later.

366
00:17:48,602 --> 00:17:53,572
Only accomplishment i got
you fellas evidently overlooked,

367
00:17:53,607 --> 00:17:57,326
and, well, that is
i'm the god darndest liar

368
00:17:57,361 --> 00:17:59,828
that ever hit the pike.

369
00:18:01,196 --> 00:18:04,333
I spin the biggest yarns
west of the rockies!

370
00:18:04,368 --> 00:18:08,087
And i don't mean
exaggeration, i mean lies-

371
00:18:08,122 --> 00:18:11,206
l-l-e-s, lies.

372
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,344
Don't you get it?

373
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:20,716
Uh, mr. Frisby...

374
00:18:20,751 --> 00:18:22,601
there are some terms

375
00:18:22,636 --> 00:18:26,355
that we cannot relate
to our own language.

376
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:30,726
This word "lie"
that you mention...

377
00:18:30,761 --> 00:18:33,228
you mean that...

378
00:18:33,263 --> 00:18:35,731
anything that anybody tells you

379
00:18:35,766 --> 00:18:39,485
just goes without saying that,
well, it's the truth?

380
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,488
Hence, everything
that i've told you,

381
00:18:42,523 --> 00:18:44,373
you believe?

382
00:18:44,408 --> 00:18:47,493
Hence, you're going
to take me up to your planet

383
00:18:47,528 --> 00:18:49,378
and put me in a cage?

384
00:18:49,413 --> 00:18:51,130
Oh, hardly that,
mr. Frisby.

385
00:18:51,165 --> 00:18:52,381
It won't be a cage.

386
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:54,883
We'll naturally have
to keep you confined

387
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,136
much as we do the
other specimens

388
00:18:57,171 --> 00:18:58,387
we've collected.

389
00:18:58,422 --> 00:18:59,254
Mr. Frisby,

390
00:18:59,289 --> 00:19:02,391
we have a marvelously
entertaining venutian.

391
00:19:02,426 --> 00:19:04,893
He sings on eight different
pitches simultaneously

392
00:19:04,928 --> 00:19:07,396
and accompanies himself
with his tail.

393
00:19:07,431 --> 00:19:09,148
Now, you wait a minute.

394
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:13,519
I am a bona fide american
citizen, and i got my rights.

395
00:19:13,554 --> 00:19:15,270
And furthermore...

396
00:19:15,305 --> 00:19:17,773
please contain
yourself,
mr. Frisby.

397
00:19:17,808 --> 00:19:21,527
Now, since we shall be
departing very shortly,

398
00:19:21,562 --> 00:19:24,029
you have your choice
of supper now,

399
00:19:24,064 --> 00:19:25,914
or perhaps you'd
prefer waiting.

400
00:19:25,949 --> 00:19:28,417
What will be
your pleasure?

401
00:19:28,452 --> 00:19:29,668
Pleasure?

402
00:19:29,703 --> 00:19:32,538
My pleasure is to punch
you right in the jaw.

403
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:52,691
Feeling better,
mr. Frisby?

404
00:19:52,726 --> 00:19:54,560
We'll be departing
in five minutes.

405
00:19:57,062 --> 00:19:59,565
Man, the last time
i saw anything

406
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,450
that looked like you,

407
00:20:01,485 --> 00:20:03,318
i'd been four days
on the corn jug,

408
00:20:03,353 --> 00:20:07,072
and even what i thought
i saw looked better

409
00:20:07,107 --> 00:20:09,575
than you do now.

410
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:11,460
Say, tell me,

411
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:13,962
are the girls
where you come from-

412
00:20:13,997 --> 00:20:16,465
do they look like you, too?

413
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,468
Oh, you'll become accustomed
to our appearance, mr. Frisby,

414
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:21,970
much as we've been able
to accustom ourselves

415
00:20:22,005 --> 00:20:23,222
to yours.

416
00:20:23,257 --> 00:20:24,473
Well...

417
00:20:24,508 --> 00:20:26,341
one thing i'll say about you,

418
00:20:26,376 --> 00:20:30,095
you... sure
are built hard.

419
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:32,598
Oh, we are indeed...

420
00:20:32,633 --> 00:20:34,483
by your standards,

421
00:20:34,518 --> 00:20:36,351
which is quite
fortunate for us.

422
00:20:36,386 --> 00:20:40,105
Say, do you mind
if i relax a little?

423
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:47,863
That horrible sound!

424
00:20:47,898 --> 00:20:50,115
You know, i was figuring

425
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:53,252
on giving a concert
on this some day.

426
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:02,010
Do you have harmonicas
on your planet?

427
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:13,388
You better scat.

428
00:21:13,423 --> 00:21:15,274
They didn't call you
"old mile-a-minute"...

429
00:21:15,309 --> 00:21:16,525
stay in your room,
mr. Frisby.

430
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,027
Frisby...

431
00:21:19,062 --> 00:21:20,279
let him out!
Lower the stair!

432
00:21:20,314 --> 00:21:21,530
No, don't
follow him.

433
00:21:21,565 --> 00:21:22,781
He has some sort

434
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:23,782
of fantastic instrument

435
00:21:23,817 --> 00:21:25,033
that lets out a death sound.

436
00:21:29,439 --> 00:21:32,040
We best get out of here
before he warns the others.

437
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:58,317
Surprise!

438
00:22:00,854 --> 00:22:02,070
What's going
on here?

439
00:22:02,105 --> 00:22:03,939
What do
you mean

440
00:22:03,974 --> 00:22:05,190
what's going
on here?

441
00:22:05,225 --> 00:22:07,075
Why, it's your birthday.

442
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:08,327
This is a surprise party.

443
00:22:08,362 --> 00:22:10,195
Here, sit down.

444
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,583
The presents, give
him the presents.

445
00:22:14,618 --> 00:22:17,085
I've been waiting
all day for this.

446
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,588
Open it up, frisby,
come on, open it up.

447
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:28,096
Read it out loud.

448
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:29,464
Yeah, yeah, uh, read...

449
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,968
mr. Frisby, for the first time
in his life,

450
00:22:33,003 --> 00:22:34,219
is at a loss for words.

451
00:22:35,389 --> 00:22:37,856
I'll read
it for him:

452
00:22:37,891 --> 00:22:39,858
"World's
greatest liar

453
00:22:39,893 --> 00:22:41,109
"mr. Somerset
frisby

454
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:42,978
"presented by his friends and...

455
00:22:43,013 --> 00:22:44,229
"occasion of his

456
00:22:44,264 --> 00:22:45,864
63rd birthday."

457
00:22:45,899 --> 00:22:48,367
Go ahead, frisby.

458
00:22:48,402 --> 00:22:49,985
Make a speech.

459
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,870
I've been waiting all day
for this.

460
00:22:51,905 --> 00:22:53,739
Yeah, come
on, frisby!

461
00:22:53,774 --> 00:22:55,624
Tell us one of them
real whoppers.

462
00:22:55,659 --> 00:22:57,492
Where you been
the last couple of hours?

463
00:22:57,527 --> 00:22:58,744
Did-did you invent something?

464
00:22:58,779 --> 00:23:01,246
Or maybe you took a quick trip
up to the moon, huh?

465
00:23:02,532 --> 00:23:05,634
Now, you know,
you ain't very far wrong.

466
00:23:05,669 --> 00:23:10,005
Do you know who them fellas
was out there in that car?

467
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,890
Well, i'll tell
you who they was.

468
00:23:11,925 --> 00:23:14,393
They was from
outer space.

469
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:18,146
Now, wait a minute.

470
00:23:18,181 --> 00:23:20,015
I don't know
how they did it,

471
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:21,266
but they just
whooshed me

472
00:23:21,301 --> 00:23:23,769
right through the air,

473
00:23:23,804 --> 00:23:25,654
right into their
flyin' saucer,

474
00:23:25,689 --> 00:23:27,522
and they was
going to kidnap me!

475
00:23:28,809 --> 00:23:31,660
But this is the truth,
honest, honest.

476
00:23:31,695 --> 00:23:33,528
You know how i got away?

477
00:23:33,563 --> 00:23:35,414
I just took out my harmonica...

478
00:23:37,282 --> 00:23:41,036
blew a couple of chords, and
they just fainted dead away.

479
00:23:41,071 --> 00:23:45,424
Aw! What
did i tell you?

480
00:23:45,459 --> 00:23:48,543
Ain't he the perfect limit?

481
00:23:48,578 --> 00:23:49,795
He sure is!

482
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:51,046
But this is the truth.

483
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,548
They had a big eye
right in the middle,

484
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:56,685
and they whooshed...

485
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,805
mr. Somerset frisby,
who might have profited

486
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,558
by reading an aesop fable
about a boy who cried wolf-

487
00:24:03,593 --> 00:24:06,061
tonight's tall tale
from the timberlands

488
00:24:06,096 --> 00:24:08,563
of the twilight zone.

489
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:15,987
Rod serling,
creator ofthe twilight zone,

490
00:24:16,022 --> 00:24:18,490
will tell you
about next week's story

491
00:24:18,525 --> 00:24:22,043
after this message.

492
00:24:22,078 --> 00:24:23,628
And now, mr. Serling.

493
00:24:23,663 --> 00:24:26,131
We have a return visit next week

494
00:24:26,166 --> 00:24:28,633
from a most imminent performer,
joseph schildkraut.

495
00:24:28,668 --> 00:24:30,502
And his vehicle is called,
"the trade-ins."

496
00:24:30,537 --> 00:24:32,387
It's a story of a future society

497
00:24:32,422 --> 00:24:34,890
in which new bodies
may be traded for old.

498
00:24:34,925 --> 00:24:36,141
It's my own personal feeling

499
00:24:36,176 --> 00:24:38,009
that of all the various
story areas we've tackled

500
00:24:38,044 --> 00:24:40,512
inthe twilight zone,
this has the most import,

501
00:24:40,547 --> 00:24:42,397
and carries with it
the most poignance.

502
00:24:42,432 --> 00:24:44,900
I hope you'll be able
to be with us next week.

503
00:24:44,935 --> 00:24:47,402
Here in one cigarette,
a chesterfield,

504
00:24:47,437 --> 00:24:48,653
is all the flavor and taste

505
00:24:48,688 --> 00:24:51,156
of 21 of the world's
finest tobaccos,

506
00:24:51,191 --> 00:24:53,024
aged mild and then blended mild.

507
00:24:53,059 --> 00:24:54,910
The end result-
tobacco too mild to filter,

508
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:57,412
a pleasure too good to miss.

509
00:24:57,447 --> 00:24:59,281
Smoke for pleasure,
smoke chesterfield.

510
00:25:29,844 --> 00:25:32,447
This is james arness.

511
00:25:32,482 --> 00:25:34,316
You know, it's only a short hop

512
00:25:34,351 --> 00:25:37,452
fromthe twilight zone
to dodge city ingunsmoke.

513
00:25:37,487 --> 00:25:40,071
Saturday nights
over most of these stations.
