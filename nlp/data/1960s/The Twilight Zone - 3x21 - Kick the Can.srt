1
00:00:10,777 --> 00:00:13,279
You're traveling
through another dimension-

2
00:00:13,314 --> 00:00:16,399
a dimension not only of sight
and sound, but of mind,

3
00:00:16,434 --> 00:00:18,284
a journey into a wondrous land

4
00:00:18,319 --> 00:00:20,153
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

5
00:00:20,188 --> 00:00:23,289
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

6
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:49,626
My son is coming to get me.

7
00:01:49,661 --> 00:01:51,494
Good-bye.

8
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:07,760
Good luck.

9
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,073
I didn't say i'd come
and get you, dad.

10
00:03:10,108 --> 00:03:11,958
I said i'd come

11
00:03:11,993 --> 00:03:13,826
and we'd
talk about it.

12
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:29,842
Five... ten...

13
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:33,730
15... 20... 25...

14
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:38,735
30... 35... 40...

15
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:40,853
45... 50...

16
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:42,605
55... 60...

17
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:49,495
65... 70...
75... 80...

18
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,864
85, 90, 95, 100!

19
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:54,367
Here i come, ready or not!

20
00:04:19,275 --> 00:04:20,526
Hey, mister.

21
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:21,778
That's our can.

22
00:04:21,813 --> 00:04:23,029
We're playing.

23
00:04:25,281 --> 00:04:26,032
Hey, mister.

24
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:54,811
Sunnyvale rest,

25
00:04:54,846 --> 00:04:56,679
a home for the aged-

26
00:04:56,714 --> 00:04:57,930
a dying place-

27
00:04:57,965 --> 00:05:00,433
and a common children's game
called kick-the-can

28
00:05:00,468 --> 00:05:02,318
that will shortly
become a refuge

29
00:05:02,353 --> 00:05:05,438
for a man who knows
he will die in this world

30
00:05:05,473 --> 00:05:09,826
if he doesn't escape
into the twilight zone.

31
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:15,581
...75, 80,

32
00:05:15,616 --> 00:05:18,701
85, 90, 95, 100.

33
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:20,586
Here i come, ready or not.

34
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:43,476
Give that can!

35
00:05:45,396 --> 00:05:47,230
Listen to them.

36
00:05:47,265 --> 00:05:48,481
How can a man think?

37
00:05:48,516 --> 00:05:51,617
They aren't supposed
to play on the grounds.

38
00:05:51,652 --> 00:05:52,869
The children?

39
00:05:52,904 --> 00:05:54,737
Are they hurting anyone?

40
00:05:54,772 --> 00:05:57,874
Old people
need their rest.

41
00:05:57,909 --> 00:05:59,742
Let them play
someplace else.

42
00:05:59,777 --> 00:06:01,627
They got playgrounds.

43
00:06:01,662 --> 00:06:04,130
They got homes.

44
00:06:04,165 --> 00:06:06,632
Well, it's the grass, ben.

45
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:11,003
Kids can't resist going
where the grass is.

46
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:17,894
What's wrong?

47
00:06:19,297 --> 00:06:20,513
Nothing.

48
00:06:21,764 --> 00:06:24,267
Your own son turns against you.

49
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:29,772
Well... the boy
has got a lot of problems.

50
00:06:29,807 --> 00:06:31,657
It's a small house,

51
00:06:31,692 --> 00:06:34,777
and the second baby
is on the way.

52
00:06:34,812 --> 00:06:36,662
It was a foolish idea thinking

53
00:06:36,697 --> 00:06:38,531
i could move
in on them.

54
00:06:38,566 --> 00:06:42,285
They don't want
an old duffer like me underfoot.

55
00:06:43,786 --> 00:06:47,540
No... this place is
good enough for me.

56
00:06:48,209 --> 00:06:50,676
Listen to 'em.

57
00:06:50,711 --> 00:06:53,179
It's enough
to wake the dead!

58
00:06:53,214 --> 00:06:55,681
Oh, ben, they're
playing kick-the-can.

59
00:06:55,716 --> 00:06:57,550
Don't you remember?

60
00:06:57,585 --> 00:07:01,304
Oh, we used to play
it all the time.

61
00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:03,189
Oh, we were running
and shouting...

62
00:07:03,224 --> 00:07:05,057
and all that noise.

63
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:06,943
Well, you can't
stop kids

64
00:07:06,978 --> 00:07:08,811
from playing
kick-the-can.

65
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:10,696
It's like statues and...

66
00:07:10,731 --> 00:07:13,199
and hide-and-seek.

67
00:07:13,234 --> 00:07:16,319
It's in their...
their blood.

68
00:07:16,354 --> 00:07:18,204
It's a...

69
00:07:18,239 --> 00:07:22,575
a special summer ritual.

70
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:25,077
Five, ten, 15,
20, 25, 30...

71
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:28,831
did you ever
stop to think of it?

72
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:31,334
All kids play those games.

73
00:07:31,369 --> 00:07:33,219
And the minute they stop,

74
00:07:33,254 --> 00:07:35,087
they begin to grow old.

75
00:07:37,974 --> 00:07:43,596
It's almost as though playing
kick-the-can keeps them young.

76
00:07:44,847 --> 00:07:46,732
You ever notice that?

77
00:07:49,352 --> 00:07:53,105
Say, you don't believe
in magic, do you?

78
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:56,859
There... there was a time
that you did.

79
00:07:56,894 --> 00:08:00,613
You know, we've known
each other ever since...

80
00:08:00,648 --> 00:08:02,498
oh, i can't remember.

81
00:08:03,784 --> 00:08:07,503
Ever since we were
a couple of towheaded kids.

82
00:08:07,538 --> 00:08:09,372
And you believed
in magic then.

83
00:08:09,407 --> 00:08:11,257
Me? Magic?

84
00:08:11,292 --> 00:08:13,759
Yes, you did.

85
00:08:13,794 --> 00:08:17,513
When we walked on different
sides of a street lamp

86
00:08:17,548 --> 00:08:19,382
you'd say,
"bread and butter."

87
00:08:19,417 --> 00:08:21,267
When your baby
teeth came out

88
00:08:21,302 --> 00:08:23,769
you put them
under the pillow

89
00:08:23,804 --> 00:08:25,021
for the tooth fairy.

90
00:08:25,056 --> 00:08:27,523
Yeah, you believed
in magic.

91
00:08:30,026 --> 00:08:32,528
What happened, ben?

92
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:38,150
What changed you?

93
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:43,289
Was it time that did it?

94
00:08:43,324 --> 00:08:45,157
Or was it something else?

95
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:47,660
We grew up, that's all.

96
00:08:47,695 --> 00:08:49,545
Everybody gets older.

97
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:52,048
Maybe there are...

98
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:53,916
people who stay young.

99
00:08:56,419 --> 00:09:00,806
Maybe they know a secret
they keep from the rest of us.

100
00:09:01,424 --> 00:09:02,675
Charles.

101
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:07,063
Maybe the fountain of youth
isn't a fountain at all.

102
00:09:07,098 --> 00:09:10,182
Maybe it's a way
of looking at things...

103
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:11,434
a way of thinking.

104
00:09:11,469 --> 00:09:12,685
Charles, stop it.

105
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,187
You're an old man,
you understand?

106
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:17,073
Your youth has been gone

107
00:09:17,108 --> 00:09:18,941
for 60 years.

108
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:20,826
What i mean is, uh...

109
00:09:20,861 --> 00:09:23,329
you've lived a full life,
charles.

110
00:09:23,364 --> 00:09:25,197
Don't go sloppy now.

111
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:27,700
Don't spoil it
by acting like a nut.

112
00:09:28,951 --> 00:09:30,836
But it's all so clear.

113
00:09:30,871 --> 00:09:32,088
It makes sense.

114
00:09:32,123 --> 00:09:35,207
Can't-can't you
see it, ben?

115
00:09:43,966 --> 00:09:45,851
Oh, no, you were quite right
to come to me.

116
00:09:45,886 --> 00:09:47,103
When he acts like that,

117
00:09:47,138 --> 00:09:49,605
l-i feel i don't
know him at all.

118
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,474
Well, mr. Conroy,

119
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:55,861
when people grow old,
truly old,

120
00:09:55,896 --> 00:09:58,364
they begin to act
a little peculiar.

121
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,866
Now mr. Agee, for instance.

122
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:02,118
Some way he got ahold
of a few firecrackers,

123
00:10:02,153 --> 00:10:03,986
and i found them
trying to set one of them off.

124
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:06,489
Now he could've gotten hurt.

125
00:10:06,524 --> 00:10:10,242
Every time
one of our people goes senile,

126
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:12,128
i get a little cold inside.

127
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:14,630
When i first
took this assignment, i was 32.

128
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:17,133
Now i'm 43.

129
00:10:17,168 --> 00:10:22,755
Everyone grows older,
mr. Conroy, even me.

130
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:53,919
Nyeah!

131
00:10:53,954 --> 00:10:56,422
Oh, what's wrong
with you people?!

132
00:10:56,457 --> 00:10:58,290
Can't you show a little life?!

133
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:00,793
Are you the ones
who skipped rope?

134
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,431
And hunt for polliwogs?

135
00:11:05,466 --> 00:11:06,682
Huh?

136
00:11:07,683 --> 00:11:09,552
And run through sprinklers?

137
00:11:09,587 --> 00:11:10,803
Huh?

138
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:17,560
Run through sprinklers.

139
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:25,701
Hey!

140
00:11:25,736 --> 00:11:27,570
What are you going to do?

141
00:11:27,605 --> 00:11:29,455
Why, that's the
silliest thing

142
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:31,073
i've ever seen.

143
00:11:31,108 --> 00:11:32,324
Oh! Oh!

144
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:35,461
Let him drown himself
if he wants to.

145
00:11:35,496 --> 00:11:37,329
Come on in!

146
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:38,581
The water's fine!

147
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:44,220
Mr. Whitley!

148
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:46,589
Come on, get out of there.

149
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,091
Mr. Whitley,

150
00:11:49,126 --> 00:11:50,843
what's the matter
with you?

151
00:11:50,878 --> 00:11:53,345
Here, now you
get him inside.

152
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,482
Fresh clothing,
and get him to bed!

153
00:11:56,517 --> 00:12:00,236
I was afraid something
like this would happen.

154
00:12:00,271 --> 00:12:03,239
In the morning,
i'll have to put him

155
00:12:03,274 --> 00:12:05,107
in a special ward
for observation.

156
00:12:05,142 --> 00:12:08,244
We're going to isolate him
for a while.

157
00:12:09,245 --> 00:12:11,747
That'll kill him.

158
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:26,545
Senile?

159
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,431
Me?

160
00:12:28,466 --> 00:12:30,549
Put me in a
special ward?

161
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:31,801
Alone?

162
00:12:31,836 --> 00:12:33,052
Show them
you're all right.

163
00:12:33,087 --> 00:12:34,303
Cut the crazy talk.

164
00:12:34,338 --> 00:12:36,188
Act like everyone else.

165
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:38,057
Oh, what a choice.

166
00:12:38,092 --> 00:12:39,308
To keep an attendant

167
00:12:39,343 --> 00:12:41,811
from pawing at
my pulse all day

168
00:12:41,846 --> 00:12:43,062
i have to sit

169
00:12:43,097 --> 00:12:44,947
like a... vegetable
on that porch.

170
00:12:44,982 --> 00:12:46,816
I'm trying to help you.

171
00:12:46,851 --> 00:12:50,569
Now, keep on like this
and they'll put you away.

172
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:51,821
Use your head.

173
00:12:52,455 --> 00:12:54,323
Maybe you're right.

174
00:13:50,513 --> 00:13:51,764
Come. Come.

175
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:53,015
What is it, fire?

176
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:54,266
Shh!

177
00:14:03,025 --> 00:14:04,276
Hmm? Huh?

178
00:14:04,311 --> 00:14:05,528
Wake the girls.

179
00:14:05,563 --> 00:14:07,396
Call mrs. Summers
and mrs. Worcester.

180
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:08,647
It's important.

181
00:14:16,539 --> 00:14:18,407
Huh?

182
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:27,917
Psst! Psst!

183
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:33,556
What are we
doing here?

184
00:14:33,591 --> 00:14:36,058
I'll catch
my death.

185
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:38,561
We ought
to be in bed.

186
00:14:38,596 --> 00:14:39,812
What would
mr. Cox say?

187
00:14:40,429 --> 00:14:41,680
Well, he'd say
being awake

188
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:43,566
is dangerous
and silly.

189
00:14:43,601 --> 00:14:46,068
He'd probably say
we're crazy.

190
00:14:46,103 --> 00:14:49,188
Well, maybe
you got to be a little crazy

191
00:14:49,223 --> 00:14:50,439
to make the magic work.

192
00:14:51,073 --> 00:14:54,827
Remember how we used to do it?

193
00:14:54,862 --> 00:14:59,198
We'd sneak out at night
when the weather was like this?

194
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:02,952
And we'd play kick-the-can.

195
00:15:02,987 --> 00:15:03,702
Oh, everybody

196
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:05,704
played that game,
or hide-and-seek.

197
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:11,961
Yeah, seems like
a million years ago.

198
00:15:15,097 --> 00:15:16,849
Say, you know something?

199
00:15:16,884 --> 00:15:19,969
I was the fastest runner
on our block.

200
00:15:20,603 --> 00:15:24,356
When we would play kick-the-can,
i was never "it."

201
00:15:26,108 --> 00:15:28,360
Look how i've changed.

202
00:15:30,112 --> 00:15:33,616
I remember.

203
00:15:35,618 --> 00:15:38,120
We all get old.

204
00:15:40,623 --> 00:15:42,741
It's the running
i miss most.

205
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:43,993
Me, too.

206
00:15:44,028 --> 00:15:46,495
I think if i could
only run again

207
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:49,632
then growing old
wouldn't be so bad.

208
00:15:51,133 --> 00:15:55,004
People getting on
need their rest.

209
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:56,889
Well, we can't

210
00:15:56,924 --> 00:15:58,757
run fast or far

211
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:01,260
but... well, we can move

212
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:03,762
and there are trees and bushes.

213
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:06,765
Maybe if the hunted
are handicapped

214
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,651
so is the hunter.

215
00:16:08,686 --> 00:16:10,269
Us?

216
00:16:10,304 --> 00:16:12,154
Children's games?

217
00:16:12,189 --> 00:16:14,406
Yes, that's the secret.

218
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:15,658
Don't you see?

219
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:17,526
The secret of youth.

220
00:16:18,661 --> 00:16:19,912
Say, you know

221
00:16:19,947 --> 00:16:22,781
i was the fastest runner
on our block?

222
00:16:24,667 --> 00:16:26,919
You can't beserious.

223
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:30,923
He isn't serious.

224
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:32,541
You bet i am.

225
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:34,426
Look!

226
00:16:34,461 --> 00:16:36,295
Think! Feel!

227
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:38,180
Here, hold it.

228
00:16:38,215 --> 00:16:41,934
Doesn't that wake some
sleeping part of you?

229
00:16:45,472 --> 00:16:46,689
Listen.

230
00:16:46,724 --> 00:16:48,557
Can't you hear it?

231
00:16:53,195 --> 00:16:56,315
Summer... grass...

232
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:59,451
run... jump... youth!

233
00:17:00,703 --> 00:17:03,822
Wake up!

234
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:06,325
Oh, this is your last chance.

235
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:10,079
I can't play kick-the-can alone.

236
00:17:21,223 --> 00:17:22,474
Charles.

237
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:24,977
What are you doing?

238
00:17:25,594 --> 00:17:26,845
Aw, ben.

239
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,348
Come with us,
out on the lawn.

240
00:17:29,383 --> 00:17:30,599
Me?

241
00:17:30,634 --> 00:17:31,850
Yes, you, ben.

242
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:34,353
We've always done
everything together.

243
00:17:34,388 --> 00:17:36,238
Let's not stop now.

244
00:17:36,273 --> 00:17:38,107
Come. Come with us, ben.

245
00:17:38,142 --> 00:17:40,609
Come play kick-the-can.

246
00:17:40,644 --> 00:17:42,361
Charles.

247
00:17:42,396 --> 00:17:44,863
Come to your senses.

248
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:46,749
Ben, you're afraid.

249
00:17:46,784 --> 00:17:49,868
You're afraid
of a new idea.

250
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:51,754
You're afraid
to look silly.

251
00:17:51,789 --> 00:17:54,256
You're afraid
to make a mistake.

252
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:58,127
You decided
that you were an old man

253
00:17:58,162 --> 00:18:00,012
and that has made you old.

254
00:18:00,047 --> 00:18:01,764
Iamold,

255
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:03,632
and so are you, charles,
that's a fact.

256
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:04,883
Fact.

257
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:06,769
Your bones are old,

258
00:18:06,804 --> 00:18:09,271
and they'll break
if you try to run with them.

259
00:18:09,306 --> 00:18:12,391
Your heart is old
and your lungs are old.

260
00:18:12,426 --> 00:18:14,276
You're used up.

261
00:18:14,311 --> 00:18:16,145
Worn out by a lifetime.

262
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,898
Sit down, charles.

263
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:24,903
You're tired.

264
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:26,789
Sit down.

265
00:18:26,824 --> 00:18:28,657
I can't.

266
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:30,542
Charles.

267
00:18:31,794 --> 00:18:34,913
I've got to find out, ben.

268
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:36,799
Help me.

269
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:42,421
There is magic in the world.

270
00:18:42,456 --> 00:18:44,306
I know there is.

271
00:18:46,175 --> 00:18:48,677
When i fell in love with mary,

272
00:18:48,712 --> 00:18:52,431
kissed her for the first time,

273
00:18:52,466 --> 00:18:54,316
that was magic.

274
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,572
When my boy was born,

275
00:19:00,607 --> 00:19:02,441
that was magic.

276
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:08,080
Friendship is a magic thing.

277
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:13,085
Maybe i'm right, ben.

278
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:18,090
Maybe kick-the-can
is the greatest magic of all.

279
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:26,849
All right, ben,

280
00:19:26,884 --> 00:19:30,602
i'll do it
without you.

281
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:34,416
Mr. Cox!

282
00:21:06,483 --> 00:21:11,453
Mr. Cox! Mr. Cox?!

283
00:21:11,488 --> 00:21:14,573
Mr. Cox!

284
00:21:15,824 --> 00:21:16,708
Mr. Cox!

285
00:21:16,743 --> 00:21:18,577
Mr. Cox! Mr. Cox!

286
00:21:18,612 --> 00:21:19,828
What is it?

287
00:21:19,863 --> 00:21:21,079
Hurry, stop them.

288
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:22,965
What are you
talking about?

289
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,833
They've all
gone outside.

290
00:21:24,868 --> 00:21:26,084
Well, why?

291
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:27,336
To play
kick-the-can.

292
00:21:27,371 --> 00:21:29,221
Now, calm down.

293
00:21:29,256 --> 00:21:31,089
What'll he do when
nothing happens?

294
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:33,592
He really believes
he'll be young.

295
00:21:33,627 --> 00:21:34,843
Charlie's it.

296
00:21:34,878 --> 00:21:36,094
Hurry.

297
00:21:37,381 --> 00:21:38,597
Now, where?

298
00:21:38,632 --> 00:21:41,099
On the front lawn.

299
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:44,102
...20, 25,

300
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:45,354
30, 35,

301
00:21:45,389 --> 00:21:48,490
4o, 45, 50...

302
00:21:48,525 --> 00:21:50,993
55, 60,

303
00:21:51,028 --> 00:21:53,495
65, 70,

304
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:56,114
75, 80,

305
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:58,617
85, 90...

306
00:21:58,652 --> 00:22:00,252
where are the old people?

307
00:22:00,287 --> 00:22:02,120
What are these kids
doing here?

308
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:04,006
I told them
not to play here.

309
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:05,257
Go on, kids!

310
00:22:05,292 --> 00:22:07,125
You'll wake everybody up!

311
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:11,380
Ready or not, here i come!

312
00:22:11,415 --> 00:22:15,017
Maybe whitley took them
around to the back.

313
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:19,388
One, two, three, you're out.

314
00:22:20,022 --> 00:22:21,273
Charles.

315
00:22:21,308 --> 00:22:22,891
Charlie, is that you?

316
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:27,396
Is that you,
charlie?

317
00:22:27,431 --> 00:22:30,782
Charlie, it's me, benny.

318
00:22:30,817 --> 00:22:33,035
Charlie...

319
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:35,153
take me with you.

320
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:37,289
Take me
with you.

321
00:22:37,324 --> 00:22:39,408
Charlie,
wait for me.

322
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:42,661
Wait.

323
00:22:42,696 --> 00:22:45,163
Last one into the forest
is a rotten apple!

324
00:22:45,198 --> 00:22:47,416
No, charlie, no.

325
00:22:47,451 --> 00:22:48,667
Wait for me.

326
00:22:49,918 --> 00:22:51,169
Olly, olly oxen free.

327
00:22:51,204 --> 00:22:52,921
Charlie... it's me.

328
00:22:52,956 --> 00:22:55,307
Olly, olly oxen free.

329
00:22:55,342 --> 00:22:59,428
Charlie... it's me.

330
00:23:04,433 --> 00:23:06,935
Listen, i'll bet
whitley's taken them

331
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:08,820
all down
to the orchard.

332
00:23:08,855 --> 00:23:10,072
Come on.

333
00:23:16,945 --> 00:23:18,830
Look all you want, mr. Cox,

334
00:23:18,865 --> 00:23:21,333
you won't find them.

335
00:23:21,368 --> 00:23:25,087
Olly, olly oxen free.

336
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:35,714
Olly, olly oxen free.

337
00:23:49,478 --> 00:23:51,980
Sunnyvale rest,
a dying place for ancient people

338
00:23:52,015 --> 00:23:55,117
who have forgotten
the fragile magic of youth.

339
00:23:55,152 --> 00:23:57,619
A dying place for those
who have forgotten

340
00:23:57,654 --> 00:24:00,122
that childhood,
maturity and old age

341
00:24:00,157 --> 00:24:03,241
are curiously intertwined
and not separate.

342
00:24:03,276 --> 00:24:05,127
A dying place for those

343
00:24:05,162 --> 00:24:06,995
who have grown too stiff
in their thinking

344
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:12,000
to visit the twilight zone.

345
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:17,973
Rod serling,
creator ofthe twilight zone,

346
00:24:18,008 --> 00:24:19,841
will tell you
about next week's story

347
00:24:19,876 --> 00:24:23,211
after this message.

348
00:24:23,246 --> 00:24:25,230
And now, mr. Serling.

349
00:24:25,265 --> 00:24:27,098
Next week onthe twilight zone,

350
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:30,235
we roll in a musical instrument
purchased in this store.

351
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:32,103
Now there are pianos and pianos,

352
00:24:32,138 --> 00:24:33,989
but this one was manufactured

353
00:24:34,024 --> 00:24:36,491
in our own very strange,
unpredictable factory.

354
00:24:36,526 --> 00:24:38,994
It comes to you via the
typewriter of mr. Earl hamner

355
00:24:39,029 --> 00:24:42,747
and it boasts a collection
of oddities and oddball doings.

356
00:24:42,782 --> 00:24:43,999
Next week,
you can roll up the rug

357
00:24:44,034 --> 00:24:47,752
as we bring you
"a piano in the house."

358
00:25:19,484 --> 00:25:22,621
Radio free europe needs
your help to fight communism.

359
00:25:22,656 --> 00:25:27,125
Give now to radio free europe.
