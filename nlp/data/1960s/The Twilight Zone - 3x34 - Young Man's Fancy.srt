1
00:00:10,393 --> 00:00:12,278
You're traveling
through another dimension-

2
00:00:12,313 --> 00:00:15,398
a dimension not only of sight
and sound, but of mind,

3
00:00:15,433 --> 00:00:17,283
a journey into a wondrous land

4
00:00:17,318 --> 00:00:19,786
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

5
00:00:19,821 --> 00:00:22,906
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

6
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:34,801
You're looking at the house of
the late mrs. Henrietta walker.

7
00:00:34,836 --> 00:00:39,806
This is mrs. Walker herself,
as she appeared 25 years ago.

8
00:00:42,058 --> 00:00:45,178
And this,
except for isolated objects,

9
00:00:45,213 --> 00:00:47,680
is the living room
of mrs. Walker's house

10
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:50,183
as it appeared
in that same year.

11
00:00:50,218 --> 00:00:53,937
The other rooms upstairs
and down are much the same.

12
00:00:53,972 --> 00:00:58,324
The time, however,
is not 25 years ago, but now.

13
00:00:58,942 --> 00:01:01,444
The house of the late
mrs. Henrietta walker is,

14
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:05,832
you see, a house which belongs
almost entirely to the past;

15
00:01:05,867 --> 00:01:08,952
a house which,
like mrs. Walker's clock here,

16
00:01:08,987 --> 00:01:12,088
has ceased to recognize
the passage of time.

17
00:01:12,123 --> 00:01:14,591
Only one element
is missing now-

18
00:01:14,626 --> 00:01:18,344
one remaining item in the estate
of the late mrs. Walker:

19
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:23,850
Her son alex, 34 years of age,
and up till 20 minutes ago,

20
00:01:23,885 --> 00:01:26,970
the so-called
perennial bachelor.

21
00:01:27,005 --> 00:01:30,106
With him is his bride,
the former miss virginia lane.

22
00:01:30,141 --> 00:01:31,975
They're returning
from the city hall

23
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:33,860
in order to get
mr. Walker's clothes packed,

24
00:01:33,895 --> 00:01:36,980
make final arrangements
for the sale of the house,

25
00:01:37,015 --> 00:01:39,482
lock it up and depart
on their honeymoon.

26
00:01:39,517 --> 00:01:42,869
Not a complicated set of tasks,
it would appear,

27
00:01:42,904 --> 00:01:45,989
and yet the newlywed mrs. Walker
is about to discover

28
00:01:46,024 --> 00:01:50,376
that the old adage
"you can't go home again"

29
00:01:50,411 --> 00:01:54,130
has little meaning
in the twilight zone.

30
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,823
Thank you, darling.

31
00:02:24,194 --> 00:02:25,445
Well...

32
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,947
well, shall we
get started?

33
00:02:27,982 --> 00:02:29,199
Darling?

34
00:02:29,234 --> 00:02:31,084
Yes, of course.

35
00:02:31,119 --> 00:02:32,952
Did you call
mr. Wilkinson

36
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:34,204
and tell him
when we'd be back?

37
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,089
Oh, no, i forgot.

38
00:02:36,124 --> 00:02:37,957
Well, you'd better call him
now, then.

39
00:02:37,992 --> 00:02:39,843
You have to sign
the papers before we leave.

40
00:02:39,878 --> 00:02:41,711
Yes, of course.

41
00:02:42,212 --> 00:02:45,348
I thought i'd clean
the place up a little

42
00:02:45,383 --> 00:02:46,599
before we left.

43
00:02:46,634 --> 00:02:47,851
I'll get it
out of here.

44
00:02:47,886 --> 00:02:50,970
Uh-uh. You go call
mr. Wilkinson.

45
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:00,363
I thought i left
his card right here.

46
00:03:00,398 --> 00:03:01,614
I can't seem
to find it.

47
00:03:01,649 --> 00:03:04,117
Well, get the number
from information.

48
00:03:04,152 --> 00:03:05,985
Oh, of course.

49
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,488
Look... i'll tell you what.

50
00:03:08,523 --> 00:03:09,739
You go on up and pack,

51
00:03:09,774 --> 00:03:14,127
and i'll call mr. Wilkinson,
all right?

52
00:03:14,162 --> 00:03:15,378
Oh, darling,

53
00:03:15,413 --> 00:03:17,247
everything's going
to be all right.

54
00:03:17,282 --> 00:03:19,132
I'm so happy
to be mrs. Walker

55
00:03:19,167 --> 00:03:20,383
at last,

56
00:03:20,418 --> 00:03:22,252
after all
these years.

57
00:03:25,255 --> 00:03:27,757
Come on, go on up
and pack.

58
00:03:28,391 --> 00:03:30,260
All right.

59
00:04:12,435 --> 00:04:16,189
Oh, would you give me the number
of wilkinson realty, please?

60
00:04:16,224 --> 00:04:18,057
On main street.

61
00:04:41,965 --> 00:04:43,833
Thank you.

62
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:54,477
Mr. Wilkinson?

63
00:04:54,512 --> 00:04:56,346
Virginia lane.

64
00:04:56,381 --> 00:05:00,733
I mean, virginia walker.

65
00:05:00,768 --> 00:05:02,602
Yes, yes, just now.

66
00:05:02,637 --> 00:05:05,738
Oh, thank you, mr. Wilkinson.

67
00:05:05,773 --> 00:05:08,858
Oh, yes, i am very happy.

68
00:05:08,893 --> 00:05:10,743
Yes, we're back now.

69
00:05:10,778 --> 00:05:13,863
If you'd bring the papers over
so mr. Walker can sign them,

70
00:05:13,898 --> 00:05:16,366
you can show the house
while we're gone.

71
00:05:16,401 --> 00:05:18,251
Oh, right away.

72
00:05:18,286 --> 00:05:21,371
Fine. We'll see you
in a few minutes.

73
00:05:21,406 --> 00:05:22,622
Thank you.

74
00:05:23,873 --> 00:05:25,758
Alex, i thought
you were going to...

75
00:05:25,793 --> 00:05:27,010
oh, there's
plenty of time.

76
00:05:27,045 --> 00:05:28,261
What do you think

77
00:05:28,296 --> 00:05:30,763
we should take out
of here when we move?

78
00:05:30,798 --> 00:05:33,266
The television set,
i guess, huh?

79
00:05:33,883 --> 00:05:36,386
And, uh, the electric clock.

80
00:05:36,421 --> 00:05:38,521
It's only a
few years old.

81
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:42,141
Darling, i thought
we decided

82
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:45,895
to discuss all that
after the house was sold.

83
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:47,146
Sold?

84
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:49,649
I know, but i
just thought

85
00:05:49,684 --> 00:05:52,151
that maybe we
should decide now.

86
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:56,539
I mean, like, in the
kitchen, for instance.

87
00:05:56,574 --> 00:05:57,790
We'll take the
refrigerator

88
00:05:57,825 --> 00:05:59,042
and the stove.

89
00:05:59,077 --> 00:05:59,659
They're pretty new.

90
00:05:59,694 --> 00:06:00,910
I just bought
them for mother

91
00:06:00,945 --> 00:06:02,161
a few months...

92
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:04,664
a few months
before she died.

93
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:05,915
All right, alex, fine.

94
00:06:06,549 --> 00:06:09,669
We'll discuss it later,
but we've really got to leave.

95
00:06:09,704 --> 00:06:10,920
Of course.

96
00:06:10,955 --> 00:06:12,171
Well?

97
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:13,423
What about the radio?

98
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:16,926
It's pretty old,
but we could have it fixed.

99
00:06:16,961 --> 00:06:18,811
Maybe it works now.

100
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,931
Look at it.

101
00:06:21,966 --> 00:06:23,816
It weighs a ton, i bet.

102
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:26,319
Look at all this carving-

103
00:06:26,354 --> 00:06:29,439
all the work
they put into it,

104
00:06:29,474 --> 00:06:30,690
the craft...

105
00:06:30,725 --> 00:06:34,077
the programs
we used to hear on this.

106
00:06:34,112 --> 00:06:36,579
Major bowes,
fred allen...

107
00:06:36,614 --> 00:06:37,830
and all the music.

108
00:06:37,865 --> 00:06:42,835
We used to sit in here
all the time listening to music.

109
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:47,206
Mother's favorite
was eddy duchin.

110
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,709
I just remembered...

111
00:06:49,744 --> 00:06:52,211
she used to be crazy
about a record of his

112
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:53,463
called "the lady in red."

113
00:06:53,498 --> 00:06:54,714
You remember that?

114
00:06:54,749 --> 00:06:56,599
Uh-huh.

115
00:06:56,634 --> 00:06:58,351
? the lady in red?

116
00:06:58,386 --> 00:07:02,105
? all the fellows are crazy
for the lady in red...?

117
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:07,727
Broken.

118
00:07:07,762 --> 00:07:10,863
I knew it was.

119
00:07:19,989 --> 00:07:23,126
She used to sit in this chair

120
00:07:23,161 --> 00:07:24,994
and look
at the movie magazine.

121
00:07:27,497 --> 00:07:30,633
Funny i should remember
that, too.

122
00:07:30,668 --> 00:07:33,136
She gave it up
a long time ago.

123
00:07:35,638 --> 00:07:38,758
Sometimes, she'd make
a pan of fudge for us,

124
00:07:38,793 --> 00:07:40,643
and we'd sit here...

125
00:07:40,678 --> 00:07:42,512
alex, darling,
come on.

126
00:07:42,547 --> 00:07:45,648
We have to leave when
mr. Wilkinson comes.

127
00:07:50,019 --> 00:07:52,522
Maybe we could
get this fixed.

128
00:07:52,557 --> 00:07:55,658
Used to be
a real good clock.

129
00:07:55,693 --> 00:07:58,161
We'll discuss that
later, huh?

130
00:08:26,556 --> 00:08:28,057
He's mine now!

131
00:08:28,092 --> 00:08:32,445
You'll never get
your claws on him again.

132
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:44,267
Alex?

133
00:09:44,302 --> 00:09:46,135
Alex!

134
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:15,915
Oh, i, uh... i was just looking

135
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:19,669
at some of my old things
that mother kept.

136
00:10:19,704 --> 00:10:23,422
Look. Looks as good as ever.

137
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:30,813
No...

138
00:10:30,848 --> 00:10:32,315
alex...

139
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:33,683
i thought you
were going...

140
00:10:33,718 --> 00:10:34,934
look!

141
00:10:34,969 --> 00:10:38,688
The hardy boys
in secret of the caves.

142
00:10:38,723 --> 00:10:42,441
Bill bolton
in hidden dangers.

143
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:44,944
Tarzan and the antmen.

144
00:10:44,979 --> 00:10:48,698
Tarzan and the jewels of opar.

145
00:10:48,733 --> 00:10:50,583
Alex, please.

146
00:10:50,618 --> 00:10:52,451
Remember these?

147
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:56,205
Funny old things.

148
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:56,956
Alex...

149
00:10:56,991 --> 00:11:01,961
oh, and the stockings
that went with them.

150
00:11:01,996 --> 00:11:05,097
Stockings for a boy.

151
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:10,720
"It takes a real boy
to know a real stocking."

152
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:14,857
Funny i should
remember that.

153
00:11:14,892 --> 00:11:20,980
It's a quote from an ad
in a mail-order catalogue of...

154
00:11:22,865 --> 00:11:25,985
gosh, it must be 25 years ago.

155
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:30,990
I wonder why mother kept them.

156
00:11:31,025 --> 00:11:34,377
Because she would have liked
for you to stay

157
00:11:34,412 --> 00:11:36,245
exactly as you were
when you first wore them.

158
00:11:39,882 --> 00:11:41,133
I'm sorry, alex.

159
00:11:41,168 --> 00:11:43,002
I didn't mean that.

160
00:11:43,037 --> 00:11:44,887
You're not angry
with me, are you?

161
00:11:44,922 --> 00:11:46,138
No.

162
00:11:46,173 --> 00:11:49,008
It's just that i
want us to be happy.

163
00:11:49,043 --> 00:11:50,893
Alex, that's all
i've ever wanted.

164
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:01,020
Do you, uh...
want me to help?

165
00:12:01,055 --> 00:12:03,522
I can manage.

166
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:05,408
You aren't angry
with me, are you?

167
00:12:05,443 --> 00:12:06,909
No.

168
00:12:08,778 --> 00:12:10,663
I'll make you happy,
alex.

169
00:12:10,698 --> 00:12:11,914
You'll see.

170
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:13,783
You won't be sorry.

171
00:12:24,293 --> 00:12:26,178
Uh...

172
00:12:26,796 --> 00:12:28,681
i'll wait for mr.
Wilkinson downstairs.

173
00:12:28,716 --> 00:12:31,801
He should be here
any moment now.

174
00:12:49,819 --> 00:12:52,321
I don't want to sell the house.

175
00:12:52,356 --> 00:12:55,958
I don't want to sell it, mother.

176
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:47,593
Afternoon, mrs. Walker.

177
00:13:47,628 --> 00:13:49,461
Oh, mr. Wilkinson,
won't you come in?

178
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:51,964
Thank you
kindly, ma'am.

179
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:56,352
Oh, won't you go
in the living room?

180
00:13:56,387 --> 00:13:57,603
I'll get mr. Walker.

181
00:13:57,638 --> 00:13:59,471
Fine and dandy.

182
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:01,974
Alex. Alex, darling.

183
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,979
Mr. Wilkinson's here
with the papers.

184
00:14:07,014 --> 00:14:10,616
Uh, yes, of course.

185
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:21,877
Afternoon, mr. Walker.

186
00:14:21,912 --> 00:14:23,746
Congratulations
to you, sir.

187
00:14:23,781 --> 00:14:24,380
You have the papers?

188
00:14:24,415 --> 00:14:25,631
Right here, ma'am.

189
00:14:26,248 --> 00:14:27,499
Oh, but first, i wonder
if i could trouble you

190
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:28,751
for the use of
your telephone?

191
00:14:28,786 --> 00:14:30,636
You see, i forgot
to tell my secretary

192
00:14:30,671 --> 00:14:32,504
where i'd be,
and i'm expecting

193
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:34,390
a pretty important
call from out of town.

194
00:14:34,425 --> 00:14:35,641
I'll call her for you.

195
00:14:35,676 --> 00:14:37,509
Oh? Well, all right.

196
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:39,395
Well, in that case,
mr. Walker...

197
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:41,263
why don't you
use the dining
room table?

198
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:43,766
Fine and dandy.
After you, sir.

199
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:53,158
Make it as soon
as possible, darling.

200
00:14:53,193 --> 00:14:55,661
We really have to leave.

201
00:14:55,696 --> 00:14:56,912
Now, then...

202
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:01,533
as you can see right
here, mr. Walker...

203
00:15:13,929 --> 00:15:15,798
well, i think i'd
better do it myself.

204
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:17,049
I have to tell
my secretary

205
00:15:17,084 --> 00:15:18,300
some things anyway.

206
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:20,803
You sign right
here, mr. Walker.

207
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,069
Maggie? Jim.

208
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:39,071
I'm at henrietta
walker's house.

209
00:15:39,106 --> 00:15:41,573
Would you put that call
through to me here

210
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:44,710
if it comes in in the next ten
or 15 minutes or so?

211
00:15:44,745 --> 00:15:46,578
Fine, oh, and call
mr. Fisher

212
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:47,830
and tell him that escrow
has been approved

213
00:15:47,963 --> 00:15:50,466
for 60 days and we have
the form ready for him to sign.

214
00:15:50,501 --> 00:15:53,585
Right. Fine and dandy.

215
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,471
I'll see you,
maggie. Bye.

216
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:59,224
No, sir, we won't have
any trouble

217
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:01,093
selling this house
at all.

218
00:16:02,344 --> 00:16:04,847
There something
you don't understand,

219
00:16:04,882 --> 00:16:07,349
mr. Walker?

220
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:10,486
Uh, no, i, uh...
i think i'll wait.

221
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:13,355
Wait?

222
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,356
Yes, until
we return.

223
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:16,241
I want to
think about it.

224
00:16:16,276 --> 00:16:17,493
But darling...

225
00:16:17,528 --> 00:16:19,361
i just want to
think about it!

226
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:20,612
Alex.

227
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:22,498
I'm sorry
to cause you

228
00:16:22,533 --> 00:16:24,366
so much trouble,
mr. Wilkinson.

229
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:25,617
Sure, sure.

230
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:27,503
You're positive?

231
00:16:27,538 --> 00:16:29,371
I'm positive.

232
00:16:30,873 --> 00:16:32,124
Well, all right.

233
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:34,626
I'll get in touch with you
on your return.

234
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:35,878
Please.

235
00:16:35,913 --> 00:16:39,014
Well, have a nice honeymoon.

236
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:45,387
Oh, never mind,
miss lane...

237
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:47,272
mrs. Walker.

238
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:00,402
I'll pack.

239
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:03,539
Alex, alex,
you promised.

240
00:17:03,574 --> 00:17:04,156
What do you mean?

241
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:05,407
You know what i mean.

242
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:07,292
You promised to
sell this house.

243
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:09,161
Oh, i'm not
backing down, virg.

244
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:11,046
I just want a little time
to think about it.

245
00:17:11,081 --> 00:17:12,164
That's all.

246
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:14,049
What is there to think about?

247
00:17:14,084 --> 00:17:16,552
Well, i just don't like
the idea

248
00:17:16,587 --> 00:17:19,054
of people tramping
in and out...

249
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:20,923
that's just
an excuse.

250
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:22,174
That's not
the reason.

251
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:23,425
Oh, yes, it is, virg.

252
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:26,428
All right, never mind.

253
00:17:26,463 --> 00:17:28,931
Just pack,
and let's get out of here.

254
00:17:33,569 --> 00:17:34,820
What is it?

255
00:17:36,071 --> 00:17:37,322
Couldn't...

256
00:17:37,357 --> 00:17:40,442
i mean, couldn't we
live here, virg?

257
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:42,327
It's a pretty nice house...

258
00:17:42,362 --> 00:17:44,830
oh, alex, no!

259
00:17:44,865 --> 00:17:47,833
Don't just say no
without thinking about it.

260
00:17:47,868 --> 00:17:49,084
We could redecorate.

261
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:50,953
I want to get
out of here.

262
00:17:51,587 --> 00:17:54,089
I want to leave
right now.

263
00:17:54,124 --> 00:17:57,209
Alex, you promised me
when your mother died,

264
00:17:57,244 --> 00:17:59,711
you'd sell this house.

265
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:00,963
Well, she's dead.

266
00:18:00,998 --> 00:18:02,214
Alex, dead!

267
00:18:02,249 --> 00:18:04,716
She's been dead
for a year now,

268
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:07,603
and i waited that year
and all the years before-

269
00:18:07,638 --> 00:18:11,974
12 years, 12 long years
of waiting for you.

270
00:18:12,608 --> 00:18:14,476
Well, now, i want my own home.

271
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:16,979
I have a right to that.

272
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:21,867
Don't look at
me like that.

273
00:18:21,902 --> 00:18:26,238
Don't look at me
as if you don't even know me.

274
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,626
Alex, please.

275
00:18:30,661 --> 00:18:34,379
Please, don't do this
to me.

276
00:18:34,414 --> 00:18:36,248
I love you.

277
00:18:36,283 --> 00:18:38,750
I want to care for you
and make a home for you,

278
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:41,253
but our home, not hers.

279
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:43,755
We've waited
so long, darling.

280
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:44,389
How?

281
00:18:44,424 --> 00:18:46,258
I know, you told me
she was sick,

282
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:47,509
and we couldn't...

283
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:48,760
shewassick, virg.

284
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:50,646
She lost her health
taking care of me

285
00:18:50,681 --> 00:18:53,148
and this house for
more than 20 years.

286
00:18:53,183 --> 00:18:54,399
My father deserted us

287
00:18:54,434 --> 00:18:56,268
when i was two
months old, virg.

288
00:18:56,303 --> 00:18:57,519
Two months old!

289
00:18:57,554 --> 00:19:00,022
All right, all right.

290
00:19:00,057 --> 00:19:01,907
Let's go.

291
00:19:01,942 --> 00:19:03,775
Let's get out of here.

292
00:19:12,167 --> 00:19:14,036
Virg.

293
00:19:18,674 --> 00:19:21,793
I'm not going to sell
the house, virg.

294
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:22,427
We'll have it
redecorated,

295
00:19:22,462 --> 00:19:24,930
maybe get
some new furniture.

296
00:19:24,965 --> 00:19:27,432
We'll talk
about it later.

297
00:19:33,689 --> 00:19:37,442
No, alex. I won't let you.

298
00:19:53,575 --> 00:19:56,078
We'll get out of here.

299
00:19:57,963 --> 00:19:59,831
I'll get my purse.

300
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:26,491
I won't let you.

301
00:20:26,526 --> 00:20:27,743
I won't let you!

302
00:21:33,809 --> 00:21:36,311
Alex! Alex!

303
00:21:40,682 --> 00:21:44,436
No. No, you can't have him.

304
00:21:44,471 --> 00:21:48,190
I won't let you have him.

305
00:21:48,225 --> 00:21:50,075
He's mine now.

306
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:52,577
Mine!

307
00:21:53,195 --> 00:21:55,080
Yes, he is,

308
00:21:55,115 --> 00:21:57,949
because i'm
right for him.

309
00:21:57,984 --> 00:22:01,703
I won't try to destroy
him like you did.

310
00:22:01,738 --> 00:22:03,588
My love will
make him strong,

311
00:22:03,623 --> 00:22:07,342
not weak,
not dependent.

312
00:22:07,377 --> 00:22:09,961
Yes, it's true.

313
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:14,349
You've always known it's true,
and you hated me for it.

314
00:22:14,384 --> 00:22:18,103
Well, your hatred
isn't strong enough now.

315
00:22:18,138 --> 00:22:21,857
Your desire to dominate him
isn't strong enough.

316
00:22:21,892 --> 00:22:26,228
He's not your
little boy anymore.

317
00:22:26,263 --> 00:22:28,113
Leave him be.

318
00:22:28,148 --> 00:22:31,366
You will not have him back!

319
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:33,985
This is not my doing.

320
00:22:43,745 --> 00:22:46,248
Come back to me, mother.

321
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:48,750
I want you to.

322
00:23:00,262 --> 00:23:04,266
Alex... not you.

323
00:23:04,301 --> 00:23:06,151
Oh!

324
00:23:06,186 --> 00:23:09,154
Can we go to the park
and then to the zoo

325
00:23:09,189 --> 00:23:11,022
and have two
ice cream cones?

326
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:12,908
Oh, boy.

327
00:23:21,283 --> 00:23:23,418
Go away, lady.

328
00:23:23,453 --> 00:23:27,789
We don't need you anymore.

329
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:44,689
Exit miss virginia lane,

330
00:23:44,724 --> 00:23:49,060
formerly and most briefly
mrs. Alex walker.

331
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:53,448
She has just given up a battle
and in a strange way retreated,

332
00:23:54,065 --> 00:23:55,951
but this has been a retreat
back to reality.

333
00:23:55,986 --> 00:23:57,819
Her opponent, alex walker,

334
00:23:57,854 --> 00:24:01,573
will now and forever hold
a line that exists in the past.

335
00:24:01,608 --> 00:24:04,075
He has put a claim
on a moment in time

336
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,961
and is not about
to relinquish it.

337
00:24:05,996 --> 00:24:10,332
Such things do happen
in the twilight zone.

338
00:24:17,506 --> 00:24:20,642
Rod serling,
creator ofthe twilight zone,

339
00:24:20,677 --> 00:24:22,511
will tell you
about next week's story

340
00:24:22,546 --> 00:24:24,396
after this message.

341
00:24:24,431 --> 00:24:27,149
And now, mr. Serling.

342
00:24:27,184 --> 00:24:29,651
The name "ray bradbury"
has become synonymous

343
00:24:29,686 --> 00:24:32,154
with a new horizon
of american writing.

344
00:24:32,189 --> 00:24:33,405
Next week onthe twilight zone,

345
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,907
we present
a typical bradbury tale.

346
00:24:35,942 --> 00:24:37,776
It also has
typical bradbury ingredients,

347
00:24:37,811 --> 00:24:40,278
including a grandmother
built in a factory.

348
00:24:40,313 --> 00:24:41,530
Now, if this
doesn't intrigue you,

349
00:24:41,565 --> 00:24:43,415
then i'm simply
not doing justice

350
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:44,666
to a most intriguing tale.

351
00:24:44,701 --> 00:24:49,037
I hope you'll join us next week
for "i sing the body electric."

352
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:20,702
This is james arness.

353
00:25:20,737 --> 00:25:22,571
You know, it's only a short hop

354
00:25:22,606 --> 00:25:25,707
fromthe twilight zone
to dodge city ingunsmoke.

355
00:25:25,742 --> 00:25:28,210
Saturday nights
over most of these stations.
