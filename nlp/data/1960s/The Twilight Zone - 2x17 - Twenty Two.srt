1
00:00:11,046 --> 00:00:13,513
You're traveling
through another dimension

2
00:00:13,548 --> 00:00:16,516
a dimension not only
of sight and sound, but of mind

3
00:00:16,551 --> 00:00:18,518
a journey into a wondrous land

4
00:00:18,553 --> 00:00:21,021
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

5
00:00:21,056 --> 00:00:22,522
That's the signpost up ahead.

6
00:00:22,557 --> 00:00:24,524
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

7
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:53,933
Room for one more, honey.

8
00:04:00,275 --> 00:04:01,741
This is miss liz powell.

9
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,245
She's a professional dancer
and she's in the hospital

10
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,248
as a result of overwork
and nervous fatigue

11
00:04:08,283 --> 00:04:10,750
and at this moment,
we have just finished

12
00:04:10,785 --> 00:04:12,752
walking with her
in a nightmare.

13
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:16,756
In a moment, she'll wake up
and we'll remain at her side.

14
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:18,258
The problem here is

15
00:04:18,293 --> 00:04:21,261
that both miss powell and you
will reach a point

16
00:04:21,296 --> 00:04:23,263
where it might be difficult
to decide

17
00:04:23,298 --> 00:04:25,765
which is reality
and which is nightmare:

18
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,767
A problem uncommon perhaps

19
00:04:27,802 --> 00:04:31,771
but rather peculiar
to the twilight zone.

20
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:01,601
Hiya, kitten.

21
00:05:01,636 --> 00:05:03,603
You lose your
way, barney?

22
00:05:03,638 --> 00:05:05,605
Hey, you're looking
great, kitten.

23
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,607
You're looking
just great.

24
00:05:07,642 --> 00:05:10,610
It's been a long
time between talks.

25
00:05:10,645 --> 00:05:12,612
Look what i
brought you, honey.

26
00:05:12,647 --> 00:05:14,113
I had it blown up.

27
00:05:14,148 --> 00:05:16,115
Why, we'll get it
blown up real big

28
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,618
and we'll put it in
front of the chl-chi

29
00:05:18,653 --> 00:05:20,119
when you open there.

30
00:05:20,154 --> 00:05:21,621
Where you been, barney?

31
00:05:21,656 --> 00:05:22,622
Well, i...

32
00:05:22,657 --> 00:05:25,124
you know how i feel
about hospitals, kitten-

33
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:26,626
they kind of depress me.

34
00:05:26,661 --> 00:05:28,628
You ought to try
it in here

35
00:05:28,663 --> 00:05:29,629
lying on your back

36
00:05:29,664 --> 00:05:31,631
for couple
of weeks, barney.

37
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:35,335
Pretty soon you feel like
you're lying on a glass slide

38
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:39,339
and all those creeps are looking
at you through a microscope

39
00:05:39,374 --> 00:05:43,343
and the only time the sun shines
is when it's visiting hours.

40
00:05:43,378 --> 00:05:46,846
Gee, kitten, what a mind
you've got- what a mind.

41
00:05:46,881 --> 00:05:49,849
That's what bugs you, isn't it,
barney?

42
00:05:49,884 --> 00:05:50,850
My mind.

43
00:05:50,885 --> 00:05:54,354
You think i left it in a bus
station someplace, don't you?

44
00:05:54,389 --> 00:05:56,356
Well, if you keep on talking
nutsy like this

45
00:05:56,391 --> 00:05:58,858
i got to think
there's something wrong, kitten.

46
00:05:58,893 --> 00:06:00,860
Barney, you got
to believe me.

47
00:06:00,895 --> 00:06:02,161
You're the only one.

48
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:04,163
You're really
the only one

49
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:05,665
i thought would
believe me.

50
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,667
When you didn't
show up...

51
00:06:07,702 --> 00:06:09,168
when you didn't
even call

52
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:12,171
i got this wild idea
that you'd given me up

53
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:15,174
that you figured i was
some kind of a cuckoo

54
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:17,377
who'd left
the world behind.

55
00:06:17,412 --> 00:06:18,378
Oh, no.

56
00:06:18,413 --> 00:06:20,880
But barney, you
got to believe me.

57
00:06:20,915 --> 00:06:22,382
You're the only one.

58
00:06:22,417 --> 00:06:23,883
They aren't dreams.

59
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:27,387
They happen- just
like i say they happen.

60
00:06:27,422 --> 00:06:30,390
I know, kitten,
i know.

61
00:06:30,425 --> 00:06:32,392
Barney, don't.

62
00:06:32,427 --> 00:06:34,894
Don't write me
off, will you?

63
00:06:34,929 --> 00:06:36,396
You got
to believe me.

64
00:06:37,932 --> 00:06:39,399
Well, good
afternoon.

65
00:06:39,434 --> 00:06:41,401
Oh, i was just
leaving, doc.

66
00:06:41,436 --> 00:06:43,403
No need- i'll
just be a moment.

67
00:06:43,438 --> 00:06:45,905
Well, miss powell, you're
looking as beautiful as ever.

68
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,407
I was just
telling her

69
00:06:47,442 --> 00:06:48,908
the same thing
myself.

70
00:06:48,943 --> 00:06:50,910
I'm barney kavener,
liz's agent.

71
00:06:50,945 --> 00:06:52,912
How do you do?

72
00:06:52,947 --> 00:06:54,414
You make
an old doctor

73
00:06:54,449 --> 00:06:56,416
wish he were
a young intern.

74
00:06:57,952 --> 00:07:00,420
You make me wish
the same thing.

75
00:07:00,455 --> 00:07:01,921
You must be
great

76
00:07:01,956 --> 00:07:03,923
at funerals,
laughing boy.

77
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:06,426
We're a little feisty
today, aren't we?

78
00:07:06,461 --> 00:07:08,428
We are not feisty.

79
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:10,029
We are just a little tired

80
00:07:10,064 --> 00:07:13,032
of ten people an hour
walking around our bed

81
00:07:13,067 --> 00:07:16,035
like we were some kind
of a freak or something.

82
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:18,538
Why don't you guys
get off the dime?

83
00:07:18,573 --> 00:07:20,540
There's nothing
wrong with me.

84
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:22,542
There most assuredly
isn't, miss powell.

85
00:07:22,577 --> 00:07:25,545
That's what we've been
trying to tell you.

86
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:28,047
You're in excellent
physical condition

87
00:07:28,082 --> 00:07:30,249
a little overtired,
that's all

88
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:32,351
a little overworked,
perhaps.

89
00:07:32,386 --> 00:07:33,853
I guess
a dancer's life

90
00:07:33,888 --> 00:07:35,354
isn't the easiest,
is it?

91
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:38,357
Well, talent like this makes it
look easy, doc.

92
00:07:38,392 --> 00:07:40,860
I've been this little lady's
agent for 12 years

93
00:07:40,895 --> 00:07:43,362
and i'm here to tell you
that she's the best

94
00:07:43,397 --> 00:07:44,864
little stripper...
dancer.

95
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:46,365
...dancer
that ever came

96
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,366
down the pike.

97
00:07:49,403 --> 00:07:51,370
Just listen to him
laugh, barney.

98
00:07:51,405 --> 00:07:53,372
Boy, he's great
for your morale.

99
00:07:53,407 --> 00:07:56,375
Well, doc, what's it
going to be tonight?

100
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:59,378
A big discussion
about freud and dreams?

101
00:07:59,413 --> 00:08:02,381
You don't seem interested
in dreams, miss powell.

102
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:04,383
In this story, you recount

103
00:08:04,418 --> 00:08:07,386
you keep rejecting the
fact that itisa dream.

104
00:08:07,421 --> 00:08:09,388
You know it.

105
00:08:09,423 --> 00:08:12,391
As a matter of fact,
i don't know it.

106
00:08:12,426 --> 00:08:14,393
I know quite the reverse.

107
00:08:14,428 --> 00:08:16,395
I say it is a dream.

108
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:20,900
Now, let's run through it again.

109
00:08:25,404 --> 00:08:29,909
You say it always happens
in perfect chronology.

110
00:08:29,944 --> 00:08:31,911
You wake up.

111
00:08:31,946 --> 00:08:33,913
You feel thirsty.

112
00:08:33,948 --> 00:08:36,415
You reach for the glass.

113
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:39,418
You hear the clock
ticking loudly.

114
00:08:39,453 --> 00:08:42,421
Very loudly.

115
00:08:42,456 --> 00:08:43,923
It unnerves you.

116
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:48,227
The glass slips out of your hand
and breaks on the floor.

117
00:08:48,262 --> 00:08:49,228
And then i hear

118
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:51,230
the footsteps
outside.

119
00:08:51,265 --> 00:08:52,932
Footsteps?

120
00:08:52,967 --> 00:08:54,433
Whose footsteps?

121
00:08:54,468 --> 00:08:56,335
Miss powell seems to feel

122
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,337
they're the footsteps
of a nurse.

123
00:08:58,372 --> 00:09:00,640
They are the footsteps
of a nurse.

124
00:09:00,675 --> 00:09:03,142
I hear them.

125
00:09:03,177 --> 00:09:06,646
They come down the corridor
and stop outside my door.

126
00:09:06,681 --> 00:09:07,647
I jump out of bed.

127
00:09:07,682 --> 00:09:09,148
Now, miss
powell...

128
00:09:09,183 --> 00:09:13,152
i open the door and i see this
nurse going into an elevator.

129
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:15,154
I follow her.

130
00:09:15,189 --> 00:09:18,658
The elevator goes down
to the basement floor.

131
00:09:18,693 --> 00:09:22,662
Down at the end of the hall
room 22.

132
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:25,264
What kind of room?

133
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:26,766
It's the
hospital morgue

134
00:09:26,801 --> 00:09:27,767
mr. Kavener.

135
00:09:27,802 --> 00:09:29,268
Miss powell
seems to feel

136
00:09:29,303 --> 00:09:31,270
the nurse comes
out of the morgue

137
00:09:31,305 --> 00:09:33,773
looks straight at
her and says...

138
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,878
"room for one more, honey."

139
00:09:38,913 --> 00:09:40,680
That's what
she says, barney

140
00:09:40,715 --> 00:09:42,181
"room for one more"

141
00:09:42,216 --> 00:09:44,684
and then she points
to that room-

142
00:09:44,719 --> 00:09:47,186
that room where
all the stiffs are.

143
00:09:47,221 --> 00:09:50,189
Odd dream, wouldn't
you say, mr. Kavener?

144
00:09:50,224 --> 00:09:51,691
That's a
weirdo, doc.

145
00:09:51,726 --> 00:09:53,192
That's a very
weird dream.

146
00:09:53,227 --> 00:09:54,694
It isn't a dream.

147
00:09:54,729 --> 00:09:57,697
Miss powell claims
it's one of our nurses

148
00:09:57,732 --> 00:09:59,699
assigned to
the basement floor.

149
00:09:59,734 --> 00:10:00,700
How should i know

150
00:10:00,735 --> 00:10:03,202
if it's one of
your nurses or not?

151
00:10:03,237 --> 00:10:06,706
All i know is this dame
comes out of that room

152
00:10:06,741 --> 00:10:08,207
looks at me and says

153
00:10:08,242 --> 00:10:09,709
"room for
one more, honey."

154
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:11,711
You bring her in here.

155
00:10:11,746 --> 00:10:12,712
I'll point her out.

156
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:14,714
Boy, will i
point her out.

157
00:10:14,749 --> 00:10:17,717
I know her face as
well as i do my own.

158
00:10:17,752 --> 00:10:20,219
Very well.

159
00:10:20,254 --> 00:10:22,221
Let's see.

160
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,232
This is
miss jameson.

161
00:10:33,267 --> 00:10:34,734
She's the
night nurse

162
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:37,737
assigned to the
basement floor-

163
00:10:37,772 --> 00:10:38,738
the only nurse

164
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:41,240
i might add,
miss powell.

165
00:10:41,275 --> 00:10:42,241
Look at her.

166
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:45,544
Well, miss powell?

167
00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:49,148
Is this
your phantom lady?

168
00:10:49,183 --> 00:10:51,150
No, this woman is tall

169
00:10:51,185 --> 00:10:52,652
and she's got

170
00:10:52,687 --> 00:10:55,154
this crazy
kind of a smile

171
00:10:55,189 --> 00:10:56,155
on her face.

172
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,657
That will be
all, thank you.

173
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,664
Well, miss powell,
it obviously is a dream.

174
00:11:04,699 --> 00:11:07,166
If it were a nurse
in our hospital

175
00:11:07,201 --> 00:11:10,169
it would have
to be that young lady

176
00:11:10,204 --> 00:11:11,671
and since it is not

177
00:11:11,706 --> 00:11:14,674
you'll have to admit
it's very unlikely

178
00:11:14,709 --> 00:11:16,175
that the woman
you saw

179
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:18,678
could have come
out of the morgue.

180
00:11:18,713 --> 00:11:20,680
I know what i saw.

181
00:11:20,715 --> 00:11:22,682
I know what i did.

182
00:11:22,717 --> 00:11:25,184
I'll tell you what,
miss powell

183
00:11:25,219 --> 00:11:26,185
to prove my point

184
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,688
let's try
something different.

185
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,691
Like what?

186
00:11:31,726 --> 00:11:33,693
You say
it always happens

187
00:11:33,728 --> 00:11:35,695
in such
pure chronology-

188
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:39,699
that your actions
are always the same.

189
00:11:39,734 --> 00:11:41,801
Tonight when
you're dreaming

190
00:11:41,836 --> 00:11:45,304
or as you say,
when you're waking up

191
00:11:45,339 --> 00:11:47,306
don't reach
for the glass.

192
00:11:47,341 --> 00:11:50,309
See if breaking
the routine of it

193
00:11:50,344 --> 00:11:52,812
won't stop it
from happening.

194
00:11:52,847 --> 00:11:54,814
Now, that
sounds

195
00:11:54,849 --> 00:11:56,315
like a groovy
idea, doc.

196
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,317
Why don't you try it, kitten, huh?

197
00:11:58,352 --> 00:11:59,819
Why don't
you try it?

198
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:01,821
Barney, will
you tell him?

199
00:12:01,856 --> 00:12:03,823
When the same thing
happens to you

200
00:12:03,858 --> 00:12:05,324
for six nights
in a row!

201
00:12:05,359 --> 00:12:07,827
Overwork, fatigue,
tiredness...

202
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:10,329
a nightmare
at this point

203
00:12:10,364 --> 00:12:12,832
would not be abnormal,
mr. Kavener.

204
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:16,836
A nightmare in this case
would be the norm.

205
00:12:16,871 --> 00:12:18,337
Well, miss powell

206
00:12:18,372 --> 00:12:21,841
let's see what
this evening brings

207
00:12:21,876 --> 00:12:23,843
shall we?

208
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:25,845
Yeah, well, i...

209
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,546
i got to be running
along, kitten.

210
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:29,048
Now, you stay hip

211
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:31,050
to what the doc here
is telling you.

212
00:12:31,085 --> 00:12:33,052
I'm sure glad to
see you feeling...

213
00:12:33,087 --> 00:12:34,553
looking
so good again.

214
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:36,055
Thanks a heap,
barney.

215
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:39,058
You know, you
couldn't boost morale

216
00:12:39,093 --> 00:12:42,061
if it weighed
a quarter of a pound

217
00:12:42,096 --> 00:12:43,562
and you had a derrick.

218
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:45,564
Thanks for coming over.

219
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:47,566
You must do it
again sometime

220
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:50,069
only make it next
year, will you?

221
00:12:50,104 --> 00:12:51,570
Oh, kitten,
baby.

222
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:53,572
Get out, will you,
barney?

223
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:58,077
Sure, liz...
sure.

224
00:13:14,593 --> 00:13:17,696
Remember about tonight,
miss powell.

225
00:13:17,731 --> 00:13:22,701
When you feel a compulsion
to repeat the nightmare...

226
00:13:22,736 --> 00:13:25,704
don't do it.

227
00:13:25,739 --> 00:13:28,207
Now, relax.

228
00:13:28,242 --> 00:13:30,709
Get to sleep.

229
00:13:30,744 --> 00:13:35,714
I think we're on our way
to recovery.

230
00:13:35,749 --> 00:13:40,920
We're just delighted
that we feel that way.

231
00:16:57,816 --> 00:16:58,817
Room for one more, honey.

232
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:28,347
Don't leave her
until she's asleep.

233
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:45,364
Well, i think
she'll sleep now.

234
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:46,365
Good.

235
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:48,867
That's odd.

236
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:51,870
Now, that's
really odd.

237
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:53,872
What is, doctor?

238
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:56,375
This afternoon when
i was talking to her

239
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:59,378
she was telling me
about this... this dream.

240
00:17:59,413 --> 00:18:00,379
What about it?

241
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:03,382
Following someone
down the corridor

242
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:05,384
getting into
the elevator

243
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:07,886
going down
to the morgue.

244
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:08,887
Morgue?

245
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:10,389
Yes.

246
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:12,891
She's never been
there before.

247
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:14,893
Patients aren't
allowed there.

248
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:17,396
And yet,
when she tells me the story

249
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:18,897
she mentions room 22.

250
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:20,899
Room 22?

251
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,402
Well, if she'd
never been there

252
00:18:23,437 --> 00:18:25,404
how would
she know?

253
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:27,406
How would she?

254
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:43,422
Everything packed?

255
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:44,423
That does it.

256
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:46,925
Your agent is here. He said
to phone down to the lobby

257
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,926
when you're ready.

258
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:50,429
He'll meet you
at the elevator.

259
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:51,430
My cup runneth over.

260
00:18:51,465 --> 00:18:53,932
Is there a back
door to this place?

261
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:56,935
Well, he seems like
quite a devoted man.

262
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:57,936
Oh, he's devoted-

263
00:18:57,971 --> 00:18:59,438
to ten percent
commission

264
00:18:59,473 --> 00:19:01,440
and 12 hours'
sleep every night.

265
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:04,443
Well, are we ready to leave?

266
00:19:04,478 --> 00:19:06,445
All ready,
doctor.

267
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,447
Ready and overdue.

268
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:10,449
Let me take that
for you.

269
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:14,453
Send me a postcard from
miami beach, will you?

270
00:19:14,488 --> 00:19:16,355
Sure.

271
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:18,357
Miss powell...

272
00:19:18,392 --> 00:19:21,059
theyweredreams.

273
00:19:21,094 --> 00:19:23,061
Just a part of your fatigue.

274
00:19:23,096 --> 00:19:24,863
You were susceptible
to nerves.

275
00:19:24,898 --> 00:19:27,366
That's what happens
when a mind is overwrought.

276
00:19:27,401 --> 00:19:28,867
It plays tricks.

277
00:19:28,902 --> 00:19:32,471
I don't want to see you back
here again, miss powell.

278
00:19:32,506 --> 00:19:35,474
The next time i see you,
i'll be at a ringside table

279
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:39,978
and i'd appreciate, uh...
a subtle wink.

280
00:19:41,715 --> 00:19:44,483
Miss powell?

281
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:47,786
Yeah. Yeah, i'm ready.

282
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:58,797
You're all set,
miss powell.

283
00:19:58,832 --> 00:20:00,799
That's the nonstop to miami

284
00:20:00,834 --> 00:20:03,802
departing from area c
in approximately five minutes.

285
00:20:03,837 --> 00:20:06,705
Your seat assignment's
on the envelope there.

286
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,207
Thank you very much.

287
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,209
Did anyone
ever tell you

288
00:20:10,244 --> 00:20:12,211
that you have eyes
like a tarantula?

289
00:20:12,246 --> 00:20:13,712
Oh, i'm sorry, miss.

290
00:20:13,747 --> 00:20:14,713
I didn't mean to stare.

291
00:20:14,748 --> 00:20:15,714
Forget it.

292
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,216
Is that area c out there?

293
00:20:17,251 --> 00:20:18,217
Yes, ma'am.

294
00:20:18,252 --> 00:20:19,718
Flight 22
is loading now

295
00:20:19,753 --> 00:20:21,220
and you can get
aboard anytime.

296
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,323
Uh...

297
00:20:24,358 --> 00:20:26,325
is there anything
wrong, miss powell?

298
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,626
What flight?

299
00:20:27,661 --> 00:20:29,628
22-
nonstop to miami

300
00:20:29,663 --> 00:20:31,630
right out through
that door-

301
00:20:31,665 --> 00:20:33,131
you can board now.

302
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:35,133
Thank you.

303
00:20:35,168 --> 00:20:36,635
Thank you very much.

304
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:39,037
Passenger porter, please report

305
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:41,540
to ticket confirmation desk
immediately.

306
00:20:41,575 --> 00:20:44,042
Passenger porter, please report

307
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:46,545
to ticket confirmation desk
immediately.

308
00:20:50,684 --> 00:20:54,152
It's that... that crazy feeling.

309
00:20:54,187 --> 00:20:55,654
I'm thirsty.

310
00:20:55,689 --> 00:21:00,659
I'm thirsty but...
but i'm awake.

311
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:05,163
It's that same feeling
but i'm awake.

312
00:21:05,198 --> 00:21:07,165
This isn't a dream.

313
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,667
This couldn't be a dream.

314
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:33,992
I think
you'd better

315
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:35,994
hurry up a
little, miss.

316
00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:36,995
That's your flight

317
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,997
ready for departure
out there.

318
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:46,465
Room for one more, honey.

319
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:26,304
This couldn't be a dream.

320
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:29,808
It's not a dream.

321
00:23:29,843 --> 00:23:32,811
It just couldn't be- not now.

322
00:23:33,311 --> 00:23:34,813
It just couldn't be.

323
00:23:43,256 --> 00:23:47,726
Miss elizabeth powell,
professional dancer.

324
00:23:47,761 --> 00:23:48,727
Hospital diagnosis:

325
00:23:48,762 --> 00:23:52,731
Acute anxiety brought on
by overwork and fatigue.

326
00:23:52,766 --> 00:23:56,735
With rest and care,
she'll probably recover

327
00:23:56,770 --> 00:24:00,238
but the cure to some nightmares
is not to be found

328
00:24:00,273 --> 00:24:02,240
in known medical journals.

329
00:24:02,275 --> 00:24:05,744
You look for it
under "potions for bad dreams"

330
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:08,246
to be found
in the twilight zone.

331
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:13,251
Rod serling, creator
ofthe twilight zone

332
00:24:13,286 --> 00:24:15,253
will tell you
about next week's story

333
00:24:15,288 --> 00:24:17,255
after this word
from our alternate sponsor.

334
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:20,725
And now, mr. Serling.

335
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,594
Next week you'll find
each of your names

336
00:24:22,629 --> 00:24:25,096
on the passenger manifest
of this jet aircraft

337
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:26,982
that travels from london
to new york city.

338
00:24:27,017 --> 00:24:28,233
You'll sit in these seats

339
00:24:28,268 --> 00:24:30,735
and you'll go through an
experience unique beyond words

340
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:33,238
and tense beyond anything
i believe you've ever seen.

341
00:24:33,273 --> 00:24:35,740
You'll be departing next week
at about this time

342
00:24:35,775 --> 00:24:38,860
in a vehicle we call
"the odyssey of flight 33."

343
00:24:38,895 --> 00:24:42,614
But prepared for a stop midway
in the twilight zone.
