1
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:10,643
You unlock this door
with the key of imagination.

2
00:00:10,678 --> 00:00:13,029
Beyond it is another dimension-

3
00:00:13,064 --> 00:00:15,031
a dimension of sound,

4
00:00:15,066 --> 00:00:16,900
a dimension of sight,

5
00:00:17,534 --> 00:00:19,402
a dimension of mind.

6
00:00:19,437 --> 00:00:21,905
You're moving into a land
of both shadow and substance,

7
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,790
of things and ideas.

8
00:00:23,825 --> 00:00:28,161
You've just crossed over
into the twilight zone.

9
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:40,056
And here we have

10
00:00:40,091 --> 00:00:42,559
the famous temptress
from ancient egypt-

11
00:00:42,594 --> 00:00:46,312
cleopatra.

12
00:00:46,347 --> 00:00:49,432
Her captivating beauty
almost brought about

13
00:00:49,467 --> 00:00:53,186
the destruction of
caesar and mark anthony.

14
00:00:53,221 --> 00:00:55,688
If you will follow me...

15
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:04,447
and now our next group.

16
00:01:05,081 --> 00:01:08,334
Ourpiece de resistance,
if i may say so.

17
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:09,586
Here you will find

18
00:01:09,621 --> 00:01:12,705
the most infamous, black-hearted
killers of all time.

19
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,842
It is not for the faint-hearted.

20
00:01:15,877 --> 00:01:18,962
So... if there are any

21
00:01:18,997 --> 00:01:20,213
who would prefer
to remain behind...

22
00:01:20,248 --> 00:01:22,098
no?

23
00:01:22,133 --> 00:01:23,967
Very well, then.

24
00:01:38,149 --> 00:01:39,365
Oh.

25
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,617
Did i startle you?

26
00:01:40,652 --> 00:01:43,119
This is martin senescu-

27
00:01:43,154 --> 00:01:44,988
curator of
murderers' row.

28
00:01:45,023 --> 00:01:46,873
You all
right, honey?

29
00:01:46,908 --> 00:01:49,375
Sure, it's just
they're so real.

30
00:01:49,993 --> 00:01:50,627
And i, i thought...

31
00:01:50,662 --> 00:01:51,878
there's nothing
to be afraid of.

32
00:01:51,913 --> 00:01:53,129
They're just
a lot of wax.

33
00:01:53,164 --> 00:01:54,998
Perhaps not,
young man.

34
00:01:55,033 --> 00:01:56,883
Who knows
what evil lurks

35
00:01:56,918 --> 00:01:57,500
in the heart
of the man

36
00:01:57,535 --> 00:01:59,385
standing next to you?

37
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:03,756
This is albert w. Hicks,

38
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:06,893
a mate on the oyster smack
v. A. Johnson.

39
00:02:06,928 --> 00:02:08,511
A gentle man.

40
00:02:08,546 --> 00:02:13,399
Yet one day in 1860
off the atlantic coast,

41
00:02:13,434 --> 00:02:15,268
he murdered his entire crew.

42
00:02:15,303 --> 00:02:18,154
Killed them with an ax
exactly like this one.

43
00:02:18,189 --> 00:02:20,023
Why did he go mad?

44
00:02:20,058 --> 00:02:21,908
What made him change?

45
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:29,782
And here... here we have
burke and hare,

46
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:33,036
the monsters
of their time.

47
00:02:33,071 --> 00:02:35,421
But do they look
like monsters?

48
00:02:35,456 --> 00:02:39,042
This is how they suffocated
their victims.

49
00:02:39,077 --> 00:02:41,544
It was called... burking.

50
00:02:42,178 --> 00:02:44,180
Think of the agonies
they endured.

51
00:02:44,797 --> 00:02:46,683
Which one's he
talking about?

52
00:02:46,718 --> 00:02:48,551
Oh, sir,
all of them.

53
00:02:48,586 --> 00:02:49,185
All of them.

54
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:52,939
Surely, it is horrible
to be murdered,

55
00:02:52,974 --> 00:02:54,807
as our victim here
could tell you

56
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:56,693
if-if she could talk.

57
00:02:56,728 --> 00:02:59,195
But to murder!

58
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:01,698
To take a life with your hands

59
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:06,069
again and again...

60
00:03:06,104 --> 00:03:09,205
and not be able to stop oneself.

61
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:13,576
Can you begin
to imagine the horror of that?

62
00:03:13,611 --> 00:03:15,712
No.

63
00:03:15,747 --> 00:03:16,963
Tell us
about it.

64
00:03:16,998 --> 00:03:20,083
Well,
i cannot.

65
00:03:20,118 --> 00:03:21,968
But somewhere
in the world

66
00:03:22,003 --> 00:03:25,088
now, at this
very moment...

67
00:03:25,123 --> 00:03:27,590
there is
someone who can.

68
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:29,475
Yeah?
Who?

69
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:33,229
Well, no one
knows yet,

70
00:03:33,264 --> 00:03:36,733
but if his torment is
great enough

71
00:03:36,768 --> 00:03:39,852
and he kills
as these poor creatures did,

72
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:43,606
then future generations
will know.

73
00:03:43,641 --> 00:03:46,743
For he'll be here...

74
00:03:46,778 --> 00:03:50,496
immortalized in wax.

75
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:52,999
Remembered...

76
00:03:53,034 --> 00:03:56,119
as you and i will never be.

77
00:03:57,754 --> 00:04:00,873
This... is henri

78
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:04,010
desire landru.

79
00:04:04,045 --> 00:04:06,379
One can see
the agony

80
00:04:06,414 --> 00:04:07,630
that he, too,
must have felt

81
00:04:07,665 --> 00:04:10,133
as he was driven
to strangle the life

82
00:04:10,168 --> 00:04:14,520
from disappointed spinsters
and lonely widows.

83
00:04:14,555 --> 00:04:18,274
Landru was a master
of the garrote.

84
00:04:18,309 --> 00:04:20,777
And he used a waxed cord

85
00:04:20,812 --> 00:04:25,031
identical to the one
he holds there.

86
00:04:25,066 --> 00:04:28,151
Get away from there!

87
00:04:28,186 --> 00:04:30,036
Those figures are not
to be touched.

88
00:04:30,071 --> 00:04:31,904
They're too rare
and valuable.

89
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:33,790
Besides...

90
00:04:33,825 --> 00:04:36,292
the museum can't be
held responsible

91
00:04:36,327 --> 00:04:38,795
for what might
happen to you.

92
00:04:41,914 --> 00:04:44,917
Now, here we have
another soul in torment.

93
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:47,420
Jack the ripper.

94
00:04:47,455 --> 00:04:48,304
Who was he?

95
00:04:48,339 --> 00:04:52,058
And which- of
all the faces

96
00:04:52,093 --> 00:04:57,063
that moved about london's
whitechapel district-

97
00:04:57,098 --> 00:04:58,314
which one was his?

98
00:04:58,349 --> 00:05:01,317
And why did he
feel driven

99
00:05:01,352 --> 00:05:03,186
to kill those
pathetic drabs

100
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,071
with one sweep

101
00:05:05,106 --> 00:05:08,191
of the knife
you see here?

102
00:05:09,826 --> 00:05:12,328
I'm afraid we shall never know.

103
00:05:12,363 --> 00:05:15,448
And as we look at hicks,

104
00:05:15,483 --> 00:05:17,950
burke and hare,

105
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:19,836
landru

106
00:05:19,871 --> 00:05:22,338
and jack the ripper

107
00:05:22,373 --> 00:05:24,841
we see men,
as you and me.

108
00:05:24,876 --> 00:05:27,210
And we can only guess

109
00:05:27,245 --> 00:05:30,963
what devils pushed them
to their bloody fate.

110
00:05:32,715 --> 00:05:33,966
Thank you.

111
00:05:40,723 --> 00:05:44,610
Boy, let's blow
this creepy joint.

112
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:51,484
Martin lombard senescu,
a gentle man,

113
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:54,620
the dedicated curator
of murderers' row

114
00:05:54,655 --> 00:05:56,489
in ferguson's wax museum.

115
00:05:56,524 --> 00:05:59,625
He ponders the reasons
why ordinary men are driven

116
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,494
to commit mass murder.

117
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:04,630
What mr. Senescu does not know
is that the groundwork

118
00:06:04,665 --> 00:06:05,882
has already been laid

119
00:06:05,917 --> 00:06:07,750
for his own special kind
of madness and torment-

120
00:06:08,384 --> 00:06:11,504
found only in the twilight zone.

121
00:06:41,417 --> 00:06:42,668
Martin?

122
00:06:42,703 --> 00:06:43,419
Yes.

123
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:46,038
I'd like to talk with you.

124
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:46,923
Oh, well,

125
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:49,425
i'll be through
in a moment.

126
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,294
That
can wait.

127
00:06:51,329 --> 00:06:53,296
What i have to say
is rather important.

128
00:06:53,331 --> 00:06:55,798
All right.

129
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:58,301
You know,
mr. Ferguson,

130
00:06:58,336 --> 00:07:00,186
landru needs
a new suit.

131
00:07:00,221 --> 00:07:01,437
This one is
ten years old,

132
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:03,439
and it shows it.

133
00:07:03,474 --> 00:07:04,557
Is something wrong?

134
00:07:04,592 --> 00:07:06,442
Well, yes and no.

135
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:11,447
I think we'd better discuss it
in the office.

136
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:32,969
Is it something
i've done?

137
00:07:33,004 --> 00:07:34,220
Or haven't done?

138
00:07:34,255 --> 00:07:36,722
No, nothing
like that.

139
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:40,476
Uh, sit down,
martin.

140
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:47,850
Martin,

141
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:50,353
i'm abandoning
the museum.

142
00:07:50,388 --> 00:07:51,604
Hmm?

143
00:07:53,489 --> 00:07:54,740
Abandoning?

144
00:07:54,775 --> 00:07:55,992
I'm afraid so.

145
00:07:56,027 --> 00:07:57,860
Oh.

146
00:07:57,895 --> 00:07:59,745
Is this a joke, sir?

147
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:00,997
No.

148
00:08:01,032 --> 00:08:02,865
Oh, mr. Ferguson.

149
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:06,002
You can't do that.

150
00:08:06,037 --> 00:08:07,253
You mustn't.

151
00:08:07,288 --> 00:08:09,005
Uh, i know
how you feel,

152
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:10,256
martin,
believe me, i do.

153
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:13,376
But... i'm afraid

154
00:08:13,411 --> 00:08:14,627
there isn't
any choice.

155
00:08:14,662 --> 00:08:16,512
I don't understand.

156
00:08:16,547 --> 00:08:19,015
I've been offered

157
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:20,883
a large sum
for this property.

158
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:22,885
Some people want to build

159
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,387
a supermarket
here.

160
00:08:24,422 --> 00:08:26,889
A supermarket?

161
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:28,274
Here, let me get you a drink.

162
00:08:28,309 --> 00:08:29,525
It'll help settle you.

163
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,279
No, no, no. No.
Please, i don't...

164
00:08:39,535 --> 00:08:43,906
when i first opened the
museum 30 years ago,

165
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:47,293
i never dreamed
i'd see this day.

166
00:08:47,328 --> 00:08:50,413
But the day is
here, martin.

167
00:08:50,448 --> 00:08:53,549
And we will just
have to face it.

168
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,921
30 years.

169
00:08:58,956 --> 00:09:01,424
We've been together
a long time.

170
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:03,309
I know.

171
00:09:03,344 --> 00:09:08,314
You're the best employee
a man could ever have.

172
00:09:08,349 --> 00:09:12,068
The way you've run the
murderers' row exhibit-

173
00:09:12,103 --> 00:09:15,187
why, i don't think you
ever missed a tour.

174
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:17,323
No, no.
Oh!

175
00:09:17,358 --> 00:09:19,191
I never did, never.

176
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:22,578
How many more days?

177
00:09:25,081 --> 00:09:26,332
None.

178
00:09:26,367 --> 00:09:28,200
This was the last.

179
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:31,954
They begin wrecking
the building next week.

180
00:09:35,091 --> 00:09:36,342
No more tours?

181
00:09:36,377 --> 00:09:38,844
None at all?

182
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:40,713
I had to agree to it.

183
00:09:42,598 --> 00:09:43,849
What about the figures?

184
00:09:43,884 --> 00:09:46,352
I haven't
decided yet.

185
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,106
Mr. Ferguson,

186
00:09:50,141 --> 00:09:52,608
we can open
another museum.

187
00:09:52,643 --> 00:09:55,111
We can move everything
somewhere else.

188
00:09:55,146 --> 00:09:56,362
We don't have
to give it up.

189
00:09:56,397 --> 00:09:57,613
No, no,

190
00:09:57,648 --> 00:10:00,116
i'm not as young
as i once was.

191
00:10:00,151 --> 00:10:00,733
Uh, i need a rest.

192
00:10:00,768 --> 00:10:02,618
Fanny and i talked...

193
00:10:02,653 --> 00:10:03,235
don't, don't...

194
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,487
i'll do the work,
i mean it.

195
00:10:04,522 --> 00:10:05,738
You won't have
to do a thing.

196
00:10:05,773 --> 00:10:06,372
Not a thing!

197
00:10:07,623 --> 00:10:08,874
I appreciate that, martin,

198
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:11,377
and i know you'd be
a great help, but...

199
00:10:11,412 --> 00:10:13,879
it would be foolish.

200
00:10:13,914 --> 00:10:14,497
But why?

201
00:10:14,532 --> 00:10:16,999
Why would it
be foolish?

202
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:22,254
Let me show you something.

203
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:26,008
We are passe,
martin.

204
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:30,396
People aren't interested
in wax museums anymore.

205
00:10:30,431 --> 00:10:33,516
Here. Look through it-
it's all in there.

206
00:10:33,551 --> 00:10:36,018
Our attendance figures.

207
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:38,521
Our gains,
but mostly our losses.

208
00:10:38,556 --> 00:10:41,023
This last year has been
the poorest of all.

209
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:42,274
You'll also find

210
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:46,028
a news story about the closing
of the grand guignol.

211
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:51,033
A sign of the times-
the handwriting on the wall.

212
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:54,170
Grand guignol.

213
00:10:57,923 --> 00:11:00,426
Uh, sure you
won't have a drink?

214
00:11:00,461 --> 00:11:02,928
No, thank you.

215
00:11:09,185 --> 00:11:11,053
You, you see, martin,

216
00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:14,190
the outside world

217
00:11:14,225 --> 00:11:16,058
offers them fears
we could never match.

218
00:11:16,093 --> 00:11:19,195
The ovens
at belsen and dachau

219
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:21,697
have ruined our
chamber of horrors.

220
00:11:21,732 --> 00:11:25,451
People are blase,
sophisticated.

221
00:11:25,486 --> 00:11:27,953
They think they've outgrown
the need to be frightened.

222
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:30,456
They live in fear
day in, day out.

223
00:11:30,491 --> 00:11:33,576
It, it's
the world, martin.

224
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:36,712
No, no, martin...

225
00:11:36,747 --> 00:11:40,466
it would be foolish
to open another museum.

226
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:45,471
Mr. Ferguson,
maybe...

227
00:11:45,506 --> 00:11:47,339
maybe the location
is wrong.

228
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:48,591
Or maybe... maybe
it's the way

229
00:11:48,626 --> 00:11:50,476
we have the
figures exhibited.

230
00:11:50,511 --> 00:11:52,978
You remember
how the people came

231
00:11:53,013 --> 00:11:54,230
when we worked out
the ripper's arm?

232
00:11:54,265 --> 00:11:55,481
Yes.

233
00:11:55,516 --> 00:11:57,983
Oh, but that was
years ago.

234
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:01,737
Mr. Ferguson...

235
00:12:01,772 --> 00:12:04,490
you're not...
thinking of destroying them,

236
00:12:04,525 --> 00:12:06,242
are you?

237
00:12:06,277 --> 00:12:07,610
They're meant to live forever.

238
00:12:07,645 --> 00:12:11,363
Martin, i tell you, i don't know
what i'm going to do!

239
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:13,365
You're forgetting something.

240
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,751
Forgetting something? What?

241
00:12:15,786 --> 00:12:17,253
Come with me.

242
00:12:17,288 --> 00:12:18,003
Please.

243
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:21,123
Martin!

244
00:12:25,261 --> 00:12:26,512
Martin.

245
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,632
Mr. Ferguson.

246
00:12:29,667 --> 00:12:30,883
Please.

247
00:12:32,134 --> 00:12:33,385
Look at him.

248
00:12:34,637 --> 00:12:35,888
Just look at him.

249
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:39,024
Look at his eyes.

250
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:40,392
Can't you see
the shy, frightened

251
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:42,895
little choir boy
that he once was?

252
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:46,649
Can't you see the bookkeeper
who so longed for freedom?

253
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,286
Why, even the flesh
feels real.

254
00:12:50,321 --> 00:12:52,905
Why, it's
like flesh.

255
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:53,656
And look at the mouth.

256
00:12:53,691 --> 00:12:56,792
Just look at the mouth.

257
00:12:56,827 --> 00:12:58,043
Isn't it about to say something?

258
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:01,163
Why, landru was
an eloquent man.

259
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:01,797
He was full
of tenderness.

260
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:03,165
And it's there!

261
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,668
It's there-
it's caught right in the mouth.

262
00:13:05,703 --> 00:13:08,804
Martin, what are you trying
to say?

263
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:10,806
Mr. Ferguson,
you seem to have forgotten

264
00:13:10,841 --> 00:13:13,309
that these figures are the work
of the great henri guilmont-

265
00:13:13,344 --> 00:13:14,560
the only ones he created

266
00:13:14,595 --> 00:13:15,561
outside
of europe.

267
00:13:15,596 --> 00:13:17,429
No, i haven't forgotten that.

268
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,431
Mr. Ferguson?

269
00:13:21,317 --> 00:13:23,185
I want to buy them.

270
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,322
That's
ridiculous.

271
00:13:26,357 --> 00:13:27,573
I don't think i could bear it

272
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:29,441
if these figures
were destroyed.

273
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:33,195
It would... it would be like
losing five close friends.

274
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:35,698
I won't destroy
them, martin, i
give you my word.

275
00:13:35,733 --> 00:13:37,950
But-but where
would i store them?

276
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:41,453
I could put them
in my basement.

277
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:42,705
Yes, it's a perfect place.

278
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,590
Oh, for heaven's
sake, martin.

279
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:47,092
What would emma say
to having the figures

280
00:13:47,127 --> 00:13:50,212
of five famous murderers
in her basement?

281
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:52,097
Emma wouldn't mind,
she would understand.

282
00:13:52,132 --> 00:13:53,465
And i would put
an air conditioner

283
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,351
in there, i tell you that.

284
00:13:55,386 --> 00:13:59,104
And a heater,
for the colder days.

285
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:00,973
I would take
care of them.

286
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:05,978
Just as i
always have.

287
00:14:09,732 --> 00:14:12,234
They should be here by now.

288
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:13,485
You haven't eaten
your breakfast.

289
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:17,239
And they'll get here
when they get here.

290
00:14:17,274 --> 00:14:19,124
I'm not hungry.

291
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:20,993
How long are we
going to keep them?

292
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:28,500
I have plans
to open my own museum.

293
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:31,003
But i'll have to buy them
from mr. Ferguson first.

294
00:14:32,755 --> 00:14:34,757
Supposing something
happened to them.

295
00:14:34,792 --> 00:14:35,391
You know, it's not like

296
00:14:35,426 --> 00:14:38,394
moving furniture.

297
00:14:38,429 --> 00:14:41,013
They should have
let me ride with them.

298
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,401
What if they drop one?

299
00:14:53,909 --> 00:14:55,160
Is everything all right?

300
00:14:55,195 --> 00:14:57,663
Uh... you, uh, martin senescu?

301
00:14:57,698 --> 00:14:58,280
Yes.

302
00:14:58,914 --> 00:14:59,531
Everything's okay.

303
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:01,417
Ah...
no bumps?

304
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:02,668
Huh?

305
00:15:02,703 --> 00:15:04,536
Any bumps?

306
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:06,422
No. No bumps.

307
00:15:06,457 --> 00:15:08,173
Oh, it's getting warm.

308
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:09,425
Huh?

309
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,042
I said it's getting warm.

310
00:15:10,077 --> 00:15:11,927
You see, they're delicate.

311
00:15:11,962 --> 00:15:13,178
They can't take more
than 80 degrees.

312
00:15:13,213 --> 00:15:15,681
Oh. Huh-huh.

313
00:15:15,716 --> 00:15:20,552
All right... wait.
Easy, please. Easy.

314
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:22,438
Easy!

315
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,191
Easy, easy,
oh, please.

316
00:15:26,226 --> 00:15:28,060
Please, don't jiggle it.
That's it, easy.

317
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:29,311
That's-that's it.
There, there.

318
00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:30,562
Fine.

319
00:15:31,814 --> 00:15:33,065
Here, sign here.

320
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,316
All right.

321
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:35,567
One, two, three...

322
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:41,824
there.

323
00:15:44,326 --> 00:15:45,577
Hmm.

324
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:46,829
Well, emma...

325
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,216
here they are.

326
00:15:51,251 --> 00:15:53,719
Landru...
is in here.

327
00:15:53,754 --> 00:15:55,587
Jack the ripper
is in here.

328
00:15:57,473 --> 00:15:59,341
Ooh, emma, emma,

329
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:01,844
it's going to be like
opening christmas presents.

330
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:04,346
I didn't think they were
going to be so big.

331
00:16:04,381 --> 00:16:06,231
Oh, well, no, that's
just the boxes.

332
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:09,351
The figures themselves
are as big as we are.

333
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:13,105
Well, i'll have to be very
careful with the uncrating.

334
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:16,241
Mr. Senescu?

335
00:16:16,276 --> 00:16:17,493
Yes.

336
00:16:17,528 --> 00:16:18,744
The movers said
you were down here.

337
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:20,612
Where do you want
the air conditioner?

338
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:22,498
Ah... there. Put it

339
00:16:22,533 --> 00:16:23,999
in that window,
over there. You see it?

340
00:16:24,034 --> 00:16:25,117
Oh, okay.

341
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:26,368
All right.

342
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:27,619
Martin-

343
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:29,505
you bought an
air conditioner?

344
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,373
Yes, the figures
can't stand heat.

345
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:32,624
We had to have it.

346
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:33,876
Well, how much
did it cost?

347
00:16:33,911 --> 00:16:35,127
Well...

348
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:36,378
don't worry
about it.

349
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:38,263
Well, i am
worried about it.

350
00:16:38,298 --> 00:16:40,132
And i'm also worried
about how i'm going

351
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:42,017
to do the laundry
with all this lying around...

352
00:16:42,052 --> 00:16:44,520
oh, emma, you can't... you
can't do the laundry here.

353
00:16:44,555 --> 00:16:46,021
The... the humidity!

354
00:16:46,056 --> 00:16:49,024
I mean, you don't have
a decent shirt to wear,
and it's been a week since i...

355
00:16:49,059 --> 00:16:50,893
look, go to
the laundromat.

356
00:16:50,928 --> 00:16:51,894
Just take it anywhere,

357
00:16:51,929 --> 00:16:55,030
but leave me to
my friends, please.

358
00:17:12,581 --> 00:17:15,084
You cleaned
that cape last week.

359
00:17:16,218 --> 00:17:18,087
Brushed it, you mean.

360
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:21,974
It's going to need cleaning
and pressing pretty soon.

361
00:17:22,009 --> 00:17:23,842
In fact,

362
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:25,094
all the clothes
are going to need it.

363
00:17:25,129 --> 00:17:26,345
It's almost been a year.

364
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,230
Martin...

365
00:17:28,265 --> 00:17:30,349
the truth of the matter is,

366
00:17:30,384 --> 00:17:31,600
they all need new clothes.

367
00:17:31,635 --> 00:17:33,485
The ripper comes
off worst, do
you know that?

368
00:17:34,103 --> 00:17:35,988
Why, his coat is torn
right over there.

369
00:17:36,023 --> 00:17:37,606
Martin!

370
00:17:37,641 --> 00:17:39,491
What is it?

371
00:17:39,608 --> 00:17:42,745
We're not buying them
any clothes.

372
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:45,247
Oh, but emma,

373
00:17:45,282 --> 00:17:47,750
it's not just buying.
It's tailoring.

374
00:17:47,785 --> 00:17:49,618
You see, they have
bodies that have...

375
00:17:49,653 --> 00:17:52,755
i don't care
about their bodies!

376
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:55,257
You don't mean
that, do you?

377
00:17:55,292 --> 00:17:57,376
Yes, i do.

378
00:17:57,411 --> 00:17:59,261
Honestly, martin, you've been
paying more attention

379
00:17:59,296 --> 00:18:02,381
to thesemurderers
than you ever did tome.

380
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:04,266
Oh, emma,

381
00:18:04,301 --> 00:18:05,517
that's not true.

382
00:18:05,552 --> 00:18:06,769
Then why do you spend

383
00:18:06,804 --> 00:18:09,888
every minute of the day
and night down here?

384
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:13,642
Don't you see? This is
the work of guilmont.

385
00:18:13,677 --> 00:18:14,893
It's a trust.

386
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:16,145
Why, they're
masterpieces.

387
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:18,647
All right,
so they're masterpieces.

388
00:18:18,682 --> 00:18:19,898
You told me
they'd only be here

389
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,150
for a few days.

390
00:18:21,185 --> 00:18:22,401
But they've been here
for weeks.

391
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:24,903
Don't you
realize that?

392
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:26,789
I've been nice
about it, martin.

393
00:18:26,824 --> 00:18:28,657
You can't say
that i haven't.

394
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:31,160
But how long am i going to be

395
00:18:31,195 --> 00:18:33,662
locked out of my own basement?

396
00:18:33,697 --> 00:18:35,547
Oh, emma!

397
00:18:35,582 --> 00:18:37,416
I'm sorry,
dear, i am.

398
00:18:37,451 --> 00:18:39,301
But i didn't lie.

399
00:18:39,336 --> 00:18:41,804
I thought that they'd just
be here for a short while.

400
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:43,055
I really did.

401
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:44,923
But i can't seem
to find anybody

402
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:47,426
who's-who's willing to
finance the museum.

403
00:18:47,461 --> 00:18:49,311
But how can you
find anybody,

404
00:18:49,346 --> 00:18:51,180
if you spend
all of your time down here?

405
00:18:51,215 --> 00:18:53,682
But i've phoned,
and these people...

406
00:18:53,717 --> 00:18:56,819
do you know these
people never even
heard of guilmont?

407
00:18:56,854 --> 00:18:58,687
Can you imagine?

408
00:18:58,722 --> 00:19:01,190
What, what's that?

409
00:19:01,225 --> 00:19:03,075
It's the
electric bill.

410
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,943
You'll see how much
it's costing us to keep

411
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:06,829
the air conditioner
running day and night.

412
00:19:06,864 --> 00:19:09,331
But you know it has
been hot down here.

413
00:19:11,834 --> 00:19:13,085
Oh.

414
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,953
That is high,
isn't it?

415
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:18,090
I just wish i could figure out

416
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:19,958
how we're going
to keep on paying it.

417
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:23,712
Martin, there's no more money

418
00:19:23,747 --> 00:19:24,963
in the bank.

419
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:26,965
I know, but
don't worry.

420
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,851
Please,
i'll find a way.

421
00:19:28,886 --> 00:19:30,719
There must be
somebody, somewhere.

422
00:19:30,754 --> 00:19:31,970
Mr. Ferguson.

423
00:19:32,221 --> 00:19:34,106
Hmm... no.

424
00:19:34,141 --> 00:19:35,974
Martin, why not?
You told me yourself

425
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:37,860
that he loves these things
as much as you do.

426
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:41,480
And isn't it really up to him
to take care of them?

427
00:19:41,515 --> 00:19:43,982
Emma, i don't know
anyone in the world

428
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:46,618
i have more respect
for than mr. Ferguson.

429
00:19:46,653 --> 00:19:49,121
But i wouldn't trust him
with those figures.

430
00:19:49,156 --> 00:19:50,989
I don't think he could
take care of them right,

431
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:52,875
and i wouldn't be
able to sleep if i...

432
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:54,126
so, we're stuck
with them!

433
00:19:54,161 --> 00:19:56,378
Stuck?

434
00:19:56,413 --> 00:19:58,247
What do you
mean stuck, emma?

435
00:19:58,282 --> 00:20:00,132
Oh, please,
it's an honor.

436
00:20:00,167 --> 00:20:01,383
It's a privilege.

437
00:20:01,418 --> 00:20:02,634
For you, maybe.

438
00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:04,386
But what about me?
How do you think i feel?

439
00:20:04,421 --> 00:20:06,889
Every time i come down here
and look at them,

440
00:20:06,924 --> 00:20:08,140
i just about have
a heart attack.

441
00:20:08,175 --> 00:20:10,008
The way they stand there
and stare at me,

442
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:12,144
they're frightening!

443
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:13,395
But emma...

444
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:15,898
they're supposed
to be frightening.

445
00:20:15,933 --> 00:20:17,149
Let me tell you this.

446
00:20:17,184 --> 00:20:19,651
When you live with them
as long as i have,

447
00:20:19,686 --> 00:20:21,520
you come to love them.

448
00:20:23,405 --> 00:20:24,656
Love them?

449
00:20:24,691 --> 00:20:25,908
Yes.

450
00:20:25,943 --> 00:20:28,410
And... then they cease
to be strangers,

451
00:20:28,445 --> 00:20:30,913
and you want to say...

452
00:20:32,781 --> 00:20:33,415
good morning!

453
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:38,787
How'd you spend
the night, jack?

454
00:20:38,822 --> 00:20:40,672
And then it seem...

455
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:42,541
emma?

456
00:20:43,792 --> 00:20:45,043
Emma!

457
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:46,929
Emma?

458
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:58,190
Oh... if only one of those
people he's been talking to

459
00:20:58,225 --> 00:21:01,310
would lend him enough money
to open the museum,

460
00:21:01,345 --> 00:21:03,812
that would make
everything all right.

461
00:21:03,847 --> 00:21:06,315
Now, emma, listen
to your brother.

462
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:07,566
Nobody's going
to put money

463
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:09,451
into a crazy scheme
like that.

464
00:21:09,486 --> 00:21:11,954
Old ferguson knew
what he was doing,

465
00:21:11,989 --> 00:21:13,822
all right, when he sold out.

466
00:21:13,857 --> 00:21:16,959
He got martin to take care of
all those crazy dummies,

467
00:21:16,994 --> 00:21:18,827
and he's not even paying him
for it.

468
00:21:18,862 --> 00:21:21,964
Pretty shrewd.

469
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,083
What we've got to do...

470
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:29,471
we've got to get martin
away from those things.

471
00:21:29,506 --> 00:21:30,722
Does he have them all?

472
00:21:30,757 --> 00:21:32,341
Only a few.

473
00:21:32,376 --> 00:21:34,843
Well, how come?
I mean, ferguson had

474
00:21:34,878 --> 00:21:35,477
two or 200,
didn't he?

475
00:21:36,094 --> 00:21:37,346
Well, these are special.

476
00:21:37,381 --> 00:21:38,847
Some man
in europe
made them.

477
00:21:38,882 --> 00:21:41,350
I don't know how
they could be so special,

478
00:21:41,385 --> 00:21:42,601
if they didn't
cost anything.

479
00:21:42,636 --> 00:21:44,486
They are to him.

480
00:21:44,521 --> 00:21:48,240
This is the first time anything
has come between us.

481
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:51,360
Ihatethose murderers!

482
00:21:51,994 --> 00:21:52,744
You come on.

483
00:21:52,779 --> 00:21:55,247
We're going to go talk
to him right now.

484
00:21:55,282 --> 00:21:56,498
No, no, dave,

485
00:21:56,533 --> 00:21:57,749
it wouldn't do
any good.

486
00:21:57,784 --> 00:22:00,252
Okay. Then you talk to him.

487
00:22:00,287 --> 00:22:01,870
But here's what you do.

488
00:22:01,905 --> 00:22:04,373
Don't talk to him
the way you have been.

489
00:22:04,408 --> 00:22:05,624
I mean, lay it
right on the line.

490
00:22:05,659 --> 00:22:09,378
You tell him it's either
those stupid dummies oryou!

491
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:13,765
Of course, if that
doesn't work, there...

492
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,885
there is something else.

493
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,136
What?

494
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:19,388
Well, um...

495
00:22:20,022 --> 00:22:23,775
air conditioners
do break down, you know.

496
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:25,027
Oh.

497
00:22:26,395 --> 00:22:28,897
Oh, i couldn't do that.

498
00:22:28,932 --> 00:22:31,149
Couldn't you?

499
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:53,672
Emma.

500
00:22:53,707 --> 00:22:55,557
Emma, where have you been?

501
00:22:55,592 --> 00:22:59,311
You walked out on me
while i was talking to you.

502
00:22:59,346 --> 00:23:01,179
Oh, emma, emma, i
know you're angry
with me, but i...

503
00:23:01,214 --> 00:23:03,065
what can i do?

504
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:06,818
I have to keep
the figures in
perfect condition.

505
00:23:06,853 --> 00:23:08,687
I can't let
them go or...

506
00:23:10,572 --> 00:23:11,823
i thought you said

507
00:23:11,858 --> 00:23:14,326
we didn't have
any money left.

508
00:23:14,361 --> 00:23:17,446
I bought them
with some money
davegave me.

509
00:23:17,481 --> 00:23:19,331
Dave!

510
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:25,587
Oh, my...

511
00:23:25,622 --> 00:23:27,456
my, my...

512
00:23:27,491 --> 00:23:29,341
oh, martin!

513
00:23:29,376 --> 00:23:31,209
We can't go on this way.

514
00:23:31,244 --> 00:23:32,461
Yes, i know. Well...

515
00:23:33,095 --> 00:23:35,597
i'll borrow some money
from mr. Ferguson.

516
00:23:35,632 --> 00:23:37,466
Borrowing isn't
going to help.

517
00:23:37,501 --> 00:23:42,471
Well, then, i'll-i'll-i'll...
i'll mortgage the house.

518
00:23:42,506 --> 00:23:44,973
That isn't going to answer
our problem.

519
00:23:45,008 --> 00:23:47,476
Martin, nobody knows
better than i

520
00:23:47,511 --> 00:23:50,612
how much those figures
mean to you.

521
00:23:50,647 --> 00:23:51,863
But...

522
00:23:51,898 --> 00:23:53,732
but what, emma?
Emma?

523
00:23:53,767 --> 00:23:58,120
But i simply willnothave them
in this house

524
00:23:58,155 --> 00:23:59,988
one minute longer!

525
00:24:00,023 --> 00:24:01,873
Why shouldn't mr. Ferguson
take care of them?

526
00:24:01,908 --> 00:24:03,125
They're his.

527
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,376
Well, why shouldn't he?

528
00:24:04,411 --> 00:24:07,496
That's what
you really think, isn't it?

529
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:13,001
Is that all they mean to you?

530
00:24:13,036 --> 00:24:13,885
Yes.

531
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,754
And i want you to call

532
00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:17,005
and tell him tomorrow morning.

533
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,757
Martin,

534
00:24:18,792 --> 00:24:21,259
once they're away
from here

535
00:24:21,294 --> 00:24:23,145
you'll be a different
man, you'll see.

536
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:26,264
You've been around those
wax dummies for so long,

537
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:28,150
you've forgotten how
to be a human being.

538
00:24:28,185 --> 00:24:29,401
No!

539
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:32,270
What kind of a friend
do you think i am?

540
00:24:32,305 --> 00:24:34,773
I can't desert them now,
after all these years.

541
00:24:34,808 --> 00:24:36,658
They need me!

542
00:24:36,693 --> 00:24:38,527
They'd be lost without me.

543
00:24:38,562 --> 00:24:40,278
Martin!

544
00:24:40,313 --> 00:24:42,164
They're not alive.

545
00:24:42,199 --> 00:24:44,032
They don't need anybody!

546
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:47,669
Martin...

547
00:24:50,288 --> 00:24:52,791
i want you
to see a doctor.

548
00:24:52,826 --> 00:24:53,425
A doc...?

549
00:24:54,042 --> 00:24:55,293
Yes, just once.

550
00:24:55,328 --> 00:24:57,179
Well, there's
nothing whatever

551
00:24:57,214 --> 00:24:59,047
the matter with me.

552
00:24:59,082 --> 00:25:00,932
I, i didn't
say there was.

553
00:25:00,967 --> 00:25:04,052
Then, what do i need
a doctor for?

554
00:25:04,087 --> 00:25:05,303
Because, martin

555
00:25:05,338 --> 00:25:07,806
thereissomething
the matter with you.

556
00:25:07,841 --> 00:25:09,057
Well, what?

557
00:25:09,092 --> 00:25:11,560
But you haven't been
yourself lately.

558
00:25:11,595 --> 00:25:14,062
Well...
who have i been?

559
00:25:14,097 --> 00:25:15,947
I don't know.

560
00:25:15,982 --> 00:25:17,199
Somebody i've
never known.

561
00:25:17,234 --> 00:25:20,318
But martin, staying down
in that basement all day

562
00:25:20,353 --> 00:25:22,821
and talking to thosethings
as if they were alive,

563
00:25:22,856 --> 00:25:25,323
it's not natural.

564
00:25:27,209 --> 00:25:29,077
Emma...

565
00:25:29,112 --> 00:25:31,580
that's my job.

566
00:25:31,615 --> 00:25:33,465
I'm not the only husband
in the world

567
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,333
who brings his work home.

568
00:25:35,368 --> 00:25:37,219
Don't you see?

569
00:25:37,254 --> 00:25:39,087
I don't want to talk
about it anymore.

570
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:44,726
And...

571
00:25:44,761 --> 00:25:47,846
you go back and you tell
that brother of yours

572
00:25:47,881 --> 00:25:50,348
to mind his
own business.

573
00:25:50,383 --> 00:25:51,600
You hear me?

574
00:27:25,327 --> 00:27:27,195
Emma?

575
00:27:28,446 --> 00:27:30,949
Emma.

576
00:27:30,984 --> 00:27:32,200
Emma?

577
00:27:35,954 --> 00:27:37,839
Emma?

578
00:27:38,456 --> 00:27:39,708
Emma, you down there?

579
00:27:45,213 --> 00:27:46,464
Emma?

580
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:50,852
Emma, you down here?

581
00:27:54,222 --> 00:27:55,473
Emma?

582
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:02,981
Emma.

583
00:28:04,866 --> 00:28:05,617
Emma?

584
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:09,371
Emma!

585
00:28:11,239 --> 00:28:13,124
Emma!

586
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:14,376
Emma, what happened?

587
00:28:14,411 --> 00:28:14,993
Emma...

588
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:15,186
twilight zonewill continue
after station identification.

589
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:44,716
Ah, i hate
to put you here, emma, but...

590
00:29:44,751 --> 00:29:46,584
what can i do?

591
00:29:47,836 --> 00:29:51,589
I know i should report it
to the police,

592
00:29:51,624 --> 00:29:54,726
and i want to, but...

593
00:29:55,593 --> 00:29:57,479
but who would believe me

594
00:29:57,514 --> 00:30:01,232
if i told them that you were
killed by jack the ripper?

595
00:30:01,267 --> 00:30:03,101
You can see that, can't you?

596
00:30:04,352 --> 00:30:05,603
Besides...

597
00:30:07,489 --> 00:30:09,991
if i went to prison-

598
00:30:10,026 --> 00:30:11,860
as i probably would-

599
00:30:11,895 --> 00:30:16,247
who would take care
of the figures?

600
00:30:16,282 --> 00:30:17,499
No.

601
00:30:20,001 --> 00:30:21,870
It's better this way.

602
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:34,382
Poor emma.

603
00:30:36,885 --> 00:30:40,021
Too late to tell her
anything now.

604
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,041
There.

605
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:05,663
That's the best i can do, emma.

606
00:31:07,584 --> 00:31:09,417
Gas man!

607
00:31:13,054 --> 00:31:14,923
Well, hi, there,
mr. Senescu.

608
00:31:14,958 --> 00:31:16,808
Doing a little
patching i see.

609
00:31:16,843 --> 00:31:18,676
Yes, uh...

610
00:31:18,711 --> 00:31:21,179
floor must have been
pretty bad, huh?

611
00:31:21,214 --> 00:31:24,315
It was starting
to crack a little.

612
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:26,818
Well, i had to do
the same thing in my basement.

613
00:31:26,853 --> 00:31:29,320
That's the way it is with
these old houses, you know.

614
00:31:29,355 --> 00:31:29,938
Oh, yes.

615
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:35,076
Holy mackerel.

616
00:31:35,111 --> 00:31:36,945
Be careful of
the cement, please.

617
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:39,447
For a minute there i...

618
00:31:39,482 --> 00:31:41,950
where'd you ever get
anything like this?

619
00:31:41,985 --> 00:31:43,835
Well, they belong
to mr. Ferguson.

620
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:45,086
But i'm taking
care of them.

621
00:31:45,121 --> 00:31:48,840
They used to be in a museum,
but it closed.

622
00:31:48,875 --> 00:31:53,211
Boy, they're the most realistic
things i ever saw.

623
00:31:53,246 --> 00:31:54,596
You sure
they ain't alive?

624
00:31:54,631 --> 00:31:56,464
Not all together.

625
00:31:56,499 --> 00:31:57,715
Well, they
could fool me.

626
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:00,852
Sure be a fine thing
to have come halloween.

627
00:32:01,469 --> 00:32:02,103
Something like this

628
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:07,225
in the basement,
you'd really throw
a scare into people.

629
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:09,727
Man, oh man.

630
00:32:09,762 --> 00:32:12,230
Even up close they, uh...

631
00:32:12,265 --> 00:32:13,481
well, what's this?

632
00:32:13,516 --> 00:32:15,116
What?

633
00:32:15,151 --> 00:32:17,619
Whoever made these up,
they thought of everything.

634
00:32:17,654 --> 00:32:19,487
Even put blood
on the knife.

635
00:32:19,522 --> 00:32:21,873
Pretty good.

636
00:32:21,908 --> 00:32:23,124
Well, i got to go.

637
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:27,879
But i want to tell
you, you've got
quite a layout here.

638
00:32:27,914 --> 00:32:30,381
Hey, tell me something.

639
00:32:30,416 --> 00:32:31,633
Don't they give you
the creeps?

640
00:32:31,668 --> 00:32:34,135
I mean, being down here
in the basement and all?

641
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:35,386
Oh, no.

642
00:32:35,421 --> 00:32:37,255
Uh, not when you know
them as well as i do.

643
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:39,757
Oh, you're a card,
mr. Senescu.

644
00:32:39,792 --> 00:32:42,894
Wait till i tell the wife
about this.

645
00:32:42,929 --> 00:32:46,648
Hey, do you think
it'd be all right

646
00:32:46,683 --> 00:32:47,899
if i brought her over
for a look at those things?

647
00:32:48,516 --> 00:32:49,150
Oh, i don't think so.

648
00:32:49,185 --> 00:32:51,653
We'll be gone
for a while.

649
00:32:51,688 --> 00:32:52,270
Tomorrow?

650
00:32:52,305 --> 00:32:53,521
No, for days,

651
00:32:53,556 --> 00:32:56,024
and, uh, we don't
know when we'll be back.

652
00:32:56,059 --> 00:32:57,275
Oh.

653
00:32:57,909 --> 00:33:01,029
Well, uh, i'll see you.
So long.

654
00:33:01,064 --> 00:33:02,280
Bye.

655
00:33:20,298 --> 00:33:21,549
Jack!

656
00:33:21,584 --> 00:33:22,800
I'm surprised at you.

657
00:33:22,835 --> 00:33:24,686
I amreallysurprised.

658
00:33:24,721 --> 00:33:27,305
How did you manage
all those murders

659
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,556
without being caught
by scotland yard?

660
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:30,558
Why, any killer knows

661
00:33:30,593 --> 00:33:33,061
that you can't leave blood
on a murder weapon!

662
00:33:33,096 --> 00:33:33,695
It's...

663
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:35,563
well, it's not
a joke, jack,

664
00:33:35,598 --> 00:33:37,448
but it's a dead
giveaway, now...

665
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:53,081
there.

666
00:33:54,966 --> 00:33:56,217
It's good as new.

667
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:58,086
Now will youplease,

668
00:33:58,121 --> 00:34:01,839
pleasebehave yourself?

669
00:34:01,874 --> 00:34:04,342
I don't want to have to
go through this again.

670
00:34:06,262 --> 00:34:08,730
Emma?

671
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:09,981
Martin.

672
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:13,101
Martin.

673
00:34:13,136 --> 00:34:15,603
Anybody down there?

674
00:34:18,141 --> 00:34:21,242
Martin, if you're
down there, open up.

675
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,613
Martin.

676
00:34:25,648 --> 00:34:28,116
All right, i'm, i'm here.

677
00:34:28,151 --> 00:34:30,001
Open the door.

678
00:34:30,036 --> 00:34:31,252
I can't, dave.

679
00:34:31,287 --> 00:34:33,121
Why not?

680
00:34:33,156 --> 00:34:35,006
Dave, i have a lot of, uh...

681
00:34:35,041 --> 00:34:36,874
things piled up
against the door.

682
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:38,126
I'm going upstairs.

683
00:34:38,161 --> 00:34:40,628
You come around the back door
to the kitchen.

684
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:50,388
You there, martin?

685
00:34:50,423 --> 00:34:52,890
Yes, uh...

686
00:34:52,925 --> 00:34:54,776
coming, dave.

687
00:35:11,659 --> 00:35:12,910
You got
this place locked up

688
00:35:12,945 --> 00:35:14,796
like fort knox
or something.

689
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:16,047
What's the big idea?

690
00:35:16,082 --> 00:35:17,298
Oh, we, uh...

691
00:35:17,333 --> 00:35:19,167
we always keep
the doors locked.

692
00:35:19,202 --> 00:35:21,052
Where's emma?

693
00:35:21,087 --> 00:35:22,303
Uh, she's, uh,
she's not here.

694
00:35:22,338 --> 00:35:23,554
Oh.

695
00:35:23,589 --> 00:35:25,423
It's probably
just as well.

696
00:35:25,458 --> 00:35:26,674
Why?

697
00:35:26,709 --> 00:35:29,177
Dave, what do you want?

698
00:35:29,212 --> 00:35:31,679
Uh, have you got an
ashtray somewhere?

699
00:35:31,714 --> 00:35:34,182
Yeah. Oh, here.

700
00:35:34,217 --> 00:35:35,433
How's this?

701
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:42,940
Uh, sit down,
sit down, martin.

702
00:35:42,975 --> 00:35:45,693
Dave, to tell the truth,

703
00:35:45,728 --> 00:35:47,578
i'm kind of busy.

704
00:35:47,613 --> 00:35:49,947
I'll bet.

705
00:35:49,982 --> 00:35:52,333
If you just tell me
what you want, i...

706
00:35:52,368 --> 00:35:54,202
come on, come on, sit down.

707
00:35:54,237 --> 00:35:56,087
Sit down.

708
00:35:59,841 --> 00:36:01,092
What is it?

709
00:36:01,127 --> 00:36:03,461
Emma came to see me yesterday.

710
00:36:03,496 --> 00:36:05,346
Oh, yes, i, uh...

711
00:36:05,381 --> 00:36:07,215
i know, she told me.

712
00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:10,351
She did?

713
00:36:10,386 --> 00:36:12,220
All right,
that'll make things easier.

714
00:36:12,255 --> 00:36:15,356
Where did she
go, by the way?

715
00:36:15,391 --> 00:36:17,225
She took a trip.

716
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:19,727
A trip? Where?

717
00:36:20,361 --> 00:36:22,230
To see my sister.

718
00:36:22,265 --> 00:36:23,481
Oh.

719
00:36:23,516 --> 00:36:25,366
You two have an argument?

720
00:36:27,235 --> 00:36:28,486
Well...

721
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,988
everything's settled now.

722
00:36:31,622 --> 00:36:32,874
Well, i'm certainly glad
to hear that.

723
00:36:32,909 --> 00:36:35,993
She was sure
upset when she
talked to me.

724
00:36:36,028 --> 00:36:37,245
Yes, i know.

725
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,496
You've got
to admit

726
00:36:38,531 --> 00:36:40,381
you didn't treat
her square.

727
00:36:40,416 --> 00:36:41,632
You brought
those dummies here

728
00:36:41,667 --> 00:36:43,501
and kept her out
of her own basement.

729
00:36:44,752 --> 00:36:48,506
Well... it's all been changed.

730
00:36:48,541 --> 00:36:51,008
Well, i guess

731
00:36:51,043 --> 00:36:55,263
i had you pegged
all wrong, marty.

732
00:36:55,298 --> 00:36:56,514
You got rid of 'em?

733
00:36:56,549 --> 00:36:57,765
Yes.

734
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,268
Must've been a pretty hot
night last night, huh?

735
00:37:00,303 --> 00:37:03,271
What do you mean, hot?

736
00:37:03,306 --> 00:37:06,774
Pretty hot for a bunch
of wax dummies, huh?

737
00:37:11,162 --> 00:37:14,916
What's that humming noise?

738
00:37:14,951 --> 00:37:15,533
Well, i...

739
00:37:15,568 --> 00:37:18,669
i don't hear anything.

740
00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:23,674
It... sounds like it's coming
from down there.

741
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:31,182
That's the air conditioner.

742
00:37:34,802 --> 00:37:37,939
What are you
trying to hand me?

743
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:43,561
The door's locked.

744
00:37:43,596 --> 00:37:45,563
Yes, i, uh...
i told you, you know

745
00:37:46,197 --> 00:37:48,065
i like to keep the doors locked.

746
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,700
Why is the air conditioner going

747
00:37:49,735 --> 00:37:50,952
if you got rid of
the wax figures?

748
00:37:50,987 --> 00:37:53,454
Well, i was cleaning up, dave,

749
00:37:53,489 --> 00:37:57,208
and i just wanted to keep
the place cool, that's all.

750
00:37:57,243 --> 00:37:59,076
Look, you just came
up the stairway,

751
00:37:59,111 --> 00:38:00,962
and you locked the
door behind you.

752
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:03,464
Now, why?

753
00:38:03,499 --> 00:38:04,715
It's a habit.

754
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:05,967
I don't
think so.

755
00:38:06,002 --> 00:38:09,086
I think you locked it to keep me
from going down there.

756
00:38:09,121 --> 00:38:10,972
Now, you
better
open up.

757
00:38:11,007 --> 00:38:14,091
Are you threatening me
in my own house?

758
00:38:16,594 --> 00:38:18,479
You never got rid
of them things at all.

759
00:38:18,514 --> 00:38:20,982
And how about this
sister of yours?

760
00:38:21,017 --> 00:38:23,484
How come emma never
mentioned her before?

761
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:24,735
Where does she live?

762
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:27,855
Look, dave, i've...
had a very busy day.

763
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:29,740
I'm tired
of answering questions.

764
00:38:30,358 --> 00:38:32,360
Now, will you please leave?

765
00:38:32,395 --> 00:38:33,611
Okay.

766
00:38:33,646 --> 00:38:34,862
All right.

767
00:38:34,897 --> 00:38:36,747
Fine, i can take a hint.

768
00:38:36,782 --> 00:38:39,250
I'll just be
on my way.

769
00:38:39,285 --> 00:38:40,501
You, uh...
you have emma call me

770
00:38:40,536 --> 00:38:43,004
if she comes back,
you hear?

771
00:40:46,243 --> 00:40:48,746
Dave!

772
00:40:49,997 --> 00:40:50,631
Dave!

773
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:55,002
Oh!

774
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:07,898
Hicks, how could you?

775
00:41:14,023 --> 00:41:15,239
Martin.

776
00:41:15,274 --> 00:41:17,741
Martin!

777
00:41:19,028 --> 00:41:22,112
Martin, are
you there?

778
00:41:22,147 --> 00:41:23,998
Martin...

779
00:41:24,033 --> 00:41:25,249
martin?

780
00:41:25,284 --> 00:41:26,500
Yes.

781
00:41:29,003 --> 00:41:32,122
Oh, mr. Ferguson.

782
00:41:35,009 --> 00:41:36,260
Come in, come in.

783
00:41:36,295 --> 00:41:37,511
Martin, how nice
to see you!

784
00:41:37,546 --> 00:41:38,762
Nice to see you.
I'm sorry.

785
00:41:38,797 --> 00:41:41,265
I didn't hear you.
The air conditioner's on.

786
00:41:42,551 --> 00:41:44,385
Yes, it's nice
and cool down here.

787
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:45,636
Yes.

788
00:41:45,671 --> 00:41:48,138
There they are.

789
00:41:48,173 --> 00:41:49,390
Yes.

790
00:41:52,026 --> 00:41:53,894
And in perfect
condition.

791
00:41:53,929 --> 00:41:57,031
Martin, i can't keep it
from you any longer.

792
00:41:57,066 --> 00:41:58,282
What, sir?

793
00:41:58,317 --> 00:42:00,150
The best news
in the world.

794
00:42:00,185 --> 00:42:02,653
Martin, old friend,
when i told you

795
00:42:02,688 --> 00:42:05,155
that nobody wanted
to buy these figures,

796
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:07,658
i was being
too pessimistic.

797
00:42:07,693 --> 00:42:10,794
The fact is,
somebody does want to.

798
00:42:10,829 --> 00:42:13,914
But not just somebody.

799
00:42:13,949 --> 00:42:16,417
The marchand museum.

800
00:42:16,452 --> 00:42:17,668
Oh.

801
00:42:17,703 --> 00:42:19,553
Didn't you
hear me?
Yes.

802
00:42:19,588 --> 00:42:20,804
Marchand's.

803
00:42:20,839 --> 00:42:22,056
In brussels.

804
00:42:22,091 --> 00:42:23,924
I can't imagine
why, but...

805
00:42:23,959 --> 00:42:26,427
aren't you pleased?

806
00:42:26,462 --> 00:42:28,929
Yes.

807
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:32,066
Mr. Ferguson,
look at the ripper.

808
00:42:32,101 --> 00:42:34,568
I must say, martin,
you have kept them up well.

809
00:42:34,603 --> 00:42:37,688
Yes, now, you see, this
needs fixing in here.

810
00:42:37,723 --> 00:42:39,573
The threads are
starting to fall out.

811
00:42:39,608 --> 00:42:43,327
As a matter of fact, i think
they all need new clothes.

812
00:42:43,362 --> 00:42:47,081
Maybe it is too humid
in here, after all.

813
00:42:47,116 --> 00:42:48,949
We won't have to worry
about that anymore.

814
00:42:48,984 --> 00:42:50,834
Oh, and i asked emma
to sew this rip up,

815
00:42:50,869 --> 00:42:53,337
but there's been
so many things to do.

816
00:42:53,372 --> 00:42:55,205
Oh, by the way,
how is emma?

817
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,457
Oh, she's fine.

818
00:42:56,492 --> 00:42:58,959
You have a
remarkable wife, martin.

819
00:42:58,994 --> 00:43:00,844
There aren't many women
who would put up

820
00:43:00,879 --> 00:43:02,713
with an exhibit like this
in their basement.

821
00:43:02,748 --> 00:43:05,215
She never complains.

822
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:08,352
Oh, have you been
sleeping down here?

823
00:43:08,387 --> 00:43:08,969
Yes.

824
00:43:09,004 --> 00:43:10,854
Oh!

825
00:43:10,889 --> 00:43:13,223
Mr. Ferguson...
i came across this little item

826
00:43:13,258 --> 00:43:16,360
in this book that
i was reading just
before i fell asleep.

827
00:43:16,395 --> 00:43:18,228
Martin...
mr. Ferguson,
do you remember

828
00:43:18,263 --> 00:43:21,982
how excited we used to get
when we found out some new
things about the figures?

829
00:43:22,017 --> 00:43:23,233
Martin, are you
all right?

830
00:43:23,268 --> 00:43:24,485
Yes.

831
00:43:28,989 --> 00:43:30,240
No, mr. Ferguson.

832
00:43:32,126 --> 00:43:33,994
It isn't so.

833
00:43:34,029 --> 00:43:35,245
I'm not all right.

834
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,131
No?

835
00:43:37,166 --> 00:43:37,748
No.

836
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:42,136
Some strange things
have been happening.

837
00:43:42,171 --> 00:43:44,004
Strange things?

838
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:45,255
Yes.

839
00:43:48,392 --> 00:43:51,512
They haven't exactly
been behaving themselves.

840
00:43:51,547 --> 00:43:52,763
Who?

841
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:00,404
Oh, come now.

842
00:44:00,439 --> 00:44:03,524
Oh, it's true,
i swear it.

843
00:44:03,559 --> 00:44:05,409
You've no idea what
they've been up to.

844
00:44:07,277 --> 00:44:08,529
Oh, martin.

845
00:44:08,564 --> 00:44:10,414
You've been so close...
sh!

846
00:44:10,449 --> 00:44:11,665
You've been so close

847
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:13,534
to these figures
for the past three months.

848
00:44:13,569 --> 00:44:15,419
You're beginning
toimaginethings about them.

849
00:44:15,454 --> 00:44:17,921
No, no, it's
not imagination.
Not at all.

850
00:44:17,956 --> 00:44:19,790
Well, that's neither
here nor there.

851
00:44:19,825 --> 00:44:21,041
The point is...

852
00:44:21,076 --> 00:44:23,544
you won't have to take care
of them any longer.

853
00:44:23,579 --> 00:44:26,046
But mr. Ferguson, i want
to take care of them.

854
00:44:26,081 --> 00:44:27,297
I know you do.

855
00:44:27,332 --> 00:44:29,933
And as i've said,
i appreciate

856
00:44:29,968 --> 00:44:32,436
what you've done,
but it's all settled.

857
00:44:43,063 --> 00:44:45,566
Of course, there'll be
a substantial reward to you

858
00:44:45,601 --> 00:44:49,953
for all the years
you've cared for them.

859
00:44:49,988 --> 00:44:54,324
Now, why don't you prepare us
a cup of tea or something

860
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:56,827
while i take some measurements.

861
00:44:56,862 --> 00:44:59,329
The marchand people want
some specifications

862
00:44:59,364 --> 00:45:02,466
i wasn't able to provide.

863
00:45:02,501 --> 00:45:04,334
All right.

864
00:45:05,621 --> 00:45:07,471
I'll make some tea.

865
00:45:21,351 --> 00:45:23,854
53 inches.

866
00:45:37,618 --> 00:45:38,869
Hmm.

867
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,371
37.

868
00:45:41,406 --> 00:45:44,508
I didn't think
you were that wide.

869
00:45:44,543 --> 00:45:46,376
Well, no matter.

870
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:21,795
Mr. Ferguson,

871
00:46:21,830 --> 00:46:23,664
i brought you
both the cream and the sugar.

872
00:46:23,699 --> 00:46:24,915
I didn't know
which one you want...

873
00:46:28,669 --> 00:46:31,171
mr. Ferguson.

874
00:46:31,206 --> 00:46:33,674
Mr. Ferguson!

875
00:46:38,812 --> 00:46:41,315
Landru.

876
00:46:41,350 --> 00:46:43,317
It was you.

877
00:46:47,688 --> 00:46:49,573
And hicks.

878
00:46:49,608 --> 00:46:50,574
Hicks.

879
00:46:50,609 --> 00:46:51,825
And burke.

880
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:53,076
And hare.

881
00:46:53,111 --> 00:46:54,328
I know you didn't have
any part in this,

882
00:46:54,363 --> 00:46:56,830
but you didn't stop it.

883
00:46:56,865 --> 00:46:58,081
And you, landru,

884
00:46:58,116 --> 00:46:59,950
especially you.

885
00:46:59,985 --> 00:47:01,835
And you, jack.

886
00:47:03,704 --> 00:47:06,206
This time you went too far.

887
00:47:06,241 --> 00:47:08,091
I gave you
all the best years i had.

888
00:47:08,126 --> 00:47:10,594
You wanted for nothing!

889
00:47:10,629 --> 00:47:12,346
I washed you.

890
00:47:12,381 --> 00:47:13,597
I cleaned your clothes.

891
00:47:13,632 --> 00:47:14,848
I bought you new ones.

892
00:47:14,883 --> 00:47:17,217
It was always
the right temperature for you,

893
00:47:17,252 --> 00:47:19,102
becauseimade it so for you.

894
00:47:19,137 --> 00:47:20,354
And who defended you...

895
00:47:20,389 --> 00:47:21,605
and who defended your deeds

896
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:22,856
against the thousands
who saw you?

897
00:47:22,891 --> 00:47:25,859
And when mr. Ferguson
sold the museum

898
00:47:25,894 --> 00:47:27,728
who spoke up for you?

899
00:47:27,763 --> 00:47:29,112
Who wanted you?

900
00:47:29,147 --> 00:47:30,364
Me!

901
00:47:30,399 --> 00:47:32,232
I was the best friend
you ever had.

902
00:47:32,267 --> 00:47:33,984
Now...

903
00:47:34,618 --> 00:47:38,372
now, what have you done for me?

904
00:47:38,407 --> 00:47:40,240
You've murdered mr. Ferguson.

905
00:47:40,275 --> 00:47:42,743
He was the only,
only man who was my friend.

906
00:47:42,778 --> 00:47:45,879
He was my best friend.

907
00:47:45,914 --> 00:47:47,748
And the books are right.

908
00:47:47,783 --> 00:47:48,999
The books areright.

909
00:47:49,034 --> 00:47:50,884
You are monsters,
all of you...

910
00:47:50,919 --> 00:47:52,753
you're heartless

911
00:47:52,788 --> 00:47:54,638
heartless monsters.

912
00:47:54,673 --> 00:47:56,506
All of you,
through and through.

913
00:47:56,541 --> 00:47:57,758
I'm going to punish
you all for this.

914
00:47:58,392 --> 00:47:59,643
I'll break you
into little pieces.

915
00:47:59,678 --> 00:48:02,145
I'll turn up the heat
so that you'll melt down

916
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:03,397
into little pools of wax.

917
00:48:03,432 --> 00:48:04,765
That's what i'm going to do.

918
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:08,518
It'll be no less
than you deserve.

919
00:48:08,553 --> 00:48:09,770
All right.

920
00:48:09,805 --> 00:48:11,021
Now.

921
00:48:12,906 --> 00:48:15,409
Which one of you is first?

922
00:48:18,662 --> 00:48:23,033
Which one of you is first?

923
00:48:23,068 --> 00:48:24,284
You!

924
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:25,535
Landru.

925
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:30,540
Because you murdered
mr. Ferguson.

926
00:48:34,428 --> 00:48:36,680
No!
No, it was not i
who garroted

927
00:48:36,715 --> 00:48:38,548
your friend,
martin senescu.
No.

928
00:48:38,583 --> 00:48:39,800
It was you!

929
00:48:39,835 --> 00:48:41,051
No, you killed him

930
00:48:41,086 --> 00:48:42,936
while i was upstairs
making tea. No!

931
00:48:42,971 --> 00:48:45,439
No, martin senescu,
it was you-

932
00:48:45,474 --> 00:48:46,056
you murdered
your wife.

933
00:48:46,091 --> 00:48:49,810
You killed her...
while i was asleep.

934
00:48:49,845 --> 00:48:51,695
It was you who used my ax
to kill your wife's brother.

935
00:48:51,730 --> 00:48:53,563
No.

936
00:48:53,598 --> 00:48:54,314
Not so,
martin senescu.

937
00:48:54,349 --> 00:48:56,199
No, you're-you're
the murderers.

938
00:48:56,234 --> 00:48:58,201
No, no!

939
00:48:58,236 --> 00:48:59,820
You are the murderer,
you killed them all.

940
00:48:59,855 --> 00:49:00,954
No, you killed...
it was
always you.

941
00:49:00,989 --> 00:49:02,823
You're the murderers!
No! Martin
senescu.

942
00:49:02,858 --> 00:49:03,573
You're
the murderers.

943
00:49:03,608 --> 00:49:04,207
It was you...

944
00:49:11,715 --> 00:49:12,966
and here, ladies
and gentlemen,

945
00:49:13,001 --> 00:49:14,835
we have jack
the ripper-

946
00:49:14,870 --> 00:49:16,720
the one murderer

947
00:49:16,755 --> 00:49:18,722
who was never caught.

948
00:49:18,757 --> 00:49:23,593
And now we come to a man
who only recently

949
00:49:23,628 --> 00:49:26,730
became one
of the most famous of all.

950
00:49:26,765 --> 00:49:31,101
Martin lombard senescu...

951
00:49:31,136 --> 00:49:35,489
a remarkable and certainly
most versatile murderer.

952
00:49:35,524 --> 00:49:38,608
Who knows what thoughts
went through his mind

953
00:49:38,643 --> 00:49:40,494
as he dug the graves

954
00:49:40,529 --> 00:49:43,613
for his wife, emma,

955
00:49:43,648 --> 00:49:45,499
whom he killed with a knife...

956
00:49:45,534 --> 00:49:49,252
his wife's brother, david,

957
00:49:49,287 --> 00:49:51,121
whose skull was split

958
00:49:51,755 --> 00:49:54,257
with an ax...

959
00:49:54,292 --> 00:49:58,628
or his friend and employer
for 30 years,

960
00:49:58,663 --> 00:50:00,514
ernest ferguson.

961
00:50:00,549 --> 00:50:04,885
The new exhibit became
very popular at marchand's.

962
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:06,136
But of all the figures,

963
00:50:06,171 --> 00:50:09,272
none was ever regarded
with more dread

964
00:50:09,307 --> 00:50:11,775
than that
of martin lombard senescu.

965
00:50:11,810 --> 00:50:14,895
It was something
about the eyes, people said.

966
00:50:14,930 --> 00:50:16,780
It's the look
that one often gets

967
00:50:16,815 --> 00:50:19,282
after taking a quick walk

968
00:50:19,317 --> 00:50:22,402
through the twilight zone.

969
00:50:26,573 --> 00:50:29,076
Next ontwilight zone
a trip back into time

970
00:50:29,111 --> 00:50:30,961
with albert salmi,
john anderson

971
00:50:30,996 --> 00:50:32,829
and guest star julie newmar.

972
00:50:32,864 --> 00:50:35,966
But this trip is very offbeat,
very adventuresome

973
00:50:36,001 --> 00:50:38,468
and totally unexpected
itinerary.

974
00:50:38,503 --> 00:50:40,971
It's called "of late i think
of cliffordville."

975
00:50:41,006 --> 00:50:43,223
You send me back in time.

976
00:50:43,258 --> 00:50:44,474
Send back to cliffordville.

977
00:50:44,509 --> 00:50:48,228
But i want to look exactly as
i did then. That's number one.

978
00:50:48,263 --> 00:50:49,229
Agreed.

979
00:50:49,264 --> 00:50:50,480
Number two,

980
00:50:50,515 --> 00:50:52,482
i want to have a memory
of everything

981
00:50:52,517 --> 00:50:54,351
that's occurred in the last
50 years.

982
00:50:54,386 --> 00:50:57,487
I don't want that memory
impaired on bit.

983
00:50:57,522 --> 00:50:59,356
Check again, mr. Feathersmith.

984
00:50:59,391 --> 00:51:01,742
I want it to happen right away.

985
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:14,755
Cliffordville.

986
00:51:15,372 --> 00:51:17,257
This stop
is cliffordville.

987
00:51:17,292 --> 00:51:19,760
Cliffordville?

988
00:51:19,795 --> 00:51:24,014
The devil you say.
