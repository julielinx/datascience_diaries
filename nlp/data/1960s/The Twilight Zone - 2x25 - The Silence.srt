1
00:00:11,162 --> 00:00:12,996
You're traveling
through another dimension

2
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:16,750
a dimension not only
of sight and sound, but of mind

3
00:00:16,785 --> 00:00:18,001
a journey into a wondrous land

4
00:00:18,036 --> 00:00:19,886
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

5
00:00:19,921 --> 00:00:21,638
That's the signpost up ahead.

6
00:00:21,673 --> 00:00:24,140
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

7
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,396
Well, i can tell you
gentlemen

8
00:00:29,431 --> 00:00:32,515
the most idiotic thing
occurred in the market today.

9
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:35,018
Just idiotic. I've been
dabbling in the syndicate.

10
00:00:35,652 --> 00:00:37,520
It has some oil holdings
in texas.

11
00:00:37,555 --> 00:00:40,023
Jack brewer handles
our new york operation.

12
00:00:40,058 --> 00:00:43,777
He came on the floor today-
i just happened to be there.

13
00:00:43,812 --> 00:00:45,662
This was about
10:30 this morning.

14
00:00:45,697 --> 00:00:48,164
He has a sheaf of
papers in his hand

15
00:00:48,199 --> 00:00:49,416
he waves to me.

16
00:00:49,451 --> 00:00:51,918
Now, if there is anybody
that i don't want

17
00:00:51,953 --> 00:00:53,787
to see before noon
on any given day

18
00:00:53,822 --> 00:00:55,672
it is jack brewer.

19
00:00:55,707 --> 00:00:58,792
He's a raucous sort,
a little crude, nouveau riche-

20
00:00:58,827 --> 00:01:00,043
you know the type.

21
00:01:00,078 --> 00:01:02,545
Charlie, old man, you don't mind
if i sit here, do you, boy?

22
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:03,546
Well,
where was i?

23
00:01:03,581 --> 00:01:04,798
Oh, yes,
jack brewer.

24
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:07,300
He, uh, walks across
the floor to me

25
00:01:07,335 --> 00:01:09,185
and with an
intense voice-

26
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:12,305
a voice absolutely
shaking with intensity-

27
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,190
he sidles up to me
and he whispers...

28
00:01:14,225 --> 00:01:16,059
he's got the most miserable
habit of whispering-

29
00:01:16,094 --> 00:01:18,561
sotto voce- so that everyone
in the world can hear him.

30
00:01:18,596 --> 00:01:21,064
Anyway, he says to me "jim,

31
00:01:21,099 --> 00:01:22,315
"i must scrape up
a quarter of a million

32
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,701
and you're the only one
that can handle it for me."

33
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:26,569
Now, this is brewer speaking
to me.

34
00:01:26,604 --> 00:01:28,455
A quarter of
a million dollars!

35
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:30,573
And i am supposed
to scrape it up for him.

36
00:01:30,608 --> 00:01:32,459
I mean, i am supposed
to scrape it up

37
00:01:32,494 --> 00:01:34,327
as though it were
some kind of residue

38
00:01:34,362 --> 00:01:36,830
that could be literally
scooped up off a floor!

39
00:01:36,865 --> 00:01:37,714
To make a long
story short

40
00:01:37,749 --> 00:01:40,216
he arrives at the busiest
time of the morning

41
00:01:40,251 --> 00:01:41,468
absolutely the
busiest time

42
00:01:41,503 --> 00:01:42,719
and he says to me

43
00:01:42,754 --> 00:01:45,221
"jim, i've got an opportunity to corner..."

44
00:01:45,256 --> 00:01:47,090
i just got your letter.

45
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:49,592
Shh! Our young friend
is discoursing again.

46
00:01:49,627 --> 00:01:51,478
Well, of course i looked a
little askance at him

47
00:01:52,095 --> 00:01:53,980
because the boor wouldn't know
a corner of the market

48
00:01:54,015 --> 00:01:55,231
from a railroad roundhouse!

49
00:01:55,266 --> 00:01:57,984
The only thing worse
than his talking so much

50
00:01:58,019 --> 00:01:59,853
is his transparency.

51
00:01:59,888 --> 00:02:03,606
In about 30 seconds, alfred,
he will very nonchalantly ask

52
00:02:03,641 --> 00:02:06,109
for a loan from
anybody within earshot.

53
00:02:06,144 --> 00:02:07,360
Just last week he asked me

54
00:02:07,395 --> 00:02:10,497
for the loan of a quarter
of a million dollars.

55
00:02:10,532 --> 00:02:12,365
The letter you sent me

56
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,868
is the most incredible
thing i have ever read.

57
00:02:14,903 --> 00:02:16,753
Archie, we're
old friends.

58
00:02:16,788 --> 00:02:18,004
I must tell you...

59
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:19,255
my communication to you

60
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:22,375
was not as an old friend,
but as my lawyer.

61
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:26,129
Is the wager
i have in mind legal?

62
00:02:26,164 --> 00:02:28,631
No wager is legal
in this state.

63
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:30,517
Well, is it against
the law, then?

64
00:02:30,552 --> 00:02:32,385
Anything criminal in it?

65
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,888
I don't see anything
criminal in it, no.

66
00:02:34,923 --> 00:02:39,025
Alfred, that is exactly
what i wanted to hear from you.

67
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:47,150
Franklin, would you take
this note across the room

68
00:02:47,185 --> 00:02:49,035
to young mr. Tennyson
over there.

69
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,153
Archie...

70
00:02:50,188 --> 00:02:51,404
you tell him
it's from me.

71
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:53,289
Ask him to read it
immediately.

72
00:02:53,324 --> 00:02:55,041
Why, yes, sir.

73
00:02:56,292 --> 00:03:00,046
The note that this man
is carrying across a club room

74
00:03:00,081 --> 00:03:01,915
is in the form
of a proposed wager

75
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:05,668
but it's the kind of wager
that comes without precedent.

76
00:03:05,703 --> 00:03:08,171
It stands alone
in the annals of bet making

77
00:03:08,206 --> 00:03:10,924
as the strangest game of chance
ever offered

78
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,175
by one man to another.

79
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:15,311
In just a moment,
we'll see the terms of the wager

80
00:03:15,346 --> 00:03:17,814
and what young
mr. Tennyson does about it.

81
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:19,682
And in the process

82
00:03:19,717 --> 00:03:22,185
we'll witness all parties
spin a wheel of chance

83
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:25,939
in a very bizarre casino
called the twilight zone.

84
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:31,494
Do you know whaticould do

85
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:34,614
with a quarter of a million
dollars in a deal like this?

86
00:03:34,649 --> 00:03:37,116
Well, i can tell you this-
i could treble it, quadruple it.

87
00:03:37,151 --> 00:03:38,001
Why, with an initial
investment

88
00:03:38,036 --> 00:03:39,252
of a quarter of a
million dollars...

89
00:03:39,869 --> 00:03:41,254
i could take this
plastics thing...

90
00:03:41,871 --> 00:03:43,122
excuse me,
mr. Tennyson.

91
00:03:43,157 --> 00:03:45,008
A note for you
from colonel taylor.

92
00:03:45,043 --> 00:03:46,876
Just put it down
somewhere, franklin.

93
00:03:46,911 --> 00:03:50,013
Excuse me, mr. Tennyson,
his instructions are

94
00:03:50,048 --> 00:03:51,264
that you read
it immediately.

95
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:53,766
I beg your pardon.

96
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:08,398
Acts like he had
seen a ghost.

97
00:04:08,433 --> 00:04:10,900
This is... this is
absolute nonsense.

98
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:14,287
What about it, tennyson?

99
00:04:14,322 --> 00:04:15,538
Is this some
kind of a joke?

100
00:04:15,573 --> 00:04:18,041
I mean, really, colonel,
if it is a joke,

101
00:04:18,076 --> 00:04:19,909
it suggests a sense of
humor quite beyond me.

102
00:04:19,944 --> 00:04:21,794
It isnota joke.

103
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:24,914
You know me
reasonably well, tennyson.

104
00:04:24,949 --> 00:04:26,416
You know that
humor is perhaps

105
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:29,552
the least developed
aspect of my character.

106
00:04:29,587 --> 00:04:31,421
I am quite serious.

107
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:38,678
Would you mind
terribly, tennyson

108
00:04:38,713 --> 00:04:41,814
if i acquainted the members
with my proposition?

109
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:45,935
Well, that's your business,
colonel, quite your business.

110
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:48,438
But i do believe that you will

111
00:04:48,473 --> 00:04:50,189
make yourself
highly suspect.

112
00:04:50,224 --> 00:04:52,692
I'll take that risk.

113
00:04:55,578 --> 00:04:58,698
I propose a wager
to mr. Tennyson here.

114
00:04:58,733 --> 00:05:01,200
The wager is to take
the following form.

115
00:05:01,235 --> 00:05:04,954
I will bet him $500,000...

116
00:05:06,874 --> 00:05:09,959
that he cannot remain
silent for one year.

117
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:14,347
The wager carries with it
the following conditions:

118
00:05:14,382 --> 00:05:16,849
He will be placed
in a room for observation

119
00:05:16,884 --> 00:05:19,969
by me or by any one of us,
at our discretion.

120
00:05:20,004 --> 00:05:22,855
He will be furnished
with anything he desires

121
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,107
by way of diversion.

122
00:05:24,142 --> 00:05:29,862
But he will not be able to speak
one single word for 12 months

123
00:05:29,897 --> 00:05:31,731
not one single word.

124
00:05:31,766 --> 00:05:34,233
He will make
his wants known

125
00:05:34,268 --> 00:05:36,736
in writing,
not by voice.

126
00:05:37,987 --> 00:05:39,872
What about it, tennyson?

127
00:05:41,124 --> 00:05:44,243
Well, may i ask what is
the reason for this wager?

128
00:05:44,278 --> 00:05:47,997
What i'm about to say might
horrify the average person

129
00:05:48,032 --> 00:05:51,134
but to someone
as insensitive as you

130
00:05:51,169 --> 00:05:53,386
it probably won't
mean a thing.

131
00:05:57,006 --> 00:06:00,760
I dislike you
intensely, tennyson.

132
00:06:00,795 --> 00:06:04,514
It goes much beyond
the ordinary distaste

133
00:06:04,549 --> 00:06:07,650
i feel for someone
without breeding

134
00:06:07,685 --> 00:06:10,770
without principles,
without manners.

135
00:06:10,805 --> 00:06:13,272
Your voice has become
intolerable.

136
00:06:13,307 --> 00:06:17,026
I sit here each night and
the sound of it makes me wince!

137
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:22,532
I cannot ask you
to resign from the club.

138
00:06:22,567 --> 00:06:24,417
I haven't got that right.

139
00:06:24,452 --> 00:06:26,285
So it occurred to me

140
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:30,673
that i'd be willing
to offer a large sum of money

141
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:33,176
just to have some quiet.

142
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:36,679
You see, tennyson

143
00:06:36,714 --> 00:06:39,182
you could not possibly
remain silent for a year.

144
00:06:39,217 --> 00:06:41,050
It's not in your nature.

145
00:06:41,085 --> 00:06:46,055
You're a shallow, talkative,
empty-headed ne'er-do-well

146
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:49,192
and to remain silent
would destroy you.

147
00:06:49,227 --> 00:06:51,694
So what i assume
will happen

148
00:06:51,729 --> 00:06:54,814
you will perhaps
withstand the pressures

149
00:06:54,849 --> 00:06:57,950
for three or four weeks,
maybe a couple of months

150
00:06:57,985 --> 00:06:59,819
and then you will succumb.

151
00:06:59,854 --> 00:07:02,321
That's, again,
your nature.

152
00:07:02,356 --> 00:07:05,575
In the meantime, i will derive

153
00:07:06,209 --> 00:07:09,962
oh, several months
of exquisite silence.

154
00:07:13,117 --> 00:07:14,967
Well, tennyson

155
00:07:15,002 --> 00:07:17,470
does it appeal to
your sporting blood?

156
00:07:17,505 --> 00:07:20,590
Oddly enough, it does
appeal to my sporting blood.

157
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:23,092
Now, that, too,
is patently ridiculous.

158
00:07:23,127 --> 00:07:26,229
There's nothing sporting
about you, tennyson.

159
00:07:26,264 --> 00:07:28,097
I happen to know
you're delivering

160
00:07:28,132 --> 00:07:29,982
your nightly
financial folderol

161
00:07:30,017 --> 00:07:31,851
because you're in
desperate straits.

162
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:34,353
You've run through
your inheritance

163
00:07:34,388 --> 00:07:36,239
your debts are
insurmountable

164
00:07:36,274 --> 00:07:38,741
and you'd do practically
anything for money.

165
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:43,746
Except, perhaps, to
remain silent for a year.

166
00:07:43,781 --> 00:07:47,366
If this were europe, or the
company were more sophisticated

167
00:07:47,401 --> 00:07:49,869
i should be forced
to invite you out

168
00:07:49,904 --> 00:07:51,754
for the things
you've said to me.

169
00:07:51,789 --> 00:07:53,623
The ground rules
here, however

170
00:07:53,658 --> 00:07:54,874
are different.

171
00:07:54,909 --> 00:07:58,628
I can either ignore you
or call your bluff.

172
00:07:58,663 --> 00:08:01,130
Well, i choose to do the latter.

173
00:08:01,165 --> 00:08:03,633
I accept your wager.

174
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:09,772
Uh, just a few questions.

175
00:08:09,807 --> 00:08:11,390
Where am i to be
incarcerated?

176
00:08:11,425 --> 00:08:14,527
Well, in the old
game room downstairs.

177
00:08:14,562 --> 00:08:15,778
It isn't being used.

178
00:08:15,813 --> 00:08:18,898
With the permission of
the board of governors

179
00:08:18,933 --> 00:08:20,783
i'll have some work
done on it.

180
00:08:20,818 --> 00:08:24,537
You'll be in a glass-enclosed
living room and bedroom.

181
00:08:24,572 --> 00:08:27,039
Microphones will be
placed around the room

182
00:08:27,074 --> 00:08:29,542
which you are
to leave untouched.

183
00:08:29,577 --> 00:08:31,410
Your every movement
will be recorded

184
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:35,798
and so will your voice
when you decide to give up.

185
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:38,668
You will permit me
or any one of us

186
00:08:38,703 --> 00:08:42,421
to observe you
at any time.

187
00:08:42,456 --> 00:08:45,558
When, uh, is this
supposed to start?

188
00:08:45,593 --> 00:08:48,427
Well, the room could be
prepared by tomorrow night.

189
00:08:48,462 --> 00:08:50,930
I've made all
the necessary inquiries.

190
00:08:50,965 --> 00:08:53,432
You could enter
anytime after 10:00 p.m.

191
00:08:53,467 --> 00:08:58,437
And so, at 10:00 p.m.,
june 3, 1962

192
00:08:58,472 --> 00:09:01,574
you may leave the room.

193
00:09:01,609 --> 00:09:03,075
At that time
i will have

194
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:06,195
a check for $500,000
waiting for you

195
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:09,949
assuming, of course,
that the impossible happens

196
00:09:09,984 --> 00:09:13,703
and you're able to remain silent
for those 12 months.

197
00:09:14,704 --> 00:09:16,589
I'll be back tomorrow night.

198
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:22,211
Uh, colonel, i would like
to have that check certified

199
00:09:22,246 --> 00:09:24,096
and placed on deposit
in my name

200
00:09:24,714 --> 00:09:25,965
a photostat of it available

201
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,101
and witnessed
by every member of this club.

202
00:09:29,136 --> 00:09:31,604
That might be
the usual procedure

203
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:34,724
in a fish market or a pawn shop

204
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:37,860
but not in this club
and not with me.

205
00:09:37,895 --> 00:09:39,729
My credit is well-known

206
00:09:39,764 --> 00:09:43,115
so is my honor, as every
member here will vouch for.

207
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:46,619
There will be no check
placed on deposit.

208
00:09:46,654 --> 00:09:49,739
You'll have to take my word.

209
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:53,492
I see.

210
00:09:53,527 --> 00:09:56,629
It's my courage
against your credit.

211
00:09:56,664 --> 00:09:58,497
Well, a year
from tomorrow night

212
00:09:58,532 --> 00:10:01,634
both can be proved.

213
00:10:01,669 --> 00:10:03,386
Franklin,
get me my coat.

214
00:10:03,421 --> 00:10:04,637
Yes, sir.

215
00:10:15,264 --> 00:10:19,652
Tennyson, i've known colonel
taylor for a long time.

216
00:10:19,687 --> 00:10:22,154
This is not
a capricious man.

217
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:25,908
I warn you,
he is in deadly earnest.

218
00:10:25,943 --> 00:10:28,411
Do you know
my wife, sir?

219
00:10:28,446 --> 00:10:29,662
Her name is doris.

220
00:10:29,697 --> 00:10:33,416
She's a lovely thing-
frail, beautiful, fragile.

221
00:10:33,451 --> 00:10:35,284
Like a cameo brooch

222
00:10:35,319 --> 00:10:38,421
but her tastes run
to unfragile things-

223
00:10:38,456 --> 00:10:40,923
sizable baubles to
sizable price tags.

224
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:44,677
She shops at tiffany's the way
other women enter a supermarket.

225
00:10:44,712 --> 00:10:47,179
My miserable
misfortune is

226
00:10:47,214 --> 00:10:50,299
that i happen to be very
much in love with her.

227
00:10:50,334 --> 00:10:53,436
I am also desperate
in need of money.

228
00:10:53,471 --> 00:10:57,807
I may sound melodramatic,
but it happens to be true.

229
00:11:19,962 --> 00:11:23,082
Any time now, mr. Tennyson.

230
00:11:23,117 --> 00:11:24,967
Any time.

231
00:12:03,706 --> 00:12:06,208
Oh, mr. Tennyson's
dinner, hmm?

232
00:12:06,243 --> 00:12:06,842
Yes, sir.

233
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,345
Is he eating well,
appetite good?

234
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:12,465
Not very much up
to a week ago, sir

235
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,350
but he's eating
very well now.

236
00:12:14,385 --> 00:12:15,468
Well, that's nice.

237
00:12:15,503 --> 00:12:18,604
And i hope he stays
in perfect health.

238
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,473
I wouldn't want
this experience

239
00:12:20,508 --> 00:12:22,358
to damage him
in any way.

240
00:12:22,725 --> 00:12:23,976
Quite the contrary, sir.

241
00:12:24,011 --> 00:12:25,861
He seems in
excellent spirits

242
00:12:25,896 --> 00:12:27,730
and it's nine weeks
now, sir

243
00:12:28,364 --> 00:12:30,866
nine weeks today that
he's been in there.

244
00:12:30,901 --> 00:12:31,617
Nine weeks?

245
00:12:31,652 --> 00:12:34,737
Well, that's really
quite incredible.

246
00:12:34,772 --> 00:12:36,622
I gave him
four weeks

247
00:12:36,657 --> 00:12:40,743
possibly, to hold out,
six at the outside.

248
00:12:40,778 --> 00:12:41,994
Nine weeks!

249
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:45,131
There's a little bit
more gristle there

250
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:46,999
than i gave him
credit for.

251
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:10,156
Will there be
anything else, sir?

252
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:10,332
Oh, hello, alfred.

253
00:14:10,367 --> 00:14:12,218
Franklin told me
you were waiting.

254
00:14:12,835 --> 00:14:14,720
Only to pose this
question to you.

255
00:14:14,755 --> 00:14:17,223
Very succinct,
archie, very brief.

256
00:14:17,258 --> 00:14:18,474
How long?

257
00:14:18,509 --> 00:14:19,725
How long what?

258
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,228
How long are you
going to keep on

259
00:14:22,263 --> 00:14:24,730
with this... this
prolonged practical joke?

260
00:14:24,765 --> 00:14:26,599
Well, not much longer.

261
00:14:26,634 --> 00:14:28,484
Thank you, franklin.

262
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:30,986
You should see
our boy down there.

263
00:14:31,021 --> 00:14:34,106
Four and a half months,
not a sound out of him.

264
00:14:34,141 --> 00:14:35,357
It's incredible.

265
00:14:35,392 --> 00:14:37,860
That fop won't take it
for another month.

266
00:14:37,895 --> 00:14:39,745
This i'll guarantee you.

267
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:42,865
For your sake,
i hope that's the case.

268
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,750
Mysake?

269
00:14:44,785 --> 00:14:47,870
You have
the money, archie?

270
00:14:47,905 --> 00:14:49,755
I find that
insulting, alfred.

271
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,624
I'm sorry if it is.

272
00:14:51,659 --> 00:14:54,126
I think he's going
to beat you, archie.

273
00:14:54,161 --> 00:14:56,011
I think that boy
down there

274
00:14:56,046 --> 00:14:59,131
is going to remain silent
for the entire year.

275
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:02,885
And i think you're
going to owe him $500,000.

276
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:06,639
I just hope you've got it.

277
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:29,161
You can hear me,
tennyson, can't you?

278
00:15:29,196 --> 00:15:32,298
I've been giving this
considerable thought.

279
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:36,051
You fulfilled your part
of the bargain admirably.

280
00:15:36,086 --> 00:15:37,670
As a matter of fact

281
00:15:37,705 --> 00:15:40,806
you have completely
surprised me, tennyson.

282
00:15:40,841 --> 00:15:42,057
But the fact is

283
00:15:42,092 --> 00:15:45,177
i feel the whole thing
has gone too far.

284
00:15:45,212 --> 00:15:48,314
It's becoming inhuman.

285
00:15:48,349 --> 00:15:51,684
I'm prepared to offer you
a thousand dollars

286
00:15:51,719 --> 00:15:53,569
and you may walk out today

287
00:15:53,604 --> 00:15:56,689
right this moment,
if you choose.

288
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:27,603
It's going to be an early spring
this year, tennyson.

289
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,471
You ought to see it.

290
00:16:31,974 --> 00:16:33,859
In that time of the year

291
00:16:33,894 --> 00:16:36,362
when a young man's
fancy lightly turns...

292
00:16:36,397 --> 00:16:39,481
well, you know that
better than i do.

293
00:16:39,516 --> 00:16:42,484
And young ladies, too.

294
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:43,736
For example

295
00:16:43,771 --> 00:16:44,987
your wife.

296
00:16:47,489 --> 00:16:51,243
She must be lonely
for you, tennyson

297
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:53,746
desperately lonely.

298
00:16:53,781 --> 00:16:56,248
As a matter of fact,
she...

299
00:16:56,283 --> 00:16:59,385
she has been seen
with other young men.

300
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,636
It's odd

301
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:02,888
she hasn't paid you a visit,
isn't it?

302
00:17:02,923 --> 00:17:04,757
Don't you think it's odd?

303
00:17:04,792 --> 00:17:07,893
I happen to know
you've written her many notes

304
00:17:07,928 --> 00:17:09,144
requesting a visit.

305
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:14,149
She hasn't responded,
even to the notes.

306
00:17:16,018 --> 00:17:18,520
You may lose
your wife, tennyson.

307
00:17:18,555 --> 00:17:21,023
I hope you're fully
aware of that.

308
00:17:21,058 --> 00:17:22,908
While you stay here
behind glass

309
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:25,411
the very reason
for all your agony

310
00:17:25,446 --> 00:17:27,279
may be slipping
away from you.

311
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:32,284
Why don't you leave, tennyson?

312
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:34,169
Why don't you leave right now?

313
00:17:34,204 --> 00:17:37,923
It still might be possible
to save your marriage.

314
00:17:57,559 --> 00:18:01,697
Tennyson, i saw
your wife again.

315
00:18:01,732 --> 00:18:04,817
She was getting into
a little european sports car.

316
00:18:04,852 --> 00:18:08,570
There was a, you know,
a nice young fellow driving it.

317
00:18:08,605 --> 00:18:12,324
Your wife... wife... your
wife... wife... wife... wife.

318
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:14,827
Today is april fools' day,
tennyson.

319
00:18:14,862 --> 00:18:17,329
You remember april fools' day.

320
00:18:17,364 --> 00:18:19,214
I think it was named for you

321
00:18:19,249 --> 00:18:23,585
for only a fool would stay
in there as long as you have

322
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:27,339
knowing precisely what's
happening on the outside.

323
00:18:27,374 --> 00:18:33,595
Your wife, i mean, tennyson,
your wife... wife... wife.

324
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:37,983
Tennyson, this nonsense
must cease!

325
00:18:38,018 --> 00:18:39,234
You've got
to get out of there.

326
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:40,486
You really do.

327
00:18:40,521 --> 00:18:44,239
Why i could tell you some
stories about your wife.

328
00:18:46,742 --> 00:18:47,993
How about it, tennyson?

329
00:18:48,028 --> 00:18:51,113
I might see my way clear
to giving you $5,000.

330
00:18:51,148 --> 00:18:54,249
That would pay off
a lot of your debts.

331
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:57,369
And a little bracelet
for your wife.

332
00:18:57,404 --> 00:19:02,257
Something to compensate
for the months of loneliness.

333
00:19:02,292 --> 00:19:03,509
How about it, tennyson?

334
00:19:03,544 --> 00:19:04,760
$5,000.

335
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:09,131
$6,000, tennyson.

336
00:19:11,633 --> 00:19:15,387
You're an idiot, you
know that, tennyson?!

337
00:19:15,422 --> 00:19:17,890
You're going out of
your mind in there.

338
00:19:17,925 --> 00:19:19,525
I know you are.

339
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,776
You're ready to crawl up
the walls.

340
00:19:20,811 --> 00:19:23,779
Listen, tennyson, you cannot
stay in there one more hour.

341
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:26,281
Not another half hour.

342
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:34,406
I wouldn't have
believed it.

343
00:19:34,441 --> 00:19:35,657
A year
in that room

344
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:38,160
and not one word
out of him.

345
00:19:38,195 --> 00:19:40,662
Two minutes is all
the poor devil has got now-

346
00:19:41,296 --> 00:19:41,914
two more minutes.

347
00:19:41,949 --> 00:19:43,165
Look at archie.

348
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,301
Not the face of a happy man, would you say?

349
00:19:46,336 --> 00:19:49,421
A rather monumental occasion,
isn't it, archie?

350
00:19:49,456 --> 00:19:53,175
12 months ago to the moment
you destroyed yourself

351
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:55,677
much as i told you you would.

352
00:19:55,712 --> 00:19:58,814
Your little reminders
are gratuitous, alfred.

353
00:19:58,849 --> 00:20:00,682
Besides, it's
not yet 10:00.

354
00:20:00,717 --> 00:20:03,185
Whether it is
or whether it isn't

355
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,687
the destruction
i'm talking about

356
00:20:05,722 --> 00:20:06,939
has already
taken place.

357
00:20:06,974 --> 00:20:09,441
There have been
ugly rumors, archie

358
00:20:09,476 --> 00:20:11,326
things you've
done to him

359
00:20:11,361 --> 00:20:13,829
like little
asides, innuendos

360
00:20:13,864 --> 00:20:16,949
suggestions, gossip
about his wife.

361
00:20:16,984 --> 00:20:20,085
You place such a premium
on honor, archie

362
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:23,205
but you haven't acted
like an honorable man.

363
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:26,341
Please don't go to the
trouble of denying it.

364
00:20:26,376 --> 00:20:28,210
I'm sure much of it
is true.

365
00:20:28,245 --> 00:20:30,712
But the ugly affair
has proved two things

366
00:20:30,747 --> 00:20:31,964
hasn't it, archie?

367
00:20:31,999 --> 00:20:33,849
That that boy down
there is stronger

368
00:20:33,884 --> 00:20:35,717
than you gave him
credit for

369
00:20:35,752 --> 00:20:38,854
and you are
considerably weaker.

370
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:41,974
How could he have done it?

371
00:20:42,009 --> 00:20:43,859
How could he
have done it?

372
00:20:45,727 --> 00:20:47,613
It's impossible!

373
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:39,414
You, uh, have me at
a disadvantage, mr. Tennyson.

374
00:21:40,782 --> 00:21:44,536
In a rather
compromising situation.

375
00:21:44,571 --> 00:21:50,792
You force me into a position
of... rather distasteful candor.

376
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:55,797
The truth is i am a fraud.

377
00:21:55,832 --> 00:21:57,683
I haven't
any money.

378
00:21:57,718 --> 00:22:02,054
I offered you a thousand
dollars, then $5,000.

379
00:22:02,089 --> 00:22:05,190
I would have had to go out
into the street

380
00:22:05,225 --> 00:22:09,561
to beg even that amount, let
alone a half a million dollars.

381
00:22:10,812 --> 00:22:13,315
It's true that i have pride

382
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:17,069
bearing, taste,
exceptional breeding...

383
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:21,456
but i lost
most of my money

384
00:22:21,491 --> 00:22:23,325
some years ago.

385
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:32,084
Now you have forced me
to uncover the situation

386
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:35,837
proving, mr. Tennyson,
proving that, of the two of us

387
00:22:35,872 --> 00:22:40,225
you are by far
the more substantial.

388
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,099
And i will naturally resign.

389
00:22:47,134 --> 00:22:50,235
I will not ask you to suffer
my presence any longer.

390
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:55,357
Tennyson, you can talk,
your time is up.

391
00:22:55,991 --> 00:23:00,362
You can talk, gurgle, sing,
chortle, anything you want.

392
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:05,867
What's
he writing?

393
00:23:05,902 --> 00:23:07,119
What is
he doing?

394
00:23:07,154 --> 00:23:09,004
Why doesn't
he talk?

395
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:14,376
What does it
say, archie?

396
00:23:14,411 --> 00:23:15,627
What did
he write?

397
00:23:15,662 --> 00:23:17,512
Why didn't he
say something?

398
00:23:22,517 --> 00:23:24,386
"I knew i would not
be able to keep

399
00:23:24,421 --> 00:23:26,271
"my part of the bargain...

400
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,642
"so one year ago
i had the nerves

401
00:23:30,677 --> 00:23:33,145
to my vocal
chords severed."

402
00:23:42,537 --> 00:23:45,657
Mr. Jamie tennyson
who almost won a bet

403
00:23:45,692 --> 00:23:48,160
but who discovered
somewhat belatedly

404
00:23:48,195 --> 00:23:51,296
that gambling can be
a most unproductive pursuit

405
00:23:51,331 --> 00:23:53,548
even with loaded dice,
marked cards

406
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:56,668
or, as in his case,
some severed vocal chords.

407
00:23:56,703 --> 00:23:59,171
For somewhere beyond him,
a wheel was turned

408
00:23:59,206 --> 00:24:01,056
and his number came up
"black 13."

409
00:24:01,091 --> 00:24:04,176
If you don't believe it,
ask the croupier

410
00:24:04,211 --> 00:24:06,061
the very special one
who handles roulette

411
00:24:06,096 --> 00:24:07,929
in the twilight zone.

412
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:16,271
Rod serling, creator
ofthe twilight zone

413
00:24:16,306 --> 00:24:18,156
will tell you
about next week's story

414
00:24:18,191 --> 00:24:21,526
after this word
from our alternate sponsor.

415
00:24:21,561 --> 00:24:23,578
And now, mr. Serling.

416
00:24:23,613 --> 00:24:24,830
Next week onthe twilight zone

417
00:24:24,865 --> 00:24:27,949
you'll sit in this courtroom and
you'll watch what is apparently

418
00:24:27,984 --> 00:24:30,452
the standard, everyday turning
of the wheels of justice.

419
00:24:30,487 --> 00:24:32,337
But because this is
the twilight zone

420
00:24:32,372 --> 00:24:34,206
don't be fooled
by the readily apparent,

421
00:24:34,241 --> 00:24:36,091
for when the judge enters,
the jury rises,

422
00:24:36,126 --> 00:24:38,593
the bailiff calls out the case,
all of this

423
00:24:38,628 --> 00:24:41,096
is the opening salvo to one
of our wildest journeys yet.

424
00:24:41,131 --> 00:24:42,964
Our program is called
"shadow play"

425
00:24:42,999 --> 00:24:44,850
and it's written
by mr. Charles beaumont.

426
00:24:44,885 --> 00:24:46,718
It comes well recommended.

entertainment on our show
