1
00:00:06,556 --> 00:00:09,693
You unlock this door
with the key of imagination.

2
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:12,062
Beyond it is another dimension-

3
00:00:12,097 --> 00:00:13,313
a dimension of sound,

4
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:16,449
a dimension of sight,

5
00:00:16,484 --> 00:00:18,318
a dimension of mind.

6
00:00:18,353 --> 00:00:21,454
You're moving into a land
of both shadow and substance,

7
00:00:21,489 --> 00:00:23,323
of things and ideas.

8
00:00:23,358 --> 00:00:27,711
You've just crossed over
into the twilight zone.

9
00:00:44,594 --> 00:00:46,479
Yes?

10
00:00:46,514 --> 00:00:48,982
Is this major kuchenko?

11
00:00:51,484 --> 00:00:52,736
Who is calling?

12
00:00:52,771 --> 00:00:57,107
This is major kuchenko,
isn't it?

13
00:00:57,142 --> 00:00:58,992
Who is calling?

14
00:00:59,027 --> 00:01:00,860
Major, you don't know me,

15
00:01:00,895 --> 00:01:02,746
but i've heard
of your recent arrival here,

16
00:01:02,781 --> 00:01:06,499
and i wanted you to know
that you have friends.

17
00:01:06,534 --> 00:01:09,619
Who is this speaking?

18
00:01:09,654 --> 00:01:12,756
Is this a friend also?

19
00:01:12,791 --> 00:01:14,624
Yes- a good friend, major.

20
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:18,378
Not known to you yet, perhaps,
but soon to become acquainted.

21
00:01:18,413 --> 00:01:20,880
May i impose upon you
to remain in your room...

22
00:01:20,915 --> 00:01:22,766
and why?

23
00:01:22,801 --> 00:01:25,885
Why do i have to
stay in my room?

24
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,137
We'll be
making contact

25
00:01:27,172 --> 00:01:29,022
with you very soon,
major.

26
00:01:29,057 --> 00:01:32,142
Your well being
is our deep concern.

27
00:01:32,177 --> 00:01:34,144
Now, kommissar?

28
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:39,783
Major, may i count on
you to show good sense?

29
00:01:39,818 --> 00:01:42,902
For your own safety,
remain in your room.

30
00:01:42,937 --> 00:01:46,656
You'll be seeing your
friends before long.

31
00:01:46,691 --> 00:01:49,159
Good-bye.

32
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:52,912
Now, kommissar.

33
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:57,300
The fox is
in the trap.

34
00:01:58,551 --> 00:02:01,671
I could make his head
leave his body

35
00:02:01,706 --> 00:02:02,922
from this distance.

36
00:02:02,957 --> 00:02:06,676
That would give you
pleasure, wouldn't it?

37
00:02:06,711 --> 00:02:09,813
A great deal
of pleasure, kommissar.

38
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:12,932
Tell me when.

39
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:17,937
Even when he lies down,
i can still aim for his head.

40
00:02:17,972 --> 00:02:19,189
Yes, i believe
it, boris.

41
00:02:19,224 --> 00:02:21,691
I know of
your prowess.

42
00:02:21,726 --> 00:02:24,194
Oh, put that gun
away for a bit.

43
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:24,828
Put it away?

44
00:02:24,863 --> 00:02:26,696
Oh, lay it aside.

45
00:02:26,731 --> 00:02:31,084
What, are we not going
to kill him?

46
00:02:31,736 --> 00:02:34,838
The impatience
of the bourgeois.

47
00:02:34,873 --> 00:02:37,957
They do not sip wine.

48
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:41,711
They gulp it down
like a soft drink.

49
00:02:41,746 --> 00:02:44,848
They do not caress women;
they devour them.

50
00:02:44,883 --> 00:02:47,967
They do not sniff at the essence
of a rare perfume.

51
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:52,972
No... they try to jam it
into their nostrils.

52
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:56,109
Boris, the gentleman will die.
Indeed, he will.

53
00:02:56,144 --> 00:02:59,229
But i want him to die
with finesse,

54
00:02:59,264 --> 00:03:02,982
with subtlety
and a degree of thought.

55
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:06,486
That is a good death.

56
00:03:06,521 --> 00:03:10,240
I did not know
there was a good death

57
00:03:10,275 --> 00:03:11,491
and a bad death.

58
00:03:11,526 --> 00:03:13,993
Uh-huh.

59
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,998
A good death is
the death of art.

60
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:21,501
A bad one is the
death of a butcher.

61
00:03:21,536 --> 00:03:23,386
You, boris,
are a butcher.

62
00:03:23,421 --> 00:03:25,889
I am an artist.

63
00:03:25,924 --> 00:03:28,391
You will have your
death tonight, boris,

64
00:03:28,426 --> 00:03:30,894
within a few hours,

65
00:03:30,929 --> 00:03:33,396
but we will have
killed with artistry

66
00:03:33,431 --> 00:03:35,265
and not with
a meat cleaver

67
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,516
or an explosive bullet

68
00:03:36,551 --> 00:03:39,018
or any other of the
butcher's tools.

69
00:03:39,053 --> 00:03:39,769
No, no.

70
00:03:39,804 --> 00:03:43,523
This death will be
like a ballet.

71
00:03:43,558 --> 00:03:47,277
A cat and a mouse.

72
00:03:47,312 --> 00:03:50,413
This is the latter-
the intended victim-

73
00:03:50,448 --> 00:03:53,533
who may or may not know
that he is to die,

74
00:03:53,568 --> 00:03:57,036
be it by butchery or ballet.

75
00:03:57,071 --> 00:03:59,539
His name is major ivan kuchenko.

76
00:03:59,574 --> 00:04:02,675
He has, if events go according
to certain plans,

77
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:05,178
perhaps three or four more hours
of living.

78
00:04:05,213 --> 00:04:08,932
But an ignorance shared by
both himself and his executioner

79
00:04:08,967 --> 00:04:12,685
is of the fact that both of them
have taken a first step

80
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,554
into the twilight zone.

81
00:04:44,167 --> 00:04:45,418
Yes?

82
00:04:45,453 --> 00:04:47,920
Major kuchenko?

83
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:50,423
Who is it?

84
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:52,308
A friend.

85
00:04:52,343 --> 00:04:53,559
Don't worry.

86
00:04:53,594 --> 00:04:56,062
Turn off the lights
if you want to,

87
00:04:56,097 --> 00:04:57,313
find a hiding place.

88
00:04:57,348 --> 00:04:59,816
I'll come in
with my hands up.

89
00:04:59,851 --> 00:05:02,935
I've got my
palms open.

90
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:19,202
Major kuchenko?

91
00:05:19,237 --> 00:05:21,087
And you are...?

92
00:05:21,122 --> 00:05:23,589
A friend.

93
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,960
May i come in?

94
00:05:32,348 --> 00:05:34,217
Thank you.

95
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:41,724
You are the one

96
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,975
i spoke to
on the telephone?

97
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,227
Mm-hmm.

98
00:05:44,262 --> 00:05:47,980
We had a brief
chat earlier.

99
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:53,619
Well, it's quite a
place you have here.

100
00:05:53,654 --> 00:05:56,739
Who occupied it
before you?

101
00:05:56,774 --> 00:05:58,624
A rat?

102
00:05:58,659 --> 00:06:00,493
I had no luxury
of choices.

103
00:06:00,528 --> 00:06:02,378
No, indeed,
you have not.

104
00:06:02,413 --> 00:06:06,132
In that respect, you are
a very poor man, major.

105
00:06:06,167 --> 00:06:08,634
But, then again,
you have a bed,

106
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:10,503
pictures on the wall,

107
00:06:10,538 --> 00:06:14,891
a carpet...
such as it is.

108
00:06:14,926 --> 00:06:18,644
Well, quite
an adequate accommodation.

109
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:21,147
Ah... and a most
wonderful view

110
00:06:21,182 --> 00:06:23,015
of a brick building
alongside.

111
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,901
Well, major,
there are worse places

112
00:06:24,936 --> 00:06:26,769
to spend an evening in.

113
00:06:26,804 --> 00:06:28,020
I know.

114
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:29,906
I have been to
many of them.

115
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:34,277
Indeed. Indeed, you have.

116
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:41,784
Siberia is quite cold, isn't it?

117
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:46,172
I've been told it has
a most unfortunate climate.

118
00:06:46,207 --> 00:06:48,040
You have been
told right.

119
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:51,177
It is a freezing
jungle.

120
00:06:51,212 --> 00:06:53,679
A freezing jungle.

121
00:06:53,714 --> 00:06:57,433
Oh, that's marvelous-
lovely imagery.

122
00:06:57,468 --> 00:07:00,553
Siberia as
a freezing jungle.

123
00:07:02,438 --> 00:07:05,558
You make reference,
of course, to the people.

124
00:07:05,593 --> 00:07:08,060
I make reference
to some people.

125
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:10,563
Oh...

126
00:07:10,598 --> 00:07:13,699
it must have been
unpleasant for you.

127
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:18,704
Sufficiently unpleasant
to motivate you

128
00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:20,573
to renounce
your native country

129
00:07:20,608 --> 00:07:23,075
and to try and seek
asylum elsewhere,

130
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,961
which brings us
up to date.

131
00:07:24,996 --> 00:07:28,714
You were
a political prisoner.

132
00:07:28,749 --> 00:07:29,966
You escaped.

133
00:07:30,001 --> 00:07:32,468
You served
a term of 12 years,

134
00:07:32,503 --> 00:07:34,971
and now you arrived here
in a neutral country,

135
00:07:35,006 --> 00:07:37,473
and you are desperately
trying to get an aircraft

136
00:07:37,508 --> 00:07:39,976
to take you out of here
to a western nation.

137
00:07:40,011 --> 00:07:46,232
But, uh... you feel
you are under surveillance?

138
00:07:47,483 --> 00:07:50,603
I know i am under
surveillance.

139
00:07:50,638 --> 00:07:51,854
Well, do you know
by whom?

140
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:54,357
Very well.

141
00:07:54,392 --> 00:07:57,493
Well, tell me.
Who are they?

142
00:07:57,528 --> 00:08:00,613
Look in the
mirror, kommissar.

143
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:10,006
Discerning, major.

144
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:12,508
You remember faces.

145
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:15,011
I remember pain.

146
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:18,764
I remember some
interrogations

147
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:21,267
that went on
for many months.

148
00:08:21,302 --> 00:08:23,135
I remember one
particular man

149
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:26,272
who smoked a long
cigarette in a holder,

150
00:08:26,307 --> 00:08:28,774
stood in a corner,
nodding and smiling

151
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:31,894
while i went from
agony to agony.

152
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:36,282
So, major...

153
00:08:36,317 --> 00:08:38,150
may we dispense
with the amenities,

154
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:40,653
the masquerades,
the little give and take

155
00:08:40,688 --> 00:08:45,041
between two strangers
feeling each other out?

156
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:51,297
Now we get to the point.

157
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,920
Did you honestly think
we would permit you

158
00:08:57,955 --> 00:09:00,423
to book passage on an aircraft
out of here?

159
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:01,674
Impossible.

160
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:03,926
As a former member
of the military

161
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:06,429
even as far back
as 12 years ago,

162
00:09:06,464 --> 00:09:09,065
you possess information
that we would find...

163
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,567
embarrassing
to have released elsewhere.

164
00:09:11,602 --> 00:09:16,572
So it's not really to our
advantage that you leave here.

165
00:09:16,607 --> 00:09:20,943
Of course, it would be simpler
and more convenient

166
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:23,446
to accompany me
back to our embassy.

167
00:09:25,448 --> 00:09:31,704
I am sick... tired and torn,
kommissar, but i am not insane.

168
00:09:31,739 --> 00:09:35,458
I would sooner cut my wrists
over a sink and bleed to death!

169
00:09:35,493 --> 00:09:36,959
No, major.

170
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:42,598
I am afraid we are of two minds
about that kind of death.

171
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:47,853
Gently, gently, major.

172
00:09:47,888 --> 00:09:49,722
Here.

173
00:09:49,757 --> 00:09:51,607
I brought some
amontillado-

174
00:09:51,642 --> 00:09:55,978
quite rare and most
pleasing to the palate.

175
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:58,364
I'm afraid
i will have to repeat

176
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,118
i am not insane.

177
00:10:02,153 --> 00:10:05,121
I'm quite aware
of what will happen to me

178
00:10:05,156 --> 00:10:06,372
if i were to drink
any of that.

179
00:10:06,407 --> 00:10:08,240
With your indulgence, major,

180
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:11,377
if you assume this to contain
cyanide or some other poison,

181
00:10:11,412 --> 00:10:13,245
you're quite wrong.

182
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,497
You see,

183
00:10:14,532 --> 00:10:18,884
i don't share
your death wish.

184
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:20,753
I'm quite a
healthy man

185
00:10:20,788 --> 00:10:22,638
with excellent
expectations

186
00:10:22,673 --> 00:10:23,889
as to my longevity.

187
00:10:23,924 --> 00:10:25,141
No, no, no, no, no.

188
00:10:25,176 --> 00:10:27,643
I was only proposing
a social drink

189
00:10:27,678 --> 00:10:30,146
between the two of us.

190
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:33,265
Iwill drink first.

191
00:10:35,151 --> 00:10:37,019
Such a ritual.

192
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:39,522
Such a tribal rite.

193
00:10:39,557 --> 00:10:42,658
Kommissar, you have
only one purpose with me.

194
00:10:42,693 --> 00:10:45,778
Why don't you try
to get it over with?

195
00:10:45,813 --> 00:10:49,532
If you want to disarm me
to get rid ofthis,

196
00:10:49,567 --> 00:10:52,034
it will take more
than a social wine.

197
00:10:52,668 --> 00:10:53,285
Yes, indeed.

198
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,422
As to my business
with you,

199
00:10:56,457 --> 00:10:58,924
we both know
what that is.

200
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,176
I am to see to it
that you are dead

201
00:11:00,211 --> 00:11:03,929
by tomorrow morning,
and you shall be, major.

202
00:11:03,964 --> 00:11:06,432
With a certain
degree of immodesty,

203
00:11:06,467 --> 00:11:07,683
i can tell you

204
00:11:07,718 --> 00:11:12,688
i have killed
800 times you,

205
00:11:12,723 --> 00:11:15,808
but i've done it
with subtlety,

206
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:19,562
with interest,
with ingenuity.

207
00:11:19,597 --> 00:11:24,567
I am the last of
the imaginative
executioners.

208
00:11:24,602 --> 00:11:29,572
And how do you intend
to kill me?

209
00:11:29,607 --> 00:11:30,823
Let me tell you
what, major-

210
00:11:30,858 --> 00:11:33,325
let's have a drink
of wine first,

211
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,462
and then i'll tell you.

212
00:11:36,497 --> 00:11:37,713
Sante.

213
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:44,587
Ah. Excellent.

214
00:11:44,622 --> 00:11:45,838
Flavor, bouquet,

215
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:47,723
just the proper
amount of dryness.

216
00:11:47,758 --> 00:11:51,477
It's really a most
exceptional wine.

217
00:11:52,728 --> 00:11:54,597
Join me, major.

218
00:11:57,733 --> 00:11:59,602
Very well, kommissar.

219
00:11:59,637 --> 00:12:02,104
I will have
a drink of wine.

220
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:03,989
Then i may killyou.

221
00:12:04,024 --> 00:12:07,109
Yes, you may
very well try.

222
00:12:24,627 --> 00:12:27,129
And now let me tell you
something about us.

223
00:12:27,164 --> 00:12:31,517
Let me explain the difference
between you and me.

224
00:12:31,552 --> 00:12:34,770
You are a malcontent,
major.

225
00:12:34,805 --> 00:12:39,141
You can never accept
that which is ordained.

226
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:43,279
I, on the other hand,
i adapt to my situations.

227
00:12:43,314 --> 00:12:45,781
I don't have
a very large salary,

228
00:12:45,816 --> 00:12:47,650
and my job-
at least the way it's laid out-

229
00:12:47,685 --> 00:12:48,901
is rather a dull one:

230
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:53,155
Finding traitors and defectors
and doing away with them.

231
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,406
And in your case...

232
00:12:55,658 --> 00:12:57,543
in my case...

233
00:12:57,578 --> 00:13:01,914
in your case,
i choose to prolong it,

234
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:04,416
and in the process
of this prolongation,

235
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:08,804
i have come up with...
with something that i think

236
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:13,175
is a most bizarre
and novel method of execution.

237
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:17,563
One designed
to challenge your talents,

238
00:13:17,598 --> 00:13:22,568
for we both are worthy
adversaries- you and me.

239
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:28,824
I feel... very weak.

240
00:13:35,698 --> 00:13:38,834
You... you, monster.

241
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:40,703
You drugged me.

242
00:14:19,742 --> 00:14:21,627
Oh...

243
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:39,144
greetings, major kuchenko.

244
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:41,647
First of all,
to clear up one point-

245
00:14:41,682 --> 00:14:43,515
as must be evident to you,

246
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:47,269
i've been imbibing this
particular drug for many years

247
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:49,271
and have reached a point
where i can drink it

248
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:51,774
by the gallon
and be quite unaffected.

249
00:14:51,809 --> 00:14:53,659
As you've probably perceived,

250
00:14:53,694 --> 00:14:56,779
i'm rather a gamesman
when it comes to killing.

251
00:14:56,814 --> 00:14:59,915
I have my own rules
and ethics that apply,

252
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:01,166
and, major kuchenko,

253
00:15:01,201 --> 00:15:03,669
listen to the following
quite carefully.

254
00:15:03,704 --> 00:15:07,172
This is the game,
and these are the rules.

255
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:10,292
You have been asleep
for roughly three hours.

256
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:14,296
During that time, i have placed
a booby trap in this room.

257
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:15,297
It is not visible,

258
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:18,434
but it is attached
to a very common object.

259
00:15:18,469 --> 00:15:23,305
If you trigger this object, you
will immediately be blown up.

260
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,808
Now the following proposition:

261
00:15:25,843 --> 00:15:27,693
If during the next three hours,

262
00:15:27,728 --> 00:15:30,813
you are able to find this
booby trap and cut the wire,

263
00:15:30,848 --> 00:15:33,315
you'll be permitted
to leave the room alive.

264
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:35,200
This is a guarantee,

265
00:15:35,235 --> 00:15:38,320
but the following conditions
are of the essence, major.

266
00:15:38,954 --> 00:15:40,823
You must actively search
for this booby trap,

267
00:15:40,858 --> 00:15:43,325
and you must find it
and render it unusable.

268
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,579
Attempt to turn out the lights,
and you'll be shot at once.

269
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:50,716
The moment you stop an active
search, you will be shot,

270
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:54,470
or if you are unable to find the
trap at the end of three hours

271
00:15:54,505 --> 00:15:58,223
or attempt to leave the room
during that time, i'm afraid

272
00:15:58,590 --> 00:15:59,842
the same conditions apply.

273
00:15:59,877 --> 00:16:03,595
You will receive
a bullet in the head.

274
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:06,098
So, there you have it, major.

275
00:16:08,018 --> 00:16:10,486
As a fellow expert
in the art of booby traps,

276
00:16:10,521 --> 00:16:12,354
i think you will admit, major,

277
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:18,494
that this situation has its
own special imaginative quality.

278
00:16:50,526 --> 00:16:52,394
The doorknob.

279
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:53,645
Interesting idea.

280
00:17:07,543 --> 00:17:09,044
That bible
that looks

281
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,913
as if it's been
pulled out.

282
00:17:10,948 --> 00:17:12,164
Possible.

283
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:31,183
I think he's
found it.

284
00:17:31,218 --> 00:17:32,434
I doubt it.

285
00:17:33,068 --> 00:17:34,319
The dresser drawer.

286
00:17:37,439 --> 00:17:38,690
Wait and see.

287
00:17:50,621 --> 00:17:52,454
You seem so sure.

288
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:53,088
Sure?

289
00:17:53,123 --> 00:17:54,957
That he'll
find the trap.

290
00:17:54,992 --> 00:17:56,842
Not at all.
That's not what i'm sure about.

291
00:17:56,877 --> 00:17:58,710
What i mean to say
is that i'm reasonably sure

292
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:02,464
he'll find it, but he'll
find it when it's too late.

293
00:18:23,403 --> 00:18:25,237
Is he at the table?

294
00:18:25,272 --> 00:18:27,122
He's stripping
the bed.

295
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:32,744
That's where you
put it, isn't it?

296
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:34,630
In the bed.

297
00:18:34,665 --> 00:18:39,635
Warm now, boris.
Extremely warm, but not hot.

298
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:42,137
Then where?

299
00:18:42,172 --> 00:18:44,006
Please, kommissar,
tell me!

300
00:18:45,926 --> 00:18:48,393
What's he doing now?

301
00:18:48,428 --> 00:18:50,896
Well, what's he doing now?

302
00:18:54,016 --> 00:18:55,267
He's at the
telephone.

303
00:19:01,523 --> 00:19:03,408
I thought for
a minute...

304
00:19:03,443 --> 00:19:05,277
you thought what?

305
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:07,162
The telephone.

306
00:19:07,197 --> 00:19:08,413
Hot, boris.

307
00:19:08,448 --> 00:19:10,282
Extremely hot.

308
00:19:11,533 --> 00:19:12,784
The telephone?

309
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:14,670
Precisely.

310
00:19:14,705 --> 00:19:15,921
The telephone.

311
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:26,048
But...

312
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:28,550
but he just lifted
the receiver.

313
00:19:28,585 --> 00:19:29,184
Indeed.

314
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:31,687
He lifted the receiver
to call out.

315
00:19:31,722 --> 00:19:32,938
If, on the other hand,

316
00:19:32,973 --> 00:19:34,189
the major's phone
were to ring,

317
00:19:34,224 --> 00:19:36,058
and he were
to answer it...

318
00:19:36,093 --> 00:19:37,309
that's it!

319
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:38,560
That's it.

320
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:41,697
If he picks it up
afterit rings.

321
00:19:41,732 --> 00:19:44,199
Ah, you've got it now,
my friend.

322
00:19:44,234 --> 00:19:48,570
If the major's phone rings
and he answers it,

323
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:51,707
i've placed a tiny plastic bomb
inside the mechanism.

324
00:19:51,742 --> 00:19:52,958
The explosion...

325
00:19:52,993 --> 00:19:54,826
the explosion will only occur

326
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:57,963
after the ring and the lifting
of the receiver,

327
00:19:57,998 --> 00:20:01,083
at which point, major kuchenko
will not even have time

328
00:20:01,118 --> 00:20:02,334
to say hello.

329
00:20:39,254 --> 00:20:40,505
Vassiloff!

330
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,374
Shoot me!

331
00:20:54,269 --> 00:20:56,772
Shoot me, vassiloff!

332
00:20:56,807 --> 00:20:58,640
Shoot me!

333
00:20:58,675 --> 00:21:00,525
Why don't you kill me,
vassiloff?!

334
00:21:03,645 --> 00:21:05,530
Shoot me, vassiloff.

335
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:10,535
What's the
time, boris?

336
00:21:11,787 --> 00:21:14,906
Ten minutes to five.

337
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:17,409
Almost dawn, kommissar.

338
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:19,911
He's got another
ten minutes.

339
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:27,419
Well, i think
it's time to, uh...

340
00:21:27,454 --> 00:21:30,555
how shall we say...

341
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:32,424
"implement" the thing?

342
00:21:39,314 --> 00:21:44,319
Yes, would you ring
room 963, please?

343
00:21:44,354 --> 00:21:45,570
Thank you.

344
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:30,732
Now, kommissar?

345
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:33,235
No, no, no, no, no!

346
00:22:38,874 --> 00:22:40,125
Hello.

347
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,376
Hello!

348
00:22:41,411 --> 00:22:45,130
Yes, would you ring
room 963 again, please?

349
00:23:06,768 --> 00:23:08,019
Kommissar?

350
00:23:09,905 --> 00:23:13,024
It would have been
better, wouldn't it?

351
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:20,532
It's all right.

352
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:22,417
I'll get him in
the next city...

353
00:23:22,452 --> 00:23:23,668
now that i know

354
00:23:23,703 --> 00:23:27,422
that he is a most
resourceful adversary.

355
00:23:34,965 --> 00:23:36,181
No, boris!

356
00:23:37,432 --> 00:23:39,551
I'm sorry, sir.

357
00:23:39,586 --> 00:23:42,053
The line seems
to be disconnected.

358
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:44,556
I'm unable to reach your party.

359
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:48,310
It's all right, operator, i...

360
00:23:48,345 --> 00:23:49,561
i have reached them.

361
00:23:52,063 --> 00:23:57,068
Flight 17, transocean airways,
now departing for new york city

362
00:23:57,103 --> 00:24:00,205
via belgrade, rome, london.

363
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,073
All aboard, please.

364
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:06,461
Major ivan kuchenko,
on his way west,

365
00:24:06,496 --> 00:24:08,330
on his way to freedom-

366
00:24:08,365 --> 00:24:12,083
a freedom bought and paid for
by a most stunning ingenuity.

367
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:14,586
And exit
one kommissar vassiloff,

368
00:24:14,621 --> 00:24:17,722
who forgot that there are
two sides to an argument

369
00:24:17,757 --> 00:24:19,591
and two parties on the line.

370
00:24:19,626 --> 00:24:23,345
This has been the twilight zone.

371
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,236
And now, mr. Serling.

372
00:24:31,271 --> 00:24:33,104
Next time out
onthe twilight zone,

373
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:36,241
we enlist the talented
typewriter of earl hamner, jr.

374
00:24:36,276 --> 00:24:38,743
And present a stunningly
conceived show called,

375
00:24:38,778 --> 00:24:41,863
"stopover in a quiet town."

376
00:24:41,898 --> 00:24:45,000
It will star barry nelson
and nancy malone

377
00:24:45,035 --> 00:24:46,868
and it will provide
the kind of shock ending

378
00:24:46,903 --> 00:24:50,622
that punches the emotional eye
with unexpected force.

379
00:24:50,657 --> 00:24:54,376
Next time,
"stopover in a quiet town."
