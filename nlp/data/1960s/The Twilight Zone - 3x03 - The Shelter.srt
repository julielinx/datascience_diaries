1
00:00:09,142 --> 00:00:12,278
You're traveling
through another dimension-

2
00:00:12,313 --> 00:00:15,398
a dimension not only of sight
and sound, but of mind,

3
00:00:15,433 --> 00:00:17,283
a journey into a wondrous land

4
00:00:17,318 --> 00:00:19,786
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

5
00:00:19,821 --> 00:00:21,654
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

6
00:00:47,966 --> 00:00:49,816
Ladies and gentlemen...

7
00:00:51,684 --> 00:00:55,438
ladies and gentlemen, may i
have your attention, please?

8
00:00:56,724 --> 00:00:59,826
Now, no birthday
celebration is complete

9
00:00:59,861 --> 00:01:01,694
without an after-dinner speech.

10
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:04,197
Oh, no, jerry.

11
00:01:04,232 --> 00:01:07,333
And so, let's get
to the business at hand,

12
00:01:07,368 --> 00:01:09,836
the honoring
of dr. William stockton.

13
00:01:09,871 --> 00:01:14,207
Now, jerry harlowe,
you sit down.

14
00:01:14,242 --> 00:01:16,709
Who today is one year older

15
00:01:16,744 --> 00:01:19,212
and admits to being over 21.

16
00:01:20,463 --> 00:01:23,600
And who, in the short space
of 20 years

17
00:01:23,635 --> 00:01:27,353
has taken care of not
only us, our children,

18
00:01:27,388 --> 00:01:29,856
but even our grandchildren.

19
00:01:29,891 --> 00:01:30,607
Whose
grandchildren?

20
00:01:30,642 --> 00:01:32,475
As a matter of fact,

21
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:34,978
i doubt if there's
anyone in this room

22
00:01:35,013 --> 00:01:37,480
who still does not
owe the good doctor

23
00:01:37,515 --> 00:01:38,982
for a visit or two.

24
00:01:39,017 --> 00:01:40,233
What about
the hammering

25
00:01:40,268 --> 00:01:42,118
at all hours
of the night?

26
00:01:42,153 --> 00:01:43,987
That's another thing
we owe him for.

27
00:01:44,022 --> 00:01:47,123
Ah, yes, yes, the good
doctor's bomb shelter.

28
00:01:47,158 --> 00:01:50,877
Well, i'm afraid we'll have
to forgive him for all that

29
00:01:50,912 --> 00:01:54,631
despite the fact that what
he sees as farsightedness

30
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:57,750
has been a real pain in
the neck to the rest of us,

31
00:01:57,785 --> 00:02:00,253
what with all the
concrete trucks

32
00:02:00,288 --> 00:02:02,138
and the nocturnal
hammering

33
00:02:02,173 --> 00:02:04,007
and all the rest of it.

34
00:02:04,676 --> 00:02:05,758
That's better.

35
00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:07,010
Well, at any rate,

36
00:02:07,045 --> 00:02:08,261
when grace mentioned

37
00:02:08,296 --> 00:02:10,763
that it was the good
doctor's birthday,

38
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:12,649
we all decided
to take a hand

39
00:02:12,684 --> 00:02:13,900
in the proceedings.

40
00:02:13,935 --> 00:02:16,402
I had an idea
something was going on.

41
00:02:16,437 --> 00:02:17,654
No, you didn't.

42
00:02:17,689 --> 00:02:18,271
Oh, yes, i did.

43
00:02:18,306 --> 00:02:20,773
And doc, as a little
personal aside,

44
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:22,659
i'd like to
conclude this way.

45
00:02:22,694 --> 00:02:26,029
That'll probably be the
best part of the speech.

46
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:29,282
Doc, you're a very
beloved fellow

47
00:02:29,317 --> 00:02:29,916
and rightly so.

48
00:02:29,951 --> 00:02:31,167
And you may not have

49
00:02:31,202 --> 00:02:34,287
the biggest practice
in medical history...

50
00:02:34,322 --> 00:02:34,921
that's true.

51
00:02:35,538 --> 00:02:37,423
...but there isn't
a single sawbones

52
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:38,675
in the entire 50 states

53
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,543
whose patients
have such a regard-

54
00:02:40,578 --> 00:02:43,680
such affection,
such respect-

55
00:02:43,715 --> 00:02:46,683
for their man with
the little black bag

56
00:02:46,718 --> 00:02:47,934
as we do for ours.

57
00:02:47,969 --> 00:02:49,185
Well done!

58
00:02:50,471 --> 00:02:53,306
You dirty dog.

59
00:02:53,341 --> 00:02:55,808
First a surprise party,
which i abhor,

60
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:58,311
and then that sloppy,
sentimental speech.

61
00:02:58,346 --> 00:03:00,813
You ought to be
ashamed of yourself.

62
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:02,699
I thought it was
pretty good, bill.

63
00:03:02,734 --> 00:03:06,452
Let's take our coffee
in the other room, huh?

64
00:03:06,487 --> 00:03:07,070
Pop, pop!

65
00:03:07,105 --> 00:03:08,955
Yes, paulie,
what is it?

66
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:10,206
The picture
went out

67
00:03:10,241 --> 00:03:11,457
on the tv set.

68
00:03:11,492 --> 00:03:12,075
Then there was

69
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:13,960
some goofy
announcement.

70
00:03:13,995 --> 00:03:15,211
Hold it, everybody.

71
00:03:15,246 --> 00:03:16,462
Shh, shh!

72
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,082
What did
you say, paul?

73
00:03:19,117 --> 00:03:20,333
The announcer
said something

74
00:03:20,368 --> 00:03:22,835
about turn to the conelrad
station on the radio.

75
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,721
Are you sure
that's what you heard?

76
00:03:24,756 --> 00:03:26,589
I didn't hear wrong, pop.

77
00:03:26,624 --> 00:03:28,474
He said, "turn to
the conelrad station"

78
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:30,343
and then everything went

79
00:03:30,378 --> 00:03:31,094
completely blank.

80
00:03:37,385 --> 00:03:39,852
Direct from washington, d.c.

81
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:41,738
Repeating that:

82
00:03:41,773 --> 00:03:45,491
Four minutes ago, the president
made the following announcement.

83
00:03:45,526 --> 00:03:46,743
I quote:

84
00:03:46,778 --> 00:03:49,245
"At 11:04 p.m.
Eastern standard time

85
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,748
"both our distant
early warning line

86
00:03:51,783 --> 00:03:53,616
"and ballistics
early warning line

87
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:57,370
"reported radar evidence of
unidentified flying objects

88
00:03:57,405 --> 00:03:59,255
"flying due southeast.

89
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:01,124
"We have been
unable to determine

90
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:03,009
"the nature of these objects,

91
00:04:03,044 --> 00:04:06,012
"but in the interests
of national safety,

92
00:04:06,047 --> 00:04:08,514
we are declaring a state
of yellow alert."

93
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:10,383
The civil defense
authorities request

94
00:04:10,418 --> 00:04:12,885
that if you have
a shelter already prepared,

95
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,771
go there at once.

96
00:04:14,806 --> 00:04:15,388
Come on, marty.

97
00:04:15,423 --> 00:04:17,273
If not, use your time

98
00:04:17,308 --> 00:04:19,776
to move supplies of
food, water and medicine

99
00:04:19,811 --> 00:04:21,027
to a central place.

100
00:04:22,313 --> 00:04:24,781
Keep all windows
and doors closed.

101
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:27,283
If you're in your home,

102
00:04:27,318 --> 00:04:31,037
go to your prepared shelters
or to your basement.

103
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:49,555
What you're about to watch
is a nightmare.

104
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:52,675
It is not meant to be prophetic,
it need not happen.

105
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:56,429
It's the fervent and urgent
prayer of all men of goodwill

106
00:04:56,464 --> 00:04:58,314
that it never shall happen.

107
00:04:58,349 --> 00:05:02,068
But in this place,
in this moment, it does happen.

108
00:05:02,685 --> 00:05:04,570
This is the twilight zone.

109
00:05:24,242 --> 00:05:26,092
Fill up as many
as you can, grace.

110
00:05:26,127 --> 00:05:29,212
I'm going to check the
air filter down there.

111
00:05:29,247 --> 00:05:31,097
We'll get the rest
of the stuff later.

112
00:05:31,132 --> 00:05:32,965
Looks like we'll
lose the power

113
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,217
any minute now.

114
00:05:34,252 --> 00:05:37,970
Bill, there's hardly any water
coming through this tap.

115
00:05:42,725 --> 00:05:45,228
Easy, honey. Easy.

116
00:05:45,263 --> 00:05:47,113
Now make believe
it's perfume,

117
00:05:47,148 --> 00:05:49,615
and it cost a hundred
dollars an ounce.

118
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:50,867
Maybe in an hour or so,

119
00:05:50,902 --> 00:05:53,369
it'll be worth even
more than that.

120
00:05:53,404 --> 00:05:54,620
What else, pop?

121
00:05:54,655 --> 00:05:56,489
You got all the canned goods
down, paulie?

122
00:05:56,524 --> 00:05:57,740
Yeah, all i could find.

123
00:05:57,775 --> 00:05:58,991
How about
the fruit cellar, paul?

124
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:00,243
I put those in, too.

125
00:06:00,278 --> 00:06:01,494
Uh, go up to my bedroom
and get my bag

126
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:02,745
and put that in, too.

127
00:06:03,379 --> 00:06:04,630
Wh-what about the
books and stuff?

128
00:06:04,665 --> 00:06:06,499
Paul! Your father told you
to get his bag.

129
00:06:06,534 --> 00:06:09,001
There's time, grace.
There's plenty of time.

130
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:11,504
And we'll need books and things.

131
00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:15,258
I don't know how long we'll
have to stay down there.

132
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:19,011
What about lightbulbs?

133
00:06:20,298 --> 00:06:21,514
Where do you keep
the lightbulbs?

134
00:06:21,549 --> 00:06:24,650
Oh, on the top shelf here
of this cupboard, bill.

135
00:06:24,685 --> 00:06:25,902
Oh, we don't have any.

136
00:06:25,937 --> 00:06:27,153
I ran out.

137
00:06:27,188 --> 00:06:29,655
Well, i was going to buy
some at the store yesterday

138
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:34,026
because there was
a sale on and...

139
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:37,163
oh, bill, i'm talking
like some idiot.

140
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:42,168
Now, how much more
time is there?

141
00:06:42,203 --> 00:06:45,288
There's no telling,
grace, honey.

142
00:06:45,323 --> 00:06:46,539
Conelrad says
from the first alarm

143
00:06:46,574 --> 00:06:48,424
we might have anywhere
between 15 minutes

144
00:06:48,459 --> 00:06:50,293
and a half an hour.

145
00:06:50,328 --> 00:06:51,544
Fif-fifteen minutes?

146
00:06:51,579 --> 00:06:53,429
I'm just winging it, grace.

147
00:06:53,464 --> 00:06:54,680
I don't know for sure.

148
00:06:54,715 --> 00:06:55,932
I don't think anyone does.

149
00:06:55,967 --> 00:06:58,434
Now keep filling them.

150
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:02,805
Bill?!

151
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,056
There's no more water.

152
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:05,942
It doesn't make
any difference anyhow.

153
00:07:05,977 --> 00:07:07,810
I think we've got
enough water.

154
00:07:07,845 --> 00:07:09,695
You bring a jug
with you, gracie.

155
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:12,815
Paul and i
will get the rest.

156
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:23,075
Now, you two stay here.

157
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,961
I'll get the rest
of the water.

158
00:07:24,996 --> 00:07:28,714
No, wait a minute.

159
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:31,834
I've slipped.

160
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:33,719
Paulie, there's
a small tool kit

161
00:07:33,754 --> 00:07:34,971
in the garage.

162
00:07:35,006 --> 00:07:36,222
Will you get it?
Right.

163
00:07:36,257 --> 00:07:38,724
I'll get the rest
of the water.

164
00:07:39,976 --> 00:07:43,095
Grace.

165
00:07:49,352 --> 00:07:50,603
Now, if it is a bomb,

166
00:07:50,638 --> 00:07:53,105
there's no assurance
it'll land near us,

167
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,357
and if it doesn't...

168
00:07:54,392 --> 00:07:56,242
but if it does, bill,

169
00:07:56,277 --> 00:07:58,744
new york is only
40 miles away.

170
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:01,864
And new york's going
to get it, we know that.

171
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:04,367
So we'll get it, too,
all of it-

172
00:08:04,402 --> 00:08:07,503
the poison, the radiation,
the whole mess.

173
00:08:07,538 --> 00:08:08,754
We'll get it.

174
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:10,623
We'll be in a
shelter, grace,

175
00:08:10,658 --> 00:08:12,508
and with any luck at
all, we'll survive.

176
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,377
We've got food
and water enough

177
00:08:14,412 --> 00:08:16,262
to last us
for two weeks-

178
00:08:16,297 --> 00:08:18,130
maybe even longer
if we use it wisely.

179
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:20,633
Then what, bill?

180
00:08:20,668 --> 00:08:22,518
Then what?

181
00:08:22,553 --> 00:08:25,021
We crawl out of here
like gophers

182
00:08:25,056 --> 00:08:28,140
to tiptoe through all
that rubble up above?

183
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:30,643
The rubble and the ruin

184
00:08:30,678 --> 00:08:33,779
and the bodies
of our friends?

185
00:08:33,814 --> 00:08:35,648
Oh, bill,

186
00:08:35,683 --> 00:08:39,151
why is it so necessary
to survive?

187
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:41,654
What's the good of it?

188
00:08:41,689 --> 00:08:45,408
Wouldn't it just be better

189
00:08:45,443 --> 00:08:49,161
and easier, just quicker

190
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:50,913
if we just...

191
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:52,798
i got the tools, pop.

192
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:55,301
Anything else you
need from out here?

193
00:08:59,055 --> 00:09:02,808
Grace, that's why
we have to survive.

194
00:09:02,843 --> 00:09:04,677
That's the reason.

195
00:09:04,712 --> 00:09:07,813
He may only
inherit rubble now,

196
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:09,682
but he's 12 years old.

197
00:09:09,717 --> 00:09:12,184
He's only
12 years old, grace.

198
00:09:20,943 --> 00:09:22,828
Now.

199
00:09:22,863 --> 00:09:27,333
This is conelrad, your
emergency broadcasting station.

200
00:09:27,368 --> 00:09:28,584
Paulie.

201
00:09:28,619 --> 00:09:29,835
I got
the tools, pop.

202
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,704
Good- put it
down over there.

203
00:09:31,739 --> 00:09:33,589
I'll get the rest
of the water.

204
00:09:33,624 --> 00:09:35,458
Remain tuned to this frequency.

205
00:09:35,493 --> 00:09:37,960
We repeat our
previous announcement...

206
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:49,855
how's it going, bill?

207
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:51,107
It's going
fine, jerry.

208
00:09:51,142 --> 00:09:52,358
We're collecting water

209
00:09:52,393 --> 00:09:53,609
which is what
you should be doing.

210
00:09:53,644 --> 00:09:54,860
Well, we collected
about 30 gallons

211
00:09:54,895 --> 00:09:56,112
and then the
water stopped.

212
00:09:56,147 --> 00:09:57,980
You better get
into your shelter-

213
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,231
into your basement-

214
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:01,117
and i'd board up
the windows if i were you.

215
00:10:01,152 --> 00:10:02,368
You got any wood...?

216
00:10:02,403 --> 00:10:04,236
Bill, we don't have
any cellar, remember?

217
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:05,488
The advantages of
modern architecture.

218
00:10:05,523 --> 00:10:07,373
We got the only brand-
new house on the block.

219
00:10:07,408 --> 00:10:10,493
We got everything
at your fingertips-

220
00:10:10,528 --> 00:10:12,995
even got an
electric laundry room.

221
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,880
All the wonders of modern
science taken into account

222
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:16,749
except that thing
that's heading for us right now.

223
00:10:16,784 --> 00:10:18,000
Jerry, come on.

224
00:10:18,634 --> 00:10:20,503
Can i bring martha
and the kids over here?

225
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:23,005
Over here?

226
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,141
We're sitting ducks
over there-

227
00:10:25,176 --> 00:10:26,392
no protection at all.

228
00:10:26,427 --> 00:10:27,643
Oh, jerry.

229
00:10:27,678 --> 00:10:29,512
You can use
our basement.

230
00:10:29,547 --> 00:10:30,763
Your basement?

231
00:10:30,798 --> 00:10:32,648
What about
your shelter?

232
00:10:32,683 --> 00:10:34,517
It's the only place
we can survive!

233
00:10:34,552 --> 00:10:35,768
I don't have
any room, jerry.

234
00:10:35,803 --> 00:10:37,019
There's not near enough
room or supplies.

235
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:38,270
It's designed
for three people.

236
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:40,156
Well, we'll bring
our own food and water.

237
00:10:40,191 --> 00:10:41,407
We'll sleep
standing up.

238
00:10:41,442 --> 00:10:43,275
Bill, you've
got to help me.

239
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,527
You've got to keep
my family alive.

240
00:10:44,562 --> 00:10:46,412
We won't use
any of your stuff.

241
00:10:46,447 --> 00:10:47,029
What about air?

242
00:10:47,663 --> 00:10:48,914
That's a 10x10
room, jerry,

243
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:50,783
with an air
filter designed
for three people.

244
00:10:50,818 --> 00:10:52,034
Will you bring
your own air?

245
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:53,919
Well, just give us
a chance.
No, no, no.

246
00:10:53,954 --> 00:10:55,788
48 hours, bill,
then we'll get out.

247
00:10:55,823 --> 00:10:57,039
When that door gets
closed and locked

248
00:10:57,074 --> 00:10:58,290
it stays closed
and locked, jerry.

249
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:01,427
There'll be radiation and
heaven knows what else.

250
00:11:01,462 --> 00:11:05,181
I'm sorry, jerry, as god
is my witness, i am sorry,

251
00:11:05,216 --> 00:11:05,798
but i built that
for my family.

252
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:07,049
What about mine?
What'll we do?

253
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:08,300
Just rock
on the front porch

254
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:09,552
while we burn
to a crisp?

255
00:11:09,587 --> 00:11:11,437
That's no
concern of mine.

256
00:11:11,472 --> 00:11:13,939
Right now it's my family
i have to worry about.

257
00:11:13,974 --> 00:11:15,191
Do you think
i'm going to stand by

258
00:11:15,226 --> 00:11:17,059
and watch while my wife
and children die in agony?

259
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:18,310
I'm not going to do it,
you understand?

260
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:19,562
Bill,
i'm not going to do it!

261
00:11:22,064 --> 00:11:23,949
I'm sorry,
please forgive me.

262
00:11:23,984 --> 00:11:26,452
I kept telling you,
jerry- all of you-

263
00:11:26,487 --> 00:11:28,320
get ready,
build a shelter.

264
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:30,206
Forget the card parties
and the barbecues

265
00:11:30,241 --> 00:11:31,457
for maybe a few hours a week,

266
00:11:31,492 --> 00:11:33,959
forget them, and make the
admission to yourself

267
00:11:33,994 --> 00:11:35,211
that the worst
was possible.

268
00:11:35,246 --> 00:11:36,462
But you didn't want
to listen, jerry.

269
00:11:36,497 --> 00:11:37,713
None of you wanted
to listen.
Please, bill...

270
00:11:37,748 --> 00:11:38,964
to build a shelter

271
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:40,216
was to admit to the
kind of age we lived in,

272
00:11:40,251 --> 00:11:42,084
and none of you had
the guts to face that.

273
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:43,335
So now you've got
to face something

274
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,587
far worse, jerry.

275
00:11:45,221 --> 00:11:47,089
So, god, please, god
protect you, jerry.

276
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:48,340
It's out of my hands.

277
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,226
It's simply
out of my hands.

278
00:11:50,261 --> 00:11:52,094
It's got to be god.
It's got to be god.

279
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:53,979
They're already
in the shelter.

280
00:11:54,014 --> 00:11:55,231
Marty, i told you.

281
00:11:55,266 --> 00:11:56,482
He's locked
himself in.

282
00:11:56,517 --> 00:11:57,733
He's got
to let us in.

283
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,236
We have no windows
in half the basement

284
00:12:00,271 --> 00:12:02,104
and i don't
have anything

285
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:03,355
to plug them up,
either.

286
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,858
And the basement
won't help, anyway.

287
00:12:05,893 --> 00:12:07,109
I can't help
you, marty.

288
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:08,360
He's downstairs?

289
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:08,994
Yeah, yeah.

290
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:10,246
Bill, bill...

291
00:12:10,281 --> 00:12:12,748
bill, it's marty.

292
00:12:12,783 --> 00:12:14,617
We've got
the kids with us.

293
00:12:14,652 --> 00:12:15,868
Marty!

294
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:18,370
Bill!

295
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:21,507
Bill, please let us in.

296
00:12:22,124 --> 00:12:24,627
Marty, please.

297
00:12:24,662 --> 00:12:27,129
Come back and get us... please!

298
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,266
Bill- bill,
it's marty.

299
00:12:30,301 --> 00:12:31,517
Please let us in.

300
00:12:31,552 --> 00:12:34,019
Marty, i would
if i could.

301
00:12:34,054 --> 00:12:35,888
Do you understand?

302
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:37,773
I swear to you,

303
00:12:37,808 --> 00:12:38,641
i would.

304
00:12:38,676 --> 00:12:39,892
Bill, please.

305
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:40,526
Please, bill.

306
00:12:41,143 --> 00:12:41,777
It's marty.

307
00:12:41,812 --> 00:12:43,646
I can't,
marty.

308
00:12:43,681 --> 00:12:46,282
Don't stand there
asking me.

309
00:12:46,317 --> 00:12:47,533
I can't!

310
00:12:47,568 --> 00:12:49,401
I can't
and i won't!

311
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:52,538
I feel sorry
for you, then, bill.

312
00:12:52,573 --> 00:12:53,789
I really do.

313
00:12:53,824 --> 00:12:55,658
You probably will survive,

314
00:12:55,693 --> 00:12:58,794
but you'll have
blood on your hands.

315
00:12:58,829 --> 00:13:00,663
You're a doctor!

316
00:13:00,698 --> 00:13:04,416
You're supposed to help people!

317
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:19,431
That was a million years ago...

318
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:24,436
a million years ago.

319
00:13:26,322 --> 00:13:28,190
Marty!

320
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:30,075
Get out of here!

321
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,327
Do you hear me?

322
00:13:31,362 --> 00:13:32,578
Get out of here, marty!

323
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:37,700
Marty!

324
00:13:58,637 --> 00:14:01,140
Then he slammed the door
right in my face.

325
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:02,391
Well, go back!

326
00:14:02,426 --> 00:14:03,642
Jerry, ask
him again.

327
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:04,894
Let's go.

328
00:14:04,929 --> 00:14:06,779
Jerry, ask
him again!

329
00:14:06,814 --> 00:14:07,530
Ask him again!

330
00:14:07,565 --> 00:14:10,032
Please, i don't
want to be here.

331
00:14:10,067 --> 00:14:11,901
Please, frank,
let's go home!

332
00:14:11,936 --> 00:14:13,152
There's no time!

333
00:14:13,187 --> 00:14:15,037
It's no use,
frank.

334
00:14:15,072 --> 00:14:16,288
He won't let
anybody in.

335
00:14:16,323 --> 00:14:17,540
What'll we do?

336
00:14:17,575 --> 00:14:19,408
We ought to find one basement

337
00:14:19,443 --> 00:14:20,659
and go to work on that.

338
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:22,545
Pool all of our stuff.

339
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,162
It just
isn't fair!

340
00:14:23,197 --> 00:14:24,413
He's
perfectly safe

341
00:14:24,448 --> 00:14:26,916
while our kids
have to sit around

342
00:14:26,951 --> 00:14:28,801
and wait for
a bomb to drop!

343
00:14:28,836 --> 00:14:30,803
Why don't we just
go down there

344
00:14:30,838 --> 00:14:32,671
and break down the door!

345
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:35,925
Frank, frank-
wait a minute, frank!

346
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,675
Frank,
wait a minute!

347
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:39,178
We can't all fit
in that bomb shelter.

348
00:14:39,213 --> 00:14:41,063
We'd be crazy
to even try.

349
00:14:41,098 --> 00:14:44,183
Why don't we pick out
one family- draw lots?

350
00:14:44,218 --> 00:14:45,184
I keep
telling you,

351
00:14:45,219 --> 00:14:47,069
he won't let
anybody in.

352
00:14:47,104 --> 00:14:48,320
We could all
go down there

353
00:14:48,355 --> 00:14:51,440
and tell him the whole street
is against him.

354
00:14:51,475 --> 00:14:52,691
What good
would it do?

355
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:54,944
Even if you break
down the door,

356
00:14:54,979 --> 00:14:55,578
we can't all fit.

357
00:14:55,613 --> 00:14:57,446
We'd be killing
everybody.

358
00:14:57,481 --> 00:14:59,331
If it saves even
one of my kids

359
00:14:59,366 --> 00:15:00,583
it's worth it.

360
00:15:00,618 --> 00:15:03,085
Jerry, you know him
better than any of us.

361
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,336
You're his best friend.

362
00:15:04,954 --> 00:15:06,205
Go down there again.

363
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,090
Talk to him,
plead with him.

364
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:11,210
Tell him to pick
out one family.

365
00:15:11,245 --> 00:15:13,095
We'll draw lots
or something.

366
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:16,348
One family...

367
00:15:16,383 --> 00:15:18,851
meaning yours, marty, huh?

368
00:15:18,886 --> 00:15:20,352
Why not?

369
00:15:20,387 --> 00:15:22,855
I've got a three-
month-old baby.

370
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:26,475
Is your baby any more precious
than one of my kids?

371
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:28,110
I never said that.

372
00:15:28,145 --> 00:15:31,864
Look, if you're going to argue
about who deserves to live...

373
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:33,365
you shut
your mouth, weiss.

374
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,617
Take it easy.
Let go!

375
00:15:34,652 --> 00:15:35,868
That's the way it is

376
00:15:35,903 --> 00:15:38,370
when the foreigners
come over here-

377
00:15:38,405 --> 00:15:38,988
pushy, grabby,

378
00:15:39,023 --> 00:15:40,990
seml-american!

379
00:15:41,025 --> 00:15:42,875
Why, you garbage-brained idiot!

380
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,743
Marty-
marty, please!

381
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:47,246
What's the
matter with you?

382
00:15:47,281 --> 00:15:48,497
Weiss, for my dough,

383
00:15:48,532 --> 00:15:51,000
you're at the
bottom of the list!

384
00:15:51,035 --> 00:15:53,502
Keep it up, you'll
slaughter each other!

385
00:15:53,537 --> 00:15:55,137
Marty...

386
00:15:55,172 --> 00:15:57,006
marty...
marty, please.

387
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:58,257
Go down to the shelter.

388
00:15:58,292 --> 00:16:00,142
Ask him, marty, please.

389
00:16:00,177 --> 00:16:02,011
I've already
asked him.

390
00:16:03,297 --> 00:16:04,513
It won't do
any good!

391
00:16:04,548 --> 00:16:05,764
Searchlights.

392
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:07,650
Let's go take a look.

393
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:11,654
Anything new
on the radio?

394
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:12,905
No.

395
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,773
What are you
doing out here?

396
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:16,659
Doc's got
himself locked

397
00:16:16,694 --> 00:16:17,276
in that shelter.

398
00:16:17,311 --> 00:16:19,161
You know what
i'm going to do?

399
00:16:19,196 --> 00:16:21,030
I'm going
down there

400
00:16:21,065 --> 00:16:22,915
and get him
to open up
that door.

401
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:24,783
That's the
only thing
left to do!

402
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:26,035
Frank's right.

403
00:16:26,669 --> 00:16:27,920
Come on, let's do it.

404
00:16:27,955 --> 00:16:29,171
No, wait a minute!

405
00:16:35,177 --> 00:16:37,680
Martha, keep those
kids in the kitchen.

406
00:16:37,715 --> 00:16:39,548
Bill!

407
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:41,183
Bill stockton!

408
00:16:41,218 --> 00:16:43,686
You've got a bunch
of your neighbors outside

409
00:16:43,721 --> 00:16:44,937
who want to stay alive.

410
00:16:44,972 --> 00:16:48,057
Now, you can
open that door
and talk to us

411
00:16:48,092 --> 00:16:49,308
and figure out
with us

412
00:16:49,343 --> 00:16:51,193
how many can
come in there

413
00:16:51,228 --> 00:16:53,696
or you can just keep on doing
what you're doing,

414
00:16:53,731 --> 00:16:55,564
and we'll bust
our way in there!

415
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:56,815
Bill, can
you hear me?

416
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,067
This is jerry.

417
00:16:58,102 --> 00:16:59,952
They mean
business
out here.

418
00:16:59,987 --> 00:17:01,820
I mean business in here.

419
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:03,706
I've already told you, jerry.

420
00:17:03,741 --> 00:17:05,574
You're wasting your time.

421
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:08,711
You're wasting precious time
you could use

422
00:17:08,746 --> 00:17:11,330
for figuring out
how you can survive.

423
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:14,466
Why don't we get
some kind of battering ram?

424
00:17:14,501 --> 00:17:16,335
Yeah, let's go
to bennett avenue.

425
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:17,586
Phil klein has
some heavy pipe

426
00:17:17,621 --> 00:17:18,837
in his basement.

427
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:20,089
No, no-
that would get him

428
00:17:20,124 --> 00:17:23,225
into the act, too,
and who cares about saving him.

429
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,476
If we do that-

430
00:17:24,511 --> 00:17:26,979
if we let all
those people know

431
00:17:27,596 --> 00:17:28,847
about the shelter
on our street-

432
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:30,733
we'd have a whole
mob to contend with.

433
00:17:30,768 --> 00:17:31,350
A whole bunch
of strangers.

434
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:33,352
What right have they got
to come over here?

435
00:17:33,387 --> 00:17:35,237
This isn't their street.
This isn't their shelter.

436
00:17:35,272 --> 00:17:38,107
Oh, oh,
this is our shelter, huh?

437
00:17:38,142 --> 00:17:41,860
And on the next street,
that's another country.

438
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:43,112
Patronize home industry.

439
00:17:43,147 --> 00:17:45,614
You idiots, you fools,
you're insane.

440
00:17:45,649 --> 00:17:48,117
All of you.
Maybe you don't want to live.

441
00:17:48,152 --> 00:17:49,368
Maybe you don't care!

442
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:51,503
I care- believe me, i care.

443
00:17:51,538 --> 00:17:54,006
I want to see
the morning sun come up, too.

444
00:17:54,623 --> 00:17:56,625
But a mob
doesn't have
any brains.

445
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:57,876
You're proving it!

446
00:17:57,911 --> 00:18:00,379
I say let's get
that battering ram

447
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:02,881
and we'll tell klein
to keep his mouth shut.

448
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,133
Wait a minute.

449
00:18:04,168 --> 00:18:06,018
I agree with jerry.

450
00:18:06,053 --> 00:18:08,520
We should stop
and think a minute.

451
00:18:08,555 --> 00:18:09,772
Now, i think that...

452
00:18:09,807 --> 00:18:11,023
nobody cares

453
00:18:11,058 --> 00:18:14,143
what you think-
you or your kind.

454
00:18:14,178 --> 00:18:15,644
I thought
i made it clear.

455
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,147
Yes, but i think
that jerry has...

456
00:18:18,182 --> 00:18:20,532
i think the first
order of business

457
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:21,784
is to get you
out of here.

458
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:24,787
Marty, marty!

459
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:28,540
Let's get
that battering ram

460
00:18:28,575 --> 00:18:30,409
and break
down that door.

461
00:18:30,444 --> 00:18:33,545
You've had your chance,
stockton, remember that!

462
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,414
You've had
your chance!

463
00:18:35,449 --> 00:18:37,299
Come on, marty,
come on.

464
00:18:39,802 --> 00:18:42,171
Bill...

465
00:18:42,805 --> 00:18:44,673
who are those people?

466
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:47,176
Those people...

467
00:18:47,211 --> 00:18:49,061
those people
are our neighbors,

468
00:18:49,096 --> 00:18:49,678
our friends,

469
00:18:49,713 --> 00:18:52,181
the people
we've lived with

470
00:18:52,216 --> 00:18:54,683
and alongside
for 20 years.

471
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:55,934
Come on, paulie,
we better get up

472
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:57,186
some of
this furniture

473
00:18:57,221 --> 00:18:58,437
so we'll have
some protection

474
00:18:58,472 --> 00:18:59,688
in case that door
goes through.

475
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:15,954
Come on, let's get it in there.

476
00:19:19,126 --> 00:19:20,959
Come on, over it.

477
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:22,845
Over it.

478
00:19:35,724 --> 00:19:38,861
Now!

479
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,631
It's through!

480
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:00,883
Put it down!

481
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:10,893
This is conelrad.

482
00:20:10,928 --> 00:20:14,012
Remain tuned
for an important message.

483
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:15,898
The president of the united
states has just announced

484
00:20:15,933 --> 00:20:17,766
that the previously
unidentified objects

485
00:20:17,801 --> 00:20:21,520
have now been definitely
ascertained as being satellites.

486
00:20:21,555 --> 00:20:25,274
There are
no enemy missiles approaching.

487
00:20:25,309 --> 00:20:29,027
There are no
enemy missiles approaching.

488
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:32,164
The objects have been
identified as satellites.

489
00:20:32,199 --> 00:20:34,666
They are harmless,
and we are in no danger.

490
00:20:34,701 --> 00:20:37,169
The state of emergency has
officially been called off.

491
00:20:37,204 --> 00:20:39,037
We are in no danger.

492
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:42,791
There is no enemy attack.

493
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:47,179
Thank god.

494
00:20:59,057 --> 00:21:00,943
Marty?

495
00:21:02,229 --> 00:21:03,445
Marty?

496
00:21:05,948 --> 00:21:06,565
I, uh...

497
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:11,570
i went
off my rocker.

498
00:21:11,605 --> 00:21:15,324
Well, you can understand
that, can't you?

499
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:17,209
I just went
off my rocker.

500
00:21:19,711 --> 00:21:21,580
I didn't mean
any of those things

501
00:21:21,615 --> 00:21:24,082
i said to you.

502
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:27,836
We were...
we were, all of us

503
00:21:27,871 --> 00:21:31,590
so scared,
so confused...

504
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,475
well, it's no
wonder, is it?

505
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:35,978
I mean, you
can understand

506
00:21:36,013 --> 00:21:39,097
why we all blew
our tops a little.

507
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:40,349
Well, i
don't think

508
00:21:40,384 --> 00:21:41,600
marty's going
to hold it

509
00:21:41,635 --> 00:21:42,851
against you,
frank.

510
00:21:45,354 --> 00:21:47,856
Just like i
don't think

511
00:21:47,891 --> 00:21:50,359
bill is going
to hold all
this against us.

512
00:21:50,394 --> 00:21:52,861
We'll pay for
the damages,
bill.

513
00:21:52,896 --> 00:21:55,364
We'll take up
a collection
right away.

514
00:21:55,399 --> 00:21:58,500
We... we could
have a block party

515
00:21:58,535 --> 00:22:01,003
tomorrow night
or something.

516
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:02,871
A big
celebration, huh?

517
00:22:02,906 --> 00:22:04,756
I think we
rate one now.

518
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:07,259
Hey, that's
a great idea-
a block party.

519
00:22:07,294 --> 00:22:09,761
Anything to get
back to normal, huh?

520
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:15,384
Normal?

521
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:20,389
I don't know.

522
00:22:20,424 --> 00:22:22,891
I don't know
what normal is.

523
00:22:25,394 --> 00:22:28,530
I thought i did once.

524
00:22:28,565 --> 00:22:30,399
I don't anymore.

525
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:36,038
I told you
we'd pay

526
00:22:36,073 --> 00:22:39,157
for the
damages, bill.

527
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:40,409
Damages?

528
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:46,048
I wonder.

529
00:22:47,916 --> 00:22:50,419
I wonder if any one of us
has any idea

530
00:22:50,454 --> 00:22:52,921
what those damages really are.

531
00:22:55,807 --> 00:22:58,927
Maybe one of them
is finding out

532
00:22:58,962 --> 00:23:03,315
what we're really like
when we're normal-

533
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:05,183
the kind of
people we are

534
00:23:05,218 --> 00:23:07,069
just underneath
the skin.

535
00:23:07,104 --> 00:23:09,938
I mean all of us.

536
00:23:09,973 --> 00:23:11,823
A lot of naked, wild animals

537
00:23:11,858 --> 00:23:14,326
who put such a price
on staying alive

538
00:23:14,361 --> 00:23:17,446
that they'll claw
their neighbors to death

539
00:23:17,481 --> 00:23:18,697
just for the privilege.

540
00:23:24,953 --> 00:23:28,090
We were spared a bomb tonight,

541
00:23:28,125 --> 00:23:29,207
but i wonder.

542
00:23:31,093 --> 00:23:33,595
I wonder if we
weren't destroyed

543
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:35,464
even without it.

544
00:23:53,982 --> 00:23:57,736
No moral, no message,
no prophetic tract.

545
00:23:57,771 --> 00:24:00,872
Just a simple statement of fact:

546
00:24:00,907 --> 00:24:02,741
For civilization to survive,

547
00:24:02,776 --> 00:24:05,243
the human race has
to remain civilized.

548
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:10,248
Tonight's very small exercise
in logic from the twilight zone.

549
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:18,673
Rod serling,
creator ofthe twilight zone,

550
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:21,176
will tell you
about next week's story

551
00:24:21,211 --> 00:24:25,063
after this word
from our alternate sponsor.

552
00:24:25,098 --> 00:24:26,631
And now, mr. Serling.

553
00:24:26,666 --> 00:24:31,436
Next week we move back in time
to april, 1865-

554
00:24:31,471 --> 00:24:35,190
the aftermath of the civil war,
and a strange dusty road

555
00:24:35,225 --> 00:24:38,326
that leads to
a most unbelievable adventure.

556
00:24:38,361 --> 00:24:40,829
On our show next week,
"the passersby."

557
00:24:40,864 --> 00:24:44,583
This one is for civil war buffs,
the mystics amongst you,

558
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,085
or any and all
who would want a brief vacation

559
00:24:47,702 --> 00:24:50,205
in the twilight zone.

560
00:25:19,568 --> 00:25:23,121
Be sure and watchgunsmoke
starring james arness,

561
00:25:23,156 --> 00:25:26,875
saturday nights over most
of these same stations.
