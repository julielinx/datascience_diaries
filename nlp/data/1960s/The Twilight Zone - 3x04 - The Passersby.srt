1
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:12,879
You're traveling
through another dimension-

2
00:00:12,914 --> 00:00:16,016
a dimension not only of sight
and sound, but of mind,

3
00:00:16,051 --> 00:00:18,518
a journey into a wondrous land

4
00:00:18,553 --> 00:00:21,021
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

5
00:00:21,056 --> 00:00:22,889
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

6
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:33,533
This road is the afterwards
of the civil war.

7
00:00:33,568 --> 00:00:36,653
It began at fort sumter,
south carolina,

8
00:00:36,688 --> 00:00:39,155
and ended at a place
called appomattox.

9
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:41,041
It's littered with the residue

10
00:00:41,076 --> 00:00:44,160
of broken battles
and shattered dreams.

11
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:27,337
Ma'am?

12
00:01:27,372 --> 00:01:29,839
Do... do you mind
if i have myself

13
00:01:29,874 --> 00:01:32,342
some of your
water, ma'am?

14
00:01:34,245 --> 00:01:36,096
Please.

15
00:01:36,131 --> 00:01:37,964
Thank you.

16
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,980
Beautiful once, wasn't it?

17
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,487
The tree i mean, ma'am.

18
00:02:00,522 --> 00:02:03,239
Once it was...

19
00:02:03,274 --> 00:02:04,491
very beautiful.

20
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:13,383
War claims
a lot of victims...

21
00:02:13,418 --> 00:02:16,503
men, animals and...

22
00:02:16,538 --> 00:02:19,005
and god's own beauty.

23
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:24,644
Ma'am, would you mind if
i sat here for a spell,

24
00:02:24,679 --> 00:02:26,513
and rested a bit?

25
00:02:26,548 --> 00:02:28,398
Not at all.

26
00:02:28,433 --> 00:02:29,649
Thank you.

27
00:02:49,571 --> 00:02:53,923
Oh, uh... you mind if
i strum a few chords

28
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:55,792
on my guit' box here?

29
00:02:55,827 --> 00:02:58,928
Not at all.

30
00:03:12,058 --> 00:03:14,561
My husband used
to play the guitar.

31
00:03:14,596 --> 00:03:16,446
Ah, did he now?

32
00:03:18,314 --> 00:03:20,200
And he's, uh, now...

33
00:03:20,235 --> 00:03:22,068
where is he, ma'am?

34
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:24,821
He was killed.

35
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,826
Yellow tavern
with general stuart.

36
00:03:29,861 --> 00:03:31,578
I'm sorry.

37
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,970
Brand-new gray...

38
00:03:41,005 --> 00:03:42,839
and gold braid...

39
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,341
and a thousand flags.

40
00:03:46,342 --> 00:03:48,228
Trumpets
and drums.

41
00:03:48,845 --> 00:03:50,730
Nothing but trumpets and drums.

42
00:03:50,765 --> 00:03:53,850
Beat the yanks in a month,
that's what they said.

43
00:03:53,885 --> 00:03:55,735
Beat the yanks in a month.

44
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:59,355
How wrong
they were.

45
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:02,742
And we stood by
in our summer dresses

46
00:04:02,777 --> 00:04:06,496
and cheered them on
and threw flowers-

47
00:04:06,531 --> 00:04:08,364
felt so grand.

48
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,118
Not many tears, just a few

49
00:04:12,153 --> 00:04:15,255
because we were so sure
they'd all be coming back

50
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:17,757
just as they left.

51
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:21,127
How wrong we were.

52
00:04:23,665 --> 00:04:26,132
Not feeling well, ma'am?

53
00:04:26,167 --> 00:04:28,635
I'm all right,
it's the fever...

54
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:30,520
but i'm on the mend now.

55
00:04:30,555 --> 00:04:33,022
It's left me a little weak,
that's all.

56
00:04:33,057 --> 00:04:34,891
A little weak.

57
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,027
Still they come...

58
00:04:38,062 --> 00:04:41,147
morning and night,
night and morning,

59
00:04:41,182 --> 00:04:43,650
they walk
down that road.

60
00:04:43,685 --> 00:04:46,786
The young ones
and the old ones.

61
00:04:46,821 --> 00:04:49,289
How worn they look.

62
00:04:49,324 --> 00:04:51,157
How tired.

63
00:04:51,192 --> 00:04:54,410
Are there hundreds of them
or thousands of them?

64
00:04:54,445 --> 00:04:56,296
Wouldn't you think...

65
00:04:56,331 --> 00:05:00,049
wouldn't you think
that with so many, my jud...

66
00:05:00,084 --> 00:05:02,552
my jud might be amongst them?

67
00:05:04,921 --> 00:05:06,556
Sergeant?

68
00:05:06,591 --> 00:05:07,807
Ma'am?

69
00:05:07,842 --> 00:05:09,058
Would you do
me a favor?

70
00:05:09,093 --> 00:05:10,310
If i can, ma'am.

71
00:05:10,345 --> 00:05:12,812
Would you play
your guitar real loud?

72
00:05:12,847 --> 00:05:15,315
I mean, real loud,
drown me out?

73
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:16,566
Loud, ma'am?

74
00:05:16,601 --> 00:05:17,183
I'm so sick to death

75
00:05:17,218 --> 00:05:18,434
of hearing
my own crying

76
00:05:18,469 --> 00:05:20,320
and the sound of
footsteps on the road.

77
00:05:20,355 --> 00:05:22,188
Please play it loud
so i can hear music.

78
00:05:22,223 --> 00:05:23,439
Oh, ma'am...

79
00:05:23,474 --> 00:05:25,325
please, sergeant!

80
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:29,696
As you wish, my lady.

81
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:40,340
? black is the color
of my true love's hair?

82
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:43,459
? her lips...?

83
00:05:43,494 --> 00:05:47,213
? are something wondrous fair?

84
00:05:47,248 --> 00:05:50,350
? the purest eyes...?

85
00:05:50,385 --> 00:05:54,103
In just a moment you will
enter a strange province

86
00:05:54,138 --> 00:05:57,223
that knows neither
north nor south-

87
00:05:57,258 --> 00:05:59,726
a place we call
the twilight zone.

88
00:06:24,118 --> 00:06:25,334
Charlie?

89
00:06:25,369 --> 00:06:26,586
Hmm?

90
00:06:26,621 --> 00:06:27,837
Charlie constable.

91
00:06:32,341 --> 00:06:33,226
Charlie!

92
00:06:33,261 --> 00:06:35,728
Charlie, it's lavinia.

93
00:06:35,763 --> 00:06:36,979
We thought you'd been killed-

94
00:06:37,014 --> 00:06:38,231
that's what everyone said.

95
00:06:38,266 --> 00:06:40,733
They said you'd been shot
in the head at gettysburg.

96
00:06:40,768 --> 00:06:43,236
Oh, i'm so glad
you've come back, charlie.

97
00:06:43,271 --> 00:06:45,104
I'm so glad
you're all right.

98
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:48,241
Couldn't you stop
a minute, charlie?

99
00:06:48,276 --> 00:06:50,109
I'm almost
there, lavinia.

100
00:06:50,144 --> 00:06:53,246
Your wife will be
so glad to see you.

101
00:06:53,281 --> 00:06:55,114
So very, very glad.

102
00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:57,617
I won't need
all this weight.

103
00:06:57,652 --> 00:06:59,502
I'll leave it here.

104
00:06:59,537 --> 00:07:01,370
Oh, charlie.

105
00:07:01,405 --> 00:07:03,256
Leave it here.

106
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:05,124
I got to keep moving.

107
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:07,009
I got to keep going.

108
00:07:07,044 --> 00:07:08,261
Good-bye.

109
00:07:08,296 --> 00:07:09,512
Oh, charlie.

110
00:07:09,547 --> 00:07:11,380
Will you give
susan my best?

111
00:07:11,415 --> 00:07:13,266
And tell her when
you get settled,

112
00:07:13,301 --> 00:07:14,517
to please come over.

113
00:07:14,552 --> 00:07:15,768
Though i expect

114
00:07:15,803 --> 00:07:18,271
she'll want to keep
you to herself.

115
00:07:18,306 --> 00:07:20,773
I know if it
were jud...

116
00:07:20,808 --> 00:07:22,642
if it were jud
come home to me,

117
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,144
i'd hold him
close, so close,

118
00:07:25,179 --> 00:07:27,029
i'd not let him
leave again.

119
00:07:27,064 --> 00:07:28,281
I'm sure, lavinia.

120
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,658
That was
charlie constable.

121
00:07:38,693 --> 00:07:41,794
They said he had been
killed in gettysburg-

122
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:43,045
shot through the head.

123
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,548
Thank god,
they made a mistake.

124
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:47,416
Thank god...

125
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:50,169
what's wrong, ma'am?

126
00:07:50,204 --> 00:07:52,054
Why...

127
00:07:52,089 --> 00:07:55,808
there's... there's blood
on his cap.

128
00:07:55,843 --> 00:07:58,678
There's blood
on charlie's cap.

129
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:11,574
You finished already?

130
00:08:11,609 --> 00:08:12,825
Yes, ma'am.

131
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,694
I got a feeling for wood.

132
00:08:14,729 --> 00:08:16,579
You know,
whether it's chopping it,

133
00:08:16,614 --> 00:08:19,081
or carving it or...

134
00:08:19,116 --> 00:08:20,950
or wearing it.

135
00:08:20,985 --> 00:08:22,201
Yeah.

136
00:08:23,487 --> 00:08:27,206
Like my... my guit' box here.

137
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:31,594
See this?
Oh.

138
00:08:31,629 --> 00:08:32,845
Made that myself.

139
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,965
Of course, it's not as good
as the one i got at home.

140
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,101
I had more time then,
you understand?

141
00:08:39,136 --> 00:08:41,604
I can remember my daddy
used to say to me,

142
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:42,855
"you're going to wind up

143
00:08:43,472 --> 00:08:45,975
nothing but a good-for-
nothing troubadour."

144
00:08:47,261 --> 00:08:49,111
That daddy of mine...

145
00:08:49,146 --> 00:08:50,980
i can see him now, the way
he used to look at me,

146
00:08:51,015 --> 00:08:52,865
his face all squinted
up like a persimmon.

147
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,368
He'd stick his finger
right in my...

148
00:08:55,403 --> 00:08:58,487
he'd say, "ebbie... ebbie,
you got nothing inside you

149
00:08:58,522 --> 00:09:00,373
"but soft mush
and sad ballads.

150
00:09:00,408 --> 00:09:02,875
Ain't you ever goin' grow
up and become a man?"

151
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,880
Oh, he was a proud one,

152
00:09:07,915 --> 00:09:09,749
the day i
marched off to war.

153
00:09:09,784 --> 00:09:11,634
He was just as proud
an old rooster.

154
00:09:11,669 --> 00:09:13,502
You know, there was his son

155
00:09:13,537 --> 00:09:15,388
marching off to war
to become a man.

156
00:09:16,674 --> 00:09:20,393
I come back...
back half of me.

157
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:23,512
But i did come back.

158
00:09:30,438 --> 00:09:34,156
You know that song of yours,
what is it?

159
00:09:34,191 --> 00:09:36,025
What is it?

160
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:42,915
? black is the color
of my true love's hair?

161
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,166
That the one?

162
00:09:46,704 --> 00:09:49,171
? her lips?

163
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:54,176
? are something
wondrous fair?

164
00:09:54,211 --> 00:09:58,547
? the truest eyes?

165
00:09:58,582 --> 00:10:04,804
? and the daintiest hands?

166
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:08,557
? i love...?
Jud, my husband,

167
00:10:08,592 --> 00:10:11,694
he... he used
to sing that song.

168
00:10:11,729 --> 00:10:14,814
Did he now?
Hmm.

169
00:10:14,849 --> 00:10:18,567
I wish you could
have met him.

170
00:10:18,602 --> 00:10:22,955
He was a very
gentle man.

171
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:25,458
A very nice man.

172
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:28,577
I can remember nights

173
00:10:28,612 --> 00:10:31,080
why, he'd sit here
on this very porch,

174
00:10:31,115 --> 00:10:36,085
and he'd play and sing.

175
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,221
Even the crickets
would keep quiet.

176
00:10:39,256 --> 00:10:40,473
I bet you
they did, too.

177
00:10:40,508 --> 00:10:43,592
And the bullfrogs
down at the pond-

178
00:10:43,627 --> 00:10:47,346
it was just as if they
had stopped their noise

179
00:10:47,381 --> 00:10:49,231
so they could
hear the music.

180
00:10:54,889 --> 00:10:59,241
Then the yankees came...

181
00:10:59,276 --> 00:11:05,498
like blue locusts they had
to eat away at the trees...

182
00:11:05,533 --> 00:11:07,366
the land...

183
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:13,622
...and everything on it.

184
00:11:13,657 --> 00:11:16,759
I owe them for much.

185
00:11:18,627 --> 00:11:21,764
For our house...

186
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:24,266
our land...

187
00:11:24,301 --> 00:11:26,769
our trees...

188
00:11:26,804 --> 00:11:30,523
for everything that was...

189
00:11:30,558 --> 00:11:34,276
including my husband's life.

190
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:44,904
I owe them for much.

191
00:11:44,939 --> 00:11:46,789
Ma'am...

192
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:48,657
hmm?

193
00:11:48,692 --> 00:11:51,794
Why don't you go
away from here?

194
00:11:51,829 --> 00:11:54,296
This place is
no good for you.

195
00:11:54,331 --> 00:11:58,050
Why, this place is all i have.

196
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:02,421
Sergeant?

197
00:12:02,456 --> 00:12:04,306
Yes, ma'am.

198
00:12:04,341 --> 00:12:08,677
What do you suppose
happened to that yankee

199
00:12:08,712 --> 00:12:11,180
who... who killed my husband?

200
00:12:11,215 --> 00:12:15,568
Do you suppose he's marching
home to his own kin now?

201
00:12:15,603 --> 00:12:18,070
Do you suppose
he's laughing and singing

202
00:12:18,105 --> 00:12:23,075
and telling all his neighborhood
about the rebels he's killed?

203
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:26,829
All the bullets and all
the heads he shot them through?

204
00:12:26,864 --> 00:12:28,080
No, ma'am,

205
00:12:28,115 --> 00:12:32,451
i don't reckon anything
like that at all.

206
00:12:32,486 --> 00:12:36,455
And you let that kind
of poison set on your mind,

207
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,340
you'll die from it, ma'am.

208
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:42,711
I got a gun inside.

209
00:12:42,746 --> 00:12:44,096
A gun?

210
00:12:44,131 --> 00:12:46,348
Uh-huh.

211
00:12:46,383 --> 00:12:48,851
It's an old shotgun.

212
00:12:50,719 --> 00:12:54,473
And i keep thinking
about how someday-

213
00:12:54,508 --> 00:12:58,227
some moment- a yankee
is going to come by here,

214
00:12:58,262 --> 00:12:59,478
and i'm going to
take out that gun,

215
00:12:59,513 --> 00:13:01,981
and i'm going
to aim it at him.

216
00:13:02,016 --> 00:13:03,866
I'm going to
aim it at him,

217
00:13:03,901 --> 00:13:05,734
but first i'm
going to tell him

218
00:13:05,769 --> 00:13:07,620
that he can
consider this

219
00:13:07,655 --> 00:13:09,488
the last shot
of the civil war;

220
00:13:09,523 --> 00:13:15,127
a bullet in exchange
for the one my husband took.

221
00:13:15,162 --> 00:13:18,380
No, ma'am, i don't want
to hear no more talk

222
00:13:18,415 --> 00:13:20,249
about butchery and bloodshed.

223
00:13:20,284 --> 00:13:24,003
There's hundreds and thousands
of our men and boys

224
00:13:24,038 --> 00:13:25,888
that were killed and maimed.

225
00:13:25,923 --> 00:13:29,008
And then mr. Lincoln...
murdered.

226
00:13:29,043 --> 00:13:32,144
No, i don't want to hear
no more about...

227
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:40,019
who's that?

228
00:13:40,054 --> 00:13:41,904
Hello?

229
00:13:41,939 --> 00:13:43,772
Yes.

230
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:46,275
I wonder if you
could tell me

231
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:48,777
if there's any
water around here?

232
00:13:48,812 --> 00:13:51,280
There's some water
out here in the well.

233
00:13:51,315 --> 00:13:53,165
I'm sure the lady
of the house

234
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,668
wouldn't mind if you
had some, lieutenant.

235
00:13:55,703 --> 00:13:58,787
You...
you traveling far?

236
00:13:58,822 --> 00:14:01,290
Just up the road.

237
00:14:01,325 --> 00:14:03,792
But i've been
on it a long time.

238
00:14:03,827 --> 00:14:05,678
You, too?

239
00:14:05,713 --> 00:14:07,546
Yes...

240
00:14:07,581 --> 00:14:10,683
yes, a long time.

241
00:14:10,718 --> 00:14:16,305
Oh... still, it seems
to me that i know you.

242
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:19,441
We met somewhere, huh?

243
00:14:19,476 --> 00:14:22,561
That's possible.

244
00:14:22,596 --> 00:14:25,698
I don't know what it is
but i'm trying to remember.

245
00:14:25,733 --> 00:14:29,201
Go on,
what is it that you remember?

246
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:31,820
I got it.

247
00:14:31,855 --> 00:14:34,323
I got it, i was laying
on the side of the road,

248
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:37,459
a shell had just exploded,
tore off half my foot.

249
00:14:37,494 --> 00:14:39,328
You came by
with a patrol of yankees,

250
00:14:39,363 --> 00:14:42,464
and you stopped there
on the side of the road,

251
00:14:42,499 --> 00:14:44,333
and you bent over
and you took care of me.

252
00:14:44,368 --> 00:14:46,218
You stopped the bleeding.

253
00:14:46,253 --> 00:14:48,087
Don't you remember that,
lieutenant?

254
00:14:48,122 --> 00:14:51,090
Yes, i remember that.

255
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:52,841
Sure, of course you do!

256
00:14:52,876 --> 00:14:55,978
I'd like you to meet
the lady of the house.

257
00:14:56,013 --> 00:14:57,229
Ma'am, this is... ma'am!

258
00:14:57,846 --> 00:15:00,349
You best pay heed to
the sergeant's gratitude

259
00:15:00,384 --> 00:15:03,485
because it's the last
gift you'll ever get

260
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,354
this i promise you.

261
00:15:05,389 --> 00:15:08,357
Let me have
that gun, ma'am.

262
00:15:08,392 --> 00:15:09,742
This your pleasure, ma'am?

263
00:15:09,777 --> 00:15:11,493
And duty.

264
00:15:11,528 --> 00:15:13,362
A little of both perhaps.

265
00:15:13,397 --> 00:15:14,997
Then you'd best get on with it.

266
00:15:15,032 --> 00:15:18,117
Ma'am, lieutenant here
tried to save my life.

267
00:15:18,152 --> 00:15:19,368
You've thanked him.

268
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,253
Now if you'll
step aside

269
00:15:21,288 --> 00:15:23,756
so i can thank him
for a few other services...

270
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:35,267
i... i couldn't have missed you.

271
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,639
I couldn't have
missed you.

272
00:15:40,674 --> 00:15:42,524
It doesn't make
any difference

273
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:45,027
whether you did or
whether you didn't.

274
00:15:45,062 --> 00:15:46,278
Wait a minute...

275
00:15:46,313 --> 00:15:49,398
wait a minute,
now it's coming...

276
00:15:49,433 --> 00:15:53,152
now, i got- i remember they
got you that day, lieutenant.

277
00:15:53,187 --> 00:15:54,903
You were tending me

278
00:15:54,938 --> 00:15:58,040
and this shell exploded
in the trees over our head

279
00:15:58,075 --> 00:16:01,160
and this hot steel went
spraying all over the place.

280
00:16:01,195 --> 00:16:04,913
I remember you standing up
and clawing at your eyes

281
00:16:04,948 --> 00:16:06,165
and screaming, "i'm blind!"

282
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,667
I remember thinking
they killed you.

283
00:16:08,702 --> 00:16:11,804
I remember... thinking
that you were dead.

284
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,923
That doesn't make
any difference now either.

285
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:18,427
That water
from the well...

286
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,181
certainly, lieutenant.

287
00:17:10,479 --> 00:17:12,865
I wish you the best, ma'am.

288
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,617
I do wish you
the best.

289
00:17:15,652 --> 00:17:17,119
And you, sir.

290
00:17:17,154 --> 00:17:19,621
Thank you.

291
00:17:19,656 --> 00:17:22,741
And this, too,
shall pass.

292
00:17:22,776 --> 00:17:25,878
This, too,
shall pass.

293
00:17:25,913 --> 00:17:30,249
Wait and see.
Wait and see.

294
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:49,818
Miss godwin?

295
00:17:49,853 --> 00:17:52,321
Good morning, sergeant.

296
00:17:52,356 --> 00:17:53,572
Morning, ma'am.

297
00:17:53,607 --> 00:17:55,441
You come down for a mintue?

298
00:17:55,476 --> 00:17:57,943
Mm-hmm.

299
00:18:06,702 --> 00:18:07,336
You're leaving?

300
00:18:07,371 --> 00:18:09,204
Yes, ma'am, i'm leaving.

301
00:18:09,239 --> 00:18:11,707
I come to say good-bye
and to thank you.

302
00:18:11,742 --> 00:18:15,461
I got to get back on the road,
to wherever the road leads.

303
00:18:15,496 --> 00:18:17,963
Well, i can tell you
where that road leads.

304
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,100
It leads past 50 miles
of places like this,

305
00:18:21,135 --> 00:18:22,351
burned-out houses and...

306
00:18:22,386 --> 00:18:24,219
yes, ma'am, but...

307
00:18:24,254 --> 00:18:26,722
you see, mrs. Godwin,
i was up most of the night

308
00:18:26,757 --> 00:18:29,224
and i was thinking
about a lot of things.

309
00:18:29,259 --> 00:18:32,361
I was thinking about
that blind lieutenant

310
00:18:32,396 --> 00:18:34,980
and your young friend,
charlie constable,

311
00:18:35,015 --> 00:18:37,483
with the blood
on his hat,

312
00:18:37,518 --> 00:18:42,121
and... and then sometime during
the night they stopped coming,

313
00:18:42,156 --> 00:18:47,126
and it got quiet on the road
there, it got real quiet.

314
00:18:47,161 --> 00:18:52,131
And in that quiet just before
dawn, it come to me...

315
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:54,633
what did?

316
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:01,757
I don't know just how
to explain it to you, ma'am,

317
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,259
but it's got to do
with that road

318
00:19:04,294 --> 00:19:05,894
and those men
moving down.

319
00:19:05,929 --> 00:19:08,397
There was union soldiers,
too, ma'am.

320
00:19:08,432 --> 00:19:11,900
Some of them helping my boys,
some of my boys helping them

321
00:19:11,935 --> 00:19:16,271
but all of them, all of them
moving down that road together

322
00:19:16,306 --> 00:19:17,523
just as if...

323
00:19:18,273 --> 00:19:20,159
just as if what?

324
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,280
I don't know, ma'am.

325
00:19:25,315 --> 00:19:27,783
But there's something down
the end of that road,

326
00:19:27,818 --> 00:19:29,668
and i got to find out
what it is.

327
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:34,173
So, i'll just take
my leave, ma'am,

328
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:35,424
and i wish you well.

329
00:19:35,459 --> 00:19:40,429
Sergeant, sergeant,
i'd be alone.

330
00:19:40,464 --> 00:19:42,931
Please don't go,
stay here.

331
00:19:42,966 --> 00:19:43,799
No, ma'am.

332
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,935
There's nothing here that
could ever belong to me.

333
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:50,689
What do you think you'll find
at the end of that road?

334
00:19:50,724 --> 00:19:52,558
A future? A new south, perhaps?

335
00:19:52,593 --> 00:19:56,311
A new confederacy
born out of the ashes?

336
00:19:56,346 --> 00:19:57,563
Please...

337
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:05,704
? black is the color
of my true love's hair...?

338
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,324
Jud!

339
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,335
How fares
my wife?

340
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:22,838
Oh, jud, please...

341
00:20:22,873 --> 00:20:24,723
please, oh...

342
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,094
i've been ill, jud.

343
00:20:29,129 --> 00:20:30,979
I've been very ill.

344
00:20:31,014 --> 00:20:35,984
But i'll be all right,
now you've come home.

345
00:20:36,019 --> 00:20:37,853
This was home,
lavinia.

346
00:20:37,888 --> 00:20:39,738
It isn't any longer.

347
00:20:39,773 --> 00:20:42,241
We can rebuild it all.

348
00:20:42,276 --> 00:20:45,360
We can paint
and we can plow the fields,

349
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:47,246
and we can buy seed...

350
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:51,617
what's the matter, jud?

351
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,119
Sergeant?

352
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:57,873
Captain.

353
00:20:57,908 --> 00:21:00,375
You know.

354
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:01,627
I think i do.

355
00:21:01,662 --> 00:21:04,129
I'm not sure,
but i think i do.

356
00:21:04,164 --> 00:21:06,632
Mrs. Godwin,
i have no doubt...

357
00:21:06,667 --> 00:21:08,517
no doubt at all

358
00:21:08,552 --> 00:21:11,019
i'll be seeing
you again in time

359
00:21:11,054 --> 00:21:12,888
at the end
of that road.

360
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:30,405
Jud, what's happened?

361
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:36,044
Your life, lavinia-

362
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:39,164
well, it's kind
of like a song.

363
00:21:39,199 --> 00:21:42,301
You play it
right to the end,

364
00:21:42,336 --> 00:21:45,420
and when the notes
are finished,

365
00:21:45,455 --> 00:21:50,425
and they die out,
there's only silence.

366
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,928
And that's
when you move on.

367
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,064
Jud?

368
00:21:56,099 --> 00:21:57,933
Are we...

369
00:21:57,968 --> 00:21:59,818
are we dead?

370
00:21:59,853 --> 00:22:02,321
Yes, like all those
men on the road.

371
00:22:02,356 --> 00:22:04,823
Mine came at yellow
tavern with a bullet,

372
00:22:04,858 --> 00:22:06,692
and yours came
here with a fever.

373
00:22:06,727 --> 00:22:08,577
No, jud, no.

374
00:22:08,612 --> 00:22:09,194
I am alive!

375
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:11,079
And i don't want
to leave here

376
00:22:11,114 --> 00:22:12,331
because if i do,

377
00:22:12,366 --> 00:22:14,199
it means that i've
given up everything.

378
00:22:14,234 --> 00:22:16,084
But there's nothing
to give up.
Jud, don't leave me.

379
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:18,587
I'm not leaving
you, my darling.

380
00:22:18,622 --> 00:22:20,455
I'll wait for you.

381
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:22,958
I'll meet you at
the end of the road.

382
00:22:22,993 --> 00:22:24,209
Oh, jud.

383
00:22:24,244 --> 00:22:25,460
I'll wait for you.

384
00:22:25,495 --> 00:22:27,346
Jud, come back to me!

385
00:22:27,381 --> 00:22:29,214
Jud, come back!

386
00:22:29,249 --> 00:22:31,717
Jud...

387
00:22:34,888 --> 00:22:37,973
you're staying
behind, my dear?

388
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:44,863
Maybe... maybe
it's not so wise.

389
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:48,617
I'm afraid.

390
00:22:48,652 --> 00:22:51,119
Of course you are.

391
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:53,622
And i am, too.

392
00:22:55,741 --> 00:23:01,630
"Of all the wonders
that i yet have heard

393
00:23:01,665 --> 00:23:04,132
"it seems to me
most strange

394
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,635
"that men should
fear;

395
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:11,006
"seeing that death,
a necessary end,

396
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:14,142
will come
when it'll come."

397
00:23:14,177 --> 00:23:18,513
That's from shakespeare,
julius caesar.

398
00:23:18,548 --> 00:23:21,016
You see, my dear,
i'm dead, too.

399
00:23:21,051 --> 00:23:22,901
I guess you might say

400
00:23:22,936 --> 00:23:26,021
i'm the last casualty
of the civil war.

401
00:23:28,273 --> 00:23:29,524
No.

402
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:38,784
And i'm the last
man on this road.

403
00:23:38,819 --> 00:23:40,669
No.

404
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:48,794
Jud!

405
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:51,296
Jud!

406
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:59,554
Incident on a dirt road
during the month of april,

407
00:23:59,589 --> 00:24:01,440
the year 1865.

408
00:24:01,475 --> 00:24:03,308
As we've already pointed out,

409
00:24:03,343 --> 00:24:06,445
it's a road
that won't be found on a map,

410
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:11,450
but it's one of many that lead
in and out of the twilight zone.

411
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:17,038
Rod serling,
creator ofthe twilight zone,

412
00:24:17,073 --> 00:24:18,907
will tell you
about next week's story

413
00:24:18,942 --> 00:24:23,094
after this word
from our alternate sponsor.

414
00:24:23,129 --> 00:24:25,130
And now, mr. Serling.

415
00:24:25,165 --> 00:24:26,998
Next week
we engage in a game of pool

416
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:29,501
that's both an activity
and a title.

417
00:24:29,536 --> 00:24:31,386
A play written
by george clayton johnson

418
00:24:31,421 --> 00:24:33,889
and starring mr. Jack klugman
and mr. Jonathan winters.

419
00:24:33,924 --> 00:24:37,008
It's the story about
the best pool player living

420
00:24:37,043 --> 00:24:38,894
and the best pool player dead.

421
00:24:38,929 --> 00:24:42,013
And this one, we submit, will
stay with you for quite a while.

422
00:24:42,048 --> 00:24:47,018
Next week onthe twilight zone,
"a game of pool."

423
00:25:17,332 --> 00:25:20,018
You have no answer for her
except "yes."

424
00:25:20,635 --> 00:25:22,521
To help many people
in many ways,

425
00:25:22,556 --> 00:25:26,274
give the united way.
