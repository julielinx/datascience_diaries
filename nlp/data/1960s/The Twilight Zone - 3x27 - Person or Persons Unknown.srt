1
00:00:10,377 --> 00:00:12,879
You're traveling
through another dimension-

2
00:00:12,914 --> 00:00:16,016
a dimension not only of sight
and sound, but of mind,

3
00:00:16,051 --> 00:00:17,267
a journey into a wondrous land

4
00:00:17,302 --> 00:00:19,769
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

5
00:00:19,804 --> 00:00:22,889
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

6
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,811
Oh, great-

7
00:01:01,846 --> 00:01:04,314
just great.

8
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:16,693
Oh, never- never, never again.

9
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:21,948
Oh, sure...

10
00:01:21,983 --> 00:01:23,833
you go right ahead
and sleep.

11
00:01:23,868 --> 00:01:25,702
That's right.

12
00:01:25,737 --> 00:01:27,587
Never mind
about how i feel.

13
00:01:27,622 --> 00:01:30,707
I'm an hour late
to work but so what?

14
00:01:30,742 --> 00:01:33,843
No skin off your
pretty little
nose, right?

15
00:01:38,214 --> 00:01:39,466
Oh, boy.

16
00:01:39,501 --> 00:01:40,717
What a wife.

17
00:01:40,752 --> 00:01:43,219
What a doll of a wife.

18
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:48,224
You could have at least
taken my shoes off, you know.

19
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:55,231
I didn't want to go
to that stupid party.

20
00:01:55,266 --> 00:01:57,734
"I ought to stay home and read."

21
00:01:57,769 --> 00:02:02,622
"Oh, no, can't do that
and hurt old petey's feelings."

22
00:02:02,657 --> 00:02:04,491
Oh, boy, oh, boy.

23
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:09,746
I go to work and suffer all day
and she sacks out until noon.

24
00:02:09,781 --> 00:02:12,248
That's fair.

25
00:02:14,751 --> 00:02:16,386
Oh, boy.

26
00:02:16,421 --> 00:02:17,637
Oh, boy...

27
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:21,391
oh, what next?

28
00:02:21,426 --> 00:02:23,259
Wilma!

29
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:27,013
Wilma, what have you done
with my razor?

30
00:02:27,048 --> 00:02:28,515
Hey, hey, come on.

31
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:30,400
Come on, wake up.

32
00:02:31,686 --> 00:02:33,520
Come on, will you?

33
00:02:33,555 --> 00:02:34,154
I'm late.

34
00:02:34,189 --> 00:02:36,022
Wilma- hey.

35
00:02:36,057 --> 00:02:37,273
Never mind
the dramatics.

36
00:02:37,308 --> 00:02:39,776
Just tell me where
you put my razor.

37
00:02:40,812 --> 00:02:42,028
Don't do that.

38
00:02:42,063 --> 00:02:43,913
What's the matter-
you sick?

39
00:02:43,948 --> 00:02:45,782
Who are you?

40
00:02:45,817 --> 00:02:46,783
What?

41
00:02:46,818 --> 00:02:48,168
Who are you?

42
00:02:48,203 --> 00:02:50,036
What are you doing
in my bedroom?

43
00:02:50,071 --> 00:02:52,672
You mean this isn't
the y.m.c.a.?

44
00:02:52,707 --> 00:02:54,541
Honey, will you knock it off?

45
00:02:54,576 --> 00:02:55,792
I'm late- tell me

46
00:02:55,827 --> 00:02:57,794
where you
put the razor.

47
00:02:57,829 --> 00:03:00,046
Darling, i am in no mood
for jokes.

48
00:03:00,081 --> 00:03:02,048
You get out of here.

49
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:04,434
Wilma... wilma?

50
00:03:04,469 --> 00:03:05,301
How do you know my name?

51
00:03:05,336 --> 00:03:07,187
It's on the marriage
certificate.

52
00:03:07,222 --> 00:03:08,304
Remember?

53
00:03:08,339 --> 00:03:10,807
Mister, i've never
seen you before

54
00:03:10,842 --> 00:03:11,441
in all my life.

55
00:03:13,309 --> 00:03:16,446
Cameo of a man who has just lost
his most valuable possession.

56
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:18,314
He doesn't know it yet.

57
00:03:18,349 --> 00:03:20,817
In fact, he doesn't even
know about the possession-

58
00:03:20,852 --> 00:03:22,702
because, like most people,

59
00:03:22,737 --> 00:03:24,571
david gurney has never
really thought

60
00:03:24,606 --> 00:03:26,456
about the matter
of his identity.

61
00:03:26,491 --> 00:03:28,958
But he's going
to be thinking about it

62
00:03:28,993 --> 00:03:30,210
a great deal from now on

63
00:03:30,245 --> 00:03:32,078
because that is what he's lost

64
00:03:32,113 --> 00:03:34,581
and his search for it
is going to take him

65
00:03:34,616 --> 00:03:37,717
into the darkest corners
of the twilight zone.

66
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,852
Now, look, whoever you are,
i don't want any trouble,

67
00:03:55,887 --> 00:03:57,103
but if you
don't leave

68
00:03:57,138 --> 00:03:58,988
i'm going to
call the police.

69
00:03:59,023 --> 00:04:00,240
Call the police.

70
00:04:00,275 --> 00:04:01,491
Call the
fire department.

71
00:04:01,526 --> 00:04:03,993
Tell them to bring
an oxygen mask.

72
00:04:04,028 --> 00:04:05,245
There is a man dying.

73
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,496
I'm not bluffing.

74
00:04:06,531 --> 00:04:07,113
If you don't
get out of here

75
00:04:07,148 --> 00:04:08,998
by the time i count
five, i'll call them.

76
00:04:09,033 --> 00:04:10,867
Oh, come on!
Cut it out, will you? One...

77
00:04:10,902 --> 00:04:12,118
i am not amused! Two...

78
00:04:12,153 --> 00:04:15,255
three, four, five.
All right...

79
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:16,506
give me the...

80
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:18,374
what is the matter
with you?

81
00:04:18,409 --> 00:04:19,626
Don't touch me.

82
00:04:19,661 --> 00:04:22,128
This is what i call
a delayed reaction!

83
00:04:22,163 --> 00:04:24,013
Two martinis at midnight

84
00:04:24,048 --> 00:04:27,133
and she gets stoned at
10:00 in the morning!

85
00:04:27,168 --> 00:04:29,018
Look, i suggest
you go to bed

86
00:04:29,053 --> 00:04:30,270
and sleep it off.

87
00:04:30,305 --> 00:04:32,138
What are you
going to do?

88
00:04:32,173 --> 00:04:35,892
Change my clothes,
if you don't mind.

89
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:39,028
Where are my socks?

90
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:43,533
What in the
name of...?

91
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:49,038
All right.

92
00:04:49,073 --> 00:04:50,907
Would you mind
telling me

93
00:04:50,942 --> 00:04:52,158
what is going on?

94
00:04:57,163 --> 00:04:59,048
Where are
my clothes?

95
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:01,417
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

96
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:04,554
I do not know
what is going on

97
00:05:04,589 --> 00:05:06,422
but i suppose
it's another one

98
00:05:06,457 --> 00:05:08,925
of pete's ridiculous
little gags.

99
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,061
Well, you can tell him
that it didn't come off.

100
00:05:12,096 --> 00:05:13,313
Now, i'm going to work

101
00:05:13,348 --> 00:05:15,815
and when i come home,
you had better have

102
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:18,935
everything straightened out,
do you understand?

103
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,689
No, no, that's very
thoughtful of you

104
00:05:22,724 --> 00:05:24,574
but i'm not much in
the mood for breakfast.

105
00:05:24,609 --> 00:05:26,442
Thanks, anyway.

106
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:41,341
Nut.

107
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:04,113
Good morning, jim.

108
00:06:04,148 --> 00:06:06,616
Good morning.

109
00:06:06,651 --> 00:06:08,868
Hi, jack.

110
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,740
Good morning,
julie, fred.

111
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,635
Yes, sir,
may i help you?

112
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:28,137
George,
who's that?

113
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:30,640
That's mr. Cooper.

114
00:06:30,675 --> 00:06:33,893
Would you mind telling me
what mr. Cooper is doing

115
00:06:33,928 --> 00:06:35,144
at my desk?

116
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:37,647
Beg pardon?

117
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:44,771
I'm sorry, mr. Kline.

118
00:06:44,806 --> 00:06:46,656
Without better security,

119
00:06:46,691 --> 00:06:49,158
i'm afraid there's nothing
we can do for you.

120
00:06:51,027 --> 00:06:52,278
Who the devil
are you?

121
00:06:52,313 --> 00:06:52,912
How's that?

122
00:06:53,529 --> 00:06:54,781
I said, who the
devil are you

123
00:06:54,816 --> 00:06:57,283
and what are you
doing at my desk?

124
00:06:57,318 --> 00:06:58,785
Yourdesk?

125
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,670
That's right- my desk.

126
00:07:00,705 --> 00:07:03,172
I've had enough of this today.

127
00:07:03,207 --> 00:07:04,424
Get out of that chair.

128
00:07:04,459 --> 00:07:06,292
I'll do nothing of the kind.

129
00:07:06,327 --> 00:07:08,294
Get out or i'll
throw you out.

130
00:07:08,329 --> 00:07:10,430
There's no need
to get excited.

131
00:07:11,047 --> 00:07:12,298
After the morning
i put in!

132
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:14,183
And would you
be kind enough

133
00:07:14,218 --> 00:07:16,052
to take this
junk with you?

134
00:07:16,087 --> 00:07:17,303
What's the
trouble, sir?

135
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:20,940
Look, jim, this little joke
has gone far enough.

136
00:07:21,557 --> 00:07:23,443
He says this
ishisdesk.

137
00:07:23,478 --> 00:07:25,945
Step outside, sir,
we can settle this.

138
00:07:26,062 --> 00:07:27,947
There is nothing
to be settled

139
00:07:27,982 --> 00:07:31,701
except i would like my nameplate
back and my picture.

140
00:07:31,736 --> 00:07:33,569
I'm afraid i'll
have to insist.

141
00:07:33,604 --> 00:07:34,821
I'm not budging.

142
00:07:34,856 --> 00:07:35,455
Yes, you are.

143
00:07:36,072 --> 00:07:37,457
Jim, you get your hand off me

144
00:07:37,492 --> 00:07:39,959
or i'll see to it
that you're fired.

145
00:07:39,994 --> 00:07:41,828
We'll talk
about it outside.

146
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:44,964
Put your hands up, mister.

147
00:07:44,999 --> 00:07:46,833
What?

148
00:07:46,868 --> 00:07:47,834
Put your hands up.

149
00:07:49,085 --> 00:07:50,970
Has everybody gone crazy?

150
00:07:51,005 --> 00:07:52,588
Walk three paces
in front of me.

151
00:07:52,623 --> 00:07:55,725
Don't cause any trouble
or i'll have to shoot.

152
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,345
Move!

153
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,848
Call the police, sir.

154
00:08:01,883 --> 00:08:03,099
George,
what is this?

155
00:08:03,134 --> 00:08:05,601
All right,
keep moving.

156
00:08:13,109 --> 00:08:14,494
Wilma!

157
00:08:14,529 --> 00:08:16,362
Will you tell
these people

158
00:08:16,397 --> 00:08:17,864
who i am?

159
00:08:17,899 --> 00:08:18,865
Is that the man?

160
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,116
Yes.

161
00:08:20,151 --> 00:08:22,618
What's your
name, mister?

162
00:08:22,653 --> 00:08:24,504
Ask her.

163
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,623
She doesn't
know.

164
00:08:27,658 --> 00:08:28,875
She doesn't know?!

165
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:30,760
After 11 years
of marriage?

166
00:08:30,795 --> 00:08:32,011
Mrs. Gurney,
allow me

167
00:08:32,046 --> 00:08:33,262
to introduce
myself.

168
00:08:33,297 --> 00:08:34,514
I'm david
gurney-

169
00:08:35,131 --> 00:08:37,133
your husband-
remember?

170
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:40,520
Don't stand
there staring
like idiots.

171
00:08:40,555 --> 00:08:42,388
That's
who i am-
david gurney.

172
00:08:42,423 --> 00:08:44,891
Jim, now,
please, will
you tell them?

173
00:08:44,926 --> 00:08:47,393
Look, i've worked
with this man

174
00:08:47,428 --> 00:08:48,027
for four years.

175
00:08:48,062 --> 00:08:49,278
Now, tell them!

176
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:52,782
Julie.

177
00:08:52,817 --> 00:08:54,650
Fred.

178
00:08:54,685 --> 00:08:56,536
George, will
you tell them?

179
00:08:59,655 --> 00:09:00,907
Tell them who i am!

180
00:09:00,942 --> 00:09:02,158
All right,
let's go.

181
00:09:02,193 --> 00:09:03,409
Wait a minute!

182
00:09:03,444 --> 00:09:07,163
You say i'm not
david gurney, right?

183
00:09:07,198 --> 00:09:08,915
I'll prove it
to you.

184
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,920
Let's see what you
have to say to this.

185
00:09:13,955 --> 00:09:16,422
My driver's license
and credit cards-

186
00:09:16,457 --> 00:09:18,307
what have you done with them?!

187
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,311
Wait a minute!

188
00:09:22,346 --> 00:09:24,180
I'm david gurney.

189
00:09:24,215 --> 00:09:26,682
I'm david gurney!

190
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:48,704
I don't care what you say,

191
00:09:48,739 --> 00:09:51,207
i know who i am.

192
00:09:51,242 --> 00:09:53,092
Mister...
gurney! Gurney!

193
00:09:53,709 --> 00:09:54,961
David andrew gurney!

194
00:09:54,996 --> 00:09:56,212
There's no need
for excitement...

195
00:09:56,247 --> 00:09:58,097
oh, of course not!

196
00:09:58,132 --> 00:10:00,600
All of a sudden,
everyone's telling me
i don't know who i am,

197
00:10:00,635 --> 00:10:01,851
and you say there's no
reason for excitement.

198
00:10:01,886 --> 00:10:04,353
Well, what do you expect
me to do, relax?!

199
00:10:06,257 --> 00:10:09,358
No, i suppose not.

200
00:10:09,393 --> 00:10:11,227
I know it must be
quite a shock,

201
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:14,981
but, look, if we're
to help you, mister...

202
00:10:15,016 --> 00:10:18,734
you've got to face facts.

203
00:10:18,769 --> 00:10:21,871
You see, this man
you think you are-

204
00:10:21,906 --> 00:10:24,373
he doesn't really exist...

205
00:10:24,408 --> 00:10:27,493
except in your mind.

206
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:32,498
Whether whole cloth
or from people you've met,

207
00:10:32,533 --> 00:10:35,001
you've invented him.

208
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:39,388
There is no david
andrew gurney.

209
00:10:39,423 --> 00:10:40,640
You're lying.

210
00:10:40,675 --> 00:10:42,508
Oh, come, come. Why?
I don't know.

211
00:10:42,543 --> 00:10:43,759
Why? Why should i...?
I don't know.

212
00:10:43,794 --> 00:10:45,011
But you are;
you've got to be.

213
00:10:45,046 --> 00:10:48,147
Now, listen, a man
doesn't live 35 years
knowing who he is,

214
00:10:48,182 --> 00:10:50,016
and then, just because he's
lost his driver's license...

215
00:10:50,051 --> 00:10:52,518
no, no, no, no.
It wasn't just that.

216
00:10:52,553 --> 00:10:56,272
This woman, uh,
miss berenson-

217
00:10:56,307 --> 00:10:57,523
the woman you think
you're married to...

218
00:10:57,558 --> 00:10:58,774
knowi'm married to,

219
00:10:58,809 --> 00:11:01,277
and her name isn't
berenson, it's gurney!

220
00:11:05,066 --> 00:11:07,533
I see you're gonna
require more proof.

221
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:11,921
Well, that can
be arranged.

222
00:11:11,956 --> 00:11:13,172
Come with me, please.

223
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:17,543
Oh, uh, you haven't met
your fellow patient.

224
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,931
That's winston churchill.

225
00:11:26,302 --> 00:11:27,553
So he thinks.

226
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:31,941
Poor chap...

227
00:11:31,976 --> 00:11:34,443
no one knows
who he really is.

228
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:49,458
Now, let me see how
i can prove it to you.

229
00:11:49,493 --> 00:11:51,327
The phone- let me
use the phone.

230
00:11:51,362 --> 00:11:53,212
Of course.

231
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:55,715
What number?

232
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,834
Klondike 5-2131.

233
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,222
Let me have an
outside line please.

234
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:06,342
Dr. Koslenko.

235
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:19,488
Hello, pete?

236
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,991
It's dave.

237
00:12:23,859 --> 00:12:25,745
Pete, it's dave gurney.

238
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:32,618
Well, how do
you like that?

239
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,503
He's my best friend.

240
00:12:34,538 --> 00:12:36,372
We went to
school together.

241
00:12:36,407 --> 00:12:38,874
More?

242
00:12:38,909 --> 00:12:40,126
Yes.

243
00:12:40,161 --> 00:12:42,628
Yes, call
klondike 5-3472.

244
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:49,885
Seven, two.

245
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,776
Ask for mrs. Gurney.

246
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:02,398
I'd like to speak with
mrs. Gurney, please.

247
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,534
Just a moment, please.

248
00:13:05,569 --> 00:13:07,403
Hello, mom?

249
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:10,539
Oh, thank god,
thank god.

250
00:13:10,574 --> 00:13:12,408
Mom...

251
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:16,162
this is dave.

252
00:13:16,197 --> 00:13:17,413
What's the matter, mom?

253
00:13:17,448 --> 00:13:19,298
Don't you recognize my voice?

254
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:21,167
It's dave.

255
00:13:21,202 --> 00:13:23,052
Your son.

256
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:30,559
Mom... mom, now stop it.

257
00:13:30,594 --> 00:13:32,428
Don't do this to me, please!

258
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,935
Forgive the
call, please.

259
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:41,187
It was
a mistake.

260
00:13:41,222 --> 00:13:43,072
Thank you.

261
00:13:48,979 --> 00:13:51,947
You are david
andrew gurney.

262
00:13:51,982 --> 00:13:56,952
You live at 2457
lime rock avenue.

263
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:58,204
That's right.

264
00:13:58,239 --> 00:13:59,455
You're sure?

265
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:01,340
Yes, i'm sure!

266
00:14:01,957 --> 00:14:03,843
Do you have
a telephone?

267
00:14:03,878 --> 00:14:05,094
Certainly, i have a phone.

268
00:14:05,129 --> 00:14:06,345
It's likely
that your number

269
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:10,716
would be listed in the
directory, isn't it?

270
00:14:10,751 --> 00:14:11,350
Yes.

271
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,608
You'll notice
that that is...

272
00:14:19,643 --> 00:14:22,111
the current edition.

273
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,733
Go ahead.

274
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:57,146
Now do you
believe me?

275
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,266
I don't know.

276
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:03,152
I don't know.

277
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:05,654
Maybe i should,
but i...

278
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,408
all right.

279
00:15:09,443 --> 00:15:13,162
All right, if i'm
not david gurney,

280
00:15:13,197 --> 00:15:15,030
then who am i?

281
00:15:15,065 --> 00:15:17,533
That's what we're going
to try to find out.

282
00:15:17,568 --> 00:15:19,418
In other words,
i'm crazy,

283
00:15:19,453 --> 00:15:21,921
like that guy who
thinks he's churchill.

284
00:15:21,956 --> 00:15:22,538
Is that it?

285
00:15:22,573 --> 00:15:24,423
Let's just say-

286
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:26,292
mentally
disturbed.

287
00:15:26,327 --> 00:15:28,177
I know it's very
difficult to believe,

288
00:15:28,212 --> 00:15:30,045
but looking at
it logically,

289
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,548
there isn't
any other
explanation.

290
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:33,799
Sometime last night,

291
00:15:33,834 --> 00:15:35,050
you had what
is known as

292
00:15:35,085 --> 00:15:36,936
a total loss
of orientation.

293
00:15:36,971 --> 00:15:39,438
You entered miss
berenson's house...

294
00:15:39,473 --> 00:15:40,055
no, no.

295
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:41,307
No, no, no!

296
00:15:41,342 --> 00:15:43,809
That's what you
want me to believe,
but it isn't true

297
00:15:43,844 --> 00:15:46,946
because in spite of
everything, doctor,
i know who i am!

298
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,448
Either i am crazy

299
00:15:49,483 --> 00:15:52,568
or somebody's going to
an awful lot of trouble

300
00:15:52,603 --> 00:15:53,819
to blot me out.

301
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:55,070
Now, now, now...

302
00:15:55,105 --> 00:15:58,207
why would anyone want
to blot you out?

303
00:15:58,242 --> 00:15:59,458
How should i know?

304
00:15:59,493 --> 00:16:01,327
But whoever or
whatever it is-

305
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:03,078
they can rig
every phone book

306
00:16:03,113 --> 00:16:04,964
and they can pay off
everyone i know

307
00:16:05,581 --> 00:16:07,466
but they can't get
inside my mind.

308
00:16:07,501 --> 00:16:09,335
And i'll tell you
something else-

309
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:11,220
they can't think
of everything.

310
00:16:11,255 --> 00:16:12,471
And what does
that mean?

311
00:16:12,506 --> 00:16:13,722
Just that.

312
00:16:13,757 --> 00:16:15,591
A man's life
is made up

313
00:16:15,626 --> 00:16:16,842
of a million
details.

314
00:16:16,877 --> 00:16:19,345
Some of those
details are private.

315
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,596
I've gone places,
i've done things

316
00:16:20,631 --> 00:16:22,481
that i've never
told to anyone-

317
00:16:22,516 --> 00:16:23,732
not even my wife.

318
00:16:23,767 --> 00:16:24,483
Of course...

319
00:16:24,518 --> 00:16:26,986
i'm sure that's
quite true.

320
00:16:27,021 --> 00:16:30,105
Now, suppose we go
back to your room

321
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:32,608
and you think about it.

322
00:16:32,643 --> 00:16:34,493
Oh, no-you
think about it

323
00:16:34,528 --> 00:16:36,362
because i'm
going to find

324
00:16:36,397 --> 00:16:38,247
one of those
details- now!

325
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:08,143
Sorry- got to get away.

326
00:17:08,178 --> 00:17:09,395
Hey, hey!

327
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:31,050
Wait a minute.

328
00:17:31,085 --> 00:17:33,552
Before you say anything,
give me a drink.

329
00:17:33,587 --> 00:17:34,803
Anything in particular?

330
00:17:34,838 --> 00:17:36,672
The usual.

331
00:17:36,707 --> 00:17:37,923
Huh?

332
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:38,674
The...

333
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:42,428
the usual.

334
00:17:42,463 --> 00:17:43,679
Irish whiskey.

335
00:17:43,714 --> 00:17:45,431
I'm sorry, buddy.

336
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,824
Sam...

337
00:17:55,859 --> 00:17:57,693
look at me.

338
00:17:57,728 --> 00:17:59,578
Okay, i'm looking
at you.

339
00:17:59,613 --> 00:18:00,829
Who am i?

340
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:03,332
How many guesses
do i get, huh?

341
00:18:03,367 --> 00:18:04,583
No, think, sam.

342
00:18:04,618 --> 00:18:06,452
Who comes in here
every friday night

343
00:18:06,487 --> 00:18:08,337
for the last
three years?

344
00:18:08,372 --> 00:18:09,588
My wife.

345
00:18:09,623 --> 00:18:10,205
Who else?

346
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,708
A lot of people
come in here.

347
00:18:12,743 --> 00:18:15,210
What about...

348
00:18:15,245 --> 00:18:16,462
what about
dave gurney?

349
00:18:16,497 --> 00:18:17,713
Who?

350
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,218
That's it, huh?

351
00:18:23,253 --> 00:18:25,104
They got to him, too.

352
00:18:25,139 --> 00:18:26,972
All right.

353
00:18:27,007 --> 00:18:28,223
But how?

354
00:18:28,258 --> 00:18:30,109
I kept this place a secret.

355
00:18:30,144 --> 00:18:32,611
I never told anybody about it.

356
00:18:32,646 --> 00:18:35,114
Would you like another drink?

357
00:18:35,149 --> 00:18:36,982
Yeah.

358
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,626
Sam...

359
00:18:47,661 --> 00:18:49,495
sam-

360
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:51,880
what would you do
if all of a sudden

361
00:18:51,915 --> 00:18:55,000
everybody started telling you
you weren't you.

362
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,002
What?!

363
00:18:57,037 --> 00:19:00,139
I mean, everybody-
your wife, your friends.

364
00:19:00,174 --> 00:19:01,507
Everyone suddenly

365
00:19:01,542 --> 00:19:04,009
couldn't recognize
you anymore.

366
00:19:04,044 --> 00:19:06,395
They were saying
sam baker didn't exist.

367
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:09,398
I'd tell them to switch brands.

368
00:19:09,433 --> 00:19:11,767
But you wouldn't
believe them?

369
00:19:11,802 --> 00:19:13,018
Give me another one.

370
00:19:14,269 --> 00:19:16,772
I think you've
had enough.

371
00:19:16,807 --> 00:19:18,023
Oh...

372
00:19:18,058 --> 00:19:20,526
i've had more
than enough, sam.

373
00:19:20,561 --> 00:19:22,411
How do you
know my name?

374
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:25,414
Because we're friends.

375
00:19:25,449 --> 00:19:27,666
Your wife's
name is pearl.

376
00:19:27,701 --> 00:19:30,786
Your kids' names
are joey and linda.

377
00:19:30,821 --> 00:19:32,287
You live in white oak.

378
00:19:32,322 --> 00:19:34,173
You used to be a prizefighter-
"powerhouse baker."

379
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:35,424
Your picture's

380
00:19:35,459 --> 00:19:36,925
on the wall

381
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,177
right next to
harry grebb.

382
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:48,303
Wait a minute...

383
00:19:48,338 --> 00:19:49,188
are you all right?

384
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:52,941
I think so.

385
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,947
Keep your fingers
crossed, sam.

386
00:19:58,982 --> 00:20:00,816
I may have found
that little detail

387
00:20:00,851 --> 00:20:02,067
they overlooked.

388
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:10,826
What's the number again?

389
00:20:10,861 --> 00:20:13,328
6708-777.

390
00:20:13,363 --> 00:20:14,580
You sure?

391
00:20:14,615 --> 00:20:15,831
Positive.

392
00:20:15,866 --> 00:20:16,465
I lost the slip

393
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,333
but i remember
that number

394
00:20:18,368 --> 00:20:20,219
because of
the four sevens.

395
00:20:20,254 --> 00:20:21,470
Maybe your
wife's got it.

396
00:20:21,505 --> 00:20:23,338
She doesn't know
it was taken.

397
00:20:23,373 --> 00:20:25,224
I was going
to surprise her.

398
00:20:25,259 --> 00:20:27,092
You sure it
was the 14th?

399
00:20:27,127 --> 00:20:27,726
Yes, on a sunday.

400
00:20:27,761 --> 00:20:28,977
We were at the zoo.

401
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:30,846
Oh, i'm sorry.

402
00:20:30,881 --> 00:20:32,231
Hey, wait a minute.

403
00:20:32,266 --> 00:20:34,099
Is that a seven
or a one?

404
00:20:34,134 --> 00:20:35,350
Seven.

405
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:39,738
Is that it?

406
00:20:41,024 --> 00:20:42,858
Yes.

407
00:20:42,893 --> 00:20:44,109
Yes, that's it.

408
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,111
Are you okay, mister?

409
00:20:46,146 --> 00:20:47,362
Yeah...

410
00:20:47,397 --> 00:20:48,614
yeah, i'm fine.

411
00:20:48,649 --> 00:20:49,865
Okay, that'll be $1.75.

412
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,116
Hey, wait a minute!

413
00:20:51,151 --> 00:20:52,367
You owe me money.

414
00:20:52,402 --> 00:20:54,870
Well, doctor,
what brings you here?

415
00:20:54,905 --> 00:20:57,372
I might ask you
the same question.

416
00:20:57,407 --> 00:20:59,875
To elude us, you
shouldn't have left

417
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:01,760
that stolen
car downstairs.

418
00:21:01,795 --> 00:21:03,128
This man owes
me money.

419
00:21:03,163 --> 00:21:04,379
Oh...

420
00:21:04,414 --> 00:21:05,631
$1.81 to be exact-

421
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:07,516
for proof that
i'm not crazy.

422
00:21:07,551 --> 00:21:10,636
I told you they couldn't
think of everything.

423
00:21:10,671 --> 00:21:12,521
I suppose you
found a signature

424
00:21:12,556 --> 00:21:13,772
or a receipt...

425
00:21:13,807 --> 00:21:15,023
but that's not proof

426
00:21:15,058 --> 00:21:17,526
because i could've signed
a signature anytime...

427
00:21:17,561 --> 00:21:18,143
right.

428
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:19,394
...or had a card
printed up,

429
00:21:19,429 --> 00:21:20,646
or faked a
driver's license.

430
00:21:20,681 --> 00:21:21,897
Right.

431
00:21:21,932 --> 00:21:23,148
But what about a photograph,
doctor?

432
00:21:23,183 --> 00:21:25,033
What about a photograph of me
holding hands

433
00:21:25,068 --> 00:21:27,536
with a girl who claims
she never laid eyes on me

434
00:21:27,571 --> 00:21:28,153
before this morning?

435
00:21:28,188 --> 00:21:30,038
How would you explain that?

436
00:21:30,073 --> 00:21:31,406
Take it out and look at it.

437
00:21:31,441 --> 00:21:33,292
Then think up some answers.

438
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:38,914
Well?

439
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:47,055
But i...

440
00:21:48,924 --> 00:21:50,175
i saw her.

441
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:53,929
Look, look you saw her.

442
00:21:53,964 --> 00:21:55,180
You saw my wife.

443
00:21:55,215 --> 00:21:57,065
Oh, listen,
mister,

444
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,568
you didn't show
me nothing.

445
00:21:59,603 --> 00:22:01,436
But i tell you she was there.

446
00:22:01,471 --> 00:22:02,688
We were together!

447
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:05,824
No.

448
00:22:05,859 --> 00:22:06,692
We were together.

449
00:22:06,727 --> 00:22:07,943
We were together...

450
00:22:07,978 --> 00:22:10,445
we were together.
We were together.

451
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,447
Together, together.

452
00:22:12,482 --> 00:22:15,584
Together... together...

453
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:18,954
we were togeth... er...

454
00:22:18,989 --> 00:22:20,205
dave?

455
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,708
Dave, honey, wake up.

456
00:22:22,743 --> 00:22:23,959
Wake up, honey.

457
00:22:23,994 --> 00:22:25,210
What?

458
00:22:26,461 --> 00:22:28,347
Oh.

459
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:31,466
Oh, wilma, wilma.

460
00:22:31,501 --> 00:22:32,718
Oh, wait a minute.

461
00:22:32,753 --> 00:22:34,603
Let me get this
junk off my face.

462
00:22:34,638 --> 00:22:35,854
Don't go away.

463
00:22:35,889 --> 00:22:37,105
Oh, don't worry.

464
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,357
I won't.

465
00:22:47,768 --> 00:22:49,618
What's the
matter, honey?

466
00:22:49,653 --> 00:22:50,869
You sound
terrible.

467
00:22:50,904 --> 00:22:52,738
Did you have
a nightmare?

468
00:22:52,773 --> 00:22:56,491
Oh, baby, i hadthenightmare...

469
00:22:56,526 --> 00:22:58,377
the granddaddy of them all.

470
00:22:58,412 --> 00:23:00,245
That'll
teach you

471
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,381
to mix scotch and martinis.

472
00:23:02,416 --> 00:23:03,999
Yeah,
that'll teach me all right.

473
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:05,884
I'm sorry i
didn't put you

474
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:07,753
in your
pajamas, honey

475
00:23:07,788 --> 00:23:09,004
but i was
a little

476
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,255
out of things
myself.

477
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:11,506
You forgive me?

478
00:23:11,541 --> 00:23:14,009
Yeah, sure, sure.

479
00:23:14,044 --> 00:23:15,761
Well, you're in a rare mood.

480
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:36,915
Honey, what's wrong?

481
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,535
Are you ill?

482
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:43,038
Dave, why
are you

483
00:23:43,073 --> 00:23:44,923
looking at me
like that?

484
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:46,174
Dave, honey?

485
00:23:50,545 --> 00:23:51,797
Dave...?

486
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:58,053
A case of mistaken identity or
a nightmare turned inside out?

487
00:23:58,088 --> 00:24:01,189
A simple loss of memory
or the end of the world?

488
00:24:01,224 --> 00:24:04,309
David gurney may never
find the answer

489
00:24:04,344 --> 00:24:06,812
but you can be sure
he's looking for it

490
00:24:06,847 --> 00:24:09,314
in the twilight zone.

491
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:16,121
Rod serling, creator of
the twilight zone,

492
00:24:16,156 --> 00:24:19,875
will tell you about next week's
story, after this message.

493
00:24:22,093 --> 00:24:23,145
And now, mr. Serling.

494
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:25,630
Next week, we take a trip
through a galaxy

495
00:24:25,665 --> 00:24:26,882
to few million light-years away

496
00:24:26,917 --> 00:24:29,384
from your collective
television screens.

497
00:24:29,419 --> 00:24:31,253
We'll land
on an uncharted asteroid

498
00:24:31,288 --> 00:24:32,504
and then undergo an experience

499
00:24:32,539 --> 00:24:34,389
designed for goose bumps
and palpitations

500
00:24:34,424 --> 00:24:36,258
because, in the twilight zone,
next time out,

501
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:40,011
you'll see that monsters come in
all assorted sizes and shapes.

502
00:24:40,046 --> 00:24:41,263
I hope we whetted your appetite,

503
00:24:41,298 --> 00:24:43,148
and if so,
we'll see you next week.

504
00:24:43,765 --> 00:24:45,650
Our show is called
"the little people."

505
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:19,050
Every litter bit hurts,

506
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:22,304
so think before you throw.

507
00:25:22,339 --> 00:25:25,440
Keep america clean
and beautiful.
