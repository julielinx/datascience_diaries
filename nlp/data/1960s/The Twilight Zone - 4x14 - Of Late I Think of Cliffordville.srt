1
00:00:07,258 --> 00:00:10,360
You unlock this door
with the key of imagination.

2
00:00:10,395 --> 00:00:12,228
Beyond it
is another dimension-

3
00:00:12,263 --> 00:00:14,731
a dimension of sound,

4
00:00:14,766 --> 00:00:16,616
a dimension of sight,

5
00:00:16,651 --> 00:00:19,119
a dimension of mind.

6
00:00:19,154 --> 00:00:21,621
You're moving into a land
of both shadow and substance,

7
00:00:21,656 --> 00:00:23,490
of things and ideas.

8
00:00:23,525 --> 00:00:26,626
You've just crossed over
into the twilight zone.

9
00:00:47,897 --> 00:00:50,400
I have an appointment
with mr. Feathersmith.

10
00:00:50,435 --> 00:00:53,520
Oh, yes, mr. Deidrich,
he's expecting you, sir.

11
00:00:53,555 --> 00:00:54,771
Right this way.

12
00:01:02,412 --> 00:01:03,663
Oh, wow.

13
00:01:03,698 --> 00:01:06,166
I could just
see him now.

14
00:01:06,783 --> 00:01:08,668
That big, happy grin
on his face

15
00:01:08,703 --> 00:01:11,171
just before he
draws the blood.

16
00:01:11,206 --> 00:01:15,542
"Have a cigar, mr. Deidrich,
before i rip you to pieces.

17
00:01:15,577 --> 00:01:18,678
"But i must have my
little fun first.

18
00:01:18,713 --> 00:01:20,547
Have a cigar."

19
00:01:20,582 --> 00:01:24,184
Have a cigar, mr. Deidrich.

20
00:01:24,219 --> 00:01:27,303
Thank you, no,
mr. Feathersmith.

21
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:32,942
You asked me to come here
at 2:00; it is now 2:00.

22
00:01:32,977 --> 00:01:35,945
What did you have
on your mind?

23
00:01:37,814 --> 00:01:39,949
Hmm, you never have
cared for my habits

24
00:01:39,984 --> 00:01:42,452
have you,
mr. Deidrich?

25
00:01:42,487 --> 00:01:44,320
Whether i do
or don't

26
00:01:44,355 --> 00:01:46,823
is not at issue,
mr. Feathersmith.

27
00:01:46,858 --> 00:01:49,959
But the extent of time
you keep me here

28
00:01:49,994 --> 00:01:52,462
is, on the other hand,
of considerable import.

29
00:01:52,497 --> 00:01:55,582
I'm a busy man,
let's get on with it.

30
00:01:55,617 --> 00:01:59,719
We've come a pretty far route,
haven't we, the two of us?

31
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:02,472
So?

32
00:02:02,507 --> 00:02:04,340
So, it's odd
how our lives

33
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:07,477
seem to crisscross
back and forth.

34
00:02:07,512 --> 00:02:10,980
I owe you a great deal,
mr. Deidrich, i really do.

35
00:02:11,015 --> 00:02:14,100
I remember vividly one afternoon

36
00:02:14,135 --> 00:02:16,603
when you called me into your
office, and said:

37
00:02:16,638 --> 00:02:20,356
"Bill feathersmith,
i like your style, boy.

38
00:02:20,391 --> 00:02:22,859
I want you in with me."

39
00:02:22,894 --> 00:02:25,995
You remember that afternoon,
mr. Deidrich?

40
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:28,114
I shall never forget it.

41
00:02:28,149 --> 00:02:31,251
I have given it
a good deal of thought

42
00:02:31,286 --> 00:02:32,502
in the ensuing years

43
00:02:32,537 --> 00:02:35,872
and shall never cease
to regret it.

44
00:02:35,907 --> 00:02:37,757
You never did like me.

45
00:02:37,792 --> 00:02:40,260
I wouldn't say that,
mr. Feathersmith.

46
00:02:40,295 --> 00:02:46,132
I wouldn't say that i...
never did like you.

47
00:02:46,167 --> 00:02:49,886
I have disliked
and detested you

48
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:52,388
with great cordiality.

49
00:02:52,423 --> 00:02:54,891
I have found you to be

50
00:02:54,926 --> 00:02:56,776
from the moment
you came into my office

51
00:02:56,811 --> 00:03:00,530
a predatory, grasping...

52
00:03:00,565 --> 00:03:06,152
conniving, acquisitive
animal of a man.

53
00:03:06,187 --> 00:03:09,906
Without heart,
without conscience

54
00:03:09,941 --> 00:03:13,660
without... compassion.

55
00:03:13,695 --> 00:03:18,665
Without even a subtle hint
of the common decencies.

56
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:22,418
Shall we go on from there?

57
00:03:22,453 --> 00:03:25,171
I give you this, mr. Deidrich:

58
00:03:25,206 --> 00:03:29,559
You never were one to toady
around with phony euphemisms.

59
00:03:29,594 --> 00:03:32,679
You always did speak your mind.

60
00:03:32,714 --> 00:03:34,314
And you, mr. Feathersmith,

61
00:03:34,931 --> 00:03:38,685
this is perhaps the singular
compliment i can dredge up:

62
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,187
You've always been a man
to speak yours.

63
00:03:41,222 --> 00:03:43,690
So why don't you?

64
00:03:43,725 --> 00:03:47,577
All right, then.

65
00:03:47,612 --> 00:03:50,079
I'll dopreciselythat.

66
00:03:56,703 --> 00:04:01,090
This... is my empire,
mr. Deidrich.

67
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:06,095
Mining, steel, electronics,
lumber, railroads,

68
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:08,598
minerals, manufacturing...

69
00:04:08,633 --> 00:04:12,218
it's been a step-by-step,
piece-by-piece building up

70
00:04:12,253 --> 00:04:14,103
of an industrial complex

71
00:04:14,138 --> 00:04:16,606
that i take
pardonable pride in.

72
00:04:16,641 --> 00:04:21,611
But there is one...
piece... missing.

73
00:04:21,646 --> 00:04:27,233
That is to say, therewas
one piece missing...

74
00:04:27,268 --> 00:04:31,621
the deidrich tool
and die company

75
00:04:31,656 --> 00:04:34,741
employing 13,000 men.

76
00:04:34,776 --> 00:04:37,243
A good and
substantial plant

77
00:04:37,278 --> 00:04:39,746
in operation
some 40 years.

78
00:04:39,781 --> 00:04:44,133
Not always perfectly managed,
but adequately managed.

79
00:04:44,168 --> 00:04:47,887
Sufficiently well-managed to
make you move heaven and earth

80
00:04:47,922 --> 00:04:51,641
to try to buy it on the first
monday of each month.

81
00:04:51,676 --> 00:04:54,761
But thank heaven i won't
live to see the day

82
00:04:54,796 --> 00:04:57,263
when you stick your greasy-ham
fists into it.

83
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:05,772
You call it well-managed.

84
00:05:05,807 --> 00:05:08,274
You're speaking comparatively,
of course.

85
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:10,777
I'm speaking of
that little matter

86
00:05:10,812 --> 00:05:13,913
of your financial problems.

87
00:05:14,163 --> 00:05:16,032
I happen to know for a fact

88
00:05:16,067 --> 00:05:18,534
that you secured a loan
for $3 million...

89
00:05:19,168 --> 00:05:21,671
a loan payable on demand.

90
00:05:21,706 --> 00:05:24,924
Here is the note.

91
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:27,176
I bought up that
note, mr. Deidrich.

92
00:05:27,211 --> 00:05:29,679
I paid an exorbitant
amount of money for it...

93
00:05:29,714 --> 00:05:31,547
more than it was worth.

94
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:38,054
But it was, well, shall i say,
an excellent opportunity-

95
00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:43,059
an opportunity for our lives
to crisscross again.

96
00:05:43,094 --> 00:05:45,561
So, to the point:

97
00:05:45,596 --> 00:05:49,699
It reads, "payable on demand."

98
00:05:49,734 --> 00:05:55,571
So, mr. Deidrich,
on demand, it is.

99
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:58,207
I am calling
this note.

100
00:05:58,242 --> 00:06:00,710
I want it paid...
$3 million

101
00:06:00,745 --> 00:06:01,961
not tomorrow...

102
00:06:01,996 --> 00:06:05,081
not this evening
around suppertime...

103
00:06:05,116 --> 00:06:08,835
now, mr. Deidrich,
this moment!

104
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,837
I want your personal check
in that amount

105
00:06:10,872 --> 00:06:13,339
or i'll have to send
a few sign painters

106
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:16,476
out to the deidrich tool
and die company

107
00:06:16,511 --> 00:06:19,729
and have them cross
off the name deidrich!

108
00:06:21,597 --> 00:06:26,602
Feathersmith...
if you call that note...

109
00:06:29,105 --> 00:06:32,859
you'll bankrupt me.

110
00:06:32,894 --> 00:06:36,612
You'll kill off
everything i have.

111
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:42,869
Everything i own...
everything.

112
00:06:42,904 --> 00:06:44,754
Witness a murder.

113
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:47,874
The killer is
mr. William feathersmith,

114
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:50,510
a robber baron whose body
composition is made up

115
00:06:50,545 --> 00:06:53,012
of a refrigeration plant
covered by thick skin.

116
00:06:53,047 --> 00:06:56,132
In a moment, mr. Feathersmith
will proceed

117
00:06:56,167 --> 00:06:58,634
in his daily course of conquest
and calumny

118
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:00,520
with yet another
business dealing.

119
00:07:00,555 --> 00:07:04,273
But this will be one
of those bizarre transactions

120
00:07:04,308 --> 00:07:06,776
that take place
in an odd marketplace

121
00:07:06,811 --> 00:07:09,278
known as... the twilight zone.

122
00:07:24,994 --> 00:07:26,245
Miss pepper, miss pepper!

123
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,131
Yes, sir?

124
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:56,275
Take me down,
young man.

125
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:59,412
Take me all
the way down...

126
00:07:59,447 --> 00:08:03,166
if there's anyplace
lower than this floor.

127
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:22,552
Excuse me, sir, uh, i
didn't know you were here.

128
00:08:22,587 --> 00:08:27,557
Well, i am here, lafayette.

129
00:08:27,592 --> 00:08:30,059
I am most assuredly here.

130
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:35,064
Andhereis the mountaintop.

131
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:41,320
High rung on the ladder,
way up on the mountaintop.

132
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:45,074
Like, now, what... let's see,
what was his name...

133
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:48,211
genghis khan?

134
00:08:48,246 --> 00:08:50,713
Genghis...

135
00:08:50,748 --> 00:08:51,964
khan...

136
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:53,833
feathersmith?

137
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,981
What's the matter
with me?

138
00:09:13,236 --> 00:09:15,738
Who are you, anyway?

139
00:09:15,773 --> 00:09:20,109
Hecate, sir, custodian
of the top three floors.

140
00:09:20,144 --> 00:09:23,863
And so, you're hecate,

141
00:09:23,898 --> 00:09:28,251
custodian of the top
three floors, hmm?

142
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:32,121
You... have
a drink, hecate,

143
00:09:32,156 --> 00:09:35,875
custodian of the top
three floors.

144
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:40,263
Thank you, no sir,
but i appreciate that.

145
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,516
Tell me, how long
have you been

146
00:09:43,551 --> 00:09:46,636
performing this
illustrious task?

147
00:09:46,671 --> 00:09:49,138
34 years, sir.

148
00:09:49,173 --> 00:09:53,526
I've been in this building
for 34 years.

149
00:09:53,561 --> 00:09:58,531
I got a... got a gold watch
last year.

150
00:09:58,566 --> 00:10:02,902
A gold watch...
34 years in the building.

151
00:10:02,937 --> 00:10:07,907
Your aggressive self-assurance
unnerves me, hecate.

152
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:12,912
That's practically as long
as i've been in the building.

153
00:10:12,947 --> 00:10:15,414
But i didn't start
here, hecate.

154
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:19,168
No, indeed, i started
in a little town

155
00:10:19,203 --> 00:10:20,419
called cliffordville.

156
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:22,922
Cliffordville, indiana.

157
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:25,424
You ever hear of it, hecate?

158
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:31,063
It's a coincidence, sir,
i was born in cliffordville.

159
00:10:31,098 --> 00:10:33,566
I grew up there.

160
00:10:33,601 --> 00:10:37,436
Well, well, well,
we're very much alike.

161
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:41,190
Both from cliffordville

162
00:10:41,225 --> 00:10:44,944
we both put on our pants
one leg at a time

163
00:10:44,979 --> 00:10:49,332
and there,
the similarity ends.

164
00:10:49,367 --> 00:10:51,701
Cliffordville,
hmm?

165
00:10:51,736 --> 00:10:55,454
Well, that was areal
town, wasn't it, hecate?

166
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:57,340
A real place.

167
00:10:57,375 --> 00:11:01,460
When a man could go up to the
moon if he had a mind to

168
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:03,346
and the legs to carry him

169
00:11:03,381 --> 00:11:06,465
and fingers
to stretch out and grasp.

170
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:10,603
Hmm, not like
now.

171
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:14,974
Hmm...

172
00:11:15,009 --> 00:11:17,476
no...

173
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:21,864
not like now at all.

174
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:33,125
Genghis khan...
feathersmith, hmm.

175
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:41,000
Alexander the great...
feathersmith.

176
00:11:41,035 --> 00:11:46,005
I've got everything
there is to get...

177
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:51,010
but i'm still hungry.

178
00:11:51,045 --> 00:11:56,265
He cried because he had
no more worlds to conquer.

179
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,402
What?

180
00:11:59,437 --> 00:12:04,407
That was alexander the great.

181
00:12:04,442 --> 00:12:08,160
He cried because he had
no more worlds to conquer.

182
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:11,280
I guess...

183
00:12:11,315 --> 00:12:15,668
i guess maybe he was... kind
of like you, mr. Feathersmith.

184
00:12:18,788 --> 00:12:21,924
You know something, hecate?

185
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:26,295
I wish i could go back
to cliffordville

186
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:29,432
and begin again, i mean
start all over.

187
00:12:29,467 --> 00:12:33,803
You see, getting it,
that was the kick...

188
00:12:33,838 --> 00:12:37,556
getting it, not having it.

189
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:45,197
Good night, mr. Hecate,

190
00:12:45,232 --> 00:12:48,317
custodian of the top
three floors.

191
00:12:48,352 --> 00:12:52,071
Don't forget
to wind your gold watch.

192
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:26,989
Just one minute.

193
00:13:27,024 --> 00:13:30,109
You left me off
at the wrong floor.

194
00:13:30,144 --> 00:13:31,994
This isn't the lobby.

195
00:13:40,788 --> 00:13:42,621
How do you do, sir?

196
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:44,507
Who are you?

197
00:13:44,542 --> 00:13:48,260
Devlin, first name's
not important.

198
00:13:48,295 --> 00:13:50,129
I own this building.

199
00:13:50,164 --> 00:13:52,631
I'm aware of that,
mr. Feathersmith.

200
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,517
I'm aware of that,
but i'm not aware

201
00:13:54,552 --> 00:13:56,385
of you having an office
here, whoever you are.

202
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:59,522
Oh, i just opened it up.

203
00:13:59,557 --> 00:14:01,390
As a matter of fact

204
00:14:01,425 --> 00:14:04,527
i've opened it
foryourconvenience.

205
00:14:04,562 --> 00:14:06,395
Won't you sit down?

206
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:08,280
Why?

207
00:14:08,315 --> 00:14:11,400
Why, because, we've
got some business

208
00:14:11,435 --> 00:14:13,903
to transact,
you and i.

209
00:14:13,938 --> 00:14:17,039
And there's no reason why
we shouldn't be comfortable.

210
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,434
Go on, mr. Feathersmith,
you were saying?

211
00:14:45,469 --> 00:14:51,073
Hmm? Oh, the name of the town
was cliffordville.

212
00:14:51,108 --> 00:14:53,943
Ah, yes, cliffordville.

213
00:14:53,978 --> 00:14:55,828
And it was a pleasant town?

214
00:14:55,945 --> 00:14:59,698
Of course it was pleasant.
It was better than pleasant.

215
00:15:01,584 --> 00:15:07,206
There was a girl there,
name of gibbons.

216
00:15:07,241 --> 00:15:10,342
Father was president
of the bank.

217
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:13,462
Beautiful girl.

218
00:15:13,497 --> 00:15:16,215
And you enjoyed this,
didn't you, mr. Feathersmith?

219
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:23,222
I didn't have time to enjoy
anything. I worked! Worked!

220
00:15:23,257 --> 00:15:28,227
I dug, i scratched, i pushed,
i drove.

221
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:32,615
I went up... up!
You understand that?

222
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:36,986
And now you're up.
You're all the way up.

223
00:15:37,021 --> 00:15:40,122
And... you're simply bored.

224
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:44,493
That's what you are,
mr. Feathersmith, plain bored.

225
00:15:44,528 --> 00:15:47,630
It's worse than bored.

226
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:55,137
I'm ruthless now.

227
00:15:55,172 --> 00:16:01,393
I... just have no purpose,
no plans.

228
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:06,398
I have no drive because there's
no place to go.

229
00:16:07,016 --> 00:16:12,655
What about this...
stuff on your door?

230
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:14,523
A very succinct suggestion

231
00:16:14,558 --> 00:16:17,026
of the services i render,
mr. Feathersmith...

232
00:16:17,061 --> 00:16:19,528
travel... time travel.

233
00:16:22,031 --> 00:16:24,533
Miss devlin...

234
00:16:24,568 --> 00:16:28,921
let's you and i
talk something over.

235
00:16:28,956 --> 00:16:31,173
Indeed, mr. Feathersmith

236
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:33,676
i had intended
that we should.

237
00:16:33,711 --> 00:16:36,178
Let me suggest
a possible transaction.

238
00:16:36,213 --> 00:16:39,932
You say you're bored, you've
got everything you want.

239
00:16:39,967 --> 00:16:42,935
The pleasure's not
in the possession

240
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:44,803
it's in the desperate struggle
to possess.

241
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:47,306
That's the sense of it,
isn't it, mr. Feathersmith?

242
00:16:47,341 --> 00:16:48,440
Go on.

243
00:16:48,475 --> 00:16:49,692
Let's do this:

244
00:16:49,727 --> 00:16:52,194
Let's send you
back to cliffordville

245
00:16:52,229 --> 00:16:54,063
the cliffordville
of years ago.

246
00:16:54,098 --> 00:16:56,565
You can start
all over again.

247
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:01,570
Acquire, build, consolidate-
how does that sound?

248
00:17:01,605 --> 00:17:06,709
Miss devlin, you are not
dealing with a fool now.

249
00:17:06,744 --> 00:17:08,577
I am not one of your

250
00:17:08,612 --> 00:17:11,714
"sell your soul
for a nickel"

251
00:17:11,749 --> 00:17:13,582
country bumpkins.

252
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:16,719
Try this.

253
00:17:17,219 --> 00:17:19,722
Send me back in time
to cliffordville.

254
00:17:19,757 --> 00:17:22,224
But i want to look exactly
as i did then...

255
00:17:22,259 --> 00:17:24,093
that's number one.

256
00:17:24,128 --> 00:17:25,094
Agreed.

257
00:17:25,129 --> 00:17:26,345
Number two:

258
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,730
I want to have a memory

259
00:17:27,765 --> 00:17:30,849
of everything that's occurred
in the last 50 years.

260
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:33,352
I don't want that memory
impaired one bit!

261
00:17:33,387 --> 00:17:35,237
Check again,
mr. Feathersmith.

262
00:17:35,738 --> 00:17:38,857
I want that town
exactly as it was

263
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:41,360
with the same people
that i remember.

264
00:17:41,744 --> 00:17:43,612
Allveryeasily arranged.

265
00:17:43,647 --> 00:17:44,863
Anything else?

266
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:48,751
I want it
to happen right away.

267
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:52,621
Time is of absolutely
no essence.

268
00:17:52,656 --> 00:17:54,506
You name the hour...

269
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:57,259
that is the hour
you shall have.

270
00:17:57,294 --> 00:17:59,762
Now, as to the price.

271
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:04,767
Yes, mr. Feathersmith,
as to price.

272
00:18:04,802 --> 00:18:09,772
Well, i suppose
thestandardpayment

273
00:18:09,807 --> 00:18:14,777
is, um, well, i guess you'd
call it the soul.

274
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:19,148
On occasion,
mr. Feathersmith

275
00:18:19,183 --> 00:18:22,901
that is
part of the transaction.

276
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:26,655
But in your case,
we got a hold of your soul

277
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:29,158
some time ago, i believe.

278
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:34,797
Let me check this.

279
00:18:36,665 --> 00:18:39,802
Ah, here it is.

280
00:18:42,304 --> 00:18:46,675
There was the crash of the
trans-mississippi debentures,

281
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:50,429
the company you'd bought
and then manipulated.

282
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:54,183
You ruined several hundred
people with that chicanery.

283
00:18:54,817 --> 00:18:56,685
There were four suicides
as a result.

284
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,188
I believe the bulk
of your soul

285
00:18:59,223 --> 00:19:01,690
went over to us
shortly thereafter.

286
00:19:02,324 --> 00:19:04,193
There are several
other items here

287
00:19:04,228 --> 00:19:07,329
under private life,
volume nine.

288
00:19:07,364 --> 00:19:09,198
Business transactions...

289
00:19:09,233 --> 00:19:13,585
subconscious thoughts
and dreams.

290
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:17,339
Ah, here we are...
indirect murders.

291
00:19:17,374 --> 00:19:19,842
People you drove
to ruin and poverty

292
00:19:19,877 --> 00:19:23,595
hopelessness,
ultimate death.

293
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:27,349
No, mr. Feathersmith,
i'm afraid your soul

294
00:19:27,384 --> 00:19:29,852
is not yours to negotiate.

295
00:19:29,887 --> 00:19:32,354
Then whatdoyou charge?

296
00:19:32,389 --> 00:19:34,606
Cash.

297
00:19:34,641 --> 00:19:38,360
The long green leaf
lettuce... currency.

298
00:19:38,395 --> 00:19:41,480
I have your current assets
tabulated here.

299
00:19:41,515 --> 00:19:43,982
Were you to liquidate
as of this moment

300
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:51,490
you'd be worth precisely
$36,891,412.14.

301
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:53,992
You're very
thorough.

302
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:57,129
We have to be thorough,
mr. Feathersmith.

303
00:19:57,164 --> 00:20:00,883
Now, the cost for what
you ask is nominal.

304
00:20:00,918 --> 00:20:03,385
The entire cost,
and that includes

305
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:07,139
transportation back, clothing,
retaining of your memory,

306
00:20:07,174 --> 00:20:10,893
maintenance of the town in
its historically accurate form

307
00:20:10,928 --> 00:20:13,395
including its citizenry

308
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:16,515
is, uh, $36,890,000

309
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:19,651
leaving you a balance of...

310
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:26,275
$1,412.14.

311
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:28,777
You robber!

312
00:20:28,812 --> 00:20:33,782
Mr. Feathersmith,
$1,412.14

313
00:20:33,817 --> 00:20:38,170
is... quite a little
nest egg, considering...

314
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:46,795
oh, perhaps, miss devlin,
perhaps,

315
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:50,549
considering i know
where the oil is

316
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:53,936
just outside of town.

317
00:20:55,804 --> 00:20:58,307
Ah, that's 1400 acres

318
00:20:58,342 --> 00:21:04,563
not discovered until, uh,
let's see, it was 1937

319
00:21:04,598 --> 00:21:05,814
when they brought
in the first well.

320
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:08,317
And i know the nature
of the stock market-

321
00:21:08,352 --> 00:21:12,070
which stocks will rise,
which stocks will fall.

322
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:13,572
I know every invention

323
00:21:13,607 --> 00:21:15,457
that's been perfected
in the last 50 years.

324
00:21:15,492 --> 00:21:17,960
I can get in
on the ground floor.

325
00:21:17,995 --> 00:21:21,713
The ground floor?
Why, the basement, sir.

326
00:21:21,748 --> 00:21:24,833
$1,412.14...

327
00:21:24,868 --> 00:21:27,336
is a fortune.

328
00:21:27,371 --> 00:21:29,972
Good, when do i start,
how soon?

329
00:21:30,007 --> 00:21:33,091
I can handle
the liquidation for you.

330
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:36,228
Just sign this
power of attorney

331
00:21:36,263 --> 00:21:37,479
and there's
no reason

332
00:21:37,514 --> 00:21:39,982
why you can't leave
immediately.

333
00:21:40,017 --> 00:21:41,850
Anything else?

334
00:21:41,885 --> 00:21:43,101
I think not.

335
00:21:44,353 --> 00:21:48,106
I think i might be able to
sweeten the pot a bit for you.

336
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:51,243
This very attractive banker's
daughter, for example.

337
00:21:51,278 --> 00:21:53,745
I could fix that up
for you most handily.

338
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:56,865
Do away with a traditional
lengthy courtship...

339
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:00,002
the ritualistic
formalities of the time.

340
00:22:00,037 --> 00:22:01,870
No, forget it.

341
00:22:01,905 --> 00:22:03,755
I'm going to work
for everything.

342
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:06,875
That's the fun of it,
that's the kick!

343
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:08,760
I'm going to work
for everything!

344
00:22:08,795 --> 00:22:11,880
You just send me back
with the 1,400-odd bucks

345
00:22:11,915 --> 00:22:14,383
and watchmysmoke,
sister!

346
00:22:14,418 --> 00:22:16,885
Ha, exemplary,
mr. Feathersmith,

347
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,136
really exemplary.

348
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:20,639
You're one
of the few remaining

349
00:22:20,674 --> 00:22:22,524
rugged individualists
of our time.

350
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:23,775
It's a pleasure doing
business with you.

351
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:28,146
Now, good-bye.

352
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:32,534
You'll arrive in cliffordville
at noon tomorrow.

353
00:22:32,569 --> 00:22:36,288
That's noon
of the year 1910.

354
00:22:36,323 --> 00:22:38,790
And needless to say,
mr. Feathersmith,

355
00:22:38,825 --> 00:22:41,910
i wish for you everything
that you deserve.

356
00:22:41,945 --> 00:22:46,298
Little lady, you don't have
to wish anything for me.

357
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:50,052
I get everything
i go after, everything!

358
00:22:50,087 --> 00:22:53,171
I believe you,
mr. Feathersmith.

359
00:22:53,206 --> 00:22:55,674
I have no doubt
whatsoever.

360
00:23:40,969 --> 00:23:44,106
This is your captain speaking.

361
00:23:44,141 --> 00:23:45,974
We are crossing
the indiana state line.

362
00:23:46,608 --> 00:23:47,859
For those of you
who are interested

363
00:23:47,894 --> 00:23:49,728
we have just gained an hour.

364
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:20,642
Cliffordville.

365
00:24:20,677 --> 00:24:23,762
This stop
is cliffordville.

366
00:24:23,797 --> 00:24:25,647
Cliffordville.

367
00:24:25,682 --> 00:24:28,767
The devil, you say.

368
00:24:40,662 --> 00:24:43,165
All aboard.

369
00:25:07,472 --> 00:25:11,860
Twilight zonewill continue
after station identification.

370
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,982
What's the matter, can't you
pave the roads around here?

371
00:26:05,614 --> 00:26:08,116
Hey, van winkle.

372
00:26:08,151 --> 00:26:10,001
You want something,
sir?

373
00:26:10,036 --> 00:26:11,870
Yeah, something.

374
00:26:12,504 --> 00:26:15,006
That yellow flag bit...
what's the holiday?

375
00:26:15,041 --> 00:26:17,259
Oh, them?

376
00:26:17,294 --> 00:26:18,126
Yes, them.

377
00:26:18,161 --> 00:26:21,880
Typhoid flags; they got
typhoid over there.

378
00:26:21,915 --> 00:26:26,017
Typhoid? Haven't those idiots
ever heard of innocu...

379
00:26:26,052 --> 00:26:31,640
oh, no, they haven't,
have they?

380
00:26:31,675 --> 00:26:34,142
No, not this year.

381
00:26:34,177 --> 00:26:39,147
Well, go back to sleep, rip,
i'll wake you when i need you.

382
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:42,901
Huh.

383
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:53,161
That's old man hecate!

384
00:26:53,795 --> 00:26:57,549
You got a great future, jack.

385
00:26:57,584 --> 00:26:59,417
A great future.

386
00:27:09,177 --> 00:27:11,429
I beg your pardon, sir.

387
00:27:11,464 --> 00:27:13,932
Mr. Deidrich, isn't it?

388
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:17,068
You, uh, have the advantage,
sir.

389
00:27:17,103 --> 00:27:19,571
Yes, i do indeed.

390
00:27:19,606 --> 00:27:22,073
But we'll get into that
later on.

391
00:27:25,193 --> 00:27:26,444
Wonderful having this...

392
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:30,448
little chat.

393
00:27:45,347 --> 00:27:47,849
Sit down, mr., uh...
mr. Feathersmith.

394
00:27:47,884 --> 00:27:49,718
I'll only be
a moment, sir.

395
00:27:49,753 --> 00:27:50,969
This is my
lunch hour

396
00:27:51,004 --> 00:27:54,105
and i never let business
interfere with pleasure.

397
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,608
And i never let pleasure
interfere with business.

398
00:27:56,643 --> 00:27:57,859
The name is
feathersmith.

399
00:27:58,476 --> 00:28:00,979
I'm not a peddler, drummer,
or door-to-door salesman.

400
00:28:01,014 --> 00:28:02,230
I'm here to make
myself rich.

401
00:28:02,265 --> 00:28:04,733
In the process, you can
lick up a few crumbs.

402
00:28:07,869 --> 00:28:08,486
I beg your pardon?

403
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,740
The widow turner's land,
is it available?

404
00:28:11,775 --> 00:28:14,626
The widow turner's land?

405
00:28:14,661 --> 00:28:15,877
There were
1400 acres.

406
00:28:16,494 --> 00:28:18,380
1400 acres?

407
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:20,248
Is there an echo here

408
00:28:20,283 --> 00:28:23,385
or would it help if i
hired an interpreter?

409
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:28,890
No, indeed, mr. Feathersmith,
no, indeed, it's just that, uh,

410
00:28:28,925 --> 00:28:30,759
well, sir, you're talking about

411
00:28:30,794 --> 00:28:33,895
a very valuable piece
of property.

412
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:35,897
I'm talking about
widow turner's land,

413
00:28:35,932 --> 00:28:37,148
south end of town.

414
00:28:37,183 --> 00:28:40,151
Indeed,
indeed, beautiful spot.

415
00:28:40,186 --> 00:28:42,020
1400 extravagantly
lovely acres.

416
00:28:42,055 --> 00:28:47,659
Singing birds
and constant sunshine.

417
00:28:47,694 --> 00:28:49,527
It's a garden of eden
for a man with vision

418
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:51,413
and the potential
is unlimited.

419
00:28:51,448 --> 00:28:55,533
It's a swamp for mosquitoes
and the potential is malaria.

420
00:28:55,568 --> 00:28:58,670
Tell me who owns it and how much
they want for it.

421
00:29:00,824 --> 00:29:03,925
Well, as a matter of fact,
that land was purchased

422
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:08,296
from the estate of the late
mrs. Turner by yours truly

423
00:29:08,331 --> 00:29:11,433
in partnership
with a mr. Sebastian deidrich

424
00:29:11,468 --> 00:29:13,301
here in town.

425
00:29:13,336 --> 00:29:15,804
We each own half of it.

426
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:17,689
Deidrich, huh?

427
00:29:17,724 --> 00:29:20,809
Well, do you suppose
that you and mr. Deidrich

428
00:29:20,844 --> 00:29:23,311
could bepersuaded
to part with it

429
00:29:23,346 --> 00:29:26,448
assuming the price is
within reason?

430
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:32,954
Well, as valuable
as that land is, uh...

431
00:29:32,989 --> 00:29:37,959
well, sir, uh,
everything has its price.

432
00:29:37,994 --> 00:29:41,713
How does $4.00 an acre
sound to you?

433
00:29:41,748 --> 00:29:42,464
Lovely...

434
00:29:42,499 --> 00:29:43,715
fine.

435
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:44,966
If i were an idiot.

436
00:29:45,001 --> 00:29:47,719
But i am not an idiot,
mr. Gibbons.

437
00:29:47,754 --> 00:29:50,221
I'll give you
50 cents an acre.

438
00:29:50,256 --> 00:29:54,592
Why don't we strike toward
a compromise and say... $3.00?

439
00:29:54,627 --> 00:29:56,344
Let's say 75 cents.

440
00:29:57,479 --> 00:30:01,232
You're a driver of a hard
bargain, mr. Feathersmith.

441
00:30:01,267 --> 00:30:03,735
However, both myself
and mr. Deidrich

442
00:30:04,352 --> 00:30:06,855
might hold still... for, uh...

443
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:09,357
$2.00 an acre.

444
00:30:09,858 --> 00:30:11,109
Hmm.

445
00:30:11,144 --> 00:30:14,245
Mr. Gibbons, you wouldn't
hold still for a back rub

446
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,748
if you couldn't convert it
into currency.

447
00:30:16,783 --> 00:30:18,616
One buck an acre,
and that's it.

448
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,119
A dollar an acre,
you say?

449
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:23,621
All right, a dollar
an acre, i say.

450
00:30:23,656 --> 00:30:26,758
And in eight seconds,
it'll go down to 80 cents.

451
00:30:26,793 --> 00:30:28,626
Going... going...

452
00:30:28,661 --> 00:30:31,129
gone, mr. Feathersmith.

453
00:30:31,164 --> 00:30:34,265
And i presume this will be
a cash transaction?

454
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,768
You just bring the deeds
to my hotel tonight

455
00:30:36,803 --> 00:30:39,270
properly signed
and notarized

456
00:30:39,305 --> 00:30:41,139
and i'll have
your money.

457
00:30:41,174 --> 00:30:43,641
Well, now, sir,
this is the way

458
00:30:43,676 --> 00:30:45,527
i like to have
a transaction.

459
00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:47,395
No fiddling around.

460
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:49,280
Just two staunch
men of goodwill

461
00:30:49,315 --> 00:30:51,149
who know
what they want.

462
00:30:51,783 --> 00:30:53,651
Don't you agree,
mr. Feathersmith?

463
00:30:53,686 --> 00:30:56,788
I agree with you right
down the line, mr. Gibbons

464
00:30:56,823 --> 00:30:58,656
assuming both your
hands are visible.

465
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:01,793
And i amnota widow
or an orphan.

466
00:31:04,913 --> 00:31:08,049
You have a daughter,
mr. Gibbons.

467
00:31:08,084 --> 00:31:09,300
Why...

468
00:31:09,335 --> 00:31:11,169
why, yes.

469
00:31:11,204 --> 00:31:12,804
Oh, do you mind?

470
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:14,055
Oh, no, please...

471
00:31:15,306 --> 00:31:17,809
joanna is her name.

472
00:31:17,844 --> 00:31:19,060
Yes.

473
00:31:19,095 --> 00:31:22,180
And as pretty a slice
of peach pie

474
00:31:22,215 --> 00:31:24,065
as ever went on a hayride.

475
00:31:24,682 --> 00:31:27,185
Mr. Feathersmith, that...

476
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,436
you're being insulting.

477
00:31:31,573 --> 00:31:34,692
No, mr. Gibbons,
i am not being insulting.

478
00:31:34,727 --> 00:31:37,829
I am being candid,
i am speaking my mind.

479
00:31:37,864 --> 00:31:40,331
I know what i like,
and i ask for it

480
00:31:40,366 --> 00:31:42,834
and i generally get it.

481
00:31:42,869 --> 00:31:47,205
Now, let's meet
this little doll.

482
00:31:50,341 --> 00:31:53,711
So i told daddy when he told me
that you were downstairs,

483
00:31:53,746 --> 00:31:55,597
i said, "it's about time

484
00:31:55,632 --> 00:31:58,099
we had a sophisticated man
in this town."

485
00:31:58,134 --> 00:31:59,350
Didn't i say that, daddy?

486
00:31:59,385 --> 00:32:01,219
Oh, have another bon-bon,
mr. Feathersmith.

487
00:32:01,254 --> 00:32:01,853
Uh, no.

488
00:32:01,888 --> 00:32:04,355
Oh, they're delicious.
Mm. This one's a cream.

489
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:07,475
Mm, a real good cream.
Oh, i just love cream.

490
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:08,726
Don't you like cream,
mr. Feathersmith?

491
00:32:08,761 --> 00:32:09,978
Oh, well...
oh, i love them.

492
00:32:10,013 --> 00:32:11,863
They're just goodie-goodie.

493
00:32:11,898 --> 00:32:14,365
Well, anyway,
when it was july,

494
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,234
we all went to
my aunt bertha's in maine.

495
00:32:16,269 --> 00:32:18,119
Have you ever been to maine,
mr. Feathersmith?

496
00:32:18,154 --> 00:32:19,988
Uh...
i love swimming.

497
00:32:20,023 --> 00:32:20,622
I just adore the ocean.

498
00:32:20,657 --> 00:32:23,124
I'm the best swimmer
in my class, huh, daddy?

499
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:26,244
Have another bon-bon,
mr. Feathersmith.
No thank you.

500
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:28,129
They're goodie-goodie.

501
00:32:28,164 --> 00:32:29,380
Hmm?

502
00:32:29,415 --> 00:32:31,249
Oh, oh.

503
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:34,385
Wh-why don't you
sing for us, joanna?

504
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,888
I'm sure mr. Feathersmith
would love that.

505
00:32:36,923 --> 00:32:40,008
Oh, i think he'd be bored with
music on this hot afternoon.

506
00:32:40,043 --> 00:32:41,893
Wouldn't you, mr. Feathersmith?

507
00:32:41,928 --> 00:32:43,761
Oh, well, if you insist.

508
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:12,540
? every little movement
has a meaning all its own?

509
00:33:13,791 --> 00:33:17,545
? every thought and feeling?

510
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:23,184
? by some
posture can be shown?

511
00:33:23,219 --> 00:33:28,306
? and every love song
that comes a-stealing?

512
00:33:28,341 --> 00:33:33,945
? o'er your being
must be revealing?

513
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:38,316
? all its sweetness...?

514
00:33:38,351 --> 00:33:43,955
Ah, you, uh...

515
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:45,823
you don't have
another daughter?

516
00:33:47,709 --> 00:33:50,211
That delightful
little thing

517
00:33:50,246 --> 00:33:52,714
is my one and only.

518
00:33:52,749 --> 00:33:55,216
Sings beautifully,
doesn't she?

519
00:33:55,251 --> 00:33:56,467
Oh, yes,
like a bird.

520
00:34:01,472 --> 00:34:05,226
A ruptured rooster.

521
00:34:15,853 --> 00:34:18,356
Well, you're right
on time, mr. Feathersmith.

522
00:34:18,391 --> 00:34:20,241
I always am.

523
00:34:20,276 --> 00:34:22,744
Hmm, i don't believe you
two gentlemen have met.

524
00:34:22,779 --> 00:34:23,995
This is mr. Deidrich.

525
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:27,115
And this is mr. Feathersmith,
mr. Deidrich.

526
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:32,120
I presume you brought
cash, mr. Feathersmith?

527
00:34:32,155 --> 00:34:34,005
1403 acres...

528
00:34:35,873 --> 00:34:39,010
here is $1,403.

529
00:34:39,045 --> 00:34:42,130
You, uh, you
seem to put

530
00:34:42,165 --> 00:34:45,883
all your eggs in one
basket, mr. Feathersmith.

531
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:48,386
I wouldn't
let that

532
00:34:48,421 --> 00:34:50,888
concern you,
mr. Deidrich.

533
00:34:50,923 --> 00:34:54,025
You see, i have
an exclusive contract

534
00:34:54,642 --> 00:34:56,527
with the hen.

535
00:35:05,286 --> 00:35:07,155
Beers all around.

536
00:35:09,657 --> 00:35:11,542
Well, gentlemen...

537
00:35:11,577 --> 00:35:14,662
shall we get down
to cases?

538
00:35:14,697 --> 00:35:17,165
When it comes to a fast shuffle

539
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,918
you're involved with
a very knowledgeable dealer.

540
00:35:20,953 --> 00:35:22,170
Comment, mr. Deidrich?

541
00:35:22,205 --> 00:35:25,306
Ah, you have the floor,
mr. Feathersmith.

542
00:35:25,341 --> 00:35:27,175
You seem anxious
to have it.

543
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:30,311
It's just a human frailty...

544
00:35:30,346 --> 00:35:33,431
i mean, to gloat just a bit
when one has just skinned

545
00:35:33,466 --> 00:35:35,933
a couple
of professional skinners.

546
00:35:35,968 --> 00:35:39,687
Which incidentally, is
what i've done to you.

547
00:35:39,722 --> 00:35:42,824
A buck an acre, and you're
sitting here thinking

548
00:35:42,859 --> 00:35:45,326
that whenthispigeon
flew into town

549
00:35:45,361 --> 00:35:47,195
you plucked him bald.

550
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:49,447
I sent a telegram
to a geologist.

551
00:35:49,482 --> 00:35:51,949
He arrived on the 4:00 train.

552
00:35:51,984 --> 00:35:55,086
He spent the day out
at the widow turner's land...

553
00:35:55,121 --> 00:35:57,588
made some preliminary
soil tests.

554
00:35:57,623 --> 00:35:59,457
Care to hear the results?

555
00:36:00,958 --> 00:36:02,844
Feel free,
mr. Feathersmith.

556
00:36:02,879 --> 00:36:07,849
I'll oblige,
mr. Deidrich.

557
00:36:07,884 --> 00:36:11,969
That crummy swampland you
sold me for a buck an acre

558
00:36:12,004 --> 00:36:14,472
is worth
half a million times that.

559
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:18,226
There's oil
on that land

560
00:36:18,261 --> 00:36:22,613
mr. Gibbons, mr. Deidrich-
oil, black gold.

561
00:36:22,648 --> 00:36:25,116
There's enough oil
in that land

562
00:36:25,151 --> 00:36:27,618
to produce 500 barrels of oil
a day

563
00:36:27,653 --> 00:36:30,121
for the next 1000 years.

564
00:36:30,156 --> 00:36:33,875
And you sold it to me
for a buck an acre!

565
00:36:35,493 --> 00:36:38,629
I swear, i could almost
feel sorry for you.

566
00:36:40,882 --> 00:36:44,001
Well, uh, maybe
you don't understand.

567
00:36:44,036 --> 00:36:46,504
We understand you,
mr. Feathersmith.

568
00:36:48,389 --> 00:36:50,258
I saidoil!

569
00:36:50,293 --> 00:36:52,143
Oil, yes, yes.

570
00:36:54,512 --> 00:36:59,517
Well, how's that for a small
shocker to end the day?

571
00:36:59,552 --> 00:37:03,905
Well, at the time,
it made us gulp a bit, too.

572
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:05,156
At the time?

573
00:37:05,191 --> 00:37:08,910
Four years ago, the first
geological tests were made

574
00:37:08,945 --> 00:37:11,412
and we were told about the oil.

575
00:37:11,447 --> 00:37:13,281
Four years ago!

576
00:37:13,316 --> 00:37:15,166
Indeed, there
were samples taken

577
00:37:15,783 --> 00:37:17,668
of the soil
at that time, too.

578
00:37:17,703 --> 00:37:18,920
There was never
any doubt

579
00:37:18,955 --> 00:37:21,422
that the land
had oil under it.

580
00:37:21,457 --> 00:37:23,925
6,000 feet under it,
mr. Feathersmith,

581
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:28,930
which means it might
just as well be on the moon.

582
00:37:28,965 --> 00:37:30,181
The moon?

583
00:37:30,216 --> 00:37:33,301
The oil can't be taken out
of the ground.

584
00:37:33,336 --> 00:37:36,437
It just can't
be taken out.

585
00:37:36,472 --> 00:37:39,557
What do you mean,
it can't be taken out?

586
00:37:39,592 --> 00:37:43,311
You could drill down five miles
if you needed to.

587
00:37:43,346 --> 00:37:45,196
Well, youcould perhaps,

588
00:37:45,231 --> 00:37:47,698
but nobody else
on earth could.

589
00:37:47,733 --> 00:37:51,452
And at that, you'd better
get up off that seat

590
00:37:51,487 --> 00:37:54,572
and inventing some new kind
of a drill.

591
00:37:57,708 --> 00:38:00,211
Of course, i...

592
00:38:00,828 --> 00:38:02,713
i forgot.

593
00:38:03,965 --> 00:38:07,084
It was 1937 when they...

594
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:08,719
when they...

595
00:38:08,754 --> 00:38:11,222
uh, problem,
mr. Feathersmith?

596
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:14,342
Not feeling
too well?

597
00:38:14,377 --> 00:38:17,478
Something, uh, a little
queasy, perhaps?

598
00:38:17,513 --> 00:38:21,849
Oh, it's something
i ate, i think.

599
00:38:21,884 --> 00:38:24,986
Something you ate,
no doubt

600
00:38:25,021 --> 00:38:29,991
like, uh, likecrow,
mr. Feathersmith?

601
00:38:55,383 --> 00:38:59,136
Mr. Cronk, this here
is mr., uh... mr., uh...

602
00:38:59,171 --> 00:39:01,022
feathersmith.

603
00:39:01,057 --> 00:39:02,890
Mr. Feathersmith

604
00:39:02,925 --> 00:39:04,775
says he'd like
to talk to us

605
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:08,529
about... i guess you'd
call it "inventions."

606
00:39:08,564 --> 00:39:11,032
What kind
of inventions?

607
00:39:11,649 --> 00:39:14,151
It's something that'll turn
this two-bit tool shed

608
00:39:14,186 --> 00:39:15,403
into a factory.

609
00:39:19,156 --> 00:39:22,293
A self-starter.

610
00:39:22,328 --> 00:39:23,911
You want
to enlarge

611
00:39:23,946 --> 00:39:27,048
on that,
mr. Feathersmith?

612
00:39:27,415 --> 00:39:29,917
What do you mean,
enlarge on it?

613
00:39:29,952 --> 00:39:32,420
It's a thing you press
with your foot

614
00:39:32,455 --> 00:39:35,923
that starts an engine
with an electric motor.

615
00:39:35,958 --> 00:39:38,426
Well, uh, what's
it used for?

616
00:39:38,461 --> 00:39:40,428
What's it used for?

617
00:39:40,463 --> 00:39:43,564
It's used to make
200 million bucks.

618
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:45,316
What goes into it?

619
00:39:45,566 --> 00:39:46,817
Are you all there?

620
00:39:46,852 --> 00:39:49,320
It's a storage
battery, a motor...

621
00:39:49,355 --> 00:39:51,822
it's a gillhookey
that starts the motor.

622
00:39:51,857 --> 00:39:53,074
I've given you
the principle

623
00:39:53,691 --> 00:39:55,576
all you have
to do is build it.

624
00:39:55,611 --> 00:39:58,696
Make me a set of blueprints
and specifications

625
00:39:58,731 --> 00:40:00,581
and i'll build it.

626
00:40:00,616 --> 00:40:03,084
Look, i am not
a crummy draftsman

627
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:05,586
or a two-bit
blueprint man.

628
00:40:05,621 --> 00:40:07,455
I'm a promoter,
a financier.

629
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:09,340
I'm going to give
you the backing

630
00:40:09,375 --> 00:40:11,208
i've given you
the principle

631
00:40:11,243 --> 00:40:13,711
all you have to
do is build it.

632
00:40:13,746 --> 00:40:16,847
Not without blueprints,
specifications.

633
00:40:16,882 --> 00:40:19,350
Now, what was
the other stuff?

634
00:40:19,385 --> 00:40:22,470
Other stuff...

635
00:40:22,505 --> 00:40:25,606
what isn't there?
There's everything.

636
00:40:25,641 --> 00:40:27,475
There's everything
under the sun.

637
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:30,611
And you rube sit around here
fixing tricycle pedals.

638
00:40:30,646 --> 00:40:33,114
There's radio.
There's television.

639
00:40:33,149 --> 00:40:35,616
Plastics...
ever here of aluminum?

640
00:40:35,651 --> 00:40:37,618
Aluminum airplanes?

641
00:40:37,653 --> 00:40:41,372
You foggy-headed carriage
builders,

642
00:40:41,407 --> 00:40:43,240
we could make ourselves
$8 billion!

643
00:40:43,624 --> 00:40:46,127
Sure.
Of course we could.

644
00:40:46,162 --> 00:40:48,629
Wait... there's nothing
standing in our way.

645
00:40:48,664 --> 00:40:51,132
All it takes is just
a little imagination.

646
00:40:51,167 --> 00:40:52,383
Just a little drive.

647
00:40:52,418 --> 00:40:54,251
Let's talk it over.

648
00:40:54,286 --> 00:40:57,388
Let's see what appeals to you.

649
00:40:57,423 --> 00:41:01,142
Uh, what appeals to me?

650
00:41:01,177 --> 00:41:03,010
Well, uh...

651
00:41:03,045 --> 00:41:06,764
how about a nice, handsome
perpetual motion machine.

652
00:41:26,667 --> 00:41:27,918
What's it used for?

653
00:41:27,953 --> 00:41:31,672
To make 200 million bucks,
that's what it's used for.

654
00:41:31,707 --> 00:41:33,040
Listen, are you all there?

655
00:41:33,674 --> 00:41:35,543
It's a storage battery,
a motor...

656
00:41:35,578 --> 00:41:37,428
it's a gillhookey
that starts the motor.

657
00:41:37,463 --> 00:41:39,296
I've given you the principle,

658
00:41:39,331 --> 00:41:41,298
all you have
to do is build it.

659
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:43,551
Now, look, i am not
a crummy draftsman

660
00:41:43,586 --> 00:41:46,053
or a two-bit blueprint man.

661
00:41:46,088 --> 00:41:47,938
I'm a promoter, a financier.

662
00:41:47,973 --> 00:41:50,441
I'm going to give you
the backing.

663
00:41:50,476 --> 00:41:51,692
I've already given
you the principle,

664
00:41:51,727 --> 00:41:53,561
now all you have to do
is build it.

665
00:41:54,195 --> 00:41:56,814
There's everything,
everything under the sun,

666
00:41:56,849 --> 00:41:59,950
and you rube, you sit around
here fixing tricycle pedals.

667
00:41:59,985 --> 00:42:03,070
There's radio,
there's television...

668
00:42:03,105 --> 00:42:05,823
plastics... ever hear
of aluminum?

669
00:42:05,858 --> 00:42:08,325
Aluminum airplanes...

670
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:11,462
you foggy-headed
carriage builders!

671
00:42:11,497 --> 00:42:14,582
We could make ourselves
$8 million.

672
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:20,838
Jesus, this place...

673
00:42:20,873 --> 00:42:24,592
the goals
of a 75-year-old man

674
00:42:24,627 --> 00:42:27,094
she, she didn't
change me inside...

675
00:42:27,129 --> 00:42:30,231
tha... that's why
i've been so tired...

676
00:42:30,266 --> 00:42:34,602
why, why i can't function,
why i, i can't operate.

677
00:42:34,637 --> 00:42:37,488
That's why
i can't make out...

678
00:42:37,523 --> 00:42:40,241
because inside, i'm already
the way i was...

679
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:05,132
well, mr. Feathersmith.

680
00:43:06,418 --> 00:43:11,889
Why, mr. Feathersmith, dear boy,
you look out of sorts...

681
00:43:11,924 --> 00:43:17,528
flagging, peaked, drooping,
and not at all well.

682
00:43:18,145 --> 00:43:20,030
You miserable, you...

683
00:43:22,568 --> 00:43:25,653
now, let's be fair
about this, mr. Feathersmith,

684
00:43:25,688 --> 00:43:29,406
and let's be reasoning
and rational and thoughtful.

685
00:43:29,441 --> 00:43:34,411
I'm a... 75-year-old man.

686
00:43:34,446 --> 00:43:36,297
Discerning of you.

687
00:43:36,332 --> 00:43:38,165
Nothing was mentioned,
mr. Feathersmith,

688
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,668
about changing
yourchronologicalage.

689
00:43:40,703 --> 00:43:43,170
You said you wanted
to look 30

690
00:43:43,205 --> 00:43:45,673
which is precisely
the way you look.

691
00:43:45,708 --> 00:43:48,809
We said nothing
about your insides...

692
00:43:48,844 --> 00:43:52,563
your heart, your veins,
your kidneys, your bladder...

693
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:55,065
just your appearance.

694
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:58,819
That was all that was touched
upon in the contract.

695
00:43:58,854 --> 00:44:03,190
But this place... this town...

696
00:44:03,225 --> 00:44:05,075
hmm, indeed.

697
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:08,195
You wanted it as it was.

698
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:11,332
That was a specific clause
in the contract.

699
00:44:11,367 --> 00:44:13,200
It's really not my fault

700
00:44:13,235 --> 00:44:15,703
your memory is so imperfect.

701
00:44:15,738 --> 00:44:19,456
As to the possibilities
of investments...

702
00:44:19,491 --> 00:44:23,844
well, you knew
that oil wasn't
reached until 1937.

703
00:44:23,879 --> 00:44:29,466
Your problem is that you leaped
before you looked.

704
00:44:29,501 --> 00:44:33,854
But, but everything else...

705
00:44:33,889 --> 00:44:36,974
everything else was wrong...

706
00:44:37,009 --> 00:44:40,110
the girl... the deals...

707
00:44:40,145 --> 00:44:43,864
inventions, stocks,
bonds, everything...

708
00:44:43,899 --> 00:44:46,367
it didn't work.

709
00:44:46,402 --> 00:44:50,738
It just... it just simply
didn't work.

710
00:44:50,773 --> 00:44:53,874
Of course it didn't.

711
00:44:53,909 --> 00:44:56,377
Of course, because you,
mr. Feathersmith,

712
00:44:56,412 --> 00:45:00,748
are a wheeler and a dealer,
a financier, a pusher...

713
00:45:00,783 --> 00:45:04,501
a brain, a manipulator...

714
00:45:04,536 --> 00:45:07,504
a raider.

715
00:45:07,539 --> 00:45:10,641
Because you are a taker,
instead of a builder.

716
00:45:10,676 --> 00:45:13,010
A conniver,
instead of a designer.

717
00:45:13,045 --> 00:45:14,895
A user...

718
00:45:14,930 --> 00:45:17,398
instead of a bringer.

719
00:45:21,769 --> 00:45:24,905
Well, mr. Feathersmith,

720
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:27,408
you are what is commonly
referred to

721
00:45:27,443 --> 00:45:30,527
as being behind
the old eight-ball.

722
00:45:30,562 --> 00:45:33,030
Look, look, i
don't want much.

723
00:45:34,281 --> 00:45:37,418
Send me back.

724
00:45:37,453 --> 00:45:40,537
Send me back to 1963,
back to where i was.

725
00:45:40,572 --> 00:45:44,925
1963? Is that what you want?

726
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,428
That's all i want,
i swear to you.

727
00:45:47,463 --> 00:45:49,296
That's all i want.

728
00:45:49,331 --> 00:45:51,181
You understand, of course

729
00:45:51,216 --> 00:45:53,684
that icansend you
back to 1963.

730
00:45:53,719 --> 00:45:56,186
But it will be a 1963

731
00:45:56,221 --> 00:45:59,940
predicated on what's occurred
in the past 24 hours.

732
00:45:59,975 --> 00:46:02,443
I don't care, i don't care.

733
00:46:02,478 --> 00:46:04,945
I think i might be able
to arrange

734
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:07,448
putting you back
in your own time.

735
00:46:07,483 --> 00:46:09,316
But, mind you,
mr. Feathersmith,

736
00:46:09,351 --> 00:46:11,819
this is nothing more nor less

737
00:46:11,854 --> 00:46:14,955
than a gesture of... sympathy.

738
00:46:14,990 --> 00:46:17,458
Ooh, hurts me
to mouth the word.

739
00:46:17,493 --> 00:46:23,080
But frankly, you are
such a totally abject...

740
00:46:23,115 --> 00:46:25,966
unhappy-looking creature,
that i can't find it

741
00:46:26,001 --> 00:46:29,086
in my, uh, wherever you
find the heart...

742
00:46:29,121 --> 00:46:30,971
to leave you here.

743
00:46:31,006 --> 00:46:34,725
There's a train out of here
at midnight, a special train.

744
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:38,345
Oh, bless you, miss devlin.

745
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:43,984
I'll never forget... i swear
to you, i'll never forget.

746
00:46:44,985 --> 00:46:49,990
There is a small surcharge,
mr. Feathersmith.

747
00:46:52,242 --> 00:46:54,111
A surcharge?

748
00:46:54,146 --> 00:46:56,113
$40.

749
00:46:56,997 --> 00:46:58,866
$40?

750
00:46:58,901 --> 00:47:02,002
Things
docost.

751
00:47:02,037 --> 00:47:03,871
I, i don't have $40.

752
00:47:03,906 --> 00:47:07,624
I don't,
i don't have five dollars.

753
00:47:07,659 --> 00:47:10,627
How about that?
This is your night.

754
00:47:10,662 --> 00:47:12,513
You have two negotiable items.

755
00:47:12,548 --> 00:47:15,015
All you need do
is liquidate them.

756
00:47:15,050 --> 00:47:20,020
But, but...
but who would buy them?

757
00:47:22,057 --> 00:47:24,525
That i wouldn't know...

758
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:26,393
mr. Feathersmith.

759
00:47:26,428 --> 00:47:27,394
But... you...

760
00:47:31,648 --> 00:47:34,535
what'll i do,
what'll i do?

761
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:36,403
You've got
about ten seconds.

762
00:47:36,438 --> 00:47:38,906
Find yourself
a customer.

763
00:47:38,941 --> 00:47:41,408
It's as simple
as that.

764
00:47:54,922 --> 00:47:56,173
Here, hecate!

765
00:47:56,208 --> 00:47:58,675
Hecate!

766
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:00,561
Here, it's
a bargain!

767
00:48:01,178 --> 00:48:03,063
Constant sunshine,
singing birds...

768
00:48:03,098 --> 00:48:04,314
14...
all aboard!

769
00:48:04,349 --> 00:48:05,566
1400 acres!

770
00:48:05,601 --> 00:48:08,685
Please, it's a bargain!

771
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,188
Hurry, it's yours
for 40 bucks!

772
00:48:17,444 --> 00:48:19,329
Yes, you
want something?

773
00:48:19,364 --> 00:48:23,083
Oh, i was going
to clean up, mr. Hecate.

774
00:48:23,118 --> 00:48:25,586
All right,
clean up.

775
00:48:28,088 --> 00:48:31,341
Hmm, marvelous old place.

776
00:48:33,844 --> 00:48:35,712
Really great old town.

777
00:48:37,598 --> 00:48:39,466
Uh, sir?

778
00:48:40,851 --> 00:48:42,719
Cliffordville.

779
00:48:42,754 --> 00:48:44,605
Cliffordville, indiana.

780
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:48,976
I grew up there,
got my start there.

781
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:52,863
Oh, that,
that's a coincidence, sir.

782
00:48:52,898 --> 00:48:55,365
I grew up there.

783
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:56,617
Name is feathersmith.

784
00:48:56,652 --> 00:48:58,368
Hmm.

785
00:48:58,403 --> 00:49:02,122
Well, how similar we are,
mr. Feathersmith.

786
00:49:02,739 --> 00:49:05,242
We both came from cliffordville.

787
00:49:05,277 --> 00:49:08,996
We both put on our pants
one leg at a time.

788
00:49:09,031 --> 00:49:12,749
And here we wind up
in the same building

789
00:49:12,784 --> 00:49:16,503
each with his own particular
function, huh?

790
00:49:17,137 --> 00:49:22,259
Oh, oh, yes, sir, each
with our particular function.

791
00:49:22,294 --> 00:49:27,898
Oh, they, they... they
gave me a, a watch.

792
00:49:29,766 --> 00:49:31,652
Four years ago.

793
00:49:31,687 --> 00:49:34,771
It was on the 40th anniversary
as custodian.

794
00:49:36,657 --> 00:49:41,028
Well, now, maybe
for the next 40 years

795
00:49:41,063 --> 00:49:45,415
if you really apply yourself,
mr. Feathersmith,

796
00:49:45,450 --> 00:49:48,535
i'll buy you a fob.

797
00:49:55,542 --> 00:50:00,547
Mr. William j. Feathersmith,
tycoon.

798
00:50:00,582 --> 00:50:01,798
Who tried the track
one more time

799
00:50:01,833 --> 00:50:03,684
and found it muddier
than he remembered.

800
00:50:03,719 --> 00:50:06,186
Proving with at least
a degree of conclusiveness

801
00:50:06,221 --> 00:50:09,306
that nice guys don't
always finish last.

802
00:50:09,341 --> 00:50:11,191
And some people should quit
when they're ahead.

803
00:50:11,226 --> 00:50:13,060
Tonight's tale
of iron men and irony

804
00:50:13,095 --> 00:50:18,648
delivered f.o.b.
From the twilight zone.

805
00:50:21,535 --> 00:50:24,037
On our next excursion
into the twilight zone

806
00:50:24,072 --> 00:50:25,906
we borrow an imposing array
of talent

807
00:50:25,941 --> 00:50:28,408
and call in the services
of a distinguished author

808
00:50:28,443 --> 00:50:29,659
named reginald rose,

809
00:50:29,694 --> 00:50:31,545
and some exceptionally fine
acting talent

810
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:34,664
in the persons of
mr. Pat hingle, miss nan martin

811
00:50:34,699 --> 00:50:35,916
and miss ruth white.

812
00:50:35,951 --> 00:50:37,417
They appear in a story called

813
00:50:37,452 --> 00:50:39,920
"the incredible world
of horace ford."

814
00:50:39,955 --> 00:50:41,805
And it's an incredible world
indeed.

815
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:44,925
Harvey bender?
Who's harvey bender?

816
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:45,675
What's the matter?

817
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:46,927
Just stop it.

818
00:50:48,929 --> 00:50:50,814
He was one of the kids
last night.

819
00:50:50,849 --> 00:50:52,682
What are you talking about?

820
00:50:52,717 --> 00:50:54,568
I saw him last night.

821
00:50:54,603 --> 00:50:57,070
Don't you know
that's impossible?

822
00:50:57,105 --> 00:50:58,939
I know what i see.

823
00:50:58,974 --> 00:51:03,326
He was ten years old
when you were ten years old.

824
00:51:03,361 --> 00:51:04,578
He's as old as you are.

825
00:51:04,613 --> 00:51:05,829
I tell you, i saw him.

826
00:51:05,864 --> 00:51:08,331
He's a grown up man.

827
00:51:08,366 --> 00:51:11,451
Oh, you think so?
You think so, do you?

828
00:51:12,085 --> 00:51:14,588
Let me tell you, i saw him last
night on randolph street.

829
00:51:14,623 --> 00:51:17,090
And i saw george lambert
and i saw cy wright.

830
00:51:17,125 --> 00:51:19,593
And they are still kids.
