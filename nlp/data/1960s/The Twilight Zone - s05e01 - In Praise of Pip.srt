00:00:06,973 --> 00:00:10,110
You unlock this door
with the key of imagination.

2
00:00:10,145 --> 00:00:11,978
Beyond it is
another dimension-

3
00:00:12,013 --> 00:00:13,863
a dimension of sound...

4
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,983
a dimension of sight...

5
00:00:17,018 --> 00:00:18,868
a dimension of mind.

6
00:00:18,903 --> 00:00:22,622
You're moving into a land
of both shadow and substance,

7
00:00:22,657 --> 00:00:23,873
of things and ideas.

8
00:00:23,908 --> 00:00:27,627
You've just crossed over
into the twilight zone.

9
00:00:42,008 --> 00:00:43,893
Is this the boy from huong hoa?

10
00:00:43,928 --> 00:00:45,145
That's right, sir.

11
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,647
We were caught
in ambush.

12
00:00:47,682 --> 00:00:49,766
"Multiple shrapnel, abdomen.

13
00:00:49,801 --> 00:00:52,268
Extensive tissue damage."

14
00:00:52,303 --> 00:00:54,521
Well, we can't
touch him here.

15
00:00:54,556 --> 00:00:57,023
We'll have to send
him on back.

16
00:00:57,058 --> 00:00:58,908
What are his chances, sir?

17
00:00:58,943 --> 00:01:00,777
Not very good,
i'm afraid.

18
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:04,030
"Phillips, pip."

19
00:01:04,065 --> 00:01:06,666
"Pip." that's an odd name.

20
00:01:08,785 --> 00:01:11,921
Well, private pip,
i wish you a long life.

21
00:01:13,423 --> 00:01:15,925
Or, short of that,
someone to mourn.

22
00:01:22,834 --> 00:01:24,684
No, please!

23
00:02:09,345 --> 00:02:13,099
Submitted for your approval,
one max phillips,

24
00:02:13,134 --> 00:02:15,602
a slightly the-worse-for-wear
maker of book

25
00:02:15,637 --> 00:02:18,738
whose life has been as drab
and undistinguished

26
00:02:18,773 --> 00:02:20,607
as a bundle of dirty clothes.

27
00:02:20,642 --> 00:02:23,109
And, though it's very late
in his day,

28
00:02:23,144 --> 00:02:24,994
he has an errant wish
that the rest of his life

29
00:02:25,029 --> 00:02:26,246
might be sent out to a laundry,

30
00:02:26,281 --> 00:02:28,748
to come back shiny and clean,

31
00:02:28,783 --> 00:02:32,502
this to be a gift of love
to a son named pip.

32
00:02:32,537 --> 00:02:35,004
Mr. Max phillips, homo sapiens,

33
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:39,375
who is soon to discover that man
is not as wise as he thinks-

34
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:42,512
said lesson to be learned
in the twilight zone.

35
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,050
Yeah.

36
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:10,306
Whew. It smells
like a brewery in here.

37
00:03:10,341 --> 00:03:11,558
Nice, huh?

38
00:03:11,593 --> 00:03:12,809
Nice, no.

39
00:03:12,844 --> 00:03:14,060
Typical, yes.

40
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:18,431
You got a visitor downstairs.

41
00:03:18,466 --> 00:03:19,682
Some kid.

42
00:03:19,717 --> 00:03:22,185
Did i ever tell you
i love you, mrs. Feeney?

43
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,687
Often and endlessly.

44
00:03:24,722 --> 00:03:26,573
Well, i do love you.

45
00:03:26,608 --> 00:03:28,825
You're the
queen of women.

46
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,076
Mailman come?

47
00:03:30,111 --> 00:03:31,945
Come and gone.

48
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:34,447
Anything for me?

49
00:03:34,482 --> 00:03:36,332
Nope.

50
00:03:36,367 --> 00:03:40,086
Nothing...
from the kid?

51
00:03:40,121 --> 00:03:42,589
No. Not this time.

52
00:03:42,624 --> 00:03:43,840
But don't worry about him.

53
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:46,342
He's all right.

54
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:50,713
You ain't going to do
yourself any good.

55
00:03:50,748 --> 00:03:51,965
You know that.

56
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,467
An astute observation,
mrs. Feeney.

57
00:03:54,502 --> 00:03:58,221
Oh, i love you and your
astute observations.

58
00:03:58,256 --> 00:03:59,472
I mean it.

59
00:03:59,507 --> 00:04:00,723
I really mean it.

60
00:04:00,758 --> 00:04:03,476
I know.

61
00:04:03,511 --> 00:04:05,979
How 'bout it,
mrs. Feeney?

62
00:04:06,014 --> 00:04:08,481
It's to laugh, isn't it?

63
00:04:08,516 --> 00:04:10,366
Isn't it to laugh?

64
00:04:27,168 --> 00:04:28,384
Yeah.

65
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:31,504
Hi, mr. Phillips.

66
00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:32,755
Come on in.

67
00:04:35,892 --> 00:04:37,760
Do you want
a cigarette?

68
00:04:37,795 --> 00:04:39,012
I got one.

69
00:04:39,047 --> 00:04:40,897
Got two?

70
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:43,399
Thank you.

71
00:04:45,902 --> 00:04:48,905
Uh... shady lane lost yesterday.

72
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,773
That's the way
of the world, georgy.

73
00:04:50,808 --> 00:04:53,910
The rich get richer
and the long shots lose.

74
00:04:53,945 --> 00:04:55,161
So what's to do?

75
00:04:55,196 --> 00:04:56,412
You said he had a good chance.

76
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:58,281
You told me he ran good
on a wet track.

77
00:04:58,316 --> 00:05:01,034
I said that?

78
00:05:01,069 --> 00:05:03,536
Proving how little
i know about horses, huh?

79
00:05:03,571 --> 00:05:04,921
What am i going to do?

80
00:05:04,956 --> 00:05:06,172
I bet every nickel i had on him.

81
00:05:06,207 --> 00:05:08,541
It's funny, george.

82
00:05:08,576 --> 00:05:10,426
Can't think of a thing.

83
00:05:10,461 --> 00:05:12,929
Oh. Big joke.

84
00:05:12,964 --> 00:05:14,797
Lots of laughs.

85
00:05:14,832 --> 00:05:16,549
Where'd you get the money?

86
00:05:16,584 --> 00:05:17,800
Where'd it come from?

87
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:20,303
I got it.

88
00:05:20,338 --> 00:05:21,554
From where?

89
00:05:21,589 --> 00:05:23,439
From... from
where i work.

90
00:05:23,474 --> 00:05:24,057
"Where you work."

91
00:05:24,092 --> 00:05:25,942
A white-collar heist, huh?

92
00:05:25,977 --> 00:05:27,193
I borrowed it.

93
00:05:27,228 --> 00:05:29,696
You borrowed it,
sure, you borrowed it.

94
00:05:29,731 --> 00:05:32,565
Without their knowing,
you borrowed it.

95
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,816
How right am i?

96
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:38,071
So what's to do, georgy?

97
00:05:38,454 --> 00:05:40,957
I'll go to jail.

98
00:05:40,992 --> 00:05:43,076
I'll make book on that.

99
00:05:43,111 --> 00:05:46,212
Poor georgy porgy,
one of the breed-

100
00:05:46,247 --> 00:05:48,081
johnny-come-lately wisdom

101
00:05:48,116 --> 00:05:51,217
grafted
onto a second-guesser head.

102
00:05:51,252 --> 00:05:53,836
So i ask again,
georgy,

103
00:05:53,871 --> 00:05:55,722
what's to do?

104
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:07,600
Max phillips is outside.

105
00:06:11,354 --> 00:06:13,856
I haven't seen
you in five days.

106
00:06:13,891 --> 00:06:15,108
Seems like years.

107
00:06:15,143 --> 00:06:16,359
Where's everybody?

108
00:06:16,394 --> 00:06:16,993
Everybody's gone.

109
00:06:17,028 --> 00:06:18,861
We settled
accounts tonight.

110
00:06:18,896 --> 00:06:20,113
Where were you?

111
00:06:20,148 --> 00:06:21,364
A reasonable question.

112
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:23,249
I took the wrong bus?

113
00:06:23,284 --> 00:06:25,118
You give me the
wrong story now,

114
00:06:25,153 --> 00:06:27,620
you'll wind up
under the wheels.

115
00:06:27,655 --> 00:06:30,757
1,341 bucks. Hey!
Things are looking up.

116
00:06:30,792 --> 00:06:33,259
It depends on where
you're doing the looking.

117
00:06:33,294 --> 00:06:35,762
From where i sit,
i don't like the view.

118
00:06:35,797 --> 00:06:37,013
I don't
understand you, maxie.

119
00:06:37,048 --> 00:06:38,881
I treat you like
a favorite uncle,

120
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:40,767
and you double-cross me.

121
00:06:40,802 --> 00:06:42,635
Egad, caught.

122
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,520
Kid by the name
of george reynold

123
00:06:44,555 --> 00:06:45,772
placed a bet with you-

124
00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:48,274
$300, and the horse
doesn't place

125
00:06:48,309 --> 00:06:50,143
and yet, the dough
never got to me.

126
00:06:50,178 --> 00:06:51,394
Why, maxie?

127
00:06:51,429 --> 00:06:53,279
I'll bite. Why?

128
00:06:53,314 --> 00:06:55,148
Because you gave it
back, that's why.

129
00:06:55,183 --> 00:06:56,399
You welshed on me.

130
00:06:56,434 --> 00:06:58,284
And i had to go out
and find the kid

131
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,535
and get my dough back.

132
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:02,038
I had to rough him
up a little bit

133
00:07:02,073 --> 00:07:03,289
'cause he was stubborn.

134
00:07:03,324 --> 00:07:05,158
That was a lot
of trouble.

135
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:09,162
For 300 lousy bucks.

136
00:07:09,197 --> 00:07:12,298
Yeah, an awful
lot of trouble.

137
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:14,167
But you know
how it would be, maxie,

138
00:07:14,202 --> 00:07:16,052
if i let this one pass.

139
00:07:16,087 --> 00:07:18,554
It would be the first
of a long line.

140
00:07:18,589 --> 00:07:21,674
Inside of three months,
i wouldn't have a shirt.

141
00:07:21,709 --> 00:07:23,559
Kid must have
been persuasive.

142
00:07:23,594 --> 00:07:24,811
Ask the kid.

143
00:07:24,846 --> 00:07:26,179
He's been asked.
Look at his face.

144
00:07:26,214 --> 00:07:28,064
If i don't get
that dough back,

145
00:07:28,099 --> 00:07:29,315
i'm going to go to jail.

146
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,566
Don't you understand,
mr. Moran?

147
00:07:30,601 --> 00:07:31,818
I'm going to go to jail.

148
00:07:32,435 --> 00:07:33,686
You're tearing me
to pieces, kid.

149
00:07:33,721 --> 00:07:34,937
Right in here.

150
00:07:34,972 --> 00:07:36,823
You know what's the
matter with you, fella?

151
00:07:36,858 --> 00:07:38,691
You listen to guys
like max phillips.

152
00:07:38,726 --> 00:07:39,325
That was mistake one.

153
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,828
Max phillips never gave
anything away in his life.

154
00:07:41,863 --> 00:07:43,079
How right am i, maxie?

155
00:07:43,114 --> 00:07:44,831
Very right.

156
00:07:44,866 --> 00:07:47,333
A heel
with a robin hood complex,

157
00:07:47,368 --> 00:07:50,453
but thin and short-lived,
georgy porgy.

158
00:07:50,488 --> 00:07:52,338
Remember that the next time

159
00:07:52,373 --> 00:07:56,092
somebody tries to hand you
something for nothing.

160
00:07:56,127 --> 00:07:57,960
Consider the source.

161
00:08:01,132 --> 00:08:02,348
Yeah.

162
00:08:02,383 --> 00:08:03,599
Who?

163
00:08:03,634 --> 00:08:05,468
He's busy now.

164
00:08:05,503 --> 00:08:06,719
All right, all right.

165
00:08:06,754 --> 00:08:07,970
It's your landlady.

166
00:08:08,005 --> 00:08:09,856
Says there's
a telegram for you.

167
00:08:09,891 --> 00:08:12,358
Yeah, mrs. Feeney.

168
00:08:12,393 --> 00:08:15,478
Open it up.

169
00:08:15,513 --> 00:08:17,363
Department of the army?

170
00:08:17,398 --> 00:08:19,365
Well, read it to me.

171
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,239
No.

172
00:08:28,124 --> 00:08:29,375
No...

173
00:08:33,129 --> 00:08:36,249
no, i'm all right, mrs. Feeney.

174
00:08:36,284 --> 00:08:38,134
Thank you.

175
00:08:40,002 --> 00:08:40,636
Thank you.

176
00:09:05,161 --> 00:09:07,029
Pip is dying.

177
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:12,034
My kid is dying in a...

178
00:09:12,069 --> 00:09:15,788
in a place called south vietnam.

179
00:09:15,823 --> 00:09:19,542
There isn't even supposed
to be a war going on there,

180
00:09:19,577 --> 00:09:22,044
but my son is dying.

181
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,432
It's to laugh.

182
00:09:26,467 --> 00:09:30,186
I swear, it's to laugh.

183
00:09:30,221 --> 00:09:33,689
Hey, max, oh, hey,
kid, i'm sorry.

184
00:09:33,724 --> 00:09:36,192
My kid used to love
amusement parks.

185
00:09:36,227 --> 00:09:39,946
I used to take him
on saturday night.

186
00:09:39,981 --> 00:09:42,448
It ain't like the kid's
dead already.

187
00:09:42,483 --> 00:09:43,699
What i mean is...

188
00:09:43,734 --> 00:09:46,202
when i wasn't too drunk,

189
00:09:46,237 --> 00:09:48,070
or when i wasn't
out conning for you,

190
00:09:48,105 --> 00:09:52,458
i used to take him
to the amusement park.

191
00:09:53,709 --> 00:09:57,463
You know something, moran,
i think you're wrong.

192
00:09:57,498 --> 00:10:01,467
I think i've given
something away.

193
00:10:01,502 --> 00:10:04,587
My kid, pip.

194
00:10:04,622 --> 00:10:05,838
The good part of me.

195
00:10:05,873 --> 00:10:07,723
The clean part.

196
00:10:07,758 --> 00:10:10,843
The part i
was proud of.

197
00:10:10,878 --> 00:10:12,728
Georgy, you
put this back

198
00:10:12,763 --> 00:10:13,346
where it
came from.

199
00:10:13,381 --> 00:10:16,482
Now, maxie, i'm sorry
about your kid, but...

200
00:10:16,517 --> 00:10:17,483
no more! No more!

201
00:10:17,518 --> 00:10:20,603
20 years ago, i should have
spit right in your eye.

202
00:10:20,638 --> 00:10:21,854
20 years ago,
i should have known

203
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:24,357
how little time a man
has to raise his son.

204
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:26,859
A little belated
honor now, george.

205
00:10:26,894 --> 00:10:28,110
You get out of here.

206
00:10:28,145 --> 00:10:29,996
Walk as fast
as you can.

207
00:10:30,031 --> 00:10:31,247
Don't look
behind you.

208
00:10:33,115 --> 00:10:36,252
Moran, if your boy is
reaching for a cigarette,

209
00:10:36,287 --> 00:10:38,120
tell him the smoke
bothers me.

210
00:10:38,155 --> 00:10:39,372
If he's reaching
for anything else,

211
00:10:39,407 --> 00:10:40,623
tell him i'll cut
his heart out

212
00:10:40,658 --> 00:10:41,874
before he halfway
reaches it,

213
00:10:41,909 --> 00:10:43,125
then i'll go
to work on you.

214
00:10:49,765 --> 00:10:51,634
Get out. Get out of here!

215
00:10:51,669 --> 00:10:52,768
Move!

216
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:28,421
I was going to change.

217
00:11:30,306 --> 00:11:32,174
That's a fact, pip.

218
00:11:32,209 --> 00:11:35,311
I was...
i was going to change.

219
00:11:35,346 --> 00:11:39,315
I was... i was going to meet you
when you got off the boat.

220
00:11:41,817 --> 00:11:44,320
So now there's no more bets,

221
00:11:44,355 --> 00:11:46,822
and there's no more bottles...

222
00:11:48,691 --> 00:11:53,696
...but, oh...

223
00:11:53,731 --> 00:11:56,832
there's no more pip either.

224
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:05,341
Oh, god,

225
00:12:05,376 --> 00:12:07,843
if i...

226
00:12:07,878 --> 00:12:12,214
if i could just talk to him,
you see?

227
00:12:12,249 --> 00:12:15,351
If i could just see him...

228
00:12:17,219 --> 00:12:20,356
if i could just tell him...

229
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,615
all right, my friends,
that'll do it.

230
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:31,484
Let's see if he'll survive
for an hour.

231
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,871
If he can hang on for that long,
i think he'll hang on for good.

232
00:12:35,906 --> 00:12:37,740
Well, good luck to you...

233
00:12:37,775 --> 00:12:40,876
what was his name? Pip?

234
00:12:40,911 --> 00:12:45,247
Good luck to you, pip.

235
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:42,271
Pip?

236
00:13:42,306 --> 00:13:44,139
Pip.

237
00:13:47,643 --> 00:13:49,528
Hey, pip.

238
00:13:49,563 --> 00:13:53,282
Hey, pop,
i've been waiting.

239
00:13:53,317 --> 00:13:54,783
Hey, pip!

240
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:06,295
Hey, pip.

241
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:09,415
Pip, my boy.

242
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:11,917
Pop, i've been waiting
for so long.

243
00:14:11,952 --> 00:14:15,054
Hey, pip.

244
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:21,927
Oh, pip, hey!

245
00:14:21,962 --> 00:14:23,178
Pip.

246
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,565
You're ten years
old again, pip.

247
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,434
How come you're
ten years old again?

248
00:14:28,469 --> 00:14:30,319
That's what i am, pop.

249
00:14:30,354 --> 00:14:32,821
I'm ten years old,
and it's saturday night.

250
00:14:32,856 --> 00:14:34,690
You said to meet you
on the midway,

251
00:14:34,725 --> 00:14:36,575
and i've been waiting.

252
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:39,078
I was afraid
you weren't going to come.

253
00:14:39,113 --> 00:14:40,329
But i don't understand.

254
00:14:40,364 --> 00:14:41,580
I really don't understand.

255
00:14:41,615 --> 00:14:43,449
Sometimes you don't
show up, pop.

256
00:14:43,484 --> 00:14:45,951
Sometimes when you're sick
or something.

257
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:49,088
You remember what
i used to say, pip.

258
00:14:49,123 --> 00:14:50,956
You remember?
I remember.

259
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:52,841
I used to say

260
00:14:52,876 --> 00:14:55,344
hey, pip, who's
your best buddy?

261
00:14:55,379 --> 00:14:57,846
Hey, pop,
you're my best buddy.

262
00:15:05,971 --> 00:15:07,856
Oh!

263
00:15:07,891 --> 00:15:09,725
What do you want to do?

264
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,728
How about some rides, pop,
or some cotton candy?

265
00:15:12,763 --> 00:15:13,979
Sure. Some rides

266
00:15:14,014 --> 00:15:15,731
and some cotton candy.

267
00:15:15,766 --> 00:15:16,982
Anything you want.
Anything at all.

268
00:15:17,017 --> 00:15:19,485
But, pip, you're
ten years old again.

269
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:21,370
I don't understand that.

270
00:15:21,405 --> 00:15:23,872
It doesn't make
any difference now.

271
00:15:23,907 --> 00:15:24,623
We're here, and
we're together,

272
00:15:24,658 --> 00:15:26,492
and we can go
on some rides.

273
00:15:26,527 --> 00:15:28,377
Sure we can.

274
00:15:28,412 --> 00:15:30,245
Sure we can, pip.

275
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,008
Let's go.

276
00:15:52,267 --> 00:15:53,519
Hey.

277
00:15:53,554 --> 00:15:56,021
Come on, pop.

278
00:16:02,911 --> 00:16:04,163
Whoa!

279
00:16:04,198 --> 00:16:05,414
Pop, help, help.

280
00:16:05,449 --> 00:16:06,031
Ah.

281
00:16:13,422 --> 00:16:14,673
How about this?

282
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:16,542
Ooh, neat.

283
00:16:19,713 --> 00:16:20,929
Come on, dad.

284
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:35,310
Work the gun,
not the jaws.

285
00:16:41,602 --> 00:16:42,317
You hit a duck.

286
00:16:42,352 --> 00:16:43,569
Pip, you hit a duck.

287
00:16:43,604 --> 00:16:46,071
You hit it.

288
00:16:46,106 --> 00:16:47,322
Pip.

289
00:16:47,357 --> 00:16:49,208
Who's your best buddy, pip?

290
00:16:49,243 --> 00:16:51,710
You, pop.
You're my best buddy.

291
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:01,086
What's the matter, pip?

292
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:05,474
What happened?

293
00:17:07,976 --> 00:17:09,228
Pip, what's the matter?

294
00:17:09,263 --> 00:17:11,096
Pip, listen to me.

295
00:17:12,981 --> 00:17:14,850
Pip.

296
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:18,604
Pip!

297
00:17:34,002 --> 00:17:35,504
Pip.

298
00:17:40,509 --> 00:17:44,012
Pip.

299
00:17:48,383 --> 00:17:49,635
Pip.

300
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:56,775
Pip. Pip.

301
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:58,026
Pip.

302
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,402
You have to understand this.

303
00:18:08,036 --> 00:18:11,156
You have to try and listen
and understand.

304
00:18:11,191 --> 00:18:13,158
Those times
when i wasn't around,

305
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:15,043
when i was out conning

306
00:18:15,078 --> 00:18:16,912
and being a shill,
or when i was too drunk,

307
00:18:17,546 --> 00:18:20,048
and when i'd drag you from
one rooming house to another...

308
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:22,417
it doesn't make
any difference now, pop.

309
00:18:22,452 --> 00:18:24,670
It makes a difference, pip.

310
00:18:24,705 --> 00:18:26,555
It does make a difference

311
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:29,675
because i want you to know
that no man...

312
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:31,560
oh, listen to me, son.

313
00:18:31,595 --> 00:18:35,314
No man ever, everloved a boy
any more than i love you.

314
00:18:35,349 --> 00:18:36,565
It was because...

315
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,685
well, because i dreamed
instead of did.

316
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,821
I wished and hoped
instead of tried.

317
00:18:42,856 --> 00:18:47,826
But as god is my witness, pip,
i loved you.

318
00:18:47,861 --> 00:18:51,947
See, i wouldn't be able
to put it into words

319
00:18:51,982 --> 00:18:54,082
'cause there isn't any language,
but...

320
00:18:54,117 --> 00:18:55,951
but i love you.

321
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:00,088
Pip.

322
00:19:00,123 --> 00:19:03,208
You can't leave me now.

323
00:19:03,243 --> 00:19:05,093
You can't go away from me now.

324
00:19:05,128 --> 00:19:06,962
Pip.

325
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:10,966
Pip.

326
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:14,219
Pip. Pip.

327
00:19:14,254 --> 00:19:16,355
Pip!

328
00:19:16,972 --> 00:19:19,474
Pip. Pip.

329
00:19:19,509 --> 00:19:21,360
Pip?

330
00:19:21,395 --> 00:19:23,862
The hour's up now, pop.

331
00:19:23,897 --> 00:19:25,113
I have to go.

332
00:19:25,148 --> 00:19:26,982
I don't belong here.

333
00:19:27,017 --> 00:19:31,620
You see, pop, the hour's up,
and i'm dying.

334
00:19:31,655 --> 00:19:35,624
You... you're just a kid.

335
00:19:35,659 --> 00:19:38,744
You're just a little boy, pip.

336
00:19:38,779 --> 00:19:40,629
You can't die.

337
00:19:41,129 --> 00:19:44,249
I want to spend the rest
of my life being with you

338
00:19:44,284 --> 00:19:46,134
and doing things for you
and giving you things.

339
00:19:46,169 --> 00:19:48,003
That's all that life
means to me anymore.

340
00:19:48,038 --> 00:19:49,888
That's the only thing
that's important.

341
00:19:50,505 --> 00:19:53,642
And, pip, i promise you
that they'll be no more bottles,

342
00:19:53,677 --> 00:19:55,510
and no more con job, nothing,

343
00:19:55,545 --> 00:19:58,013
and no more having to wait
for me.

344
00:19:58,048 --> 00:19:59,147
Pip.

345
00:19:59,182 --> 00:20:00,399
Pip!

346
00:20:11,026 --> 00:20:13,161
I'm dying, pop.

347
00:20:13,196 --> 00:20:16,415
I'm sorry,
but i have to go back.

348
00:20:16,665 --> 00:20:17,916
Why, pip?

349
00:20:19,167 --> 00:20:20,419
Why?

350
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:08,834
Hey, god?

351
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:13,221
Hey, god...

352
00:21:15,724 --> 00:21:18,226
i'll make a deal with you.

353
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:24,483
I give you...

354
00:21:24,518 --> 00:21:34,493
i give you the sodden carcass
of an aging, weak idiot.

355
00:21:34,528 --> 00:21:36,361
I give you me.

356
00:21:38,246 --> 00:21:41,366
All you have to give back
is pip.

357
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:50,759
Please, god, don't take my boy.

358
00:21:52,627 --> 00:21:54,513
Please.

359
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:59,518
Take me.

360
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,889
Take me.

361
00:22:42,677 --> 00:22:43,929
You all right, pip?

362
00:22:43,964 --> 00:22:45,814
Oh, sure.
I'm fine.

363
00:22:45,849 --> 00:22:47,065
It's this leprechaun
grandkid of mine.

364
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,316
She wants to go on
the ferris wheel.

365
00:22:48,351 --> 00:22:50,185
You want to
come with us?

366
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,186
Ah, no, thanks.

367
00:22:51,221 --> 00:22:52,437
I'll just sorta walk around.

368
00:22:52,472 --> 00:22:55,574
You know, this place reminds me
of your father,

369
00:22:55,609 --> 00:22:56,825
god rest his soul.

370
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:59,945
He used to talk about taking you
here all the time.

371
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:02,447
Yeah, we sure had
some good times.

372
00:23:02,482 --> 00:23:04,950
Oh, we had some wonderful times.

373
00:23:04,985 --> 00:23:06,451
Look, we'll meet you
over by the ferris wheel

374
00:23:06,486 --> 00:23:07,702
when we get off, huh?

375
00:23:07,737 --> 00:23:08,954
Okay.
Have a good time.

376
00:23:08,989 --> 00:23:11,456
Yeah. You watch
out, huh, pip?

377
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:44,372
Work the gun, not the jaws.

378
00:23:44,407 --> 00:23:48,743
That's what my pop used to say.

379
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:53,131
Hey, pop, you're my best buddy.

380
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:55,634
You always were.

381
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:03,141
Very little comment here

382
00:24:03,176 --> 00:24:05,644
save for this small aside.

383
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:09,397
That the ties of flesh
are deep and strong.

384
00:24:09,432 --> 00:24:11,266
That the capacity to love

385
00:24:11,301 --> 00:24:14,402
is a vital, rich
and all-consuming function

386
00:24:14,437 --> 00:24:16,271
of the human animal

387
00:24:16,306 --> 00:24:19,407
and that you can find nobility
and sacrifice and love

388
00:24:19,442 --> 00:24:21,910
wherever you may seek it out-

389
00:24:21,945 --> 00:24:26,281
down the block, in the heart
or in the twilight zone.

390
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:33,538
And now, mr. Serling.

391
00:24:33,573 --> 00:24:34,789
Next ontwilight zone,

392
00:24:34,824 --> 00:24:37,926
we dabble in the manly arts
with a show called "steel."

393
00:24:37,961 --> 00:24:39,794
Written especially for us
by richard matheson,

394
00:24:40,428 --> 00:24:42,931
this one isn't just
for prizefighting buffs

395
00:24:42,966 --> 00:24:45,433
because the story
is above and beyond

396
00:24:45,468 --> 00:24:47,302
anything remotely involving
the marquis of queensberry.

397
00:24:47,337 --> 00:24:49,804
Rather, it's a tender, touching
and touch analysis

398
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:51,056
of some very bizarre people.

399
00:24:51,091 --> 00:24:54,192
Lee marvin and joe mantell
take a walk in the twilight zone

400
00:24:54,227 --> 00:24:56,695
next in "steel."
