1
00:00:10,193 --> 00:00:12,696
You're traveling
through another dimension-

2
00:00:12,731 --> 00:00:15,832
a dimension not only of sight
and sound, but of mind.

3
00:00:15,867 --> 00:00:18,334
A journey into a wondrous land
of imagination.

4
00:00:18,369 --> 00:00:20,837
Next stop, the twilight zone.

5
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:02,879
Edna.

6
00:01:02,914 --> 00:01:04,130
Huh?

7
00:01:04,165 --> 00:01:06,633
What about gas and electric?

8
00:01:06,668 --> 00:01:07,884
What?

9
00:01:07,919 --> 00:01:09,135
The gas and
electric bill.

10
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:11,004
How many months is that?

11
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:12,505
Four months.

12
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,390
That's one you better pay.

13
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:20,146
Huh. That's one i can't pay.

14
00:01:20,181 --> 00:01:22,398
Oh, i wish...

15
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:43,419
how are you,
mrs. Gumley?

16
00:01:43,454 --> 00:01:45,538
Oh, just fine, mr. Castle.

17
00:01:45,573 --> 00:01:46,790
How have you been?

18
00:01:47,423 --> 00:01:48,792
Oh, can't complain.

19
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:56,299
Been having a lot of rain,
haven't we?

20
00:01:56,334 --> 00:01:58,802
Quite a bit of rain
for this time of the year.

21
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:03,306
Really.

22
00:02:06,442 --> 00:02:08,311
It's good
for the flowers.

23
00:02:08,346 --> 00:02:10,313
How's that?

24
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:17,453
An heirloom today,
mr. Castle.

25
00:02:17,488 --> 00:02:20,957
An heirloom, mrs. Gumley?

26
00:02:20,992 --> 00:02:22,826
Oh, yes,
mr. Castle.

27
00:02:22,861 --> 00:02:25,962
Been in my family
for years and years.

28
00:02:25,997 --> 00:02:28,464
It's supposed to
be very valuable.

29
00:02:28,499 --> 00:02:30,967
Hand-blown glass
is what it is.

30
00:02:31,002 --> 00:02:31,584
Really?

31
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:33,469
Uh-huh.

32
00:02:33,504 --> 00:02:36,589
Mrs. Gumley, it's just
a plain old wine bottle.

33
00:02:36,624 --> 00:02:38,474
Do you know
what it's worth?

34
00:02:38,509 --> 00:02:39,342
Nothing.

35
00:02:39,976 --> 00:02:41,344
If you could find
the store where it came from,

36
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:43,847
that's what they would
give you for it, mrs. Gumley-

37
00:02:43,882 --> 00:02:46,232
nothing.

38
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:56,242
I... i could let it go
for a dollar.

39
00:02:58,494 --> 00:03:00,997
Mrs. Gumley,
if i could spare a dollar,

40
00:03:01,032 --> 00:03:03,499
i'd give it to you,
believe me i would, but...

41
00:03:03,534 --> 00:03:05,368
well, things have
been rough here.

42
00:03:05,403 --> 00:03:06,619
I'm so in debt myself...

43
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:28,641
i wish i could make
it more, i really do.

44
00:03:28,676 --> 00:03:30,526
Thank you, mr. Castle.

45
00:03:30,561 --> 00:03:32,395
You're
a wonderful man.

46
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,280
God bless you.

47
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:39,903
Mr. Castle...

48
00:03:39,938 --> 00:03:42,906
it's not an
heirloom, you know.

49
00:03:42,941 --> 00:03:45,909
I found it in an ash can.

50
00:03:45,944 --> 00:03:48,294
Please,
mr. Castle,

51
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:50,163
forgive me
for lying.

52
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:53,917
Aw, that's all right,
mrs. Gumley.

53
00:03:53,952 --> 00:03:58,304
Who knows? Maybe it'll turn out
tobean heirloom.

54
00:03:58,339 --> 00:04:00,056
Yeah.

55
00:04:01,557 --> 00:04:03,927
Thank you.

56
00:04:26,082 --> 00:04:27,951
Gorgeous.

57
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,093
She has to eat,
doesn't she?

58
00:04:37,128 --> 00:04:38,344
You don't?

59
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:40,096
Arthur...

60
00:04:40,131 --> 00:04:42,215
we're just
around the corner

61
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,466
from bankruptcy.

62
00:04:43,501 --> 00:04:45,852
You promised me,
no more handouts.

63
00:04:45,887 --> 00:04:48,354
Look, edna,
maybe all i've got left

64
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:53,359
is to try to find some poor clod
whoicould feel sorry for.

65
00:04:53,394 --> 00:04:54,978
Maybe a man
can be a failure

66
00:04:55,013 --> 00:04:56,229
for only so long,

67
00:04:56,264 --> 00:04:57,864
and then... and then...

68
00:04:57,899 --> 00:05:00,366
and then it catches up
with him.

69
00:05:02,118 --> 00:05:03,369
Look at it, edna!

70
00:05:03,404 --> 00:05:04,620
Look at it!

71
00:05:04,655 --> 00:05:06,489
The legacy
of a hundred years.

72
00:05:06,524 --> 00:05:09,625
My grandfather owned it,
and it broke his heart.

73
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,128
And then, my father-
it killed him, too.

74
00:05:12,163 --> 00:05:13,997
Look at it. Look at it.

75
00:05:14,032 --> 00:05:16,499
The meanness of it,
the shabbiness of it,

76
00:05:16,534 --> 00:05:17,750
the hand-to-mouth of it!

77
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:20,253
It isn't just an antique shop

78
00:05:20,288 --> 00:05:22,138
where you pick up
the pitiful remnants

79
00:05:22,173 --> 00:05:24,007
of other people's failures.

80
00:05:24,042 --> 00:05:27,143
It's a shrine to failure itself,
that's what it is!

81
00:05:27,178 --> 00:05:30,897
It's a mausoleum,
a burial ground for...

82
00:05:30,932 --> 00:05:32,765
for people's hopes.

83
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:37,153
Edna, what happens
to us anyway?

84
00:05:37,188 --> 00:05:38,404
What happens to us?

85
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:39,405
We're not old people,

86
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,908
and yet this place
is making us old.

87
00:05:41,943 --> 00:05:43,776
There must be years ahead of us

88
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:46,162
that come without
scrimping and counting,

89
00:05:46,197 --> 00:05:48,031
and picking over
checkbooks and budgets

90
00:05:48,066 --> 00:05:49,916
and final notices
and old bills.

91
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:58,925
Hey...

92
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,793
hey!

93
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:07,300
Mr. And mrs. Arthur castle-

94
00:06:07,335 --> 00:06:10,436
gentle and
infinitely patient people

95
00:06:10,471 --> 00:06:12,939
whose lives have been
a hope chest

96
00:06:12,974 --> 00:06:16,059
with a rusty lock
and a lost set of keys.

97
00:06:16,692 --> 00:06:19,195
But, in just a moment,
that hope chest will be opened,

98
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:22,315
and an improbable phantom
will try to bedeck the drabness

99
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:24,817
of these two people's
failure-laden lives

100
00:06:24,852 --> 00:06:27,954
with the gold and
precious stones of fulfillment.

101
00:06:27,989 --> 00:06:30,456
Mr. And mrs. Arthur castle,
standing on the outskirts,

102
00:06:31,074 --> 00:06:34,210
and about to enter,
the twilight zone.

103
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:56,232
How do you do?

104
00:06:57,733 --> 00:07:02,105
Rather than go into any lengthy
generic explanation

105
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:06,492
of my existence, suffice it
to say that i am a genie.

106
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:09,612
That's quite correct.

107
00:07:09,647 --> 00:07:11,364
A genie.

108
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:15,118
I can offer you four wishes
with a guaranteed performance.

109
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:18,871
Well, mr. Castle?

110
00:07:18,906 --> 00:07:22,258
Mrs. Castle?

111
00:07:22,293 --> 00:07:24,127
What have you in mind?

112
00:07:24,162 --> 00:07:27,513
Arthur, what's
happening to us?

113
00:07:30,633 --> 00:07:33,136
He's a hypnotist
or something.

114
00:07:33,171 --> 00:07:35,021
Nothing of the sort.

115
00:07:35,056 --> 00:07:38,141
I grant four wishes
to the owner,

116
00:07:38,176 --> 00:07:40,276
then go back
inside the bottle

117
00:07:40,311 --> 00:07:43,396
for a century and a year
until a summons comes

118
00:07:43,431 --> 00:07:45,148
from the next owner.

119
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:56,409
Now, i think the business at
hand is for you and mrs. Castle

120
00:07:56,444 --> 00:07:59,545
to decide upon the nature
of your four wishes,

121
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,414
keeping in mind,
of course...

122
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:03,299
edna.

123
00:08:03,334 --> 00:08:05,418
...that each wish
is irrevocable.

124
00:08:05,453 --> 00:08:07,303
Once made, it is fulfilled.

125
00:08:07,338 --> 00:08:10,423
And, once fulfilled,
it is a matter of record.

126
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:12,925
It can only be altered
by yet another wish.

127
00:08:16,312 --> 00:08:18,181
Clear, mr. Castle?

128
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:22,068
I think we'd better
call the police.

129
00:08:22,103 --> 00:08:23,319
Wish
for them.

130
00:08:23,354 --> 00:08:26,439
I can bring you scotland yard,

131
00:08:26,474 --> 00:08:29,575
the federal bureau
of investigation,

132
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:32,195
or every bobby in
the city of london.

133
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:34,080
Is it the police
you want?

134
00:08:34,115 --> 00:08:35,331
No.

135
00:08:35,366 --> 00:08:38,451
That is not what
we would wish for.

136
00:08:38,486 --> 00:08:41,587
Arthur, you out
of your mind?

137
00:08:41,622 --> 00:08:43,456
You believe him?

138
00:08:43,491 --> 00:08:45,341
Please go on,
mr. Castle.

139
00:08:45,376 --> 00:08:46,592
You were saying?

140
00:08:46,627 --> 00:08:52,215
Well, if i had a wish,

141
00:08:52,848 --> 00:08:54,717
just for the sake
of argument,

142
00:08:54,752 --> 00:08:57,220
i'd say i wanted
that broken glass

143
00:08:57,255 --> 00:08:59,105
in that case to be fixed.

144
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:07,863
Would you like to make
it official, mr. Castle?

145
00:09:12,368 --> 00:09:13,619
Well, mr. Castle,

146
00:09:13,654 --> 00:09:15,488
is that your wish?

147
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:19,492
Yes, that is my wish.

148
00:09:19,527 --> 00:09:22,628
I want that glass
in that display case

149
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:24,497
to be repaired.

150
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:48,404
Well, mr. Castle?

151
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:53,526
You have three
wishes left.

152
00:09:57,913 --> 00:10:01,033
Three wishes.

153
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:03,536
Three wishes,
three wishes.

154
00:10:03,571 --> 00:10:04,787
Anything we want.

155
00:10:04,822 --> 00:10:06,038
Well, think, think.

156
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:06,672
What do you want?

157
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:09,175
Nothing, arthur.
I want nothing.

158
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:10,426
A new shop-

159
00:10:10,461 --> 00:10:12,295
an expensive shop
on fifth avenue.

160
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:13,546
We could have that
just for the asking.

161
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:17,300
Or money, edna, money!

162
00:10:17,335 --> 00:10:18,551
$100,000!

163
00:10:18,586 --> 00:10:20,436
$200,000!

164
00:10:20,471 --> 00:10:21,687
A million!

165
00:10:21,722 --> 00:10:22,555
Edna, edna,

166
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:24,940
we wouldn't have
to grub anymore.

167
00:10:24,975 --> 00:10:27,443
We wouldn't to sit her
and waste our lives away.

168
00:10:27,478 --> 00:10:28,694
Arthur, no.

169
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:30,563
There's something
unholy about this.

170
00:10:30,598 --> 00:10:33,065
Clothes, edna,
expensive clothes.

171
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,568
Jewels,
a beautiful house!

172
00:10:35,603 --> 00:10:36,819
Anything we want,
edna!

173
00:10:36,854 --> 00:10:39,955
No more worries for
the rest of our lives.

174
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:43,709
Money.

175
00:10:43,744 --> 00:10:46,212
Money? The simplest, mr. Castle.

176
00:10:46,829 --> 00:10:49,332
How much, and in
what denominations?

177
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:53,085
How much do we want?

178
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:53,719
I don't know.

179
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:56,222
I don't know!

180
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:06,232
A million dollars,
right here on the floor,

181
00:11:06,267 --> 00:11:08,100
in five and ten
dollar bills.

182
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:12,738
That's what we want!

183
00:11:12,773 --> 00:11:14,607
A million dollars!

184
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:21,113
Ask and you shall
receive, mr. Castle.

185
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:38,381
Edna, edna!

186
00:11:43,018 --> 00:11:45,521
Edna! A million dollars, edna!

187
00:11:45,556 --> 00:11:48,641
A million dollars!
A million dollars!

188
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:50,526
Edna, look!

189
00:11:50,561 --> 00:11:52,395
A million!

190
00:11:54,196 --> 00:11:55,448
Wait, wait, wait.

191
00:11:55,483 --> 00:11:57,316
Wait, wait, wait.
So he says...

192
00:11:57,351 --> 00:11:59,201
wait. So he says,
"money?"

193
00:11:59,236 --> 00:12:00,453
So much money for me.

194
00:12:00,488 --> 00:12:02,955
I thought maybe
she's-a go outta style!

195
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:09,211
Here you are, my friend.
Here you are.

196
00:12:09,246 --> 00:12:11,080
You pay off that mortgage

197
00:12:11,115 --> 00:12:12,331
and have yourself...
start living again.

198
00:12:12,366 --> 00:12:13,582
That's it.
Here you are, my dear.

199
00:12:13,617 --> 00:12:16,085
Here. You take yourself
that vacation,

200
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,970
and bring back a boyfriend.
Don't forget.

201
00:12:18,005 --> 00:12:21,090
Mrs. Gumley. Oh, my dear.

202
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:24,226
Here. Here. More. More!

203
00:12:24,261 --> 00:12:27,346
Mrs. Gumley, god bless you.
God bless you.

204
00:12:27,381 --> 00:12:28,597
Here you are, my dear.

205
00:12:28,632 --> 00:12:29,849
No, no, no, no, no.

206
00:12:29,884 --> 00:12:31,734
You take that
home with you.

207
00:12:31,769 --> 00:12:32,985
Here you are, reverend.

208
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,854
Don't you worry.
This is honest money.

209
00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:37,356
You take it and get
that church painted.

210
00:12:37,391 --> 00:12:38,607
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir, and thank you.

211
00:12:38,642 --> 00:12:40,743
Yes, dolly,
here you are. Come here.

212
00:12:40,778 --> 00:12:43,863
You tell angelo
to get himself a new truck

213
00:12:43,898 --> 00:12:45,114
with red wheels.
Remember.

214
00:12:45,149 --> 00:12:46,365
Here you are, my...

215
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:50,870
no need. My card,
mr. Castle.

216
00:12:57,126 --> 00:12:59,628
Office of internal revenue.

217
00:12:59,663 --> 00:13:00,379
Yes, that's correct.

218
00:13:00,414 --> 00:13:03,516
There's a matter of an
income tax, mr. Castle.

219
00:13:03,551 --> 00:13:04,767
Just send
us the bill

220
00:13:04,802 --> 00:13:06,018
and we'll
pay it.

221
00:13:06,053 --> 00:13:07,887
But send us the
bill in a hurry,

222
00:13:07,922 --> 00:13:08,521
would you please?

223
00:13:09,138 --> 00:13:11,023
My wife and i will
be taking off

224
00:13:11,058 --> 00:13:12,274
for europe
very shortly.

225
00:13:13,561 --> 00:13:14,777
Dependents?

226
00:13:14,812 --> 00:13:16,645
The whole neighborhood.

227
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,531
Oh, no.
They don't count.

228
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:29,792
What does that
figure there mean?

229
00:13:29,827 --> 00:13:31,043
A million dollars,
mr. Castle.

230
00:13:31,078 --> 00:13:32,912
Taxed on the basis
of a husband and wife,

231
00:13:32,947 --> 00:13:35,414
using the standard deductions,
you owe the government

232
00:13:35,449 --> 00:13:37,299
approximately
$907,000.

233
00:13:37,334 --> 00:13:38,551
What?

234
00:13:38,586 --> 00:13:39,802
Yes, that's correct.

235
00:13:39,837 --> 00:13:41,670
Then, in addition,

236
00:13:41,705 --> 00:13:43,556
there's a state income tax
involved which...

237
00:13:43,591 --> 00:13:45,174
using thumb rule...

238
00:13:45,209 --> 00:13:47,560
the whole thing comes
to a total of...

239
00:13:47,595 --> 00:13:50,062
roughly, mind you...

240
00:13:50,097 --> 00:13:51,931
$942,640.

241
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:58,320
Arthur, we've already
given away a lot of money.

242
00:14:00,823 --> 00:14:03,325
Well, now, if you'll
just fill out this form

243
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,828
and send it to us
with your check?

244
00:14:09,733 --> 00:14:12,201
Oh, uh... if you want
to use the installment plan,

245
00:14:12,236 --> 00:14:14,703
we'll send you a statement after
the form has been analyzed.

246
00:14:17,206 --> 00:14:18,457
Uh... mr. Castle?

247
00:14:18,492 --> 00:14:21,093
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Just send us a bill.

248
00:14:21,128 --> 00:14:23,712
Well, we'll be seeing you,
mr. Castle.

249
00:14:23,747 --> 00:14:26,465
Good evening,
mrs. Castle.

250
00:14:56,912 --> 00:14:58,797
Well?

251
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:01,917
$910,530.

252
00:15:01,952 --> 00:15:03,802
$910,535.

253
00:15:03,837 --> 00:15:05,671
$910,540.

254
00:15:05,706 --> 00:15:10,309
We gave away almost $60,000.

255
00:15:10,344 --> 00:15:16,565
And this goes to taxes,
and this...

256
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,434
and this...

257
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:21,937
five dollars?

258
00:15:22,571 --> 00:15:24,440
Yeah.

259
00:15:24,475 --> 00:15:26,325
Quite a wish, arthur.

260
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,576
Quite a wish.

261
00:15:27,611 --> 00:15:30,696
And we haven't even
paid those bills yet.

262
00:15:30,731 --> 00:15:32,448
Mr. Castle...

263
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,584
it was my suggestion

264
00:15:35,619 --> 00:15:39,955
that you reflect
very carefully, mr. Castle.

265
00:15:41,457 --> 00:15:43,342
Very, very carefully.

266
00:15:43,377 --> 00:15:45,210
Now, had you made a wish

267
00:15:45,245 --> 00:15:48,347
that took into account
the taxes involved...

268
00:15:48,382 --> 00:15:49,465
oh...

269
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,716
look, you.

270
00:15:50,751 --> 00:15:53,852
Plenty of sweet talk and
promises and the whole thing,

271
00:15:53,887 --> 00:15:55,721
and all the time you're nothing

272
00:15:55,756 --> 00:15:57,606
but a
con artist.

273
00:15:57,641 --> 00:15:59,475
This time,
i want the million dollars,

274
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:00,726
but i want itafter...

275
00:16:00,761 --> 00:16:03,228
arthur,
no more money.

276
00:16:03,263 --> 00:16:05,731
You got to wish
for something else.

277
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:08,233
Something else.

278
00:16:08,268 --> 00:16:10,736
How about
ten more wishes?

279
00:16:10,771 --> 00:16:11,987
Or 20?

280
00:16:12,022 --> 00:16:13,872
Don't be in such
a hurry, arthur.

281
00:16:13,907 --> 00:16:15,374
Then you think
of something!

282
00:16:15,409 --> 00:16:17,743
I'm afraid wishing
for more wishes

283
00:16:17,778 --> 00:16:19,628
isn't permitted, mr. Castle.

284
00:16:19,663 --> 00:16:21,246
Frankly, i'd be afraid
to have you try

285
00:16:21,281 --> 00:16:23,132
for fear of the consequences.

286
00:16:23,167 --> 00:16:24,883
What consequences?

287
00:16:24,918 --> 00:16:26,752
Why do you keep
losing your temper?

288
00:16:26,787 --> 00:16:29,888
Well, you're no help
for me. That's for sure!

289
00:16:29,923 --> 00:16:31,757
Here we stand
in this crummy little shop,

290
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:34,259
with the whole world
out in front of us,

291
00:16:34,294 --> 00:16:36,145
with anything to wish for
that we want,

292
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,013
and you just
stay on my back...!

293
00:16:38,048 --> 00:16:39,898
Arthur!

294
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,401
Edna.

295
00:16:42,436 --> 00:16:46,021
What... what's
happening with us?

296
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:49,158
What's going on?

297
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:52,277
Oddly enough,
mr. Castle,

298
00:16:52,312 --> 00:16:53,529
this is the normal pattern

299
00:16:53,564 --> 00:16:55,414
that seems
to be generally followed-

300
00:16:55,449 --> 00:16:57,533
great excitement,
great emotionalism.

301
00:16:57,568 --> 00:16:59,284
Strangely enough,

302
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:01,787
hard to believe
though it may be,

303
00:17:01,822 --> 00:17:04,289
only a modicum of happiness.

304
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:09,795
Well...
you got a couple

305
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:11,680
of cheap customers
here, mister.

306
00:17:11,715 --> 00:17:15,434
People that haven't
known much happiness.

307
00:17:15,469 --> 00:17:18,554
What? What? What
do we wish for?

308
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:19,805
I wish
i knew, arthur.

309
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,690
I don't know!

310
00:17:22,691 --> 00:17:23,809
What about it, genie?

311
00:17:23,844 --> 00:17:25,060
What can
we wish for now?

312
00:17:25,694 --> 00:17:27,563
What can come to us
without tricks?

313
00:17:27,598 --> 00:17:29,314
Without tricks!

314
00:17:29,349 --> 00:17:31,200
I question the semantics here,
mr. Castle.

315
00:17:31,235 --> 00:17:32,451
There are no tricks involved.

316
00:17:32,486 --> 00:17:34,953
There are simply normal
and understandable outgrowths

317
00:17:34,988 --> 00:17:38,707
and conditions
that go with any windfall.

318
00:17:38,742 --> 00:17:40,576
No matter what you wish for,

319
00:17:40,611 --> 00:17:44,329
you must be prepared
for the consequences.

320
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:52,721
Something without
consequences.

321
00:17:52,756 --> 00:17:55,224
Something dead sure.

322
00:17:55,259 --> 00:17:58,977
Something anchored,
something airtight.

323
00:18:02,731 --> 00:18:05,851
Edna, i think
i got it.

324
00:18:05,886 --> 00:18:09,605
I think i know
what it is.

325
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,490
What, arthur?

326
00:18:11,525 --> 00:18:13,992
Power. Power, edna.

327
00:18:14,027 --> 00:18:17,746
To be in charge
of something...

328
00:18:17,781 --> 00:18:20,249
the boss...
to be a leader.

329
00:18:20,284 --> 00:18:23,368
We could wish
for that.

330
00:18:23,403 --> 00:18:24,620
Possible.

331
00:18:24,655 --> 00:18:25,871
Very possible.

332
00:18:25,906 --> 00:18:28,507
President of a corporation?

333
00:18:28,542 --> 00:18:29,758
That sort
of thing?

334
00:18:29,793 --> 00:18:32,261
He could go bankrupt.

335
00:18:32,296 --> 00:18:33,629
Mayor of a city?

336
00:18:33,664 --> 00:18:36,014
You get voted out of office,
then what?

337
00:18:36,049 --> 00:18:38,517
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

338
00:18:38,552 --> 00:18:40,269
I know what.

339
00:18:40,304 --> 00:18:43,388
Head of a country.

340
00:18:43,423 --> 00:18:46,525
Ruler of a whole country.

341
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,393
That's it.

342
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:52,281
What about it, genie?

343
00:18:52,316 --> 00:18:54,149
I want to be the
head of a country

344
00:18:54,184 --> 00:18:56,034
who can't be voted
out of office.

345
00:18:56,069 --> 00:18:58,153
Do you want to be more specific
than that?

346
00:18:58,188 --> 00:19:00,539
Wait a minute.

347
00:19:00,574 --> 00:19:03,041
Let me give it to you this way.

348
00:19:03,659 --> 00:19:06,795
I want to be the head
of a foreign country

349
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:09,915
who can't be voted
out of office,

350
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:13,051
but it must be
a contemporary country.

351
00:19:13,086 --> 00:19:14,303
Contemporary?

352
00:19:14,338 --> 00:19:15,554
Within this century.

353
00:19:15,589 --> 00:19:17,306
No problems.

354
00:19:17,341 --> 00:19:21,059
What about consequences?

355
00:19:22,963 --> 00:19:24,813
Consequences, mr. Castle?

356
00:19:24,848 --> 00:19:26,682
I've already told you.

357
00:19:26,717 --> 00:19:31,687
You run the risk of consequences
no matter what you wish for.

358
00:19:34,189 --> 00:19:36,074
All right, then.

359
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:42,698
Go ahead, arthur.
You wish for that.

360
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:48,337
I want to be the ruler
of a foreign country,

361
00:19:48,372 --> 00:19:50,956
just as i've
described it.

362
00:19:50,991 --> 00:19:52,958
Go ahead, genie.

363
00:19:52,993 --> 00:19:54,843
Take over.

364
00:19:54,878 --> 00:19:59,598
As you wish, mr. Castle.

365
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:18,367
From now on, it's
just a mass suicide.

366
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:20,869
Well, what about
it, fuhrer?

367
00:20:22,773 --> 00:20:23,989
Head of a country.

368
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:27,125
Can't be voted out
of office.

369
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,377
I'm hitler.

370
00:20:28,412 --> 00:20:30,245
I'm in a bunker.

371
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,130
It's the end of the war.

372
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:39,638
Mein fuhrer.

373
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:46,511
What you asked for.

374
00:20:46,546 --> 00:20:49,014
Very quick...

375
00:20:49,049 --> 00:20:52,768
and very painless,
mein fuhrer.

376
00:20:52,803 --> 00:20:57,155
And we have
the gasoline outside

377
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:00,275
for you and miss braun

378
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:03,412
when you finish.

379
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:51,576
I wish... i wish i were back
where it all started.

380
00:21:51,611 --> 00:21:55,330
I wish i were
arthur castle again!

381
00:22:02,838 --> 00:22:05,340
What's the matter,
arthur?

382
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:06,591
You look so funny.

383
00:22:06,626 --> 00:22:07,843
What happened?

384
00:22:07,878 --> 00:22:12,230
I had a wish
fulfilled.

385
00:22:12,265 --> 00:22:15,984
Number four.

386
00:22:16,019 --> 00:22:19,738
All the wishes ended
the same way-

387
00:22:19,773 --> 00:22:22,858
in fragments,
little pieces.

388
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,863
Funny thing, though.

389
00:22:27,898 --> 00:22:32,868
This place... this... this
place doesn't look half bad.

390
00:22:32,903 --> 00:22:34,753
You all right?

391
00:22:34,788 --> 00:22:36,621
Oh, i'm fine.

392
00:22:36,656 --> 00:22:39,758
Well, maybe we'll stop
wishing for a while.

393
00:22:39,793 --> 00:22:42,878
And, since we obviously
can't afford

394
00:22:42,913 --> 00:22:44,129
a brand-new life,

395
00:22:44,164 --> 00:22:46,631
suppose we give the
old one a paint job

396
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:48,517
or something?

397
00:22:50,385 --> 00:22:54,773
I think that's
a very good idea.

398
00:22:56,059 --> 00:22:57,275
What are you
laughing at?

399
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:59,778
We came out of it
ahead anyway.

400
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:09,654
Shouldn't be
a total loss.

401
00:23:39,568 --> 00:23:41,069
A word to the wise now

402
00:23:41,104 --> 00:23:42,938
to the garbage collectors
of the world,

403
00:23:43,572 --> 00:23:45,440
to the curio seekers,
to the antique buffs,

404
00:23:46,074 --> 00:23:48,577
to everyone who would try
to coax out a miracle

405
00:23:48,612 --> 00:23:50,445
from unlikely places.

406
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:59,454
Check that bottle you're taking
back for a two-cent deposit.

407
00:23:59,489 --> 00:24:01,957
The genie you save
might be your own.

408
00:24:01,992 --> 00:24:05,093
Case in point,
mr. And mrs. Arthur castle,

409
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:07,596
fresh from
the briefest of trips

410
00:24:07,631 --> 00:24:09,464
into the twilight zone.

411
00:24:14,136 --> 00:24:16,638
Rod serling,
creator of the twilight zone,

412
00:24:16,673 --> 00:24:19,141
will tell you
about next week's story

413
00:24:19,176 --> 00:24:22,994
after this word
from our alternate sponsor.

414
00:24:23,029 --> 00:24:26,097
And now, mr. Serling.

415
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:29,217
Next week, we take you
into this 8x8 hotel room,

416
00:24:29,252 --> 00:24:32,354
and we watch a penny-ante crook
make a decision.

417
00:24:32,389 --> 00:24:34,222
You better ask the room clerk
the number of this room,

418
00:24:34,257 --> 00:24:36,107
and then come on up.

419
00:24:36,142 --> 00:24:39,861
Mr. Joe mantell is the nervous
man in the four dollar room.

420
00:24:39,896 --> 00:24:41,730
That'sthe twilight zone
next week,

421
00:24:41,765 --> 00:24:43,615
and we'll be waiting for you.

422
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:45,484
Thank you and good night.

423
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:32,330
Be sure and see
the colgate-palmolive company's

424
00:25:32,365 --> 00:25:34,833
new comedy show
my sister eileen

425
00:25:34,868 --> 00:25:37,953
wednesday night
on many of these same stations.
