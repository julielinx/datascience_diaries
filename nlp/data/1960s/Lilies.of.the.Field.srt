1
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,799
My car's thirsty.
Can I please have some water?

2
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,959
God is good.
He has sent me a big, strong man.

3
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,197
He didn't say anything to me about it.
I was just passing.

4
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,834
But you did not pass.

5
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,551
That is your... your car?

6
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,080
That's my home.

7
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,270
You fix und dann habe ich...

8
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,869
I have something you do.

9
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,835
I thank you very kindly, ma'am, but
I got places to go. Thanks for the water.

10
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,239
If it's for hire,
you got yourself one man for one day.

11
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,875
- Hire?
- You want me to work for you?

12
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,278
For hire means for money. I could build
a better fence than your girls.

13
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,916
Schwester Gertrude. Schwester Albertine.
Schwester Elizabeth. Schwester Agnes.

14
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,429
I am Mother Maria.

15
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:12,031
Pleased to meet you all. You've got a nice
family, ma'am. My name is Homer Smith.

16
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,038
- Homer...?
- Homer Schmidt.

17
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,116
Oh, Schmidt!

18
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,749
Herr Schmidt, no fence.
We do that ourselves.

19
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,996
Up there. The roof.

20
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,431
- You fix?
- It couldn't be leaking on a day like this.

21
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,915
- Roof only leaks when it rains.
- Was?

22
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,031
I'm only kidding. I'll fix it good.

23
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,870
- You use this.
- No, thanks. I've got my own.

24
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,358
(exclaim in German)

25
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,835
Can't do good work without good tools
and if you hire me, you get good work.

26
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,916
Hire.

27
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,068
Schwester, das Bett in die Scheune.

28
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,315
- What's that?
- The bed you sleep.

29
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,796
- No. I got my own arrangements.
- You sleep in here?

30
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:39,356
Schwester, tragen Sie die Sachen zurück
ins Haus. Schmidt schläft in seinem Auto.

31
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,914
No, no, you got it just a little bit wrong.

32
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,476
The job is finished,
so you pay me and I take off.

33
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,034
- Take off?
- Thatta way.

34
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,958
You have such a hurry?

35
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:56,279
I'm hungry. I figured I'd find me a chilli
wagon and log another hundred miles.

36
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,473
We were not put on the earth
to hurry, Schmidt.

37
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,875
For supper, I ring the bell.

38
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,038
Schmidt!

39
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:36,154
Jesu Christ, sei unser Gast und segne,
was du bescheret hast.

40
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,111
Amen.

41
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,436
Himmlischer Vater...

42
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,119
Möge das Essen, das du uns gibst,

43
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,711
Homer Schmidt stark machen,
damit er deinen Willen erfüllen kann.

44
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,715
- Amen.
- Amen.

45
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,555

47

Er sagt, wir leben
von den Früchten des Landes.

49
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,636
Oh, ja! Ja!

50
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,151
God sets a mighty poor table.

51
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,272
Soon we will have vegetables too.

52
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,596
And sometimes chicken.

53
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,436
- Well...
- You smoke?

54
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,438
- Yes, ma'am.
- You smoke is all right.

55
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,875
- I think I'd better be rolling.
- Do not make hurry.

56
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:02,238
We are from Germany,
from Austria and from Hungary.

57
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,749

- Lots of luck. I ain't building no "shapel".
- Ja, you.

150
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,954
Not only am I ain't building no "shapel",
I'm taking off! I ain't no contractor.

151
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,150

- No.

152
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,351
- I don't need all that work. No.
- No? All right.

153
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,869
- All right.
- We build it. We women.

All right. I'll clean out some of that stuff.

157
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,233
I don't want those girls
to break their backs.

158
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:26,239

- Let's settle up.
- Ja, sind Sie denn nicht zufrieden?

00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,112
Wenn wir das gewusst hätten, hätten wir
Ihnen das Frühstück ans Bett gebracht.

161
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,276
I hope you're not talking mean to me.

162
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:37,393
You wanted your breakfast in bed?
You talk like American millionaire!

163
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,988

Very good. Very good.

176
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,389
- Very good, Schwester Elizabeth.
- Danke schön.

177
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:04,399
"Thank you." Thank you.
Danke schön. Thank you.

178
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:08,638
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

179
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,996
- Thank you.
- Beautiful.

180
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,398
Now you try it, Mama. "Thank you."

181
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,836
It's time.

182
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,916
- Good night.
- Good night.

183
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,551
- Good night, Sister Elizabeth.
- Good night.

184
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,671
Good night, Sister Albertine.

185
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:33,430
Sister Agnes, you be up early.
You've got to milk that poor old cow.

186
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:36,438
I milk the poor old cow.

187
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,034
You like to make jokes, Schmidt?

188
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,991
This isn't exactly a joke.

189
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:51,112
Now I sit down.

190
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,470
I give you a bill.

191
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,751
You pay me for my services.

192
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,032
I've put in two good days here, Mother.
I'm for hire, remember? Hire.

193
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,435
I speak English not so good.

194
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,870
You want to take advantage
of a poor country boy like me?

195
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,150
OK.

196
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,430
OK. We'll play it your way.

197
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,838
Book of Luke, chapter ten, verse seven.

198
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,030
Your Bible is all in German.

199
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,234
I'll read it to you in English.

200
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:39,792
"And in the same house remain, eating
and drinking such things as they give,

201
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:43,993
for the labourer is worthy of his hire."

202
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:47,590
That's not exactly what I had in mind
but you get the idea.

203
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,192
What you got there? Proverbs 14.

204
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,673
"Cast in thy lot amongst us,
let us all have one purse... "

205
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:10,679
I am a poor man! I've got to work
for wages. I can't work for...

206
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,029
Matthew... chapter six.

207
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,948
Acht und zwanzig...

208
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,355
Two-eight-two-nine.

209
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,040
Matthew, chapter six, 28-29.

210
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,875
Schmidt, read it in English.

211
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,431
"Why take thee thought for raiment?"

212
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,630
"Consider the lilies of the field
and how they grow."

213
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,318
"They toil not, neither do they spin,

214
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,398
yet I say unto you,
not even Solomon in all his glories

215
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,636
was arrayed as one of these."

216
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,228
Consider the lilies.

217
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,188
- What's that?
- You go to bed.

218
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:03,029
Tomorrow Sunday is.
The mass in town is nine by the clock.

219
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:06,072
- I'm a Baptist. I don't go to mass.
- We go.

220
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,875
- How'd you get there before?
- We walk every Sunday. Now we got you.

221
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,560
Now dammit! You ain't got me!

222
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,035
- Good night, Schmidt.
- Get that straight!

223
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,390
- Schlafen Sie wohl.
- And cut that out.

224
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,476
Bless you, Schmidt.

225
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,240
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

226
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,032
Morning.

227
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,594
- No breakfast?
- Never before mass.

228
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,032
Oh.

229
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,753
You guys look nice - lean, but nice.

230
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,916
- Where's it at?
- Was, Schmidt?

231
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,838
The church.

232
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:12,032
- Yeah, but where's it at?
- Er will wissen, wo die Kirche ist.

233
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,557
- That's not fair.
- Over there, Schmidt.

234
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,153
- Now come.
- No.

235
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,191
I'm gonna wait in here for you.

236
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,394
- Are you the man?
- I am the man.

237
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,076
- Can I get me some breakfast?
- Name it.

238
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,350
- A real breakfast?
- Whatever you say.

239
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,313
Double OJ and squeeze it fresh.

240
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,353
So?

241
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:07,431
A stack of wheatcakes with lots
of melted butter... maple syrup.

242
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:13,030
And fry me three, four, five eggs
with a mess of sausages

243
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:17,119
and a mountain of white toast
with strawberry marmalade

244
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,959
and... keep the coffee coming.

245
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,149
- No beans?
- You got beans?

246
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,635
- The most, señor.
- Them too.

247
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,396
You take milk?

248
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:42,550
- I said fresh.
- I squeezed it myself this morning.

249
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,313
OK.

250
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,230
Very nice.

251
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:56,194
Very nice. Now...
melt some cheese over those beans.

252
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:01,197
- What's the matter you're not in church?
- I'm a Baptist.

253
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:04,790
- Why are you working for the sisters?
- I work for myself.

254
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:08,356
- How come you're not in church?
- I got a business.

255
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,553
- But you're a Catholic.
- No! I was born one, but...

256
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,759
- Father Murphy...
- What's the matter with him?

257
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,314
- He drinks.
- He's a priest.

258
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,238
- He's Irish.
- Oh.

259
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,116
Holy, holy, holy, hm?

260
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,869
You pray hard enough and your stomach
doesn't feel empty any more.

261
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,471
Praying does not pay the rent
and praying does not fill up the gas.

262
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,797
God ain't gonna get behind
this counter and sling hash.

263
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,354
Me? I gotta fill my wallet.

264
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:47,750
- Hey.
- What?

265
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,474
- They pay you?
- Sure.

266
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,876
I just wondered.
I heard they don't have a cent.

267
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,150
Not a cent.

268
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:59,352
Crazy trying to farm that land.
They aren't mean enough.

269
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,436
That old Mother, she'll do.

270
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:04,120
Oh-h-h!

271
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:08,278
Old Gus Ritter -
he used to own the place.

272
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,278
He could grow potatoes on bare rock.

273
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,472
He left the place
to this religious order in Germany.

274
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,309
East Germany. The sisters
came over the Wall. They tell you that?

275
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,919
- No. Like in Berlin?
- Sí.

276
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:29,239
Over the Wall, across the ocean,
across the country to what? This.

277
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:34,671
- They can't even talk the language.
- I've been straightening them out.

278
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,394
- Yeah?
- Sho'nuff!

279
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:43,395
Hey, listen. You ain't
gonna hang around with the sisters?

280
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:47,433
- Nah. I'm just passing through.
- That's right!

281
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:51,394
The sisters ask you something,
you tell them no. Keep right on going.

282
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,875
- That pie there?
- Sure.

283
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,117
- The whole one. Can I have it?
- It's gonna cost you.

284
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:00,073
Wrap it. I'm a millionaire.
From Wall Street.

285
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:03,351
- My name is Homer Smith.
- Juan Aquilito.

286
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,838
Schmidt!

287
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,913
Schmidt!

288
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:15,828
- Schmidt!
- Looks like you're being paged.

289
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,789
Das ist Schmidt.
Schmidt, Father Murphy.

290
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,195
Father Murphy will talk with you.

291
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,276
Pleased to meet you.

292
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,874
Cuidado con los velos. Deprisa.

293
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,594
Can we get out of this heat?

294
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,029
I didn't know Catholics
had outdoor meetings.

295
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:53,837
I got five other country clubs like this.
I cover about 400 miles a week.

296
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,114
Welcome to the poor man's Vatican.

297
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,673
Oh.

298
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,955
Mother Superior tells me
she believes God sent you to her.

299
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:15,232
No. I don't think he sent
a black Baptist to a Catholic nun!

300
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,396
That's what she tells me.

301
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:21,909
She also says
you're gonna build her a chapel.

302
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,554
She asked me.

303
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,877
But you know how it is.
I got other fish to fry.

304
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,151
She believes there was a need
and she put her trust in prayer.

305
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,676
When I was ordained, how I prayed.

306
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:38,999
How I prayed for a call to a great majestic
cathedral in some wealthy diocese.

307
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,192
I sent the message up in English,
in Latin, and he answered.

308
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,912
He answered.

309
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:50,195
I baptise them,
christen them, confirm them,

310
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:54,279
hear their confessions, give absolution,
last rites, bless their remains,

311
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,710
fill the tank, check the oil and water,
take off again and pray.

312
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,196
Pray that I don't blow out
one of those old tyres.

313
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:04,596
- You staying with the sisters?
- I'm just passing through.

314
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,836
Well, I think that's for the best.

315
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:58,115
- Sing another.
- Was sollen wir singen?

316
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,196
"Ave Maris Stella".

317
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:09,438
# Ave Maris Stella

318
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:14,236
# Dei mater alma

319
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:20,435
# Atque semper virgo

320
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:24,678
# Felix coeli porta

321
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:29,874
# Amen

322
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,591
That's one you have to teach me.

323
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,508
- Now you sing.
- All right.

324
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:42,229
- What do you want to hear?
- We know Kirchen song only.

325
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:45,511
- Just sing, ja?
- All right.

326
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:49,391
# Frankie and Johnny were lovers

327
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:53,595
# Oh, Lordy, how they... could...

328
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,155
Erase that one.

329
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:05,718
Tell you what. I'll sing one of them
down home, go-to-meeting songs

330
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,956
and you join in with me, all right?

331
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:11,197
- All you have to sing is "Amen."
- Amen.

332
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,992
Nicht ah-men. Ay-men.

333
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:17,636
- Ay-men?
- Right. OK. Here we go.

334
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,832
# Amen

335
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,793
# Amen

336
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,911
# Amen

337
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:31,034
# Amen, amen...
Now come on.

338
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,592
# Amen

339
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:37,632
# Amen

340
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,910
# Amen

341
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:43,919
# Amen, amen,
Sing it over

342
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,873
# Amen

343
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,798
# Amen

344
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,150
# Amen

345
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:56,034
- # Amen, amen

375
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,793
Schmidt!

376
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,395
Two times I call you for breakfast!

377
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,432
I heard you. You can keep
the cup of milk and the one egg.

378
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:06,314
You sucker me into breakfast, I'm
obliged to work. Not me. I'm cutting out.

379
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,998
Was?

380
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:11,795
This little soul is leaving the roost.
I'm heading thatta way.

381
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,036
- Thatta way?
- I'm leaving.

382
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,240
Schwester Gertrude, schnell!

383
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:21,796
Hurry up! Schmidt will
take us to Northfolk!

384
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,909
- You take us to Northfolk.
- You got bus fare?

385
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,679
- Back?
- We'll get back. Don't worry about us.

386
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,392
Amen!

387
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:10,228
Well... it's been interesting.
Not profitable, but interesting.

388
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,635
Schmidt, where do you go?

389
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,434
I don't know. West?

390
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:20,393
LA, San Francisco.
Maybe I'll swing on up to...

391
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,356
So... goodbye.

392
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:31,908
- Schwester Gertrude.
- Leben Sie wohl.

393
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,077
Hey, boy.

394
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,876
Are you Schmidt?

395
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:27,111
Well, that's what they call me.
My name is Homer Smith.

396
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:31,028
Are you the fellow who's supposed
to build a chapel? They must be kidding.

397
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:37,269
- Why?
- They tell me you're their contractor.

398
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,198
- So?
- Are you a contractor?

399
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:45,991
- What's wrong with that?
- Well, what kind of contractor?

400
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,434
Independent.

401
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:52,279
You local?
I don't remember doing business before.

402
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:56,791
- I'm out of State.
- How did they get mixed up with you?

403
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:00,117
- How did they talk you into it?
- Nobody talked me into anything.

404
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,073
They conned me out of some adobe brick
and some lumber.

405
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:08,069
I figured I could write that off, but
if you're their contractor, like you say,

406
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:11,875
tell her to take her business someplace
else. My terms are strictly cash.

407
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,310
- You understand, boy?
- I understand. Hey, boy!

408
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,795
- You need a good man?
- A good man.

409
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,388
- I can give you two days a week.
- Doing what?

410
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,637
- Moving earth. Those.
- You got any experience?

411
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,228
I can handle any earth-moving
equipment you've got.

412
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,669
What are you gonna be doing
the rest of the time?

413
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:37,952
What have we been talking about?
I'm gonna build me a chapel.

414
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:45,711
OK, contractor. I'll pay you the going rate
for labour on the job you're assigned.

415
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:50,675
Seven o'clock, Thursday morning. But if
you're snowing me, you'll be out at 7.15.

416
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,477
Just a second.

417
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,110
- Goodbye, Schmidt.
- Get in the car.

418
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:09,199
- We go to the bus stop.
- Don't be cute.

419
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:12,118
I don't want him to think
we're having a fuss.

420
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,196
- Fuss?
- Yes. Fuss.

421
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,595
You don't fuss with your contractor.

422
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,116
We can do it, Schmidt.

423
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:38,878
There are three ingredients to a job
like this. First, you need a plan. Check?

424
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,070
Two, you need labour.

425
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,156
But, three, you need materials.

426
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:49,431
That's for openers. You're gonna need 10,
20, 30, 40 times as many bricks as that.

427
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,876
Can you get them?

428
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,478
Ja!

429
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,673
OK.

430
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,634
OK. Let's get to work.

431
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,592
You still listening, Lord,

432
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:40,554
would you mind putting
a little meat on the table? Please?

433
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:59,274
The work goes well.

434
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,834
The problem is money.

435
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:06,635
I request to your organisation...

436
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:11,316
which is renowned for its...

437
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:14,829
- Philanthropics.
- Was?

438
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,439
Philanthropics.

439
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:20,473
- Was machen Sie da, Schwester?
- Das Mittagessen für Herr Schmidt.

440
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:24,154
Lesen Sie mir das Ganze noch mal vor.

441
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:30,037
"The Maximillian Fund,
sieben elf, Fünf Avenue, New York City.

442
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:33,391
"Highly honoured
and respected gentlemen,

443
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:37,877
permit me to an appeal
for financing assistance... "

444
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,355
No. Wait. A better word.

445
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:48,993
Dollars!

446
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:31,793
- The Lions.
- Ja.

447
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,512
- The Elks.
- Ja.

448
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:36,791
- The Order of Moose.
- Ja.

449
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:40,629
Kiwanis. What kind of animal is that?

450
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:42,512
Americans.

451
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:52,554
Schmidt! You make knocking.
Like I told you.

452
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:57,594
- We saved for you supper.
- No more bread and milk.

453
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,517
A nice potato soup.

454
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:02,996
Oh, and that'll make me
nice and fat and strong?

455
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:05,190
- Ja.
- And you love me fat and strong!

456
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:07,356
Ja.

457
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:11,556
Oh, Schnuller!

458
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:17,400
Hey, hey. You like that.

459
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:37,757
What now?

460
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:40,314
Look your hands. Dirty!

461
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:43,591
Go wash your dirty hands and face.

462
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:50,034
OK, I will.

463
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:53,948
Then I come and give for you
the English lesson. Nein? Ja!

464
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:55,991
Ja!

465
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:00,635
Danke dir Gott, für diesen Segen.

466
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:05,074
Ah, how about thanking me too, eh?

467
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:10,033
No. I thank Him.
You, you couldn't help yourself.

468
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,952
Oh, boy.

469
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,158
# Wrapped in the manger

470
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:19,317
- # Amen
- # On Christmas morning

471
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:25,356
- # Amen, amen, amen
- # See him in the temple

472
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:28,358
- # Amen
- # Talking with the elders

473
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,358
- # Amen
- # Who marvel at his wisdom

474
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:37,396
- # Amen, amen, amen
- # Down at the Jordan

475
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:40,512
- # Amen
- # Where John was baptising

476
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:43,518
- # Amen
- # And saving all the sinners

477
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:48,873
# Amen, amen, amen...

478
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,790
- Come with us, Schmidt.
- No, ma'am.

479
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,673
- I'm gonna go feed my Baptist stomach.
- Come.

480
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:39,430
Good people of Piedras,

481
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:43,519
you have seen this man
who brings us now to the mass,

482
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:47,428
but you did not know who he was,
what he was.

483
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:50,916
I tell you now.
His name is Homer Schmidt.

484
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:57,639
He is not of our faith,
but he was sent to us by our God,

485
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:00,593
who is the God of all faiths.

486
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:04,395
He is building us a chapel.

487
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:12,714
It is true! And so we will
all see it. A miracle!

488
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,836
Hey, Mother!

489
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:15,556
- I laid my last brick.
- A good start.

490
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:18,877
- And I ran out of board.
- Everything works out.

491
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,913
- I'm ready to keep going but...
- Everything works out.

492
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,951
Yeah, you said that.

493
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:29,312
- Tomorrow you for Ashton work?
- Tomorrow and the next day. Why?

494
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,749
Then we see.

495
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:37,510
- Look, we had a bargain. I kept my end...
- Everything works out. It's God's will.

496
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:41,315
- That we get brick or that we don't?
- Whatever.

497
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:44,671
You would have made a great lawyer,
you know that?

498
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:52,236
Bobkin.

499
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:55,112
Sherman.

500
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:58,116
Good night.

501
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:01,037
Smith.

502
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:06,075
- Tell me, how's the contracting business?
- It's all right.

503
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:09,795
Just out of curiosity,
what are you using for materials?

504
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:13,548
We're expecting a new shipment.

505
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,715
No bricks?

506
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:08,558
Why do you buy things to eat
we do not need?

507
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:10,989
Now just a minute.

508
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:13,076
You are very large on religion

509
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,668
but you don't know
how to accept a gift from somebody

510
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:19,270
without making them feel small.
Small! You follow?

511
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:22,039
Poor man. His feelings is hurt!

512
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:26,870
I'm not twisting your arm for any big
thank-yous, but I'm through feeling small.

513
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,117
I got all the patience in the world!

514
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:34,508
Then why do you work on the road gang
when you should build the chapel?

515
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:36,596
Where are the bricks?

516
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:43,472
They will come. Maybe not tonight, but
there is other things you could be busy.

517
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:46,429
Raking and planting trees.

518
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:49,393
We had this contract.
You failed to keep your part.

519
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:54,639
I failed because I put my faith in people
instead of in God!

520
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:57,991
Forget it.
It was an invisible contract anyway.

521
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:02,238
- I don't believe you any more.
- Who are you not to believe me?

522
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:06,831
Hm?! Somebody
passing through thatta way?

523
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:10,919
Me, I come 8,000 miles to this place.

524
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:14,953
You cry about a few bricks
which are not here when you want them!

525
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:18,436
Do you know what we went through
to get to this place?

526
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:22,035
You will not
stand in the way of this chapel.

527
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:26,110
No. It will be done.

528
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:29,439
Well, good luck, Charlie,
and you deal me out.

529
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:32,191
Yeah. That stuff you wear,

530
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:35,039
you think it's a uniform
that makes you some kind of cop,

531
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:38,277
laying down the law,
throwing your weight around.

532
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:43,679
You sound like one of them
old war movies. A regular Hitler!

533
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:52,679
Well, you get yourself another boy.

534
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:35,478
Mutter Maria! Hat der Schmidt
seinen Hammer daeglassen?

535
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:39,195
Nein! He left nothing. Nothing!

536
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:41,356
Das haben wir nötig gehabt.

537
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:45,792
Zuerst beten wir für ihn, dann kommt er
und dann shickt sie ihn weg.

538
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,236
Nothing.

539
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:52,117
- You haven't heard anything from Smith?
- Nein. Nothing.

540
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:55,676
- It's been three weeks.
- We thought at least he write postcard...

541
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:58,997
Schweigen Sie, Schwester.
He will return.

542
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:02,999
You're sure of that? Well, I wouldn't
get too upset about it, ma'am.

543
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:06,430
He's shiftless and irresponsible,
you know the type?

544
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:10,235
If he should come back,
tell him I'll hold his job open for a while.

545
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:13,272
He's a pretty good man with a bulldozer.

546
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:11,593
Smile at the people.

547
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:16,875
But don't say anything.

548
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:21,476
Go get your breakfast.

549
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:30,036
Good morning.

550
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:33,196
Good morning.

551
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:36,390
Such a beautiful morning.

552
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:54,949
Business Sunday morning
seems to have gotten better since I left.

553
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:57,594
A question. Why?

554
00:58:57,720 --> 00:59:00,678
- Why did I take off?
- No. Why you come back?

555
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:05,953
What's it to you?

556
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:13,875
Sí. Sí. Sí. Gracias.

557
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,912
- Now you have done it.
- Hm?

558
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:21,591
That was a messenger. They
want to know if you are back to stay.

559
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:26,919
I have told them yes. I make them happy.
Now you have the big breakfast, eh?

560
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:30,120
What will it be?

561
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,956
A coke.

562
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:41,719
"Wash yourself, Schmidt.
Vash away ze stink."

563
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:51,512
Why didn't they ask me to build
a bath tub with nice hot water?

564
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:56,595
That'd make more sense.
"Wash yourself, Schmidt."

565
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:07,709
That's the first kind word I've had
since I got back.

566
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:15,635
What bugs me, she was so positive
I was coming back.

567
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:20,516
You wouldn't happen to have
a nice cold can of beer on you?

568
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:25,916
I must be out of my skull coming back.

569
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:29,672
Schmidt!

570
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:33,276
Schmidt!

571
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:46,358
Schmidt, look, all these bricks!
Isn't it glorious?

572
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:49,192
Gracias.

573
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:55,996
Faulpelz. Lassen Sie doch die...

574
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:59,157
- Don't work them by themselves.
- This isn't enough.

575
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,669
- All right.
- All right? What?

576
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:03,756
We pray some more!

577
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:38,152
- We have come to help you.
- Thanks.

578
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:42,237
I thank you very much,
but I don't need any help, thank you.

579
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:56,675
You are sure
you are doing the right thing?

580
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:00,876
You prayed up a lot of bricks, Mama,

581
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:04,197
but you only prayed for one man
to build your chapel.

582
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:35,789
Hey, amigo. I had to come see
the one-man cathedral.

583
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:42,393
This is all you have done in one week?
God made the whole world in that time.

584
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:44,829
And he was able to rest.

585
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:48,954
Hey. Notice your audience.

586
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:55,072
- I can't get rid of 'em.
- They heard it was the best show in town!

587
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:28,792
Está bien para un americano.

588
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:02,554
Move your foot off my adobe.

589
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:09,029
Where would you like us to bury you?
Under the altar?

590
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:11,116
Move your foot off my adobe.

591
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:05,910
You do not want it? Do not take it.
Step over it and go get another one.

592
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:49,070
A piece of pie?

593
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:52,038
I'm not hungry.

594
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:54,879
Was ist los mit dem? Was ist?

595
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:59,869
I wanted to build it myself.

596
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,356
Those people help you and all is well.

597
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:07,871
I don't want any help.
I wanted to build it myself.

598
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,992
That way it would be built
slowly and carefully.

599
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:14,715
So now it's fast and it's ready the sooner.

600
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:16,796
The Archbishop...

601
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:22,711
If he is busy, he will not come
but I think we should invite him.

602
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:25,513
Look...

603
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:30,872
You see, all my life,
I wanted to really build something.

604
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:37,913
Maybe if I had had an education I would
have been an architect or an engineer -

605
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:42,431
throw the Golden Gate Bridge
across San Francisco Bay.

606
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:45,950
And even maybe
build a rocket ship to Venus.

607
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:53,715
I'm not getting through to you.

608
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:58,994
Well, the chapel is being built
and that's all that matters.

609
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:03,399
I wanted to build it myself.

610
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:08,869
God is building out there the chapel

611
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:12,788
and you sit here feeling sorry for yourself
because you are not Him?

612
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:17,233
Ah.

613
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:31,190
He did not finish den Kaffee.

614
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:46,195
You build the walls too high.

615
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:51,190
Die Mauern. Die Mauern... zu hoch.

616
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:56,189
Der Balken - nicht dort, da anfangen.
Verstehen Sie mich?

617
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:58,470
Necesitamos para el marco de la ventana.

618
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:00,955
Es ist ja ganz egal, was Sie sagen.

619
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:05,551
Es ist kein Platz für den Beichtstuhl
und das Weihwasser vorgesehen.

620
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:10,470
Mother Maria, no comprende
sus instrucionnes.

621
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:12,636
Das ist nicht richtig. Verstehen Sie?

622
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:19,597
Aber das ist nicht richtig.
Verstehen Sie?

623
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:28,273
Deswegen hat die Mutter Maria gesagt,
wir müssen...

624
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:43,469
Ah, Francesco.
Der Wanden is for support. The wall.

625
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:47,350
Madre mia! What am I doing here?

626
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:53,112
Amigo!

627
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:02,792
Everybody. Everybody! Everybody!

628
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:05,434
It is wrong... was ihr macht.

629
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:09,713
Eine Kirche is for Beten. Beten.

630
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:14,391
Look, you promised them a chapel,
now they will have nothing. Nada.

631
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:17,318
...with practically application.

632
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:21,115
So... Oh, do not stop now.

633
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:24,998
OK, OK. I thought you was loco.

634
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:27,998
I was wrong. You was right.

635
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:33,556
See, I have the big humility, amigo.
How about you?

636
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:39,875
The walls are high too much.

637
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:43,915
The padre was right.

638
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:48,431
You quit, they go home,
the walls fall down,

639
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:50,755
the rain, she melts the bricks,

640
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:54,031
the wind, she blows away the dust.

641
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:57,391
They will be back
getting their spiritual comfort

642
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:00,080
from the back end of a pie wagon.

643
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:04,079
Come!
Please come back like it was.

644
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:08,910
Everyone working together
and laughing and singing!

645
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:11,395
And that's the way how it should be!

646
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:16,749
Hold it!

647
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:18,836
Everything is cockeyed.

648
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:22,111
That beam - Mario, Pedro -
it belongs there.

649
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:26,313
Here's the way it goes. That beam
sits on a joist and it supports the roof.

650
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:28,874
- You got it?
- Sí.

651
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,389
And the walls are not high enough.

652
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:35,559
- Jesus, we need more adobe all around.
- Sí, señor.

653
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:37,750
- Some boss, eh?
- Sí.

654
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:39,871
A job needs a boss
who knows what he's doing.

655
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,037
I'm no boss, but I just know
how I want my chapel built.

656
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:47,233
Felipe, once we get that beam in place,
we're gonna pitch the roof, yeah?

657
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:50,750
- Like this. You follow?
- El boss!

658
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:58,436
All right. Vamanos.
Let's get this show on the road.

659
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:01,836
Let's go. Girls, these men
are gonna need food - lots of it.

660
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:05,589
So start squeezing that cow
and buttering up those sandwiches.

661
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:07,995
More adobe in here! Let's go!

662
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:10,076
You too, Mama. Macht schnell!

663
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:12,156
A Hitler.

664
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:53,633
Adobe.

665
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:56,513
This was made for ten thousand years.

666
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:59,029
- Feel good!
- Ja!

667
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:01,435
- Boss wants more adobe.
- Ja.

668
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:03,516
Where is the boss?

669
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:25,397
Hey, put another man on this beam!
Miguel!

670
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:28,239
I need you topside to tie off this truss.

671
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:35,159
Easy does it. Hold it there.

672
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:37,236
Hold it there.

673
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:42,512
Oh, hello... Get up there and tie off
that side. He'll be up in a second.

674
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:45,996
- I heard about this in town.
- Yeah, you did?

675
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:50,476
- Juan, think the barbecue's ready?
- Oh, sí. Sí, señor.

676
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:53,672
- Let them tie off this, then call lunch.
- OK, boss.

677
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:55,756
Some boss!

678
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:58,872
Muchachos! Lunch! Lunch!

679
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:02,756
Lunch! Lunch!

680
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:15,958
Say, where'd you get all the materials?

681
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:19,152
- The people give them, señor.
- What for?

682
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:21,430
A man he gives wood, bricks.

683
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:23,994
This time, what does he get? A chapel.

684
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:27,112
A place where his children
can receive the sacraments.

685
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:29,959
For their children to have faith,
it is important.

686
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:34,119
- Is that why you're here?
- To me, it is insurance.

687
01:14:34,240 --> 01:14:39,109
To me, life is here on this earth. I cannot
see further so I cannot believe further.

688
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:44,519
But if they are right about the hereafter,
I have paid my insurance, señor.

689
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:47,155
Hey, boss!

690
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:58,354
- Is there something I can do for you?
- Well, I'm kind of short-handed.

691
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:00,436
Getting good labour is always a problem.

692
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:02,710
Oh, really?

693
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:05,070
Er, I've got a new freeway deal.

694
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:08,680
Sorry, Mr Ashton,
but I've got a church contract.

695
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:11,951
Well, when you're finished,
I could use a foreman, Mr Smith.

696
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:20,153
Thanks, Mr Ashton. But when
I'm finished here, I'll be moving on.

697
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:22,032
- But thanks.
- Señor Homer?

698
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:27,032
Oh.

699
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:32,709
Well, we're gonna have to find
a very special place to put that!

700
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:34,796
Thank you. Thank you.

701
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:39,794
You'd better take this to Mother Maria.

702
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:44,716
Everybody wants to give.

703
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:51,628
Hey, mister. Mister.

704
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:54,479
Today we raise the roof.
We have fiesta. You come?

705
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:57,319
Oh. No. No, thanks.

706
01:15:57,440 --> 01:16:00,238
I've got something I have to do,
but thanks.

707
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:02,112
De nada. Adios.

708
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:25,951
"Und Gott war das Wort... "

709
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:06,792
Dieser verrückte Schmidt
und seine verrückten Freunde.

710
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:09,388
Perdónelos, madre,
que todos son unos borrachos.

711
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:12,637
They build a house, a barn,
there's always a fiesta.

712
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:15,718
Fiesta! In my chapel!

713
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:25,074
Gringo man!

714
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:29,870
Gringo! I don't know
if that's a step up or a step down

715
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,719
from somethin' else
I've been called all my life!

716
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:51,115
- Well, you are awake?
- I guess so.

717
01:17:51,240 --> 01:17:52,673
Good.

718
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:57,152
Why'd you do that?

719
01:17:57,280 --> 01:18:00,238
The women last night
say that is the only thing

720
01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:03,830
when a man has been mixing wine
with tequila.

721
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:06,394
I'm gonna mix you... With tequila!

722
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:23,359
Por favor, shut that thing off!

723
01:18:23,480 --> 01:18:26,950
Morning! I've brought
something over for your chapel.

724
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:31,037
They're seconds but I figured
you could use them somewhere.

725
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:34,470
- They were taking up space at the yard.
- What do you think?

726
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:37,751
We could crush 'em.
Use them for gravel for the wall.

727
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:42,795
But those are worth... I mean...
Well, they've been fired good and strong.

728
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:47,513
- Thanks.
- Mr Ashton!

729
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:49,392
Mr Ashton!

730
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:55,118
I should have sent those bricks over
anonymously.

731
01:18:55,240 --> 01:19:01,031
He's very generous - he sees we're
building with adobe, he gives us bricks.

732
01:19:01,160 --> 01:19:04,118
They're very expensive.
I wonder what made him do it.

733
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:06,708
- Insurance.
- What?

734
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:08,592
Forget it.

735
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:14,395
Mr Ashton, we need bricks,
we need lumber,

736
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:18,149
we need shingles and plenty of cement.

737
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:20,794
Because we will build a school
and a hospital.

738
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:24,879
And we need beams please, Mr Ashton.
Do you understand?

739
01:19:30,160 --> 01:19:32,116
Hey, Smith.

740
01:19:39,480 --> 01:19:43,712
You and getting everybody involved.
You've been making a lot of mischief.

741
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:45,910
- What's the matter?
- She's really after me.

742
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:50,079
- But the chapel's almost finished.
- Oh, no. She's just beginning.

743
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:52,509
Next she'll want a school, then a hospital

744
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:54,790
and only God knows - and she -
what comes next.

745
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:59,835
Only so much is deductible.
She's gonna be on my back from now on!

746
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:01,916
That sweet old lady?

747
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:14,714
- Señor Boss, can I help you?
- No, gracias. This part is mine.

748
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:16,796
This part is mine.

749
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:22,388
Señor Smith? Will it have bells?

750
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:24,476
Sure. Some day.

751
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:28,233
So...

752
01:22:30,240 --> 01:22:31,832
So.

753
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:34,269
Tomorrow, the first masses.

754
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,991
See...

755
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:40,350
Seat in the front. You.

756
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:42,675
Where all the people can see you.

757
01:22:44,360 --> 01:22:47,830
And every one of these bricks
over the door I put in myself.

758
01:22:59,960 --> 01:23:04,431
A real church for you to say the mass.
Es verdad, padre?

759
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:28,957
There is so much to do. So much to do.

760
01:23:30,120 --> 01:23:33,715
Tomorrow from Northfolk
the town choir is coming.

761
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:39,312
The boys and girls. Such beautiful voices
you never have heard.

762
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:41,271
Forgive me.

763
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:45,472
They will stand over there
and up there flowers.

764
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:49,798
On both sides of the altar, flowers.
Nothing but flowers.

765
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:52,480
I have much to do. Much to do.

766
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:57,913
Many years ago, I made
a very vain and selfish prayer.

767
01:23:58,760 --> 01:24:03,436
Now He has answered my prayer
through you, through many people.

768
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:09,638
I... I pray now I become worthy
of His trust and yours.

769
01:24:11,320 --> 01:24:15,029
I have so much to do. So much to do.

770
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:44,355
# Ave Maris Stella

771
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:49,191
# Dei Mater alma

772
01:24:49,320 --> 01:24:55,509
# Atque semper virgo

773
01:24:55,640 --> 01:24:59,838
# Felix coeli porta

774
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:04,988
# Amen

775
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:11,193
Do you feel all right?

776
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:17,680
- Tonight you not smile, Herr Schmidt.
- Come on, smile.

777
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:20,837
This is like the first night you come, ja?

778
01:25:21,480 --> 01:25:23,948
- Schmidt!
- Nothing's changed.

779
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:26,433
Schmidt.

780
01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:31,756
You did not fasten the pews to the floor...

781
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:34,235
It's done.

782
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:37,557
You must oil the doors
so they will not squeak in the mass.

783
01:25:37,680 --> 01:25:39,875
It's done.

784
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:44,118
- But the rail of the altar you did not fix.
- Everything is done.

785
01:25:58,160 --> 01:26:01,197
- Ja?
- Ja.

786
01:26:05,640 --> 01:26:08,438
Then it is all finished.

787
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:14,034
It's all finished.
I done builded you a "shapel".

788
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:18,878
You built me a... cha-pel.

789
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:21,949
Correction. S-ank you.

790
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:27,200
Correction. Th-ank you...

791
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:33,348
That's very nice.

792
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:41,398
Well, it's English lesson time.

793
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:46,909
- I built a chapel.
- I built a chapel.

794
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:50,350
- You built a chapel.
- You built a chapel.

795
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:54,234
- Oh, we built a chapel.
- We built a chapel.

796
01:26:54,360 --> 01:26:57,397
He built the chapel.

797
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,638
Amen!

798
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:00,988
Amen.
