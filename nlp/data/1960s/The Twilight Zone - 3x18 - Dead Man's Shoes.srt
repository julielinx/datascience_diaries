00:00:10,777 --> 00:00:13,279
You're traveling
through another dimension-

2
00:00:13,314 --> 00:00:16,399
a dimension not only of sight
and sound, but of mind,

3
00:00:16,434 --> 00:00:18,284
a journey into a wondrous land

4
00:00:18,319 --> 00:00:20,153
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

5
00:00:20,188 --> 00:00:23,907
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

6
00:00:51,434 --> 00:00:53,937
Okay, dump him.

7
00:03:51,282 --> 00:03:55,368
Nathan edward bledsoe,
of the bowery bledsoes,

8
00:03:55,403 --> 00:03:57,870
a man once, a specter now,

9
00:03:57,905 --> 00:04:01,007
one of those myriad,
modern-day ghosts that haunt

10
00:04:01,042 --> 00:04:03,509
the reeking nights of this city

11
00:04:03,544 --> 00:04:06,629
in search of a flop, a handout,
a glass of forgetfulness.

12
00:04:07,263 --> 00:04:10,383
Nate doesn't know it,
but his search is about to end

13
00:04:10,418 --> 00:04:13,519
because those shiny new shoes
are going to carry him

14
00:04:13,554 --> 00:04:17,273
right into the capital
of the twilight zone.

15
00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:54,894
Hey, nate.

16
00:04:54,929 --> 00:04:57,397
Yeah, what do you want?

17
00:04:57,432 --> 00:04:58,648
Nothin'.

18
00:04:58,683 --> 00:05:00,516
Just wondered
where you was going.

19
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:03,653
You, uh,
make a little strike, nate?

20
00:05:03,688 --> 00:05:04,904
Nah.

21
00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:07,407
So what's the hurry?

22
00:05:07,442 --> 00:05:08,658
I don't know.

23
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:12,412
Don't try to kid me, nate-
you're after a jug.

24
00:05:12,447 --> 00:05:14,914
Sam. What has come of you?

25
00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:16,165
I see the whole thing

26
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,034
is clearly a case
of assault and battery.

27
00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:19,285
Oh, what are you
talking about?

28
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,170
I just asked him where he was...

29
00:05:21,205 --> 00:05:23,039
i will gladly testify for you
in a court case.

30
00:05:23,074 --> 00:05:24,290
Eh, forget it.

31
00:05:24,325 --> 00:05:25,541
He didn't mean nothing.

32
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:28,044
Spoken like a true gentleman.

33
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:30,546
There, you see? Aren't
you ashamed of yourself

34
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:31,798
to think that a
man of such honor

35
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,683
would refuse to
share his windfall

36
00:05:33,718 --> 00:05:34,934
with his old comrades.

37
00:05:34,969 --> 00:05:36,803
I don't know
what you're talking about.

38
00:05:36,838 --> 00:05:38,054
Nathan, nathan,
nathan, please,

39
00:05:38,688 --> 00:05:40,556
don't destroy the image
that i have created.

40
00:05:40,591 --> 00:05:43,059
It's quite obvious that
you're on to something.

41
00:05:43,094 --> 00:05:44,944
We couldn't mistake
your steadfast walk,

42
00:05:44,979 --> 00:05:47,447
your sense of well-being.

43
00:05:47,482 --> 00:05:50,566
And your new shoes.

44
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:51,818
They're...

45
00:05:51,853 --> 00:05:54,320
a bit expensive,
aren't they?

46
00:05:54,355 --> 00:05:56,823
I found 'em in a alley.

47
00:05:56,858 --> 00:05:58,708
Yes. It looks to me

48
00:05:58,743 --> 00:06:00,576
like, uh, british
workmanship,

49
00:06:00,611 --> 00:06:03,713
but aren't they just,
uh, a little bit snug?

50
00:06:03,748 --> 00:06:06,215
They do feel a little funny.

51
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,467
Yes, well, i
would be glad...

52
00:06:07,502 --> 00:06:09,969
ah, but they fit okay.

53
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:36,996
Uh, nathan,
when you found the footgear,

54
00:06:37,031 --> 00:06:40,116
did you also,
by the remotest chance, find...?

55
00:06:40,151 --> 00:06:42,618
Just the shoes.

56
00:06:43,252 --> 00:06:47,006
Now where are
you headed, pal?

57
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:51,377
Take your hand off me.

58
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:13,459
Dane?
I'm glad you're back, honey.

59
00:08:13,494 --> 00:08:14,710
I keep losing.

60
00:08:17,213 --> 00:08:19,098
Well, what have you got...?

61
00:08:19,715 --> 00:08:22,852
Who are you?

62
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:25,972
What do you want?

63
00:08:26,007 --> 00:08:28,474
Look, you better
get out of here.

64
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:43,489
That's dane's bottle.

65
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:47,627
Mm-hmm, that's why
i'm drinking it.

66
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:51,497
You know, if he comes back
and finds you here,

67
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:53,382
he'll kill you.

68
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:58,387
Mister, don't you hear me?

69
00:08:58,422 --> 00:08:59,755
He'll kill you.

70
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:04,393
Wilma...

71
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:10,650
you'll never
make it downstairs.

72
00:09:10,685 --> 00:09:12,768
Fix me a drink.

73
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,608
Bernie? Wilma.

74
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:45,111
Is dane there?

75
00:10:45,146 --> 00:10:48,864
Oh, well look, if he comes
back, will you tell him that...

76
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:52,001
would you tell him
that i need him right away?

77
00:10:52,036 --> 00:10:53,869
I'm at the apartment.

78
00:10:53,904 --> 00:10:55,755
Okay.

79
00:11:49,558 --> 00:11:52,061
All right, mister,
where's dane?

80
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:53,929
Dane?

81
00:11:54,563 --> 00:11:57,066
I don't understand, lady.

82
00:11:57,101 --> 00:11:58,317
Oh, yes, you do.

83
00:11:58,352 --> 00:12:00,186
You've got his shoes,
and no one else

84
00:12:00,221 --> 00:12:02,688
wears shoes
like dane's.

85
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:03,939
Oh, the shoes.

86
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:05,825
I found the shoes.

87
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,076
You mean, you stole them.

88
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:11,197
Yeah, that's right,
lady, i stole them.

89
00:12:11,232 --> 00:12:13,699
Where?

90
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:16,202
I don't... i don't
understand...

91
00:12:16,237 --> 00:12:16,836
at the club?

92
00:12:16,871 --> 00:12:18,087
The what?

93
00:12:18,122 --> 00:12:21,207
Well, what was
he doing there?

94
00:12:21,242 --> 00:12:23,092
I don't know,
lady, honest.

95
00:12:23,127 --> 00:12:25,594
Well, whatdo
you know, mister?

96
00:12:25,629 --> 00:12:26,846
Nothing.

97
00:12:26,881 --> 00:12:29,348
I don't know
nothing, lady, i...

98
00:12:30,599 --> 00:12:32,468
you know, i ought
to kill you-

99
00:12:32,503 --> 00:12:35,354
busting in here
like you own the place.

100
00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:37,223
Lady, please, don't do that.

101
00:12:37,258 --> 00:12:40,359
Please don't do that,
please don't do that!

102
00:12:40,394 --> 00:12:42,611
Put on the shoes
and get out of here.

103
00:12:42,646 --> 00:12:44,480
Yeah.

104
00:12:44,515 --> 00:12:46,982
Yes, lady, i'll go.

105
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:26,906
I thought i told you
to mix me a drink.

106
00:13:26,941 --> 00:13:29,408
Oh, look, mister...

107
00:13:29,443 --> 00:13:32,528
do i have to
break your arm?

108
00:13:32,563 --> 00:13:34,413
No.

109
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:14,453
How about that drink?

110
00:14:23,212 --> 00:14:25,080
Well, what'll it be?

111
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:26,966
What'll it be?

112
00:14:27,001 --> 00:14:28,217
What do
ialwayshave?

113
00:14:28,252 --> 00:14:30,719
I don't know what
you always have, mister,

114
00:14:30,754 --> 00:14:32,588
i really don't.

115
00:14:32,623 --> 00:14:35,090
Try tequila...

116
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:38,477
...with a cube of sugar.

117
00:14:49,104 --> 00:14:52,241
Do you want to tell me
who you really are?

118
00:14:52,276 --> 00:14:54,743
You tell me.

119
00:14:54,778 --> 00:14:57,613
You know,
dane's coming back,

120
00:14:57,648 --> 00:15:00,115
and if you knew what
was good for you...

121
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,618
oh, i, uh, know
what's good for me.

122
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,372
You.

123
00:15:06,407 --> 00:15:07,006
Don't touch me.

124
00:15:07,623 --> 00:15:08,874
Don't touch me,
don't...

125
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:15,764
now, who am i, baby?

126
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:17,633
Dane.

127
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:22,638
No, you're not.

128
00:15:22,673 --> 00:15:23,889
You're not, you're not!

129
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:25,774
What have you
done with him?

130
00:15:25,809 --> 00:15:28,777
And what have you done with him?

131
00:15:28,812 --> 00:15:30,646
What have you done with him?

132
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:41,907
Now, look, i have
some unfinished business.

133
00:15:45,661 --> 00:15:49,415
But you be here
when i get back.

134
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:37,680
I love that rhythm.

135
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:41,433
Yes, sir, what
will it be?

136
00:16:41,468 --> 00:16:43,936
Tequila with a cube of sugar.

137
00:16:47,189 --> 00:16:49,692
Yes, sir.

138
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:04,206
Friend of yours?

139
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:07,326
Jimmy, that fellow
at the bar-

140
00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:09,211
you know him?

141
00:17:09,246 --> 00:17:10,462
Negative.

142
00:17:10,497 --> 00:17:13,465
Ben, what about you?

143
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,085
I've never seen him before, why?

144
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,721
Well, he seems to know us.

145
00:17:22,091 --> 00:17:25,844
You like to live
dangerously, do you?

146
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:27,096
Am i?

147
00:17:27,131 --> 00:17:30,232
If you keep on
staring at this woman.

148
00:17:30,267 --> 00:17:33,352
It's not the woman
i'm staring at.

149
00:17:34,103 --> 00:17:35,988
Look-

150
00:17:36,023 --> 00:17:37,856
you're driving me crazy.

151
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:40,993
Why don't you
get rid of the guy?

152
00:17:41,028 --> 00:17:43,495
Or invite him over,
dosomething!

153
00:17:49,118 --> 00:17:52,254
Ben, get him over here.

154
00:17:57,876 --> 00:17:59,128
Hey.

155
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:04,767
Mr. Dagget would like
to see you over there.

156
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:08,520
At his own
personal table.

157
00:18:08,555 --> 00:18:12,274
I don't know
what to say.

158
00:18:12,309 --> 00:18:16,028
Don't say anything,
just do it.

159
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:19,782
All right, i accept.

160
00:18:20,649 --> 00:18:23,152
Hey, sweetheart,
sit over there.

161
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:28,791
Hello, bernie.

162
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:30,042
You know me?

163
00:18:30,659 --> 00:18:33,162
Oh, by reputation.

164
00:18:33,197 --> 00:18:35,664
Oh...
oh, i get it.

165
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:40,052
Tequila with
a lump of sugar, huh?

166
00:18:40,087 --> 00:18:40,669
Mmm.

167
00:18:40,704 --> 00:18:43,172
That's kind of
a funny coincidence.

168
00:18:43,207 --> 00:18:45,057
How's that?

169
00:18:45,092 --> 00:18:48,927
Well, i, uh... i had a good
friend who drank the same stuff.

170
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:50,813
Oh?

171
00:18:50,848 --> 00:18:53,315
What's
your name?

172
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:53,932
Kilroy.

173
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:56,568
Look, buddy, when
mr. Dagget asks...

174
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:00,322
what's your business,
mr. Kilroy?

175
00:19:00,357 --> 00:19:04,693
Well, you might say, uh,
i'm kind of a messenger.

176
00:19:04,728 --> 00:19:06,578
I've got a message for you,

177
00:19:06,613 --> 00:19:08,197
bernie.

178
00:19:08,232 --> 00:19:10,699
Well, let's have it.

179
00:19:10,734 --> 00:19:13,202
No, i, uh, was given
instructions

180
00:19:13,237 --> 00:19:15,704
to deliver
this message privately.

181
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:18,841
Well, it's a touchy matter,
you know how it is.

182
00:19:18,876 --> 00:19:20,709
Oh.

183
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,212
Who's it from?

184
00:19:23,247 --> 00:19:24,463
Afraid i can't say.

185
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:28,851
It's a nice place.

186
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:30,719
Real nice.

187
00:19:30,754 --> 00:19:33,856
The, um... the fellow
that gave you this message,

188
00:19:33,891 --> 00:19:35,724
what did he look like?

189
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:38,861
Uh, bernie, my business
is forgetting, not remembering.

190
00:19:38,896 --> 00:19:40,112
Mm-hmm.

191
00:19:40,147 --> 00:19:44,483
All right, messenger, let's go.

192
00:19:45,984 --> 00:19:49,738
Oh, no,
this has got to be private.

193
00:19:49,773 --> 00:19:51,623
It will be.

194
00:20:02,885 --> 00:20:04,136
This is my office.

195
00:20:04,171 --> 00:20:06,638
You can't get
any more private than this.

196
00:20:06,673 --> 00:20:08,507
Even the walls
are soundproof.

197
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:09,758
Take it easy.

198
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:14,763
Happy easter.

199
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:16,648
You still got
a message for me?

200
00:20:16,683 --> 00:20:20,402
Oh, yes, but, uh, tell
the easter bunny here

201
00:20:20,437 --> 00:20:22,905
i'd like my gun
back afterwards.

202
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:25,407
Mm-hmm.

203
00:20:25,442 --> 00:20:26,658
All right, boys.

204
00:20:29,778 --> 00:20:31,029
Sit down.

205
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:32,281
Make yourself
comfortable.

206
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:35,417
Well, well, well.

207
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:41,039
How did you get it
cleaned so fast, bernie?

208
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,293
What?

209
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:46,795
The rug.

210
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:49,047
I understand
blood's very hard

211
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:50,933
to get out,
isn't it?

212
00:20:50,968 --> 00:20:53,435
I don't know what
you're talking about.

213
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:55,938
I'll tell you what
i'll do, bernie.

214
00:20:55,973 --> 00:20:58,807
I'll tell you
what i'm talking about.

215
00:20:58,842 --> 00:21:00,692
I'm talking about a guy

216
00:21:00,727 --> 00:21:04,446
who had a pretty nice thing
going for him.

217
00:21:04,481 --> 00:21:06,949
Plenty of dough,
plenty of action.

218
00:21:06,984 --> 00:21:10,702
Only he wasn't happy
because he had a partner.

219
00:21:10,737 --> 00:21:14,206
That meant he couldn't
be number one.

220
00:21:14,241 --> 00:21:15,457
Being number one

221
00:21:15,492 --> 00:21:17,960
was very
important to him.

222
00:21:17,995 --> 00:21:21,830
So he offered
to buy the partner out.

223
00:21:21,865 --> 00:21:27,469
When the partner refused
to sell, he killed him...

224
00:21:27,504 --> 00:21:29,338
right there.

225
00:21:29,373 --> 00:21:31,840
You know, you'd never know.

226
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:34,343
It was
a slick job.

227
00:21:34,378 --> 00:21:35,594
Who are you?

228
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,848
Oh, i told you.

229
00:21:40,482 --> 00:21:41,733
I'm a messenger.

230
00:21:41,768 --> 00:21:44,236
And, uh,
here's the message.

231
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:50,993
You didn't think that'd
work twice, did you?

232
00:22:03,372 --> 00:22:07,125
I'll be back, bernie...

233
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,011
and i'll keep coming back

234
00:22:09,046 --> 00:22:12,631
again and again

235
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:16,268
and i'll get you.

236
00:22:16,303 --> 00:22:19,388
So help me, i'll get you.

237
00:22:24,526 --> 00:22:26,395
Who is he?

238
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:28,280
It's d...

239
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:32,651
i don't know.

240
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,198
Oh, my dear nathan,

241
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:23,952
you really are smashed,
aren't you?

242
00:23:36,465 --> 00:23:38,350
Very careless of you.

243
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:45,857
As for these, we'll discuss them
at some future date.

244
00:23:45,892 --> 00:23:49,611
There's an old saying that goes,
"if the shoe fits, wear it,"

245
00:23:49,646 --> 00:23:51,480
but be careful.

246
00:23:51,515 --> 00:23:55,233
If you happen to find a pair of
size nine black and gray loafers

247
00:23:55,268 --> 00:23:57,736
made to order in the old
country, be very careful.

248
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:02,124
You might walk right into
the twilight zone.

249
00:24:07,045 --> 00:24:09,498
Rod serling,
creator ofthe twilight zone,

250
00:24:09,533 --> 00:24:12,000
will tell you
about next week's story

251
00:24:12,035 --> 00:24:14,970
after this message.

252
00:24:15,005 --> 00:24:17,139
And now, mr. Serling.

253
00:24:17,174 --> 00:24:19,641
Perhaps no character
in or out of fiction

254
00:24:19,676 --> 00:24:21,510
has had as much notoriety
or publicity

255
00:24:21,545 --> 00:24:23,395
as the so-called grim reaper.

256
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:25,263
Next week onthe twilight zone,

257
00:24:25,298 --> 00:24:27,766
through the good offices
of mr. Earl hamner,

258
00:24:27,801 --> 00:24:30,902
we present a unique story
called "the hunt."

259
00:24:30,937 --> 00:24:34,022
It concerns the demise
of an old hunter and his dog.

260
00:24:34,057 --> 00:24:37,159
And this one we rather urgently
recommend to people

261
00:24:37,194 --> 00:24:39,027
who have lost
their senses of humor

262
00:24:39,062 --> 00:24:42,781
and who'd like to recover same.

263
00:24:42,816 --> 00:24:44,032
As one of my kids says,

264
00:24:44,067 --> 00:24:47,169
there's a trillion, trillion
ways of telling a story.

265
00:24:47,204 --> 00:24:49,671
But there's really only one way
to tell a chesterfield story

266
00:24:49,706 --> 00:24:50,922
and that's simply to say

267
00:24:50,957 --> 00:24:53,425
that great tobaccos
make a wonderful smoke.

268
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,293
Try chesterfields.
They satisfy.

269
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,992
This is james arness.

270
00:25:27,027 --> 00:25:28,877
You know, it's only a short hop

271
00:25:28,912 --> 00:25:31,379
fromthe twilight zone
to dodge city ingunsmoke.

272
00:25:31,414 --> 00:25:33,882
Saturday nights
over most of these stations.
