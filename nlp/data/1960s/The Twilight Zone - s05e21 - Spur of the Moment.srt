1
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,694
You unlock this door
with the key of imagination.

2
00:00:10,729 --> 00:00:12,696
Beyond it is another dimension-

3
00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:14,064
a dimension of sound,

4
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,067
a dimension of sight,

5
00:00:17,102 --> 00:00:19,319
a dimension of mind.

6
00:00:19,354 --> 00:00:22,072
You're moving into a land
of both shadow and substance,

7
00:00:22,107 --> 00:00:23,573
of things and ideas.

8
00:00:23,608 --> 00:00:27,327
You've just crossed over
into the twilight zone.

9
00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:36,836
It may be said
with a degree of assurance

10
00:00:36,871 --> 00:00:40,590
that not everything that
meets the eye is as it appears.

11
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:43,093
The scene you're watching.

12
00:00:43,128 --> 00:00:46,596
This is not a hospital,
not a morgue, not a mausoleum,

13
00:00:46,631 --> 00:00:50,100
not an undertakers' parlor
of the future.

14
00:00:50,135 --> 00:00:52,736
What it is is the belly
of a spaceship.

15
00:00:52,771 --> 00:00:55,488
It is en route to another
planetary system

16
00:00:55,523 --> 00:00:57,991
an incredible distance
from the earth.

17
00:00:58,026 --> 00:01:01,494
This is the crux of our story,
a flight into space.

18
00:01:01,529 --> 00:01:02,746
It is also the story

19
00:01:02,781 --> 00:01:05,498
of the things that might
happen to human beings

20
00:01:05,533 --> 00:01:07,250
who take a step beyond,

21
00:01:07,285 --> 00:01:11,004
unable to anticipate everything
that might await them out there.

22
00:01:18,762 --> 00:01:20,513
I remember things.

23
00:01:20,548 --> 00:01:24,517
It's more than just void,
darkness, unconsciousness.

24
00:01:24,552 --> 00:01:26,019
The mind does work.

25
00:01:26,054 --> 00:01:29,773
There are images, patterns,
things to recollect.

26
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:32,142
It's not just the long,
deep sleep

27
00:01:32,177 --> 00:01:34,394
that comes
when the fear has left.

28
00:01:34,429 --> 00:01:36,146
The cold is felt,

29
00:01:36,181 --> 00:01:40,150
the slipping away of feeling
is noted and then succumbed to.

30
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,152
The mind functions.

31
00:01:42,187 --> 00:01:47,157
Time is distorted, jumbled,
telescoped, accordioned,

32
00:01:47,192 --> 00:01:50,410
but there is
a sense of time even so,

33
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,162
and i remember things.

34
00:01:52,197 --> 00:01:54,164
I remember the way it began.

35
00:01:54,199 --> 00:01:57,417
I remember the way it was
in the beginning.

36
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:03,923
Come in, commander stansfield.

37
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:05,675
Dr. Bixler.

38
00:02:08,178 --> 00:02:09,429
Please be
comfortable.

39
00:02:09,464 --> 00:02:11,931
The figure of
speech, commander.

40
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:13,683
Be comfortable
in the sense

41
00:02:13,718 --> 00:02:16,186
that there's no need
to stand on ceremony.

42
00:02:16,221 --> 00:02:18,188
But there are
no seats, either.

43
00:02:18,223 --> 00:02:19,939
I've heard much of you, doctor.

44
00:02:19,974 --> 00:02:22,692
I of you, and that's
the reason you're here.

45
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:28,448
You've been an astronaut
for 11 years.

46
00:02:28,483 --> 00:02:29,699
Is that a question, sir?

47
00:02:29,734 --> 00:02:31,201
It's an
observation.

48
00:02:31,236 --> 00:02:33,953
Should you not have realized it,
you've been the object

49
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:36,706
of considerable observation
for the past several months.

50
00:02:36,741 --> 00:02:38,708
I've been aware of some, doctor.

51
00:02:38,743 --> 00:02:41,711
When the space agency
put me on my project,

52
00:02:41,746 --> 00:02:43,463
they told me
to keep in mind

53
00:02:43,498 --> 00:02:44,964
the scientific
problems

54
00:02:45,215 --> 00:02:47,967
but also to be aware
of the human factor.

55
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:50,220
You, commander
stansfield,

56
00:02:50,255 --> 00:02:52,222
are the human factor.

57
00:02:52,257 --> 00:02:53,223
Go on, doctor.

58
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,733
You recognize this,
don't you?

59
00:03:03,768 --> 00:03:05,235
This is our
solar system.

60
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:06,236
This is the sun

61
00:03:06,271 --> 00:03:07,487
and here is
the earth,

62
00:03:07,737 --> 00:03:09,489
jupiter, venus,
pluto, mars.

63
00:03:09,524 --> 00:03:10,490
And what do we know

64
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,492
about our neighbors, commander?

65
00:03:12,527 --> 00:03:14,494
Mars is a vast, scrubby desert

66
00:03:14,529 --> 00:03:16,496
with an unbreatheable
atmosphere.

67
00:03:16,531 --> 00:03:19,499
Pluto is poisonous
and extremely cold.

68
00:03:19,534 --> 00:03:22,252
The moon is barren,
jupiter, volcanic.

69
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:23,753
In short, commander,

70
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:27,507
our neighbors offer us only
they're accessible.

71
00:03:27,542 --> 00:03:29,008
They're
within reach.

72
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:31,511
Beyond that, they
offer us nothing-

73
00:03:31,761 --> 00:03:35,899
scientific, social,
economic- anything.

74
00:03:35,934 --> 00:03:38,902
They're the mount
everest of space.

75
00:03:38,937 --> 00:03:41,404
Once, they offered us
challenges.

76
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:44,524
Where is the next
mount everest, doctor?

77
00:03:44,559 --> 00:03:47,527
That's perhaps
the most pertinent question

78
00:03:47,562 --> 00:03:48,778
you've ever asked.

79
00:03:48,813 --> 00:03:50,780
This is
a planetary system

80
00:03:50,815 --> 00:03:52,031
to date seen only

81
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:54,284
through the lens
of a telescope.

82
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,785
We know nothing
of it

83
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,037
except for there
are six bodies

84
00:03:58,288 --> 00:04:01,291
one of which we
can only assume
is the sun.

85
00:04:01,326 --> 00:04:03,042
It's flaming
and gaseous

86
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:05,545
and it must provide
heat and light

87
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,547
for these five
bodies here.

88
00:04:07,582 --> 00:04:09,549
It's a small system
like our own.

89
00:04:09,584 --> 00:04:10,550
The planets run

90
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,552
roughly in the same
orbital pattern

91
00:04:12,587 --> 00:04:14,304
as we do around
our own sun.

92
00:04:14,339 --> 00:04:15,555
Does it have a name?

93
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:16,806
You may call it

94
00:04:16,841 --> 00:04:19,058
stansfield's
mount everest.

95
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:20,810
That's where i'm going.

96
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:23,813
When?

97
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:25,565
In about
six months.

98
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,317
The ship's being
built now.

99
00:04:27,352 --> 00:04:29,319
It's off
the drawing board.

100
00:04:29,354 --> 00:04:30,820
The keel is being laid

101
00:04:30,855 --> 00:04:32,822
but it'll take
only one man,

102
00:04:32,857 --> 00:04:35,325
and that man should
be right there

103
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,827
watching every
rivet, every bolt,

104
00:04:37,862 --> 00:04:39,329
every item
of equipment

105
00:04:39,364 --> 00:04:40,580
going in there.

106
00:04:40,615 --> 00:04:43,082
You are that man, commander.

107
00:04:43,117 --> 00:04:45,218
You will be
sole occupant

108
00:04:45,253 --> 00:04:47,470
and you will be
its pilot.

109
00:04:47,505 --> 00:04:49,722
Doctor, i...

110
00:04:49,757 --> 00:04:52,475
i like this assignment
very much.

111
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:54,978
That's precisely
why you were chosen.

112
00:04:55,013 --> 00:04:56,479
Of course,
there will be

113
00:04:56,514 --> 00:04:58,982
the usual dangers,
the usual unknowns.

114
00:04:59,017 --> 00:05:02,485
In the past, you've had
meteor showers to contend with.

115
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,487
You've had
the usual calculated risk

116
00:05:04,522 --> 00:05:07,490
of mechanical difficulties,
landing difficulties,

117
00:05:07,525 --> 00:05:09,742
ejection troubles
and the rest of it.

118
00:05:09,777 --> 00:05:12,245
Well, you'll still
have those-

119
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,997
compounded.

120
00:05:14,032 --> 00:05:17,750
We have another factor here.

121
00:05:17,785 --> 00:05:20,003
Another problem.

122
00:05:20,038 --> 00:05:21,004
The distance.

123
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,005
Distance.

124
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,506
This system is perhaps

125
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:25,758
141 light years
away from us.

126
00:05:25,793 --> 00:05:28,761
That's a rough estimate
but a good one.

127
00:05:28,796 --> 00:05:29,762
The ship is...

128
00:05:29,797 --> 00:05:32,515
the ship will have
interstellar drive

129
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:34,517
and an antigravity
device.

130
00:05:34,552 --> 00:05:37,020
It'll be the fastest
man-made object

131
00:05:37,055 --> 00:05:39,522
ever conceived,
ever brought to life.

132
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:41,274
It'll go
70 times faster

133
00:05:41,524 --> 00:05:43,276
than the speed
of light.

134
00:05:43,311 --> 00:05:45,278
But in terms
of the space

135
00:05:45,528 --> 00:05:46,779
you must conquer,

136
00:05:46,814 --> 00:05:48,781
it'll be like an ant

137
00:05:48,816 --> 00:05:51,034
crawling across
the sahara.

138
00:05:51,069 --> 00:05:53,036
In short, commander,

139
00:05:53,071 --> 00:05:56,289
your trip to these
planetary bodies

140
00:05:56,324 --> 00:05:57,790
and back to earth

141
00:05:58,041 --> 00:06:01,544
will take
approximately
40 years.

142
00:06:04,547 --> 00:06:07,300
Commander douglas stansfield,
astronaut,

143
00:06:07,335 --> 00:06:11,304
a man about to embark on one
of history's longest journeys-

144
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:15,425
40 years out into endless space
and hopefully back again.

145
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,926
This is the beginning,

146
00:06:16,961 --> 00:06:20,179
the first step toward man's
longest leap into the unknown.

147
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:22,682
Science has solved
the mechanical details,

148
00:06:22,717 --> 00:06:24,684
and now it's up to
one human being

149
00:06:24,934 --> 00:06:27,437
to breathe life into blueprints
and computers,

150
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:31,190
to prove once and for all that
man can live half a lifetime

151
00:06:31,441 --> 00:06:33,192
in the total void
of outer space,

152
00:06:33,443 --> 00:06:35,194
40 years alone in the unknown.

153
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:36,696
This is earth.

154
00:06:36,731 --> 00:06:38,948
Ahead lies a planetary system.

155
00:06:38,983 --> 00:06:42,702
The vast region in between
is the twilight zone.

156
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:01,704
That was the beginning,

157
00:07:01,739 --> 00:07:06,075
that brief, unemotional,
very matter-of-fact colloquy

158
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:09,579
between the scientist
and the practitioner-

159
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:12,582
a small cast of two characters.

160
00:07:12,617 --> 00:07:16,335
And that was the way
it should have been.

161
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:20,089
But i remember...
i very clearly remember

162
00:07:20,124 --> 00:07:23,843
the entrance
of character number three.

163
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:31,734
Will communications team b-8,

164
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:34,987
communications team b-8
report to central control.

165
00:07:35,022 --> 00:07:39,742
Communications team b-8,
central control.

166
00:07:49,252 --> 00:07:50,503
Oh, a friend in need.

167
00:07:50,538 --> 00:07:51,754
Oh, that's my job.

168
00:07:51,789 --> 00:07:53,005
Picking up papers?

169
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,507
I'm the new
morale officer.

170
00:07:54,542 --> 00:07:57,009
I follow people around
who look stricken.

171
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,761
Oh, and do i look
stricken?

172
00:07:58,796 --> 00:08:01,264
Well, you looked
momentarily nonplussed.

173
00:08:01,299 --> 00:08:02,765
I don't believe we've met.

174
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,517
Are you permanently
stationed here?

175
00:08:04,552 --> 00:08:06,519
I'm with the space agency.

176
00:08:06,554 --> 00:08:07,520
And you're...?

177
00:08:07,555 --> 00:08:08,771
Stansfield.

178
00:08:08,806 --> 00:08:10,273
Commander, u.s.n.

179
00:08:11,274 --> 00:08:12,775
Oh...

180
00:08:14,277 --> 00:08:15,278
you're the one.

181
00:08:15,313 --> 00:08:16,529
Should i thank you

182
00:08:16,564 --> 00:08:18,531
or report you
for insubordination?

183
00:08:18,566 --> 00:08:21,284
I've always wanted to meet you.

184
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:23,786
I've always wanted
to meet you, too.

185
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:26,038
No, that's true.

186
00:08:26,073 --> 00:08:27,540
I have e.s.p.
And i, uh...

187
00:08:27,575 --> 00:08:30,042
a long time ago
i woke up one morning

188
00:08:30,077 --> 00:08:31,794
and some inner voice told me

189
00:08:31,829 --> 00:08:34,797
that i would meet a girl
with a stricken look

190
00:08:34,832 --> 00:08:37,049
who would drop papers
in corridors.

191
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:41,554
And did your e.s.p.
Tell you the name?

192
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:43,556
Mm-hmm, sandra horn.

193
00:08:46,809 --> 00:08:48,427
Oh...

194
00:08:48,678 --> 00:08:50,930
subtle astronaut.

195
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:54,433
It's been an honor
meeting you.

196
00:09:03,326 --> 00:09:05,328
I, um...

197
00:09:05,363 --> 00:09:07,330
i don't suppose
the space agency

198
00:09:07,365 --> 00:09:09,081
could do without
your services

199
00:09:09,116 --> 00:09:11,083
for a couple of
hours this evening,

200
00:09:11,118 --> 00:09:12,835
just long enough
for dinner.

201
00:09:18,841 --> 00:09:23,596
Well... despite the fact
that i am invaluable

202
00:09:23,846 --> 00:09:27,099
and that the whole
space program

203
00:09:27,134 --> 00:09:29,101
rests on me alone,

204
00:09:29,136 --> 00:09:31,604
i think a two- or
three-hour period

205
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:33,105
could be carved out.

206
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,858
I'm in the book, commander.

207
00:09:35,893 --> 00:09:37,109
Please phone.

208
00:09:37,144 --> 00:09:38,611
No, i won't call-
i'll pick you up.

209
00:09:38,646 --> 00:09:39,862
I'll be there at 8:00.

210
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:43,482
Arrivederci, lady
from the space agency.

211
00:09:43,517 --> 00:09:46,986
At 8:00, astronaut.

212
00:09:47,021 --> 00:09:49,238
Arrivederci.

213
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:58,130
You are 31 years old,
commander.

214
00:09:58,165 --> 00:10:00,383
When you return from this trip,

215
00:10:00,418 --> 00:10:03,636
the earth will have aged
almost half a century.

216
00:10:03,671 --> 00:10:05,755
That's something
to contemplate.

217
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,256
I'll be over
70 years old.

218
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:08,507
I will have lived

219
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:10,259
the better part
of my life

220
00:10:10,294 --> 00:10:11,761
out in space
and alone.

221
00:10:11,796 --> 00:10:14,013
You will have lived
the better part of it,

222
00:10:14,048 --> 00:10:15,514
but you will not have aged.

223
00:10:15,549 --> 00:10:17,266
We intend to try something new,

224
00:10:17,301 --> 00:10:18,401
also a risk,

225
00:10:18,436 --> 00:10:20,903
also decidedly
calculated.

226
00:10:20,938 --> 00:10:22,154
Freezing?

227
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:23,406
An extension of that

228
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:25,274
but much more
complicated.

229
00:10:25,309 --> 00:10:27,276
It'll be a suspended
animation

230
00:10:27,311 --> 00:10:28,778
in its purest form.

231
00:10:28,813 --> 00:10:30,529
We've developed
a substance

232
00:10:30,564 --> 00:10:33,783
from the lymphoid tissue
of hibernating animals

233
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:36,035
plus several
vitamin absorbents

234
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:37,536
and a collection
of drugs.

235
00:10:37,787 --> 00:10:39,922
The earth will have
aged, commander,

236
00:10:39,957 --> 00:10:41,173
but you will not.

237
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:43,926
You'll be only
a few weeks older

238
00:10:43,961 --> 00:10:45,428
when you return.

239
00:10:45,463 --> 00:10:48,681
Sort of like dying
and coming to life again.

240
00:10:48,716 --> 00:10:49,682
After a fashion.

241
00:10:49,717 --> 00:10:51,434
But coming
to life again

242
00:10:51,469 --> 00:10:52,685
in the sense that

243
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,937
there'll be very
few people here

244
00:10:54,972 --> 00:10:57,690
that you will know
or who will know you.

245
00:10:57,725 --> 00:10:59,942
Life will have
changed, commander.

246
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:02,194
You'll have to
begin living it

247
00:11:02,229 --> 00:11:03,946
all over again
as a stranger,

248
00:11:03,981 --> 00:11:06,198
as a... well,
as an anachronism,

249
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:07,450
if you will.

250
00:11:07,485 --> 00:11:08,951
All right, doctor.

251
00:11:08,986 --> 00:11:10,453
When do i begin?

252
00:11:10,488 --> 00:11:11,954
You have begun.

253
00:11:11,989 --> 00:11:12,955
As of this moment

254
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:14,707
you are very much
committed, commander.

255
00:11:14,742 --> 00:11:16,075
I'm on the payroll,
doctor,

256
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,576
and i just checked in.

257
00:11:26,836 --> 00:11:28,838
Something?

258
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,092
A month from now

259
00:11:33,127 --> 00:11:35,594
you'll be off
to space.

260
00:11:36,846 --> 00:11:40,349
And by the time you
come back down again...

261
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:46,105
you want to talk
about that now?

262
00:11:48,491 --> 00:11:52,495
Only for the following
absurd reason.

263
00:11:54,497 --> 00:11:58,000
I've known you for exactly
three and a half hours-

264
00:11:58,035 --> 00:12:00,753
that's what
it's been

265
00:12:00,788 --> 00:12:03,506
three and
a half hours-

266
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:07,009
a long dinner...

267
00:12:07,044 --> 00:12:10,012
and a short dance.

268
00:12:10,047 --> 00:12:13,015
And already...

269
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:14,767
already...

270
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:17,770
already what, sandy?

271
00:12:19,522 --> 00:12:22,024
Already...

272
00:12:22,059 --> 00:12:26,028
i feel a sense of... loss.

273
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:34,403
My life had been space.

274
00:12:34,438 --> 00:12:37,406
It had been missions,
projects and expeditions.

275
00:12:37,441 --> 00:12:39,909
There had been no time
for intrusions

276
00:12:39,944 --> 00:12:42,161
that took the form
of a woman's face,

277
00:12:42,196 --> 00:12:46,665
a voice, a short month of a man
and a woman drawing together,

278
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,168
becoming a part of one another,

279
00:12:49,203 --> 00:12:50,669
reaching tentatively

280
00:12:50,704 --> 00:12:54,423
into that strange
and mysterious pond of love

281
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:58,677
and then watching the ripples
that came from it.

282
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:03,432
But now i think
of these things,

283
00:13:03,467 --> 00:13:06,185
now they come to mind,
now in the darkness,

284
00:13:06,435 --> 00:13:09,188
in the cold, the solitude,

285
00:13:09,223 --> 00:13:12,942
the... stillness,
the loneliness.

286
00:13:12,977 --> 00:13:16,946
Now there comes
a feeling of warmth.

287
00:13:16,981 --> 00:13:22,952
Sandy... where are you now,
sandy, across the void?

288
00:13:22,987 --> 00:13:25,204
My dear sandy,

289
00:13:25,239 --> 00:13:30,709
through the millions of miles
of cold, empty space,

290
00:13:30,744 --> 00:13:35,714
through the vastness of
a naked desert of sky and stars,

291
00:13:35,749 --> 00:13:37,967
i love you.

292
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:43,472
I love you, sandy.

293
00:13:56,785 --> 00:13:58,787
Minus 2-30.

294
00:14:15,671 --> 00:14:17,923
Small, unofficial gesture

295
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:21,176
from one of
the lesser bureaucrats

296
00:14:21,211 --> 00:14:26,932
of our good,
respectable government.

297
00:14:36,692 --> 00:14:44,199
Unofficial... and very much
apart from protocol.

298
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:52,207
But i couldn't
let you leave, doug,

299
00:14:52,242 --> 00:14:55,210
not without
saying good-bye.

300
00:14:55,245 --> 00:14:58,964
Not without tell you i...

301
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:02,468
i loved you very much.

302
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:07,473
And i shall
sorely miss you.

303
00:15:07,508 --> 00:15:11,226
And that my life-

304
00:15:11,261 --> 00:15:15,981
whatever there is
left of it-

305
00:15:16,016 --> 00:15:21,236
shall be a strangely
meaningless, dull and...

306
00:15:21,271 --> 00:15:25,991
empty thing
without you to share it.

307
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:30,996
It's a very odd
thing, sandy,

308
00:15:31,031 --> 00:15:32,998
when i get back,
when i...

309
00:15:33,248 --> 00:15:34,249
touch this earth again,

310
00:15:34,284 --> 00:15:36,001
i know the first
thought i'll have,

311
00:15:36,036 --> 00:15:40,005
i know... the first thing
that i'll want to see,

312
00:15:40,255 --> 00:15:45,511
i know... the first...

313
00:15:45,761 --> 00:15:48,514
thing that i'll
want to touch.

314
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:54,903
I'll be the...

315
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:59,408
little old lady
in the lace shawl.

316
00:15:59,443 --> 00:16:06,415
The one waving
the "welcome home" sign.

317
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:08,283
So look for me.

318
00:16:08,318 --> 00:16:10,285
Will you, doug?

319
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:23,549
...two, one, zero.

320
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:28,554
One, two, three, four and five.

321
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:49,825
I move now,
i streak across the sky,

322
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,577
i leave an earth behind

323
00:16:51,612 --> 00:16:54,079
that changes
beyond my closed eyes.

324
00:16:54,114 --> 00:16:56,582
From a warm place
of leaves and trees

325
00:16:56,832 --> 00:16:59,084
to a cold orb
hanging in a dark sky

326
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:04,089
and growing smaller
and smaller and smaller.

327
00:17:04,124 --> 00:17:05,591
And time passes.

328
00:17:05,626 --> 00:17:08,343
It inexorably passes.

329
00:17:08,378 --> 00:17:12,347
And i can do nothing about it.

330
00:17:13,348 --> 00:17:14,233
General walters?

331
00:17:14,268 --> 00:17:15,484
Space contact, sir.

332
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,985
A craft spiraling in.

333
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:19,488
All right,
let's hear the report.

334
00:17:19,523 --> 00:17:21,607
It's expedition called
stansfield's mount everest.

335
00:17:21,857 --> 00:17:23,609
Commanded by douglas stansfield.

336
00:17:23,644 --> 00:17:25,360
The date of departure?

337
00:17:25,395 --> 00:17:27,996
This one's
one of the old jobs, sir.

338
00:17:28,031 --> 00:17:30,249
Departure, december 31, 1987.

339
00:17:30,284 --> 00:17:32,251
"Old" is putting it mildly.

340
00:17:32,286 --> 00:17:35,003
All right, check it out
in your report.

341
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:36,755
Let me know.

342
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:39,508
This one's one of the pioneers.

343
00:17:39,543 --> 00:17:41,009
Been in space 40 years.

344
00:17:41,044 --> 00:17:43,011
First voice communication
we've had.

345
00:17:43,046 --> 00:17:44,513
It's been tracked on radar

346
00:17:44,548 --> 00:17:47,015
but his communications
must have malfunctioned

347
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:49,268
a few hours
after he left the atmosphere.

348
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:53,639
Now, here's a funny one.

349
00:17:53,674 --> 00:17:54,773
How's that, sir?

350
00:17:54,808 --> 00:17:56,642
Well, there's an insertion

351
00:17:56,677 --> 00:17:58,393
from a man named bixler.

352
00:17:58,428 --> 00:18:02,898
He was one of the project people
years and years ago as i recall.

353
00:18:02,933 --> 00:18:06,652
He must have been in charge
of the stansfield mission.

354
00:18:06,687 --> 00:18:12,658
It says we're to contact
a girl name sandra horn.

355
00:18:12,693 --> 00:18:14,409
Who?

356
00:18:14,444 --> 00:18:16,161
A miss sandra horn,

357
00:18:16,196 --> 00:18:18,914
a friend of
commander stansfield.

358
00:18:18,949 --> 00:18:20,666
Where would we find her, sir?

359
00:18:20,701 --> 00:18:21,917
An old lady's home?

360
00:18:23,418 --> 00:18:27,422
No, you'll find her
in a hibernation room.

361
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:32,427
You'll find her a young woman
of 26 years of age.

362
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:36,181
I hope you find her alive.

363
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:51,446
General walters.

364
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:52,698
Miss horn.

365
00:18:52,733 --> 00:18:55,450
You're looking
very well indeed.

366
00:18:55,485 --> 00:18:56,702
You look fine.

367
00:18:56,737 --> 00:18:58,704
Sounds idiotic,
doesn't it

368
00:18:58,739 --> 00:19:03,458
but what do you say to somebody
who's been asleep for 40 years?

369
00:19:03,493 --> 00:19:05,711
I was told commander
stansfield...

370
00:19:05,746 --> 00:19:08,964
yes, his ship landed
six hours ago.

371
00:19:08,999 --> 00:19:10,465
I asked to see you.

372
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,467
What about him?

373
00:19:12,502 --> 00:19:14,469
In good health.

374
00:19:14,504 --> 00:19:17,472
Naturally... very tired.

375
00:19:17,507 --> 00:19:19,224
I want to see him.

376
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:20,726
I must see him.

377
00:19:20,761 --> 00:19:23,478
You shall see him
in just a moment.

378
00:19:23,513 --> 00:19:26,481
I... i had to
speak to you first.

379
00:19:27,482 --> 00:19:31,486
I'll try to make this
as brief as possible.

380
00:19:31,521 --> 00:19:35,240
Commander stansfield suffered
a communications failure.

381
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:36,491
It probably occurred

382
00:19:36,526 --> 00:19:39,745
within the first 12 hours
after his departure.

383
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,997
There was only
sporadic contact made

384
00:19:42,032 --> 00:19:45,000
during the entire flight
both there and back.

385
00:19:45,035 --> 00:19:48,253
He reached the other
solar system.

386
00:19:48,288 --> 00:19:50,005
Yes, he reached it.

387
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:53,508
He landed, he took off,
he returned.

388
00:19:53,543 --> 00:19:55,010
He found no life.

389
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,763
But we found that 20 years ago.

390
00:19:57,798 --> 00:20:02,267
That's one of the ironies
of progress, miss horn.

391
00:20:02,302 --> 00:20:04,519
Could have saved the trip.

392
00:20:04,554 --> 00:20:08,523
Could have saved him...
his anguish

393
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:11,526
his anguish being
the following:

394
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:14,029
Unknown to us here on earth,

395
00:20:14,064 --> 00:20:16,782
to my predecessors
and to theirs,

396
00:20:16,817 --> 00:20:19,785
because of the lack
of communication,

397
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:25,290
commander stansfield arbitrarily
removed himself from hibernation

398
00:20:25,325 --> 00:20:28,043
six months after leaving earth.

399
00:20:29,544 --> 00:20:31,046
He did this
because...

400
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:33,048
i know why.

401
00:20:36,051 --> 00:20:37,803
Oh, god help me.

402
00:20:39,054 --> 00:20:41,306
I know why.

403
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:44,810
Over 40 years, miss horn.

404
00:20:44,845 --> 00:20:48,063
40 years in the cockpit
of a ship.

405
00:20:48,098 --> 00:20:50,565
40 years.

406
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,568
His loneliness must have been...

407
00:20:53,603 --> 00:20:58,073
something brand-new
in the human experience.

408
00:20:58,108 --> 00:20:59,324
I wish to heaven

409
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:02,077
he could have returned
to you just as he left,

410
00:21:02,112 --> 00:21:03,328
but... as it is, he...

411
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:46,254
doug...

412
00:21:48,757 --> 00:21:51,510
you remember me... don't you?

413
00:21:52,761 --> 00:21:54,763
Remember you?

414
00:21:58,767 --> 00:22:01,019
I've spent...

415
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:06,274
i've spent 40 years
remembering you, sandy.

416
00:22:06,309 --> 00:22:10,779
Painting a picture
inside my head.

417
00:22:12,781 --> 00:22:14,783
Listening
to your voice.

418
00:22:14,818 --> 00:22:18,787
Thinking about your touch.

419
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:25,544
I've spent...

420
00:22:25,579 --> 00:22:30,799
40 years surviving
for you, sandy.

421
00:22:30,834 --> 00:22:32,918
Oh, doug...

422
00:22:34,669 --> 00:22:37,172
it can still be that way.

423
00:22:38,673 --> 00:22:42,177
The way you are...

424
00:22:42,212 --> 00:22:43,929
the way i am.

425
00:22:44,179 --> 00:22:47,432
It doesn't make
any difference.

426
00:22:47,467 --> 00:22:50,435
Oh, it makes
a difference, sandy.

427
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:52,437
It's 40 years' difference.

428
00:22:52,472 --> 00:22:54,439
That's too much difference.

429
00:22:54,689 --> 00:23:00,328
You're...
still beautiful.

430
00:23:00,363 --> 00:23:02,831
Very beautiful.

431
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:11,456
No, you go away now, sandy.

432
00:23:14,843 --> 00:23:16,595
Please go, hmm?

433
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:35,614
Stansfield...

434
00:23:35,649 --> 00:23:39,868
you are really
quite an incredible man.

435
00:23:39,903 --> 00:23:43,121
It may be the one distinction
in my entire life

436
00:23:43,156 --> 00:23:44,372
that i knew you...

437
00:23:45,373 --> 00:23:46,875
that i knew
a man

438
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:49,377
who put such
a premium on love.

439
00:23:50,745 --> 00:23:52,747
Truly...

440
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:55,500
truly quite a distinction,
stansfield.

441
00:23:56,251 --> 00:23:57,752
Mmm.

442
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:09,514
Commander douglas stansfield,

443
00:24:09,549 --> 00:24:13,018
one of the forgotten pioneers
of the space age,

444
00:24:13,268 --> 00:24:16,271
he's been pushed aside
by the flow of progress

445
00:24:16,306 --> 00:24:17,772
and the passage of years

446
00:24:17,807 --> 00:24:20,025
and the ferocious travesty
of fate.

447
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:23,528
Tonight's tale
of the ionosphere and irony

448
00:24:23,563 --> 00:24:26,281
delivered from
the twilight zone.

449
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:31,369
And now, mr. Serling.

450
00:24:31,404 --> 00:24:33,371
Next time out on
the twilight zone

451
00:24:33,622 --> 00:24:36,374
an unusual little item
from the pen of jerry mcneely

452
00:24:36,409 --> 00:24:39,377
based on a story by henry slesar
and called, intriguingly enough,

453
00:24:39,412 --> 00:24:42,130
"the self-improvement
of salvadore ross."

454
00:24:42,165 --> 00:24:43,381
This one poses the question,

455
00:24:43,416 --> 00:24:46,384
"if you don't like what you are,
how do you go about changing?"

456
00:24:46,419 --> 00:24:48,637
Don gordon portrays a man
who really goes the route

457
00:24:48,672 --> 00:24:50,138
when it comes
to some basic changing

458
00:24:50,173 --> 00:24:54,392
and the results
are most unexpected.
