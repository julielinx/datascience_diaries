1
00:00:10,226 --> 00:00:12,112
You're traveling
through another dimension-

2
00:00:12,147 --> 00:00:15,231
a dimension not only of sight
and sound, but of mind.

3
00:00:15,266 --> 00:00:16,483
A journey into a wondrous land

4
00:00:16,518 --> 00:00:19,369
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

5
00:00:19,404 --> 00:00:20,620
That's the signpost up ahead.

6
00:00:20,655 --> 00:00:23,373
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

7
00:00:35,385 --> 00:00:36,636
Nurse?

8
00:00:36,671 --> 00:00:39,139
Time for your sleeping medicine,
honey.

9
00:00:41,042 --> 00:00:42,892
Is it night already?

10
00:00:42,927 --> 00:00:45,395
It's 9:30.

11
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:48,515
Oh. What about the day?

12
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:49,766
Oh, what about it?

13
00:00:49,801 --> 00:00:52,268
Well, was it
a beautiful day?

14
00:00:52,303 --> 00:00:53,520
Was it warm?

15
00:00:53,555 --> 00:00:54,771
Was the sun out?

16
00:00:54,806 --> 00:00:56,656
It was kind of warm.

17
00:00:56,691 --> 00:00:57,907
Yes... and clouds?

18
00:00:57,942 --> 00:01:01,027
Were there clouds in the sky?

19
00:01:01,062 --> 00:01:02,278
I suppose
there were.

20
00:01:02,313 --> 00:01:03,530
I never was much

21
00:01:03,565 --> 00:01:05,415
for staring up
at the sky.

22
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:06,032
No?

23
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:08,535
I used to like to
look at the clouds.

24
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:11,037
If you stare at them long
enough, they become things.

25
00:01:11,072 --> 00:01:12,288
You know what i mean?

26
00:01:12,323 --> 00:01:14,791
People, ships,
anything you want, really.

27
00:01:14,826 --> 00:01:17,293
It's time to take
your temperature now.

28
00:01:17,328 --> 00:01:19,796
Oh, please, one
more thing, nurse.

29
00:01:19,831 --> 00:01:20,430
Well?

30
00:01:22,298 --> 00:01:24,801
When will they take
the bandages off?

31
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:29,189
How long, nurse?

32
00:01:29,224 --> 00:01:30,440
Until they decide

33
00:01:30,475 --> 00:01:33,560
whether or not they
can fix your face.

34
00:01:33,595 --> 00:01:37,313
Oh, i guess it's...
pretty bad, isn't it?

35
00:01:37,348 --> 00:01:39,199
I've seen worse.

36
00:01:39,234 --> 00:01:42,952
Well, yes, but... it's
pretty bad, isn't it?

37
00:01:42,987 --> 00:01:46,706
Oh, i know
it's pretty bad.

38
00:01:46,741 --> 00:01:48,575
Ever since
i can remember-

39
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:51,077
ever since i was a little girl-

40
00:01:51,112 --> 00:01:54,831
people have turned away
when they looked at me.

41
00:01:54,866 --> 00:01:57,967
Funny...

42
00:01:58,002 --> 00:02:02,338
the very first thing
i can remember

43
00:02:02,373 --> 00:02:06,726
is another little child
screaming when she looked at me.

44
00:02:06,761 --> 00:02:11,097
I... i never really wanted
to be beautiful, you know.

45
00:02:11,132 --> 00:02:14,851
I mean, i never wanted
to look like a painting.

46
00:02:14,886 --> 00:02:17,353
I never even wanted
to be loved, really.

47
00:02:17,388 --> 00:02:19,856
I just wanted
people not to scream

48
00:02:19,891 --> 00:02:21,741
when they looked at me.

49
00:02:21,776 --> 00:02:22,992
When, nurse? When? When?

50
00:02:23,027 --> 00:02:25,495
When will they take
the bandages off?

51
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:26,746
Maybe tomorrow.

52
00:02:27,363 --> 00:02:29,249
Maybe the next day.

53
00:02:29,284 --> 00:02:31,117
Now hush.

54
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:41,761
You've been waiting so long now.

55
00:02:41,796 --> 00:02:44,264
It doesn't really
make much difference

56
00:02:44,299 --> 00:02:46,766
whether it's two weeks
or days now.

57
00:02:47,517 --> 00:02:48,768
Does it?

58
00:03:01,898 --> 00:03:06,286
Dr. Bernardi, evening
report on patient 307:

59
00:03:06,321 --> 00:03:10,039
No temperature change,
resting comfortably.

60
00:03:10,074 --> 00:03:13,159
Thank you, nurse.
I'll be down later.

61
00:03:15,044 --> 00:03:17,547
Ever see her face- 307?

62
00:03:17,582 --> 00:03:19,415
Indeed i have.

63
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:20,667
If it were mine,

64
00:03:20,702 --> 00:03:23,803
i'd bury myself
in a grave someplace.

65
00:03:23,838 --> 00:03:25,672
Poor thing.

66
00:03:25,707 --> 00:03:29,425
Some people want to
live no matter what.

67
00:03:30,059 --> 00:03:31,311
Cigarette?

68
00:03:42,071 --> 00:03:44,574
Suspended in time and space
for a moment,

69
00:03:44,609 --> 00:03:47,076
your introduction
to miss janet tyler,

70
00:03:47,111 --> 00:03:50,196
who lives in a very private
world of darkness,

71
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:52,081
a universe whose dimensions

72
00:03:52,116 --> 00:03:55,201
are the size, thickness, length
of the swath of bandages

73
00:03:55,236 --> 00:03:57,086
that cover her face.

74
00:03:57,121 --> 00:03:59,589
In a moment, we'll go
back into this room.

75
00:03:59,624 --> 00:04:02,709
And also, in a moment,
we'll look under those bandages,

76
00:04:02,744 --> 00:04:04,594
keeping in mind, of course,

77
00:04:04,629 --> 00:04:07,714
that we're not to be surprised
by what we see

78
00:04:07,749 --> 00:04:09,599
because this isn't
just a hospital,

79
00:04:09,634 --> 00:04:12,719
and this patient 307
is not just a woman.

80
00:04:12,754 --> 00:04:14,604
This happens
to be the twilight zone,

81
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:18,358
and miss janet tyler, with you,
is about to enter it.

82
00:04:22,912 --> 00:04:25,398
Blood pressure and
temperature are normal, doctor.

83
00:04:25,433 --> 00:04:26,649
There's
been no change.

84
00:04:26,684 --> 00:04:28,534
All right. Come back
about 11:00, nurse.

85
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:30,403
Give her
the usual sedative then.

86
00:04:30,438 --> 00:04:31,654
All right,
doctor.

87
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,413
Well, it's warm this
evening, miss tyler.

88
00:04:40,448 --> 00:04:43,549
Yes, i thought it was,
but i couldn't be sure.

89
00:04:44,167 --> 00:04:45,418
Well,
it's very warm.

90
00:04:45,453 --> 00:04:47,303
Take my word
for that.

91
00:04:47,338 --> 00:04:50,423
We'll have those bandages
off you very soon.

92
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:53,559
I expect you're pretty uncomfortable.

93
00:04:53,594 --> 00:04:56,679
Well, i'm used to
bandages on my face.

94
00:04:56,714 --> 00:04:57,930
I have no doubt.

95
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,816
It's your ninth
visit here.

96
00:04:59,851 --> 00:05:01,067
It is the ninth?

97
00:05:01,102 --> 00:05:04,821
The 11th.

98
00:05:04,856 --> 00:05:06,689
You know, sometimes i...

99
00:05:06,724 --> 00:05:10,443
i think i've lived my whole
life inside of a dark cave

100
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:12,328
with walls of gauze,

101
00:05:12,363 --> 00:05:16,082
and the wind that blows
into the mouth of the cave

102
00:05:16,117 --> 00:05:18,584
smells of ether
and disinfectant.

103
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:21,087
Of course there's a...

104
00:05:21,122 --> 00:05:26,709
there's a kind of a comfort
living inside this cave-

105
00:05:26,744 --> 00:05:28,594
wonderfully private.

106
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:31,097
Nobody can ever see you.

107
00:05:31,714 --> 00:05:34,851
It's hopeless,
isn't it, doctor?

108
00:05:34,886 --> 00:05:38,604
I'll never look any
different than now.

109
00:05:39,222 --> 00:05:41,107
Well, that's
hard to say.

110
00:05:41,142 --> 00:05:47,363
Up to now, you haven't responded
to the shots, the medications-

111
00:05:47,398 --> 00:05:50,867
any of the proven techniques.

112
00:05:50,902 --> 00:05:53,369
Frankly, you've stumped us, miss tyler.

113
00:05:53,404 --> 00:05:55,872
Nothing we've done
so far has made

114
00:05:55,907 --> 00:05:57,740
any difference
at all.

115
00:05:57,775 --> 00:05:59,742
However, we're very hopeful

116
00:05:59,777 --> 00:06:04,130
for what this last treatment
may have accomplished.

117
00:06:04,165 --> 00:06:07,884
There's no telling, of course,
till we get the bandages off.

118
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,752
I'm sorry your case is not one

119
00:06:09,787 --> 00:06:12,638
that we could have
handled with plastic surgery,

120
00:06:12,673 --> 00:06:14,507
but your bone
structure,

121
00:06:14,542 --> 00:06:15,758
flesh type...

122
00:06:15,793 --> 00:06:17,643
many factors
prohibit

123
00:06:17,678 --> 00:06:19,512
the surgical
approach.

124
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:23,015
Your 11th visit.

125
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,017
No more after this, doctor.

126
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:26,269
No more tries.

127
00:06:26,304 --> 00:06:29,155
11 is the mandatory number
of experiments.

128
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:31,657
We're not permitted
to do any more after 11.

129
00:06:31,692 --> 00:06:33,025
Now what, doctor?

130
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,912
Well, you're kind of jumping
the gun, aren't you, miss tyler?

131
00:06:35,947 --> 00:06:37,163
You may very well have responded

132
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:38,781
to these last
injections.

133
00:06:38,816 --> 00:06:40,032
There's no
way of telling

134
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:41,284
till we get
the bandages off.

135
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:43,786
And, if i haven't
responded, then what?

136
00:06:43,821 --> 00:06:45,037
Well, there
are alternatives.

137
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:46,923
Like?

138
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:48,174
Don't you know?

139
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:51,294
Yes, i know.

140
00:06:53,796 --> 00:06:56,299
You realize, of
course, miss tyler,

141
00:06:56,334 --> 00:06:58,184
why these rules
are in effect.

142
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:01,938
Each of us
is afforded

143
00:07:01,973 --> 00:07:03,806
as much opportunity
as possible

144
00:07:03,841 --> 00:07:05,691
to fit in
with society.

145
00:07:05,726 --> 00:07:08,194
In your case,
think of the time

146
00:07:08,229 --> 00:07:10,062
and the money
and the effort

147
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:12,565
expended to
make you look...

148
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,067
look like what, doctor?

149
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:17,570
Normal. The way
you'd like to look.

150
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:21,958
Doctor...

151
00:07:23,826 --> 00:07:26,329
doctor...

152
00:07:26,364 --> 00:07:28,831
may i walk outside?

153
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:30,716
Please, may i?

154
00:07:31,334 --> 00:07:34,470
May i just go and...
and sit in the garden?

155
00:07:34,505 --> 00:07:35,721
Just... just
for a little while.

156
00:07:35,756 --> 00:07:38,841
Just...
just to feel the air.

157
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:41,344
Just... just
to smell the flowers.

158
00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:45,731
Just... just
to make believe i am normal?

159
00:07:45,766 --> 00:07:48,851
If... if i sit out there
in the darkness,

160
00:07:48,886 --> 00:07:51,354
then the whole world is dark,

161
00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:55,107
and i'm more a part of it
like that, not just...

162
00:07:55,142 --> 00:08:03,249
one grotesque, ugly woman
with a bandage on her face

163
00:08:03,284 --> 00:08:07,620
with a special darkness
all around.

164
00:08:07,655 --> 00:08:10,122
I want to belong.

165
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:14,510
I want to be like everybody.

166
00:08:14,545 --> 00:08:17,013
Please, doctor.

167
00:08:17,048 --> 00:08:19,515
Please help me.

168
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:28,274
There are
many others

169
00:08:28,309 --> 00:08:31,394
who share
your misfortune-

170
00:08:31,429 --> 00:08:34,530
people who look
much as you do.

171
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:45,157
Now, one of the
alternatives...

172
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:47,043
just in the event

173
00:08:47,078 --> 00:08:48,911
that this
last treatment

174
00:08:49,545 --> 00:08:50,796
is not
successful,

175
00:08:50,831 --> 00:08:52,665
is simply
to allow you

176
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,801
to move into
a special area

177
00:08:56,052 --> 00:08:57,920
in which people
of your kind

178
00:08:57,955 --> 00:09:00,423
have been
congregated.

179
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:04,427
People of my kind?

180
00:09:07,598 --> 00:09:10,683
Congregated.

181
00:09:10,718 --> 00:09:13,185
Oh, you mean segregated!

182
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,688
You mean imprisoned,
don't you, doctor?

183
00:09:15,723 --> 00:09:18,824
You're talking about
a ghetto, aren't you?

184
00:09:18,859 --> 00:09:20,693
A ghetto designed for freaks!

185
00:09:20,728 --> 00:09:22,578
Miss tyler!

186
00:09:22,613 --> 00:09:25,081
Now, the state is
not unsympathetic.

187
00:09:25,116 --> 00:09:26,949
Your presence here
in this hospital

188
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:28,200
is proof of that.

189
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:30,086
It's doing all
it can for you.

190
00:09:30,121 --> 00:09:33,205
But you're not being rational, miss tyler.

191
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,091
Now, you know
you can't expect

192
00:09:35,126 --> 00:09:37,593
to live any kind
of a life among...

193
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:40,713
normal people.

194
00:09:40,748 --> 00:09:41,964
I could try.

195
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:43,849
I...

196
00:09:43,884 --> 00:09:46,969
i could wear a mask
or this bandage or...

197
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:48,854
i wouldn't bother anybody.

198
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:50,106
I'd just go my own way.

199
00:09:50,141 --> 00:09:51,974
I'd get a job. Any job!

200
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:54,477
I...

201
00:09:54,512 --> 00:09:55,728
who are you people anyway?

202
00:09:55,763 --> 00:09:57,613
What is this state?

203
00:09:58,981 --> 00:10:02,118
Who makes all these rules
and conditions and statutes:

204
00:10:02,153 --> 00:10:05,237
The people who are different
have to stay away

205
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:06,489
from the people who are normal.

206
00:10:06,524 --> 00:10:08,374
The state isn't god, doctor.

207
00:10:08,409 --> 00:10:10,242
Miss tyler,
please, please.

208
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:11,494
The state is not god!

209
00:10:12,128 --> 00:10:14,630
It hasn't the right
to penalize somebody

210
00:10:14,665 --> 00:10:16,499
for an accident of birth!

211
00:10:16,534 --> 00:10:19,635
It hasn't the right to make
ugliness a crime!

212
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:22,138
Miss tyler! Miss tyler,
stop this immediately.

213
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:26,509
I feel the night
out there.

214
00:10:27,143 --> 00:10:27,760
I feel the air.

215
00:10:27,795 --> 00:10:29,645
I can smell the flowers.

216
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,514
Oh...

217
00:10:31,549 --> 00:10:33,399
oh, please.

218
00:10:33,434 --> 00:10:37,770
Please, take this
off me, please.

219
00:10:37,805 --> 00:10:42,775
Please, take this off me.

220
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:45,911
Oh, please, take this off me!

221
00:10:46,529 --> 00:10:50,282
Take it off me!

222
00:10:52,168 --> 00:10:54,036
Help! Somebody, help me!

223
00:10:55,671 --> 00:10:56,288
Help!

224
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:57,540
No, no, no.

225
00:10:57,575 --> 00:10:58,174
Let me go.

226
00:10:58,209 --> 00:10:59,425
Please, let me go.

227
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,676
Let me go, please.

228
00:11:00,711 --> 00:11:01,927
Oh, please.

229
00:11:01,962 --> 00:11:03,179
Please, let me go.

230
00:11:03,214 --> 00:11:04,430
Please, please, let me...

231
00:11:10,686 --> 00:11:11,303
all right, then.

232
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:13,189
I will take
the bandages off.

233
00:11:13,224 --> 00:11:14,440
Get the anesthetist.

234
00:11:14,475 --> 00:11:15,691
Yes, doctor.

235
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:34,076
You look tired,
doctor.

236
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:37,830
Do i? Well, i hadn't
thought about it.

237
00:11:37,865 --> 00:11:39,081
I suppose i am.

238
00:11:39,116 --> 00:11:41,584
You've been under a great deal of tension.

239
00:11:41,619 --> 00:11:43,469
I know how much
it means to you-

240
00:11:43,504 --> 00:11:46,589
this case in 307.

241
00:11:46,624 --> 00:11:49,091
Well, you try to be
impersonal about these things.

242
00:11:49,126 --> 00:11:50,976
You do everything
medically possible,

243
00:11:51,011 --> 00:11:52,845
everything
humanly possible

244
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,347
and then, in the end,
you cross your fingers

245
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:57,850
and you hope
for a miracle.

246
00:11:57,885 --> 00:11:59,101
You know, once in a while,

247
00:11:59,735 --> 00:12:02,238
a miracle does happen
just often enough

248
00:12:02,273 --> 00:12:04,106
to let you know
that you're not wrong

249
00:12:04,141 --> 00:12:05,991
or foolish
to hope for one.

250
00:12:06,026 --> 00:12:09,745
But you're destroying
yourself this way.

251
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:12,248
Forgive me, but you mustn't

252
00:12:12,283 --> 00:12:16,619
let yourself get
personally involved here.

253
00:12:16,654 --> 00:12:19,755
I know. You think
i haven't told myself that?

254
00:12:21,624 --> 00:12:22,875
But you see, nurse,

255
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:25,377
i've... i've looked
underneath those bandages.

256
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:27,263
So have i.
It's horrible.

257
00:12:27,298 --> 00:12:29,765
No, i mean deeper
than that.

258
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:34,136
Deeper than that pitiful,
twisted lump of flesh-

259
00:12:34,171 --> 00:12:38,524
deeper even than that
misshapen skeletal mask.

260
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:42,278
I've seen that woman's
real face, nurse-

261
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:46,649
the face of her real self.

262
00:12:46,684 --> 00:12:47,900
It's a good face.

263
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,403
It's a human face.

264
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:53,289
I understand,

265
00:12:53,324 --> 00:12:55,157
but i must confess,

266
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:58,911
it's easier for me to
think of her as human

267
00:12:58,946 --> 00:13:01,413
when her face
is covered up.

268
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:03,299
But why?

269
00:13:03,334 --> 00:13:06,418
Why must we feel
that way, nurse?

270
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:08,921
What is the dimensional
difference

271
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:11,423
between beauty and
something repellant?

272
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,309
Is it skin deep?

273
00:13:13,344 --> 00:13:15,177
Oh, less than that.

274
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:19,565
Why, nurse?

275
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,685
Why shouldn't people be
allowed to be different?

276
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,936
Why?

277
00:13:23,971 --> 00:13:25,187
Doctor, careful.

278
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:26,438
What you're talking is...

279
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:28,324
treason.

280
00:13:28,359 --> 00:13:32,077
Oh, this case has
upset your balance-

281
00:13:32,112 --> 00:13:33,946
your sense of values.

282
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:37,082
Well, i suppose.

283
00:13:37,117 --> 00:13:38,334
Don't be concerned,
nurse.

284
00:13:38,369 --> 00:13:41,453
I'll be all right once
the bandages are off.

285
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,339
Once iknowone way
or the other.

286
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:45,841
Leader's
speaking tonight.

287
00:13:45,876 --> 00:13:48,344
He goes on in
just a few minutes.

288
00:13:56,468 --> 00:14:00,606
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
our leader.

289
00:14:00,641 --> 00:14:04,360
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

290
00:14:04,395 --> 00:14:09,982
Tonight, i shall talk to you
about glorious conformity.

291
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:12,484
About the delight
and the ultimate pleasure

292
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:15,621
of our unified society.

293
00:14:15,656 --> 00:14:18,123
Now, i have to ask you
once again, miss tyler.

294
00:14:18,158 --> 00:14:19,992
And i must insist
that you promise

295
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:21,243
you'll
remain rational,

296
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:25,381
no tantrums, no
temperament, and no violence.

297
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:26,632
You understand?

298
00:14:26,667 --> 00:14:29,134
Now, i'll tell
you precisely

299
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:31,003
what i'm going to do.

300
00:14:31,038 --> 00:14:32,254
I'm going to
cut the bandages

301
00:14:32,289 --> 00:14:33,505
a section at a time,

302
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,008
then i'm going to unwrap
the bandages very gradually.

303
00:14:36,043 --> 00:14:37,393
The process
has to be slow,

304
00:14:37,428 --> 00:14:40,512
so that your eyes can become
accustomed to the light.

305
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:41,897
As you know,
these injections

306
00:14:41,932 --> 00:14:43,766
may have had some
effect on your vision.

307
00:14:43,801 --> 00:14:45,017
I understand.

308
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:50,656
So now, as i unwrap, i want
you to keep your eyes open,

309
00:14:50,691 --> 00:14:52,524
and i want you to
describe to me

310
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:55,661
the various shadings of
light as you perceive it.

311
00:14:55,696 --> 00:14:57,529
All right.

312
00:14:57,564 --> 00:15:00,032
Now, if you make
any movement,

313
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:01,917
or if you start getting
emotional on us, miss tyler,

314
00:15:01,952 --> 00:15:03,786
i'm going to have to have
the nurses hold you down,

315
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:05,287
and have the
anesthetist

316
00:15:05,322 --> 00:15:07,790
put you under sedation,
you understand.

317
00:15:07,825 --> 00:15:09,675
I promise i won't.

318
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:11,543
All right, then.

319
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:33,699
Do you see any light
now, miss tyler?

320
00:15:33,734 --> 00:15:36,201
Oh, just a little.

321
00:15:36,236 --> 00:15:38,070
It looks gray.

322
00:15:38,105 --> 00:15:39,955
All right, now.

323
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:41,824
Just be very quiet.

324
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:53,719
Now,
miss tyler?

325
00:15:53,754 --> 00:15:56,839
Oh, it... it's much brighter.

326
00:15:56,874 --> 00:15:57,473
Good, good.

327
00:15:57,508 --> 00:15:58,724
Look- look up
toward the light.

328
00:16:00,476 --> 00:16:02,344
How about now,
miss tyler?

329
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:07,483
Oh, yes, it...
it's very bright.

330
00:16:07,518 --> 00:16:08,734
Good, good.

331
00:16:08,769 --> 00:16:10,602
Now...

332
00:16:35,511 --> 00:16:38,630
i'm at the last layer
of bandages, miss tyler.

333
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:40,015
Oh...

334
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:42,267
i, i can just see you.

335
00:16:42,302 --> 00:16:44,770
I can just distinguish
your outline vaguely,

336
00:16:45,387 --> 00:16:46,638
but i can just see you.

337
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:47,890
Good.

338
00:16:47,925 --> 00:16:48,640
All right,
miss tyler,

339
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:50,526
i'm going
to remove

340
00:16:50,561 --> 00:16:52,394
the last of the
bandages now.

341
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:55,531
Would you
like a mirror?

342
00:16:55,566 --> 00:16:57,399
No.

343
00:16:57,434 --> 00:16:59,284
No, thank you.
No mirror.

344
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:00,536
All right, then.

345
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:02,538
I want you

346
00:17:02,573 --> 00:17:05,657
to remember
this, please.

347
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:07,543
Miss tyler, are
you listening?

348
00:17:07,578 --> 00:17:10,662
Yes, i'm listening.

349
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:14,416
Now, we have done
all we could do.

350
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:15,667
If we've been
successful,

351
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:16,919
well and good.

352
00:17:16,954 --> 00:17:18,804
There are
no problems.

353
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:20,672
But if,
on the other hand,

354
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:21,924
this final treatment

355
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:25,060
has not achieved
the desired result,

356
00:17:25,095 --> 00:17:26,311
please remember,
miss tyler,

357
00:17:26,929 --> 00:17:30,065
that you can still live
a long and fruitful life

358
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,568
among people of...
your own kind.

359
00:17:32,935 --> 00:17:35,437
Now, as soon as we
discover the results,

360
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:37,940
we'll either
release you or...

361
00:17:37,975 --> 00:17:39,825
doctor?

362
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:42,945
Yes?

363
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:46,698
If i'm still terribly ugly...

364
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:48,584
well, is there
any other alternative?

365
00:17:48,619 --> 00:17:51,086
Could i please be put away?

366
00:17:52,372 --> 00:17:54,206
Well, under certain
circumstances, miss tyler,

367
00:17:54,241 --> 00:17:55,457
the state does
provide for

368
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:57,342
the extermination
of undesirables.

369
00:17:57,377 --> 00:17:57,960
However, there
are many factors

370
00:17:57,995 --> 00:18:01,096
to be considered
in the decision.

371
00:18:01,131 --> 00:18:03,599
Under the present
circumstances, i...

372
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:06,101
i doubt very much whether
we would be permitted

373
00:18:06,136 --> 00:18:09,221
to do anything
but... transfer you

374
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:11,106
to a communal
group of people

375
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:14,860
with your disability.

376
00:18:14,895 --> 00:18:16,728
They'll make me go, then?

377
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:19,231
That would probably
be the case.

378
00:18:21,116 --> 00:18:24,236
Now, remain
very quiet.

379
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:27,372
Keep your
eyes open.

380
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:30,492
All right,
miss tyler...

381
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:33,629
here comes
the last of it.

382
00:18:33,664 --> 00:18:37,382
I wish you
every good luck.

383
00:18:57,688 --> 00:18:59,521
No change.

384
00:18:59,556 --> 00:19:00,772
No change at all.

385
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:12,534
I was afraid
of this.

386
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:13,785
Turn on the light.

387
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,042
Needle, please.

388
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:35,057
Life at the...

389
00:19:35,092 --> 00:19:36,308
stop that patient!

390
00:19:36,343 --> 00:19:37,559
Stop her!

391
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:43,448
We know now that there must be
a single purpose,

392
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:45,951
a single norm,
a single approach,

393
00:19:45,986 --> 00:19:49,071
a single entity of people,
a single virtue,

394
00:19:49,106 --> 00:19:52,574
a single morality,

395
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:53,959
a single frame of reference,

396
00:19:53,994 --> 00:19:56,078
a single philosophy
of government.

397
00:19:56,113 --> 00:19:58,463
We must cut out
all that is different

398
00:19:58,498 --> 00:20:02,084
like a cancerous filth!

399
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:03,969
It is essential,
in this society,

400
00:20:04,004 --> 00:20:05,587
that we not only have a norm

401
00:20:05,622 --> 00:20:09,091
but that we conform
to that norm!

402
00:20:09,126 --> 00:20:11,727
Differences weaken us!

403
00:20:11,762 --> 00:20:14,846
Variations destroy us!

404
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:20,235
...this norm is what
has ended nations

405
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:22,738
and brought them
to their knees!

406
00:20:22,773 --> 00:20:27,109
Conformity, we must worship
in all interests!

407
00:20:27,144 --> 00:20:30,862
Conformity is
the key to survival!

408
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:40,872
Miss tyler.

409
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:44,009
Miss tyler,
don't be afraid.

410
00:20:44,044 --> 00:20:45,877
He's... he's only
a representative

411
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:47,763
from the group you're
going to live with.

412
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,265
Oddly enough, you've
come right to him.

413
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,134
Now, come on now.

414
00:20:52,169 --> 00:20:54,019
Don't be afraid.

415
00:20:54,054 --> 00:20:55,887
He's not going
to hurt you.

416
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:57,139
He won't hurt you.

417
00:20:57,174 --> 00:20:58,390
Don't be afraid.

418
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:02,144
It's all right.

419
00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:05,897
It's all right, miss tyler.

420
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:07,783
Now, this is mr. Smith.

421
00:21:07,818 --> 00:21:10,285
Mr. Walter smith.

422
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,154
Mr. Smith is in charge

423
00:21:12,189 --> 00:21:14,656
of the village group
in the north.

424
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:16,541
He'll take you
there tonight.

425
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,912
It's the only way now.

426
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:29,054
Miss tyler, we have

427
00:21:29,089 --> 00:21:32,174
a lovely village
and wonderful people.

428
00:21:32,209 --> 00:21:33,425
I think you're
going to like it

429
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,927
where i'm
going to take you.

430
00:21:35,962 --> 00:21:40,932
You'll, uh... you'll
be with your own kind,

431
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:43,435
and in a little while-

432
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:47,189
oh, you'll be amazed
how little a while-

433
00:21:47,224 --> 00:21:51,576
you'll feel a sense
of great belonging.

434
00:21:52,194 --> 00:21:56,581
You'll feel a sense
of being loved...

435
00:21:56,616 --> 00:21:59,084
and you will be loved,
miss tyler.

436
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,711
Miss tyler...

437
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:13,348
...would you get
your things now?

438
00:22:13,383 --> 00:22:16,468
We can leave
anytime.

439
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:18,353
Mr. Smith?

440
00:22:18,388 --> 00:22:20,222
Yes?

441
00:22:20,257 --> 00:22:23,975
Why do we have
to look like this?

442
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:29,481
I don't know, miss tyler;
i really don't know.

443
00:22:29,516 --> 00:22:32,617
But you know something?
It doesn't matter.

444
00:22:32,652 --> 00:22:38,240
There's an old saying...
a very, very old saying:

445
00:22:38,275 --> 00:22:43,245
"Beauty is in the eye
of the beholder."

446
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,130
When we leave here,
when we go to the village,

447
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:46,748
try to think of that,
miss tyler.

448
00:22:46,783 --> 00:22:50,502
Say it over and over
to yourself.

449
00:22:50,537 --> 00:22:54,890
Beauty is in the eye
of the beholder.

450
00:22:58,894 --> 00:23:00,145
Come on now.

451
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:03,265
We'll get your things
and we'll leave.

452
00:23:22,784 --> 00:23:24,669
Good-bye, miss tyler.

453
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:36,681
Now the questions
that come to mind:

454
00:23:36,716 --> 00:23:39,184
Where is this place
and when is it?

455
00:23:39,219 --> 00:23:42,304
What kind of world
where ugliness is the norm

456
00:23:42,339 --> 00:23:44,806
and beauty the deviation
from that norm?

457
00:23:44,841 --> 00:23:46,057
You want an answer?

458
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:49,194
It doesn't make any difference

459
00:23:49,229 --> 00:23:51,696
because the old saying
happens to be true-

460
00:23:52,063 --> 00:23:55,200
beautyis
in the eye of the beholder,

461
00:23:55,235 --> 00:23:57,702
in this year
or a hundred years hence,

462
00:23:57,737 --> 00:24:00,822
on this planet or wherever
there is human life,

463
00:24:00,857 --> 00:24:02,707
perhaps out amongst the stars.

464
00:24:02,742 --> 00:24:05,710
Beauty is
in the eye of the beholder.

465
00:24:05,745 --> 00:24:09,464
Lesson to be learned
in the twilight zone.

466
00:24:14,636 --> 00:24:17,139
Rod serling, the creator
oftwlight zone,

467
00:24:17,174 --> 00:24:19,007
will tell you
about next week's story

468
00:24:19,042 --> 00:24:20,892
after this word
from our alternate sponsor.

469
00:24:22,811 --> 00:24:25,564
And now, mr. Serling.

470
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:27,432
You've probably run across
these penny machines

471
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:29,317
that tell your fortune.

472
00:24:29,352 --> 00:24:32,437
You put a penny in...

473
00:24:32,472 --> 00:24:33,688
and out comes a card.

474
00:24:33,723 --> 00:24:35,574
Only this particular machine,
which you'll see next week,

475
00:24:35,609 --> 00:24:37,442
is a little bit unique,

476
00:24:37,477 --> 00:24:38,693
in that the fortunes
that it tells

477
00:24:38,728 --> 00:24:39,945
happen to come true.

478
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:42,447
A most intriguing tale,
called "the nick of time,"

479
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:44,332
by mr. Richard matheson.

480
00:24:44,367 --> 00:24:46,201
And you're invited
to partake of it.

481
00:24:46,236 --> 00:24:47,452
Thank you and good night.

andy griffith show
