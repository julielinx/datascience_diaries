1
00:00:09,976 --> 00:00:12,479
You're traveling
through another dimension-

2
00:00:12,514 --> 00:00:15,598
a dimension not only of sight
and sound, but of mind,

3
00:00:15,633 --> 00:00:18,101
a journey into a wondrous land

4
00:00:18,136 --> 00:00:20,603
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

5
00:00:20,638 --> 00:00:22,489
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

6
00:00:41,257 --> 00:00:44,377
This object, should any of you
have lived underground

7
00:00:44,412 --> 00:00:45,628
for the better parts
of your lives

8
00:00:45,663 --> 00:00:48,131
and never had occasion
to look toward the sky

9
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:52,519
is an airplane, its official
designation, a dc-3.

10
00:00:52,554 --> 00:00:54,387
We offer this
rather obvious comment

11
00:00:54,422 --> 00:00:56,272
because this particular
airplane,

12
00:00:56,307 --> 00:00:58,024
the one you're looking at,
is a freak.

13
00:00:58,059 --> 00:01:01,778
Now, most airplanes take off
and land as per schedule.

14
00:01:01,813 --> 00:01:04,280
On rare occasions, they crash.

15
00:01:04,315 --> 00:01:08,034
But all airplanes can be counted
on doing one or the other.

16
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:09,903
Now, yesterday morning,

17
00:01:09,938 --> 00:01:13,039
this particular airplane ceased
to be just a commercial carrier.

18
00:01:13,074 --> 00:01:16,159
As of its arrival,
it became an enigma,

19
00:01:16,194 --> 00:01:19,913
a seven-ton puzzle made out
of aluminum, steel, wire

20
00:01:19,948 --> 00:01:21,798
and a few thousand
other component parts

21
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:23,666
none of which add up
to the right thing.

22
00:01:23,701 --> 00:01:24,918
In just a moment,

23
00:01:24,953 --> 00:01:27,420
we're going to show you
the tail end of its history.

24
00:01:27,455 --> 00:01:30,306
We're going to give you
90 percent of the jigsaw pieces

25
00:01:30,341 --> 00:01:33,426
and you and mr. Sheckly here
of the federal aviation agency

26
00:01:33,461 --> 00:01:36,563
will assume the problem
of putting them together,

27
00:01:36,598 --> 00:01:39,682
along with finding
the missing pieces.

28
00:01:39,717 --> 00:01:41,568
This we offer
as an evening's hobby,

29
00:01:41,603 --> 00:01:43,436
a little
extracurricular diversion,

30
00:01:43,471 --> 00:01:47,190
which is really the national
pastime inthe twilight zone.

31
00:02:55,058 --> 00:02:59,429
Flight 453 to kansas city

32
00:02:59,464 --> 00:03:04,434
now ready for boarding
through gate number 14.

33
00:03:04,469 --> 00:03:06,186
Flight 453, gate 14.

34
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:08,688
Passengers, please board.

35
00:03:13,076 --> 00:03:14,944
Let's go in there!

36
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:17,447
What about it?

37
00:03:18,081 --> 00:03:19,332
You need a can opener?

38
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:25,205
What, do they got
a hot poker game in there?

39
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,090
You tell me.

40
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:29,092
What about it?

41
00:03:29,127 --> 00:03:30,960
You dead, asleep or what?

42
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,614
George, what's going on here?

43
00:03:51,649 --> 00:03:53,483
There isn't any luggage.

44
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:55,985
Hey, george!

45
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,870
Ask them who's
responsible

46
00:03:57,905 --> 00:03:59,739
for forgetting
all the luggage.

47
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,995
You better come in here
and check me out.

48
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,497
I don't know what
yourproblems are,

49
00:04:07,532 --> 00:04:09,999
but you're going to have
to tell the passengers

50
00:04:10,034 --> 00:04:11,251
their luggage has
been delayed.

51
00:04:11,286 --> 00:04:13,136
Some idiot let
this plane take off

52
00:04:13,171 --> 00:04:15,004
without so much as
an envelope in there.

53
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:17,507
I'd be happy to,
except for one thing.

54
00:04:17,542 --> 00:04:18,758
What?

55
00:04:18,793 --> 00:04:20,643
There aren't any passengers!
Come here.

56
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:37,410
Robbins, you better
call the airport police

57
00:04:37,445 --> 00:04:39,279
and get them over here.

58
00:04:39,314 --> 00:04:41,164
I'll get bengston
in operations.

59
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:41,781
I hope...

60
00:04:41,816 --> 00:04:43,032
what?

61
00:04:43,067 --> 00:04:45,535
I hope he lets me
finish the story

62
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:47,420
before he has me committed.

63
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,437
There was nobody
on the plane,

64
00:05:04,472 --> 00:05:06,306
absolutely nobody.

65
00:05:06,341 --> 00:05:08,191
I don't know...
how could it stop

66
00:05:08,226 --> 00:05:10,693
without somebody
on that plane?

67
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:14,447
All right, ladies
and gentlemen,

68
00:05:14,482 --> 00:05:16,316
would you knock
it off, please?

69
00:05:16,351 --> 00:05:18,201
This is mr. Sheckly

70
00:05:18,236 --> 00:05:20,069
from the federal
aviation agency.

71
00:05:20,703 --> 00:05:23,206
He'd like to continue
the questioning.

72
00:05:23,241 --> 00:05:24,457
She's all
yours, sir.

73
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:26,959
Gentlemen, this is
not a formal hearing.

74
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:29,462
It's more in the nature
of a preliminary meeting.

75
00:05:29,497 --> 00:05:31,080
As your operations
chief noted,

76
00:05:31,115 --> 00:05:33,583
we're here to unearth
as many facts as we can.

77
00:05:33,618 --> 00:05:35,968
I'd appreciate hearing from you
only facts.

78
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:37,837
You can save us all
a lot of time

79
00:05:37,872 --> 00:05:40,340
if you'd avoid
personal hypotheses,

80
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:41,591
so we can keep the air clear

81
00:05:41,626 --> 00:05:44,727
and not clutter it up
with six dozen theories.

82
00:05:44,762 --> 00:05:46,596
Theories happen
to be my business.

83
00:05:46,631 --> 00:05:48,731
In the 20-odd years,
i've been with the f.a.a.

84
00:05:48,766 --> 00:05:49,982
I've got a pretty
good record

85
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:51,234
in putting together
jigsaw puzzles.

86
00:05:51,269 --> 00:05:53,102
Maybe some of them
haven't been

87
00:05:53,137 --> 00:05:54,354
as abnormal as this one,

88
00:05:54,389 --> 00:05:56,239
but i'll lay
my betting average

89
00:05:56,274 --> 00:05:58,107
on the line
any hour of the day.

90
00:05:58,142 --> 00:05:59,359
All right?

91
00:05:59,394 --> 00:06:01,244
Let's get down to business.

92
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:03,112
Now, which one of you
is cousins?

93
00:06:03,147 --> 00:06:04,997
Right here, sir.

94
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:06,249
You're the ramp
attendant?

95
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,117
Yes, sir.

96
00:06:08,152 --> 00:06:08,751
You were on duty

97
00:06:08,786 --> 00:06:10,620
when flight
107 arrived?

98
00:06:10,655 --> 00:06:11,871
That's right, sir.

99
00:06:11,906 --> 00:06:13,756
Ship came in normally...

100
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:18,127
did you notice
anything abnormal?

101
00:06:18,162 --> 00:06:20,012
No, she came in
right on the button.

102
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:21,264
She followed
my signal up the ramp.

103
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,132
She stopped right on the mark
where i told her to.

104
00:06:23,167 --> 00:06:25,635
She cut her engines
when i gave her the signal.

105
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:26,886
Did you see
the pilots?

106
00:06:26,921 --> 00:06:30,022
When i signal a plane in,
my attention's on the marks

107
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:33,142
and on the aircraft
on either side of her...

108
00:06:33,177 --> 00:06:35,027
well, actually,
i don't remember...

109
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:37,530
bengston, is your dispatcher
here from buffalo?

110
00:06:37,565 --> 00:06:39,399
Well, that's me, sir.

111
00:06:39,434 --> 00:06:40,650
I just arrived.

112
00:06:40,685 --> 00:06:43,152
Will you take
a look at this?

113
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,289
Yes, sir, that's
the flight plan.

114
00:06:46,324 --> 00:06:48,157
Did you see
the pilot sign it?

115
00:06:48,192 --> 00:06:50,660
I was at his elbow

116
00:06:50,695 --> 00:06:51,911
this morning
at 11:12 a.m.

117
00:06:51,946 --> 00:06:53,796
Pilot william j. Slocum?

118
00:06:53,831 --> 00:06:55,047
Yes, sir.

119
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:56,299
Copilot john o'brien,

120
00:06:56,334 --> 00:06:57,550
that's the name of
the first officer?

121
00:06:57,585 --> 00:06:58,801
Yes, sir.

122
00:06:58,836 --> 00:07:01,304
Did you see them
board the aircraft?

123
00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:03,172
Not...
not exactly, sir.

124
00:07:03,207 --> 00:07:05,675
I saw them leave
the dispatch office

125
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:06,926
and head
for the field.

126
00:07:06,961 --> 00:07:08,811
But to the best
of your knowledge,

127
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:10,062
that was the crew
of flight 107

128
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:12,565
when they took off from buffalo
at 11:30 this morning?

129
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,434
To the best
of my knowledge.

130
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:18,821
William j. Slocum,
john o'brien.

131
00:07:18,856 --> 00:07:20,690
Good pilots, both of them.

132
00:07:20,725 --> 00:07:23,826
Sober, reliable, the best men.

133
00:07:23,861 --> 00:07:26,329
I'm not casting any
stones, mr. Bengston.

134
00:07:26,364 --> 00:07:28,831
It's just that
the names are so...

135
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:30,082
so familiar.

136
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,202
Well, that'll
be all now,

137
00:07:33,237 --> 00:07:36,339
but stay around where
you can be reached.

138
00:07:43,846 --> 00:07:45,715
Mr. Sheckly...

139
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:48,851
this is paul malloy,
our public relations man.

140
00:07:48,886 --> 00:07:50,720
Public relations, huh?

141
00:07:50,755 --> 00:07:54,474
How much public, and
what kind of relations

142
00:07:54,509 --> 00:07:56,359
are you poor guys going
to have after this one?

143
00:07:56,394 --> 00:08:01,981
I got 22 years in this saddle
and i've never been licked yet.

144
00:08:02,016 --> 00:08:05,117
Oh, some of them
take a long time.

145
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:06,369
Couple of tons of metal

146
00:08:06,404 --> 00:08:08,871
spread over 50 square miles
of countryside.

147
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:11,991
Sometimes, all it is
is a misplaced air scoop

148
00:08:12,026 --> 00:08:15,127
or maybe a loose bolt
in the elevator hinge or...

149
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:17,747
once in a blue moon,
a pilot with a psychosis.

150
00:08:17,782 --> 00:08:19,632
But it's always something.

151
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:22,752
And that something
always shows up.

152
00:08:22,787 --> 00:08:25,888
You're talking about a crashed
aircraft, mr. Sheckly.

153
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:27,757
We're talking about
a disappearing act.

154
00:08:27,792 --> 00:08:30,259
Now, look, this just
couldn't have happened.

155
00:08:30,893 --> 00:08:34,647
An aircraft can't take off
with a full crew, 13 passengers

156
00:08:34,682 --> 00:08:37,767
and land an hour and 20 minutes
later with nobody on it.

157
00:08:37,802 --> 00:08:40,903
It simply is not within
the realm of possibility!

158
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,023
Mr. Malloy, you
are dead right.

159
00:08:44,058 --> 00:08:45,908
But the fact
is it happened.

160
00:08:45,943 --> 00:08:47,777
It can't
have happened.

161
00:08:47,812 --> 00:08:50,413
An airliner couldn't land
that perfectly

162
00:08:50,448 --> 00:08:52,281
with nobody controlling it.

163
00:08:52,915 --> 00:08:55,418
There must be...
therehasto be an explanation-

164
00:08:55,453 --> 00:09:01,040
a legitimate, valid, believable,
understandable explanation.

165
00:09:01,075 --> 00:09:03,175
There's only one
possible explanation.

166
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,044
These 13 people had parachutes.

167
00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:06,929
Now, they kept them
in the baggage compartment.

168
00:09:06,964 --> 00:09:08,798
That's why there
wasn't any luggage.

169
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:11,300
Then, someplace between here
and buffalo, they jumped out

170
00:09:11,335 --> 00:09:12,552
for a gag
or something, i guess.

171
00:09:12,587 --> 00:09:14,437
That's brilliant.
That's just brilliant.

172
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,939
And what about
the pilots, mr. Holmes?

173
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:17,557
Or is that part
just elementary?

174
00:09:17,592 --> 00:09:18,808
Maybe they hid
in the restroom.

175
00:09:18,843 --> 00:09:20,059
Sneaked out of the plane

176
00:09:20,094 --> 00:09:21,310
after i went to make
the phone call.

177
00:09:21,345 --> 00:09:22,562
Oh, cut it out.

178
00:09:22,597 --> 00:09:23,813
That's quite an imagination
you have, mr. Cousins.

179
00:09:23,848 --> 00:09:25,064
I'll give you that.

180
00:09:25,099 --> 00:09:26,949
Hey, what if...?

181
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:28,200
What if...?

182
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:29,452
What if what?

183
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:31,320
No, i don't know.

184
00:09:31,355 --> 00:09:32,572
It gets me.

185
00:09:32,607 --> 00:09:34,457
I'll tell you
this, though.

186
00:09:34,492 --> 00:09:36,959
I get spooked just
standing around here.

187
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:39,462
I get more spooked
inside, though.

188
00:09:39,497 --> 00:09:42,582
All those empty blue seats
just staring at you.

189
00:09:42,617 --> 00:09:43,833
Look, boys...

190
00:09:43,868 --> 00:09:46,335
we have been theorizing
for six solid hours.

191
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:48,838
I'm just a simple-minded
vice president

192
00:09:48,873 --> 00:09:50,089
in charge of operations,

193
00:09:50,124 --> 00:09:53,843
but i've got a passel of newsmen
out there bugging me to death

194
00:09:53,878 --> 00:09:56,345
as to what kind of
haunted operations

195
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,597
we are running here.

196
00:09:57,632 --> 00:10:00,099
Tell them to keep
their shirts on.

197
00:10:00,134 --> 00:10:01,350
That's whatyou
should be telling them

198
00:10:01,984 --> 00:10:03,853
or a reasonable facsimile
of an explanation.

199
00:10:03,888 --> 00:10:05,104
Then you better get
me another head

200
00:10:05,139 --> 00:10:06,355
and a couple
of sets of arms,

201
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:08,240
because i've been on
that phone for six hours.

202
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:10,743
I've had every news service,
every television network

203
00:10:10,778 --> 00:10:12,612
and a couple
of professional mind readers

204
00:10:12,647 --> 00:10:14,497
trying to figure out
what the great big mystery is

205
00:10:14,532 --> 00:10:16,365
we're supposed
to be hiding in here.

206
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,250
And you know how long i can
keep it up, mr. Bengston?

207
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:20,119
Maybe another 15 minutes

208
00:10:20,154 --> 00:10:21,370
and then the whole thing
is going to pop wide open

209
00:10:22,004 --> 00:10:23,873
and we're going to be stuck
with rotten egg on our face.

210
00:10:23,908 --> 00:10:25,124
And sheckly
and the government

211
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:27,009
are going to take
our franchise away from us.

212
00:10:27,044 --> 00:10:28,878
Incompetence,
mental instability,

213
00:10:28,913 --> 00:10:30,129
and you name it,
you can have it!

214
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:33,883
Have you checked out

215
00:10:33,918 --> 00:10:36,385
every one of the names
on this passenger manifest?

216
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,270
No, i have not.

217
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:40,773
That's all i need now
is to have a small army

218
00:10:40,808 --> 00:10:42,024
of relatives
from upstate new york

219
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:43,275
clutching at my lapels,

220
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,144
asking me for a
definitive statement

221
00:10:45,179 --> 00:10:46,395
as to where
their loved ones are

222
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:49,532
who took flight 107 out
of buffalo this morning.

223
00:10:49,567 --> 00:10:50,149
You mean to say,

224
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:52,034
you haven't even
had one inquiry yet?

225
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:55,788
Now, that's weird,
isn't it?

226
00:10:55,823 --> 00:10:58,290
Not a single inquiry.

227
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:00,159
But the ship arrived
only six hours ago.

228
00:11:00,194 --> 00:11:02,662
Maybe they haven't had
time to miss anyone.

229
00:11:02,697 --> 00:11:05,164
No, i'm kidding myself.

230
00:11:05,199 --> 00:11:09,552
Of course, someone would have
made an inquiry by now.

231
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:18,310
There goes
that old feeling again.

232
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:20,179
What feeling?

233
00:11:20,214 --> 00:11:25,184
This passenger manifest...
the names look so familiar.

234
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:56,348
Robbins, you said
something before.

235
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:58,217
What do
you mean?

236
00:11:58,252 --> 00:11:59,468
About the
parachutes?

237
00:11:59,503 --> 00:12:01,971
No, no, no,
you said something else.

238
00:12:02,006 --> 00:12:04,473
You said you looked
inside the plane

239
00:12:04,508 --> 00:12:05,725
and you saw the blue seats.

240
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,227
Yeah, i said
something like that.

241
00:12:08,262 --> 00:12:09,478
They are blue,

242
00:12:09,513 --> 00:12:12,615
but when i first looked in
the plane, the seats were brown.

243
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:14,483
Wait a minute,
they were red.

244
00:12:14,518 --> 00:12:16,485
I remember thinking
how faded they were,

245
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,737
but theywerered.

246
00:12:17,772 --> 00:12:19,622
What is all this nonsense?

247
00:12:19,657 --> 00:12:21,373
Haven't we got enough trouble

248
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:23,876
without you guys worrying
about the interior decoration?

249
00:12:31,133 --> 00:12:32,885
Bengston, come here.

250
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,639
Do you see a number
on that tail?

251
00:12:36,674 --> 00:12:38,507
Of course,
i see a number.

252
00:12:38,542 --> 00:12:39,759
Read it off to me.

253
00:12:39,794 --> 00:12:42,511
N-6-7-5-8-8.

254
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,649
Hey, robbins.

255
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:51,654
Do you see that same
number on the tail?

256
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,273
N-8-0-4-7-5-8.

257
00:12:54,308 --> 00:12:55,274
Hey, what's the matter?

258
00:12:55,309 --> 00:12:56,525
Are we going crazy
or something?

259
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,028
We're all seeing
different numbers.

260
00:12:59,063 --> 00:13:01,914
Gentlemen, i have a theory.

261
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:06,285
Unfortunately, the only way
i can prove it or disprove it

262
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,788
is going to put me
in considerable jeopardy.

263
00:13:08,823 --> 00:13:12,541
Any one of you ever hear
of mass suggestion?

264
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:17,179
So?

265
00:13:17,214 --> 00:13:19,048
I think that's what
we're dealing with now-

266
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:20,299
a kind of hypnosis.

267
00:13:20,334 --> 00:13:21,550
To put it more bluntly

268
00:13:21,585 --> 00:13:23,435
or perhaps a little
less believably,

269
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:27,056
i don't think this airplane
is really here.

270
00:13:27,091 --> 00:13:28,307
I think every
one of us

271
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:31,443
had a little hypnosis
performed on him,

272
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:33,195
a little suggestion.

273
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:36,949
Someone somewhere told us that
a dc-3 is inside this hangar

274
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:38,818
and that it landed this morning.

275
00:13:38,853 --> 00:13:40,069
That's what they said.

276
00:13:40,104 --> 00:13:43,205
So every one of us
had pictured in his mind

277
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,456
a dc-3 as he knows one.

278
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:48,210
Therefore, one of us
sees the seats as blue,

279
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:50,713
another sees them as brown,

280
00:13:50,748 --> 00:13:52,581
still another sees them as red.

281
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,084
I read one number

282
00:13:55,119 --> 00:13:56,969
off the tail.

283
00:13:57,004 --> 00:13:59,471
Two other guys
read two others.

284
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:03,225
Don't you understand
what i'm trying to say?

285
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:09,481
This particular aircraft
doesn't exist.

286
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:12,484
It really isn't
here at all.

287
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:13,736
Are you mad?

288
00:14:13,771 --> 00:14:15,604
Are you trying
to tell us

289
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:16,856
this is
an illusion?

290
00:14:16,891 --> 00:14:19,358
It's no illusion,
it's here.

291
00:14:19,393 --> 00:14:21,243
I can feel it,
it's here.

292
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:24,363
I'm going to prove to you
that you're wrong,

293
00:14:24,398 --> 00:14:28,117
or i'm going to prove
to you that i'm wrong.

294
00:14:28,152 --> 00:14:32,504
And if i happen to be wrong,
i also happen to be dead.

295
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:38,127
Robbins, will you roll the plane
outside and start the engines?

296
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:14,463
Sheckly, are you sure
you know what you're doing?

297
00:15:14,498 --> 00:15:16,966
I know what i'm doing.

298
00:15:17,001 --> 00:15:18,834
Start the engines.

299
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,222
If this plane
is imaginary,

300
00:15:23,257 --> 00:15:26,976
then so are those engines
and so are those props.

301
00:15:27,011 --> 00:15:28,844
So if i stick
my hand in them,

302
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:30,729
nothing is going
to happen.

303
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:34,483
But if my theory
is for the birds

304
00:15:34,518 --> 00:15:36,986
and those props
are real,

305
00:15:37,021 --> 00:15:39,488
make sure you
notify my wife.

306
00:15:39,523 --> 00:15:41,357
Go ahead, do it.

307
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:57,182
Well, gentlemen...

308
00:16:57,217 --> 00:16:59,935
i believe i've
proven my point.

309
00:17:13,582 --> 00:17:14,833
Bengston?

310
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:18,587
Malloy?!

311
00:17:23,592 --> 00:17:25,461
Cousins!

312
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,351
Robbins!

313
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:34,219
Bengston!

314
00:17:34,254 --> 00:17:35,471
Malloy!

315
00:17:39,108 --> 00:17:41,610
Bengston! Malloy!

316
00:17:41,645 --> 00:17:43,479
Hey, where are you people?

317
00:17:43,514 --> 00:17:45,364
Hey, bengston!

318
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:46,615
Where are you peop...?

319
00:17:49,118 --> 00:17:50,369
What happened?

320
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,625
Bengston, what happened?

321
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,243
What are you talking about?

322
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:04,500
Aren't you...?

323
00:18:04,535 --> 00:18:05,751
You're sheckly, aren't you?

324
00:18:05,786 --> 00:18:08,253
Aren't you sheckly
of the f.a.a.?

325
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,640
What kind of a gag is this?

326
00:18:11,675 --> 00:18:14,143
Who do you think i am?

327
00:18:14,178 --> 00:18:15,394
What's going on?

328
00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:17,646
What is
the problem?

329
00:18:17,681 --> 00:18:18,397
What's the problem?

330
00:18:18,432 --> 00:18:20,265
Bengston, are you
off your rocker?

331
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:24,019
One minute, there's a hangar
full of men and an aircraft.

332
00:18:24,054 --> 00:18:25,270
The next minute i prove

333
00:18:25,305 --> 00:18:28,407
that not only doesn't
the aircraft exist, but...

334
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,783
what else didn't exist?

335
00:18:37,818 --> 00:18:40,285
Mr. Sheckly,
are you drunk?

336
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,171
Or are you
sick or what?

337
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,542
Bengston...

338
00:18:46,577 --> 00:18:49,044
bengston,
where's malloy?

339
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,547
Malloy?

340
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,054
Malloy, you better get up

341
00:18:59,688 --> 00:19:00,939
and zero in
your boss here

342
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:03,442
as to the cause and
effects of insanity.

343
00:19:03,477 --> 00:19:05,310
You...

344
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:14,069
"miss penny jackson,
beautiful, young movie starlet

345
00:19:14,104 --> 00:19:15,954
"is shown here arriving

346
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:19,458
"on trans-east airline,
flight 107

347
00:19:19,493 --> 00:19:23,212
which arrived from buffalo
this morning."

348
00:19:25,714 --> 00:19:27,833
What's going on?

349
00:19:27,868 --> 00:19:30,335
Who is this guy?

350
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,838
How could they have
taken that picture?

351
00:19:32,873 --> 00:19:34,723
How could they
say it landed

352
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:35,974
and everything
went...?

353
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:37,843
Went what?

354
00:19:37,878 --> 00:19:39,094
You know this guy?

355
00:19:39,129 --> 00:19:40,979
Mr. Sheckly...

356
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:47,853
this is paul malloy,
our public relations man.

357
00:19:49,738 --> 00:19:50,489
What are you talking about?

358
00:19:50,524 --> 00:19:51,740
I know who it is.

359
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:52,991
What's going on here?

360
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:54,243
Maybe you'd
better tell us.

361
00:19:54,278 --> 00:19:55,494
What is so odd

362
00:19:55,529 --> 00:19:57,362
about a picture of
a flight arrival?

363
00:19:57,397 --> 00:19:58,614
What's so od...?

364
00:19:59,248 --> 00:20:02,367
Bengston,
you check me out.

365
00:20:02,402 --> 00:20:04,253
Didn't that
flight arrive

366
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,121
with nobody on it?

367
00:20:06,156 --> 00:20:08,624
No crew,
no stewardess,

368
00:20:09,258 --> 00:20:11,760
no passengers,
no baggage?

369
00:20:11,795 --> 00:20:13,011
No, mr. Sheckly.

370
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:14,880
Flight 107
from our airline

371
00:20:14,915 --> 00:20:17,382
arrived at 12:50
today on schedule.

372
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:18,634
You mean to tell me,

373
00:20:18,669 --> 00:20:21,136
you're not missing
an aircraft?

374
00:20:21,171 --> 00:20:23,639
That's exactly what he's
telling you, mister.

375
00:20:23,674 --> 00:20:25,524
We're not missing
any flight 107,

376
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:26,775
or any other flight.

377
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:34,283
Well... how
could that be?

378
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:39,905
You never missed
a flight 107?

379
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,544
That's right.

380
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:47,412
You were the examiner
on that one.

381
00:20:47,447 --> 00:20:48,664
On what one?

382
00:20:48,699 --> 00:20:50,549
We lost
just one flight

383
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:53,051
in some 20-odd
years, just one.

384
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:55,554
Flight 107.

385
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:57,422
But, mr. Sheckly,

386
00:20:57,457 --> 00:21:02,427
that was some 17
or 18 years ago.

387
00:21:02,462 --> 00:21:03,679
Flight 107
out of buffalo.

388
00:21:04,313 --> 00:21:05,564
Flight 107
out of buffalo.

389
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:08,684
But like i said, that
was 17, 18 years ago.

390
00:21:08,719 --> 00:21:11,186
Well, what
happened to her?

391
00:21:11,221 --> 00:21:13,071
Lost in the fog,
never found.

392
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:15,574
We figured she must
have gone off course,

393
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:18,694
went out over the ocean,
went down there.

394
00:21:18,729 --> 00:21:20,579
You never found her?

395
00:21:20,614 --> 00:21:22,447
Never found her.

396
00:21:22,482 --> 00:21:24,950
Mr. Sheckly here
investigated.

397
00:21:24,985 --> 00:21:26,201
But that was one case

398
00:21:26,236 --> 00:21:29,338
you were never
able to button up.

399
00:21:29,373 --> 00:21:32,457
Nobody was ever able
to button it up.

400
00:21:32,492 --> 00:21:34,960
Just sits on
the books as lost,

401
00:21:34,995 --> 00:21:37,462
presumed crashed
for reasons unknown.

402
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:43,101
Mr. Sheckly...

403
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:48,724
why don't you let me
drive you home?

404
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:53,111
For reasons unknown?

405
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:59,368
But i never been licked
on a case yet... never.

406
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:03,739
We've always
found the causes.

407
00:22:03,774 --> 00:22:05,624
Always.

408
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,629
We've always
found the causes.

409
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:13,749
Always.

410
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:20,005
I never been licked
on a case yet.

411
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:23,141
We've always found the causes.

412
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:25,644
Always found the causes.

413
00:22:28,146 --> 00:22:30,148
We've always
found the causes.

414
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:32,651
I never been licked
on a case yet.

415
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:38,907
I guess so.

416
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:48,917
Flight 107- 13 people.

417
00:22:48,952 --> 00:22:52,037
Pilot- william j. Slocum.

418
00:22:52,072 --> 00:22:54,539
Copilot- john o'brien.

419
00:22:54,574 --> 00:22:57,042
What happened to you?

420
00:22:57,077 --> 00:23:00,178
What went wrong?

421
00:23:00,213 --> 00:23:02,681
Where did you go down?

422
00:23:02,716 --> 00:23:03,932
Flight 107!

423
00:23:08,972 --> 00:23:12,057
Hey, flight 107!

424
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:15,193
Why didn't you leave a clue?!

425
00:23:15,228 --> 00:23:19,564
Why didn't you make a contact?!

426
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:22,701
Why didn't you?!

427
00:23:25,203 --> 00:23:27,706
Why didn't you leave a clue?!

428
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:34,579
Why didn't you ever tell anyone
what happened to you?

429
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:44,589
Picture of a man
with an achilles' heel,

430
00:23:44,624 --> 00:23:47,092
a mystery that landed
in his life

431
00:23:47,127 --> 00:23:48,977
and then turned
into a heavy weight,

432
00:23:49,012 --> 00:23:50,228
dragged across the years

433
00:23:50,263 --> 00:23:53,348
to ultimately take
the form of an illusion.

434
00:23:53,383 --> 00:23:54,599
Now, that's the clinical answer

435
00:23:54,634 --> 00:23:57,736
that they put on the tag
as they take him away.

436
00:23:57,771 --> 00:24:00,238
But if you choose to think
that the explanation

437
00:24:00,273 --> 00:24:02,107
has to do with
an airborneflying dutchman,

438
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:04,609
a ghost ship
in a fog-enshrouded night

439
00:24:04,644 --> 00:24:05,861
on a flight that never ends,

440
00:24:05,896 --> 00:24:08,997
then you're doing your business
in an old stand...

441
00:24:09,032 --> 00:24:10,248
inthe twilight zone.

442
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:16,421
Rod serling, creator
ofthe twilight zone,

443
00:24:16,456 --> 00:24:18,290
will tell you
about next week's story

444
00:24:18,325 --> 00:24:20,792
after this word
from our alternate sponsor.

445
00:24:23,011 --> 00:24:23,628
And now, mr. Serling.

446
00:24:23,663 --> 00:24:25,514
Next week
onthe twilight zone,

447
00:24:25,549 --> 00:24:27,382
we use a camera like an x ray

448
00:24:27,417 --> 00:24:30,519
and look under the skin of a
neighborhood of men and women.

449
00:24:30,554 --> 00:24:33,021
It's a little experiment
in human nature and behavior

450
00:24:33,056 --> 00:24:34,890
on the night
that a conelrad broadcast

451
00:24:34,925 --> 00:24:36,141
shatters their composure

452
00:24:36,176 --> 00:24:38,026
with an announcement
of terse terror-

453
00:24:38,061 --> 00:24:39,277
a bomb is coming.

454
00:24:39,312 --> 00:24:41,780
Most of our stories
are a little far out.

455
00:24:41,815 --> 00:24:43,031
This one is very close in.

456
00:24:43,066 --> 00:24:46,151
You'll see what i mean next week
when we present "the shelter."

457
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:20,735
Be sure and watchgunsmoke
starring james arness,

458
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:23,855
saturday nights over most
of these same stations.
