1
00:00:06,973 --> 00:00:10,110
You unlock this door
with the key of imagination.

2
00:00:10,727 --> 00:00:12,612
Beyond it is another dimension-

3
00:00:12,647 --> 00:00:13,863
a dimension of sound,

4
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,983
a dimension of sight,

5
00:00:17,018 --> 00:00:18,868
a dimension of mind.

6
00:00:18,903 --> 00:00:21,988
You're moving into a land
of both shadow and substance,

7
00:00:22,023 --> 00:00:23,239
of things and ideas.

8
00:00:23,274 --> 00:00:26,993
You've just crossed over
into the twilight zone.

9
00:00:31,998 --> 00:00:33,883
Reveille,
old tiger.

10
00:00:37,672 --> 00:00:39,005
Come on, get up
now, come on.

11
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:41,508
All right, all right.

12
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:50,900
Well, i knew you
were swacked, but really.

13
00:00:53,438 --> 00:00:54,654
Oh, boy.

14
00:00:57,192 --> 00:01:00,276
I didn't have
thatmuch to drink.

15
00:01:00,311 --> 00:01:02,162
Oh, hoo-hoo.

16
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:21,548
Hey, bob, where are we?

17
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:24,684
I had hoped we were
in the bedroom

18
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:27,804
of an apartment
on west 12th street

19
00:01:27,839 --> 00:01:29,689
in new york city.

20
00:01:29,724 --> 00:01:31,558
Well, we're not.

21
00:01:33,443 --> 00:01:35,945
Yeah, hmm.

22
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,814
Hmm, i don't get it.

23
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:40,316
All right.

24
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:44,070
We went to sleep
at home...

25
00:01:45,321 --> 00:01:46,573
didn't we?

26
00:01:46,608 --> 00:01:49,075
Well, of course
we did.

27
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:49,709
Well.

28
00:01:49,744 --> 00:01:52,212
Remember, we
left the party

29
00:01:52,247 --> 00:01:54,080
up in
bedford village.

30
00:01:54,115 --> 00:01:55,331
And you drove.

31
00:01:55,366 --> 00:01:57,217
I had to, remember?

32
00:01:57,252 --> 00:01:58,468
You were, uh...

33
00:01:58,503 --> 00:01:59,719
sleepy.

34
00:01:59,754 --> 00:02:01,588
Let's say
unable to drive.

35
00:02:01,623 --> 00:02:04,090
Even had the top down.

36
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:06,593
I thoughtthat
would revive you.

37
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:10,597
And then somewhere
above riverdale...

38
00:02:10,632 --> 00:02:13,099
well, somewhere
above riverdale-

39
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:14,350
what?

40
00:02:14,385 --> 00:02:17,987
Wait a minute.

41
00:02:18,022 --> 00:02:18,605
Something...

42
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,358
came down
on the car from overhead.

43
00:02:22,393 --> 00:02:23,610
A shadow.

44
00:02:23,645 --> 00:02:25,495
And then...

45
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:28,615
that's all i remember.

46
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:32,368
You probably
plowed us into another car.

47
00:02:32,403 --> 00:02:35,505
I did not
plow us into another car.

48
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,373
All right, all right.

49
00:02:38,007 --> 00:02:42,378
Let's just say,
another car plowed into us?

50
00:02:42,413 --> 00:02:45,515
We were probably knocked out.

51
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:47,383
No.

52
00:02:47,418 --> 00:02:50,520
You were already
knocked out.

53
00:02:50,555 --> 00:02:53,640
All right, all right,
just, ugh, oh, honey.

54
00:02:54,926 --> 00:02:57,393
Look, it's prob...
it's no big deal.

55
00:02:57,428 --> 00:03:00,530
Somebody brought us here,
put us to bed,

56
00:03:00,565 --> 00:03:01,781
there's probably
bacon sizzling

57
00:03:02,398 --> 00:03:03,650
and scrambled eggs

58
00:03:03,685 --> 00:03:05,535
waiting downstairs right now.

59
00:03:06,821 --> 00:03:09,906
In fact, i think
i can smell it now.

60
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:24,304
Good morning.

61
00:03:28,057 --> 00:03:29,309
No scrambled eggs.

62
00:03:29,344 --> 00:03:31,811
Well, they must
have gone out.

63
00:03:31,846 --> 00:03:34,314
Probably expected us
to sleep for a while.

64
00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:36,182
Well, they must be
pretty casual types

65
00:03:36,217 --> 00:03:39,936
to just go off and leave
us sleeping up there.

66
00:03:39,971 --> 00:03:42,438
I'm going to find
out where we are.

67
00:03:43,072 --> 00:03:46,192
Oh, uh, information- 411?

68
00:03:46,227 --> 00:03:47,443
I don't know.

69
00:03:47,478 --> 00:03:49,329
Just dial "o."

70
00:03:49,364 --> 00:03:50,580
Bob!

71
00:03:50,615 --> 00:03:53,700
Bob, what do
you mean, "bob"?

72
00:03:53,735 --> 00:03:55,585
The thing wasn't wired in.

73
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,453
You pulled it
too hard.

74
00:03:57,488 --> 00:03:59,956
It still has
to be wired in.

75
00:03:59,991 --> 00:04:03,092
Well, just put
it back, please.

76
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:06,346
Got a pencil?

77
00:04:06,381 --> 00:04:07,096
No.

78
00:04:07,131 --> 00:04:10,216
There must be one
around here somewhere.

79
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:17,724
Mmm, she's not
a very good housekeeper.

80
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,609
All the drawers stick.

81
00:04:19,644 --> 00:04:22,729
Bob, would you
help me please?

82
00:05:05,655 --> 00:05:10,026
This is stage bread,
a... it's a prop.

83
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,785
Just empty cartons.

84
00:05:26,327 --> 00:05:30,680
Well, it's a good thing
i don't believe in ghosts.

85
00:05:30,715 --> 00:05:33,182
Well, neither
do i, but...

86
00:05:33,217 --> 00:05:36,936
let's, uh, let's get
out of here anyway.

87
00:05:37,553 --> 00:05:39,439
Bob and millie frasier.

88
00:05:39,474 --> 00:05:41,307
Average young new yorkers

89
00:05:41,342 --> 00:05:44,444
who attended a party
in the country last night

90
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,946
and, on the way home,
took a detour.

91
00:05:46,981 --> 00:05:49,449
Most of us
on waking in the morning

92
00:05:49,484 --> 00:05:51,317
know exactly where we are.

93
00:05:51,352 --> 00:05:53,820
The rooster or alarm clock
brings us out of sleep

94
00:05:53,855 --> 00:05:56,956
into the familiar sights,
sounds, aromas of home

95
00:05:56,991 --> 00:05:59,459
and the comfort
of a routine day ahead.

96
00:05:59,494 --> 00:06:01,961
Not so with our young friends.

97
00:06:01,996 --> 00:06:05,081
This will be a day like
none they've ever spent.

98
00:06:05,116 --> 00:06:08,835
And they'll spend it
in the twilight zone.

99
00:06:53,596 --> 00:06:56,099
Must have gone.

100
00:06:56,134 --> 00:06:58,601
Well, what
do we do now?

101
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:04,223
Let's try one
of the neighbors.

102
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:07,977
Boy, i wish i could
remember how we got here.

103
00:07:08,012 --> 00:07:11,731
Reminds me of the
coney island spook house.

104
00:07:11,766 --> 00:07:13,616
Does it strike you

105
00:07:13,651 --> 00:07:19,238
that, um, it's just
as spooky out here?

106
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:22,992
There's not even
a bird singing.

107
00:07:23,027 --> 00:07:24,877
Maybe they're just
being considerate

108
00:07:24,912 --> 00:07:26,746
of your hangover, darling.

109
00:07:26,781 --> 00:07:27,997
Stop needling me.

110
00:07:28,032 --> 00:07:29,248
I'm not needling.

111
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:30,500
But if you'd been
sober enough to drive

112
00:07:30,535 --> 00:07:31,751
maybe we'd be home now

113
00:07:31,786 --> 00:07:33,636
instead of wherever
this is!

114
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:36,139
Oh, hicksville.

115
00:07:36,174 --> 00:07:38,641
Boy, i don't see
how they stand it

116
00:07:38,676 --> 00:07:40,510
in this small burg.

117
00:07:40,545 --> 00:07:43,012
Hmm, you mean
all these people

118
00:07:43,047 --> 00:07:46,149
are just standing around
staring at us, huh?

119
00:07:46,184 --> 00:07:48,017
Why, where, do
you see any?

120
00:07:48,052 --> 00:07:50,520
No, not a soul.

121
00:07:50,555 --> 00:07:53,156
That's the way
it is in these small towns.

122
00:07:53,191 --> 00:07:56,159
They peek from behind curtains.

123
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:59,162
Give me the big
city any day!

124
00:07:59,197 --> 00:08:01,664
At least there you know when
you're being stared at.

125
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:04,784
Oh, look,
there's one citizen

126
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:07,537
that makes no pretense
about staring.

127
00:08:07,572 --> 00:08:10,039
Isn't he cute?

128
00:08:10,074 --> 00:08:11,924
All right, look,
come on, honey.

129
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:14,427
No, no, shh, i
think he's tame.

130
00:08:14,462 --> 00:08:15,678
Oh, come look.

131
00:08:15,713 --> 00:08:18,181
Yeah, yeah, ah,
he's a real doll.

132
00:08:18,216 --> 00:08:19,432
Hey, nice baby.

133
00:08:20,049 --> 00:08:21,300
Hey, sweetheart.

134
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:29,442
I touched him
and he fell over dead.

135
00:08:30,059 --> 00:08:30,693
Yeah?

136
00:08:30,728 --> 00:08:33,813
This thing's been
dead for years.

137
00:08:33,848 --> 00:08:35,698
Stuffed.

138
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:40,703
What would anybody want
with a stuffed squirrel?

139
00:08:40,738 --> 00:08:41,954
Oh, mill, don't ask
me to figure out

140
00:08:41,989 --> 00:08:43,823
why anybody does anything
in this hick town.

141
00:08:43,858 --> 00:08:45,074
Shh, they'll hear you.

142
00:08:45,109 --> 00:08:46,325
Where're you going?

143
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,577
First, i'd like to
find out where we are.

144
00:08:47,612 --> 00:08:49,462
Second, i'd like
to use their phone.

145
00:08:49,497 --> 00:08:51,330
Third, i'd like to beg, buy,
borrow or steal an aspirin.

146
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:15,488
I just want to go home.

147
00:09:15,523 --> 00:09:18,741
I want to go home!

148
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:21,861
Is there anybody here?!

149
00:09:21,896 --> 00:09:23,746
Can anybody hear us?!

150
00:09:23,781 --> 00:09:26,866
Please, won't somebody
help us?!

151
00:09:26,901 --> 00:09:29,368
Please, somebody!

152
00:09:33,122 --> 00:09:35,007
God, it's
that kid again.

153
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:42,515
Well, at least the
town's not deserted.

154
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:45,017
Yeah, maybe they're
all in one place-

155
00:09:45,635 --> 00:09:48,137
a, a town meeting,
or something like that.

156
00:09:48,172 --> 00:09:50,022
Sure, on a sunday morning.

157
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,525
Yeah, especially
on sunday.

158
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,393
That's where
they must be!

159
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:57,530
They're in church!

160
00:09:57,565 --> 00:09:58,147
Ah!

161
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:06,906
Wait, we just
can't walk in.

162
00:10:06,941 --> 00:10:08,791
Watch me.

163
00:10:08,826 --> 00:10:10,042
What'll you tell them?

164
00:10:10,077 --> 00:10:11,911
I'll tell them i'm tired
of their creepy town

165
00:10:11,946 --> 00:10:14,413
and i'll pay anybody
anything he asks

166
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:16,299
to get us on
a train or bus

167
00:10:16,334 --> 00:10:18,801
that'll get us back
to civilization.

168
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:29,312
Maybe they're praying.

169
00:10:29,347 --> 00:10:31,180
Maybe we'd better wait.

170
00:10:36,185 --> 00:10:39,322
Here's the church,
there's the steeple,

171
00:10:39,357 --> 00:10:41,190
open the door...

172
00:10:44,327 --> 00:10:46,829
nobody.

173
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,451
What now?

174
00:10:56,839 --> 00:10:57,456
Ah.

175
00:10:59,342 --> 00:11:01,210
This'll bring them.

176
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,466
Look outside.

177
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:09,969
See if anybody's coming.

178
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:57,016
Where'd everybody go?

179
00:11:58,267 --> 00:12:00,770
There isn't anybody.

180
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:03,272
Just us.

181
00:12:03,906 --> 00:12:05,775
Oh, come on.

182
00:12:06,409 --> 00:12:08,277
There isn't a person

183
00:12:08,312 --> 00:12:11,414
or a thing alive
in this town.

184
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,916
And yet...

185
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,167
what?

186
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:18,921
We're being watched.

187
00:12:18,956 --> 00:12:20,790
No.

188
00:12:20,825 --> 00:12:23,292
Now you're
getting delusions.

189
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:27,680
Was that a delusion?

190
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:32,051
I'm going to find that kid.

191
00:12:34,303 --> 00:12:35,554
Hey, kid.

192
00:12:36,806 --> 00:12:38,057
Come on out.

193
00:12:38,092 --> 00:12:40,559
We want to talk to you.

194
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:44,947
Where are you?

195
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:49,318
Nothing in this
town is real.

196
00:12:49,353 --> 00:12:52,455
The house we slept in,

197
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:54,957
this child we can't find,

198
00:12:54,992 --> 00:12:59,328
that squirrel,
stuffed with sawdust.

199
00:12:59,363 --> 00:13:01,831
Show me one thing
that's real.

200
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:08,087
That tree is real.

201
00:13:12,341 --> 00:13:13,592
Ah...

202
00:13:14,261 --> 00:13:16,095
tree, i love you.

203
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:29,859
Get me out of here.

204
00:13:32,361 --> 00:13:34,246
Honey, look, wait!

205
00:13:34,281 --> 00:13:36,115
There's bound to
be an explanation.

206
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,366
What, what?

207
00:13:37,401 --> 00:13:40,503
All right, just
calm down, darling.

208
00:13:40,538 --> 00:13:41,120
Here.

209
00:13:43,005 --> 00:13:46,125
Hey, maybe there's going
to be a wedding here today.

210
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,261
Sure, sure, they
fixed up the lawn

211
00:13:49,296 --> 00:13:51,130
to make it look pretty.

212
00:13:51,165 --> 00:13:54,266
I mean, you
know how these...

213
00:13:55,518 --> 00:13:57,386
yeah, okay.

214
00:13:59,889 --> 00:14:01,140
Bob...

215
00:14:01,175 --> 00:14:03,893
look, the grass, the ground.

216
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:18,040
Wha... look.

217
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:20,659
Why...

218
00:14:21,911 --> 00:14:25,047
why, this... this isn't grass.

219
00:14:25,082 --> 00:14:27,550
It's paper-mache.

220
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:32,421
Where are we, bob?

221
00:14:32,456 --> 00:14:33,672
Where are we?

222
00:14:53,442 --> 00:14:55,945
Hey!

223
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:59,081
Hey, anybody here?!

224
00:14:59,116 --> 00:15:01,584
Somebody?!

225
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:25,975
Hey!

226
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:27,226
Hey, hey!

227
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:29,111
Boy, am i glad to see you!

228
00:15:29,146 --> 00:15:30,980
We've been wandering
around here all morning.

229
00:15:31,614 --> 00:15:33,482
You're the first person...

230
00:15:41,624 --> 00:15:42,875
bob.

231
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,126
I don't know what it is...

232
00:15:44,161 --> 00:15:45,377
a trick, a joke!

233
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,634
Is there somebody watching us?

234
00:15:51,669 --> 00:15:56,005
Are you watching us there,
behind those curtains?

235
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,507
Is this a test?

236
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:02,394
Are you trying to find out
how much of this we can take

237
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:05,514
before we turn
into blathering idiots?

238
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:09,268
Is this some kind of a joke?

239
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,664
Bob, please don't try
to find out anything more.

240
00:16:21,699 --> 00:16:25,784
Let's just
keep going, hmm?

241
00:16:29,538 --> 00:16:32,424
Honey, look at that.

242
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:33,792
Get in.

243
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:35,427
You think it's all right?

244
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:42,935
Come on, baby,
come on, let's go.

245
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:44,803
Bob, stop, you're going
to flood the motor

246
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:46,055
stomping on it that way.

247
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:47,306
What, yeah, you
want to drive?

248
00:16:47,341 --> 00:16:49,191
You're the one
who drove us

249
00:16:49,226 --> 00:16:52,311
into this nuthouse
in the first place.

250
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:07,576
There's no motor.

251
00:17:07,611 --> 00:17:10,079
How... the...

252
00:17:10,114 --> 00:17:14,466
there's no engine in this thing.

253
00:17:17,004 --> 00:17:18,837
Hey, you hear what i said?

254
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:22,591
I mean, uh, isn't that a...

255
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:25,094
no motor.

256
00:17:25,728 --> 00:17:28,847
Huh...

257
00:17:30,733 --> 00:17:34,486
what's the matter?

258
00:17:36,238 --> 00:17:39,358
Well, what have
i done now?

259
00:17:39,393 --> 00:17:42,494
Honey?

260
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:48,751
I did not drive us
into this place.

261
00:17:51,253 --> 00:17:55,007
I'm sorry i said that.

262
00:17:55,042 --> 00:17:56,258
It's all my fault

263
00:17:56,293 --> 00:17:59,378
for being too
tight to drive.

264
00:18:10,639 --> 00:18:12,524
Do you remember
any more?

265
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:13,776
Hmm?

266
00:18:13,811 --> 00:18:15,644
Anything that
happened...

267
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,529
how we got here?

268
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:23,786
Only what i've already
told you, bob.

269
00:18:23,821 --> 00:18:26,288
I was driving along

270
00:18:26,323 --> 00:18:29,408
somewhere above riverdale.

271
00:18:29,443 --> 00:18:33,796
You were asleep
in the back seat.

272
00:18:33,831 --> 00:18:36,915
And then something...

273
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:43,806
a shadow, or something,
enveloped the car, and...

274
00:18:43,841 --> 00:18:46,308
and that's all i remember.

275
00:18:48,177 --> 00:18:50,062
I guess i fainted.

276
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:57,569
Crashed?

277
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:05,694
I crashed- that would explain
everything, wouldn't it?

278
00:19:05,729 --> 00:19:09,448
No, not to me.

279
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:11,333
Yeah.

280
00:19:11,368 --> 00:19:13,202
I crashed.

281
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:23,212
Maybe we're dead, bob.

282
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:26,965
Maybe this place is hell.

283
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:35,724
Did you...

284
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:41,363
did you ever hear
of a railroad in hell?

285
00:19:41,398 --> 00:19:41,980
No.

286
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:45,117
But the train probably
doesn't stop here.

287
00:19:45,152 --> 00:19:47,619
Well, we'll take
the next one.

288
00:19:47,654 --> 00:19:48,871
Come on.

289
00:19:48,906 --> 00:19:50,122
Let's find out where
the station is.

290
00:19:50,157 --> 00:19:51,990
Wait, my shoes!

291
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:54,493
Wait, don't... wait for me!

292
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,393
Wait for us!

293
00:20:11,428 --> 00:20:13,896
Whoo, don't go!

294
00:20:13,931 --> 00:20:16,398
Hello, you
beautiful train.

295
00:20:16,433 --> 00:20:17,649
Oh, did you ever see

296
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:18,901
such a beautiful train?

297
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:21,403
Ho, ho, i never saw
a more beautiful train

298
00:20:21,438 --> 00:20:23,272
in my life.

299
00:20:23,307 --> 00:20:24,523
What about tickets?

300
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:26,408
We'll get them
from the conductor.

301
00:20:26,443 --> 00:20:29,528
We've got the whole
car to ourselves.

302
00:20:34,917 --> 00:20:35,784
Oh.

303
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:41,423
Oh, what a nutty little town.

304
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:43,292
And how.

305
00:20:43,327 --> 00:20:47,045
Boy, i still wonder
how we got there.

306
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,298
Come on, honey.

307
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:53,051
Admit it, you did have
a few drinks at the party, now.

308
00:20:53,302 --> 00:20:55,187
Didn't you?

309
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:57,689
One or two.

310
00:20:58,307 --> 00:20:58,941
Mm-hmm.

311
00:20:58,976 --> 00:21:00,809
Well, somewhere along the line,

312
00:21:00,844 --> 00:21:02,694
your drinks caught up with you.

313
00:21:02,729 --> 00:21:04,563
And you got lost,

314
00:21:04,598 --> 00:21:07,065
and we ended up here
in centerville.

315
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,951
I suppose that's the kind

316
00:21:08,986 --> 00:21:12,704
of screwball thing
that i would do.

317
00:21:12,739 --> 00:21:13,956
How do you put up with me?

318
00:21:13,991 --> 00:21:17,576
I don't know, i just have
a weakness for screwballs.

319
00:21:17,611 --> 00:21:19,461
You certainly have
a good one.

320
00:21:19,496 --> 00:21:20,712
Well, well...

321
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:23,215
it wasn't all that bad
back there now, was it?

322
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,083
Not a bit, no.

323
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:26,969
In fact, i only jump a foot

324
00:21:27,004 --> 00:21:28,837
when somebody says "boo."

325
00:21:28,872 --> 00:21:30,088
Boo.

326
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:36,979
Oh!

327
00:21:37,014 --> 00:21:37,596
What?

328
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:40,098
Wait'll i get
back to the office.

329
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:41,984
I can see old mr. Peabody now.

330
00:21:42,019 --> 00:21:44,486
"Frasier, we're a team here."

331
00:21:44,521 --> 00:21:45,103
Yeah.

332
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:46,989
"When one member
of that team lets us down

333
00:21:47,024 --> 00:21:48,857
the whole
organization suffers."

334
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:57,749
Oh, no. No!

335
00:21:57,784 --> 00:22:02,754
Now, well, uh... maybe it's not
the same centerville.

336
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:06,375
It's the same one.

337
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:10,128
I saw on the street-

338
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:12,631
nothing moving

339
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:14,516
nothing real.

340
00:22:17,019 --> 00:22:19,521
How did we get back there?

341
00:22:21,023 --> 00:22:24,142
We've gone in a circle.

342
00:22:24,177 --> 00:22:25,394
Come on.

343
00:22:25,429 --> 00:22:27,029
No, i'm not going back.

344
00:22:27,064 --> 00:22:28,280
Not back.

345
00:22:28,315 --> 00:22:30,148
We're going to get
on that main road

346
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:32,651
and keep right on walking.

347
00:22:32,686 --> 00:22:33,902
Come on!

348
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:49,801
Wait!

349
00:22:49,836 --> 00:22:50,419
Let's run, huh?

350
00:22:50,454 --> 00:22:51,670
Could you?

351
00:22:51,705 --> 00:22:52,921
I could gallop

352
00:22:52,956 --> 00:22:54,172
if it would get us out
of here any faster.

353
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:56,058
No, we better
save our energy.

354
00:22:56,093 --> 00:22:57,309
Might be a long
road ahead.

355
00:22:57,344 --> 00:22:59,811
We still have a few
hours of daylight.

356
00:22:59,846 --> 00:23:01,680
The sun will be up.

357
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:28,840
Bob!

358
00:23:56,118 --> 00:23:58,120
Be careful with
your pets, dear.

359
00:23:58,155 --> 00:24:00,622
Daddy brought them
all the way from earth.

360
00:24:00,657 --> 00:24:02,491
Oh, can't i play
with them, mommy?

361
00:24:02,526 --> 00:24:03,625
After lunch, dear.

362
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:04,876
Right now,
put them back.

363
00:24:04,911 --> 00:24:07,379
Oh...
go on.

364
00:24:11,133 --> 00:24:14,252
The moral of what you've
just seen is clear.

365
00:24:14,287 --> 00:24:16,138
If you drink, don't drive.

366
00:24:16,173 --> 00:24:18,006

00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:19,257
she shouldn't drive, either.

368
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:22,394
You might both just wake up
with a whale of a headache

369
00:24:22,429 --> 00:24:26,765
in a deserted village
in the twilight zone.
