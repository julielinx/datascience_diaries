1
00:00:06,556 --> 00:00:09,693
You unlock this door
with the key of imagination.

2
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:11,561
Beyond it is another dimension-

3
00:00:11,596 --> 00:00:12,696
a dimension of sound,

4
00:00:13,982 --> 00:00:15,815
a dimension of sight,

5
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:18,318
a dimension of mind.

6
00:00:18,353 --> 00:00:20,820
You're moving into a land
of both shadow and substance,

7
00:00:20,855 --> 00:00:22,072
of things and ideas.

8
00:00:22,706 --> 00:00:25,825
You've just crossed over
into the twilight zone.

9
00:01:27,771 --> 00:01:29,139
Oh, i'm sorry, dear.

10
00:01:29,174 --> 00:01:32,892
You keep forgetting i'm
no longer a varsity end.

11
00:01:32,927 --> 00:01:34,778
Oh, it was fun though, huh?

12
00:01:36,681 --> 00:01:39,783
My doctor should have witnessed
that little activity.

13
00:01:42,285 --> 00:01:45,405
If you persist in telling me
about your ailments,

14
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,290
i may just have to run out
and get sick.

15
00:01:49,194 --> 00:01:50,410
It gets dull, you know.

16
00:01:50,445 --> 00:01:52,912
Terribly dull.

17
00:01:52,947 --> 00:01:54,164
I just, uh...

18
00:01:54,199 --> 00:01:57,300
mentioned it in
passing, my dear.

19
00:01:57,335 --> 00:01:59,169
What did you do today?

20
00:01:59,204 --> 00:02:01,671
You, uh... did
you go shopping?

21
00:02:01,706 --> 00:02:02,922
Oh, i had a ball.

22
00:02:02,957 --> 00:02:06,059
An absolute wild ball,
an earthshaking ball.

23
00:02:06,094 --> 00:02:07,927
Want to know what i did?
What?

24
00:02:07,962 --> 00:02:09,179
Well...

25
00:02:09,214 --> 00:02:11,681
first of all,
i had breakfast.

26
00:02:11,716 --> 00:02:13,183
Then i had lunch,

27
00:02:13,218 --> 00:02:15,685
and then i fired
the stupid maid.

28
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,570
And then

29
00:02:17,605 --> 00:02:19,439
i waited for you,
harmon, dear.

30
00:02:19,474 --> 00:02:23,193
So, all in all, i'd say
it was one of those days

31
00:02:23,228 --> 00:02:26,946
that made you simply want
to go jump off a bridge.

32
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,203
Am i getting
through to you at all?

33
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:39,592
Why, it's smoky the bear.

34
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:44,597
Flora, dear, you could
start a serious fire.

35
00:02:44,632 --> 00:02:47,717
Big daddy, one of these
long, late nights,

36
00:02:47,752 --> 00:02:49,602
that's exactly
what i'm going to do.

37
00:02:49,637 --> 00:02:51,471
While you're
at it,

38
00:02:51,506 --> 00:02:55,608
why don't you pick up the
remnants of that aged eyesore

39
00:02:55,643 --> 00:02:58,228
that i so happily
knocked over a
few minutes ago?

40
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:06,619
This came
from my mother.

41
00:03:06,654 --> 00:03:09,122
It's a very old piece, flora.

42
00:03:09,157 --> 00:03:09,873
Oh?

43
00:03:09,908 --> 00:03:11,741
Worth what?

44
00:03:11,776 --> 00:03:13,626
89 cents?

45
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:16,129
I'll tell you
what, big daddy.

46
00:03:16,164 --> 00:03:20,500
On our anniversary, i'll go out
and buy you six of them.

47
00:03:20,535 --> 00:03:23,636
I'll take them to the dime store
and have them gift-wrapped.

48
00:03:23,671 --> 00:03:26,639
Then i'll find you
some of your
favorite music

49
00:03:26,674 --> 00:03:29,142
and play it on
your old victrola.

50
00:03:29,177 --> 00:03:32,645
Something like, uh,
"come to the wildwood church"?

51
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,148
And other such red-hot
toe-tapping numbers?

52
00:03:35,183 --> 00:03:37,400
It's worth very little

53
00:03:37,435 --> 00:03:39,269
except...

54
00:03:39,304 --> 00:03:41,154
except for sentimental value.

55
00:03:41,189 --> 00:03:44,908
That's a word you may
not understand, "sentiment."

56
00:03:44,943 --> 00:03:46,776
It means "the capacity to love."

57
00:03:46,811 --> 00:03:51,030
Big daddy,
if i don't fill the bill,

58
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:52,916
why don't you just say so
right out?

59
00:03:52,951 --> 00:03:54,784
Should you fail to know it

60
00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:56,669
there are 14
flights a day to reno,

61
00:03:56,704 --> 00:03:59,172
and i would just adore
to be on any one of them.

62
00:03:59,789 --> 00:04:01,174
Flora, i'm, uh,

63
00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:04,928
i'm not angry, i just wish
that you would, you would...

64
00:04:04,963 --> 00:04:08,047
you would try
to be more careful.

65
00:04:08,082 --> 00:04:11,184
Somebody should have
wished that five years ago

66
00:04:11,801 --> 00:04:13,052
when we took out
our papers.

67
00:04:13,087 --> 00:04:16,189
Oh, i knew
you were old, harmon.

68
00:04:16,224 --> 00:04:18,691
I just didn't
know how old.

69
00:04:18,726 --> 00:04:21,060
You better be
careful, big daddy,

70
00:04:21,095 --> 00:04:24,814
because if you ever take me
to a swinging weekend in egypt,

71
00:04:25,448 --> 00:04:27,951
i just may run away
with a mummy.

72
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:33,573
I'll, uh, i'll just wash up
and we'll go to dinner.

73
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:36,075
Yeah.

74
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,961
You do just that.

75
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:40,463
We'll make it your night.

76
00:04:40,498 --> 00:04:42,332
We'll do something really wild

77
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:45,084
like go to a band
concert in the park.

78
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:54,477
A picture of an aging man who
leads his life as thoreau said:

79
00:04:54,512 --> 00:04:56,346
In quiet desperation.

80
00:04:56,381 --> 00:05:00,099
Because harmon gordon
is enslaved by a love affair

81
00:05:00,134 --> 00:05:02,352
with a wife 40 years his junior.

82
00:05:02,387 --> 00:05:05,488
Because of this,
he runs when he should walk,

83
00:05:05,523 --> 00:05:09,242
he surrenders when
simple pride dictates a stand.

84
00:05:09,277 --> 00:05:12,362
He pines away for the lost
morning of his life

85
00:05:12,397 --> 00:05:14,864
when he should be
enjoying the evening.

86
00:05:14,899 --> 00:05:18,618
In short, mr. Harmon gordon
seeks a fountain of youth.

87
00:05:18,653 --> 00:05:20,503
And who's to say
he won't find it?

88
00:05:20,538 --> 00:05:23,006
This happens to be
the twilight zone.

89
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:43,943
Oh, great.

90
00:05:43,978 --> 00:05:46,446
I didn't ask you
to run the mile,

91
00:05:46,481 --> 00:05:49,565
just to go dancing
or the movies or something.

92
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,953
Don't start telling me
about how you took me
out of a chorus line

93
00:05:53,988 --> 00:05:57,073
and introduced me
to the finer things.

94
00:05:57,108 --> 00:05:58,958
Your idea of
the finer things

95
00:05:58,993 --> 00:06:03,963
is to hold hands in
a mausoleum and listen
to the organ music.

96
00:06:03,998 --> 00:06:08,334
Well, get yourself a nice, tall
glass of warm milk, big daddy,

97
00:06:08,369 --> 00:06:10,219
and curl up with an almanac,

98
00:06:10,254 --> 00:06:12,722
'cause we want you happy,
don't we?

99
00:06:17,261 --> 00:06:20,346
Uh, could i talk
to dr. Gordon, please?

100
00:06:21,597 --> 00:06:23,483
Yes, thank you.

101
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:29,739
Uh, raymond?

102
00:06:29,774 --> 00:06:31,607
It's harmon.

103
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:34,744
Raymond, i've got
to talk to you tonight.

104
00:06:34,779 --> 00:06:37,864
Would you please come over?

105
00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:41,000
Uh, drink all right?

106
00:06:41,035 --> 00:06:43,503
Uh, yeah,
it's fine.

107
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:57,884
You look a little tired, harmon.

108
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,769
Well, i've been, uh...

109
00:06:59,804 --> 00:07:03,523
a little rushed
this past week, so...

110
00:07:03,558 --> 00:07:05,391
flora in bed?

111
00:07:05,426 --> 00:07:08,144
Uh, yes, yes, she went to bed.

112
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:11,280
She asked to be remembered.

113
00:07:11,315 --> 00:07:14,033
Oh, she'll be remembered.

114
00:07:14,068 --> 00:07:18,037
You ought to get to know her
better, raymond.

115
00:07:18,072 --> 00:07:21,157
She's really...
she's really a very fine girl.

116
00:07:21,192 --> 00:07:22,658
Did i say otherwise?

117
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:26,162
Well, i know you two
haven't been exactly close,

118
00:07:26,197 --> 00:07:27,413
certainly not as close

119
00:07:27,448 --> 00:07:30,550
as a brother- and
sister-in-law could be.

120
00:07:30,585 --> 00:07:31,417
Harmon...

121
00:07:31,452 --> 00:07:33,302
will you do me a favor?

122
00:07:33,337 --> 00:07:35,171
Certainly.

123
00:07:35,206 --> 00:07:36,806
As a matter of fact, two favors.

124
00:07:36,841 --> 00:07:39,308
First, don't try
to sell me flora.

125
00:07:39,343 --> 00:07:41,177
You know what
i think of her,

126
00:07:41,212 --> 00:07:43,563
i've told her myself to her face

127
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:46,682
so i have no compunctions
about saying it aloud.

128
00:07:46,717 --> 00:07:49,185
She's a brassy,
conniving, little broad.

129
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,937
Let me finish.

130
00:07:50,972 --> 00:07:54,073
I could forgive her
her hungers, harmon,

131
00:07:54,108 --> 00:07:57,193
or the fact that she's
made out of asbestos

132
00:07:57,228 --> 00:07:59,078
and hasn't got
a heart in her body.

133
00:07:59,695 --> 00:08:00,947
But i can't forgive her

134
00:08:00,982 --> 00:08:03,449
for what she's
done to you.

135
00:08:03,484 --> 00:08:05,334
You know that
she's turned you

136
00:08:05,369 --> 00:08:07,837
into a frightened,
quaking fool.

137
00:08:07,872 --> 00:08:09,705
You dote on her,
you give in to her,

138
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,208
you run after her like a poodle.

139
00:08:12,243 --> 00:08:14,210
That's item
number one.

140
00:08:14,245 --> 00:08:16,095
Now the second favor

141
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:19,849
is that from now on,
after you've had your battles,

142
00:08:19,884 --> 00:08:22,351
don't call me at odd hours
of the night.

143
00:08:22,386 --> 00:08:25,354
I don't do that very often.

144
00:08:25,389 --> 00:08:28,107
Once is often
and twice is endless.

145
00:08:28,142 --> 00:08:30,226
We're very close
as brothers go.

146
00:08:30,261 --> 00:08:32,111
You know there
isn't anything

147
00:08:32,146 --> 00:08:34,113
i wouldn't do for you.

148
00:08:34,148 --> 00:08:37,233
But i can't run over here
like a saint bernard

149
00:08:37,268 --> 00:08:40,987
every time you get frozen
halfway up the mountainside.

150
00:08:41,022 --> 00:08:43,990
Now, she's a predatory
little alley cat.

151
00:08:44,025 --> 00:08:47,126
And she's always
been that way.

152
00:08:47,161 --> 00:08:50,746
I can just give you so much
solace, so much sympathy,

153
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:54,750
and after that,
it begins to craw.

154
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:56,752
Now, what is it tonight?

155
00:08:56,787 --> 00:08:59,889
Just someone to while
away the hours with

156
00:08:59,924 --> 00:09:02,508
or is there something
quite specific?

157
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:06,262
Um...

158
00:09:11,267 --> 00:09:13,152
um...

159
00:09:14,403 --> 00:09:16,906
this thing you, uh...

160
00:09:16,941 --> 00:09:18,774
been working on.

161
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:20,660
Go on.

162
00:09:20,695 --> 00:09:25,031
The cellular serum...
you've been successful with it.

163
00:09:25,281 --> 00:09:27,166
You must be out of your mind.

164
00:09:27,201 --> 00:09:31,170
I'm desperate, yes,
but i'm not out of my mind.

165
00:09:31,205 --> 00:09:32,672
You've made
animals younger,

166
00:09:32,707 --> 00:09:33,923
i've seen it myself.

167
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:36,425
You inject them with your fluid
and they're young again.

168
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,677
Animals, yes.

169
00:09:37,712 --> 00:09:40,179
Guinea pigs,
white mice, hamsters.

170
00:09:40,214 --> 00:09:43,549
I've rejuvenated glands,
organs, sometimes

171
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:45,301
a complete cellular structure.

172
00:09:45,336 --> 00:09:47,186
But we haven't
scratched the surface, harmon.

173
00:09:47,303 --> 00:09:49,188
We're stumbling
in the dark.

174
00:09:49,223 --> 00:09:50,439
I want you to inject me.

175
00:09:50,474 --> 00:09:52,808
You don't know what's involved.

176
00:09:52,843 --> 00:09:55,311
We're 20 years away from
trying this on a human being.

177
00:09:55,346 --> 00:09:56,562
Why?

178
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:59,065
We're dealing
in basic life form.

179
00:09:59,315 --> 00:10:02,451
We have no idea of how much
damage might result.

180
00:10:02,486 --> 00:10:05,571
We don't know how
it will affect the metabolism

181
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:08,708
of the body or the mind,
or the effect on the brain.

182
00:10:08,743 --> 00:10:12,461
We're winging this, we've killed
as many as we've saved.

183
00:10:12,496 --> 00:10:15,331
You said you'd do
anything for me.

184
00:10:15,366 --> 00:10:17,466
Anything within reason.

185
00:10:17,501 --> 00:10:20,086
Oh, but this is
within reason, raymond.

186
00:10:20,121 --> 00:10:23,222
I've come close
to the end of my rope.

187
00:10:23,257 --> 00:10:26,342
I'm at the point where
it matters very little to me

188
00:10:26,377 --> 00:10:28,227
whether i live or die.

189
00:10:28,262 --> 00:10:31,981
I want you to test this serum
on me, make me young again.

190
00:10:32,016 --> 00:10:33,849
I don't want to get any older.

191
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:36,736
Aside from this pronounced
death wish of yours,

192
00:10:36,771 --> 00:10:40,489
how would you like
to spend the rest of your life

193
00:10:40,524 --> 00:10:41,741
as a mutated freak?

194
00:10:41,776 --> 00:10:43,492
Or a gibbering idiot?

195
00:10:43,527 --> 00:10:45,995
Or a mindless shell?

196
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:49,615
That's not only possible,
it's highly probable.

197
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:52,752
We can't control an experiment
on a human being.

198
00:10:52,787 --> 00:10:54,620
It would be catch as catch can.

199
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:58,374
I'd not only take the risk,
i'd welcome it.

200
00:10:58,409 --> 00:10:59,875
The answer is no!

201
00:11:01,377 --> 00:11:04,513
I wouldn't experiment
on a strange bum i found

202
00:11:04,548 --> 00:11:05,765
on the street...

203
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,382
raymond.

204
00:11:06,417 --> 00:11:08,884
...to say nothing
of my own brother.

205
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:11,387
Raymond, please, wait, wait.

206
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:18,277
Raymond, please.

207
00:11:18,312 --> 00:11:20,780
The answer is no.

208
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:25,151
Good night, raymond.

209
00:11:25,186 --> 00:11:27,036
Thank you for coming.

210
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,688
Harmon.

211
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,332
As a doctor,
i can tell you

212
00:12:13,367 --> 00:12:15,201
what the effects
on the human body are

213
00:12:15,236 --> 00:12:19,588
landing on concrete at the
end of a 500-foot fall.

214
00:12:19,623 --> 00:12:21,207
As a man, can you tell me

215
00:12:21,242 --> 00:12:24,343
what the effects are
on the human brain

216
00:12:24,378 --> 00:12:27,463
when a man is deeply,
totally

217
00:12:27,498 --> 00:12:29,965
and dedicatedly love
with a woman

218
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,102
who can't stand
the sight of him?

219
00:12:33,137 --> 00:12:35,604
Have you even
the remotest idea

220
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:37,473
what kind of life
this is for me?

221
00:12:38,107 --> 00:12:40,609
I can tell you
what it could be...

222
00:12:40,644 --> 00:12:41,861
should be.

223
00:12:41,896 --> 00:12:45,614
You're a bright, charming,
wealthy, discerning guy,

224
00:12:45,649 --> 00:12:47,483
and you've been
hammered out of shape

225
00:12:47,518 --> 00:12:51,237
by a flashy piece of baggage
not fit to wait on your table.

226
00:12:51,272 --> 00:12:53,989
Well, whatever she is or isn't,

227
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:57,126
she is the only thing
on god's earth

228
00:12:57,161 --> 00:12:58,494
that i
care about.

229
00:12:58,529 --> 00:13:00,996
I beg you, give me a chance.

230
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:02,882
Give me a chance to save myself.

231
00:13:02,917 --> 00:13:04,750
And if i don't?

232
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:07,887
Then we'll see who
reaches the sidewalk first:

233
00:13:07,922 --> 00:13:12,258
The man in the elevator
or the free-falling body.

234
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:20,149
Oh, my dear god.

235
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,269
I feel sorry for you.

236
00:13:25,154 --> 00:13:28,908
Let me think it over
for an hour or two.

237
00:13:28,943 --> 00:13:31,410
I'll come back.

238
00:13:45,174 --> 00:13:47,042
Is that it?

239
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:48,928
That's it.

240
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:57,686
What can i expect?

241
00:13:58,304 --> 00:13:59,555
You can expect a miracle,

242
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:02,057
but you're not very
likely to get it.

243
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:05,060
Go to bed now,
don't go to work tomorrow.

244
00:14:05,095 --> 00:14:06,946
I'll be here
early in the morning.

245
00:14:06,981 --> 00:14:10,065
I want to be very close to you
for the next few days.

246
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,568
Well, when can i
expect some change?

247
00:14:12,603 --> 00:14:13,819
Within six hours.

248
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:16,956
That's when the first
physical change is noted.

249
00:14:16,991 --> 00:14:20,075
As for the mental change,
none of the rats or guinea pigs

250
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,961
have told me
what the feeling was.

251
00:14:21,996 --> 00:14:23,462
I'll be the first.

252
00:14:23,497 --> 00:14:25,331
You'll be the first...

253
00:14:25,366 --> 00:14:28,467
assuming that
you survive.

254
00:14:28,502 --> 00:14:30,970
You want to know
something, raymond?

255
00:14:31,005 --> 00:14:33,472
I'm not only
going to survive,

256
00:14:33,507 --> 00:14:37,226
i'm going to be young
again, i can feel it.

257
00:14:37,261 --> 00:14:40,346
I wonder if she has any
idea what she's done.

258
00:14:40,381 --> 00:14:44,099
Even one slight
little suspicion.

259
00:14:46,602 --> 00:14:47,853
But i promise you

260
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:51,607
that if you don't survive or
if you're damaged in any way,

261
00:14:51,642 --> 00:14:54,743
i'm going to take it
out of her skin,

262
00:14:54,778 --> 00:14:55,995
piece by piece.

263
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,246
She's going to donate
a pint of blood

264
00:14:57,281 --> 00:14:59,114
for every pint that
she's bled out of you.

265
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:02,868
That's not a
medical hypothesis,
that's a promise.

266
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:04,119
Go to bed now.

267
00:15:04,154 --> 00:15:06,005
I'll see you
in the morning.

268
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:56,005
Well, well, if it isn't
the poor man's kildare.

269
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:01,010
What brings
you out into the
early dawn, doctor?

270
00:16:01,045 --> 00:16:03,512
Where's harmon?

271
00:16:03,547 --> 00:16:06,015
When last seen,
he was pounding a pillow.

272
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:07,900
Is he all right?

273
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:10,402
What is this,
e.s.p. Or something?

274
00:16:10,437 --> 00:16:12,905
I asked you a question-
is he all right?

275
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:16,025
I presume he is,
but if you don't think so

276
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,910
just go in there
and blow a bugle.

277
00:16:17,945 --> 00:16:19,161
No, i'll wait
for him to get up.

278
00:16:19,196 --> 00:16:21,030
Yeah, you do that.

279
00:16:21,065 --> 00:16:23,532
Take off your stethoscope
and make yourself at home.

280
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,676
Haven't you talked
to him this morning?

281
00:16:33,711 --> 00:16:35,544
I haven't talked
to anybody.

282
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:37,429
Until you pounded
at the door

283
00:16:38,047 --> 00:16:39,932
at this ungodly hour.

284
00:16:39,967 --> 00:16:41,183
Did you talk
to him last night?

285
00:16:41,218 --> 00:16:42,434
He said something
when he went to bed.

286
00:16:42,469 --> 00:16:44,303
I hardly heard him.

287
00:16:46,689 --> 00:16:48,557
He sounded
lucid to you?

288
00:16:48,592 --> 00:16:51,694
Look, pally, i'm
not the night nurse.

289
00:16:51,729 --> 00:16:53,562
I think you're
in the wrong ward.

290
00:16:53,597 --> 00:16:57,950
Besides that,
you bore me.

291
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:06,208
How do you feel,
harmon?

292
00:17:06,243 --> 00:17:08,711
How do you feel, harmon?

293
00:17:11,213 --> 00:17:15,217
I ask for vince edwards
and look what they send me.

294
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:29,098
Ah, it's incredible
what a good night's sleep

295
00:17:29,133 --> 00:17:30,983
will do for a man, isn't it?

296
00:17:34,737 --> 00:17:35,988
Harmon?

297
00:17:36,023 --> 00:17:37,239
What have you...

298
00:17:37,274 --> 00:17:39,742
are you wearing
makeup or something?

299
00:17:39,777 --> 00:17:41,610
Makeup... no, no.

300
00:17:41,645 --> 00:17:44,113
No makeup, just
a good night's sleep.

301
00:17:44,148 --> 00:17:45,364
Well...

302
00:17:46,615 --> 00:17:47,866
you look so different.

303
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:49,752
Oh, do i?

304
00:17:49,787 --> 00:17:51,620
Yes, you...

305
00:17:51,655 --> 00:17:52,871
well, you look
wonderful

306
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:54,757
you, you look
so young.

307
00:17:56,043 --> 00:17:57,876
What's happened
to you?

308
00:17:57,911 --> 00:17:59,878
Ask my brother
over there.

309
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:01,764
No, his brother
doesn't know.

310
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:04,266
Howdoyou feel,
harmon?

311
00:18:04,301 --> 00:18:06,769
I feel like
a million dollars
tax-free,

312
00:18:06,804 --> 00:18:08,637
that's how i feel.

313
00:18:08,672 --> 00:18:10,522
Know what i'll do
for you, ray?

314
00:18:10,557 --> 00:18:11,774
I'll let you
take me on tour.

315
00:18:11,809 --> 00:18:14,893
They'll write you up
in all the medical journals.

316
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:17,396
But first you've got
to give me four weeks.

317
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:19,898
Flora and i are going to go
on a little ocean trip.

318
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,150
An ocean trip?

319
00:18:21,185 --> 00:18:22,401
Mm-hmm.

320
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:25,537
Well...
well, that's wonderful.

321
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:28,657
When do we go?

322
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:29,908
I've been thinking.

323
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:32,411
We ought to see if there's
anything sailing tonight.

324
00:18:32,446 --> 00:18:34,296
Unless of course
you'd rather fly.

325
00:18:34,331 --> 00:18:37,416
Oh, fly, sail,
who cares?

326
00:18:37,451 --> 00:18:40,552
Ooh, big daddy, i don't know
what you've done to yourself

327
00:18:40,587 --> 00:18:42,421
but let me clue you in
about something:

328
00:18:42,456 --> 00:18:44,306
I don't care,
'cause i like this fine.

329
00:18:44,341 --> 00:18:46,809
Oh, yes, i like it fine.

330
00:18:46,844 --> 00:18:49,678
I don't want you to plan
any trips for quite a while.

331
00:18:50,312 --> 00:18:52,181
Oh, blow it.

332
00:18:52,216 --> 00:18:56,568
I'll just go and change
for you, all right?

333
00:18:56,603 --> 00:18:57,820
Where would you
like to go?

334
00:18:57,855 --> 00:19:00,322
Paris? Rome?
Tokyo? Hmm?

335
00:19:00,357 --> 00:19:02,825
Anywhere you say.

336
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,693
I'm your passenger.

337
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:09,448
Oh...

338
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:13,836
mmm, ahh...

339
00:19:18,207 --> 00:19:20,709
why, this is
incredible.

340
00:19:20,744 --> 00:19:24,463
You haven't looked that way
since you were 30 years old.

341
00:19:24,498 --> 00:19:28,217
That's fantastic,
it's absolutely fantastic.

342
00:19:28,252 --> 00:19:31,353
I keep getting younger.

343
00:19:31,388 --> 00:19:33,856
If i keep going at this rate,
i'll be drafted.

344
00:19:35,142 --> 00:19:36,975
If you don't stop,
we may be in trouble.

345
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,227
Oh!

346
00:19:38,262 --> 00:19:40,112
What do you mean, trouble?
What kind of trouble?

347
00:19:40,147 --> 00:19:41,363
I wish i knew...

348
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,866
how much longer it would go on

349
00:19:43,901 --> 00:19:46,368
or how long
before it stops.

350
00:19:46,403 --> 00:19:48,237
Oh, it's still
going on.

351
00:19:48,871 --> 00:19:50,739
I can feel it.

352
00:19:50,774 --> 00:19:51,990
Harmon?

353
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:55,744
It's still going on,
what... what is...

354
00:19:55,779 --> 00:19:56,995
oh...
harmon?

355
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,498
Harmon, what's
going on with you?

356
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:00,749
What's happening?
Harmon?

357
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:02,634
Leave him go.

358
00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:04,503
I want him
to go to bed.

359
00:20:04,538 --> 00:20:05,754
Go to bed, harmon.

360
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:08,891
Raymond, you tell me
what's happening to him.

361
00:20:08,926 --> 00:20:10,142
Quiet, leave him alone!

362
00:20:10,177 --> 00:20:10,759
What's going on?

363
00:20:11,393 --> 00:20:12,010
Leave him alone.

364
00:20:23,405 --> 00:20:25,274
What is it?

365
00:20:25,309 --> 00:20:27,159
Sit down, flora.

366
00:20:27,194 --> 00:20:28,410
But i want to see him.

367
00:20:28,445 --> 00:20:29,661
You will.

368
00:20:29,696 --> 00:20:30,913
But i don't want you
to wake him.

369
00:20:30,948 --> 00:20:34,666
He's in shock now, and sleep
is precisely what he needs.

370
00:20:34,701 --> 00:20:35,918
I want
to see him right now.

371
00:20:35,953 --> 00:20:37,169
No, not now.

372
00:20:37,204 --> 00:20:38,420
Right now, flora,

373
00:20:38,455 --> 00:20:41,540
as of this moment, you've
got to readjust your life.

374
00:20:41,575 --> 00:20:44,042
What are you
talking about?

375
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:45,928
Look, is this
some kind of a trick?

376
00:20:45,963 --> 00:20:47,796
I want to see harmon,
i want to see my husband.

377
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:50,933
Your husband
is sleeping.

378
00:20:50,968 --> 00:20:54,686
When he wakes up,
he's going to need help.

379
00:20:54,721 --> 00:20:56,555
Help?

380
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:57,806
What kind of help?

381
00:20:57,841 --> 00:20:59,691
I want to see him.

382
00:20:59,726 --> 00:21:02,194
You will.

383
00:21:02,229 --> 00:21:04,696
But i think you'd
best get oriented.

384
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:36,345
Flora, the ground
rules change now.

385
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,596
Now you stay
in your own yard.

386
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:41,350
The world doesn't begin
and end with flora anymore.

387
00:21:41,385 --> 00:21:45,103
It isn't just flora's wishes
and flora's temperament,

388
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:46,989
and flora's
capacity for anger.

389
00:21:47,024 --> 00:21:48,240
Now it's something else.

390
00:21:48,275 --> 00:21:50,108
It's very different.

391
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:52,611
You have a
responsibility now.

392
00:21:52,646 --> 00:21:55,113
And you're going
to honor it.

393
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:58,867
You're going to
take care of harmon.

394
00:21:58,902 --> 00:22:00,752
He's going to need you.

395
00:22:08,912 --> 00:22:12,631
Flora!

396
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:15,767
If you're leaving,
make note of the fact

397
00:22:15,802 --> 00:22:17,636
that what you're wearing
is all that you take with you.

398
00:22:17,671 --> 00:22:20,138
If you think that
i'm going to stay

399
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:22,024
and take care of a grubby,
thumb-sucking little kid...

400
00:22:22,059 --> 00:22:25,143
that's precisely
what you're going to do.

401
00:22:25,178 --> 00:22:27,029
And short of that

402
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:30,782
you leave here
exactly as you arrived:

403
00:22:30,817 --> 00:22:32,651
Unadorned.

404
00:22:32,686 --> 00:22:33,902
All the furs

405
00:22:33,937 --> 00:22:35,153
and the jewelry

406
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:36,405
and anything else
that my brother gave you

407
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,290
remain here.

408
00:22:38,325 --> 00:22:39,541
He can't make me stay here.

409
00:22:39,576 --> 00:22:41,410
You can't make me
stay here, either.

410
00:22:41,445 --> 00:22:43,295
There are other fish
in this ocean, mister.

411
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:45,163
Indeed there are,
but you're not married to them.

412
00:22:45,198 --> 00:22:47,049
You happen to be married
to my brother.

413
00:22:47,084 --> 00:22:49,551
That's crazy.

414
00:22:49,586 --> 00:22:50,419
Crazy?

415
00:22:50,454 --> 00:22:51,670
No. It's bizarre.

416
00:22:51,705 --> 00:22:52,921
And it's a fact.

417
00:22:52,956 --> 00:22:54,806
And if i ever hear
that he's left alone

418
00:22:54,841 --> 00:22:56,675
with nurses, maids
and governesses,

419
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:59,811
you're going to find yourself
right back on the chorus line

420
00:22:59,846 --> 00:23:01,063
do you understand?

421
00:23:01,098 --> 00:23:04,816
He's going to get
some attention now.

422
00:23:04,851 --> 00:23:07,319
And i don't mean just
intimate and sporadic visits

423
00:23:07,354 --> 00:23:09,187
between nightclubs
and beauty parlors.

424
00:23:09,222 --> 00:23:11,690
I mean from morning
till night.

425
00:23:16,078 --> 00:23:18,196
Won't he ever grow?

426
00:23:18,231 --> 00:23:19,581
Oh, yes.

427
00:23:19,616 --> 00:23:22,701
As of right now, he'll grow
a little bit older each day,

428
00:23:22,736 --> 00:23:24,586
like any little boy.

429
00:23:24,621 --> 00:23:27,205
And you'll perform
the process together.

430
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,959
As he grows older,
you'll be growing old.

431
00:23:31,593 --> 00:23:33,595
There's a little
poetic justice, flora:

432
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:36,098
That you should be forced
to drink from the same cup.

433
00:23:36,133 --> 00:23:38,600
And then when
tomorrow comes,

434
00:23:38,635 --> 00:23:41,720
there'll be someone
younger outside

435
00:23:41,755 --> 00:23:43,605
waiting to come in.

436
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:47,359
Always waiting
to come in.

437
00:23:47,394 --> 00:23:50,479
But it isn't fair, raymond.

438
00:23:50,514 --> 00:23:53,615
It just isn't fair.

439
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:55,484
Everything...

440
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:57,986
everything is on his side.

441
00:23:58,987 --> 00:24:01,490
Well, you see, flora,

442
00:24:01,525 --> 00:24:04,626
as you get older,
see how wise you get.

443
00:24:04,661 --> 00:24:07,129
It happens to be a fact.

444
00:24:07,164 --> 00:24:10,248
As one gets older,
one does get wiser.

445
00:24:10,283 --> 00:24:12,134
If you don't believe it,
ask flora.

446
00:24:12,169 --> 00:24:15,253
Ask her any day of
the ensuing weeks of her life

447
00:24:15,288 --> 00:24:18,390
as she takes notes
during the coming years

448
00:24:18,425 --> 00:24:20,258
and realizes that
the worm has turned.

449
00:24:20,293 --> 00:24:22,761
Youth has taken over.

450
00:24:22,796 --> 00:24:25,263
It's simply the way
the calendar crumbles...

451
00:24:25,298 --> 00:24:27,149
in the twilight zone.

452
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:31,319
And now, mr. Serling.

453
00:24:31,354 --> 00:24:35,073
Next time a new author joins the
ranks of the elves and gremlins

454
00:24:35,108 --> 00:24:37,576
who supply the imaginative
material onthe twilight zone.

455
00:24:37,611 --> 00:24:39,444
His name is richard deroy

456
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:41,947
and his story is in the best
tradition of the program.

457
00:24:41,982 --> 00:24:43,198
It stars one of the gentlest,

458
00:24:43,233 --> 00:24:45,700
and certainly the most able
of america's actors,

459
00:24:45,735 --> 00:24:48,837
a beloved little fixture on the
american scene named ed wynn.

460
00:24:48,872 --> 00:24:50,705
Next time out
onthe twilight zone,

461
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:54,459
ed wynn stars in
"90 years without slumbering."
