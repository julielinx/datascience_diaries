1
00:00:06,606 --> 00:00:09,726
You unlock this door
with the key of imagination.

2
00:00:09,761 --> 00:00:12,228
Beyond it is another dimension-

3
00:00:12,263 --> 00:00:13,480
a dimension of sound,

4
00:00:14,149 --> 00:00:15,982
a dimension of sight,

5
00:00:16,017 --> 00:00:18,485
a dimension of mind.

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,621
You're moving into a land
of both shadow and substance,

7
00:00:21,656 --> 00:00:23,490
of things and ideas.

8
00:00:23,525 --> 00:00:27,877
You've just crossed over
into the twilight zone.

9
00:01:28,304 --> 00:01:30,807
Let's get with it,
conklin!

10
00:01:30,842 --> 00:01:32,692
A tight office
is a happy office.

11
00:01:32,727 --> 00:01:37,063
Idle hands make
for an unproductive poop deck.

12
00:01:37,098 --> 00:01:38,948
Belay that,
miss abernathy.

13
00:01:38,983 --> 00:01:41,451
Extraneous activity is
nothing more nor less

14
00:01:41,486 --> 00:01:44,571
than sloppy seamanship,
in a manner of speaking.

15
00:01:44,606 --> 00:01:46,456
You there,
fenstermacher!

16
00:01:46,491 --> 00:01:47,707
Let's keep
an even keel there,

17
00:01:47,742 --> 00:01:48,958
in a manner
of speaking.

18
00:01:48,993 --> 00:01:52,078
Let's keep
an even keel there, man.

19
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:56,466
To all of you...

20
00:01:56,501 --> 00:02:00,220
bear in mind
that we must all of us go aft,

21
00:02:00,255 --> 00:02:04,090
climb up the old mast and,
in a manner of speaking,

22
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:07,844
set our sights
to a distant horizon.

23
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:10,346
Tight ship! A happy ship!

24
00:02:10,381 --> 00:02:12,849
Damn the torpedoes
of competition

25
00:02:12,884 --> 00:02:15,351
and full speed ahead!

26
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,746
Well shot, mr. Conklin.

27
00:02:27,363 --> 00:02:29,249
Right between
captain bligh's eyeballs.

28
00:02:29,284 --> 00:02:32,619
He's an exceptional voice;
my ears are still ringing.

29
00:02:32,654 --> 00:02:35,755
You know, that fat boy
is headed for mutiny?

30
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:38,258
Where would you find a plank
heavy enough to hold him?

31
00:02:38,293 --> 00:02:40,126
When i think of
all the kamikazes

32
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,011
they threw at us
during the war,

33
00:02:42,046 --> 00:02:44,514
wouldn't you think
justonewould
have hithim?

34
00:02:46,417 --> 00:02:48,885
One of these days...

35
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,136
one of these days,
all that noise

36
00:02:50,171 --> 00:02:52,639
is going to come back
and bite him.

37
00:02:52,674 --> 00:02:55,141
I hope i'm around
to see it happen.

38
00:02:55,176 --> 00:02:58,278
This is roswell g. Flemington-

39
00:02:58,313 --> 00:03:02,282
220 pounds of gristle,
lung tissue and sound decibels.

40
00:03:02,317 --> 00:03:06,653
He is, as you have perceived,
a noisy man;

41
00:03:06,688 --> 00:03:09,789
one of a breed who substitutes
volume for substance,

42
00:03:09,824 --> 00:03:11,658
sound for significance,

43
00:03:11,693 --> 00:03:15,411
and shouting to cover up
the readily apparent phenomena

44
00:03:15,446 --> 00:03:16,045
that he is nothing more

45
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:19,165
than an overweight
and aging perennial sea scout

46
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,668
whose noisemaking
is in inverse ratio

47
00:03:21,703 --> 00:03:24,804
to his competence
and to his character.

48
00:03:24,839 --> 00:03:27,307
But soon, our would-be admiral
of the fleet

49
00:03:27,342 --> 00:03:29,809
will embark on another voyage.

50
00:03:29,844 --> 00:03:32,929
This one is an unchartered
and twisting stream

51
00:03:32,964 --> 00:03:37,317
that heads for a distant port
called... the twilight zone.

52
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:25,365
Hello?

53
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,233
Hello?!

54
00:04:27,268 --> 00:04:28,484
Who?

55
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:31,621
Oh, just a moment.
I can't hear you.

56
00:04:31,656 --> 00:04:32,872
Please.

57
00:04:32,907 --> 00:04:35,375
Roswell! Roswell!

58
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,877
Could you turn that down
just a little bit?

59
00:04:37,912 --> 00:04:39,746
I can't hear a thing
on the telephone!

60
00:04:39,781 --> 00:04:42,749
Do you know what that is, madam?

61
00:04:42,784 --> 00:04:44,634
Collector's item.

62
00:04:44,669 --> 00:04:47,754
The actual sounds
of the battleshipmissouri

63
00:04:47,789 --> 00:04:50,256
bombarding okinawa!

64
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:52,892
But i can't hear
who's on the phone!

65
00:04:52,927 --> 00:04:57,897
Lay on, gentlemen,
and let 'em know what's what!

66
00:04:57,932 --> 00:04:59,766
Fire at will!

67
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:01,651
And by the good lord harry,

68
00:05:01,686 --> 00:05:06,022
we'll show them
how the navy treats aggression!

69
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:28,177
And that, madam,
was an act of utter abomination

70
00:05:28,212 --> 00:05:30,046
and the most callous vandalism.

71
00:05:30,081 --> 00:05:31,931
May i remind you

72
00:05:31,966 --> 00:05:34,434
that those were
the actual sounds

73
00:05:34,469 --> 00:05:37,553
of the battleshipmissouri
bombarding okinawa?!

74
00:05:37,588 --> 00:05:39,439
And there were
only 100

75
00:05:39,474 --> 00:05:41,941
such records in existence.

76
00:05:41,976 --> 00:05:45,061
Now there are only 99.

77
00:05:45,096 --> 00:05:49,449
What you have done, madam,
is an act of desecration

78
00:05:49,484 --> 00:05:55,071
not unlike the defacing
of a statue of john paul jones.

79
00:05:55,204 --> 00:05:58,958
What are you, madam,
some sort of a fanatic?

80
00:05:58,993 --> 00:06:00,827
Roswell, we've had
this out before.

81
00:06:00,862 --> 00:06:04,580
What was once an
idiosyncracy of yours

82
00:06:04,615 --> 00:06:06,466
is now an obsession.

83
00:06:06,501 --> 00:06:08,968
This-this insistence
on blaring noises

84
00:06:09,003 --> 00:06:10,219
and running a household

85
00:06:10,254 --> 00:06:13,339
like it was a destroyer
escort on convoy duty-

86
00:06:13,374 --> 00:06:15,842
the combination has now
become quite impossible,

87
00:06:15,877 --> 00:06:18,344
and i can't live with it.

88
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:19,595
Stand, madam!

89
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:23,733
Oh, knock it off, roswell.

90
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,602
You are an insufferable,
noisy clown,

91
00:06:26,637 --> 00:06:28,488
but you are not stupid!

92
00:06:28,523 --> 00:06:30,356
I have had
you up to here,

93
00:06:30,391 --> 00:06:32,241
and my ears
have had you,

94
00:06:32,276 --> 00:06:34,110
and my stomach
lining has had you,

95
00:06:34,145 --> 00:06:35,361
and whatever
part of the brain

96
00:06:35,396 --> 00:06:36,612
that keeps a
person balanced-

97
00:06:37,246 --> 00:06:38,498
that's had you, too.

98
00:06:38,533 --> 00:06:41,000
In short, roswell,
ihave had you!

99
00:06:41,035 --> 00:06:45,121
I am absolutely and completely
thunderstruck!

100
00:06:45,156 --> 00:06:45,755
Are you, now?

101
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:48,257
I am, indeed.

102
00:06:48,292 --> 00:06:52,011
My own wife-
and after 20 years!

103
00:06:52,046 --> 00:06:56,382
20 years ago, roswell,
i wasn't taken in marriage.

104
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:58,267
I waspipedaboard.

105
00:06:58,302 --> 00:07:01,888
And after 20 years,
the shrill piping

106
00:07:01,923 --> 00:07:04,390
has become absolutely
unbearable.

107
00:07:04,425 --> 00:07:07,527
So, at this point, roswell,
i'm leaving,

108
00:07:07,562 --> 00:07:11,280
in a manner of speaking,
the ship's company!

109
00:07:11,315 --> 00:07:14,400
You're deserting me!

110
00:07:14,435 --> 00:07:18,154
In a manner of speaking,
roswell, you said it!

111
00:07:44,814 --> 00:07:47,934
It wasn't locked,
roswell.

112
00:07:49,185 --> 00:07:52,321
It might interest
you to know, madam,

113
00:07:52,356 --> 00:07:54,824
that when i was
a young chap,

114
00:07:54,859 --> 00:07:57,326
i had a mother who
insisted she was ill.

115
00:07:57,944 --> 00:08:02,331
She was a whiny, petulant,
complaining female

116
00:08:02,366 --> 00:08:04,200
similar to yourself.

117
00:08:04,235 --> 00:08:07,336
And when i would come
home from school,

118
00:08:07,371 --> 00:08:11,090
she would make me walk tiptoe
and whisper.

119
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:15,461
Whisper... whisper... whisper.

120
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:18,598
You know, in our house,

121
00:08:18,633 --> 00:08:21,100
we never had any cookies.

122
00:08:21,135 --> 00:08:24,220
All we had were fudge brownies,

123
00:08:24,255 --> 00:08:28,608
because they made less noise
when you chewed them.

124
00:08:28,643 --> 00:08:29,859
"Eat your brownie

125
00:08:29,894 --> 00:08:32,361
"and run upstairs and change,

126
00:08:32,396 --> 00:08:35,481
but keep it quiet."

127
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:39,235
And i tell you, madam,
i had quite enough of that!

128
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:41,737
And that is why
i went to sea!

129
00:08:41,772 --> 00:08:44,874
And that is why
i've spent my life

130
00:08:44,909 --> 00:08:49,245
in the very wholesome, healthy
and quite understandable pursuit

131
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,130
of the free and the unfettered.

132
00:08:51,165 --> 00:08:53,633
And that is why
i am the owner,

133
00:08:53,668 --> 00:08:57,386
manager, chairman of the board
and president

134
00:08:57,421 --> 00:09:00,506
of the roswell g. Flemington
model ship company-

135
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:03,009
second to none in the field!

136
00:09:03,044 --> 00:09:06,145
Whose motto is,
"damn the torpedoes,

137
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:09,265
full steam ahead
for fun and profits."

138
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,767
I know the company, i know
the president, i know the motto.

139
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:14,904
And i respond,
mr. Roswell g. Flemington,

140
00:09:14,939 --> 00:09:16,772
with the following
nautical phrase

141
00:09:17,406 --> 00:09:20,526
whichihave now taken to heart
and will proceed to implement.

142
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:24,280
The phrase is,
"lay aft, and dump the garbage!"

143
00:09:24,315 --> 00:09:25,531
So, in a manner
of speaking,

144
00:09:25,915 --> 00:09:28,417
consider yourself
dumped!

145
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:47,687
"Flight deck sounds of aircraft

146
00:09:47,722 --> 00:09:50,189
leaving the carrierhornet."

147
00:10:03,319 --> 00:10:04,570
Good riddance, madam!

148
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:06,455
I have never liked you.

149
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:08,324
I have simply suffered you.

150
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:19,872
Well?

151
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:24,877
Nothing abnormal,
mr. Flemington.

152
00:12:24,912 --> 00:12:27,379
No excess wax, no
obstruction of any kind,

153
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:29,265
no inflammation.

154
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,133
By the great lord harry,

155
00:12:31,168 --> 00:12:33,018
candor dictates, doctor,
that i tell you

156
00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:36,772
that as a ship's surgeon,
you wouldn't make a cabin boy

157
00:12:36,807 --> 00:12:38,641
in a manner of speaking.

158
00:12:38,676 --> 00:12:41,143
Frankly, i
think consulting
another physician

159
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:43,028
might be an extremely
practical idea.

160
00:12:43,063 --> 00:12:45,531
I only wish you'd had a modicum
of professional ethics

161
00:12:45,566 --> 00:12:48,033
and given me this advice
before you went through

162
00:12:48,068 --> 00:12:50,536
the motions of this
perfunctory examination.

163
00:12:50,571 --> 00:12:52,905
As it is, i shall be
dunned with your bill

164
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,407
as well as the bill of
another ear specialist.

165
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:57,910
In point of fact,
mr. Flemington,

166
00:12:57,945 --> 00:13:01,664
i wasn't going to recommend
another ear specialist.

167
00:13:01,699 --> 00:13:04,800
Now, i had in mind
perhaps some, uh, well...

168
00:13:04,835 --> 00:13:06,669
some psychiatric help.

169
00:13:08,804 --> 00:13:12,558
I presume you
are being humorous, sir.

170
00:13:13,175 --> 00:13:15,678
It is only that
charitable outlook

171
00:13:15,713 --> 00:13:18,814
that prevents your
being called to accounts.

172
00:13:18,849 --> 00:13:20,683
Psychiatrist, eh?

173
00:13:20,718 --> 00:13:23,185
Well, let me
tell you, doctor-

174
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,688
and i use
the term loosely-

175
00:13:25,723 --> 00:13:28,691
there are few people
walking this earth

176
00:13:28,726 --> 00:13:30,576
as sane as i am.

177
00:13:30,611 --> 00:13:33,195
I bid you good day, sir.

178
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,697
Good day.

179
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:51,347
What do you suppose
happened to lardhead?

180
00:13:51,382 --> 00:13:52,598
Count your blessings, honey.

181
00:13:52,633 --> 00:13:53,215
I've been here four years,

182
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,100
and this is the first
time he's been late.

183
00:13:55,718 --> 00:13:56,969
Wouldn't it be
marvelous if his car

184
00:13:57,004 --> 00:13:58,854
fell off the ferryboat
with him in it?

185
00:13:58,889 --> 00:14:02,608
The millennium, the
absolute millennium.

186
00:14:03,894 --> 00:14:06,362
Thus endeth the dream.

187
00:14:06,397 --> 00:14:08,864
Good morning, mr. Flem-

188
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:20,125
i've been here five years
and that's the first time

189
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,994
he's walked in
without telling me

190
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:23,879
that the smoking lamp
was not lit

191
00:14:23,914 --> 00:14:25,748
and that we had to move
full speed ahead

192
00:14:25,783 --> 00:14:27,633
toward the shores
of prosperity.

193
00:14:27,668 --> 00:14:30,135
Maybe he's sick.

194
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:33,255
Something incurable,
like barnacles on the brain.

195
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:33,889
Very good.

196
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:36,392
Conklin, get out your darts.

197
00:14:36,427 --> 00:14:39,511
Only forget the portrait-
shoot for the record.

198
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:43,265
That's odd.

199
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,150
Very odd.

200
00:14:45,185 --> 00:14:46,402
I've been here ten years

201
00:14:46,437 --> 00:14:50,155
and that's the first time
i've seen him look frightened.

202
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:22,054
Let's keep it
quiet out here.

203
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:23,939
I was just...

204
00:15:34,316 --> 00:15:37,453
with your permission,
mr. Flemington,

205
00:15:37,488 --> 00:15:39,321
new shoes.

206
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:41,206
What have you
got in them,

207
00:15:41,241 --> 00:15:43,075
pipe organs?

208
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,960
This ship has
got to shape up.

209
00:15:44,995 --> 00:15:46,829
Repeat- shape up.

210
00:15:46,864 --> 00:15:49,331
Noise is
not efficiency.

211
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:51,216
Let's secure now.

212
00:15:51,251 --> 00:15:53,085
And watch this noise.

213
00:15:54,336 --> 00:15:55,587
Yes, sir.

214
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:07,599
Unless i'm very much mistaken,

215
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:11,353
it is one of those very odd
phenomena, aural suggestion.

216
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:14,857
A person talks himself
into believing occurrences

217
00:16:14,892 --> 00:16:17,359
when they are
figments of imagination.

218
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:20,496
Beyond that, there is
definitely some suggestion

219
00:16:20,531 --> 00:16:22,998
that you are
resentful of your mother.

220
00:16:23,033 --> 00:16:26,752
And have a preoccupation
with her imaginary ailments.

221
00:16:26,787 --> 00:16:28,504
My guess for the moment

222
00:16:28,539 --> 00:16:32,875
would be that this feeling
extended itself to your wife

223
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:36,628
who provided you with
a similar mother image.

224
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:39,882
But i can tell you this,
mr. Flemington,

225
00:16:39,917 --> 00:16:42,384
and forgive me
if i repeat myself:

226
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:46,138
These occurrences are pure
figments of imagination.

227
00:16:50,526 --> 00:16:52,394
I believe
that, doctor.

228
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:54,897
Now, snap your fingers.

229
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:01,153
Well, do you
think i, uh...

230
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:04,289
go ahead,
snap your fingers.

231
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:08,660
Any abnormal sound?

232
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:10,546
Normal!

233
00:17:10,581 --> 00:17:12,414
Stamp your feet.

234
00:17:18,088 --> 00:17:19,922
Normal again?

235
00:17:19,957 --> 00:17:23,058
Happily, delightfully,
comfortingly normal.

236
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:43,695
You've cured
me, doctor.

237
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,581
By the good lord harry,

238
00:17:45,616 --> 00:17:48,083
if admiral nelson had
had you at trafalgar,

239
00:17:48,118 --> 00:17:51,203
he'd have saved
both his eye and his arm.

240
00:17:51,238 --> 00:17:54,339
In naval parlance,
sir, you're 4.0.

241
00:17:54,374 --> 00:17:57,459
4.0, sir, in a
manner of speaking.

242
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:06,852
That's all right,
mr. Flemington.

243
00:18:06,887 --> 00:18:08,720
Slam it at will,
be my guest.

244
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:12,474
You, sir, have
the soul of a seaman.

245
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:13,725
Bless you.

246
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:22,484
Incredible.

247
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:24,369
Absolutely incredible.

248
00:18:24,404 --> 00:18:26,238
Mind over matter.

249
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:28,123
My wife obviously the culprit

250
00:18:28,158 --> 00:18:30,626
a miserable preoccupation
with noise

251
00:18:30,661 --> 00:18:33,128
literally planted
the seed in my head.

252
00:18:33,163 --> 00:18:36,248
Incredible what
one crew member can do

253
00:18:36,283 --> 00:18:38,133
to a whole ship's company.

254
00:18:38,168 --> 00:18:41,253
And the whole business,
mind over matter.

255
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,656
Madam, you
are not welcome

256
00:19:00,691 --> 00:19:03,158
on this particular
quarter deck.

257
00:19:03,193 --> 00:19:05,661
Nor shall i
stay here, admiral.

258
00:19:05,696 --> 00:19:08,163
I forgot some
of my jewelry.

259
00:19:08,198 --> 00:19:09,414
I will retrieve same

260
00:19:09,449 --> 00:19:12,534
and then, whether you
pipe me ashore or not,

261
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:15,671
that's precisely
where i'll be heading.

262
00:19:15,706 --> 00:19:17,539
And might i add this, madam...

263
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:21,293
despite your efforts
to capsize this worthy vessel,

264
00:19:21,328 --> 00:19:22,544
in a manner of speaking,

265
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:26,298
against the rocks and
hidden shoals of petulance

266
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:29,434
and petty dissatisfaction,
the ship remains tight

267
00:19:29,469 --> 00:19:33,188
and all your efforts,
worthless and wasteful.

268
00:19:33,223 --> 00:19:34,439
Horatio, old pal,

269
00:19:34,474 --> 00:19:38,193
let the following
be my final comments:

270
00:19:38,228 --> 00:19:40,445
You are an overgrown sailor boy

271
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,314
with an undermanned head.

272
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:44,816
You are so full
of incredible neuroses

273
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:47,953
that i wonder that you
haven't cracked before this.

274
00:19:47,988 --> 00:19:50,455
Belay that, madam, belay that.

275
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:54,209
It just so happens i have had
a psychiatric examination,

276
00:19:54,244 --> 00:19:57,329
and if there is one thing
wrong with me, it is you.

277
00:19:57,364 --> 00:19:59,214
It is simply you.

278
00:19:59,249 --> 00:20:00,582
And furthermore, madam,

279
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:02,467
i can tell you
one other thing:

280
00:20:03,085 --> 00:20:06,221
The whole business
is mind over matter.

281
00:20:06,256 --> 00:20:10,592
Totally and absolutely
mind over matter.

282
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:14,346
Do you know what
i can do to you?

283
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:16,848
I can shut you off.

284
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:18,734
Do you realize that?

285
00:20:18,769 --> 00:20:22,487
I can literally shut you off

286
00:20:22,522 --> 00:20:25,240
because i am a man
of such incredible will

287
00:20:25,275 --> 00:20:27,743
that i can do
anything i want to do.

288
00:20:27,778 --> 00:20:31,363
Now, go ahead.

289
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:33,865
Yell at me.

290
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,002
Go on, yell at me.

291
00:20:37,037 --> 00:20:39,504
Because even now,
at this moment

292
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:44,509
i am in the process of
exercising mind over matter.

293
00:20:44,544 --> 00:20:47,629
I am shutting you...

294
00:20:47,664 --> 00:20:48,880
out.

295
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:52,634
Flemington, i really
do wonder about you.

296
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:56,388
I wonder why no
one has committed you.

297
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:57,639
I really-

298
00:20:57,674 --> 00:20:59,524
see! See!

299
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:02,027
I have shut you out.

300
00:21:02,062 --> 00:21:04,529
Go on,
talk some more.

301
00:21:05,147 --> 00:21:08,283
Really, roswell,
you do need help.

302
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,403
You really do need help.

303
00:21:14,906 --> 00:21:17,409
Incredible... mind over matter.

304
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:21,163
I want to shut her out,
i simply shut her out.

305
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:24,916
Now, then.

306
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:26,802
What shall we listen to tonight?

307
00:21:29,304 --> 00:21:31,173
"Anchors aweigh"?

308
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:34,309
"Midshipmans' march"?

309
00:21:34,344 --> 00:21:36,178
Let's see.

310
00:21:36,812 --> 00:21:39,314
"Actual sounds
of japanese destroyer

311
00:21:39,349 --> 00:21:41,817
"exploding in lada bay.

312
00:21:41,852 --> 00:21:43,685
"Complete with boiler hissings,

313
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:47,439
fantail cracking
and smokestack exploding."

314
00:21:47,474 --> 00:21:49,941
Great, great.

315
00:22:03,705 --> 00:22:06,208
Better get ready out there.

316
00:22:06,243 --> 00:22:09,094
This will
galvanize you properly.

317
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:38,550
Louder! Louder!

318
00:23:38,585 --> 00:23:41,052
Make more noise.

319
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:42,938
Let's hear it.

320
00:23:42,973 --> 00:23:45,440
Come on, let's hear it.

321
00:23:45,475 --> 00:23:50,195
Louder!

322
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:52,697
When last heard from

323
00:23:52,732 --> 00:23:55,200
mr. Roswell g. Flemington
was in a sanitarium

324
00:23:55,235 --> 00:23:58,320
pleading with the medical staff
to make some noise.

325
00:23:58,355 --> 00:24:02,073
They believed the case
to be a rather tragic aberration

326
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:03,959
a man's mind becoming unhinged.

327
00:24:03,994 --> 00:24:07,712
And for this, they'll give him
pills, therapy and rest.

328
00:24:07,747 --> 00:24:12,083
Little do they realize that all
mr. Flemington is suffering from

329
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:13,969
is a case of poetic justice.

330
00:24:14,004 --> 00:24:16,471
Tonight's tale
of sounds and silences

331
00:24:16,506 --> 00:24:18,974
from the twilight zone.

332
00:24:21,526 --> 00:24:23,311
And now, mr. Serling.

333
00:24:23,346 --> 00:24:24,563
Next time out on
the twilight zone

334
00:24:24,598 --> 00:24:27,682
we move in to a very dark corner
of the odd and the unpredictable

335
00:24:27,717 --> 00:24:28,934
with a story called
"caesar and me."

336
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:30,819
It's written
by adele t. Strassfield,

337
00:24:31,436 --> 00:24:33,321
and it stars one of
the most talented young men

338
00:24:33,356 --> 00:24:35,824
on the acting scene today,
jackie cooper.

339
00:24:35,859 --> 00:24:38,944
Here's one that may stay with
you after the lights are out.

340
00:24:38,979 --> 00:24:40,829
It's a story of a ventriloquist
and his dummy,

341
00:24:40,864 --> 00:24:43,331
and this one is designed
for the cold chills

342
00:24:43,366 --> 00:24:45,834
and the hot fevers.
