1
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,862
You're traveling
through another dimension-

2
00:00:12,897 --> 00:00:15,982
a dimension not only of sight
and sound, but of mind.

3
00:00:16,017 --> 00:00:17,867
A journey into a wondrous land

4
00:00:17,902 --> 00:00:20,370
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

5
00:00:20,405 --> 00:00:22,238
That's the signpost up ahead.

6
00:00:22,273 --> 00:00:24,374
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

7
00:01:04,414 --> 00:01:06,282
Thank you, william.

8
00:01:06,317 --> 00:01:07,534
Yes, sir.

9
00:01:07,569 --> 00:01:08,168
Cut.

10
00:01:08,203 --> 00:01:09,419
What's your point?

11
00:01:09,454 --> 00:01:10,670
That, if it were possible

12
00:01:10,705 --> 00:01:12,539
for a person
to go back in time,

13
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:15,041
there'd be nothing in
the world to prevent them

14
00:01:15,076 --> 00:01:16,926
from altering the course
of history? Is that it?

15
00:01:16,961 --> 00:01:18,178
That's right.

16
00:01:18,213 --> 00:01:19,179
Let's say, corrigan,

17
00:01:19,214 --> 00:01:21,047
that you go
back in time.

18
00:01:21,082 --> 00:01:22,298
It's october, 1929,

19
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:24,801
the day before the
stock market crashed.

20
00:01:24,836 --> 00:01:27,303
Now, you know that,
on the following morning,

21
00:01:27,338 --> 00:01:29,806
securities are going
to tumble into an abyss.

22
00:01:29,841 --> 00:01:31,691
Now, using this
prior knowledge,

23
00:01:31,726 --> 00:01:33,560
there's a hundred
things you could do

24
00:01:33,595 --> 00:01:34,811
to protect yourself.

25
00:01:34,846 --> 00:01:36,062
But i'd be
an anachronism.

26
00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:37,947
I really don't
belong back there.

27
00:01:37,982 --> 00:01:40,450
You could sell out the
day before the crash.

28
00:01:40,485 --> 00:01:42,952
But what if i did,
and started the crash earlier?

29
00:01:42,987 --> 00:01:46,072
Now, history tells us that
on october 24, 1929,

30
00:01:46,107 --> 00:01:48,575
the bottom fell out
of the stock market.

31
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:50,460
That's a fixed date.

32
00:01:50,495 --> 00:01:53,079
It exists as an event
in the history of our times.

33
00:01:53,114 --> 00:01:54,464
It can't be altered.

34
00:01:54,499 --> 00:01:55,715
And i say it can.

35
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,218
Now, what's
to prevent me, say,

36
00:01:58,253 --> 00:01:59,469
from going to a broker

37
00:01:59,504 --> 00:02:01,971
on the morning of
october 23 or 22?

38
00:02:02,006 --> 00:02:05,725
Witness a theoretical argument,
washington, d.c., the present.

39
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,594
Four intelligent men talking

40
00:02:07,629 --> 00:02:11,347
about an improbable thing
like going back in time.

41
00:02:11,382 --> 00:02:14,484
A friendly debate
revolving around a simple issue:

42
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:17,604
Could a human being change
what has happened before?

43
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:19,489
Interesting and theoretical

44
00:02:19,524 --> 00:02:22,609
because who ever heard
of a man going back in time?

45
00:02:22,644 --> 00:02:25,111
Before tonight, that is.

46
00:02:25,146 --> 00:02:28,248
Because this
is the twilight zone.

47
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,171
Gentlemen, i'm afraid

48
00:02:35,206 --> 00:02:37,040
i'm going to have
to leave time travel

49
00:02:37,075 --> 00:02:38,291
to h.g. Wells.

50
00:02:38,326 --> 00:02:39,542
I'm much too tired

51
00:02:39,577 --> 00:02:42,045
to go into any more
metaphysics this evening.

52
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,547
And, since no one
has ever gone back into time,

53
00:02:44,582 --> 00:02:47,050
i find the whole blame subject
much too theoretical anyway.

54
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:51,437
Phil, i'll probably
see you over the weekend.

55
00:02:51,472 --> 00:02:53,940
Don't get lost back
in time, now, corrigan.

56
00:02:53,975 --> 00:02:55,191
I certainly shall not.

57
00:02:55,226 --> 00:02:57,060
Good night, gentlemen.

58
00:02:57,095 --> 00:02:57,694
Good night, pete.

59
00:02:58,311 --> 00:02:58,945
So long,
corrigan.

60
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,447
Well, where do
we get a fourth?

61
00:03:09,072 --> 00:03:10,323
Good evening.

62
00:03:16,713 --> 00:03:17,964
I'm desperately sorry,
mr. Corrigan.

63
00:03:17,999 --> 00:03:19,832
That was
very clumsy of me.

64
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:22,335
I think i shall survive,
william. I really do.

65
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:23,836
Did you... did you
have a coat, sir?

66
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:26,973
No. I'm rushing the season
a little tonight, william.

67
00:03:27,008 --> 00:03:30,093
I felt spring in the air,
so i came out like this.

68
00:03:30,128 --> 00:03:31,344
Well, april
isspring, sir.

69
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:33,096
What is the date,
william?

70
00:03:33,131 --> 00:03:34,347
Uh... april 14, sir.

71
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:38,101
April 14, 1961, right?

72
00:03:38,136 --> 00:03:39,485
I beg your pardon, sir?

73
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,737
Oh, yes, 1961.

74
00:03:40,772 --> 00:03:41,988
Well, good night, william.

75
00:03:42,023 --> 00:03:43,239
Take care of yourself.

76
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:45,108
Yes, sir.

77
00:04:41,914 --> 00:04:43,800
Home.

78
00:04:43,835 --> 00:04:46,302
Home. That's it.

79
00:04:46,337 --> 00:04:49,422
I'll go home...

80
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,111
all right, all right.

81
00:05:45,146 --> 00:05:48,231
Have a bit of patience.
I'm coming.

82
00:05:48,266 --> 00:05:49,482
Yes?

83
00:05:53,236 --> 00:05:54,487
Oh, i'm sorry.

84
00:05:54,522 --> 00:05:56,989
Isn't this number 19
12th street?

85
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:57,623
That's right.

86
00:05:57,658 --> 00:05:59,492
Whom do you wish to see?

87
00:06:01,377 --> 00:06:03,246
I used to live here.

88
00:06:03,281 --> 00:06:07,633
This... this used to
be the oldest building

89
00:06:07,668 --> 00:06:10,136
in this part of town.

90
00:06:10,171 --> 00:06:12,004
What's that?

91
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:15,758
Well, that is, as i remember it,
it used to be.

92
00:06:15,793 --> 00:06:16,893
Now, look here, young man.

93
00:06:16,928 --> 00:06:19,395
I can't stand around
all evening

94
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,646
talking about
silly things

95
00:06:20,681 --> 00:06:23,766
like which is the oldest
building in the section.

96
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,903
Now, if there's
nothing else...

97
00:06:26,938 --> 00:06:28,771
do you have a room?

98
00:06:28,806 --> 00:06:31,908
Yes, i have rooms
for acceptable boarders.

99
00:06:31,943 --> 00:06:34,410
Do you come from around here?

100
00:06:34,445 --> 00:06:35,661
Yes, i do.

101
00:06:35,696 --> 00:06:37,530
Army veteran?

102
00:06:37,565 --> 00:06:39,415
Yes...

103
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:41,918
yes, as a matter of fact, i am.

104
00:06:41,953 --> 00:06:45,037
May i inquire
as to what business you're in?

105
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:46,289
I'm an engineer.

106
00:06:46,324 --> 00:06:48,174
Oh, really?

107
00:06:48,209 --> 00:06:49,425
A professional man.

108
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:52,545
Well, right upstairs
and to the right.

109
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:57,550
Good evening, mrs. Landers.

110
00:06:57,585 --> 00:06:58,801
Good evening.

111
00:06:58,836 --> 00:07:00,052
Off to the play?

112
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:01,938
Yes. Dinner, and then
off to the play.

113
00:07:01,973 --> 00:07:03,806
Well, enjoy yourselves.

114
00:07:03,841 --> 00:07:05,691
Applaud the president
for me.

115
00:07:05,726 --> 00:07:06,943
We'll certainly
do that.

116
00:07:06,978 --> 00:07:08,811
Good night.
Have a good time.

117
00:07:13,816 --> 00:07:15,067
What did you say?

118
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:16,319
Well... what did i say?

119
00:07:16,354 --> 00:07:19,455
To the officer. You
said something to him.

120
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:21,324
She just said
something to you

121
00:07:21,359 --> 00:07:22,575
about the president.

122
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:24,460
She told me
to applaud him.

123
00:07:24,495 --> 00:07:26,329
Where might your
sympathies lie?

124
00:07:26,364 --> 00:07:29,465
Yes, young man,
which army were you in?

125
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,217
Well, i was in...

126
00:07:31,252 --> 00:07:32,468
the army of the republic, of course.

127
00:07:32,503 --> 00:07:34,337
Well, then why
make such a thing

128
00:07:34,372 --> 00:07:36,222
of applauding
president lincoln?

129
00:07:36,257 --> 00:07:37,473
It's his due,
we figure.

130
00:07:37,508 --> 00:07:39,842
That and everything else,
god bless him.

131
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:41,727
You're going to a play tonight?

132
00:07:41,762 --> 00:07:44,230
We may or may not,
depending on when my husband

133
00:07:44,265 --> 00:07:45,982
makes up his mind
to call a carriage

134
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:48,484
to get us to the theater
and to dinner.

135
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:49,735
What theater?
What play?

136
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:50,987
Well, ford's theater,
of course.

137
00:07:51,022 --> 00:07:55,992
Ford's theater...

138
00:07:56,027 --> 00:07:57,860
are you all right?

139
00:07:57,895 --> 00:07:59,745
Are you feeling
all right?

140
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,614
What's the name of the play?

141
00:08:01,649 --> 00:08:03,499
I beg
your pardon?

142
00:08:03,534 --> 00:08:05,368
The play- the one you're going
to tonight at ford's theater-

143
00:08:05,403 --> 00:08:07,253
what's
it called?

144
00:08:07,288 --> 00:08:09,121
It's calledour american cousin.

145
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:11,624
Our american cousin...

146
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:13,509
and lincoln's
going to be there.

147
00:08:16,012 --> 00:08:20,016
And it's april 14, 1865,
isn't it?

148
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:22,635
Really, sir,
i'd call these actions

149
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:25,137
most strange.

150
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:28,891
Itisapril 14, 1865.

151
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,541
Let me in! Let me in!

152
00:08:45,576 --> 00:08:48,044
The president's going
to be shot tonight!

153
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:50,546
Let me in!

154
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:03,676
Now, what has
this one done?

155
00:09:03,711 --> 00:09:05,311
While you idiots
are sitting here,

156
00:09:05,346 --> 00:09:06,562
you're going to
lose a president.

157
00:09:06,597 --> 00:09:07,813
That's what
he's been yelling

158
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:09,682
all the way over
to the station.

159
00:09:09,717 --> 00:09:12,818
And that's why the doorman at ford's
theater popped him on the head.

160
00:09:12,853 --> 00:09:14,687
He tried to pound his way
right through the stage door,

161
00:09:14,722 --> 00:09:15,938
yelling some sort
of nonsense

162
00:09:16,572 --> 00:09:19,075
about "president lincoln's
going to be shot."

163
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:21,577
President lincoln will be
shot, tonight, at the theater.

164
00:09:21,612 --> 00:09:22,828
A man named booth.

165
00:09:22,863 --> 00:09:24,697
And how would you
be knowing this?

166
00:09:24,732 --> 00:09:27,199
Are you some kind of a
clairvoyant or something?

167
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:29,085
I only know what i know.

168
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,204
If i told you how i knew,
you wouldn't believe me.

169
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:33,456
Look...

170
00:09:33,491 --> 00:09:35,341
keep me here
if you like-

171
00:09:35,376 --> 00:09:37,209
lock me up-
but hear me out.

172
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:38,461
Let him sleep it off.

173
00:09:38,496 --> 00:09:39,712
Somebody better get

174
00:09:39,747 --> 00:09:41,597
to the president's box
at the theater.

175
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:43,466
Keep him out of there!

176
00:09:43,501 --> 00:09:44,717
Put a cordon of men
around him!

177
00:09:44,752 --> 00:09:46,602
A man named
john wilkes booth

178
00:09:46,637 --> 00:09:48,471
is going to assassinate
him tonight!

179
00:09:58,614 --> 00:10:00,483
Wellington, sergeant.

180
00:10:00,518 --> 00:10:02,868
Jonathan wellington.

181
00:10:02,903 --> 00:10:05,988
Well... and what can we do
for you, mr. Wellington?

182
00:10:06,622 --> 00:10:08,491
That man you just
had incarcerated-

183
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:11,627
mr. Corrigan, i believe
you said his name was?

184
00:10:11,662 --> 00:10:12,878
Drunk, sir.

185
00:10:12,913 --> 00:10:14,747
That's probably
what he is.

186
00:10:14,782 --> 00:10:16,632
Drunk or... or perhaps ill.

187
00:10:16,667 --> 00:10:20,386
I wonder if he might be
remanded in my custody?

188
00:10:20,421 --> 00:10:22,888
He might well be a war veteran.

189
00:10:22,923 --> 00:10:26,008
I would hate to see him
placed in jail.

190
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:28,511
You say you want us
to remand him in your custody?

191
00:10:28,546 --> 00:10:29,145
Precisely.

192
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:31,647
I'll be fully responsible
for him.

193
00:10:31,682 --> 00:10:34,767
I think perhaps
i might be able to help him.

194
00:10:34,802 --> 00:10:36,018
All right, sir,

195
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:37,903
if that's the way
you'd like it.

196
00:10:38,521 --> 00:10:39,772
Have corrigan
brought back in here.

197
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:42,274
This gentleman is going
to look out for him.

198
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:44,777
That's real decent of you,
sir. Real decent of you.

199
00:10:44,812 --> 00:10:46,028
I'll be outside.

200
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:47,913
Have him brought out to me,
if you would?

201
00:10:47,948 --> 00:10:50,416
I will indeed,
sir. Yes.

202
00:11:02,178 --> 00:11:04,046
Uh... about that
corrigan, sir.

203
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:05,297
What about him?

204
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:07,800
Well, wouldn't it
be wise, sir, if...?

205
00:11:07,835 --> 00:11:10,302
If what?

206
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:12,688
He seemed so positive, sir.
So sure.

207
00:11:12,723 --> 00:11:14,557
About the president, i mean.

208
00:11:14,592 --> 00:11:15,808
And what
should we do-

209
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:17,059
send all
available police

210
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:18,310
to ford's
theater?

211
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:19,562
And on what
authority?

212
00:11:20,196 --> 00:11:22,064
On the word
of some demented fool

213
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:24,567
who probably left his mind
in gettysburg?

214
00:11:24,602 --> 00:11:25,201
If i were
you, mister,

215
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:27,703
i'd be considerably
more thoughtful

216
00:11:27,738 --> 00:11:28,954
in sizing up
a situation

217
00:11:28,989 --> 00:11:30,206
or you'll
not advance

218
00:11:30,241 --> 00:11:31,457
in the next
20 years.

219
00:11:31,492 --> 00:11:33,325
Now, be good enough
to step aside

220
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,710
so i can get on
with my work.

221
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:36,579
Sergeant,
it wouldn't hurt if...

222
00:11:36,614 --> 00:11:37,830
it wouldn't
hurt if what?

223
00:11:37,865 --> 00:11:39,715
Well, i only meant
to suggest, sir,

224
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,584
that if perhaps
we placed an extra guard

225
00:11:41,619 --> 00:11:43,469
in the box
with the president...

226
00:11:43,504 --> 00:11:44,720
the president
has enough guards!

227
00:11:44,755 --> 00:11:47,223
The whole federal army
is at his disposal.

228
00:11:47,258 --> 00:11:49,725
And, if they're satisfied
with the arrangements

229
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,976
for his protection, so am i!

230
00:11:51,011 --> 00:11:52,845
So should you.

231
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:25,628
Here.

232
00:12:25,663 --> 00:12:27,513
Try this.

233
00:12:27,548 --> 00:12:30,015
It'll make you
feel better.

234
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:40,643
Better?

235
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:43,779
Who are you anyway?

236
00:12:43,814 --> 00:12:46,899
At the moment,
i'm your benefactor.

237
00:12:46,934 --> 00:12:49,401
Apparently,
your only friend.

238
00:12:53,789 --> 00:12:55,658
I'm in the
government service.

239
00:12:55,693 --> 00:12:57,543
But, as a young man
in college,

240
00:12:57,578 --> 00:12:59,411
i dabbled in
medicine of a sort.

241
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:00,663
Medicine?

242
00:13:01,297 --> 00:13:03,299
Medicine of the mind.

243
00:13:03,334 --> 00:13:07,052
Psychiatrist.

244
00:13:07,087 --> 00:13:08,921
Don't know the term.

245
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:13,309
What about the symptoms?

246
00:13:13,344 --> 00:13:15,177
They do
interest me.

247
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:16,428
This story you were telling

248
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,931
about the president
being assassinated...

249
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:21,433
what time is it?

250
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:22,685
This time?

251
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,570
Half past 7:00.

252
00:13:24,605 --> 00:13:28,324
Play doesn't begin for another
three-quarters of an hour.

253
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:34,580
What gave you the idea...

254
00:13:34,615 --> 00:13:38,951
that the president
would be assassinated?

255
00:13:38,986 --> 00:13:41,704
I just happen to know,
that's all.

256
00:13:41,739 --> 00:13:43,589
You have a premonition?

257
00:13:44,707 --> 00:13:46,592
I've got a devil
of a lot more

258
00:13:46,627 --> 00:13:47,843
than a premonition.

259
00:13:47,878 --> 00:13:49,712
Lincolnwill
be assassinated

260
00:13:49,747 --> 00:13:52,214
unless somebody
tries to prevent it.

261
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:53,465
I shall try
to prevent it

262
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,717
if you
can convince me

263
00:13:54,752 --> 00:13:56,602
that you're neither
drunk nor insane.

264
00:13:56,637 --> 00:13:58,470
If i told you what i was,

265
00:13:58,505 --> 00:13:59,722
you'd be convinced
i was insane,

266
00:14:00,356 --> 00:14:02,224
so all i'm going
to tell you is this:

267
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:03,475
I happen to know
for a fact

268
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,978
that a man named
john wilkes booth

269
00:14:06,013 --> 00:14:07,863
will assassinate
president lincoln

270
00:14:07,898 --> 00:14:09,732
in his box
at ford's theater.

271
00:14:09,767 --> 00:14:12,234
I don't know what time
it'll happen.

272
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:13,485
That's something i forgot.

273
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,371
Something
you forgot?

274
00:14:15,406 --> 00:14:16,238
Yes, listen, i...

275
00:14:16,273 --> 00:14:19,375
here. That hasn't
been treated properly.

276
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:20,626
You'd best cover it.

277
00:14:20,661 --> 00:14:21,877
That's odd.

278
00:14:21,912 --> 00:14:23,128
What is?

279
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,882
Suddenly, i feel faint.

280
00:14:26,917 --> 00:14:29,385
I feel weak,
as if i were...

281
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,253
as if you were what?

282
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:36,258
As if i were...
suddenly drunk or...

283
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:42,765
i've never felt this way before.

284
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,901
I've never... i've ne...

285
00:14:53,909 --> 00:14:55,160
you! You...

286
00:14:55,195 --> 00:14:56,412
you devil.

287
00:14:56,447 --> 00:14:58,280
You drugged me, didn't you?

288
00:14:58,315 --> 00:14:59,531
You drugged me!

289
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:00,783
Had to, my young friend.

290
00:15:00,818 --> 00:15:02,034
You're a very sick man,

291
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:03,919
and a sick man
doesn't belong in jail.

292
00:15:03,954 --> 00:15:06,422
He belongs in a comfortable accommodation

293
00:15:06,457 --> 00:15:07,673
where he can
sleep and rest

294
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:08,924
and regain
his composure-

295
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,293
hisreason.

296
00:15:11,927 --> 00:15:13,929
Rest...

297
00:15:13,964 --> 00:15:16,048
mr. Corrigan.

298
00:15:17,933 --> 00:15:19,802
I'll be
back soon.

299
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:23,305
Please...

300
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:26,442
please, you've
got to believe me.

301
00:15:26,477 --> 00:15:29,812
Lincoln will be shot tonight.

302
00:15:29,847 --> 00:15:31,447
And that's odd...

303
00:15:36,452 --> 00:15:39,571
...because i'm beginning
to believe you.

304
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:43,959
Good night, mr. Corrigan.

305
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:47,079
Rest well.

306
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:03,038
Somebody...

307
00:17:03,073 --> 00:17:04,907
please...

308
00:17:04,942 --> 00:17:06,158
let me out!

309
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:08,043
I know!

310
00:17:10,581 --> 00:17:12,414
I know...

311
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:16,168
our president's
going to be assassinated.

312
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:25,561
No need to break
the door down, officer.

313
00:17:25,596 --> 00:17:26,812
I've got an extra key.

314
00:17:26,847 --> 00:17:29,181
Now, step aside,
if you don't mind.

315
00:17:33,569 --> 00:17:35,437
Are you all right?
What's happened?

316
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:36,688
What time is it?

317
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:37,940
You've got to tell me
what time it is.

318
00:17:38,574 --> 00:17:39,324
It's 10:00.
Come on, corrigan.

319
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:41,193
You've got to tell me
what you know about this.

320
00:17:41,228 --> 00:17:43,695
You may be a madman or a drunk
or i don't know what,

321
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:44,947
but you've got me convinced.

322
00:17:44,982 --> 00:17:46,832
I've been everywhere
from the mayor's office

323
00:17:46,867 --> 00:17:48,083
to the police
commissioner's house

324
00:17:48,118 --> 00:17:49,952
trying to get a special guard
for the president.

325
00:17:49,987 --> 00:17:51,203
Then go yourself.

326
00:17:51,238 --> 00:17:52,454
Find out where
he's sitting,

327
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:54,339
and get right up
alongside of him.

328
00:17:54,374 --> 00:17:55,591
He'll be shot
from behind.

329
00:17:55,626 --> 00:17:57,459
Let me help you up.

330
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:06,218
He was shot from behind.
That's how it happened.

331
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:09,354
Then the assassin jumped
from the box to the stage

332
00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:10,606
and ran out of the wings.

333
00:18:10,641 --> 00:18:11,857
You're telling
me this

334
00:18:11,892 --> 00:18:13,108
as if it has
already happened.

335
00:18:13,143 --> 00:18:15,611
Ithashappened- it happened
a hundred years ago-

336
00:18:15,646 --> 00:18:17,479
and i'm here to see
that itdoesn'thappen.

337
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:19,982
Where's the man who brought
me here? Where's wellington?

338
00:18:20,017 --> 00:18:21,867
Wellington? There's no
one here by that name.

339
00:18:21,902 --> 00:18:23,735
Don't tell me there's
no one here by that name.

340
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,621
He brought me here.
He lives in this room.

341
00:18:25,656 --> 00:18:27,623
There's no one here
by that name.

342
00:18:27,658 --> 00:18:30,125
I tell you, the man
who brought me here's na...

343
00:18:32,127 --> 00:18:33,378
"j.w.b."

344
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:35,881
Of course.

345
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:39,635
Mr. John wilkes booth,
who lives in this room.

346
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:42,137
And that's who
brought you here.

347
00:18:42,172 --> 00:18:44,640
He told me his name
was wellington.

348
00:18:44,675 --> 00:18:47,142
And that's why
he drugged me.

349
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:50,012
He gave me wine,
and he drugged me.

350
00:18:50,047 --> 00:18:51,897
He didn't want me
to stop it.

351
00:18:51,932 --> 00:18:52,764
He's the one
who's going to do it.

352
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,016
You've got to get
to that theater.

353
00:18:54,051 --> 00:18:55,267
You've got to stop him.

354
00:18:55,302 --> 00:18:57,769
John wilkes booth-
he's going to kill lincoln.

355
00:18:57,804 --> 00:18:59,905
Please, you've got
to stop him!

356
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,773
The president's
been shot!

357
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:03,408
An actor
shot lincoln.

358
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,666
Oh...

359
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:16,288
you were
right.

360
00:19:16,323 --> 00:19:17,539
You did
know.

361
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:23,679
Oh, my dear god.

362
00:19:51,073 --> 00:19:52,958
I tried to tell you.

363
00:19:54,209 --> 00:19:56,078
I tried to warn you!

364
00:19:56,113 --> 00:19:57,963
Why didn't you listen?

365
00:19:59,214 --> 00:20:01,717
Why didn't you listen?!

366
00:20:01,752 --> 00:20:04,219
Why didn't you listen to me?!

367
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:18,734
Good evening,
mr. Corrigan.

368
00:20:18,769 --> 00:20:20,602
Did you forget
something?

369
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:21,853
What? Forget something?

370
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:24,356
You left here
just a moment ago

371
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:26,608
and i thought you
forgot something.

372
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:28,493
A moment ago?

373
00:20:28,528 --> 00:20:30,362
Where's william?

374
00:20:30,397 --> 00:20:31,613
William, sir?

375
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:34,116
There's no
william on duty.

376
00:20:34,151 --> 00:20:36,618
There's no one here
named william, sir.

377
00:20:53,769 --> 00:20:55,637
Oh, pete. Back
so soon, eh?

378
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:56,271
Want to join us?

379
00:20:56,306 --> 00:20:58,774
We're talking
about the best ways

380
00:20:58,809 --> 00:21:00,025
of amassing a fortune.

381
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,893
What are your
tried and true methods?

382
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:04,396
You were talking
about time travel-

383
00:21:04,431 --> 00:21:06,281
about going
back in time.

384
00:21:06,316 --> 00:21:09,401
Oh, well, we're on a new tack now:

385
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:12,537
Money, and the best ways to acquire it.

386
00:21:12,572 --> 00:21:14,156
Listen...

387
00:21:14,191 --> 00:21:16,541
i've got something
to tell you.

388
00:21:16,576 --> 00:21:17,793
Why, of course,
old man.

389
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:24,800
You all right?

390
00:21:24,835 --> 00:21:26,918
Why, yes.

391
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:29,421
Yes,
i'm all right.

392
00:21:29,456 --> 00:21:32,557
Well, then, draw up a
chair and come over here

393
00:21:32,592 --> 00:21:33,809
and listen to
a lot of palaver

394
00:21:33,844 --> 00:21:35,060
of self-made
swindlers.

395
00:21:35,095 --> 00:21:37,679
William, here,
has the best method.

396
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:39,181
William?!

397
00:21:39,216 --> 00:21:43,568
Oh, yes, my method for achieving
security is by far the best.

398
00:21:43,603 --> 00:21:45,437
You simply inherit it.

399
00:21:45,472 --> 00:21:47,322
Comes to you
in a beribboned box.

400
00:21:47,357 --> 00:21:49,825
I was just telling
the boys here, corrigan,

401
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:53,578
my great-grandfather was on the
police force here in washington

402
00:21:53,613 --> 00:21:55,447
the night of lincoln's
assassination.

403
00:21:56,698 --> 00:21:57,949
He went all over town

404
00:21:57,984 --> 00:22:01,086
trying to warn people
that something might happen.

405
00:22:01,121 --> 00:22:03,588
How he figured it out,
nobody seems to know.

406
00:22:03,623 --> 00:22:05,457
It's certainly
not recorded anyplace.

407
00:22:05,492 --> 00:22:07,959
But there was
so much publicity about it

408
00:22:07,994 --> 00:22:09,845
that people never forgot him.

409
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,347
He became chief of police,
then a councilman,

410
00:22:12,382 --> 00:22:16,101
did some wheeling and dealing in
land, and became a millionaire.

411
00:22:16,136 --> 00:22:17,219
Well,
gentlemen,

412
00:22:17,254 --> 00:22:19,721
shall we get back
to our bridge?

413
00:22:21,356 --> 00:22:24,476
What was it you wanted
to say, corrigan?

414
00:22:24,511 --> 00:22:26,978
William...

415
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:29,481
william, didn't you
use to work here

416
00:22:29,516 --> 00:22:30,732
as an attendant?

417
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:32,617
Didn't you spill
coffee on me?

418
00:22:39,241 --> 00:22:40,492
Now, listen here, old chum.

419
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:42,377
I was a member of this club

420
00:22:42,412 --> 00:22:45,497
while you were still going
to prep school.

421
00:22:45,532 --> 00:22:46,998
I'm certainly
not a snob,

422
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:49,134
but, well, sir, an attendant?

423
00:22:50,385 --> 00:22:52,254
I really must protest.

424
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:09,654
In the matter of time
travel, gentlemen,

425
00:23:09,689 --> 00:23:12,657
some things can be changed.

426
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:16,027
Others can't.

427
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:19,781
Just as you
say, pete.

428
00:23:19,816 --> 00:23:21,032
Let's see,
i dock.

429
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:22,918
I bid
one spade.

430
00:23:22,953 --> 00:23:25,420
Well, i'll
pass that one.

431
00:23:25,455 --> 00:23:27,289
Here's
two spades.

432
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,425
Looks peaked,
doesn't he?

433
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,676
Acting so strangely.

434
00:23:31,711 --> 00:23:33,545
What's the
matter with him?

435
00:23:41,553 --> 00:23:44,055
Mr. Peter corrigan,
lately returned

436
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:45,941
from a place "back there"-

437
00:23:45,976 --> 00:23:49,060
a journey into time with
highly questionable results.

438
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:50,946
Proving, on one hand,

439
00:23:50,981 --> 00:23:54,065
that the threads of history
are woven tightly,

440
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:57,202
and the skein of events
cannot be undone.

441
00:23:57,237 --> 00:23:59,070
But, on the other hand,

442
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:03,458
there are small fragments of
tapestry that can be altered.

443
00:24:03,493 --> 00:24:05,961
Tonight's thesis,
to be taken as you will,

444
00:24:05,996 --> 00:24:07,829
in the twilight zone.

445
00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:16,221
Rod serling,
creator ofthe twilight zone,

446
00:24:16,256 --> 00:24:18,089
will tell you
about next week's story

447
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:21,193
after this word
from our alternate sponsor.

448
00:24:21,228 --> 00:24:23,145
And now, mr. Serling.

449
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:25,013
This, in the parlance
of the 20th century,

450
00:24:25,048 --> 00:24:28,150
is a used car lot-
a graveyard of active ghosts

451
00:24:28,185 --> 00:24:30,018
who, by virtue of some
exceptional salesmanship

452
00:24:30,053 --> 00:24:32,521
and an indian rubber
stretching of the truth,

453
00:24:32,556 --> 00:24:34,406
remain as commodities
in a world that, by rights,

454
00:24:34,441 --> 00:24:36,274
they should have left
generations ago.

455
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:39,411
Mr. Jack carson plays the role
of a larceny-loaded con man

456
00:24:39,446 --> 00:24:41,913
suddenly prevented
from telling a falsehood.

457
00:24:41,948 --> 00:24:44,416
Next week onthe twilight zone,
a most bizarre tale

458
00:24:44,451 --> 00:24:46,918
that we call "the whole truth."
