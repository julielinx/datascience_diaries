1
00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:11,361
You unlock this door
with the key of imagination.

2
00:00:11,396 --> 00:00:13,229
Beyond it
is another dimension-

3
00:00:13,264 --> 00:00:15,732
a dimension of sound,

4
00:00:15,767 --> 00:00:17,617
a dimension of sight,

5
00:00:17,652 --> 00:00:19,486
a dimension of mind.

6
00:00:19,521 --> 00:00:22,622
You're moving into a land
of both shadow and substance,

7
00:00:22,657 --> 00:00:23,873
of things and ideas.

8
00:00:23,908 --> 00:00:27,627
You've just crossed over
into the twilight zone.

9
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:50,150
Uncle simon?

10
00:00:50,185 --> 00:00:54,771
Uncle simon, do you want
your hot chocolate upstairs?

11
00:00:57,273 --> 00:01:00,410
Uncle simon,
do you hear me?

12
00:01:00,445 --> 00:01:03,530
Do you want your hot
chocolate upstairs?

13
00:01:05,415 --> 00:01:06,666
Uncle simon?!

14
00:01:06,701 --> 00:01:08,535
Garbage-head!

15
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:10,787
I'm right behind you.

16
00:01:10,822 --> 00:01:12,672
There's no need
to yell.

17
00:01:12,707 --> 00:01:17,794
Well, my wilting blossom,
what's on your mind?

18
00:01:20,296 --> 00:01:22,182
Your hot chocolate
is ready.

19
00:01:22,217 --> 00:01:25,301
You told me you were
going to take a nap.

20
00:01:25,336 --> 00:01:27,804
Sometime try extending
yourself, uncle,

21
00:01:27,839 --> 00:01:30,940
just sufficiently
to let me know where
you are on occasion.

22
00:01:30,975 --> 00:01:34,694
Well, barbara, i think
i can narrow that down for you.

23
00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:37,814
If i'm not upstairs in my
bedroom or in the study,

24
00:01:37,849 --> 00:01:39,699
then i'm downstairs
in my laboratory.

25
00:01:39,949 --> 00:01:43,069
Wherever i am, you can bring
the hot chocolate.

26
00:01:43,104 --> 00:01:45,705
And if i'm not...

27
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:48,208
i've dropped dead en route,

28
00:01:48,243 --> 00:01:51,327
and you can bring me a bottle
of formaldehyde and a rose.

29
00:01:51,362 --> 00:01:53,830
You're such a
humorist, uncle.

30
00:01:53,865 --> 00:01:56,332
You should have gone
into burlesque.

31
00:01:56,367 --> 00:02:00,720
Well, i guess i'd have been
more comfortable there than you.

32
00:02:00,755 --> 00:02:03,223
You ever dance, barbara?

33
00:02:03,258 --> 00:02:05,091
I'm very busy,
uncle simon.

34
00:02:05,126 --> 00:02:06,976
You ever cut loose

35
00:02:07,011 --> 00:02:10,096
and dance a fast
charleston?

36
00:02:10,131 --> 00:02:12,599
No, most unlikely,
most unlikely.

37
00:02:12,634 --> 00:02:15,735
You know, you're
the only woman i
know who looks

38
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:19,489
as if underneath
her clothes, she
wore clothes.

39
00:02:19,524 --> 00:02:21,858
You have all the grace
and femininity

40
00:02:21,893 --> 00:02:23,109
of a high-button shoe.

41
00:02:24,994 --> 00:02:26,246
And you, uncle simon...

42
00:02:26,281 --> 00:02:27,497
go on.

43
00:02:27,532 --> 00:02:30,617
Let's see if you can compensate
for the fact

44
00:02:30,652 --> 00:02:33,119
that you're
a passionless vegetable

45
00:02:33,154 --> 00:02:34,621
by speaking
your mind.

46
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:37,123
If i'm a passionless vegetable,

47
00:02:37,158 --> 00:02:41,511
it's because my gardener
is an ancient relic

48
00:02:41,546 --> 00:02:44,631
made out of dry skin
and ice water.

49
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:47,383
Not bad, not bad, not bad.

50
00:02:47,418 --> 00:02:49,886
You know, if i prod you
hard enough,

51
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:51,771
you can scramble up
to the occasion,

52
00:02:51,806 --> 00:02:53,773
or at least part way.

53
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:57,527
Well, my angular turnip,
what else is new with you?

54
00:02:57,562 --> 00:03:01,281
You say you made some
hot chocolate today, hmm?

55
00:03:01,316 --> 00:03:04,150
Any other soul-
stirring projects

56
00:03:04,185 --> 00:03:06,035
you applied
yourself to?

57
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:10,039
I see you tried to open the
drapes in the bedroom and hall.

58
00:03:10,074 --> 00:03:11,908
I see that you
closed them.

59
00:03:11,943 --> 00:03:14,410
You asked me
what i had done today,

60
00:03:14,445 --> 00:03:15,662
and i'm telling you.

61
00:03:15,697 --> 00:03:17,547
I cleaned up after you.

62
00:03:17,582 --> 00:03:20,550
I tried to clear away
some of the debris

63
00:03:20,585 --> 00:03:22,418
you always leave behind.

64
00:03:22,453 --> 00:03:25,555
And what is this
contraption, hmm?

65
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:28,057
A room-straightener,
perhaps?

66
00:03:28,092 --> 00:03:31,678
Tell me, uncle scientist,
where does this belong?

67
00:03:31,713 --> 00:03:33,429
Put it back where it was.

68
00:03:33,464 --> 00:03:34,931
You've been told

69
00:03:34,966 --> 00:03:38,184
a thousand times
not to disturb things.

70
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:41,437
I could have put
it away when i swept
out the cellar,

71
00:03:41,472 --> 00:03:45,825
but as usual, your
laboratory door was
securely bolted.

72
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,694
I would like to find out

73
00:03:47,729 --> 00:03:50,196
what you putter around with
down there.

74
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:54,200
Yeah, i'll bet you would,
and someday you shall.

75
00:03:54,235 --> 00:03:57,954
Someday, you will be owner
of this decaying barn,

76
00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:00,456
and then you can do
as you please.

77
00:04:00,491 --> 00:04:02,842
Until then, keep
your spindle-shanked carcass

78
00:04:02,877 --> 00:04:04,093
out of my laboratory,

79
00:04:04,128 --> 00:04:07,213
and your probing nose
out of my business.

80
00:04:07,248 --> 00:04:10,216
Now, go and get me
some hot chocolate,

81
00:04:10,251 --> 00:04:13,353
and use the english
bone china cup.

82
00:04:13,388 --> 00:04:18,358
If it's not hot enough,
i'll throw it on the floor.

83
00:04:21,477 --> 00:04:24,614
Barbara... question.

84
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:27,116
Go on.

85
00:04:27,151 --> 00:04:29,369
Why do you stay here?

86
00:04:30,987 --> 00:04:34,123
I was under the impression
that i was needed.

87
00:04:34,158 --> 00:04:35,241
You are.

88
00:04:35,276 --> 00:04:38,378
That explains
why i keep you here,

89
00:04:38,413 --> 00:04:42,131
but it doesn't even remotely
suggest why you stay.

90
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:45,501
You would like me to be
quite honest, i presume?

91
00:04:45,536 --> 00:04:49,005
Indeed. You may be short
on beauty,

92
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,256
but a lack of candor

93
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:52,141
has never been
one of your deficiencies.

94
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:55,395
I stay...

95
00:04:55,430 --> 00:05:00,400
i live for the moment
when i can see you buried.

96
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:03,519
When i come back
from your funeral,

97
00:05:03,554 --> 00:05:06,022
i'm going to open
a bottle of wine.

98
00:05:07,657 --> 00:05:10,410
I want to be compensated,
uncle simon,

99
00:05:10,445 --> 00:05:14,163
for 25 years
of being shrieked at,

100
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:19,285
insulted, berated, humiliated

101
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:23,673
and stepped on like an old rug.

102
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:26,793
Is that sufficiently honest
for you?

103
00:05:28,463 --> 00:05:32,181
Well, i wish you well,
my good and faithful barbara.

104
00:05:32,216 --> 00:05:34,684
But unasked, i offer you
this observation:

105
00:05:34,719 --> 00:05:38,438
If you had an ounce of gristle
or an inch of intestines,

106
00:05:38,473 --> 00:05:40,940
you'd have murdered me
years ago.

107
00:05:40,975 --> 00:05:45,194
And as for your 25
years of abject misery

108
00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:48,314
and unspeakable indignation,
you deserve it, kid.

109
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,202
Now go and get me
some chocolate.

110
00:05:56,357 --> 00:05:59,459
Mr. Simon polk,

111
00:05:59,494 --> 00:06:03,463
who has lived out his life
in a gleeful rage.

112
00:06:03,498 --> 00:06:05,965
And the young lady
who's beat the hasty retreat

113
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,834
is mr. Polk's niece, barbara.

114
00:06:07,869 --> 00:06:10,336
She has lived her life
as if during each ensuing hour,

115
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:12,221
she had a dentist's appointment.

116
00:06:12,256 --> 00:06:15,341
There's a third member
soon to be seen.

117
00:06:15,376 --> 00:06:17,844
He now resides
in the laboratory,

118
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:19,095
and he is the kind of character

119
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:22,849
to be found
only in the twilight zone.

120
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:06,726
Well... what have we here?

121
00:07:06,761 --> 00:07:09,228
I was looking for...

122
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:11,114
looking for what?

123
00:07:11,149 --> 00:07:15,485
I... thought perhaps
you might show me

124
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,370
what you were building.

125
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:20,239
Indeed. You'd like to
know, wouldn't you?

126
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:22,125
That's the only
character trait

127
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,878
you share with normal
curiosity.

128
00:07:25,913 --> 00:07:27,747
Ineffable curiosity.

129
00:07:27,782 --> 00:07:30,883
Well, one day, you'll
know what i'm building,

130
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:32,752
but until then,

131
00:07:32,787 --> 00:07:35,888
you night-crawling
imitation of the
female gender,

132
00:07:35,923 --> 00:07:38,391
if i catch you sneaking
around outside my door,

133
00:07:38,426 --> 00:07:40,893
i'll break your head.

134
00:07:40,928 --> 00:07:44,647
Now, go on upstairs
and engage yourself

135
00:07:44,682 --> 00:07:47,767
in a nerve-wracking
game of dominos.

136
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:54,273
Tell me, uncle simon...

137
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:58,027
why do beasts like you
stay alive so long?

138
00:07:58,062 --> 00:07:59,278
What's that again?

139
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:00,530
You heard me.

140
00:08:00,565 --> 00:08:03,416
Why do decent men die,

141
00:08:03,451 --> 00:08:06,536
and animals like yourself
keep living on?

142
00:08:06,571 --> 00:08:09,422
Because, in most cases,
mine in particular,

143
00:08:09,457 --> 00:08:11,290
we have something to live for.

144
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:13,176
I have you

145
00:08:13,211 --> 00:08:16,429
to live for, you
crooked-seamed grubber.

146
00:08:16,464 --> 00:08:19,432
That's why i keep
this decrepit old heart beating

147
00:08:19,467 --> 00:08:22,552
and these over-the-hill lungs
breathing.

148
00:08:22,587 --> 00:08:25,054
I know how dedicated you are
to seeing me die.

149
00:08:25,089 --> 00:08:28,808
Who came here 25 years ago

150
00:08:28,843 --> 00:08:33,196
when you were crippled and sick
and couldn't move?

151
00:08:33,231 --> 00:08:36,949
Who came here and nursed you
and kept you alive?

152
00:08:36,984 --> 00:08:38,201
You did!

153
00:08:38,236 --> 00:08:40,703
You did,
you scrounging female ape.

154
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:44,707
Now let's get down to cases.

155
00:08:44,742 --> 00:08:45,958
Why did you come?

156
00:08:45,993 --> 00:08:48,461
Was it out of love, barbara?

157
00:08:48,496 --> 00:08:51,330
Was it out of a
palpitating compassion

158
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:53,833
or a flagpole-
stiff loyalty?

159
00:08:53,868 --> 00:08:55,585
I'll tell you
why you came.

160
00:08:56,219 --> 00:08:59,972
You stayed on month after month,
year after year,

161
00:09:00,007 --> 00:09:01,841
because every prayer
that came out of your mouth

162
00:09:01,876 --> 00:09:04,343
was a supplication that i'd die
before the next morning.

163
00:09:05,595 --> 00:09:06,596
So don't go mouthing

164
00:09:06,631 --> 00:09:08,481
your sweetnesses at me,

165
00:09:08,516 --> 00:09:11,601
you thin-lipped,
toothpick-legged conniver.

166
00:09:11,636 --> 00:09:14,737
Everything you did for me,
you did for greed.

167
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:16,606
Greed!

168
00:09:16,641 --> 00:09:19,742
Greed so big, so thick, so heavy

169
00:09:19,777 --> 00:09:23,496
that it blotted out
even the hatred inside you.

170
00:09:23,531 --> 00:09:26,365
But let me tell
you something, you
money-sick crone.

171
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,868
You'll get paid off
in due course,

172
00:09:28,903 --> 00:09:32,872
but before that, you'll pay
through every bone in your body.

173
00:09:32,907 --> 00:09:35,875
You'll pay, you ugly
harpy, you, you...

174
00:09:54,644 --> 00:09:58,397
barbara... help me.

175
00:10:00,283 --> 00:10:05,288
Barbara... why
won't you help me?

176
00:10:05,323 --> 00:10:08,407
Why don't you
help me, barbara?

177
00:10:10,293 --> 00:10:12,795
What's that?

178
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:16,549
What's that, uncle?
I didn't quite hear you.

179
00:10:16,584 --> 00:10:19,051
Speak a little louder,
would you?

180
00:10:19,086 --> 00:10:22,171
Tell me what it is
that you wanted.

181
00:10:22,206 --> 00:10:27,176
I think my
back is broken.

182
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:32,815
You say you want
some hot chocolate?

183
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:36,569
Do you want it
in the english bone china cup?

184
00:10:36,604 --> 00:10:39,071
What is your pleasure,
uncle?

185
00:10:39,106 --> 00:10:40,940
You say you want me

186
00:10:40,975 --> 00:10:44,076
to close the drapes
and shut the windows?

187
00:10:44,111 --> 00:10:47,196
Barbara...
barbara...

188
00:10:47,231 --> 00:10:48,447
barbara?

189
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:50,950
You want barbara?

190
00:10:50,985 --> 00:10:54,086
She's right here, love,
standing right above you.

191
00:10:54,121 --> 00:10:55,955
Can't you see her?

192
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:57,840
Can't you hear her,

193
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:01,594
you ancient albatross
with a dirty mouth?

194
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:05,965
Uncle simon?

195
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:09,101
Uncle simon?

196
00:11:09,136 --> 00:11:14,724
Please... don't die
quite this moment.

197
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:20,363
If you can hold on,
try, try just for a second.

198
00:11:20,398 --> 00:11:24,116
I want to tell you
something.

199
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:27,236
I want to make
an announcement.

200
00:11:27,271 --> 00:11:30,373
As of this second,

201
00:11:30,408 --> 00:11:34,126
as of this very second,

202
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:37,880
i have quit suffering
because of you.

203
00:11:37,915 --> 00:11:42,251
I am no longer sowing,
uncle simon.

204
00:11:42,286 --> 00:11:47,890
As of right now,
i am going to reap!

205
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:45,064
Hey, world, i'm back!

206
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:47,566
I'm really back!

207
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:01,130
If you give me
the sense of it,

208
00:13:01,165 --> 00:13:02,998
i can dispose
of some things.

209
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:04,500
That is the sense of it.

210
00:13:04,535 --> 00:13:07,002
The will
very explicitly requires

211
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:08,888
that you throw away nothing.

212
00:13:09,138 --> 00:13:11,006
You keep everything
intact.

213
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,258
I see.

214
00:13:12,293 --> 00:13:14,143
The house,
its furnishings...

215
00:13:14,178 --> 00:13:16,645
everything goes to you
in perpetuity.

216
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:20,149
The proviso is, of course,
that you remain here.

217
00:13:20,184 --> 00:13:24,153
Where would i go?
This is my home.

218
00:13:24,188 --> 00:13:25,654
Of course, of course.

219
00:13:25,689 --> 00:13:29,408
But, uh, the document
is quite clear in its intent.

220
00:13:29,443 --> 00:13:31,911
Everything will remain
in your name

221
00:13:31,946 --> 00:13:34,413
so long as you are
on the premises.

222
00:13:34,448 --> 00:13:36,916
The same thing applies
to the various securities

223
00:13:36,951 --> 00:13:39,285
and the cash,
which is quite sizable.

224
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,787
It's been set up
in trust.

225
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:43,789
You're to draw
the interest accruing

226
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:46,292
so long as you remain
in the house.

227
00:13:46,542 --> 00:13:51,547
Where could anybody find a man
with a heart as big as his?

228
00:13:51,582 --> 00:13:53,549
Uh, now this...
this is a codicil

229
00:13:53,584 --> 00:13:56,051
your uncle had delivered
to my office.

230
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:59,805
His instructions were
to include it in the will.

231
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:03,192
"Add this codicil...
additional stipulation..."

232
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:05,060
uh... hmm.

233
00:14:05,095 --> 00:14:06,946
The sense of this

234
00:14:06,981 --> 00:14:09,198
is that to qualify
for the other legacies,

235
00:14:09,233 --> 00:14:11,700
there is one additional
stipulation:

236
00:14:11,735 --> 00:14:15,454
You're to care for all
of your uncle's experiments.

237
00:14:15,489 --> 00:14:17,573
"Care for"...that's odd...

238
00:14:17,608 --> 00:14:20,075
i don't understand,
mr. Schwimmer.

239
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:23,212
Just exactly what experiments
did he mean?

240
00:14:23,247 --> 00:14:25,080
I have no idea.

241
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:26,966
But, uh, it reads as follows:

242
00:14:27,001 --> 00:14:29,468
"My beloved niece, barbara,

243
00:14:29,503 --> 00:14:30,970
"will be responsible
for the well-being

244
00:14:31,005 --> 00:14:32,838
"of my latest experiment.

245
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:37,226
"She will look after it
and see to its wants and needs.

246
00:14:37,261 --> 00:14:40,479
"A member of the law firm
of schwimmer, schwimmer, king,

247
00:14:40,514 --> 00:14:42,348
"bathrick, pepperin,
and schwimmer

248
00:14:42,383 --> 00:14:46,735
"will visit each week to see
this stipulation is adhered to.

249
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:50,105
"In the event my beloved
niece barbara fails to comply

250
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:53,859
"with the provisions hereof,
i hereby give and bequeath

251
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:56,362
"all property,
both real and personal,

252
00:14:56,397 --> 00:14:58,247
to the state university."

253
00:14:58,282 --> 00:15:00,249
Now, the sense of that,
miss polk...

254
00:15:00,284 --> 00:15:03,369
just what is the sense of that?

255
00:15:03,404 --> 00:15:07,256
I gather it depends
on the nature of the experiment.

256
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:09,124
He refers to it as "it."

257
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:11,627
You have no idea what "it" is?

258
00:15:11,662 --> 00:15:13,012
No idea at all,

259
00:15:13,047 --> 00:15:16,765
except that whatever it is,
it must be in the laboratory.

260
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:41,790
Well, nothing in here
of any consequence.

261
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:55,671
How do you do?

262
00:15:55,706 --> 00:15:59,425
I'm a mechanical man

263
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:03,429
built by your late
uncle simon polk.

264
00:16:03,464 --> 00:16:08,183
Your opening the door
has activated

265
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:10,936
all of my operating relays.

266
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:13,822
Be patient with me,

267
00:16:13,857 --> 00:16:16,325
because according
to plan...

268
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,193
according to plan...

269
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:20,696
according
to plan...

270
00:16:20,731 --> 00:16:22,448
according to...

271
00:16:22,483 --> 00:16:24,333
it will be several days

272
00:16:24,368 --> 00:16:30,589
before i can function
at maximum capacity.

273
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:34,593
I bid you greetings.

274
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:37,212
Hello, barbara.

275
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:49,608
Bar-bara!

276
00:16:56,231 --> 00:16:59,368
Bar-bara!

277
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:29,515
I'm going out,
frankenstein.

278
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:33,268
If you need anything,
like a can of lubricant,

279
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:35,154
get it yourself.

280
00:17:35,189 --> 00:17:37,656
You must not leave.

281
00:17:37,691 --> 00:17:41,410
Mr. Schwimmer
is coming tonight.

282
00:17:41,445 --> 00:17:43,912
A week has gone by.

283
00:17:43,947 --> 00:17:46,415
Isn't mr. Schwimmer coming?

284
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:51,420
Yes, mr. Schwimmer
is coming.

285
00:17:51,455 --> 00:17:53,038
He'll be here at 8:00.

286
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:54,673
Good.

287
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:57,042
Good?

288
00:17:57,077 --> 00:17:59,428
Good for what?

289
00:17:59,463 --> 00:18:03,182
He will see that i am
functioning properly.

290
00:18:03,217 --> 00:18:08,804
You see, i am
like an infant.

291
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:11,306
I am maturing gradually.

292
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:16,311
Soon, i will have
all my faculties.

293
00:18:16,346 --> 00:18:20,699
I will be able to perform
all my functions.

294
00:18:20,734 --> 00:18:23,819
I will be a whole being.

295
00:18:23,854 --> 00:18:25,454
How nice.

296
00:18:25,489 --> 00:18:27,956
How perfectly grand.
How exciting.

297
00:18:27,991 --> 00:18:30,459
You'll be a whole being.

298
00:18:30,494 --> 00:18:32,327
Then what will happen?

299
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:35,214
I will take on human attributes,

300
00:18:35,249 --> 00:18:38,333
those which your uncle simon

301
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:40,836
saw fit to give me.

302
00:18:40,871 --> 00:18:43,722
My uncle simon, hmm?

303
00:18:43,757 --> 00:18:46,225
There was a prince of a man.

304
00:18:46,475 --> 00:18:50,846
A... a brilliant man.

305
00:18:50,881 --> 00:18:53,348
This is interesting.

306
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:56,735
This is very interesting.

307
00:18:56,770 --> 00:19:00,489
It's coming through now.

308
00:19:02,357 --> 00:19:04,243
What is?

309
00:19:04,278 --> 00:19:06,111
A... a craving.

310
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:10,365
A new craving.

311
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,251
Hot chocolate.

312
00:19:12,286 --> 00:19:17,506
I would love a cup
of hot chocolate.

313
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:45,033
Miss polk.

314
00:19:45,068 --> 00:19:49,404
Well, you look
lovely, miss polk.

315
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:50,656
And how is...

316
00:19:50,691 --> 00:19:53,792
how is young master polk, hmm?

317
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:43,959
You took those keys
off the desk.

318
00:20:43,994 --> 00:20:45,210
Give them back to me.

319
00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:48,964
Oh, no, i must keep the
laboratory door locked.

320
00:20:49,598 --> 00:20:51,466
You must not come down.

321
00:20:51,501 --> 00:20:56,471
It is my room.
It belongs to me.

322
00:20:56,506 --> 00:20:58,974
Barbara...

323
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:04,613
won't you bring me
some hot chocolate?

324
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:10,869
After you bring me
my hot chocolate,

325
00:21:10,904 --> 00:21:14,489
would you please
close all the windows

326
00:21:14,524 --> 00:21:16,375
and pull the drapes?

327
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:18,877
I don't like
the light.

328
00:21:18,912 --> 00:21:23,248
I don't like
the draft.

329
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:27,252
(speaking in
what is the matter, barbara?

330
00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:31,006
Tell me, please,
what is the matter?

331
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:33,508
What is the matter?

332
00:21:33,543 --> 00:21:35,394
What is the matter,

333
00:21:35,429 --> 00:21:39,765
you peanut-headed
sample of nature's
carelessness?

334
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:55,914
Barbara... barbara...

335
00:21:55,949 --> 00:21:58,417
help me...

336
00:21:58,452 --> 00:22:00,919
help... me...

337
00:22:08,677 --> 00:22:11,797
ah, how are you this evening,
miss polk?

338
00:22:11,832 --> 00:22:14,933
He, uh... itis rather quiet
these days.

339
00:22:14,968 --> 00:22:16,802
Doesn't seem to say much.

340
00:22:16,837 --> 00:22:18,804
He makes his wants known.

341
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:21,690
Pity about his... his leg,

342
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:24,810
but he manages to get around,
doesn't he?

343
00:22:24,845 --> 00:22:29,448
Indeed, he does.
Indeed, he does.

344
00:22:30,065 --> 00:22:33,819
Well, i'll see you next week.
Take care of yourself.

345
00:22:33,854 --> 00:22:35,704
No need to show me out.

346
00:22:40,575 --> 00:22:42,461
Barbara.

347
00:22:47,332 --> 00:22:49,217
Barbara?

348
00:22:57,342 --> 00:23:00,479
Barbara, my dear,
if you could prevail

349
00:23:00,514 --> 00:23:04,850
upon that raggedy ann carcass
of yours to exert itself,

350
00:23:04,885 --> 00:23:07,352
i'd like a cup
of hot chocolate.

351
00:23:07,387 --> 00:23:10,605
I would like it
in the english bone china cup,

352
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,742
and if it's not hot,
i'll throw it on the floor.

353
00:23:13,777 --> 00:23:15,610
All right, i'll make some.

354
00:23:15,645 --> 00:23:19,998
Speak up, you lint-headed clod.
I couldn't hear you.

355
00:23:20,033 --> 00:23:23,118
I'll make some hot chocolate.

356
00:23:23,153 --> 00:23:26,872
Move, you topping lotus-eater.

357
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:29,374
Be sure it's hot.

358
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:30,625
Do you hear me?

359
00:23:31,259 --> 00:23:34,379
Make sure it's hot.

360
00:23:34,414 --> 00:23:38,133
What does it take to make
you move, you bovine crab?

361
00:23:38,168 --> 00:23:40,769
I'll fix it
for you now.

362
00:23:40,804 --> 00:23:46,391
You'll fix it for
me now... what?

363
00:23:46,426 --> 00:23:50,529
I'll fix it for you now...

364
00:23:50,564 --> 00:23:52,397
uncle.

365
00:23:59,287 --> 00:24:04,409
A metal man
who'll go by the name of simon,

366
00:24:05,043 --> 00:24:08,163
whose life as well as his body
has been stamped on for him.

367
00:24:08,198 --> 00:24:09,414
And the woman who tends
to him-

368
00:24:09,449 --> 00:24:11,917
the lady barbara,
who's discovered belatedly

369
00:24:11,952 --> 00:24:14,419
that all bad things
don't come to an end,

370
00:24:14,454 --> 00:24:18,807
and that once a bed is made,
it's necessary you sleep in it.

371
00:24:18,842 --> 00:24:20,675
Tonight's uncomfortable
little exercise

372
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:25,680
in avarice and automatons
from the twilight zone.

373
00:24:30,018 --> 00:24:32,320
And now, mr. Serling.

374
00:24:32,355 --> 00:24:32,954
Next ontwilight zone,

375
00:24:32,989 --> 00:24:35,457
an eminent performer
of stage and screen,

376
00:24:35,492 --> 00:24:37,325
mr. Richard basehart,
in an odd-ball excursion

377
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,462
that we call
"probe seven, over and out."

378
00:24:40,497 --> 00:24:43,582
On occasion, we'll come up with
a wild and woolly denouement,

379
00:24:43,617 --> 00:24:45,467
but this particular opus
has an unpredictable ending

380
00:24:45,502 --> 00:24:47,969
that we doubt if even
the most seasonedtzfans

381
00:24:48,004 --> 00:24:51,089
will be able to pick up before
it happens on your screen.

382
00:24:51,124 --> 00:24:54,226
Next ontwilight zone,
"probe seven, over and out."
