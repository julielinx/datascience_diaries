1
00:00:00,195 --> 00:00:01,781
<i>Previously on "Pan Am"...</i>

2
00:00:01,867 --> 00:00:03,166
Do you not wanna get married?

3
00:00:03,242 --> 00:00:05,588
You need to decide,
because this is your life.

4
00:00:05,752 --> 00:00:07,077
I wanna see the world.

5
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,914
I'll become
a Pan Am stewardess.

6
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:12,212
"Upon boarding,
passengers are greeted

7
00:00:12,235 --> 00:00:14,145
"by the international
beauty and Grace

8
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,676
known as the Pan Am stewardess."

9
00:00:18,045 --> 00:00:19,908
- Are you wearing your girdle?
- Yes, ma'am.

10
00:00:20,009 --> 00:00:21,480
Oh.

11
00:00:21,548 --> 00:00:24,569
<i>Pan Am</i>
<i>flight 292</i> <i>is now boarding.</i>

12
00:00:26,018 --> 00:00:27,652
I didn't know you'd be
on this flight.

13
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,252
What a coincidence.
I didn't know you were married.

14
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:32,078
Should we spike his
food or his drink?

15
00:00:32,092 --> 00:00:32,725
Both.

16
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,130
I work for the U.S. government...
Intelligence.

17
00:00:35,224 --> 00:00:36,553
You fit
the profile perfectly...

18
00:00:36,639 --> 00:00:38,169
Beautiful, well educated.

19
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,406
The Pan Am stewardess can
travel all around the world

20
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:41,722
without suspicion.

21
00:00:41,885 --> 00:00:43,653
And I have the perfect cover.

22
00:00:44,604 --> 00:00:46,771
- Marry me!
- I can't say "yes" now.

23
00:00:48,776 --> 00:00:49,796
Bridget.

24
00:00:52,202 --> 00:00:54,398
Bridget arranged
that meeting in Rome.

25
00:00:54,531 --> 00:00:56,416
She had an eye for talent.

26
00:00:56,619 --> 00:00:57,782
"Had"?

27
00:00:58,232 --> 00:01:00,081
Am I her replacement?

28
00:01:39,451 --> 00:01:40,584
Hello, miss.

29
00:01:42,043 --> 00:01:43,476
Couldn't help but notice
your predicament.

30
00:01:43,544 --> 00:01:46,278
Unfortunate, no?
Are you going my way?

31
00:01:46,346 --> 00:01:47,879
Ah, it depends.
Where you going?

32
00:01:47,948 --> 00:01:50,015
Me? <i>Paris.</i>

33
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,388
You've gotta be kidding me.

34
00:01:52,422 --> 00:01:54,786
I'm going to Paris.

35
00:01:54,854 --> 00:01:56,088
You don't say.

36
00:01:56,156 --> 00:01:57,622
Sometimes the stars align.

37
00:01:58,291 --> 00:01:59,792
Say, I could give you
a lift...

38
00:01:59,812 --> 00:02:00,358
Oh.

39
00:02:00,426 --> 00:02:02,360
But I'll have to warn ya.

40
00:02:02,428 --> 00:02:04,195
You'll have
to cook my dinner,

41
00:02:04,676 --> 00:02:07,798
bring me coffee,
make occasional small talk.

42
00:02:07,866 --> 00:02:09,500
Some steep demands.

43
00:02:09,568 --> 00:02:11,202
It's a long walk to Paris.

44
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,941
Fine. On one small condition.

45
00:02:19,177 --> 00:02:21,811
- I swear, just another minute.
- Laura!

46
00:02:22,444 --> 00:02:25,787
I couldn't find my blue shawl.
Did you pick it up from home?

47
00:02:25,842 --> 00:02:28,068
I don't know. I couldn't see
through all the smoke.

48
00:02:28,193 --> 00:02:28,785
Smoke?

49
00:02:28,853 --> 00:02:30,487
Yes,
mother was breathing fire.

50
00:02:30,741 --> 00:02:32,810
- Right.
- What, are you moving to Paris?

51
00:02:32,857 --> 00:02:34,490
Well, I wanted to have plenty
of room to bring things home.

52
00:02:34,557 --> 00:02:36,525
And you couldn't find
your steamer trunk?

53
00:02:36,593 --> 00:02:39,771
Oh, I almost forgot.
I have something for you.

54
00:02:39,818 --> 00:02:40,807
Can't it wait?

55
00:02:40,885 --> 00:02:42,465
No, it'll only take a second.
Here.

56
00:02:42,532 --> 00:02:43,899
What is it?

57
00:02:47,947 --> 00:02:49,604
Remember this?

58
00:02:49,905 --> 00:02:52,507
We did it.
We're really going, together.

59
00:02:52,574 --> 00:02:54,542
How did you get this
out of your room?

60
00:02:54,993 --> 00:02:56,527
Did you call daddy?

61
00:02:56,783 --> 00:02:58,789
And risk mother finding out?
No way.

62
00:02:58,867 --> 00:03:00,245
I had Maria send it.

63
00:03:00,511 --> 00:03:01,481
Wow.

64
00:03:01,684 --> 00:03:04,236
It's a sad day when your maid's
more accepting than your mother.

65
00:03:04,299 --> 00:03:05,465
But it's not a sad day.

66
00:03:05,504 --> 00:03:07,075
It's the best day
in a long time...

67
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:09,723
The day you and I
finally make it to Paris!

68
00:03:16,164 --> 00:03:18,565
You have to stay
on the right side of the road.

69
00:03:18,633 --> 00:03:21,134
I'm French, not English.

70
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,646
I'm fairly confident
this is a bad idea.

71
00:03:23,857 --> 00:03:26,105
Oh, come on.
What are you afraid of?

72
00:03:26,173 --> 00:03:29,008
Where do I start?

73
00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:31,244
No, before we do this,

74
00:03:31,725 --> 00:03:33,192
do you have any questions?

75
00:03:33,228 --> 00:03:34,228
Only one.

76
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,448
How fast does it go?

77
00:03:35,516 --> 00:03:38,283
That's the wrong question.

78
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:40,419
We had a deal!

79
00:03:44,559 --> 00:03:45,994
Thank you.

80
00:03:50,801 --> 00:03:52,830
You have your license on you,
right?

81
00:03:53,205 --> 00:03:54,865
What license?

82
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:10,275
Sync and corrected by dr.jackson
for www.addic7ed.com

83
00:04:12,472 --> 00:04:14,227
Did you know
there are 2,000 windows

84
00:04:14,274 --> 00:04:15,775
in the palace at Versailles?

85
00:04:15,843 --> 00:04:18,144
Maybe you shouldn't
read and walk at the same time.

86
00:04:18,211 --> 00:04:19,478
Ooh, pardon.

87
00:04:19,547 --> 00:04:21,981
And over 2,000 acres
of formal garden.

88
00:04:22,049 --> 00:04:23,182
No kidding.

89
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,450
Laura, there you are.

90
00:04:24,518 --> 00:04:26,809
In body.
Her mind is elsewhere.

91
00:04:26,864 --> 00:04:29,454
I'm cramming for Paris.
Go ahead. Quiz me.

92
00:04:29,522 --> 00:04:30,923
Uh, height
of the Eiffel Tower.

93
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:32,457
324 meters.

94
00:04:32,525 --> 00:04:34,359
Built by...
Gustave Eiffel.

95
00:04:34,427 --> 00:04:35,861
Well, that oughta come in handy.

96
00:04:35,929 --> 00:04:37,228
Colette!

97
00:04:37,296 --> 00:04:38,530
Thank you again.

98
00:04:38,598 --> 00:04:41,532
I'd like to say "anytime,"
but... no.

99
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,764
- Bye.
- I'll see you soon.

100
00:04:44,937 --> 00:04:47,350
I salute you, captain.

101
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,591
Oh, not now, Sanjeev.

102
00:04:49,641 --> 00:04:50,641
Very impressed.

103
00:04:50,709 --> 00:04:51,709
Sanjeev?

104
00:04:51,777 --> 00:04:53,022
Back on the horse.

105
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,612
No, I'm not back
on the horse.

106
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,777
Understood.

107
00:04:59,593 --> 00:05:02,418
Mmm, the pain au chocolat
at fauchon patisserie

108
00:05:02,486 --> 00:05:03,620
near Madeleine.

109
00:05:03,688 --> 00:05:05,221
Definitely amazing,
but not the best.

110
00:05:05,289 --> 00:05:06,428
What's the best?

111
00:05:06,452 --> 00:05:07,857
<i>A la mere de famille,</i>
<i>en montmartre.</i>

112
00:05:07,925 --> 00:05:10,326
<i>Les orangettes enrobees</i>
<i>de chocolat.</i>

113
00:05:10,394 --> 00:05:13,428
I wanna try <i>everything.</i>

114
00:05:15,431 --> 00:05:18,200
You'd be advised to limit
yourself to one, miss Cameron.

115
00:05:18,617 --> 00:05:20,368
You've gained
another pound.

116
00:05:20,436 --> 00:05:22,671
Do we need to revisit
your personal weight limit?

117
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:23,871
Oh.

118
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,941
No, miss Havemeyer.

119
00:05:26,353 --> 00:05:27,987
<i>Attention, passengers...</i>

120
00:05:28,062 --> 00:05:29,844
Miss Cameron,
you have a call.

121
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:32,546
Redheaded Cameron.
Pay phone. Your father.

122
00:05:32,615 --> 00:05:33,681
Daddy?

123
00:05:33,749 --> 00:05:36,751
Okay.
I'll see you on board.

124
00:05:36,819 --> 00:05:38,586
You're next, miss Ryan.

125
00:05:38,654 --> 00:05:41,923
Oh, please. After you.

126
00:05:42,372 --> 00:05:43,661
Pardon me?

127
00:05:43,692 --> 00:05:45,048
Well, I think
we'd all like to know

128
00:05:45,063 --> 00:05:46,960
what you're weighing in at
these days.

129
00:05:47,028 --> 00:05:49,395
I assume that
if there's an ideal weight

130
00:05:49,463 --> 00:05:52,065
for serving drinks, then surely
there's an ideal weight

131
00:05:52,133 --> 00:05:54,110
for looking down one's nose.

132
00:05:54,149 --> 00:05:57,638
- Maggie, it's okay.
- No, go on, please.

133
00:05:57,705 --> 00:05:58,972
I'll be gentle.

134
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,239
Don't believe a word
she says, Mrs. Havemeyer.

135
00:06:02,294 --> 00:06:04,424
Maggie promised
to be gentle with <i>me,</i>

136
00:06:04,494 --> 00:06:06,445
and I assure you,
it's a bald-faced lie.

137
00:06:06,513 --> 00:06:08,042
I'm sorry you had to witness

138
00:06:08,073 --> 00:06:09,986
miss Ryan's insubordination,
Mr. Vanderway.

139
00:06:10,028 --> 00:06:11,836
And I'm sorry
that I have to steal

140
00:06:11,857 --> 00:06:15,167
this insubordinate stewardesses
away. They're late.

141
00:06:15,421 --> 00:06:18,212
<i>Or</i> I can let operations know
that there was a delay.

142
00:06:18,235 --> 00:06:22,359
No delay. Miss Ryan and I
can continue our conversation

143
00:06:22,406 --> 00:06:24,428
with her supervisor
upon her return.

144
00:06:37,275 --> 00:06:39,409
Oh, thank you so much.

145
00:06:39,477 --> 00:06:40,544
Daddy?

146
00:06:40,611 --> 00:06:42,846
Not exactly.

147
00:06:44,415 --> 00:06:45,582
Richard.

148
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:47,551
I'm glad you're here.

149
00:06:47,618 --> 00:06:49,652
I need answers
about Bridget.

150
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,487
Your predecessor
isn't your concern.

151
00:06:51,555 --> 00:06:53,189
A stewardess
can't just disappear.

152
00:06:53,256 --> 00:06:55,324
Quitting is one thing.
Vanishing is another.

153
00:06:55,392 --> 00:06:57,155
All of Pan Am is buzzing.

154
00:06:57,178 --> 00:06:59,354
Pan Am is buzzing,
or you're wondering?

155
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:00,884
- Both.
- Take this.

156
00:07:01,131 --> 00:07:03,556
Keep it in your purse.
Do not open it.

157
00:07:03,596 --> 00:07:04,933
This isn't another test,
is it?

158
00:07:05,001 --> 00:07:06,334
Your contact will find you
in Paris

159
00:07:06,402 --> 00:07:09,370
and identify himself using
the hour-of-the-day exchange.

160
00:07:09,672 --> 00:07:11,140
You remember it?

161
00:07:11,532 --> 00:07:13,675
Hour-of-the-day exchange.
Yes.

162
00:07:13,743 --> 00:07:15,610
Uh, they ask for the time,
I give it in hours.

163
00:07:15,678 --> 00:07:16,978
They repeat it back wrong,
I correct them.

164
00:07:17,046 --> 00:07:19,017
They thank me,
and I give them the package.

165
00:07:19,042 --> 00:07:19,760
What time is it?

166
00:07:19,783 --> 00:07:22,090
1800 hours.
Ah, that's 7:00, right?

167
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:24,018
You're supposed to
correct me.

168
00:07:24,086 --> 00:07:27,819
I'm sorry.
Uh, 1800 hours is 6:00, sir.

169
00:07:27,836 --> 00:07:28,666
Give me the box back.

170
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:31,313
No. I mean,
I can handle this.

171
00:07:31,383 --> 00:07:32,951
If you can't remember
your basic training...

172
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:36,120
I can handle this. I just
need to go now. I'm late.

173
00:07:40,227 --> 00:07:42,093
<i>Au revoir.</i>

174
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:46,706
<i>Thank you.</i>

175
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,911
- Where have <i>you</i> been?
- Where's the manifest?

176
00:07:57,117 --> 00:07:58,217
<i>There you are.</i>

177
00:07:58,284 --> 00:08:00,786
No, no, no.

178
00:08:02,622 --> 00:08:04,489
Oh, God.

179
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:14,065
Kate, what is it?

180
00:08:16,001 --> 00:08:17,385
It's mother.

181
00:08:17,445 --> 00:08:18,746
Mother?

182
00:08:18,971 --> 00:08:20,471
Is something wrong?

183
00:08:20,538 --> 00:08:22,373
Yes.

184
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,742
She's on the plane.

185
00:08:34,353 --> 00:08:35,919
You're not
the least bit curious?

186
00:08:35,987 --> 00:08:36,987
No.

187
00:08:37,055 --> 00:08:38,623
Not a tiny bit curious?

188
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:40,191
She disappeared.

189
00:08:40,259 --> 00:08:43,127
- Nope.
- 'Cause if a guy's not on a new horse,

190
00:08:43,195 --> 00:08:45,429
chances are he's still thinking
about the old one.

191
00:08:45,497 --> 00:08:48,666
And you, Sanjeev,
know how to beat a dead horse.

192
00:08:48,733 --> 00:08:51,201
3-minute pee.
He's still on Bridget?

193
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:52,977
I'm just saying, I'd be curious.

194
00:08:53,047 --> 00:08:54,524
- I'm not.
- Good man.

195
00:08:54,524 --> 00:08:56,793
In case you do get curious,
let me tell you something.

196
00:08:56,818 --> 00:08:57,831
When it comes to women...

197
00:08:57,832 --> 00:08:59,797
Listen up, folks.
Sanjeev's sharing pearls.

198
00:08:59,836 --> 00:09:01,755
Yeah, I'm taking notes.

199
00:09:01,838 --> 00:09:03,997
There's always a friend
who knows. <i>Always.</i>

200
00:09:04,027 --> 00:09:06,712
So if a dame left you
without word...

201
00:09:06,775 --> 00:09:09,590
No "it was fun,"
no "we'll always have Paris,"

202
00:09:09,637 --> 00:09:11,773
you'd go searching for her?

203
00:09:11,867 --> 00:09:13,602
I didn't say that. Hell, no.

204
00:09:13,669 --> 00:09:14,803
There you go.

205
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:17,005
That is, unless...

206
00:09:17,073 --> 00:09:18,773
She was the love of my life.

207
00:09:24,379 --> 00:09:26,306
What kind of name
is "Metropolitans," anyway,

208
00:09:26,314 --> 00:09:27,448
for a brand-new ball club?

209
00:09:27,516 --> 00:09:29,783
Stengel didn't do too bad
for your boys in the Bronx.

210
00:09:29,851 --> 00:09:31,252
Until he went senile.

211
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,921
- Dinner already?
- Well, a deal is a deal.

212
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:39,792
And who benches Whitey Ford
until game...

213
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,294
Three? What deal?

214
00:09:46,267 --> 00:09:47,767
Now what do we have here?

215
00:09:47,835 --> 00:09:50,240
Oh, evening flights have
their advantages.

216
00:09:50,263 --> 00:09:51,438
I think I'm looking at one.

217
00:09:51,506 --> 00:09:52,606
Oh!

218
00:09:53,761 --> 00:09:56,708
Prosciutto, pate,
escargot?

219
00:09:56,776 --> 00:09:58,277
You've already got
my attention.

220
00:09:58,345 --> 00:10:00,946
Serve me an aphrodisiac,
I might just fall in love.

221
00:10:01,014 --> 00:10:02,148
It has been known to happen.

222
00:10:02,215 --> 00:10:03,978
Careful. I'm a glutton.

223
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:06,212
Oh, I noticed.

224
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:15,826
- I have no idea.
- She hasn't spoken to me since I left.

225
00:10:15,894 --> 00:10:17,595
Then <i>what</i>
is she doing here?

226
00:10:17,663 --> 00:10:19,531
Are you two still hiding?

227
00:10:19,598 --> 00:10:21,332
Daddy didn't tell you?

228
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,433
Daddy?

229
00:10:22,501 --> 00:10:24,602
He just called you
on the pay phone.

230
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:27,871
Oh, uh, yes, he needed me
to buy him some...

231
00:10:27,938 --> 00:10:28,820
French cheese.

232
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:30,805
Cheese?

233
00:10:31,809 --> 00:10:34,844
Mom's on her way to kill me,
and he wants cheese?

234
00:10:34,912 --> 00:10:36,668
You know,
as Pan Am employees,

235
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:38,915
you can have your parents
fly for free.

236
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,917
We are not
telling her that.

237
00:10:40,985 --> 00:10:42,718
- No.
- She's that bad?

238
00:10:42,786 --> 00:10:44,720
She should have saved the fare
and flown her broomstick.

239
00:10:44,788 --> 00:10:47,089
Well, one of you is gonna
have to face her.

240
00:10:47,469 --> 00:10:49,871
Colette's by herself
in economy.

241
00:10:57,933 --> 00:10:58,900
Two out of three.

242
00:10:58,967 --> 00:11:00,768
No.
Kate, please.

243
00:11:00,836 --> 00:11:02,404
I can't do it.

244
00:11:04,207 --> 00:11:06,107
What else is new?

245
00:11:19,254 --> 00:11:21,255
Order up here.

246
00:11:25,849 --> 00:11:26,911
Did daddy yell?

247
00:11:26,951 --> 00:11:29,585
No. He calmly threatened
to call the state troopers

248
00:11:29,616 --> 00:11:30,855
and report his car stolen

249
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:32,289
if we didn't turn around
and come home.

250
00:11:32,357 --> 00:11:34,679
- And mother?
- Indisposed, apparently.

251
00:11:34,991 --> 00:11:36,544
Oh, God.
What have I done?

252
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:38,379
You were honest with yourself,
and you stood up

253
00:11:38,446 --> 00:11:41,121
and claimed a stake
in your own life.

254
00:11:41,237 --> 00:11:45,193
I didn't stand up.
I ran away from my own wedding.

255
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,275
Can you imagine a look
on Greg's face?

256
00:11:48,314 --> 00:11:50,555
Would you rather be
at a reception right now,

257
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:53,311
feeling trapped
and forcing a smile?

258
00:11:54,829 --> 00:11:57,715
All right, then.
Let's order some pie.

259
00:11:58,294 --> 00:12:00,129
They're gonna disown me.

260
00:12:00,196 --> 00:12:01,630
Okay, let's get
something straight right now.

261
00:12:01,697 --> 00:12:03,470
<i>I</i> am the black sheep
of the family.

262
00:12:03,525 --> 00:12:04,658
Today is hard to beat.

263
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:05,926
You forget that I drove
the getaway car.

264
00:12:05,993 --> 00:12:07,261
I robbed the bank.

265
00:12:07,328 --> 00:12:09,791
<i>And</i> I told mother
that I hypnotized you.

266
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:12,632
See?

267
00:12:13,015 --> 00:12:15,936
You know, she might actually
believe that.

268
00:12:16,003 --> 00:12:17,303
Yes.

269
00:12:18,805 --> 00:12:20,239
You had to think about
it, didn't you? No.

270
00:12:20,307 --> 00:12:22,241
Mm-hmm.
No.

271
00:12:23,944 --> 00:12:25,945
Well, at least you
didn't walk away empty-handed.

272
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:27,746
What do you think it is?

273
00:12:27,814 --> 00:12:29,048
A toaster, I hope.

274
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:30,416
Well, we can't keep it.

275
00:12:30,484 --> 00:12:33,085
- Why not?
- Mother.

276
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:34,919
I think that ship
has sailed...

277
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:36,521
No. Mother... she's here.

278
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,823
Quick! Hide! Oh.

279
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:40,024
Oh, God.

280
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,626
<i>What</i> are you doing?

281
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:43,928
Hide! Laura, she's
already seen the car.

282
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:45,863
Oh, God. Oh, God.

283
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,065
Stay here.

284
00:12:56,874 --> 00:12:58,934
Get her in my car!

285
00:12:59,444 --> 00:13:01,312
No, mother!

286
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,653
Kate, I was starting

287
00:13:10,721 --> 00:13:12,288
to get worried
I was on the wrong plane.

288
00:13:12,356 --> 00:13:15,000
Hello, mother.
What's bringing you to Paris?

289
00:13:15,078 --> 00:13:17,198
I thought you said her name
was Laura.

290
00:13:17,214 --> 00:13:18,872
This is my other daughter,
Catherine.

291
00:13:18,914 --> 00:13:21,335
You have two daughters
who are Pan Am stewardesses?

292
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,897
I suppose I'm blessed.

293
00:13:22,965 --> 00:13:25,667
Oh, yes. I see the resemblance
to her sister.

294
00:13:26,062 --> 00:13:28,196
- Laura's been back here?
- No, dear.

295
00:13:28,476 --> 00:13:30,243
The "Life" magazine.

296
00:13:33,538 --> 00:13:35,283
You brought your own copy.

297
00:13:42,684 --> 00:13:44,385
What does she want?

298
00:13:44,453 --> 00:13:47,488
- She didn't say.
- It's not a coincidence.

299
00:13:47,556 --> 00:13:48,956
Are you insane?

300
00:13:49,024 --> 00:13:50,391
She needs
new reading material.

301
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:52,660
The Life" magazine
she's been waving around

302
00:13:52,727 --> 00:13:54,194
is over a month old.

303
00:13:54,262 --> 00:13:55,328
Oh, no.

304
00:13:55,396 --> 00:13:56,363
Oh, yes.

305
00:13:57,465 --> 00:13:59,032
And she's all yours.

306
00:14:36,868 --> 00:14:38,570
Hello, Mr. Elkins.

307
00:14:38,637 --> 00:14:40,405
You've learned my name.

308
00:14:40,472 --> 00:14:43,173
It's my job to know the names
of everyone in first class.

309
00:14:43,241 --> 00:14:44,346
Really?

310
00:14:44,869 --> 00:14:47,544
Do you know that
my favorite color is blue?

311
00:14:48,173 --> 00:14:50,051
I believe
the lavatory's open.

312
00:14:50,173 --> 00:14:51,582
I'm not here
for the lavatory.

313
00:14:51,649 --> 00:14:53,807
Then can I help you
with something?

314
00:14:54,219 --> 00:14:57,849
I might need
a cigarette later.

315
00:14:58,891 --> 00:15:01,324
Of course.
I'll bring one to your seat.

316
00:15:01,981 --> 00:15:03,339
I like the way that uniform

317
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,695
leaves just enough
to the imagination.

318
00:15:06,082 --> 00:15:07,249
<i>I</i> imagine

319
00:15:07,431 --> 00:15:09,765
you'd be much more comfortable
in your seat.

320
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:12,420
Not interested in comfort.

321
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,131
Aah!

322
00:15:19,193 --> 00:15:21,971
I am <i>not</i> included
in the price of your ticket.

323
00:15:41,584 --> 00:15:45,228
There you are, and with
my favorite drink, I see.

324
00:15:45,412 --> 00:15:47,445
Sorry it took me so long
to get back here.

325
00:15:47,457 --> 00:15:50,292
I was... up to my ears
in roast beef.

326
00:15:50,309 --> 00:15:51,717
It's all right.
You're here now.

327
00:15:51,927 --> 00:15:53,427
Only for a moment, actually.

328
00:15:53,477 --> 00:15:55,345
I... there are things I'm
supposed to... have a seat.

329
00:15:55,389 --> 00:15:56,710
Okay. Um...

330
00:15:57,419 --> 00:15:59,621
I... yeah,
I suppose things can wait.

331
00:16:05,895 --> 00:16:08,529
If you're gonna tell me
what a terrible daughter I am,

332
00:16:08,597 --> 00:16:10,597
I wish you'd just go ahead
and do it.

333
00:16:10,665 --> 00:16:11,598
What?

334
00:16:13,082 --> 00:16:16,003
I know how angry
you and daddy are,

335
00:16:16,071 --> 00:16:18,572
and... I'm sure
you're mortified

336
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,308
by what Mrs. Metcalf

337
00:16:21,376 --> 00:16:24,344
and those other D.A.R. gossips
must be saying, but I just...

338
00:16:24,412 --> 00:16:25,979
I miss you.

339
00:16:27,299 --> 00:16:28,971
But then why haven't
you called?

340
00:16:29,002 --> 00:16:33,953
I... I sent you a letter,
and you never called, not once.

341
00:16:34,343 --> 00:16:36,712
I suppose I was hoping
you'd come home,

342
00:16:37,312 --> 00:16:39,697
that you would need me,
but...

343
00:16:41,127 --> 00:16:42,761
I was clearly wrong.

344
00:16:43,521 --> 00:16:45,844
I do need you.

345
00:16:46,299 --> 00:16:48,801
I need you so much.

346
00:16:49,907 --> 00:16:52,920
Well... that makes me
very happy.

347
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,842
And as for Mrs. Metcalf
and the D.A.R. ladies...

348
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:00,945
This handled things
quite nicely.

349
00:17:01,442 --> 00:17:02,975
I'm the new belle of the ball.

350
00:17:03,028 --> 00:17:04,061
Really?

351
00:17:07,252 --> 00:17:08,652
How much had he had
to drink?

352
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,354
Does that matter?

353
00:17:10,422 --> 00:17:12,023
We need to report him.

354
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:13,824
Well, I can't
exactly do that.

355
00:17:13,891 --> 00:17:15,128
Why not?

356
00:17:15,426 --> 00:17:18,262
I sort of... stabbed him
with a serving fork.

357
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,529
You stabbed him?
You did what?

358
00:17:19,575 --> 00:17:20,544
Shh!

359
00:17:21,132 --> 00:17:23,066
Maggie was accosted
by a passenger.

360
00:17:23,134 --> 00:17:24,400
And you stabbed him?

361
00:17:24,468 --> 00:17:26,942
It was more of a poke
than a stab.

362
00:17:27,036 --> 00:17:29,571
Is that him?

363
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:31,012
What is he doing?

364
00:17:31,058 --> 00:17:33,549
Having second thoughts
about molesting stewardesses?

365
00:17:33,554 --> 00:17:35,727
- I need a band-aid.
- Hold on, sir.

366
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:38,214
We have to take care
of him, or he'll report <i>you.</i>

367
00:17:38,281 --> 00:17:41,183
Yeah, and after inviting
miss Havemeyer onto the scale...

368
00:17:41,251 --> 00:17:43,118
Okay,
I'll get the first aid kit.

369
00:17:43,186 --> 00:17:44,919
The first aid kit?
What for?

370
00:17:44,987 --> 00:17:47,454
Someone's bruised ego.
Can I help you?

371
00:17:47,923 --> 00:17:49,958
Um, since the plane
isn't full,

372
00:17:50,025 --> 00:17:52,593
I was wondering if I could
move my mother to first class.

373
00:17:52,661 --> 00:17:54,662
- Sure.
- Absolutely not.

374
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:57,565
I'm gonna let you two
sort this one out.

375
00:17:57,948 --> 00:17:58,907
First class?

376
00:17:58,954 --> 00:18:00,721
You're the one who sent me
back there.

377
00:18:00,734 --> 00:18:03,725
Yeah, scared to death.
Now you're upgrading her?

378
00:18:04,672 --> 00:18:06,403
Can we get you
anything else, sir?

379
00:18:06,427 --> 00:18:07,845
A tourniquet, maybe?

380
00:18:08,042 --> 00:18:09,351
Am I missing something?

381
00:18:09,369 --> 00:18:12,138
Besides the fact that mother
is a master manipulator?

382
00:18:12,347 --> 00:18:13,678
Kate.

383
00:18:15,943 --> 00:18:17,049
Evening, girls.

384
00:18:17,117 --> 00:18:18,128
Captain.

385
00:18:18,729 --> 00:18:20,786
Air sick.
Could be a while.

386
00:18:20,854 --> 00:18:23,622
I think the, uh,
economy lavatory is free.

387
00:18:24,301 --> 00:18:26,092
- That's okay.
- I'll wait.

388
00:18:26,159 --> 00:18:27,293
Okay.

389
00:18:27,361 --> 00:18:29,031
Excuse me.

390
00:18:33,956 --> 00:18:35,390
Everything okay back here?

391
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:38,933
Absolutely. Right as rain.

392
00:18:45,011 --> 00:18:47,645
Surprised you haven't
asked to take the helm yet.

393
00:18:47,713 --> 00:18:49,546
Oh, the night is young.

394
00:18:53,818 --> 00:18:55,719
I hear you've had
a rough evening.

395
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,411
Not very friendly, is he?

396
00:19:04,463 --> 00:19:05,629
No.

397
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,265
Do you have big plans
for Paris?

398
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:10,866
Little ones.

399
00:19:10,935 --> 00:19:13,202
Wander the streets,
take in the sights,

400
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:14,237
the smell.

401
00:19:14,305 --> 00:19:15,238
The smell?

402
00:19:15,306 --> 00:19:17,340
Yeah. Smells like home.

403
00:19:17,408 --> 00:19:19,842
What about you?
Big plans?

404
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:23,511
I was thinking of looking up
a friend I met at a club once.

405
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,114
I don't remember it
having a smell.

406
00:19:26,182 --> 00:19:29,000
Oh, no, with clubs,
it's more about the sound.

407
00:20:00,848 --> 00:20:02,148
You've been practicing
at home.

408
00:20:02,216 --> 00:20:05,419
With my pillow,
but she's all left feet.

409
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:11,923
Bridget! <i>Ca va?</i>

410
00:20:11,992 --> 00:20:14,994
Gaspar!
<i>Quel plaisir de vous voir.</i>

411
00:20:16,796 --> 00:20:19,431
Ah, Dean, this is Gaspar,
an old friend.

412
00:20:19,499 --> 00:20:21,286
Gaspar, <i>c'est mon
petit ami,</i> Dean.

413
00:20:21,287 --> 00:20:22,767
- Ah.
- It's nice to meet you.

414
00:20:22,764 --> 00:20:24,239
<i>Tout le plaisir</i>
<i>est pour Moi.</i>

415
00:20:24,411 --> 00:20:27,405
<i>Merci.</i>

416
00:20:27,992 --> 00:20:30,020
Shame he had to kiss
and run.

417
00:20:30,042 --> 00:20:31,809
He's bringing us champagne,
darling.

418
00:20:31,877 --> 00:20:33,311
Mm,
friends in high places.

419
00:20:33,379 --> 00:20:35,546
<i>C'est un tres bon ami.</i>

420
00:20:35,614 --> 00:20:37,648
I'm sorry.
You're English, yes?

421
00:20:37,716 --> 00:20:39,817
Is my French accent
that terrible?

422
00:20:39,854 --> 00:20:41,712
On the contrary.
You're just that beautiful.

423
00:20:41,767 --> 00:20:43,007
Hey, slow down there, buddy.

424
00:20:43,015 --> 00:20:44,775
With all due respect,
of course.

425
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:45,722
Of course.

426
00:20:45,789 --> 00:20:47,357
Would you happen
to have the time?

427
00:20:47,425 --> 00:20:49,692
I'm afraid my French
is bloody awful.

428
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,062
It's 2230.

429
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:53,596
Half past 11:00?

430
00:20:53,664 --> 00:20:54,731
10:00.

431
00:20:54,798 --> 00:20:55,798
Of course.

432
00:20:55,866 --> 00:20:57,699
Never was good
at military time.

433
00:20:57,767 --> 00:21:00,903
Enjoy your evening.
You're a lucky man.

434
00:21:01,502 --> 00:21:03,872
You know, I haven't heard that
since my boxing days.

435
00:21:06,176 --> 00:21:07,176
What?

436
00:21:07,244 --> 00:21:08,511
- Boxing?
- Well...

437
00:21:08,578 --> 00:21:10,692
- 2230.
- What are you, a general?

438
00:21:10,724 --> 00:21:13,486
No. Right now I'm a girl in
need of the powder room,

439
00:21:13,517 --> 00:21:15,216
and I shall leave <i>you</i>
in the capable hands

440
00:21:15,284 --> 00:21:16,617
of <i>monsieur</i> Gaspar.

441
00:21:16,685 --> 00:21:18,853
Bridget, you can't,
because I can't speak... French.

442
00:21:18,921 --> 00:21:22,910
<i>Monsieur, je vous sers?</i> 
<i>Ou bien preferez attendre?</i>

443
00:21:23,692 --> 00:21:27,530
Uh, yeah, it looks great.
Thank you. <i>Merci.</i>

444
00:21:29,397 --> 00:21:31,706
That's good. Thanks.

445
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,687
<i>Monsieur, vous-n'etes pas</i>
<i>satisfait de ce choix...</i>

446
00:21:48,718 --> 00:21:50,349
- Excuse me.
<i>- Monsieur!</i>

447
00:21:50,417 --> 00:21:52,285
Hey! Excuse me.

448
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:53,286
<i>- Monsieur!</i> 
- Hey!

449
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:55,020
<i>- Monsieur!</i> 
- You okay?

450
00:21:55,089 --> 00:21:56,889
- What the hell did he say to you?
- Nothing.

451
00:21:56,957 --> 00:21:58,057
N-nothing happened.

452
00:21:58,125 --> 00:21:59,258
Wait here. I'll be right back.

453
00:21:59,326 --> 00:22:01,993
Dean! No!
He was only being a boor!

454
00:22:02,061 --> 00:22:03,328
Dean!

455
00:22:13,466 --> 00:22:16,296
She'll be
screaming in about five minutes.

456
00:22:16,476 --> 00:22:18,175
Can you heat this up
for me?

457
00:22:18,684 --> 00:22:19,988
Miss?

458
00:22:20,055 --> 00:22:21,942
Oh, absolutely.

459
00:22:22,287 --> 00:22:24,388
Consider yourself lucky.
She actually bit me once.

460
00:22:24,451 --> 00:22:26,890
- Did she draw blood?
- Only a couple of pints.

461
00:22:27,309 --> 00:22:29,042
So how do I report her?

462
00:22:29,189 --> 00:22:30,787
Is there a form I fill out?
A telephone number?

463
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:33,286
I'll take care of it.
Throw her over my knee if I have to.

464
00:22:33,427 --> 00:22:34,357
I'm serious.

465
00:22:34,482 --> 00:22:37,930
I didn't pay $350 to fly to Paris
and get stabbed by the help.

466
00:22:38,008 --> 00:22:40,645
- You didn't pay for...
<i>- She'll</i> be disciplined.

467
00:22:41,481 --> 00:22:43,339
I guarantee you.
What are you drinking?

468
00:22:45,476 --> 00:22:46,609
Scotch.

469
00:22:46,677 --> 00:22:49,483
Maggie, what do you say
we fetch Mr. Elkins here

470
00:22:49,566 --> 00:22:51,661
a single malt
before landing?

471
00:22:53,365 --> 00:22:54,917
Make it a double.

472
00:22:55,509 --> 00:22:57,886
She'll bring it to your seat...
With bells on.

473
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,340
Call me
your guardian angel.

474
00:23:03,483 --> 00:23:05,385
Or superhero. Your choice.

475
00:23:05,452 --> 00:23:07,787
Shouldn't you be preparing
for landing?

476
00:23:07,854 --> 00:23:09,254
Maggie, that man was
gonna have you fired.

477
00:23:09,322 --> 00:23:11,123
I made him go away
for the cost of a drink.

478
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:13,127
It cost a lot more than that.

479
00:23:13,174 --> 00:23:14,693
You never have to see him again.

480
00:23:14,803 --> 00:23:16,461
Yeah, but I have to see you.

481
00:23:16,529 --> 00:23:18,196
I like you.
You speak your mind,

482
00:23:18,264 --> 00:23:20,933
and you're a scrapper,
but frankly, you keep this up,

483
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,693
you're not gonna be around
much longer.

484
00:23:23,303 --> 00:23:24,601
You have to be smart.

485
00:23:25,161 --> 00:23:26,575
He's in 3D.

486
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:32,376
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

487
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:34,578
<i>this is your captain speaking.</i> 
<i>Sunrise is in 15 minutes,</i>

488
00:23:34,646 --> 00:23:36,914
<i>and we'll be landing</i>
<i>shortly after.</i>

489
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:38,515
<i>Hope you all had</i>
<i>a pleasant flight...</i>

490
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:41,551
Mother's made reservations
at 7:00 in Montmartre.

491
00:23:41,618 --> 00:23:42,685
Time to feed
the prodigal daughter

492
00:23:42,753 --> 00:23:44,120
her fatted calf.

493
00:23:44,188 --> 00:23:45,355
For all three of us.

494
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:47,690
Oh, no. For all two of you.

495
00:23:47,758 --> 00:23:50,427
Kate, I think she's lonely.
She'll talk to you.

496
00:23:50,494 --> 00:23:52,128
From wayward daughter
to ambassador

497
00:23:52,196 --> 00:23:54,564
in one transcontinental.
I'm impressed.

498
00:23:54,631 --> 00:23:56,798
She bought a ticket.
She came all this way.

499
00:23:56,866 --> 00:23:58,067
That's a big gesture.

500
00:23:58,134 --> 00:24:01,536
Sure is. She's never
gotten on a plane for me.

501
00:24:01,604 --> 00:24:02,737
I'm sure she's wanted to.

502
00:24:02,805 --> 00:24:05,707
No, I'm sure she hasn't.

503
00:24:05,775 --> 00:24:07,742
Did she tell you that?

504
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:11,173
If you only had
ringside seats.

505
00:24:12,081 --> 00:24:14,182
Did she ask you
to clean out her closet,

506
00:24:14,249 --> 00:24:15,749
or did you volunteer?

507
00:24:15,817 --> 00:24:18,219
Was bridge club canceled,
or were you lying in wait?

508
00:24:18,287 --> 00:24:20,188
This is serious, Kate.

509
00:24:20,255 --> 00:24:22,423
What Laura did
is selfish and irresponsible.

510
00:24:22,491 --> 00:24:23,891
What Laura did
took real courage.

511
00:24:23,959 --> 00:24:25,126
I admire her for it.

512
00:24:25,194 --> 00:24:27,028
Running out
on a houseful of guests?

513
00:24:27,096 --> 00:24:28,728
Poor Greg is devastated.

514
00:24:28,796 --> 00:24:30,998
I wouldn't blame him if he were
through with her for good.

515
00:24:32,367 --> 00:24:34,501
I didn't say
she had good timing.

516
00:24:34,568 --> 00:24:37,237
She seemed perfectly content
until <i>you</i> arrived.

517
00:24:37,967 --> 00:24:40,975
Clearly, you weren't
looking closely enough.

518
00:24:41,409 --> 00:24:42,842
Cold feet are nothing new.

519
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:44,243
Reconsidering marriage

520
00:24:44,311 --> 00:24:45,744
doesn't mean she has to
move to Manhattan.

521
00:24:45,812 --> 00:24:47,713
Mother, Laura's reconsidering
her whole life.

522
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:48,847
Don't you understand that?

523
00:24:48,915 --> 00:24:50,149
And you're advising her?

524
00:24:50,217 --> 00:24:51,550
Absolutely.

525
00:24:51,618 --> 00:24:53,386
Ohh. You'll be off flying
around the world.

526
00:24:53,453 --> 00:24:55,787
What is Laura gonna do
in the city alone?

527
00:24:55,855 --> 00:24:58,690
Laura plans on
flying around the world, too.

528
00:24:58,758 --> 00:25:00,091
She's gonna tag along
with you?

529
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:03,395
Mother, Laura's applying
to Pan Am.

530
00:25:10,739 --> 00:25:12,640
No, no,
you're not taking her.

531
00:25:12,821 --> 00:25:15,023
Taking her?
No one is taking her, mother.

532
00:25:15,208 --> 00:25:17,262
If the life we've given you
isn't enough, fine,

533
00:25:17,293 --> 00:25:19,105
but don't infect
Laura with your...

534
00:25:19,106 --> 00:25:19,809
with my what?

535
00:25:19,877 --> 00:25:21,945
- Dissatisfaction.
- Dissatisfaction?

536
00:25:21,965 --> 00:25:23,932
I rode an elephant
in Bangkok last week.

537
00:25:24,573 --> 00:25:26,990
I watched the sun set over
Patagonia the week before that.

538
00:25:27,044 --> 00:25:28,845
Which is not nearly as
interesting as <i>you</i> think it is.

539
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:31,551
How would <i>you</i> know?
You don't even have a passport.

540
00:25:32,923 --> 00:25:34,557
If you wanna trot
around God-knows-where,

541
00:25:34,624 --> 00:25:37,660
throw your education away
to serve coffee to strange men

542
00:25:37,727 --> 00:25:39,642
and that sort of thing,
I can't stop you!

543
00:25:39,681 --> 00:25:40,992
What is
"that sort of thing"?

544
00:25:41,008 --> 00:25:42,441
But Laura is different.

545
00:25:42,455 --> 00:25:43,704
You mean special.

546
00:25:43,733 --> 00:25:45,234
She's impressionable.

547
00:25:45,302 --> 00:25:47,130
She wants
out of this driveway.

548
00:25:47,165 --> 00:25:49,065
She wants a taste
of something bigger.

549
00:25:49,468 --> 00:25:51,402
She needs me.

550
00:25:51,541 --> 00:25:53,007
Laura will be fine.

551
00:25:53,076 --> 00:25:54,276
How do you know that?

552
00:25:54,343 --> 00:25:56,010
Because I needed you, too!

553
00:25:57,413 --> 00:25:59,381
And I'm fine.

554
00:26:48,197 --> 00:26:51,399
Ugh! All right! All right.

555
00:26:55,538 --> 00:26:56,738
You're still sleeping?

556
00:26:56,806 --> 00:26:58,874
I <i>could</i> be.
It's 5:00 P.M.

557
00:26:58,941 --> 00:27:02,376
You flew all night,
slept all day. Paris awaits.

558
00:27:04,312 --> 00:27:05,679
Is Colette here?

559
00:27:06,686 --> 00:27:08,148
She's still sleeping.

560
00:27:08,216 --> 00:27:10,718
- No, no.
- No, I'm awake now.

561
00:27:10,785 --> 00:27:12,052
You sure?

562
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:15,856
Yeah, you're right.
Paris awaits.

563
00:27:15,924 --> 00:27:18,791
About that... I, uh,
did a little wandering.

564
00:27:18,859 --> 00:27:21,390
Had some trouble finding
that nightclub I mentioned.

565
00:27:21,422 --> 00:27:23,050
Mm, do you know the name?

566
00:27:23,117 --> 00:27:26,783
It's <i>Palace</i> or...
<i>Chez Palace</i>, maybe.

567
00:27:27,069 --> 00:27:28,768
Everybody keeps directing me
to Versailles.

568
00:27:28,836 --> 00:27:30,537
Oh. Placette. It's famous.

569
00:27:30,604 --> 00:27:33,472
Placette. And that explains it.
In St. Germain.

570
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,773
6th Arrondissement.

571
00:27:34,841 --> 00:27:36,721
Great. Thanks.

572
00:27:38,678 --> 00:27:41,513
Was there something else?

573
00:27:41,581 --> 00:27:45,884
Truth is, um...
I could use a favor.

574
00:27:49,083 --> 00:27:52,289
The concierge said Cafe Canard
should be right down there.

575
00:27:52,357 --> 00:27:54,659
Oh, and we need to remember
to get some French cheese.

576
00:27:54,726 --> 00:27:55,893
Cheese?

577
00:27:55,961 --> 00:27:57,795
For daddy.
Kate said he wanted cheese?

578
00:27:57,863 --> 00:27:59,263
I doubt that, dear.

579
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:00,860
Mother?

580
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,568
You can't give up on her.

581
00:28:04,345 --> 00:28:07,503
Oh, I don't intend to.
Trust me.

582
00:28:07,572 --> 00:28:09,639
Good. You know,
because the three of us

583
00:28:09,707 --> 00:28:12,208
can fly anywhere you like.
We can...

584
00:28:12,276 --> 00:28:14,110
We can explore
the whole world together.

585
00:28:14,785 --> 00:28:17,714
The whole world
is an awfully big place.

586
00:28:17,782 --> 00:28:19,716
Do you think
there's room for one more?

587
00:28:19,784 --> 00:28:22,651
Yes, we're allowed to get
tickets for daddy, too.

588
00:28:22,719 --> 00:28:25,054
I wasn't talking
about your father.

589
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:31,594
You brought Greg?

590
00:28:31,661 --> 00:28:33,228
Now, Laura,
he's a good man,

591
00:28:33,296 --> 00:28:34,863
and he loves you.

592
00:28:34,931 --> 00:28:37,365
And you loved him enough
to want to marry him.

593
00:28:38,345 --> 00:28:41,390
So all that stuff you said
on the plane...

594
00:28:44,913 --> 00:28:46,551
Kate was right about you.

595
00:28:46,629 --> 00:28:49,954
I meant what I said, but Greg
deserves an opportunity to...

596
00:28:50,407 --> 00:28:52,080
Laura!

597
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:54,431
Laura?

598
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,105
Laura?

599
00:29:05,342 --> 00:29:07,293
What did she do?

600
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:11,403
Oh.

601
00:29:13,566 --> 00:29:15,452
As you remembered?</i>

602
00:29:15,758 --> 00:29:17,569
Well, it's not quite as busy.

603
00:29:18,052 --> 00:29:19,455
It's early.

604
00:29:20,907 --> 00:29:23,575
I came here first
when I was 19

605
00:29:23,644 --> 00:29:25,623
with a boy
who was an artist.

606
00:29:26,345 --> 00:29:29,814
He fed me drinks until
I agreed to let him paint me.

607
00:29:29,882 --> 00:29:31,082
How'd that come out?

608
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:33,818
Mm, depends on your taste.

609
00:29:33,886 --> 00:29:36,988
He was a surrealist.
I had four noses.

610
00:29:37,056 --> 00:29:39,724
Yeah, but think of all
- the smelling you could do. - Oh.

611
00:29:43,417 --> 00:29:45,228
My favor...

612
00:29:46,193 --> 00:29:48,899
Uh,
it wasn't getting me here.

613
00:29:50,392 --> 00:29:52,876
Bridget introduced me
to this place,

614
00:29:53,521 --> 00:29:58,155
and I think the... maitre d'
is a good friend of hers.

615
00:29:58,827 --> 00:30:01,610
And you came to ask him
if he knows where she is.

616
00:30:02,105 --> 00:30:03,880
Yeah, but the only problem
is that...

617
00:30:03,947 --> 00:30:05,377
You don't speak French.

618
00:30:05,526 --> 00:30:06,783
Yeah.

619
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:08,379
Let's see what
he has to say.

620
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:09,701
<i>Garcon?</i>

621
00:30:10,154 --> 00:30:11,854
<i>Mademoiselle, bonsoir.</i>

622
00:30:11,922 --> 00:30:13,689
<i>Bonsoir.</i>

623
00:30:13,756 --> 00:30:15,578
<i>Vous connaissez</i> Bridget Pierce?

624
00:30:15,659 --> 00:30:17,593
Bridget? <i>Oui, oui.</i>

625
00:30:21,165 --> 00:30:21,638
No.

626
00:30:21,639 --> 00:30:23,258
<i>Mais vous devez bien</i>
<i>vous souvenir de lui?</i>

627
00:30:23,278 --> 00:30:25,376
<i>Non, je vous l'ai deja dit.</i> 
<i>J'en suis desole.</i>

628
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:28,242
- So what... what is he saying?
- He doesn't remember you.

629
00:30:28,404 --> 00:30:31,305
- But he remembers Bridget, right?
- Yeah, they're old friends.

630
00:30:31,372 --> 00:30:33,605
Okay, so does he know
where she is? Do...

631
00:30:33,652 --> 00:30:36,043
<i>Et Bridget? Pouvez-vous</i>
<i>me dire ou Elle est?</i>

632
00:30:36,111 --> 00:30:38,079
<i>Le capitaine</i>
<i>l'a demandee en mariage.</i>

633
00:30:39,781 --> 00:30:40,767
Why is he laughing?

634
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,219
<i>Pas etonnant</i>
<i>qu'elle ait disparu.</i>

635
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:44,218
<i>Pourquoi vous dites ca?</i>

636
00:30:44,285 --> 00:30:45,853
Bridget <i>aime bien</i>
<i>ses petits copains,</i>

637
00:30:45,921 --> 00:30:48,566
<i>mais son mari... Elle l'adore.</i>

638
00:30:51,826 --> 00:30:53,960
What... what is it?
What'd he say?

639
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,896
Colette?

640
00:30:58,773 --> 00:31:02,931
He said... she may like
her boyfriends,

641
00:31:03,306 --> 00:31:06,272
but she loves her husband.

642
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:18,773
You had to do it,
didn't you?

643
00:31:18,832 --> 00:31:21,223
Kate, Laura running from
her problems doesn't solve them.

644
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:23,194
Oh, you were so close.

645
00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:25,857
You were so close
to getting your daughter back.

646
00:31:25,924 --> 00:31:26,991
Which one?

647
00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:28,493
The one you want.

648
00:31:28,561 --> 00:31:29,467
I want both of you.

649
00:31:29,491 --> 00:31:31,406
No...
Pardon me.

650
00:31:31,697 --> 00:31:33,465
Might you have the time?

651
00:31:35,665 --> 00:31:37,598
It's 2100...

652
00:31:38,245 --> 00:31:40,090
Hours.

653
00:32:09,334 --> 00:32:11,187
It's good to see you.

654
00:32:11,413 --> 00:32:15,411
Bridget, where have you been?

655
00:32:16,068 --> 00:32:19,775
Nowhere. I'm a ghost
at the moment.

656
00:32:20,479 --> 00:32:22,661
Why didn't they tell me
I was meeting you?

657
00:32:23,436 --> 00:32:25,521
Do you have the package?

658
00:32:36,129 --> 00:32:37,393
A gift.

659
00:32:37,603 --> 00:32:39,080
How ironic,

660
00:32:39,148 --> 00:32:41,475
considering what
I've had to give up for it.

661
00:32:42,639 --> 00:32:43,939
Dean.

662
00:32:45,987 --> 00:32:47,648
How is he?

663
00:32:48,862 --> 00:32:52,059
It isn't the first time I've
heard of a secret marriage.

664
00:32:53,019 --> 00:32:55,196
For girls who want
to keep working,

665
00:32:55,216 --> 00:32:57,016
it's the only way.

666
00:33:01,532 --> 00:33:03,188
Dean...

667
00:33:03,694 --> 00:33:06,214
I saw the way
she would look at you.

668
00:33:11,859 --> 00:33:15,337
Okay. Let's get you home.

669
00:33:16,857 --> 00:33:19,138
What's inside?

670
00:33:21,746 --> 00:33:23,747
My future.

671
00:33:26,623 --> 00:33:28,349
Couple of months ago,

672
00:33:28,963 --> 00:33:32,584
I was meant to take a picture
of a man at a local airport,

673
00:33:33,455 --> 00:33:35,322
but I missed him.

674
00:33:36,371 --> 00:33:39,754
So I tracked him down on my own,
and I got the shot.

675
00:33:40,795 --> 00:33:42,674
<i>Dean was with me</i>
<i>when I dropped off the film...</i>

676
00:33:42,713 --> 00:33:43,736
It's nice to meet you.

677
00:33:43,775 --> 00:33:45,798
<i>To the C.I.A. liaison</i>
<i>at a Parisian nightclub.</i>

678
00:33:45,866 --> 00:33:47,132
<i>Champagne?</i>

679
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,382
<i>All routine</i>
<i>until a mi-6 agent appeared</i>

680
00:33:51,379 --> 00:33:52,781
<i>and told me</i>
<i>that I'd been compromised</i>

681
00:33:52,803 --> 00:33:54,491
<i>whilst taking the picture.</i>

682
00:33:56,690 --> 00:33:59,332
At first
they deactivated me,

683
00:34:00,046 --> 00:34:01,813
and I resumed
my normal life.

684
00:34:01,881 --> 00:34:03,560
But eventually,

685
00:34:04,016 --> 00:34:05,917
it was decided...

686
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:08,820
That for my own safety,

687
00:34:09,372 --> 00:34:11,387
I should become...

688
00:34:15,499 --> 00:34:20,431
Elizabeth Reese
of Kansas City, Missouri.

689
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,201
Good God.

690
00:34:26,505 --> 00:34:28,906
I mean, where on Earth
is Missouri?

691
00:34:30,121 --> 00:34:32,710
Bridget, I'm so sorry.

692
00:34:33,134 --> 00:34:35,412
They wanted you
to deliver this

693
00:34:35,479 --> 00:34:37,714
so that you would see
what happens

694
00:34:37,782 --> 00:34:40,517
if you don't follow orders
to the letter.

695
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:44,388
But I have another
unauthorized message.

696
00:34:45,035 --> 00:34:48,901
You volunteered for this.
They will let you out.

697
00:34:49,393 --> 00:34:51,360
The thrill of it...

698
00:34:51,428 --> 00:34:54,231
The good that you hope
you are doing

699
00:34:55,062 --> 00:34:57,934
is not worth
losing everything, Kate.

700
00:34:59,063 --> 00:35:00,669
But I don't want out.

701
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:04,640
Does that mean I'm crazy?

702
00:35:06,875 --> 00:35:08,242
No.

703
00:35:09,975 --> 00:35:12,032
It means I was right
to recommend you.

704
00:35:28,847 --> 00:35:31,450
You'd think I would have
practiced what to say next.

705
00:35:45,713 --> 00:35:46,947
Where are the flowers?

706
00:35:47,014 --> 00:35:50,248
Oh, I gave them to an old lady
in the lobby.

707
00:35:50,885 --> 00:35:52,193
They were a bad idea.

708
00:35:52,258 --> 00:35:53,263
They were nice.

709
00:35:53,296 --> 00:35:54,730
The old lady
was very excited.

710
00:35:55,198 --> 00:35:57,662
Hugs, messy kisses.

711
00:35:57,991 --> 00:35:59,558
Exactly what I was
hoping for, really.

712
00:35:59,626 --> 00:36:02,995
Just... not from her.

713
00:36:04,831 --> 00:36:06,369
Greg.

714
00:36:07,166 --> 00:36:09,451
I am so sorry.

715
00:36:10,435 --> 00:36:12,637
I really meant to marry you.
I did.

716
00:36:12,705 --> 00:36:15,640
But then suddenly,
I put on that wedding dress,

717
00:36:15,708 --> 00:36:19,303
and I thought, "here I go."

718
00:36:19,717 --> 00:36:22,381
My last great adventure.

719
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:26,764
And then I realized...

720
00:36:27,251 --> 00:36:31,731
I was only 22, and I'd hardly
had any great adventures.

721
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:34,057
You don't think starting
a family is an adventure?

722
00:36:34,077 --> 00:36:35,778
Well, sure it is.
It's just not...

723
00:36:35,808 --> 00:36:36,974
Paris.

724
00:36:39,022 --> 00:36:40,898
You still finish
my sentences.

725
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:45,401
You are still the prettiest girl
I have ever laid eyes on.

726
00:36:48,678 --> 00:36:51,240
You need to let me go.

727
00:36:59,351 --> 00:37:03,818
When I was 15,
I read a story in "Boys' Life"

728
00:37:03,886 --> 00:37:06,721
about climbing Kilimanjaro.

729
00:37:06,789 --> 00:37:10,391
And it seemed about
as far away as the moon,

730
00:37:10,459 --> 00:37:13,862
but I mowed lawns all summer
so that I could make the trek.

731
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:16,931
Saved almost $300.

732
00:37:16,998 --> 00:37:21,343
Wasn't enough by a long shot,
but I put it in the bank,

733
00:37:21,397 --> 00:37:23,003
and I swore that someday

734
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:25,239
that money would go
towards adventure.

735
00:37:25,778 --> 00:37:28,176
And what did you
spend it on?

736
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:31,253
A ring.

737
00:37:32,547 --> 00:37:34,881
Th-that's not the point.

738
00:37:34,949 --> 00:37:39,219
The point is, if what
you're leaving me for is...

739
00:37:39,287 --> 00:37:40,720
Kilimanjaro?

740
00:37:42,656 --> 00:37:44,991
Then bon voyage, Laura.

741
00:37:46,659 --> 00:37:49,228
Safe journey.

742
00:37:59,372 --> 00:38:02,373
Well, I don't understand
a word you're staying.

743
00:38:02,441 --> 00:38:06,043
Hey! Hey! There she is!
The tenderizer.

744
00:38:06,112 --> 00:38:07,512
Come on! That was funny.

745
00:38:09,047 --> 00:38:12,950
Hey, I-if you lost your key,
you're welcome to stay with us.

746
00:38:13,018 --> 00:38:15,456
Oh, I almost forgot.

747
00:38:15,964 --> 00:38:19,389
I got you a little present.

748
00:38:32,903 --> 00:38:35,804
You know, I actually
learned something today.

749
00:38:36,203 --> 00:38:40,610
Don't... piss off...
Maggie Ryan.

750
00:38:43,947 --> 00:38:46,015
I know what my job is.

751
00:38:46,082 --> 00:38:48,065
For the price
of their ticket,

752
00:38:48,151 --> 00:38:51,353
businessmen get to flirt
with pretty women.

753
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:53,522
And I can handle flirts.

754
00:38:53,589 --> 00:38:55,990
I can handle
the personal grooming checks,

755
00:38:56,058 --> 00:39:00,762
the weigh-ins, the boozy jerk
that crosses the line.

756
00:39:01,055 --> 00:39:04,999
But what I can't handle
is that you made it okay

757
00:39:05,067 --> 00:39:07,934
for him to try that again
with another girl.

758
00:39:11,276 --> 00:39:12,706
M-Maggie...

759
00:39:31,458 --> 00:39:34,194
What do you want?

760
00:39:48,708 --> 00:39:51,876
One stamp.
It's impressive.

761
00:39:51,944 --> 00:39:54,179
Look at the date
it was issued.

762
00:40:03,622 --> 00:40:05,823
The summer
I became stewardess?

763
00:40:09,561 --> 00:40:10,960
I tried.

764
00:40:14,498 --> 00:40:16,333
I need you, too.

765
00:40:27,144 --> 00:40:29,411
We were supposed
to take a right

766
00:40:29,479 --> 00:40:32,048
at <i>Rue chat qui danse.</i>

767
00:40:35,185 --> 00:40:36,953
You're laughing at me.

768
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:40,790
The French girl who got
lost in France? No.

769
00:40:40,858 --> 00:40:43,825
You're the one who wanted
to wander.

770
00:40:43,893 --> 00:40:45,593
Besides, I wasn't lost.

771
00:40:46,581 --> 00:40:49,798
No, I was bewildered
by the moment.

772
00:40:50,959 --> 00:40:52,960
Shall we?

773
00:40:53,169 --> 00:40:56,471
How do you say "lost"
in French?

774
00:40:56,538 --> 00:40:57,906
<i>Perdu.</i>

775
00:40:58,575 --> 00:40:59,902
<i>Perdu.</i>

776
00:41:01,243 --> 00:41:03,745
I am... <i>Perdu.</i>

777
00:41:03,785 --> 00:41:05,318
No. No.

778
00:41:05,837 --> 00:41:08,783
<i>Nous... sommes perdus.</i>

779
00:41:08,988 --> 00:41:11,986
We... are... lost.

780
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:19,292
What are you doing?

781
00:41:25,845 --> 00:41:29,565
<i>Nous sommes...</i>

782
00:41:30,037 --> 00:41:31,069
Dancing.

783
00:41:36,286 --> 00:41:40,011
You smell like
whiskey and cigarettes.

784
00:41:40,579 --> 00:41:43,380
And you smell like Paris.
