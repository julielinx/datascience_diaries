1
00:00:01,461 --> 00:00:02,729
<i>Previously on "Pan Am"...</i>

2
00:00:02,796 --> 00:00:06,064
Let's keep it in New York,
Ginny. Monte Carlo was a lark.

3
00:00:06,348 --> 00:00:08,949
It's likely to be
a long trip.

4
00:00:09,016 --> 00:00:10,083
I'm doing what I must.

5
00:00:10,151 --> 00:00:12,419
Good-bye, Kate.

6
00:00:12,486 --> 00:00:15,555
How old were you
when the Nazis occupied France?

7
00:00:15,622 --> 00:00:17,257
I was 3.

8
00:00:17,925 --> 00:00:19,692
I'm flying.

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,461
<i>I</i> am in charge in the air,

10
00:00:21,528 --> 00:00:24,764
and what <i>I</i> say
and what <i>I</i> do is the law.

11
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:26,466
And a sky God is born!

12
00:00:26,533 --> 00:00:28,601
Hey, call it
whatever you want.

13
00:00:28,669 --> 00:00:31,103
You either accept it
or you need to get another jet.

14
00:00:33,282 --> 00:00:36,182
<i>Attention passengers
of Flight 296 to London, Heathrow.</i>

15
00:00:36,276 --> 00:00:39,411
That hurricane's stepping
on everything heading South.

16
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,412
It hasn't stepped
on us yet.

17
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,379
Well...

18
00:00:41,447 --> 00:00:43,482
Well... <i>Hello.</i>

19
00:00:43,549 --> 00:00:45,283
Hello.

20
00:00:45,351 --> 00:00:47,018
Laura,
this is Charles Moore.

21
00:00:47,086 --> 00:00:48,987
He's gonna be navigating us
down to Venezuela today.

22
00:00:49,054 --> 00:00:50,889
My friends call me Chuck.

23
00:00:50,957 --> 00:00:52,557
I'll let you know
when you can call me Chuck.

24
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:56,927
Okay.
What happened to Sanjeev?

25
00:00:56,995 --> 00:00:57,928
Vacation. Bombay.

26
00:00:57,996 --> 00:00:58,929
There's an oxymoron.

27
00:01:00,164 --> 00:01:02,566
Excuse me.

28
00:01:02,634 --> 00:01:04,468
Colette!

29
00:01:04,536 --> 00:01:06,871
Put your eyes
back in their sockets.

30
00:01:06,938 --> 00:01:08,405
She's a waste of your time.

31
00:01:08,473 --> 00:01:09,740
Valuables under
lock and key?

32
00:01:09,808 --> 00:01:10,941
She's waiting for Mr. Right.

33
00:01:11,009 --> 00:01:12,709
She's very patient.

34
00:01:16,647 --> 00:01:18,681
Hey, Bob, do you have
the latest weather maps?

35
00:01:18,749 --> 00:01:20,416
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

36
00:01:21,986 --> 00:01:24,286
Are we in
for some bad weather?

37
00:01:24,354 --> 00:01:27,991
Well, it's October.
'tis the season.

38
00:01:28,058 --> 00:01:30,091
Well, if you need any help
in the cockpit,

39
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,760
I do have experience.

40
00:01:31,828 --> 00:01:33,495
Yeah, so one lesson.
Now you're the expert?

41
00:01:33,563 --> 00:01:36,431
Experts don't appreciate it
as much as amateurs.

42
00:01:36,499 --> 00:01:38,667
It loses its thrill.

43
00:01:38,735 --> 00:01:42,270
Big storm brewing between us
and Caracas. Massive even.

44
00:01:42,338 --> 00:01:45,139
Have they given this one a name yet?

45
00:01:45,206 --> 00:01:47,608
We should probably
discuss this later.

46
00:01:47,676 --> 00:01:48,676
Depends on the weather.

47
00:01:48,744 --> 00:01:50,845
Uh, I-I'm forgetting
my meteorology,

48
00:01:50,913 --> 00:01:53,280
but what is the technical term
for a destructive squall

49
00:01:53,348 --> 00:01:56,450
with wind speeds exceeding
73 miles per hour?

50
00:01:56,518 --> 00:01:59,954
It's not a tropical storm
but a...  Oh...

51
00:02:00,022 --> 00:02:02,221
- Hurricane!
- That's what it is.

52
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:03,790
Well, they must have named
it something.

53
00:02:03,858 --> 00:02:05,291
Uh, it's Ginny.

54
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:09,328
Hurricane Ginny!
Oh! What are the odds?

55
00:02:09,396 --> 00:02:12,231
- What? 
- Captain.

56
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:14,568
Why did the gives
hurricans names anyway?

57
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:18,237
And the girls name.

58
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:22,241
Of all the female names
that start with a "G"...

59
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:23,576
Georgia,

60
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,744
uh, Geraldine, Gina...

61
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,214
And we're flying
right into it.

62
00:02:28,282 --> 00:02:30,416
Have you checked
the returns on the radar?

63
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:31,850
Ohh.

64
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:34,352
Recommend we change heading
to... 10 miles right of track.

65
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,987
Mm. 5 should do it.

66
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:38,557
You're ignoring
the cosmic, uh, signals here.

67
00:02:38,624 --> 00:02:40,892
It's... it's like the universe is
giving you a second chance

68
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,760
to avoid Ginny, and you're
still not taking it.

69
00:02:42,828 --> 00:02:43,895
Where do I get her number?

70
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:46,731
God. See, I wish I had
an ejector seat.

71
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:49,067
Gerda. 1961 was Gerda.

72
00:02:49,134 --> 00:02:50,067
Right.

73
00:02:52,337 --> 00:02:53,737
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're about to experience

74
00:02:53,805 --> 00:02:55,139
some rough weather.

75
00:02:55,207 --> 00:02:57,408
I'm gonna ask you to keep
your seat belts fastened.

76
00:03:00,612 --> 00:03:04,014
Here comes Ginny. I wonder which
one will be more destructive.

77
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:12,122
Landing card?

78
00:03:12,189 --> 00:03:13,256
Thank you.

79
00:03:13,324 --> 00:03:14,624
- Landing card.
- Thank you so much.

80
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:18,394
Sorry it's such
a full flight, Miguel.

81
00:03:18,462 --> 00:03:20,896
We won't have a chance
to catch up.

82
00:03:20,964 --> 00:03:22,598
Mm.

83
00:03:22,665 --> 00:03:24,566
A situation
which must be remedied.

84
00:03:24,634 --> 00:03:26,401
Mm. I'm having a small gathering

85
00:03:26,469 --> 00:03:29,238
on my boat in the Gulf
tomorrow evening.

86
00:03:29,305 --> 00:03:33,242
Will you and your girlfriends
still be on layover?

87
00:03:34,477 --> 00:03:36,445
Absolutely.

88
00:03:36,513 --> 00:03:38,912
Then it's a date.

89
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,748
He keeps
his boat out at night?

90
00:03:40,815 --> 00:03:42,583
Sweetie, when Miguel says
"boat," he's referring

91
00:03:42,651 --> 00:03:46,287
to his 80-foot yacht,
and a "small gathering"

92
00:03:46,355 --> 00:03:48,756
is a hundred of
his most glamorous friends.

93
00:03:53,794 --> 00:03:56,095
Good evening, Mr. Belson.
How can I help you?

94
00:03:56,164 --> 00:03:58,231
I was hoping I'd get
the pretty one.

95
00:03:58,299 --> 00:03:59,566
Must be my lucky day.

96
00:03:59,634 --> 00:04:02,569
Are you a diplomat
or a playboy, Mr. Belson?

97
00:04:02,637 --> 00:04:05,372
Please, dear,
call me Henry.

98
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,007
Oh, well, only if
you call me Kate.

99
00:04:09,376 --> 00:04:11,544
Is this normal, Kate?

100
00:04:11,611 --> 00:04:13,212
I mean, you know,
feeling like

101
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,247
you're in a,
washing machine?

102
00:04:15,315 --> 00:04:17,650
It's as normal
as snow at Christmas.

103
00:04:17,717 --> 00:04:19,552
The air we're flying through
just changed directions,

104
00:04:19,619 --> 00:04:21,387
that's all.

105
00:04:23,356 --> 00:04:24,356
Let me get you some water.

106
00:04:24,424 --> 00:04:26,391
No. Oh, no.
All this shaking?

107
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:29,828
I'm... you know, I might take
my second bath today.

108
00:04:29,896 --> 00:04:33,631
Is this your first time
flying, Henry?

109
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:38,436
Yeah. This trip was,
uh, 40 years in the making.

110
00:04:39,972 --> 00:04:44,374
Lot of Mason jars filled up
with spare change in that time.

111
00:04:44,442 --> 00:04:47,712
Well, as a seasoned traveler,
let me give you my cure

112
00:04:47,779 --> 00:04:49,046
for turbulence.

113
00:04:49,114 --> 00:04:50,581
Staying home?

114
00:04:50,648 --> 00:04:52,917
Distraction.

115
00:04:52,984 --> 00:04:55,419
Uh, well, I knew this was
my lucky day.

116
00:04:57,655 --> 00:04:59,155
You got a fella?

117
00:04:59,223 --> 00:05:00,924
Oh, not anymore.

118
00:05:00,991 --> 00:05:02,358
Ohh.

119
00:05:02,426 --> 00:05:07,363
A beautiful redhead
broke my heart once, too.

120
00:05:07,431 --> 00:05:09,733
Henry,
I wasn't the heartbreaker.

121
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,702
Well,
that's hard to believe.

122
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:18,406
I guess grief is the price
we pay for love, huh?

123
00:05:21,611 --> 00:05:26,048
See that? A quick conversation,
and the worst is over.

124
00:05:26,116 --> 00:05:29,551
Well, we're still 30,000 feet
above the Earth.

125
00:05:29,619 --> 00:05:31,219
What brings you
all the way up here

126
00:05:31,287 --> 00:05:33,722
after 40 years?

127
00:05:33,789 --> 00:05:35,390
Uh...

128
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:36,725
Henry?

129
00:05:36,792 --> 00:05:37,892
- Henry?
- Ohh.

130
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,527
Oh. Henry, what's...
What's wrong?

131
00:05:39,595 --> 00:05:40,562
I can't breathe.

132
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:44,399
Uh, has this happened
before?

133
00:05:44,467 --> 00:05:45,667
No?
Never.

134
00:05:45,735 --> 00:05:47,067
- Aah!
- Oh! Henry.

135
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:48,201
Uh...
Aah.

136
00:05:49,304 --> 00:05:52,072
Fuel at 19 North will be
48,000 pounds.

137
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,674
I've got a heart attack.

138
00:05:53,742 --> 00:05:55,576
You look okay to me.

139
00:05:55,644 --> 00:05:57,578
Maggie's checking for a doctor,
but he needs a hospital.

140
00:05:57,646 --> 00:05:59,723
Well, it can't be Miami.
The hurricane just hit the Florida coast.

141
00:05:59,724 --> 00:06:00,581
Find somewhere!

142
00:06:00,649 --> 00:06:03,182
If we don't land now,
this man is going to die!

143
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:10,721
Sync and corrected by dr.jackson
for www.addic7ed.com

144
00:06:16,614 --> 00:06:17,881
Where is
the nearest airport?

145
00:06:17,948 --> 00:06:19,549
Are we really doing this?

146
00:06:19,617 --> 00:06:21,885
He needs a doctor.
Grab the notams.

147
00:06:21,952 --> 00:06:23,887
Uh, Port-au-Prince is
the closest.

148
00:06:23,954 --> 00:06:26,088
Uh, the Dominican Republic
is friendlier.

149
00:06:26,156 --> 00:06:29,157
No, the runway's still ripped up
from the last hurricane.

150
00:06:29,225 --> 00:06:30,292
Haiti's clear.

151
00:06:30,359 --> 00:06:33,395
You realize voodoo is an
acceptable form of medicine there.

152
00:06:35,498 --> 00:06:37,733
Port-au-Prince tower,
Clipper 203.

153
00:06:41,704 --> 00:06:44,406
I think you need
to elevate his legs.

154
00:06:44,473 --> 00:06:45,573
That's for back pain.

155
00:06:45,641 --> 00:06:47,108
We appreciate your concern,

156
00:06:47,176 --> 00:06:48,743
but we need to keep
this area clear,

157
00:06:48,811 --> 00:06:52,247
so if you could please
return to your seats?

158
00:06:52,315 --> 00:06:54,316
I found
the flight service manual.

159
00:06:54,383 --> 00:06:55,317
Oh, that's useless.

160
00:06:55,384 --> 00:06:57,152
Uh, "treatment is
absolute rest."

161
00:06:57,219 --> 00:06:58,519
"Make comfortable.
If breathing is difficult,

162
00:06:58,587 --> 00:07:00,354
prop up pillows."

163
00:07:00,422 --> 00:07:02,923
That's it? That's all
they expect us to do?

164
00:07:02,991 --> 00:07:05,459
Told you. Useless.

165
00:07:05,526 --> 00:07:07,027
Thank you.

166
00:07:07,095 --> 00:07:08,695
Ohh.

167
00:07:08,763 --> 00:07:11,031
You're gonna be all right,
Henry.

168
00:07:11,099 --> 00:07:13,767
The captain is working on
how to get you more help.

169
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:18,371
Why aren't they answering?
We should be in range by now.

170
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:20,974
Nature's way of telling you
you're making a mistake.

171
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:25,378
Port-au-Prince tower,
Clipper 203 is a Boeing 707.

172
00:07:25,446 --> 00:07:27,280
Requesting to make
an unscheduled landing

173
00:07:27,348 --> 00:07:28,281
for a medical emergency.

174
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:31,050
<i>L'aéroport est fermé.</i>

175
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:33,352
What the hell is that?
Are you on the right channel?

176
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:37,189
Port-au-Prince tower,
Clipper 203. Do you read me?

177
00:07:38,757 --> 00:07:40,725
<i>Nous ne pouvons pas...</i>

178
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:43,161
Why is he speaking French?

179
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:51,568
Miss, a refill?

180
00:07:51,636 --> 00:07:54,205
We're not serving drinks, sir.

181
00:07:54,272 --> 00:07:56,673
Sorry.
I had a minor collision.

182
00:07:56,741 --> 00:07:59,510
Well, we, uh, we have
to land in Port-au-Prince,

183
00:07:59,577 --> 00:08:01,645
but they're only responding in French.

184
00:08:01,713 --> 00:08:03,847
Don't air traffic controllers
have to speak English?

185
00:08:03,915 --> 00:08:05,148
Yeah. Here. Talk to 'em.

186
00:08:05,216 --> 00:08:06,249
I want you to tell
the Port-au-Prince tower

187
00:08:06,317 --> 00:08:08,184
we have a passenger onboard
that will die

188
00:08:08,252 --> 00:08:09,686
if we don't get him
on the ground.

189
00:08:09,754 --> 00:08:11,321
<i>Port-au-Prince,</i>
<i>nous avons un passager mourant.</i>

190
00:08:11,389 --> 00:08:14,057
You're letting a stewardess talk
to the control tower.

191
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:15,358
Do you speak French?

192
00:08:15,426 --> 00:08:17,193
<i>Vous n'avez pas l'autorisation.</i>

193
00:08:17,261 --> 00:08:18,194
What are you looking for?

194
00:08:18,262 --> 00:08:19,496
Uh, a plan "B."

195
00:08:19,564 --> 00:08:21,697
The Haitians kicked out
the American military in July.

196
00:08:21,765 --> 00:08:23,165
I-I l... I laid eyes
on the poor bastard.

197
00:08:23,233 --> 00:08:24,567
He doesn't have time for plan "A".

198
00:08:24,635 --> 00:08:26,168
- Shh. - <i>L'aéroport est
fermé</i> <i>pour la nuit.</i>

199
00:08:26,236 --> 00:08:27,503
- Here. You know what?
<i>- Il n'y a personne</i>

200
00:08:27,571 --> 00:08:29,872
<i>à la tour de contrôle</i>
<i>pour vous guider.</i>

201
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,440
<i>Il doit y avoir quelqu'un!</i>
<i>C'est une urgence.</i>

202
00:08:31,508 --> 00:08:33,342
What is it?

203
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:35,210
The airport is closed.

204
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:36,711
There is no one in the tower
to help you land.

205
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:38,112
I... we don't need anyone.

206
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,280
No air traffic controller?

207
00:08:39,348 --> 00:08:40,849
Shouldn't we be aborting
this landing?

208
00:08:40,917 --> 00:08:42,216
Tell him that
we're starting our descent.

209
00:08:42,284 --> 00:08:43,518
Request visual
for Runway 10.

210
00:08:45,655 --> 00:08:46,855
<i>Visuelle pour la piste dix.</i>

211
00:08:46,923 --> 00:08:48,122
We're doing a visual?

212
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:50,224
If you can't handle it, then tell me now.

213
00:08:50,292 --> 00:08:52,427
Chuck can handle it.
Can't you, Chuck?

214
00:08:57,231 --> 00:08:59,833
Ladies and gentlemen,
due to a medical emergency,

215
00:08:59,901 --> 00:09:01,001
we're going to make
an unscheduled landing

216
00:09:01,069 --> 00:09:02,302
in Port-au-Prince, Haiti.

217
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:04,438
We anticipate only
a short stop.

218
00:09:04,505 --> 00:09:06,139
<i>We'll be back</i>
<i>on our way to Caracas.</i>

219
00:09:06,207 --> 00:09:08,308
<i>Cabin crew, please prepare</i>
<i>for landing.</i>

220
00:09:11,745 --> 00:09:14,513
Uh, I'm sorry. I'm going
to need that back.

221
00:09:14,582 --> 00:09:16,182
When do you think
we'll be in Caracas?

222
00:09:16,249 --> 00:09:18,818
I have family meeting me
at the airport.

223
00:09:18,886 --> 00:09:23,355
Everyone, please buckle in.
Let me know if you need help.

224
00:09:23,423 --> 00:09:25,023
I'm sorry.

225
00:09:29,896 --> 00:09:33,164
All right.
Descending to 3,000 feet.

226
00:09:34,266 --> 00:09:35,734
Still total darkness.

227
00:09:35,802 --> 00:09:37,703
Let's go ahead and get
our lights on.

228
00:09:39,505 --> 00:09:41,038
It's gonna be like landing
in a black hole.

229
00:09:41,106 --> 00:09:42,039
Still not helping, Chuck.

230
00:09:42,107 --> 00:09:43,373
We need runway lights.

231
00:09:43,441 --> 00:09:44,374
They haven't come on yet?

232
00:09:44,442 --> 00:09:45,943
No.

233
00:09:48,614 --> 00:09:50,214
Let's go flaps 30,

234
00:09:50,281 --> 00:09:51,616
gear down
before landing checks.

235
00:09:51,683 --> 00:09:53,951
Flaps at 30. Gear down.

236
00:09:54,019 --> 00:09:56,920
In Haiti, that could mean
they're looking for flashlights.

237
00:09:56,988 --> 00:09:59,623
They're working on it.

238
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:01,124
Is everyone strapped in
back there?

239
00:10:01,191 --> 00:10:02,859
Kate's on top of it.
Hold on.

240
00:10:02,927 --> 00:10:05,194
Ohh.

241
00:10:07,031 --> 00:10:09,332
Descend to 1,000 feet.

242
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:11,300
Descending to 1,000 feet.

243
00:10:11,368 --> 00:10:12,502
Colette, tell them
we're landing now.

244
00:10:12,569 --> 00:10:13,502
If they don't want me
to hit the tower,

245
00:10:13,569 --> 00:10:15,070
they can give me lights.

246
00:10:15,138 --> 00:10:16,872
<i>Nous allon d'atterrir.</i>
<i>Ou sont les lumieres?</i>

247
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:17,873
We may have to go around.

248
00:10:17,941 --> 00:10:18,907
We'll lose
at least 20 minutes.

249
00:10:18,975 --> 00:10:20,175
Captain, you're out
of limits.

250
00:10:20,243 --> 00:10:22,945
Descending to 500 feet.

251
00:10:28,384 --> 00:10:29,416
Stay with me, Henry.

252
00:10:29,484 --> 00:10:30,518
You can do it.

253
00:10:30,585 --> 00:10:32,120
We're almost there.

254
00:10:32,187 --> 00:10:33,354
200 feet.

255
00:10:33,421 --> 00:10:35,422
Ah, is that the runway?

256
00:10:37,893 --> 00:10:39,727
Oh, the son of a bitch
snuck up on us.

257
00:10:39,795 --> 00:10:40,862
We're coming in too fast.

258
00:10:40,929 --> 00:10:42,396
Runway in sight. Full flaps.

259
00:10:42,464 --> 00:10:44,032
- Confirm runway in sight.
- Full flaps.

260
00:10:48,469 --> 00:10:50,070
Aircraft at 40 feet.

261
00:10:54,275 --> 00:10:55,408
20 feet.

262
00:10:55,476 --> 00:10:57,177
10 feet.

263
00:11:29,341 --> 00:11:30,274
Okay.

264
00:11:30,342 --> 00:11:31,943
Ohh.

265
00:12:00,991 --> 00:12:03,325
I've seen friendlier-looking
ground crews.

266
00:12:03,393 --> 00:12:05,862
What if they try to board
the plane?

267
00:12:07,731 --> 00:12:09,832
Well, then I'll take
the one on the right.

268
00:12:16,505 --> 00:12:18,674
Do you want some water,
Henry?

269
00:12:18,741 --> 00:12:20,508
Henry? Water?

270
00:12:20,577 --> 00:12:22,243
No.

271
00:12:25,381 --> 00:12:28,015
There's nothing to see.
Just relax.

272
00:12:28,084 --> 00:12:30,618
We'll be taking off soon.

273
00:12:39,027 --> 00:12:40,527
Where's the doctor?

274
00:12:40,596 --> 00:12:43,030
<i>Docteur?</i>
<i>Les lignes sont coupees.</i>

275
00:12:43,098 --> 00:12:45,132
<i>Il n'y a plus d'electricite</i>
<i>sur l'ile.</i>

276
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,034
What's he saying?

277
00:12:47,102 --> 00:12:49,036
There's no phone, no doctor.

278
00:12:49,104 --> 00:12:51,706
<i>Nous avons un homme tres malade</i>
<i>a bord. Ou trouver un docteur?</i>

279
00:12:51,773 --> 00:12:54,741
<i>Petionville est le village</i>
<i>le plus pres avec un docteur,</i>

280
00:12:54,809 --> 00:12:56,676
<i>mais les routes</i>
<i>sont trop dangereuses.</i>

281
00:12:56,744 --> 00:12:57,944
<i>C'est une tuerie.</i>

282
00:12:58,012 --> 00:12:59,879
There's a village not too far
with a doctor.

283
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:01,047
We can bring Mr. Belson there.

284
00:13:01,115 --> 00:13:02,983
I don't think
he can travel.

285
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:04,985
We'll have to bring
the doctor to him. I'll go.

286
00:13:05,052 --> 00:13:07,286
No, no. A captain can't.
You must stay with your plane.

287
00:13:07,354 --> 00:13:08,822
Um, <i>j'ai besoin de votre</i> jeep.

288
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:12,825
No. No jeep. Killing.

289
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:17,730
Okay. Give me
all the money you have.

290
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:22,501
Did he just say "killing"?

291
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:24,937
One of
us is gonna have to go.

292
00:13:25,005 --> 00:13:27,505
It must be me. The doctor
might only speak French.

293
00:13:27,572 --> 00:13:29,907
I might need directions.

294
00:13:35,413 --> 00:13:36,580
No. No, no, no.

295
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,282
Colette, you don't have
to do this.

296
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:42,020
This is why we landed,
isn't it? Quickly.

297
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:43,586
All right. Ted, you drive.

298
00:13:43,655 --> 00:13:45,956
That's what you're worried
about, my driving?

299
00:13:46,024 --> 00:13:47,858
He's driven
in Haiti before.

300
00:13:47,925 --> 00:13:50,661
Been driven. In a taxi.

301
00:13:50,728 --> 00:13:53,864
Ted! You don't stop
for anything.

302
00:13:53,931 --> 00:13:57,467
Sound advice, captain.

303
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:27,461
I used to like coming
to Haiti. Loved lake Sumatra.

304
00:14:27,529 --> 00:14:29,931
See the flamingos
and the man-eating crocodiles,

305
00:14:29,999 --> 00:14:31,665
but I tell you,
you put one lunatic in charge,

306
00:14:31,733 --> 00:14:33,500
and the whole country turns
into crazyland.

307
00:14:33,568 --> 00:14:35,335
Instead of leaving,
the American military

308
00:14:35,403 --> 00:14:38,005
should have crushed Papa Doc
and his merry men

309
00:14:38,073 --> 00:14:39,339
and taken over.

310
00:14:39,407 --> 00:14:41,008
Mm. The whole country would
be better off.

311
00:14:41,076 --> 00:14:42,843
We'd be feeding flamingos
right now.

312
00:14:42,911 --> 00:14:44,178
Uh, I mean,
that probably sounds

313
00:14:44,245 --> 00:14:46,180
a little imperialistic
to the French, right?

314
00:14:46,247 --> 00:14:48,681
Am I right?

315
00:14:48,749 --> 00:14:50,850
Do you always talk
this much?

316
00:14:50,918 --> 00:14:53,786
Yeah, when I'm nervous.
A bit.

317
00:14:53,854 --> 00:14:56,189
You always talk
this little?

318
00:14:56,256 --> 00:14:57,323
What's that?

319
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:58,324
What?

320
00:14:58,391 --> 00:14:59,625
It looks familiar.

321
00:14:59,693 --> 00:15:00,827
Well, uh, a hurricane
just hit.

322
00:15:00,894 --> 00:15:02,861
I'm sure there's more
than one downed tree.

323
00:15:02,929 --> 00:15:04,295
No, we <i>are</i> going circles.

324
00:15:04,363 --> 00:15:07,799
Not according to the North star,
which is directly behind us.

325
00:15:07,867 --> 00:15:09,534
I used to be a navigator,
you know?

326
00:15:12,438 --> 00:15:14,439
Flamingos bite. They do.

327
00:15:14,506 --> 00:15:16,374
I-I mean, they... they're...
They're very pretty

328
00:15:16,442 --> 00:15:18,143
a-and... and pink
and very quiet,

329
00:15:18,211 --> 00:15:19,810
but they bite.
They break the flesh.

330
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:21,145
You know, as a child,
when there was danger,

331
00:15:21,213 --> 00:15:24,615
I was taught not to speak,
not to make a sound.

332
00:15:24,682 --> 00:15:26,617
Really? Why?

333
00:15:26,684 --> 00:15:27,618
Ted. Just...

334
00:15:27,685 --> 00:15:29,553
Whoa.

335
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:36,425
Are they dead?

336
00:15:36,493 --> 00:15:41,030
There's nothing we can do
for them. Just keep driving.

337
00:15:45,136 --> 00:15:46,136
Wait!

338
00:15:46,203 --> 00:15:48,772
<i>Americains?</i>

339
00:16:02,185 --> 00:16:05,287
What did she say,
and why is she getting in?

340
00:16:05,354 --> 00:16:09,290
She will show us the way.

341
00:16:20,035 --> 00:16:21,903
Lucille Ball?

342
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:23,069
Oh.

343
00:16:23,137 --> 00:16:26,006
I thought you were gonna
say... Rita Hayworth.

344
00:16:26,073 --> 00:16:27,808
Oh, well, I like funny.

345
00:16:29,043 --> 00:16:30,844
But with nice legs.

346
00:16:30,912 --> 00:16:33,479
I bet you had your choice.

347
00:16:33,547 --> 00:16:36,649
Oh, but there's always
that one, right?

348
00:16:36,717 --> 00:16:39,919
That one you let in all the way
ends up breaking your heart.

349
00:16:39,986 --> 00:16:41,887
Well, she didn't mean to.

350
00:16:43,223 --> 00:16:45,490
Yeah, she fought hard,

351
00:16:45,558 --> 00:16:48,160
but the cancer won,

352
00:16:48,228 --> 00:16:50,329
and she left.

353
00:16:50,396 --> 00:16:53,199
Blanca... my redhead.

354
00:16:53,266 --> 00:16:55,800
The redhead who broke
your heart was your wife?

355
00:16:55,868 --> 00:16:59,003
Married 40 years.

356
00:16:59,071 --> 00:17:02,440
Going to Venezuela
to celebrate.

357
00:17:02,507 --> 00:17:04,542
That's where she was born.

358
00:17:06,678 --> 00:17:10,781
We always meant to go
together one day,

359
00:17:10,849 --> 00:17:13,783
but, you know, things...

360
00:17:13,852 --> 00:17:16,053
Things.

361
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,654
Blanca?

362
00:17:17,722 --> 00:17:19,289
Yeah.

363
00:17:19,357 --> 00:17:22,192
It's a funny name for a redhead,
isn't it?

364
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,194
Oh, it's beautiful.

365
00:17:24,262 --> 00:17:26,029
Oh.

366
00:17:26,097 --> 00:17:27,864
It was not just
on the outside.

367
00:17:27,931 --> 00:17:31,800
You know, she, uh, cared
about people.

368
00:17:31,869 --> 00:17:34,837
She was always volunteering
for things. Too much, I thought.

369
00:17:34,905 --> 00:17:37,907
I-I wanted her with me,
you know? Selfish.

370
00:17:37,975 --> 00:17:38,908
Mm-hmm.

371
00:17:38,976 --> 00:17:40,776
Very selfish.

372
00:17:40,844 --> 00:17:44,546
I'm gonna make up for that
when I get back...

373
00:17:44,614 --> 00:17:49,084
Try to be more like her,

374
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:52,921
make some kind of...
impact.

375
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:57,493
Mm. I've been trying
to make an impact myself.

376
00:17:58,461 --> 00:18:00,227
Keep trying.

377
00:18:06,435 --> 00:18:10,070
She says the killings have
been going on for weeks now.

378
00:18:10,138 --> 00:18:12,940
The secret police suspect
everyone to be a rebel.

379
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,375
The rebels
suspect everyone

380
00:18:14,443 --> 00:18:15,909
of working
for the dictator Papa Doc.

381
00:18:15,976 --> 00:18:18,244
And here we are, two foreigners
in a government vehicle. Swell.

382
00:18:18,312 --> 00:18:20,346
Perhaps they'll be too busy
shooting at each other

383
00:18:20,415 --> 00:18:21,548
to bother with us.

384
00:18:21,616 --> 00:18:23,583
What about
our planeload of passengers?

385
00:18:28,055 --> 00:18:30,089
Doctor?

386
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:36,529
Does it look like I can go anywhere?

387
00:18:36,596 --> 00:18:39,097
It's just a few miles.
We'll bring you right back.

388
00:18:39,165 --> 00:18:41,567
And how many die here
before I get back?

389
00:18:41,635 --> 00:18:43,687
We got money. Back at the plane.

390
00:18:43,688 --> 00:18:45,738
Enough to save a lot of lives.

391
00:18:47,307 --> 00:18:49,100
What makes your passenger

392
00:18:49,101 --> 00:18:51,609
more important
than these people?

393
00:19:34,418 --> 00:19:36,318
Nitroglycerin.

394
00:19:36,386 --> 00:19:40,356
Put it under his tongue. It can
sometimes stop the attack.

395
00:19:40,423 --> 00:19:42,424
Now go before
anyone sees you here.

396
00:19:42,492 --> 00:19:44,994
<i>Merci.</i>

397
00:19:50,266 --> 00:19:52,800
No, no, no, no. Ride's over.
Tell her to get out.

398
00:19:52,868 --> 00:19:53,801
No. I can't.

399
00:19:53,869 --> 00:19:54,969
Why?

400
00:19:55,037 --> 00:19:56,204
I already told her
she could come with us.

401
00:19:56,271 --> 00:19:59,707
No. No way. Not unless
she's got a medical degree.

402
00:19:59,774 --> 00:20:01,642
Her entire family
was butchered.

403
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:04,778
Ted!

404
00:20:04,846 --> 00:20:06,847
Those gunshots
are coming from the North.

405
00:20:06,915 --> 00:20:08,148
- We have to go North.
- Lay down.

406
00:20:08,216 --> 00:20:10,450
Get back. Don't get up,
no matter what. You, too.

407
00:20:10,518 --> 00:20:13,453
We might be... we might be driving
right through the middle of it.

408
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,425
Stay down!

409
00:20:27,167 --> 00:20:30,869
You're counting.
Why are you counting?

410
00:20:35,175 --> 00:20:38,310
The runway...
It's too short?

411
00:20:38,378 --> 00:20:40,946
That stays out here.

412
00:20:41,014 --> 00:20:42,714
How could it be too short?

413
00:20:42,782 --> 00:20:45,584
Pan Am used to land here
all the time.

414
00:20:52,692 --> 00:20:55,928
Hurricane left some scars.

415
00:20:55,995 --> 00:20:58,395
How much is gone?

416
00:20:58,463 --> 00:21:00,898
Too much for a loaded 707.

417
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,635
So we can't take off?

418
00:21:26,315 --> 00:21:28,849
Maybe the cavalry's
on their way.

419
00:21:31,085 --> 00:21:33,253
Oh, if they're the cavalry,
we're the Indians.

420
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:37,558
How short is it?

421
00:21:37,626 --> 00:21:40,294
About 500 feet
shy of liftoff.

422
00:21:40,361 --> 00:21:42,629
So we're grounded.

423
00:21:42,696 --> 00:21:44,664
You think "grounded's"
a viable option?

424
00:21:44,732 --> 00:21:46,966
According to that manual,
it's the only option.

425
00:21:47,034 --> 00:21:50,603
These manuals are written
by engineers, not pilots.

426
00:21:50,671 --> 00:21:53,272
These planes will do a lot more
than they say they can.

427
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,041
They build in a pad
for a reason.

428
00:21:55,108 --> 00:21:57,477
Well, we can't afford
that reason.

429
00:21:59,078 --> 00:22:00,312
What's the outside
temperature?

430
00:22:00,379 --> 00:22:02,247
78 degrees.

431
00:22:06,152 --> 00:22:07,653
Gotta love the tropics.

432
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,521
But the wind speed
is 12 knots at our tail,

433
00:22:09,589 --> 00:22:11,857
which negates
the temperature advantage.

434
00:22:11,925 --> 00:22:14,559
I m... I mentioned
I was a pilot, right?

435
00:22:14,626 --> 00:22:16,527
Current fuel level and cargo,

436
00:22:16,595 --> 00:22:19,864
we weigh in
at 237,000 pounds.

437
00:22:22,935 --> 00:22:26,036
Gonna have to
lose some weight.

438
00:22:26,104 --> 00:22:31,307
Starting in 6A...
185, 140, 133.

439
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:32,342
Why are you asking
our weights?

440
00:22:32,409 --> 00:22:33,944
The plane is too heavy
to take off.

441
00:22:34,011 --> 00:22:35,879
I just saw the pilot
measuring the runway.

442
00:22:35,947 --> 00:22:36,947
Now they're concerned
about weight?

443
00:22:37,014 --> 00:22:38,982
How long have you
been flying 707s?

444
00:22:39,049 --> 00:22:40,584
How long has your captain?

445
00:22:40,651 --> 00:22:42,586
He looks like he just
got out of the service.

446
00:22:42,653 --> 00:22:44,087
He does look very young.

447
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:46,789
Youngest captain
at Pan Am.

448
00:22:46,857 --> 00:22:49,224
Well, he is.

449
00:22:49,292 --> 00:22:51,460
So ask yourselves,
why would Pan Am,

450
00:22:51,528 --> 00:22:54,463
the best airline in the world,
promote someone so young?

451
00:22:54,531 --> 00:22:55,998
Well, looking around,
I can only assume

452
00:22:56,065 --> 00:22:58,467
it's because
he looks good in his uniform.

453
00:23:11,981 --> 00:23:14,148
May we help you?

454
00:23:14,216 --> 00:23:16,618
<i>Avez-vous</i>
<i>de la nourriture?</i>

455
00:23:16,685 --> 00:23:19,285
<i>N'avons pas mange</i>
<i>depuis deux jours.</i>

456
00:23:19,353 --> 00:23:20,621
<i>Bien sur.</i>

457
00:23:20,688 --> 00:23:22,956
They're just hungry.
They want some food.

458
00:23:37,638 --> 00:23:42,274
How did Hemingway
describe fear, Mr. Ortiz?

459
00:23:42,342 --> 00:23:44,777
Was it
"Grace under pressure"?

460
00:23:44,845 --> 00:23:48,514
Oh, no. I'm sorry.
That's how he described courage.

461
00:23:48,582 --> 00:23:52,384
So while she takes care
of the men with the guns,

462
00:23:52,452 --> 00:23:55,754
why don't you sit down...

463
00:23:55,821 --> 00:23:59,824
and I'll make you
a nice, hot cup of tea.

464
00:24:02,929 --> 00:24:06,665
- Where are they?
- I don't know.

465
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,702
Henry? You awake?

466
00:24:15,807 --> 00:24:18,008
Oh.

467
00:24:18,077 --> 00:24:21,546
Still here.

468
00:24:21,613 --> 00:24:23,213
What, uh...

469
00:24:23,281 --> 00:24:26,450
What part of Venezuela
is Blanca from?

470
00:24:26,517 --> 00:24:27,884
Oh...

471
00:24:27,952 --> 00:24:29,519
Chuao.

472
00:24:30,588 --> 00:24:32,655
Very small.

473
00:24:32,723 --> 00:24:35,492
By the water.

474
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:41,597
She said e-everybody there
just wanted to feed you.

475
00:24:41,664 --> 00:24:45,000
I've been to Venezuela
several times, but never there.

476
00:24:45,068 --> 00:24:47,903
I'd love to see it
with you, Henry.

477
00:24:47,971 --> 00:24:50,139
You may have to carry me.

478
00:24:50,207 --> 00:24:52,808
Oh, come on. We'll celebrate
your anniversary together.

479
00:24:52,875 --> 00:24:55,977
We'll dance the <i>joropo.</i>

480
00:24:58,814 --> 00:25:01,316
Well, you're...

481
00:25:01,383 --> 00:25:07,088
You're very lucky to...
Have gone to so many places.

482
00:25:08,857 --> 00:25:11,691
35 countries and counting.

483
00:25:13,928 --> 00:25:15,795
Best part of my job.

484
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:21,368
Which was your favorite?

485
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:27,240
Croatia.

486
00:25:28,308 --> 00:25:30,343
Ahh.

487
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:32,678
Yugoslavia.

488
00:25:34,381 --> 00:25:36,949
It was just supposed
to be a short layover.

489
00:25:37,017 --> 00:25:40,119
It was part of my job. I didn't
even want to go there, but...

490
00:25:40,187 --> 00:25:43,321
From the moment I arrived...

491
00:25:43,389 --> 00:25:45,723
I felt like I was home.

492
00:25:45,791 --> 00:25:47,959
Was it...

493
00:25:48,027 --> 00:25:50,094
Was it beautiful?

494
00:25:51,464 --> 00:25:56,568
It was gorgeous.

495
00:25:56,636 --> 00:26:00,771
Strong, safe...

496
00:26:00,838 --> 00:26:05,142
With this romantic side
that surprised me...

497
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:08,979
Devastated me.

498
00:26:09,047 --> 00:26:11,482
Who was he?

499
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:17,387
He was my redhead.

500
00:26:26,029 --> 00:26:27,564
Henry?

501
00:26:28,999 --> 00:26:30,500
Henry?

502
00:26:33,369 --> 00:26:34,836
Henry?

503
00:26:45,248 --> 00:26:48,316
Okay, ladies. Let's go.

504
00:27:00,896 --> 00:27:02,363
Where's the doctor?

505
00:27:02,431 --> 00:27:03,531
You're looking at 'em.

506
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:05,398
- He's not coming?
- He sent medicine.

507
00:27:35,696 --> 00:27:37,162
Dean.

508
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:39,231
No. Absolutely not.

509
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:42,268
Dean, we can't.
We can't leave her here.

510
00:27:42,335 --> 00:27:44,536
She barely escaped
with her life.

511
00:27:44,604 --> 00:27:46,805
And I'm sympathetic to that,
Colette, I am,

512
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:48,407
but taking her
is not an option.

513
00:27:48,475 --> 00:27:51,343
Are you hearing me?
She could be killed.

514
00:27:51,411 --> 00:27:52,810
Yeah, along with
a thousand other villagers.

515
00:27:52,878 --> 00:27:54,879
So let's go out...
we'll round them up,

516
00:27:54,946 --> 00:27:57,482
we'll lock the doors, and wait
for someone to take us hostage.

517
00:27:57,549 --> 00:27:59,249
I'm not asking
for thousands of villagers.

518
00:27:59,317 --> 00:28:02,185
I'm asking for <i>one girl.</i>

519
00:28:02,253 --> 00:28:05,155
And I'm asking you
to put yourself in my shoes.

520
00:28:05,222 --> 00:28:07,524
I just landed a plane
full of passengers

521
00:28:07,592 --> 00:28:10,394
who are my responsibility
on a runway that is too short

522
00:28:10,461 --> 00:28:12,362
in a country
that's about to explode.

523
00:28:13,598 --> 00:28:15,531
And between you and me?

524
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:17,032
The only way
that we are taking off

525
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,668
is if we lose
a few thousand pounds

526
00:28:18,735 --> 00:28:20,235
and there's a passenger
on this plane

527
00:28:20,304 --> 00:28:23,038
that's got a guardian angel that
feels like doing extra credit.

528
00:28:23,106 --> 00:28:25,207
She doesn't weigh much.

529
00:28:25,275 --> 00:28:26,442
Oh, damn it, Colette.

530
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:29,345
I don't have the time,
the space, or the luxury

531
00:28:29,413 --> 00:28:31,379
to take on strays right now.

532
00:28:31,447 --> 00:28:32,747
"Strays"?

533
00:28:32,815 --> 00:28:34,516
That's how you see orphans?

534
00:28:34,583 --> 00:28:37,419
Oh, don't do that.
Don't make this about you.

535
00:28:37,486 --> 00:28:40,588
How is she...
what is she? She 17?

536
00:28:40,656 --> 00:28:43,024
I didn't realize
there was an expiration date.

537
00:28:43,091 --> 00:28:44,459
Even if we take her,

538
00:28:44,527 --> 00:28:47,194
immigration will immediately
kick her right back.

539
00:28:47,261 --> 00:28:49,296
We have to try.

540
00:28:50,532 --> 00:28:53,233
Pan Am has...
has strict guidelines

541
00:28:53,301 --> 00:28:56,704
against bringing
stowaways on board.

542
00:28:56,771 --> 00:28:59,606
I'm the captain
of this aircraft.

543
00:29:01,776 --> 00:29:03,409
I believe in you,

544
00:29:03,477 --> 00:29:07,113
I believe
this plane will take off,

545
00:29:07,181 --> 00:29:10,650
and I believe that
once we're safely in the air,

546
00:29:10,718 --> 00:29:15,488
you will regret
leaving that girl behind.

547
00:29:19,525 --> 00:29:22,361
I landed here for nothing,

548
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:25,797
put all these people's lives
in danger for a dead man.

549
00:29:28,101 --> 00:29:31,837
You landed here
to save a life.

550
00:29:33,139 --> 00:29:35,340
There is still
the possibility of that.

551
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,911
She's standing right there.

552
00:29:57,746 --> 00:30:00,580
- The man is dead.
- Why are we still here?

553
00:30:00,648 --> 00:30:02,716
We'll be leaving
very soon.

554
00:30:02,784 --> 00:30:05,719
What are we doing now?
Refugees?

555
00:30:05,787 --> 00:30:08,255
She doesn't belong
on this plane.

556
00:30:11,691 --> 00:30:13,926
She's seen much worse.

557
00:30:15,229 --> 00:30:17,663
Is she coming with us?

558
00:30:17,731 --> 00:30:20,599
She lost all her family.

559
00:30:20,667 --> 00:30:23,402
Nothing's left for her here.

560
00:30:29,475 --> 00:30:33,245
Here. You may need this.
It gets cold up there.

561
00:30:42,695 --> 00:30:43,815
What is with this guy?

562
00:30:43,822 --> 00:30:46,791
You don't suppose he could be
delivering good news, do you?

563
00:30:46,858 --> 00:30:48,625
The good humor man's
coming?

564
00:30:51,596 --> 00:30:53,931
- Or the rebels.
- Any one of 'em would love

565
00:30:53,999 --> 00:30:57,001
a planeload of American hostages
to parade around like poodles.

566
00:30:57,068 --> 00:30:59,282
So that hurricane should
have cleared Miami by now.

567
00:30:59,283 --> 00:30:59,836
Yeah?

568
00:30:59,904 --> 00:31:03,572
It's closer. We can lighten
the load by burning more fuel.

569
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,141
We're diverting.

570
00:31:05,209 --> 00:31:06,542
How overweight are we?

571
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:08,644
You know how ostriches
are birds but they can't fly?

572
00:31:08,712 --> 00:31:09,913
Well, this one's going to.

573
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:11,647
I want you to start
the before start checklist,

574
00:31:11,715 --> 00:31:13,183
then start the engines.

575
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:15,684
Copy that.

576
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,321
Why is she being given
a seat?

577
00:31:19,388 --> 00:31:20,555
Well, she's the only
Haitian passenger

578
00:31:20,623 --> 00:31:21,857
that was brave enough
to show up.

579
00:31:21,925 --> 00:31:23,425
First you land us
in this hellhole

580
00:31:23,492 --> 00:31:25,760
just to watch a man die, and now
you want to smuggle refugees?

581
00:31:25,829 --> 00:31:27,629
We choose who flies
on this aircraft.

582
00:31:27,697 --> 00:31:28,659
What if <i>you</i> were sick?

583
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,364
Wouldn't you want
us to land for you?

584
00:31:30,432 --> 00:31:32,566
I don't deal with conjecture.
I deal in facts.

585
00:31:32,634 --> 00:31:34,702
And the fact is
she is a stowaway.

586
00:31:34,769 --> 00:31:36,570
She is a guest of Pan Am.

587
00:31:36,638 --> 00:31:38,005
And you are
an ignorant young girl.

588
00:31:38,073 --> 00:31:39,874
Go back to your seat
and shut up.

589
00:31:39,942 --> 00:31:41,475
Who is
the paying passenger here?

590
00:31:41,543 --> 00:31:43,845
If you promise to go mute
for the rest of this trip,

591
00:31:43,912 --> 00:31:45,979
I will see about
getting you a refund.

592
00:31:46,047 --> 00:31:48,215
<i>Okay, everybody calm down.</i>

593
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:52,585
<i>You hear that?
So those are our engines.</i>

594
00:31:52,653 --> 00:31:54,855
<i>We're burning off some fuel
so we can lighten our load,</i>

595
00:31:54,922 --> 00:31:55,989
<i>and then we'll be leaving.</i>

596
00:31:56,057 --> 00:31:58,325
Oh!

597
00:32:01,229 --> 00:32:03,329
<i>But I need everybody's help.</i>

598
00:32:03,396 --> 00:32:05,564
Do you want us
to get out and push?

599
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:09,068
<i>I may take you up on that,
but right now</i>

600
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:11,971
<i>I'm gonna need all your personal
items removed from the plane.</i>

601
00:32:12,038 --> 00:32:15,674
<i>That includes your luggage.
Every pound counts.</i>

602
00:32:19,644 --> 00:32:22,646
We burn 50 pounds in minute
with all 4 engines running.

603
00:32:22,714 --> 00:32:25,149
Yeah, we need a lot more minutes
and we don't have 'em.

604
00:32:25,217 --> 00:32:26,751
You want me to change
the laws of physics?

605
00:32:28,053 --> 00:32:31,089
Oh! Hey! Stop!
Don't take another step.

606
00:32:31,156 --> 00:32:33,091
I paid to have my luggage
arrive with me in Venezuela,

607
00:32:33,158 --> 00:32:34,858
and that's where it's going.

608
00:32:34,926 --> 00:32:37,928
Let me help you
with that.

609
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:41,765
You <i>idiot.</i>

610
00:32:41,832 --> 00:32:44,634
Ah... ah... hey.
You touch that suitcase,

611
00:32:44,702 --> 00:32:46,103
you're gonna be
keeping it company on the tarmac

612
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:47,704
when we take off.

613
00:32:47,772 --> 00:32:49,606
You and Papa Doc
can have a party without us.

614
00:32:49,673 --> 00:32:52,141
When I report this, you'll be
lucky to fly crop dusters.

615
00:32:52,209 --> 00:32:55,077
Nothing wrong with crop dusters.
That's how I learned to fly.

616
00:32:55,145 --> 00:32:57,146
Go.

617
00:33:00,717 --> 00:33:03,786
Thank you
for flying Pan Am.

618
00:33:20,968 --> 00:33:22,902
<i>If this plane
is too heavy for luggage,</i>

619
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:23,935
<i>it is too heavy
for that Haitian.</i>

620
00:33:24,003 --> 00:33:24,970
<i>He's right.</i>

621
00:33:25,037 --> 00:33:26,671
<i>This isn't luggage.</i>

622
00:33:26,739 --> 00:33:29,407
<i>She's a person
who needs our help.</i>

623
00:33:30,777 --> 00:33:32,645
This redhead needs a favor.

624
00:33:32,756 --> 00:33:35,057
<i>We need to leave her here.</i>

625
00:33:35,125 --> 00:33:37,059
<i>If she stays here,
she'll be killed.</i>

626
00:33:37,127 --> 00:33:39,628
We might die
if she doesn't.

627
00:33:39,695 --> 00:33:43,164
If the girl stays,
somebody goes.

628
00:33:43,232 --> 00:33:45,399
Are you volunteering?

629
00:33:45,467 --> 00:33:46,900
<i>No.</i>

630
00:33:46,968 --> 00:33:48,569
Henry is.

631
00:33:48,637 --> 00:33:52,139
He wanted to help people.
Tonight he gets to do that.

632
00:33:52,206 --> 00:33:55,609
We leave the body,
and the girl stays.

633
00:34:04,687 --> 00:34:07,189
You made that impact, Henry.

634
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:10,373
Safe travels.

635
00:34:12,942 --> 00:34:14,775
That can't be good.

636
00:34:14,843 --> 00:34:16,176
Ready or not,
we're leaving right now.

637
00:34:16,244 --> 00:34:17,611
I'll start preflight.

638
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:21,749
- Kate! Let's go!
- Prepare for takeoff!

639
00:34:24,149 --> 00:34:25,569
Come on. Let's go.

640
00:34:26,855 --> 00:34:29,484
The wind has increased on our tail
and the temperature has dropped.

641
00:34:29,485 --> 00:34:30,189
We can't take off.

642
00:34:30,257 --> 00:34:32,959
Cut the pep talk, Chuck.

643
00:34:35,195 --> 00:34:36,463
Where's our fuel?

644
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:37,897
We've lost 6,000 pounds.

645
00:34:37,965 --> 00:34:39,365
Add that
to our garage sale,

646
00:34:39,433 --> 00:34:41,267
and we're down
to about 200,000 pounds.

647
00:34:41,335 --> 00:34:42,969
Still not enough
to fit into our prom dress.

648
00:34:43,036 --> 00:34:44,771
We need to burn more fuel,
a lot more.

649
00:34:44,839 --> 00:34:46,237
Well, there's no time.
Setting brakes.

650
00:34:47,707 --> 00:34:50,075
Setting takeoff thrust.

651
00:34:50,142 --> 00:34:52,277
Takeoff thrust set.

652
00:34:52,345 --> 00:34:53,645
Captain,
it's my duty to tell you

653
00:34:53,713 --> 00:34:55,113
that based on F.A.A.
rules and regulations,

654
00:34:55,181 --> 00:34:56,648
it is too dangerous
to take off.

655
00:34:56,716 --> 00:34:58,083
Yeah, noted.

656
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:59,685
We've taken off from aircraft
carriers shorter than this.

657
00:34:59,752 --> 00:35:02,820
In a fighter jet. A 707 isn't
designed to take off like this.

658
00:35:02,888 --> 00:35:04,355
'Cause fighter jets
don't veve four engines.

659
00:35:04,422 --> 00:35:05,790
If you don't
blow an engine first.

660
00:35:05,858 --> 00:35:07,358
You need me to change
your diaper, Chuck?

661
00:35:07,425 --> 00:35:08,793
I mean, you're embarrassing
the Navy here.

662
00:35:08,861 --> 00:35:10,060
Ted, I'm just
trying to tell you...

663
00:35:10,128 --> 00:35:11,863
It's not Ted,
it's first officer Vanderway,

664
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:12,930
and sitting next to me
is captain Lowrey.

665
00:35:12,998 --> 00:35:14,398
He makes the decisions
on this aircraft

666
00:35:14,466 --> 00:35:16,834
without <i>any</i> interference
from you. Am I understood?

667
00:35:16,902 --> 00:35:18,468
Yes, sir.

668
00:35:21,205 --> 00:35:23,139
Seats in
the upright position.

669
00:35:23,207 --> 00:35:25,976
Make sure your belts
are nice and tight.

670
00:35:29,914 --> 00:35:31,515
Flaps at 20.

671
00:35:31,582 --> 00:35:32,582
Flaps 20.

672
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:35,618
Engine 2, oil pressure 80.
Engine 3, 82.

673
00:35:35,685 --> 00:35:38,487
- We can't sustain this thrust forever.
- Just another minute.

674
00:35:38,555 --> 00:35:39,855
Smell that?
That's the brakes burning up.

675
00:35:39,923 --> 00:35:42,758
I can fly without brakes.
Just a little while longer.

676
00:35:42,826 --> 00:35:44,326
Another 30 seconds,
they're gonna be on our tail.

677
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:49,231
Thank you for Henry.

678
00:35:49,298 --> 00:35:51,265
I hope immigration
doesn't send her back.

679
00:35:52,668 --> 00:35:54,368
<i>Cabin crew,</i>
<i>prepare for immediate takeoff.</i>

680
00:35:55,604 --> 00:35:58,640
I may have a friend
who can help.

681
00:35:58,707 --> 00:36:00,207
It's now or never.
Do it.

682
00:36:02,845 --> 00:36:04,045
Releasing brakes.

683
00:36:12,286 --> 00:36:13,787
Pull up. Pull up!

684
00:36:13,855 --> 00:36:16,023
I see it.

685
00:36:21,062 --> 00:36:22,595
Oh...

686
00:36:22,663 --> 00:36:24,196
Damaged runway cleared.

687
00:36:24,264 --> 00:36:25,831
- Take gear up.
- Oh, way ahead of you.

688
00:36:25,899 --> 00:36:27,366
Flaps up.

689
00:36:27,434 --> 00:36:28,534
Flaps...

690
00:36:28,602 --> 00:36:30,803
Up.

691
00:36:39,244 --> 00:36:40,612
Nice job, captain.

692
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,146
You may
have to land again.

693
00:36:42,214 --> 00:36:43,481
I think I'm having
a heart attack.

694
00:36:45,384 --> 00:36:47,986
Your controls.

695
00:36:52,324 --> 00:36:53,891
Ladies and gentlemen,

696
00:36:53,959 --> 00:36:56,827
that was rougher than expected...
My apologies...

697
00:36:56,895 --> 00:36:58,328
<i>But we are climbing normally.</i>

698
00:36:58,396 --> 00:37:00,497
<i>We should be reaching</i>
<i>cruising altitude shortly.</i>

699
00:37:00,565 --> 00:37:02,733
- Yay!
- Whoo!

700
00:37:11,141 --> 00:37:14,176
Don't worry. 
Kate is going to help you.

701
00:37:16,279 --> 00:37:17,379
Miss Benoit?

702
00:37:17,447 --> 00:37:19,415
Please give us
a few more minutes. Please.

703
00:37:19,483 --> 00:37:21,084
I need you to do this,
Richard.

704
00:37:21,151 --> 00:37:24,087
I can always count on
you for the unorthodox.

705
00:37:24,154 --> 00:37:25,287
Can you do it or not?

706
00:37:25,355 --> 00:37:28,023
We do have some experience
with green cards.

707
00:37:28,091 --> 00:37:29,858
Please, I understand,

708
00:37:29,926 --> 00:37:32,594
but we might
be able to fix this.

709
00:37:32,662 --> 00:37:34,730
I'm in no mood
for one of your little games.

710
00:37:34,797 --> 00:37:35,864
Just do it.

711
00:37:35,932 --> 00:37:37,866
Give me a couple of hours.

712
00:37:37,934 --> 00:37:39,768
No. Not hours. <i>Minutes.</i>

713
00:37:39,836 --> 00:37:42,903
I guess I will have to
go over a few heads.

714
00:37:42,971 --> 00:37:44,404
And a faster family.

715
00:37:44,472 --> 00:37:45,706
A nice one.

716
00:37:45,774 --> 00:37:47,141
She can't be here alone.

717
00:37:47,208 --> 00:37:49,610
I will interrogate them
myself.

718
00:37:49,678 --> 00:37:51,478
Thank you, Richard.

719
00:37:51,546 --> 00:37:53,213
I owed you one...

720
00:37:53,281 --> 00:37:55,183
Or several.

721
00:37:55,282 --> 00:37:56,682
Yes, good bye.

722
00:38:12,366 --> 00:38:14,900
You land
in a hostile country,

723
00:38:14,968 --> 00:38:18,436
you leave the dead body
of a Pan Am passenger,

724
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:22,507
and you come back
with a 17-year-old refugee.

725
00:38:22,575 --> 00:38:23,909
Which one of you
is responsible

726
00:38:23,977 --> 00:38:27,212
for bringing a stowaway
on board a Pan Am aircraft?

727
00:38:28,481 --> 00:38:30,014
Miss...

728
00:38:30,082 --> 00:38:31,348
Valois.

729
00:38:31,416 --> 00:38:33,785
Miss Valois, come with me.

730
00:38:33,852 --> 00:38:35,687
Colette, I can't let you take
the blame for this.

731
00:38:35,754 --> 00:38:36,921
I brought the girl on board.

732
00:38:36,989 --> 00:38:38,690
Is this true?

733
00:38:38,757 --> 00:38:41,059
They're both
covering for me.

734
00:38:41,126 --> 00:38:44,628
Ask anyone in our New York
office. I'm the troublemaker.

735
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:48,765
Maggie, you are such a liar.
It was my idea, and you know it.

736
00:38:48,833 --> 00:38:52,502
Laura, stop protecting me.
You know this was my idea.

737
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:55,772
They're all lying.
I already confessed.

738
00:38:56,841 --> 00:38:58,075
Okay.

739
00:38:58,142 --> 00:39:00,210
I think I get the picture.

740
00:39:00,277 --> 00:39:02,845
Thank you, ladies.

741
00:39:04,181 --> 00:39:07,549
There you are, girls.
Power in numbers.

742
00:39:07,617 --> 00:39:09,785
- Debriefing?
- I'm buying.

743
00:39:09,853 --> 00:39:12,387
So how long are we
stranded here for?

744
00:39:12,455 --> 00:39:15,257
Stranded?
Have you <i>been</i> to Palm Beach?

745
00:39:15,325 --> 00:39:17,693
Colette? 
Are you coming?

746
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,760
Right behind you.

747
00:39:18,861 --> 00:39:20,695
Okay.

748
00:39:20,763 --> 00:39:22,931
Just consider
yourself fortunate

749
00:39:22,998 --> 00:39:25,800
that Mr. Trippe seems
to hold you in such high regard,

750
00:39:25,868 --> 00:39:29,204
because if it was up to me,
you would be out of here.

751
00:39:30,439 --> 00:39:32,006
Quite an evening.

752
00:39:32,074 --> 00:39:34,542
Really?
Did I miss something?

753
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:37,411
Some bad weather.

754
