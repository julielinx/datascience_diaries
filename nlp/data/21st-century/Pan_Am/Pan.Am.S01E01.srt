1
00:00:36,997 --> 00:00:38,381
There you are.
Enjoy your flight.

2
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:55,281
"Jet clipper service is unique.

3
00:00:55,315 --> 00:00:56,782
"Upon boarding
an around-the-world flight,

4
00:00:56,817 --> 00:00:57,783
"passengers are greeted

5
00:00:57,818 --> 00:00:59,352
"by the international beauty
and grace

6
00:00:59,386 --> 00:01:00,903
known
as the Pan Am stewardess."

7
00:01:01,988 --> 00:01:02,988
"All college-educated,

8
00:01:03,022 --> 00:01:06,826

married or turn 32."

9
00:01:08,194 --> 00:01:10,796
Hands.

10
00:01:10,831 --> 00:01:12,665
Excuse me.
Can you help me?

11
00:01:12,699 --> 00:01:14,300
That's quite a picture.

12
00:01:14,334 --> 00:01:16,635
Thank you. Uh, I have a bit
of a problem, miss...

13
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:19,905
Over a million copies sold,
and your hat is askew.

14
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:22,591
Oh, I didn't pose for it.
I was only leaving the building.

15
00:01:22,642 --> 00:01:23,676
Are you wearing your girdle?

16
00:01:23,744 --> 00:01:24,643
Yes, ma'am.

17
00:01:25,645 --> 00:01:28,013
- Oh.  Uh...
- Is that...

18
00:01:28,047 --> 00:01:29,448
Is that necessary?

19
00:01:29,483 --> 00:01:32,284
A girdle doesn't stand up
and announce itself.

20
00:01:32,352 --> 00:01:34,019
There's a rip
in your stocking.

21
00:01:34,053 --> 00:01:35,654
Yes. I know.
Can you help me?

22
00:01:35,689 --> 00:01:37,656
My flight leaves
in less than an hour.

23
00:01:37,691 --> 00:01:39,057
How long
have you been flying?

24
00:01:39,076 --> 00:01:40,659
Three weeks and two days.

25
00:01:40,694 --> 00:01:42,128
I have an extra pair.

26
00:01:42,162 --> 00:01:44,780
We're on the same crew.
Follow me, <i>beaute.</i>

27
00:01:44,831 --> 00:01:48,117
Not too dark, miss Valois.
This isn't a cabaret.

28
00:01:48,168 --> 00:01:50,169
Yes, miss Havemeyer.

29
00:01:50,203 --> 00:01:51,370
Next.

30
00:01:51,405 --> 00:01:52,338
She likes the girdle.

31
00:01:54,007 --> 00:01:55,458
So... congratulations.

32
00:01:55,509 --> 00:01:57,242
When did they pick you
for it?

33
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,712
Just last week.
I was on the San Juan leg.

34
00:01:59,746 --> 00:02:02,798
No, no. Not the flight.
The magazine.

35
00:02:02,849 --> 00:02:04,100
How did it happen?

36
00:02:04,134 --> 00:02:06,385
I'm not sure exactly.
Um...

37
00:02:08,638 --> 00:02:10,723
Ah, <i>pas mal.</i> 
<i>Saviez-vous etudier a Paris?</i>

38
00:02:10,757 --> 00:02:12,775
<i>A l'universite de</i> Baltimore.

39
00:02:12,809 --> 00:02:14,994
Make way
for the face of Pan Am.

40
00:02:15,028 --> 00:02:16,445
No, don't.
Don't say that.

41
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,947
- Nylon emergency.
- Don't say that. I'm not.

42
00:02:17,981 --> 00:02:20,132
Don't apologize. You're on
the cover of "life" magazine.

43
00:02:20,167 --> 00:02:21,317
Yes,
with a face like that,

44
00:02:21,368 --> 00:02:23,269
you'll find a husband
in a couple of months.

45
00:02:23,303 --> 00:02:26,439
Oh, I'm... I'm not looking
for a husband.

46
00:02:26,473 --> 00:02:28,607
I hope not.
You're famous now.

47
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:32,077
No, trust her.
She's not.

48
00:02:32,112 --> 00:02:35,147
Looking for a husband, that is.

49
00:02:35,182 --> 00:02:38,751
Kate, I-I tried
to telephone last night.

50
00:02:38,785 --> 00:02:42,004
A man just took a picture.
I-I didn't ask for it.

51
00:02:42,055 --> 00:02:43,889
Of course you didn't.

52
00:02:43,924 --> 00:02:45,641
I need gum.
Does anyone want anything?

53
00:02:45,675 --> 00:02:46,592
Oh, hi, Kate.

54
00:02:46,626 --> 00:02:49,094
Can you chew gum
in uniform?

55
00:02:49,129 --> 00:02:52,031
Clipper 22 cabin crew.
<i>Oui?</i>

56
00:02:52,065 --> 00:02:55,351
Have any of you ladies s
your purser... Bridget Pierce?

57
00:02:55,402 --> 00:02:56,635
<i>The departure gate</i>

60
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:07,446
And the magazine?

61
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,681
Oh, no. I'm just looking.

62
00:03:08,715 --> 00:03:10,282
Are you sure? We'll sell out
in a couple hours.

63
00:03:10,317 --> 00:03:11,450
I'll take one.

64
00:03:11,484 --> 00:03:13,986
Here.  Take mine.

65
00:03:14,004 --> 00:03:15,621
Uh, a pack of Wilmingtons

66
00:03:15,655 --> 00:03:17,089
and the young lady's
chewing gum.

67
00:03:17,123 --> 00:03:18,657
68 cents.

68
00:03:18,692 --> 00:03:20,492
Keep the change.

69
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:21,877
Thank you.

70
00:03:21,928 --> 00:03:23,629
Pretty girl.

71
00:03:23,663 --> 00:03:25,364
Very.

72
00:03:29,219 --> 00:03:30,302
Are you ready
for your first assignment?

73
00:03:30,337 --> 00:03:31,270
Now?

74
00:03:31,304 --> 00:03:32,438
Seat 3D.

75
00:03:32,472 --> 00:03:35,274
We need to detain him
at customs in Heathrow.

76
00:03:35,308 --> 00:03:36,642
Replace the British visa
in his passport

77
00:03:36,676 --> 00:03:38,176
with this expired one.

78
00:03:38,195 --> 00:03:39,728
Without him knowing?

79
00:03:39,779 --> 00:03:41,647
I'll take that
as rhetorical.

80
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:43,549
- You forgot your gum.
- Oh.

81
00:03:54,527 --> 00:03:55,995
Sure. Let me get it.

82
00:03:56,029 --> 00:03:59,364
Oh. Does the marxist dialectic
account for a dual thesis?

83
00:03:59,382 --> 00:04:02,568
That's Hegel, not Marx.
Hello.

84
00:04:02,602 --> 00:04:05,471
Maggie? This is Bill
from Pan Am scheduling.

85
00:04:05,505 --> 00:04:07,940
Can you volunteer for
a special flight last-minute?

86
00:04:07,974 --> 00:04:11,594
I think you're working off
the wrong list.

87
00:04:11,645 --> 00:04:12,761
We're missing
our lead stewardess

88
00:04:12,812 --> 00:04:14,847
on our New York to London.

89
00:04:14,881 --> 00:04:15,948
Can you come and be
our purser?

90
00:04:15,982 --> 00:04:16,932
Today?

91
00:04:16,983 --> 00:04:17,900
8:30 departure.

92
00:04:17,934 --> 00:04:20,653
Margaret,
this is Paul Gilbert.

93
00:04:20,687 --> 00:04:22,087
Pan Am is launching a new clipper jet...

94
00:04:22,122 --> 00:04:24,490
And I cannot let it fly
without a purser.

95
00:04:24,524 --> 00:04:27,443
Did you know I was grounded,
Paul Gilbert?

96
00:04:27,494 --> 00:04:28,994
Uniform violation.

97
00:04:29,029 --> 00:04:31,229
Not if you can get here
in 35 minutes.

98
00:04:31,248 --> 00:04:32,932
I wish I could.
I'm in the city.

99
00:04:32,966 --> 00:04:34,266
Get your Fanny to midtown.

100
00:04:34,301 --> 00:04:36,435
I'll have a helicopter waiting
for you at headquarters,

101
00:04:36,469 --> 00:04:38,087
and, sweetheart,

102
00:04:38,121 --> 00:04:40,472
wear the girdle.

103
00:04:41,641 --> 00:04:42,625
Helicopter?

104
00:04:42,676 --> 00:04:44,343
An extraordinary gesture
on my part

105
00:04:44,377 --> 00:04:46,345
to get your purser here
on time.

106
00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:48,447
What,
Bridget's not here yet?

107
00:04:48,481 --> 00:04:49,882
Not your problem.

108
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:53,185
"Clipper Majestic"
departs on schedule.

109
00:04:53,219 --> 00:04:56,522
Write her first chapter,
captain.

110
00:04:56,556 --> 00:05:00,442
Yeah.

111
00:05:04,114 --> 00:05:05,331
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

112
00:05:05,365 --> 00:05:08,367
<i>This is the last boarding call</i>
<i>for flight 2701...</i>

113
00:05:08,401 --> 00:05:09,368
John?

114
00:05:09,402 --> 00:05:10,869
<i>To Sao Paulo, Brazil.</i>

115
00:05:10,904 --> 00:05:12,705
Hey, John!

116
00:05:17,043 --> 00:05:19,878
Hey, was that your...
The one from Rome?

117
00:05:19,913 --> 00:05:21,246
<i>Oui.</i>

118
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,165
Well, he's about to be
the one from London, huh?

119
00:05:23,216 --> 00:05:25,584
Did you know
he was on this flight?

120
00:05:25,618 --> 00:05:27,252
I love surprises.

121
00:05:31,141 --> 00:05:34,994
Just smile through it,
dear.

122
00:05:37,731 --> 00:05:38,897
Listen,
you can crash here,

123
00:05:38,932 --> 00:05:40,966
but lock the door
when you leave.

124
00:05:40,984 --> 00:05:42,467
Maggie.

125
00:05:42,485 --> 00:05:43,986
You dropped
your silly blue hat.

126
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,522
Look, I get
to see the world, Sam.

127
00:05:46,573 --> 00:05:48,240
When was the last time
you left the village?

128
00:05:48,274 --> 00:05:49,775
I don't need to see
the world to change it.

129
00:05:49,809 --> 00:05:52,444
Well, I do.

130
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:55,197
Taxi! Taxi! Taxi!

131
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:59,585
I'm going to 200 Park Avenue,
the Pan Am building.

132
00:06:06,092 --> 00:06:09,178
Wow. It's beautiful.

133
00:06:09,212 --> 00:06:11,430
Brand-new.
Never been flown.

134
00:06:11,464 --> 00:06:12,965
What do you think, ladies?

135
00:06:12,999 --> 00:06:15,000
Can we make this work?

136
00:06:15,018 --> 00:06:16,301
Are you our pilot?

137
00:06:16,336 --> 00:06:17,336
One of 'em.

138
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:18,503
No, he's our co-pilot.

139
00:06:18,521 --> 00:06:21,340
Well, uh, first officer.

140
00:06:21,374 --> 00:06:22,841
First officer.

141
00:06:28,415 --> 00:06:29,815
Are you okay, miss?

142
00:06:29,849 --> 00:06:32,067
Eyes forward.

143
00:06:43,713 --> 00:06:45,748
Fuel quantity checked.

144
00:06:45,799 --> 00:06:49,501
Flight controls
free and correct.

145
00:06:49,535 --> 00:06:50,702
Are we ready, boys?

146
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,371
Hey. Are you nervous?

147
00:06:52,405 --> 00:06:54,206
'Cause I could take that seat,
if you're nervous.

148
00:06:54,224 --> 00:06:56,975
Thanks, Ted,

149
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:59,578
but Pan Am wants actual pilots
in the left seat.

150
00:06:59,612 --> 00:07:01,513
Ha ha.

151
00:07:21,835 --> 00:07:25,454
Welcome aboard, Mr. Sabel.

152
00:07:25,505 --> 00:07:27,589
Right this way.

153
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:33,095
3d is the aisle.

154
00:07:33,129 --> 00:07:34,430
May I take your coat?

155
00:07:34,464 --> 00:07:37,433
I wear coat when it's cold.

156
00:07:38,685 --> 00:07:39,635
Your briefcase?

157
00:07:39,686 --> 00:07:42,938
Gin with bitters, please.

158
00:08:00,824 --> 00:08:01,974
Colette.

159
00:08:02,008 --> 00:08:04,126
Bonjour.
Welcome aboard, monsieur.

160
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,160
May I take your coat?

161
00:08:05,211 --> 00:08:07,780
John, please slow down.
Tommy slipped.

162
00:08:07,814 --> 00:08:10,165
Oh. Are you all right, buddy?
Uh, Evelyn, coat?

163
00:08:10,216 --> 00:08:12,784
If you don't mind, I'd love to
get our son settled in first.

164
00:08:12,802 --> 00:08:14,787
Certainly. Yeah.

165
00:08:23,963 --> 00:08:25,397
<i>Clipper 22, tower.</i>

166
00:08:25,431 --> 00:08:27,632
<i>Your special delivery
just landed. Over.</i>

167
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:28,600
Roger that, tower.

168
00:08:29,669 --> 00:08:30,853
That's our girl.

169
00:08:41,531 --> 00:08:44,833
<i>The captain will give</i>
<i>you a report on our flight plan</i>

170
00:08:44,868 --> 00:08:47,202

171
00:08:47,253 --> 00:08:49,705
<i>We're happy to have you</i>

172
00:08:49,756 --> 00:08:52,124
Well, thanks, Kate.
Hey.

173
00:08:52,158 --> 00:08:53,392
Maggie, you're our purser?

174
00:08:53,426 --> 00:08:56,595
Best they could manage
on short notice.

175
00:08:56,629 --> 00:08:58,430
Can we roll out, gentlemen?
I'm getting tired of waiting.

176
00:08:58,464 --> 00:08:59,831
Maggie?

177
00:08:59,849 --> 00:09:01,900
Dean?

178
00:09:01,935 --> 00:09:03,602
You're a captain now?

179
00:09:03,636 --> 00:09:05,270
Did you just fly in
on a helicopter?

180
00:09:05,305 --> 00:09:07,806
Oh, well, I like to make
an entrance.

181
00:09:07,841 --> 00:09:10,209
Uh, where's...
Where's Bridget?

182
00:09:10,243 --> 00:09:12,778
I don't know. They just
called me to fill in.

183
00:09:12,812 --> 00:09:16,215
Yeah? Who's filling in
the rest of her?

184
00:09:16,282 --> 00:09:19,985
<i>He</i> won't be doing
any actual flying, will he?

185
00:09:23,256 --> 00:09:25,224
Well, welcome aboard,
Maggie.

186
00:09:25,258 --> 00:09:26,458
Thanks.

187
00:09:31,297 --> 00:09:34,249
So...
Who else do we have?

188
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,435
A new hire. She's in back.

189
00:09:36,469 --> 00:09:38,887
"Laura... Cameron"?

190
00:09:38,922 --> 00:09:41,673
My sister.
I can't seem to escape her.

191
00:09:41,707 --> 00:09:43,842
They put you two
on the same flight?

192
00:09:43,876 --> 00:09:45,894
Mm.

193
00:09:45,929 --> 00:09:49,147
Well, isn't that something?

194
00:09:56,656 --> 00:09:58,240
<i>Clipper 22, idlewild tower.</i>

195
00:09:58,274 --> 00:10:02,127
<i>Cleared for takeoff,
runway 3-1-left.</i>

196
00:10:09,068 --> 00:10:10,235
Cleared for takeoff,

197
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:12,371
3-1-left.
Clipper 2-2 on the roll.

198
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:42,301
So how new <i>are</i> you, Laura?

199
00:10:42,335 --> 00:10:44,836
Is it that obvious?

200
00:10:44,871 --> 00:10:46,705
Better buckle up.

201
00:10:46,739 --> 00:10:48,206
Adventure calls.

202
00:10:48,241 --> 00:10:50,325
Oh.

203
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,929
Sync and corrected by dr.jackson
for www.addic7ed.com

204
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:19,610
Go ahead.

205
00:11:20,662 --> 00:11:21,612
Say it.

206
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:27,018
Welcome,
ladies and gentlemen.

207
00:11:27,052 --> 00:11:29,887
This is
your... captain speaking.

208
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:31,672
<i>Today you get to share</i>
<i>a bit of history</i>

209
00:11:31,723 --> 00:11:33,157
<i>with us here at Pan American.</i>

210
00:11:33,191 --> 00:11:35,927
<i>This is the maiden voyage</i>
<i>of the newest clipper jet</i>

211
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:37,695
<i>in the Pan Am fleet.</i>

212
00:11:37,729 --> 00:11:39,397
<i>If you've never flown</i>
<i>on a jet to Europe before,</i>

213
00:11:39,431 --> 00:11:40,648
<i>you're in for a real treat.</i>

214
00:11:40,682 --> 00:11:41,766
<i>Our flight will only take</i>
<i>six and a half hours...</i>

215
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,167
Oh, thank you.

216
00:11:43,201 --> 00:11:45,169
<i>With no vibrations</i>
<i>or outside noise</i>

217
00:11:45,203 --> 00:11:47,521
<i>in our air-conditioned cabin.</i>

218
00:11:47,572 --> 00:11:50,908
<i>We're traveling at a speed</i>
<i>of 575 miles an hour.</i>

219
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:53,077
<i>In addition, we'll benefit</i>
<i>from a substantial tailwind,</i>

220
00:11:53,111 --> 00:11:54,078
<i>courtesy of the jet stream...</i>

221
00:11:54,112 --> 00:11:55,446
Mm.

222
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:59,283
<i>So our ground speed could reach</i>
<i>over 650 miles per hour.</i>

223
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:01,619
Thirsty?

224
00:12:02,821 --> 00:12:05,022
An American man would say
something, no?

225
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,991
Depends on the subject.

226
00:12:07,009 --> 00:12:10,127
The family in row 5 and 6.

227
00:12:10,161 --> 00:12:11,295
He's married.

228
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:14,198
Oh. Well, did you ask?

229
00:12:14,232 --> 00:12:17,168
Oh, no. I don't care.
I was only surprised.

230
00:12:17,202 --> 00:12:19,937
Oh. Well, good. Okay.

231
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:21,572
That's very French of you.

232
00:12:24,943 --> 00:12:27,078
Should we spike his food
or his drink?

233
00:12:27,112 --> 00:12:28,396
Both.

234
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:30,281
Relax, and enjoy your
clipper jet service to Europe.

235
00:12:34,369 --> 00:12:35,987
What?

236
00:12:36,054 --> 00:12:37,555
I don't think
I can call you "captain."

237
00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:40,458
You gonna be able to
call him "captain," Sanjeev?

238
00:12:40,492 --> 00:12:41,792
35,000 feet, captain.

239
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:43,077
I don't think I can do it.

240
00:12:43,128 --> 00:12:45,629
Maybe I'll start in Spanish,
work my way up to it.

241
00:12:46,865 --> 00:12:48,716
Boston center,
clipper 2-2 with you.

242
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:52,202
Flight level 3-5-0
heading 0-1-niner degrees.

243
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,571
<i>Roger, clipper 22.</i>

244
00:12:54,973 --> 00:12:57,425
Hey, Boston, uh, could you
contact Pan Am operations,

245
00:12:57,476 --> 00:13:01,262
see if they could secure
a location on a Bridget Pierce?

246
00:13:01,313 --> 00:13:02,930
<i>Come again, clipper 22.</i>

247
00:13:02,981 --> 00:13:05,900
Check on our missing stewardess,
will ya?

248
00:13:06,902 --> 00:13:08,936
Whoa. Bailing out already?

249
00:13:08,987 --> 00:13:10,955
Permission to christen
the John, <i>el capitan?</i>

250
00:13:10,989 --> 00:13:14,892
No. Still sounds weird.
Maybe in Italian.

251
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:17,728
Well, Bridget must have
called somebody.

252
00:13:17,746 --> 00:13:20,748
She'll turn up.
She always does.

253
00:13:20,782 --> 00:13:22,933
Hey, Maggie.
Heard you got grounded.

254
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,201
Somebody caught you
out of your girdle?

255
00:13:24,235 --> 00:13:25,169
It won't be the last time.

256
00:13:25,203 --> 00:13:26,236
Let me know
if you need help

257
00:13:26,254 --> 00:13:27,338
with that
uniform inspection, hmm?

258
00:13:27,372 --> 00:13:28,706
Oh, thanks,

259
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,875
but I think I'll leave that
to more experienced hands.

260
00:13:32,177 --> 00:13:34,845
Ohh.

261
00:13:48,026 --> 00:13:48,976
Mm.

262
00:13:50,645 --> 00:13:53,197
E-excuse me.

263
00:13:53,231 --> 00:13:54,732
Mm.
Pardon me.

264
00:13:54,766 --> 00:13:55,783
Oh. Oh.
Oh.

265
00:13:55,817 --> 00:13:57,101
Lunch menu?

266
00:13:57,135 --> 00:13:58,736
- Oh, would you take our picture for us?
- Yes, thank you.

267
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:00,270
Oh. I've never seen one
like that.

268
00:14:00,288 --> 00:14:02,439
Yeah, it takes a special film.
The photos develop right inside.

269
00:14:02,457 --> 00:14:04,408
It was a wedding present
from my parents.

270
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:06,276
Yeah. It's all set up.
Just, uh, press the top there.

271
00:14:06,294 --> 00:14:07,461
Are you on your honeymoon?

272
00:14:07,496 --> 00:14:10,247
Oh, finally.
I knew in the seventh grade.

273
00:14:10,281 --> 00:14:12,183
It just took him
ten years to ask.

274
00:14:12,217 --> 00:14:14,468
Excuse me, miss.
Is this you?

275
00:14:14,503 --> 00:14:16,453
Uh... no.

276
00:14:16,471 --> 00:14:18,456
We are so excited
to be going to London.

277
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,424
We were gonna go to Paris,
but my friend sue Ellen

278
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:22,459
just went to Paris,
and we didn't want to come home

279
00:14:22,477 --> 00:14:24,762
with all the same stories, so...

280
00:14:24,796 --> 00:14:27,865
Ohh! Lovely. Absolutely lovely.

281
00:14:29,734 --> 00:14:31,268
Greg is a very lucky man.

282
00:14:31,302 --> 00:14:33,354
Your father saw him eyeing
this house on Asher

283
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:35,356
near the elementary school.

284
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:37,691
We should really try
the other necklace again.

285
00:14:37,742 --> 00:14:39,110
Perhaps just
a bit more Rouge.

286
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:41,478
Kate, does it fit?

287
00:14:41,496 --> 00:14:42,947
We considered
basting the hem, but...

288
00:14:42,981 --> 00:14:44,748
Don't concern yourself,
sweetheart.

289
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:46,050
If your sister cared how
her dress looked,

290
00:14:46,084 --> 00:14:47,585
she would have flown in
for the fitting.

291
00:14:47,619 --> 00:14:49,553
Oh, I'm sure you guessed
perfectly, mother.

292
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:53,374
Well, I had to, didn't I?
You're still not changed?

293
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:54,491
I had to mend the veil.

294
00:14:54,509 --> 00:14:56,093
What? What did you do to it?

295
00:14:56,128 --> 00:14:58,462
I didn't do anything to it.
It just tore a little bit.

296
00:14:58,496 --> 00:15:01,699
Kate, stop.
Just stop. Get dressed.

297
00:15:01,733 --> 00:15:03,551
I'll tell Greg we need
a few more minutes.

298
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:04,869
Whew.

299
00:15:04,903 --> 00:15:06,604
Are you all right?

300
00:15:06,638 --> 00:15:08,172
Yeah.

301
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:11,809
It's just nerves, I guess.
I can't seem to stop shaking.

302
00:15:11,843 --> 00:15:14,245
Well, you look beautiful,
so just enjoy it.

303
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:15,312
Can I get you anything?

304
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:16,730
Could you get me some water?

305
00:15:16,781 --> 00:15:19,450
Yeah. Of course.
I'll be right back.

306
00:16:06,331 --> 00:16:07,498
Congratulations.

307
00:16:07,532 --> 00:16:09,250
I traveled
for 36 hours straight,

308
00:16:09,284 --> 00:16:10,334
but I got here.

309
00:16:10,368 --> 00:16:11,802
And still you couldn't
manage the time

310
00:16:11,836 --> 00:16:12,870
to change out
of that costume.

311
00:16:12,904 --> 00:16:15,289
I am proud of my uniform.

312
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,840
Do you know
what we get to do?

313
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:19,577
You made it clear you don't care
what I think of what you do.

314
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:21,712
Go ahead. Gallivant around
the world if you like,

315
00:16:21,746 --> 00:16:23,597
but don't use
your sister's special day...

316
00:16:23,632 --> 00:16:25,582
Oh, this isn't Laura's
special day. This is yours,

317
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,417
because Laura hasn't made
a decision for herself

318
00:16:27,435 --> 00:16:28,418
her whole life.

319
00:16:30,355 --> 00:16:33,557
Laura? Laura, what happened?
Did you faint?

320
00:16:33,591 --> 00:16:34,892
- I can't...
- I can't...

321
00:16:34,926 --> 00:16:36,443
Has she eaten this morning?
I can't...

322
00:16:36,478 --> 00:16:38,195
Shh. It's nerves.

323
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,647
Just smile through it, dear.
Mother.

324
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:41,031
I can't...
Shh. I'll get a sedative.

325
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:42,032
I don't think that's...
I can't go through it.

326
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:43,467
Kate, not now.
I-I don't want...

327
00:16:43,501 --> 00:16:44,952
I don't want to get... do you
want me to open the window?

328
00:16:44,986 --> 00:16:46,987
- I don't... I don't want to do this.
- Okay, sweetheart,

329
00:16:47,038 --> 00:16:48,605
- just breathe. -  I don't want to do this.
I don't want to do this.

330
00:16:48,623 --> 00:16:50,274
Just breathe.
You're all right.

331
00:16:50,292 --> 00:16:51,875
I don't want to do this.

332
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:54,111
Okay, do what? Marry Greg?

333
00:16:54,145 --> 00:16:55,212
It's too... it's too late.

334
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:57,298
No, no, no.
No, it's not too late.

335
00:16:57,332 --> 00:16:58,999
I don't want to do...
I don't want to do any of it,

336
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:00,584
but everyone's already here.

337
00:17:00,618 --> 00:17:02,836
Then we'll leave. They can all
have a party without us.

338
00:17:02,887 --> 00:17:04,388
But... mother...

339
00:17:04,422 --> 00:17:05,589
Laura, listen to me.

340
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:07,975
You need to decide
right now,

341
00:17:08,009 --> 00:17:09,526
because this is your life.

342
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:11,629
What do you want to do
with it?

343
00:17:19,354 --> 00:17:21,605
Does daddy still keep
his keys in the visor?

344
00:17:21,639 --> 00:17:22,856
Oh!

345
00:17:22,907 --> 00:17:24,074
I can't believe we're doing this.

346
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:26,026
Laura.
Oh!

347
00:17:26,077 --> 00:17:28,696
- Oh, you look beautiful. Congratulations.
- Thank you. Thank you.

348
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:30,331
- I-I-I have to go.
- Laura!

349
00:17:30,365 --> 00:17:31,832
I have to go!

350
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,653
Where are we going?

351
00:17:36,671 --> 00:17:38,756
I have a week. I'll take you
anywhere you want to go,

352
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:40,157
anything you want to see.

353
00:17:40,191 --> 00:17:41,342
I want to see the world.

354
00:17:41,376 --> 00:17:42,876
I love that plan.

355
00:17:42,927 --> 00:17:45,495
Yeah, you can show it to me.
I'll become a Pan Am stewardess.

356
00:17:54,689 --> 00:17:57,374
Girls, what do you think
you're doing?

357
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:58,942
Go. Go, go, go!
Where are you going?

358
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:01,278
- Get back in the house!
- We are lining up!

359
00:18:02,397 --> 00:18:03,480
Aah!

360
00:18:04,733 --> 00:18:08,686
No! The prelude is starting!

361
00:18:10,312 --> 00:18:11,646
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

362
00:18:11,664 --> 00:18:12,948
<i>for those of you on</i>
<i>the left side of the airplane,</i>

363
00:18:12,982 --> 00:18:14,166
<i>as promised,</i>

364
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,835
<i>you can see the Southern coast</i>
<i>of Greenland.</i>

365
00:18:16,869 --> 00:18:19,521
Colette.

366
00:18:19,555 --> 00:18:21,656
I'm sorry.

367
00:18:21,691 --> 00:18:23,525
Uh, I didn't know
you would be on this flight.

368
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,161
What a coincidence.

369
00:18:26,195 --> 00:18:28,029
I didn't know
you were married.

370
00:18:28,064 --> 00:18:30,031
I thought you understood.

371
00:18:30,066 --> 00:18:32,701
Understood what?
I'm your mistress?

372
00:18:32,735 --> 00:18:35,704
No...

373
00:18:41,744 --> 00:18:44,062
Colette.

374
00:18:44,113 --> 00:18:47,065
I just need a little time.
I-I didn't plan for this.

375
00:18:47,116 --> 00:18:49,784
What was your plan,
Mr. Stanton?

376
00:18:49,819 --> 00:18:51,953
Believe me, when we met,
I didn't expect...

377
00:18:51,988 --> 00:18:52,954
Now, daddy?

378
00:18:52,989 --> 00:18:54,789
It's a long flight, buddy.

379
00:18:54,824 --> 00:18:58,694
Um, he wants to see
the cockpit.

380
00:18:59,228 --> 00:19:02,731
Well, we can do that
right now, okay?

381
00:19:02,765 --> 00:19:05,050
Come on.

382
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:32,287
A long flight?

383
00:20:57,146 --> 00:20:58,830
Bridget!

384
00:21:05,721 --> 00:21:07,539
It's a motorbike now?

385
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:08,790
I talked the salesman
into letting me take her out

386
00:21:08,824 --> 00:21:09,758
for the day.

387
00:21:09,792 --> 00:21:11,042
With your stellar Italian?

388
00:21:11,093 --> 00:21:13,595
That and the <i>americano</i> dollar.
Who's that?

389
00:21:13,629 --> 00:21:17,215
Lost tourist
in need of direction.

390
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:21,603
Good.

391
00:21:22,605 --> 00:21:24,172
I need directions
to Tivoli.

392
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,057
Oh, I-I can't.

393
00:21:26,108 --> 00:21:28,276
I-I promised Kate
I'd meet her for lunch.

394
00:21:28,311 --> 00:21:30,111
So tell her
you got rerouted.

395
00:21:30,146 --> 00:21:31,563
Well, can you wait?

396
00:21:31,614 --> 00:21:33,481
Not my specialty.

397
00:21:33,516 --> 00:21:36,518
I'll, uh, save room
for dessert.

398
00:21:37,653 --> 00:21:39,521
Come and find me.

399
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:45,160
See you soon.

400
00:21:51,734 --> 00:21:52,967
Taxi!

401
00:22:03,713 --> 00:22:05,480
<i>Guardi dove va!</i>

402
00:22:17,243 --> 00:22:19,227
No. Community service.

403
00:22:19,261 --> 00:22:20,578
The 4-H club.

404
00:22:20,613 --> 00:22:22,330
My sister was
the beauty queen.

405
00:22:22,365 --> 00:22:24,532
Well, then somebody got
something backwards.

406
00:22:24,566 --> 00:22:26,501
You'd really have to see her.

407
00:22:26,535 --> 00:22:27,802
Oh, I don't need to.

408
00:22:27,837 --> 00:22:28,903
You found the place?

409
00:22:28,938 --> 00:22:31,072
Oh, yes. They had
a table waiting for us.

410
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:32,040
And your friend?

411
00:22:32,074 --> 00:22:34,609
Oh, um, this is...
I'm sorry.

412
00:22:34,643 --> 00:22:35,593
I didn't catch your name.

413
00:22:35,628 --> 00:22:38,380
Richard. Richard Parks.

414
00:22:38,414 --> 00:22:40,315
Bridget Pierce.

415
00:22:40,349 --> 00:22:42,684
She came to my rescue.

416
00:22:42,718 --> 00:22:44,486
My translation book
was failing me.

417
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,820
A yank?

418
00:22:45,855 --> 00:22:48,289
He's, uh, hopelessly lost,
I'm afraid.

419
00:22:48,324 --> 00:22:49,224
Sit down.

420
00:22:49,258 --> 00:22:50,642
- I can't. I'm sorry.
- Oh.

421
00:22:50,693 --> 00:22:51,860
I just didn't want you
to be waiting.

422
00:22:51,894 --> 00:22:54,329
They need a purser
on the evening flight to Berlin.

423
00:22:54,363 --> 00:22:55,430
<i>Ma rimani. Lui e carino.</i>

424
00:22:55,448 --> 00:22:57,432
Uh... <i>Forse un pochino.</i>

425
00:22:57,466 --> 00:22:59,367
<i>- Ci vediamo a New York.</i> 
- Okay.

426
00:22:59,402 --> 00:23:00,869
- Ciao.
- Ciao, Bridget.

427
00:23:02,071 --> 00:23:03,822
I take it
that wasn't your sister.

428
00:23:03,873 --> 00:23:07,158
Oh. No, no. We fly together.
I'm a Pan Am stewardess.

429
00:23:07,209 --> 00:23:09,244
Oh, well, that's
my favorite kind of stewardess.

430
00:23:09,278 --> 00:23:11,679
So what do you do
for a living, Mr. Parks?

431
00:23:11,714 --> 00:23:13,748
I work
for the U.S. government.

432
00:23:13,783 --> 00:23:14,749
Intelligence.

433
00:23:14,784 --> 00:23:16,451
Hard to believe?

434
00:23:16,485 --> 00:23:17,836
No trench coat?

435
00:23:17,887 --> 00:23:20,355
Mm. I didn't say
I was any good at it.

436
00:23:20,389 --> 00:23:23,324
You, on the other hand,
fit the profile perfectly...

437
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:26,561
Beautiful, well-educated,
trilingual.

438
00:23:26,595 --> 00:23:28,229
And I have
the perfect cover.

439
00:23:28,264 --> 00:23:29,497
Exactly.

440
00:23:29,532 --> 00:23:31,499
A Pan Am stewardess can
travel all around the world

441
00:23:31,534 --> 00:23:33,601
without suspicion.

442
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:38,473
Wait. How did you know
I was trilingual?

443
00:23:38,491 --> 00:23:41,042
No, thank you.

444
00:23:46,682 --> 00:23:49,384
Can I get you
anything else?

445
00:23:49,418 --> 00:23:53,505
Uh, yes. Some peace.

446
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:05,700
Maggie.

447
00:24:05,734 --> 00:24:09,187
Sir, would you like
some caviar?

448
00:24:09,221 --> 00:24:10,505
From where?

449
00:24:10,523 --> 00:24:13,174
Flown in daily
from the Caspian Sea.

450
00:24:13,192 --> 00:24:15,777
Perhaps later.

451
00:24:15,811 --> 00:24:18,079
Wait. Wait!

452
00:24:22,551 --> 00:24:24,586
That is
my "life" magazine.

453
00:24:25,855 --> 00:24:29,207
No, I believe yours is
in your briefcase.

454
00:24:41,921 --> 00:24:43,238
Can I steal a cup?

455
00:24:43,272 --> 00:24:44,305
Help yourself.

456
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,590
Hi. I'm Ted.

457
00:24:45,641 --> 00:24:46,774
The first officer.

458
00:24:46,809 --> 00:24:48,259
That's right.
What's your name?

459
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:49,227
Laura.

460
00:24:49,261 --> 00:24:50,378
Laura.

461
00:24:50,429 --> 00:24:52,897
Is this, uh, your first,
uh, intercontinental?

462
00:24:52,932 --> 00:24:53,898
- Oh, no.
- It is.

463
00:24:53,933 --> 00:24:55,149
Nope. Not this one.

464
00:24:55,184 --> 00:24:56,067
I'm just being hospitable.

465
00:24:56,101 --> 00:24:57,752
Consider her
restricted airspace.

466
00:24:57,786 --> 00:25:00,588
I'm just helping you girls out,
pouring myself some coffee.

467
00:25:00,623 --> 00:25:02,440
You know, for a co-pilot,
you spend a lot of time

468
00:25:02,491 --> 00:25:04,242
out of the cockpit.

469
00:25:04,276 --> 00:25:06,444
Great.

470
00:25:06,495 --> 00:25:09,697
If you need anything,
Laura, you let me know.

471
00:25:19,542 --> 00:25:21,809
I almost called home
last night.

472
00:25:21,844 --> 00:25:23,177
Did you finally tell
mom and dad

473
00:25:23,212 --> 00:25:26,214
- that you followed me into the uniform?
- I wrote a letter.

474
00:25:26,248 --> 00:25:28,916
You better hope it gets
there before "Life" magazine.

475
00:25:28,934 --> 00:25:31,803
Miss?
Um, excuse me.

476
00:25:31,854 --> 00:25:34,222
Can you help me?

477
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:41,229
Have you seen my glasses?
I think I left them in my coat.

478
00:25:44,149 --> 00:25:45,766
Yes, I'll take a look.

479
00:25:45,784 --> 00:25:47,285
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>we're hitting a patch</i>

480
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:48,769
<i>of rough air,</i>
<i>so for your safety,</i>

481
00:25:48,787 --> 00:25:51,439
<i>I'm gonna ask you to please</i>
<i>return to your seat.</i>

482
00:25:53,909 --> 00:25:55,710
I've got it. I've got it.

483
00:25:55,744 --> 00:25:56,611
I'm sorry. I couldn't...

484
00:25:56,629 --> 00:25:58,413
I thought you trained
for this.

485
00:25:58,447 --> 00:25:59,998
Kate, I just started.
This is hard for me.

486
00:26:00,049 --> 00:26:02,083
Hard for you, Laura?
Nothing is hard for you.

487
00:26:02,117 --> 00:26:03,084
You're perfect.

488
00:26:03,118 --> 00:26:04,302
Is that what you think?

489
00:26:04,386 --> 00:26:07,622
Just get out of my way.
I do not need a lost puppy.

490
00:26:41,198 --> 00:26:43,499
That's good, baby.

491
00:26:45,686 --> 00:26:47,453
Excuse me, miss?

492
00:26:47,488 --> 00:26:48,871
Yes?

493
00:26:48,906 --> 00:26:51,641
I'm sorry.
I didn't catch your name.

494
00:26:51,675 --> 00:26:53,076
Colette.

495
00:26:53,143 --> 00:26:56,112
Colette. Thank you so much for
taking Tommy up to the cockpit.

496
00:26:56,146 --> 00:26:59,382
Oh, it was our pleasure.
He's a very sweet boy.

497
00:27:02,202 --> 00:27:04,287
Could you sit for a moment?

498
00:27:04,321 --> 00:27:06,856
Is that allowed,
visiting with the passengers?

499
00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:11,160
Yes.

500
00:27:11,195 --> 00:27:15,365
I can't imagine what it's like
to be on your feet for so long.

501
00:27:15,399 --> 00:27:17,166
You get accustomed to it.

502
00:27:17,201 --> 00:27:19,035
I wanted to ask you where
you get your eyelashes.

503
00:27:19,069 --> 00:27:21,170
They look so natural.

504
00:27:21,205 --> 00:27:23,339
No. No, they <i>are</i> natural.

505
00:27:23,374 --> 00:27:24,941
They're mine.

506
00:27:24,975 --> 00:27:26,276
Darn.

507
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:28,811
I was hoping they were Parisian,
and I could pick up a pair.

508
00:27:28,846 --> 00:27:31,014
You're blessed.

509
00:27:31,048 --> 00:27:33,549
I'm jealous.

510
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,770
What are you drawing, Tommy?

511
00:27:37,821 --> 00:27:39,822
Oh, last month
it was space rockets.

512
00:27:39,857 --> 00:27:41,441
This month it's airplanes.

513
00:27:44,828 --> 00:27:47,196
Lovely. You're an artist.

514
00:27:48,832 --> 00:27:51,968
Miss, could I have
another Martini, please?

515
00:27:52,002 --> 00:27:53,202
John, don't drive her off.

516
00:27:53,237 --> 00:27:54,537
No, not at all.

517
00:27:54,571 --> 00:27:57,373
Thank you.

518
00:27:57,407 --> 00:27:58,875
My pleasure.

519
00:28:04,014 --> 00:28:06,349
<i>Clipper 22, Gander Oceanic.</i>

520
00:28:06,383 --> 00:28:08,801
Gander Oceanic, clipper 2-2.
Go ahead.

521
00:28:08,852 --> 00:28:12,021
Pan Am operations asked us
to relay a response.

522
00:28:12,056 --> 00:28:15,124
Your missing stewardess resigned
from the London office.

523
00:28:15,159 --> 00:28:16,592
They don't mean Bridget,
do they?

524
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:18,194
<i>Do you copy, clipper 22?</i>

525
00:28:20,648 --> 00:28:23,299
Uh, Roger, Gander Oceanic.
Clipper 2-2.

526
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:25,535
Thanks for passing
that along. Over.

527
00:28:25,569 --> 00:28:27,704
Bridget loves Pan Am.
She wouldn't quit.

528
00:28:27,738 --> 00:28:28,871
Never trust a radio.

529
00:28:28,906 --> 00:28:31,074
They once lost track of me
for three weeks in Brazil.

530
00:28:32,609 --> 00:28:35,044
Unless...
What?

531
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:37,780
She'd <i>have</i> to quit
if she got married.

532
00:28:37,798 --> 00:28:39,882
Uh, who? What, Bridget?

533
00:28:39,917 --> 00:28:42,185
Oh, Dean. The whole company
knows about you two.

534
00:28:42,219 --> 00:28:43,553
I didn't know.

535
00:28:43,587 --> 00:28:46,956
Everybody but Sanjeev
knows about you two.

536
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:50,126
Did you get engaged?

537
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,195
Ahh! You son of a bitch!

538
00:28:52,229 --> 00:28:54,364
Congratulations.

539
00:28:54,398 --> 00:28:56,399
If you're engaged,
why is she in London?

540
00:28:56,433 --> 00:28:58,000
Oh, who knows where
that woman ever is?

541
00:28:58,035 --> 00:28:59,769
She barely made it
on the plane in Cuba.

542
00:28:59,803 --> 00:29:00,937
She was in Cuba?

543
00:29:00,971 --> 00:29:02,505
We all were.
Flew out the last DC-6

544
00:29:02,539 --> 00:29:04,307
full of released
Bay of Pigs prisoners

545
00:29:04,341 --> 00:29:05,575
for Uncle Sam.

546
00:29:05,609 --> 00:29:07,577
Plane with a mutiny?

547
00:29:07,611 --> 00:29:09,612
Ah, it wasn't a mutiny.

548
00:29:27,097 --> 00:29:28,548
<i>¿Esta bien?</i>

549
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:31,217
<i>Rapido, rapido.</i>

550
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:35,838
- Is this the last of 'em?
- You're asking <i>me?</i>

551
00:29:35,856 --> 00:29:39,175
I thought Pan Am was just
flying out some freed prisoners.

552
00:29:39,193 --> 00:29:41,177
You didn't say we'd have
to leave the plane.

553
00:29:41,211 --> 00:29:43,679
Let's get off the ground before
someone changes their mind.

554
00:29:43,697 --> 00:29:45,214
<i>Por favor, sigan moviendose.</i>

555
00:29:45,249 --> 00:29:48,317
- Hey, get on!
- We're wheels up in ten!

556
00:29:48,351 --> 00:29:49,819
At least they don't have
any luggage, huh?

557
00:29:49,853 --> 00:29:51,220
Where's the state department?

558
00:29:51,255 --> 00:29:53,289
I thought they were supposed
to be organizing this.

559
00:29:53,323 --> 00:29:54,657
Organized the Bays of Pigs.

560
00:29:54,691 --> 00:29:56,876
I'd rather they just pay Castro
his ransom. Come on!

561
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:58,194
We did try to invade
his country.

562
00:29:58,212 --> 00:29:59,829
<i>- His</i> country?
- Whose country is it?

563
00:29:59,863 --> 00:30:02,465
Castro's never gonna be able
to hold on to it. Come on!

564
00:30:02,499 --> 00:30:04,467
<i>Vamonos,</i> Maggie.

565
00:30:06,203 --> 00:30:08,087
Let's get outta here.

566
00:30:11,041 --> 00:30:12,374
Where's Bridget?

567
00:30:17,514 --> 00:30:20,082
Number four fuel boost
pump off.

568
00:30:21,218 --> 00:30:22,552
Check. Pump off.

569
00:30:22,586 --> 00:30:24,787
All engines stabilized
at 1,000 R.P.M.

570
00:30:24,822 --> 00:30:26,439
Let's get the hell
outta here.

571
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:28,608
Cabin secured?
We don't have Bridget.

572
00:30:28,659 --> 00:30:30,793
Well, where is she?

573
00:30:30,828 --> 00:30:32,328
She's not on the plane.
I didn't see her outside.

574
00:30:32,362 --> 00:30:34,363
Captain, you're gonna
have to kill the engines.

575
00:30:34,398 --> 00:30:36,365
No, no, no.
I have a mission

576
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,400
and a plane full of people
I'm responsible for.

577
00:30:37,434 --> 00:30:38,835
You can't leave
without your crew.

578
00:30:38,869 --> 00:30:40,402
We finally have clearance now.
We're leaving.

579
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:42,004
Yeah, not without her,
you're not.

580
00:30:42,039 --> 00:30:44,073
I'm not gonna get stuck in Cuba.
Dean!

581
00:30:44,107 --> 00:30:46,843
I swear to God,
I will take off without you!

582
00:30:46,877 --> 00:30:49,145
Hey! Move! Move!

583
00:30:49,179 --> 00:30:51,380
Maggie, tell these people
we're taking off in one minute.

584
00:30:51,414 --> 00:30:54,300
We're getting outta here, and do
not let him close this door!

585
00:30:54,351 --> 00:30:55,685
<i>No pasa nada.</i>

586
00:30:55,719 --> 00:30:59,939
No, no, no, no, no.

587
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:06,729
Go, go, go, go.
What are you doing out here?

588
00:31:06,763 --> 00:31:07,697
Looking for you.

589
00:31:07,731 --> 00:31:09,398
We forgot one.
We almost forgot you!

590
00:31:09,432 --> 00:31:10,650
You're always
disappearing on me.

591
00:31:10,701 --> 00:31:12,068
I always come back.

592
00:31:12,102 --> 00:31:14,320
Then good. Promise.
Marry me.

593
00:31:14,371 --> 00:31:15,404
What?!

594
00:31:15,438 --> 00:31:16,639
You heard me!

595
00:31:16,673 --> 00:31:18,741
You're asking me now?

596
00:31:18,775 --> 00:31:20,409
Well, I just decided now!

597
00:31:20,443 --> 00:31:23,913
On a tarmac in Cuba
with a plane full of exiles?

598
00:31:23,947 --> 00:31:25,498
Are you mad?

599
00:31:27,968 --> 00:31:30,336
Say "yes" now!

600
00:31:31,621 --> 00:31:34,056
It'll make a great story!

601
00:31:34,091 --> 00:31:37,426
Dean, I...

602
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,762
I-I can't say "yes" now.

603
00:31:52,242 --> 00:31:54,243
Then say "yes" later.

604
00:32:03,921 --> 00:32:06,455
<i> Arriba!</i>

605
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,780
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

606
00:32:22,814 --> 00:32:24,632
<i>we're beginning our descent</i>
<i>into London Heathrow airport,</i>

607
00:32:24,666 --> 00:32:27,685
<i>where the local time</i>
<i>is approximately 8:05.</i>

608
00:32:28,608 --> 00:32:31,527
My newlyweds want a bottle
of champagne to take with them.

609
00:32:31,578 --> 00:32:33,162
Do we do that?

610
00:32:33,196 --> 00:32:34,847
Uh, sometimes, if they're nice.

611
00:32:34,881 --> 00:32:36,749
They're certainly nice
to each other.

612
00:32:38,151 --> 00:32:39,335
Thanks.

613
00:32:42,289 --> 00:32:44,924
Kate, I never wanted
to be a burden to you.

614
00:32:44,958 --> 00:32:46,458
I will ask
to get reassigned.

615
00:32:46,493 --> 00:32:48,193
Laura, I'm sorry. It's not
that I don't want you here.

616
00:32:48,228 --> 00:32:50,429
But you ran away from home
for a reason.

617
00:32:50,463 --> 00:32:53,899
I liked knowing you were there
to come home to.

618
00:32:53,934 --> 00:32:56,302
<i>- Oh, this is fine.
- I'll take that from you.</i>

619
00:32:56,336 --> 00:32:58,520
Wait. Hold on.

620
00:33:02,309 --> 00:33:03,742
Ladies and gentlemen,

621
00:33:03,777 --> 00:33:05,711
in honor of this jet clipper's
inaugural flight,

622
00:33:05,745 --> 00:33:06,879
by a random selection,

623
00:33:06,913 --> 00:33:08,681
we'd like to offer
the passenger in 3D

624
00:33:08,715 --> 00:33:09,949
a bottle of champagne.

625
00:33:09,983 --> 00:33:12,034
Please, give him
a round of applause.

626
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,705
Here you are, sir.
Compliments of Pan Am.

627
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:19,525
No, thank you.

628
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:21,744
Oh. All right.

629
00:33:21,828 --> 00:33:23,362
Wait.

630
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:24,597
Is this you?

631
00:33:24,631 --> 00:33:26,732
Yes.

632
00:33:28,668 --> 00:33:30,135
I thought these
were models, no?

633
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:32,805
Well, I just graduated
from stewardess school,

634
00:33:32,839 --> 00:33:35,808
and I was crossing the street
to go call my sister.

635
00:33:35,842 --> 00:33:38,877
I hardly remember
the photographer.

636
00:33:38,912 --> 00:33:42,247
I was just... happy.

637
00:33:43,683 --> 00:33:45,884
I guess it made a good picture.

638
00:34:10,126 --> 00:34:11,460
Have a good evening.

639
00:34:11,511 --> 00:34:12,778
Welcome to London.
Welcome.

640
00:34:12,812 --> 00:34:13,929
Thank you.

641
00:34:13,964 --> 00:34:15,214
Stay dry.

642
00:34:15,248 --> 00:34:17,433
- Have a good evening.
- Thanks.

643
00:34:17,467 --> 00:34:19,518
Welcome to London.

644
00:34:21,221 --> 00:34:23,756
- Thank you, ladies.
- Welcome to London.

645
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:26,642
Welcome to London.

646
00:34:26,693 --> 00:34:28,093
Thank you again.

647
00:34:28,111 --> 00:34:29,144
- Our pleasure.
- Thank you.

648
00:34:29,195 --> 00:34:31,280
Have a wonderful trip.

649
00:34:31,314 --> 00:34:34,266
You still love surprises?

650
00:34:34,284 --> 00:34:36,201
Only the good ones.

651
00:34:36,236 --> 00:34:38,804
Oh, so sorry.
I forgot my purse.

652
00:34:38,838 --> 00:34:41,323
I'll get it for you.

653
00:34:41,374 --> 00:34:44,109
Thank you for flying
with Pan Am.

654
00:34:45,779 --> 00:34:47,780
Here it is.

655
00:34:47,814 --> 00:34:49,999
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

656
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:51,300
Tommy's drawing.

657
00:34:51,334 --> 00:34:53,986
No, keep that.
I want you to have it.

658
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:56,055
Put it on your refrigerator
to help remind you

659
00:34:56,089 --> 00:34:59,191
not to sleep
with other women's husbands.

660
00:35:42,168 --> 00:35:43,902
You're going to be great
at this.

661
00:35:54,364 --> 00:35:55,581
Excuse me.

662
00:35:55,615 --> 00:35:58,617
Would you, uh, would you
place a local call for me?

663
00:35:58,651 --> 00:36:00,369
Bridget Pierce.

664
00:36:00,403 --> 00:36:01,887
Bridget Pierce.
Certainly, sir.

665
00:36:01,921 --> 00:36:03,355
I'll patch it
through to the house phone.

666
00:36:03,373 --> 00:36:04,890
Great. Thank you.

667
00:36:11,664 --> 00:36:12,965
Very dramatic.

668
00:36:12,999 --> 00:36:15,067
Is that my "yes"?

669
00:36:15,101 --> 00:36:16,902
Hello?

670
00:36:16,936 --> 00:36:18,203
Bridget.

671
00:36:18,238 --> 00:36:20,005
<i>This is the operator, sir.</i>

672
00:36:20,039 --> 00:36:24,176
<i>I'm sorry. This number for this
residence has been disconnected.</i>

673
00:36:47,333 --> 00:36:49,434
Eventful flight?

674
00:36:49,469 --> 00:36:51,570
You're late.

675
00:36:51,604 --> 00:36:55,474
You're... British.

676
00:36:55,508 --> 00:36:57,776
Keen Powers of perception.

677
00:36:59,946 --> 00:37:02,848
Give it a moment.
You'll catch up.

678
00:37:02,882 --> 00:37:06,952
I take it you weren't
detained at customs.

679
00:37:09,439 --> 00:37:11,156
Roger Anderson, MI6.

680
00:37:12,792 --> 00:37:14,059
I'll be one
of your London contacts.

681
00:37:14,093 --> 00:37:17,262
The passport?

682
00:37:17,297 --> 00:37:18,564
One of many.

683
00:37:18,598 --> 00:37:21,099
You didn't think we'd
throw you into the field

684
00:37:21,117 --> 00:37:23,402
without a test,
now, did you?

685
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:27,472
You passed, by the way...

686
00:37:27,507 --> 00:37:28,740
Barely.

687
00:37:28,775 --> 00:37:31,293
You walked out with it,
didn't you?

688
00:37:31,327 --> 00:37:32,845
No matter.
We were testing mind-set.

689
00:37:32,879 --> 00:37:34,780
We were testing will.

690
00:37:34,814 --> 00:37:38,550
Your real assignments
might, in fact, be easier.

691
00:37:53,983 --> 00:37:55,801
Almost all foreign diplomats
and businessmen,

692
00:37:55,835 --> 00:37:58,020
persons posing as such
fly Pan Am.

693
00:37:58,071 --> 00:38:01,006
You'll be expected to keep
your eyes and ears open

694
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,475
and communicate back to us.

695
00:38:03,509 --> 00:38:06,495
Sometimes you'll function
as a courier.

696
00:38:08,514 --> 00:38:10,182
Bridget?

697
00:38:12,452 --> 00:38:14,887
Bridget?

698
00:38:17,457 --> 00:38:19,591
But you must use discretion
at all times.

699
00:38:19,626 --> 00:38:22,961
Make no mistake. We call it
a cold war for a reason.

700
00:38:23,029 --> 00:38:25,264
I understand.

701
00:38:26,633 --> 00:38:28,567
I certainly
hope that you do.

702
00:38:28,601 --> 00:38:29,902
Mr. Anderson,

703
00:38:29,936 --> 00:38:33,272
people have underestimated me
my entire life,

704
00:38:33,339 --> 00:38:35,440
and they've been wrong.

705
00:38:35,475 --> 00:38:39,077
Yes, well,
we'll see if you...

706
00:38:39,112 --> 00:38:42,114
Live up
to your recommendation.

707
00:39:13,146 --> 00:39:16,581
Wait. It was Bridget,
wasn't it?

708
00:39:17,917 --> 00:39:21,353
Bridget arranged that meeting
with Richard in Rome.

709
00:39:21,387 --> 00:39:24,723
She had an eye for talent.

710
00:39:24,757 --> 00:39:27,292
"Had"?

711
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,381
Am I her replacement?

712
00:39:56,105 --> 00:39:59,975
I have great hopes
for you, Kate.

713
00:40:22,915 --> 00:40:24,499
I think I like debriefing.

714
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:26,752
It's unofficial,
but mandatory.

715
00:40:26,786 --> 00:40:27,952
Yep. Yep.

716
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:31,506
Tomorrow another plane takes off
to someplace new.

717
00:40:31,557 --> 00:40:34,009
Vanished... today's mistakes.

718
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:37,396
Their only trace...
A touch more wisdom.

719
00:40:37,463 --> 00:40:39,514
I think I understand you
better in French.

720
00:40:41,067 --> 00:40:42,868
Is that
the British edition?

721
00:40:42,902 --> 00:40:44,069
Oh, no.

722
00:40:44,103 --> 00:40:45,570
Well, I had to get my own copy.

723
00:40:45,605 --> 00:40:49,274
Another continent?
I can't get away from it.

724
00:40:49,308 --> 00:40:50,809
Why would you want to?

725
00:40:50,843 --> 00:40:53,745
Hmm. I'm not that picture.
I...

726
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:55,664
I could never live up
to that.

727
00:40:55,698 --> 00:40:57,749
Because it's not you.

728
00:40:57,784 --> 00:40:59,317
It is the promise of you.

729
00:40:59,352 --> 00:41:02,387
<i>This</i> is all of us.

730
00:41:03,589 --> 00:41:06,425
Face it. If Bridget
were predictable,

731
00:41:06,459 --> 00:41:08,126
you would eventually
lose interest.

732
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,128
I've hit on enough
of these girls to know

733
00:41:10,163 --> 00:41:11,329
that they're not like
normal women.

734
00:41:11,347 --> 00:41:13,131
They're... blah.
I don't know.

735
00:41:13,166 --> 00:41:15,167
They're... mutations.

736
00:41:15,201 --> 00:41:17,369
I think I know where you're
going wrong there, ace.

737
00:41:17,403 --> 00:41:18,770
Well, I mean that
as a compliment.

738
00:41:18,805 --> 00:41:21,440
You think the first man to crawl
out of the primordial ooze

739
00:41:21,474 --> 00:41:23,442
knew he was different? No.

740
00:41:23,476 --> 00:41:26,344
He just had an impulse
that there was more to life

741
00:41:26,362 --> 00:41:28,180
than primordial ooze.

742
00:41:28,214 --> 00:41:31,032
Is this you trying
to make me feel better?

743
00:41:31,067 --> 00:41:32,567
Uh...

744
00:41:32,618 --> 00:41:35,520
See... you see that table
over there?

745
00:41:35,538 --> 00:41:40,292
<i>That</i> is natural selection
at work, my friend.

746
00:41:40,326 --> 00:41:42,026
They don't know

747
00:41:42,044 --> 00:41:43,161
that they're a new breed
of woman.

748
00:41:43,196 --> 00:41:48,266
They just had an impulse
to... take flight.

749
00:41:53,389 --> 00:41:55,607
So don't try and ground 'em.

750
00:41:59,479 --> 00:42:00,729
That was
a tricky approach tonight.

751
00:42:02,381 --> 00:42:04,215
Hell of a landing...

752
00:42:05,351 --> 00:42:06,351
Captain.

753
00:42:06,385 --> 00:42:08,220
Appreciate that.

754
00:42:08,254 --> 00:42:09,888
It's the only time
you're ever gonna hear it.

755
00:42:09,906 --> 00:42:10,889
Mm?

756
00:42:10,923 --> 00:42:11,857
You got it.

757
00:42:11,891 --> 00:42:13,158
Take two more, please.

758
00:42:13,192 --> 00:42:15,360
Yeah, I heard Mickey
down at baggage...
