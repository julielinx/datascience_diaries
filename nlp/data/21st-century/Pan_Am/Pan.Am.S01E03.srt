1
00:00:00,969 --> 00:00:02,289
Previously on "Pan Am".

2
00:00:02,321 --> 00:00:04,688
You're always disappearing
on me. Marry me.

3
00:00:04,696 --> 00:00:06,096
I-I can't say "yes" now.

4
00:00:06,164 --> 00:00:07,331
Bridget?

5
00:00:10,536 --> 00:00:12,637
You and I finally make it
to Paris!

6
00:00:13,906 --> 00:00:16,140
- Are you going my way?
- Sometimes the stars align.

7
00:00:16,207 --> 00:00:17,775
I work
for the U.S. government.

8
00:00:17,843 --> 00:00:18,744
A Pan Am stewardess

9
00:00:18,745 --> 00:00:21,210
can travel all around the
world without suspicion.

10
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:22,979
They wanted you to deliver this

11
00:00:23,047 --> 00:00:24,714
so that you would see
what happens

12
00:00:24,782 --> 00:00:26,482
when you don't follow orders.

13
00:00:27,718 --> 00:00:29,553
What are you doing?

14
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:52,977
Mind if I sit?

15
00:00:53,045 --> 00:00:55,413
Uh, no, not at all.

16
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:03,120
The newsstand
at my station was out.

17
00:01:03,189 --> 00:01:06,123
At least they had
"Popular Mechanics."

18
00:01:06,192 --> 00:01:07,957
That's... good.

19
00:01:08,025 --> 00:01:09,959
What's happening
in the world?

20
00:01:10,027 --> 00:01:13,297
The... president is going
to Berlin.

21
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:16,466
Right, right. First visit
since the wall went up.

22
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:18,068
Have you ever been?

23
00:01:18,135 --> 00:01:22,072
To Berlin? Oh, uh, sure.
I've... I've been a bunch of...

24
00:01:22,139 --> 00:01:23,906
I'm going again soon.

25
00:01:23,973 --> 00:01:24,973
There's
this good little bookshop

26
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:26,842
on Friedrichstrasse.

27
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:28,644
They sell first editions
of Nietzsche.

28
00:01:28,712 --> 00:01:32,415
"The will to power,"
<i>"der wille zur macht"...</i>

29
00:01:32,482 --> 00:01:34,116
Terrific read.

30
00:01:34,184 --> 00:01:35,484
And that's where I start?

31
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,854
A map of Berlin
with the exact location.

32
00:01:38,922 --> 00:01:40,422
Buy the book. Bring it home.

33
00:01:40,489 --> 00:01:41,923
That's it?

34
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:45,159
Tell the clerk, <i>"ich bin hier</i>
<i>um ein buch zu kaufen."</i>

35
00:01:45,228 --> 00:01:46,928
<i>Ich bin ein...</i>

36
00:01:46,995 --> 00:01:48,263
<i>Ich bin hier...</i>

37
00:01:48,331 --> 00:01:51,933
<i>Ich bin hier um ein</i>
<i>buch... buch... buch zu kaufen.</i>

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,802
Maybe work on that.
Oh. Here's your stop.

39
00:02:07,782 --> 00:02:09,850
<i>- Have a wonderful time.
- Congratulations.</i>

40
00:02:09,917 --> 00:02:11,184
<i>Attention, please.</i>

41
00:02:11,252 --> 00:02:12,918
<i>Pan Am flight 32</i>

42
00:02:12,986 --> 00:02:15,588
<i>is now ready for boarding</i>
<i>at gate 11.</i>

43
00:02:15,656 --> 00:02:17,290
<i>Flight 32 is now ready</i>
<i>for boarding...</i>

44
00:02:17,358 --> 00:02:20,226
Berlin?

45
00:02:20,294 --> 00:02:23,563
Is it as beautiful
as it is in the pictures?

46
00:02:23,631 --> 00:02:25,732
I can't wait to find out.

47
00:02:25,799 --> 00:02:26,899
<i>Arriving passengers</i>

48
00:02:26,967 --> 00:02:28,567
<i>on flight 9 from Lisbon...</i>

49
00:02:28,635 --> 00:02:29,768
How have you flown
this whole time

50
00:02:29,835 --> 00:02:31,069
and not gone to Germany?

51
00:02:31,137 --> 00:02:32,738
It's a mystery.

52
00:02:32,805 --> 00:02:35,073
That's right. You were pulled
into Japan last time.

53
00:02:35,141 --> 00:02:39,745
Yes. I'm overdue,
but today is the day.

54
00:02:39,812 --> 00:02:41,012
Good morning, Colette.

55
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,414
Good morning.

56
00:02:43,482 --> 00:02:44,715
Here you go, sir.

57
00:02:44,783 --> 00:02:46,417
Ready for Germany?

58
00:02:46,485 --> 00:02:47,918
That's the rumor.

59
00:02:47,986 --> 00:02:50,421
Are you preparing to toast
the president?

60
00:02:50,489 --> 00:02:52,757
With anything but whiskey.

61
00:02:52,824 --> 00:02:54,158
I'm laying off the stuff
for a while.

62
00:02:54,225 --> 00:02:55,159
Are you?

63
00:02:55,226 --> 00:02:57,194
Oh, yeah, and cigarettes.

64
00:02:57,262 --> 00:02:59,996
I've been told
that they lead to dancing.

65
00:03:01,499 --> 00:03:03,433
I'm surprised you remember.

66
00:03:03,501 --> 00:03:06,269
I remember I had
a lot of whiskey...

67
00:03:06,337 --> 00:03:09,372
And stepping on your foot.

68
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,776
But you seem to be walking okay,
so I guess, uh...

69
00:03:12,843 --> 00:03:14,311
It was a moment, captain,

70
00:03:14,378 --> 00:03:17,913
a nice moment,
but that was all.

71
00:03:19,215 --> 00:03:20,549
You've never done
a press charter?

72
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:23,385
I've never done
a charter, period.

73
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:24,886
You just gotta keep the drinks flowing...

74
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:27,055
Keep their cigarettes lit,
and you'll be fine.

75
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:29,124
That's very helpful.
Thank you, captain.

76
00:03:29,192 --> 00:03:30,592
I do what I can.

77
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,227
But he's right.

78
00:03:33,295 --> 00:03:35,062
Journalists can be
seasoned travelers,

79
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:37,898
and seasoned travelers
can be particular.

80
00:03:37,966 --> 00:03:39,400
They need food they can eat
with one hand,

81
00:03:39,468 --> 00:03:41,402
and they expect to be treated
as though their work is

82
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,903
the most important work
in the world.

83
00:03:42,971 --> 00:03:44,271
You girls gossiping
about the pilots again?

84
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,540
Journalists.

85
00:03:45,607 --> 00:03:48,007
Oh, right. I blame them
for our 24-hour layover.

86
00:03:48,075 --> 00:03:49,275
Oh, that's just enough time
for Kennedy

87
00:03:49,344 --> 00:03:51,345
to speechify a little,
give the wall a good kick.

88
00:03:51,412 --> 00:03:54,080
Farm boy, I pegged you
as a Nixon supporter.

89
00:03:54,148 --> 00:03:55,248
Eh, they're all the same.

90
00:03:55,316 --> 00:03:57,317
How fashionably cynical of you.

91
00:03:57,385 --> 00:03:59,919
Oh, is he knocking
the wall over?

92
00:03:59,987 --> 00:04:01,421
No, he's going
to kiss it.

93
00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:03,922
Kennedy <i>loves</i> the wall.
He loves communists.

94
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:06,258
He loves their cigars.
We have that in common.

95
00:04:06,326 --> 00:04:07,660
That's all you know
about him, isn't it?

96
00:04:07,728 --> 00:04:08,927
Yeah,
what do you know about him?

97
00:04:08,995 --> 00:04:11,263
Maggie was a precinct captain
for his campaign.

98
00:04:11,331 --> 00:04:12,264
Oh, so you've met him?

99
00:04:12,332 --> 00:04:13,432
No, but I'm going to.

100
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,433
You're gonna meet Kennedy?

101
00:04:14,501 --> 00:04:15,701
- That's right.
- When?

102
00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:16,702
Tomorrow in Berlin.

103
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:20,372
Good luck with that.

104
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:21,873
Journalists.

105
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,208
You think one of them might
know the president?

106
00:04:40,392 --> 00:04:41,658
A paper, sir?

107
00:04:41,726 --> 00:04:44,160
Can I get you anything else
to drink, Mr. Manchester?

108
00:04:44,228 --> 00:04:46,196
No, but you can take
this away.

109
00:04:46,264 --> 00:04:49,500
Too salty for my taste.
A simple pastry will do.

110
00:04:50,635 --> 00:04:52,468
Uh...

111
00:04:54,304 --> 00:04:57,206
When you get a chance,
I'd love your autograph.

112
00:04:57,274 --> 00:05:00,075
You are aware that
I'm not a movie star

113
00:05:00,143 --> 00:05:01,511
<i>or</i> a baseball player?

114
00:05:01,578 --> 00:05:04,113
I've met them.

115
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,449
What they have to say
would not fill a column inch

116
00:05:06,517 --> 00:05:07,883
in <i>the</i> newspaper of record.

117
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:10,118
May I have my pastry now?

118
00:05:11,821 --> 00:05:13,855
Pastry on the way.

119
00:05:23,265 --> 00:05:24,732
I thought you could use
another pillow.

120
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,167
I'm sorry. What?

121
00:05:27,235 --> 00:05:29,036
Oh, you're all hunched over.

122
00:05:29,103 --> 00:05:30,471
Oh. Thanks.

123
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:32,440
My pleasure.

124
00:05:33,608 --> 00:05:34,942
I'm sorry.

125
00:05:35,009 --> 00:05:37,845
Do you happen to write
for the "Village Voice"?

126
00:05:37,913 --> 00:05:38,879
I do.

127
00:05:38,947 --> 00:05:39,946
Mike Ruskin.

128
00:05:40,013 --> 00:05:41,714
I recognize your picture
from the column.

129
00:05:41,782 --> 00:05:44,751
What's a Pan Am stewardess doing
reading the "Voice of Bohemia"?

130
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:47,687
Oh, what <i>should</i> I be reading,
the "Ladies' home journal"?

131
00:05:47,755 --> 00:05:49,388
Oh, th...

132
00:05:49,457 --> 00:05:51,724
I'm Maggie.

133
00:05:51,792 --> 00:05:53,526
Pleasure to meet you,
Maggie.

134
00:05:53,594 --> 00:05:56,227
So I take it you're covering
Kennedy's speech?

135
00:05:56,295 --> 00:05:57,729
Yeah, the "voice" thought
it would be worth the dough

136
00:05:57,797 --> 00:05:59,164
to send me in person...

137
00:05:59,231 --> 00:06:02,668
Context, atmosphere,
actual reporting.

138
00:06:02,735 --> 00:06:06,839
Well, most everything is better
in person, don't you think?

139
00:06:06,906 --> 00:06:10,075
I do think.
Uh, are you going?

140
00:06:10,142 --> 00:06:13,210
Dying to, if I could get
a good seat.

141
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:16,647
Oh. Right.

142
00:06:16,715 --> 00:06:19,183
Um, look,
I-I wish I could sneak you

143
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,384
into the press section,
but, uh...

144
00:06:20,452 --> 00:06:22,252
Oh, no, no.
How could you?

145
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,421
But if you're looking
for atmosphere,

146
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:25,556
you should let
me and my girlfriends

147
00:06:25,624 --> 00:06:27,824
show you around Berlin.

148
00:06:29,694 --> 00:06:33,463
<i>Ich bin hier</i>
<i>um ein buch zu kaufen.</i>

149
00:06:33,531 --> 00:06:35,699
<i>Ich bin hier um ein buch</i>
<i>zu kaufen.</i>

150
00:06:35,766 --> 00:06:37,534
<i>Zu... zu... zu kauf...</i>

151
00:06:37,602 --> 00:06:39,803
You've come to buy a book?

152
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:41,805
You speak German.

153
00:06:41,873 --> 00:06:43,272
Here's a tip.

154
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,940
The more you sound like
a barking dog,

155
00:06:45,008 --> 00:06:46,709
the more
they'll understand you.

156
00:06:46,776 --> 00:06:49,778
Do you need a landing card?

157
00:06:49,846 --> 00:06:52,214
Ah. Yes.

158
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,988
Pen?

159
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:05,560
I understand the communists
are hanging red banners

160
00:07:05,628 --> 00:07:07,562
on the Brandenburg Gate.

161
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:10,565
God forbid they allow us
a peek at east Germany.

162
00:07:10,633 --> 00:07:12,600
That seems a little paranoid.

163
00:07:12,668 --> 00:07:13,601
Welcome to Germany.

164
00:07:15,004 --> 00:07:16,269
- Welcome to Germany.
- Thank you very much.

165
00:07:16,337 --> 00:07:18,038
Welcome to Germany.

166
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:20,841
Thank you for flying Pan Am.

167
00:07:20,909 --> 00:07:22,475
Don't make any plans
for tomorrow morning.

168
00:07:22,544 --> 00:07:24,277
We have a date
on the Kurfurstendamm.

169
00:07:24,345 --> 00:07:25,278
What's that?

170
00:07:25,346 --> 00:07:26,312
I have no idea,

171
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,848
but my new friend Mike
wants to go.

172
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:30,684
It's like
the Madison Avenue of Berlin.

173
00:07:30,752 --> 00:07:31,684
You want to come?

174
00:07:31,752 --> 00:07:32,985
Oh, I would love to,

175
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:35,254
but... I'm... I'm meeting
a friend of my own.

176
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:36,822
Oh, okay.

177
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:39,058
Well, then do you want to meet
up for the president's speech?

178
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,594
Absolutely. It's a date.

180
00:08:17,829 --> 00:08:19,629
Thanks.

181
00:08:20,864 --> 00:08:21,931
Are you okay?

182
00:08:21,999 --> 00:08:24,500
Yeah, I'm fine. Thank you.

183
00:08:24,568 --> 00:08:26,002
You sure?

184
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:28,204
No.

185
00:08:29,707 --> 00:08:31,808
I owe you an apology.

186
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:33,542
I didn't mean
to embarrass you.

187
00:08:33,611 --> 00:08:34,911
Well, what...
What are they gonna do?

188
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:36,277
Are they gonna kick us out
of the country?

189
00:08:36,345 --> 00:08:38,614
We're leaving.

190
00:08:39,716 --> 00:08:41,984
It was a terrible mistake.

191
00:08:42,051 --> 00:08:45,621
What,
the party or the singing?

192
00:08:45,688 --> 00:08:48,657
Coming to Berlin...

193
00:08:48,725 --> 00:08:50,859
At all.

194
00:09:02,069 --> 00:09:04,337
It looks like somebody had
a little <i>too</i> much fun in Berlin.

195
00:09:04,404 --> 00:09:06,239
Uh, <i>veni, vidi, vici.</i>

196
00:09:06,306 --> 00:09:09,509
Well, I came, and I saw.
I definitely didn't conquer.

197
00:09:09,576 --> 00:09:11,177
And no one feels sorry
for you.

198
00:09:11,245 --> 00:09:13,379
It wasn't pity
I was looking for.

199
00:09:13,447 --> 00:09:15,115
No kidding.

200
00:09:18,952 --> 00:09:22,054
I'm just gonna go fly
the plane now.

201
00:09:23,556 --> 00:09:24,757
Where is Maggie?

202
00:09:24,824 --> 00:09:27,159
Oh, she's not gonna make it.

203
00:09:27,226 --> 00:09:29,028
What do you mean,
she's not gonna make it?

204
00:09:29,095 --> 00:09:30,029
Is she all right?

205
00:09:30,096 --> 00:09:31,997
Yes. N-no. No.

206
00:09:32,065 --> 00:09:34,766
She's s-sick.
A stomach problem.

207
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:36,634
I mean, a headache.

208
00:09:36,702 --> 00:09:38,369
But I saw her in the concourse
ten minutes ago.

209
00:09:38,436 --> 00:09:39,971
Right, well,
she ate something bad,

210
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:42,273
and it just... it hit her.

211
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,709
Bratwurst, I think.

212
00:09:44,777 --> 00:09:46,644
I thought you said
she had a headache.

213
00:09:46,712 --> 00:09:48,579
Okay, I don't understand.

214
00:09:48,647 --> 00:09:52,115
Where is Maggie right now?

215
00:10:10,851 --> 00:10:12,652
<i>Today...</i>

216
00:10:12,719 --> 00:10:14,253
<i>In the world of freedom...</i>

217
00:10:15,355 --> 00:10:17,623
<i>The proudest boast is,</i>

218
00:10:17,691 --> 00:10:19,791
"Ich bin ein Berliner."

219
00:10:19,859 --> 00:10:22,494
<i>Flight time to New York</i>
<i>tonight will be just under</i>

220
00:10:22,562 --> 00:10:23,728
seven hours.

221
00:10:23,796 --> 00:10:25,964
Still, I hope you enjoyed
your time in Berlin,

222
00:10:26,031 --> 00:10:27,799
and I don't mind speaking
for myself

223
00:10:27,867 --> 00:10:29,468
and our entire flight crew,

224
00:10:29,535 --> 00:10:32,804
when I say that this was
quite a day for us.

225
00:10:32,872 --> 00:10:35,773
That will be one
for the history books.

226
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:39,109
What?

227
00:10:39,177 --> 00:10:41,044
You're voting for Kennedy
in '64, aren't you?

228
00:10:42,481 --> 00:10:44,381
I'm going to kill Maggie.

229
00:10:44,449 --> 00:10:46,650
Time for us to start
watering down drinks.

230
00:10:46,718 --> 00:10:49,186
And plan on how
we are going to kill Maggie.

231
00:10:49,253 --> 00:10:51,254
Are you girls having
a party back here?

232
00:10:51,322 --> 00:10:52,321
We're a stewardess short

233
00:10:52,389 --> 00:10:53,857
on a plane
full of drunk journalists.

234
00:10:53,924 --> 00:10:57,560
Oh, Maggie stuck it to me, too.
She stole my cigars.

235
00:10:57,628 --> 00:10:59,212
You know how I like to stock
up on Cubans in Berlin.

236
00:10:59,864 --> 00:11:01,998
"Ich bin ein Berliner."

237
00:11:02,065 --> 00:11:04,100
See? Right there.
He said, "I'm a Berliner."

238
00:11:04,167 --> 00:11:06,703
No, in German a <i>Berliner</i> is
a jelly doughnut.

239
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:09,070
He did not say,
"I am a jelly doughnut."

240
00:11:09,138 --> 00:11:11,072
Check
your German dictionary.

241
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,708
Hey, before you go,

242
00:11:12,775 --> 00:11:14,042
I just gotta ask.

243
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:15,243
What?

244
00:11:15,311 --> 00:11:17,145
Did Maggie pull it off?

245
00:11:18,848 --> 00:11:20,382
It's like the 4th of July.

246
00:11:20,449 --> 00:11:21,717
On another planet.

247
00:11:21,784 --> 00:11:25,285
This is another planet.
"Deutschland Uber Alles."

248
00:11:25,353 --> 00:11:26,954
"The edge
of a new frontier."

249
00:11:27,022 --> 00:11:28,222
Oh, you're quoting him now?

250
00:11:28,289 --> 00:11:29,223
Who?

251
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:30,658
Kennedy. What...

252
00:11:30,726 --> 00:11:32,292
You're in love with him,
aren't you?

253
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,795
Ask what you can do
for your country.

254
00:11:34,863 --> 00:11:37,431
Uh, I know what I can't do...

255
00:11:37,499 --> 00:11:39,933
Get you seats
in the press section.

256
00:11:40,001 --> 00:11:42,636
What if I slip you into
first class on the way home?

257
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:44,437
Can we do that?

258
00:11:44,505 --> 00:11:47,140
Extra roast beef,
unlimited liquor.

259
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:49,142
Come on, Michael.

260
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,912
What's it gonna take?

261
00:11:51,979 --> 00:11:53,112
Besides that.

262
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,814
It's Mike,
a-and you're not press.

263
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:58,417
Who cares?
Just say that I am.

264
00:11:58,484 --> 00:11:59,952
I'll help you
with your article.

265
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,854
The new frontier?

266
00:12:01,922 --> 00:12:03,956
Hopes and dreams in the "Village Voice"?

267
00:12:04,024 --> 00:12:05,223
Well, what do you need,

268
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:08,460
the smart, countercultural,
antiestablishment take?

269
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:09,762
Smart would help.

270
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:12,764
So Kennedy will come to Berlin
to make a speech, sure,

271
00:12:12,831 --> 00:12:15,332
but it's not like
he's knocking down the wall.

272
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,702
Wait. Maggie, you don't
really think that.

273
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,904
No, but his readers might,

274
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:21,505
and it's not like
you can go wrong

275
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,275
telling people <i>exactly</i>
what they want to hear.

276
00:12:24,342 --> 00:12:26,110
Ah, so you're a politician now?

277
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:29,746
I'm whatever I need to be.

278
00:12:30,949 --> 00:12:34,051
The line about
knocking it over...

279
00:12:34,118 --> 00:12:35,686
I could maybe use that.

280
00:12:49,366 --> 00:12:51,134
<i>Sind sie die amerikanerin?</i>

281
00:12:51,202 --> 00:12:52,868
Pardon?

282
00:12:52,936 --> 00:12:54,337
<i>Sind sie hier</i>
<i>um das buch zu kaufen?</i>

283
00:12:54,405 --> 00:12:57,307
Uh, <i>ich bin hier</i>
<i>u-um ein...</i>

284
00:12:57,374 --> 00:12:58,874
No, I-I'm here to buy
a book.

285
00:12:58,942 --> 00:12:59,976
<i>Los, steig ein!</i>

286
00:13:00,043 --> 00:13:02,177
What? N-no.

287
00:13:02,245 --> 00:13:03,345
<i>"Der wille zur macht,"</i>
Nietzsche.

288
00:13:03,413 --> 00:13:04,680
- I have it, okay?
- I have your book.

289
00:13:04,748 --> 00:13:06,215
Get in the car.

290
00:13:06,282 --> 00:13:08,383
<i>Schnell! Steig ins auto!</i>

291
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,822
Wait.

292
00:13:17,493 --> 00:13:18,526
I was supposed
to buy this book

293
00:13:18,594 --> 00:13:20,328
in the... I-in the store.

294
00:13:20,395 --> 00:13:22,230
I know.
I couldn't make the drop.

295
00:13:22,297 --> 00:13:23,531
What happened?

296
00:13:23,599 --> 00:13:26,434
STASI, the secret police...
They infiltrated my network.

297
00:13:26,502 --> 00:13:27,869
The STASI are
in West Berlin?

298
00:13:27,937 --> 00:13:30,705
They were just at our hostel.
They know who I am.

299
00:13:30,773 --> 00:13:33,073
Then they know your car.

300
00:13:33,141 --> 00:13:35,976
Pull over.

301
00:13:40,982 --> 00:13:42,983
Uh, wait. Wait, wait.

302
00:13:43,051 --> 00:13:45,452
What are you doing?
Come back!

303
00:13:48,822 --> 00:13:50,723
Come on!

304
00:13:56,997 --> 00:13:58,597
Now what?

305
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:00,432
Now what?

306
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,668
Where do we go?

307
00:14:01,735 --> 00:14:02,669
You're asking me?

308
00:14:02,736 --> 00:14:04,103
You're CIA, right?

309
00:14:04,171 --> 00:14:06,471
No. No. Y-yes.
I mean, I'm just...

310
00:14:06,539 --> 00:14:07,673
I was just supposed
to buy this book

311
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,474
and bring it back
to New York.

312
00:14:11,443 --> 00:14:13,078
I'm a courier.

313
00:14:13,146 --> 00:14:16,614
So am I.
I'm just a translator.

314
00:14:16,683 --> 00:14:18,283
I crossed the border
with an east German journalist

315
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:19,450
for this speech.

316
00:14:19,518 --> 00:14:21,318
This is
my third assignment.

317
00:14:21,386 --> 00:14:23,087
This is my second.

318
00:14:26,357 --> 00:14:28,926
We have to keep moving.

319
00:14:30,528 --> 00:14:31,862
I can't go back.

320
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:33,197
If they find me,
they'll kill me.

321
00:14:33,264 --> 00:14:36,133
Okay, you get out of town...
Uh, a bus, a train.

322
00:14:36,201 --> 00:14:37,466
And go where?

323
00:14:37,534 --> 00:14:39,368
Berlin is surrounded by east Germany.

324
00:14:39,436 --> 00:14:42,305
Uh... uh, the embassy.

325
00:14:42,372 --> 00:14:43,539
We can get you
to the U.S. embassy.

326
00:14:43,607 --> 00:14:44,540
There is no embassy!

327
00:14:44,608 --> 00:14:46,609
Oh, no, no, no.
I mean, uh, the mission.

328
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:47,610
You... you go
to the U.S. mission.

329
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:48,678
You go there.

330
00:14:48,746 --> 00:14:50,613
- You can defect.
- Your president is here.

331
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:52,582
No east German will get past security.

332
00:14:54,283 --> 00:14:56,819
That's them,
the secret police.

333
00:15:01,557 --> 00:15:03,992
Ohh.
I don't know what to do.

334
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:08,319
Why didn't you keep
the taxi you came in?

335
00:15:08,345 --> 00:15:10,179
What? There are no taxis.
I had to walk.

336
00:15:10,563 --> 00:15:12,398
There will be a bus here
in, like, five minutes.

337
00:15:12,465 --> 00:15:14,066
How many people are going
to this speech?

338
00:15:14,134 --> 00:15:17,770
Um, some random number
between 100,000 and a million.

339
00:15:17,838 --> 00:15:18,971
Is that your expert opinion?

340
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,406
Crowd counts
are meaningless.

341
00:15:20,473 --> 00:15:22,108
Tell you what. You pick
the number. I'll print it.

342
00:15:22,176 --> 00:15:24,375
100,002.

343
00:15:25,611 --> 00:15:26,978
I'm not very ambitious.

344
00:15:27,046 --> 00:15:32,717
Uh-huh.
Oh, before I forget...

345
00:15:32,785 --> 00:15:35,187
Ohh. Thank you.

346
00:15:35,254 --> 00:15:37,189
It's my pleasure,
Maggie, really,

347
00:15:37,256 --> 00:15:39,057
but I didn't have a choice,
did I?

348
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:41,058
Of course you did, Michael.

349
00:15:44,196 --> 00:15:46,130
What's that?

350
00:15:46,198 --> 00:15:47,731
That's
the president's itinerary.

351
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:48,899
Do you have one?

352
00:15:48,967 --> 00:15:51,836
Uh, "Village Voice,"
remember?

353
00:15:51,903 --> 00:15:53,070
Hey.

354
00:15:53,138 --> 00:15:54,238
Hi there.

355
00:15:54,306 --> 00:15:56,272
Did you just pickpocket me?

356
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,307
- No.
- Yes.

357
00:15:57,374 --> 00:15:59,209
Artful Dodger,
meet George Manchester.

358
00:15:59,276 --> 00:16:00,210
Oh, we've already met.

359
00:16:00,277 --> 00:16:02,345
Maggie Ryan
from your flight over.

360
00:16:02,412 --> 00:16:03,646
The stewardess.

361
00:16:03,714 --> 00:16:05,648
Maggie's a little obsessed
with the president.

362
00:16:05,716 --> 00:16:07,650
Well, there's a party
for him at the U.S. mission.

363
00:16:07,718 --> 00:16:08,751
Need a date?

364
00:16:08,819 --> 00:16:10,286
Hey, I just got you
a press pass.

365
00:16:10,354 --> 00:16:12,020
It's invitation only.

366
00:16:12,088 --> 00:16:13,421
Maybe if I bring
a couple girls,

367
00:16:13,489 --> 00:16:16,258
like getting into a nightclub
in the city?

368
00:16:17,693 --> 00:16:19,594
That would work?

369
00:16:19,662 --> 00:16:22,097
There are certain things
about Kennedy...

370
00:16:22,165 --> 00:16:26,001
That are not to be shared
with the civilian population.

371
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:28,469
Oh, come on.

372
00:16:28,536 --> 00:16:31,739
The other girls...
Would they be stewardesses?

373
00:16:34,609 --> 00:16:35,568
<i>Smuggling an asset...</i>

374
00:16:35,569 --> 00:16:37,345
<i>That's a bit above your
pay grade now, isn't it?</i>

375
00:16:37,412 --> 00:16:39,180
Her cover has been blown.

376
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:42,850
She has no other options.
She needs to defect.

377
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:44,518
She wants to defect.

378
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:47,120
17 million east Germans
want to defect.

379
00:16:47,188 --> 00:16:49,289
That's what the wall is for.

380
00:16:49,357 --> 00:16:50,824
Yeah,
but she works for our side.

381
00:16:50,892 --> 00:16:52,593
As a low-level courier.

382
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,428
<i>I</i> am a low-level courier.

383
00:16:54,496 --> 00:16:56,897
We're not going to risk
our entire east German operation

384
00:16:56,964 --> 00:16:58,265
for someone
who can be replaced

385
00:16:58,332 --> 00:17:00,833
by a 15-year-old
with a bicycle.

386
00:17:00,901 --> 00:17:03,235
Is that
what you think of me?

387
00:17:03,303 --> 00:17:04,871
Let it go, miss Cameron.

388
00:17:04,938 --> 00:17:06,506
She could be killed.

389
00:17:06,573 --> 00:17:08,608
That's not your problem.

390
00:17:10,377 --> 00:17:11,977
What did he say?

391
00:17:12,045 --> 00:17:13,846
He's working on something.

392
00:17:18,384 --> 00:17:20,585
- Hey there.
- Hey, captain.

393
00:17:20,653 --> 00:17:23,288
Have you been outside yet?
It's a madhouse.

394
00:17:23,355 --> 00:17:25,056
That's a fancy envelope.

395
00:17:25,124 --> 00:17:27,258
Well, it's a fancy party.

396
00:17:27,326 --> 00:17:29,528
Gotta do the old grip and grin
at the U.S. mission...

397
00:17:29,595 --> 00:17:31,663
You know, butter up some
German government officials,

398
00:17:31,731 --> 00:17:34,565
so Pan Am can expand
their Berlin hub.

399
00:17:34,633 --> 00:17:36,834
I'll never understand
why rich folk love to make

400
00:17:36,902 --> 00:17:40,071
small talk with people
they're never gonna meet again.

401
00:17:43,075 --> 00:17:45,209
Sorry.
I didn't mean to offend.

402
00:17:45,277 --> 00:17:46,377
No, no. You didn't.

403
00:17:46,445 --> 00:17:48,179
Your ancestors probably
danced at Versailles.

404
00:17:48,247 --> 00:17:49,346
No.

405
00:17:49,414 --> 00:17:50,347
Come on. What were they?

406
00:17:50,415 --> 00:17:52,182
- No.
- Barons, counts, dukes?

407
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,516
- No. I don't know.
- Or just... so you're the...

408
00:17:53,584 --> 00:17:55,185
You're the great-great-great
granddaughter of Louis the...

409
00:17:55,253 --> 00:17:57,220
No, no.
I didn't have any family.

410
00:17:58,856 --> 00:17:59,856
None?

411
00:18:12,869 --> 00:18:14,670
So how old were you

412
00:18:14,737 --> 00:18:17,639
when the Nazis occupied
France?

413
00:18:20,377 --> 00:18:22,710
I was 3.

414
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:27,582
But I don't think about it
most of the time.

415
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:29,417
Everyone lost people.

416
00:18:29,485 --> 00:18:31,719
We were all the same.

417
00:18:33,622 --> 00:18:36,424
I wasn't a special case.

418
00:18:40,528 --> 00:18:44,631
Kate, are you there?

419
00:18:44,699 --> 00:18:46,900
We have to leave now,
if we want to see the speech.

420
00:18:46,968 --> 00:18:48,035
Laura, I'm sorry.

421
00:18:48,103 --> 00:18:49,303
Uh, you're gonna have
to go without me.

422
00:18:49,371 --> 00:18:51,138
What? Why?

423
00:18:51,206 --> 00:18:53,606
Would you...

424
00:18:53,673 --> 00:18:56,575
Yeah, just hold on a second.

425
00:18:56,643 --> 00:18:58,411
You should go.

426
00:18:58,479 --> 00:18:59,412
Hello.

427
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,679
Isn't it time to leave?

428
00:19:00,747 --> 00:19:01,680
Colette.

429
00:19:01,748 --> 00:19:02,848
You should go.

430
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:04,317
No, I'm staying with you.

431
00:19:04,385 --> 00:19:05,551
Is Laura with you?

432
00:19:05,619 --> 00:19:08,954
No. Go, or they'll know
something's wrong.

433
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:11,623
Kate?

434
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:14,259
Uh... yes.
We're coming right down.

435
00:19:15,828 --> 00:19:18,230
Okay, um, you wait here,

436
00:19:18,297 --> 00:19:19,931
and I will be back as soon
as I can.

437
00:19:19,999 --> 00:19:21,799
What kind of something?

438
00:19:21,867 --> 00:19:22,834
Kate?

439
00:19:22,902 --> 00:19:24,503
Laura, I'm...
I'm coming now.

440
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:25,702
I'm sorry. What?

441
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:27,838
What kind of something are
they working on?

442
00:19:27,906 --> 00:19:31,509
Um, I don't know.
He didn't say.

443
00:19:31,576 --> 00:19:33,944
Did they teach you to lie?

444
00:19:34,012 --> 00:19:36,547
'Cause you're not very good
at it.

445
00:19:49,626 --> 00:19:51,461
Um, I-I think they went
this way!

446
00:19:51,529 --> 00:19:53,729
We have to stay together,
or we'll lose each other!

447
00:19:53,797 --> 00:19:55,532
Whoa.

448
00:19:59,602 --> 00:20:00,536
This is nuts.

449
00:20:00,603 --> 00:20:02,071
Which way should we go?

450
00:20:02,138 --> 00:20:03,572
All I can see are shirts!

451
00:20:03,639 --> 00:20:06,308
Ted, do you think all
the streets are this way?

452
00:20:06,376 --> 00:20:07,976
Ted, what are you doing?

453
00:20:08,044 --> 00:20:08,977
Scouting.

454
00:20:09,045 --> 00:20:10,379
You look like gene Kelly!

455
00:20:10,447 --> 00:20:12,814
Good thing it's not raining!

456
00:20:12,882 --> 00:20:14,182
Good thing he's not singing.

457
00:20:16,118 --> 00:20:17,818
Do you want the bad news
or the bad news?

458
00:20:17,886 --> 00:20:19,520
<i>Sind sie amerikaner?</i>

459
00:20:19,588 --> 00:20:21,155
- What?
<i>- Amerikaner?</i>

460
00:20:21,223 --> 00:20:22,656
Oh, yes. We're Americans.

461
00:20:22,724 --> 00:20:25,259
<i>Wir</i> lieben <i>euch.</i>
<i>Wir</i> lieben <i>die amerikaner.</i>

462
00:20:25,327 --> 00:20:26,360
Kennedy!

463
00:20:26,428 --> 00:20:27,928
<i>Danke. Danke.</i>

464
00:20:27,996 --> 00:20:29,296
<i>Wollen sie ihn siehen?</i>

465
00:20:29,363 --> 00:20:31,565
Uh...
Uh, <i>konnen sie uns helfen?</i>

466
00:20:31,632 --> 00:20:33,433
<i>Ich bringe sie hin.</i>

467
00:20:33,501 --> 00:20:34,867
Oh.
<i>Kommen. Kommen.</i>

468
00:20:34,935 --> 00:20:37,370
Ted, look! Come on, let's go!
Ted, get down from there!

469
00:20:37,438 --> 00:20:39,473
Oh.

470
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,807
Ted, let's go!

471
00:20:40,874 --> 00:20:41,908
All right!

472
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:58,624
<i>Kommen sie.</i>

473
00:20:58,691 --> 00:20:59,992
<i>Eine bessere auf sicht...</i>

474
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:01,059
Oh.

475
00:21:01,127 --> 00:21:04,129
<i>Kommen sie. So sicht.</i>

476
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:07,064
<i>Kommen sie.</i>

477
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:24,814
<i>I am proud to come to this city</i>

478
00:21:24,882 --> 00:21:27,651
<i>as the guest</i>
<i>of your distinguished mayor</i>

479
00:21:27,718 --> 00:21:29,019
<i>who has...</i>

480
00:21:29,086 --> 00:21:31,321
Oh, he started. He started!

481
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:39,462
<i>There are many people</i>
<i>in the world...</i>

482
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:42,231
Kate! Kate!
Colette!

483
00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:43,232
I'll meet you up there!

484
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,233
<i>Or say they don't...</i>

485
00:21:44,301 --> 00:21:45,234
Kate!

486
00:21:45,302 --> 00:21:47,603
<i>What is the great issue</i>

487
00:21:47,671 --> 00:21:51,206
<i>between the free world</i>
<i>and the communist world.</i>

488
00:21:53,543 --> 00:21:55,143
<i>Let them come to Berlin.</i>

489
00:21:56,812 --> 00:21:58,946
<i>No, no, no!</i>

490
00:22:06,354 --> 00:22:08,088
<i>No, no, no!</i>

491
00:22:14,546 --> 00:22:15,980
Okay!
Aah!

492
00:22:16,048 --> 00:22:18,449
Not gonna lose you now.

493
00:22:18,516 --> 00:22:20,350
<i>Today in the world</i>
<i>of freedom...</i>

494
00:22:20,418 --> 00:22:21,719
<i>Kommen sie. Schnell.</i>

495
00:22:21,787 --> 00:22:23,054
<i>The proudest boast is...</i>

496
00:22:23,121 --> 00:22:24,588
<i>Kommen sie. Kommen sie.
</i> <i>Schnell.</i> Ohh.

497
00:22:24,655 --> 00:22:26,089
"Ich bin ein Berliner."

498
00:22:29,961 --> 00:22:31,595
<i>Kommen sie. Schnell.</i>
<i>Kommen sie.</i>

499
00:22:31,662 --> 00:22:34,263
<i>Hier. Kommen sie. Hier.</i>
<i>Schnell, schnell, schnell.</i>

500
00:22:34,331 --> 00:22:35,431
Thank you.

501
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:44,073
<i>Freedom has many difficulties,</i>

502
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:48,543
<i>and democracy is not perfect,</i>

503
00:22:48,612 --> 00:22:50,679
<i>but we have never had
to put a wall up</i>

504
00:22:50,747 --> 00:22:52,715
<i>to keep our people in,</i>

505
00:22:52,782 --> 00:22:54,483
<i>to prevent them
from leaving us.</i>

506
00:22:57,486 --> 00:23:02,256
<i>Though a city
that has been besieged</i>

507
00:23:02,324 --> 00:23:04,225
<i>for 18 years</i>

508
00:23:04,292 --> 00:23:09,463
<i>that still lives
with the vitality and the force</i>

509
00:23:09,531 --> 00:23:12,166
<i>and the hope
and the determination</i>

510
00:23:12,234 --> 00:23:13,800
<i>of the city of West Berlin.</i>

511
00:23:18,873 --> 00:23:20,741
<i>While the wall</i>

512
00:23:20,808 --> 00:23:26,412
<i>is the most obvious
and vivid demonstration</i>

513
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,414
<i>of the failures
of the communist system</i>

514
00:23:29,482 --> 00:23:31,283
<i>for all the world to see,</i>

515
00:23:31,351 --> 00:23:34,453
<i>we take no satisfaction in it,</i>

516
00:23:34,521 --> 00:23:40,026
<i>for it is an offense
not only against history,</i>

517
00:23:40,093 --> 00:23:42,695
<i>but an offense
against humanity...</i>

518
00:23:42,763 --> 00:23:44,929
<i>Separating families,</i>

519
00:23:44,997 --> 00:23:49,500
<i>dividing husbands and wives
and brothers and sisters,</i>

520
00:23:49,568 --> 00:23:54,005
<i>and dividing a people who wish
to be joined together.</i>

521
00:23:58,277 --> 00:23:59,210
Kate!

522
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:01,211
Where is everyone?

523
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:02,212
I don't know.

524
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,213
When are they getting bac?

525
00:24:03,281 --> 00:24:04,214
I don't know!

526
00:24:04,282 --> 00:24:05,215
Will you stand still
a second?

527
00:24:05,283 --> 00:24:06,249
What do you want?

528
00:24:06,317 --> 00:24:07,718
We're going to a party
for Kennedy.

529
00:24:07,786 --> 00:24:09,219
Ohh. Why?

530
00:24:09,287 --> 00:24:10,954
Because he's the president!

531
00:24:11,022 --> 00:24:13,023
I just want
to shake his hand.

532
00:24:13,091 --> 00:24:14,892
It's at the U.S. embassy.

533
00:24:14,959 --> 00:24:16,226
The mission.

534
00:24:16,294 --> 00:24:18,661
Kennedy loves stewardesses.

535
00:24:18,729 --> 00:24:20,129
I figure,
if we go as a group,

536
00:24:20,197 --> 00:24:22,398
we have a pretty good chance
of getting in.

537
00:24:22,465 --> 00:24:24,033
Uh, we fly out tonight.

538
00:24:24,101 --> 00:24:26,468
Uh, we should all go
in our uniforms.

539
00:24:26,536 --> 00:24:27,904
What? No!

540
00:24:27,971 --> 00:24:29,572
I'm not wearing my work clothes
to meet Jack Kennedy.

541
00:24:29,639 --> 00:24:31,407
You said that
he likes stewardesses.

542
00:24:31,474 --> 00:24:33,575
No, this is my plan.
You are not going to...

543
00:24:33,642 --> 00:24:37,079
Maggie, he likes stewardesses.
Let's show him stewardesses.

544
00:24:37,146 --> 00:24:39,815
We're Pan Am,

545
00:24:39,882 --> 00:24:42,217
and who can turn down
Pan Am?

546
00:24:42,284 --> 00:24:44,753
See if you can convince
the others.

547
00:24:48,057 --> 00:24:49,656
Anke.

548
00:24:49,725 --> 00:24:52,159
I found someone who will
smuggle me across the border.

549
00:24:52,227 --> 00:24:54,795
Uh, does he have papers for you,
uh, forged identification?

550
00:24:54,863 --> 00:24:56,130
I'll be hiding in his trunk.

551
00:24:56,198 --> 00:24:57,832
- No.
- I can't stay here.

552
00:24:57,899 --> 00:24:59,700
That's a terrible plan.

553
00:24:59,768 --> 00:25:00,835
I have no choice.

554
00:25:00,902 --> 00:25:04,271
Yes, you do.
I can get you out.

555
00:25:04,339 --> 00:25:05,972
How?

556
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:10,343
Perfect.

557
00:25:11,779 --> 00:25:13,146
Wow. We really are alike.

558
00:25:13,214 --> 00:25:15,215
I don't know
if this will work.

559
00:25:15,282 --> 00:25:18,218
There's only one way
to find out.

560
00:25:18,285 --> 00:25:20,620
Let's take her
for a test spin.

561
00:25:23,123 --> 00:25:24,890
Kate.

562
00:25:26,459 --> 00:25:27,793
Oh, hello.

563
00:25:27,861 --> 00:25:29,561
Is this the friend
you were visiting?

564
00:25:29,629 --> 00:25:30,629
Uh, y-yes.

565
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:32,430
This is Greta Mueller,
out of the Berlin hub.

566
00:25:32,498 --> 00:25:34,099
Uh, Greta,
this is my sister Laura

567
00:25:34,167 --> 00:25:35,333
and our friend Colette.

568
00:25:35,401 --> 00:25:36,601
A pleasure.

569
00:25:36,669 --> 00:25:38,102
Arriving or departing?

570
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:41,239
Uh. . Athens. Later.

571
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:42,373
Oh.
Mm.

572
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,741
Oh, guess what?
Maggie's bringing us

573
00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:45,943
to a party for Kennedy
at the U.S. mission.

574
00:25:46,011 --> 00:25:48,479
Tell Colette
that she has to come.

575
00:25:48,546 --> 00:25:51,282
You have to come.
You loved his speech.

576
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:52,449
I did?

577
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:55,685
Well, I-I saw you crying
while listening to it.

578
00:25:58,156 --> 00:26:00,824
No, I wanted to catch a nap
before we fly out.

579
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:02,159
A nap?

580
00:26:02,226 --> 00:26:06,329
This is history... the time we met
the president in Berlin?

581
00:26:06,397 --> 00:26:09,198
He's not my president.

582
00:26:09,266 --> 00:26:11,767
The truth is,
is we need you.

583
00:26:11,835 --> 00:26:13,169
The bigger the group,

584
00:26:13,236 --> 00:26:15,271
the better chance we have
of getting in.

585
00:26:15,338 --> 00:26:16,438
You're all going?

586
00:26:16,506 --> 00:26:20,209
Yes. Oh, and Maggie wants us
to wear our uniforms.

587
00:26:20,277 --> 00:26:22,878
Oh, uh, I think
the dry cleaning ate mine.

588
00:26:22,946 --> 00:26:24,013
Oh, no.

589
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,780
Do you have a spare jacket?

590
00:26:25,848 --> 00:26:29,350
How did the hotel lose
your shoes, too?

591
00:26:29,418 --> 00:26:32,053
I just left them outside
my door for a shine.

592
00:26:32,121 --> 00:26:34,122
So much
for German efficiency.

593
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:35,190
All right.

594
00:26:35,257 --> 00:26:36,157
They're checking guests
at the door.

595
00:26:36,225 --> 00:26:38,226
Put on
your best Pan Am, girls.

596
00:26:38,294 --> 00:26:41,428
Excuse us. Sorry.
<i>Entschuldigen sie.</i>

597
00:26:41,495 --> 00:26:42,930
Okay, as soon as you get in,

598
00:26:42,997 --> 00:26:45,899
wel l find you a case officer
or a state department official.

599
00:26:45,967 --> 00:26:48,869
But remember, you're having fun, so...
smile.

600
00:26:48,937 --> 00:26:50,270
Sorry we kept you waiting.

601
00:26:50,338 --> 00:26:51,939
The crowds...
Worse than New York.

602
00:26:52,006 --> 00:26:53,040
We're here
as representatives

603
00:26:53,107 --> 00:26:56,109
of Juan trippe
and the airline, Pan Am.

604
00:26:56,177 --> 00:26:57,109
Name?

605
00:26:57,177 --> 00:27:00,646
P-a-n-a-m.

606
00:27:00,714 --> 00:27:02,315
Stewardesses.

607
00:27:02,382 --> 00:27:04,016
How did you make it past
the front gate?

608
00:27:04,084 --> 00:27:06,986
<i>"Ich bin ein Berliner,"</i>
right?

609
00:27:07,054 --> 00:27:08,988
Excuse me.

610
00:27:11,225 --> 00:27:14,993
So did you grow up
here in Berlin?

611
00:27:15,061 --> 00:27:16,294
- Mm.
- Oh.

612
00:27:16,362 --> 00:27:19,197
Have you been
to this building before?

613
00:27:19,265 --> 00:27:21,799
Mm-hmm. My Uncle used
to deliver bread here,

614
00:27:21,868 --> 00:27:23,401
before they divided Berlin.

615
00:27:23,469 --> 00:27:25,871
I came with him sometimes.

616
00:27:25,938 --> 00:27:27,906
What was it then?

617
00:27:27,974 --> 00:27:30,407
It's the headquarters
for the German <i>Luftwaffe,</i>

618
00:27:30,475 --> 00:27:32,409
uh, Air Force.

619
00:27:32,477 --> 00:27:35,712
So... do you know
if there's a side door

620
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:38,015
or a back entrance
or something?

621
00:27:38,083 --> 00:27:40,684
What did your parents do
during the war?

622
00:27:40,752 --> 00:27:42,887
What do you mean?

623
00:27:42,954 --> 00:27:45,554
Are they okay?
Did they survive?

624
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:46,756
Yes.

625
00:27:46,823 --> 00:27:49,158
How?

626
00:27:49,226 --> 00:27:50,593
What did they do?

627
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:52,161
Colette.

628
00:27:52,229 --> 00:27:54,697
We don't like to talk
about the war.

629
00:27:54,765 --> 00:27:58,001
But you delivered bread here,
to the <i>Luftwaffe.</i>

630
00:27:58,068 --> 00:28:00,370
We had a family bakery,
that's all.

631
00:28:00,437 --> 00:28:02,537
That delivered bread
to the Nazis.

632
00:28:02,605 --> 00:28:04,373
Colette.

633
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,575
There's Dean. Dean!

634
00:28:07,643 --> 00:28:08,676
- Over here!
- Hey, girls.

635
00:28:10,646 --> 00:28:12,414
We're with him.

636
00:28:13,482 --> 00:28:15,350
Dean! We came to meet you.

637
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:36,064
I'm sorry about that.

638
00:28:47,909 --> 00:28:49,743
George Manchester.

639
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:52,646
He knows everyone
and hates communists.

640
00:28:54,849 --> 00:28:57,618
I can't do this part
with you,

641
00:28:57,686 --> 00:28:59,752
but tell him that you're
an east German asset

642
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,153
who needs protection,

643
00:29:01,222 --> 00:29:03,323
and he can get you
to the right people.

644
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:05,825
I'm shaking.

645
00:29:05,892 --> 00:29:07,327
You have gotten this far.

646
00:29:10,063 --> 00:29:11,564
Thank you.

647
00:29:11,632 --> 00:29:13,566
Go.

648
00:29:14,634 --> 00:29:15,567
Anke.

649
00:29:16,281 --> 00:29:18,582
Smile.

650
00:29:56,186 --> 00:29:57,487
Dean, have you seen
the president?

651
00:29:57,555 --> 00:29:59,322
Uh, I only got
a brief glimpse.

652
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:00,356
Where is he?

653
00:30:00,425 --> 00:30:01,558
He's come and gone.

654
00:30:01,626 --> 00:30:03,559
Apparently he had
a whole circuit lined up.

655
00:30:03,627 --> 00:30:04,693
What?!

656
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:05,694
I'm sure he would have
loved to meet you,

657
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:06,829
but he's got a lot going on.

658
00:30:06,897 --> 00:30:07,963
Well, when did he leave?

659
00:30:08,031 --> 00:30:09,665
Just now.
Like, a minute ago.

660
00:30:09,733 --> 00:30:10,733
Which way did he go?

661
00:30:10,801 --> 00:30:12,435
Maggie,
I'm not in charge here.

662
00:30:15,171 --> 00:30:18,340
Excuse me.
Excuse me!

663
00:30:24,914 --> 00:30:27,615
- You can't go out this way!
- Hold these!

664
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:37,325
Stop!

665
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:46,443
New friends or old friends?

666
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,478
Yeah, Colette,
this... this is, uh, Otto...

667
00:30:48,547 --> 00:30:51,214
Rontegen...
The German Aviation Authority.

668
00:30:51,282 --> 00:30:53,482
And, uh, Peter Newberry...
U.S. State Department.

669
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:56,318
Ah, the international
Pan Am stewardess.

670
00:30:56,386 --> 00:30:58,755
That is me.
<i>Guten tag.</i>

671
00:30:58,822 --> 00:31:00,423
<i>Guten abend.</i>

672
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:03,392
Didn't you say you were
flying out tonight?

673
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:05,261
Oh, it's a special occasion.

674
00:31:05,328 --> 00:31:07,096
A glass of champagne's not gonna hurt.
Uh... no.

675
00:31:07,164 --> 00:31:08,997
Ah.
It's a very special occasion.

676
00:31:09,066 --> 00:31:10,166
<i>Noch einen, bitte.</i>

677
00:31:11,501 --> 00:31:14,103
<i>Ich muss</i>
<i>meinen kummer ertranken.</i>

678
00:31:14,171 --> 00:31:16,004
You speak German very well.

679
00:31:16,073 --> 00:31:18,407
I was forced to learn
when I was a child.

680
00:31:22,546 --> 00:31:25,113
But that is water
under the bridge,

681
00:31:25,181 --> 00:31:28,483
now that the Germans
and Americans are best friends.

682
00:31:28,551 --> 00:31:30,651
We do share a common enemy.

683
00:31:30,719 --> 00:31:31,652
Mm.

684
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,488
Convenient, is it not?

685
00:31:33,556 --> 00:31:36,891
That's politics, right?

686
00:31:36,959 --> 00:31:39,026
Politics?
No, it's a miracle.

687
00:31:39,095 --> 00:31:41,495
One clever speech
by your president,

688
00:31:41,563 --> 00:31:45,832
and the whole nation is
instantly absolved.

689
00:31:47,435 --> 00:31:48,735
Excuse us, gentlemen.

690
00:31:48,803 --> 00:31:51,071
We, uh, need to prep
for our flight.

691
00:31:51,139 --> 00:31:52,772
I'm sorry.
Did I spoil your party?

692
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,175
I meant, congratulations.

693
00:31:58,178 --> 00:31:59,912
I'm sorry.

694
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,347
Let me make it up to you.

695
00:33:51,117 --> 00:33:54,486
I thought I was clear
on the phone.

696
00:33:54,554 --> 00:33:57,556
You were.
I just didn't agree.

697
00:33:57,624 --> 00:33:59,991
Well, it's not your place
to disagree.

698
00:34:00,059 --> 00:34:01,860
You do what you're told.

699
00:34:01,928 --> 00:34:03,696
So you're saying
to just follow orders?

700
00:34:03,763 --> 00:34:04,697
Yes.

701
00:34:04,764 --> 00:34:06,198
You're actually saying
that here?

702
00:34:06,265 --> 00:34:08,466
This is how wars are won.

703
00:34:08,534 --> 00:34:11,569
Do you have any idea how many
people have risked their lives,

704
00:34:11,637 --> 00:34:13,205
so that you could carry
that book?

705
00:34:13,272 --> 00:34:14,706
I know that she did,

706
00:34:14,774 --> 00:34:16,574
and I know that
she was going to be killed

707
00:34:16,642 --> 00:34:17,743
for trying to help us.

708
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:18,877
How do you know
she wasn't lying?

709
00:34:18,945 --> 00:34:19,911
She wasn't.

710
00:34:19,979 --> 00:34:21,478
Mm.

711
00:34:21,546 --> 00:34:24,348
I just heard my president
promise the 2 million people

712
00:34:24,415 --> 00:34:26,316
in this city that
we wouldn't abandon them.

713
00:34:26,384 --> 00:34:28,919
You brought an East German spy
to an American consulate

714
00:34:28,987 --> 00:34:30,487
in your uniform.

715
00:34:30,555 --> 00:34:32,156
I know what I did,

716
00:34:32,224 --> 00:34:33,690
and I take
full responsibility for...

717
00:34:33,759 --> 00:34:38,161
Miss Cameron, you have
no idea what you've done,

718
00:34:38,229 --> 00:34:41,397
nor what it takes to keep
a cold war cold.

719
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:02,124
- You should be proud.
- You got so close.

720
00:35:02,192 --> 00:35:04,994
- Close is nothing.
- Close is meaningless.

721
00:35:05,062 --> 00:35:07,063
You got into the press section.
You got into the mission.

722
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:08,498
You can tell the boys that.

723
00:35:08,566 --> 00:35:09,666
I don't care
what the pilots think.

724
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:12,133
That's not why I...

725
00:35:12,201 --> 00:35:14,536
What is that?

726
00:35:14,604 --> 00:35:17,272
That... is "Air Force One."

727
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:21,076
It's still here.
He's still here!

728
00:35:21,143 --> 00:35:22,410
Ohh!

729
00:35:22,479 --> 00:35:23,879
What are you doing?

730
00:35:23,947 --> 00:35:26,321
Cover for me.
I'm not gonna make our flight.

731
00:35:26,322 --> 00:35:26,915
What?

732
00:35:26,983 --> 00:35:30,651
I'm gonna meet him
right here, right now.

733
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:32,620
Wait!
What do I tell everyone?

734
00:35:32,688 --> 00:35:36,691
Make something up!
Something German!

735
00:35:38,494 --> 00:35:42,062
Wait! Have you seen Ted?
Where's Ted?

736
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:43,197
Why?

737
00:35:43,264 --> 00:35:45,966
He has something I need.

738
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:55,475
You're not on this flight.

739
00:35:55,543 --> 00:35:57,076
What are you doing here,
miss?

740
00:35:57,144 --> 00:35:59,879
My name is Maggie Ryan.

741
00:35:59,946 --> 00:36:01,847
I worked
on Kennedy's campaign.

742
00:36:01,915 --> 00:36:04,783
I logged more hours
than any other volunteer,

743
00:36:04,851 --> 00:36:07,219
and as a reward,
I was supposed to meet him,

744
00:36:07,286 --> 00:36:08,521
but I took a bathroom break

745
00:36:08,588 --> 00:36:11,123
when the deputy field director
came for two minutes,

746
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:14,159
and suddenly Marcia Phillips
was going instead of me

747
00:36:14,227 --> 00:36:17,729
even though she only did
half the hours I did.

748
00:36:17,796 --> 00:36:20,632
I just...
I just wanna thank him

749
00:36:20,699 --> 00:36:24,936
for making me realize that each
of us can make a difference.

750
00:36:26,872 --> 00:36:29,741
I just wanna shake his hand.

751
00:36:29,808 --> 00:36:32,243
Well, you've certainly got
a lot of enthusiasm.

752
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:34,811
Thank you.

753
00:36:34,879 --> 00:36:36,547
But you haven't been vetted.

754
00:36:36,614 --> 00:36:40,084
I'm a Pan Am stewardess.
They vetted me!

755
00:36:40,152 --> 00:36:41,685
I got him cigars!

756
00:36:41,753 --> 00:36:43,454
Cubans!

757
00:36:43,522 --> 00:36:44,855
His favorite.

758
00:36:46,425 --> 00:36:47,591
What?

759
00:36:47,659 --> 00:36:50,226
Cubans... his favorite.

760
00:36:54,031 --> 00:36:56,766
Tell me your name again.

761
00:36:56,833 --> 00:36:59,269
Maggie Ryan.

762
00:36:59,336 --> 00:37:01,471
Okay.

763
00:37:01,539 --> 00:37:04,839
Wait here.

764
00:37:11,081 --> 00:37:14,049
<i>Cigars for the president.
She wants to give them...</i>

765
00:38:04,897 --> 00:38:06,732
Welcome to New York.

766
00:38:06,799 --> 00:38:08,699
- Thank you for flying Pan Am.
- Thank you.

767
00:38:14,507 --> 00:38:16,374
Can't beat that humidity.

768
00:38:18,511 --> 00:38:20,645
Berlin not as entertaining
as you thought it would be?

769
00:38:20,712 --> 00:38:24,015
I took a shot.

770
00:38:24,082 --> 00:38:25,749
Can you blame me?
I mean, look at you.

771
00:38:29,521 --> 00:38:34,358
Let me take you to breakfast
and apologize.

772
00:38:34,425 --> 00:38:37,327
Good night, Mr. Vanderway.

773
00:38:37,395 --> 00:38:39,263
Yeah.

774
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:41,764
Yeah, good night.

775
00:38:41,831 --> 00:38:43,032
You know...

776
00:38:46,336 --> 00:38:49,071
You're different
from other girls.

777
00:38:49,139 --> 00:38:50,906
Thank you.

778
00:38:57,346 --> 00:38:58,280
Hi.

779
00:38:58,347 --> 00:39:00,148
Hi.

780
00:39:00,216 --> 00:39:01,716
You wanna share a cab home?

781
00:39:01,784 --> 00:39:04,386
Oh, I have a couple things
to wrap up at operations.

782
00:39:04,453 --> 00:39:07,021
Is it okay if I meet you there?
Sure.

783
00:39:45,558 --> 00:39:48,093
When the Nazis took over,

784
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,495
my parents made plans
to flee.

785
00:39:52,632 --> 00:39:53,765
They dropped me off
with a neighbor

786
00:39:53,833 --> 00:39:56,501
and promised
they'd come back to get me.

787
00:39:59,339 --> 00:40:01,339
But they never did.

788
00:40:01,406 --> 00:40:04,242
Never could.

789
00:40:06,811 --> 00:40:09,714
And the people who brought us
into the apartment

790
00:40:09,781 --> 00:40:12,750
were so warm...

791
00:40:12,817 --> 00:40:14,719
And magnanimous.

792
00:40:17,655 --> 00:40:20,924
Your president tried so hard
to lift their shame.

793
00:40:26,064 --> 00:40:28,298
But they should feel shame.

794
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:36,438
I came to Germany to forgive.

795
00:40:40,677 --> 00:40:43,846
But I still hate them.

796
00:40:46,416 --> 00:40:48,817
And I don't know how to stop.
