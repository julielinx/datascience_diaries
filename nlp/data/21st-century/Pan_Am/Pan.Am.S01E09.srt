1
00:00:00,803 --> 00:00:02,603
<i>Previously on "Pan Am"...</i>

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:04,520
Look, I get to see the world,
Sam.

3
00:00:04,563 --> 00:00:06,261
When was the last time
you left the village?

4
00:00:06,262 --> 00:00:07,960
I don't need to see the world
to change it.

5
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:11,390
- Marry me!
- I can't say yes now.

6
00:00:11,504 --> 00:00:14,812
Pan Am stewardess can travell all
around the world without suspicion.

7
00:00:14,813 --> 00:00:17,381
You volunteered for this.
They will let you out.

8
00:00:17,415 --> 00:00:18,482
Are you going my way?

9
00:00:18,516 --> 00:00:19,817
Sometimes the stars align.

10
00:00:22,721 --> 00:00:23,821
You're different
from other girls.

11
00:00:23,855 --> 00:00:26,340
Thank you.

12
00:00:26,391 --> 00:00:29,026
And democracy is not perfect.

13
00:00:38,403 --> 00:00:40,504
You're casting a shadow,
Kate.

14
00:00:43,775 --> 00:00:46,243
I take it you missed
the signal?

15
00:00:46,277 --> 00:00:48,379
- Stood me up at the park.
- I didn't miss it.

16
00:00:48,413 --> 00:00:50,313
- Are you gonna invite me in?
- We had our exit interview.

17
00:00:50,331 --> 00:00:52,282
Well, it doesn't work
that way, Kate.

18
00:00:52,316 --> 00:00:55,119
It's like a marriage.
Saying "yes" is the easy part.

19
00:00:56,287 --> 00:00:59,256
Now would be a good time
to invite me in.

20
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:00,691
Nosy neighbors.

21
00:01:03,178 --> 00:01:04,962
I have a job for you.

22
00:01:04,996 --> 00:01:06,463
No.

23
00:01:06,498 --> 00:01:08,999
No more jobs,
no more mysterious packages,

24
00:01:09,033 --> 00:01:10,901
no more betrayals.

25
00:01:10,935 --> 00:01:12,302
I'm going to London.

26
00:01:12,337 --> 00:01:13,303
Just hear me out, Kate.

27
00:01:13,337 --> 00:01:14,772
And if I don't, what?

28
00:01:14,806 --> 00:01:17,941
This time I get dragged away
by the men in trench coats?

29
00:01:19,861 --> 00:01:23,280
There's a dealer in London who's
gotten ahold of a list of names.

30
00:01:23,314 --> 00:01:25,115
CIA assets.

31
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:26,850
He's selling that list
to the Soviets.

32
00:01:26,918 --> 00:01:28,285
I told you, no.

33
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:31,872
All you need to do is deliver
this to your contact in London.

34
00:01:31,906 --> 00:01:34,541
Inside is
a counterfeit list.

35
00:01:34,576 --> 00:01:36,693
Anderson will take care
of the rest.

36
00:01:38,163 --> 00:01:40,130
Anderson.

37
00:01:40,165 --> 00:01:41,598
And what if I refuse?

38
00:01:41,633 --> 00:01:45,135
I'm gonna make this plain
for you, Kate.

39
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:47,771
Your exit from the agency
can go a few different ways...

40
00:01:47,806 --> 00:01:50,507
A simple matter of a little
paperwork and a handshake,

41
00:01:50,542 --> 00:01:52,643
or we can make this
your last mission...

42
00:01:52,677 --> 00:01:54,578
And your last flight.

43
00:01:55,914 --> 00:01:58,615
You would really cost me
my job at Pan Am?

44
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:01,685
I'll do whatever I have to,
to get this done.

45
00:02:03,688 --> 00:02:06,890
Just like you did
with Bridget?

46
00:02:20,404 --> 00:02:22,456
- Here.
- Oh, thank you.

47
00:02:30,431 --> 00:02:31,581
Sam?

48
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:32,749
Hey, Mags, sorry I'm late.

49
00:02:32,784 --> 00:02:33,851
Late for what?

50
00:02:33,885 --> 00:02:35,385
You know, hitting
the Wild Blue Yonder,

51
00:02:35,419 --> 00:02:36,603
crossing the pond.

52
00:02:36,638 --> 00:02:38,272
Chip chip cheerio

53
00:02:38,306 --> 00:02:39,857
and all that rot.

54
00:02:39,891 --> 00:02:41,424
Sam, what are you doing here?

55
00:02:41,442 --> 00:02:43,627
I'm leaving for London
in two hours.

56
00:02:43,661 --> 00:02:46,263
I know. I'm going with you.
Remember?

57
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:49,299
Oh! Hi, Sam.

58
00:02:49,334 --> 00:02:50,701
Laura. Good look.

59
00:02:50,735 --> 00:02:53,070
Think you can
sneak me into first class?

60
00:02:53,104 --> 00:02:54,571
Sam, I...

61
00:02:54,606 --> 00:02:55,739
Do not do this to me,
Maggie.

62
00:02:55,773 --> 00:02:57,457
You promised you'd get me
to London.

63
00:02:57,492 --> 00:02:59,009
What's in London?

64
00:02:59,043 --> 00:03:00,277
The World Atomic Symposium...

65
00:03:00,311 --> 00:03:01,745
Biggest gathering of
death merchants on the planet.

66
00:03:01,779 --> 00:03:04,081
Ban the bomb uk is gonna crash
their little war fest,

67
00:03:04,115 --> 00:03:06,133
and I've got a spot
on the front lines.

68
00:03:06,167 --> 00:03:07,784
How long have...

69
00:03:07,802 --> 00:03:09,419
How long have you been part

70
00:03:09,454 --> 00:03:10,988
of the ban the bomb movement?

71
00:03:11,022 --> 00:03:12,172
Since saving mankind
from extinction

72
00:03:12,223 --> 00:03:13,390
became a moral imperative.

73
00:03:13,424 --> 00:03:14,858
I think that is very noble.

74
00:03:14,893 --> 00:03:17,094
I mean, what could be more
important than saving the world?

75
00:03:17,128 --> 00:03:19,429
- How about saving my job?
- Won't be any job left

76
00:03:19,464 --> 00:03:22,032
when the world winds up
in a pile of radioactive ash.

77
00:03:23,067 --> 00:03:25,652
Come on, Maggie.
You owe me.

78
00:03:36,614 --> 00:03:38,482
Dean?

79
00:03:38,516 --> 00:03:41,651
You better get a move on.
We're flying in two hours.

80
00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:43,370
Is this how it works,

81
00:03:43,421 --> 00:03:45,822
you kiss a girl once
and you become her chauffer?

82
00:03:45,857 --> 00:03:48,525
Actually, it was <i>you</i>
who kissed <i>me.</i>

83
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,260
Oh, then maybe I should
drive <i>you,</i>

84
00:03:50,295 --> 00:03:53,180
which will give you a chance
to put on your uniform.

85
00:03:53,214 --> 00:03:56,850
I said we're flying,

86
00:03:56,884 --> 00:03:58,668
not flying Pan Am.

87
00:03:58,686 --> 00:04:01,905
Well, you said you wanted
to learn.

88
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,140
With these?

89
00:04:03,174 --> 00:04:04,708
Yeah. It's a Stearman PT-17.

90
00:04:04,742 --> 00:04:06,977
Crop duster. Same plane
I learned to fly on.

91
00:04:07,045 --> 00:04:08,912
A crop duster?

92
00:04:10,048 --> 00:04:13,183
<i>You</i> are getting your wings
today.

93
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:19,206
PAN AM
Ep. 09 - Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

94
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,409
Sync and corrected by dr.jackson
for www.addic7ed.com

95
00:04:26,214 --> 00:04:27,547
Who's in first class today?

96
00:04:27,582 --> 00:04:29,032
Earl of Halifax,

97
00:04:29,067 --> 00:04:30,334
two movie stars,

98
00:04:30,368 --> 00:04:32,469
and a United States
congressman.

99
00:04:32,503 --> 00:04:34,371
A congressman? Who?

100
00:04:34,405 --> 00:04:36,039
Oh. Christopher Rawlings.

101
00:04:36,057 --> 00:04:37,758
I hear he's very handsome.

102
00:04:37,809 --> 00:04:39,810
I'm not worried
about how he looks.

103
00:04:39,877 --> 00:04:41,011
You mean Sam?

104
00:04:41,045 --> 00:04:42,145
No, the Earl.

105
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,847
I'm sure he'll be on
his best behavior.

106
00:04:43,881 --> 00:04:45,048
Then you don't know Sam.

107
00:04:45,066 --> 00:04:46,733
Listen, you've gotta help me
keep an eye on him.

108
00:04:46,768 --> 00:04:48,185
If anyone finds out
about this...

109
00:04:48,219 --> 00:04:50,270
Find out about what?

110
00:04:50,321 --> 00:04:53,457
Uh, V.I.P. on our London
flight... a congressman Rawlings.

111
00:04:53,491 --> 00:04:56,059
Oh, great man. Met him
at a fund-raiser last year.

112
00:04:56,094 --> 00:04:58,795
Let me guess.
Fat cats for progress?

113
00:04:58,830 --> 00:04:59,963
<i>Hysterical.</i>

114
00:04:59,998 --> 00:05:01,098
Let's just make sure
the congressman gets

115
00:05:01,165 --> 00:05:03,066
the V.I.P. treatment today,
okay?

116
00:05:03,084 --> 00:05:04,201
Emphasis on the "V".

117
00:05:04,235 --> 00:05:05,369
Aye aye, captain.

118
00:05:05,403 --> 00:05:08,171
Oh, no,
you're not our captain.

119
00:05:08,206 --> 00:05:09,373
Where is Dean?

120
00:05:09,407 --> 00:05:10,440
Called in sick.

121
00:05:10,475 --> 00:05:12,376
Huh. Must be something
going around.

122
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:13,877
Colette's sick, too.

123
00:05:13,911 --> 00:05:15,345
Mm.

124
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,913
Who's Dean's replacement?

125
00:05:16,948 --> 00:05:18,131
Captain Thornton.

126
00:05:18,182 --> 00:05:19,282
<i>Dennis</i> Thornton?

127
00:05:19,317 --> 00:05:20,300
You know him?

128
00:05:20,351 --> 00:05:23,086
Captain on my very first
round-the-world.

129
00:05:23,104 --> 00:05:26,139
Two weeks of war stories
and wandering hands.

130
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,924
Steer clear.

131
00:05:40,604 --> 00:05:41,705
Ladies.

132
00:05:41,739 --> 00:05:43,773
Captain.

133
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,777
I'm sorry,

134
00:05:47,795 --> 00:05:49,379
but, uh,
your hat is where?

135
00:05:49,414 --> 00:05:51,415
Oh. The hat pin broke.

136
00:05:51,449 --> 00:05:53,383
I was just trying
to fix it.

137
00:05:53,418 --> 00:05:55,852
I don't care about your excuses,
miss...

138
00:05:55,887 --> 00:05:57,888
Cameron.

139
00:05:57,922 --> 00:05:58,989
Laura Cameron.

140
00:05:59,023 --> 00:06:01,491
Next time I see you
out of uniform,

141
00:06:01,526 --> 00:06:03,293
you'll be written up.

142
00:06:08,933 --> 00:06:11,634
He always does that.
Don't let it get to you.

143
00:06:11,652 --> 00:06:14,071
How? That man is awful.

144
00:06:14,105 --> 00:06:15,322
Ugh. Tell me about it.

145
00:06:15,356 --> 00:06:17,741
Six hours of World War II
stories to look forward to.

146
00:06:17,775 --> 00:06:19,860
Remind me to kill Dean
next time I see him.

147
00:06:19,911 --> 00:06:21,311
You're jeopardizing

148
00:06:21,345 --> 00:06:23,647
the life of every living being
on this planet!

149
00:06:23,681 --> 00:06:24,681
Whoa.

150
00:06:24,716 --> 00:06:26,166
It's murder
on a worldwide scale!

151
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,018
I mean, when are you people
gonna realize

152
00:06:28,052 --> 00:06:31,088
that nuclear weapons are
nothing but a death sentence

153
00:06:31,122 --> 00:06:32,255
for the human race?!

154
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:33,590
Sir! You need to calm down.

155
00:06:33,624 --> 00:06:35,158
You need to get your hands
off me, flyboy!

156
00:06:35,176 --> 00:06:36,826
Sorry about this,
congressman.

157
00:06:36,844 --> 00:06:38,347
We're gonna take care
of this right away.

158
00:06:38,348 --> 00:06:39,062
It's okay, captain.

159
00:06:39,097 --> 00:06:41,264
Let him talk.
It's a free country.

160
00:06:41,299 --> 00:06:42,699
Well, actually,
I'm the first officer.

161
00:06:42,734 --> 00:06:44,718
Uh, Ted Vanderway. We met
at, uh, midtown fund-raiser.

162
00:06:44,769 --> 00:06:46,669
Of course.
Good to see you again.

163
00:06:46,687 --> 00:06:47,771
Yes.

164
00:06:47,805 --> 00:06:48,939
What are you, the President
of his fan club?

165
00:06:48,973 --> 00:06:50,307
Sir, you need to take
your seat.

166
00:06:50,341 --> 00:06:51,842
Hey, Maggie,
get this guy off of me.

167
00:06:51,876 --> 00:06:54,644
Wait, you know this guy?

168
00:07:03,445 --> 00:07:06,831
Stay here and don't move,
don't talk,

169
00:07:06,865 --> 00:07:09,933
and if possible,
don't even breathe.

170
00:07:09,951 --> 00:07:11,402
Mags, come on.
Do you know who that was?

171
00:07:11,436 --> 00:07:13,304
You're talking
and breathing.

172
00:07:13,338 --> 00:07:15,072
Christopher Rawlings...

173
00:07:15,107 --> 00:07:17,008
Congressman warmonger himself.

174
00:07:17,042 --> 00:07:18,242
So?

175
00:07:18,276 --> 00:07:19,510
So he's probably on his way
to the symposium.

176
00:07:19,544 --> 00:07:20,811
This is our big chance.

177
00:07:20,846 --> 00:07:24,582
<i>Your</i> chance to be
the nice, respectful passenger

178
00:07:24,616 --> 00:07:26,283
you promised to be.

179
00:07:26,301 --> 00:07:27,585
- But I d...
- No "buts."

180
00:07:27,619 --> 00:07:30,254
For once in your life, Sam,

181
00:07:30,288 --> 00:07:33,224
just <i>try</i> to fit in.

182
00:07:33,258 --> 00:07:35,326
You mean like you?

183
00:07:36,895 --> 00:07:39,647
I am my principles, Maggie.

184
00:07:41,183 --> 00:07:43,868
I can't separate that
from who I am.

185
00:07:46,371 --> 00:07:49,240
Yep.  That was
my 44th mission

186
00:07:49,274 --> 00:07:51,742
in my P-38 Lightning.

187
00:07:51,777 --> 00:07:55,746
That little gem of a plane
was practically a part of me.

188
00:07:55,781 --> 00:07:58,682
They don't make 'em like that
anymore.

189
00:07:58,717 --> 00:08:01,452
All this... clutter.

190
00:08:01,486 --> 00:08:02,720
No maneuverability.

191
00:08:02,754 --> 00:08:06,490
Anyway, the frogs were
hunkered down outside of Bayeux,

192
00:08:06,508 --> 00:08:08,292
and only the jerries
were on the road.

193
00:08:08,326 --> 00:08:11,095
So... if something moves, we're
supposed to just light it up.

194
00:08:12,831 --> 00:08:14,014
Coffee, gentlemen?

195
00:08:14,049 --> 00:08:15,216
Oh, bless you.

196
00:08:15,267 --> 00:08:17,334
I'll let you know when
coffee is served. Dismissed.

197
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:21,505
Um...

198
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:24,341
Scoot, missy.
That'll be all.

199
00:08:28,613 --> 00:08:32,700
So anyway, I spotted
this convoy of Jerry trucks,

200
00:08:32,734 --> 00:08:34,118
and I'm thinking to myself,

201
00:08:34,152 --> 00:08:37,354
hey, this is my lucky day.
I'm gonna take 'em all out.

202
00:08:40,792 --> 00:08:43,494
I can't believe
we're hooking.

203
00:08:45,831 --> 00:08:47,748
We're not...
We're not "hooking."

204
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:49,066
W...
Playing hooky.

205
00:08:49,101 --> 00:08:51,102
What you just said
means something else entirely.

206
00:08:51,136 --> 00:08:53,587
What did I say?

207
00:08:53,638 --> 00:08:56,307
It involves
charging by the hour.

208
00:08:56,341 --> 00:08:58,309
Oh! Uh, no.

209
00:08:58,343 --> 00:09:01,545
Ahem. The apples
look beautiful.

210
00:09:01,563 --> 00:09:05,516
Yeah. Mcintosh.
My mom's favorite.

211
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,217
We'll bring her a dozen.

212
00:09:07,235 --> 00:09:08,886
- Your mother?
- Yeah.

213
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,688
No, I thought
we were going flying.

214
00:09:10,722 --> 00:09:12,089
We are.

215
00:09:12,124 --> 00:09:13,240
Here you go.

216
00:09:13,275 --> 00:09:14,391
Thank you.

217
00:09:14,409 --> 00:09:15,793
Crop duster belongs
to my father.

218
00:09:15,827 --> 00:09:17,828
He keeps it behind the barn.

219
00:09:17,863 --> 00:09:19,997
I'm going to meet
your parents?

220
00:09:20,031 --> 00:09:21,398
It's no big deal.

221
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:22,833
We always had people
stopping by...

222
00:09:22,868 --> 00:09:24,285
Friends, neighbors.

223
00:09:24,336 --> 00:09:27,454
My high school baseball team
practically lived there.

224
00:09:27,506 --> 00:09:28,956
Oh, Dean, I'm not sure.

225
00:09:29,007 --> 00:09:30,574
Isn't this
a little different?

226
00:09:30,592 --> 00:09:31,876
It'll be fun.

227
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:35,079
You know, we'll have lunch,
exchange pleasantries.

228
00:09:35,113 --> 00:09:37,047
And then...

229
00:09:37,082 --> 00:09:38,716
We'll fly.

230
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,951
Congressman Rawlings,

231
00:09:56,985 --> 00:09:59,803
I am so sorry about
what happened with that man.

232
00:09:59,838 --> 00:10:02,473
Oh, it's okay. Everyone's
entitled to an opinion,

233
00:10:02,507 --> 00:10:04,275
even if
it's completely wrong.

234
00:10:05,961 --> 00:10:08,345
Well, please allow me
to offer you a free drink,

235
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,181
courtesy of Pan Am.

236
00:10:10,215 --> 00:10:11,315
I thought
they were already free.

237
00:10:11,349 --> 00:10:13,984
But this one's
coming from me.

238
00:10:14,019 --> 00:10:18,222
Well, I wish I could, but, uh,
it'll put me right to sleep.

239
00:10:18,256 --> 00:10:20,257
Big speech tomorrow.

240
00:10:20,292 --> 00:10:21,525
The World Atomic Symposium?

241
00:10:21,593 --> 00:10:22,793
You've heard of it?

242
00:10:22,811 --> 00:10:25,162
You'd be surprised
at the things I've heard of.

243
00:10:25,197 --> 00:10:26,897
Well, I don't doubt that.

244
00:10:26,932 --> 00:10:29,867
I bet you've got a few surprises
under that cute blue hat.

245
00:11:07,973 --> 00:11:09,607
I'll get it.

246
00:11:11,192 --> 00:11:13,911
This is Laura.

247
00:11:13,945 --> 00:11:15,729
Right away, captain.

248
00:11:17,015 --> 00:11:20,050
Captain Bligh wants his coffee.

249
00:11:20,085 --> 00:11:22,236
Do you want me
to bring it?

250
00:11:22,287 --> 00:11:24,121
No, thank you.

251
00:11:24,155 --> 00:11:26,257
I can do it.

252
00:11:34,032 --> 00:11:35,249
You wanted coffee, captain?

253
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,467
Oh, thank you, Lori.

254
00:11:36,501 --> 00:11:37,701
It's Laura, sir.

255
00:11:37,719 --> 00:11:39,420
Uh, would you
do me a favor, honey?

256
00:11:39,471 --> 00:11:42,906
Uh, this damn air speed gauge
is fogged up.

257
00:11:42,941 --> 00:11:45,409
Uh, would you mind
cleaning it for me?

258
00:11:45,443 --> 00:11:47,344
Of course not.

259
00:11:57,772 --> 00:11:59,523
Aah!
God! What the hell?!

260
00:11:59,557 --> 00:12:02,026
Oh! I-I am so sorry.

261
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,777
It... it must be the turbulence.

262
00:12:03,828 --> 00:12:05,562
You get her off
of my flight deck right now,

263
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,780
Vanderway.

264
00:12:06,831 --> 00:12:08,899
You should probably, um...

265
00:12:08,933 --> 00:12:10,734
What an idiot.

266
00:12:23,798 --> 00:12:26,350
Laura, why are you hiding
back here?

267
00:12:26,384 --> 00:12:27,685
We're ready to go.

268
00:12:27,719 --> 00:12:30,087
Me? I'm... I'm not hiding.

269
00:12:30,105 --> 00:12:31,388
Miss Cameron!

270
00:12:33,725 --> 00:12:37,361
Miss Cameron!

271
00:12:37,395 --> 00:12:38,896
You think
you're pretty clever

272
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:40,564
with that little coffee stunt,
huh?

273
00:12:40,598 --> 00:12:41,665
No, sir, I didn't...

274
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,100
Well, I hope
the London base manager

275
00:12:43,134 --> 00:12:44,601
appreciates
your sense of humor

276
00:12:44,636 --> 00:12:47,538
because I'm filing paperwork
for disciplinary action.

277
00:12:47,572 --> 00:12:49,740
Captain, I'm sorry if I...

278
00:12:49,774 --> 00:12:51,075
Oh, you'll be sorry,
all right.

279
00:12:51,109 --> 00:12:52,659
Captain.

280
00:12:52,711 --> 00:12:53,877
Can I speak to you
for a moment?

281
00:12:53,912 --> 00:12:55,012
Not now.

282
00:12:55,046 --> 00:12:57,981
Well, actually, sir,
it has to be right now.

283
00:13:03,788 --> 00:13:06,223
Please tell me
it was piping hot.

284
00:13:06,257 --> 00:13:08,792
Oh, you're my hero.

285
00:13:08,827 --> 00:13:10,027
Shh!

286
00:13:10,061 --> 00:13:12,563
What is Ted doing?

287
00:13:12,597 --> 00:13:15,399
Oh, probably making it worse.

288
00:13:23,691 --> 00:13:25,492
What happened?
What did you say to him?

289
00:13:25,527 --> 00:13:27,010
Oh, I told him he could
take that paperwork

290
00:13:27,045 --> 00:13:28,746
and shove it right up
his cargo hold.

291
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:29,880
You didn't.

292
00:13:29,914 --> 00:13:32,616
No,
but it's taken care of.

293
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:35,119
Ted, thank you.

294
00:13:35,153 --> 00:13:36,286
No, thank <i>you.</i>

295
00:13:36,321 --> 00:13:37,788
After that little trick
you pulled,

296
00:13:37,822 --> 00:13:39,990
that blowhard didn't say a word
for the last thousand miles.

297
00:13:40,024 --> 00:13:41,658
No, I really owe you.

298
00:13:41,676 --> 00:13:44,962
Well, that's good to hear, uh,
'cause I'm ready to collect.

299
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:50,434
Oh, please.

300
00:13:50,468 --> 00:13:53,003
I'm not a total cad
all the time.

301
00:13:53,037 --> 00:13:54,671
Then what is it?

302
00:13:54,706 --> 00:13:58,308
It's not a what, it's a who...
Amanda Hartford Mason.

303
00:13:58,343 --> 00:14:01,345
<i>You</i> want my help
with a girl?

304
00:14:01,379 --> 00:14:02,513
Uh-huh.

305
00:14:13,408 --> 00:14:14,825
Let's move a little faster,
ladies.

306
00:14:14,859 --> 00:14:17,494
This place is crawling
with lobby lizards.

307
00:14:17,528 --> 00:14:19,529
I've never seen so many
in one place.

308
00:14:19,547 --> 00:14:22,099
It's the uniform.
It turns grown men to mush.

309
00:14:22,133 --> 00:14:24,368
Seems to cause
memory problems, too.

310
00:14:24,402 --> 00:14:25,869
They all forget
they're married.

311
00:14:27,205 --> 00:14:30,174
Laura, grab my key for me.
I need to make a call.

312
00:14:34,095 --> 00:14:35,012
Pardon me.

313
00:14:36,181 --> 00:14:37,931
Would you happen to have
a cigarette?

314
00:14:37,982 --> 00:14:41,351
I seem to have left mine
in the other jacket.

315
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,620
Yes, of course.

316
00:14:44,772 --> 00:14:47,241
Very good. Thank you.

317
00:14:51,613 --> 00:14:53,163
Okay. I've done my job.

318
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:54,364
Hold on, Kate.

319
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:55,616
What?

320
00:14:55,667 --> 00:14:56,967
Richard said I give you
the case and I'm through.

321
00:14:57,001 --> 00:14:58,202
I'm <i>through.</i>

322
00:14:58,236 --> 00:14:59,436
Hardly.

323
00:14:59,471 --> 00:15:01,038
The mission's changed.

324
00:15:01,072 --> 00:15:03,841
You're just getting started.

325
00:15:12,562 --> 00:15:14,613
There's been a hitch, Kate.

326
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:16,348
I did what I was asked.

327
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:18,450
Whatever the hitch is,
it's not my problem.

328
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:21,786
You don't understand.
This is an urgent situation.

329
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:24,372
The list was to be delivered to
the Soviets three days from now.

330
00:15:24,407 --> 00:15:26,007
Instead, they're coming for it
tonight.

331
00:15:26,042 --> 00:15:28,843
I've had to improvise.
I need you to be my decoy.

332
00:15:28,878 --> 00:15:30,645
Decoy for what?

333
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,214
A certain jeweler.

334
00:15:32,248 --> 00:15:35,133
Cyrus Bolger.

335
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,686
In his possession
is the actual list,

336
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,987
not this fake
that you've supplied to us.

337
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,789
Our people are going to
break into his safe

338
00:15:40,823 --> 00:15:42,173
and switch the two.

339
00:15:42,225 --> 00:15:45,860
And how exactly do you suppose
I decoy this...

340
00:15:45,895 --> 00:15:47,128
Mr. Bolger?

341
00:15:47,163 --> 00:15:50,599
Simply by being yourself...
A Pan Am stewardess.

342
00:15:50,633 --> 00:15:52,984
I, however...

343
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:56,071
Will be Mr. Caldwell
down from Liverpool...

344
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,640
Here to close
a business deal...

345
00:15:58,658 --> 00:16:00,041
And get reacquainted

346
00:16:00,076 --> 00:16:03,695
with my favorite stewardess.

347
00:16:03,746 --> 00:16:05,313
Well, at least
I'm your favorite.

348
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:07,215
Caldwell likes
to buy expensive baubles

349
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,750
for his paramour.

350
00:16:08,784 --> 00:16:11,319
That's our entree
to the jeweler.

351
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:14,422
I told you,
I'm not interested.

352
00:16:14,457 --> 00:16:15,824
Understood,

353
00:16:15,858 --> 00:16:18,560
but you may be familiar with
some of the names on that list.

354
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:22,830
Do I have your interest now?

355
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:25,267
Who's on that list?

356
00:16:25,301 --> 00:16:27,869
Bridget Pierce.

357
00:16:29,805 --> 00:16:32,474
Among others.

358
00:16:34,043 --> 00:16:37,612
And Niko Lonza?

359
00:16:37,647 --> 00:16:40,081
He's at the top.

360
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:48,089
Let me walk you
through the mission.

361
00:17:02,538 --> 00:17:04,139
This is it.

362
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:12,180
Don't worry.
You look great.

363
00:17:12,214 --> 00:17:13,431
Nobody looks great

364
00:17:13,482 --> 00:17:15,233
after a hundred miles
in a convertible.

365
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:17,786
They are gonna love you.

366
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,855
- I just wasn't expecting to...
- Hey...

367
00:17:20,889 --> 00:17:22,390
I didn't tell you

368
00:17:22,425 --> 00:17:24,526
because I didn't want
to make a big deal out of it.

369
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,827
Okay?

370
00:17:25,861 --> 00:17:27,112
Dean!

371
00:17:27,163 --> 00:17:29,781
Bill, it's Dean!

372
00:17:29,832 --> 00:17:32,367
Hiya, mom. Hi.

373
00:17:32,401 --> 00:17:34,402
Oh. Oh.
Mm.

374
00:17:34,634 --> 00:17:36,154
Bill, they're here.

375
00:17:36,172 --> 00:17:37,088
I can see 'em, Marjorie.

376
00:17:37,123 --> 00:17:39,040
I've got eyes.
Ohh.

377
00:17:39,074 --> 00:17:41,042
And this must be Bridget.

378
00:17:41,076 --> 00:17:42,910
No.
N...

379
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:45,613
Uh...  Mom, pop,
this is, uh, this is Colette.

380
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:48,883
Oh, dear. Colette.
Well...

381
00:17:48,917 --> 00:17:51,436
Mr. and Mrs. Lowrey, it's
a pleasure to meet you both.

382
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,587
You're French?

383
00:17:52,621 --> 00:17:53,888
<i>Oui.</i>
Ohh.

384
00:17:53,922 --> 00:17:54,956
Colette and I work
together.

385
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,941
She's, uh,
she's a Pan Am stewardess.

386
00:17:56,976 --> 00:17:57,892
Oh.

387
00:17:57,926 --> 00:17:59,561
So what happened
to Bridget?

388
00:17:59,595 --> 00:18:03,231
Well, come on in, you two.
Let's have some lunch.

389
00:18:03,265 --> 00:18:04,265
Yes.

390
00:18:11,273 --> 00:18:16,378
Ohh. Amanda Mason was
the bane of my adolescence.

391
00:18:16,412 --> 00:18:18,913
This girl was a cross
between Grace Kelly

392
00:18:18,948 --> 00:18:20,048
and... and an ice cube.

393
00:18:20,082 --> 00:18:21,216
She wouldn't give you
the time of day?

394
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,667
She wouldn't give me
the month.

395
00:18:22,718 --> 00:18:24,986
She wouldn't give me the year,
for that matter.

396
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,555
A-anyway, our
parents are best friends,

397
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:29,841
weekends in East Hampton
a-and all that,

398
00:18:29,892 --> 00:18:32,177
and Amanda, ohh,
went out of her way

399
00:18:32,228 --> 00:18:34,295
to make my life
absolutely miserable.

400
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:35,764
She was mean to you?

401
00:18:35,798 --> 00:18:37,932
No, worse. She ignored me.

402
00:18:37,966 --> 00:18:40,018
And you're going out
with this girl why?

403
00:18:40,069 --> 00:18:42,187
Sneak attack
from the parents.

404
00:18:42,238 --> 00:18:45,240
"Oh, Edward. You're going to be
in London at the same time."

405
00:18:45,274 --> 00:18:46,474
Blah, blah, blah.

406
00:18:46,509 --> 00:18:48,693
"Oh, what
a wonderful coincidence."

407
00:18:48,744 --> 00:18:50,245
Your parents call you
Edward?

408
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:52,647
When they're trying
to ruin my life,

409
00:18:52,665 --> 00:18:53,748
which is always.

410
00:18:53,783 --> 00:18:56,034
- Okay.
- What do you want me to do?

411
00:18:56,085 --> 00:18:57,318
I want you to be
my girlfriend.

412
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:59,788
I made a reservation at 7:30
at the hotel dining room.

413
00:18:59,822 --> 00:19:02,373
At 8:00, you come over to
our table, steaming mad at me,

414
00:19:02,425 --> 00:19:03,825
which shouldn't be much
of a stretch for you,

415
00:19:03,843 --> 00:19:06,561
but you gotta come at me
with both barrels, you know?

416
00:19:06,595 --> 00:19:07,662
Hey, you can wear
that little black number,

417
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,930
the one
that shows off your...

418
00:19:08,964 --> 00:19:12,050
O-okay, Ted, I agreed
to this favor reluctantly.

419
00:19:12,101 --> 00:19:14,002
You can't tell me
what to wear.

420
00:19:14,036 --> 00:19:15,837
Fair enough.

421
00:19:15,871 --> 00:19:17,672
You could just tell
your parents no.

422
00:19:17,706 --> 00:19:19,307
Way too complicated.

423
00:19:19,341 --> 00:19:22,210
But having me pretend to be your
deranged girlfriend makes sense?

424
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:23,228
Yeah.
Glad you see it my way.

425
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:40,795
Sam, what are you
doing here?

426
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:43,865
I thought you'd be filling
Molotov cocktails by now.

427
00:19:43,883 --> 00:19:46,367
No, the only cocktail
I'm filling...

428
00:19:46,402 --> 00:19:49,237
Emptying...
Is right here.

429
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,539
What happened
to ban the bomb UK?

430
00:19:51,574 --> 00:19:54,209
Ohh. Arrested.
Locked up.

431
00:19:54,243 --> 00:19:55,610
Thrown in the pokey.

432
00:19:55,644 --> 00:19:58,446
Ohh. Sam, I'm so sorry.

433
00:19:58,481 --> 00:20:00,381
Well, it's a good thing
you weren't with them.

434
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:03,618
How can you say that?
I should have been with them.

435
00:20:03,652 --> 00:20:05,520
You wanted to get arrested?

436
00:20:05,554 --> 00:20:07,155
If that's
what was necessary.

437
00:20:07,189 --> 00:20:09,657
You can't effect change
without personal sacrifice.

438
00:20:09,692 --> 00:20:11,726
How is going to jail
the answer?

439
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,579
You talk about seeing
the world to change it, Maggie,

440
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:16,331
but you're
just another tourist.

441
00:20:16,365 --> 00:20:17,332
I am not.

442
00:20:17,366 --> 00:20:19,100
You meet important people
in your job.

443
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:20,401
When was the last time
you talked to them...

444
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:23,271
<i>Really</i> talked to them?

445
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,924
I talk to people all the time.

446
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,610
Sure,
to take a lunch order.

447
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:31,930
You have a captive audience
at 35,000 feet,

448
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:34,916
and you won't take
advantage of it.

449
00:20:36,084 --> 00:20:37,468
You could make a difference...

450
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,855
But you don't.

451
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:53,368
Paris must be the most
beautiful city in the world.

452
00:20:53,402 --> 00:20:55,286
What was it like
growing up there?

453
00:20:55,321 --> 00:20:56,938
Well, actually, mom,
she's, uh,

454
00:20:56,972 --> 00:20:59,240
she's from
the countryside, so...

455
00:20:59,275 --> 00:21:00,775
 So, yeah, not so
different from here.

456
00:21:00,793 --> 00:21:02,377
Oh.
Yeah.

457
00:21:02,411 --> 00:21:04,445
And how long have you two
been flying together?

458
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,948
Well, we've been on
the same crew for a few months.

459
00:21:06,982 --> 00:21:08,182
Yeah.

460
00:21:08,217 --> 00:21:09,784
She... she speaks
four different languages...

461
00:21:09,802 --> 00:21:10,985
Ohh.
And she makes, uh,

462
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:14,255
this, um, it's a tart...
Tarte tatin?

463
00:21:14,289 --> 00:21:16,324
Tarte tatin.

464
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:17,692
- It's, uh...
- French.

465
00:21:17,726 --> 00:21:20,011
It's... yeah. I-it tastes exactly
like your apple cobbler.

466
00:21:20,062 --> 00:21:20,979
So good.

467
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:22,296
Uh, h-hold on here.

468
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:24,165
I don't want to point out
the elephant in the room,

469
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:25,600
but I have to ask.

470
00:21:25,634 --> 00:21:27,302
What the hell happened
to Bridget?

471
00:21:27,336 --> 00:21:28,353
- Bill.
- Dad.

472
00:21:28,404 --> 00:21:30,104
Nothing personal,
Colette...

473
00:21:30,138 --> 00:21:31,573
But the last time my son was here,

474
00:21:31,607 --> 00:21:34,275
he told us he was getting
engaged to a girl named Bridget.

475
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:37,245
Hey, dad. Can we talk
about this later?

476
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:38,980
It's always later with you.

477
00:21:39,014 --> 00:21:41,015
You didn't call us
when you left the Air Force.

478
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:43,785
You didn't tell us
when you took the Pan Am job,

479
00:21:43,819 --> 00:21:45,687
and now you're jetting around
God-knows-where.

480
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:48,022
H-how are we supposed to know
what's going on with you?

481
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:49,591
I'm here now.
Isn't that good enough?

482
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:52,193
On what occasion?
You two getting engaged?

483
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:53,661
Bill, please.

484
00:21:53,696 --> 00:21:54,696
Mnh. No. Wh...

485
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,547
Are you expecting?

486
00:21:56,599 --> 00:21:57,565
- No.
- Bill!

487
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,434
- Come on.
- As I live and breathe!

488
00:21:59,468 --> 00:22:01,803
I'm sorry.
Would you excuse me?

489
00:22:01,837 --> 00:22:04,839
Oh.

490
00:22:05,975 --> 00:22:07,609
What are you thinking?

491
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:34,451
Colette, listen.

492
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:41,208
You gotta...
understand about my parents.

493
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,495
Take me home, Dean.

494
00:22:47,298 --> 00:22:49,666
Come on. I thought you wanted
to learn how to fly.

495
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:53,003
I think I've learned enough
for one day.

496
00:22:56,975 --> 00:22:58,559
I'm sorry. I'm...

497
00:22:58,593 --> 00:23:01,445
You know, I never really
expected today

498
00:23:01,479 --> 00:23:03,347
to go like this.

499
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,851
Well, how did you think
it would go?

500
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,219
You would pretend
I was Bridget

501
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:10,604
until your parents
figured it out?

502
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:12,556
No, I-I figured
they'd meet you,

503
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:14,942
and... and they'd think
you're fantastic,

504
00:23:14,993 --> 00:23:16,026
like I do, and...

505
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,528
And the embarrassment
of breaking up

506
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:20,364
with your fiancee
would be ignored?

507
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:25,502
Okay. I messed up.

508
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:28,739
I'm sorry.

509
00:23:30,675 --> 00:23:31,975
Can we start over?

510
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:35,412
No. It's not that simple.

511
00:23:35,446 --> 00:23:39,583
Look, I realize how awkward
that was back there,

512
00:23:39,617 --> 00:23:43,821
but you gotta understand that
that has nothing to do with us.

513
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:46,790
Us?  I don't think
there is an "us," Dean.

514
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:48,692
- You're still in love with Bridget.
- No.

515
00:23:48,726 --> 00:23:50,027
- Yes.
- No.

516
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:51,295
Yes. That's why you didn't
tell your parents.

517
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:53,146
You still imagine
she'll show up one day

518
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:55,365
like nothing happened,
like she never left you.

519
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,784
And you're so sure that
every guy that you fall for

520
00:23:57,819 --> 00:23:59,936
is gonna up and leave you
for another woman.

521
00:23:59,954 --> 00:24:02,306
I'm not going to let
myself get hurt again.

522
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,291
So then why would you
kiss me in Miami?

523
00:24:04,325 --> 00:24:06,743
Honestly, I don't know.
Just take me home.

524
00:24:06,777 --> 00:24:08,295
- No. No.
- Please take me home.

525
00:24:08,329 --> 00:24:10,163
- No.
- Why... why not?

526
00:24:10,215 --> 00:24:11,882
Because you're asking...
Let me go.

527
00:24:11,916 --> 00:24:14,084
You're asking
the wrong damn question.

528
00:24:14,118 --> 00:24:17,287
You want to know why
I never told my parents

529
00:24:17,322 --> 00:24:18,589
that I broke up
with Bridget.

530
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:22,626
Well, for the same reason that
I never brought her up here

531
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:25,395
to meet them.

532
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:28,565
There's just something
about her that wasn't real,

533
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,302
but after two weeks,

534
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,005
I brought you.

535
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:38,175
So I'm real?

536
00:24:38,209 --> 00:24:40,177
Yeah.

537
00:24:41,779 --> 00:24:42,979
No, Dean.

538
00:24:42,997 --> 00:24:44,414
This is real.

539
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:50,704
Dean.

540
00:25:04,502 --> 00:25:06,236
They're beautiful.

541
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:07,504
Yes.

542
00:25:07,522 --> 00:25:09,839
Well, just last week,
the duchess of argyll was in,

543
00:25:09,857 --> 00:25:11,875
admiring
the very same pieces.

544
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:17,314
- The duchess?
- See, I do have good taste.

545
00:25:17,348 --> 00:25:19,383
Well, it might be
a little excessive, though.

546
00:25:19,417 --> 00:25:20,717
Oh.

547
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:25,322
Darling, after all I do
for you, aren't I worth it?

548
00:25:25,356 --> 00:25:28,558
Well, I suppose they do go
with your eyes.

549
00:25:30,728 --> 00:25:32,729
Can I try
the diamond chips again?

550
00:25:32,764 --> 00:25:34,598
Of course, madam.

551
00:25:37,635 --> 00:25:38,585
There we are.

552
00:25:38,636 --> 00:25:39,836
Ohh.

553
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,421
Oh, it's perfect.

554
00:25:42,607 --> 00:25:44,308
Of course, it'll have
to be sized for me.

555
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:45,742
Oh, we can do that for you.

556
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:47,344
It... it will be ready
tomorrow morning.

557
00:25:47,378 --> 00:25:50,347
Oh, no.
I'm a stewardess for Pan Am,

558
00:25:50,381 --> 00:25:52,616
and our flight leaves
early tomorrow.

559
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:54,217
Perhaps you could bring it
by our hotel

560
00:25:54,252 --> 00:25:56,320
later this evening,
say, 8:00?

561
00:25:56,354 --> 00:25:59,189
If it wouldn't be
too much of an imposition.

562
00:26:01,075 --> 00:26:02,359
Of course not.

563
00:26:03,778 --> 00:26:05,529
Ohh!

564
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:08,398
You are so good to me.

565
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:10,801
Mm.

566
00:26:21,212 --> 00:26:24,348
Wow. Laura, you look...

567
00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:26,783
Wait. You can't meet
the ice princess

568
00:26:26,818 --> 00:26:28,118
with your tie all cockeyed.

569
00:26:28,152 --> 00:26:31,054
Thanks.

570
00:26:33,191 --> 00:26:36,226
Now don't forget... 8:00.
You come marching in,

571
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:38,562
and you make a scene.
Give me full-on Liz Taylor.

572
00:26:38,596 --> 00:26:40,998
"Cleopatra"
or "Butterfield 8"?

573
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:42,132
Whatever's crazier.

574
00:26:42,166 --> 00:26:44,134
I could throw a drink on you.
Pretty good at that.

575
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,671
I don't know why
I'm so nervous about this.

576
00:26:47,705 --> 00:26:49,322
I'm a Pan Am pilot,
for God sake.

577
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:51,675
If I can make 200,000 pounds
of metal fly,

578
00:26:51,709 --> 00:26:54,646
I can handle a half-hour
of misery, right?

579
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,148
For the record,

580
00:26:58,182 --> 00:27:00,751
you're not just a pilot.

581
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:04,855
You're a decent man,
and she is going to regret

582
00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:07,791
the day she ever let you
get away.

583
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:13,129
You should go.

584
00:27:34,485 --> 00:27:36,870
Congressman Rawlings?

585
00:27:36,921 --> 00:27:39,356
I'm Maggie Ryan,
your Pan Am stewardess.

586
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:40,974
Of course.
How could I forget?

587
00:27:41,025 --> 00:27:43,894
Well, I wanted
to apologize again

588
00:27:43,928 --> 00:27:45,896
for the trouble
on the flight.

589
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:47,431
That's not necessary,
miss Ryan.

590
00:27:47,465 --> 00:27:48,648
Maggie.

591
00:27:48,699 --> 00:27:51,735
Maggie. It comes
with the territory.

592
00:27:51,769 --> 00:27:53,603
Can't have a circus
without a clown or two.

593
00:27:55,156 --> 00:27:58,291
Congressman, if you don't
mind my saying so,

594
00:27:58,326 --> 00:28:00,744
your position
on nuclear weapons...

595
00:28:00,778 --> 00:28:02,646
It's wrongheaded.

596
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,165
We need a testing ban.

597
00:28:05,216 --> 00:28:07,584
Well, that's an awfully
simplistic view of things.

598
00:28:07,618 --> 00:28:10,971
So you're saying that 11 of
our greatest atomic scientists,

599
00:28:11,005 --> 00:28:14,491
including Einstein,
are simplistic?

600
00:28:14,525 --> 00:28:17,794
Einstein didn't have to man
a sentry post in Korea

601
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:19,463
and stare down
the Chinese army.

602
00:28:19,497 --> 00:28:20,764
And you did?

603
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:22,165
Yes.

604
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,068
Look, I support regulation,
but banning

605
00:28:25,103 --> 00:28:27,604
nuclear weapons testing
is just plain naive.

606
00:28:27,638 --> 00:28:29,106
Well, I bet I can change
your mind.

607
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,357
No, you can't...

608
00:28:30,408 --> 00:28:32,475
But I'll give you
three flights of stairs to try.

609
00:28:32,493 --> 00:28:36,246
Okay. Every
industrialized nation known...

610
00:28:39,783 --> 00:28:41,350
Take the Cuban missile crisis.

611
00:28:41,385 --> 00:28:42,785
Take it where?

612
00:28:42,819 --> 00:28:46,288
The perfect example of the need
for better dialogue

613
00:28:46,306 --> 00:28:47,256
between the superpowers.

614
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:49,525
Dialogue?
Have you met Khrushchev?

615
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,093
No.

616
00:28:51,128 --> 00:28:53,462
Arrogant. Lots of ear hair.

617
00:28:53,497 --> 00:28:55,514
Right. Of course.

618
00:28:55,566 --> 00:28:57,266
You know Khrushchev.

619
00:28:57,301 --> 00:29:01,354
Well... my point was... is...

620
00:29:01,405 --> 00:29:03,139
You realize
you're in my room.

621
00:29:03,173 --> 00:29:06,742
Well, that's 'cause I haven't
finished yet.

622
00:29:08,712 --> 00:29:09,812
What's this?

623
00:29:09,846 --> 00:29:11,113
Cognac. V.S.O.P.

624
00:29:11,147 --> 00:29:12,949
I know <i>what</i> it is.

625
00:29:12,983 --> 00:29:14,750
I'm not here
for a nightcap.

626
00:29:14,785 --> 00:29:17,153
Indulge me.

627
00:29:17,187 --> 00:29:19,088
You're not going to make
your argument with this.

628
00:29:19,122 --> 00:29:21,757
And you're not going
to make yours without it.

629
00:29:27,381 --> 00:29:28,631
Enough of my job.

630
00:29:28,665 --> 00:29:29,832
Tell me about traveling
the world.

631
00:29:29,866 --> 00:29:32,184
You must have seen
some pretty exotic places.

632
00:29:32,219 --> 00:29:36,606
Sure. Potsdam, Yalta,
Hiroshima...

633
00:29:37,774 --> 00:29:39,475
- What was that?
- What?

634
00:29:39,509 --> 00:29:40,676
You snorted.

635
00:29:40,711 --> 00:29:41,911
No, I didn't.

636
00:29:41,945 --> 00:29:44,580
That was definitely
a snort.

637
00:29:44,615 --> 00:29:47,049
Uh...  A-a chortle.

638
00:29:47,084 --> 00:29:50,152
Maybe a chuckle.

639
00:29:50,187 --> 00:29:52,488
You're not taking me
seriously, are you?

640
00:29:52,522 --> 00:29:56,542
You've made it this far,
and I haven't called security.

641
00:30:04,051 --> 00:30:05,267
Teddy?

642
00:30:05,302 --> 00:30:06,552
Teddy.

643
00:30:06,586 --> 00:30:07,737
Uh...

644
00:30:07,771 --> 00:30:08,721
Oh, it's been...

645
00:30:08,755 --> 00:30:09,772
Ooh. Years.

646
00:30:09,806 --> 00:30:10,723
Forever.

647
00:30:10,757 --> 00:30:12,207
Uh, yeah.

648
00:30:12,225 --> 00:30:14,176
Look at you.

649
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:15,177
Huh?

650
00:30:15,211 --> 00:30:16,312
You've got shoulders.

651
00:30:16,346 --> 00:30:17,229
Oh, yeah.

652
00:30:17,314 --> 00:30:18,347
Well, once I learned

653
00:30:18,381 --> 00:30:20,399
scrawny was no longer
in style.

654
00:30:20,434 --> 00:30:22,184
It's so good
to see you, Teddy.

655
00:30:22,218 --> 00:30:23,319
Yeah.

656
00:30:23,353 --> 00:30:24,904
You always were so funny.

657
00:30:24,938 --> 00:30:25,855
Oh.  Yeah.

658
00:30:25,889 --> 00:30:27,106
Well...

659
00:30:27,157 --> 00:30:28,557
Now I'm funny with shoulders,
apparently.

660
00:30:28,592 --> 00:30:30,793
Yeah.

661
00:30:30,827 --> 00:30:32,495
Yeah.

662
00:30:32,529 --> 00:30:33,562
Um, uh, please.

663
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:34,914
Uh, yeah.

664
00:30:34,948 --> 00:30:36,749
Yeah.

665
00:30:36,783 --> 00:30:40,369
- We've been over this.
- I know what to do.

666
00:30:40,404 --> 00:30:42,638
A half-hour. That's all the time
I need to switch the lists.

667
00:30:42,673 --> 00:30:45,508
<i>And this is it for me?</i>
I do this, and I'm out?

668
00:30:45,542 --> 00:30:48,911
Yes. Yes, you are out.

669
00:30:48,929 --> 00:30:52,048
There he is, right on time.
He's on his way up to you.

670
00:30:52,082 --> 00:30:53,549
- Kate.
<i>-  What?</i>

671
00:30:53,583 --> 00:30:54,800
Stick to the mission.

672
00:30:54,851 --> 00:30:57,019
I know how to be
a stewardess.

673
00:30:57,054 --> 00:30:58,938
I mean about us, our story.

674
00:30:58,972 --> 00:31:01,891
Don't worry, Spencer.
I'll be fine.

675
00:31:01,925 --> 00:31:03,325
Spencer?

676
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,994
I gave you a first name.

677
00:31:06,096 --> 00:31:07,730
<i>Hello?</i>

678
00:31:07,764 --> 00:31:09,565
Be careful, Kate.

679
00:31:10,567 --> 00:31:13,269
He's here. Go.

680
00:31:17,107 --> 00:31:18,074
Good evening.

681
00:31:18,108 --> 00:31:19,709
I have the bracelet.

682
00:31:19,743 --> 00:31:22,778
Oh, come in. It's so kind
of you to bring it here.

683
00:31:22,796 --> 00:31:26,782
Diamonds are expensive,
but service is priceless.

684
00:31:27,984 --> 00:31:29,835
I can't wait to try it on.

685
00:31:29,886 --> 00:31:31,887
Well, the sizing was
a little more difficult

686
00:31:31,922 --> 00:31:35,591
than I thought, but I think
you will like it.

687
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,128
Oh, very nice accommodations
for a stewardess.

688
00:31:39,162 --> 00:31:41,831
Yes. I don't usually have
a room this big,

689
00:31:41,865 --> 00:31:45,167
but Mr. Caldwell...
Well, he insists on the best.

690
00:31:45,202 --> 00:31:46,702
And you deserve it, right?

691
00:31:48,155 --> 00:31:49,805
Where is your Mr. Caldwell?

692
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,141
Oh, he called.
He's running late.

693
00:31:52,175 --> 00:31:53,743
Oh.

694
00:31:53,777 --> 00:31:57,580
Well, don't worry.
He's coming with a checkbook.

695
00:31:57,614 --> 00:32:00,533
Yes, well, I don't have
much time myself.

696
00:32:00,584 --> 00:32:02,835
Uh, let me show you.

697
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:11,927
Kennedy said the test-ban treaty
was only a first step.

698
00:32:11,962 --> 00:32:13,512
First step to surrender.

699
00:32:13,547 --> 00:32:16,348
- You're a cynic.
- Lighter?

700
00:32:16,433 --> 00:32:18,601
If anyone's a cynic,
it's Kennedy,

701
00:32:18,635 --> 00:32:20,770
placating the left for '64.

702
00:32:22,556 --> 00:32:26,909
Well, at least J.F.K. has
the right idea.

703
00:32:31,782 --> 00:32:34,383
And that is?

704
00:32:35,852 --> 00:32:38,420
Relaxation of tensions.

705
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:42,792
Mutual disarmament?

706
00:32:47,898 --> 00:32:49,031
A truce.

707
00:33:02,345 --> 00:33:04,713
What did you think
of the flight?

708
00:33:05,849 --> 00:33:08,083
Takeoff was good...

709
00:33:08,118 --> 00:33:09,418
But the landing was better.

710
00:33:15,258 --> 00:33:18,093
You were right, you know?

711
00:33:18,128 --> 00:33:19,862
About what?

712
00:33:21,131 --> 00:33:24,900
Back when we were
on the ground in Haiti...

713
00:33:27,237 --> 00:33:29,438
I felt like I was coming
apart at the seams.

714
00:33:31,308 --> 00:33:33,142
You were wonderful.

715
00:33:35,111 --> 00:33:37,479
I didn't think we were gonna
make it out of there.

716
00:33:37,514 --> 00:33:39,248
But we did.

717
00:33:42,652 --> 00:33:47,423
Well, you were right
about rescuing the girl.

718
00:33:47,457 --> 00:33:50,926
I never would have
forgiven myself.

719
00:33:52,629 --> 00:33:54,763
You don't need to say this.

720
00:33:57,567 --> 00:34:00,269
You saved us.

721
00:34:02,772 --> 00:34:05,274
Yeah, but you saved me.

722
00:34:08,211 --> 00:34:11,247
Does this mean I earned
my wings?

723
00:34:13,984 --> 00:34:16,352
Not yet.

724
00:34:30,233 --> 00:34:31,817
Do you remember
that summer?

725
00:34:31,851 --> 00:34:33,235
Ohh. Pfft.

726
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:35,437
Block island...
And your dad's crazy clambake?

727
00:34:35,472 --> 00:34:39,074
Oh, yeah. You used to wear that,
um, uh, flowery headband.

728
00:34:39,109 --> 00:34:41,410
- Yeah.
- How do you remember that?

729
00:34:41,444 --> 00:34:45,281
Wow. You were right about the lobster.

730
00:34:47,183 --> 00:34:48,884
I think I have order envy.

731
00:34:48,919 --> 00:34:50,486
We can share.

732
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,854
No. No, no, no.

733
00:34:51,888 --> 00:34:53,489
I'll suffer through
my bad decision.

734
00:34:53,523 --> 00:34:54,957
If I can make it
through that clambake,

735
00:34:54,991 --> 00:34:56,175
I-I can survive this.

736
00:34:56,209 --> 00:34:59,361
Well, if you do, I think
you might deserve a reward.

737
00:34:59,396 --> 00:35:00,996
- Oh. Oh, yeah?
- What kind of reward?

738
00:35:01,014 --> 00:35:03,766
The kind that comes wrapped
in a flowery headband.

739
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,468
Really?

740
00:35:22,352 --> 00:35:26,255
Well, well, well.
Look what the cat dragged in.

741
00:35:26,289 --> 00:35:27,206
Captain Thornton.

742
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,074
Oh. Dennis, okay?

743
00:35:30,226 --> 00:35:33,829
So you
and, uh, Vanderway, huh?

744
00:35:33,863 --> 00:35:36,065
Me and Vanderway what?

745
00:35:36,099 --> 00:35:38,400
Oh. You don't have
to hide it.

746
00:35:38,435 --> 00:35:40,169
He told me all about
you two.

747
00:35:40,203 --> 00:35:41,470
Oh, he did?

748
00:35:41,504 --> 00:35:43,772
I'd say
you're pretty lucky.

749
00:35:43,807 --> 00:35:47,376
Not every fella talks
that way about their girl.

750
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:49,645
Really? Um...

751
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:51,814
What did he... say?

752
00:35:51,848 --> 00:35:54,283
That you were wonderful,

753
00:35:54,317 --> 00:35:59,121
smart, funny, kindhearted.

754
00:35:59,155 --> 00:36:00,856
He said that you were
the best thing

755
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:02,191
that's ever happened
to him,

756
00:36:02,225 --> 00:36:05,527
and he didn't want to see
you get into trouble.

757
00:36:05,562 --> 00:36:08,030
Ted said all that about me?

758
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:09,999
Yep.

759
00:36:10,033 --> 00:36:13,952
Like I said, lucky girl.

760
00:36:24,147 --> 00:36:25,347
Oh, cookies.

761
00:36:31,626 --> 00:36:34,361
You know, my flight back
isn't for a few days.

762
00:36:34,395 --> 00:36:37,064
There's a lot we could do
between now and then.

763
00:36:37,098 --> 00:36:38,965
Yeah, if I didn't have

764
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,702
a date with a bunch
of stuffy nuclear scientists.

765
00:36:43,204 --> 00:36:44,738
I'd love to see you
in action.

766
00:36:44,772 --> 00:36:46,006
Well, haven't you already?

767
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:49,426
- Ooh! Come on.
- I want to see your speech.

768
00:36:49,477 --> 00:36:50,877
No. No, no. You don't...
You don't want to do that.

769
00:36:50,895 --> 00:36:52,379
Oh, sure I do. Where is it?

770
00:36:54,432 --> 00:36:56,350
Maggie, wait.

771
00:37:00,905 --> 00:37:04,825
Chris, you can't say all this.

772
00:37:04,859 --> 00:37:06,910
Well, I told you
you weren't going to like it.

773
00:37:08,896 --> 00:37:11,698
You don't honestly believe
all this?

774
00:37:11,732 --> 00:37:13,333
You're damn right, I do.
Give... come on.

775
00:37:13,368 --> 00:37:15,268
It's practically fascism!

776
00:37:15,303 --> 00:37:16,953
Mussolini was
a childhood hero.

777
00:37:17,004 --> 00:37:18,972
Give me the... give me the sp...
What are you doing?

778
00:37:19,006 --> 00:37:20,624
Saving you from yourself.

779
00:37:20,675 --> 00:37:22,175
Maggie!

780
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:23,877
Come on.

781
00:37:23,911 --> 00:37:25,145
Open the door.

782
00:37:25,179 --> 00:37:26,213
Almost there.

783
00:37:29,751 --> 00:37:31,468
Is that smoke?

784
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:33,754
Maggie, that speech is
government property.

785
00:37:33,788 --> 00:37:36,139
Not anymore.

786
00:37:37,692 --> 00:37:41,428
This is the right thing
to do, Chris. Believe me.

787
00:37:41,462 --> 00:37:44,398
In a couple of years,
you will thank me for it.

788
00:37:44,432 --> 00:37:45,932
Yeah? Well, I don't need
those pages.

789
00:37:45,967 --> 00:37:49,002
I have a photographic memory.
It's all up here.

790
00:37:50,154 --> 00:37:52,105
Oh, my God!

791
00:37:52,123 --> 00:37:55,292
Yeah, I know.
It's a real gift.

792
00:37:56,444 --> 00:37:58,278
Oh, my God.

793
00:37:58,312 --> 00:38:00,013
It's lovely.

794
00:38:00,047 --> 00:38:01,815
Uh, we'll have to go back to the shop.

795
00:38:01,849 --> 00:38:03,616
We'll have Mr. Caldwell meet us
there to pay for the bracelet.

796
00:38:03,634 --> 00:38:06,953
The shop? No, wait. Uh, he's
going to be here any minute.

797
00:38:06,971 --> 00:38:08,822
You do hear the fire alarm,
don't you?

798
00:38:08,856 --> 00:38:12,759
Uh, it's probably a false alarm.
It happens here all the time.

799
00:38:12,793 --> 00:38:14,728
Nevertheless, I'm going
to need that bracelet back.

800
00:38:14,762 --> 00:38:15,109
Hold on.

801
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:16,496
You can't expect me
to leave it with you.

802
00:38:16,531 --> 00:38:18,298
It's my bracelet!

803
00:38:18,332 --> 00:38:20,350
- Not until it's been paid for!
- I...

804
00:38:20,401 --> 00:38:22,402
I... no. Please.

805
00:38:22,437 --> 00:38:23,637
No, please.
Mr. Bolger, wait.

806
00:38:23,671 --> 00:38:25,739
What? No.

807
00:38:25,773 --> 00:38:29,643
- Uh... no.
- Please, Mr. Bolger!

808
00:38:30,711 --> 00:38:32,913
Ohh.

809
00:38:32,947 --> 00:38:35,949
Mr. Bolger, please wait!

810
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:44,991
Ted! I am so sorry.

811
00:38:45,009 --> 00:38:45,992
Laura.

812
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:47,494
What... what happened to you
downstairs?

813
00:38:47,512 --> 00:38:48,995
Um, nothing.
I-I didn't even make it

814
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:50,430
to the table,
and both of you were gone.

815
00:38:50,465 --> 00:38:52,199
- Well...
- Teddy, what's going on?

816
00:38:52,233 --> 00:38:55,302
Um, I-it, uh,
it's a fire alarm, I think.

817
00:38:55,336 --> 00:38:57,804
Um, we should...
We should get downstairs.

818
00:39:03,311 --> 00:39:06,597
Uh, excuse me. Excuse me.
Pardon me.

819
00:39:07,231 --> 00:39:08,398
Kate?

820
00:39:08,449 --> 00:39:10,383
Oh.

821
00:39:10,418 --> 00:39:12,903
Maggie. Maggie, wait.

822
00:39:12,954 --> 00:39:14,955
Chris, can we just forget
this ever happened?

823
00:39:14,989 --> 00:39:16,623
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

824
00:39:16,657 --> 00:39:18,158
Because you are,
without a doubt,

825
00:39:18,192 --> 00:39:20,877
the most reckless, pigheaded,
craziest person I've ever met.

826
00:39:20,912 --> 00:39:22,028
I'm sorry.

827
00:39:22,063 --> 00:39:24,831
Don't apologize.
I, uh, I kinda like it.
