00:00:00,708 --> 00:00:01,975
<i>Previously on "Pan Am"...</i>

2
00:00:02,006 --> 00:00:03,206
What do you think
you're doing?

3
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:05,127
I ran away from my own wedding.

4
00:00:05,526 --> 00:00:08,127
Bon voyage, Laura.
Safe journey.

5
00:00:08,196 --> 00:00:10,096
- Marry me.
- I can't say "yes" now.

6
00:00:10,164 --> 00:00:11,331
Bridget?

7
00:00:12,465 --> 00:00:13,999
Fit the profile perfectly.

8
00:00:14,067 --> 00:00:17,135
A Pan Am stewardess can travel
all around the world

9
00:00:17,204 --> 00:00:18,304
without suspicion.

10
00:00:18,371 --> 00:00:20,138
I have no idea
what you've done

11
00:00:20,207 --> 00:00:23,075
nor what it takes
to keep a cold war cold.

12
00:00:23,142 --> 00:00:24,976
- Do you think you're special?
- You think you're in the wrong seat.

13
00:00:25,044 --> 00:00:25,905
Yeah, I am!

14
00:00:25,906 --> 00:00:27,187
Well, you either
need to let it go

15
00:00:27,188 --> 00:00:29,347
or you need to call your daddy
to get you one of your own.

16
00:00:36,555 --> 00:00:37,755
You don't understand.

17
00:00:37,823 --> 00:00:40,291
Maybe if you whine at me
another 20 minutes...

18
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,095
It was my engagement ring.
How could you just sell it?

19
00:00:45,162 --> 00:00:46,330
Same way you pawned it.

20
00:00:46,397 --> 00:00:47,931
I needed the money.

21
00:00:47,998 --> 00:00:49,533
Who pays my bills...
Rockefeller?

22
00:00:49,601 --> 00:00:52,703
Guy comes in, likes the ring.
You left it over 60 days.

23
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:53,737
I sell it.

24
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:55,038
But... but...

25
00:00:55,106 --> 00:00:58,208
Don't spit all that out
again.

26
00:00:58,276 --> 00:01:00,643
I get sob stories in this shop.
I get sob stories at home.

27
00:01:00,711 --> 00:01:03,279
But here, this sidewalk... mine.
No sobbing.

28
00:01:03,347 --> 00:01:04,747
Greg deserves
to have it back.

29
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:06,616
He saved up all his money
to buy me a ring.

30
00:01:06,683 --> 00:01:08,183
For him,
that meant everything.

31
00:01:08,252 --> 00:01:11,820
Oh, yeah? But for you,
not so much, huh?

32
00:01:11,888 --> 00:01:14,657
Ah, crap. Freakin' hot.

33
00:01:14,725 --> 00:01:17,892
I hate summer in New York.

36
00:01:40,715 --> 00:01:42,383
Thank you,
miss Cameron.

37
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:43,550
Next in line.

38
00:01:43,618 --> 00:01:46,887
- Laura, hi.
- Hey, hi.

39
00:01:46,954 --> 00:01:50,055
How is the new arrangement,
staying at Maggie's?

40
00:01:50,123 --> 00:01:51,056
Fine.

41
00:01:51,124 --> 00:01:52,091
And did you, uh,

42
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:53,859
did you settle things
last night?

43
00:01:53,927 --> 00:01:55,762
Kate, why must you
interrogate me about this?

44
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:58,665
Maggie offered. You were more
than happy to have me gone.

45
00:01:58,732 --> 00:02:01,834
No, I meant last night
with Greg.

46
00:02:01,902 --> 00:02:03,303
You know, the man

47
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:06,204
whose engagement ring
you're returning?

48
00:02:06,272 --> 00:02:07,839
Had to cancel.

49
00:02:07,907 --> 00:02:08,940
He couldn't make it to New York?

50
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:10,642
I didn't say that.

51
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:13,178
I came down with the sniffles,
some congestion,

52
00:02:13,245 --> 00:02:14,946
and we had this early flight
this morning.

53
00:02:15,014 --> 00:02:16,315
Really?

54
00:02:16,382 --> 00:02:20,685
What are you saying, Kate?
You don't consider this early?

55
00:02:20,752 --> 00:02:21,919
Oh, cookies.

56
00:02:21,986 --> 00:02:23,287
Can I help?

57
00:02:23,355 --> 00:02:27,425
No. No help. I don't want
any more of your help.

58
00:02:27,492 --> 00:02:29,393
- Good morning, Ted.
- Yuck.

59
00:02:29,461 --> 00:02:31,962
So do you wanna at least talk
about what happened last night?

60
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,964
This is all your fault.

61
00:02:34,032 --> 00:02:36,807
Am I chewing gum? No, I'm not.

62
00:02:36,808 --> 00:02:38,935
Gumdrop, Laura. <i>Drop.</i>

63
00:02:45,343 --> 00:02:47,176
I never miss it.

64
00:02:47,244 --> 00:02:49,011
This Grand Prix?
Every year?

65
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:51,381
My boyhood dream
was to be a racer...

66
00:02:51,449 --> 00:02:52,848
The Monaco circuit.

67
00:02:52,915 --> 00:02:55,050
Now all I can do is watch.

68
00:02:55,117 --> 00:02:57,886
Season after season.
Quite sad, huh?

69
00:02:57,954 --> 00:03:01,156
Oh, yes,
Monte Carlo, the beach,

70
00:03:01,224 --> 00:03:03,058
the water, the sun,

71
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:06,161
every single year. Mm.

72
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:08,796
I feel badly for you,
Mr. Lonza.

73
00:03:08,864 --> 00:03:11,499
Niko, please.
Feel badly for Niko.

74
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:13,735
Roger, Gander.
We have our oceanic clearance.

75
00:03:13,802 --> 00:03:17,137
- Clipper 2-2.
- It's all about speed.

76
00:03:17,205 --> 00:03:19,640
The Grand Prix is a race.
It's not a beauty pageant.

77
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:21,008
Through the streets
of Monaco?

78
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:23,344
My dime's still
on the Cooper-Climax.

79
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:25,779
I like the Citroen.
Now <i>that's</i> an automobile.

80
00:03:25,847 --> 00:03:28,749
Not a formula one, Sanjeev.

81
00:03:28,816 --> 00:03:30,650
Cooper-Climax won it last year.

82
00:03:33,354 --> 00:03:35,756
Thank you, miss.

83
00:03:35,823 --> 00:03:38,324
And that's my point exactly.

84
00:03:38,393 --> 00:03:40,029
Do you boys always
leave this door open?

85
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,026
Sometimes we get lonely.

86
00:03:41,094 --> 00:03:43,629
That is one heck of a dashboard
you've got there.

87
00:03:43,697 --> 00:03:45,431
It does the trick.

88
00:03:46,633 --> 00:03:48,033
Can I help anyone in here?

89
00:03:48,101 --> 00:03:50,302
Do you have any jujubes?

90
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,337
Airport gift shop was out.

91
00:03:52,406 --> 00:03:54,640
Jujubes. No.

92
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:57,108
But if you return to your seat,
I can get you some pate.

93
00:03:57,175 --> 00:03:58,443
Oh, too pasty for me.

94
00:03:58,511 --> 00:04:00,211
And those poor little geese.

95
00:04:00,279 --> 00:04:02,847
But chewy gumdrops...
Pure heaven.

96
00:04:02,915 --> 00:04:06,518
So you're going
with the Cooper, yeah?

97
00:04:06,585 --> 00:04:07,786
I will if you will.

98
00:04:07,853 --> 00:04:10,688
Dean Lowrey, your captain.

99
00:04:10,756 --> 00:04:14,124
Ginny Saddler,
your interloper.

100
00:04:14,191 --> 00:04:17,093
You were mentioning a pub, Niko?

101
00:04:17,161 --> 00:04:19,563
Oh, yeah. Sure.
Great spot.

102
00:04:19,631 --> 00:04:20,597
Excuse me.

103
00:04:20,665 --> 00:04:23,266
Oh. Yugoslavian, I think.

104
00:04:23,334 --> 00:04:24,401
Who?

105
00:04:24,469 --> 00:04:27,805
4C. Are you blind?

106
00:04:27,872 --> 00:04:30,973
No. Just slower on the draw.

107
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:33,375
I'm curious
about the mink coat lady.

108
00:04:33,444 --> 00:04:36,479
A mink coat? In July?

109
00:04:36,547 --> 00:04:39,749
She's not V.I.P.
there's nothing here.

110
00:04:39,817 --> 00:04:41,517
Where is she sitting?

111
00:04:41,585 --> 00:04:43,018
With our captain.

112
00:04:45,488 --> 00:04:46,888
And then the engines
started up.

113
00:04:46,956 --> 00:04:50,024
Vroom, vroom, vroom, and go!

114
00:04:50,092 --> 00:04:52,527
- Really?
- Like "Rebel without a cause"?

115
00:04:52,595 --> 00:04:54,062
Fred and his Desoto,
Lenny in his Buick,

116
00:04:54,129 --> 00:04:56,030
and me and my handkerchief.

117
00:04:56,098 --> 00:04:57,699
"Miss Drag Race,"

118
00:04:57,767 --> 00:05:00,601
Appanoose County, Iowa,
1955.

119
00:05:00,669 --> 00:05:01,702
Ah, so you were listening.

120
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,270
Captive audience.

121
00:05:03,338 --> 00:05:04,538
Oh, my favorite kind.

122
00:05:04,606 --> 00:05:06,206
Was there a cliff?

123
00:05:06,274 --> 00:05:08,075
This wasn't a chicken run.

124
00:05:08,142 --> 00:05:09,543
Oh, there was a thing
with chickens,

125
00:05:09,611 --> 00:05:11,946
but it was only the one night,
and no one meant to...

126
00:05:12,013 --> 00:05:13,881
Well,
no sense revisiting that now.

127
00:05:15,283 --> 00:05:16,216
Anyone for a cup of tea?

128
00:05:16,284 --> 00:05:17,584
- No.
- No, thank you.

129
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:20,186
Love one, but I'm gonna
head back to my seat.

130
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:22,856
These boys need to fly a plane.

131
00:05:24,692 --> 00:05:28,361
Yes, boys,
why don't you fly a plane?

132
00:05:34,433 --> 00:05:35,367
Jujubes?

133
00:05:35,434 --> 00:05:36,434
That's your first thought?

134
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:38,269
- Well...
- Pathetic.

135
00:05:38,337 --> 00:05:42,073
Yes, I stocked up,
and yes, that's pathetic,

136
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:43,441
but this woman...

137
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:47,913
This vivacious,
voluptuous woman...

138
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:50,982
Barely out the door,
and your mind goes to jujubes.

139
00:05:51,049 --> 00:05:53,150
Among other places.

140
00:05:53,218 --> 00:05:54,585
Well, hallelujah,
because sad to say,

141
00:05:54,653 --> 00:05:56,587
she took a liking to you,
captain.

142
00:05:56,655 --> 00:05:57,788
Yeah, maybe.

143
00:05:57,856 --> 00:05:59,490
Not maybe.

144
00:05:59,558 --> 00:06:00,625
Get out there.

145
00:06:00,692 --> 00:06:02,894
Pal, jump off the ledge.

146
00:06:02,961 --> 00:06:05,194
Sign that dance card
and tiptoe yourself

147
00:06:05,262 --> 00:06:07,130
into a little
corporeal distraction.

148
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:13,469
And at great personal sacrifice,
to myself...

149
00:06:13,538 --> 00:06:16,105
I offer you these.

150
00:06:25,715 --> 00:06:27,750
He's not dead, I hope.

151
00:06:27,817 --> 00:06:29,451
Dead.

152
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:32,855
Eight letters,
starts with "M".

153
00:06:32,923 --> 00:06:35,791
"Moribund." It's a good thing
you came along.

154
00:06:35,859 --> 00:06:38,459
See, I thought you'd be up
in first.

155
00:06:38,527 --> 00:06:39,894
Oh, I like it back here.

156
00:06:39,962 --> 00:06:42,030
Who's
your traveling companion?

157
00:06:42,097 --> 00:06:44,165
Oh, not one of mine.

158
00:06:44,232 --> 00:06:46,367
Just cold and tired,
so I tucked him in.

159
00:06:46,435 --> 00:06:47,368
Sweet gent.

160
00:06:47,436 --> 00:06:49,170
Oh, it's a lucky gent.

161
00:06:49,237 --> 00:06:51,372
It's my coat.
I'm the lucky one.

162
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,775
See, people think that I wear it
because I'm rich, which I'm not,

163
00:06:54,842 --> 00:06:58,078
or because I'm snobby,
which I could learn to be.

164
00:06:58,145 --> 00:07:03,116
Truth is, someone's always cold
on an airplane, even in July.

165
00:07:05,219 --> 00:07:06,853
I have a surprise for you.

166
00:07:06,921 --> 00:07:09,221
I love surprises.

167
00:07:13,126 --> 00:07:14,860
Uh, private supplier.

168
00:07:22,769 --> 00:07:25,470
Excuse me.

169
00:07:25,537 --> 00:07:27,906
How you feeling?

170
00:07:27,974 --> 00:07:29,641
Your sniffles
and congestion?

171
00:07:29,709 --> 00:07:33,778
Oh, yes. Much better.
False alarm.

172
00:07:34,947 --> 00:07:37,649
Just enough to cancel
with Greg?

173
00:07:37,717 --> 00:07:39,217
I didn't wanna
make him sick.

174
00:07:39,284 --> 00:07:40,951
Maybe you didn't really
want to end it?

175
00:07:41,019 --> 00:07:43,721
Oh, I did. I do.
Well, I have.

176
00:07:44,789 --> 00:07:46,456
I'm trying.

177
00:07:46,524 --> 00:07:47,791
You have to talk to him.

178
00:07:47,859 --> 00:07:51,294
I'm trying.

179
00:07:51,362 --> 00:07:52,663
And give the ring back.

180
00:07:52,731 --> 00:07:54,598
I'm <i>trying.</i>

181
00:08:04,374 --> 00:08:06,142
I don't remember this weather.

182
00:08:06,209 --> 00:08:07,209
In London?

183
00:08:07,277 --> 00:08:08,377
- In July.
- Oh.

184
00:08:08,445 --> 00:08:10,212
I like it.
But it's chilly.

185
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,108
Couldn't we find a closer
pub to debrief at?

186
00:08:12,109 --> 00:08:13,448
Yes, but this is the one that...

187
00:08:13,516 --> 00:08:15,450
Mr. Lonza's going to?

188
00:08:15,518 --> 00:08:17,052
There will be
race car drivers.

189
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,586
By all means, then,
let's dash.

190
00:08:18,655 --> 00:08:20,522
Laura, you're right.

191
00:08:20,589 --> 00:08:22,624
It is chilly. I'm gonna run back
for my jacket.

192
00:08:22,692 --> 00:08:24,059
I'll meet you guys there?

193
00:08:24,127 --> 00:08:25,127
You want us to wait?

194
00:08:25,194 --> 00:08:26,461
No, go on. I'll be fine.

195
00:08:32,834 --> 00:08:35,469
A bench in the fog,
Mr. Anderson?

196
00:08:35,537 --> 00:08:36,871
Fog? Really?
I hadn't noticed.

197
00:08:36,938 --> 00:08:39,273
But then again,
I'm British.

198
00:08:41,677 --> 00:08:44,045
It's lovely to see you again,
Kate.

199
00:08:44,112 --> 00:08:45,979
That was quick thinking,
about your jacket.

200
00:08:46,047 --> 00:08:49,615
Yep. I am worth every penny.

201
00:08:49,684 --> 00:08:52,485
Wait.
I don't get any pennies.

202
00:08:52,553 --> 00:08:55,755
Shall we discuss your salary
or lack thereof?

203
00:08:55,823 --> 00:08:57,223
No.

204
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:58,958
I think not.

205
00:08:59,026 --> 00:09:00,760
There'll be a man
on your next flight...

206
00:09:00,828 --> 00:09:02,495
Niko Lonza, U.N. attache,

207
00:09:02,563 --> 00:09:05,198
designation of no importance
in this particular assignment.

208
00:09:05,265 --> 00:09:07,766
I've met him. He was
on our flight from New York.

209
00:09:07,834 --> 00:09:09,268
Well, no matter.
We're not interested in him.

210
00:09:09,336 --> 00:09:12,304
However, Monte Carlo,
casino, V.I.P. room.

211
00:09:12,371 --> 00:09:15,473
Mr. Lonza will be gambling
with a friend of his...

212
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:17,810
A friend who is currently
seeing an Italian woman

213
00:09:17,877 --> 00:09:20,312
who goes by the name
of Lena Bracca.

214
00:09:20,379 --> 00:09:22,347
She's a Soviet agent.

215
00:09:22,415 --> 00:09:23,816
We'll need her fingerprints.

216
00:09:25,551 --> 00:09:27,318
How do I do that?

217
00:09:29,121 --> 00:09:31,355
Well, I suspect that you'll
need to arrange for Mr. Lonza

218
00:09:31,423 --> 00:09:33,057
to bring you with him
to the casino

219
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:36,027
so that you can meet
this Lena Bracca.

220
00:09:36,095 --> 00:09:38,830
That may not be so easy.

221
00:09:38,897 --> 00:09:41,365
He's already interested
in another stewardess.

222
00:09:41,433 --> 00:09:44,067
Well...

223
00:09:44,135 --> 00:09:47,003
Un-interest him.

224
00:09:53,183 --> 00:09:56,250
So I said, "you have 21.
You don't need another card."

225
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:59,165
But he blurts right out,
"hit me."

226
00:09:59,233 --> 00:10:01,366
That sounds like something
my super would do.

227
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:04,270
The man doesn't know
a mailbox from a flower box.

228
00:10:04,709 --> 00:10:07,611
Disastrous for
the chrysanthemums.

229
00:10:07,678 --> 00:10:09,779
The table has opened up.

230
00:10:09,847 --> 00:10:11,181
Shall we?

231
00:10:11,249 --> 00:10:14,118
- Oh, I don't know.
- You won't accept my challenge?

232
00:10:14,185 --> 00:10:17,686
Well, if you can teach me.
I've never actually played.

233
00:10:17,754 --> 00:10:20,156
I have.

234
00:10:20,224 --> 00:10:23,126
I'll take your challenge.

235
00:10:23,193 --> 00:10:24,793
And I'll win.

236
00:10:27,864 --> 00:10:29,965
Your friend sounds
like she means it.

237
00:10:30,033 --> 00:10:32,867
Well, she can be competitive.

238
00:10:32,935 --> 00:10:35,770
Uh, 8-ball? 9-ball?
Bank?

239
00:10:35,838 --> 00:10:37,672
It's your choice,
Mr. Lonza.

240
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:41,709
Please, call me Niko.

241
00:10:56,358 --> 00:10:58,659
That's a good shot.

242
00:11:01,329 --> 00:11:02,463
Nice.

243
00:11:04,532 --> 00:11:05,731
Think you're gonna
make that one?

244
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:06,832
Absolutely.

245
00:11:14,308 --> 00:11:16,576
Clearly,
I underestimated you.

246
00:11:16,644 --> 00:11:17,777
Clearly.

247
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:19,245
Let's try darts.

248
00:11:19,313 --> 00:11:20,412
Oh, after a rematch.

249
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,214
Really? I mean, is that okay

250
00:11:22,282 --> 00:11:24,749
with people waiting
for the table?

251
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:27,519
She's right.
I hate to be a pool hog.

252
00:11:27,587 --> 00:11:29,216
You won't allow me
to even the score?

253
00:11:29,217 --> 00:11:31,423
I'm sorry.
There was a chance at that?

254
00:11:32,592 --> 00:11:34,159
Rack 'em up.

255
00:11:34,227 --> 00:11:37,161
Lovely.

256
00:11:44,369 --> 00:11:46,036
Good evening, sir.

257
00:11:47,906 --> 00:11:50,575
You're almost right on time.

258
00:11:54,278 --> 00:11:57,046
You can't mean me.

259
00:11:57,114 --> 00:12:01,451
Pan Am has the best
on-time schedule in the world.

260
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,152
That's a heck
of a dashboard.

261
00:12:03,221 --> 00:12:04,588
No driver?

262
00:12:04,655 --> 00:12:07,390
He's at lunch.

263
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:08,824
Very generous of you.

264
00:12:08,891 --> 00:12:10,292
Mm, I'm a giver.

265
00:12:12,329 --> 00:12:15,598
Got a, uh, crossword puzzle
in there anywhere?

266
00:12:15,665 --> 00:12:18,033
Five letters,
starts with "W,"

267
00:12:18,101 --> 00:12:19,735
rhymes with "song."

268
00:12:22,305 --> 00:12:25,373
Why don't you come in
out of the fog, captain?

269
00:12:37,953 --> 00:12:40,487
Is this how you reel
all your men in?

270
00:12:40,555 --> 00:12:42,889
No. Some of them can
open a door.

271
00:12:51,198 --> 00:12:53,333
- Ah, poor frogs.
- Can't get the language down,

272
00:12:53,401 --> 00:12:55,001
much less drive.

273
00:12:55,069 --> 00:12:56,236
Where's Niko?

274
00:12:56,303 --> 00:12:58,070
Where's your evil twin?

275
00:12:58,138 --> 00:13:01,907
Billiards... busywork for
the unemployed, if you ask me.

276
00:13:01,975 --> 00:13:03,175
Now darts...

277
00:13:03,243 --> 00:13:05,444
That's a proper pub game.

278
00:13:05,512 --> 00:13:06,579
There's a word
from the bird.

279
00:13:06,647 --> 00:13:10,583
Crickets then?
I'll spot you the 20.

280
00:13:10,651 --> 00:13:11,684
Hey.

281
00:13:11,752 --> 00:13:14,819
Didn't see you much
during the flight.

282
00:13:14,887 --> 00:13:16,521
Not at all
during the flight.

283
00:13:16,589 --> 00:13:19,424
Am I avoiding you,
or are you avoiding me?

284
00:13:19,492 --> 00:13:23,428
Ted, this...
really isn't the time.

285
00:13:33,672 --> 00:13:34,638
Thank you.

286
00:13:37,907 --> 00:13:39,229
- Ohh!
- Oh.

287
00:13:39,309 --> 00:13:40,234
Where are you headed?

288
00:13:40,235 --> 00:13:42,524
Besides into a wall if you
don't lower that thing.

289
00:13:42,573 --> 00:13:44,574
What are you doing here
on your day off?

290
00:13:44,642 --> 00:13:46,341
Just trying to stay
out of trouble.

291
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:47,910
Cashing my check.

292
00:13:47,978 --> 00:13:49,912
Where are you...
Where are you headed?

293
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,814
133rd and 7th.

294
00:13:51,882 --> 00:13:53,749
- Harlem.
- Business.

295
00:13:53,817 --> 00:13:55,484
You're kidding, right?

296
00:13:55,551 --> 00:13:57,119
I can't have business
in Harlem?

297
00:13:57,187 --> 00:13:58,888
Should you?

298
00:13:58,955 --> 00:14:00,989
I learned the subway system.
I can find my way down there.

299
00:14:01,056 --> 00:14:01,820
It's not down.

300
00:14:01,821 --> 00:14:04,492
It's up, and I'd hate to
see you lose all this.

301
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:06,294
Oh.

302
00:14:06,361 --> 00:14:07,929
Okay. Up?

303
00:14:07,997 --> 00:14:10,098
Nighttime in Harlem... I'm sure
you'll blend in beautifully.

304
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:11,833
That's not
a very nice attitude.

305
00:14:11,901 --> 00:14:13,968
It's exactly what
you're gonna need up there.

306
00:14:14,036 --> 00:14:16,704
Ted... it's personal.

307
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:18,505
- You mean a female thing?
- No.

308
00:14:18,572 --> 00:14:20,573
Well, then what the hell?
I'll come along.

309
00:14:20,641 --> 00:14:22,042
I haven't been to Harlem
in days.

310
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:24,411
Fine.

311
00:14:24,478 --> 00:14:27,047
But I really don't wanna
talk about it. Understood?

312
00:14:27,115 --> 00:14:28,215
Understood.

313
00:14:32,753 --> 00:14:34,353
We've flown
Pan Am brass before,

314
00:14:34,421 --> 00:14:35,988
but never
a senior vice president.

315
00:14:36,056 --> 00:14:38,958
Yeah, that's a very nice
lapel pin there, Mr. Henson.

316
00:14:39,026 --> 00:14:41,127
Consolation prize
for the Pan Am executives.

317
00:14:41,195 --> 00:14:42,394
We wanted wings.

318
00:14:43,797 --> 00:14:44,763
Just kidding.

319
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,900
I'm sorry she's so late.

320
00:14:48,968 --> 00:14:50,401
Not a good sign
in a secretary.

321
00:14:50,469 --> 00:14:52,037
She has many
positive attributes,

322
00:14:52,104 --> 00:14:53,437
promptness not
being one of them.

323
00:14:53,438 --> 00:14:54,339
What time do you have?

324
00:14:54,406 --> 00:14:55,911
Uh, sorry, I'm not
wearing my watch.

325
00:14:55,912 --> 00:14:57,375
What, you don't
have your rolex on?

326
00:14:57,443 --> 00:14:59,711
- I thought you slept in that thing.
- Well, I stopped wearing mine, too.

327
00:14:59,778 --> 00:15:02,214
Much easier to ask someone.

328
00:15:02,281 --> 00:15:05,182
Ah, she deigns to join us.

329
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:08,485
Oh. Sorry.

330
00:15:08,553 --> 00:15:10,054
So sorry.

331
00:15:10,121 --> 00:15:11,688
Do we have enough room here?

332
00:15:11,756 --> 00:15:13,190
Yes, of course.

333
00:15:13,258 --> 00:15:14,458
Okay.

334
00:15:16,661 --> 00:15:19,830
Okay, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go warm things up.

335
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:24,033
Secretary, my ass.

336
00:15:24,101 --> 00:15:25,335
No, it's possible.
Lot of businessmen

337
00:15:25,402 --> 00:15:26,336
travel with their secretaries.

338
00:15:26,403 --> 00:15:28,371
First class ticket?

339
00:15:28,438 --> 00:15:29,705
Mink coat?

340
00:15:29,773 --> 00:15:31,374
The shopping bags?
No steno pads.

341
00:15:31,441 --> 00:15:33,743
She's not his secretary.
She's his mistress.

342
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:37,212
Yeah, I guess most secretaries
don't drive around in Bentleys.

343
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:44,853
Oh, my God. You cashed in on the jujubes.

344
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:49,090
You know, I would never
encourage you to...

345
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:50,558
With...

346
00:15:50,626 --> 00:15:54,362
- It's the vice president.
- I don't plan on telling him.

347
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:56,698
Could be worse.
You could have jujubed his wife.

348
00:15:56,766 --> 00:15:58,132
That is <i>not</i> worse.

349
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,667
A wife is the block
he grew up on.

350
00:15:59,735 --> 00:16:01,535
A mistress is where
he's living now.

351
00:16:01,603 --> 00:16:02,870
Well...

352
00:16:02,937 --> 00:16:07,107
You want the left seat, Ted.
This could be your chance.

353
00:16:20,882 --> 00:16:22,516
Oh, I've been
to a casino before,

354
00:16:22,584 --> 00:16:26,354
- just not one in Monte Carlo.
- Really? What's your game?

355
00:16:26,421 --> 00:16:29,357
I don't know. Something where
I won't lose a lot of money.

356
00:16:29,424 --> 00:16:31,525
Oh, in that case,
I have the perfect system.

357
00:16:31,593 --> 00:16:32,793
You'll never lose.

358
00:16:32,861 --> 00:16:36,730
Mm. And you'll, uh, teach me
this perfect system.

359
00:16:36,797 --> 00:16:39,198
It's very simple.
Stay out of the casino.

360
00:16:41,268 --> 00:16:45,204
Sorry, Kate. There's been
a slight change of plans.

361
00:16:45,272 --> 00:16:46,373
Laura's moving up
to first,

362
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,375
so you'll be covering
economy today.

363
00:16:51,745 --> 00:16:54,079
Hmm.

364
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:00,853
You've been called up
to the big leagues.

365
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,088
Odd that Maggie
reassigned you.

366
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:05,490
Oh, yes, it's very odd.

367
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:09,894
A woman scorned.

368
00:17:09,961 --> 00:17:11,362
Sends the other one
to the kitchen.

369
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:17,602
Laura, I know you'll do
the right thing with Greg.

370
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:19,236
Whoa!

371
00:17:22,872 --> 00:17:23,632
Right then and there

372
00:17:23,633 --> 00:17:25,609
with the groom standing
outside in a penguin suit?

373
00:17:25,676 --> 00:17:27,744
That lady looks like
she's about to fall.

374
00:17:27,812 --> 00:17:29,473
- Should we wake her up?
- Oh, God, no.

375
00:17:29,474 --> 00:17:31,314
Second rule of the subway...
Never wake anybody up.

376
00:17:31,382 --> 00:17:32,449
What's the first rule?

377
00:17:32,517 --> 00:17:33,583
Take a cab.

378
00:17:33,651 --> 00:17:35,752
- What a wuss.
- Who?

379
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,954
Craig. You never let
the bride bolt on you.

380
00:17:38,022 --> 00:17:39,923
<i>You</i> bolt on the bride.

381
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:42,125
<i>- 72nd street.</i> 
- Greg. Anyway...

382
00:17:42,192 --> 00:17:44,294
<i>Next stop, 145th street.
</i> I moved in with Kate that same night.

383
00:17:44,361 --> 00:17:45,628
I didn't have any money...

384
00:17:45,695 --> 00:17:48,431
So I pawned
the engagement ring.

385
00:17:48,498 --> 00:17:51,767
Ohh. That's a dagger
through a fella's heart.

386
00:17:51,835 --> 00:17:56,638
Thank you, Ted. I already know
I'm a horrible person.

387
00:17:56,705 --> 00:17:57,906
I could just kick myself.

388
00:17:57,974 --> 00:17:59,695
Well, you had to eat, right?

389
00:17:59,696 --> 00:18:01,109
I'm sure at the time,

390
00:18:01,177 --> 00:18:03,812
a short-term pawn seemed
like a pretty good idea.

391
00:18:03,879 --> 00:18:06,616
Well, that's what I thought until
they sold it to a man in Harlem.

392
00:18:06,617 --> 00:18:07,882
I mean, they can just do that?

393
00:18:07,951 --> 00:18:09,418
It's in
the "how to pawn" manual.

394
00:18:09,485 --> 00:18:11,419
See,
now they didn't give me a...

395
00:18:12,787 --> 00:18:13,787
Oh.

396
00:18:13,855 --> 00:18:16,223
Anyway, Greg's coming
to New York,

397
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:18,993
and I want things
definitively over.

398
00:18:19,061 --> 00:18:20,394
I need to give
the ring back.

399
00:18:20,462 --> 00:18:21,607
He didn't hear "definitive"

400
00:18:21,608 --> 00:18:23,431
when you hurdled
yourself off that altar?

401
00:18:23,498 --> 00:18:25,799
Yes, but when he came
to Paris...

402
00:18:25,867 --> 00:18:27,733
He followed you to Paris?
Pathetic. Craig is Bambi.

403
00:18:27,801 --> 00:18:29,602
It's Greg,
and he's not pathetic.

404
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:31,571
He's actually
quite romantic.

405
00:18:31,638 --> 00:18:33,173
Well, see, that was
his first mistake.

406
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,775
I mean, look at history.
Antony and Cleopatra,

407
00:18:35,843 --> 00:18:37,743
Samson and Delilah,
Pepe le Pew...

408
00:18:37,811 --> 00:18:40,981
All of them brought down
by romance.

409
00:18:41,048 --> 00:18:42,747
Well, he was really
very sweet.

410
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:45,351
You know, he saved up,

411
00:18:45,418 --> 00:18:48,887
bought the ring,
found the right moment.

412
00:18:50,457 --> 00:18:52,591
Oh, God, I really am
a horrible person.

413
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,128
Oh!

414
00:18:56,196 --> 00:18:59,998
Was your whole relationship
this much fun?

415
00:19:07,206 --> 00:19:08,606
Can I help you,
Mr. Henson?

416
00:19:08,673 --> 00:19:10,708
A blanket, please.

417
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:12,477
She doesn't like to share.

418
00:19:15,013 --> 00:19:17,547
Thank you.

419
00:19:28,859 --> 00:19:30,893
<i>There'll be a man</i>
<i>on your next flight...</i>

420
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,828
<i>Niko Lonza, U.N. attache.</i>

421
00:19:32,896 --> 00:19:35,964
<i>Mr. Lonza will be gambling</i>
<i>with a friend of his...</i>

422
00:19:36,033 --> 00:19:38,734
<i>A friend who is currently</i>
<i>seeing an Italian woman</i>

423
00:19:38,801 --> 00:19:41,203
<i>who goes by the name</i>
<i>of Lena Bracca.</i>

424
00:19:41,271 --> 00:19:45,107
<i>She's a Soviet agent.</i>
<i>We'll need her fingerprints.</i>

425
00:19:47,576 --> 00:19:48,843
Where am I
going to find shoes?

426
00:19:48,911 --> 00:19:50,978
Does he know
all the games?

427
00:19:51,047 --> 00:19:52,480
Well, I... he must.

428
00:19:52,548 --> 00:19:54,582
I mean, he gambles here ever
year with a friend.

429
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:56,984
He won $2,000 at roulette
last year.

430
00:19:57,053 --> 00:19:58,719
So you can only imagine.

431
00:19:58,787 --> 00:20:00,288
I was shocked when he asked me.

432
00:20:00,356 --> 00:20:03,524
<i>Le casino Cote d'Azur...</i>
<i>Magnifique.</i>

433
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:30,916
Want to go for a ride?

434
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:37,222
I think I've already been
taken for one.

435
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:40,258
Well, maybe this one
will be better.

436
00:20:40,326 --> 00:20:43,261
It's hard to see
that happening.

437
00:20:44,763 --> 00:20:49,201
Unless, of course,
uh... I drive.

438
00:20:52,437 --> 00:20:54,938
I'm in your hands, captain.

439
00:20:57,342 --> 00:20:59,410
Have Ted and Dean
even checked in yet?

440
00:20:59,478 --> 00:21:02,913
I think they're still
drooling over those sports cars.

441
00:21:02,981 --> 00:21:07,150
Boys and their toys...
a timeless love story.

442
00:21:07,218 --> 00:21:09,552
- Colette.
- There you are.

443
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:12,222
Anyone for a guilty pleasure?

444
00:21:12,289 --> 00:21:13,423
How guilty?

445
00:21:13,491 --> 00:21:15,592
700 francs.

446
00:21:15,659 --> 00:21:17,727
No pleasure in that.

447
00:21:17,794 --> 00:21:18,995
No kidding.

448
00:21:20,864 --> 00:21:23,999
I'm off to saner pastures.

449
00:21:31,574 --> 00:21:33,808
I do like that hat
in the corner.

450
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:36,178
Oh, and that bag.

451
00:21:36,246 --> 00:21:37,412
The bag and the hat.

452
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,580
- The cat in the hat?
- Ted.

453
00:21:41,517 --> 00:21:43,251
Do you have time
to talk?

454
00:21:43,318 --> 00:21:45,519
I have plans with Kate.

455
00:21:45,586 --> 00:21:47,287
Does she know that?

456
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:50,691
Ted, it's fine.
You don't need to apologize.

457
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:51,992
Who's apologizing?

458
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,093
You ought to be.

459
00:21:53,161 --> 00:21:54,294
You just said
I didn't have to.

460
00:21:54,362 --> 00:21:55,863
Because I assumed
you knew you should.

461
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:57,965
For trying to protect you?

462
00:21:58,033 --> 00:21:59,733
Which is not at all
what you did, is it?

463
00:22:02,069 --> 00:22:03,435
Y...

464
00:22:06,006 --> 00:22:07,874
I can't explain myself.

465
00:22:07,941 --> 00:22:09,441
I was drawn to the man.

466
00:22:09,509 --> 00:22:12,145
You never said a word to Niko
before the pub in London.

467
00:22:12,212 --> 00:22:13,479
It was sudden.

468
00:22:13,547 --> 00:22:15,181
I didn't really speak to him
on that first flight.

469
00:22:15,248 --> 00:22:17,615
Let's talk about flights.

470
00:22:17,684 --> 00:22:19,818
I've never been a big fan
of breakfast...

471
00:22:19,886 --> 00:22:22,854
All those first class eggs
made to order.

472
00:22:24,422 --> 00:22:25,724
All right.

473
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:29,327
You cancel your date with Niko,
and those eggs go away.

474
00:22:29,395 --> 00:22:31,229
- For a month.
- A week.

475
00:22:31,297 --> 00:22:33,064
- Three.
- Week and a half.

476
00:22:33,131 --> 00:22:34,665
Two and a half,
and we're done.

477
00:22:34,733 --> 00:22:36,067
Done.

478
00:22:36,134 --> 00:22:37,367
Excellent.

479
00:22:38,135 --> 00:22:40,604
Quick whiz,
then a few more shots,

480
00:22:40,672 --> 00:22:41,839
and I'm off to get gorgeous.

481
00:22:41,907 --> 00:22:43,040
Don't wear yourself out.

482
00:22:43,108 --> 00:22:46,610
I'm Irish.
I'll pick you up at 8:00.

483
00:22:46,678 --> 00:22:48,579
That's your date?

484
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:52,548
Smile. Niko's worth it.

485
00:22:59,824 --> 00:23:02,192
Too bad we don't have
a camera.

486
00:23:02,259 --> 00:23:04,227
Oh, but we do.

487
00:23:14,204 --> 00:23:15,137
I was a girl scout.

488
00:23:15,205 --> 00:23:16,138
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

489
00:23:16,206 --> 00:23:18,406
As in "be prepared"?

490
00:23:18,474 --> 00:23:21,709
Yep.

491
00:23:21,777 --> 00:23:24,946
Yes, I would say
that you are prepared...

492
00:23:25,013 --> 00:23:28,182
For everything except say...

493
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:32,286
Telling me about a man
named Everett Henson

494
00:23:32,354 --> 00:23:35,557
or his profession, which is...

495
00:23:35,558 --> 00:23:38,759
Oh, yeah, airline executive.

496
00:23:38,826 --> 00:23:41,361
I had the impression you liked
the element of surprise.

497
00:23:41,428 --> 00:23:42,963
You could've filled me in
a bit more on your life

498
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:44,397
beyond "Miss Drag Race."

499
00:23:44,465 --> 00:23:47,200
I suppose.
On the other hand,

500
00:23:47,268 --> 00:23:49,435
"hey, Ginny, you said
you weren't rich.

501
00:23:49,503 --> 00:23:50,737
"Didn't mention a job,

502
00:23:50,805 --> 00:23:53,672
"yet you wear a mink coat,
fly to London, Monte Carlo,

503
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:54,874
"shop at Harrods.

504
00:23:54,941 --> 00:23:57,342
You inherit a ton of money?"

505
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:59,444
See, I always figure

506
00:23:59,512 --> 00:24:02,648
that when someone doesn't ask
you anything about your life,

507
00:24:02,715 --> 00:24:06,018
anything about what's
staring them right in the face,

508
00:24:06,086 --> 00:24:08,187
they don't really
wanna know.

509
00:24:08,255 --> 00:24:09,788
That wouldn't be you,
would it?

510
00:24:16,728 --> 00:24:20,698
Oh. Masterpiece.
It's museum quality.

511
00:24:20,766 --> 00:24:22,801
Don't show it to Everett.

512
00:24:22,868 --> 00:24:26,536
He doesn't like anyone
touching the car.

513
00:24:26,604 --> 00:24:28,338
You mean like this?

514
00:24:31,475 --> 00:24:34,311
You know,
I do accept payment.

515
00:24:34,378 --> 00:24:36,680
This, however,
will not be enough.

516
00:24:36,747 --> 00:24:37,815
No?

517
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,187
Still here.

518
00:24:49,255 --> 00:24:50,622
You're not getting
rid of me, Philippe.

519
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:52,357
Miss Cameron, I reiterate...

520
00:24:52,425 --> 00:24:54,825
We cannot release information
about our guests.

521
00:24:54,893 --> 00:24:56,260
And I cannot be ready
to go to the casino

522
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,662
if I don't know what time
Mr. Lonza's car is arriving.

523
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,398
Perhaps you should ask him.

524
00:25:00,465 --> 00:25:02,266
Philippe, it's a surprise.

525
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:03,834
He doesn't know
that I've flown in.

526
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:05,436
I'm sure he doesn't.

527
00:25:06,738 --> 00:25:08,872
A tear? Hmm?
Would that help?

528
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,706
Because I can do that.

529
00:25:10,774 --> 00:25:13,443
Please, no, do not.
Christophe? Christophe?

530
00:25:14,878 --> 00:25:18,014
<i>...Que monsieur Lonza</i>

531
00:25:18,082 --> 00:25:20,417
<i>besoins sa voiture</i>
<i>a vingt heures precises.</i>

532
00:25:20,484 --> 00:25:22,952
<i>Maintenant, s'il vous plait.</i>
<i>Parlez-vous francais?</i>

533
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:24,087
8:00.

534
00:25:24,155 --> 00:25:25,555
What ever
are you talking about?

535
00:25:25,622 --> 00:25:28,123
Ah, Phillipe, <i>merci, merci.</i>
<i>Je suis...</i>

536
00:25:28,191 --> 00:25:31,360
Oh, it's 7:15.
Thank you so much.

537
00:25:32,495 --> 00:25:33,695
Well, thanks a lot, Kate.

538
00:25:33,763 --> 00:25:35,464
You just left me here
talking to myself

539
00:25:35,532 --> 00:25:37,266
like a lunatic right in this
very spot, as a matter of fact.

540
00:25:37,333 --> 00:25:39,701
Laura, Laura, focus.
Can you do that?

541
00:25:39,769 --> 00:25:40,902
I'm not 12.

542
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:43,304
How much money
do you have on you?

543
00:25:45,307 --> 00:25:47,741
As you can see, Mr. Bodine,

544
00:25:47,809 --> 00:25:49,377
I have your receipt
of purchase.

545
00:25:49,445 --> 00:25:51,011
Call me "shoot man."

546
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,481
Uh... sh-shoot man?

547
00:25:53,549 --> 00:25:56,317
Come on now.
Don't shy away from it.

548
00:25:56,385 --> 00:25:58,351
- Shoot man.
- Shoot man.

549
00:25:58,419 --> 00:26:00,353
- Shoot man.
- Shoot man.

550
00:26:00,421 --> 00:26:01,354
- Shoot man!
- Shoot man!

551
00:26:01,422 --> 00:26:03,790
- There it is.
- Thank you.

552
00:26:03,857 --> 00:26:06,960
As I was saying,
I'm prepared to offer you $50

553
00:26:07,027 --> 00:26:08,295
more than you originally
paid for the ring...

554
00:26:08,362 --> 00:26:11,331
"Tasty pudding."

555
00:26:11,399 --> 00:26:13,900
Track two, side "B,"
"tasty pudding."

556
00:26:13,968 --> 00:26:16,902
White boy blows so smooth,
you got to dig it.

557
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:20,072
You certainly do. I wish
I'd seen him jam with Mulligan.

558
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:22,108
I'm sorry. Mr. Bodine...

559
00:26:22,175 --> 00:26:23,242
Ah, Shoot man.

560
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:25,411
- Shoot man...
- Do you dig "tasty pudding"?

561
00:26:25,479 --> 00:26:28,747
I, uh, yes, I do.
I-I dig the... tasty pudding.

562
00:26:28,815 --> 00:26:32,617
But what I would really, really
like to discuss is the ring...

563
00:26:32,684 --> 00:26:33,751
The ring ain't for sale.

564
00:26:33,819 --> 00:26:34,952
Excuse me?

565
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:37,122
Man buys a ring,
he means business.

566
00:26:39,658 --> 00:26:42,727
Well, there's business,
and there's business,

567
00:26:42,794 --> 00:26:44,129
couple extra C-notes.

568
00:26:44,196 --> 00:26:46,763
I don't have that much on me
today, but I can...

569
00:26:46,831 --> 00:26:47,998
No way.

570
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:51,168
Well, I guess it ain't
that important.

571
00:26:51,236 --> 00:26:52,902
Ted, hush.

572
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:54,738
Shoot man is
taking advantage of you.

573
00:26:54,805 --> 00:26:56,940
Some people might call it
supply and demand,

574
00:26:57,008 --> 00:26:59,309
but if that's how he feel,
then...

575
00:26:59,377 --> 00:27:02,112
Sorry, little lady.
Deal's off.

576
00:27:02,179 --> 00:27:04,813
I can't leave empty-handed.

577
00:27:05,815 --> 00:27:07,650
In all fairness,

578
00:27:07,717 --> 00:27:11,120
you... you did say that
you liked the tasty pudding.

579
00:27:11,188 --> 00:27:12,855
<i>Downtown 2 train approaching.</i>

580
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:14,089
What?

581
00:27:14,158 --> 00:27:15,858
<i>Downtown number 2 train</i>
<i>approaching.</i>

582
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:18,127
Hey! Hey! Hey!

583
00:27:18,194 --> 00:27:20,462
Hey! Wait! Knock it off!
What is your problem?

584
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:23,465
You!
You... usurped me.

585
00:27:23,533 --> 00:27:24,633
I usurped you?

586
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:27,369
I was this close to getting
the ring back.

587
00:27:27,436 --> 00:27:29,371
You were this close
to being played.

588
00:27:29,438 --> 00:27:30,872
It wasn't about the money!

589
00:27:30,939 --> 00:27:32,507
I was trying to make things
right with Greg

590
00:27:32,575 --> 00:27:35,309
so he could move on,
so I could move on.

591
00:27:35,377 --> 00:27:36,977
And you messed it all up.

592
00:27:37,045 --> 00:27:40,714
You are...
a horrible person.

593
00:27:40,782 --> 00:27:42,549
I thought you were
the horrible person.

594
00:27:43,851 --> 00:27:46,953
Fine. Sure.
Run away.

595
00:27:47,021 --> 00:27:48,855
Where are you going?

596
00:27:48,923 --> 00:27:50,891
First rule of the subway,
Ted.

597
00:27:50,958 --> 00:27:54,327
Taxi? Taxi!

598
00:27:55,930 --> 00:27:58,630
Where have <i>you</i> been?

599
00:27:58,699 --> 00:27:59,899
Sightseeing.

600
00:27:59,966 --> 00:28:02,601
Ho ho.
I don't want to know.

601
00:28:02,669 --> 00:28:05,370
Oh. Oh. Wrong door, huh?
Hate that.

602
00:28:05,438 --> 00:28:07,673
Your fly's open.

603
00:28:12,378 --> 00:28:15,080
Keys. Keys.

604
00:28:15,147 --> 00:28:16,614
Oh, no.

605
00:28:33,064 --> 00:28:36,233
Hey! Hey, you! W...

606
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:39,203
- Mr. Henson.
- Captain Lowrey?

607
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:41,939
You're out of uniform,
Captain.

608
00:28:42,006 --> 00:28:44,074
What are you doing
down here?

609
00:28:44,142 --> 00:28:46,675
Oh, just dropping off
a car for a friend,

610
00:28:46,744 --> 00:28:49,278
and, I, uh, I noticed
this beauty. You?

611
00:28:49,346 --> 00:28:50,679
Well, this beauty is mine.

612
00:28:50,748 --> 00:28:52,548
- Oh, yeah?
- I'm sorry about yelling.

613
00:28:52,616 --> 00:28:53,950
I didn't know who was
doing what over here.

614
00:28:54,017 --> 00:28:55,785
No, I don't blame you.
Don't blame you.

615
00:28:55,853 --> 00:28:58,354
Wow. These doors...
Solid, huh?

616
00:28:58,421 --> 00:28:59,588
Your hand, Captain.

617
00:28:59,656 --> 00:29:01,523
You're like me, huh?

618
00:29:01,591 --> 00:29:03,558
Keep your greasy fingers
off my car.

619
00:29:03,626 --> 00:29:06,427
Annoying as hell, isn't it?

620
00:29:12,068 --> 00:29:15,036
Yeah, I'd love to...
love to take it for a spin.

621
00:29:15,104 --> 00:29:17,605
Sure. We'll get on that.

622
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:18,906
Tomorrow.

623
00:29:34,421 --> 00:29:35,354
Ginny.

624
00:29:35,422 --> 00:29:37,157
Dean.

625
00:29:37,224 --> 00:29:39,125
- Key.
- From the front desk.

626
00:29:39,193 --> 00:29:41,895
Key.
From under the front seat.

627
00:29:41,962 --> 00:29:43,362
Allow me.

628
00:29:44,598 --> 00:29:47,633
How did you find it?

629
00:29:47,701 --> 00:29:50,769
Well, I told you.
I pay attention.

630
00:29:52,705 --> 00:29:54,006
<i>When</i> did you find it?

631
00:29:54,073 --> 00:29:55,808
Before Everett could.

632
00:29:55,875 --> 00:29:57,575
You know, you were right.

633
00:29:57,643 --> 00:30:01,379
He doesn't like
people touching his car.

634
00:30:25,175 --> 00:30:28,043
You look ready
for a night on the town.

635
00:30:29,745 --> 00:30:32,080
You, too.

636
00:30:32,148 --> 00:30:34,382
All dressed up,
and nowhere to go.

637
00:30:34,449 --> 00:30:36,284
My friends' car
broke down in Nice.

638
00:30:36,351 --> 00:30:39,654
Well, and that's not
Monte Carlo's fault.

639
00:30:39,722 --> 00:30:42,322
Hmm.

640
00:31:11,051 --> 00:31:12,585
I'm so sorry, <i>caro.</i>

641
00:31:12,652 --> 00:31:14,614
Cars, taxi, tourists...
Everywhere.

642
00:31:14,615 --> 00:31:17,189
<i>O gli americani che non sanno
leggere i segnali stradali.</i>

643
00:31:17,256 --> 00:31:18,423
<i>Voglio da bere.</i>

644
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:19,925
This must be Lena?

645
00:31:19,992 --> 00:31:23,695
Niko, at last. I have heard
so much about you.

646
00:31:23,763 --> 00:31:24,963
And I've heard
about you.

647
00:31:25,031 --> 00:31:27,132
This is Kate from New York.

648
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,900
Oh, I love Manhattan...

649
00:31:28,968 --> 00:31:30,667
The shopping,
almost as good as Roma.

650
00:31:30,736 --> 00:31:34,872
Lena, it's so nice to meet you.
I'm sorry. There was traffic?

651
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:38,075
All is fine, thank you.
Remy, is there only champagne?

652
00:31:38,143 --> 00:31:40,845
Is there no Chardonnay?
<i>Non c'e</i> Moscato?

653
00:31:40,912 --> 00:31:43,714
<i>A quanto pare lasciano entrare</i>
<i>chiunque di questi tempi.</i>

654
00:31:43,782 --> 00:31:46,482
I think we're just gonna have
some champagne. That's fine.

655
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:48,985
Oh, uh, I think Lena has
the right idea.

656
00:31:49,053 --> 00:31:50,787
I-I'd love wine, too.

657
00:31:52,289 --> 00:31:54,224
Chardonnay?
Sauvignon Blanc?

658
00:31:54,291 --> 00:31:57,227
Oh, I'd prefer something red.

659
00:31:57,294 --> 00:32:00,997
Lena, I am so sorry.
I can be such a klutz sometimes.

660
00:32:01,065 --> 00:32:04,133
Oh, no, no, don't do that.
Hot water will set the stain.

661
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,034
I have club soda.

662
00:32:06,102 --> 00:32:09,604
It's a-a gift from the gods.
It's like an eraser.

663
00:32:09,672 --> 00:32:13,142
We use it all the time
for our passengers.

664
00:32:13,209 --> 00:32:16,444
- I'm a stewardess...
- for Pan Am.

665
00:32:18,647 --> 00:32:20,982
If I can't make those
look brand-spanking new,

666
00:32:21,049 --> 00:32:22,817
I'll get you a new pair...

667
00:32:22,885 --> 00:32:24,051
From New York.

668
00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:26,420
Please.
Let me make up for it.

669
00:32:26,488 --> 00:32:28,656
<i>Schifosa.</i>

670
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,768
Excuse me, bartender?

671
00:32:41,836 --> 00:32:44,337
Yes, sir. May I help you?

672
00:32:44,405 --> 00:32:47,607
I would like to have a glass
of something red, I think.

673
00:32:47,675 --> 00:32:50,876
Perhaps
the '57 Chateau Capet-Guillier.

674
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:53,578
Oh, that's
an excellent Bordeaux, sir.

675
00:32:53,646 --> 00:32:56,315
And also,
instead of having a glass,

676
00:32:56,382 --> 00:32:59,351
I would like to have
a bottle,

677
00:32:59,419 --> 00:33:00,885
if you will join me.

678
00:33:03,989 --> 00:33:08,193
I think I will save
this bottle as a...

679
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,961
What do you call it?

680
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:12,698
A keepsake?
Memento?

681
00:33:12,765 --> 00:33:14,598
Both.

682
00:33:14,666 --> 00:33:16,467
It was an accident.

683
00:33:16,535 --> 00:33:19,070
Accident, blessing,
good fortune.

684
00:33:19,138 --> 00:33:21,772
You know what?
I think Remy will thank us.

685
00:33:21,841 --> 00:33:23,374
Thank <i>you.</i>

686
00:33:23,442 --> 00:33:24,542
I could see it
from the beginning.

687
00:33:24,609 --> 00:33:26,110
Not a good match.

688
00:33:26,178 --> 00:33:27,312
You just met her.

689
00:33:27,379 --> 00:33:28,947
Well, I have a good eye
for people.

690
00:33:36,321 --> 00:33:40,023
Oof.
No, he'll never make his 11.

691
00:33:40,091 --> 00:33:41,291
Not impossible.

692
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:43,426
Mmm, he can't thread.
He can't kiss.

693
00:33:43,494 --> 00:33:46,830
Nothing worse
than a bad kisser.

694
00:33:47,797 --> 00:33:49,966
What do you wanna bet that not
a single one of those men

695
00:33:50,033 --> 00:33:52,502
have ever played
against a girl?

696
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:55,437
I would take that bet.

697
00:34:48,877 --> 00:34:51,379
What'd you wish for?

698
00:34:51,447 --> 00:34:52,647
Do-over.

699
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:55,583
Oh, power over time and space.
Quite a penny.

700
00:34:55,651 --> 00:34:58,319
10 francs.

701
00:34:58,387 --> 00:35:00,755
Well, I-in that case,
uh...

702
00:35:02,156 --> 00:35:04,057
My engagement ring?

703
00:35:04,125 --> 00:35:07,294
You have another 10 francs?
I'll go for world peace.

704
00:35:07,362 --> 00:35:08,862
You've had it
this whole time?

705
00:35:08,929 --> 00:35:11,898
- I tried to get your attention.
- This whole time?

706
00:35:11,909 --> 00:35:14,312
A guy's gotta pick the right
moment to give a girl a ring.

707
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,067
Wow.

708
00:35:18,087 --> 00:35:19,847
That might have been
the worst thing

709
00:35:19,848 --> 00:35:21,655
I could have possibly
said right now.

710
00:35:21,723 --> 00:35:25,326
Maybe I <i>am</i>
a horrible person.

711
00:35:25,394 --> 00:35:27,895
Just thoughtless sometimes.

712
00:35:31,333 --> 00:35:34,701
Getting into it
was so easy...

713
00:35:34,768 --> 00:35:36,903
Flower arrangements,
bridesmaids dresses.

714
00:35:36,971 --> 00:35:40,073
Getting out?

715
00:35:40,141 --> 00:35:42,242
That part
I really messed up.

716
00:35:44,445 --> 00:35:49,081
The suspense is over.
You're not perfect.

717
00:35:53,453 --> 00:35:55,387
How did you talk Shoot man
into it?

718
00:35:55,455 --> 00:35:56,955
Oh.

719
00:35:57,023 --> 00:35:58,457
The thing with musicians

720
00:35:58,525 --> 00:36:00,759
is you gotta start off
on the right foot,

721
00:36:00,827 --> 00:36:06,265
which, in this case, was, uh,
"what time you got?"

722
00:36:07,533 --> 00:36:10,635
Oh, God. Your Rolex?

723
00:36:20,879 --> 00:36:23,514
Thank you
for choosing Pan Am. Good night.

724
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:25,415
Bye-bye.

725
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:27,117
- Ladies.
- Captain.

726
00:36:29,154 --> 00:36:30,220
Good to be back in New York.

727
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:32,856
Yeah.

728
00:36:32,923 --> 00:36:34,090
Did you lose something?

729
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:36,726
I thought I had
a tin of aspirin.

730
00:36:36,794 --> 00:36:39,362
Monte Carlo,
always too much of a party.

731
00:36:39,429 --> 00:36:42,165
It's too much of something.

732
00:36:42,232 --> 00:36:44,534
High wire, perhaps.

733
00:36:44,601 --> 00:36:47,036
Always loved
walking it myself.

734
00:36:47,103 --> 00:36:49,872
Although sometimes...

735
00:36:49,939 --> 00:36:51,340
It's helpful
to have a net.

736
00:36:51,408 --> 00:36:53,008
Now where's the fun
in that?

737
00:36:53,076 --> 00:36:57,111
Captain, there you are.
I thought we missed you.

738
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,380
Ah, I got you this far.

739
00:36:58,447 --> 00:36:59,881
You'll have to do the rest
on your own.

740
00:36:59,948 --> 00:37:02,817
If you ever need anything...

741
00:37:02,885 --> 00:37:04,152
From the inside.

742
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:05,487
Yeah. And...

743
00:37:05,555 --> 00:37:08,490
If you ever need anything
from 35,000 feet...

744
00:37:08,658 --> 00:37:09,528
Okay.

745
00:37:09,529 --> 00:37:12,193
Should probably keep one
of these on hand, too.

746
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:15,262
Yes. I definitely will.

747
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:16,863
Thank you.

748
00:37:16,931 --> 00:37:18,399
Absolutely.

749
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:44,912
Keep it running.

750
00:37:44,937 --> 00:37:47,371
- I'll only be a few minutes.
- Yes, ma'am.

751
00:38:21,481 --> 00:38:23,281
- For me?
- Well, it's the least we can do.

752
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:24,583
Apparently,
we don't pay you.

753
00:38:24,651 --> 00:38:27,353
Can't tell that Mr. Anderson
anything.

754
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:29,254
Ah, the lovely Lena.

755
00:38:29,322 --> 00:38:31,389
She was blonde
last I saw her.

756
00:38:31,457 --> 00:38:32,590
She mention
anything about Gdansk?

757
00:38:32,658 --> 00:38:33,891
Poland?

758
00:38:33,959 --> 00:38:36,394
Site of this year's
world fencing championship.

759
00:38:36,462 --> 00:38:38,295
Interesting cover
for a spy convention.

760
00:38:38,364 --> 00:38:41,131
I'm pretty sure Lena's already
been to fencing school.

761
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:42,600
The fingerprints
should prove helpful.

762
00:38:42,668 --> 00:38:44,802
We'll be able to zero in
on the nine aliases

763
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:46,470
she's used
over the last two years.

764
00:38:46,537 --> 00:38:48,204
Nice work.

765
00:38:48,272 --> 00:38:49,506
An 8-year-old
could have done it.

766
00:38:49,574 --> 00:38:53,042
Did you get an invitation
to a casino?

767
00:38:55,713 --> 00:38:58,382
Good-looking guy.

768
00:38:58,449 --> 00:39:00,350
I take what you give me.

769
00:39:11,995 --> 00:39:15,364
Hey. You can get these
right here on the street.

770
00:39:15,432 --> 00:39:16,832
You've gotta love New York.

771
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:20,134
How was your, uh,
insurance... official?

772
00:39:20,202 --> 00:39:23,705
- Agent.
- We call them agents.

773
00:39:23,773 --> 00:39:26,474
I, uh, I couldn't
get out of there fast enough.

774
00:39:31,647 --> 00:39:33,047
So where are we going?

775
00:39:33,115 --> 00:39:34,180
Oh, just down the street.

776
00:39:34,248 --> 00:39:35,348
I'm betting we can find
a few men

777
00:39:35,417 --> 00:39:38,552
who've never played pool
against a girl.

778
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:40,453
I'll take that bet.
