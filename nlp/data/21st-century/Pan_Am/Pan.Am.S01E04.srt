1
00:00:00,529 --> 00:00:02,897
<i>Previously on "Pan Am"...</i>

2
00:00:02,965 --> 00:00:04,799
- You're gonna meet Kennedy?
- Tomorrow in Berlin.

3
00:00:06,235 --> 00:00:08,303
The secret police,
they know who I am.

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,905
Go to the U.S. mission.
If you go there, you can defect.

5
00:00:10,973 --> 00:00:13,208
You have no idea
what you've done

6
00:00:13,275 --> 00:00:16,043
nor what it takes
to keep a cold war cold.

7
00:00:18,612 --> 00:00:20,080
You're different
from other girls.

8
00:00:21,316 --> 00:00:23,317
Ask what you can do
for you country.

9
00:00:23,384 --> 00:00:25,819
<i>Freedom has many difficulties,</i>

10
00:00:25,887 --> 00:00:30,057
<i>but we have never had to put
a wall up to keep our people in.</i>

11
00:00:45,538 --> 00:00:47,006
Thank you.

12
00:00:47,074 --> 00:00:48,173
Who's up for a debriefing?

13
00:00:48,241 --> 00:00:49,908
- Ugh.
- We just got home.

14
00:00:49,976 --> 00:00:52,143
New York is a city of the world.

15
00:00:52,211 --> 00:00:53,511
Oh, no,
not that skinny boy

16
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:55,446
who can't carry a tune.

17
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:58,917
Bob Dylan is an artist.
I'll bet money he'll be famous.

18
00:00:58,985 --> 00:00:59,498
I'll go.

19
00:00:59,499 --> 00:01:01,552
No, we have a date
with the laundromat,

20
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,554
and we depart for Iceland
in 36 hours.

21
00:01:03,622 --> 00:01:05,122
Thank you very much,
miss Ryan.

22
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:08,192
I miss Bridget.
She was never too tired to play.

23
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:09,593
Has anyone heard from her?

24
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,828
- No, not a word.
- Strange.

25
00:01:11,897 --> 00:01:12,930
Good evening, ladies.

26
00:01:12,998 --> 00:01:14,098
Good night.

27
00:01:15,967 --> 00:01:18,435
Will wonders never
cease? She's still talking.

28
00:01:18,503 --> 00:01:19,870
She'll come to her senses.

29
00:01:19,937 --> 00:01:22,305
- She already did.
- What do you know?

30
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:25,808
It's the boy wonder
and his first officer.

31
00:01:25,876 --> 00:01:27,643
Howard.

32
00:01:27,711 --> 00:01:29,212
Tucking him into bed, Ted?

33
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,615
Right after I finish
cutting your food, captain.

34
00:01:32,682 --> 00:01:34,083
With your family connections,
I would have thought

35
00:01:34,151 --> 00:01:36,618
you would have been the one
to jump seniority.

36
00:01:38,421 --> 00:01:40,789
Have you read the paper?

37
00:01:40,856 --> 00:01:45,027
It's 1963.
A new generation leads.

38
00:01:46,362 --> 00:01:47,562
Careful, son.

39
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:51,699
The fierce itch of ambition
can be hard to scratch.

40
00:01:51,767 --> 00:01:55,803
We'll suffer through it,
captain.

41
00:02:00,342 --> 00:02:01,842
Uhh! Oh!

42
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:04,111
Laura! Let's go!
We're late!

43
00:02:04,179 --> 00:02:07,014
- I can't find my mittens!
- Will I need long underwear?

44
00:02:07,082 --> 00:02:09,049
If you'd make a list,
you wouldn't be scrambling!

45
00:02:09,116 --> 00:02:10,616
Just hurry up. We're late.

46
00:02:10,684 --> 00:02:12,518
I hope you're not lugging
all that on a subway.

47
00:02:12,586 --> 00:02:15,188
Well, if you would like
to hail us a cab...

48
00:02:15,256 --> 00:02:17,257
At your service.

49
00:02:17,325 --> 00:02:19,159
Richard.

50
00:02:19,226 --> 00:02:21,194
Do you have an extra pair
I could borrow?

51
00:02:21,262 --> 00:02:24,629
You won't need mittens
if I leave you behind!

52
00:02:24,697 --> 00:02:26,031
- Okay, okay!
- Did you get any of my messages?

53
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:30,135
Did you forget the part about us
only contacting you? Taxi!

54
00:02:30,203 --> 00:02:33,238
I know, but I wanted to explain
what happened in Berlin.

55
00:02:33,306 --> 00:02:34,373
I'm well aware
of what happened.

56
00:02:34,441 --> 00:02:35,874
I got stuck
with the paperwork.

57
00:02:35,942 --> 00:02:39,878
But you can sleep at night.
It was for a good cause, right?

58
00:02:39,946 --> 00:02:41,379
Kate, you you disobeyed
a direct order.

59
00:02:41,447 --> 00:02:44,983
I know. I overstepped.
It won't happen again.

60
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:46,451
I understand you saved
a girl's life,

61
00:02:46,518 --> 00:02:48,286
but you need to understand
that you are of no use to us

62
00:02:48,354 --> 00:02:49,887
if we can't rely on you.

63
00:02:49,955 --> 00:02:52,123
You can.

64
00:02:52,191 --> 00:02:54,859
I have really gotta
learn how to whistle.

65
00:02:54,926 --> 00:02:56,259
Ah. Here we go.

66
00:02:56,327 --> 00:02:58,195
Thought I was losing
my touch.

67
00:02:58,262 --> 00:03:01,664
So... will I get
another assignment?

68
00:03:03,601 --> 00:03:05,502
One sec.

69
00:03:05,569 --> 00:03:08,305
I need you to keep
your eyes open in rangoon.

70
00:03:08,373 --> 00:03:10,307
The agency might need you
to run an errand.

71
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:12,208
But we're not flying to Burma.

72
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:15,744
It's Reykjavik
and then onto Scandinavia!

73
00:03:17,547 --> 00:03:19,281
- Found them!
- I'll be right down!

74
00:03:19,349 --> 00:03:20,349
Laura?

75
00:03:20,417 --> 00:03:21,850
I said I'm coming!

76
00:03:21,918 --> 00:03:26,122
Forget your mittens!
Uh, grab a swimsuit!

77
00:03:29,558 --> 00:03:32,494
Sync and corrected by dr.jackson
for www.addic7ed.com

78
00:03:43,754 --> 00:03:46,154
Come on. Who did you
bribe in scheduling?

79
00:03:46,222 --> 00:03:48,723
It was a lucky guess.

80
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:51,059
That we'd be rerouted
to the orient?

81
00:03:51,127 --> 00:03:52,961
That I might need
a bikini.

82
00:03:53,028 --> 00:03:54,562
Anyone up for a swim?

83
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:57,298
Maybe in a year or two.

84
00:03:57,366 --> 00:03:58,666
I may cool off in a few minutes.

85
00:03:58,734 --> 00:04:00,668
Careful. She placed third

86
00:04:00,736 --> 00:04:02,469
in the Connecticut junior high
freestyle state finals.

87
00:04:02,536 --> 00:04:05,906
Only by a reach.
I have abnormally long arms.

88
00:04:05,974 --> 00:04:10,010
Oh, perfect. Reach over there
and pass me that cocoa butter.

89
00:04:10,078 --> 00:04:11,245
It's right next to you.

90
00:04:11,312 --> 00:04:12,746
I'm situated.

91
00:04:12,814 --> 00:04:13,814
Allow me.

92
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:20,352
My friend and I were hoping
you could settle a bet for us.

93
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,255
Yes, it's true.

94
00:04:22,322 --> 00:04:25,591
Guarantees deep,
lingering color.

95
00:04:25,659 --> 00:04:26,793
Ohh.

96
00:04:28,228 --> 00:04:29,195
We heard a rumor
that Pan Am stewardesses

97
00:04:29,263 --> 00:04:31,030
checked into the hotel
last night.

98
00:04:31,098 --> 00:04:33,631
Well, we heard a rumor there was
a naval wedding this morning.

99
00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:34,933
One of our R.I.O.S.

100
00:04:35,001 --> 00:04:36,334
You're stationed here?

101
00:04:36,402 --> 00:04:40,305
Saigon. We're teaching
the South Vietnamese how to fly.

102
00:04:40,372 --> 00:04:41,439
Ahem.

103
00:04:41,507 --> 00:04:44,442
Oh, sorry, friend.
Are they with you?

104
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,778
- For the day.
- Lucky man.

105
00:04:46,846 --> 00:04:49,646
You used to be a Navy man
once, Ted, weren't you?

106
00:04:49,714 --> 00:04:51,615
Everybody has to earn
their wings somewhere.

107
00:04:51,683 --> 00:04:53,017
Ah.
Former aviator?

108
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,718
- Current.
- He's our first officer.

109
00:04:54,786 --> 00:04:56,887
A co-pilot. Good for you.

110
00:04:56,955 --> 00:05:00,090
I earn five times more
flight hours, uh, in Pan Am

111
00:05:00,158 --> 00:05:02,359
than I did in the Navy,
and you can't beat my crew.

112
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:05,962
It's tempting. I'll have
to consider it when I retire.

113
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:08,364
Well, that'll give you plenty
of time to get up to speed.

114
00:05:08,432 --> 00:05:10,466
I could fly that boat
blindfolded tomorrow.

115
00:05:10,534 --> 00:05:11,801
By the time you work

116
00:05:11,869 --> 00:05:13,837
on your I.F.R. booster
instrument rating,

117
00:05:13,904 --> 00:05:15,305
you'll be wearing bifocals.

118
00:05:15,372 --> 00:05:16,973
Missed your calling, buddy.
Should've been a comedian.

119
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:19,342
Missed his calling all right.
Why'd you leave the Navy?

120
00:05:19,409 --> 00:05:21,576
- Look, don't worry about it.
- Aren't you boys hot in those uniforms?

121
00:05:21,644 --> 00:05:23,712
Maybe they can't swim.

122
00:05:23,779 --> 00:05:26,048
We're in the Navy.

123
00:05:26,115 --> 00:05:27,782
Well, there you go, Laura.

124
00:05:27,851 --> 00:05:30,018
One of these gentlemen
will race with you.

125
00:05:30,086 --> 00:05:31,920
Oh, I wasn't looking to race.

126
00:05:31,988 --> 00:05:35,357
Are you sure? 'Cause I'll
give you half-a-lap head start.

127
00:05:35,424 --> 00:05:36,591
Loser buys drinks?

128
00:05:36,659 --> 00:05:38,359
Take this to Jakarta.

129
00:05:46,434 --> 00:05:47,935
Come on, Laura!

130
00:05:48,003 --> 00:05:49,570
- Come on now!
- Come on! You're beating him!

131
00:05:49,637 --> 00:05:52,439
Come on! You got it!

132
00:05:52,507 --> 00:05:55,608
I won?!

133
00:05:57,912 --> 00:05:59,012
Oh!

134
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,347
Was there ever
any doubt?

135
00:06:00,414 --> 00:06:01,614
What's going on over there?

136
00:06:01,682 --> 00:06:02,983
Battle of the sexes.

137
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:05,618
Oh. Best one win?

138
00:06:05,686 --> 00:06:07,553
Of course.

139
00:06:07,621 --> 00:06:10,289
Oh, I won!

140
00:06:10,357 --> 00:06:13,425
Apparently, the secret is being
endowed with monkey arms.

141
00:06:13,493 --> 00:06:15,094
I'm so happy
she could amuse you.

142
00:06:15,161 --> 00:06:17,462
- I'm being ironic.
- Laura's a gem!

143
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:18,898
- Did you see?
- I saw.

144
00:06:18,965 --> 00:06:21,300
Where'd you get that camera?
Did you get a picture?

145
00:06:21,368 --> 00:06:24,036
Oh, I missed it.
I'm sorry.

146
00:06:24,104 --> 00:06:25,370
Drinks all around!

147
00:06:27,506 --> 00:06:29,908
You didn't even give me the full head start.

148
00:06:29,975 --> 00:06:31,442
You didn't need it.

149
00:06:38,483 --> 00:06:39,984
<i>Mayday! Mayday!</i>

150
00:06:46,024 --> 00:06:47,758
Aah!

151
00:06:47,826 --> 00:06:49,092
Aah!

152
00:06:57,902 --> 00:06:59,803
Help!

153
00:07:04,222 --> 00:07:05,456
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

154
00:07:05,524 --> 00:07:06,891
<i>we're just crossing over</i>
<i>the equator.</i>

155
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:08,092
<i>We'll be landing in Jakarta</i>
<i>in just under an hour.</i>

156
00:07:10,244 --> 00:07:11,645
Did I do something wrong?
I mean...

157
00:07:11,713 --> 00:07:13,013
No, not at all.

158
00:07:13,081 --> 00:07:14,715
Well, they knew I could swim.
We told them.

159
00:07:14,783 --> 00:07:18,051
You were swimming.
He was trolling.

160
00:07:18,119 --> 00:07:19,920
Oh. Well,
Maggie said that...

161
00:07:19,988 --> 00:07:21,988
Maggie likes to stir the pot.
It's her hobby.

162
00:07:22,055 --> 00:07:23,422
Uh, you have the pilots'?

163
00:07:23,491 --> 00:07:24,958
I do.

164
00:07:26,193 --> 00:07:29,362
No, no,
Sputnik was a good thing.

165
00:07:29,429 --> 00:07:31,364
So it was a <i>good</i> thing.

166
00:07:31,431 --> 00:07:33,065
The Russians beat us
into space.

167
00:07:33,133 --> 00:07:34,701
We needed a kick
in the pants.

168
00:07:34,768 --> 00:07:35,869
Some kick.

169
00:07:35,936 --> 00:07:37,370
They got the first man
up there, too.

170
00:07:37,437 --> 00:07:39,304
We could have beaten them
in two and a half months

171
00:07:39,372 --> 00:07:41,807
if we didn't wimp out and send up
that monkey.

172
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:43,241
Coffee, gentlemen?

173
00:07:43,309 --> 00:07:44,576
Please.

174
00:07:44,644 --> 00:07:46,244
- Wasn't it a chimp?
- Like I said, a monkey.

175
00:07:46,312 --> 00:07:48,380
Yeah, right, so...
No, none for me, thanks.

176
00:07:48,447 --> 00:07:51,416
So you look before you leap,
right?

177
00:07:51,484 --> 00:07:53,451
You're learning, captain.

178
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:56,220
Bridget. You leapt. She loped.

179
00:07:58,156 --> 00:08:01,058
Thank you, Sanjeev.

180
00:08:01,126 --> 00:08:03,628
Completely forgotten.

181
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,268
Say...

182
00:08:12,336 --> 00:08:15,306
Did Bridget,
you know, help you?

183
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,661
Jump the line.

184
00:08:19,729 --> 00:08:21,296
What line?

185
00:08:21,364 --> 00:08:23,632
The line
to that captain's chair.

186
00:08:24,933 --> 00:08:26,967
I just thought
maybe Bridget had a connection

187
00:08:27,034 --> 00:08:28,369
before she went Houdini.

188
00:08:28,436 --> 00:08:30,237
British aristocracy
or something.

189
00:08:30,305 --> 00:08:33,274
Ted, the world does not work
that way for most people.

190
00:08:33,341 --> 00:08:37,144
Tell that
to the 65 Pan Am first officers

191
00:08:37,211 --> 00:08:39,146
with more seniority
than you.

192
00:08:39,213 --> 00:08:40,247
Oh, so you counted.

193
00:08:40,315 --> 00:08:42,348
Rough guess.

194
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:44,284
Does that include you?

195
00:08:44,351 --> 00:08:50,356
Look, don't get me wrong.
I think you're a fine pilot.

196
00:08:50,424 --> 00:08:52,191
I'm just not buying
this whole new image thing,

197
00:08:52,259 --> 00:08:53,593
not with your ugly mug.

198
00:08:53,661 --> 00:08:55,495
Or...
That chip on your shoulder

199
00:08:55,562 --> 00:08:57,996
doesn't leave any room
for captain's stripes.

200
00:08:58,063 --> 00:09:00,932
Yeah, maybe.

201
00:09:02,502 --> 00:09:05,970
But seriously,
how'd you jump the line?

202
00:09:06,038 --> 00:09:09,240
Well, why didn't you?

203
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:28,292
At ease, lieutenant.
We'll make this quick.

204
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,992
In the matter
of the 12 September crash

205
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,528
of the Juno-V3 interceptor,

206
00:09:31,595 --> 00:09:33,663
piloted by
lieutenant Edward Vanderway...

207
00:09:33,731 --> 00:09:35,332
Excuse me, sir.
Is this a finding?

208
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:37,467
I haven't completed
my testimony.

209
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,069
We have your statement.
Is it deficient in some way?

210
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,240
No, sir.

211
00:09:44,308 --> 00:09:46,174
Then in the absence
of any clear mechanical failure,

212
00:09:46,242 --> 00:09:47,676
this inquiry finds...

213
00:09:47,744 --> 00:09:49,812
Sir, with respect, as I've
told you, I'm a test pilot.

214
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:51,413
My job is to push aircraft
to the limit

215
00:09:51,481 --> 00:09:53,048
in search of
possible mechanical failure,

216
00:09:53,115 --> 00:09:54,850
in this case, I found one.

217
00:09:54,917 --> 00:09:58,887
My I.A. was stuck
at 90 degrees left.

218
00:09:58,955 --> 00:10:00,723
No evidence
of an altimeter freeze.

219
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:02,590
The V3 cockpit is scattered
all over the Atlantic.

220
00:10:02,658 --> 00:10:04,859
I repeat... no evidence.

221
00:10:04,926 --> 00:10:08,563
My testimony as a pilot
and officer

222
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:11,366
in the United States Navy
is evidence.

223
00:10:11,433 --> 00:10:13,100
And your bar tab
the night before is evidence

224
00:10:13,168 --> 00:10:16,203
that the Navy got less
than your best that morning.

225
00:10:16,271 --> 00:10:19,506
That was over 12 hours
before I flew.

226
00:10:21,376 --> 00:10:23,176
That's well
within regulations.

227
00:10:28,716 --> 00:10:31,117
The aircraft failed, sir.

228
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:37,289
Lieutenant, your presence here
today requires you to listen,

229
00:10:37,357 --> 00:10:38,524
not to argue.

230
00:10:41,094 --> 00:10:43,262
While the absence
of clear mechanical failure

231
00:10:43,329 --> 00:10:45,664
suggests the primary cause
of the Juno crash

232
00:10:45,732 --> 00:10:48,934
to be that of pilot error,

233
00:10:49,002 --> 00:10:53,505
this inquiry requires further
investigation and deliberation

234
00:10:53,572 --> 00:10:55,607
and recommends
lieutenant Vanderway

235
00:10:55,674 --> 00:10:58,342
be placed
upon administrative duty

236
00:10:58,411 --> 00:11:01,245
until the matter is resolved.

237
00:11:03,048 --> 00:11:04,215
Dismissed.

238
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:16,827
He's a looker, ain't he?

239
00:11:16,895 --> 00:11:21,564
Is there any chance you all have
a television set around here?

240
00:11:21,632 --> 00:11:23,833
- Yes, we do.
- All right.

241
00:11:23,901 --> 00:11:25,868
Jakarta...
Coming up in the world.

242
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:27,804
But it is not working
right now.

243
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,138
Or not.

244
00:11:29,205 --> 00:11:30,239
What's wrong with it?

245
00:11:30,307 --> 00:11:33,175
I don't know, sir.
I'm sorry.

246
00:11:33,243 --> 00:11:35,044
Well, where is it?
Maybe I can fix it.

247
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:36,579
You just go down the stairs,
you turn right,

248
00:11:36,647 --> 00:11:37,879
and you keep going
all the way back.

249
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,781
Okay, okay.

250
00:11:41,818 --> 00:11:43,251
Oh, it's so foreign!

251
00:11:43,319 --> 00:11:44,786
How did you get here so fast?

252
00:11:44,854 --> 00:11:46,755
Oh, Mr. Rickshaw knew how
to beat the traffic.

253
00:11:46,823 --> 00:11:48,490
You should have tried one.

254
00:11:48,558 --> 00:11:50,124
So <i>that's</i> where
my scarf went.

255
00:11:50,192 --> 00:11:51,326
Oh, you had two.

256
00:11:51,393 --> 00:11:53,227
J-just ask.
I-I thought I lost it,

257
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:55,496
and you should be wearing
a white scarf in uniform.

258
00:11:55,564 --> 00:11:56,564
I know. I forgot it.

259
00:11:56,631 --> 00:11:59,032
That's a demerit.

260
00:12:00,435 --> 00:12:02,369
I made a list
of the attractions

261
00:12:02,437 --> 00:12:03,771
we can see while we're here,

262
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,005
and I think if we don't
leave soon, then I'm...

263
00:12:05,073 --> 00:12:06,474
I think you're
a bit jet-lagged.

264
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:08,809
Why don't you just
rest here for a few minutes?

265
00:12:08,877 --> 00:12:11,277
Well, Maggie said that Jakarta
is excitingly unrefined.

266
00:12:11,345 --> 00:12:13,680
I tell you what.

267
00:12:13,747 --> 00:12:16,850
I'll go pick up our per diem
and get a few tourist tips,

268
00:12:16,917 --> 00:12:19,018
and then we'll head out.

269
00:12:19,086 --> 00:12:20,319
Okay.

270
00:12:20,387 --> 00:12:21,855
Promise not to see anything
without me.

271
00:12:21,922 --> 00:12:24,457
I'll keep my eyes shut.

272
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:36,424
Laura?

273
00:13:42,831 --> 00:13:46,232
Make no sense.
What this word?

274
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:49,269
Uh, it's, um, "souvenir."

275
00:13:50,672 --> 00:13:52,773
<i>Sou-ve-nir.</i>

276
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:57,644
"Richard. Want souvenir?
What destination? Kate."

277
00:13:57,712 --> 00:13:59,046
Yeah.

278
00:13:59,113 --> 00:14:00,113
You wait?

279
00:14:00,181 --> 00:14:01,314
Sorry?

280
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:02,381
You. Wait. Reply.

281
00:14:02,449 --> 00:14:05,284
Uh, yes, I will wait.
Thank you.

282
00:14:09,255 --> 00:14:12,959
5 pieces of page paper.
2 rupiah each.

283
00:14:25,938 --> 00:14:27,505
Here's what you need to know.

284
00:14:27,573 --> 00:14:29,841
Lizards... good.
Leave 'em alone.

285
00:14:29,909 --> 00:14:32,644
They eat the mosquitoes,
not you.

286
00:14:32,712 --> 00:14:34,111
If you say so.

287
00:14:34,178 --> 00:14:36,680
- We are definitely
- not in Kansas anymore.

288
00:14:36,748 --> 00:14:39,683
I can't believe you touched it,
you weren't scared at all.

289
00:14:39,751 --> 00:14:42,352
Aah!
Aah!

290
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,921
Snake in the bathroom!

291
00:14:43,989 --> 00:14:45,923
What do we do?

292
00:14:45,991 --> 00:14:48,258
Okay. Okay.
What? What?

293
00:14:48,326 --> 00:14:50,760
We get outta here.
Get dressed,

294
00:14:50,828 --> 00:14:53,429
and I will
meet you downstairs.

295
00:14:53,497 --> 00:14:57,133
Oh, uh... m-Maggie?

296
00:15:20,191 --> 00:15:22,292
Hi. Excuse me.
Um, I have to get going.

297
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,625
Can I just come back later?

298
00:15:23,693 --> 00:15:24,793
Tomorrow.

299
00:15:24,861 --> 00:15:26,962
No, no, no.
I'll just come back later.

300
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,497
We close five minutes.

301
00:15:28,564 --> 00:15:29,564
What?

302
00:15:29,632 --> 00:15:30,866
We close five minutes.

303
00:15:30,934 --> 00:15:32,567
No, no, no.
I need that reply now.

304
00:15:32,635 --> 00:15:34,603
You have U.S. dollars?

305
00:15:39,942 --> 00:15:41,642
Thank you.

306
00:15:49,584 --> 00:15:52,353
You won't find this place
in the tourist book, huh?

307
00:15:56,257 --> 00:15:57,690
<i>Bir, silakan.</i>

308
00:15:57,758 --> 00:15:59,192
I can order beer
in 15 languages.

309
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,227
Really?

310
00:16:00,295 --> 00:16:01,628
Well, don't be too impressed.

311
00:16:01,695 --> 00:16:04,197
After that, my repertoire tops
out at "where's the bathroom?"

312
00:16:04,265 --> 00:16:07,467
Ah, the scent
of youth and freedom.

313
00:16:07,535 --> 00:16:09,136
Intoxicating.

314
00:16:09,203 --> 00:16:10,870
Thank you.

315
00:16:10,938 --> 00:16:12,538
Yes, we are
the American dream.

316
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:14,706
But, alas, merely your fantasy.

317
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:23,349
Dominoes?

318
00:16:23,417 --> 00:16:26,552
Block dominoes or "gaple."
Serious stuff.

319
00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:29,187
High stakes. A lot of fun.

320
00:16:29,255 --> 00:16:30,588
You know how to play?

321
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,324
I know how to win.

322
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:34,725
Pull up a chair.

323
00:16:35,962 --> 00:16:36,894
Ready for rematch?

324
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:39,797
Oh, yeah.
How have you been?

325
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:40,898
On a winning streak.

326
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:43,000
Oh, yeah, till I got here.

327
00:16:44,669 --> 00:16:45,635
Okay.

328
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,840
Okay, you go now.

329
00:16:52,743 --> 00:16:53,677
Make no sense...

330
00:16:53,744 --> 00:16:56,246
"If you drop camera,
it break."

331
00:16:58,616 --> 00:17:01,517
"Drop camera harta karun laut"?

332
00:17:01,585 --> 00:17:03,152
Oh. Excuse me! Excuse me.

333
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:06,422
Uh, do you know
where harta karun laut is?

334
00:17:18,101 --> 00:17:19,934
Green door.

335
00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:28,743
This is the best
chicken curry in Indonesia.

336
00:17:31,613 --> 00:17:32,613
Thank you.

337
00:17:44,792 --> 00:17:45,893
How much money
do you have left?

338
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,227
Not much.

339
00:17:47,294 --> 00:17:48,228
Don't worry. I'm flush.

340
00:17:53,834 --> 00:17:56,036
Which one of those varmints
looks tougher to you?

341
00:17:56,103 --> 00:17:57,337
What, the chicken?

342
00:17:57,405 --> 00:17:59,172
Well, they're cocks.
It's a big difference.

343
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,241
Oh.

344
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,349
At least the loser tastes
pretty good, don't you think?

345
00:18:13,386 --> 00:18:16,155
- Let's go dance.
- Let's dance.

346
00:18:22,261 --> 00:18:24,262
Laura?

347
00:18:27,099 --> 00:18:29,100
Laura?

348
00:18:36,306 --> 00:18:37,941
Oh, God.

349
00:18:38,209 --> 00:18:40,143
Oh, Laura.

350
00:18:40,211 --> 00:18:42,712
Ohh.

351
00:18:50,555 --> 00:18:52,821
Hello?

352
00:18:52,889 --> 00:18:54,656
Hello?

353
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,493
Excuse me.

354
00:18:57,561 --> 00:18:59,828
Yes?

355
00:18:59,896 --> 00:19:01,830
Uh, excuse me.

356
00:19:01,898 --> 00:19:03,499
Uh, did my sister leave
a note for me?

357
00:19:03,567 --> 00:19:05,201
Room 212?

358
00:19:05,268 --> 00:19:06,435
Sister?

359
00:19:06,503 --> 00:19:10,872
- Yes, sister.
- Uh, my sister. Room 212.

360
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,140
No.

361
00:19:18,214 --> 00:19:19,681
Oh, dang. Almost had it.

362
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,718
Ted. Ted, have you
seen Laura?

363
00:19:23,785 --> 00:19:27,922
Uh, no. Can you hold this
for a second?

364
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:29,857
I can't believe
she didn't leave a note.

365
00:19:29,925 --> 00:19:31,191
Where'd... where'd she go?

366
00:19:31,259 --> 00:19:32,727
If she needs a spanking,
I'm your guy.

367
00:19:32,794 --> 00:19:36,497
I know. I know.
Restricted airspace.

368
00:19:46,173 --> 00:19:47,507
What's our motto?

369
00:19:47,574 --> 00:19:49,075
Go native!

370
00:19:49,143 --> 00:19:50,476
You got it, sister!

371
00:20:11,297 --> 00:20:15,232
Kate? Look.
I'm practically a native.

372
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,868
Yes, Colette told me.

373
00:20:18,003 --> 00:20:20,138
She saw you and Maggie
out and about.

374
00:20:20,205 --> 00:20:22,040
Oh, we had the best time.

375
00:20:22,107 --> 00:20:24,575
Maggie knows everything about
everything and then some,

376
00:20:24,643 --> 00:20:27,078
and look what she made me buy.
Mom will flip.

377
00:20:27,146 --> 00:20:29,579
Laura, is there a camera
in your bag?

378
00:20:29,647 --> 00:20:30,647
Yes.

379
00:20:30,715 --> 00:20:32,149
- Ohh.
- I borrowed it.

380
00:20:32,216 --> 00:20:33,784
- I hope you didn't mind.
- Great. Just... just give it to me.

381
00:20:33,851 --> 00:20:34,751
I... we just left in such a hurry.
I didn't... just... no, it's...

382
00:20:34,819 --> 00:20:35,786
Just give it to me.

383
00:20:35,853 --> 00:20:38,621
I'm... I'm... I'm sorry.

384
00:20:50,433 --> 00:20:52,434
Thank you.

385
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:02,977
Hello?

386
00:21:04,947 --> 00:21:06,214
Hello?

387
00:21:06,281 --> 00:21:07,215
Uh...

388
00:21:09,484 --> 00:21:11,519
Um, are you in there?

389
00:21:11,587 --> 00:21:14,255
Ohh.

390
00:21:47,654 --> 00:21:51,322
I don't... have any money.

391
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:53,759
You're late.

392
00:22:11,756 --> 00:22:12,856
Snake's gone.

393
00:22:12,924 --> 00:22:14,425
I got
housekeeping to take it.

394
00:22:14,492 --> 00:22:18,094
They didn't seem
very apologetic.

395
00:22:18,162 --> 00:22:19,596
Said it wasn't poisonous,

396
00:22:19,664 --> 00:22:20,764
like we could know that.

397
00:22:20,832 --> 00:22:22,766
You just took off.

398
00:22:23,834 --> 00:22:24,967
You just took off,

399
00:22:25,035 --> 00:22:26,703
without a care in the world...

400
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:28,438
Well, there was a snake. I...

401
00:22:28,505 --> 00:22:31,474
Room in <i>shambles.</i>

402
00:22:32,843 --> 00:22:34,877
Oh.

403
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:37,680
I should have left a note.

404
00:22:37,748 --> 00:22:40,281
Do you have any idea
how worried I was?

405
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:42,884
I mean, what...
What were you thinking?

406
00:22:42,952 --> 00:22:44,219
Maggie just came in.
It all happened...

407
00:22:44,286 --> 00:22:45,721
You know, Laura,
you weren't thinking...

408
00:22:45,788 --> 00:22:48,256
And you sure as hell
didn't give me a second thought.

409
00:22:48,324 --> 00:22:50,559
We might as well just be
back home, you know?

410
00:22:50,626 --> 00:22:52,293
You just skimming by,

411
00:22:52,362 --> 00:22:54,095
and me paying for all
of your mistakes.

412
00:22:54,163 --> 00:22:56,129
What are you talking about?

413
00:22:57,966 --> 00:22:59,066
I don't want to worry
about you,

414
00:22:59,133 --> 00:23:00,701
and I don't want
to take care of you.

415
00:23:00,769 --> 00:23:02,102
Who's asking you to?

416
00:23:03,304 --> 00:23:05,406
I don't seem to have
a choice.

417
00:23:05,474 --> 00:23:07,575
Kate...

418
00:23:07,642 --> 00:23:10,143
You're not even giving me
a chance.

419
00:23:10,211 --> 00:23:11,578
To do what, Laura?

420
00:23:11,645 --> 00:23:13,413
To be me?

421
00:23:14,482 --> 00:23:16,916
In case you've forgotten,

422
00:23:16,984 --> 00:23:19,218
I got this job
on my own merits.

423
00:23:19,286 --> 00:23:20,286
Then act like it.

424
00:23:20,354 --> 00:23:21,821
You want to get out.

425
00:23:21,889 --> 00:23:23,923
You... you want to have a job.
You want to see the world.

426
00:23:23,991 --> 00:23:25,392
That is great,

427
00:23:25,459 --> 00:23:27,526
but do you know
what that makes you?

428
00:23:27,594 --> 00:23:31,363
A grown-up, so grow up.

429
00:23:35,502 --> 00:23:37,403
It's so easy for you.

430
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:39,772
No one ever expected
anything from you.

431
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:41,540
Excuse me?

432
00:23:41,608 --> 00:23:44,542
You always got to do
exactly what you wanted.

433
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:46,711
Yeah, Laura, I did!
I did. I did what I wanted.

434
00:23:46,779 --> 00:23:48,846
I did what I <i>really</i> wanted to,
but now...

435
00:23:48,915 --> 00:23:50,681
Now I'm doing
what you wanted...

436
00:23:52,018 --> 00:23:53,651
And you still don't
want me here!

437
00:23:53,719 --> 00:23:56,154
No, Laura, I just want you
to stand on your own two feet!

438
00:23:56,222 --> 00:23:57,622
I am trying!

439
00:23:57,689 --> 00:24:00,224
You're wearing bunny slippers!
You're wearing bunny slippers!

440
00:24:00,292 --> 00:24:03,928
Well, I like them!
You don't have to!

441
00:24:14,973 --> 00:24:16,739
<i>...As the elevator door closes</i>

442
00:24:16,807 --> 00:24:19,909
<i>and slowly starts up</i>
<i>the, uh, the entry tower.</i>

443
00:24:19,977 --> 00:24:21,311
<i>Booster locked</i>
<i>and ready to go.</i>

444
00:24:21,378 --> 00:24:23,246
Then light that sucker.

445
00:24:23,314 --> 00:24:26,582
<i>And once again,</i>
<i>he wastes no time in...</i>

446
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:28,351
Did you close down the bar?

447
00:24:28,419 --> 00:24:30,987
Wouldn't be the first time.

448
00:24:31,055 --> 00:24:34,256
<i>Carrying his portable cooler</i>
<i>and walks into the van...</i>

449
00:24:34,324 --> 00:24:37,692
Is that the, uh, latest
in tropical evening wear?

450
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,361
<i>Following him</i>
<i>into the transfer van.</i>

451
00:24:39,429 --> 00:24:41,296
Paradise not
what you expected?

452
00:24:41,364 --> 00:24:42,797
<i>Through the gates...</i>

453
00:24:44,434 --> 00:24:45,867
I'll tell you
if you tell me,

454
00:24:45,935 --> 00:24:49,070
and we'll both deny it
in the morning, hmm?

455
00:24:49,137 --> 00:24:51,538
All right.

456
00:24:51,606 --> 00:24:53,674
You go first.

457
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:00,514
I killed a man in amarillo.

458
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:01,648
You did?

459
00:25:01,716 --> 00:25:03,384
Rube.

460
00:25:04,619 --> 00:25:06,553
Brat.

461
00:25:06,621 --> 00:25:08,221
I don't need anyone else
telling me

462
00:25:08,289 --> 00:25:09,990
I don't know anything.

463
00:25:10,057 --> 00:25:11,492
Aha. A clue.

464
00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:13,560
<i>Cooper will be up 136...</i>

465
00:25:13,628 --> 00:25:14,528
What are we watching?

466
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:16,697
"Mercury 9" live liftoff.

467
00:25:16,764 --> 00:25:18,031
Sending the first man
into outer space

468
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:19,065
for more than a day.

469
00:25:19,133 --> 00:25:20,066
<i>More time than land.</i>

470
00:25:21,134 --> 00:25:23,569
Oh, come on! Not again.

471
00:25:23,637 --> 00:25:25,070
Technology versus Ted.

472
00:25:25,138 --> 00:25:26,372
Round six!

473
00:25:27,641 --> 00:25:29,274
- Anything?
- No.

474
00:25:29,342 --> 00:25:32,111
Ohh! I will not be bested by
some tubes and wires from 1952!

475
00:25:32,178 --> 00:25:33,112
Oh, w-wait. Wait.

476
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:34,113
Oh, we got something?

477
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,314
Yes. Uh...

478
00:25:35,382 --> 00:25:38,249
No. Wait. A little... yes.

479
00:25:38,317 --> 00:25:41,486
Yes, it... well, it...
It's sort of working.

480
00:25:41,554 --> 00:25:43,855
- Story of my life!
- Mine, too.

481
00:25:43,923 --> 00:25:44,956
Okay, there!

482
00:25:45,024 --> 00:25:47,158
Oh! Oh.

483
00:25:47,226 --> 00:25:49,060
Oh, can you turn up
the volume, please?

484
00:25:49,128 --> 00:25:52,463
Uh, you... look, you sit.

485
00:25:52,531 --> 00:25:53,463
I'll hold this.

486
00:25:53,532 --> 00:25:55,766
Oh, thank you.

487
00:25:55,834 --> 00:25:57,134
Ohh.
Will it fly by us?

488
00:25:57,201 --> 00:25:59,503
Oh, maybe...
In about 45 minutes,

489
00:25:59,571 --> 00:26:01,672
but it's more like falling
than flying.

490
00:26:03,074 --> 00:26:04,875
<i>Earlier than he was</i>
<i>yesterday morning.</i>

491
00:26:04,943 --> 00:26:05,876
Oh, we lost it.

492
00:26:05,944 --> 00:26:07,511
Oh.

493
00:26:07,579 --> 00:26:09,211
Hey, oh. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Freeze!

494
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:10,980
Right... there.

495
00:26:11,048 --> 00:26:14,450
I wish I had my camera.

496
00:26:14,518 --> 00:26:15,718
Don't say the word "camera."

497
00:26:15,786 --> 00:26:16,719
Here we go.

498
00:26:16,787 --> 00:26:18,555
<i>Four... three...</i>

499
00:26:18,622 --> 00:26:20,657
<i>Two... one.</i>

500
00:26:20,724 --> 00:26:22,892
<i>Ignition. Liftoff.</i>
Liftoff.

501
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,829
<i>04 after the hour, liftoff.</i>

502
00:26:27,897 --> 00:26:31,099
<i>All systems appear to be</i>
<i>operating properly.</i>

503
00:26:36,172 --> 00:26:37,839
<i>This is Mercury control.</i>

504
00:26:37,907 --> 00:26:40,508
<i>The trajectory looks a-okay</i>
<i>at this time.</i>

505
00:26:43,078 --> 00:26:45,112
<i>- Roger.</i> 
<i>- You look good here, Gordo.</i>

506
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:47,582
<i>Roger. Feels good, buddy.</i>

507
00:26:49,851 --> 00:26:51,786
I bet it does.

508
00:26:57,925 --> 00:27:00,193
They offered me
honorable discharge.

509
00:27:01,295 --> 00:27:02,929
It's the least
the Navy could do.

510
00:27:02,997 --> 00:27:05,465
I'm opting to decline it.

511
00:27:05,532 --> 00:27:10,203
And the devil did grin,
for his darling sin is pride.

512
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:12,705
That aircraft had
a bum gyro, dad.

513
00:27:12,772 --> 00:27:16,842
Everything has limits.

514
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:18,276
Even you.

515
00:27:19,579 --> 00:27:21,480
Here's a thought.
I'll make a call.

516
00:27:21,547 --> 00:27:22,615
No.

517
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:23,682
No, you want to fly
a few more years

518
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:24,984
before you settle down.

519
00:27:25,051 --> 00:27:27,720
I'll put in a word
with Juan Trippe at Pan Am.

520
00:27:27,787 --> 00:27:29,854
I am a naval aviator.

521
00:27:29,922 --> 00:27:32,590
I do not need your help
flying commercial.

522
00:27:32,658 --> 00:27:34,859
<i>Former</i> naval aviator.

523
00:27:34,927 --> 00:27:37,060
Not yet.

524
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:51,508
Dad, I-I, uh,

525
00:27:51,575 --> 00:27:52,975
I need you to get
your engineers to take

526
00:27:53,043 --> 00:27:56,646
a harder look
at the gyro on the V3.

527
00:27:56,713 --> 00:27:58,580
It's been taken care of.

528
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:01,350
So there was something
wrong with it?

529
00:28:04,254 --> 00:28:06,488
Tell the Navy.

530
00:28:06,556 --> 00:28:08,356
They can reopen my inquiry.

531
00:28:08,423 --> 00:28:11,526
My company's contracts
with the Pentagon

532
00:28:11,593 --> 00:28:13,862
are up for renewal
next year.

533
00:28:13,929 --> 00:28:16,865
Contracts?

534
00:28:16,932 --> 00:28:19,534
Oh, dad. Um...

535
00:28:21,236 --> 00:28:27,074
This is my last shot
at the space program, so...

536
00:28:30,945 --> 00:28:33,080
It's over, son.

537
00:28:33,148 --> 00:28:35,883
Accept your honorable discharge
honorably

538
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:38,285
and get on with your life.

539
00:28:42,122 --> 00:28:45,124
Plenty of blue skies ahead,
Teddy.

540
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:54,044
Ooh! Time?

541
00:28:54,112 --> 00:28:55,245
Two minutes, seven seconds.

542
00:28:55,313 --> 00:28:57,180
Ugh! I'm slowing down.

543
00:28:57,247 --> 00:28:59,648
Do you really walk off the plane
without your girdle on?

544
00:28:59,716 --> 00:29:01,317
We are in the tropics.

545
00:29:01,385 --> 00:29:03,086
That's no place
for the shackles of propriety.

546
00:29:04,421 --> 00:29:06,289
You know she got grounded
for that.

547
00:29:06,356 --> 00:29:08,157
Do you see
a grooming supervisor anywhere?

548
00:29:08,225 --> 00:29:10,593
Oh, don't worry.
Kate's not a tattletale.

549
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:12,061
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

550
00:29:12,129 --> 00:29:14,296
<i>there's some weather on</i>
<i>the ground in Hong Kong harbor.</i>

551
00:29:14,363 --> 00:29:17,132
<i>We're gonna experience</i>
<i>a few bumps on our descent.</i>

552
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,801
Too bad.
The view is usually spectacular.

553
00:29:19,868 --> 00:29:22,137
Well, she doesn't have
a camera anyways.

554
00:29:22,205 --> 00:29:23,271
I plan on getting my own.

555
00:29:23,339 --> 00:29:24,473
Oh, good.

556
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:26,141
Is this fight about a camera?

557
00:29:26,209 --> 00:29:27,342
- No.
- Yes.

558
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:29,577
- Oh. 
- Tug-of-war. Must be nice.

559
00:29:29,644 --> 00:29:32,313
You're lucky, no?

560
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:34,081
Flying together?

561
00:29:40,355 --> 00:29:42,990
I suppose we are.

562
00:29:43,057 --> 00:29:46,359
It's hard to fly
with your wings clipped.

563
00:29:49,029 --> 00:29:52,098
What does she mean by that?

564
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:54,134
Laura, what have you been
telling her?

565
00:29:54,201 --> 00:29:56,802
Nothing, I...
I didn't have to.

566
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:59,239
You're the one
who does all the telling.

567
00:30:03,976 --> 00:30:06,278
Yes?

568
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:09,748
Got it.

569
00:30:13,286 --> 00:30:14,553
Maggie.
Hmm?

570
00:30:14,621 --> 00:30:15,987
All I'm trying to do is help
Laura get up to speed...

571
00:30:16,055 --> 00:30:16,988
I was joking.

572
00:30:17,056 --> 00:30:17,988
And you're not helping.

573
00:30:18,056 --> 00:30:19,157
Aren't I?

574
00:30:19,224 --> 00:30:21,159
She is inexperienced
at everything.

575
00:30:21,226 --> 00:30:23,093
She hasn't done a thing
on her own.

576
00:30:23,162 --> 00:30:24,495
Well, maybe she should.

577
00:30:25,597 --> 00:30:28,065
Pan Am is
the ultimate new beginning.

578
00:30:28,133 --> 00:30:30,168
Let her begin.

579
00:30:30,235 --> 00:30:31,135
Better batten down
the hatches.

580
00:30:31,203 --> 00:30:32,170
Hmm?

581
00:30:32,237 --> 00:30:33,770
Heavy crosswinds.

582
00:30:35,072 --> 00:30:37,774
Clipper Two,
over heading Sierra-Lima-beacon,

583
00:30:37,841 --> 00:30:40,177
descend to 2,000 and cleared
to intercept localizer

584
00:30:40,244 --> 00:30:41,244
for approach.

585
00:30:45,816 --> 00:30:48,185
Clipper Two, do you copy?

586
00:30:49,986 --> 00:30:51,119
Answer him, will ya?

587
00:30:51,188 --> 00:30:53,055
Roger that,
Kai Tak approach.

588
00:30:53,122 --> 00:30:54,657
Have you ever
done this before?

589
00:30:54,724 --> 00:30:55,658
What, land it
in poor visibility?

590
00:30:55,725 --> 00:30:58,294
The Hong Kong approach.

591
00:30:58,361 --> 00:30:59,761
First time
without training wheels.

592
00:30:59,829 --> 00:31:02,931
Yeah, so never
with these crosswinds then.

593
00:31:04,734 --> 00:31:06,601
Piece of cake.

594
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:15,109
Captain,
airspeed 2-0-0 knots.

595
00:31:15,177 --> 00:31:16,311
Damn, who designed
this approach?

596
00:31:16,378 --> 00:31:17,478
Satan.

597
00:31:17,546 --> 00:31:19,314
Clipper Two,
call checkerboard in sight.

598
00:31:19,381 --> 00:31:21,015
Roger. Call checkerboard.

599
00:31:25,152 --> 00:31:27,521
Okay, I have checkerboard
in sight. Flaps to 30.

600
00:31:27,589 --> 00:31:29,323
- Checkerboard in sight.
- Flaps to 30.

601
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:31,558
Altitude, uh, 1,000 feet.

602
00:31:31,626 --> 00:31:33,594
Where... uh, uh, what was
our last wind speed?

603
00:31:33,661 --> 00:31:35,429
225 degrees at 20 knots.

604
00:31:35,496 --> 00:31:37,130
20 knots. Abort. We need
to abort. Let's circle around.

605
00:31:37,198 --> 00:31:38,097
The weather's not getting
any better.

606
00:31:38,164 --> 00:31:39,131
Tell the tower we're landing.

607
00:31:39,199 --> 00:31:40,132
Are you nuts?

608
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,000
Hey! Do it.

609
00:31:45,205 --> 00:31:47,373
Cleared for 1-3.
Clipper 2-2.

610
00:31:47,441 --> 00:31:48,708
At this airspeed,

611
00:31:48,775 --> 00:31:50,109
with that crosswind,
you're gonna land in the water.

612
00:31:50,176 --> 00:31:52,111
I don't plan on maintaining
this airspeed.

613
00:31:52,178 --> 00:31:53,112
We're at our crosswind limit.

614
00:31:53,179 --> 00:31:54,546
At! At, not over.

615
00:31:54,614 --> 00:31:55,614
Captain, do you want me
to take over?

616
00:31:55,681 --> 00:31:58,015
No! I want you
to shut the hell up!

617
00:32:42,825 --> 00:32:46,161
Oh! Oh!

618
00:32:49,165 --> 00:32:50,766
Oh.

619
00:32:50,833 --> 00:32:52,768
Here we are.

620
00:33:02,911 --> 00:33:05,045
Good news...
my circulation has returned,

621
00:33:05,113 --> 00:33:06,647
and I didn't soil myself.

622
00:33:06,715 --> 00:33:08,215
That was quite a landing,
captain.

623
00:33:08,283 --> 00:33:10,618
I'll be at the bar...
until tomorrow.

624
00:33:10,686 --> 00:33:12,420
Yeah.

625
00:33:12,487 --> 00:33:14,688
That <i>was</i> quite a landing.

626
00:33:14,755 --> 00:33:16,690
Glad you agree.

627
00:33:16,757 --> 00:33:19,326
There were 128 souls
on this aircraft.

628
00:33:19,393 --> 00:33:22,161
Yeah, that I got safely
to the ground.

629
00:33:22,229 --> 00:33:23,730
We could have gotten safely
to Singapore.

630
00:33:23,798 --> 00:33:25,865
Well, we got safely
to Hong Kong.

631
00:33:25,933 --> 00:33:28,835
We were one short and curly away
from landing in that bay.

632
00:33:28,902 --> 00:33:30,602
The only time we were
in any danger

633
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:32,137
was when you were
distracting me.

634
00:33:33,873 --> 00:33:36,842
Look, you're my friend, Ted.
I like you.

635
00:33:36,909 --> 00:33:38,377
We can joke around
in the cockpit.

636
00:33:38,445 --> 00:33:41,547
We can hang out
on the ground,

637
00:33:41,614 --> 00:33:43,048
but you make no mistake.

638
00:33:43,115 --> 00:33:44,650
<i>I</i> am in charge in the air,

639
00:33:44,718 --> 00:33:47,752
and what <i>I</i> say
and what <i>I</i> do is the law.

640
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:52,390
There's no discussion,
no second-guessing.

641
00:33:52,458 --> 00:33:54,892
And a sky God is born.

642
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,460
Hey, call it
whatever you want.

643
00:33:56,527 --> 00:33:59,096
You either accept it,
or you need to get another jet.

644
00:33:59,164 --> 00:34:02,199
A good captain respects
and utilizes

645
00:34:02,267 --> 00:34:04,168
the expertise of his crew.

646
00:34:04,236 --> 00:34:06,136
And a good first officer knows
exactly when and where

647
00:34:06,204 --> 00:34:07,872
to offer it.

648
00:34:07,939 --> 00:34:08,938
Where the hell
are all the umbrellas?

649
00:34:09,006 --> 00:34:10,806
Do you think you're special?

650
00:34:10,875 --> 00:34:13,609
You thin you're the only guy
that can make that landing?

651
00:34:13,677 --> 00:34:15,044
I-I was a test pilot.

652
00:34:15,112 --> 00:34:16,746
I can land
an anvil on a postage stamp

653
00:34:16,813 --> 00:34:18,514
in the middle of the ocean.
That's not the point.

654
00:34:18,582 --> 00:34:20,984
No. The point is, you think
you're in the wrong seat.

655
00:34:21,051 --> 00:34:22,085
Yeah, I am.

656
00:34:22,152 --> 00:34:23,519
Okay, well, you either need
to let it go,

657
00:34:23,587 --> 00:34:25,988
or you need to call your daddy
to get you one of your own.

658
00:35:14,138 --> 00:35:16,739
Two days. It's been two days.

659
00:35:16,807 --> 00:35:18,442
Are you actually gonna let us
land in New York

660
00:35:18,509 --> 00:35:21,244
without telling us
how you got that shiner?

661
00:35:21,312 --> 00:35:24,347
Yeah, did some jerk
sucker punch you?

662
00:35:29,619 --> 00:35:32,688
Guess we're
on a need-to-know basis.

663
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:35,524
3,000 feet.

664
00:35:35,592 --> 00:35:38,995
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain speaking.

665
00:35:39,062 --> 00:35:41,596
We are making our final descent
into the New York area.

666
00:35:41,663 --> 00:35:43,764
I want to thank you
for flying Pan Am.

667
00:35:43,832 --> 00:35:45,367
For those of you
that have traveled with us

668
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:48,470
from the Orient...

669
00:35:48,537 --> 00:35:50,038
Welcome home.

670
00:36:00,115 --> 00:36:02,682
So... are we going
for cocktails?

671
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:04,051
Well, Kate will say no.

672
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:05,386
But what do you say?

673
00:36:08,189 --> 00:36:09,223
Night, boys.

674
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:11,925
Ladies.

675
00:36:11,993 --> 00:36:15,194
<i>Pan Am</i>
<i>flight 36 from London Heathrow,</i>

676
00:36:15,262 --> 00:36:18,498
<i>pick up your baggage</i>
<i>at carousel 4.</i>

677
00:36:24,304 --> 00:36:26,906
- Sorry, sir.
- I'll be right there.

678
00:36:26,973 --> 00:36:28,573
All right.

679
00:36:32,311 --> 00:36:34,312
Ted.

680
00:36:43,589 --> 00:36:45,456
Right place
at the right time.

681
00:36:46,858 --> 00:36:48,759
That's how I jumped
the line.

682
00:36:49,994 --> 00:36:54,131
I was downtown,
headquarters,

683
00:36:54,199 --> 00:36:58,602
and I got stuck in an elevator
with Juan Trippe for 11 minutes.

684
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:03,506
I figured...
I had nothing to lose,

685
00:37:03,575 --> 00:37:04,775
so I told him
what I thought about

686
00:37:04,842 --> 00:37:07,343
his pilot seniority system,

687
00:37:07,411 --> 00:37:08,612
and I asked him,

688
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,948
I said, "do you want to be
part of the past,"

689
00:37:11,015 --> 00:37:12,415
"or do you want to be part
of the future?

690
00:37:12,483 --> 00:37:15,085
"You know, World War II vets
versus what's happening

691
00:37:15,152 --> 00:37:19,689
right now with you and me...
The jet age?"

692
00:37:19,723 --> 00:37:22,858
Sometimes
you just got lucky.

693
00:37:24,094 --> 00:37:27,063
No, we make our own luck,
captain,

694
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:29,999
sometime you just gotta
step up.

695
00:37:30,067 --> 00:37:33,034
Yeah.

696
00:37:33,135 --> 00:37:34,936
Buy you a drink?

697
00:37:35,004 --> 00:37:37,538
- Twist my arm?
- Please, no more violence.

698
00:37:37,607 --> 00:37:38,640
And about that...

699
00:37:38,708 --> 00:37:39,941
You work on your hook.

700
00:37:40,009 --> 00:37:40,942
What?

701
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:42,543
Well, a little ivy league.

702
00:37:42,612 --> 00:37:43,645
- Really?
- Yeah.

703
00:37:43,713 --> 00:37:45,714
- There you are.
- Burger medium well.

704
00:37:45,781 --> 00:37:47,115
The jakarta cablegram office

705
00:37:47,182 --> 00:37:49,416
was not a model
of efficiency.

706
00:37:49,484 --> 00:37:52,219
It took hours

I got to the drop
as soon as I could.

708
00:37:53,822 --> 00:37:56,223
It was across the street.
You were six hours late.

709
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:59,226
But I made it, right?
You got the camera.

710
00:37:59,293 --> 00:38:03,931
Yes, miss Cameron.
You made it.

711
00:38:30,322 --> 00:38:33,025
These, um...

712
00:38:33,092 --> 00:38:36,327
They didn't ruin anything,
did they?

713
00:38:36,395 --> 00:38:39,364
Just
your sister's reputation.

714
00:38:57,715 --> 00:38:59,650
We're getting her
out of your way.

715
00:38:59,717 --> 00:39:00,717
I bet your pardon?

716
00:39:00,785 --> 00:39:02,286
Your sister.

717
00:39:02,353 --> 00:39:03,720
Can't have her impinging
on your ability

718
00:39:03,788 --> 00:39:05,422
to function covertly.

719
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:07,491
I'll have her reassigned.

720
00:39:07,559 --> 00:39:08,559
You won't be flying
together anymore.

721
00:39:08,626 --> 00:39:09,725
No.

722
00:39:11,127 --> 00:39:13,062
No.

723
00:39:13,129 --> 00:39:15,030
She's not in my way.

724
00:39:15,098 --> 00:39:17,700
She's perfectly capable.

725
00:39:17,767 --> 00:39:21,204
I can assure you
that my sister is not

726
00:39:21,271 --> 00:39:24,073
and will not be a problem.

727
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:11,250
Laura?

728
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,454
Laura?

729
00:40:21,693 --> 00:40:23,927
Hi, dollface.

730
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:28,366
Well, it ain't much,
but it's home.

731
00:40:28,433 --> 00:40:30,200
Welcome aboard.
