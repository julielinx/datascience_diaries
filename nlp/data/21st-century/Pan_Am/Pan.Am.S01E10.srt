1
00:00:01,246 --> 00:00:02,479
<i>Previously on "Pan Am"...</i>

2
00:00:02,547 --> 00:00:03,747
I bet you've got a few surprises
under that cute blue hat.

3
00:00:03,814 --> 00:00:05,949
Is that smoke? That speech
is government property.

4
00:00:06,017 --> 00:00:07,617
Not anymore.

5
00:00:07,685 --> 00:00:10,354
Marry me!
I-I can't say yes now.

6
00:00:10,422 --> 00:00:12,422
Teddy? Look at you.

7
00:00:14,258 --> 00:00:16,125
I'm not going to let myself
get hurt again.

8
00:00:16,193 --> 00:00:18,928
This is real.

9
00:00:18,995 --> 00:00:20,796
A Pan Am stewardess can travel
all around the world

10
00:00:20,864 --> 00:00:21,964
without suspicion.

11
00:00:22,032 --> 00:00:23,299
And what if I refuse?

12
00:00:23,367 --> 00:00:26,269
We can make this your last
mission and your last flight.

13
00:00:26,336 --> 00:00:27,803
Uhh!

14
00:00:27,871 --> 00:00:29,271
Aah!

15
00:00:36,379 --> 00:00:38,480
That was never
supposed to happen.

16
00:00:38,548 --> 00:00:40,115
But now that it has,

17
00:00:40,183 --> 00:00:41,516
there are certain protocols
we have to follow,

18
00:00:41,584 --> 00:00:42,517
do you understand?

19
00:00:42,585 --> 00:00:43,952
You'll need an alibi

20
00:00:44,019 --> 00:00:47,388
in case anyone saw you
follow him here tonight.

21
00:00:47,456 --> 00:00:50,458
Kate, I need you to focus.

22
00:00:50,525 --> 00:00:51,592
Think.

23
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:55,028
Did anyone see you
follow him here tonight?

24
00:00:55,097 --> 00:00:56,597
I don't know.

25
00:00:56,664 --> 00:00:59,766
Scotland Yard will investigate,
and MI6 will want answers.

26
00:00:59,834 --> 00:01:01,901
Kate...

27
00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:04,504
Look at me.

28
00:01:04,572 --> 00:01:07,240
Right now you have to run.

29
00:01:26,326 --> 00:01:28,193
Bridget?

30
00:01:28,261 --> 00:01:30,895
Kate. I'm back.

31
00:01:30,963 --> 00:01:32,030
Back from the dead.

32
00:01:33,665 --> 00:01:35,333
Where have you been?

33
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,235
What are you doing here?

34
00:01:37,302 --> 00:01:39,937
Well, I was hoping
you could tell me that.

35
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,375
Sync and corrected by dr.jackson
for www.addic7ed.com

36
00:01:47,397 --> 00:01:48,664
Well, according to my horoscope,

37
00:01:48,731 --> 00:01:51,800
I can expect a great opportunity
to present itself.

38
00:01:51,868 --> 00:01:53,869
Let's hope that means
Mike Ruskin

39
00:01:53,937 --> 00:01:56,138
is going to help me
publish my article.

40
00:01:56,206 --> 00:01:58,040
I didn't even know
you wanted to be a journalist.

41
00:01:58,108 --> 00:01:59,942
What I want
is for the entire world

42
00:02:00,009 --> 00:02:02,578
to hate
congressman Christopher Rawlings

43
00:02:02,645 --> 00:02:06,514
and his nuclear
death monger agenda.

44
00:02:06,582 --> 00:02:09,217
If I happen to become
a world-famous journalist

45
00:02:09,285 --> 00:02:11,486
in the process, so be it.

46
00:02:11,554 --> 00:02:14,089
He didn't seem like
a death monger.

47
00:02:14,156 --> 00:02:15,957
Looks can be deceiving.

48
00:02:16,024 --> 00:02:17,292
Stay there.

49
00:02:17,359 --> 00:02:19,527
My teacher said lighting
is the key

50
00:02:19,595 --> 00:02:21,528
to revelatory photography.

51
00:02:21,597 --> 00:02:23,464
I'm forgetting why
I volunteered for this.

52
00:02:23,531 --> 00:02:26,767
Because this week's assignment
is portraits,

53
00:02:26,835 --> 00:02:30,237
and I told you that I needed
somebody with a beautiful face.

54
00:02:30,305 --> 00:02:32,773
Ah. Now I remember.

55
00:02:32,841 --> 00:02:35,576
Oh, fudge.

56
00:02:35,643 --> 00:02:39,345
Lightbulbs...
Kitchen, second drawer.

57
00:02:40,915 --> 00:02:43,449
Ooh! Your horoscope says

58
00:02:43,517 --> 00:02:46,385
that you'll meet
a tall, handsome man.

59
00:02:47,822 --> 00:02:48,822
Hi.

60
00:02:51,191 --> 00:02:53,025
Was that congressman Rawlings?

61
00:02:53,093 --> 00:02:54,026
No.

62
00:02:55,161 --> 00:02:56,394
Don't!

63
00:02:56,462 --> 00:02:58,097
Maggie, you're acting crazy.

64
00:02:58,164 --> 00:02:59,632
He might be here to arrest me.

65
00:02:59,699 --> 00:03:01,767
Arrest you? For what?

66
00:03:01,835 --> 00:03:04,770
I-I might have
set his hotel room on fire.

67
00:03:04,838 --> 00:03:07,606
London? That was you?

68
00:03:07,673 --> 00:03:09,807
Well,
I can't actually arrest you.

69
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:12,276
I'm not
a law enforcement official.

70
00:03:12,344 --> 00:03:13,845
Plus I forgot my handcuffs.

71
00:03:13,912 --> 00:03:16,881
But something tells me
you might have your own set.

72
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:18,716
I heard you could
strangle Republicans with them,

73
00:03:18,784 --> 00:03:21,218
so I thought I should
invest in a pair.

74
00:03:21,286 --> 00:03:22,219
Hmm.

75
00:03:22,287 --> 00:03:23,621
Nice hair.

76
00:03:27,725 --> 00:03:28,959
Why are you here?

77
00:03:29,027 --> 00:03:30,527
Specifically, you haven't
been returning my calls,

78
00:03:30,594 --> 00:03:32,595
and I'd like to have lunch
with you tomorrow.

79
00:03:32,664 --> 00:03:35,231
More generally,
I think you might be insane,

80
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:37,100
but you intrigue me.

81
00:03:37,168 --> 00:03:38,702
Lunch? With you?

82
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:40,469
I'd rather chew off my own leg.

83
00:03:40,537 --> 00:03:42,571
Fair enough.
Just one question...

84
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,873
If you hate me so much,

85
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:46,142
why do you care
what you look like right now?

86
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:49,945
It's a good question.

87
00:03:50,013 --> 00:03:52,481
Call me.
I'm staying at the Ritz.

88
00:03:52,549 --> 00:03:54,684
Oh, and, uh,
nice to see you again,

89
00:03:54,751 --> 00:03:56,751
Maggie's blonde
stewardess friend.

90
00:03:56,819 --> 00:04:00,454
Oh. You, too...
Mr. congressman... sir.

91
00:04:02,191 --> 00:04:05,160
Sometimes opposites attract.

92
00:04:06,595 --> 00:04:10,264
More like out of sight,
out of mind.

93
00:04:10,332 --> 00:04:12,666
I think that you two
would make a perfect couple.

94
00:04:12,734 --> 00:04:15,602
- Me and Charles Talcott?
- Yes.

95
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,537
You can't be serious.

96
00:04:17,605 --> 00:04:20,708
I'd have to fight that awful
bulldog of his for attention.

97
00:04:20,775 --> 00:04:22,142
I don't know.
He's very fancy.

98
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:23,643
Oh, and fancy
is perfect for me?

99
00:04:23,712 --> 00:04:25,012
What was the name
of your horse again?

100
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:25,979
Which one?

101
00:04:26,047 --> 00:04:27,014
Exactly.

102
00:04:27,082 --> 00:04:30,750
Okay. Maybe I grew up fancy.

103
00:04:30,818 --> 00:04:32,719
But that's not
what I'm looking for.

104
00:04:32,786 --> 00:04:35,455
Then what? Snooty?
Stuffy?

105
00:04:35,523 --> 00:04:37,857
Well, after four
marvelous days in London

106
00:04:37,925 --> 00:04:40,293
and three in New York,

107
00:04:40,361 --> 00:04:45,231
I suspect all this time
I was looking for you.

108
00:04:47,767 --> 00:04:49,201
Mmm.

109
00:04:49,269 --> 00:04:51,837
Teddy, it's getting late.

110
00:04:51,904 --> 00:04:54,373
Uh, I haven't seen the inside
of your place yet, though.

111
00:04:54,441 --> 00:04:56,642
The inside of my place

112
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:58,977
is being
very diligently preserved

113
00:04:59,045 --> 00:05:00,845
for one very special man.

114
00:05:00,912 --> 00:05:02,980
That's me. I'm special.

115
00:05:03,048 --> 00:05:04,849
Not if you don't
get some sleep.

116
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:07,785
Big day tomorrow.
Lunch with your father,

117
00:05:07,853 --> 00:05:09,854
the ever-imposing
Mr. Vanderway.

118
00:05:09,921 --> 00:05:12,557
And the mood is killed.

119
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:14,158
Good night, Teddy.

120
00:05:14,226 --> 00:05:15,860
Good night, Amanda.

121
00:05:18,129 --> 00:05:19,129
Hmm.

122
00:05:20,465 --> 00:05:21,965
- What was his name?
- No, no, no, no.

123
00:05:22,032 --> 00:05:24,468
Bedford... Bed... Bedford?

124
00:05:24,535 --> 00:05:26,770
I doubt he's even
that handsome offstage.

125
00:05:26,837 --> 00:05:29,005
But they wear makeup, you know?

126
00:05:29,073 --> 00:05:31,308
Redford. Robert Redford.

127
00:05:31,376 --> 00:05:32,942
Fine. See? Even the name...

128
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:34,510
He just sounds like
a prima donna.

129
00:05:34,578 --> 00:05:37,680
It might be worth it
to wake up to that face.

130
00:05:37,748 --> 00:05:40,318
Aw. "Take me to go see 'Barefoot
in the park, '" she says.

131
00:05:40,705 --> 00:05:42,005
"It'll be romantic."

132
00:05:42,073 --> 00:05:44,007
Aw. I'm teasing you.

133
00:05:44,075 --> 00:05:47,210
It was a wonderful night.

134
00:05:47,277 --> 00:05:49,645
Yeah.
And if I squint my eyes...

135
00:05:49,713 --> 00:05:51,146
Yes, you do look like him.

136
00:05:52,682 --> 00:05:55,217
And the French don't have
a sense of humor, they say.

137
00:05:55,284 --> 00:05:56,952
Don't worry.
I won't tell anybody.

138
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,654
It'll be our little secret.

139
00:05:58,722 --> 00:06:00,656
Oh, I thought
you didn't like secrets.

140
00:06:00,724 --> 00:06:02,557
Well, depends who's keeping it.

141
00:06:02,626 --> 00:06:05,126
Well, then,
I might have one for you.

142
00:06:05,193 --> 00:06:07,361
<i>-Really?</i>
- When we get to London.

143
00:06:07,429 --> 00:06:09,430
Really? What is it?
Animal? Vegetable?

144
00:06:09,498 --> 00:06:10,431
- Oh...
- Mineral?

145
00:06:10,499 --> 00:06:11,833
- I can't tell you.
- Come on.

146
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,467
No, it's a secret.

147
00:06:13,535 --> 00:06:16,804
I have ways of making you talk.

148
00:06:16,872 --> 00:06:18,640
- Oh, yes?
- Mm-hmm.

149
00:06:18,707 --> 00:06:19,706
How?

150
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:30,253
Oh, I admit it will be difficult
to make it all the way to London

151
00:06:30,321 --> 00:06:33,923
without spilling
this little secret of us.

152
00:06:36,826 --> 00:06:39,728
Who said that us
has to be a secret?

153
00:06:42,265 --> 00:06:45,601
Apparently, it all came
to a head in London.

154
00:06:45,669 --> 00:06:47,135
What did you hear?

155
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:51,639
That there was a mission
last week...

156
00:06:51,707 --> 00:06:53,408
To swap out a list of names...

157
00:06:53,475 --> 00:06:56,778
Compromised agents, assets...

158
00:06:56,845 --> 00:06:58,746
And I was on it.

159
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:04,952
But now, with that list
off the market, I can come home.

160
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,621
I can get my life back.

161
00:07:07,689 --> 00:07:08,988
That's wonderful, Bridget.

162
00:07:09,056 --> 00:07:10,857
Really.

163
00:07:10,925 --> 00:07:13,427
What is the first thing
you're going to do?

164
00:07:13,494 --> 00:07:15,495
Get my job back
at Pan Am, of course.

165
00:07:16,631 --> 00:07:19,499
And Dean.

166
00:07:19,567 --> 00:07:22,167
I've come back for Dean.

167
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:36,478
I hear you have a houseguest.

168
00:07:36,546 --> 00:07:39,647
Yes. Thank you
for the heads up.

169
00:07:39,715 --> 00:07:41,116
We thought you could be useful

170
00:07:41,184 --> 00:07:43,819
in helping Bridget
with her... transition.

171
00:07:43,886 --> 00:07:45,987
The thing is, Richard,
I'm tired of being useful,

172
00:07:46,055 --> 00:07:48,190
and I'm tired of being
at your beck and call.

173
00:07:48,257 --> 00:07:49,757
I want out.

174
00:07:49,826 --> 00:07:53,360
You've made your wishes known.
It's all been arranged.

175
00:07:53,428 --> 00:07:56,363
You'll be debriefed by MI6
when you get to London,

176
00:07:56,431 --> 00:07:58,565
polygraph,
then you're on your way.

177
00:07:58,633 --> 00:08:01,568
Polygraph?

178
00:08:01,636 --> 00:08:03,904
I have to take
a lie detector test?

179
00:08:03,972 --> 00:08:05,906
It's standard
in cases like this.

180
00:08:05,974 --> 00:08:08,575
You were a witness
to a shooting, after all.

181
00:08:10,477 --> 00:08:11,845
Witness.

182
00:08:11,912 --> 00:08:14,047
MI6 will want to make sure
all the I's are dotted

183
00:08:14,114 --> 00:08:15,548
and the T's are crossed.

184
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:18,852
We do have a dead body
on our hands, Kate.

185
00:08:20,587 --> 00:08:22,288
Yes, of course.

186
00:08:22,356 --> 00:08:24,057
No worries.

187
00:08:24,124 --> 00:08:27,860
Just tell the truth,
and you'll be free and clear.

188
00:08:27,927 --> 00:08:32,998
And you and I
can bid each other adieu.

189
00:08:33,293 --> 00:08:35,595
You done good, kid.

190
00:08:43,836 --> 00:08:46,771
- Really, Mike?
- I pegged you as tidy.

191
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:48,640
Is there a secret password?

192
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:50,575
Uh, "abracadabra," maybe?

193
00:08:50,643 --> 00:08:52,878
"Open sesame"?

194
00:08:52,945 --> 00:08:54,178
Maggie, thanks for coming.

195
00:08:54,246 --> 00:08:55,679
I was so excited
to get your call.

196
00:08:55,747 --> 00:08:57,080
I'm ready.

197
00:08:57,148 --> 00:08:58,616
Ready for what?

198
00:08:58,683 --> 00:09:01,652
Uh, my meeting with your editor.
About my article?

199
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,420
Uh... <i>No.</i>

200
00:09:03,488 --> 00:09:06,757
I actually called you
down here to, uh,

201
00:09:06,825 --> 00:09:09,393
give you, uh...

202
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:10,360
These.

203
00:09:10,428 --> 00:09:12,595
Uh, I don't understand.

204
00:09:12,663 --> 00:09:13,630
What <i>are</i> these?

205
00:09:13,697 --> 00:09:15,097
Political articles.

206
00:09:15,165 --> 00:09:18,434
- And I should read them because?
- They're very well written.

207
00:09:18,502 --> 00:09:20,469
- And my article was...
- Not so well written.

208
00:09:21,972 --> 00:09:24,508
Wow. Mike, I don't know
what to say about that.

209
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:27,814
Maggie, listen... you're
passionate. That's a good thing.

210
00:09:27,882 --> 00:09:29,416
And you're smart.
That's even better.

211
00:09:29,483 --> 00:09:31,552
A-and you spell really well,

212
00:09:31,619 --> 00:09:33,654
which is pretty much crucial
to the whole process.

213
00:09:33,721 --> 00:09:36,322
So it's just
the words you hated.

214
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:38,659
You're the one who's doing
the hating. That's the problem.

215
00:09:38,726 --> 00:09:41,562
Your article
was an angry diatribe.

216
00:09:41,629 --> 00:09:43,495
Uh, so the folks
who agree with you

217
00:09:43,564 --> 00:09:45,464
are going to get a kick
out of it,

218
00:09:45,532 --> 00:09:47,499
but so what?
They already agree with you.

219
00:09:47,568 --> 00:09:49,835
You have to find an angle...

220
00:09:49,903 --> 00:09:51,070
Why does he believe
what he believes?

221
00:09:51,137 --> 00:09:52,838
Uh, where's he coming from?

222
00:09:52,906 --> 00:09:54,273
You have to lead the reader in

223
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:58,143
and convince them that
you're right with the facts.

224
00:09:58,211 --> 00:09:59,578
I thought I did that.

225
00:09:59,645 --> 00:10:03,582
You led the reader in and beat
them with a baseball bat.

226
00:10:03,649 --> 00:10:06,250
Maggie, you're capable of it.

227
00:10:06,318 --> 00:10:08,553
Y-you just gotta dig deeper.

228
00:10:08,621 --> 00:10:09,854
Ruskin?!

229
00:10:09,922 --> 00:10:13,858
Oh, I've got to run
to an editorial meeting.

230
00:10:13,926 --> 00:10:14,892
Do you, uh,

231
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,326
you wanna do chumley's
next week?

232
00:10:16,394 --> 00:10:18,495
Oh, sure. Of course.

233
00:10:36,001 --> 00:10:38,736
The Ritz, please.

234
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:41,739
Oh! Edward Vanderway.
Lieutenant, U.S. Navy.

235
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:44,041
- Serial number 653...
- Knock it off.

236
00:10:44,109 --> 00:10:46,743
I'm never going to
figure out lighting.

237
00:10:46,811 --> 00:10:48,078
Sure you will.

238
00:10:48,145 --> 00:10:49,279
You're just not gonna get
any good pictures

239
00:10:49,347 --> 00:10:50,547
with this old thing.

240
00:10:50,615 --> 00:10:53,283
But I'm a beginner, Ted.
My sister gave it to me.

241
00:10:53,351 --> 00:10:54,818
If you don't want to be here...

242
00:10:54,885 --> 00:10:57,454
I'm just teasing. Jeez.

243
00:10:57,522 --> 00:10:59,122
So what's the assignment?

244
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:02,725
Men of great character?
Most eligible bachelors?

245
00:11:02,792 --> 00:11:04,560
I have to photograph one beautiful face...

246
00:11:04,628 --> 00:11:06,629
And one unusual one.

247
00:11:06,697 --> 00:11:09,031
What, seriously?
Who... who's your other subject?

248
00:11:09,099 --> 00:11:10,766
- Maggie.
- Oh, okay.

249
00:11:10,834 --> 00:11:14,303
For a second there, I thought
I was the weirdo face.

250
00:11:14,371 --> 00:11:15,571
Yeah.

251
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:17,639
- Okay. I think I've got it.
- Good.

252
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:25,005
Hey, can I ask you,
um, something?

253
00:11:25,073 --> 00:11:28,075
Did you and, uh, Craig,
you know, uh, do it?

254
00:11:29,778 --> 00:11:32,145
That is none of your business,

255
00:11:32,213 --> 00:11:35,281
and for the last time,
my fiance's name was Greg.

256
00:11:35,349 --> 00:11:36,649
<i>-Greg.</i>
- Right.

257
00:11:36,717 --> 00:11:38,418
Right. Greg.

258
00:11:38,486 --> 00:11:40,653
Um, so I'm guessing everything's
still in the lockbox?

259
00:11:40,721 --> 00:11:42,221
Stop talking.

260
00:11:42,289 --> 00:11:44,791
Is there anything
that Greg could... Craig...

261
00:11:44,859 --> 00:11:47,427
Greg... could have done,
uh, different

262
00:11:47,495 --> 00:11:51,697
uh, to, uh, you know,
make things... unlocked?

263
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,102
If you think for one moment
that I'm going to coach you

264
00:11:57,169 --> 00:11:59,571
on how to get into
some poor girl's pants...

265
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:00,739
Don't smile.

266
00:12:02,174 --> 00:12:04,542
She's not a poor girl.
She's a very, very rich girl

267
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:06,010
who I spent
the entire week with.

268
00:12:06,077 --> 00:12:08,379
Nonstop. Except for when
things do stop...

269
00:12:08,447 --> 00:12:11,115
Abruptly, because of
her strict pants-on policy.

270
00:12:11,182 --> 00:12:13,686
- Amanda? From London?
- Yeah.

271
00:12:13,713 --> 00:12:16,047
Turns out she's better
than advertised.

272
00:12:16,115 --> 00:12:18,617
But I saw her
come out of your room.

273
00:12:18,685 --> 00:12:20,818
We were necking like
a couple puppy dogs

274
00:12:20,886 --> 00:12:23,388
with peanut butter,
but that is it.

275
00:12:23,455 --> 00:12:25,923
- Hmm.
- What "huh"?

276
00:12:25,991 --> 00:12:28,859
Ted Vanderway finds a girl
he's willing to wait for.

277
00:12:28,927 --> 00:12:30,395
I'm not willing to wait.

278
00:12:30,462 --> 00:12:32,697
That... that's my point.
I mean, sure,

279
00:12:32,765 --> 00:12:35,465
a-Amanda I-is smart and funny
a-and beautiful,

280
00:12:35,533 --> 00:12:38,034
but seriously, what is
the point of boiling water

281
00:12:38,102 --> 00:12:39,536
if you're not gonna make
the hot toddy?

282
00:12:39,604 --> 00:12:42,806
Well, I think falling in love
may suit you.

283
00:12:42,873 --> 00:12:44,808
No, we're having lunch later
today with my father,

284
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:46,276
so I-I think after that,

285
00:12:46,344 --> 00:12:48,412
I'm gonna have to
put the brakes on this one.

286
00:12:48,479 --> 00:12:50,013
- Ted?
- Hmm?

287
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,316
I want to respect you right now,
but you don't make it easy.

288
00:12:53,383 --> 00:12:55,184
And you look like a statue.

289
00:12:57,887 --> 00:13:00,489
I-I thought you'd respect me
if I was honest.

290
00:13:00,557 --> 00:13:02,692
All I'm saying is
there are some girls

291
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:05,461
who are saving themselves
for marriage, and I admire that.

292
00:13:07,163 --> 00:13:08,363
I'm just not one of them.

293
00:13:08,431 --> 00:13:09,831
Wait. What?

294
00:13:09,898 --> 00:13:11,666
Ha.

295
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:16,726
Did you see this?

296
00:13:16,794 --> 00:13:18,461
2,000 screaming Beatles fans

297
00:13:18,529 --> 00:13:20,129
showed up at Heathrow
last night.

298
00:13:20,197 --> 00:13:21,964
Yeah, apparently,
"the fab four" were

299
00:13:22,032 --> 00:13:25,166
- returning from Sweden...
- And word got out.

300
00:13:25,234 --> 00:13:27,101
Well, I hear
they're very popular.

301
00:13:27,169 --> 00:13:29,003
You know...

302
00:13:29,071 --> 00:13:30,572
They have girl hair. Right?

303
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,007
Well, it doesn't
seem to bother their fans.

304
00:13:34,977 --> 00:13:37,145
Um, can I cash this check,
please?

305
00:13:37,213 --> 00:13:38,746
British pounds.

306
00:13:38,814 --> 00:13:41,215
Uh, you can go ahead
and make that dollars.

307
00:13:41,282 --> 00:13:43,551
I need money for London.

308
00:13:43,618 --> 00:13:45,085
Pounds sterling.

309
00:13:45,153 --> 00:13:46,153
Thank you.

310
00:13:46,221 --> 00:13:48,656
For what? Five-star dinner
in Balentine?

311
00:13:48,724 --> 00:13:50,123
Tickets to the ballet,

312
00:13:50,191 --> 00:13:52,526
then darts and drinks
at the squid and wiggle?

313
00:13:52,594 --> 00:13:54,194
Yeah, we're doing all of that,

314
00:13:54,262 --> 00:13:56,062
and you're not paying
for anything.

315
00:13:56,129 --> 00:13:57,296
No?

316
00:13:58,732 --> 00:13:59,999
Dean.

317
00:14:00,066 --> 00:14:02,134
What?
You don't like the ballet?

318
00:14:02,202 --> 00:14:04,003
Dean.

319
00:14:09,975 --> 00:14:12,811
Hello, Dean.

320
00:14:18,518 --> 00:14:20,485
Colette...

321
00:14:20,553 --> 00:14:22,021
May we have a moment?

322
00:14:22,089 --> 00:14:24,355
Of course.

323
00:14:26,325 --> 00:14:28,193
I'll be on the plane.

324
00:14:55,419 --> 00:14:59,388
I've spent every night for
months imagining our reunion

325
00:14:59,456 --> 00:15:02,892
and... and what I'd say to you
when I saw you.

326
00:15:03,914 --> 00:15:05,682
Look...

327
00:15:05,749 --> 00:15:09,185
I can't, for the life of me,
remember what I said.

328
00:15:09,252 --> 00:15:11,420
What did I say?

329
00:15:11,488 --> 00:15:12,621
When?

330
00:15:12,689 --> 00:15:13,922
Every night.

331
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:15,824
Every night,
when you imagined this moment,

332
00:15:15,892 --> 00:15:17,425
what did I say?

333
00:15:17,494 --> 00:15:20,095
That you were angry,

334
00:15:20,162 --> 00:15:22,464
betrayed, confused.

335
00:15:22,532 --> 00:15:24,432
The list was fairly extensive,

336
00:15:24,501 --> 00:15:26,234
and you have all the right
to be all those things.

337
00:15:26,302 --> 00:15:28,102
I-I can't imagine
what you're feeling right now.

338
00:15:28,169 --> 00:15:31,138
Why are you even here, Bridget?

339
00:15:31,206 --> 00:15:33,273
I've been reinstated
back at Pan Am.

340
00:15:33,901 --> 00:15:35,802
They're flying me to London
on the 2:00.

341
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:38,038
You're a passenger?

342
00:15:38,105 --> 00:15:39,640
On my flight?

343
00:15:39,707 --> 00:15:41,908
I-I was hoping
that when we touch down,

344
00:15:41,976 --> 00:15:43,876
we could have dinner, and I
could explain what happened

345
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,678
and where I've been.

346
00:15:45,745 --> 00:15:48,747
All those nights...

347
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:51,050
You imagining what I would say
in this moment,

348
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:52,818
and it never
even occurred to you

349
00:15:52,886 --> 00:15:57,290
that I might just do
exactly what you did...

350
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:01,493
Leave.

351
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,364
Oh. I'm so clumsy.

352
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:07,866
Oh, let me help you.

353
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:09,902
I got it.

354
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,138
Colette, what's wrong?

355
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:14,306
Bridget is back.

356
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,809
I know.
I saw her this morning.

357
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:25,950
Hey, Kate.
Could you give us a minute?

358
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:27,452
Yes, of course.

359
00:16:35,026 --> 00:16:36,159
You okay?

360
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:38,395
I don't know.

361
00:16:38,463 --> 00:16:40,331
Are you?

362
00:16:40,398 --> 00:16:43,367
Yeah. Fine.

363
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:45,736
We can talk about this later.

364
00:16:48,149 --> 00:16:49,750
There is nothing to talk about.

365
00:16:49,818 --> 00:16:52,552
Okay, nothing's changed.

366
00:16:52,621 --> 00:16:54,622
It is you and me, Colette.

367
00:16:54,689 --> 00:16:55,956
That's all that matters.

368
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,193
You hear me?

369
00:17:02,097 --> 00:17:03,764
I hear you.

370
00:17:06,001 --> 00:17:07,134
Okay.

371
00:17:12,807 --> 00:17:14,241
Something you wanna tell me?

372
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:18,511
I was waiting
for the right moment.

373
00:17:18,578 --> 00:17:21,781
I guess I waited too long.

374
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:24,117
Welcome to Pan Am.

375
00:17:24,184 --> 00:17:26,252
Welcome to Pan Am.

376
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,087
Welcome to Pan Am.

377
00:17:31,358 --> 00:17:32,390
Kate.

378
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:33,625
Welcome.

379
00:17:33,693 --> 00:17:34,860
Colette.

380
00:17:34,927 --> 00:17:36,294
Welcome to Pan Am.

381
00:17:36,362 --> 00:17:38,897
I haven't had a chance
to say a proper hello.

382
00:17:40,867 --> 00:17:42,034
Welcome.

383
00:17:42,101 --> 00:17:43,702
Thank you.

384
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:46,304
Is this where all
the congressmen hang out?

385
00:17:46,372 --> 00:17:48,338
Well, only if they love
a good burger.

386
00:17:48,406 --> 00:17:50,407
Can I get some vinegar
with those fries? Vinegar?

387
00:17:50,475 --> 00:17:52,342
It's a nasty habit I picked up
from the brits.

388
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:54,244
They keep a bottle
behind the counter here.

389
00:17:54,312 --> 00:17:56,847
You must come here a lot.

390
00:17:56,915 --> 00:17:59,316
Actually, I used to work here.

391
00:17:59,384 --> 00:18:02,352
That's how I put myself
through law school.

392
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,821
I have two older sisters.
Dad was a longshoreman.

393
00:18:04,889 --> 00:18:07,991
I played trumpet
in high school.

394
00:18:08,059 --> 00:18:12,395
And, um, I wet the bed
till I was 11.

395
00:18:12,462 --> 00:18:15,765
Why are
you telling me all this?

396
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:18,668
In the desperate hope
that who I am as a person

397
00:18:18,736 --> 00:18:21,503
is more interesting to you
than who I am as a politician.

398
00:18:21,571 --> 00:18:23,873
Ohh.
You're trying to distract me.

399
00:18:23,954 --> 00:18:26,154
I'm trying to tell you...

400
00:18:26,222 --> 00:18:28,156
I like you.

401
00:18:31,895 --> 00:18:33,995
Scotch, please.
Make it a quadruple.

402
00:18:34,063 --> 00:18:37,098
And then pour half of that
into a second glass.

403
00:18:37,165 --> 00:18:39,000
Add two cubes of ice to each,

404
00:18:39,068 --> 00:18:40,969
and deliver them
with water backs.

405
00:18:42,938 --> 00:18:44,538
You want me to get through lunch
with my dad?

406
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:46,440
I'm protecting you
from yourself.

407
00:18:46,508 --> 00:18:47,875
It's what friends do.

408
00:18:47,943 --> 00:18:49,743
Friends?

409
00:18:49,811 --> 00:18:51,678
I don't need any more friends.

410
00:18:51,746 --> 00:18:53,847
But only one girlfriend...

411
00:18:53,915 --> 00:18:55,048
I hope?

412
00:18:55,116 --> 00:18:58,752
Amanda, um, look,
we need to talk.

413
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,253
- Edward.
- Hey, pop.

414
00:19:00,321 --> 00:19:02,355
- Mr. Vanderway.
- Amanda.

415
00:19:02,423 --> 00:19:06,592
I just finished the back nine
at winged foot with your dad.

416
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,260
Since when are
you desperate enough

417
00:19:08,328 --> 00:19:09,895
to spend time with my son?

418
00:19:18,139 --> 00:19:20,906
Ah. Thank you.

419
00:19:23,356 --> 00:19:25,558
Colette.

420
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:27,326
Do you have a moment?

421
00:19:28,696 --> 00:19:31,330
Of course.

422
00:19:31,398 --> 00:19:35,267
It must be strange,
me turning up like this.

423
00:19:35,335 --> 00:19:37,736
It is a little odd.

424
00:19:39,872 --> 00:19:42,307
We heard you were married.

425
00:19:42,374 --> 00:19:43,608
What?

426
00:19:43,676 --> 00:19:45,110
No.

427
00:19:45,178 --> 00:19:47,345
Nothing could be further
from the truth, Colette.

428
00:19:47,413 --> 00:19:50,182
Then what is the truth,
Bridget?

429
00:19:51,953 --> 00:19:54,454
I was sick.

430
00:19:54,522 --> 00:19:57,423
Very, very sick.

431
00:19:57,492 --> 00:19:59,593
I didn't want to burden anyone,

432
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,094
most of all, Dean.

433
00:20:01,161 --> 00:20:03,763
I'm so sorry.

434
00:20:03,831 --> 00:20:06,165
I never stopped loving him.

435
00:20:06,233 --> 00:20:08,634
I know he doesn't want
to talk to me and I...

436
00:20:08,702 --> 00:20:10,135
I don't blame him.

437
00:20:10,203 --> 00:20:13,939
But you two are friends.

438
00:20:14,007 --> 00:20:17,042
Can you ask him
to give me a chance?

439
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:19,444
Just to explain myself.

440
00:20:20,947 --> 00:20:23,448
Please, Colette?

441
00:20:25,034 --> 00:20:26,901
Yes.

442
00:20:28,904 --> 00:20:30,639
Excuse me, miss, uh,

443
00:20:30,706 --> 00:20:33,508
I need another Tom Collins,
please.

444
00:20:39,214 --> 00:20:40,714
Scotland yard is none too happy

445
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:42,283
about the jeweler's murder,

446
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:44,918
nor are they convinced
it was a simple robbery.

447
00:20:44,986 --> 00:20:48,055
You made it look like
a break-in, you took jewels...

448
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:50,191
Well, not enough,
it would seem.

449
00:20:50,258 --> 00:20:52,493
But it was a mission.

450
00:20:52,561 --> 00:20:54,127
- He was selling...
- It was a botched mission.

451
00:20:54,195 --> 00:20:55,861
The man in question
may have been a traitor,

452
00:20:55,929 --> 00:20:57,697
but for various reasons,

453
00:20:57,764 --> 00:20:59,632
Scotland yard
can't know about that.

454
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,441
Richard thinks
you pulled the trigger.

455
00:21:08,509 --> 00:21:10,242
Yes, of course he does.

456
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,577
That's what I told him.

457
00:21:11,644 --> 00:21:13,078
Why?

458
00:21:13,145 --> 00:21:15,847
To avoid further speculation,
MI6 would love to give

459
00:21:15,915 --> 00:21:19,084
Scotland Yard
somebody's head on a platter,

460
00:21:19,151 --> 00:21:21,620
which is why I have sworn
up and down

461
00:21:21,688 --> 00:21:23,988
that <i>i</i> was the shooter.

462
00:21:24,056 --> 00:21:27,592
You were merely
an unfortunate witness.

463
00:21:27,659 --> 00:21:29,427
You lie to protect me.

464
00:21:29,494 --> 00:21:33,464
MI6 won't hand <i>me</i> over
to Scotland yard,

465
00:21:33,532 --> 00:21:36,166
but they might sacrifice you.

466
00:21:36,235 --> 00:21:38,969
Unfortunately,

467
00:21:39,037 --> 00:21:42,939
they don't entirely believe
my story.

468
00:21:43,006 --> 00:21:44,341
Why not?

469
00:21:44,408 --> 00:21:46,175
That is irrelevant.

470
00:21:46,244 --> 00:21:47,711
The point is,

471
00:21:47,778 --> 00:21:50,046
you have to take that polygraph

472
00:21:50,114 --> 00:21:52,215
and you have to lie...

473
00:21:52,283 --> 00:21:54,050
For both of our sakes.

474
00:21:54,118 --> 00:21:56,953
How do I do that?

475
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:59,221
Don't worry.
I'll teach you how.

476
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,659
Little known secret...
When Edward was a little boy,

477
00:22:07,699 --> 00:22:09,734
he refused to finger paint.

478
00:22:09,801 --> 00:22:11,269
- Really?
- I didn't see the point.

479
00:22:11,337 --> 00:22:12,904
It's not like we couldn't afford
the brushes.

480
00:22:12,972 --> 00:22:14,805
Alice used to sit
next to his high chair

481
00:22:14,874 --> 00:22:16,307
with a wet towel

482
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:17,674
because he wanted
to be cleaned off

483
00:22:17,742 --> 00:22:19,276
every time he touched the food.

484
00:22:19,344 --> 00:22:20,978
I'm sure this is all
very fascinating for Amanda,

485
00:22:21,045 --> 00:22:22,312
but maybe we could talk
about something else.

486
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,882
The point is, Edward never liked
to get his hands dirty.

487
00:22:24,949 --> 00:22:26,416
Still doesn't.

488
00:22:26,484 --> 00:22:27,751
I live in Manhattan. It's not
like I got a back 40 to plow.

489
00:22:27,818 --> 00:22:29,452
Figure of speech, son.

490
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,454
It means
you don't apply yourself.

491
00:22:31,522 --> 00:22:32,923
Maybe if you did,
you'd be captain

492
00:22:32,991 --> 00:22:34,624
instead of just first officer.

493
00:22:34,692 --> 00:22:35,825
Hey, you know what?

494
00:22:35,893 --> 00:22:37,494
You know, speaking
of little-known secrets,

495
00:22:37,561 --> 00:22:39,396
Mr. Vanderway,

496
00:22:39,463 --> 00:22:41,964
daddy told me that
your freshman year at Warwick,

497
00:22:42,032 --> 00:22:43,132
you were part

498
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,001
of the theater club's
annual light opera.

499
00:22:45,068 --> 00:22:46,436
I don't remember that.

500
00:22:46,504 --> 00:22:48,638
- No. No.
- I'm certain it was you.

501
00:22:48,683 --> 00:22:52,018
Teddy, I bet you didn't know
your father was an actor.

502
00:22:52,087 --> 00:22:54,488
No, I didn't, Amanda.

503
00:22:54,556 --> 00:22:57,324
Daddy said you were desperate
to join the club,

504
00:22:57,392 --> 00:22:59,460
but there weren't
any male roles left,

505
00:22:59,527 --> 00:23:02,596
so you volunteered to play
one of the female roles.

506
00:23:02,663 --> 00:23:04,530
You played a <i>girl?</i>

507
00:23:04,598 --> 00:23:07,967
It was "the mikado,"
if I remember correctly.

508
00:23:08,034 --> 00:23:09,868
The female parts
were traditionally played

509
00:23:09,936 --> 00:23:11,471
by the girls
at miss Fielding's school,

510
00:23:11,538 --> 00:23:14,707
but when your father approached
the director and <i>begged...</i>

511
00:23:14,774 --> 00:23:17,876
Oh, it sounds like you
really applied yourself, pop.

512
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:22,847
I was a damn good yum-yum,
if I do say so myself.

513
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:55,523
Hi.
I didn't hear you come in.

514
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:59,227
How long have you been here?

515
00:23:59,295 --> 00:24:01,662
Long enough to know
that I'm in trouble.

516
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:04,532
Oh. You're falling
for the death monger.

517
00:24:06,168 --> 00:24:08,468
We spent the day together.

518
00:24:08,536 --> 00:24:11,105
It was... he was...

519
00:24:11,172 --> 00:24:12,406
Amazing.

520
00:24:12,473 --> 00:24:15,342
Would it really be
the worst thing in the world,

521
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:16,843
falling for the congressman?

522
00:24:16,912 --> 00:24:19,579
I mean, for goodness sakes,
he's not a criminal, Maggie.

523
00:24:19,647 --> 00:24:21,415
Oh, no.
No, that would be me.

524
00:24:21,482 --> 00:24:23,516
Maggie the arsonist.

525
00:24:27,521 --> 00:24:29,857
Hello? Hi, Mike.
What good news?

526
00:24:30,316 --> 00:24:33,584
No. No, you can't...
Stay there.

527
00:24:33,652 --> 00:24:36,187
Don't move.
I'll be right there.

528
00:24:36,254 --> 00:24:38,322
Maggie, what's the matter?

529
00:24:38,389 --> 00:24:40,824
Everything.

530
00:24:47,432 --> 00:24:49,065
You worked up an appetite?

531
00:24:49,133 --> 00:24:52,268
I got those, uh,
reservations at Balentine

532
00:24:52,337 --> 00:24:54,704
and then
your mysterious secret.

533
00:24:54,771 --> 00:24:56,706
Dean, I was thinking,

534
00:24:56,773 --> 00:24:58,641
maybe you should hear
what Bridget has to say.

535
00:24:58,709 --> 00:25:01,444
I... why... why
the hell would I do that?

536
00:25:01,511 --> 00:25:03,145
Well, because you...

537
00:25:03,213 --> 00:25:05,481
We can't move forward
until you put this behind you.

538
00:25:05,549 --> 00:25:08,283
I... it is behind me.

539
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:11,118
But now it's in front of you,
Dean, again.

540
00:25:11,186 --> 00:25:12,286
Colette.

541
00:25:12,355 --> 00:25:14,756
This is a conversation
you have to have.

542
00:25:15,309 --> 00:25:16,609
Better you do it now.

543
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:28,687
So how sick... were you?

544
00:25:28,755 --> 00:25:31,122
Y-y-you couldn't even call?

545
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:32,558
The prognosis wasn't good.

546
00:25:32,625 --> 00:25:34,693
I didn't want to saddle you
with an ailing bride.

547
00:25:34,761 --> 00:25:36,762
Oh, so... so you were
doing me a favor,

548
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:39,998
disappearing,
not telling me where you were?

549
00:25:40,066 --> 00:25:42,600
Now... you're better.

550
00:25:42,668 --> 00:25:44,003
It's good news.

551
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:56,823
Did you know that the screams
of 10,000 Beatles fans

552
00:25:56,891 --> 00:26:00,361
makes more noise than
a jet aircraft taking off?

553
00:26:00,429 --> 00:26:02,329
What all the fuss is,
I don't know.

554
00:26:02,397 --> 00:26:05,332
Rumor is they're staying
in the hotel,

555
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,767
and that's all it is...
A rumor.

556
00:26:06,834 --> 00:26:08,735
You give me Sinatra any day.

557
00:26:08,803 --> 00:26:09,836
Times are changing.

558
00:26:09,904 --> 00:26:12,605
Not for the better,
if you ask me.

559
00:26:12,673 --> 00:26:15,141
Not for the better at all.

560
00:26:19,066 --> 00:26:21,701
Well, congratulations
on your clean bill of health.

561
00:26:21,768 --> 00:26:23,403
Your husband must be thrilled.

562
00:26:23,471 --> 00:26:24,704
I'm not married.

563
00:26:24,771 --> 00:26:26,239
That was a lie...
An atrocious lie, Dean.

564
00:26:26,307 --> 00:26:27,772
What about the other men?

565
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,774
Are they all an atrocious lie?

566
00:26:29,842 --> 00:26:30,891
There were never any other men.

567
00:26:30,892 --> 00:26:32,244
No. No. There were
<i>always</i> other men...

568
00:26:32,312 --> 00:26:34,913
In bars, in elevators,
in hotel lobbies.

569
00:26:34,981 --> 00:26:36,382
- No, Dean...
- No, I saw that, Bridget.

570
00:26:36,449 --> 00:26:38,850
I saw the nods,
the glances, the smiles.

571
00:26:38,918 --> 00:26:40,819
- I just never let myself believe it.
- Dean, <i>no.</i>

572
00:26:40,887 --> 00:26:44,022
So you cheated on me,
you lied, you left,

573
00:26:44,089 --> 00:26:47,525
- and now I'm done.
- Dean, I never wanted to lie to you.

574
00:26:51,137 --> 00:26:52,871
The trick
to a successful lie is

575
00:26:52,939 --> 00:26:55,307
to believe that
you're telling the truth.

576
00:26:55,374 --> 00:26:57,042
If you know
that something is false,

577
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:59,944
how can you trick yourself
into believing it isn't?

578
00:27:00,012 --> 00:27:03,915
Simply make the false answer
another question's truth.

579
00:27:03,982 --> 00:27:05,850
Look, if I ask you,

580
00:27:05,918 --> 00:27:07,585
"did you shoot Mr. Bolger?"

581
00:27:07,652 --> 00:27:10,054
You simply fashion,
in your mind,

582
00:27:10,122 --> 00:27:14,158
a question which
the truthful answer is "no,"

583
00:27:14,226 --> 00:27:16,559
something like, uh...

584
00:27:16,627 --> 00:27:18,028
"Am I a secretary?"

585
00:27:18,096 --> 00:27:20,296
Then you simply speak
the answer... no.

586
00:27:20,364 --> 00:27:22,632
This is ridiculous.

587
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:25,501
It is <i>one lie,</i> Kate.

588
00:27:25,569 --> 00:27:28,338
It is one lie.

589
00:27:28,405 --> 00:27:30,006
You can tell the truth

590
00:27:30,074 --> 00:27:32,842
about everything else
that happened that night...

591
00:27:32,909 --> 00:27:35,010
How you were pulled
into the mission,

592
00:27:35,078 --> 00:27:37,279
how you ended up
at the jeweler's,

593
00:27:37,347 --> 00:27:38,513
the race to get there.

594
00:27:38,581 --> 00:27:40,382
You need only lie
about one thing,

595
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:43,252
and you're free and clear
of this forever.

596
00:27:43,319 --> 00:27:45,622
Okay, now... 
Relax.

597
00:27:45,945 --> 00:27:47,378
Let's try this again.

598
00:27:47,446 --> 00:27:48,947
Shall we?

599
00:27:50,349 --> 00:27:52,784
On Saturday last,

600
00:27:52,852 --> 00:27:54,953
were you engaged
by your superior...

601
00:27:56,522 --> 00:27:58,657
Block it out, Kate.

602
00:27:58,725 --> 00:28:00,458
Shut it down.

603
00:28:00,526 --> 00:28:02,359
If you need to make peace
with what you've done,

604
00:28:02,427 --> 00:28:03,861
now is not the time.

605
00:28:03,929 --> 00:28:06,664
I don't want to shut it down.
I have been trying to forget...

606
00:28:06,732 --> 00:28:09,834
Pretending like
it didn't happen,

607
00:28:09,901 --> 00:28:11,736
like it was a bad dream,

608
00:28:11,803 --> 00:28:14,038
but it doesn't matter.

609
00:28:14,106 --> 00:28:16,673
I killed a man, Anderson.

610
00:28:18,242 --> 00:28:20,309
Okay.

611
00:28:32,229 --> 00:28:34,629
I've never seen pop
at a loss for words.

612
00:28:34,716 --> 00:28:37,118
Well, I grew up with boys
in the family.

613
00:28:37,186 --> 00:28:40,354
I couldn't beat them up,
so I learned to compensate.

614
00:28:40,422 --> 00:28:42,189
With charm, wit,

615
00:28:42,257 --> 00:28:44,058
and a razor-sharp sense

616
00:28:44,125 --> 00:28:47,127
o-of how to bring a grown man
to his knees.

617
00:28:47,195 --> 00:28:50,030
Oh, and which grown man
are we referring to now?

618
00:28:59,461 --> 00:29:00,961
Good night.

619
00:29:01,029 --> 00:29:04,899
You're not begging
to come upstairs?

620
00:29:06,367 --> 00:29:09,102
Let's just say some things
are worth waiting for.

621
00:29:26,463 --> 00:29:29,298
What happened to
"it's not so well written"?

622
00:29:29,366 --> 00:29:31,467
Well, we were short a column
at deadline,

623
00:29:31,535 --> 00:29:33,903
so I goosed yours and sent it
off to the presses.

624
00:29:33,971 --> 00:29:36,072
But I... there weren't
enough facts.

625
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:38,675
It's a... it's a baseball bat.

626
00:29:38,743 --> 00:29:40,543
You said it wasn't ready yet.

627
00:29:40,611 --> 00:29:43,112
It wasn't, but you can't run
blank space in a newspaper.

628
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:46,249
You <i>have</i> to stop this, Mike.

629
00:29:46,316 --> 00:29:48,017
Don't worry.
I did some quick research

630
00:29:48,084 --> 00:29:49,452
and I rounded it out a bit.

631
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,454
You know, we're not gonna
win over the opposition,

632
00:29:51,522 --> 00:29:53,623
but at least every
liberal reader in Manhattan

633
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:55,424
is gonna know what a jackass
Rawlings is.

634
00:29:55,492 --> 00:29:57,626
Congratulations, Mags.

635
00:29:57,693 --> 00:29:59,494
You're gonna be published.

636
00:30:12,598 --> 00:30:15,199
Looked like you could use
the company.

637
00:30:15,267 --> 00:30:17,235
I'm guessing we both could.

638
00:30:17,302 --> 00:30:20,738
How did you handle it, Bridget?

639
00:30:20,805 --> 00:30:23,274
The lying? The deception?

640
00:30:23,342 --> 00:30:25,610
It was hard at first...

641
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:30,292
But I got caught up
in the rush of it,

642
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,461
convinced myself it was
for a good cause,

643
00:30:32,529 --> 00:30:34,463
and...

644
00:30:34,531 --> 00:30:36,032
For a while, that worked.

645
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,601
Have you ever had
to take a polygraph?

646
00:30:38,668 --> 00:30:40,903
A lie detector? No.

647
00:30:44,207 --> 00:30:47,075
Have you ever...
Done something...

648
00:30:47,143 --> 00:30:48,844
In this job that's haunted you?

649
00:30:48,911 --> 00:30:50,378
Yes,

650
00:30:50,446 --> 00:30:52,614
and it still does.

651
00:30:52,681 --> 00:30:56,384
What's wrong, Kate?

652
00:30:56,452 --> 00:30:58,386
I'm sorry.

653
00:30:58,454 --> 00:31:01,021
I should not have asked.

654
00:31:01,089 --> 00:31:05,092
I suppose this is what it's like
being on the outside.

655
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,094
Everything I thought
I understood about this world

656
00:31:07,162 --> 00:31:09,596
is...

657
00:31:09,664 --> 00:31:11,999
It's been turned upside down.

658
00:31:13,483 --> 00:31:16,584
If I don't pass this
polygraph, I lose everything.

659
00:31:16,652 --> 00:31:19,220
Whatever's happened,

660
00:31:19,288 --> 00:31:21,389
it's in the past.

661
00:31:21,456 --> 00:31:24,325
One thing I've learned
about this nasty business

662
00:31:24,393 --> 00:31:27,561
is whatever it takes
to save yourself...

663
00:31:27,629 --> 00:31:29,397
You do it.

664
00:31:36,337 --> 00:31:40,740
I know that this is
none of my business...

665
00:31:40,809 --> 00:31:42,976
But you've been gone
a long time.

666
00:31:43,044 --> 00:31:47,013
If Dean has started over,
maybe you should, too.

667
00:32:17,002 --> 00:32:18,702
So I guess we're not going
to make

668
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,571
that dinner reservation
after all.

669
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:22,806
Sorry.

670
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:27,744
I needed to walk,
you know, clear my head.

671
00:32:27,812 --> 00:32:30,346
You're confused,
as you should be.

672
00:32:30,414 --> 00:32:31,782
I'm not confused.

673
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:34,383
I know exactly what I want...

674
00:32:34,451 --> 00:32:35,918
You.

675
00:32:36,339 --> 00:32:38,440
You can't force this decision,
Dean.

676
00:32:38,508 --> 00:32:39,809
There is no decision.

677
00:32:39,877 --> 00:32:42,344
Of course there is.

678
00:32:43,681 --> 00:32:45,815
So you're the one that told me
to talk to her,

679
00:32:45,883 --> 00:32:47,884
and now you're gonna hold that
against me?

680
00:32:47,951 --> 00:32:49,751
No, I'm not holding anything
against you.

681
00:32:49,819 --> 00:32:53,121
I've been trying to tell myself
nothing has changed.

682
00:32:53,189 --> 00:32:55,390
Hey, look at me.

683
00:32:56,859 --> 00:32:59,394
What has really changed
since yesterday?

684
00:32:59,461 --> 00:33:02,564
Huh?

685
00:33:02,631 --> 00:33:06,500
I mean, I'm still
not half as handsome as...

686
00:33:06,568 --> 00:33:08,035
Is it Bedford?

687
00:33:08,103 --> 00:33:10,637
It's Redford.

688
00:33:10,706 --> 00:33:13,674
Not half as popular
as the Beatles.

689
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:18,041
You were in love with her,
Dean.

690
00:33:18,108 --> 00:33:20,342
She broke your heart.

691
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:23,678
Now she's back. I can't be
in the middle of that.

692
00:33:28,184 --> 00:33:29,651
Colette...

693
00:33:29,718 --> 00:33:33,388
Please don't make this
any harder.

694
00:33:33,456 --> 00:33:35,524
Just go.

695
00:33:58,812 --> 00:34:02,515
Once you were upstairs,

696
00:34:02,583 --> 00:34:04,584
did you see Mr. Anderson
engaged in a fight

697
00:34:04,651 --> 00:34:07,320
with Mr. Cyrus Bolger?

698
00:34:07,607 --> 00:34:08,808
Yes.

699
00:34:08,876 --> 00:34:12,078
Did Mr. Anderson see you?

700
00:34:13,413 --> 00:34:15,748
I don't... I don't think so.

701
00:34:17,617 --> 00:34:18,918
No.

702
00:34:18,986 --> 00:34:21,654
Did Mr. Bolger see you?

703
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:26,791
No.

704
00:34:32,365 --> 00:34:35,133
Very good, miss Cameron.

705
00:34:35,201 --> 00:34:37,970
Now...

706
00:34:38,037 --> 00:34:43,474
Miss Cameron, did Mr. Anderson
shoot Mr. Bolger?

707
00:34:43,541 --> 00:34:48,645
Answer the question,
miss Cameron.

708
00:35:01,426 --> 00:35:03,527
I thought you'd be gone.

709
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:07,164
By "thought," I mean hoped.

710
00:35:07,232 --> 00:35:11,301
You were right earlier.

711
00:35:11,369 --> 00:35:13,169
I was lying.

712
00:35:14,405 --> 00:35:15,939
Gold star for me.

713
00:35:16,007 --> 00:35:18,574
But I never cheated on you.

714
00:35:18,642 --> 00:35:21,411
There were never any other men.

715
00:35:21,478 --> 00:35:23,746
I was not married.

716
00:35:23,814 --> 00:35:26,882
All I ever wanted was to be
your wife, Dean. I love you.

717
00:35:28,851 --> 00:35:32,221
But I <i>had</i> to leave.

718
00:35:32,289 --> 00:35:35,557
Okay, so you give me
one good reason

719
00:35:35,625 --> 00:35:38,394
why you would have to disappear
without a call,

720
00:35:38,461 --> 00:35:40,396
without a trace, a note,

721
00:35:40,463 --> 00:35:41,930
anything.

722
00:35:41,997 --> 00:35:44,399
It was life or death...

723
00:35:44,466 --> 00:35:47,735
My life and the lives
of others around me.

724
00:35:47,803 --> 00:35:49,203
I was in real danger.

725
00:35:49,271 --> 00:35:52,473
Why the hell would anyone
want to hurt you, Bridget?

726
00:35:58,446 --> 00:36:01,315
Because I worked
for British Intelligence.

727
00:36:01,382 --> 00:36:03,216
MI6.

728
00:36:06,454 --> 00:36:08,322
I was a spy, Dean.

729
00:36:10,191 --> 00:36:12,293
I was a spy.

730
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:15,609
Dean, you've got to believe me.

731
00:36:17,703 --> 00:36:18,837
Those other men...

732
00:36:18,904 --> 00:36:20,438
They were contacts.
They were not lovers.

733
00:36:20,506 --> 00:36:21,840
- I don't want to hear this.
- Dean.

734
00:36:21,907 --> 00:36:24,542
They told me I had to disappear.
I had no choice.

735
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:27,412
I wanted to tell you everything,
but I couldn't.

736
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,913
It was for your own safety
and mine.

737
00:36:28,981 --> 00:36:31,716
Wh-what do you want me to do
with this information, Bridget?

738
00:36:31,784 --> 00:36:33,350
Say, "gee, thanks
for the explanation.

739
00:36:33,418 --> 00:36:34,585
Let's get married now"?

740
00:36:34,652 --> 00:36:36,687
The whole relationship
has been a series of lies,

741
00:36:36,755 --> 00:36:38,321
and whether you... whether
you lied for your country

742
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:40,657
or for the hell of it,
it makes no difference to me.

743
00:36:40,725 --> 00:36:41,925
I've moved on.

744
00:36:41,993 --> 00:36:45,529
Dean, one thing
I never lied about was you.

745
00:36:45,597 --> 00:36:47,564
I've always loved you.

746
00:36:47,632 --> 00:36:49,899
- I love you still.
- No, it's... it's too late for that now.

747
00:36:49,966 --> 00:36:51,501
Dean, look at me.

748
00:36:51,568 --> 00:36:54,136
Look at me and tell me you still
don't have feelings for me.

749
00:36:54,204 --> 00:36:56,972
Tell me that you don't love me.

750
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,875
If you can do that,

751
00:36:58,942 --> 00:37:02,745
I'll walk down that corridor
and I'll disappear.

752
00:37:31,055 --> 00:37:32,055
- Ted.
- Hey.

753
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:33,657
What are you doing here?

754
00:37:33,725 --> 00:37:34,757
Hope you don't mind me
dropping by.

755
00:37:34,825 --> 00:37:36,493
Actually, I was just leaving.

756
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,495
Oh.
Headed to your boyfriend's?

757
00:37:38,562 --> 00:37:42,332
Maggie is expecting...
Company.

758
00:37:42,399 --> 00:37:44,967
Kate's in London,
so I'm staying at her house.

759
00:37:45,035 --> 00:37:46,702
I don't have a boyfriend.

760
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:48,704
I thought because you said, uh,

761
00:37:48,772 --> 00:37:51,607
you know, you lost
your, uh, the lockbox.

762
00:37:51,675 --> 00:37:52,842
Good night, Ted.

763
00:37:52,909 --> 00:37:54,176
Wait. Forget that.

764
00:37:54,244 --> 00:37:57,379
I-I, uh,
I have something for you.

765
00:37:57,447 --> 00:37:59,448
Ted.

766
00:37:59,516 --> 00:38:01,017
It's the real deal,

767
00:38:01,084 --> 00:38:03,152
all the bells and whistles
and everything.

768
00:38:03,219 --> 00:38:04,386
Oh.

769
00:38:07,256 --> 00:38:10,025
It's... beautiful.

770
00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:12,556
And expensive.

771
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:13,790
Why?

772
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:15,659
Because you talked
a lot of sense into me.

773
00:38:15,727 --> 00:38:17,294
You bought me
a professional camera

774
00:38:17,362 --> 00:38:18,996
because I talked
a lot of sense?

775
00:38:19,064 --> 00:38:21,532
And because you're
an excellent photographer...

776
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:22,765
Probably.

777
00:38:24,301 --> 00:38:25,835
You're
a real talent, Laura,

778
00:38:25,903 --> 00:38:27,803
and it'd be a shame
for the world not to see that.

779
00:38:27,871 --> 00:38:29,472
But that's not all?

780
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,774
No. Um, I need to ask you
a favor. I need your help...

781
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:35,778
Shopping for an engagement ring.

782
00:38:35,846 --> 00:38:37,747
I'm gonna ask Amanda
to marry me.

783
00:38:37,814 --> 00:38:39,014
Oh.

784
00:38:39,082 --> 00:38:40,582
Yeah.

785
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:42,751
Come on. I'll call you a cab.
I'll tell you all about it.

786
00:38:42,818 --> 00:38:44,019
Okay.

787
00:38:53,501 --> 00:38:56,569
I don't agree
with any of your ideas.

788
00:38:56,637 --> 00:38:58,004
I'm never going to.

789
00:38:58,072 --> 00:39:00,439
Whoa. Is that why
you summoned me down here?

790
00:39:00,507 --> 00:39:02,475
To tell me
you disagree with me?

791
00:39:02,542 --> 00:39:04,177
I thought we covered
that territory.

792
00:39:06,213 --> 00:39:09,015
No. I, uh,
I have to talk to you.

793
00:39:11,249 --> 00:39:12,917
Haven't you done enough
talking for one day?

794
00:39:15,287 --> 00:39:17,221
Chris, I need to tell you...

795
00:39:17,289 --> 00:39:19,957
Can it wait?

796
00:39:20,025 --> 00:39:22,593
Till the morning?

797
00:39:22,661 --> 00:39:24,395
Mm.

798
00:39:30,067 --> 00:39:31,868
It can wait till morning.

799
00:39:31,936 --> 00:39:33,102
Good.

800
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:40,877
Kate.

801
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:43,278
Kate, you did well.

802
00:39:44,239 --> 00:39:46,140
I did what you told me.

803
00:39:46,208 --> 00:39:50,678
Did you ask yourself
an internal question?

804
00:39:50,746 --> 00:39:52,213
Yes.

805
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:55,016
"Will I ever forgive myself?"

806
00:39:55,083 --> 00:39:57,551
No.

807
00:39:57,619 --> 00:39:59,019
Good-bye, Anderson.

808
00:39:59,086 --> 00:40:01,855
You saved my life, Kate.

809
00:40:03,725 --> 00:40:06,493
You saved the lives
of every agent on that list.

810
00:40:06,561 --> 00:40:08,361
And now you've passed
the polygraph

811
00:40:08,429 --> 00:40:12,865
under conditions which would've
made most good agents crumble.

812
00:40:12,933 --> 00:40:14,734
Despite your protestations...

813
00:40:16,469 --> 00:40:18,838
You're very good at this.

814
00:40:22,342 --> 00:40:25,210
You're free to go, as promised.

815
00:40:32,955 --> 00:40:34,422
Anderson, wait.

816
00:40:36,825 --> 00:40:38,092
Wait.
