1
00:00:00,584 --> 00:00:01,851
<i>Previously on "Pan Am"...</i>

2
00:00:01,918 --> 00:00:04,819
Let's keep it in New York,
Ginny. Monte Carlo was a lark.

3
00:00:05,046 --> 00:00:07,013
She does have a way
about her.

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,147
I love her.

5
00:00:08,215 --> 00:00:09,949
I've fallen in love.

6
00:00:10,017 --> 00:00:11,518
What if I could tell you
something about someone

7
00:00:11,585 --> 00:00:12,619
you're very close to?

8
00:00:14,221 --> 00:00:15,354
Don't pose.

9
00:00:15,423 --> 00:00:17,657
I don't suppose I could...
make it up to you?

10
00:00:17,725 --> 00:00:19,158
Could make you a list.

11
00:00:19,226 --> 00:00:20,192
I'll get you a pen.

12
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:21,827
My mind is full of you.

13
00:00:21,895 --> 00:00:23,796
Are you in danger?

14
00:00:23,863 --> 00:00:26,364
Tito has put an entire nation
in danger.

15
00:00:26,433 --> 00:00:27,633
You want me to spy for you?

16
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,168
For us.
Welcome to the big leagues.

17
00:00:33,907 --> 00:00:35,340
I think I'm in love.

18
00:00:35,408 --> 00:00:37,975
And you, <i>beaute?</i>

19
00:00:38,043 --> 00:00:41,579
Yes. They're beautiful.

20
00:00:56,761 --> 00:00:57,694
They're so...

21
00:00:57,762 --> 00:00:59,262
I was going for heavenly.

22
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:02,332
A "female as
the visible manifestation

23
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,335
of the deity's presence
on Earth "kind of thing".

24
00:01:05,402 --> 00:01:09,339
Graham, these portraits
are remarkable.

25
00:01:09,406 --> 00:01:11,574
And you're an artist.

26
00:01:11,641 --> 00:01:12,575
A true artist.

27
00:01:12,642 --> 00:01:14,610
You've been holding out
on me.

28
00:01:14,678 --> 00:01:15,611
Excuse me?

29
00:01:15,679 --> 00:01:17,347
You never mentioned
you had an interest.

30
00:01:17,414 --> 00:01:20,450
In photographers?
I mean... in photography?

31
00:01:20,517 --> 00:01:23,052
I'm just a beginner. I...

32
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,820
Me and my instamatic.

33
00:01:24,888 --> 00:01:27,755
But these... these are...

34
00:01:27,823 --> 00:01:30,525
Inspiring.

35
00:01:30,593 --> 00:01:33,362
I thought shooting girls
serving appetizers on a plane

36
00:01:33,429 --> 00:01:34,363
was your specialty.

37
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:36,131
Well, appetizers
are in back.

38
00:01:36,199 --> 00:01:37,299
Well, now I see the problem...

39
00:01:37,367 --> 00:01:39,701
Laura was wearing
far too many clothes.

40
00:01:39,768 --> 00:01:42,170
- Maggie!
- I suffered through it.

41
00:01:42,238 --> 00:01:45,740
Well, it's a great show, Graham.
Thanks for inviting us.

42
00:01:45,808 --> 00:01:46,875
Thanks for coming.

43
00:01:46,942 --> 00:01:49,243
Laura, um,
can you take a cab home?

44
00:01:49,311 --> 00:01:50,512
Yes, sure.

45
00:01:52,848 --> 00:01:55,316
The girls that do this...

46
00:01:55,384 --> 00:01:56,684
Who are they?

47
00:01:56,752 --> 00:01:58,352
Friends, models,

48
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:01,287
and, uh, they're not girls.
They're... women.

49
00:02:01,355 --> 00:02:03,657
Right.

50
00:02:03,725 --> 00:02:05,091
They're not embarrassed?

51
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:07,895
No, they're liberated.

52
00:02:07,962 --> 00:02:10,063
But you can't see
their faces.

53
00:02:10,131 --> 00:02:12,900
Anonymous can be liberating.

54
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:16,936
For them, it's an experience
of self-expression.

55
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:26,846
I never thought I'd wish
I wasn't going to Rome.

56
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:31,482
This is all your fault.

57
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:34,218
Rome? Not so special.

58
00:02:34,286 --> 00:02:36,855
Pantheon? Colosseum? Vatican?

59
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:39,424
That's no big deal?

60
00:02:39,491 --> 00:02:41,026
Well, you haven't seen
my country.

61
00:02:41,093 --> 00:02:43,962
Croatia is better
than all of Europe combined.

62
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,764
I'm really sad for them.

63
00:02:46,372 --> 00:02:48,532
You know? I-I pity their shame.

64
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,100
I think you're jealous.

65
00:02:50,168 --> 00:02:51,602
Of Italy? Ha!

66
00:02:53,371 --> 00:02:57,340
Or maybe you're just full of
nationalistic pride like us yanks.

67
00:02:57,408 --> 00:03:00,110
Well, yes and no.

68
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:05,548
Niko, I've been afraid to ask,
but I've wanted to...

69
00:03:07,818 --> 00:03:13,522
Have you ever thought about
the desirability of living here?

70
00:03:13,591 --> 00:03:15,291
You're trying to tempt me?

71
00:03:15,358 --> 00:03:17,894
No.

72
00:03:17,962 --> 00:03:19,094
Yes.

73
00:03:19,161 --> 00:03:23,031
We have freedom here, and...

74
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:24,666
We have decency.

75
00:03:24,734 --> 00:03:26,401
Decency?

76
00:03:26,469 --> 00:03:27,936
Desirability?

77
00:03:29,305 --> 00:03:31,640
Sounds like you're
describing yourself.

78
00:03:33,342 --> 00:03:35,110
If you're going to Rome,

79
00:03:35,177 --> 00:03:37,078
you should practice
your Italian.

80
00:03:37,146 --> 00:03:40,281
I'll test you.
Translate this...

81
00:03:40,349 --> 00:03:45,520
<i>"La Croazia e molto piu bella</i>
<i>di Italia"...</i>

82
00:03:45,588 --> 00:03:48,756
"Croatia is much more beautiful
than Italy..."

83
00:03:48,824 --> 00:03:51,891
<i>"E tu sei piu bella..."</i>

84
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:54,528
"And you are
more beautiful..."

85
00:03:54,596 --> 00:03:58,132
<i>"Di qualsiasi altra Donna</i>
<i>in qualsiasi posto."</i>

86
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:02,836
"Than any woman anywhere."

87
00:04:11,311 --> 00:04:13,146
I don't believe this.

88
00:04:13,213 --> 00:04:15,581
This... what you're doing...
It makes no sense!

89
00:04:15,649 --> 00:04:17,183
Ginny, calm down.

90
00:04:17,251 --> 00:04:18,184
That's rich!

91
00:04:18,252 --> 00:04:19,485
You break up with me,

92
00:04:19,553 --> 00:04:21,820
and when I react with
understandable astonishment,

93
00:04:21,888 --> 00:04:23,355
you tell me to "calm down"?

94
00:04:23,422 --> 00:04:25,190
I thought we'd... we'd have to be
a couple to break up.

95
00:04:25,258 --> 00:04:27,392
So what?
I was just a good time?

96
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,893
Is that what
you're telling me?

97
00:04:28,961 --> 00:04:31,296
Yes, Ginny,
that's what we were having,

98
00:04:31,364 --> 00:04:32,664
a good time.

99
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:36,601
And I'm pretty sure
I was a piece on the side.

100
00:04:36,669 --> 00:04:38,370
Are you missing something?

101
00:04:38,437 --> 00:04:41,038
Was I unclear when I said
"I love you"?

102
00:04:43,107 --> 00:04:44,041
I'm sorry.

103
00:04:44,108 --> 00:04:45,609
Perfect.

104
00:04:45,677 --> 00:04:47,645
How perfect!
I tell you that I love you,

105
00:04:47,712 --> 00:04:49,380
- and you tell me you're sorry.
- I-I am.

106
00:04:49,447 --> 00:04:50,648
You're sorry, all right.

107
00:04:50,715 --> 00:04:53,184
You are a sorry, sorry man!

108
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:54,751
Would you keep
your voice down?

109
00:04:54,819 --> 00:04:58,120
Aren't you and Everett
just two peas in a pathetic pod?

110
00:04:58,189 --> 00:05:00,223
"Yes, no, come, go."

111
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:01,957
Everett should have
known better.

112
00:05:02,025 --> 00:05:02,958
About what?

113
00:05:03,026 --> 00:05:04,394
Don't be dense.

114
00:05:04,461 --> 00:05:08,097
I brought champagne
and I said the words,

115
00:05:08,165 --> 00:05:11,133
"I'm all yours."

116
00:05:11,201 --> 00:05:13,202
You left him?

117
00:05:13,269 --> 00:05:17,172
He had his chance,
and he blew it.

118
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,641
I thought we had
a future together, Dean.

119
00:05:19,709 --> 00:05:22,344
I thought
this was what you wanted.

120
00:05:22,412 --> 00:05:25,714
You didn't
leave him for me.

121
00:05:25,781 --> 00:05:27,448
And I never made you
any promises.

122
00:05:27,516 --> 00:05:29,817
That's right. You just
strung me along, didn't you?

123
00:05:29,884 --> 00:05:31,619
You did a fine job
stringing yourself along

124
00:05:31,687 --> 00:05:33,454
without any help from me.

125
00:05:35,691 --> 00:05:38,359
What are you, crazy?

126
00:05:40,329 --> 00:05:43,330
Pan Am
S01 Ep 13 - Romance languages

127
00:05:43,397 --> 00:05:47,267
Sync and corrected by dr.jackson
for www.addic7ed.com

128
00:05:49,337 --> 00:05:51,471
And I can't find a replacement.

129
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:53,540
The boy can't fly
unaccompanied.

130
00:05:53,608 --> 00:05:55,808
I liked this job.

131
00:05:55,876 --> 00:05:57,444
I'm on the Rome flight.

132
00:05:57,511 --> 00:05:59,045
Why don't I escort him?

133
00:05:59,113 --> 00:06:00,312
Is that allowed?

134
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:03,815
It is now.
I was hoping you'd say that.

135
00:06:03,883 --> 00:06:05,284
I know.

136
00:06:05,352 --> 00:06:07,018
I'm sure
my fellow stewardesses

137
00:06:07,086 --> 00:06:08,920
would appreciate
separate hotel rooms.

138
00:06:08,988 --> 00:06:12,491
It would make a nice change.
Let me see what I can do.

139
00:06:12,559 --> 00:06:14,360
I was hoping you'd say that.

140
00:06:17,028 --> 00:06:17,895
Morning.

141
00:06:17,963 --> 00:06:19,897
- <i>Bonjour.</i>
- Thank you.

142
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,034
Have you seen
the flight manifest yet?

143
00:06:24,102 --> 00:06:26,404
She isn't on it.
Neither is he.

144
00:06:26,472 --> 00:06:28,573
We do have
a plane full of clergy

145
00:06:28,641 --> 00:06:30,174
for the second
Vatican council.

146
00:06:30,242 --> 00:06:34,210
Chances are good
the flight is serene.

147
00:06:36,914 --> 00:06:39,716
Are you two married?

148
00:06:39,784 --> 00:06:41,585
No.

149
00:06:41,653 --> 00:06:43,687
We're not married, no.

150
00:06:43,755 --> 00:06:45,021
Because I'm available.

151
00:06:45,089 --> 00:06:46,490
You must be Charlie.

152
00:06:46,557 --> 00:06:49,825
<i>Oui. Bonjour,</i>
<i>je m'appelle</i> Charlie.

153
00:06:49,893 --> 00:06:51,960
<i>Bonjour,</i> Charlie.
<i>Je m'appelle</i> Colette,

154
00:06:52,028 --> 00:06:53,329
<i>et voici notre capitaine.</i>

155
00:06:53,397 --> 00:06:54,563
How are you, Charlie?

156
00:06:54,631 --> 00:06:56,832
Morning, captain.
Pleasure to meet you.

157
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,134
Careful there, sport. I gotta
fly the plane in a few minutes.

158
00:06:59,202 --> 00:07:01,671
Sorry, sir. I'll take it easy
on you next time.

159
00:07:01,738 --> 00:07:03,338
Right this way, <i>monsieur.</i>

160
00:07:03,406 --> 00:07:05,540
Please, allow me.

161
00:07:05,608 --> 00:07:08,109
What a gentleman.

162
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:10,545
<i>Merci.</i>

163
00:07:12,047 --> 00:07:14,248
Hold it right there!

164
00:07:16,129 --> 00:07:17,949
You got my watch?

165
00:07:30,678 --> 00:07:32,078
May I help you with something?

166
00:07:39,118 --> 00:07:41,821
I will be right back.

167
00:07:41,888 --> 00:07:43,756
Why me?

168
00:07:43,824 --> 00:07:45,290
"Why you" what?

169
00:07:45,358 --> 00:07:47,626
Why do I always get stuck
with the honeymooners?

170
00:07:47,694 --> 00:07:50,563
The future honeymooners?
The pretend honeymooners?

171
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,364
Do you need me
to take care of something?

172
00:07:52,432 --> 00:07:54,332
No! I don't!

173
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:55,800
Laura, what's wrong?

174
00:07:55,868 --> 00:07:57,335
Sex.

175
00:07:57,402 --> 00:07:58,536
Did you see them?

176
00:07:58,604 --> 00:07:59,504
What?

177
00:07:59,572 --> 00:08:00,738
The couple in row 9.

178
00:08:00,806 --> 00:08:03,007
They're almost having sex
in their seats.

179
00:08:03,075 --> 00:08:04,742
Right next to a nun.

180
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:06,811
They're still at it.

181
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,213
They're getting
kind of acrobatic.

182
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:11,915
Well,
at least they'll be able

183
00:08:11,983 --> 00:08:13,750
to confess their sins
immediately.

184
00:08:13,818 --> 00:08:14,751
Sin? Where?

185
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:20,624
How did... they should have spent
their airfare on a hotel.

186
00:08:20,692 --> 00:08:22,726
They're so passionate.

187
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:24,728
I'm envious.

188
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:25,795
- I...
- No.

189
00:08:35,171 --> 00:08:37,807
I want details.
I can't wait anymore.

190
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,074
Do you feel different?

191
00:08:39,142 --> 00:08:41,410
Maggie, it's... private.

192
00:08:41,478 --> 00:08:43,879
That's what girlfriends
are for.

193
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,153
<i>Grazie mille.</i>

194
00:08:52,221 --> 00:08:54,823
A pickpocket
and a linguist.

195
00:08:54,891 --> 00:08:56,992
You speak Italian also?

196
00:08:57,059 --> 00:08:59,593
Well, I'm not fluent yet,
but I'd like to be.

197
00:08:59,661 --> 00:09:01,729
I'm partial
to the romance languages.

198
00:09:01,796 --> 00:09:03,163
As am I.

199
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:06,133
They are... poetic, no?

200
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,235
Yes. And they make sense.

201
00:09:08,302 --> 00:09:10,004
Unlike English.

202
00:09:10,071 --> 00:09:12,573
I don't get it.
Why isn't it dead like Latin?

203
00:09:12,641 --> 00:09:14,073
It's a mystery.

204
00:09:15,643 --> 00:09:17,510
How did you do this?

205
00:09:17,578 --> 00:09:20,146
It's a mystery.

206
00:09:20,213 --> 00:09:23,750
I like close-up magic.
It's fun.

207
00:09:23,817 --> 00:09:25,351
Something to do
when I'm on my own,

208
00:09:25,419 --> 00:09:27,186
which is a lot.

209
00:09:27,254 --> 00:09:28,988
I'm sorry to hear that.

210
00:09:29,056 --> 00:09:30,188
Then again,

211
00:09:30,256 --> 00:09:33,124
"transcontinental divorce"
has a nice ring to it.

212
00:09:33,192 --> 00:09:35,160
I'm sorry to hear that,
too.

213
00:09:41,568 --> 00:09:43,501
Give it back.

214
00:09:51,176 --> 00:09:53,010
Keep an eye on this one.

215
00:09:53,078 --> 00:09:55,880
He's a scamp.

216
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:00,084
Excuse me!

217
00:10:00,151 --> 00:10:03,286
Sister Mary Agnes really needs
to use the lavatory.

218
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:05,421
How long has it been?

219
00:10:05,489 --> 00:10:06,422
17 minutes.

220
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:08,024
There have been...

221
00:10:08,092 --> 00:10:09,893
Noises.

222
00:10:09,961 --> 00:10:11,127
Dear.

223
00:10:13,097 --> 00:10:14,397
I'm sorry.
Could you please...

224
00:10:14,465 --> 00:10:15,765
Finish up?

225
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:17,366
Is this beyond
your station, child?

226
00:10:17,434 --> 00:10:19,602
Would you like me
to speak to the pilot?

227
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:29,645
I'll say one thing for her...
She's got a pretty good arm.

228
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:31,814
I got one word
for you... jujubes.

229
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,881
No, I know where
you're headed. Skip it.

230
00:10:33,949 --> 00:10:35,926
I'm not headed anywhere.
I've said all I need to say.

231
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:36,951
No, you're dying to say it.

232
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:38,620
That I told you so?
I would never say that.

233
00:10:38,687 --> 00:10:41,656
You got nothing
to be ashamed of.

234
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,157
You went
a respectable distance,

235
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:45,093
considering the mink
was off-the-charts crazy.

236
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,128
Why are the crazy girls
always the most fun?

237
00:10:47,195 --> 00:10:48,863
Let's get
something straight.

238
00:10:48,931 --> 00:10:50,163
They are all crazy.

239
00:10:50,231 --> 00:10:53,900
All you can do is choose
a degree on the crazy-o-meter.

240
00:10:53,968 --> 00:10:55,836
I need some turbulence.

241
00:10:55,903 --> 00:10:57,504
Why?

242
00:10:58,806 --> 00:11:00,206
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

243
00:11:00,274 --> 00:11:03,010
<i>we are experiencing turbulence.</i>
<i>Please take your seats.</i>

244
00:11:03,077 --> 00:11:05,911
- What's wrong with you?
- I'm worried.

245
00:11:05,979 --> 00:11:07,046
Everything.

246
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:16,155
I...

247
00:11:16,222 --> 00:11:19,591
I spent some time
with a man...

248
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,193
Last night.

249
00:11:21,261 --> 00:11:25,229
What exactly are you saying?

250
00:11:25,297 --> 00:11:26,698
Does that mean
what I think it means?

251
00:11:37,576 --> 00:11:41,745
Laura, did you lose
your virginity?

252
00:11:50,889 --> 00:11:53,290
Expensive piece
of equipment.

253
00:11:53,357 --> 00:11:56,092
That happens to be
an essential tool of the trade.

254
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,127
That's how you get
the film off the spool

255
00:11:58,195 --> 00:12:00,730
in total darkness.

256
00:12:00,798 --> 00:12:04,167
So you just
feel your way around?

257
00:12:04,234 --> 00:12:06,468
Gotta know right
where everything goes.

258
00:12:07,871 --> 00:12:10,706
That's the "soup."
Not edible.

259
00:12:10,773 --> 00:12:14,542
Stop bath, fixer,
rinse bath,

260
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:16,377
we have to be very gentle.

261
00:12:16,445 --> 00:12:19,514
Coax the paper
with a delicate touch.

262
00:12:19,582 --> 00:12:23,318
Timing is... everything.

263
00:12:23,385 --> 00:12:27,722
The temperature
has to be... ideal.

264
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:36,430
I'd,

265
00:12:36,497 --> 00:12:38,498
I'd like to try it someday.

266
00:12:38,566 --> 00:12:39,499
Developing.

267
00:12:39,567 --> 00:12:41,702
You should. I insist.

268
00:12:41,769 --> 00:12:44,270
Bring your film back from Rome.
We'll develop it together.

269
00:12:44,338 --> 00:12:45,471
Really?

270
00:12:45,539 --> 00:12:48,174
There's a statue
you shouldn't miss.

271
00:12:48,242 --> 00:12:49,776
Two lovers.

272
00:12:49,844 --> 00:12:52,812
Intimate, yet visceral.

273
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,182
A romance and passion
alive in stone.

274
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,217
It'll change your life.

275
00:13:10,016 --> 00:13:11,884
<i>Non se l'aspettava stasera.</i>

276
00:13:11,951 --> 00:13:14,820
He's only authorized
to be released to his mother,

277
00:13:14,888 --> 00:13:16,788
not the housekeeper.

278
00:13:16,855 --> 00:13:19,957
His mother is away overnight.

279
00:13:20,025 --> 00:13:23,061
So tell her
that the boy knows her.

280
00:13:23,128 --> 00:13:26,363
<i>Allora... lui la conosce,</i>
<i>va bene?</i>

281
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,266
She isn't coming, is she?

282
00:13:29,334 --> 00:13:30,968
Your mother is not coming,
no.

283
00:13:31,036 --> 00:13:33,269
But hopefully, they'll release
you to your housekeeper.

284
00:13:33,337 --> 00:13:34,938
Parent trap again.

285
00:13:35,006 --> 00:13:37,207
Dad put me
on an earlier flight.

286
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:38,875
He probably didn't remember
to tell my mom

287
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,610
I was coming in so soon.

288
00:13:40,678 --> 00:13:41,878
It's not the first time.

289
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:45,648
They don't talk much
since they got divorced.

290
00:13:45,717 --> 00:13:48,118
You don't have to wait.
I'll be fine.

291
00:13:48,186 --> 00:13:49,985
I didn't get
to pick a card.

292
00:13:50,053 --> 00:13:53,256
Looks like trouble to me.

293
00:13:53,324 --> 00:13:55,692
<i>Alzarzi. Possiamo andare ora?</i>

294
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:57,560
<i>Vieni. Vieni.</i>

295
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:59,495
- You can go with her.It's all right.
- Thanks, Laura.

296
00:13:59,563 --> 00:14:01,664
<i>Affrettatevi!</i>

297
00:14:01,732 --> 00:14:04,666
Bye. Thanks for everything.
I had a swell time.

298
00:14:04,734 --> 00:14:06,067
Bye.

299
00:14:13,909 --> 00:14:16,911
Hey, Charlie...

300
00:14:19,616 --> 00:14:22,416
Would you care to have
dinner with us this evening?

301
00:14:22,484 --> 00:14:24,385
We need
a transcontinental tour guide

302
00:14:24,453 --> 00:14:26,153
to recommend
the perfect place.

303
00:14:26,221 --> 00:14:28,188
Sure.
I guess that'd be okay.

304
00:14:28,257 --> 00:14:29,890
We'll give you two a lift.

305
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:32,393
We'll drive, yes?

306
00:14:32,461 --> 00:14:34,194
<i>Grazie.</i>

307
00:14:34,263 --> 00:14:35,863
<i>Mille grazie.</i>

308
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:37,230
She doesn't understand.

309
00:14:38,642 --> 00:14:41,411
It's my park ride out there
without the amusement.

310
00:14:41,476 --> 00:14:43,744
Surprised we made it back
in one piece.

311
00:14:43,812 --> 00:14:45,345
Rome traffic is notorious.

312
00:14:45,413 --> 00:14:47,515
Yeah, so is that housekeeper.

313
00:14:47,582 --> 00:14:50,784
Charlie is quite a character,
no?

314
00:14:50,852 --> 00:14:52,986
Yeah, I like the little guy.

315
00:14:53,053 --> 00:14:55,021
I'm gonna keep an eye
on my wallet tonight, though.

316
00:14:56,524 --> 00:14:58,357
Wanna fill me in
on the joke?

317
00:15:05,966 --> 00:15:06,933
Not here.

318
00:15:14,507 --> 00:15:16,608
<i>Uno, due, tre.</i>

319
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:19,611
Don't you already
have one from Rome?

320
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:20,779
It's a gift.

321
00:15:20,847 --> 00:15:23,749
A friend of mine
will find it very amusing.

322
00:15:23,816 --> 00:15:25,850
The second Vatican council.

323
00:15:25,918 --> 00:15:27,685
I feel like we're
a part of history.

324
00:15:27,753 --> 00:15:29,119
Change is in the air.

325
00:15:29,187 --> 00:15:32,189
Yes and no.
Women only get to watch.

326
00:15:32,257 --> 00:15:34,091
It'll be a miracle
if there's a positive stance

327
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:36,326
on birth control
any time this century.

328
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:38,295
You used precaution,
didn't you?

329
00:15:38,363 --> 00:15:39,430
Damn it, Maggie!

330
00:15:39,497 --> 00:15:41,831
Sorry, sorry.
Tick-a-lock.

331
00:15:44,035 --> 00:15:47,003
I'm gonna grab a cappuccino.

332
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:48,672
Maggie, what's your pleasure?

333
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:49,673
I'll have an espresso.

334
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,841
Laura,
hot chocolate, right?

335
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:54,744
No, I'll have
an espresso, too.

336
00:15:54,812 --> 00:15:57,079
Are you sure you don't wanna
start with a latte

337
00:15:57,146 --> 00:15:58,146
and work your way up?

338
00:15:58,214 --> 00:15:59,715
Espresso, please.

339
00:16:12,128 --> 00:16:14,896
Break up with Niko Lonza.

340
00:16:22,104 --> 00:16:25,673
Who is that man,
and how does he know me?

341
00:16:25,741 --> 00:16:26,908
Not CIA.

342
00:16:26,976 --> 00:16:28,509
Most likely Niko's people.

343
00:16:28,577 --> 00:16:30,110
Niko's people? Why?

344
00:16:30,177 --> 00:16:32,913
Betting they don't want him too
tempted by the Western world.

345
00:16:32,981 --> 00:16:34,180
Meaning me?

346
00:16:34,248 --> 00:16:36,950
Especially after his little
unauthorized escapade in Belgrade.

347
00:16:37,018 --> 00:16:39,086
Richard, am I in danger?

348
00:16:39,153 --> 00:16:41,989
They are trying
to scare you, not hurt you.

349
00:16:42,056 --> 00:16:43,256
<i>That's not what I meant.</i>

350
00:16:43,324 --> 00:16:46,325
I meant...

351
00:16:46,392 --> 00:16:48,894
Is my cover blown?

352
00:16:48,962 --> 00:16:51,130
Am I going to
end up like Bridget?

353
00:16:54,167 --> 00:16:56,301
Richard?

354
00:16:56,369 --> 00:16:58,971
Richard, please,
I can't disappear.

355
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:01,673
<i>- Please insert 2,825 lire...</i>
- Richard, are you there?

356
00:17:01,741 --> 00:17:02,874
<i>For one more minute.</i>

357
00:17:02,942 --> 00:17:05,510
<i>- Si prega di inserire...</i>
- God, Richard...

358
00:17:09,548 --> 00:17:10,749
Shoot! Richard!

359
00:17:10,816 --> 00:17:12,483
I'm here.

360
00:17:13,552 --> 00:17:14,986
Kate, listen to me.

361
00:17:15,054 --> 00:17:16,887
It is unlikely
your cover is blown.

362
00:17:16,955 --> 00:17:18,656
I will investigate
on our end,

363
00:17:18,723 --> 00:17:20,824
but I'm fairly certain
that as far as anyone knows,

364
00:17:20,892 --> 00:17:22,259
you're a stewardess.

365
00:17:22,326 --> 00:17:24,161
"Fairly certain"?

366
00:17:24,228 --> 00:17:26,263
I wanna see you as soon
as you return to New York.

367
00:17:31,069 --> 00:17:34,471
I don't know
what else to say.

368
00:17:34,539 --> 00:17:37,507
I would never have told you
to come all this way.

369
00:17:39,577 --> 00:17:40,943
Which is why
you didn't ask.

370
00:17:46,517 --> 00:17:47,784
Ginny, sit down.

371
00:17:47,851 --> 00:17:50,619
Would you sit down?

372
00:17:50,687 --> 00:17:53,556
Ginny?

373
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:01,430
Would you like
something to drink?

374
00:18:06,102 --> 00:18:09,171
I'm sorry.
I really am, but...

375
00:18:09,238 --> 00:18:12,074
It's still over between us.

376
00:18:21,398 --> 00:18:23,067
Hi.

377
00:18:24,134 --> 00:18:25,869
Thanks for being here.

378
00:18:25,937 --> 00:18:28,872
I'm feeling more calm now.

379
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,173
Much better.

380
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,141
I don't know
what possessed me.

381
00:18:32,209 --> 00:18:35,410
I was... I don't know.

382
00:18:35,479 --> 00:18:38,013
It's humiliating.

383
00:18:38,081 --> 00:18:41,283
Talk about betting
on a lame horse,

384
00:18:41,351 --> 00:18:43,251
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

385
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:45,721
I wasn't trying
to prove a point.

386
00:18:45,789 --> 00:18:47,690
It just happened.

387
00:18:47,757 --> 00:18:49,824
I love you.

388
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,729
I'm sorry.

389
00:18:59,768 --> 00:19:01,903
So you're still ending it?

390
00:19:04,006 --> 00:19:07,140
Nurse! Nurse!

391
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:10,611
I just need a few minutes.
Do you mind waiting outside?

392
00:19:10,678 --> 00:19:14,147
I need to send
a cablegram, please.

393
00:19:14,215 --> 00:19:15,949
Do you have a fever?

394
00:19:16,017 --> 00:19:17,350
No, not yet.

395
00:19:17,418 --> 00:19:20,253
Just hope I'm not coming down
with something crummy.

396
00:19:20,321 --> 00:19:22,187
You're smart
to get some rest.

397
00:19:22,255 --> 00:19:24,490
Tell the little man
I'm sorry.

398
00:19:24,558 --> 00:19:26,125
I'll take care of it.

399
00:19:26,192 --> 00:19:27,593
I'm sure Charlie
will understand.

400
00:19:27,661 --> 00:19:29,428
Thanks.

401
00:19:29,496 --> 00:19:30,663
Feel better.

402
00:19:30,731 --> 00:19:31,731
Yeah.

403
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:46,144
<i>Buona sera.</i>

404
00:19:46,211 --> 00:19:47,812
<i>Sei un fiore squisito.</i>

405
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,581
<i>Grazie a voi.</i>

406
00:19:49,649 --> 00:19:51,049
<i>Che tipo di Fiore?</i>

407
00:19:51,116 --> 00:19:53,717
<i>Una rosa.</i>

408
00:19:54,853 --> 00:19:56,554
<i>Tu sei bella.</i>

409
00:19:58,757 --> 00:20:02,192
<i>E ti piace il...</i>

410
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,360
<i>Attenzione.</i>

411
00:20:18,442 --> 00:20:20,610
Wait.

412
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:23,046
You're right.
Let's go find the bedroom.

413
00:20:23,113 --> 00:20:26,514
I...

414
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:28,149
- I should go.
- Go?

415
00:20:28,217 --> 00:20:30,919
Did I cross
the line or something?

416
00:20:30,987 --> 00:20:32,888
I mean, you seemed...
I'm not ready. I'm...

417
00:20:32,956 --> 00:20:34,790
I'm not ready.

418
00:20:37,927 --> 00:20:38,860
I'm sorry.

419
00:20:38,928 --> 00:20:40,062
Me, too.

420
00:20:40,129 --> 00:20:41,062
Anyway, I...

421
00:20:41,129 --> 00:20:42,630
I-I like, you. I...

422
00:20:42,698 --> 00:20:44,531
No need to explain.

423
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,933
My mistake.

424
00:20:46,001 --> 00:20:50,504
I didn't realize
you were so... young.

425
00:21:07,221 --> 00:21:08,354
I'm sorry.

426
00:21:08,422 --> 00:21:10,156
I was... I was trying
to be quiet.

427
00:21:10,224 --> 00:21:12,558
Hey there, Cinderella.

428
00:21:12,626 --> 00:21:14,159
I'm guessing you had fun.

429
00:21:14,227 --> 00:21:16,461
You look appropriately
disheveled.

430
00:21:16,529 --> 00:21:18,130
I'm just gonna take
a quick shower.

431
00:21:18,197 --> 00:21:20,465
This is big news.

432
00:21:20,533 --> 00:21:21,600
Are you okay?

433
00:21:21,668 --> 00:21:23,002
Sure.

434
00:21:23,069 --> 00:21:25,004
Come on, sweetie.
Don't keep me in the dark.

435
00:21:25,071 --> 00:21:28,773
How was it? Or should I say,
how was <i>he?</i>

436
00:21:28,841 --> 00:21:29,774
He was fine.

437
00:21:29,842 --> 00:21:31,109
I-I'm sorry.

438
00:21:31,176 --> 00:21:33,544
I just don't really wanna
talk about it right now.

439
00:21:33,612 --> 00:21:35,546
You don't really
wanna talk about it.

440
00:21:35,614 --> 00:21:37,115
I can respect that.

441
00:21:37,182 --> 00:21:41,085
I think you made the perfect
choice for your first time.

442
00:21:41,153 --> 00:21:43,755
He's mature, handsome,

443
00:21:43,822 --> 00:21:45,889
probably good
with his hands.

444
00:21:45,957 --> 00:21:48,391
Was he considerate?
Was it torrid?

445
00:21:48,459 --> 00:21:49,726
Good night.

446
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:53,263
<i>"Filetto mignon."</i>

447
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:55,465
Sounds good
in Italian, too.

448
00:21:55,533 --> 00:21:56,967
You picked a lovely spot.

449
00:21:57,035 --> 00:22:00,503
I'm sure our captain will be
sorry he missed this.

450
00:22:00,571 --> 00:22:02,571
Yeah, but it's okay.

451
00:22:02,639 --> 00:22:03,973
You're not too disappointed?

452
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:07,309
Everyone knows
three's a crowd.

453
00:22:07,377 --> 00:22:11,647
Besides, candlelight looks best
on a beautiful girl.

454
00:22:11,715 --> 00:22:13,415
<i>Buona sera, signora.</i>

455
00:22:13,483 --> 00:22:14,784
<i>Buona sera.</i>

456
00:22:14,851 --> 00:22:17,786
<i>Signor</i> Charlie,
your companion is <i>molto bella.</i>

457
00:22:17,853 --> 00:22:21,189
See?
Luigi agrees with me.

458
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:22,623
We'll have a bottle of the...

459
00:22:22,692 --> 00:22:25,927
Old red wine
that you decant at the table.

460
00:22:25,995 --> 00:22:26,928
Very good, sir.

461
00:22:26,996 --> 00:22:28,163
<i>Mi scusi,</i>

462
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:31,532
perhaps I'll have
a glass of Chianti instead?

463
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,702
And perhaps
you can have a taste.

464
00:22:38,406 --> 00:22:41,508
I think you're the oldest
12-year-old I've ever met.

465
00:22:41,576 --> 00:22:42,676
I'm almost 13.

466
00:22:42,744 --> 00:22:44,277
Do you enjoy school?

467
00:22:44,345 --> 00:22:46,613
It's taking forever.

468
00:22:46,681 --> 00:22:48,348
Wish I was done already.

469
00:22:48,416 --> 00:22:49,616
When you're a grown-up,

470
00:22:49,684 --> 00:22:52,051
no one can tell you
what to do or where to go.

471
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:56,256
It's funny.
I wouldn't have predicted it,

472
00:22:56,324 --> 00:22:59,192
but there are things I miss
about being your age.

473
00:23:02,763 --> 00:23:05,064
Penny for your thoughts.

474
00:23:05,132 --> 00:23:07,132
It's just
that when you're older,

475
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,237
you'll wish you had
less decisions to make.

476
00:23:11,304 --> 00:23:12,538
That's a good trick.

477
00:23:12,606 --> 00:23:15,006
I've got another one.

478
00:23:15,074 --> 00:23:16,875
Yeah?

479
00:23:19,646 --> 00:23:21,247
Close your eyes.

480
00:23:25,684 --> 00:23:27,986
Charlie, no.

481
00:23:40,386 --> 00:23:41,852
How'd you know I was here?

482
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,489
I didn't.
But I should have guessed.

483
00:23:44,556 --> 00:23:47,258
Ginny called me
early this morning.

484
00:23:50,328 --> 00:23:51,661
Sorry.

485
00:23:51,729 --> 00:23:54,431
How was, uh,
how was dinner last night?

486
00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:56,033
Unique. Growing pains.

487
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,800
I'm not sure
I handled it correctly.

488
00:23:57,868 --> 00:24:01,771
I'm not entirely convinced
I did, either.

489
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:03,507
Is she all right?

490
00:24:03,574 --> 00:24:04,973
Yeah.

491
00:24:05,042 --> 00:24:07,410
No.

492
00:24:07,477 --> 00:24:09,978
I don't... I'm not...
I'm not sure what to do.

493
00:24:11,348 --> 00:24:13,549
Why does she wanna see you?

494
00:24:13,616 --> 00:24:15,651
I'm about to find out.

495
00:24:20,023 --> 00:24:21,389
May I come in?

496
00:24:21,457 --> 00:24:24,392
If you want.

497
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:27,895
I'm happy to see you
look as well as you do.

498
00:24:27,963 --> 00:24:30,198
When you called, I was...
Eight letters.

499
00:24:30,266 --> 00:24:34,035
Begins with "B."
Plural. Describes all men.

500
00:24:34,103 --> 00:24:37,271
"Buffoons." "Bastards."

501
00:24:37,338 --> 00:24:39,339
What to choose?

502
00:24:40,708 --> 00:24:42,509
I'm sure the nurse
could find you something

503
00:24:42,577 --> 00:24:44,010
much better to read.

504
00:24:47,315 --> 00:24:48,915
You have an innocent face.

505
00:24:48,983 --> 00:24:50,417
Anyone ever told you that?

506
00:24:50,485 --> 00:24:52,251
Is that a compliment?

507
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:54,887
I like you, Colette.

508
00:24:54,955 --> 00:24:57,690
So the question of the hour,
of the minute...

509
00:24:57,757 --> 00:24:59,959
Does Dean?

510
00:25:00,026 --> 00:25:05,131
Captain Lowrey and I
are friends. Nothing more.

511
00:25:05,199 --> 00:25:08,600
Damn.

512
00:25:08,667 --> 00:25:12,704
I can't believe that
I'm actually disappointed.

513
00:25:12,771 --> 00:25:16,007
I liked having
a face on the crime.

514
00:25:19,378 --> 00:25:23,081
T.W.A.!
I had to fly T.W.A.!

515
00:25:23,149 --> 00:25:26,283
Captain Lowrey,
I'm so glad you're here.

516
00:25:26,351 --> 00:25:27,585
Mr. Henson.

517
00:25:27,652 --> 00:25:29,420
Look, how is she? I mean,
what the hell happened?

518
00:25:29,488 --> 00:25:30,988
Wait, wait, wait,
just let me...

519
00:25:31,055 --> 00:25:34,191
Let me catch my breath.

520
00:25:34,259 --> 00:25:37,128
That woman is going to be
the <i>death</i> of me.

521
00:25:37,195 --> 00:25:39,763
The whims, the demands,
the athletic assignations.

522
00:25:39,831 --> 00:25:41,998
You know, I'm not...
I'm not so young anymore.

523
00:25:42,065 --> 00:25:46,302
Still, the last part
of her wire was cryptic...

524
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:48,704
"Lost a fight
with a window"?

525
00:25:48,772 --> 00:25:50,306
I mean, can you shed
some light?

526
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:56,345
Must have killed him
not to fly Pan Am.

527
00:25:56,412 --> 00:25:58,547
And what did you hope to gain
by bringing him here?

528
00:25:58,615 --> 00:26:01,316
Pistols at dawn
might be exciting.

529
00:26:01,384 --> 00:26:03,818
I want no part of this.

530
00:26:03,886 --> 00:26:05,187
I don't want to be alone.

531
00:26:09,325 --> 00:26:12,660
There. I said it.

532
00:26:12,727 --> 00:26:14,795
I can't be alone.

533
00:26:14,863 --> 00:26:18,199
I... I can't.

534
00:26:18,267 --> 00:26:20,701
I've been you,
in your situation,

535
00:26:20,769 --> 00:26:22,637
more times
than I care to count.

536
00:26:22,704 --> 00:26:24,639
You've been on this ride?

537
00:26:25,361 --> 00:26:27,975
Someone leads you on and
then throws you away?

538
00:26:28,043 --> 00:26:33,613
I think I fell in love
with the idea of love

539
00:26:33,682 --> 00:26:36,116
as much as anything else.

540
00:26:36,184 --> 00:26:37,117
It's easy to do.

541
00:26:37,185 --> 00:26:38,819
It helps you feel safe.

542
00:26:38,887 --> 00:26:43,456
But as much as
we wish we could,

543
00:26:43,524 --> 00:26:46,025
you can't force someone
to love you.

544
00:26:49,663 --> 00:26:51,898
We had a falling out
two nights ago, she and I.

545
00:26:51,965 --> 00:26:53,599
But why come here?
Why Rome?

546
00:26:53,667 --> 00:26:57,770
Because the truth is, sir...

547
00:26:57,838 --> 00:26:59,872
Ginny and I became involved.

548
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:02,340
"Involved."

549
00:27:02,408 --> 00:27:04,743
Is that what the kids
are calling it these days?

550
00:27:08,581 --> 00:27:13,351
She followed me to Rome
after I broke things off.

551
00:27:13,419 --> 00:27:15,887
I-I regret my actions
more than I can say.

552
00:27:15,955 --> 00:27:17,988
I bet you do, buddy boy.

553
00:27:18,056 --> 00:27:20,057
I bet you do.

554
00:27:20,125 --> 00:27:24,962
I bet you think that this
information is surprising to me.

555
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:27,832
Don't be an amateur,
captain Lowrey.

556
00:27:27,899 --> 00:27:30,400
Why do you think
Ginny and I fought?

557
00:27:30,468 --> 00:27:32,703
Everett knows.

558
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:34,237
I never said "boo."

559
00:27:34,304 --> 00:27:38,108
He found out on his own.

560
00:27:38,175 --> 00:27:40,376
Some little friend
of yours, apparently.

561
00:27:40,444 --> 00:27:42,645
A stewardess?

562
00:27:42,713 --> 00:27:43,980
Who?

563
00:27:44,048 --> 00:27:47,617
He never said.
Someone who needed a favor.

564
00:27:47,684 --> 00:27:50,052
Worked out
just peachy for her.

565
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:53,555
For me not so much.

566
00:27:53,623 --> 00:27:56,391
After that, he tried
to rein me in.

567
00:27:56,459 --> 00:28:00,195
But why won't
he leave his damn wife?

568
00:28:05,067 --> 00:28:07,334
He's here now.

569
00:28:09,071 --> 00:28:11,505
Seems to me
nothing has changed...

570
00:28:11,573 --> 00:28:13,507
Unless you want it to.

571
00:28:13,575 --> 00:28:16,677
You're not
her first dalliance, captain,

572
00:28:16,745 --> 00:28:18,407
and you won't be her last.

573
00:28:18,408 --> 00:28:20,581
But a pilot from my own company?

574
00:28:20,649 --> 00:28:23,750
That is an unusual
and unwelcome departure...

575
00:28:23,818 --> 00:28:25,418
One that will soon
be permanent.

576
00:28:25,486 --> 00:28:27,553
I'm sure
there's another airline

577
00:28:27,621 --> 00:28:30,490
that'd be delighted
to have you.

578
00:28:30,557 --> 00:28:32,292
And I'm sure having
a wife and a mistress

579
00:28:32,359 --> 00:28:36,062
must be
extremely complicated.

580
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:38,964
I confided in you.
I told you I loved her.

581
00:28:39,032 --> 00:28:41,466
Hey, that's perfect,
because I don't.

582
00:28:41,534 --> 00:28:45,137
Look, I may be foolish,
but I am not a fool.

583
00:28:45,205 --> 00:28:47,572
Okay. Then I suggest that
you stop playing me for one.

584
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,909
Now I'm...
I'm done conversing.

585
00:28:49,976 --> 00:28:52,511
I said she's yours.

586
00:28:52,578 --> 00:28:55,713
Now what's it gonna be?

587
00:28:55,781 --> 00:28:58,449
Mr. Henson?

588
00:28:58,517 --> 00:29:00,351
Second door on your right.

589
00:29:00,419 --> 00:29:02,854
Ginny is quite desperate
to see you.

590
00:29:07,326 --> 00:29:10,560
Captain Lowrey,
I hope your health improves.

591
00:29:19,804 --> 00:29:21,238
Another Bourbon, please.

592
00:29:32,383 --> 00:29:36,085
Colette, <i>je suis desole.</i>

593
00:29:36,153 --> 00:29:38,054
I'm sorry, Colette.

594
00:29:38,121 --> 00:29:40,423
<i>Je suis vraiment desole.</i>

595
00:30:06,047 --> 00:30:09,350
Charlie?
You frightened me.

596
00:30:09,418 --> 00:30:12,219
Good.
I'm glad you're scared.

597
00:30:12,287 --> 00:30:14,053
What are you doing here,
Charlie?

598
00:30:14,121 --> 00:30:15,989
I came to tell you
that you're a phony.

599
00:30:16,056 --> 00:30:17,791
- A big fake.
- Charlie...

600
00:30:17,859 --> 00:30:20,627
What? I'm leaving.

601
00:30:20,695 --> 00:30:22,262
We're through.

602
00:30:22,329 --> 00:30:24,531
Charlie, please sit down.

603
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:26,633
Don't go yet.

604
00:30:26,701 --> 00:30:30,068
I'd like to talk to you.
I like talking to you.

605
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:33,972
Nobody ever does...

606
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:37,276
Unless I do
those stupid magic tricks.

607
00:30:37,343 --> 00:30:40,847
Charlie...

608
00:30:42,015 --> 00:30:44,283
I'm sorry I embarrassed you
at dinner.

609
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:47,452
It wasn't my intention.

610
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,521
Grown-ups don't really don't
really know everything.

611
00:30:49,588 --> 00:30:53,325
You don't think I know that?

612
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:55,527
I wish I didn't have
any parents.

613
00:30:55,594 --> 00:30:57,595
Charlie...

614
00:30:57,663 --> 00:31:00,299
Never wish that.

615
00:31:00,366 --> 00:31:02,767
They never want me around.

616
00:31:02,835 --> 00:31:04,736
If you only knew
how much I wish

617
00:31:04,804 --> 00:31:07,605
I'd had parents
to be mad at.

618
00:31:10,876 --> 00:31:12,444
Am I forgiven?

619
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:16,147
Okay.

620
00:31:16,214 --> 00:31:17,916
You know the trouble
with magic tricks?

621
00:31:17,983 --> 00:31:22,018
There is no surprise
for the magician.

622
00:31:22,086 --> 00:31:23,954
He knows how it ends.

623
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:27,324
You don't want to be young

624
00:31:27,391 --> 00:31:29,292
because you don't like
the way things are.

625
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,728
I don't blame you.

626
00:31:31,796 --> 00:31:36,966
But one day, you'll wake up,
and you'll be all grown up.

627
00:31:37,033 --> 00:31:39,802
It's inevitable.

628
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:42,472
And all the rest...

629
00:31:42,539 --> 00:31:45,007
It will be a surprise.

630
00:31:47,711 --> 00:31:49,512
I have some magic.

631
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:51,012
Do you wanna see it?

632
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,682
Please?

633
00:31:53,749 --> 00:31:55,383
Okay, sit.

634
00:32:02,458 --> 00:32:04,459
Part of magic

635
00:32:04,527 --> 00:32:07,427
is suspense
and expectation, right?

636
00:32:09,163 --> 00:32:10,598
What could it be?

637
00:32:13,602 --> 00:32:16,169
<i>Voila.</i>

638
00:32:17,572 --> 00:32:19,607
I didn't want
to forget you.

639
00:32:19,674 --> 00:32:22,309
And I won't.

640
00:32:25,045 --> 00:32:26,813
That's a promise.

641
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,093
I think it's this way.

642
00:32:35,089 --> 00:32:37,323
Is your knee okay?
Do you wanna go back?

643
00:32:37,391 --> 00:32:41,327
No, it's okay. I didn't
wanna miss this beautiful day.

644
00:32:42,962 --> 00:32:44,629
This is the place.

645
00:32:44,697 --> 00:32:45,864
That's it!

646
00:32:45,932 --> 00:32:48,901
That's the sculpture
Graham told me to find.

647
00:32:48,968 --> 00:32:51,603
Have you ever felt
like that?

648
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:53,405
Yes.

649
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:01,345
Here. Sit down.

650
00:33:01,413 --> 00:33:02,346
What?

651
00:33:02,414 --> 00:33:04,015
And hold still.

652
00:33:05,884 --> 00:33:07,184
Kate.

653
00:33:07,252 --> 00:33:08,786
Stop taking care of me.

654
00:33:11,256 --> 00:33:13,657
I didn't lose my virginity,

655
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:16,526
and I'm sick to death
of never knowing

656
00:33:16,593 --> 00:33:18,528
what to do or how to be.

657
00:33:18,595 --> 00:33:20,130
I had my chance to be
a modern woman,

658
00:33:20,197 --> 00:33:23,133
and I just acted like
a stupid little baby.

659
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,567
Did I get it all?

660
00:33:24,635 --> 00:33:26,836
No, just...

661
00:33:26,904 --> 00:33:27,938
Just... yeah.

662
00:33:28,005 --> 00:33:31,273
Yeah. Yeah.

663
00:33:31,341 --> 00:33:35,510
I wanted
my first time to be special,

664
00:33:35,578 --> 00:33:40,115
but Greg never pressured me,
and now...

665
00:33:40,183 --> 00:33:44,153
Now what? Will... will it turn out
to be some man I barely know?

666
00:33:45,621 --> 00:33:46,588
Maybe I'm over-thinking it.

667
00:33:46,656 --> 00:33:49,290
Maybe I should just
get it over with.

668
00:33:49,358 --> 00:33:51,225
There's something to be said
for practicality,

669
00:33:51,293 --> 00:33:53,441
but being a modern woman

670
00:33:53,442 --> 00:33:56,664
isn't about losing
your virginity.

671
00:33:58,267 --> 00:34:01,569
Do you remember that to-do list
I had in high school?

672
00:34:02,938 --> 00:34:06,106
Well, <i>that</i> was on my list.

673
00:34:06,174 --> 00:34:08,175
Who?

674
00:34:08,242 --> 00:34:10,577
Do you remember Clayton?

675
00:34:10,644 --> 00:34:12,912
From junior French club?-

676
00:34:14,582 --> 00:34:17,817
I cornered him
under the bleachers

677
00:34:17,885 --> 00:34:19,418
in a football field
after a sock hop.

678
00:34:19,486 --> 00:34:20,919
You did not!

679
00:34:20,988 --> 00:34:23,956
Yeah, we were hopeless.

680
00:34:24,024 --> 00:34:25,224
Tangled in my crinolines,

681
00:34:25,292 --> 00:34:27,626
and his boutonniere
kept stabbing me.

682
00:34:27,694 --> 00:34:29,996
No.

683
00:34:30,063 --> 00:34:31,830
You know, gave it
the old college try.

684
00:34:31,898 --> 00:34:32,931
Stop, stop.

685
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,666
That's probably what
I should have said.

686
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:41,772
Laura.

687
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,609
Just follow
your instincts.

688
00:34:44,676 --> 00:34:47,145
You'll know
when it's right.

689
00:35:09,166 --> 00:35:10,933
I-I don't need to know

690
00:35:11,001 --> 00:35:13,430
what happened in that
room with Ginny.

691
00:35:13,431 --> 00:35:14,037
Good.

692
00:35:14,104 --> 00:35:18,541
But I'm... pretty sure that
I should be saying "thank you."

693
00:35:18,608 --> 00:35:20,709
No, not really.

694
00:35:22,413 --> 00:35:23,811
Well, they're together now.

695
00:35:23,879 --> 00:35:26,214
They always were.

696
00:35:26,282 --> 00:35:30,052
Some people can play at love
like it's a sport...

697
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:33,622
A game. It's not.

698
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:36,358
Well, regardless,

699
00:35:36,426 --> 00:35:39,527
the "thank you" stands,
all right?

700
00:35:39,594 --> 00:35:42,296
- I'll see ya.
- See you.

701
00:35:42,364 --> 00:35:45,832
5 loose cups on the floor,
row 10.

702
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,768
The chocolate twins.

703
00:35:47,835 --> 00:35:49,703
And three empty vodka bottles...
Their mother.

704
00:35:51,606 --> 00:35:54,508
I meant to say this before,
but congratulations.

705
00:35:54,576 --> 00:35:55,675
For?

706
00:35:55,742 --> 00:35:56,842
Your job...
You saved it.

707
00:35:58,279 --> 00:36:00,580
I thought all was lost.

708
00:36:00,647 --> 00:36:03,649
They just needed
a little persuading.

709
00:36:03,717 --> 00:36:05,885
I didn't think anyone could
persuade the base manager.

710
00:36:05,953 --> 00:36:09,389
Did you secure
all the stemware?

711
00:36:09,457 --> 00:36:11,523
I know how much this job
means to you.

712
00:36:11,591 --> 00:36:14,393
You must have been
so frightened.

713
00:36:14,461 --> 00:36:17,129
Desperate, even.

714
00:36:17,197 --> 00:36:18,797
What did you say to him?

715
00:36:18,864 --> 00:36:23,368
Not much. The usual...
Smoke and mirrors.

716
00:36:23,436 --> 00:36:25,204
I should've guessed

717
00:36:25,271 --> 00:36:27,138
you would have a trick
up your sleeve.

718
00:36:27,206 --> 00:36:31,542
A little something <i>extra</i>.

719
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:35,079
What do you mean,
something extra?

720
00:36:35,147 --> 00:36:36,481
The usual...

721
00:36:36,548 --> 00:36:38,616
Maggie's magic.

722
00:36:40,051 --> 00:36:41,285
Who knows
what any one of us

723
00:36:41,353 --> 00:36:43,987
would have done
in your situation?

724
00:36:45,523 --> 00:36:50,027
All looks good. I'm off.

725
00:36:56,867 --> 00:37:00,202
"I'm terrified, Niko.
It was awful.

726
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:03,439
What do you think it means?"

727
00:37:06,309 --> 00:37:07,809
Try it again.

728
00:37:09,446 --> 00:37:11,147
Kate, can you do this?
When you say it,

729
00:37:11,214 --> 00:37:12,648
- believe it.
- I believe it.

730
00:37:12,715 --> 00:37:15,683
And so will he. I know him.
He will be upset.

731
00:37:15,751 --> 00:37:17,352
Niko's people want him
to toe the line.

732
00:37:17,419 --> 00:37:19,200
And you want him to be
upset with his people.

733
00:37:19,201 --> 00:37:19,820
It'll help him.

734
00:37:19,888 --> 00:37:21,656
It'll help you,
is what you mean.

735
00:37:21,723 --> 00:37:24,959
Us. And in this case,
it is the same thing.

736
00:37:25,027 --> 00:37:27,462
So I deliver
their not-so-cryptic message,

737
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:28,863
and then what happens?

738
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:31,598
Wouldn't an ordinary girl
run from all this?

739
00:37:33,468 --> 00:37:35,001
You want me
to break up with him?

740
00:37:35,069 --> 00:37:36,102
I want you to tell him

741
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:38,272
what a frightened girl
would tell him...

742
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:40,541
That you need some time
to collect yourself.

743
00:37:40,608 --> 00:37:42,509
How much time?

744
00:37:42,577 --> 00:37:45,345
Depends. We'll see.

745
00:37:45,413 --> 00:37:48,047
You might be back on the job
before you know it.

746
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:06,864
Kate?

747
00:38:06,932 --> 00:38:08,099
What is it?
Are... are you okay?

748
00:38:13,939 --> 00:38:16,374
You sure I didn't wake you?

749
00:38:16,442 --> 00:38:19,810
It's only, uh, 7:00.

750
00:38:19,877 --> 00:38:23,046
I always look like this
when I've been in the darkroom.

751
00:38:23,114 --> 00:38:25,649
Come out like a bear
who's been hibernating.

752
00:38:25,717 --> 00:38:26,983
Thin and hungry.

753
00:38:27,051 --> 00:38:30,053
Fur all matted,
disoriented.

754
00:38:30,121 --> 00:38:31,988
I brought you something.

755
00:38:32,056 --> 00:38:34,958
Yes. Rome.

756
00:38:35,026 --> 00:38:37,760
Did you, uh,
find that sculpture?

757
00:38:37,828 --> 00:38:40,430
I did.

758
00:38:40,497 --> 00:38:41,797
And?

759
00:38:41,865 --> 00:38:43,600
Is your camera handy?

760
00:38:43,667 --> 00:38:45,101
It's always handy. Why?

761
00:38:51,674 --> 00:38:56,712
I wanna feel how liberating
anonymous can be.

762
00:38:56,779 --> 00:38:58,113
Are you sure?

763
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:01,582
No. But I'm gonna do it
anyway...

764
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:04,652
If you're fine with it.

765
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,188
Is it warm enough for you?

766
00:39:12,928 --> 00:39:15,695
No, I've got it.

767
00:39:15,764 --> 00:39:18,431
This is
about self-expression.

768
00:39:18,499 --> 00:39:20,467
Understood.
