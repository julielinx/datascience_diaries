1
00:00:00,665 --> 00:00:02,485
Previously on "Pan Am".

2
00:00:02,664 --> 00:00:04,764
Why don't you came out of the fog,
captain?

3
00:00:05,162 --> 00:00:07,962
- Do we have an affirm here?
- Yes, of course.

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,850
- It's the vice-president.
- I don't plan on telling him.

5
00:00:10,967 --> 00:00:13,867
- Will we go for a ride?
- Think I've already been taken for one.

6
00:00:14,131 --> 00:00:16,731
Will be a man on your next flight.
Nico Lonza.

7
00:00:16,755 --> 00:00:18,575
We need fingerprints.

8
00:00:19,416 --> 00:00:20,916
- After you.
- Pardon me?

9
00:00:20,998 --> 00:00:23,198
We'd all like to know how your wings
will act these days.

10
00:00:23,264 --> 00:00:25,459
Miss Ryden, I can continue
our conversation

11
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,464
with your supervisor
upon of her return.

12
00:00:27,552 --> 00:00:28,620
You kept this up,

13
00:00:28,621 --> 00:00:31,052
you're not came be
around much longer.

14
00:00:44,001 --> 00:00:45,080
So what do you say?

15
00:00:48,326 --> 00:00:50,194
Am I a Pan Am material?

16
00:00:50,228 --> 00:00:52,062
My shoes and socks, too?

17
00:00:52,097 --> 00:00:54,431
Remarkably comfortable,
I must say.

18
00:00:54,466 --> 00:00:55,733
Well, I'll have
to buy you a pair.

19
00:00:55,767 --> 00:00:59,670
Mm. Men's socks...
The way to a woman's heart.

20
00:00:59,704 --> 00:01:02,573
Mmm.

21
00:01:02,607 --> 00:01:04,975
Promise not
to have too much fun in Rio?

22
00:01:05,009 --> 00:01:06,827
What am I gonna wear?

23
00:01:09,297 --> 00:01:15,619
What I did... it was stupid,
miss Havemeyer. I apologize.

24
00:01:15,653 --> 00:01:18,489
I was attempting
a little levity, uh, stupidly.

25
00:01:18,523 --> 00:01:20,424
And at my expense.

26
00:01:20,458 --> 00:01:23,460
At the expense
of Pan American world airways.

27
00:01:23,495 --> 00:01:26,796
- How did I hurt Pan Am?
- My ability to effectively...

28
00:01:26,811 --> 00:01:29,629
Never mind.
You're right.

29
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,329
I made a mistake.

30
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:33,649
I will <i>never</i> do it again.

31
00:01:33,651 --> 00:01:36,153
As this is one
of several infractions,

32
00:01:36,187 --> 00:01:39,156
your file will be sent
to the base manager.

33
00:01:39,174 --> 00:01:42,559
Excuse me.
Are you firing me?

34
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,154
The matter is now
under review...

35
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:48,058
Please. I have worked
my entire life to be here.

36
00:01:48,092 --> 00:01:53,363
<i>And</i> until an official decision
is made, yes, you are grounded.

37
00:01:53,397 --> 00:01:55,065
But I have a flight
to Brazil in two hours.

38
00:01:55,099 --> 00:01:56,299
We'll find a replacement.

39
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:59,636
Who can speak Portuguese?

40
00:02:03,841 --> 00:02:05,642
Maggie.

41
00:02:05,676 --> 00:02:07,544
- Whoa, Maggie, watch out.
- Oh.

42
00:02:07,578 --> 00:02:08,778
Ohh. Whoa.
You almost stepped in it.

43
00:02:08,813 --> 00:02:10,413
Yeah. Nothing new.

44
00:02:10,448 --> 00:02:12,449
Hey. I tried you at home.

45
00:02:12,483 --> 00:02:13,917
You were pulled
from the Rio flight.

46
00:02:14,679 --> 00:02:16,763
No, not yet. Mrs. Olcott said
that I could still...

47
00:02:16,815 --> 00:02:19,082
Not you, Maggie. Kate.

48
00:02:19,117 --> 00:02:21,869
Me? Uh, why?

49
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,005
Headquarters can't find
your smallpox vaccination.

50
00:02:25,089 --> 00:02:27,491
Uh, d-do you want to see
the scar?

51
00:02:27,525 --> 00:02:29,042
They suspect
it's their mistake,

52
00:02:29,093 --> 00:02:30,794
but they still can't let you fly
until it's sorted out.

53
00:02:30,812 --> 00:02:33,764
Could be a good thing.
Your landlord called.

54
00:02:33,798 --> 00:02:35,549
There's a busted pipe
in your building.

55
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:37,668
Uh, d-did he leave a name?

56
00:02:37,702 --> 00:02:39,269
Richard something.

57
00:02:39,287 --> 00:02:40,204
Mm-hmm.

58
00:02:40,238 --> 00:02:41,922
What's with
the photographer?

59
00:02:41,924 --> 00:02:43,240
"Life" magazin

60
00:02:43,274 --> 00:02:45,509
they're doing a follow-up piece
of their April profile...

61
00:02:45,543 --> 00:02:47,444
"Day in the life
of Pan Am stewardesses."

62
00:02:47,478 --> 00:02:48,896
Really? Our crew?

63
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,330
Uh, don't get too excited.

64
00:02:50,365 --> 00:02:52,182
He's specifically here
for Laura.

65
00:02:52,217 --> 00:02:54,251
Sprung it on her
ten minutes ago.

66
00:02:54,285 --> 00:02:57,688
Huh. The powers that be are just
full of surprises this morning.

67
00:02:57,722 --> 00:02:59,556
And I'm off to deal
with a plumber.

68
00:02:59,591 --> 00:03:00,557
Mm.

69
00:03:00,591 --> 00:03:01,692
Take care of my sister.

70
00:03:01,726 --> 00:03:04,928
Oh, don't worry.
I won't leave her side.

71
00:03:09,467 --> 00:03:13,370
Sync and corrected by dr.jackson
for www.addic7ed.com

72
00:03:15,191 --> 00:03:17,559
More ginger ale for you,
Mrs. Brous?

73
00:03:17,594 --> 00:03:20,262
Yes, but this time
with a little Bourbon.

74
00:03:20,296 --> 00:03:21,397
Two fingers.

75
00:03:21,431 --> 00:03:23,133
As soon as we're airborne.

76
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,108
Sorry.
A little Pan Am posterity.

77
00:03:29,928 --> 00:03:32,212
Best opening line I've had
in months.

78
00:03:32,247 --> 00:03:33,330
A book?

79
00:03:33,381 --> 00:03:35,716
But not just any book.
"The feminine mystique."

80
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,667
You actually read
the whole thing?

81
00:03:37,821 --> 00:03:39,472
Didn't skip to the answer key
in the back?

82
00:03:39,471 --> 00:03:42,156
Half a million copies sold,
and to whom?

83
00:03:42,207 --> 00:03:43,536
Women,
and understanding women

84
00:03:43,537 --> 00:03:44,909
is the best way to get women.

85
00:03:44,943 --> 00:03:47,277
You understand women?

86
00:03:47,296 --> 00:03:50,115
Oh, less than ever, but at least
now it sounds like I do.

87
00:03:51,133 --> 00:03:53,084
Mink. 12:00.

88
00:03:55,921 --> 00:03:58,422
You're flying
your paramour down to Rio?

89
00:04:04,313 --> 00:04:06,230
Good morning.
Welcome aboard.

90
00:04:06,232 --> 00:04:07,848
Well, thank you.

91
00:04:07,899 --> 00:04:10,017
Hello, miss Saddler.

92
00:04:10,068 --> 00:04:13,303
Captain Lowrey,
you remembered me.

93
00:04:13,322 --> 00:04:14,772
I'm flattered.

94
00:04:14,806 --> 00:04:18,542
And I'm surprised to see you
flying with us again so soon.

95
00:04:18,577 --> 00:04:21,178
It seems I can't get enough
of your Pan Am service.

96
00:04:21,213 --> 00:04:24,031
Well, we'll try not
to disappoint.

97
00:04:24,082 --> 00:04:28,169
I'm counting on it.
Love the uniform.

98
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,592
Colette, I need you
to switch to economy.

99
00:04:34,626 --> 00:04:36,627
Laura's in first.
I'll cover both.

100
00:04:36,661 --> 00:04:39,730
Covering both
or covering the photographer?

101
00:04:39,765 --> 00:04:43,718
I'm in need
of a little public relations.

102
00:04:43,769 --> 00:04:45,803
Is that how they call it
these days?

103
00:04:45,837 --> 00:04:49,340
Management and I have
a small difference of opinion.

104
00:04:49,374 --> 00:04:50,641
Anything serious?

105
00:04:50,675 --> 00:04:54,111
No, just my usual pickle.

106
00:04:54,146 --> 00:04:56,113
- Okay.
- Okay.

107
00:04:56,148 --> 00:04:58,816
Order up.

108
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,853
Oh.
Not again with that book.

109
00:05:02,888 --> 00:05:04,188
Takes me out
of this place.

110
00:05:04,206 --> 00:05:05,791
So does that door.

111
00:05:06,487 --> 00:05:07,904
Outside that door is
a crazy father

112
00:05:07,939 --> 00:05:10,323
in a trailer
with two flat tires.

113
00:05:10,358 --> 00:05:12,993
In here,
at least everyone's pretty,

114
00:05:13,027 --> 00:05:14,628
all their clothes are
beautiful,

115
00:05:14,662 --> 00:05:17,230
and none of the parties
serve beer.

116
00:05:17,248 --> 00:05:18,999
Books make me sleepy.

117
00:05:20,901 --> 00:05:25,705
<i>Nao Leia. Trabalhe!</i>
<i>Voce e uma garconete terrevendo.</i>

118
00:05:25,739 --> 00:05:29,259
How about some English?
I don't speak Portuguese.

119
00:05:29,293 --> 00:05:30,627
This is America.

120
00:05:30,678 --> 00:05:33,013
You bad waitress.
You pick up.

121
00:05:33,047 --> 00:05:36,200
You mean boss.
You hold horses.

122
00:05:48,238 --> 00:05:52,699
3 cents? 3 cents?
I live off my tips.

123
00:05:52,733 --> 00:05:53,984
I grasp that.

124
00:05:54,035 --> 00:05:58,121
Really? You grasp that?
What was wrong with my service?

125
00:05:58,156 --> 00:05:59,539
The service was adequate.

126
00:05:59,574 --> 00:06:02,006
Then why didn't you leave me
an adequate tip?

127
00:06:02,276 --> 00:06:03,977
I didn't want
to encourage you.

128
00:06:06,214 --> 00:06:09,082
I drove my first truck here
right after the war,

129
00:06:09,116 --> 00:06:12,199
and, uh, Rose in there
served me coffee, black.

130
00:06:12,975 --> 00:06:16,223
I was saving up to go
to school on my G.I. bill,

131
00:06:16,645 --> 00:06:20,760
but 14 years later,
I'm still driving a truck.

132
00:06:20,928 --> 00:06:23,296
And she's still pouring Joe.

133
00:06:38,525 --> 00:06:40,580
Wait!

134
00:06:41,216 --> 00:06:43,016
Wait!

135
00:06:43,067 --> 00:06:45,801
Stop! Wait!
I'm coming with you!

136
00:06:45,953 --> 00:06:48,321
Stop! I'm coming!

137
00:06:58,382 --> 00:07:00,307
August in New York.

138
00:07:00,926 --> 00:07:03,074
Even the flies are sweating.

139
00:07:04,004 --> 00:07:06,510
Smallpox? Really?

140
00:07:06,866 --> 00:07:09,901
I could have just told them
your results were back,

141
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:12,385
set their inquiring minds
aquiver.

142
00:07:12,892 --> 00:07:16,326
- Why did you pull me from my flight?
- Why haven't I heard from you?

143
00:07:16,472 --> 00:07:18,690
I haven't had anything
since Monte Carlo.

144
00:07:18,654 --> 00:07:19,611
Haven't you?

145
00:07:19,612 --> 00:07:23,438
Your friend at the united nations...
Niko Lonza?

146
00:07:24,643 --> 00:07:27,557
I've seen him a few times.
You said he wasn't the target.

147
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:29,306
At the time he wasn't.

148
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:32,682
Lonza works
at the Yugoslavian consulate.

149
00:07:32,737 --> 00:07:35,619
Their president, Josip Tito, has
been playing us off the Soviets.

150
00:07:35,975 --> 00:07:39,612
How does that involve
Nik... Mr. Lonza?

151
00:07:39,721 --> 00:07:43,127
Your Niko's leaving town
this week, diplomatic business.

152
00:07:43,161 --> 00:07:45,365
We need the wheretos
and whatfors

153
00:07:45,392 --> 00:07:47,500
and where he stands
politically.

154
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,310
We never talk politics.

155
00:07:50,008 --> 00:07:51,509
Here's your chance.

156
00:07:57,676 --> 00:07:59,143
An amusement park?

157
00:07:59,537 --> 00:08:02,305
Go play some hooky
with your communist friend.

158
00:08:06,662 --> 00:08:08,551
<i>Weather in Rio de Janeiro is a lovely</i>

159
00:08:08,578 --> 00:08:10,005
<i>72 degrees.</i>

160
00:08:10,078 --> 00:08:12,265
<i>Should be a nice break</i>
<i>from the New York humidity.</i>

161
00:08:13,369 --> 00:08:15,137
Again...  Don't pose.

162
00:08:15,584 --> 00:08:18,769
I don't know how not to.
Excuse me.

163
00:08:18,992 --> 00:08:21,421
You looked totally natural
in that cover picture.

164
00:08:21,477 --> 00:08:23,545
Because I didn't know anyone
was taking it.

165
00:08:23,713 --> 00:08:24,763
Hard to surprise you here.

166
00:08:24,814 --> 00:08:26,175
Where am I gonna stand?

167
00:08:26,245 --> 00:08:27,738
They told me
this wouldn't happen,

168
00:08:27,817 --> 00:08:30,786
- if at all, until next month.
- What can I say?

169
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:33,222
Your Pan Am brass suddenly
wanted this in Rio.

170
00:08:33,256 --> 00:08:34,856
If I may, mister, uh...

171
00:08:34,874 --> 00:08:36,324
"Graham" will do.

172
00:08:36,511 --> 00:08:38,994
Well, Graham,
if you want to see more

173
00:08:39,028 --> 00:08:42,998
of the candid, spontaneous side
of the Pan Am stewardess,

174
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,873
you really need to see us
out of uniform.

175
00:08:46,085 --> 00:08:47,169
Out of uniform?

176
00:08:47,203 --> 00:08:51,640
Oh, don't get ideas.
I mean Rio. I've made a list.

177
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:55,354
Shopping,
the beaches of Ipanema,

178
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:58,897
the botanical gardens,
a night of samba, bossa nova.

179
00:08:58,975 --> 00:09:00,045
Ambitious list.

180
00:09:00,092 --> 00:09:02,068
You should see
the one I sent Santa.

181
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:07,667
Look, Laura's a little uncomfortable
with too much attention,

182
00:09:07,675 --> 00:09:09,051
but she listens to me.

183
00:09:09,106 --> 00:09:11,352
I can make this easier
for both of you,

184
00:09:11,353 --> 00:09:13,148
if you could do a girl a favor.

185
00:09:13,282 --> 00:09:15,200
I've worked
with temperamental before.

186
00:09:15,244 --> 00:09:17,078
I meant me.

187
00:09:18,326 --> 00:09:21,376
Laura was three weeks out
of training when that cover

188
00:09:21,415 --> 00:09:24,152
landed her a spot
on this brand-new clipper.

189
00:09:24,609 --> 00:09:27,463
Maybe you could rinkle
some of that fairy dust my way

190
00:09:27,565 --> 00:09:29,655
and help me get out
of a jam?

191
00:09:29,718 --> 00:09:31,852
Hey, I'm just a guy
with a camera.

192
00:09:31,887 --> 00:09:34,321
Who decides
where it's pointed.

193
00:09:37,612 --> 00:09:38,884
Nice maneuver,

194
00:09:38,915 --> 00:09:41,250
but you'll never give him
the slip at 30,000 feet.

195
00:09:41,284 --> 00:09:43,099
I can't understand why
they couldn't pick

196
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,353
someone with more experience.

197
00:09:44,407 --> 00:09:46,358
Experience is overrated.

198
00:09:46,573 --> 00:09:49,558
Maggie, I need your help
with a woman in 11C.

199
00:09:49,592 --> 00:09:52,444
She wants something
but only speaks Portuguese.

200
00:09:53,497 --> 00:09:55,898
Whenever I have to do something
I really don't want to,

201
00:09:55,932 --> 00:09:57,769
I pretend I'm playing a role,

202
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:59,742
like an actress in a movie.

203
00:09:59,827 --> 00:10:01,744
Give him a little...

204
00:10:02,316 --> 00:10:03,716
Bete Boop?

205
00:10:03,906 --> 00:10:05,248
Brigitte Bardot?

206
00:10:05,584 --> 00:10:07,948
- Bardot's a blonde.
- Not originally.

207
00:10:08,027 --> 00:10:09,695
- Oh.
- Hello, ladies.

208
00:10:09,948 --> 00:10:12,656
I know that I shouldn't, but I'm
just going to poke my head in.

209
00:10:12,734 --> 00:10:14,975
Do you want me to take
anything in to the pilots?

210
00:10:15,962 --> 00:10:18,187
Uh, I-I don't think so.

211
00:10:19,057 --> 00:10:20,991
Roger that.

212
00:10:23,138 --> 00:10:24,537
Should I have stopped her?

213
00:10:24,588 --> 00:10:26,122
She is Mr. Henson's secretary...

214
00:10:26,156 --> 00:10:28,925
And Mr. Henson is
a Pan Am vice president.

215
00:10:28,951 --> 00:10:29,885
Oh.

216
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:32,731
If that woman is
Henson's secretary,

217
00:10:32,824 --> 00:10:34,000
then I'm his dog Walker.

218
00:10:35,224 --> 00:10:37,058
- 11c? 
- Portuguese.

219
00:10:39,144 --> 00:10:42,203
"Movie. Fred and Ginger."
15 letters.

220
00:10:42,304 --> 00:10:44,254
Mm. Easy. "Flying down to Rio."

221
00:10:44,418 --> 00:10:46,351
Is that whole puzzle about Rio?

222
00:10:46,415 --> 00:10:47,844
Okay, smarty-pants.

223
00:10:48,419 --> 00:10:51,197
"'Hunchback' in Portuguese."
Nine letters.

224
00:10:51,369 --> 00:10:53,369
Sanjeev covers
the hunchback stuff.

225
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:54,818
<i>Corcovado.</i>

226
00:10:54,998 --> 00:10:57,723
- Gold star, captain Lowrey.
- Corco-what?

227
00:10:57,794 --> 00:10:58,863
Corcovado...

228
00:10:59,035 --> 00:11:01,024
That beautiful mountain right
in the middle of the city.

229
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:02,529
The one with big Jesus?

230
00:11:02,665 --> 00:11:04,654
I'm always afraid we're gonna
fly right in him.

231
00:11:04,765 --> 00:11:06,593
I think big Jesus
is where my boss

232
00:11:06,594 --> 00:11:08,473
wants to take some
of the pictures.

233
00:11:10,022 --> 00:11:12,256
That would be
Mr. Henson, vice president?

234
00:11:12,353 --> 00:11:13,650
He's gonna be in Rio?

235
00:11:13,713 --> 00:11:16,778
Oh, he's already there...
Preparing or something.

236
00:11:16,813 --> 00:11:19,153
"Life" magazine photo shoot
with one of the stewardesses.

237
00:11:19,317 --> 00:11:20,810
And that's why
you're headed down.

238
00:11:20,966 --> 00:11:23,027
Well, you know these V.P.s.
Can't blow their nose

239
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:26,454
without a gal and a steno pad
by their side, so here I am.

240
00:11:26,488 --> 00:11:29,858
Yes, here you are.

241
00:11:36,206 --> 00:11:37,583
Keeping that for yourself,
are you?

242
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:39,748
Maybe it's for
a special girl back home.

243
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:42,620
You say that because you know
how competitive I am.

244
00:11:42,706 --> 00:11:45,020
It's for my niece Magda.

245
00:11:45,054 --> 00:11:46,971
In Yugoslavia,
we don't have bears.

246
00:11:47,005 --> 00:11:48,639
We have wolves.

247
00:11:48,657 --> 00:11:49,824
You're going home?

248
00:11:49,956 --> 00:11:51,743
Yeah, to Zagreb,
just for one week.

249
00:11:52,667 --> 00:11:54,829
You will miss me?

250
00:11:54,864 --> 00:11:56,548
Is that a command
or a question?

251
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,233
Both.

252
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:02,685
- A fortune-teller.
- Let's get our palms read.

253
00:12:02,749 --> 00:12:05,573
I don't need to come all
the way to America to be swindled.

254
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,059
Well, that's too bad.

255
00:12:08,077 --> 00:12:10,181
A gypsy woman once told me
I'd fall in love

256
00:12:10,205 --> 00:12:12,015
with
a dark, handsome stranger.

257
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,121
And instead you're stuck
with me.

258
00:12:14,512 --> 00:12:17,010
You see?
Anyone can read a palm.

259
00:12:22,677 --> 00:12:24,277
Bad news?

260
00:12:24,312 --> 00:12:25,812
A secret.

261
00:12:25,847 --> 00:12:27,147
Which one?

262
00:12:27,181 --> 00:12:28,515
Any one you want to tell me.

263
00:12:28,549 --> 00:12:30,917
Here? You want to ar
a secret?

264
00:12:30,952 --> 00:12:33,353
We could always leave it
to the gypsy.

265
00:12:34,733 --> 00:12:36,784
Here is a secret.

266
00:12:37,892 --> 00:12:40,087
My mind is full of you.

267
00:12:40,762 --> 00:12:44,881
I go to sleep this way.
I wake up this way.

268
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:47,539
You follow me like
a ghost...

269
00:12:48,169 --> 00:12:50,504
Which is no good.

270
00:12:50,571 --> 00:12:51,938
No good?

271
00:12:52,363 --> 00:12:55,165
With a ghost,
I can't do this.

272
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:57,544
Mm.

273
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:00,547
Mm.

274
00:13:07,022 --> 00:13:09,424
And the bear is yours.

275
00:13:26,207 --> 00:13:28,659
You aren't following me,
are you?

276
00:13:28,693 --> 00:13:30,877
I was about to ask you
the same thing.

277
00:13:32,246 --> 00:13:34,333
Oh, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

278
00:13:34,932 --> 00:13:36,783
Allow me.

279
00:13:44,917 --> 00:13:48,862
You didn't, by any chance,
arrange this, did you?

280
00:13:49,823 --> 00:13:53,070
Right next door. I'm good,
but I'm not that good.

281
00:13:53,534 --> 00:13:56,336
I hope you and Henson
aren't the noisy type.

282
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:57,973
Or that foolish.

283
00:13:58,036 --> 00:14:00,330
Well, you're certainly
not that forthcoming.

284
00:14:00,501 --> 00:14:02,820
Nine hours ago, it's all tickle
tea and socks.

285
00:14:02,891 --> 00:14:06,042
There's no mention of Rio,
no mention of Henson.

286
00:14:06,094 --> 00:14:07,528
And if I had?

287
00:14:09,152 --> 00:14:12,345
Then I might have discouraged
you from flying Pan Am today.

288
00:14:13,526 --> 00:14:16,156
Well, then I guess I am
that good.

289
00:14:17,912 --> 00:14:19,938
Monte Carlo was a lark.

290
00:14:20,132 --> 00:14:22,700
It was wild,
and by some miracle,

291
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,121
we managed to swerve around
the accident in the road,

292
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:28,825
but Rio... Rio is the accident
waiting to happen.

293
00:14:29,421 --> 00:14:31,222
Let's keep it in New York,
Ginny.

294
00:14:31,352 --> 00:14:35,369
We can read the road signs.
We can speak the language.

295
00:14:38,009 --> 00:14:41,181
Hit with common sense,
the mighty warrior falls.

296
00:14:50,888 --> 00:14:53,803
Kate specifically asked
for an alligator bag.

297
00:14:54,335 --> 00:14:56,437
I
think we got enough shopping.

298
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,920
Now I'm wasting film.

299
00:14:58,014 --> 00:14:59,810
I haven't even bought
anything yet.

300
00:14:59,844 --> 00:15:02,212
What was wrong with the clutch
with the big buckles?

301
00:15:02,247 --> 00:15:06,183
Genuine alligator "style"...
If "style" means plastic.

302
00:15:06,217 --> 00:15:07,751
Will Kate even know
the difference?

303
00:15:07,785 --> 00:15:10,287
Meanwhile, somewhere people
are dancing the bossa nova.

304
00:15:10,321 --> 00:15:13,323
I-I'm sorry.
You... you two go ahead.

305
00:15:13,358 --> 00:15:14,972
Kate never asks me
for anything,

306
00:15:15,034 --> 00:15:17,344
and I really want to do
this for her.

307
00:15:17,378 --> 00:15:19,062
I thought we had a deal.

308
00:15:19,097 --> 00:15:20,397
I'll get her back on track.

309
00:15:20,431 --> 00:15:23,057
Meet us by that big red canoe
we saw in 15 minutes.

310
00:15:23,143 --> 00:15:25,813
But not much longer.
Life is waiting.

311
00:15:33,988 --> 00:15:37,256
Did we mention
we're stewardesses?

312
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:39,018
We can tell everybody
on the plane

313
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:41,841
how to find your shop
or tell them to stay away.

314
00:15:42,021 --> 00:15:43,805
- Pan Am?
- All day long.

315
00:15:43,969 --> 00:15:47,658
So we'd like the real thing
but for the plastic prices.

316
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,683
<i>Tudo</i> <i>bem.</i>

317
00:15:52,193 --> 00:15:55,227
Stick with me, kid.
I know the lay of the land.

318
00:15:57,733 --> 00:15:59,686
Drop slips are red.
Folder.

319
00:15:59,766 --> 00:16:01,450
Add slips are blue.
Blue folder.

320
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:04,029
We usually hire a student
for this job,

321
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:06,333
but they can be
so unreliable.

322
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:08,268
What's this folder for?

323
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:09,861
That's a request
for transcripts.

324
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:11,820
That gets walked down
to Harvey in records.

325
00:16:11,854 --> 00:16:13,801
Now he will probably offer
you an official degree

326
00:16:13,824 --> 00:16:15,023
for your phone number.

327
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,558
You want to avoid him.

328
00:16:16,592 --> 00:16:19,827
And where is he exactly,
so I can avoid him?

329
00:16:19,874 --> 00:16:21,727
Main administration building.

330
00:16:21,997 --> 00:16:24,002
Oh.

331
00:16:26,836 --> 00:16:29,604
I need to drop a class.
Roxanne Gibson.

332
00:16:31,187 --> 00:16:34,009
Oh, world literature.
It's a shame.

333
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:36,647
Oh, I know. Professor Kolker
is supposed to be wonderful,

334
00:16:36,693 --> 00:16:38,653
but it interferes
with my job.

335
00:16:38,685 --> 00:16:39,685
You're a stewardess?

336
00:16:39,719 --> 00:16:42,673
Yes. Pan Am.
Guess it's a giveaway.

337
00:16:42,712 --> 00:16:45,361
Oh, it's more than that.
The way you carry yourself.

338
00:16:45,455 --> 00:16:49,221
Pan Am training... confidence,
leadership, and diplomacy,

339
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:51,973
all done with style
and poise.

340
00:16:52,033 --> 00:16:53,360
Poise.

341
00:16:53,425 --> 00:16:57,045
Anyway, I work Friday flights
so I can fit in classes here,

342
00:16:57,094 --> 00:16:59,662
but I have to sacrifice
world lit.

343
00:16:59,862 --> 00:17:01,863
Mm. Red slip.

344
00:17:01,897 --> 00:17:03,548
I'll take care of it.

345
00:17:14,835 --> 00:17:17,428
Don't you have more important
things you could be doing?

346
00:17:23,532 --> 00:17:25,823
Welcome to world literature.

347
00:17:26,668 --> 00:17:30,351
As I call your name,
respond not with "here"

348
00:17:30,496 --> 00:17:33,155
but with the title of the one
book that you would request

349
00:17:33,181 --> 00:17:35,387
if you we shipwrecked
on a desert island.

350
00:17:35,507 --> 00:17:40,081
From that, I will extrapolate
and perhaps judge you.

351
00:17:41,265 --> 00:17:42,071
Marnsdale.

352
00:17:42,306 --> 00:17:43,539
"A farewell to arms."

353
00:17:43,795 --> 00:17:45,942
Cheer up, Barnsdale.

354
00:17:45,976 --> 00:17:47,319
Lareau.

355
00:17:47,647 --> 00:17:49,212
"Tropic of cancer."

356
00:17:49,246 --> 00:17:52,444
Well-played, Lareau. You're on
a desert island, after all.

357
00:17:53,373 --> 00:17:54,889
Gibson.

358
00:17:55,994 --> 00:17:57,228
Roxanne Gibson.

359
00:17:58,265 --> 00:17:59,727
"The Great Gatsby."

360
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:02,287
Torn between the lunk
who opens your coconuts

361
00:18:02,311 --> 00:18:03,740
and the man you left behind?

362
00:18:03,838 --> 00:18:07,107
Oh, I'm not Daisy, sir.
I'm Gatsby.

363
00:18:07,141 --> 00:18:09,426
Ah. In love with
what she can't have.

364
00:18:09,477 --> 00:18:12,245
You do realize you end up shot
to death in your own pool?

365
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,281
Not before I throw
some truly fabulous parties

366
00:18:14,315 --> 00:18:16,183
at my tree house, sir.

367
00:18:17,452 --> 00:18:20,291
"Damn the torpedoes."
I like that.

368
00:18:21,239 --> 00:18:22,966
I can't believe the texture.

369
00:18:22,997 --> 00:18:24,658
You know genuine
when you feel it.

370
00:18:24,692 --> 00:18:25,992
Come on. This way.

371
00:18:26,026 --> 00:18:29,713
And this? I never thought
I could afford to replace Ted's.

372
00:18:29,764 --> 00:18:33,157
How can that man make a profit
selling a Rolex so cheaply?

373
00:18:33,258 --> 00:18:36,438
I'd say he got the "fell off a truck"
discount and passed it on thus.

374
00:18:36,571 --> 00:18:37,670
Hurry up. Graham's waiting.

375
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:39,678
You mean they're damaged?

376
00:18:40,186 --> 00:18:43,546
You didn't notice that nothing in
that stall was in its original box?

377
00:18:43,929 --> 00:18:45,489
Wait. They're stolen?

378
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:47,421
I bought a stolen watch?

379
00:18:47,467 --> 00:18:49,602
You want me to give
a stolen bag to my sister?

380
00:18:49,694 --> 00:18:52,130
It's not like we stole them.
Maggie.

381
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:54,929
Well, if we hadn't bought them,
someone else would have.

382
00:18:58,726 --> 00:19:00,296
Don't look guilty.

383
00:19:03,367 --> 00:19:04,834
Uh, so I-I figured, uh,

384
00:19:04,868 --> 00:19:07,003
right out of the gate
at the airport, go for it.

385
00:19:07,054 --> 00:19:08,137
She worked for, um,

386
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:09,460
A-Aerolinhas...

387
00:19:09,461 --> 00:19:12,004
Brasil...Eiras or something.

388
00:19:12,065 --> 00:19:13,584
Isn't that a cargo carrier?

389
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:15,134
That was my opening line.

390
00:19:15,173 --> 00:19:17,024
Oh, yeah. <i>"Ola, senhorita.</i>

391
00:19:17,082 --> 00:19:19,200
I would like to show you
my very heavy cargo."

392
00:19:19,297 --> 00:19:21,928
These Brazilian women...
They don't understand me.

393
00:19:21,982 --> 00:19:23,609
It's pitiful. It's pitiful.

394
00:19:23,644 --> 00:19:25,077
Captain Lowrey.

395
00:19:25,111 --> 00:19:26,512
You're right, Ginny.

396
00:19:26,546 --> 00:19:28,948
It is the good captain
and his merry crew.

397
00:19:29,755 --> 00:19:32,401
Miss Saddler. Mr. Henson.

398
00:19:32,453 --> 00:19:33,369
Good evening.

399
00:19:33,403 --> 00:19:35,485
Mr. Henson,
good to see you, sir.

400
00:19:35,524 --> 00:19:36,824
Good to see you, too,
Vanderwill.

401
00:19:36,858 --> 00:19:39,275
Vanderway. Or Ted.
Whichever.

402
00:19:39,455 --> 00:19:41,638
We thought you all might like
to join us for dinner.

403
00:19:42,122 --> 00:19:44,486
If you haven't eaten.
We're all here, right?

404
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,832
Well, I-I'm afraid
you're going to have to make do

405
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:49,249
with the good captain
and miss Valois. I have, uh...

406
00:19:49,309 --> 00:19:50,733
An assignation?

407
00:19:50,825 --> 00:19:53,253
You know these
Brazilian girls.

408
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:55,098
One strike left
with the bases loaded.

409
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:57,881
Well, swing away,
by all means, Vanderwick.

410
00:20:00,151 --> 00:20:01,952
Yeah.

411
00:20:04,101 --> 00:20:06,553
This is swell. Shall we?

412
00:20:15,946 --> 00:20:17,939
What if
they cut off our hands?

413
00:20:17,978 --> 00:20:20,446
We're in Rio,
not Saudi Arabia,

414
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,414
and we didn't steal
anything.

415
00:20:22,449 --> 00:20:24,416
Tell them that.
Tell them anything.

416
00:20:24,451 --> 00:20:26,018
You haven't said a word
in our defense.

417
00:20:26,052 --> 00:20:28,187
That's because there's
nothing to defend.

418
00:20:28,221 --> 00:20:30,723
They don't know our purchases
fell off a truck.

419
00:20:30,757 --> 00:20:33,392
Then why are we here?

420
00:20:33,426 --> 00:20:35,427
For whatever reason
they come up with.

421
00:20:35,462 --> 00:20:37,029
Loitering, probably.

422
00:20:37,388 --> 00:20:39,513
Loitering? We were shopping.

423
00:20:39,857 --> 00:20:41,666
We need to call Pan Am.

424
00:20:42,259 --> 00:20:43,269
Pan Am?

425
00:20:43,704 --> 00:20:46,949
Yes. Yes. Pan Am.
Hotel Intercontinental.

426
00:20:47,003 --> 00:20:49,415
Maggie, he obviously wants
to clear things up.

427
00:20:49,501 --> 00:20:52,151
He obviously wants a bribe.

428
00:20:52,605 --> 00:20:54,257
Look, this happens.

429
00:20:54,351 --> 00:20:56,952
They pull two girls
into the big, scary jail

430
00:20:56,987 --> 00:20:59,889
in the hopes of getting
a payoff.

431
00:20:59,923 --> 00:21:02,939
Well, it worked. I'm scared,
so let's pay them off.

432
00:21:03,426 --> 00:21:04,627
We don't have enough on us,

433
00:21:04,661 --> 00:21:06,662
and everybody we know
is out for the evening

434
00:21:06,696 --> 00:21:09,107
so if we just keep
our mouths shut,

435
00:21:09,426 --> 00:21:11,026
they'll let us go, okay?

436
00:21:11,237 --> 00:21:13,957
I am supposed to meet
the photographer and Mr. Henson

437
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,181
first thing in the morning.

438
00:21:15,261 --> 00:21:17,459
Go over there right now,
find out how much they want,

439
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:20,388
and then tell them we need to make
a long-distance call to New York.

440
00:21:20,428 --> 00:21:21,695
Kate can wire the money.

441
00:21:21,729 --> 00:21:22,979
I can't do that.
We...

442
00:21:23,014 --> 00:21:24,769
Maggie, I don't want
to spend the night in j...

443
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:27,467
I mean, I actually
can't do that.

444
00:21:28,321 --> 00:21:30,522
I don't speak Portuguese.

445
00:21:31,688 --> 00:21:33,988
But... but that's one of your languages.
I've heard you speak it.

446
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:35,165
A few words.

447
00:21:35,346 --> 00:21:38,106
I can tell officer Roberto
what a bad waitress he is,

448
00:21:38,127 --> 00:21:40,196
if you think that'll help.

449
00:21:42,617 --> 00:21:44,065
You're a fake.

450
00:21:44,565 --> 00:21:47,354
It was the best of semesters.

451
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:49,857
It was the worst of semesters.

452
00:21:50,277 --> 00:21:51,392
Yes, these grades are final.

453
00:21:51,439 --> 00:21:53,007
No, you may not question them,

454
00:21:53,029 --> 00:21:54,888
nor may you grovel.

455
00:21:54,992 --> 00:21:56,392
No hysterics.

456
00:21:56,578 --> 00:21:58,426
How about
dignified weeping?

457
00:21:58,512 --> 00:21:59,943
Jane Austen would not approve.

458
00:21:59,967 --> 00:22:01,300
But Jane Austen didn't
have to pull

459
00:22:01,335 --> 00:22:03,328
three all-nighters
before finals.

460
00:22:03,469 --> 00:22:05,103
I doubt miss Austen
would blanch

461
00:22:05,138 --> 00:22:07,306
at a little academic critique.

462
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:09,842
Why then, I wonder,
did she write under a pseudonym?

463
00:22:09,876 --> 00:22:12,278
Who in this class
would understand her motives

464
00:22:12,312 --> 00:22:15,394
better than you, <i>Roxanne?</i>

465
00:22:24,442 --> 00:22:26,576
You would have gotten an "A"
on the exam.

466
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:29,245
In fact, you did well
the whole term,

467
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,880
or rather...

468
00:22:30,915 --> 00:22:32,482
Somebody did well.

469
00:22:32,743 --> 00:22:34,048
It's my work.

470
00:22:34,173 --> 00:22:36,765
And you are whom? Roxanne?

471
00:22:37,664 --> 00:22:39,695
Susan? Marjorie?

472
00:22:39,976 --> 00:22:41,885
Did you really think
you could keep this up,

473
00:22:42,135 --> 00:22:45,491
sitting in on classes,
masquerading as other girls?

474
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:48,012
I was working
at the registrar's office.

475
00:22:48,129 --> 00:22:51,019
People kept dropping
these wonderful classes.

476
00:22:51,113 --> 00:22:53,578
All I did was pick them up.

477
00:22:53,704 --> 00:22:55,587
You're not even enrolled.

478
00:22:55,873 --> 00:22:58,575
You have any idea
how much trouble you're in?

479
00:22:59,672 --> 00:23:01,940
Gatsby, indeed.

480
00:23:05,356 --> 00:23:06,562
You're smart.

481
00:23:06,688 --> 00:23:09,423
You're a hard worker,
well-possessed.

482
00:23:09,457 --> 00:23:11,592
Make someone see that.

483
00:23:13,428 --> 00:23:15,195
To Pan American world airways.

484
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:17,597
- Pan American.
- Pan American.

485
00:23:17,615 --> 00:23:19,791
<i>LA meilleure compagnie aerienne</i>
<i>de tous Les temps.</i>

486
00:23:19,822 --> 00:23:21,785
Ooh. The best airline
that ever will be.

487
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:24,171
Mm. I didn't know
you spoke French.

488
00:23:24,205 --> 00:23:26,520
Oh, gosh, no.
What did I say?

489
00:23:27,208 --> 00:23:28,809
Almost exactly what I said.

490
00:23:30,621 --> 00:23:32,916
But you notice the difference, though?

491
00:23:33,788 --> 00:23:34,922
No accent.

492
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:37,708
That's why you're
a vice president.

493
00:23:39,193 --> 00:23:42,712
And you, captain,
are an excellent pilot,

494
00:23:43,292 --> 00:23:45,293
and there is nothing wrong
with that.

495
00:23:48,655 --> 00:23:49,699
To captain Lowrey.

496
00:23:49,718 --> 00:23:53,171
No, no, no, no, no.
To... to Air Force training.

497
00:23:53,634 --> 00:23:55,997
"Yes, sir!
No, sir! Right away, sir!"

498
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:58,752
All that authority crap. I would
have put a gun in my mouth.

499
00:23:58,908 --> 00:24:00,866
And yet you are authority.

500
00:24:01,998 --> 00:24:04,270
Everywhere
but in the cockpit.

501
00:24:05,511 --> 00:24:08,140
Ooh. I think
I've waited almost too long.

502
00:24:08,175 --> 00:24:10,145
I'm going
to the lite girls' room.

503
00:24:11,202 --> 00:24:12,745
I'll go with you.

504
00:24:12,779 --> 00:24:14,246
First, where is
that waiter?

505
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,867
I'm going to get us
some more eau-de-vie.

506
00:24:17,298 --> 00:24:18,369
That's French, right?

507
00:24:19,429 --> 00:24:20,458
<i>Oui.</i>

508
00:24:23,117 --> 00:24:24,766
- Be right back.
- Yeah.

509
00:24:28,224 --> 00:24:30,308
I don't know how
you handle the travel.

510
00:24:30,978 --> 00:24:32,944
Oh, you seem to travel
quite a lot.

511
00:24:32,979 --> 00:24:35,064
I don't know how the hell
I handle it.

512
00:24:35,673 --> 00:24:37,375
Well,
you know what they say.

513
00:24:37,423 --> 00:24:39,891
Plenty of water.

514
00:24:41,388 --> 00:24:42,880
No.

515
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,693
Plenty of Ginny.

516
00:24:47,179 --> 00:24:49,810
Oh, don't play confused
on me now, captain.

517
00:24:50,184 --> 00:24:52,373
I think we both know that Ginny is not my
secretary

518
00:24:52,475 --> 00:24:54,798
I... sir...wh..what...
two people do on their own..

519
00:24:54,814 --> 00:24:56,966
No, no, no. Don't call me "sir."
Call me Henson.

520
00:25:00,169 --> 00:25:03,380
Ginny is
over-the-rainbow wacky.

521
00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:04,901
And intoxicating.

522
00:25:04,936 --> 00:25:07,187
Um, I-I wouldn't, uh...

523
00:25:08,796 --> 00:25:11,008
She does
have a way about her.

524
00:25:12,555 --> 00:25:17,314
Most men wouldn't understand
why I... I love her,

525
00:25:18,008 --> 00:25:20,317
but you, captain,

526
00:25:21,046 --> 00:25:24,219
I'm guessing you are
a man who does.

527
00:25:30,407 --> 00:25:34,175
<i>With this faith,</i>
<i>we will be able to transform</i>

528
00:25:34,253 --> 00:25:36,300
<i>the jangling discords</i>
<i>of our nation</i>

529
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:39,136
<i>into a beautiful symphony</i>
<i>of brotherhood.</i>

530
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:42,205
<i>With this faith, we will be</i>
<i>able to work together,</i>

531
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,173
<i>to pray tog...</i>

532
00:25:43,472 --> 00:25:45,106
Excuse me.
We were watching that.

533
00:25:47,396 --> 00:25:48,712
Brave man.

534
00:25:49,989 --> 00:25:52,013
Reminds me of my cousin.

535
00:25:52,833 --> 00:25:55,858
Men like that don't live
too long in my country.

536
00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:00,079
It took a lot of years
to make that speech possible,

537
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:01,131
and even now...

538
00:26:01,179 --> 00:26:04,114
Yeah, but still,
so many people came to listen.

539
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:07,102
Here in... in America,
there is... there is hope.

540
00:26:07,262 --> 00:26:09,196
You don't have hope
for Yugoslavia?

541
00:26:10,638 --> 00:26:12,641
It... it is static...

542
00:26:14,834 --> 00:26:17,010
And worse, I'm static.

543
00:26:17,602 --> 00:26:19,402
I thought
Tito was making changes.

544
00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:24,448
Oh, changes, yeah,
but, uh, for the better?

545
00:26:25,712 --> 00:26:28,234
Where's the music?
We need some music.

546
00:26:29,437 --> 00:26:33,202
- You're choosing?
- Oh, I'm paying. You're choosing.

547
00:26:33,349 --> 00:26:36,184
Something new,
for a new day.

548
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:41,590
Okay. "Roy Orbison.
The Beach Boys. The Chiffons."

549
00:26:41,624 --> 00:26:43,670
Chime in.
You see anything you like?

550
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,328
"Walk like a man"?

551
00:26:46,362 --> 00:26:49,231
Oh, yeah.
Frankie Valli & the 4 Seasons.

552
00:26:49,265 --> 00:26:50,615
- Any good?
- It's really good.

553
00:26:50,666 --> 00:26:54,437
Okay, before I invest my nickel,
you tell me how it goes.

554
00:26:54,648 --> 00:26:56,076
I am not singing.

555
00:26:56,107 --> 00:26:58,486
Pay your money
and take your chances.

556
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,946
Should I take you home?

557
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,008
It seems like something's
bothering you.

558
00:27:14,748 --> 00:27:16,983
The people in that square...

559
00:27:17,544 --> 00:27:20,962
They face great risk
for what is right.

560
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,865
They walk like men.

561
00:27:25,934 --> 00:27:27,968
Niko, in my experience,
you know,

562
00:27:28,003 --> 00:27:31,172
life changes every minute.

563
00:27:31,768 --> 00:27:33,841
If there's something
you want to do,

564
00:27:33,875 --> 00:27:35,810
it's never too late.

565
00:27:43,901 --> 00:27:45,282
Dean.

566
00:27:46,728 --> 00:27:48,562
Dean, it's me.

567
00:27:53,628 --> 00:27:58,499
Dean, I'm so sorry.
It was such a stupid idea.

568
00:28:01,203 --> 00:28:02,770
Dean.

569
00:28:19,504 --> 00:28:21,405
This isn't necessary.

570
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:25,611
Necessary? You mean like
how fluency in Portuguese

571
00:28:25,645 --> 00:28:29,664
is necessary for stewardesses
who claim to speak it?

572
00:28:30,016 --> 00:28:32,451
You know, food must taste great
from a silver spoon...

573
00:28:32,485 --> 00:28:37,289
Necessary, so you can, say,
serve drinks, offer directions,

574
00:28:37,324 --> 00:28:39,391
or, I don't know,
talk your way

575
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:41,860
out of police precinct
in Rio de Janeiro?

576
00:28:42,612 --> 00:28:44,088
<i>Atencao.</i>

577
00:28:45,455 --> 00:28:50,133
<i>Eu gostaria de telefonar</i>

581
00:28:58,161 --> 00:28:59,495
Thank you.

<i>Nos gastariamos de pagar e...</i>

583
00:29:02,274 --> 00:29:04,125
Where's your photographer now?
Ted!

584
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,032
Oh, I'm just <i>dying</i> to know

585
00:29:08,212 --> 00:29:10,628
how you ladies pulled
this one off.

586
00:29:14,532 --> 00:29:17,079
Ah. There we go.

587
00:29:17,742 --> 00:29:20,390
I never thought I'd be able
to afford to replace yours.

588
00:29:20,421 --> 00:29:22,001
Oh, you didn't have
to do that.

589
00:29:22,035 --> 00:29:23,452
You were so sweet to...

590
00:29:23,487 --> 00:29:25,616
Okay, okay. Can you just
get us out of here?

591
00:29:25,662 --> 00:29:28,477
Just be grateful I happened
to be striking out

592
00:29:28,524 --> 00:29:30,543
at the hotel bar

593
00:29:30,574 --> 00:29:33,197
when these gentlemen called up

594
00:29:33,243 --> 00:29:36,999
asking to speak
to the Pan Am boss.

595
00:29:39,579 --> 00:29:41,213
<i>Suficiente?</i>

596
00:30:07,112 --> 00:30:10,637
Excuse me. Pan Am?
There you are.

597
00:30:10,638 --> 00:30:12,307
I'm Maggie Ryan.

598
00:30:13,084 --> 00:30:14,418
I'm sorry, miss Ryan.

599
00:30:14,452 --> 00:30:16,191
The interviews
were from 3:00 to 6:00.

600
00:30:16,282 --> 00:30:19,384
Oh, please! I-I came
all the way from Tacoma.

601
00:30:19,612 --> 00:30:21,592
I'm afraid
we've found our girls.

602
00:30:21,626 --> 00:30:23,277
Well, I would have made it
on time

603
00:30:23,311 --> 00:30:24,995
if it weren't for the accident.

604
00:30:25,358 --> 00:30:27,920
A logging truck...
The bindings came loose,

605
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:30,073
and timber
was raining from the sky,

606
00:30:30,496 --> 00:30:33,064
and I had to stay
until the ambulances came.

607
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:34,938
You would be surprised
how few people know how

608
00:30:34,973 --> 00:30:37,295
to staunch the flow of blood.

609
00:30:37,389 --> 00:30:38,909
Well,
that's very impressive.

610
00:30:38,943 --> 00:30:40,077
But as I'm sure you're aware,

611
00:30:40,111 --> 00:30:42,012
the Pan Am stewardess is,
over all things...

612
00:30:42,047 --> 00:30:43,180
Cultured.

613
00:30:43,721 --> 00:30:46,829
I've had my heart
broken twice, mister...

614
00:30:47,027 --> 00:30:48,027
Claymore.

615
00:30:48,061 --> 00:30:49,895
Once by a boy named Chip

616
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:53,566
and once by a man named
F. Scott Fitzgerald.

617
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,006
And I wasn't even
an English major.

618
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:58,865
World history...
That's my passion.

619
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:02,005
My transcript, hot off

620
00:31:02,042 --> 00:31:05,144
the presses of the Berkeley's
registrar's office.

621
00:31:05,178 --> 00:31:06,345
I saw to it myself.

622
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:08,466
Well, you've got gumption,
miss Ryan.

623
00:31:08,513 --> 00:31:10,787
And poise, Mr. Claymore...

624
00:31:10,865 --> 00:31:13,119
That Pan Am poise.

625
00:31:13,153 --> 00:31:17,890
I did a stint modeling
the latest fashions from Paris.

626
00:31:18,671 --> 00:31:22,161
But the thing that irks me
about modeling...

627
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:24,797
What really riles me...

628
00:31:25,409 --> 00:31:26,784
That it's all about the body

629
00:31:26,909 --> 00:31:29,635
and nothing at all
to do with the brain.

630
00:31:30,369 --> 00:31:33,663
I think women should be
acknowledged for their brain.

631
00:31:33,803 --> 00:31:35,844
I-I see you took some Spanish.
Hmm.

632
00:31:35,883 --> 00:31:38,564
Unfortunately, we have a surplus
of Spanish speakers.

633
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,871
<i>Limpar a bagunca</i>
<i>na mesa nove?</i>

634
00:31:42,129 --> 00:31:44,000
- Catalan?
- Portuguese.

635
00:31:44,546 --> 00:31:46,824
- You're fluent?
- Here's thing.

636
00:31:47,165 --> 00:31:50,551
I've been training
my whole life for this job.

637
00:31:50,585 --> 00:31:53,921
I know both elbow grease
and elocution.

638
00:31:53,955 --> 00:31:57,656
But I think the most important
thing for a Pan Am stewardess

639
00:31:57,871 --> 00:32:00,373
is that she be good company
for the journey

640
00:32:00,533 --> 00:32:02,650
and a fast friend.

641
00:32:32,943 --> 00:32:33,926
I'm sorry for that.

642
00:32:33,961 --> 00:32:37,429
No, I hate to see you
this upset.

643
00:32:37,448 --> 00:32:39,964
My cousin has been put
on a show trial.

644
00:32:39,988 --> 00:32:41,448
You know what that is?

645
00:32:42,505 --> 00:32:45,172
It's a favorite practice
of Tito's regime.

646
00:32:45,478 --> 00:32:48,748
The defendant has little-to-no
opportunity to justify himself.

647
00:32:48,818 --> 00:32:52,854
My cousin... he was forced to sign
a statement under duress.

648
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:54,255
He was tortured?

649
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:56,324
He'll be found guilty.

650
00:32:56,358 --> 00:32:58,620
I must go to Belgrade
and do what I can.

651
00:32:58,729 --> 00:33:00,698
But what about Zagreb
and your family?

652
00:33:00,722 --> 00:33:01,955
It'll have to wait.

653
00:33:02,815 --> 00:33:04,488
Niko, are you in danger?

654
00:33:04,522 --> 00:33:07,054
Tito has put an entire nation
in danger.

655
00:33:07,691 --> 00:33:10,229
"Chief architect"
of the "second Yugoslavia,"

656
00:33:10,931 --> 00:33:13,132
and yet his dreams
are not for his people.

657
00:33:16,734 --> 00:33:18,301
I must go and try
to help my cousin.

658
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:20,603
This might be the last time
I'll ever see him again.

659
00:33:20,621 --> 00:33:22,339
Niko...

660
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,307
My mind is full of you,
too.

661
00:33:52,972 --> 00:33:56,007
Maggie, those cops were lucky
ere wasn't a fork around.

662
00:33:56,025 --> 00:33:57,776
Don't start in on me, okay?

663
00:33:57,810 --> 00:34:00,262
I know. You warned me before,
and I didn't listen.

664
00:34:00,296 --> 00:34:03,682
Whoa. That was me saying hi.

665
00:34:03,716 --> 00:34:06,268
You girls did your time,
paid your debt to society.

666
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:08,487
Tell that
to the base manager.

667
00:34:08,521 --> 00:34:10,122
I thought we kept him
out of this.

668
00:34:10,156 --> 00:34:12,290
Not the one in Rio, Ted.

669
00:34:12,325 --> 00:34:15,377
You mean New York?
You mean that base manager?

670
00:34:19,728 --> 00:34:21,029
Ted...

671
00:34:21,208 --> 00:34:24,606
I disagree with your politics,
your attitude toward women,

672
00:34:24,703 --> 00:34:29,084
and, well...
You as a person in general,

673
00:34:29,264 --> 00:34:33,167
but... you show up.
You come through,

674
00:34:33,201 --> 00:34:36,439
and not everything does that,
so...

675
00:34:37,829 --> 00:34:39,324
Thank you.

676
00:34:40,358 --> 00:34:42,392
Maggie, what is going on?

677
00:34:42,981 --> 00:34:44,816
Maggie?

678
00:34:56,827 --> 00:35:00,379
Are you sure you don't need
a few more plane photos?

679
00:35:00,414 --> 00:35:01,681
I have plenty.

680
00:35:01,715 --> 00:35:04,650
I didn't mean to abandon you
at the beach, honest.

681
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:08,254
Well, even coco chanel only
stood me up for three hours.

682
00:35:08,288 --> 00:35:09,876
You shot Coco Chanel?

683
00:35:09,916 --> 00:35:13,819
Almost. She, uh, ran off
with an alligator bag.

684
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:19,832
I don't suppose
I could make it up to you.

685
00:35:20,255 --> 00:35:21,833
I could make you a list.

686
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:24,521
I'll get you a pen.

687
00:35:32,891 --> 00:35:34,769
Oh.
Sorry.

688
00:35:45,391 --> 00:35:47,859
Mr. Henson,
can I offer you anything?

689
00:35:47,894 --> 00:35:49,895
No, thank you. I'm fine.

690
00:35:50,632 --> 00:35:53,195
Then maybe you can help me
with something.

691
00:35:55,167 --> 00:35:56,835
If a girl
was to find herself

692
00:35:56,869 --> 00:35:59,838
in a little bind
with the airline,

693
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:01,617
would you be in a position

694
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:04,597
to perhaps put in a good word?

695
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:07,128
I don't get involved in personal
issues, if that's what you mean.

696
00:36:07,162 --> 00:36:10,436
It wasn't even
a serious infraction.

697
00:36:10,841 --> 00:36:13,298
I can't help you. Sorry.

698
00:36:14,703 --> 00:36:17,730
Well... thank you anyway.

699
00:36:23,278 --> 00:36:25,096
Did Graham get all
the shots he needed?

700
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:27,513
I owe him some time
in New York.

701
00:36:28,388 --> 00:36:30,151
Well, I'm sure
it'll be fine.

702
00:36:30,169 --> 00:36:32,603
You'll be
the model stewardess.

703
00:36:32,638 --> 00:36:35,123
Well, that's funny,
coming from you.

704
00:36:37,026 --> 00:36:38,791
I already apologized.

705
00:36:39,361 --> 00:36:42,379
In what language?
Portuguese?

706
00:36:43,695 --> 00:36:46,865
I didn't hear anything
that sounded like an apology.

707
00:36:51,917 --> 00:36:54,876
No one ever had
any expectations of me.

708
00:36:55,897 --> 00:36:58,016
Never thought
I could get anywhere...

709
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,435
Not my family,
not my friends.

710
00:37:02,516 --> 00:37:05,739
But for some reason, I did.

711
00:37:06,353 --> 00:37:09,555
Even though I didn't know
where "anywhere" was

712
00:37:09,652 --> 00:37:11,786
or how I would find it.

713
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:15,878
Yet here I am.
I made a new me.

714
00:37:16,011 --> 00:37:17,942
I took a lot of shortcuts,

715
00:37:18,231 --> 00:37:21,183
I told more than a few fibs.

716
00:37:21,331 --> 00:37:24,440
Every time I got caught,
I moved on.

717
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:27,336
Each close call was
a stepping-stone

718
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,811
to something better.

719
00:37:29,897 --> 00:37:33,310
But this time,
there is nothing better.

720
00:37:34,135 --> 00:37:35,869
This is it.

721
00:37:35,903 --> 00:37:37,835
I can't lose Pan Am.

722
00:37:38,372 --> 00:37:39,990
Why would you lose it?

723
00:37:44,894 --> 00:37:46,628
The truth is,

724
00:37:46,663 --> 00:37:49,598
I admire you
more than you know.

725
00:37:49,632 --> 00:37:51,766
And I'm sorry, Laura.

726
00:38:09,544 --> 00:38:12,702
He was flying to Zagreb,
but he changed his plans.

727
00:38:13,031 --> 00:38:14,767
Belgrade.

728
00:38:15,474 --> 00:38:17,638
His cousin's on
"show trial" there.

729
00:38:17,898 --> 00:38:19,727
Anything else?

730
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:22,640
He's not a communist.

731
00:38:22,674 --> 00:38:25,206
They don't all carry cards,
you know.

732
00:38:26,545 --> 00:38:28,946
He hates Tito,
admires Martin Luther King,

733
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:32,850
and he even likes
Frankie Valli & the 4 Seasons.

734
00:38:32,884 --> 00:38:34,652
The part about Tito
is interesting.

735
00:38:34,686 --> 00:38:38,152
He said that Tito's dreams
were not for his people.

736
00:38:38,711 --> 00:38:40,647
Daring words
for a diplomat.

737
00:38:40,831 --> 00:38:42,465
He must trust you.

738
00:38:44,058 --> 00:38:45,325
He shouldn't.

739
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:48,084
Sounds like he's working
for the wrong people.

740
00:38:50,538 --> 00:38:52,276
Is that what this is about?

741
00:38:52,277 --> 00:38:54,207
You want him to spy for you?

742
00:38:54,241 --> 00:38:55,508
For us.

743
00:38:55,543 --> 00:38:57,277
You'll have
to tread lightly.

744
00:38:57,311 --> 00:39:00,881
Turning a target into an asset
is about patience and control.

745
00:39:00,915 --> 00:39:03,274
For now, just keep
building on that trust.

746
00:39:03,275 --> 00:39:04,646
You want me to turn him?

747
00:39:04,771 --> 00:39:06,780
Welcome to the big leagues.

748
00:39:07,295 --> 00:39:09,023
Richard, no.

749
00:39:10,731 --> 00:39:13,669
I'm a-a courier, remember?
I... this is...

750
00:39:14,302 --> 00:39:15,735
I can't do this.

751
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,737
With the way Niko feels
about Tito,

752
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:20,163
how long do you think
he's going to last?

753
00:39:33,933 --> 00:39:35,300
Dean.

754
00:39:37,351 --> 00:39:38,651
Everett's inside.
It's fine.

755
00:39:38,702 --> 00:39:41,938
Ginny, let's give this
a few days.

756
00:39:46,877 --> 00:39:48,434
You were right.

757
00:39:49,138 --> 00:39:50,794
Rio was...

758
00:39:51,482 --> 00:39:55,084
<i>I</i> was the accident
waiting to happen.

759
00:39:56,346 --> 00:39:57,647
And the dinner... I'm...

760
00:39:58,797 --> 00:40:00,365
I'm sorry that I put you
through that.

761
00:40:00,399 --> 00:40:01,644
I know you are, but...

762
00:40:01,645 --> 00:40:04,135
But this is not the
time to talk about it.

763
00:40:05,604 --> 00:40:07,238
I don't... I don't wanna
sneak around anymore.

764
00:40:07,272 --> 00:40:08,192
Neither do I.

765
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,856
I don't... I don't wanna
pretend anymore.

766
00:40:09,967 --> 00:40:12,065
I can't pretend anymore,
Dean.

767
00:40:14,413 --> 00:40:16,005
Not when
I've fallen in love.

768
00:40:30,095 --> 00:40:31,642
Margaret.

769
00:40:32,697 --> 00:40:34,926
Margaret, before you go,

770
00:40:34,965 --> 00:40:37,351
the base manager's
expecting you in his office.

771
00:40:37,407 --> 00:40:40,592
- Already? Now?
- I'm sorry.

772
00:40:45,864 --> 00:40:47,154
Margaret?

773
00:40:47,334 --> 00:40:48,576
Now.

774
00:40:50,065 --> 00:40:53,471
Okay, um, tell him
I'll be there in a minute.

775
00:40:59,208 --> 00:41:02,413
Mr. Henson, I hate
to bother you again,

776
00:41:02,447 --> 00:41:05,388
but if you would reconsider
helping me out...

777
00:41:05,443 --> 00:41:07,328
I already told you,
I don't get involved in...

778
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:10,242
What if I returned
the favor?

779
00:41:10,316 --> 00:41:12,417
Saving your job
is more than a favor.

780
00:41:12,451 --> 00:41:13,985
What if I could tell you
something

781
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:16,087
about someone
you're very close to?

782
00:41:33,247 --> 00:41:34,448
Miss Havemeyer.

783
00:41:34,482 --> 00:41:36,917
Miss Ryan, I heard
you made a new friend

784
00:41:36,951 --> 00:41:38,609
on your flight home
from Brazil.

785
00:41:38,661 --> 00:41:40,962
I try to make friends
wherever I go.

786
00:41:41,491 --> 00:41:42,795
I can only imagine.

787
00:41:54,009 --> 00:41:58,552
<i>Bem-vindo.</i>
<i>Como eu posso o ajudar?</i>

788
00:41:59,064 --> 00:42:01,715
