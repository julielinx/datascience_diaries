1
00:00:01,399 --> 00:00:03,119
Previously on "Pan Am".

2
00:00:03,251 --> 00:00:04,571
MI6 will want answers.

3
00:00:04,638 --> 00:00:06,372
I have to take
a lie detector test?

4
00:00:06,406 --> 00:00:09,308
You have a dead body
on their hands, Kate.

5
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:12,011
You're not begging
to come upstairs?

6
00:00:12,045 --> 00:00:13,712
Some things
are worth waiting for.

7
00:00:13,746 --> 00:00:15,347
You're trying
to distract me.

8
00:00:15,381 --> 00:00:18,117
I'm trying to tell you...
I like you.

9
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:21,437
- I have to talk to you.
- Can it wait?

10
00:00:21,471 --> 00:00:23,822
Hello, Dean.

11
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,925
It is you and me, Colette.
That's all that matters.

12
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:27,059
I've always loved you.

13
00:00:34,668 --> 00:00:37,920
I don't think I've ever seen
a morning more beautiful.

14
00:00:40,106 --> 00:00:41,674
Penny for your thoughts?

15
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:45,277
En route to Rome last June...

16
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:47,346
During our layover,

17
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:53,252
I saw you come out of the hotel
with a man in a gray suit.

18
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:54,853
So I'm guessing
that he was...

19
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,355
A handler from MI6.

20
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:59,992
Part of my mission there.

21
00:01:00,026 --> 00:01:02,027
And Paris...

22
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,396
You left me at dinner
and told me you had the flu.

23
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:06,899
I had to sneak away
to make a drop.

24
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:09,401
So everything...

25
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:10,803
Everything
I didn't understand

26
00:01:10,837 --> 00:01:14,573
was because you were a spy,
and I was in the dark.

27
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:15,808
Not everything.

28
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:20,580
Women are conundrums,
even when they aren't spies.

29
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:24,450
How about the reason
you called off our engagement?

30
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,837
I didn't know how I was
supposed to be your wife

31
00:01:28,872 --> 00:01:30,789
when I had to...

32
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:32,625
What,
when you had to lie to me?

33
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:40,549
Keep my cover, Dean.

34
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,639
But that's over.

35
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:50,042
I'm free of MI6.
We can be together.

36
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:52,044
Who is "we," Bridget?

37
00:01:52,062 --> 00:01:53,946
The woman I thought
I knew,

38
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,682
who I loved...
She was fiction.

39
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:57,883
No.

40
00:01:57,917 --> 00:02:00,085
The woman who fell
in love with you... she was real.

41
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,121
And then... and then
you're just... you're gone.

42
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:03,756
You left,

43
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,158
and I was forced to move on.

44
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:08,327
To Colette?

45
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:13,782
Well...

46
00:02:13,817 --> 00:02:16,101
You have to admit,
last night was wonderful.

47
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,870
And a mistake.

48
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,840
It was my mistake.

49
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:28,914
I never stopped
loving you, Dean.

50
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:32,134
And I want to be
your wife.

51
00:02:32,168 --> 00:02:34,520
The question is,
what do you want?

52
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:40,793
Hello?

53
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,961
Yeah,
this is captain Lowrey.

54
00:02:42,979 --> 00:02:45,798
Uh... yeah.

55
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,367
I-I can get on the next flight
out of Heathrow.

56
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:53,405
Of course. Let... let him know
that I'll be there.

57
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,741
Uh, bye, now.

58
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:58,911
I gotta get to New York.

59
00:02:58,913 --> 00:03:00,879
You seen my cuff link?

60
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:02,715
Is everything all right?

61
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:04,350
Yeah, uh...

62
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:06,819
Juan Trippe requested
a meeting with me

63
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,670
in New York. Tomorrow.

64
00:03:08,705 --> 00:03:10,422
- Juan Trippe?
- Yeah.

65
00:03:10,457 --> 00:03:13,692
What does he want?

66
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:14,927
I don't know.

67
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:21,850
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
So let me get this straight...

68
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:23,202
The... the chairman
of Pan Am

69
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:26,271
just flew you back to New York
for a private meeting?

70
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:27,256
That's right.

71
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,425
What'd he say?

72
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:30,926
Apparently Khrushchev
and Kennedy

73
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:33,178
have opened a hotline.
The cold war's thawing.

74
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:35,531
Mr. Trippe wants Pan Am to be
the first Western airline

75
00:03:35,565 --> 00:03:37,616
- to fly...
- Wait. To the Soviet union?

76
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:38,884
Yeah. He wants to open
a new route,

77
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:39,951
so he's sending
a diplomatic mission.

78
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:40,819
Morning. How are you?

79
00:03:40,854 --> 00:03:42,454
To <i>the</i> Soviet union?

80
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:43,855
That's what he said.

81
00:03:44,874 --> 00:03:46,759
Well, how come you get to go
and I don't?

82
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:48,977
- That he didn't say.
- Ugh!

83
00:03:49,012 --> 00:03:50,662
You know what this means,
don't you?

84
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:52,898
You're Trippe's ace,
the new face of the jet age.

85
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:53,379
Doubtful.

86
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,167
Next thing you know, he'll
name the airline after you.

87
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:56,135
Highly doubtful.

88
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,271
Well, if I don't get
the U.S.S.R.,

89
00:03:59,289 --> 00:04:03,008
I'm making the best
of my time off.

90
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:08,480
How much "yes" you think
a karat will give me?

91
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:10,099
How much "yes" from who?

92
00:04:10,133 --> 00:04:11,316
What do you mean, "who"?

93
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:12,484
Amanda.

94
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:15,754
Wait, this is the girl
your parents set you up with?

95
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:17,256
- Uh-huh.
- A month ago?

96
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,057
- Thought you hated her.
- Ohh.

97
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,859
When you know, you know.

98
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:23,128
And you know?

99
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:24,129
I do!

100
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:25,864
Oh. Does <i>she?</i>

101
00:04:25,882 --> 00:04:28,734
That's what I aim
to find out.

102
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,602
Just gotta pick
the right moment.

103
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,338
I guess we're both
on a mission.

104
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:39,678
What,
you don't like onions?

105
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,216
Onions?

106
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,586
In your eggs?
Congressman?

107
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,754
I'm sorry.

108
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,656
I like them better than
I like the "Village voice,"

109
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:51,590
I'll tell you that.

110
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:52,925
You're still fixated?

111
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:58,964
On this worthless piece of
yellow journalism? Yes. Quite.

112
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:01,767
"Despite insisting
he's a republican to the core,

113
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,702
"an anonymous source
close to the congressman

114
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:05,904
"claims Rawlings'
public policy stances

115
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:07,689
don't match
his private beliefs."

116
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,674
Eggs.

117
00:05:09,692 --> 00:05:10,659
Eat.

118
00:05:10,693 --> 00:05:11,610
It's the "Voice."

119
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,929
What do you care
what they think, anyway?

120
00:05:13,963 --> 00:05:16,949
I don't, but I also don't
appreciate sources

121
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,551
with inside knowledge
conspiring with the enemy.

122
00:05:19,586 --> 00:05:21,920
Aren't you
"conspiring with the enemy"

123
00:05:21,955 --> 00:05:23,489
when you're with me?

124
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:25,891
I don't consider you
the enemy.

125
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:27,576
Oh. What am I, then?

126
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:30,295
You're
an important constituent

127
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,698
with an interesting world view...

128
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:35,534
And, uh...
Something on her lip.

129
00:05:35,552 --> 00:05:37,302
On my lip?

130
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:38,437
Yeah.

131
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:41,773
Cute.

132
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:43,342
Yes, you are.

133
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:47,346
Which is why I think
it's time to show you off.

134
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:50,199
I'm having a cocktail party
for some wealthy donors.

135
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,317
Be my date.

136
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:58,891
What am I supposed to do,
just sit on your arm,

137
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:00,292
all quiet and docile?

138
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:01,460
You're supposed to be
your smart,

139
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:04,162
opinionated,
wonderful self.

140
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,398
Hey. Come on.

141
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:08,901
Consider it
your coming out party.

142
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:10,903
It'll be fun.

143
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:28,287
Oh, my God,
Richard!

144
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:30,055
You didn't answer my knock.

145
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:32,691
That doesn't mean
that you can let yourself in.

146
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:34,793
I deserve
that much privacy.

147
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:37,696
Not anymore. You're in with us
all the way now.

148
00:06:37,714 --> 00:06:39,798
You knew I'd be stopping by
sooner or later.

149
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:41,967
We're going to Russia.

150
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:44,236
Of course
you'd be stopping by.

151
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,405
One of our double agents
has gone silent.

152
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:48,974
Code name... Anastasia.

153
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:52,177
Girlfriend of
a high-ranking KGB official.

154
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:55,847
She lives not far from the hotel
where you'll be staying.

155
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:03,555
Six months ago,
I was a courier.

156
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,375
And now you want me to pull
this woman out of Russia?

157
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,427
Go to her building.
If she's still in the game,

158
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:10,662
there'll be a potted sunflower
in her window.

159
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:14,333
Confirm Anastasia is active
and alive,

160
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:16,068
and we'll do the rest.

161
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:19,354
Oh. How very magnanimous.

162
00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:21,857
Be careful.

163
00:07:21,891 --> 00:07:25,344
You're going to Moscow...
The beating heart of communism.

164
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:28,380
You get made for a spy there,
you don't ever come back.

165
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,618
Enjoy the motherland.

166
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,958
- Pan Am -
Ep. 11 - Diplomatic relations

Sync and corrected by dr.jackson
for www.addic7ed.com

168
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:53,338
Hello, stranger.

169
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:54,640
Colette. Hey.

170
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,510
I'm really sorry we didn't get
to connect before I left London.

171
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:01,880
Oh, that's all right.
Gave me a chance to think.

172
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:05,418
And... have you?

173
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:09,387
I'm still afraid of what
Bridget's return means

174
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:11,356
for you and I.

175
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:15,694
But for the first time
in my life,

176
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:18,830
I'm not going to let my fear
get the better of me.

177
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,101
I want to be with you...

178
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:26,471
As terrifying as that is.

179
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,807
- I just hope...
- No, no, no.

180
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:31,009
I-I do. I want
to be with you, too.

181
00:08:34,964 --> 00:08:37,049
I'm so sorry. I need to...

182
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,467
- Oh, brief the crew.
- Right.

183
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,686
Of course. But... but when we
get to Russia, can we...

184
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:41,820
Talk more?

185
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,522
- Yeah.
- Please.

186
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:47,325
I'll see you soon.

187
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:48,860
Yeah.

188
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:57,619
Hi.

189
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,441
Our every move
will be watched,

190
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:05,243
literally, by the Russians.

191
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:07,379
So be careful
about what you say,

192
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:08,914
about what you do,

193
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:11,550
about who you choose
to talk to.

194
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:15,620
That said,
this is an historic flight.

195
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,005
It's an opportunity
to trail-blaze

196
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:19,091
not only a new route
for Pan Am,

197
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,860
but ongoing relationship
with the Soviets.

198
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,628
Which is why we damn well
better not

199
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:24,813
foul this thing up, right?

200
00:09:24,847 --> 00:09:26,598
Sorry for the dramatic entrance,

201
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:27,866
but why sneak in
with the ground force

202
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,434
when you can soar in
on the Enola Gay

203
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:30,736
and drop the bomb?

204
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:33,438
All right. The plan...

205
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:35,073
Wheels up at 1600.

206
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:36,858
Then ten hours to Moscow,

207
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:39,144
where our job will be
to spend four days

208
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:41,413
showing the Russian bear
the majesty,

209
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:43,849
the beauty,
and the good graces

210
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:45,350
of the American eagle.

211
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:47,986
If all goes well,
you can tell your grandkids

212
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,055
that you were the crew
that got Russia for Juan Trippe.

213
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,091
Excuse me.

214
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:55,327
Dean Lowrey,
boy wonder, right?

215
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:57,095
- That's me.
- I'm George Broyles.

216
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,498
Captain Broyles.

217
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:00,665
Well, it's damn nice to meet

218
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,067
and glad you'll be holding down
my right seat.

219
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,018
I'm sorry... your right seat?

220
00:10:03,052 --> 00:10:05,403
Or left seat.
I'll flip you for it.

221
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:06,638
As for the rest of you,

222
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:07,672
we'll have plenty of time
to chew the fat

223
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:09,691
over the vast Atlantic,
all right?

224
00:10:09,725 --> 00:10:11,910
Two hours to takeoff,
my friends.

225
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:15,730
Who is that?

226
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:17,616
Oh, that's a sky God.

227
00:10:34,452 --> 00:10:37,253
What exactly is
a sky God?

228
00:10:37,288 --> 00:10:39,622
World War II pilots.
Big heroes.

229
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,258
Broyles flew a dozen
bomber runs over Berlin.

230
00:10:42,293 --> 00:10:45,528
Mr. Trippe gives him
and his kind carte blanche

231
00:10:45,563 --> 00:10:47,630
to use the airline
whenever they like,

232
00:10:47,665 --> 00:10:49,733
however they like.

233
00:10:57,074 --> 00:11:01,244
Fuel at 43 degrees West
will be 138,000 pounds.

234
00:11:05,616 --> 00:11:07,317
You guys always insist
on having Russians

235
00:11:07,351 --> 00:11:08,918
aboard these flights
into Moscow?

236
00:11:08,953 --> 00:11:11,187
Safety measure.
For Americans.

237
00:11:11,222 --> 00:11:12,989
So we don't crash
into the Kremlin.

238
00:11:23,801 --> 00:11:25,101
Ivan's not so bad.

239
00:11:25,136 --> 00:11:28,321
That's nice to know.

240
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:37,981
Your sister Laura seems nice.

241
00:11:38,015 --> 00:11:42,252
We're all happy to have you
back and safe, Bridget.

242
00:11:42,286 --> 00:11:43,987
We have hardly any assets...

243
00:11:44,021 --> 00:11:46,055
In the Soviet Union,

244
00:11:46,107 --> 00:11:49,059
no eyes on the ground to know
what Khrushchev is up to.

245
00:11:49,093 --> 00:11:51,895
This is a huge opportunity.

246
00:11:51,929 --> 00:11:53,613
Are you working?

247
00:11:53,664 --> 00:11:55,265
Bridget, you know I can't.

248
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:58,384
Talk about it. I know.

249
00:11:58,436 --> 00:12:00,904
Oh, it's just so odd...

250
00:12:00,938 --> 00:12:01,905
Being on the outside again.

251
00:12:01,939 --> 00:12:04,841
The silence is deafening.

252
00:12:09,713 --> 00:12:13,283
I take it Juan didn't tell you
I was coming along for the ride.

253
00:12:13,317 --> 00:12:16,152
No. <i>Juan</i> didn't.

254
00:12:18,289 --> 00:12:20,323
That's his style.

255
00:12:20,357 --> 00:12:23,726
Wants to keep us all
on our tips, you know?

256
00:12:25,729 --> 00:12:27,730
Look,
it's a compliment, Lowrey,

257
00:12:27,765 --> 00:12:29,482
him choosing you and me.

258
00:12:29,533 --> 00:12:30,967
Juan knows if he wants
to invade Russia,

259
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:32,936
he's got to send in
the big guns.

260
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:34,304
Well, just do me the favor
of not shooting me

261
00:12:34,338 --> 00:12:36,172
in the back, will ya?

262
00:12:42,613 --> 00:12:44,280
Do you think we'll get
to see Red Square

263
00:12:44,314 --> 00:12:46,182
or Lenin's tomb?

264
00:12:58,295 --> 00:13:00,196
This must be hard for you,

265
00:13:00,231 --> 00:13:04,067
stuck on a 10-hour flight
with Dean's ex-fiancee.

266
00:13:05,035 --> 00:13:06,569
You've heard?

267
00:13:06,604 --> 00:13:09,272
Oh, rumors...

268
00:13:09,306 --> 00:13:11,541
And I saw you two talking
in operations.

269
00:13:11,575 --> 00:13:13,510
You know,
it seemed intimate.

270
00:13:17,832 --> 00:13:19,682
Is it true?

271
00:13:19,717 --> 00:13:22,235
I won't say it's not.

272
00:13:25,523 --> 00:13:28,791
Have you talked to her...
Bridget?

273
00:13:28,826 --> 00:13:31,494
No, not yet.

274
00:13:31,529 --> 00:13:34,130
Uh, we were friends.

275
00:13:34,165 --> 00:13:36,299
We were close friends.

276
00:13:38,469 --> 00:13:40,436
You didn't do
anything wrong.

277
00:13:51,315 --> 00:13:52,916
Let me help.

278
00:13:53,817 --> 00:13:55,485
Thank you.

279
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,354
I haven't quite got
my rhythm back.

280
00:13:58,372 --> 00:14:00,773
Speaking of rhythm,

281
00:14:00,808 --> 00:14:04,527
I hope yours and mine won't be
too badly affected by...

282
00:14:04,562 --> 00:14:05,962
You and Dean?

283
00:14:09,233 --> 00:14:10,900
I thought...

284
00:14:10,935 --> 00:14:12,902
Well, we all thought
you had gotten married.

285
00:14:12,937 --> 00:14:14,437
If I had known
that wasn't the truth,

286
00:14:14,455 --> 00:14:15,772
I would have never...

287
00:14:15,806 --> 00:14:17,640
I know.

288
00:14:17,675 --> 00:14:19,642
Dean told me
all about you two.

289
00:14:19,677 --> 00:14:22,912
When you had drinks
in London?

290
00:14:22,947 --> 00:14:24,747
Yes.

291
00:14:24,782 --> 00:14:26,082
Yes. Drinks.

292
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,718
Dean and I... we spent
a long time talking,

293
00:14:28,752 --> 00:14:31,321
and don't worry, Colette.

294
00:14:31,355 --> 00:14:34,190
I shall respect whatever
Dean decides to do.

295
00:14:58,849 --> 00:14:59,849
I've been calling.

296
00:14:59,867 --> 00:15:02,535
And I've been hanging up.

297
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:04,337
Don't be a child.

298
00:15:04,371 --> 00:15:07,307
You're the one
who took what I wrote

299
00:15:07,358 --> 00:15:09,859
and twisted it for
your stupid "Voice" article.

300
00:15:09,893 --> 00:15:11,594
How exactly did I twist it?

301
00:15:11,612 --> 00:15:14,897
Yes, I have issues
with some of Chris's beliefs,

302
00:15:14,932 --> 00:15:16,716
but to say that he's
a hypocrite...

303
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,968
"Chris"?
Well, you two are cozy.

304
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:22,138
That he doesn't actually
<i>hold</i> these beliefs

305
00:15:22,156 --> 00:15:24,090
is not what I meant.

306
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:25,408
Which means he's more
of a warmonger

307
00:15:25,442 --> 00:15:26,676
than I made him out to be?

308
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:29,012
Take a hike, Mike.

309
00:15:29,046 --> 00:15:31,097
I don't understand
what's going on here, Mags.

310
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:33,116
You know, one minute
you want to destroy the man,

311
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:35,218
and the next
you're on a first-name basis

312
00:15:35,252 --> 00:15:37,136
with the biggest death merchant
in congress.

313
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:39,355
Wh...

314
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:41,591
You're sleeping with him,
aren't you?

315
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:44,861
Well, I'm not sleeping
with you anymore, Mike,

316
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:48,064
so other than that,
it's none of your damn business.

317
00:15:48,098 --> 00:15:49,598
Unbelievable. You...

318
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:51,200
Well, I-I just came by
to warn you that

319
00:15:51,235 --> 00:15:53,069
the congressman's staff
is obsessed

320
00:15:53,103 --> 00:15:55,655
with uncovering the source
for my article.

321
00:15:55,706 --> 00:15:58,574
Are you threatening
to tell them it's me?

322
00:15:58,609 --> 00:16:00,443
I just came by
to give you a heads-up

323
00:16:00,477 --> 00:16:01,711
that they're not stopping

324
00:16:01,745 --> 00:16:03,479
until they figure out
who the rat is.

325
00:16:03,514 --> 00:16:04,881
Other than that,

326
00:16:04,915 --> 00:16:07,633
enjoy your life,
future Mrs. Congressman.

327
00:16:20,785 --> 00:16:23,320
Pan American World Airways,

328
00:16:23,355 --> 00:16:25,589
we welcome you to Moscow.

329
00:16:25,624 --> 00:16:27,024
I am Olga Dubovik,

330
00:16:27,058 --> 00:16:30,761
representative of Committee
of Diplomatic Relations.

331
00:16:30,795 --> 00:16:34,798
We are delighted to show you
famous Soviet hospitality.

332
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:38,469
There will be banquet tonight
in hotel ballroom,

333
00:16:38,503 --> 00:16:40,204
and over next few days,
we hope to build

334
00:16:40,238 --> 00:16:43,107
trust and admiration
for our two great nations.

335
00:16:43,141 --> 00:16:44,091
You see those guys

336
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:45,709
over there
with the grim looks?

337
00:16:45,744 --> 00:16:48,445
KGB minders. Mind them.

338
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,015
We know you will enjoy
your stay here.

339
00:16:51,049 --> 00:16:53,617
As comrade Stalin famously said,

340
00:16:53,652 --> 00:16:56,787
"gaiety is
most outstanding feature

341
00:16:56,821 --> 00:16:58,455
of Soviet Union."

342
00:17:07,832 --> 00:17:10,067
So...

343
00:17:10,101 --> 00:17:13,303
You and Bridget on the flight,
uh, did you two...

344
00:17:13,338 --> 00:17:16,557
Yes, we talked.
Everything is fine.

345
00:17:17,525 --> 00:17:18,942
Good.

346
00:17:31,556 --> 00:17:34,608
That is the smallest bathtub
I have ever seen.

347
00:17:34,693 --> 00:17:36,527
Well, at least there is
no hot water.

348
00:17:37,595 --> 00:17:39,229
Old-world charm
with third-world plumbing.

349
00:17:40,331 --> 00:17:42,499
I hope you find amenities
to your liking.

350
00:17:42,533 --> 00:17:44,818
Oh, well, there are
a few things we could use.

351
00:17:44,853 --> 00:17:45,903
Oh.

352
00:17:45,937 --> 00:17:48,138
Um, soap, maybe.

353
00:17:48,173 --> 00:17:49,907
Is there a market nearby?

354
00:17:49,941 --> 00:17:51,075
No.

355
00:17:51,109 --> 00:17:52,176
No?

356
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:53,343
You cannot leave hotel,

357
00:17:53,378 --> 00:17:55,746
not without
hospitality ambassador.

358
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,381
Oh, and that would be you?

359
00:17:57,415 --> 00:17:58,332
Mm-hmm.

360
00:17:58,366 --> 00:17:59,783
Have Mayer's Soviet sister.

361
00:17:59,818 --> 00:18:01,218
Next she'll want
to be checking our girdles.

362
00:18:02,187 --> 00:18:04,187
I will arrange tour
for ladies, yes?

363
00:18:04,205 --> 00:18:06,023
1400 hours?

364
00:18:06,057 --> 00:18:07,157
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

365
00:18:08,259 --> 00:18:11,462
Wait. Why is not
Kate Cameron here?

366
00:18:51,603 --> 00:18:53,871
Uh, what? Uh, I'm sorry?

367
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,808
I'm sorry. I'm... I'm lost.

368
00:18:57,842 --> 00:18:59,076
I was looking...

369
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,944
Kate, it's about time.

370
00:19:02,347 --> 00:19:05,115
Captain Broyles, I was...

371
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:07,084
W-wondering where you were.

372
00:19:16,461 --> 00:19:18,328
Okay?

373
00:19:19,631 --> 00:19:21,165
Okay.

374
00:19:23,067 --> 00:19:25,002
What did you say to him?

375
00:19:25,036 --> 00:19:27,538
I told him that you had
a very important client

376
00:19:27,572 --> 00:19:29,139
waiting for you.

377
00:19:29,174 --> 00:19:30,340
A client?

378
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:34,244
Oh, he thinks I'm going to...

379
00:19:34,278 --> 00:19:35,679
Kate, I'm kidding.

380
00:19:35,713 --> 00:19:36,780
What are you doing
down here, anyway?

381
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:40,684
I must have hit the wrong button
on the elevator.

382
00:19:40,718 --> 00:19:42,536
The wrong button?

383
00:19:52,831 --> 00:19:55,132
What are you doing
down here...

384
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:57,267
With all this?

385
00:19:57,302 --> 00:20:00,070
A little...
Diplomatic relations.

386
00:20:00,104 --> 00:20:02,806
Pack of ciggies in Moscow is
worth more than a faberge egg.

387
00:20:04,943 --> 00:20:06,376
and you brought this all
on our flight?

388
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:10,247
Kate, I think
you better go back upstairs

389
00:20:10,281 --> 00:20:13,317
before your KGB pal comes
looking for the menthols.

390
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:24,578
Well, thank you again
for opening up your home.

391
00:20:24,612 --> 00:20:25,863
Not at all.

392
00:20:25,897 --> 00:20:27,030
I'm surprised all these people
wanted to venture out

393
00:20:27,065 --> 00:20:28,665
on a cold night to hear
what I have to say.

394
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,100
Oh, ignore him.

395
00:20:30,134 --> 00:20:31,568
He's just being modest.

396
00:20:31,603 --> 00:20:33,770
Maggie will disagree
with me on almost anything.

397
00:20:33,805 --> 00:20:37,007
Well, only when you're wrong,
which is... often.

398
00:20:40,011 --> 00:20:41,445
Ted!

399
00:20:41,479 --> 00:20:46,016
Oh, excuse me, please.

400
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:47,951
I didn't know
you were going to be here.

401
00:20:47,986 --> 00:20:49,987
Uh, neither did I.
Uh, apparently, Amanda's parents

402
00:20:50,021 --> 00:20:53,006
backed the congressman
in his first race.

403
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:54,007
Uh, Amanda, this is Maggie.

404
00:20:54,042 --> 00:20:55,609
We work together at Pan Am.

405
00:20:55,643 --> 00:20:58,779
Sorry. We walked over,
and my hands are freezing.

406
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:02,165
And then Teddy wanted to go
for a carriage ride in the park

407
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,684
in the middle of November.

408
00:21:03,718 --> 00:21:06,670
I thought it'd be romantic.

409
00:21:06,704 --> 00:21:09,239
Who are you, and what have you
done with Ted Vanderway?

410
00:21:09,274 --> 00:21:10,607
Speaking of romantic,

411
00:21:10,642 --> 00:21:11,792
you're the last girl I'd ever
expect to be on the arm

412
00:21:11,826 --> 00:21:13,410
of a republican.

413
00:21:15,597 --> 00:21:18,282
You're forgetting,
I'm a Pan Am stewardess.

414
00:21:18,316 --> 00:21:20,617
I'm trained in diplomacy.

415
00:21:20,651 --> 00:21:21,868
Yeah, well,
then who are you,

416
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,387
and what have you done
with Maggie Ryan?

417
00:21:32,447 --> 00:21:35,732
In Red Square, you will see
notable armory museum

418
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:38,635
and tomb of unknown soldier,
honoring brave heroes

419
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:42,639
who won great patriotic war
for allies.

420
00:21:44,042 --> 00:21:47,277
Olga, uh, do you know where
<i>Ostenazenka</i> street is?

421
00:21:47,312 --> 00:21:48,245
<i>Ostozhenka.</i>

422
00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:49,579
<i>Ostozhenka.</i>

423
00:21:49,614 --> 00:21:50,881
It's the street where
my grandfather grew up.

424
00:21:50,915 --> 00:21:52,582
Your grandfather?
He's from Moscow?

425
00:21:52,617 --> 00:21:54,151
Uh, well, he lived here
until he was 5.

426
00:21:54,185 --> 00:21:56,052
Oh.
Uh...

427
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:58,155
If we could... if we could
just go down this way,

428
00:21:58,189 --> 00:21:59,656
uh, I might be able to find
his address.

429
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:02,960
Uh, no. Is not on tour.

430
00:22:02,994 --> 00:22:04,895
It would mean so much to me
and my sister

431
00:22:04,929 --> 00:22:08,431
if we could learn more
about our Soviet heritage.

432
00:22:08,449 --> 00:22:10,567
Mm.

433
00:22:14,756 --> 00:22:17,441
This is Communist Party housing,

434
00:22:17,475 --> 00:22:21,812
provided free, of course,
by glorious decree of presidium.

435
00:22:23,514 --> 00:22:25,782
Let's get in a photo. Go.

436
00:22:29,821 --> 00:22:31,421
Ready?

437
00:22:31,455 --> 00:22:33,974
One, two, three.

438
00:23:08,943 --> 00:23:09,893
I didn't do anything.

439
00:23:09,911 --> 00:23:10,994
I...

440
00:23:11,029 --> 00:23:11,895
Don't touch her.

441
00:23:11,913 --> 00:23:12,946
Hey.
What... what is he saying?

442
00:23:12,997 --> 00:23:13,914
He wants your film.

443
00:23:13,948 --> 00:23:15,198
Okay.
Laura, just give it to him.

444
00:23:15,233 --> 00:23:17,117
But she was only taking
a picture of that building.

445
00:23:17,168 --> 00:23:19,586
He says
it is act of espionage.

446
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,004
Espionage?
That is ridiculous.

447
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,205
They come with us.
No.

448
00:23:22,239 --> 00:23:23,240
- What?
- What?

449
00:23:23,274 --> 00:23:25,375
What?
Kate.

450
00:23:25,409 --> 00:23:26,409
Laura.
What's happening?

451
00:23:33,023 --> 00:23:34,673
They are being detained
for questions.

452
00:23:34,737 --> 00:23:36,571
What... what questions?
What did they do wrong?

453
00:23:36,606 --> 00:23:37,739
They were taking photos.

454
00:23:37,773 --> 00:23:38,707
Of a building.

455
00:23:38,741 --> 00:23:40,208
A Soviet building,

456
00:23:40,226 --> 00:23:43,044
housing many of
our illustrious party members.

457
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:44,346
It is not unthinkable

458
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:47,249
your CIA would use stewardesses
to gather information.

459
00:23:47,283 --> 00:23:48,950
Where are they being held?

460
00:23:48,985 --> 00:23:49,703
I cannot tell you this.

461
00:23:49,704 --> 00:23:51,419
You... then...
Then I need to go to the U.S. embassy.

462
00:23:52,685 --> 00:23:55,053
You may not leave hotel.

463
00:23:55,087 --> 00:23:58,340
Of course, you are still
welcome to our hospitality.

464
00:24:00,567 --> 00:24:02,902
So what do we do now?

465
00:24:02,936 --> 00:24:05,338
Well, we start by not arguing
with useless bureaucrats.

466
00:24:05,372 --> 00:24:08,007
Just sit tight. They'll be
released soon enough.

467
00:24:08,041 --> 00:24:09,992
And you know that
for a fact how?

468
00:24:10,027 --> 00:24:13,112
I was an army air corps liaison
to the russkies during the war.

469
00:24:13,147 --> 00:24:15,381
Spent a lot of time with 'em,
drank a lot of their vodka,

470
00:24:15,415 --> 00:24:17,884
got to know how they think.
They have a word...

471
00:24:17,918 --> 00:24:20,469
<i>"Zapuguivaniya."</i>

472
00:24:20,521 --> 00:24:22,021
What the hell does
that mean?

473
00:24:22,055 --> 00:24:23,623
Well, it translates loosely...

474
00:24:23,657 --> 00:24:24,924
Into "intimidation."

475
00:24:24,958 --> 00:24:26,509
They can, uh,
keep people on their heels

476
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,560
without ever throwing
a punch.

477
00:24:27,594 --> 00:24:29,162
But they invited us here.

478
00:24:29,196 --> 00:24:30,780
No. Some of 'em did.
Some didn't.

479
00:24:30,831 --> 00:24:33,165
Mistress Olga... she works
for the presidium.

480
00:24:33,183 --> 00:24:35,685
She doesn't speak
for the KGB.

481
00:24:35,736 --> 00:24:38,237
But, look, they made
their point.

482
00:24:38,255 --> 00:24:40,106
It will all blow over.

483
00:24:44,027 --> 00:24:45,828
I'm not taking any chances.

484
00:24:45,863 --> 00:24:47,346
I want you two
to go back up to the room.

485
00:24:47,381 --> 00:24:48,898
You pack up
Bridget and Laura's things.

486
00:24:48,932 --> 00:24:51,367
I'm not gonna risk them
planting anything in their bags.

487
00:25:01,228 --> 00:25:03,863
Well, I think Rawlings
is a shoo-in for '64...

488
00:25:03,897 --> 00:25:05,665
No matter what
"the Village voice" says.

489
00:25:05,699 --> 00:25:07,132
Oh, a bunch
of lefty propaganda.

490
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:09,535
I'm surprised Khrushchev isn't
on the editorial staff.

491
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:12,171
Did anyone try the rumaki?

492
00:25:12,206 --> 00:25:13,172
What do you
say we get out of here

493
00:25:13,207 --> 00:25:14,173
and go for a walk
or something?

494
00:25:14,208 --> 00:25:15,508
Um, we just here.

495
00:25:15,542 --> 00:25:16,475
What's gotten into you?

496
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:17,777
Uh, just stuffy, I guess.

497
00:25:17,811 --> 00:25:19,045
- Well, take off your coat.
- I'm fine.

498
00:25:19,079 --> 00:25:20,713
So don't tell me
that you believe everything

499
00:25:20,747 --> 00:25:22,465
that they print in that rag.

500
00:25:22,499 --> 00:25:23,983
Oh, well...

501
00:25:24,017 --> 00:25:26,552
The reporting in the "voice"
is actually quite nuanced.

502
00:25:26,587 --> 00:25:29,305
"Nuanced"? They said
that Rawlings called goldwater

503
00:25:29,339 --> 00:25:30,923
- a fanatic.
- Since when is having

504
00:25:30,958 --> 00:25:32,575
- an opinion a crime?
- Well, since when did

505
00:25:32,626 --> 00:25:34,493
communist rhetoric start
passing as journalism?

506
00:25:34,528 --> 00:25:37,697
Well, maybe Chris doesn't want
to march in lockstep

507
00:25:37,731 --> 00:25:40,199
with goldwater
and his red-baiting thugs.

508
00:25:40,234 --> 00:25:41,634
- What?
- I hardly think that...

509
00:25:41,702 --> 00:25:43,185
Oh, you hardly think?

510
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:44,604
Well, maybe that's
your problem

511
00:25:44,638 --> 00:25:47,673
to begin with,
you ignorant buffoon.

512
00:25:50,427 --> 00:25:53,712
Can I, uh, talk to you
for a minute?

513
00:25:56,366 --> 00:25:59,201
It doesn't make any sense.
Why take Laura and Bridget?

514
00:25:59,253 --> 00:26:02,054
It could have
just as easily been you or me.

515
00:26:02,089 --> 00:26:03,422
They were making a point.

516
00:26:03,456 --> 00:26:05,641
Yeah, but to think
one of us is a spy. It's...

517
00:26:05,692 --> 00:26:08,127
I know. It's ridiculous.

518
00:26:12,232 --> 00:26:13,366
Colette?

519
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,801
"D. L."

520
00:26:15,836 --> 00:26:18,137
Dean Lowrey, right?

521
00:26:20,707 --> 00:26:22,675
It could have been here

522
00:26:22,709 --> 00:26:24,877
from a long time ago.

523
00:26:25,912 --> 00:26:28,648
Yet here it is now...

524
00:26:28,682 --> 00:26:31,450
Inside Bridget's suitcase.

525
00:26:35,322 --> 00:26:37,657
No one knows where we are.

526
00:26:37,691 --> 00:26:39,392
We don't even know
where we are.

527
00:26:39,426 --> 00:26:41,294
Laura, we
are going to get out.

528
00:26:41,328 --> 00:26:42,378
Just breathe.

529
00:26:42,429 --> 00:26:44,897
Have you had these types
of attacks before?

530
00:26:44,931 --> 00:26:47,766
The last time was
at my wedding.

531
00:26:47,784 --> 00:26:50,069
How did you get through it?

532
00:26:50,103 --> 00:26:52,938
I ran away.

533
00:26:52,973 --> 00:26:54,940
Well, that's not really
an option here,

534
00:26:54,975 --> 00:26:59,078
but I-I can imagine
it must have been terrible.

535
00:26:59,112 --> 00:27:01,047
Running out on my fiance?

536
00:27:01,081 --> 00:27:04,150
You have no idea.

537
00:27:06,586 --> 00:27:08,054
Oh, I didn't...

538
00:27:08,088 --> 00:27:10,356
I didn't mean
you running out on Dean.

539
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:11,841
I'm so sorry.

540
00:27:11,875 --> 00:27:13,993
That's fine.

541
00:27:28,358 --> 00:27:31,010
Dean and I will be
all right...

542
00:27:32,646 --> 00:27:34,914
But you wouldn't have said
that two nights ago.

543
00:27:39,019 --> 00:27:40,820
Can we keep this between us?

544
00:27:40,854 --> 00:27:43,189
Dean and I, in London,

545
00:27:43,223 --> 00:27:47,026
we... we had a moment
of weakness.

546
00:27:47,961 --> 00:27:49,462
You and Dean?

547
00:27:52,265 --> 00:27:53,833
What about Colette?

548
00:27:53,867 --> 00:27:56,102
I-it just happened,
you know.

549
00:27:56,136 --> 00:27:58,788
I-I feel <i>awful</i> about it.

550
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,006
We go.

551
00:28:01,041 --> 00:28:03,075
Where are you taking us?

552
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:05,177
No questions.

553
00:28:12,419 --> 00:28:13,953
What the hell was that
all about?

554
00:28:13,987 --> 00:28:15,321
Well...

555
00:28:15,355 --> 00:28:18,691
You told me I should be
my wonderful, opinionated self.

556
00:28:18,725 --> 00:28:19,992
I said opinionated,
not deranged.

557
00:28:20,026 --> 00:28:22,428
You just called one of
my biggest donors a buffoon.

558
00:28:22,462 --> 00:28:26,832
Actually, it was
an "ignorant buffoon."

559
00:28:29,002 --> 00:28:31,270
It was you.

560
00:28:31,304 --> 00:28:32,905
You were the leak
behind the "Voice" article.

561
00:28:32,939 --> 00:28:35,708
No. I...  I mean...

562
00:28:35,742 --> 00:28:38,778
Yes.

563
00:28:38,812 --> 00:28:44,550
I submitted that article
before we started

564
00:28:44,568 --> 00:28:47,837
whatever it is that
we've started...

565
00:28:47,871 --> 00:28:51,223
But you did say
all those things.

566
00:28:51,258 --> 00:28:53,626
There's a difference
between what I say in public

567
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,795
and pillow talk.

568
00:28:55,829 --> 00:28:57,229
So...

569
00:28:57,264 --> 00:29:02,134
You don't actually have
any convictions of your own?

570
00:29:02,169 --> 00:29:04,270
Oh, I forgot.

571
00:29:04,304 --> 00:29:07,206
Your conviction is
to get elected.

572
00:29:09,375 --> 00:29:10,426
I...

573
00:29:10,477 --> 00:29:13,712
I envy the simple universe
that you live in.

574
00:29:13,747 --> 00:29:17,149
It must be nice having
all the answers.

575
00:29:19,252 --> 00:29:24,590
I didn't realize having
principles made me simple.

576
00:29:24,624 --> 00:29:26,792
Thanks for the education.

577
00:29:26,826 --> 00:29:29,261
I've been waiting
for the right moment,

578
00:29:29,296 --> 00:29:32,465
uh, to give this to you,
but I-I can't wait anymore.

579
00:29:32,499 --> 00:29:33,833
Um...

580
00:29:33,867 --> 00:29:37,069
Amanda Hartford
Mason, will you marry me?

581
00:29:37,103 --> 00:29:38,070
Yes.

582
00:29:38,088 --> 00:29:39,171
- Teddy, yes.
- Okay.

583
00:29:39,206 --> 00:29:41,507
Aw.

584
00:29:41,541 --> 00:29:44,326
Ohh. She said yes!

585
00:29:44,361 --> 00:29:45,828
Hey.

586
00:29:45,862 --> 00:29:47,880
Thank you. Thank you.

587
00:29:47,914 --> 00:29:50,716
Let's see the ring. Ohh!

588
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:05,948
- All right.
- I'm through waiting.

589
00:30:05,982 --> 00:30:07,867
I'm gonna go out
and deal with this.

590
00:30:07,901 --> 00:30:11,637
Great idea. You two take out
the KGB agent.

591
00:30:11,671 --> 00:30:13,722
I'll steal a tank.
We'll blast our way out.

592
00:30:13,757 --> 00:30:15,758
This isn't a John Wayne movie.

593
00:30:15,809 --> 00:30:17,176
You're 1,000 miles
behind the iron curtain.

594
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:18,644
You can't just go out there
guns blazin'.

595
00:30:18,678 --> 00:30:20,012
Do you have a better idea?

596
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:21,981
Look, we do not want to make
this an international incident.

597
00:30:22,015 --> 00:30:24,416
Uh, a-as opposed
to what it is now?

598
00:30:24,451 --> 00:30:25,784
You know, for the first time
since the war,

599
00:30:25,819 --> 00:30:26,886
our relations are thawing.

600
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,187
You think the Soviets want
to screw that up

601
00:30:28,221 --> 00:30:29,455
over a couple of stewardesses?

602
00:30:29,489 --> 00:30:31,957
That is my sister
you are talking about,

603
00:30:31,992 --> 00:30:33,626
and I know
you know people here,

604
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:35,160
people with connections.

605
00:30:35,195 --> 00:30:37,263
Yeah, I have connections,
but not the kind to get us out

606
00:30:37,297 --> 00:30:38,631
of a situation like this.

607
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,700
Yeah? There's no one
you can bribe?

608
00:30:41,735 --> 00:30:45,137
Couple packs of cigarettes?

609
00:30:47,974 --> 00:30:50,242
Your attention, please!

610
00:30:50,277 --> 00:30:54,580
I must inform you,
trip has been canceled.

611
00:30:55,916 --> 00:30:57,750
You will be escorted to airport
and depart immediately.

612
00:30:57,784 --> 00:30:59,618
No. Hey! I want to talk
to somebody

613
00:30:59,652 --> 00:31:01,036
that actually has
some authority around here.

614
00:31:01,087 --> 00:31:03,789
I am sorry. There is
nothing that can be done.

615
00:31:03,823 --> 00:31:04,757
What about
our stewardesses...

616
00:31:04,791 --> 00:31:06,425
Bridget Pierce
and Laura Cameron?

617
00:31:06,459 --> 00:31:07,927
Do not be concerned
with them.

618
00:31:07,961 --> 00:31:09,295
What the hell does
that mean?

619
00:31:09,329 --> 00:31:12,047
It means they stay. You go.

620
00:32:00,147 --> 00:32:01,947
Maggie?

621
00:32:02,983 --> 00:32:04,049
Are you okay?

622
00:32:04,084 --> 00:32:05,985
Oh.

623
00:32:06,019 --> 00:32:09,255
It's the last time I buy
this cheap mascara.

624
00:32:11,124 --> 00:32:12,925
Hey, what you said
out there...

625
00:32:12,959 --> 00:32:14,643
Oh, it was stupid.

626
00:32:14,678 --> 00:32:16,128
I have a big mouth.

627
00:32:16,163 --> 00:32:17,429
No.

628
00:32:17,464 --> 00:32:20,666
I... wish I could be
more like you.

629
00:32:21,935 --> 00:32:24,470
There's nothing harder
than standing up for yourself.

630
00:32:24,504 --> 00:32:27,640
You were...

631
00:32:27,674 --> 00:32:33,946
Strong and brave
and honest.

632
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,981
Never apologize for that.

633
00:32:36,016 --> 00:32:39,752
Well, then I'll
apologize for not being honest.

634
00:32:39,786 --> 00:32:41,554
This mascara is not cheap.

635
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,127
Men are idiots.

636
00:32:50,931 --> 00:32:52,865
I know.

637
00:32:54,801 --> 00:32:58,103
Sometimes I think
women are just...

638
00:32:58,138 --> 00:33:00,389
Better.

639
00:33:00,423 --> 00:33:01,974
Me, too.

640
00:33:25,699 --> 00:33:28,100
You know who I am?

641
00:33:28,134 --> 00:33:29,635
You cannot be here.

642
00:33:29,669 --> 00:33:31,270
Please. You must go.

643
00:33:31,304 --> 00:33:33,806
I need your help.

644
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,140
You cannot come inside.

645
00:33:35,175 --> 00:33:37,309
KGB is watching always
and listening.

646
00:33:37,344 --> 00:33:38,944
Yes. Let me explain.

647
00:33:38,979 --> 00:33:41,780
I know why you are here.
I have heard about

648
00:33:41,815 --> 00:33:43,649
two Pan Am stewardesses
detained as spies.

649
00:33:43,683 --> 00:33:45,584
And one of them is
my sister.

650
00:33:45,619 --> 00:33:49,455
They told me that your boyfriend
is high up in the Kremlin.

651
00:33:49,489 --> 00:33:51,423
You could go to him.

652
00:33:51,458 --> 00:33:54,293
That's impossible.

653
00:33:54,327 --> 00:33:56,962
What you are saying
is suicide.

654
00:33:56,997 --> 00:33:59,565
I'm sorry,
but I cannot help you.

655
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:02,368
I don't care if it puts
you or me in danger.

656
00:34:02,402 --> 00:34:03,702
One way or another,
you are going to help me,

657
00:34:03,737 --> 00:34:05,905
and you are going
to do it now.

658
00:34:20,287 --> 00:34:23,372
"Albers, Lawrence".

659
00:34:23,406 --> 00:34:26,491
"Benson, Scott".

660
00:34:26,509 --> 00:34:29,845
"Broyles, George".

661
00:34:29,896 --> 00:34:32,281
"Cameron, Kate."

662
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,217
"Cameron, Kate."

663
00:34:35,251 --> 00:34:37,336
Right here.

664
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:41,073
Right here.

665
00:34:41,107 --> 00:34:42,608
Captain Broyles,
can I talk to you?

666
00:34:42,642 --> 00:34:45,110
"Fineman, Rachel".

667
00:34:45,144 --> 00:34:46,745
"Harmon, Gerald."

668
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,647
I found someone who can help us
get my sister back...

669
00:34:48,682 --> 00:34:50,416
Someone high up
in the Kremlin.

670
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:52,184
Yeah, sure you did.

671
00:34:52,218 --> 00:34:54,386
His name is Vitaly Berzin.

672
00:34:54,421 --> 00:34:55,621
He is
on the Central Committee...

673
00:34:56,556 --> 00:34:59,024
And this is
his private number.

674
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,460
You're kidding, right?

675
00:35:01,494 --> 00:35:03,629
He is willing to intercede,
but it's going to take cash

676
00:35:03,663 --> 00:35:06,598
and a lot of it,
and I know you have it.

677
00:35:06,633 --> 00:35:10,102
How does a Pan Am stewardess
have connections at the Kremlin?

678
00:35:10,136 --> 00:35:12,204
How does a Pan Am pilot
smuggle thousands of dollars

679
00:35:12,238 --> 00:35:14,873
in black market merchandise
across international borders?

680
00:35:14,908 --> 00:35:17,142
He's
waiting to hear from you.

681
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,313
Who are you?

682
00:35:21,348 --> 00:35:23,716
I'm a concerned sister.

683
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:26,218
We should all have sisters
like you.

684
00:35:28,438 --> 00:35:31,640
Bus to airport has arrived.

685
00:35:33,026 --> 00:35:34,893
<i>Pazhalsta</i> gather belongings.

686
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:38,647
You leave in two minutes.

687
00:35:49,268 --> 00:35:51,136
Why are you not starting
engines?

688
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:52,904
Because I'm not flying
this plane.

689
00:35:55,441 --> 00:35:57,008
Neither is he.

690
00:35:57,043 --> 00:35:58,844
This aircraft lacks
authorization

691
00:35:58,878 --> 00:36:00,312
to stay in Soviet Union.

692
00:36:00,346 --> 00:36:01,713
You will only make
situation worse.

693
00:36:01,747 --> 00:36:04,266
- I don't care about your authorization.
- You will fly.

694
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,618
And you'll get off
of my flight...

695
00:36:06,652 --> 00:36:08,353
That won't be necessary.

696
00:36:08,387 --> 00:36:10,355
You want to make
this situation worse,

697
00:36:10,389 --> 00:36:11,623
then you go ahead.

698
00:36:11,657 --> 00:36:14,693
Shoot me, 'cause I'm not
flying the damn plane.

699
00:36:19,899 --> 00:36:23,468
Where are they taking us?

700
00:36:23,503 --> 00:36:25,737
I'm not... I'm not sure.

701
00:36:25,771 --> 00:36:27,906
There's
a KGB interrogation facility

702
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:29,641
outside Lubyanka.

703
00:36:29,675 --> 00:36:31,009
Interrogation?

704
00:36:31,043 --> 00:36:32,611
They will question us
separately.

705
00:36:32,645 --> 00:36:34,045
They'll tell you things
I said about you.

706
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,547
Do not believe them.

707
00:36:35,581 --> 00:36:36,848
Okay, I won't.

708
00:36:36,883 --> 00:36:39,484
I won't, but how do you
know all this?

709
00:36:45,758 --> 00:36:47,692
Stay strong.

710
00:36:47,727 --> 00:36:48,827
You, too.

711
00:36:53,032 --> 00:36:56,001
You have friends in high places.

712
00:36:56,035 --> 00:36:57,468
Now you go.

713
00:37:02,341 --> 00:37:05,360
Ohh. Oh!

714
00:37:06,729 --> 00:37:07,913
I guess we'll have
a good story to tell

715
00:37:07,947 --> 00:37:09,614
at Thanksgiving.

716
00:37:12,051 --> 00:37:15,153
All right, ladies,
let's get, uh, wheels up

717
00:37:15,188 --> 00:37:16,688
before they change
their mind, huh?

718
00:37:22,128 --> 00:37:24,429
That was pretty gutsy
what you did.

719
00:37:24,463 --> 00:37:28,166
Well, I didn't know what else
to do. Guess it worked.

720
00:37:28,201 --> 00:37:30,802
Yeah. As the Russians say...

721
00:37:30,836 --> 00:37:33,154
<i>"Kto ni riskuyet</i>

722
00:37:33,189 --> 00:37:34,956
<i>tot ni piyot shampanskava."</i>

723
00:37:34,991 --> 00:37:37,609
Translation?

724
00:37:37,643 --> 00:37:39,110
"He who doesn't risk

725
00:37:39,145 --> 00:37:42,113
never gets
to drink champagne."

726
00:37:42,148 --> 00:37:44,449
Captain...

727
00:37:45,534 --> 00:37:46,918
The left seat is yours.

728
00:37:56,963 --> 00:37:57,946
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

729
00:37:57,997 --> 00:37:59,097
<i>I'm happy to inform you</i>

730
00:37:59,131 --> 00:38:01,016
<i>we have just left</i>
<i>Soviet air space.</i>

731
00:38:04,603 --> 00:38:06,371
One minute,
we're in the back of the van,

732
00:38:06,405 --> 00:38:07,872
and the next,
we're at the airport.

733
00:38:07,907 --> 00:38:10,008
How did that happen?

734
00:38:10,042 --> 00:38:12,677
I guess somebody at Pan Am
pulled some strings.

735
00:38:12,712 --> 00:38:14,646
You think it was that easy?

736
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:15,980
I have no idea.

737
00:38:15,998 --> 00:38:19,417
Well, the worst part is
they took my new camera.

738
00:38:43,859 --> 00:38:46,177
Thank you.

739
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,747
For what?

740
00:38:48,781 --> 00:38:51,616
Well, for being, uh...

741
00:38:51,651 --> 00:38:53,468
For being patient.

742
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,460
Colette, look, there...

743
00:39:02,495 --> 00:39:04,696
There's something
that I need to tell you.

744
00:39:11,904 --> 00:39:13,471
Where did you find this?

745
00:39:13,506 --> 00:39:15,974
You tell me.

746
00:39:19,812 --> 00:39:23,981
Colette, I don't... I don't want
to lie to you ever

747
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,318
about anything.

748
00:39:26,352 --> 00:39:29,620
Then don't.

749
00:39:29,638 --> 00:39:30,655
Say what you need to say.
