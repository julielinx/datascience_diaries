1
00:00:00,314 --> 00:00:01,247
<i>Previously on "Pan Am"...</i>

2
00:00:01,268 --> 00:00:02,368
There's a dealer in London

3
00:00:02,436 --> 00:00:04,737
who's gotten hold
of a list of CIA assets.

4
00:00:04,832 --> 00:00:06,565
- Who's on that list?
- Bridget Pierce.

5
00:00:06,633 --> 00:00:09,035
I've fallen in love with you,
and I will do whatever it takes.

6
00:00:09,102 --> 00:00:10,235
Dean, I need to move on.

7
00:00:10,303 --> 00:00:11,704
I beg you to see
the Trevi Fountain with me.

8
00:00:11,772 --> 00:00:13,539
You don't know a thing
about this guy.

9
00:00:13,606 --> 00:00:15,775
You're a prince?

10
00:00:15,842 --> 00:00:17,710
- You're a smuggler?
- I need a partner, Maggie,

11
00:00:17,778 --> 00:00:19,078
someone
to share in the rewards.

12
00:00:19,146 --> 00:00:21,513
I am more comfortable
with women.

13
00:00:21,581 --> 00:00:23,081
I want to be married
to you.

14
00:00:23,149 --> 00:00:24,650
- How?
- It'll be perfect.

15
00:00:24,717 --> 00:00:26,685
You can see whoever you want.

16
00:00:26,752 --> 00:00:28,187
I can see who I want.

17
00:00:28,254 --> 00:00:29,921
You can even have Laura.

18
00:00:34,026 --> 00:00:35,594
Please.

19
00:00:35,662 --> 00:00:37,596
Madam, now...

20
00:00:37,664 --> 00:00:39,096
- That feels nice.
- It's nice.

21
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:40,598
How is your flight so far?

22
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:42,433
- Very good.
- Very good.

23
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:44,268
- I don't like too much sugar.
- Light sugar.

24
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:45,971
Omar seems very down-to-earth.

25
00:00:45,972 --> 00:00:47,605
You know, for a future king.

26
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:49,773
Despite buying out
the entire first class

27
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:51,409
for himself and his entourage.

28
00:00:51,476 --> 00:00:53,744
That wasn't his idea.
It was his parents'.

29
00:00:53,812 --> 00:00:54,744
I dated a prince once.

30
00:00:54,812 --> 00:00:55,745
You did?

31
00:00:55,813 --> 00:00:57,547
Johnny Esposito.

32
00:00:57,615 --> 00:01:00,584
His father was the muffler king
of Clatsop County.

33
00:01:00,651 --> 00:01:03,152
Every time we pulled
into a filling station,

34
00:01:03,221 --> 00:01:04,487
we were royalty.

35
00:01:04,555 --> 00:01:06,889
That's not exactly
the stuff of fairy tales.

36
00:01:06,957 --> 00:01:09,792
I'm done with fairy tales.
Who needs 'em?

37
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:10,792
I do.

38
00:01:11,861 --> 00:01:13,895
Well, look who's beaming.

39
00:01:13,963 --> 00:01:16,098
I feel like I'm floating
on air.

40
00:01:16,165 --> 00:01:18,734
We all are.
We're at 30,000 feet.

41
00:01:20,401 --> 00:01:21,796
Okay.

42
00:01:22,597 --> 00:01:24,273
Where did I leave off?

43
00:01:24,341 --> 00:01:26,074
It seems strange,
doesn't it,

44
00:01:26,142 --> 00:01:28,243
not calling it
"idlewild" anymore?

45
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:31,279
Airports are supposed to be
named after places, not people.

46
00:01:31,347 --> 00:01:33,848
Yeah,
but it's Jack Kennedy.

47
00:01:33,915 --> 00:01:35,750
What did Jackie say?
"There will be other presidents,

48
00:01:35,817 --> 00:01:38,119
but there will never be
another time quite like that."

49
00:01:38,186 --> 00:01:40,455
Yeah, for
"one brief, shining moment"...

50
00:01:40,522 --> 00:01:42,922
"Known as Camelot."

51
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:46,493
Excuse me while I go jump
out of this plane.

52
00:01:48,929 --> 00:01:51,598
And yet they had
a very unconventional marriage.

53
00:01:53,167 --> 00:01:54,100
How do you mean?

54
00:01:54,168 --> 00:01:55,402
Well, he was known

55
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:56,603
to entertain
a stewardess or two,

56
00:01:56,671 --> 00:01:57,771
and they still made
it work.

57
00:01:59,339 --> 00:02:02,040
What, you're not thinking
about messing around already?

58
00:02:02,108 --> 00:02:03,676
You're not even
married yet.

59
00:02:03,744 --> 00:02:06,178
Amanda sort of
gave me permission.

60
00:02:06,246 --> 00:02:07,146
Seriously?

61
00:02:07,213 --> 00:02:09,248
Well,
she's a very modern girl.

62
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:12,151
It could be a test.

63
00:02:12,218 --> 00:02:14,153
I definitely feel tested.

64
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,220
Well, as your captain
and your friend,

65
00:02:16,289 --> 00:02:17,889
I will just tell you
to think about it

66
00:02:17,956 --> 00:02:18,890
before you do
anything stupid.

67
00:02:18,957 --> 00:02:20,358
I didn't.

68
00:02:20,426 --> 00:02:22,327
Now the woman I want to be with
is back there in first class

69
00:02:22,395 --> 00:02:24,296
getting fitted
for a glass slipper.

70
00:02:24,363 --> 00:02:26,498
All I've been doing
is thinking.

71
00:02:26,565 --> 00:02:27,499
I thought you said
she was perfect.

72
00:02:27,566 --> 00:02:29,401
She is. She is.

73
00:02:29,468 --> 00:02:32,235
Well, almost. I mean,
nobody's perfect, right?

74
00:02:32,304 --> 00:02:36,573
Yeah. For me...
Colette comes close.

75
00:02:36,641 --> 00:02:37,741
I guess
if you really love someone,

76
00:02:37,809 --> 00:02:39,209
that makes 'em perfect,

77
00:02:39,277 --> 00:02:41,578
even if they don't necessarily
feel the same way about you.

78
00:02:41,646 --> 00:02:43,079
Coffee, gentlemen?

79
00:02:43,147 --> 00:02:44,381
Yes, please.

80
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:47,483
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

81
00:02:47,551 --> 00:02:49,084
You're welcome.

82
00:02:55,158 --> 00:02:59,429
The lounge is reserved
for first-class passengers only.

83
00:02:59,496 --> 00:03:01,764
Shut the curtain.

84
00:03:07,637 --> 00:03:10,171
I need you to
walk something through customs.

85
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,841
What is it this time?

86
00:03:12,908 --> 00:03:15,711
Antique jewelry.
Berber pendants.

87
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:18,012
More art than sparkle,
but collectors pay top dollar.

88
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,548
Smuggling jewelry
into the United States

89
00:03:20,615 --> 00:03:21,816
is a little more serious

90
00:03:21,884 --> 00:03:24,418
than sneaking cigarettes
into North Africa.

91
00:03:24,486 --> 00:03:26,321
Yeah, so is the money...

92
00:03:26,388 --> 00:03:28,756
Money you're gonna need
for your future plans.

93
00:03:28,824 --> 00:03:31,025
My future died last month
in Dallas.

94
00:03:31,093 --> 00:03:33,061
Well, I guess
I'm your future now.

95
00:03:33,128 --> 00:03:35,362
How depressing.

96
00:03:35,429 --> 00:03:36,563
Yeah, but lucrative.

97
00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:42,903
"Clipper Majestic,"

98
00:03:42,971 --> 00:03:45,239
<i>welcome home to
John F. Kennedy International.</i>

99
00:03:47,976 --> 00:03:50,777
So new year's Eve at my place.
We'll help cook?

100
00:03:50,845 --> 00:03:53,445
Well, you can see Times Square
from Ted's apartment.

101
00:03:53,513 --> 00:03:55,214
We could watch the ball drop
without being trampled.

102
00:03:55,282 --> 00:03:57,316
I don't cook.
I don't help cook.

103
00:03:57,384 --> 00:03:58,484
We'll do everything...

104
00:03:58,551 --> 00:04:00,353
And everyone can get
to know Amanda better.

105
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,620
And Omar.

106
00:04:01,688 --> 00:04:04,190
I can't remember being
this excited about a new year.

107
00:04:04,258 --> 00:04:06,859
1963 was pretty eventful.

108
00:04:06,926 --> 00:04:08,193
1964 will be even better.

109
00:04:09,262 --> 00:04:10,896
We'll make it better.

110
00:04:19,405 --> 00:04:20,538
What now?

111
00:04:20,606 --> 00:04:23,274
Juan Trippe offering you
the moon route?

112
00:04:26,278 --> 00:04:28,112
What is it?

113
00:04:30,448 --> 00:04:32,383
Says I've been grounded.

114
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:34,218
For what?

115
00:04:34,286 --> 00:04:36,053
"Pilot's license has
been suspended

116
00:04:36,121 --> 00:04:39,389
pending the outcome
of a hearing."

117
00:04:39,456 --> 00:04:42,058
Well, that Haiti business
was months ago. Why now?

118
00:04:44,795 --> 00:04:46,796
It doesn't say...

119
00:04:48,132 --> 00:04:50,633
But I think I got
a pretty good idea.

120
00:04:53,971 --> 00:04:55,237
What took you so long?

121
00:04:55,305 --> 00:04:56,905
I always flirt
with the customs agents.

122
00:04:56,973 --> 00:04:59,574
You wouldn't want me to change
my routine now, would you?

123
00:04:59,642 --> 00:05:00,842
You know, you're getting
to be a real pro at this.

124
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:03,178
Save the sweet talk.
What's next?

125
00:05:07,116 --> 00:05:09,051
So...

126
00:05:09,118 --> 00:05:10,852
I'm meeting the buyers
tomorrow night.

127
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,120
I'll make the deal.
You'll get your cut after that.

128
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:16,023
Unh-unh. Not so fast.
I'm coming with you.

129
00:05:16,091 --> 00:05:17,791
Yeah, that's gonna be
a problem.

130
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:20,361
These guys aren't gonna want to make
a deal with a woman in the room.

131
00:05:20,429 --> 00:05:22,863
Well, it's almost 1964.

132
00:05:22,931 --> 00:05:25,066
They better get used
to women with opinions.

133
00:05:25,133 --> 00:05:26,800
Maggie, let me handle this.

134
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:28,668
You can't even handle <i>me.</i>

135
00:05:28,735 --> 00:05:30,903
Let me make this
perfectly clear.

136
00:05:30,972 --> 00:05:33,940
Where the jewels go, I go.

137
00:05:35,109 --> 00:05:37,543
So I got no choice.

138
00:05:37,611 --> 00:05:39,612
You never did.

139
00:05:46,486 --> 00:05:49,488
PAN AM
Sadly, Series finale - 1964

140
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,420
Sync and corrected by dr.jackson
for www.addic7ed.com

141
00:05:55,628 --> 00:05:56,561
Pop.

142
00:05:56,629 --> 00:05:57,729
Edward.
I called your apartment.

143
00:05:57,797 --> 00:05:59,231
- You didn't answer.
- I was out walking.

144
00:05:59,299 --> 00:06:00,999
Important lunch popped up.

145
00:06:01,066 --> 00:06:03,835
We gotta do ours next week.
Bring Amanda along.

146
00:06:03,903 --> 00:06:04,803
Okay.

147
00:06:04,871 --> 00:06:06,337
Did she tell you?

148
00:06:06,405 --> 00:06:08,673
The Governor has agreed
to preside over your wedding.

149
00:06:08,741 --> 00:06:11,009
Amanda's father is
one of his poker buddies.

150
00:06:11,076 --> 00:06:13,444
Your mother says
this is shaping up to be

151
00:06:13,513 --> 00:06:15,646
<i>the</i> social event
of the year,

152
00:06:15,714 --> 00:06:17,347
and guess who else
is coming.

153
00:06:17,415 --> 00:06:19,182
Juan Trippe.

154
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,351
Those captain wings
are in the bag.

155
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:24,688
- I'd like to earn 'em on my own.
- Nonsense.

156
00:06:24,756 --> 00:06:27,525
All this is damn exciting,
if you ask me.

157
00:06:27,592 --> 00:06:30,027
- What about asking me?
- Well, isn't it?

158
00:06:30,094 --> 00:06:32,094
Everything's moving
kinda fast.

159
00:06:32,162 --> 00:06:33,963
Maybe we should
slow it down.

160
00:06:34,031 --> 00:06:35,598
I'm afraid the women
on both sides of the aisle

161
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:36,733
won't stand for that.

162
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,868
Hell, the Normandy invasion
had less planning.

163
00:06:38,936 --> 00:06:41,437
I mean, uh,
e-everything's okay, right?

164
00:06:41,505 --> 00:06:43,239
Look, I-I don't want
to make a mistake.

165
00:06:44,474 --> 00:06:46,709
Some of the best marriages
are not about love.

166
00:06:46,777 --> 00:06:48,377
They're great partnerships.

167
00:06:48,445 --> 00:06:51,047
Yeah, so whatever
you're going through,

168
00:06:51,114 --> 00:06:53,349
you know, you'll...

169
00:06:53,417 --> 00:06:57,053
You'll get
through it, right?

170
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,387
Attaboy. Okay.

171
00:06:58,455 --> 00:07:01,090
I'm late, so I'll talk
to you next week.

172
00:07:14,002 --> 00:07:17,505
Richard? What's wrong?

173
00:07:17,573 --> 00:07:19,674
I've been shot.

174
00:07:23,872 --> 00:07:26,671
This looks bad, Richard.
You should go to a hospital.

175
00:07:26,682 --> 00:07:29,518
No.
Hospital's the first place they'd look.

176
00:07:29,585 --> 00:07:32,355
"They"? You don't know
who did this?

177
00:07:32,354 --> 00:07:33,454
It was dark.

178
00:07:33,521 --> 00:07:36,022
I was on my way back
to CIA Headquarters...

179
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:39,359
To deliver the microfilm.

180
00:07:42,429 --> 00:07:43,763
Okay.
We should call someone.

181
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,432
Don't you understand?
It was somebody on the inside.

182
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,668
Nobody else knew
about the drop.

183
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:51,837
A double agent.

184
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:53,672
Listen to me, Kate.

185
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,308
This has to be delivered
to the CIA by noon tomorrow.

186
00:07:56,376 --> 00:07:58,009
You're gonna have
to take it in for me.

187
00:07:59,211 --> 00:08:01,480
Okay.

188
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:03,315
Nobody knows I'm missing,

189
00:08:03,383 --> 00:08:06,318
and if anybody
from the agency contacts you,

190
00:08:06,386 --> 00:08:08,320
if they ask about me,

191
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:10,688
that person is
the double agent.

192
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:12,757
Understand?

193
00:08:26,236 --> 00:08:28,338
This can't all be for us.

194
00:08:28,406 --> 00:08:32,809
No. For me, so I can learn
all your favorite foods.

195
00:08:32,876 --> 00:08:34,678
I could have just told you.

196
00:08:36,246 --> 00:08:37,347
What's the fun in that?

197
00:08:38,649 --> 00:08:40,149
I hope you don't mind.
I flew in the chef

198
00:08:40,217 --> 00:08:43,852
from, uh, that restaurant
you like in Paris.

199
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:44,853
<i>Le Dome</i>?

200
00:08:46,889 --> 00:08:48,824
Omar, that's too much.

201
00:08:48,891 --> 00:08:50,859
We could take the subway
to Brooklyn

202
00:08:50,927 --> 00:08:52,160
for brick-oven pizza.

203
00:08:52,228 --> 00:08:54,062
No, no.

204
00:08:55,532 --> 00:08:58,299
This is wonderful.

205
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,434
Please.

206
00:09:03,205 --> 00:09:04,806
Colette.

207
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:08,543
May I have your permission
to court you?

208
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:09,977
Isn't this what you have
been doing?

209
00:09:10,045 --> 00:09:11,278
For me, yes,

210
00:09:11,347 --> 00:09:15,349
but for my parents
and the royal family rules, no.

211
00:09:16,417 --> 00:09:17,984
There are rules?

212
00:09:18,052 --> 00:09:19,285
I'm afraid so.

213
00:09:19,354 --> 00:09:23,122
A formal courtship is
a minimum of six months.

214
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,158
You'll have your own wing
in the palace,

215
00:09:25,226 --> 00:09:28,729
your own staff,
an unlimited clothing allowance.

216
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:31,664
You want me to move
to Wahran?

217
00:09:31,732 --> 00:09:35,267
So my family can get to know
you as a real person

218
00:09:35,335 --> 00:09:38,003
and not the fantasy
I've made you out to be.

219
00:09:38,071 --> 00:09:40,105
Our personal physician
will make sure

220
00:09:40,173 --> 00:09:41,674
you are not made
from fairy dust,

221
00:09:41,742 --> 00:09:45,678
and... and others will be, uh,
dispatched to investigate

222
00:09:45,746 --> 00:09:48,247
what magical land
you are from.

223
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:52,751
And what about my job
with Pan Am?

224
00:09:52,818 --> 00:09:55,487
You could take a leave
of absence,

225
00:09:55,554 --> 00:09:59,491
but only if you wanted to,
of course.

226
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:02,327
Please tell me you'll
at least think about it.

227
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:06,264
I'll think about it.

228
00:10:09,167 --> 00:10:11,102
Another camera?

229
00:10:11,169 --> 00:10:12,370
We can't let
the communists win.

230
00:10:12,438 --> 00:10:15,707
No, I can't.
It's... it's too expensive.

231
00:10:15,775 --> 00:10:16,841
It's on Pan Am.

232
00:10:16,909 --> 00:10:18,242
I-I told 'em what happened
in Moscow,

233
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:19,743
and they sprang
for a new one.

234
00:10:19,811 --> 00:10:21,612
That is very sweet.

235
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:23,580
Thank you.

236
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:27,518
I want to show you
something.

237
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:30,320
Okay.

238
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:38,294
That was after I told you
that I...

239
00:10:38,361 --> 00:10:39,962
Yeah. Right. I remember.

240
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,397
I look like I'm sitting
on the hot seat

241
00:10:41,465 --> 00:10:44,033
and the warden just pulled
the switch.

242
00:10:49,139 --> 00:10:53,074
When did you realize

243
00:10:53,142 --> 00:10:55,844
Greg wasn't the one?

244
00:10:55,912 --> 00:10:59,247
I mean, you almost married
the guy, right?

245
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:03,452
I think I always knew...

246
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:07,455
But my parents loved him.

247
00:11:07,522 --> 00:11:09,457
Everyone said we were perfect together.

248
00:11:09,524 --> 00:11:11,525
Honestly, I...

249
00:11:11,593 --> 00:11:14,528
I couldn't think
of a reason to say no.

250
00:11:14,596 --> 00:11:17,197
Except you wanted more.

251
00:11:17,265 --> 00:11:18,866
Not wanted.

252
00:11:18,934 --> 00:11:20,367
Needed.

253
00:11:25,205 --> 00:11:28,875
This one was
Andy Warhol's favorite.

254
00:11:28,943 --> 00:11:31,143
You showed me
to Andy Warhol?

255
00:11:31,211 --> 00:11:32,712
He said that you looked

256
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,347
like you were being hunted
by the FBI.

257
00:11:34,414 --> 00:11:35,348
What does he know?

258
00:11:35,415 --> 00:11:36,449
The guy paints soup cans.

259
00:11:36,517 --> 00:11:38,217
I think he's a genius.

260
00:11:38,285 --> 00:11:41,620
Plus he said that you were
a fascinating subject

261
00:11:41,688 --> 00:11:43,755
and that I had a very good eye
for choosing you.

262
00:11:43,823 --> 00:11:46,224
Yeah? Maybe he is a genius
after all.

263
00:11:46,292 --> 00:11:48,159
And this one...

264
00:11:49,228 --> 00:11:50,562
Is my favorite.

265
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:53,064
I look like a goofball.

266
00:11:53,132 --> 00:11:56,433
I like the man
in that picture.

267
00:12:05,611 --> 00:12:09,680
Amanda's probably waiting.

268
00:12:09,748 --> 00:12:11,681
You're probably right.

269
00:12:11,749 --> 00:12:13,249
Yeah.

270
00:12:25,796 --> 00:12:28,932
You must be lost, monsieur.

271
00:12:29,599 --> 00:12:30,866
I know.

272
00:12:30,934 --> 00:12:33,769
I started walking.

273
00:12:35,739 --> 00:12:38,774
Guess my inner guidance system
brought me here.

274
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:49,350
So how's, uh...

275
00:12:50,553 --> 00:12:52,954
How's prince charming
treating you?

276
00:12:55,123 --> 00:12:58,325
He wants me
to move to Wahran

277
00:12:58,393 --> 00:13:01,127
to begin
a formal courtship.

278
00:13:03,565 --> 00:13:06,332
You think
it's a little, uh...

279
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,501
A little fast?

280
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:11,004
The purpose
of a courtship is time.

281
00:13:11,072 --> 00:13:12,338
Everything is moving
so quickly,

282
00:13:12,406 --> 00:13:14,074
it will be nice
to slow it down.

283
00:13:14,141 --> 00:13:15,507
You're in love with him?

284
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:22,014
Love is not something I care
to discuss with you.

285
00:13:22,082 --> 00:13:23,182
Look, I-I just...

286
00:13:23,249 --> 00:13:25,685
I-I don't want you
to get swept up

287
00:13:25,752 --> 00:13:28,520
in some fantasy.

288
00:13:28,589 --> 00:13:32,090
Well, I'm beginning to believe
that love is a fantasy...

289
00:13:33,258 --> 00:13:35,259
One day there...

290
00:13:36,596 --> 00:13:39,030
and the next, gone.

291
00:13:42,267 --> 00:13:44,335
Look, Colette...

292
00:13:44,403 --> 00:13:45,937
Good luck
with the hearing, Dean.

293
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:57,481
The microfilm should be
safe inside the lining,

294
00:13:57,548 --> 00:13:58,983
even if someone
searches you.

295
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:00,985
Walk straight
into CIA Headquarters.

296
00:14:01,052 --> 00:14:02,986
Alan O'Neill is
on the 14th floor,

297
00:14:03,053 --> 00:14:04,654
last office on the left.

298
00:14:04,722 --> 00:14:05,755
Don't stop.

299
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,790
Don't say anything
except the password.

300
00:14:08,859 --> 00:14:10,660
"Albatross."

301
00:14:10,728 --> 00:14:13,362
Alan will know what to do.

302
00:14:21,871 --> 00:14:23,538
Kate.

303
00:14:24,741 --> 00:14:25,841
Sorry. I frightened you.

304
00:14:25,908 --> 00:14:27,676
Anderson.

305
00:14:27,744 --> 00:14:29,144
What are you doing
in New York?

306
00:14:29,211 --> 00:14:31,013
Little trouble with Richard,
I'm afraid.

307
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,580
You haven't heard from him,
have you?

308
00:14:36,328 --> 00:14:38,728
Has Richard been
in contact with you?

309
00:14:39,789 --> 00:14:40,824
No.

310
00:14:41,358 --> 00:14:44,092
Not since Rome. Why?

311
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,461
Well, he's disappeared.

312
00:14:45,529 --> 00:14:48,431
No one at MI6 or the CIA
has heard from him.

313
00:14:48,498 --> 00:14:51,400
He has in his possession
a very valuable microfilm.

314
00:14:51,468 --> 00:14:52,734
If it were to fall
into the wrong hands,

315
00:14:52,802 --> 00:14:54,936
it would be devastating
to both our countries.

316
00:14:55,003 --> 00:14:57,405
Well, do you think
he's all right?

317
00:14:57,473 --> 00:14:59,341
Well, our fear is
that he's gone rogue

318
00:14:59,408 --> 00:15:01,909
and is arranging a sale
to the Russians.

319
00:15:01,977 --> 00:15:03,745
If you hear from him,

320
00:15:03,813 --> 00:15:05,814
call me immediately.

321
00:15:07,316 --> 00:15:08,415
Where?

322
00:15:08,483 --> 00:15:10,083
I'm staying
at the Plaza Hotel.

323
00:15:10,151 --> 00:15:12,919
Either there
or CIA Headquarters.

324
00:15:20,495 --> 00:15:21,428
Richard?

325
00:15:22,664 --> 00:15:25,264
I couldn't make it to the CIA.

326
00:15:25,332 --> 00:15:27,933
I got stopped by someone,

327
00:15:28,001 --> 00:15:30,503
just like you said.

328
00:16:02,768 --> 00:16:04,702
Teddy.

329
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:06,203
Hi, Amanda.

330
00:16:06,271 --> 00:16:08,171
Did you hear about
the Governor?

331
00:16:09,408 --> 00:16:11,509
Do you know how many people
he's married?

332
00:16:11,576 --> 00:16:13,209
None.
We're the first.

333
00:16:13,277 --> 00:16:15,712
Amanda, just, um...

334
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,714
Let me talk.

335
00:16:17,782 --> 00:16:20,049
This isn't easy to say.

336
00:16:20,117 --> 00:16:22,051
Then don't say it.

337
00:16:23,921 --> 00:16:26,890
Come upstairs.

338
00:16:26,957 --> 00:16:28,990
I missed you.

339
00:16:31,294 --> 00:16:33,562
No.

340
00:16:35,465 --> 00:16:38,567
"No"?

341
00:16:38,635 --> 00:16:41,336
I don't understand.

342
00:16:41,404 --> 00:16:43,972
I can't share my wife.

343
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,074
I still want
an old-fashioned marriage.

344
00:16:47,142 --> 00:16:49,076
Fine.

345
00:16:49,144 --> 00:16:54,449
Then I will be
your devoted, faithful wife.

346
00:16:54,516 --> 00:16:58,118
But every morning you'll wake up
wishing I was someone else.

347
00:17:00,755 --> 00:17:03,256
Isn't it
the other way around?

348
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:06,693
This is about Laura,
isn't it?

349
00:17:06,761 --> 00:17:08,695
What? No.

350
00:17:10,465 --> 00:17:12,031
- Amanda, I'm sorry. I-I'm sorry.
- Look, Teddy, don't do this.

351
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:13,433
I...

352
00:17:14,936 --> 00:17:16,902
I can't marry you.

353
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:27,045
Why are you taking
your Pan Am bag?

354
00:17:27,113 --> 00:17:29,648
Gets me the best table
in town.

355
00:17:32,285 --> 00:17:34,752
Amanda.

356
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:35,820
Maggie.

357
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,221
Darn.

358
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:38,556
I was just on my way out.

359
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:40,458
We'll have
to catch up later.

360
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:42,827
Actually, I wanted
to talk to Laura.

361
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:49,600
Amanda, hi.
This is a nice surprise.

362
00:17:51,068 --> 00:17:54,137
I made an investment
in a friendship.

363
00:17:54,205 --> 00:17:57,440
I <i>hope</i> it's about to pay off
in the form of a favor.

364
00:17:57,509 --> 00:18:00,511
Yeah. Of course.
Anything.

365
00:18:00,578 --> 00:18:03,947
I'd like you to be
Ted's mistress.

366
00:18:07,084 --> 00:18:08,684
That's...

367
00:18:08,752 --> 00:18:11,021
The funniest thing
I've ever heard. You...

368
00:18:11,088 --> 00:18:12,822
I'm serious.

369
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:15,691
You can't be.
That's... that's...

370
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:18,961
I-I don't want to be
anyone's mistress.

371
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:22,931
I've noticed the way you two
look at each other.

372
00:18:22,999 --> 00:18:25,200
There's definitely
an attraction.

373
00:18:25,268 --> 00:18:27,669
No. No.
Ted is in love with you.

374
00:18:27,737 --> 00:18:30,372
You're about
to get married.

375
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,674
Look, he's running away
from our wedding.

376
00:18:32,742 --> 00:18:36,545
I think the main reason
is you...

377
00:18:36,612 --> 00:18:40,448
So if it will get
Ted to marry me...

378
00:18:41,616 --> 00:18:43,551
I'm willing to share him.

379
00:18:43,618 --> 00:18:46,387
If Ted's getting cold feet,

380
00:18:46,455 --> 00:18:48,956
this is not the way
to get him back.

381
00:18:49,024 --> 00:18:51,492
No, it'll be perfect.

382
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,326
While I'm home
enjoying the things

383
00:18:53,394 --> 00:18:55,162
that you ran away from,

384
00:18:55,229 --> 00:18:57,964
you and Teddy can be off
circling the globe together.

385
00:18:58,032 --> 00:19:01,168
Those things I ran away from
I still want,

386
00:19:01,235 --> 00:19:04,037
just at the right time
with the right guy.

387
00:19:04,105 --> 00:19:06,206
Well, it won't be
with Teddy.

388
00:19:06,274 --> 00:19:08,841
Fine.

389
00:19:20,387 --> 00:19:25,523
My parents' names were
Oscar and Rachel Valois.

390
00:19:25,591 --> 00:19:28,526
They were
in the French resistance,

391
00:19:28,594 --> 00:19:31,529
killed while fighting
the Nazis.

392
00:19:32,864 --> 00:19:36,201
And you were raised
in an orphanage?

393
00:19:36,268 --> 00:19:39,704
By Ursuline nuns
in Le Chambord.

394
00:19:39,771 --> 00:19:43,240
And you remained in Le Chambord
until you were 23?

395
00:19:43,308 --> 00:19:45,242
Yes.

396
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:48,044
Too long...

397
00:19:48,113 --> 00:19:51,375
Because the one thing I
remembered was my mother saying,

398
00:19:51,376 --> 00:19:53,550
"if you are lost,
stay where you are.

399
00:19:53,618 --> 00:19:56,386
We will find you."

400
00:19:56,454 --> 00:19:58,721
So I stayed,

401
00:19:58,788 --> 00:20:00,556
hoping one day
I would cross the street

402
00:20:00,624 --> 00:20:03,392
and see my mother
buying bread

403
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:07,463
or pass a cafe where my father
was reading the paper...

404
00:20:09,933 --> 00:20:11,567
Even though I was told
they were dead

405
00:20:11,635 --> 00:20:15,570
and I no longer remembered

406
00:20:15,638 --> 00:20:19,241
what they looked like.

407
00:20:19,308 --> 00:20:22,910
I think that's
enough questions for today.

408
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:33,787
There's a bar
around the corner.

409
00:20:33,855 --> 00:20:36,089
Maybe your girlfriend
would be more comfortable

410
00:20:36,158 --> 00:20:37,424
waiting there.

411
00:20:37,492 --> 00:20:39,426
I'm fine right here.

412
00:20:39,494 --> 00:20:42,296
She gets emotional.
You know how women are.

413
00:20:42,364 --> 00:20:45,998
Once they get their claws in,
you're hooked for life.

414
00:20:50,904 --> 00:20:52,705
<i>Onde eles estao?</i>

415
00:20:52,773 --> 00:20:54,707
<i>Fique tranquilo.</i>
<i>Eles estao aqui.</i>

416
00:20:59,513 --> 00:21:01,680
Deal's off.

417
00:21:01,747 --> 00:21:02,714
What the hell are
you doing?

418
00:21:02,782 --> 00:21:04,049
Wait. Wait.
We want to make an offer.

419
00:21:04,116 --> 00:21:05,884
Let's go. <i>Now.</i>

420
00:21:05,951 --> 00:21:07,886
I-I'm sorry.
She's crazy.

421
00:21:07,953 --> 00:21:09,087
I'll be right back.

422
00:21:10,456 --> 00:21:11,390
What the hell are
you doing?

423
00:21:11,457 --> 00:21:12,391
It's a rip-off.

424
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:13,892
How the hell
do you know that?

425
00:21:13,959 --> 00:21:16,728
They were speaking in Portuguese
about stealing the jewels.

426
00:21:16,796 --> 00:21:17,728
That's ridiculous.

427
00:21:34,097 --> 00:21:34,897
Nice people you deal with.

428
00:21:34,964 --> 00:21:36,331
I've never dealt
with 'em before.

429
00:21:36,399 --> 00:21:39,065
- It was set up through a friend.
- Now you tell me.

430
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:40,099
Look, I didn't want you
to be nervous.

431
00:21:40,167 --> 00:21:41,700
You could have
gotten us killed.

432
00:21:41,768 --> 00:21:43,136
It won't happen again,
all right?

433
00:21:43,203 --> 00:21:44,570
Just give me the bag.
I'll come up with another plan.

434
00:21:44,638 --> 00:21:47,306
You do that,
but the jewels stay with me.

435
00:22:00,754 --> 00:22:03,856
Safety tip... don't leave
a key lying around

436
00:22:03,923 --> 00:22:06,358
with a tag
that says "spare key."

437
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:08,493
Where did you go?

438
00:22:08,561 --> 00:22:10,162
Let me sit first.
The room is spinning.

439
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:15,533
I followed you to make sure
you were safe.

440
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,402
I needed to be sure
Anderson didn't double back.

441
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,537
Where's the microfilm,
Richard?

442
00:22:19,604 --> 00:22:23,708
Right here.
Sorry. I had to be sure.

443
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:25,476
So you were testing me?

444
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:26,644
Well, that bottle
in your hand says

445
00:22:26,711 --> 00:22:29,379
you don't completely trust me,
either.

446
00:22:33,617 --> 00:22:36,186
So you knew about Anderson?

447
00:22:36,253 --> 00:22:37,721
Suspected.

448
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:41,191
Ever since the two of you had
that little escapade in London.

449
00:22:41,258 --> 00:22:44,060
He was after the list
for himself.

450
00:22:44,127 --> 00:22:47,597
The Soviets put a premium on it.
Anderson decided to cash in.

451
00:22:47,665 --> 00:22:50,500
Anderson told me that
you're the double agent.

452
00:22:50,568 --> 00:22:54,137
Classic spycraft.
Accuse your accuser.

453
00:22:54,905 --> 00:22:58,674
I came here because I wanted
to trust you, Kate.

454
00:22:59,442 --> 00:23:03,044
Now you have to decide
who you trust.

455
00:23:06,616 --> 00:23:08,517
What am I supposed to do
with this?

456
00:23:08,585 --> 00:23:09,851
Do with what?

457
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:12,354
Amanda
and her ridiculous offer...

458
00:23:12,422 --> 00:23:14,256
Marry her and get me
in the bargain?

459
00:23:14,324 --> 00:23:16,023
I'm sorry. She's just used
to getting her way all the time,

460
00:23:16,091 --> 00:23:17,525
but d-do you really think
that I'd ever accept that

461
00:23:17,593 --> 00:23:20,060
or... or think for a second
that you would?

462
00:23:20,128 --> 00:23:22,463
Why did you call off
the wedding?

463
00:23:22,531 --> 00:23:27,702
To tell the truth,
Amanda is great...

464
00:23:27,769 --> 00:23:29,537
On paper,

465
00:23:29,605 --> 00:23:31,371
a-and I've always...

466
00:23:31,439 --> 00:23:35,275
Wanted someone like her,
o-only not her.

467
00:23:36,444 --> 00:23:38,211
Why not?

468
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:41,448
Well... well, to be perfectly
honest, there's someone else.

469
00:23:43,618 --> 00:23:44,551
There is?

470
00:23:44,619 --> 00:23:46,052
Yeah.

471
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,819
Yeah.

472
00:23:47,887 --> 00:23:51,590
Someone I've, uh, come
to know quite well,

473
00:23:51,658 --> 00:23:54,926
a-and I think I've fallen
in love with her.

474
00:23:56,896 --> 00:24:00,599
And wh-when did this... happen?

475
00:24:00,667 --> 00:24:03,468
I-I don't really know.

476
00:24:03,535 --> 00:24:05,903
She just sorta grew
on me...

477
00:24:08,073 --> 00:24:10,742
Holding a TV antenna out
a window in Jakarta,

478
00:24:10,809 --> 00:24:14,979
watching Jack Kennedy
speak in Berlin.

479
00:24:16,248 --> 00:24:18,516
It's always been
you, Laura,

480
00:24:18,584 --> 00:24:21,351
ever since that first flight
in London.

481
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:23,119
Ted.

482
00:24:23,187 --> 00:24:24,120
I know.

483
00:24:24,188 --> 00:24:25,855
Do you?

484
00:24:25,923 --> 00:24:27,491
Don't I?

485
00:24:46,075 --> 00:24:47,476
During a medical emergency,

486
00:24:47,544 --> 00:24:50,479
I am required to land
at the nearest airport.

487
00:24:50,547 --> 00:24:52,480
In a country hostile
to Americans?

488
00:24:52,548 --> 00:24:54,649
This was
a life-or-death situation.

489
00:24:54,717 --> 00:24:56,484
Not for long.
The passenger died.

490
00:24:56,552 --> 00:25:00,388
Yeah, despite the heroic efforts
of my crew to find a doctor.

491
00:25:00,456 --> 00:25:03,325
You were informed
the airport was closed.

492
00:25:03,392 --> 00:25:05,026
Did they give you
a reason?

493
00:25:06,094 --> 00:25:08,495
I landed without incident,

494
00:25:08,563 --> 00:25:11,665
and I got my passengers
and my aircraft home safely.

495
00:25:11,733 --> 00:25:12,833
We have an affidavit

496
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:16,337
from a Pan Am passenger,
Miguel Ortiz.

497
00:25:16,404 --> 00:25:18,405
He claims
you threatened him

498
00:25:18,473 --> 00:25:21,875
and that your decision
to take the refugee was based

499
00:25:21,943 --> 00:25:23,176
on a personal relationship

500
00:25:23,244 --> 00:25:27,947
with one of your crew...
Colette Valois.

501
00:25:31,084 --> 00:25:34,186
In the end,
I made the decision

502
00:25:34,254 --> 00:25:37,189
that I felt was right.

503
00:25:40,927 --> 00:25:42,862
Sorry I didn't call first.

504
00:25:42,929 --> 00:25:45,297
I was trying to avoid
another setup.

505
00:25:45,365 --> 00:25:46,999
What are you doing here?

506
00:25:47,067 --> 00:25:48,367
Where is captain Broyles?

507
00:25:48,434 --> 00:25:52,037
He gets <i>so</i> emotional.
You know how men are.

508
00:25:52,105 --> 00:25:55,140
Women are much more practical,
don't you think?

509
00:25:55,208 --> 00:25:57,275
I'm willing to forgive
and forget.

510
00:25:57,343 --> 00:25:59,310
What are you proposing?

511
00:25:59,378 --> 00:26:02,847
Well, you still want to buy
the jewels, don't you?

512
00:26:02,915 --> 00:26:04,349
Very much.

513
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:06,050
<i>Vamos fazer negocios.</i>

514
00:26:12,056 --> 00:26:13,290
How?

515
00:26:13,358 --> 00:26:15,658
Surprise is
a great negotiator.

516
00:26:15,726 --> 00:26:17,127
Isn't it beautiful?

517
00:26:17,195 --> 00:26:19,196
Even more so
with you on top of it.

518
00:26:40,417 --> 00:26:43,085
That painting is beautiful.

519
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:48,957
The background investigation
has revealed something.

520
00:26:49,025 --> 00:26:51,092
Am I an escaped murderer?

521
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:55,964
Your name is not the same
as your parents.

522
00:26:56,032 --> 00:26:58,967
How could that be?

523
00:26:59,035 --> 00:27:01,468
No, your investigators
made a mistake.

524
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:03,137
No mistake.

525
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:07,308
The nuns changed your name
to protect you and themselves.

526
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:09,176
But why?

527
00:27:09,244 --> 00:27:12,146
Because they would have been
killed for sheltering

528
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:14,815
a child
with the name Halevy.

529
00:27:16,383 --> 00:27:18,284
It is a Jewish name.

530
00:27:19,553 --> 00:27:22,155
My parents were Jewish?

531
00:27:22,222 --> 00:27:23,923
Yes.

532
00:27:23,991 --> 00:27:26,259
They weren't
part of the resistance?

533
00:27:26,327 --> 00:27:30,296
Maybe. I don't know,
but that is not how they died.

534
00:27:30,364 --> 00:27:32,565
How?

535
00:27:33,733 --> 00:27:34,667
Does it matter?

536
00:27:34,734 --> 00:27:36,769
How did they die?

537
00:27:39,405 --> 00:27:40,873
Dachau.

538
00:27:47,563 --> 00:27:51,566
I stayed awake all night
wondering how I would tell you.

539
00:27:51,834 --> 00:27:55,336
All my life,
I've only known lies...

540
00:27:55,903 --> 00:27:58,071
Even my own name.

541
00:27:59,574 --> 00:28:02,576
This doesn't change
who you are now.

542
00:28:02,643 --> 00:28:07,914
No, but it changes us,
doesn't it?

543
00:28:10,918 --> 00:28:13,352
Here.

544
00:28:14,588 --> 00:28:16,421
Look at this.

545
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,862
- Is this... 
- Your family.

546
00:28:22,929 --> 00:28:27,032
It was taken by the friends
who gave you to the orphanage.

547
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:30,001
But there's a baby.

548
00:28:30,469 --> 00:28:32,203
A boy.

549
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:33,872
He was adopted
from the orphanage

550
00:28:33,939 --> 00:28:36,240
a few days
after you both arrived.

551
00:28:36,308 --> 00:28:39,477
We tried to locate him,
but couldn't.

552
00:28:41,881 --> 00:28:44,781
I had a brother.

553
00:28:44,849 --> 00:28:47,551
You still have a brother.

554
00:28:47,619 --> 00:28:50,387
As far as we know,
he survived.

555
00:29:01,965 --> 00:29:04,067
One of the conditions
to settle the lawsuit

556
00:29:04,135 --> 00:29:07,337
with Mr. Belson's family is
that you be terminated.

557
00:29:07,405 --> 00:29:10,173
Although you were acting
under extreme circumstances...

558
00:29:11,242 --> 00:29:13,443
Permission to speak.

559
00:29:13,511 --> 00:29:16,345
Of course, captain Broyles.

560
00:29:16,413 --> 00:29:18,147
On the subject of Haiti,

561
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:20,949
captain Lowrey left that body
behind to ensure the safety

562
00:29:21,017 --> 00:29:23,352
of his passengers,
by the book.

563
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,953
Not Pan Am's book.

564
00:29:25,021 --> 00:29:26,188
Then I suggest an addendum.

565
00:29:26,256 --> 00:29:27,489
But he took on a stowaway.

566
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:29,358
Once she was on board,
she was his passenger, too.

567
00:29:29,426 --> 00:29:31,427
It was his duty to protect her.

568
00:29:31,494 --> 00:29:33,027
And I talked to his navigator.

569
00:29:33,095 --> 00:29:34,328
That takeoff
out of Port-au-Prince was

570
00:29:34,396 --> 00:29:36,030
a thing of beauty.

571
00:29:36,098 --> 00:29:37,198
Instead of standing here
being judged,

572
00:29:37,266 --> 00:29:39,700
captain Lowrey ought to be showing
other Pan Am pilots how it's done.

573
00:29:39,768 --> 00:29:41,769
At a party in Rome,

574
00:29:41,836 --> 00:29:44,038
didn't captain Lowrey
assault you?

575
00:29:44,106 --> 00:29:45,139
Justified.

576
00:29:45,207 --> 00:29:48,208
I would have hit me, too,
and harder.

577
00:29:48,276 --> 00:29:49,443
That's all I have to say.

578
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:51,211
Thank you, captain Broyles,

579
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:54,047
for your... testimony.
If that's all...

580
00:29:54,115 --> 00:29:55,315
It's not.

581
00:29:56,650 --> 00:30:00,287
Addressed to you,
from Juan Trippe.

582
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:05,291
You may want to read that now.

583
00:30:05,358 --> 00:30:08,060
That's from Maggie,

584
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:09,728
and I want a rematch.

585
00:30:09,796 --> 00:30:10,829
You're on.

586
00:30:18,305 --> 00:30:21,206
Well, you're very fortunate,
captain Lowrey.

587
00:30:21,273 --> 00:30:24,509
It seems that Mr. Trippe has made
an investment in your future,

588
00:30:24,577 --> 00:30:28,079
and taking this
and captain Broyles' testimony

589
00:30:28,147 --> 00:30:29,514
into consideration,

590
00:30:29,582 --> 00:30:32,083
you will not be terminated
at this time.

591
00:30:32,151 --> 00:30:33,751
Thank you.

592
00:30:33,819 --> 00:30:35,186
However,
your flying privileges

593
00:30:35,254 --> 00:30:36,988
will be suspended
for six months.

594
00:30:37,055 --> 00:30:39,657
There'll be a plane
waiting for you in June.

595
00:30:39,725 --> 00:30:43,193
Consider yourself
very lucky, Captain.

596
00:30:44,596 --> 00:30:45,896
Thank you, gentlemen.

597
00:30:59,176 --> 00:31:00,276
Is everything okay?

598
00:31:00,344 --> 00:31:01,711
Yeah.
You pulled me out of a meeting.

599
00:31:01,779 --> 00:31:03,847
I called off the wedding.

600
00:31:03,914 --> 00:31:06,850
Amanda wasn't the right woman,
so it's over.

601
00:31:06,917 --> 00:31:08,251
What are you talking about?
She's perfect for you.

602
00:31:08,318 --> 00:31:11,520
No, she's perfect for... for
that plan you have for me,

603
00:31:11,587 --> 00:31:13,188
but I don't need that plan.

604
00:31:13,256 --> 00:31:14,690
I've got Laura.

605
00:31:14,758 --> 00:31:15,958
Who's... who's Laura?

606
00:31:16,026 --> 00:31:18,727
The woman I love,
and it turns out, she loves

607
00:31:18,795 --> 00:31:20,595
your huge disappointment
of a son, too.

608
00:31:20,664 --> 00:31:22,430
I never said you were
a disappointment.

609
00:31:22,498 --> 00:31:24,599
You didn't have to.

610
00:31:24,667 --> 00:31:26,834
Just wait. Think about it.
I'll come by the house.

611
00:31:26,902 --> 00:31:27,902
Let's talk.

612
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:31,939
Tell mom I'm sorry.

613
00:31:32,975 --> 00:31:35,143
Happy New Year, pop.

614
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:39,080
Edward, we're not done here.

615
00:31:39,148 --> 00:31:41,447
Edward.

616
00:31:58,031 --> 00:32:01,000
I talked to Richard.

617
00:32:01,068 --> 00:32:02,001
Where is he?

618
00:32:02,069 --> 00:32:05,037
My apartment,
asleep on my couch.

619
00:32:05,105 --> 00:32:06,205
He trusts me.

620
00:32:06,272 --> 00:32:09,041
Good. All right. Stay here.

621
00:32:09,109 --> 00:32:12,477
I've got to get to him
before he contacts the Soviets.

622
00:32:12,545 --> 00:32:14,913
Anderson, it doesn't matter
if he does.

623
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:18,049
I have the microfilm.

624
00:32:18,117 --> 00:32:19,517
I lifted it
from his pocket.

625
00:32:19,585 --> 00:32:21,886
Good girl.

626
00:32:21,954 --> 00:32:23,722
I knew I could count
on you.

627
00:32:23,789 --> 00:32:25,323
Give it to me.
I'll keep it safe.

628
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:28,559
Just one thing.
The mission in London...

629
00:32:28,627 --> 00:32:32,530
Why me
and not a female MI6 agent?

630
00:32:32,598 --> 00:32:36,166
We can talk about that later.
Just give me the microfilm.

631
00:32:36,235 --> 00:32:39,370
They're trained agents.
I'm a stewardess.

632
00:32:39,438 --> 00:32:41,839
Don't undervalue
your abilities.

633
00:32:41,906 --> 00:32:44,074
A worldwide
intelligence agency

634
00:32:44,142 --> 00:32:46,509
is looking
for that microfilm,

635
00:32:46,577 --> 00:32:48,010
and you were the one
to retrieve it.

636
00:32:48,078 --> 00:32:50,913
Now I must insist
that you give it to me.

637
00:32:53,083 --> 00:32:55,385
Let's take it
to CIA Headquarters...

638
00:32:55,453 --> 00:32:56,386
Together.

639
00:32:56,454 --> 00:32:57,721
Kate, this is not a game.

640
00:32:57,788 --> 00:32:59,356
Are you sure?

641
00:33:01,125 --> 00:33:04,526
What are you gonna do?

642
00:33:04,594 --> 00:33:06,528
Are you gonna shoot me
in front of all these people?

643
00:33:06,596 --> 00:33:08,130
It's easily explained.

644
00:33:08,197 --> 00:33:11,367
The Soviets turned you
when you were in Moscow.

645
00:33:11,434 --> 00:33:14,370
You shot Richard.
You stole the microfilm.

646
00:33:14,437 --> 00:33:18,706
I caught you.
Unfortunately, you resisted.

647
00:33:26,448 --> 00:33:32,387
All right. Let's go.
A little unfinished business.

648
00:33:34,255 --> 00:33:35,422
Get on the ground!

649
00:33:37,292 --> 00:33:39,225
I'm a special agent for MI6!

650
00:33:39,294 --> 00:33:41,461
I'm arresting that woman
for espionage! She's a spy!

651
00:33:44,732 --> 00:33:47,000
I hate to break it to you.

652
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:48,968
We're all spies.

653
00:33:51,905 --> 00:33:55,073
This is how I always
want to remember you, Anderson.

654
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:04,082
Get up.

655
00:34:17,162 --> 00:34:18,095
Amanda.

656
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:23,200
You know,
at my summer home...

657
00:34:25,269 --> 00:34:27,371
I used to push you
off the dock

658
00:34:27,439 --> 00:34:28,706
just to see you cry.

659
00:34:30,942 --> 00:34:33,610
I'm a better swimmer now.

660
00:34:35,012 --> 00:34:39,114
I'm the one being thrown
in the deep end.

661
00:34:39,182 --> 00:34:41,417
Amanda.

662
00:34:41,485 --> 00:34:42,918
We talked about this.

663
00:34:42,986 --> 00:34:45,555
There's been
a slight detour.

664
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:52,328
I've just come
from the doctor.

665
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:56,931
I'm pregnant, Teddy.

666
00:34:58,234 --> 00:35:01,236
Well, don't just
stand there.

667
00:35:01,303 --> 00:35:04,005
You're... you're gonna be
a father.

668
00:35:04,073 --> 00:35:05,240
Hug me.

669
00:35:11,246 --> 00:35:12,847
We'll get married right away.

670
00:35:12,914 --> 00:35:14,782
You'll see.

671
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:17,617
This is the best thing
that could have happened.

672
00:35:34,526 --> 00:35:37,061
What are you doing here?

673
00:35:37,128 --> 00:35:38,062
It's New Year's Eve.

674
00:35:38,129 --> 00:35:40,966
Don't you have a party
to run off to?

675
00:35:42,133 --> 00:35:44,701
I do.

676
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:47,604
I couldn't leave you here
all alone.

677
00:35:47,672 --> 00:35:48,738
Well, for people
in our business,

678
00:35:48,806 --> 00:35:51,541
alone is our natural state.

679
00:35:56,814 --> 00:35:59,916
You have come a long way
from the stewardess

680
00:35:59,983 --> 00:36:02,618
who didn't think
she could switch a passport.

681
00:36:02,686 --> 00:36:06,255
That was a lifetime ago.

682
00:36:06,323 --> 00:36:10,426
My biggest problem was my sister
on the cover of a magazine,

683
00:36:10,493 --> 00:36:13,262
my parents were the enemy...

684
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:17,165
And this country
was Camelot.

685
00:36:17,233 --> 00:36:19,267
The world has changed.

686
00:36:19,335 --> 00:36:22,270
It's getting more dangerous
every day.

687
00:36:22,338 --> 00:36:24,973
That's why we need
people like you.

688
00:36:25,041 --> 00:36:27,575
You have me.

689
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:30,212
Right now, like most women
who work for us,

690
00:36:30,279 --> 00:36:32,613
you're just an asset,

691
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,414
but that is about
to change.

692
00:36:34,482 --> 00:36:38,585
We want you to become
a real agent, Kate.

693
00:36:38,653 --> 00:36:40,888
You'll have to go
through training at Langley.

694
00:36:40,956 --> 00:36:43,090
A new class starts
next month.

695
00:36:43,158 --> 00:36:44,925
What about Pan Am?

696
00:36:44,993 --> 00:36:48,762
Life is all about
making choices.

697
00:36:54,034 --> 00:36:56,903
Happy New Year, Richard.

698
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:02,776
As we speak, little Teddy Jr.
is growing inside of her.

699
00:37:02,843 --> 00:37:04,910
A-a guy has gotta do
the right thing, right?

700
00:37:04,978 --> 00:37:07,246
Yeah, absolutely.

701
00:37:07,313 --> 00:37:09,748
Man.

702
00:37:09,816 --> 00:37:11,250
What am I gonna do
in that right seat

703
00:37:11,317 --> 00:37:13,952
for six months
without you in the left?

704
00:37:18,424 --> 00:37:19,557
What's your gut
telling you?

705
00:37:19,625 --> 00:37:21,225
That I've had too many
of those.

706
00:37:21,293 --> 00:37:22,226
Yeah?

707
00:37:22,294 --> 00:37:23,795
Good. Have another.

708
00:37:23,862 --> 00:37:25,329
Boy.

709
00:37:32,671 --> 00:37:35,206
What does the gut know
anyway?

710
00:37:35,274 --> 00:37:36,840
It keeps changing its mind.

711
00:37:36,908 --> 00:37:38,074
Until Colette.

712
00:37:39,777 --> 00:37:41,912
Yeah. Until Colette.

713
00:37:41,979 --> 00:37:43,046
You're gonna get her back.

714
00:37:43,114 --> 00:37:45,882
No. She's gonna be
a princess.

715
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:47,050
No.

716
00:37:47,118 --> 00:37:48,418
No, no, no, no, no, no.

717
00:37:48,485 --> 00:37:51,521
The royal courtship
is kaput.

718
00:37:51,588 --> 00:37:52,888
- It's what?
- It's over.

719
00:37:52,956 --> 00:37:55,557
- When?
- Last night. Laura told me.

720
00:37:55,625 --> 00:37:57,259
The runway's clear,
my friend.

721
00:37:57,327 --> 00:38:00,062
Yeah, but, see, she'd still
have to forgive me.

722
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:03,065
- Right.
- That's highly doubtful.

723
00:38:03,133 --> 00:38:05,468
At least you have a chance.

724
00:38:08,137 --> 00:38:10,238
I'm gonna be a father

725
00:38:10,306 --> 00:38:12,073
and lose Laura forever.

726
00:38:14,476 --> 00:38:16,244
Hell.

727
00:38:18,147 --> 00:38:19,747
It's New Year's Eve.

728
00:38:21,317 --> 00:38:22,250
Tomorrow's a new year.

729
00:38:23,319 --> 00:38:25,018
Yeah.

730
00:38:25,086 --> 00:38:26,353
He's 21.

731
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:28,922
He might in college.
He might be married.

732
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:30,423
I might be an aunt.

733
00:38:31,492 --> 00:38:33,560
You lose a prince.
You gain a brother.

734
00:38:33,627 --> 00:38:34,862
Without knowing it,

735
00:38:34,929 --> 00:38:36,864
I think all my life
I've been looking for him,

736
00:38:36,931 --> 00:38:40,032
but all I seemed to find were
the men I shouldn't have.

737
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,201
Those kind are
easier to find.

738
00:38:42,269 --> 00:38:44,036
Yes. You know, sometimes
the right one's right there

739
00:38:44,104 --> 00:38:45,771
under your nose,
and you just don't know it.

740
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:46,973
Until he's gone.

741
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,607
Or you wish they were.-

742
00:38:48,675 --> 00:38:51,810
Where's Ted and Dean?
The ball's gonna drop in a minute.

743
00:38:51,879 --> 00:38:52,811
Who needs more champagne?

744
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,812
Me.

745
00:38:53,881 --> 00:38:55,248
Me.

746
00:38:56,315 --> 00:38:58,549
Maggie.

747
00:38:58,617 --> 00:39:00,585
Did you pilfer all
those bottles from Pan Am?

748
00:39:00,652 --> 00:39:01,586
No!

749
00:39:01,653 --> 00:39:03,889
This is legitimate cargo.

750
00:39:03,956 --> 00:39:04,890
<i>Really?</i>

751
00:39:04,957 --> 00:39:07,292
I recently came
into a little money.

752
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,127
Thank you.

753
00:39:09,195 --> 00:39:10,628
- A toast.
- Yeah, yeah.

754
00:39:10,696 --> 00:39:14,198
To Pan Am,
for bringing us all together.

755
00:39:14,266 --> 00:39:15,565
Pan Am.

756
00:39:18,236 --> 00:39:19,236
- Hey.

757
00:39:19,304 --> 00:39:20,304
- They're here!
- Hey.

758
00:39:20,372 --> 00:39:21,471
- Voila.
-  Traffic was crazy.

759
00:39:21,539 --> 00:39:22,472
Hi.

760
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:23,740
Hey.

761
00:39:26,311 --> 00:39:27,444
When did that happen?

762
00:39:27,512 --> 00:39:30,446
Isn't he engaged
to somebody else?

763
00:39:30,514 --> 00:39:33,849
To Amanda. She kissed me.

764
00:39:33,918 --> 00:39:34,918
- What?
- What?

765
00:39:34,985 --> 00:39:36,920
On the mouth.
It wasn't half bad.

766
00:39:40,157 --> 00:39:41,925
Congratulations.

767
00:39:41,992 --> 00:39:44,126
I hear you're still
a Pan Am pilot.

768
00:39:44,193 --> 00:39:47,762
Yeah...
With a 6-month suspension.

769
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:49,264
Well, still better
than being fired.

770
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:53,501
Sorry about...
you and the prince.

771
00:39:53,569 --> 00:39:54,602
Don't be.

772
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:55,804
I'm not.

773
00:39:58,674 --> 00:40:01,142
That's my family.

774
00:40:01,209 --> 00:40:03,177
That's me standing in front
of my father.

775
00:40:05,013 --> 00:40:07,315
Well, who's, uh,
who's the boy?

776
00:40:07,382 --> 00:40:10,784
That's my brother.

777
00:40:10,852 --> 00:40:13,054
Tomorrow I start looking
for him.

778
00:40:14,122 --> 00:40:15,489
Let me help you.

779
00:40:15,557 --> 00:40:17,490
- Dean.
-  Come on.

780
00:40:17,558 --> 00:40:20,108
Hey,
it just so happens

781
00:40:20,109 --> 00:40:22,462
that I have six
months off of work.

782
00:40:22,529 --> 00:40:24,297
Come on. Please.

783
00:40:25,899 --> 00:40:27,700
I missed you.

784
00:40:27,768 --> 00:40:30,303
Listen, uh,

785
00:40:30,371 --> 00:40:31,704
Laura, I have to tell you
something.

786
00:40:31,772 --> 00:40:33,473
Hey, everybody!
The countdown's about to begin.

787
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:35,407
Tell me next year.

788
00:40:35,476 --> 00:40:36,809
- Let's watch the ball drop.
- All right. Okay.

789
00:40:48,288 --> 00:40:51,089
Thank you.

790
00:40:51,156 --> 00:40:54,092
Good-bye, 1963.

791
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:56,862
- It was the best of times.
- It was the worst of times.

792
00:40:56,929 --> 00:40:58,897
I loved
every minute of it.

793
00:40:58,965 --> 00:40:59,898
I love us.

794
00:40:59,966 --> 00:41:02,601
And this. I love this.

795
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:04,102
I hope that ball never lands.

796
00:41:11,897 --> 00:41:13,631
Happy new year.

797
00:41:16,735 --> 00:41:18,503
<i>Happy New Year, everybody.</i>

798
00:41:18,571 --> 00:41:22,040
<i>A very Happy New Year.</i>
