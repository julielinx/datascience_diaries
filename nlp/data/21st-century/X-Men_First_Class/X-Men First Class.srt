Mother?

00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:10,624
What were you...

7
00:02:11,513 --> 00:02:13,011
I thought you're a burglar.

8
00:02:13,703 --> 00:02:15,535
I didn't meant to scare you, darling.

9
00:02:15,536 --> 00:02:16,856
I was just getting a snack.

10

And what have you done

00:02:36,675 --> 00:02:39,819
My mother has never set
her foot in the kitchen in her life.

17
00:02:41,425 --> 00:02:43,913
And she certainly,
never made me hot chocolate.

18

Unless you can order me, made to do it.

19

You're not..
Scared of me?

20
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:10,498
I was believed I can't be
the only one in the world.

00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:12,895

<i>I can not..
I do not..</i>

51
00:05:23,904 --> 00:05:25,165
<i>It's impossible.</i>

52
00:05:27,782 --> 00:05:33,097
<i>The only thing I can say in favor of the Nazis,
is that thier methods are producing results.</i>

<i>And you'll move the coin.</i>

<i>If you don't move the coin,
I'll pull the trigger.</i>

- Emmy.

87
00:09:56,861 --> 00:09:59,753
Heterochromia, is a reference to your eyes,
which I have to say...

88
00:09:59,909 --> 00:10:01,026
Astounding!

89
00:10:01,415 --> 00:10:03,154
One green, one blue...

90
00:10:03,155 --> 00:10:04,193
It's a mutation.

It's a very groovy a mutation,
I've could use it for you, Emmy.

You are a mutated.

and then you go to deform it.

How is that seduction
technique working for you?

95
00:10:14,604 --> 00:10:16,098
I'll tell you tomorrow morning.

No, no.. Seriously, you must've knocked it.

97

Raven, get your coat, please!

116
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:12,373
Don't talk to me!
You did that on purpose.

117
00:11:12,374 --> 00:11:13,288
I did not!

118
00:11:13,485 --> 00:11:16,031
Why would I do it on purpose?
You know I can't control it some times.

119
00:11:16,157 --> 00:11:17,235
If I was stressed or tired...

120
00:11:17,236 --> 00:11:19,098
It's been a qutie good job, right now!

If you're a freak,
you better hide!

124
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:28,864
You are being ridiculous.

125
00:11:29,768 --> 00:11:31,486
I didn't meant to sound like an old faulter.

126
00:11:31,487 --> 00:11:32,444
Which you are.

127
00:11:33,248 --> 00:11:33,955
Sometimes.

128
00:11:34,525 --> 00:11:35,908
But we talked about this, Raven.

129
00:11:36,506 --> 00:11:40,185
Small slate postpone is nothing,
a big one does not barred thinking about.

130

00:12:40,953 --> 00:12:43,555
- And.. But, if you did not know?
- Unfortunately, I do know you.

147
00:12:43,556 --> 00:12:46,497
God! What's got into you?
You got something with your look!

148
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:53,291
I'm sleepy.
Would you read for me?

149
00:12:53,418 --> 00:12:55,808
No! I have my tests coming.
I have to study.

To Homo Neanderthalensis,

151
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:04,356

<i>Peacful cohabitation, if ever existed.</i>

153
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,759

159
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:33,692

160
00:13:34,769 --> 00:13:35,849
<i>From the others.</i>

161
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:38,700

<i>Thank you.</i>

182
00:15:06,576 --> 00:15:09,068
<i>I'm pleased to kill you.</i>

183
00:15:13,077 --> 00:15:14,115
<i>So, remember..</i>

184
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:18,461
<i>If you warn him about me..</i>

185
00:15:20,136 --> 00:15:21,462
<i>I will find you.</i>

186
00:15:25,248 --> 00:15:29,234
<i>Las Vegas, Nevada</i>

187
00:15:34,084 --> 00:15:35,969
Another day at the office.

188
00:15:36,579 --> 00:15:38,005
Is that Colonel Hendry?

189
00:15:38,515 --> 00:15:39,810
You mean our guy?

190
00:15:40,043 --> 00:15:40,736
Yeah.

191
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,144
Yes it is!

192
00:15:43,784 --> 00:15:47,932
And those are three Mafia bosses, the Italian
Ambassador and the senior of Lockheed.

193
00:15:48,361 --> 00:15:48,972
They're may be a Communists?

194
00:15:50,172 --> 00:15:52,435
What's that club?
There must be something else.

195
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:55,586
Do you see that?

196
00:15:56,817 --> 00:15:58,241
Hello, girls!

197
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:00,878
Wow! Yeah!
Nice!

198
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:03,813
What.. What're you doing?

199
00:16:04,406 --> 00:16:06,452
Using some equipment,
that CIA didn't give me.

200
00:16:06,987 --> 00:16:07,855
Saty close.

201
00:16:11,064 --> 00:16:13,134
- Are you Hendry?
- Yes, ma'am!

202
00:16:13,135 --> 00:16:16,182
Emma Frost,
Sebastian Shaw's associater.

203
00:16:17,284 --> 00:16:19,447
And where is Mr. Shaw?

204
00:16:19,448 --> 00:16:20,575
We're having a party.

205
00:16:20,576 --> 00:16:22,161
And amusing entertainment.

206
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:24,107
Come with me.

207
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:36,221
Hoo-hoo!

208
00:17:03,094 --> 00:17:07,038
- Hello, beautiful. How're you?
- Hi, baby? You wanna have fun in quiet place?

209
00:17:07,535 --> 00:17:10,407
I'm so sorry!
I've been booked by Colonel Hendry.

210
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:13,722
Excuse me!

211
00:17:34,633 --> 00:17:36,507
Make sure, we can't get you a refill, Bob?

212
00:17:37,187 --> 00:17:37,839
No.

213
00:17:38,411 --> 00:17:43,350
So, I heard you blocked a proposal
to possession the Jupiter missiles in Turkey.

214
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,329
I expected you reconsider.

215
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:48,369
We've have this conversation.

216
00:17:49,707 --> 00:17:53,349
You'll put our missiles in Turkey,
or anywhere that close to Russia.

217
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:55,488
And you're looking at war.

218
00:17:55,845 --> 00:17:57,278
Nuclear war!

219
00:18:30,241 --> 00:18:31,505
I do not ask for favors, Colonel.

220
00:18:31,506 --> 00:18:33,595
I express my expectations.

221
00:18:34,354 --> 00:18:35,341
So..

222
00:18:35,723 --> 00:18:36,958
Let me say it again..

223
00:18:38,194 --> 00:18:40,952
I expect you reconsider.

224
00:18:41,402 --> 00:18:43,999
The only thing I will reconsider..

225
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,150
Is having another glass of
that delicious Champagne.

226
00:18:59,749 --> 00:19:02,473
What the hell did you put in my drink?

227
00:19:19,832 --> 00:19:21,428
You think you would running?

228
00:19:21,965 --> 00:19:22,660
Hiding?

229
00:19:23,165 --> 00:19:24,499
We've found you, Hendry.

230
00:19:25,068 --> 00:19:27,731
There is not a fortress in the world,
that could keep us out.

231
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,700
Isn't she, Bob?

232
00:19:48,707 --> 00:19:50,241
Genetic mutation.

233
00:19:50,242 --> 00:19:52,379
The evolution of the human gene!

234
00:19:52,806 --> 00:19:54,269
Where is Azazel?

235
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,230
We do not want the colonel to delay.

236
00:20:06,265 --> 00:20:07,450
Forward.

237
00:20:10,486 --> 00:20:12,750
Missiles in Turkey
send a very clear message.

238
00:20:12,751 --> 00:20:16,701
We ever decide to fire them, the Russianly
warning system will not have time to kick in!

239
00:20:16,953 --> 00:20:17,741
It's better be important, MacTaggert.

240
00:20:18,577 --> 00:20:19,946
Wow, wow, wow.. Slow down!

241
00:20:21,158 --> 00:20:23,534
Have you smoked any funny cigarettes?
People do not disappear!

242
00:20:23,673 --> 00:20:24,968
Colonel Hendry was there.

243
00:20:24,969 --> 00:20:27,064
He was there Micon.
In the Hellfire Club.

244
00:20:27,065 --> 00:20:28,138
Colonel Hendry?

245
00:20:28,711 --> 00:20:29,749
I agree with you general!

246
00:20:30,209 --> 00:20:35,434
I reconsidered by possession, and know
I believe we should put Jupiter missiles in Turkey

247
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:36,781
Colonel Hendry is here.

248
00:20:36,782 --> 00:20:40,239
So unless he naturaly traveled
3000 miles in the last 10 minutes.

249
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:40,867
So, listen to me..

250
00:20:41,012 --> 00:20:43,181
I suggest, that you stop wasting my time.

251
00:20:43,503 --> 00:20:45,985
Looks like Hendry wants
to start World War III.

252
00:20:46,143 --> 00:20:48,246
I have better things to do right now, MacTaggert!

253
00:20:48,554 --> 00:20:49,680
Sarge, I..

254
00:20:50,195 --> 00:20:51,197
God!

255
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:52,237
You lost your mind?

256
00:20:53,336 --> 00:20:54,886
So, now what?

257
00:20:56,683 --> 00:20:58,793
We'll find an expert in genetics mutations.

258
00:21:00,202 --> 00:21:04,543
<i>Professor of genetic,
Charles Francis Xavier.</i>

259
00:21:06,714 --> 00:21:09,471
So, how is your feels to be a Professor?

260
00:21:09,472 --> 00:21:10,223
No, don't call me that.

261
00:21:10,224 --> 00:21:13,069
You don't get to be cool as professor,
until you have the teaching possession

262
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,162
I know, but..

263
00:21:14,163 --> 00:21:16,283
<i>No, don't say that!
You say Let's go and have a drink</i>

264
00:21:16,284 --> 00:21:17,100
- Let's go and have a drink
- One little.

265
00:21:30,345 --> 00:21:34,153
<i>Villa Gesell, Argentina</i>

266
00:21:45,667 --> 00:21:48,639
<i>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

267
00:21:49,579 --> 00:21:50,403

<i>Yes, it's Bitburger.

273
00:22:27,682 --> 00:22:29,256
<i>Could not be better.</i>

274
00:22:34,527 --> 00:22:36,605
<i>What brought you to Argentina?</i>

275
00:22:38,221 --> 00:22:42,185
<i>Climate.
I live the weather.</i>

276

<i>I am a tailor.
Have been my whole life.</i>

277

<i>My father sewed the best
costumes in Dusseldorf.</i>

278
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,445
<i>My parents are from Dusseldorf.</i>

<i>What are their names?</i>

280
00:22:59,184 --> 00:23:00,497
<i>They had not names.</i>

281
00:23:02,321 --> 00:23:04,251
<i>Their names were selected..</i>

282
00:23:05,035 --> 00:23:05,971
<i>Breeders..</i>

283
00:23:07,201 --> 00:23:08,454
<i>And tailors.</i>

284

<i>We carried out the orders..</i>

287

<i>Who are you?</i>

291
00:24:15,404 --> 00:24:17,934
Let's just say,
I'm Frankenstein's monster.

292
00:24:29,955 --> 00:24:32,079
And I'm looking for my creator.

293
00:24:36,794 --> 00:24:44,191

Congratulations, Professor!

298
00:25:05,861 --> 00:25:06,968
Thank you very much.

299
00:25:06,969 --> 00:25:08,587
It's much harder than it looks like.

300
00:25:08,582 --> 00:25:09,585
No! I mean on your presentation.

301
00:25:09,586 --> 00:25:10,544

For a pretty little beenig,
MCI-1 gene, I have 5.

306
00:25:20,099 --> 00:25:21,857
I say, MCI-1.
You would say, golden hair!

307
00:25:25,147 --> 00:25:26,529
It's a mutation.

308
00:25:26,793 --> 00:25:28,345
It's very groovy mutation.

309
00:25:28,748 --> 00:25:30,234
Mutation, right?

310
00:25:30,235 --> 00:25:34,768
Two kinds from single cell organisms,
to the dominant form..

311
00:25:34,769 --> 00:25:37,660
You know, this routine make
over greate with colleges..

were talking about in your dissert..

I need to know if they
maight've already happened.

Professor?

320
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,404
I think we should just talk
when you're foresighted.

321
00:26:09,518 --> 00:26:10,456
Do you have any time tomorrow?

322
00:26:12,572 --> 00:26:16,109
Something tells me, you already
know the answer of your question.

Okay, will.. So much for the pleasantries.

329
00:26:35,536 --> 00:26:36,258
I was wondering..

Who you told about our
little arrangement?

331
00:26:39,213 --> 00:26:39,926
No one.

00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:24,747
Uh.. Please, sit down,
Agent MacTaggert

360
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:27,965
Hasn't really expected you to believe me.

361
00:28:28,378 --> 00:28:30,214
Even that all you think about in
regarding the presentation,

362
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:32,743
what thought of it as a pie in
serving at the cafeteria.

363
00:28:33,808 --> 00:28:34,847
It's apple and pecans.

364
00:28:35,872 --> 00:28:37,899
I have been entirely honest with you enough,
I'm sorry.

365
00:28:38,056 --> 00:28:39,183
You see...

366
00:28:39,184 --> 00:28:42,890
One of the many spectacular things
that mind mutation allows me to do..

367
00:28:43,061 --> 00:28:44,559
Is that I can read your mind!

368
00:28:45,378 --> 00:28:47,116
I've seen this before in a magic show.

369
00:28:47,634 --> 00:28:50,822
Are you gonna ask us to think of
a number between 1 and 10, now?

370
00:28:51,598 --> 00:28:53,312
No, Mr. Stryker. It's old.

371
00:28:53,691 --> 00:28:55,722
I could ask you about your son, William.

372
00:28:55,723 --> 00:28:57,390
That you're thinking about.
Which is very nice.

373
00:28:57,813 --> 00:29:00,150
But, I think I would to ask you
about the Jupiter missiles..

374
00:29:00,314 --> 00:29:02,353
That America currently placing it, in Turkey.

375
00:29:04,029 --> 00:29:07,029
He's a goddamn spy!
You brought a goddmaned spy!

376
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:10,165
I will not.. I would never do that!

377
00:29:28,087 --> 00:29:29,511
How is that for a magic trick?

378
00:29:32,705 --> 00:29:34,004
Best than I ever seen!

379
00:29:35,463 --> 00:29:36,761
I want them out of here.

380
00:29:37,522 --> 00:29:40,006
And lock down,
untile I can figure out what to do.

381
00:29:41,174 --> 00:29:42,416
My facility has a space.

382
00:29:44,256 --> 00:29:45,090
I take them.

383
00:29:46,995 --> 00:29:47,839
I can't believe this.

384
00:29:47,991 --> 00:29:50,288
I didn't thought the director
of CIA having a commissar.

385
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:51,791
We sould be going after Shaw, right now!

386
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:53,876
But instead that up there, worring
about the wrong mutions.

387
00:29:54,464 --> 00:29:55,699
What we gonna do, Loaven?

388
00:29:56,021 --> 00:29:57,116
Loaven?

389
00:29:57,959 --> 00:29:59,148
Loaven, what's wrong with you?

390
00:30:01,258 --> 00:30:04,912
<i>Absolutely nothing. I'm just frozen him for
a moment, because I'd like to talk to you.</i>

391
00:30:05,066 --> 00:30:06,339
<i>It's good, isn't it?</i>

392
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:09,457
<i>I'm as interested in this
Sebastian Shaw as you are. </i>

393
00:30:09,618 --> 00:30:12,432
<i>And if you still want my help, meet me
in the third floor, at the parking garage.</i>

394
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:16,104
I've always known adoring people like you out there.

395
00:30:16,372 --> 00:30:19,521
I've been the laughing stop in
this agency for years, but I knew it

396
00:30:19,803 --> 00:30:22,062
- You're gonna love my consultancy...
- That's gonna have to wait.

397
00:30:22,294 --> 00:30:23,315
Why?

398
00:30:23,316 --> 00:30:25,986
Agent MacTaggert doesn't leave
Sebastian Shaw, if we don't move now!

399
00:30:25,987 --> 00:30:27,025
Parley, we're gonna lose it.

400
00:30:27,372 --> 00:30:28,151
What?

401
00:30:28,152 --> 00:30:31,784
Not only can he read minds,
he can commudicate as well.

402
00:30:31,785 --> 00:30:33,472
Moira and I just had
a loving conversation.

403
00:30:33,793 --> 00:30:34,454
Yes, we did!

404
00:30:34,714 --> 00:30:35,616
That's incredible!

405
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:40,241
But, but.. I can not take you anywhere else
without the permissions from upstairs.

406
00:30:40,242 --> 00:30:41,402
Would you like to see one more magic show?

407
00:30:41,403 --> 00:30:42,753
- Okay!
- Get in the car.

408
00:30:42,916 --> 00:30:43,645
Good idea!

409
00:30:55,828 --> 00:31:00,932
Subtitle by; Ballen Abdulkarim

410
00:31:13,464 --> 00:31:14,550
He's here to kill you.

411
00:31:21,054 --> 00:31:24,118
<i>What kind of greeting is this..</i>

412
00:31:26,928 --> 00:31:28,703
<i>After so many years?!</i>

413
00:31:38,014 --> 00:31:39,252
Emma...

414
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,676
We won't harm our kind.

415
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:46,633
Uh..
Now it's a party!

416
00:31:47,787 --> 00:31:52,324
<i>This is the U.S. Coast Guard.
Do not attempt to move your ambassador!</i>

417
00:31:52,852 --> 00:31:53,958
<i>Stay where you are!</i>

418
00:32:00,204 --> 00:32:01,861
Thay have a telepath!

419
00:32:05,733 --> 00:32:07,005
I've lost Shaw!

420
00:32:07,473 --> 00:32:09,518
I've lo.. I've lost Shaw!

421
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:12,319
There's something blocked me.
This never happened to me before.

422
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,014
I think, there is someone
like me on that ship!

423
00:32:14,513 --> 00:32:15,004
Like you?

424
00:32:15,005 --> 00:32:16,690
I.. I'm sorry.
A telepath.

425
00:32:16,959 --> 00:32:19,336
This is incredible.
I can actually feel that inside my mind!

426
00:32:19,337 --> 00:32:22,578
I'm very sorry, but I don't think I would be so
much helpful tonight. Here you're on your own.

427
00:32:36,596 --> 00:32:38,139
- Oh, my God!
- Jesus!

428
00:32:41,234 --> 00:32:42,788
Get inside!

429
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:49,937
Wait, stop, stop..

430
00:32:50,092 --> 00:32:51,011
What?
God!

431
00:32:51,012 --> 00:32:52,114
Charles!

432
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:53,478
You okay?

433
00:32:54,042 --> 00:32:55,049
There's someone else there!

434
00:32:59,015 --> 00:33:00,225
There!

435
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:04,640
Time to go.

436
00:33:58,614 --> 00:34:00,345
Let go!

437
00:34:02,747 --> 00:34:04,028
You've to let 'em go!

438
00:34:04,169 --> 00:34:06,469
You could have to kill him, there's
someone else in the water! help him!

439
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:07,620
Let it go!

440
00:34:07,621 --> 00:34:09,282
You have to let is go!

441
00:34:33,091 --> 00:34:35,357
<i>I know what this means to you,
but you're going to die!</i>

442
00:34:35,885 --> 00:34:39,322
<i>Please, Erik!
Calm your mind.</i>

443
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,204
Get of me!
Get of me!

444
00:34:53,205 --> 00:34:54,078
Calm down!

445
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:55,771
Just breathe!
We're here!

446
00:34:55,772 --> 00:34:56,489
Who are you?

447
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:58,546
My name is Charles Xavier.

448
00:34:58,547 --> 00:34:59,755
You were in my head..

449
00:35:00,281 --> 00:35:01,026
How did you do that?

450
00:35:01,027 --> 00:35:02,714
You have your tricks,
I have mine.

451
00:35:02,715 --> 00:35:05,113
I'm like you.
Just calm your mind!

452
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:08,818
I thought I was alone.

453
00:35:09,992 --> 00:35:10,952
You're not alone.

454
00:35:12,563 --> 00:35:14,066
Erik...

455
00:35:14,649 --> 00:35:15,820
You're not alone.

456
00:35:19,021 --> 00:35:22,636
<i>Secret CIA base</i>

457
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:37,723
Welcome to my facility.

458
00:35:38,701 --> 00:35:41,395
My mission has been to
investigate the application..

459
00:35:41,538 --> 00:35:43,758
Of paranormal powers
in military defense.

460
00:35:43,905 --> 00:35:44,927
Or offence.

461
00:35:45,868 --> 00:35:48,859
This guy, Shaw.. Schmidt..
Whatever you want to call him..

462
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:50,337
He's working with the Russians.

463
00:35:50,911 --> 00:35:52,303
We might need your help to stop him.

464
00:35:52,435 --> 00:35:53,037
Fabulous!

465
00:35:53,174 --> 00:35:55,663
So we would to be the CIA's
new mutation vision, yes?

466
00:35:57,132 --> 00:35:58,466
Something like that.

467
00:36:01,758 --> 00:36:03,834
So super sonic!

468
00:36:04,472 --> 00:36:06,060
Most advance plane ever built.

469
00:36:07,403 --> 00:36:09,012
You should see it in real life.

470
00:36:09,872 --> 00:36:10,654
It's incredible!

471
00:36:11,035 --> 00:36:14,862
Hank, these are the special new crew,
that I was telling you about.

472
00:36:14,989 --> 00:36:15,863
This is Hank McCoy.

473
00:36:15,865 --> 00:36:17,801
The one of our most
talented young researchers.

474
00:36:17,802 --> 00:36:21,580
How wonderful!
Another mutate, already here!

475
00:36:21,855 --> 00:36:22,694
Why didn't you say?

476
00:36:23,718 --> 00:36:24,442
Say what?

477
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:27,238
Because you don't know.

478
00:36:27,915 --> 00:36:31,305
I am so sorry!
Terribly sorry!

479
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:35,441
Hank?

480
00:36:35,442 --> 00:36:37,084
You didn't ask,
so I didn't tell.

481
00:36:37,736 --> 00:36:41,318
So, your mutation is what?
You're super smart?

482
00:36:41,319 --> 00:36:44,724
I'll say, Hank graduated Harvard at age 15.

483
00:36:45,874 --> 00:36:47,313
I wish that to tell it was.

484
00:36:47,675 --> 00:36:49,454
You're among friends now, Hank.

485
00:36:50,155 --> 00:36:50,494
You can show of.

486
00:37:07,269 --> 00:37:08,310
Splendid!

487
00:37:15,031 --> 00:37:15,652
Sorry!

488
00:37:30,923 --> 00:37:31,868
You're amazing!

489
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,283
Really?

490
00:37:39,353 --> 00:37:40,959
<i>The presence of U.S. missiles in Turkey..</i>

491
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,380
<i>represents an unprecedented threat
to the people of Soviet union.</i>

492
00:37:44,555 --> 00:37:47,760
<i>Warn of Russian for Minister in Gromyko,
Earlier today.</i>

493
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:49,765
<i>But he was quick to insiste..</i>

494
00:37:49,766 --> 00:37:53,477
<i>the Russians will not be the first
to initiate any military action.</i>

495
00:37:53,864 --> 00:37:56,139
Yeah, we'll fix that soon
as we get to Russia.

496
00:37:56,533 --> 00:37:58,673
Unless the CIA finds us first.

497
00:37:59,029 --> 00:38:00,513
I'll take care of them too.

498
00:38:02,459 --> 00:38:06,863
If that telepath inside your head,
it wouldn't be much fun as I am.

499
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:09,050
Already here, my love!

500
00:38:18,947 --> 00:38:20,364
Russians..

501
00:38:22,281 --> 00:38:24,157
Made me this!

502
00:38:27,543 --> 00:38:29,075
So..

503
00:38:29,076 --> 00:38:30,138
What am I thinking?

504
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:40,952
I don't know!

505
00:38:43,774 --> 00:38:47,695
I was thinking that you're the most
exquisite thing I ever seen in my life!

506
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:53,410
And this needs ice.

507
00:38:55,424 --> 00:38:56,413
Bring me some.

508
00:39:23,549 --> 00:39:26,400
I.. I promised myself, I'll find the cure.

509
00:39:26,401 --> 00:39:27,990
Ever since I was a little boy.

510
00:39:28,549 --> 00:39:31,660
You have no idea what I give to feel..

511
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:33,591
- Normal.
- Normal.

512
00:39:38,658 --> 00:39:40,498
Charles, has never understood.

513
00:39:41,209 --> 00:39:42,608
He's different, but..

514
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:44,419
He's never had to hide.

515
00:39:45,463 --> 00:39:49,442
Hey, this serum that you're making,
it doesn't affect abilities, right?

516
00:39:49,443 --> 00:39:50,529
Just the appearance.

517
00:39:50,787 --> 00:39:52,222
Normalize, is it?

518
00:39:52,441 --> 00:39:53,066
Yeah.

519
00:39:54,476 --> 00:39:55,799
Do you think, it would work on me?

520
00:39:57,602 --> 00:39:59,500
I can look into it, of you like?

521
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:03,449
It's the least I can do, after asking you to
come down here was such a wierd request.

522
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:06,842
I've to admit, usually some guys
ask me out, they don't after my blood!

523
00:40:07,925 --> 00:40:08,985
Sorry!

524
00:40:09,157 --> 00:40:13,141
I didn't attend to be forward,
I was just.. I was excited!

525
00:40:13,574 --> 00:40:15,699
You know, the nature of your mutation..

526
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,976
If any genes hold the key
to change you appearance..

527
00:40:18,113 --> 00:40:18,899
It's yours.

528
00:40:19,494 --> 00:40:23,419
Hank, you're being forward,
That's kindda what I meant.

529
00:40:24,198 --> 00:40:24,873
No!

530
00:40:25,687 --> 00:40:27,825
I'm just, sorry if I was.

531
00:40:27,826 --> 00:40:29,280
And I'm sorry that you are.

532
00:40:30,629 --> 00:40:33,455
Go ahead,
take the blood!

533
00:40:45,517 --> 00:40:46,851
Sorry!
Does that hurt you?

534
00:40:49,589 --> 00:40:50,388
Kinky!

535
00:40:52,682 --> 00:40:53,722
By the way..

536
00:40:54,379 --> 00:40:58,628
If I ever liked you,
I wouldn't change a thing!

537
00:41:25,831 --> 00:41:28,674
What I know about you,
I'm surprised to you stay this low!

538
00:41:30,964 --> 00:41:32,121
What you know about me?

539
00:41:33,259 --> 00:41:34,130
Everything!

540
00:41:34,418 --> 00:41:36,378
Then you know to
stay out of my head!

541
00:41:36,717 --> 00:41:39,334
I'm sorry, Erik.
But I've seen what Shaw did to you.

542
00:41:41,853 --> 00:41:43,704
I felt your agony.

543
00:41:46,101 --> 00:41:47,014
I can help you.

544
00:41:54,574 --> 00:41:55,996
I don't need your help.

545
00:41:55,997 --> 00:41:58,325
Don't kid yourself.
You needed my help last night

546
00:41:58,659 --> 00:42:00,288
It's not just me you walking away from.

547
00:42:01,387 --> 00:42:05,015
Here you have the chance to be part of
something much bigger than yourself.

548
00:42:08,104 --> 00:42:09,204
I won't stop of knowing.

549
00:42:09,604 --> 00:42:10,848
I could.

550
00:42:14,305 --> 00:42:15,136
But I won't.

551
00:42:19,623 --> 00:42:20,783
Shaw has got firends.

552
00:42:21,676 --> 00:42:22,965
He could do use some.

553
00:42:29,253 --> 00:42:32,337
Hank turned that radar
installation into a transmitter.

554
00:42:32,674 --> 00:42:34,814
It's designed to amplify brain waves,

555
00:42:35,229 --> 00:42:37,237
So it could hands your telepathic powers.

556
00:42:37,556 --> 00:42:39,575
Help us find other mutate
for our division.

557
00:42:39,789 --> 00:42:41,470
What if they don't
wanna be found by you?

558
00:42:41,925 --> 00:42:42,660
Erik!

559
00:42:43,699 --> 00:42:45,217
You decided to stay!

560
00:42:48,062 --> 00:42:50,071
If new a species has
been discoverd...

561
00:42:50,072 --> 00:42:51,573
That would be bought by your kind.

562
00:42:52,208 --> 00:42:54,485
Charles and I find the mutations.
No suits.

563
00:42:54,882 --> 00:42:56,695
Firstable, that's my machine out there.

564
00:42:56,696 --> 00:42:59,381
Secondable, it's much importantly,
this is Charles's decision

565
00:42:59,695 --> 00:43:02,490
Charles's find the CIA being
involved, ain't that right?

566
00:43:04,354 --> 00:43:05,270
No!

567
00:43:05,813 --> 00:43:06,572
I'm sorry, but..

568
00:43:07,106 --> 00:43:08,369
I'm with Erik.

569
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:10,396
We'll find them alone!

570
00:43:12,325 --> 00:43:13,464
What if I say no?

571
00:43:14,707 --> 00:43:17,560
Then good luck using your
installations without me!

572
00:43:31,457 --> 00:43:33,225
- I.. Call it Cerebro.
- You..?

573
00:43:33,939 --> 00:43:35,646
- Is it in the spanish for Brain?
- Yes.

574
00:43:36,751 --> 00:43:40,066
Okay, so, the electrodes connect
Charles the transmitter on the roof.

575
00:43:40,297 --> 00:43:41,873
When he picks up a, mutant..

576
00:43:42,235 --> 00:43:44,228
His brain sends a signal for the relay.

577
00:43:44,474 --> 00:43:44,998
And then the..

578
00:43:44,999 --> 00:43:46,971
Coordinates in the locations will appear out here.

579
00:43:47,787 --> 00:43:48,744
You designed this?

580
00:43:49,272 --> 00:43:49,993
Yeah!

581
00:43:53,312 --> 00:43:56,354
- What an adorable land rates, Charles!
- Do not spoil the moment, Erik.

582
00:43:57,245 --> 00:43:59,778
I've been in liberate,
and I know one when I see one.

583
00:44:00,096 --> 00:44:01,784
Okay, great!

584
00:44:02,429 --> 00:44:04,091
Are you sure we can't
change shave your hair?

585
00:44:04,093 --> 00:44:05,042
Don't touch my hair!

586
00:44:49,756 --> 00:44:50,484
It's working!

587
00:45:08,559 --> 00:45:11,031
That daddy O,
you'll get a private dance!

588
00:45:15,464 --> 00:45:17,574
You guys know it's
double for both, right?

589
00:45:18,902 --> 00:45:21,199
Will, that won't be necessary.
While I'm sure it will be magical..

590
00:45:21,323 --> 00:45:23,199
We were thinking,
and we will show you ours.

591
00:45:24,313 --> 00:45:25,719
If you show us yours.

592
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:28,262
Baby, that is not the way
it works around here!

593
00:45:29,996 --> 00:45:31,504
More to you vicar?

594
00:45:31,985 --> 00:45:33,202
I verify that for you!

595
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:37,185
Mu turn!

596
00:45:55,039 --> 00:45:57,590
How would you like a job
when you get your clothes on?

597
00:46:03,534 --> 00:46:04,639
Where to, fellas?

598
00:46:04,787 --> 00:46:06,071
Richmond, Virginia.

599
00:46:06,072 --> 00:46:09,156
Right! So you want, airport,
to station, what?

600
00:46:09,370 --> 00:46:12,267
We were hoping you take us all the way!

601
00:46:12,438 --> 00:46:13,751
That's a 6 hours drive!

602
00:46:13,752 --> 00:46:15,627
That will give us much time to talk!

603
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:22,696
What the hell the government
wants from a guy like Alex Summers?

604
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:25,074
hope you not planning on
putting him with others.

605
00:46:25,461 --> 00:46:28,624
First guy I ever meet when
actually prefer solitary can find.

606
00:46:39,031 --> 00:46:39,873
Crazy, huh?

607
00:46:39,874 --> 00:46:41,101
What?

608
00:46:41,934 --> 00:46:44,001
You like fish, I like fish, too!

609
00:46:44,741 --> 00:46:47,019
I wish I could buy sometime
to talk about it.

610
00:46:49,737 --> 00:46:51,383
I'd like to go out with the fish.

611
00:46:57,682 --> 00:46:59,258
This fish?

612
00:47:17,853 --> 00:47:20,342
- Excuse me, I'm Erik Lehnsherr.
- Charles Xavier.

613
00:47:20,458 --> 00:47:21,425
Go fuck yourself!

614
00:47:42,165 --> 00:47:43,956
- There's nothing on radar?
- Nothing!

615
00:47:44,342 --> 00:47:45,196
- Sonar?
- Neither!

616
00:47:46,956 --> 00:47:48,508
Then we have a problem!

617
00:48:07,771 --> 00:48:08,883
Beautiful.
Isn't it?

618
00:48:10,136 --> 00:48:11,416
The reason we exist..

619
00:48:12,588 --> 00:48:14,801
We are the children of the atom, my love!

620
00:48:15,084 --> 00:48:16,223
We have a situation.

621
00:48:16,784 --> 00:48:18,062
The telepath..

622
00:48:18,512 --> 00:48:20,836
I shouldn't be able to feel no matter distances.

623
00:48:21,223 --> 00:48:22,425
It's like he reaches..

624
00:48:23,284 --> 00:48:24,586
Amplified.

625
00:48:27,473 --> 00:48:28,735
They're recruiting.

626
00:48:29,730 --> 00:48:32,988
You go on to Russia,
And I'll handle them.

627
00:48:35,016 --> 00:48:36,895
There's so many other out there.

628
00:48:37,302 --> 00:48:39,160
One hundred minds that I touched.

629
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:41,216
I could feel them.

630
00:48:41,782 --> 00:48:43,131
Their isolations..

631
00:48:43,311 --> 00:48:44,164
Their hops..

632
00:48:44,165 --> 00:48:45,351
And ambitions.

633
00:48:46,321 --> 00:48:48,822
I'll tell you, we'll start
something incredible thing, Erik.

634
00:48:49,689 --> 00:48:50,598
We can help them.

635
00:48:51,091 --> 00:48:51,893
Can we?

636
00:48:53,083 --> 00:48:55,611
Identification, that's how it dones.

637
00:48:57,464 --> 00:48:59,423
And ends will be rounded us.

638
00:48:59,424 --> 00:49:00,462
Experiments of them,
are limited.

639
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:02,518
Not this time!

640
00:49:02,989 --> 00:49:05,616
We have common enemies.
Shaw, the Russians...

641
00:49:05,617 --> 00:49:07,887
- They need us.
- For now.

642
00:49:13,963 --> 00:49:15,659
We should think of code names.

643
00:49:15,938 --> 00:49:18,261
We are goverment agents now,
we should have secret code names.

644
00:49:18,435 --> 00:49:19,965
I wanna be called Mystique.

645
00:49:20,257 --> 00:49:22,099
Damn, I wanted to be called Mystique!

646
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:24,047
That's up, I called it!

647
00:49:24,527 --> 00:49:25,138
Wow!

648
00:49:25,848 --> 00:49:28,678
And I'm more mysterious than you!

649
00:49:31,228 --> 00:49:32,579
Darwin, what about you?

650
00:49:32,869 --> 00:49:35,689
Will, Darwin is already my nickname.
And you know..

651
00:49:35,691 --> 00:49:36,973
Sort of fits.

652
00:49:39,578 --> 00:49:40,513
Check this out!

653
00:49:54,335 --> 00:49:56,567
Thank you.
Thank you!

654
00:49:56,915 --> 00:49:57,660
What about you?

655
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:59,331
I'm going to be..

656
00:50:00,687 --> 00:50:02,209
Banshee.

657
00:50:02,210 --> 00:50:03,966
Why want be named after a willing spirit?

658
00:50:03,967 --> 00:50:05,625
You might wanna cover your ears!

659
00:50:21,498 --> 00:50:22,360
Your turn!

660
00:50:22,361 --> 00:50:22,864
My, uhh...

661
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:25,484
Stage name is Angel.

662
00:50:26,141 --> 00:50:27,290
Kindda fits.

663
00:50:27,291 --> 00:50:28,234
You can fly?

664
00:50:28,488 --> 00:50:29,130
Uh-Ha

665
00:50:29,644 --> 00:50:30,167
And, uh..

666
00:50:38,678 --> 00:50:39,412
Disgusting!

667
00:50:39,413 --> 00:50:40,260
What's your name?

668
00:50:41,648 --> 00:50:42,805
How about, Big Foot?

669
00:50:43,249 --> 00:50:45,482
You know, they say
about guy, Big Feet..

670
00:50:45,803 --> 00:50:46,625
And, uh..

671
00:50:46,952 --> 00:50:47,991
Your too kindda small!

672
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:49,259
Okay, now!

673
00:50:50,757 --> 00:50:52,644
Alex, what's your gift?
What can you do?

674
00:50:52,645 --> 00:50:53,986
It's not the...

675
00:50:55,030 --> 00:50:56,605
I just can't do it.

676
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:58,151
I can't to it in here.

677
00:50:58,367 --> 00:50:59,255
Can you do it out there?

678
00:50:59,256 --> 00:51:00,551
Would you do it there?

679
00:51:00,542 --> 00:51:01,967
- Come on!
- Come on!

680
00:51:01,968 --> 00:51:02,852
- Alex!
- Alex!

681
00:51:03,221 --> 00:51:04,105
- Alex!
- Alex!

682
00:51:04,912 --> 00:51:05,796
- Alex!
- Alex!

683
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:07,203
- Alex!
- Alex!

684
00:51:09,139 --> 00:51:10,116
This is spirit!

685
00:51:10,635 --> 00:51:11,545
Get down, when I tell you.

686
00:51:19,606 --> 00:51:20,550
Get back!

687
00:51:25,739 --> 00:51:26,645
Get back!

688
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:29,412
Whatever!

689
00:51:38,214 --> 00:51:39,437
You're kidding!

690
00:51:43,406 --> 00:51:47,492
We've got in tell that Shaw is meeting
the Russian defense chief in Moscow.

691
00:51:47,832 --> 00:51:49,446
Go ahead, say it!

692
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:52,456
I'm not here to say 'I told you so'.
You know why I'm here.

693
00:51:52,457 --> 00:51:55,372
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Clearings to bring all new units.

694
00:51:55,373 --> 00:51:57,054
Fight fire with fire.

695
00:51:57,729 --> 00:51:58,671
Make sense.

696
00:51:58,672 --> 00:51:59,548
Wait!

697
00:51:59,549 --> 00:52:00,796
You're okay with this?

698
00:52:01,058 --> 00:52:03,771
Sending a bunch of untraind,
unauthorized freaks?

699
00:52:03,773 --> 00:52:07,472
These 'Freaks' are dedicated,
hard-working people!

700
00:52:08,903 --> 00:52:10,900
Plane flies to Russia in a hour.

701
00:52:11,099 --> 00:52:12,809
Telling you, these kids
are not ready for Shaw.

702
00:52:12,810 --> 00:52:15,574
I think it's gonna surprise you,
an exceptional of bunch of young people.

703
00:52:15,718 --> 00:52:16,409
What the hell?

704
00:52:28,907 --> 00:52:29,864
Harder!

705
00:52:31,328 --> 00:52:31,810
Harder!

706
00:52:34,938 --> 00:52:36,494
What are you doing?

707
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:43,732
Who destroyed the statue?

708
00:52:44,362 --> 00:52:45,160
It was Alex!

709
00:52:45,589 --> 00:52:46,745
No, Havok..

710
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:49,238
We've to call him Havok.
That's his name now.

711
00:52:49,547 --> 00:52:52,351
And we were thinking,
you should be Professor X..

712
00:52:53,012 --> 00:52:54,896
And you should be Magneto.

713
00:52:56,503 --> 00:52:57,636
Exceptional!

714
00:53:02,152 --> 00:53:03,769
I expect more from you.

715
00:53:07,864 --> 00:53:11,557
<i>Country House Military Office of the
Union of Soviet Socialist Republics aka USSR.</i>

716
00:53:25,001 --> 00:53:26,396
- We've got a problem.
- What?

717
00:53:26,572 --> 00:53:28,371
I'm so sorry!
It's jsut wasn't on the map.

718
00:53:34,876 --> 00:53:37,380
No matter what happens, act normally.
I'll take care of this, alright?

719
00:53:39,788 --> 00:53:40,567
Now listen to me.

720
00:53:43,799 --> 00:53:46,414
<i>- To where?
- To the other side.</i>

721
00:53:48,410 --> 00:53:52,354
<i>- Can you show me the back?
- Sure, sure!</i>

722
00:54:13,496 --> 00:54:16,440
- What's in there?
- Nothing!

723
00:54:19,316 --> 00:54:21,349
<i>- So, we're finished here?
- Yeah.</i>

724
00:54:44,067 --> 00:54:46,504
- Where's Shaw?
- I don't know!

725
00:54:47,123 --> 00:54:49,768
If she is telepath and if I read her,
She'll now we're here.

726
00:54:51,631 --> 00:54:52,596
I'll try something else.

727
00:55:10,836 --> 00:55:12,099
<i>Shaw has send his apologize.</i>

728
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:13,447
<i>But he's in dispose.</i>

729
00:55:13,632 --> 00:55:14,832
<i>He asked me to come in his place.</i>

730
00:55:16,062 --> 00:55:19,526
<i>Between you and me,
I'm a lot better company.</i>

731
00:55:20,312 --> 00:55:21,689
<i>Please, come here!</i>

732
00:55:27,210 --> 00:55:27,993
He's not coming.

733
00:55:30,579 --> 00:55:31,836
So now what, boss?

734
00:55:32,424 --> 00:55:33,821
Now, nothing.

735
00:55:34,084 --> 00:55:35,371
We're here for Shaw,
mission aborted.

736
00:55:35,508 --> 00:55:36,398
What the hell is this?

737
00:55:36,613 --> 00:55:38,677
- Erik!
- She's his right hand woman!

738
00:55:39,171 --> 00:55:40,095
That's good enough for me.

739
00:55:40,096 --> 00:55:43,107
The CIA invading a home
senior Soviet officer..

740
00:55:43,324 --> 00:55:43,969
Are you crazy?

741
00:55:44,474 --> 00:55:45,411
I'm not in CIA.

742
00:55:46,384 --> 00:55:47,081
Erik?!

743
00:55:55,704 --> 00:55:57,982
So, you be busy,
planning your next move.

744
00:55:57,983 --> 00:56:01,172
But what if the American refusing
transmute missiles to Turkey?

745
00:56:02,523 --> 00:56:05,838
You know, I can't talk
about those things, Mrs. Frost.

746
00:56:06,484 --> 00:56:07,068
Emma!

747
00:56:10,782 --> 00:56:11,821
And don't worry..

748
00:56:13,086 --> 00:56:14,611
You don't have to say a word!

749
00:56:31,302 --> 00:56:33,243
He's gonna start World War III,
ain't he?

750
00:56:33,491 --> 00:56:34,817
- Then, do somthing!
- Like what?

751
00:56:35,266 --> 00:56:35,923
We're moving out!

752
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:36,939
You can't!

753
00:56:52,572 --> 00:56:53,569
I'm sorry..

754
00:56:53,892 --> 00:56:54,633
I can't leave him!

755
00:57:09,276 --> 00:57:09,953
You calm!

756
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:11,042
You speak English?

757
00:57:22,562 --> 00:57:25,084
You are so beautiful!

758
00:57:25,651 --> 00:57:27,549
Yes, yes!

759
00:57:27,550 --> 00:57:28,330
Pathetic!

760
00:57:30,254 --> 00:57:32,557
Yes!

761
00:57:37,479 --> 00:57:38,605
Yes!

762
00:57:40,645 --> 00:57:42,126
Nice trick!

763
00:57:44,567 --> 00:57:45,637
Cine esti tu?

764
00:57:49,806 --> 00:57:50,880
Go to sleep!

765
00:57:58,822 --> 00:58:01,320
You can stop to read my mind, suger!

766
00:58:03,227 --> 00:58:05,840
You're never going to get anything
from me, while I'm like this.

767
00:58:19,134 --> 00:58:20,157
So you can just tell us!

768
00:58:22,683 --> 00:58:24,350
Where's Shaw?

769
00:58:30,874 --> 00:58:31,969
Erik?

770
00:58:38,934 --> 00:58:39,916
Erik, that's enough.

771
00:58:48,783 --> 00:58:49,872
Erik, that's enough!

772
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:00,940
All yours!

773
00:59:02,312 --> 00:59:04,584
She wouldn't be shooting at
the diamond from again.

774
00:59:05,107 --> 00:59:06,370
If she does..

775
00:59:06,877 --> 00:59:07,951
Give here a gentle touch.

776
00:59:14,723 --> 00:59:16,660
<i>Untied States of American</i>

777
00:59:21,936 --> 00:59:23,250
<i>*USA*</i>

00:59:24,645 --> 00:59:29,149
<i>Russia</i>

<i>We are the children of the atom.</i>

<i>Radiation gave birth to mutations.</i>

781
00:59:40,034 --> 00:59:41,123
<i>What will kill the humans..</i>

782
00:59:41,766 --> 00:59:43,276
<i>Will only make us stronger.</i>

783
00:59:48,463 --> 00:59:50,022
Beautiful, isn't it?

784
00:59:53,133 --> 00:59:55,134
This is worst than we previously imagined!

785
00:59:57,921 --> 00:59:59,082
We're taking you with us.

786
00:59:59,690 --> 01:00:01,620
CIA will want to
question you themselves.

787
01:00:02,025 --> 01:00:03,095
I doubt it.

788
01:00:03,698 --> 01:00:05,458
They've bigger things, than
you're worry about right now.

789
01:00:12,336 --> 01:00:13,887
Wow!
Alright!

790
01:00:14,831 --> 01:00:16,669
Jesus, man..
You are killing me!

791
01:00:16,670 --> 01:00:18,810
Don't beat yourselfe up,
we've lot of spare time.

792
01:00:24,604 --> 01:00:26,582
Oh, I didn't know, the circus was in town!

793
01:00:27,203 --> 01:00:29,206
Ow, come on honey!
Give us some of..

794
01:00:29,936 --> 01:00:31,823
Will!
Go on, let's see the foot!

795
01:00:32,009 --> 01:00:34,122
Here he is!
Come big foot, let's go!

796
01:00:34,272 --> 01:00:35,650
Hey, hey..
Come on! Hey!

797
01:00:40,660 --> 01:00:42,266
They're just guys,
being stupid!

798
01:00:42,629 --> 01:00:44,456
guys being stupid, I can handle!

799
01:00:44,457 --> 01:00:46,135
Okay, I handled them all my life!

800
01:00:46,274 --> 01:00:50,157
But, rather bunch of guys stare of me, with
my clothes off, and when they were staring me!

801
01:00:51,936 --> 01:00:53,386
And us!

802
01:01:01,038 --> 01:01:02,535
What was that?

803
01:01:04,684 --> 01:01:06,286
I don't know.
There's something I don't feel right!

804
01:01:16,024 --> 01:01:17,280
No word of Shaw?

805
01:01:17,549 --> 01:01:18,367
Not a peep!

806
01:01:18,368 --> 01:01:19,513
Not even through
that back channel?

807
01:01:33,220 --> 01:01:33,952
What is that?

808
01:01:51,198 --> 01:01:53,395
We have an intruder in the main atrium.

809
01:01:53,396 --> 01:01:54,489
Where are the mutates?

810
01:01:54,490 --> 01:01:55,916
You take another step,
I'm gonna put you down!

811
01:01:56,050 --> 01:01:58,708
Of course you will! but where do
I find more of evolute people?

812
01:02:00,332 --> 01:02:01,714
Send backup,
now!

813
01:02:04,730 --> 01:02:06,795
Get back, Get back!
You don't leave that room!

814
01:02:07,020 --> 01:02:08,010
We're under attack!

815
01:02:08,622 --> 01:02:09,787
Shoot..
Shoot him!

816
01:02:23,327 --> 01:02:24,498
Where are the mutates?

817
01:02:24,645 --> 01:02:26,907
Put that man down,
or we will open fire!

818
01:02:52,365 --> 01:02:54,827
Stay behind me ass!
Let's go!

819
01:03:00,271 --> 01:03:01,038
Get back!

820
01:03:01,649 --> 01:03:02,685
We need help!

821
01:04:02,580 --> 01:04:03,263
This way!

822
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:05,315
If you need the mutates,
they're right through that door!

823
01:04:05,467 --> 01:04:07,012
Just let us normal people go!

824
01:04:07,330 --> 01:04:07,985
Or no way....

825
01:04:17,741 --> 01:04:18,620
Where's the telepath?

826
01:04:19,335 --> 01:04:20,298
Not here!

827
01:04:20,737 --> 01:04:21,261
Too bad!

828
01:04:21,755 --> 01:04:23,867
Oh, let's take this silly thing off.

829
01:04:26,266 --> 01:04:26,815
Good evening.

830
01:04:27,226 --> 01:04:29,295
My name is Sebastian Shaw.

831
01:04:31,090 --> 01:04:33,375
And I'm no here to hurt you.

832
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:34,339
Freeze!

833
01:04:35,378 --> 01:04:36,680
Azazel!

834
01:04:39,704 --> 01:04:41,436
My friends..

835
01:04:41,914 --> 01:04:43,185
There's a revolution coming..

836
01:04:43,698 --> 01:04:46,878
When man kind dicovers, who we are!
What we can do!

837
01:04:46,879 --> 01:04:48,774
Each of us will face a choice.

838
01:04:49,684 --> 01:04:50,812
Be in slaved...

839
01:04:52,406 --> 01:04:54,180
Or rise up to rule!

840
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:57,638
Choose freely, but know
that if you are not with us,

841
01:04:57,791 --> 01:04:59,727
By definition, you are..

842
01:04:59,728 --> 01:05:01,197
Against us!

843
01:05:01,992 --> 01:05:02,821
So..

844
01:05:03,343 --> 01:05:04,308
You can stay...

845
01:05:04,727 --> 01:05:07,805
And fight for the people
who hate and fear you.

846
01:05:08,715 --> 01:05:10,450
Or you can join me,

847
01:05:10,969 --> 01:05:13,025
And live like kings!

848
01:05:18,910 --> 01:05:20,517
And queens!

849
01:05:32,937 --> 01:05:33,763
You kidding me?

850
01:05:34,179 --> 01:05:35,368
Come on!

851
01:05:36,521 --> 01:05:37,561
We don't belong here.

852
01:05:38,392 --> 01:05:40,450
And that's nothing to be ashamed of.

853
01:05:45,494 --> 01:05:47,116
We have to do something!

854
01:06:02,660 --> 01:06:03,735
Stop!

855
01:06:04,601 --> 01:06:05,544
I'm coming with you.

856
01:06:09,476 --> 01:06:11,015
Good choice!

857
01:06:11,915 --> 01:06:14,420
So, tell me about your mutation.

858
01:06:14,885 --> 01:06:16,793
Will, I adapted to survive!

859
01:06:19,770 --> 01:06:21,925
So, I guess I'm coming with you.

860
01:06:22,426 --> 01:06:23,382
I like that!

861
01:06:29,895 --> 01:06:31,458
- Alex!
- Get out!

862
01:06:31,643 --> 01:06:32,798
Do it!

863
01:06:38,162 --> 01:06:39,735
Checking your fallow mutants...

864
01:06:41,007 --> 01:06:43,991
It's a noble gesture.
Feels good!

865
01:06:50,197 --> 01:06:51,910
Adapt to this!

866
01:07:22,319 --> 01:07:26,715
<i>Moscow, Russia</i>

867
01:07:35,998 --> 01:07:37,082
<i>Welcome.</i>

868
01:07:39,097 --> 01:07:46,884
<i>Again, I'm sorry about intelligences
treatment for you.</i>

869
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:49,355
<i>The American are merciless.</i>

870
01:07:50,328 --> 01:07:54,717
<i>And know, they put rockets in Turkey.</i>

871
01:07:55,634 --> 01:08:00,032
<i>And I guess, you look for a place
to put your own rockets.</i>

872
01:08:00,455 --> 01:08:06,702
<i>Somewhere, that the American defense
system will be useless.</i>

873
01:08:07,568 --> 01:08:11,031
<i>You will put them in Cuba.</i>

874
01:08:12,358 --> 01:08:14,568
<i>And very close to Florida.</i>

875
01:08:15,820 --> 01:08:17,517
<i>Rockets in Cuba?</i>

876
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:21,377
<i>Are you serious?</i>

877
01:08:22,425 --> 01:08:25,059
<i>That way, we will announce the war!</i>

878
01:08:25,968 --> 01:08:27,881
Maybe, I wasn't clear enough.

879
01:08:30,484 --> 01:08:32,215
You will make this happen!

880
01:08:34,307 --> 01:08:35,841
Sure!

881
01:08:36,450 --> 01:08:39,175
Let's see what KGB
think about this!

882
01:08:43,626 --> 01:08:44,536
<i>Hello?</i>

883
01:08:44,894 --> 01:08:46,318
<i>General Armifilkov.</i>

884
01:08:47,991 --> 01:08:49,748
<i>Yes?</i>

885
01:08:49,749 --> 01:08:51,181
<i>No thing.</i>

886
01:09:07,344 --> 01:09:08,749
Raven!

887
01:09:14,967 --> 01:09:17,005
We'll made the arrangement
for you to be taken to home immediately.

888
01:09:17,236 --> 01:09:18,709
- We're not going home!
- What?

889
01:09:19,268 --> 01:09:20,742
He's not going back to prison.

890
01:09:21,007 --> 01:09:21,954
It killed Darwin!

891
01:09:22,123 --> 01:09:23,956
I hold one more reason
for you to leave.

892
01:09:24,287 --> 01:09:25,123
This is over!

893
01:09:25,451 --> 01:09:27,052
Darwin's dead, Charles!

894
01:09:27,264 --> 01:09:29,176
And we can't even bury him.

895
01:09:32,344 --> 01:09:33,490
We can avenge him!

896
01:09:37,167 --> 01:09:38,079
Erik, a word please.

897
01:09:42,285 --> 01:09:45,118
- They're just kids!
- No, they were kids!

898
01:09:45,653 --> 01:09:47,645
Shaw has is army,
we need ours.

899
01:09:53,615 --> 01:09:54,652
We'll have to train.

900
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:56,850
All of us!

901
01:09:57,881 --> 01:09:58,514
Yes?

902
01:09:58,973 --> 01:09:59,730
Yeah!

903
01:10:00,267 --> 01:10:01,881
We can't stay here.

904
01:10:02,366 --> 01:10:04,442
Even if you reopen the department,
It's not safe!

905
01:10:05,685 --> 01:10:07,364
We got no where to go.

906
01:10:10,312 --> 01:10:11,249
Yes, we do!

907
01:10:12,266 --> 01:10:14,491
The law says we've
got to turn it over.

908
01:10:14,656 --> 01:10:16,647
The law, applies to human beings.

909
01:10:16,648 --> 01:10:18,345
The same law doesn't apply on mutions.

910
01:10:18,494 --> 01:10:19,723
They're too dangerous!

911
01:10:20,198 --> 01:10:21,101
Turns like this!

912
01:10:21,102 --> 01:10:23,828
Security is more important than liberty!

913
01:10:24,134 --> 01:10:26,085
There's a war coming, John.

914
01:10:26,286 --> 01:10:27,200
Yes.

915
01:10:27,476 --> 01:10:29,160
But a war, with who?

916
01:10:43,230 --> 01:10:44,339
Excellent question!

917
01:10:45,081 --> 01:10:47,359
Although I do not call it war exactly.

918
01:10:48,058 --> 01:10:51,076
That's suggest both sides standing
an equal chance of winning.

919
01:11:06,828 --> 01:11:09,675
<i>The Russians have send
their war-head to Cuba.</i>

920
01:11:09,967 --> 01:11:12,123
We have a week bofore
the ship hits the coast.

921
01:11:12,410 --> 01:11:16,405
Our fleet can be on this line,
when the Russian missile ship arrives.

922
01:11:16,941 --> 01:11:18,896
If that ship crosses the line..

923
01:11:19,888 --> 01:11:22,038
They'll have declared a war,
against the United States.

924
01:11:23,025 --> 01:11:26,082
We will have no choice, but the
retaliate of the full nuclear response.

925
01:11:26,881 --> 01:11:27,895
Who is with me?

926
01:11:33,376 --> 01:11:34,813
Despotic to seventh fleet.

927
01:11:38,007 --> 01:11:39,574
This is yours?

928
01:11:39,713 --> 01:11:40,285
No..

929
01:11:40,862 --> 01:11:41,724
It's ours!

930
01:11:47,617 --> 01:11:49,003
Honestly, Charles..

931
01:11:49,004 --> 01:11:50,900
I do not know how you survived.

932
01:11:51,249 --> 01:11:52,725
Living in such harshness.

933
01:11:53,099 --> 01:11:55,486
Will, it was a harshness softed by me!

934
01:11:59,028 --> 01:12:00,572
Come on, time to the tour.

935
01:12:08,693 --> 01:12:12,893
<i>Moscow, Russia</i>

936
01:12:13,778 --> 01:12:15,200
<i>Dear, firends..</i>

937
01:12:15,966 --> 01:12:22,495
<i>The USA has sent a warship to Cuba.</i>

938
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:24,384
<i>And that..</i>

939
01:12:25,179 --> 01:12:27,259
<i>Will leave only one choice..</i>

940
01:12:28,655 --> 01:12:35,998
<i>Mr. First Secretary,
we have to send a fleet marine.</i>

941
01:12:38,747 --> 01:12:40,273
<i>Send the fleet!</i>

942
01:12:46,052 --> 01:12:49,075
<i>President Kennedy has
signed a formal proclamation.</i>

943
01:12:49,212 --> 01:12:52,973
<i>Setting up a blockade of all missiles,
come from Cuba.</i>

944
01:12:53,810 --> 01:13:00,146
<i>The Soviet Union reacted by terminate a step
along the road to initiate a formal nuclear war.</i>

945
01:13:10,942 --> 01:13:11,736
You sure?

946
01:13:12,292 --> 01:13:13,236
I'm sure.

947
01:13:14,234 --> 01:13:14,879
Well.

948
01:13:22,347 --> 01:13:26,087
No. No, I can't. I'm sorry!
I can't shoot anybody pop like this.

949
01:13:26,227 --> 01:13:26,980
Like my friend!

950
01:13:26,981 --> 01:13:28,758
Oh, come on!
You know I can deflect it!

951
01:13:28,877 --> 01:13:30,401
You always tell me,
I should push myself.

952
01:13:30,402 --> 01:13:33,325
You know you can deflect it,
and you're not challenging yourself.

953
01:13:35,442 --> 01:13:37,925
What if that happened to the man
who is tring to resubmarining?

954
01:13:38,745 --> 01:13:38,965
Well, I can't!

955
01:13:40,637 --> 01:13:43,434
Something that big, I need a situation of anger.

956
01:13:43,435 --> 01:13:44,703
The anger is not enough!

957
01:13:45,916 --> 01:13:47,705
That has got my job done all this time!

958
01:13:47,706 --> 01:13:48,745
And you got in your kill all this time!

959
01:13:50,576 --> 01:13:51,726
Okay..

960
01:13:52,572 --> 01:13:54,401
Let's try something more challenging!

961
01:13:56,206 --> 01:13:59,397
My step-father, took a possibility
of nuclear war, quite seriously!

962
01:13:59,540 --> 01:14:00,195
This way.

963
01:14:00,637 --> 01:14:02,851
That's why he had this
bunker build, down here.

964
01:14:03,033 --> 01:14:05,190
So we can use it as a practice
range in our source.

965
01:14:05,552 --> 01:14:06,681
Don't you think I'm gonna blow up the walls?

966
01:14:06,797 --> 01:14:07,311
Ha-ha!

967
01:14:07,312 --> 01:14:09,741
He had this place built with
stone of nuclear bomb.

968
01:14:09,742 --> 01:14:11,011
I think it'll handle you out.

969
01:14:11,430 --> 01:14:13,712
You know, when I do this,
bad things can happen!

970
01:14:14,203 --> 01:14:15,723
It's because you
can't control it..

971
01:14:16,221 --> 01:14:17,772
It, controls you.

972
01:14:18,395 --> 01:14:21,608
That's why we're here, Alex.
That's why we're training.

973
01:14:26,069 --> 01:14:27,488
What you're doing is incredible.

974
01:14:27,837 --> 01:14:30,756
You're hitting the pitch of sound ways,
as the same resonates frequency of the glass.

975
01:14:30,884 --> 01:14:31,611
That's why it shatterd!

976
01:14:31,777 --> 01:14:34,993
But this, is like any other muscle in the body.
You can control it!

977
01:14:37,293 --> 01:14:40,051
In each of us,
two natures are in war.

978
01:14:40,279 --> 01:14:42,206
<i>Robert Louis Stevenson,
Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.</i>

979
01:14:42,207 --> 01:14:43,108
10 marks.

980
01:14:43,109 --> 01:14:45,391
So you mustn't really like or can
believe in that, wouldn't you?

981
01:14:45,392 --> 01:14:48,800
It's about, mans animal nature.
His struggle, so he can control it.

982
01:14:48,802 --> 01:14:49,457
To conform.

983
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:51,972
And that struggle was just holing you back.

984
01:14:52,906 --> 01:14:55,090
Jekyll was afraid of what
would he be capable of.

985
01:14:55,175 --> 01:14:56,195
You are, too.

986
01:14:56,687 --> 01:14:58,968
If you serious about that,
there's no way to get back.

987
01:14:59,460 --> 01:15:00,192
Looks nice.

988
01:15:00,747 --> 01:15:01,742
Have I shut the door?

989
01:15:02,393 --> 01:15:03,151
Yeah.

990
01:15:05,865 --> 01:15:06,715
When you be ready.

991
01:15:14,307 --> 01:15:15,778
My God!

992
01:15:19,412 --> 01:15:21,515
I will teach you to
control this, Alex.

993
01:15:24,836 --> 01:15:26,768
Are you sure, this will work?

994
01:15:27,034 --> 01:15:28,319
Anything is possible.

995
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:30,233
- I based the design...
- Stop talking!

996
01:15:30,412 --> 01:15:31,564
Come on!

997
01:15:31,894 --> 01:15:32,456
Now, remember..

998
01:15:32,457 --> 01:15:33,611
Scream as hard as you can!

999
01:15:33,866 --> 01:15:35,273
We need the sound wave
to be the supersonic.

1000
01:15:35,402 --> 01:15:37,397
Catch in the right angel,
you should continue!

1001
01:15:37,639 --> 01:15:39,104
I should continue?

1002
01:15:40,068 --> 01:15:41,138
Encouragingly!

1003
01:15:41,729 --> 01:15:42,984
Good luck!

1004
01:15:43,683 --> 01:15:44,939
And don't forget to scream!

1005
01:15:54,881 --> 01:15:58,069
If you want to beat me this time,
you have to send the beast free!

1006
01:15:59,430 --> 01:16:00,845
On your marks.

1007
01:16:01,730 --> 01:16:02,676
Get set.

1008
01:16:03,149 --> 01:16:03,739
Go!

1009
01:16:18,501 --> 01:16:20,634
Oh.. Congratulations, my friend!

1010
01:16:21,106 --> 01:16:22,462
Robert Louis Stevenson
would have been proud.

1011
01:16:24,716 --> 01:16:25,674
Impressive, Hank!

1012
01:16:26,281 --> 01:16:28,112
You like those,
Ain't that like a red nose?

1013
01:16:28,278 --> 01:16:29,372
Right, Bozo?

1014
01:16:30,011 --> 01:16:31,115
I'm done here!

1015
01:16:31,116 --> 01:16:31,773
Thank you, Alex!

1016
01:16:33,214 --> 01:16:34,175
Come on, Hank!

1017
01:16:45,331 --> 01:16:48,088
If you're using half of
concentration to look normal..

1018
01:16:48,578 --> 01:16:51,367
Then you're only half-paid
attention do whatever else you do.

1019
01:16:52,049 --> 01:16:52,695
Just calm down..

1020
01:16:52,696 --> 01:16:54,049
So point to something could save your life!

1021
01:16:58,811 --> 01:17:00,733
You want consorter to accept you.

1022
01:17:01,275 --> 01:17:03,285
And you can't even accept yourself!

1023
01:17:09,963 --> 01:17:10,710
Sexy!

1024
01:17:11,523 --> 01:17:14,853
We can pull off this, it's just in producible.
The real one will look consider be better!

1025
01:17:15,018 --> 01:17:15,533
The whole suit.

1026
01:17:15,534 --> 01:17:18,512
See? These, sensors measured energy.
I'll put this panel.

1027
01:17:18,659 --> 01:17:20,659
Focuse is in the access of the absorbent.

1028
01:17:20,660 --> 01:17:23,474
Well, we'll try having one in the middle.
Just one in the middle, alright?

1029
01:17:23,892 --> 01:17:25,207
Good luck!

1030
01:17:35,499 --> 01:17:36,192
God! You must see this!

1031
01:17:36,193 --> 01:17:38,177
Your genes are extraordinary, you know that?

1032
01:17:38,295 --> 01:17:39,754
Your cells age, have
the rate of normal female.

1033
01:17:39,885 --> 01:17:42,274
When you're 40 you'll still have a look like of teenager.

1034
01:17:43,109 --> 01:17:46,260
You have the most incredible
cellular structure, I ever seen!

1035
01:17:51,473 --> 01:17:53,127
Would you believe, I'll fly this time?

1036
01:17:53,128 --> 01:17:54,801
Unreasonably!

1037
01:17:55,309 --> 01:17:55,950
I trust you.

1038
01:17:56,066 --> 01:17:57,602
- I'm touched.
- I don't trust him.

1039
01:17:57,753 --> 01:17:58,369
Say nothing!

1040
01:17:59,368 --> 01:18:00,502
I'm gonna die!

1041
01:18:06,277 --> 01:18:07,429
Erik!

1042
01:18:19,062 --> 01:18:19,806
Wow!

1043
01:18:28,762 --> 01:18:29,346
What?

1044
01:18:29,913 --> 01:18:31,616
You know we were thinking at same!

1045
01:18:32,454 --> 01:18:34,279
What a work have you done!
Thank you very much!

1046
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:34,901
Alright, Alex..

1047
01:18:34,902 --> 01:18:35,891
I want you to hit the X.

1048
01:18:36,746 --> 01:18:38,541
And try not to hit me,
that's good, champ!

1049
01:18:39,003 --> 01:18:40,347
You serious?

1050
01:18:40,824 --> 01:18:41,864
I'm very serious!

1051
01:18:42,395 --> 01:18:44,526
I've complete an ample faith in you!

1052
01:18:57,442 --> 01:18:58,782
I'm still a Bozo?

1053
01:18:58,783 --> 01:19:00,858
Yes, Hank.
You still a Bozo.

1054
01:19:02,303 --> 01:19:03,168
But, nice job!

1055
01:19:06,366 --> 01:19:07,218
See that?

1056
01:19:08,156 --> 01:19:09,717
Try to turn it face us.

1057
01:19:29,231 --> 01:19:30,033
You know..

1058
01:19:30,342 --> 01:19:34,565
I believe, the true force is lies somewhere,
between rage, and surreality.

1059
01:19:35,621 --> 01:19:38,164
Would you mind, if I..

1060
01:20:12,166 --> 01:20:13,433
What did you just do to me?

1061
01:20:15,115 --> 01:20:18,547
I accessed the brightest corner
of your memory system.

1062
01:20:20,654 --> 01:20:22,838
Very beautiful memory, Erik.
Thank you!

1063
01:20:23,722 --> 01:20:25,848
I didn't know, I still have brightness.

1064
01:20:27,004 --> 01:20:29,063
There's so much more,
than you think know.

1065
01:20:29,942 --> 01:20:31,063
Not just pain..

1066
01:20:31,064 --> 01:20:31,963
And anger.

1067
01:20:32,942 --> 01:20:34,838
It's good into you,
I felt it.

1068
01:20:35,696 --> 01:20:37,543
When you can access whole over..

1069
01:20:38,124 --> 01:20:40,810
You'll possess a power,
no one can imagine.

1070
01:20:42,396 --> 01:20:43,318
Not even me!

1071
01:20:45,248 --> 01:20:46,001
So, come on!

1072
01:20:46,654 --> 01:20:47,362
Try again.

1073
01:21:28,378 --> 01:21:29,957
- Hey!
- Well done!

1074
01:21:30,232 --> 01:21:31,925
The President on television taking a speech.

1075
01:21:34,065 --> 01:21:36,159
<i>It shall be the policy of this nation...</i>

1076
01:21:36,584 --> 01:21:39,668
<i>To regard any nuclear missle,
crossing the embargo line..</i>

1077
01:21:39,889 --> 01:21:41,510
<i>That surrounds Cuba.</i>

1078
01:21:41,874 --> 01:21:45,562
<i>As an attack by the Soviet
Union on the United States.</i>

1079
01:21:46,373 --> 01:21:50,053
<i>Requiring a fully terrorist response,
upon the Soviet Union..</i>

1080
01:21:50,054 --> 01:21:51,406
That's how we gonna find Shaw.

1081
01:21:51,407 --> 01:21:52,054
How do you know?

1082
01:21:52,209 --> 01:21:53,514
Two superpowers facing of.

1083
01:21:53,515 --> 01:21:55,254
He wants to stop, World War III.

1084
01:21:55,891 --> 01:21:57,595
He want leave as to take a chance.

1085
01:21:57,951 --> 01:21:59,143
So much for the diplomacy.

1086
01:22:00,132 --> 01:22:01,659
I suggest you all get a good night sleep.

1087
01:22:02,453 --> 01:22:04,094
<i>...All eventually, leads to war.</i>

1088
01:22:07,085 --> 01:22:08,912
<i>..As the missel ship, nears Cuba.</i>

1089
01:22:09,779 --> 01:22:13,819
<i>All diplomatic efforts to avoidance nuclear war.
That gaves wrong damage.</i>

1090
01:22:14,552 --> 01:22:18,800
<i>As the American people ready themselves
for the mightly war of an atomic attack.</i>

1091
01:22:19,241 --> 01:22:21,644
<i>There are reproducible reports of panicking.</i>

1092
01:22:22,148 --> 01:22:24,012
<i>Supermarkets cleared.</i>

1093
01:22:24,013 --> 01:22:29,186
<i>As shelves unused since the Second World War,
are started for what may had.</i>

1094
01:22:29,450 --> 01:22:33,675
In all its history, America has
never faced a greater threat.

1095
01:22:34,377 --> 01:22:35,874
The world is brace for war.

1096
01:22:36,221 --> 01:22:37,871
And there is no one to stop me!

1097
01:22:43,561 --> 01:22:44,711
Come in!

1098
01:22:45,338 --> 01:22:46,753
Hi!

1099
01:22:47,833 --> 01:22:48,994
Hava surprise for you!

1100
01:22:58,694 --> 01:23:01,337
I isolated the right marker in
your DNA example..

1101
01:23:01,889 --> 01:23:03,649
The serum works like an antibiotic.

1102
01:23:04,086 --> 01:23:06,367
Attacking the cells that
causes the physical mutation.

1103
01:23:07,346 --> 01:23:09,195
It won't effect our abilities,
just our appearance.

1104
01:23:12,179 --> 01:23:13,771
Do you still wanna do this?

1105
01:23:15,592 --> 01:23:17,128
Should we have to hide?

1106
01:23:19,001 --> 01:23:20,000
You're already do!

1107
01:23:21,037 --> 01:23:23,374
You're hiding right now,
like I hide my whole life.

1108
01:23:24,249 --> 01:23:25,868
I don't wanna feel like a freak.

1109
01:23:26,274 --> 01:23:28,154
All the time, I just wanted look..

1110
01:23:28,155 --> 01:23:28,985
Normal.

1111
01:23:29,008 --> 01:23:29,905
Yeah!

1112
01:23:37,605 --> 01:23:38,481
Hank, don't!

1113
01:23:40,765 --> 01:23:42,188
You are beautiful, Hank!

1114
01:23:42,889 --> 01:23:44,805
Every thing you are,
you are perfect!

1115
01:23:47,537 --> 01:23:50,787
Look at all of us.
Look at all what have we achieve this week!

1116
01:23:51,024 --> 01:23:52,223
All we will achieve..

1117
01:23:54,123 --> 01:23:55,419
We are different,

1118
01:23:56,614 --> 01:23:58,934
but we shouldn't be
trying to fit in the society.

1119
01:23:59,973 --> 01:24:02,446
Society should inspire
to be more like us.

1120
01:24:03,942 --> 01:24:07,131
Mutant, and proud!

1121
01:24:12,252 --> 01:24:13,845
But whose wanna tell you?

1122
01:24:14,231 --> 01:24:16,049
And even, if we save the world, tomorrow..

1123
01:24:16,578 --> 01:24:18,483
And mutions are accepted into the society..

1124
01:24:19,696 --> 01:24:22,016
My feet, and your natural form..

1125
01:24:22,959 --> 01:24:24,806
Never been that beautiful.

1126
01:24:30,477 --> 01:24:31,805
You look beautiful now!

1127
01:24:34,065 --> 01:24:36,758
We need, this cure!

1128
01:25:04,025 --> 01:25:07,372
Cuba, Russia, America.

1129
01:25:08,008 --> 01:25:08,862
Makes no difference.

1130
01:25:09,895 --> 01:25:12,297
Shaw's declared war
on mankind, and all of us!

1131
01:25:13,167 --> 01:25:14,361
He has to be stopped.

1132
01:25:15,599 --> 01:25:16,869
I'm not gonna stop Shaw.

1133
01:25:17,963 --> 01:25:18,823
I'm gonna kill him!

1134
01:25:22,004 --> 01:25:23,713
Do you have any tallow then?

1135
01:25:30,192 --> 01:25:32,394
You've no longer know why I was here, Charles.

1136
01:25:33,251 --> 01:25:34,487
The things have changed.

1137
01:25:35,314 --> 01:25:40,092
What's starts as uncoverd mission,
tomorrow, mankind will know that mution's exist.

1138
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:44,416
They fear us.

1139
01:25:44,930 --> 01:25:46,837
That fear will turn out to hating.

1140
01:25:47,128 --> 01:25:48,508
No if we stopped the World War.

1141
01:25:49,187 --> 01:25:52,367
No if we can proved Shaw.
Not if we rescue or life doing so.

1142
01:25:52,502 --> 01:25:53,892
They'll do the same for us.

1143
01:25:53,893 --> 01:25:57,032
- We're having to be the better man.
- We already are!

1144
01:25:57,972 --> 01:25:59,649
We're the next age of human evolution.

1145
01:25:59,650 --> 01:26:00,781
- You said it yourself..
- No, we don't.

1146
01:26:01,611 --> 01:26:05,717
Are you really so naive,
as to think they won't battle their own extinction?

1147
01:26:07,851 --> 01:26:08,914
Or it's arrogants?

1148
01:26:09,218 --> 01:26:09,996
I'm sorry?

1149
01:26:11,079 --> 01:26:13,007
After tomorrow, they're gonna terminate us.

1150
01:26:13,249 --> 01:26:16,478
Are you blinded?
Because you believe they're more like Moira.

1151
01:26:16,995 --> 01:26:18,519
You believe, they're all Shaw.

1152
01:26:20,988 --> 01:26:23,918
Listen to me, very
carefully, my friend.

1153
01:26:25,130 --> 01:26:28,057
Killing Shaw, will not bring you peace!

1154
01:26:29,644 --> 01:26:31,791
Peace, weren't ever an option!

1155
01:27:18,445 --> 01:27:19,059
No!

1156
01:27:22,053 --> 01:27:22,612
No..

1157
01:27:24,266 --> 01:27:25,971
No.

1158
01:27:50,721 --> 01:27:52,642
Wow!

1159
01:27:54,515 --> 01:27:56,133
That's a surprise!

1160
01:27:56,786 --> 01:27:57,634
The nice kind?

1161
01:27:59,704 --> 01:28:00,665
Get out, Raven.

1162
01:28:01,595 --> 01:28:02,569
I wanna go to bed.

1163
01:28:03,080 --> 01:28:05,067
Maybe in a few years!

1164
01:28:09,310 --> 01:28:10,984
How about now?

1165
01:28:16,032 --> 01:28:17,969
I prefer the real Raven.

1166
01:28:21,714 --> 01:28:24,311
I said, the real Raven!

1167
01:28:34,227 --> 01:28:35,250
Perfection!

1168
01:28:39,651 --> 01:28:41,517
Could you pass me my robe?

1169
01:28:41,906 --> 01:28:43,190
You don't have to hide.

1170
01:28:48,059 --> 01:28:51,445
Have you ever looked at a tiger,
thought you had to cover up?

1171
01:28:54,175 --> 01:28:55,859
No, but..

1172
01:28:55,860 --> 01:28:57,678
You're an exquisite creature, Raven.

1173
01:28:59,667 --> 01:29:02,100
All your life,
the world has tried to tain you.

1174
01:29:03,020 --> 01:29:04,481
It's time for you to be free.

1175
01:29:25,579 --> 01:29:27,831
Now, sometimes I wonder what
my life what have been like..

1176
01:29:29,907 --> 01:29:30,531
What?

1177
01:29:30,532 --> 01:29:31,419
Oh God!

1178
01:29:33,244 --> 01:29:36,346
For God sake, Raven.
Wear your clothes.

1179
01:29:37,901 --> 01:29:39,759
That's not what you said,
when you first saw me.

1180
01:29:40,206 --> 01:29:42,980
I guess pets always cuter,
when they're little, right?

1181
01:29:43,979 --> 01:29:45,821
Raven, I don't know what's got into you.

1182
01:29:46,540 --> 01:29:47,808
I saw you been in good mood.

1183
01:29:48,308 --> 01:29:49,126
Hank..

1184
01:29:49,838 --> 01:29:50,165
He tells me, he has found the
answer to your cosmetic problem.

1185
01:29:55,676 --> 01:29:58,229
You gonna tell me what's the matter,
or I will have to read your mind?

1186
01:29:58,342 --> 01:30:00,160
You promised me,
you would never do that!

1187
01:30:00,429 --> 01:30:01,554
Until recently..

1188
01:30:01,555 --> 01:30:04,809
I never had to use my power, to know
what you're thinking about, Raven.

1189
01:30:05,067 --> 01:30:05,667
You know, Charles..

1190
01:30:05,668 --> 01:30:08,488
I used to think, it's gonna be me and you,
against he world!

1191
01:30:08,899 --> 01:30:12,306
But no matter how the bad world gets,
you don't want to be against. Do you?

1192
01:30:12,307 --> 01:30:13,563
You wanna be a part of it!

1193
01:30:36,148 --> 01:30:37,146
What the hell happened here?

1194
01:30:45,415 --> 01:30:47,062
Hank has been busy.

1195
01:30:47,632 --> 01:30:48,874
Do we really have to wear these?

1196
01:30:49,681 --> 01:30:53,642
There's none of us mutated to enjoy
extreme G force, or be immune by bullets.

1197
01:30:53,771 --> 01:30:55,107
I suggest we suit up.

1198
01:30:59,295 --> 01:31:01,684
<i>Airbase</i>

1199
01:31:20,151 --> 01:31:21,247
Where is Hank?

1200
01:31:22,948 --> 01:31:24,324
I'm here.

1201
01:31:34,129 --> 01:31:34,763
Hank?

1202
01:31:40,337 --> 01:31:42,673
It didn't attacked the cells.

1203
01:31:44,092 --> 01:31:45,388
Didn't handle them.

1204
01:31:47,267 --> 01:31:48,974
It didn't work.

1205
01:31:49,472 --> 01:31:50,853
Yes, it did, Hank.

1206
01:31:51,266 --> 01:31:52,451
Don't you see?

1207
01:31:52,639 --> 01:31:55,038
This is, who you meant to be.

1208
01:31:56,147 --> 01:31:57,549
This is you!

1209
01:31:59,506 --> 01:32:00,733
No more hiding.

1210
01:32:01,759 --> 01:32:02,831
You're like a bad-ass!

1211
01:32:03,399 --> 01:32:05,641
Hank?

1212
01:32:06,065 --> 01:32:08,245
Don't mock me!

1213
01:32:08,627 --> 01:32:10,400
Hank, put him down immediately, please!

1214
01:32:10,533 --> 01:32:11,424
Hank, Hank!

1215
01:32:14,542 --> 01:32:15,203
I wasn't!

1216
01:32:15,981 --> 01:32:18,191
Even I got to admit you look pretty bad-ass!

1217
01:32:18,669 --> 01:32:19,924
I think, I gotta new name for you..

1218
01:32:20,896 --> 01:32:21,746
Beast!

1219
01:32:24,641 --> 01:32:25,875
You sure, you can fly this thing?

1220
01:32:26,132 --> 01:32:26,986
Of course, I can!

1221
01:32:27,668 --> 01:32:29,002
I designed it!

1222
01:32:31,233 --> 01:32:35,075
<i>Cuba</i>

1223
01:32:40,747 --> 01:32:42,005
Porterage in the target?

1224
01:32:42,454 --> 01:32:45,812
Rect 1-8-0,
12 knots.

1225
01:32:47,976 --> 01:32:50,071
3 minutes to the embargoed, sir.

1226
01:32:51,562 --> 01:32:53,327
God help 'em, if they crossed it.

1227
01:32:55,503 --> 01:32:57,093
God help us all.

1228
01:32:57,673 --> 01:32:59,030
Send to general quarters.

1229
01:32:59,241 --> 01:33:00,808
General quarters,
General quarters!

1230
01:33:01,422 --> 01:33:03,787
- All plants been back to station?
- Aye, sir!

1231
01:33:03,949 --> 01:33:05,844
State condition, zero.

1232
01:33:06,296 --> 01:33:08,470
General quarter, back to station.

1233
01:33:18,700 --> 01:33:21,332
<i>Captain, sir.
We've our commands.</i>

1234
01:33:21,333 --> 01:33:23,713
<i>Why you need other commands?</i>

1235
01:33:24,316 --> 01:33:31,778
<i>I've been in a war, my friend.
I don't want another one.</i>

1236
01:33:33,682 --> 01:33:36,228
<i>Get your positions!</i>

1237
01:33:36,909 --> 01:33:37,953
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

1238
01:33:38,916 --> 01:33:43,650
<i>Rects are,

1239
01:33:45,761 --> 01:33:48,733
<i>Missiles are ready.</i>

1240
01:33:49,366 --> 01:33:50,962
<i>There's commands
from the Palace, sir!</i>

1241
01:33:51,449 --> 01:33:55,513
<i>Commands for a bearer of the missiles,</i>

01:33:55,677 --> 01:33:58,531
<i>And change it's destination

01:33:58,532 --> 01:34:02,306
<i>To the Arrel prow, over.
To the Arrel prow, over.</i>

1244
01:34:03,820 --> 01:34:04,859
<i>There's no any respond, sir.</i>

1245
01:34:05,059 --> 01:34:06,135
<i>It's not changing it's destination.</i>

1246
01:34:06,622 --> 01:34:11,115
<i>You have your commands to change your destination,
and go back. Do not cross the line!</i>

1247
01:34:11,786 --> 01:34:13,434
Target ready to be fired, sir.

1248
01:34:13,738 --> 01:34:15,938
- Sand by to fire.
- Standing by, sir.

1249
01:34:24,530 --> 01:34:25,246
Wow!

1250
01:34:29,023 --> 01:34:30,961
Looks pretty nasty, out there.

1251
01:34:40,396 --> 01:34:43,125
<i>To the Arrel prow, over.
To the Arrel prow..</i>

1252
01:34:43,126 --> 01:34:44,548
<i>We command you to
change the destination.</i>

1253
01:34:48,494 --> 01:34:49,857
He still here, somewhere!

1254
01:34:49,859 --> 01:34:51,976
That ship is on the coast of embargo line.

1255
01:34:51,977 --> 01:34:54,314
That ship corsses the line,
our boys are gonna blow it up!

1256
01:34:54,703 --> 01:34:55,609
And the war begins.

1257
01:34:56,524 --> 01:34:58,607
Unless they're not, our boys.

1258
01:35:01,004 --> 01:35:03,521
USA Independence,
this is Alexander Nevsky.

1259
01:35:03,968 --> 01:35:05,934
<i>We've lost control of our cargo ship.</i>

1260
01:35:06,213 --> 01:35:06,974
<i>We've commanded to stop.
Do not fire!</i>

1261
01:35:08,714 --> 01:35:10,522
<i>We repeat,
do not fire!</i>

1262
01:35:10,711 --> 01:35:11,562
The signal of cargo ship
is turning around, sir.

1263
01:35:13,973 --> 01:35:14,846
It's a ruse.

1264
01:35:15,326 --> 01:35:16,332
Stay know of it.

1265
01:35:16,433 --> 01:35:17,510
Stand by to fire.

1266
01:35:18,041 --> 01:35:19,322
Standing by to fire, sir!

1267
01:35:19,323 --> 01:35:20,313
On my count..

1268
01:35:20,780 --> 01:35:22,617
Five..
Four..

1269
01:35:45,356 --> 01:35:47,207
Hold on!
Hold on!

1270
01:35:56,198 --> 01:35:57,002
No!

1271
01:36:01,888 --> 01:36:02,552
What was that?

1272
01:36:02,844 --> 01:36:03,685
The Russians..

1273
01:36:03,686 --> 01:36:05,158
They've fired on their own ship!

1274
01:36:05,772 --> 01:36:07,893
Allow warning next time, Professor?

1275
01:36:07,894 --> 01:36:09,433
Sorry about that!
Are you alright?

1276
01:36:10,194 --> 01:36:10,895
Yeah!

1277
01:36:11,486 --> 01:36:12,413
Son of..

1278
01:36:12,971 --> 01:36:15,305
Give me commander on the line.
I need to know new orders.

1279
01:36:19,311 --> 01:36:21,680
Congratulations, my friend.

1280
01:36:21,902 --> 01:36:25,594
You have just avoided us a nuclear war.

1281
01:36:26,360 --> 01:36:27,418
What?

1282
01:36:27,892 --> 01:36:29,242
Arrest him, and put him in the cell.

1283
01:36:29,423 --> 01:36:33,300
What? Why?
What happened?

1284
01:36:33,424 --> 01:36:35,130
They say, their comrade has lost his mind!

1285
01:36:35,332 --> 01:36:36,782
Americans are applauding.

1286
01:36:38,503 --> 01:36:39,810
They're here!

1287
01:36:39,986 --> 01:36:41,837
That telepath is powerful!

1288
01:36:44,296 --> 01:36:46,219
I'm going to the backup plan.

1289
01:36:48,863 --> 01:36:51,350
- That was inspired, Charles.
- Thank you very much.

1290
01:36:51,352 --> 01:36:52,787
But I still can't locate Shaw.

1291
01:36:53,034 --> 01:36:54,826
He's down there.
we need to find him, now!

1292
01:36:55,231 --> 01:36:55,636
Hank?

1293
01:36:56,037 --> 01:36:57,969
Is there anything unusual
on the radio or scanners?

1294
01:36:58,155 --> 01:36:58,925
No.

1295
01:36:59,371 --> 01:37:00,134
Nothing.

1296
01:37:00,859 --> 01:37:02,549
Will, then he must be under water.

1297
01:37:02,619 --> 01:37:04,671
And obviously, we don't have sonar.

1298
01:37:06,695 --> 01:37:07,895
Yes, we do!

1299
01:37:08,709 --> 01:37:09,362
Yes, we do.

1300
01:37:14,215 --> 01:37:15,323
They are ready for war.

1301
01:37:15,345 --> 01:37:18,001
We just need to scratch another
matches to let the fuse.

1302
01:37:18,270 --> 01:37:21,255
And we still have the most
powerful weapon available.

1303
01:37:22,069 --> 01:37:22,634
Me!

1304
01:37:23,285 --> 01:37:26,107
Turn the nuclear reactor to %100 output.

1305
01:37:26,144 --> 01:37:28,389
And make sure,
I'm not disturbed.

1306
01:37:31,645 --> 01:37:32,251
Hank!

1307
01:37:32,252 --> 01:37:33,689
Steady the bloody plane!

1308
01:37:38,871 --> 01:37:39,667
Hey!

1309
01:37:40,154 --> 01:37:41,313
You're right back off!

1310
01:37:41,994 --> 01:37:44,445
Beast, open the back plane door!

1311
01:37:52,411 --> 01:37:53,574
Remember..

1312
01:37:54,023 --> 01:37:55,031
It's the muscle!

1313
01:37:55,458 --> 01:37:59,212
You control it.
You'll be with me, entire time!

1314
01:37:59,596 --> 01:38:00,989
Hope see you soon!

1315
01:38:01,475 --> 01:38:02,497
On my mark!

1316
01:38:03,007 --> 01:38:06,096
Three.. Two.. One!

1317
01:38:07,063 --> 01:38:08,076
Go!

1318
01:38:23,205 --> 01:38:25,528
Let the fleet,
their men is in down!

1319
01:38:38,772 --> 01:38:40,420
Banshee has got the location of Shaw.

1320
01:38:42,909 --> 01:38:45,849
- You ready for this?
- Let's find out!

1321
01:39:43,459 --> 01:39:45,014
Come on!

1322
01:39:49,484 --> 01:39:53,706
Remember, the point between
rage, and surreality.

1323
01:41:17,595 --> 01:41:18,651
Erik, take my hand!

1324
01:41:20,090 --> 01:41:21,587
Uhh...
Hold on guys!

1325
01:41:22,175 --> 01:41:23,381
It's gonna get uncomfortable.

1326
01:41:38,360 --> 01:41:40,327
Erik, take my hand!

1327
01:42:14,149 --> 01:42:14,883
Damn!

1328
01:42:30,997 --> 01:42:31,552
Moira?

1329
01:42:31,772 --> 01:42:32,665
Moira, are you alright?

1330
01:42:32,797 --> 01:42:33,710
Yeah, I'm okay!

1331
01:42:38,742 --> 01:42:40,076
I read the teleporter's mind.

1332
01:42:40,254 --> 01:42:42,723
Shaw's absorbing all the
power out of his submarine.

1333
01:42:42,724 --> 01:42:44,779
He's turning himself to
somekind of nuclear bomb.

1334
01:42:44,781 --> 01:42:47,056
We've got no time, we have to got it,
before it gonna out of control.

1335
01:42:47,272 --> 01:42:48,149
Alright, Moira.
This is what we going to do.

1336
01:42:48,150 --> 01:42:50,585
Get the radio, tell the camp boat
leave out, immediately.

1337
01:42:50,848 --> 01:42:51,480
I'm going in!

1338
01:42:51,607 --> 01:42:53,343
Beast! Havok!
Back them up!

1339
01:42:53,344 --> 01:42:55,593
Erik, I can guid you to be sure in.

1340
01:42:55,594 --> 01:42:58,240
But, I need you to shut down
whatever it is, that blocks me.

1341
01:42:58,241 --> 01:43:00,275
And then we just have to hope to God,
it's not too late to stop him.

1342
01:43:00,276 --> 01:43:01,219
- Got it!
- Good luck!

1343
01:43:02,057 --> 01:43:03,068
Raven, stop!

1344
01:43:03,069 --> 01:43:04,278
I'm going to help them!

1345
01:43:04,279 --> 01:43:05,007
We don't have time to this.

1346
01:43:05,008 --> 01:43:07,057
Anything comes in to enter,
you've got to take care of it.

1347
01:43:07,187 --> 01:43:09,030
- Yes?
- Fine!

1348
01:43:30,177 --> 01:43:31,682
If we go,
you go!

1349
01:43:35,233 --> 01:43:37,534
We think that Shaw, is tring to
create somekind of bomb!

1350
01:43:42,736 --> 01:43:43,413
Erik..

1351
01:43:43,831 --> 01:43:45,253
Go to the middle of the submarine.

1352
01:43:45,420 --> 01:43:47,227
That's the point, my mind
can't telepath.

1353
01:43:47,228 --> 01:43:49,252
We have to assume,
that's where Shaw is!

1354
01:43:57,840 --> 01:43:59,826
Stay there,
Stay there!

1355
01:44:06,928 --> 01:44:08,373
That's a nuclear reactor!

1356
01:44:09,120 --> 01:44:10,080
Disable it!

1357
01:44:21,949 --> 01:44:23,871
Stop!
Don't move!

1358
01:44:31,612 --> 01:44:32,432
Get down!

1359
01:44:56,506 --> 01:44:57,791
Erik, you're there
have reached void.

1360
01:44:57,973 --> 01:44:59,889
He's not here, Charles.
Shaw's not here!

1361
01:44:59,890 --> 01:45:00,884
He's left the sub!

1362
01:45:01,058 --> 01:45:04,580
What? He's got to be there. He has to be.
There's no where else he can be in. Keep looking!

1363
01:45:04,903 --> 01:45:07,233
But I'm telling you, he's not!
He's not here, goddamn it!

1364
01:45:10,447 --> 01:45:12,247
Erik!

1365
01:45:13,374 --> 01:45:14,926
What a pleasant surprise.

1366
01:45:14,927 --> 01:45:16,699
Erik?
Erik?

1367
01:45:19,120 --> 01:45:20,395
So good to see you, again!

1368
01:45:37,423 --> 01:45:38,964
Might I ask you something?

1369
01:45:40,822 --> 01:45:42,530
Why are you in their side?

1370
01:45:42,911 --> 01:45:43,990
- He's gone!
- What?

1371
01:45:43,991 --> 01:45:46,853
He's gone into the void.
I can't communicate with him there.

1372
01:45:47,061 --> 01:45:49,743
Why fight for a doomed race,
they'll hunt us down..

1373
01:45:49,744 --> 01:45:52,366
As soon as they realize,
their race is coming to an end!

1374
01:46:21,083 --> 01:46:22,412
Yeah!

1375
01:46:22,880 --> 01:46:23,835
Yeah!

1376
01:46:40,165 --> 01:46:41,549
I really am!

1377
01:46:50,169 --> 01:46:51,436
He's back!

1378
01:46:52,084 --> 01:46:55,027
<i>Erik, whatever you do, keep doing it.
It's going to work!</i>

1379
01:46:56,349 --> 01:46:57,469
But, every thing I did..

1380
01:46:57,962 --> 01:46:58,968
I did for you!

1381
01:46:59,581 --> 01:47:00,810
To unlock you power.

1382
01:47:00,996 --> 01:47:03,365
To make you impressed!

1383
01:47:07,149 --> 01:47:07,787
It's working!

1384
01:47:07,781 --> 01:47:10,609
I've got started to see him,
but I can't yet touch his mind.

1385
01:47:24,681 --> 01:47:26,962
Come along way,
from banding gates.

1386
01:47:27,742 --> 01:47:29,307
I'm so proud of you!

1387
01:47:37,312 --> 01:47:39,488
And you just started
to scratch the surface.

1388
01:47:39,967 --> 01:47:44,070
Look how much we can order if worked together!

1389
01:48:03,568 --> 01:48:05,906
Stop, Azazel!

1390
01:48:20,794 --> 01:48:22,376
I don't want to hurt you, Erik.

1391
01:48:22,647 --> 01:48:23,455
I never did.

1392
01:48:24,539 --> 01:48:25,568
I wanna help you.

1393
01:48:25,569 --> 01:48:27,007
This is our time..

1394
01:48:27,598 --> 01:48:29,152
Our age.

1395
01:48:29,672 --> 01:48:31,790
We are the future..

1396
01:48:32,147 --> 01:48:33,232
Of the human race.

1397
01:48:34,467 --> 01:48:35,687
You and me, son.

1398
01:48:36,926 --> 01:48:38,659
This world, could be ours!

1399
01:48:41,129 --> 01:48:42,485
Everything you did..

1400
01:48:42,783 --> 01:48:44,089
Made me stronger.

1401
01:48:45,931 --> 01:48:47,914
Made me the what I am today!

1402
01:48:50,046 --> 01:48:51,419
That's the truth.

1403
01:48:52,918 --> 01:48:54,409
I've known my all life.

1404
01:49:00,925 --> 01:49:02,799
You are my creator!

1405
01:49:03,766 --> 01:49:05,378
No, Charles!
Na!

1406
01:49:06,702 --> 01:49:07,862
Are you okay?

1407
01:49:08,246 --> 01:49:10,642
Moira, if you qiut.
I can not control this man for so long!

1408
01:49:23,318 --> 01:49:25,468
Sorry, Charles.

1409
01:49:25,469 --> 01:49:26,350
<i>Erik, please..</i>

1410
01:49:26,351 --> 01:49:27,469
<i>be the better man!</i>

1411
01:49:28,025 --> 01:49:28,927
But I don't trust you.

1412
01:49:28,928 --> 01:49:30,370
<i>Erik, there will be no turning back!</i>

1413
01:49:31,587 --> 01:49:32,756
No!

1414
01:49:33,322 --> 01:49:35,646
Don't do this, Erik!

1415
01:49:42,979 --> 01:49:44,025
If you are in there..

1416
01:49:44,565 --> 01:49:47,716
I would like you to know,
that I agree with every word you said.

1417
01:49:50,408 --> 01:49:51,524
We are the future..

1418
01:49:54,269 --> 01:49:55,541
But..

1419
01:49:57,282 --> 01:50:00,762
Unfortunately, you killed my mother.

1420
01:50:09,775 --> 01:50:11,745
This is what we going to do..

1421
01:50:11,746 --> 01:50:13,803
No!
Please, Erik.. No!

1422
01:50:14,183 --> 01:50:15,519
I'm going to count to 3.

1423
01:50:16,102 --> 01:50:17,671
And I'm going to move the coin.

1424
01:50:19,356 --> 01:50:20,420
One..

1425
01:50:22,354 --> 01:50:24,022
Please, Erik!

1426
01:50:32,376 --> 01:50:33,372
Two..

1427
01:50:40,453 --> 01:50:41,555
Three!

1428
01:50:43,190 --> 01:50:45,286
No...

1429
01:50:47,642 --> 01:50:50,266
no...

1430
01:50:52,266 --> 01:50:55,235
no...

1431
01:51:10,784 --> 01:51:13,311
The Russians, share our concerns.

1432
01:51:13,675 --> 01:51:16,173
And will join us to strike
on all the mutions.

1433
01:51:16,453 --> 01:51:18,236
We can end this threat for good.

1434
01:51:18,624 --> 01:51:20,653
We'll never have an opportunity like this.

1435
01:51:20,654 --> 01:51:22,414
We have an agent
on that beach.

1436
01:51:22,767 --> 01:51:23,947
One agent!

1437
01:51:24,422 --> 01:51:25,685
She's a good agent!

1438
01:51:26,197 --> 01:51:27,654
She is a collateral damage.

1439
01:51:33,829 --> 01:51:35,723
Today, our fighting stops.

1440
01:52:00,315 --> 01:52:02,584
Take off your blinders, brothers ans sisters.

1441
01:52:03,392 --> 01:52:05,087
The real enemy is out there.

1442
01:52:06,885 --> 01:52:09,139
I feel their guns moving in the water.

1443
01:52:09,447 --> 01:52:11,621
Their metal targeting us.

1444
01:52:12,060 --> 01:52:16,018
Americans, Soviets, human..

1445
01:52:17,001 --> 01:52:19,155
Uniting their fear in unknown.

1446
01:52:20,434 --> 01:52:23,585
And the under fellas running scared,
my fellow mutions.

1447
01:52:26,414 --> 01:52:27,470
Go ahead, Charles.

1448
01:52:29,592 --> 01:52:31,566
Tell me, I'm wrong.

1449
01:52:51,338 --> 01:52:54,266
Fleer commander,
this is agent XB-70.

1450
01:52:54,577 --> 01:52:55,305
Respond, over!

1451
01:52:56,679 --> 01:52:59,615
The beach is securite,
call off the attack!

1452
01:52:59,616 --> 01:53:01,938
The beach is targeted in,
and ready to be fired upon, sir!

1453
01:53:02,214 --> 01:53:03,910
- Stand by.
- Standing by, sir!

1454
01:53:04,553 --> 01:53:06,586
<i>Do you hear me?
Stand by to fire the missiles!</i>

1455
01:53:08,718 --> 01:53:09,337
Hello?

1456
01:53:11,298 --> 01:53:12,779
Hello?

1457
01:53:20,853 --> 01:53:23,150
<i>- Fire!
- Fire!</i>

1458
01:54:11,310 --> 01:54:13,514
Erik, you said yourself,
We're the better man.

1459
01:54:14,727 --> 01:54:15,875
This is the time to prove it!

1460
01:54:20,019 --> 01:54:21,978
There's the thousands of
men on those ships.

1461
01:54:21,979 --> 01:54:23,747
Good, honest, innocnet men.

1462
01:54:24,355 --> 01:54:25,947
They're just following orders!

1463
01:54:27,957 --> 01:54:30,818
I've been in the mercy of the
man, just following orders.

1464
01:54:34,896 --> 01:54:36,503
Never again!

1465
01:54:41,266 --> 01:54:42,244
Erik, release them!

1466
01:54:49,184 --> 01:54:50,876
Don't!

1467
01:54:57,136 --> 01:54:58,329
- Don't wanna hurt you!
- Go hurt me!

1468
01:55:00,203 --> 01:55:01,465
Stay back!

1469
01:55:10,039 --> 01:55:11,720
Erik, stop!

1470
01:55:21,680 --> 01:55:24,474
Gentlmen, I was honored
by serving with you.

1471
01:56:13,840 --> 01:56:14,792
I'm so sorry!

1472
01:56:15,084 --> 01:56:16,773
I said, back off!

1473
01:56:18,969 --> 01:56:19,616
You..

1474
01:56:20,391 --> 01:56:21,365
You did this!

1475
01:56:25,310 --> 01:56:27,233
Erik, please..

1476
01:56:30,194 --> 01:56:31,583
She didn't do this, Erik.

1477
01:56:32,747 --> 01:56:33,784
You did!

1478
01:56:41,378 --> 01:56:45,756
Let's not turn on each other,
that's what they want!

1479
01:56:46,035 --> 01:56:47,387
I tried to warn you, Charles!

1480
01:56:49,859 --> 01:56:51,881
I want you by my side!

1481
01:56:52,699 --> 01:56:54,292
Like brothers, as you and I.

1482
01:56:54,959 --> 01:56:57,707
All of us, together.
protecting each other!

1483
01:56:59,642 --> 01:57:01,867
We want the same thing.

1484
01:57:03,441 --> 01:57:04,359
My friend..

1485
01:57:05,478 --> 01:57:06,511
I'm sorry..

1486
01:57:07,336 --> 01:57:08,692
But we do not!

1487
01:57:24,997 --> 01:57:27,308
Charles, I'm sorry!

1488
01:57:27,858 --> 01:57:28,680
I'm so sorry, Charles!

1489
01:57:29,092 --> 01:57:30,784
It's alright..
It's alright!

1490
01:57:31,399 --> 01:57:32,534
God..!

1491
01:57:34,908 --> 01:57:36,671
This society won't accept us.

1492
01:57:38,182 --> 01:57:39,621
We form our own.

1493
01:57:40,277 --> 01:57:42,115
The humans who have played their hand...

1494
01:57:44,787 --> 01:57:46,389
Now we get ready to play ours.

1495
01:57:49,867 --> 01:57:50,977
Who's with me?

1496
01:58:02,460 --> 01:58:03,366
No more hiding!

1497
01:58:30,282 --> 01:58:30,769
You..

1498
01:58:31,664 --> 01:58:32,724
You should go with him.

1499
01:58:33,306 --> 01:58:34,736
It's what you want.

1500
01:58:35,686 --> 01:58:37,467
You promised me never read my mind!

1501
01:58:38,068 --> 01:58:39,066
I don't..

1502
01:58:39,355 --> 01:58:41,825
I promised you I won't try anything I'm afraid.

1503
01:58:43,236 --> 01:58:43,877
I'm sorry!

1504
01:58:49,692 --> 01:58:50,665
Take care of him!

1505
01:59:06,139 --> 01:59:07,237
And, Beast..

1506
01:59:07,800 --> 01:59:08,861
Never forget..

1507
01:59:10,221 --> 01:59:12,968
Mutions, and proud.

1508
01:59:21,313 --> 01:59:23,664
- Help me up, come on!
- He's..

1509
01:59:24,106 --> 01:59:25,692
I'm gonna get yout hospital.

1510
01:59:26,201 --> 01:59:27,725
Wait, don't, don't!

1511
01:59:27,726 --> 01:59:29,234
Charles, don't move.
Okay?

1512
01:59:31,564 --> 01:59:32,494
Actually, I can't..

1513
01:59:33,571 --> 01:59:34,971
I can'...

1514
01:59:36,201 --> 01:59:37,792
I can't feel my legs.

1515
01:59:39,316 --> 01:59:41,409
I can't feel my legs!

1516
01:59:43,506 --> 01:59:45,598
I can't feel my legs!

1517
01:59:56,761 --> 01:59:58,505
<i>And this day of Thanks giving...</i>

1518
01:59:59,054 --> 02:00:00,651
<i>There's much we can be grateful.</i>

1519
02:00:00,968 --> 02:00:02,839
<i>As you look back,
to where we stood..</i>

1520
02:00:02,970 --> 02:00:04,272
<i>Only 4 weeks ago..</i>

1521
02:00:04,273 --> 02:00:06,015
<i>The unity of this hemisphere...</i>

1522
02:00:06,352 --> 02:00:10,207
<i>has supported our allies,
and calmed determination of the American people.</i>

1523
02:00:10,741 --> 02:00:13,368
<i>These qualities maybe tested
many more times, in this decade.</i>

1524
02:00:17,547 --> 02:00:20,216
So, how many students
do you think you'll have there?

1525
02:00:20,609 --> 02:00:22,492
Once you get the academy running?

1526
02:00:22,794 --> 02:00:24,674
As many, as I can manage.

1527
02:00:25,112 --> 02:00:26,605
Possibly, more

1528
02:00:29,415 --> 02:00:30,329
You know..

1529
02:00:31,534 --> 02:00:34,336
One day the government is gonna
realize how lucky they were..

1530
02:00:34,337 --> 02:00:36,173
To have the Professor X on their side!

1531
02:00:37,668 --> 02:00:39,835
As I suppose I'm a real professor now, am I not?

1532
02:00:40,066 --> 02:00:41,738
Last thing you know,
I'm gonna be bald!

1533
02:00:43,204 --> 02:00:45,497
We still in the government side, Moira.

1534
02:00:46,231 --> 02:00:48,633
We still the G men, just without the G.

1535
02:00:48,978 --> 02:00:51,787
No. You're on your team now.

1536
02:00:52,800 --> 02:00:53,773
It's better.

1537
02:00:54,914 --> 02:00:57,575
You're X-man.

1538
02:00:59,078 --> 02:00:59,924
Yeah..

1539
02:01:00,209 --> 02:01:01,360
I like th sound of that.

1540
02:01:01,677 --> 02:01:03,033
Moira..

1541
02:01:03,570 --> 02:01:04,342
For us..

1542
02:01:04,924 --> 02:01:07,860
Anonymity will be the line of defense.

1543
02:01:08,036 --> 02:01:09,119
I know!

1544
02:01:10,918 --> 02:01:14,414
They can threaten me,
all they want, Charles!

1545
02:01:15,428 --> 02:01:17,398
I'll never tell them, where you are.

1546
02:01:17,725 --> 02:01:19,534
Ever!

1547
02:01:20,056 --> 02:01:21,622
I know you won't.

1548
02:01:23,533 --> 02:01:25,155
I know..

1549
02:01:32,504 --> 02:01:34,744
I remember they attacked on H.Q.

1550
02:01:35,233 --> 02:01:37,108
Leaving and go somewhere else.

1551
02:01:37,974 --> 02:01:39,125
And then, this morning..

1552
02:01:39,564 --> 02:01:40,855
I woke up in home.

1553
02:01:41,975 --> 02:01:42,779
That's it!

1554
02:01:44,377 --> 02:01:46,315
All that time wipe
clean on your mind.

1555
02:01:46,616 --> 02:01:47,616
Just gone!

1556
02:01:48,354 --> 02:01:49,953
He can do that,
you don't remember anything?

1557
02:01:50,788 --> 02:01:53,718
Sometimes I get fragments.
Like..

1558
02:01:55,112 --> 02:01:55,708
Trees..

1559
02:01:57,346 --> 02:01:58,356
Sun light...

1560
02:02:00,307 --> 02:02:01,705
A kiss!

1561
02:02:01,706 --> 02:02:03,207
Oh, Jesus!

1562
02:02:03,977 --> 02:02:07,110
Gentlemen, that's why the CIA
has no place for a women.

1563
02:02:12,103 --> 02:02:13,666
What the hell was that?!

1564
02:02:30,175 --> 02:02:32,047
I know, we've our differences.

1565
02:02:35,157 --> 02:02:36,534
Where's your telepath friend?

1566
02:02:37,697 --> 02:02:38,575
Gone!

1567
02:02:39,979 --> 02:02:42,794
And I have a little up of void in my life,
if I'd be honest.

1568
02:02:43,275 --> 02:02:45,043
I was hoping you could
take that void and fill it.

1569
02:02:50,214 --> 02:02:51,034
Join us!

1570
02:02:58,294 --> 02:03:00,208
Erik, I believe!

1571
02:03:04,141 --> 02:03:05,035
I prefer..

1572
02:03:07,574 --> 02:03:08,447
Magneto!
