00:00:38,004 --> 00:00:40,404
General Motors, General Electric,

2
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:41,872
lon Physics Corporation,

3
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:44,569
Bell Telephone Laboratories,
Cosmic Inc.,

4
00:00:44,677 --> 00:00:46,804

Radio Corporation of America,

semi-conductors and materials division.

10
00:00:57,457 --> 00:00:59,254
Sounds like a hell of a stock portfolio.

11
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,883
It's everyone who's building a rocket.

12
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:03,656
Do you know, if we stay in Beverly Hills,

13
00:01:03,763 --> 00:01:05,321
even though the convention's
in Santa Monica,

14
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:06,660
we'll be halfway to Pasadena.

15
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:08,358
Pasadena?

16
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:09,935
Isn't it just people with T. B?

17
00:01:10,036 --> 00:01:13,437
Jet Propulsion Laboratories
and Ray Bradbury.

18
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:14,905
As much as I'd like to indulge

19
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:17,670
your Twilight Zone fantasy
of being shot into space...

20
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:20,769
Believe me, it's our fantasy, too.

21
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,313
This is a business trip.

22
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:24,007
I don't want either of you coming back tan.

23
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:25,482
What if I have to play golf?

24
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,314
As long as you lose.

25
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,218
Crab Colson guarantees there will be
some astronauts there.

26
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:33,156
Really? My nephews
would love an autograph.

27
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:37,025
Astronauts love golf.
I'll see what I can do.

28
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,155
You're there to sell,
but you're also there to listen.

29
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:41,665
Every scientist, engineer,
and general is trying

30
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,565
to figure out a way
to put a man on the moon

31
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:46,969
or blow up Moscow,
whichever one costs more.

32
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:50,304
We have to explain to them
how we can help them spend that money.

33
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:52,901
Well, it certainly would
behoove us to find out...

34
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:55,537
Campbell, you do the talking.
Kinsey, you do the listening.

35
00:01:57,517 --> 00:01:59,883
Don, you wanted me to remind them
about the congressmen.

36
00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:02,511
We know.
They control the purse strings.

37
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:05,750
No. They are the customer.

38
00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:10,259
They want aerospace in their districts.

39
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:14,595
Let them know that we can help them
bring these contracts home.

40
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,366
Did you read anything that she prepared?

41
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,143
Maybe I should send her.

42
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:39,248
You know I'll stay out of your way.

43
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:40,758
Of course.

44
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,522
Lounging at the pool.

45
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,962
They'll think you're
a young Barbara Stanwyck.

46
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:48,397
Doesn't that sound like fun?

47
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:52,801
If you're there, it will make me look
less serious in the office.

48
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:54,806
Next time.

49
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:56,842
It's a week, Tweety.

50
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:59,104
I suppose I can go to
my parents' place in Rehoboth.

51
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:01,874
Now you're making me feel bad.

52
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:03,380
Is that the only alternative?

53
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:05,883
They keep asking to spend time with me.

54
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:07,714
Well, us.

55
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:11,186
They're concerned.

56
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,156
About what?

57
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,021
Nothing's happening.

58
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:20,489
Why do you insist on making me
angry before I go to bed?

59
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,899
There are some very reputable agencies.

60
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:25,436
We can't even talk about this?

61
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,096
Do I have to put my foot down?

62
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,834
What's wrong with it?

63
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:31,001
It's someone else's child.

64
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:37,907
Once you see a beautiful little baby,
you'll fall in love.

65
00:03:38,017 --> 00:03:39,006
You know you will.

66
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:40,608
It's not natural.

67
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,381
I felt that way.

68
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:44,581
But it changed.

69
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:48,383
We would have our pick.

70
00:03:48,494 --> 00:03:50,121
We are ideal candidates.

71
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,391
We have means,
and we've been to doctors,

72
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:55,661
so it's on the record that it's something
we've been wanting for a long time.

73
00:04:02,508 --> 00:04:05,136
Do your parents just think
I say no to everything?

74
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,474
We're not related by blood,
and you love me.

75
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:23,893
Hello.

76
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:25,624
It's me.

77
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,664
What time is it?

78
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,599
It's 10:00. Are you sleeping?

79
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:32,500
No.

80
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:35,073
William called.

81
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:36,766
My father had a stroke.

82
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:41,213
Jesus.

83
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:43,714
Three days ago.

84
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:46,649
Gloria didn't even call me.
She had William call.

85
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:47,845
Is it bad?

86
00:04:49,155 --> 00:04:52,181
She said he's up and around, talking,

87
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,055
but she wouldn't put him on the phone.

88
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:56,528
I'm coming to get you.

89
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,028
No.

90
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,257
Bets, it's not up for discussion.

91
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:00,627
Take the kids to Francine.

92
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:03,429
I don't want to wake them.

93
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:05,333
Fine.

94
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:06,803
I'll be by in the morning.

95
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:08,703
God.

96
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:12,005
You know, I've been
dreaming about a suitcase?

97
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:14,579
Everything's gonna be okay.

98
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:17,910
Sure.

99
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:19,314
Everything's perfect.

100
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:22,618
I'll be by at 8.

101
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:25,948
Bye-bye.

102
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:33,325
Hello, Betty.

103
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:34,991
Hello, Gloria.

104
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:36,090
Hello, Don.

105
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,931
Look at the two of you.

106
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:45,401
I swear to you,
the doctors say it's not serious.

107
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:48,708
We can get a room down the road
at the William Penn.

108
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:51,283
Nonsense.

109
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:53,284
Where is he? Can I see him?

110
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:54,853
He's getting dressed.

111
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:57,616
They said he should do things on his own.

112
00:05:57,724 --> 00:05:58,782
Come sit.

113
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,656
Don't do that.

114
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:06,755
We're supposed to keep it dim.

115
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,424
I don't know why.

116
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,670
Let me check on him.

117
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:15,399
William. I wasn't expecting you.

118
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:17,601
- Good morning.
- Look who's here.

119
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,481
He doesn't seem that bad.

120
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,608
Don, good to see you.

121
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:27,117
Sorry about your dad.

122
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,687
We'll get by, right?

123
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:29,948
Judy's coming later.

124
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,353
She's dropping the girls off at her mother's.

125
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:35,154
Gloria, everything is copasetic.

126
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:36,489
It'll be nice to see her.

127
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:45,161
It's an angel.

128
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:46,898
Hi, Daddy.

129
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:49,804
That's what I needed.

130
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:50,876
Hello, Don.

131
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:53,836
Get that look off your face.

132
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:55,436
Good to see you, Gene.

133
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:58,278
I'll take a visit from you two
any way I can get it.

134
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:01,681
Where are the munchkins?

135
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:03,983
With a neighbor.

136
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,150
Pop, did you see Don's car?

137
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,852
You finally step up to a Lincoln?

138
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:10,394
Coupe De Ville.

139
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:12,726
Ice-blue, white top.

140
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:14,823
Very nice.

141
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,697
How you feeling, Daddy?

142
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:19,499
It's a tempest in a teapot.

143
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,402
You should've seen her in the ambulance.

144
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:26,843
Well, we were halfway to the hospital
before I noticed I was in my nightie.

145
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:29,540
A woman my age should not travel that way.

146
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:31,674
I wish you'd called earlier.

147
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:34,412
The other partners at Don's firm
know all kinds of doctors.

148
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,683
In New York, right,
where everything's better.

149
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:43,289
Always with her brow in a knit,
my Ruthie here.

150
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:46,627
Ruthie, my love, have you offered
everybody coffee?

151
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:50,192
I'm Betty.

152
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,635
Of course you are.

153
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:54,467
Gene, this is Betty, your daughter.

154
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:57,236
It's not Ruth. Ruth is dead.

155
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:01,747
Nobody wants coffee, Daddy.

156
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:09,547
Don, you were able to get off work?

157
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,316
I'm here.

158
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:14,791
- You want a drink?
- I'll get some ice.

159
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:19,224
What did the doctors say?

160
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,664
It's just like last time.

161
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:23,428
What?

162
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:25,663
Last time? This happened before?

163
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:29,832
Don't get mad at her.
It's a couple little strokes.

164
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:31,273
Runs in the family.

165
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:32,901
You know Gene.

166
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,378
Always has to be the one
taking care of things.

167
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:41,776
So, Don, how did you come?

168
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:43,515
Did you take the Turnpike?

169
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:46,585
Yes.

170
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:00,972
Look at this. It's my lunch date.

171
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:05,610
Hello, baby. You're early.

172
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,838
You remember Ken and Pete?

173
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:09,812
Hello, Sheila.

174
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:12,851
Want to get in a few more meals
before you lose him to the Golden West?

175
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:15,113
What are you talking about?

176
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,552
We're going to Los Angeles together.

177
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:18,521
It's horrible, but somebody has to go.

178
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:21,024
Where?

179
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:22,185
Californ-l-A.

180
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:24,092
Thank you, Pete.

181
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:25,993
Come on, Campbell.

182
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:28,259
Time to put something else in that mouth.

183
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:29,356
Nice to see you.

184
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:33,634
I was going to tell you at lunch.

185
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:36,674
Why are you going to Los Angeles?

186
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:38,573
Come on. Not here.

187
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,918
It just came up.

188
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:47,485
The election's not for months.

189
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,815
We can register voters in October.

190
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,445
It has nothing to do with the election.

191
00:09:50,556 --> 00:09:51,523
You know that.

192
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:53,353
If you don't mind,

193
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:56,860
I'd rather face Mississippi
and those people screaming at me

194
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:59,830
and maybe getting shot
after I go to California.

195
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,365
Are you scared?

196
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:04,027
Don't pretend like it's not scary.

197
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:07,204
Look, I have to go.

198
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:09,001
Why? What is so important?

199
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:11,702
It's a convention.

200
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:13,836
I'm not allowed to talk about it.

201
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:24,279
Hello, Mr. Kinsey.

202
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,415
Please, Hollis. It's Paul.

203
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:28,584
This is Sheila, my girlfriend.

204
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:29,991
Nice to meet you.

205
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:39,499
Did you ever really plan
on going down South?

206
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:42,005
How could you ask that?

207
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:43,939
This just came up.

208
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:50,110
You can always get another
job at a grocery store.

209
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:53,447
I can't just walk into an ad agency.

210
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:55,782
I can't believe you.

211
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:59,483
All you do is complain about
that place and those people.

212
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:00,752
That's not true.

213
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,157
Well, I'm going.

214
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:05,856
I guess I'll just hop in Billy Kaplan's bus
with ten strangers.

215
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:08,160
Why can't it wait?

216
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,164
19th Street.

217
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:17,433
This was all supposed to be ours.

218
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:19,807
I keep thinking what would have
happened if Dad had lived.

219
00:11:19,912 --> 00:11:22,437
He'd be on his knees to us.

220
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,916
What about all that money
Dad gave to Lincoln Center?

221
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,349
Get that back.

222
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:29,819
You can't take a donation back.

223
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:32,954
Listen, I'm as upset as you are.

224
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:35,289
We're about to finally buy in Millbrook.

225
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:38,124
How long can she afford to live?

226
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:41,256
By golly, Pete, maybe we can
get rid of her tonight.

227
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,392
Remember Rope?

228
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:48,398
Well, look, all we have to do

229
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:50,532
is go over there, get her signature,

230
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:53,305
mourn over the loss
of our birthright, and move on.

231
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:55,380
I hate going there.

232
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:56,778
The smell.

233
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:59,180
To the end of the line.

234
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:07,015
Does Judy want kids?

235
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:08,991
We have a five-year plan.

236
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:10,619
Although secretly I think Judy hopes

237
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,857
we're that childless couple
people invite over.

238
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,527
Trudy?

239
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,901
We've tried.

240
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:21,829
That must be disappointing.

241
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:27,541
Adoption.

242
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,571
People do that.

243
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:33,310
They do.

244
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,684
So, the Yankees are having a hell of a year.

245
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:42,818
Do you take Bobby?

246
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:44,225
All the time.

247
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:47,128
We really thought you were going
to make it to Cape May.

248
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:50,396
Although without Betty there,
everyone had a turn at winning.

249
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:52,733
Elizabeth's got a mind for cards.

250
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:07,241
Where were you?

251
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:10,880
I was hiding in the tree house.

252
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,787
It's like a tomb in there.

253
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:14,587
I don't know how Don's standing it.

254
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:17,753
Is this the last picture of her in the house?

255
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:19,125
I don't know.

256
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,097
And where's the ottoman with the birds?

257
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:24,897
I don't know, Betty.

258
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:26,596
I mean, can you blame her?

259
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:28,536
I wouldn't want to live with Mom's ghost.

260
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,337
She's a silly woman.

261
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:33,070
All that talk about her underthings.

262
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:37,414
Daddy used to fine us
for small talk, remember?

263
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:40,451
Conversation is an art.

264
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:42,885
Well, it is.

265
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:49,256
How long has he been like this?

266
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:53,225
He was acting queer
on the golf course last month.

267
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,596
Let one of the colored caddies
really have it.

268
00:13:57,469 --> 00:13:59,096
Look, Gloria's helping us.

269
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:00,763
Okay? I don't want to get stuck with him

270
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:03,000
just because I cared enough
not to move away.

271
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:05,668
Don works in Manhattan.

272
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:08,474
You know I wish I could be here.

273
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:09,775
You only have two kids.

274
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:11,713
Lord knows Don could afford
to build him a house

275
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:13,375
in his backyard if he wanted to.

276
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:15,749
Stop counting other people's money.

277
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:20,553
And the jardinière.

278
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:22,456
The what?

279
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:24,153
It used to be right there.

280
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:26,288
The ceramic thing?

281
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:31,292
I think we have that.

282
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:34,770
Do I have to go around and write my name
on all the things that I want?

283
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,308
Bets, you're drunk.

284
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:40,173
Well, I hope everybody's hungry.

285
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:42,304
We're minutes away.

286
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:44,314
Why is that window open?

287
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:54,258
Well, look at that. You found a corner.

288
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,385
You're pulling your end.

289
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:59,020
Can't say the same about him.

290
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:00,496
Don's helping.

291
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:03,830
Who know what he does, why he does it?

292
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:06,803
I know more about the kid
who fixes my damn car.

293
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,397
Dad, you're hurting Don's feelings.

294
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:11,868
It's okay.

295
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:15,646
Nobody has what you have.

296
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,978
You act like it's nothing.

297
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,051
My daughter's a princess.
You know that?

298
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:23,053
Dinnertime.

299
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:27,719
What's going on?

300
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:30,124
He has no people!

301
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:31,924
You can't trust a person like that!

302
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:33,191
Daddy.

303
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:41,737
Fine. Let's go eat.

304
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:55,050
Come on.

305
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:57,418
I have no appetite.

306
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:58,990
Birdie, you should eat.

307
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:00,524
Stop it, Don.

308
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,355
Nobody's watching.

309
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:16,201
And here, Mother.

310
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,299
How many of these are there?

311
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:20,776
Hello, all.

312
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:23,370
I brought my pen.
Hope I didn't miss anything.

313
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:26,144
Other than dinner, no.

314
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:27,741
Hello, Mother.

315
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:34,489
I think it's nice that even though
you let Bud do all the work,

316
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:36,959
you found time to grace us
with your signature.

317
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:39,656
Yes, well, anything I can do.

318
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,427
I just hope you don't get too used to this.

319
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:45,127
To what?

320
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:47,467
This family.

321
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:49,700
It has come to my attention
that you and Trudy

322
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:51,969
are considering a child that's not your own.

323
00:16:52,077 --> 00:16:53,669
Is this true?

324
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:57,111
It just came up.

325
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:59,047
How is that possible?

326
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:02,746
Peter, I would hate
to have to exclude you

327
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,823
from what is rightfully yours.

328
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:06,390
You have to keep at it.

329
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:09,656
You know what, Mother?

330
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:12,287
This is not a topic of conversation.

331
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:15,492
I think you know how your father felt
about the whole idea.

332
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:18,932
It's suitable for some.

333
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,632
But really, you're pulling from the discards.

334
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:24,374
My father?

335
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:26,307
- Yes.
- Pete.

336
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:31,207
Your husband spent everything you had.

337
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,914
Spent it with strangers.

338
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:37,454
All of it.

339
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,581
What are you talking about?

340
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:42,182
I'll messenger these
to your office tomorrow.

341
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:44,387
That's a swell idea.

342
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:47,192
The tone of your voice... I don't like it.

343
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:49,731
That, too?

344
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:52,326
Stop being dramatic.

345
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:56,465
Bud, what is my fiduciary state?

346
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,566
Tell her.

347
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,705
Well...

348
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:07,081
We had to liquidate your holdings
to ensure your future comfort.

349
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:08,483
Why?

350
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,077
Who asked you to do that?

351
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:12,749
The market took a turn for the worse.

352
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,449
Real estate?

353
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:17,188
I think I would have heard about that.

354
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:22,359
Yes, well, don't forget
to send those by my office.

355
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:40,879
Do you want me to
lay everything out for you?

356
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:43,580
It's been a day.
I just want to go to sleep.

357
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:18,508
You're smoking like a chimney.

358
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,202
It gives you wrinkles, you know.

359
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:24,679
Good morning, everyone.

360
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:25,909
Gene.

361
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:27,542
Morning, Don.

362
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:32,083
I have some batter left.
Would you like some waffles?

363
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,420
No. This will be fine.

364
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:36,790
And coffee.

365
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:38,658
- Morning, everybody.
- Do you want breakfast?

366
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:39,696
No.

367
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:42,699
I had no idea.

368
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:45,167
Please, Judy, it's okay.

369
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,965
No, it's yours. I feel terrible.

370
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:50,166
I didn't know your mother promised it to you.

371
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:51,401
Really, Judy, it's okay.

372
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,068
I wish he hadn't brought it up with you.

373
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:54,372
I'm putting it over here.

374
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:58,748
Isn't Viola coming today?

375
00:21:58,850 --> 00:21:59,942
Later.

376
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:02,816
There's no chance she'll miss you.

377
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:04,912
- Leave the dishes.
- Nonsense.

378
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:07,321
You look beautiful.

379
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:08,393
Thank you.

380
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:11,155
Now that you've fed me,
why don't we go upstairs?

381
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:12,890
Gene!

382
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,523
I'm fine.

383
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:17,966
I don't know what to say.
He's so mixed up.

384
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,094
Gene, you are mixed up.

385
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:20,603
You're mixed up.

386
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,442
He's tired. He didn't sleep last night.

387
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:27,205
Of course.

388
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,115
Dad, you have to go back to the doctor.

389
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:36,278
I already have an appointment for Monday.

390
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:46,654
So... Daddy, what would you
like to do today?

391
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:48,255
Finish that puzzle?

392
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,494
Sure.

393
00:22:50,602 --> 00:22:52,900
And maybe drive into town.

394
00:22:53,004 --> 00:22:54,733
Get you a milkshake.

395
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,070
That's a grand idea.

396
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,359
Come in.

397
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:19,058
Finally.

398
00:23:19,164 --> 00:23:21,632
I told her to call you.

399
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,360
You should have called me.

400
00:23:23,468 --> 00:23:24,492
Hello, Viola.

401
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:30,066
And you two look good, considering.

402
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:31,301
How are the children?

403
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,536
They're good.

404
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:36,242
I'm gonna make some calls.

405
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:41,518
You should be here every day.

406
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,383
That's not up to me.

407
00:23:43,488 --> 00:23:47,117
Why not?
You've been here longer than her.

408
00:23:47,225 --> 00:23:48,783
He needs you.

409
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:50,361
I don't know about that.

410
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:54,057
And you let Gloria and Judy
ransack the house.

411
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:56,498
You want to give me your temper?

412
00:24:06,411 --> 00:24:08,936
He doesn't know who I am.

413
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:11,277
He's very, very sick.

414
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:18,781
You don't know how nice it is
to hear someone say that.

415
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:31,166
Is he dying?

416
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:35,672
I was at Elkins Park Hospital on Sunday
when they talked to her.

417
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:39,438
It's just gonna get worse.

418
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:44,782
I don't know how much more I can take.

419
00:24:44,883 --> 00:24:48,080
Well, this day comes eventually,
like it or not.

420
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:53,514
I'm an orphan.

421
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:58,094
You are supposed
to take care of your husband

422
00:24:58,196 --> 00:25:00,790
and your beautiful children now.

423
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:03,129
They are yours.

424
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:06,295
You'll see.

425
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:09,802
The minute you leave,
you'll remember him

426
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:12,502
exactly the way he used to be.

427
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:17,472
It's all good outside that door.

428
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:27,951
Want these upstairs?

429
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:31,085
No. I have to put it all in the wash.

430
00:25:32,664 --> 00:25:33,756
I'll go get the kids.

431
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:36,231
Francine promised them
the pool tomorrow.

432
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:38,325
Carla will bring them home later.

433
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:42,638
I'm gonna take a shower.

434
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:43,799
Don.

435
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:46,571
What?

436
00:25:46,678 --> 00:25:49,340
I think you should leave.

437
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,240
Really?

438
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,874
Yes.

439
00:25:56,087 --> 00:25:58,715
Bets, you're upset.

440
00:25:58,823 --> 00:26:00,586
I am.

441
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:03,126
And I know how you feel about grieving.

442
00:26:05,263 --> 00:26:07,458
I think I should be here for you.

443
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:10,626
That's your reason.

444
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:13,727
What do you want me to say?

445
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:18,265
I want to be here.

446
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:20,970
You need me here.

447
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:23,104
Why?

448
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:25,341
Nothing's changed.

449
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:27,884
We were just pretending.

450
00:26:51,142 --> 00:26:52,837
Good afternoon, Mr. Draper.

451
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,536
Hello, Donna.

452
00:26:54,646 --> 00:26:55,635
Allison.

453
00:26:55,747 --> 00:26:57,806
Of course.

454
00:27:22,874 --> 00:27:25,434
Surprise!

455
00:27:37,188 --> 00:27:39,281
And this beautiful layette.

456
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:42,053
We've also attempted
to fortify your castle.

457
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,720
Lucky Strike, Martinson Coffee,

458
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:48,230
Pampers, and some Clearasil,
for when it gets bigger.

459
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,563
You raided the storeroom for me.

460
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:53,502
Now, Daddy-o, we've given
this a lot of thought.

461
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:57,166
You are going to be blessed
with a stinking miracle.

462
00:27:57,275 --> 00:27:58,503
Stop it!

463
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:01,977
So, in assessing the damage
to your private life,

464
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,378
we've gotten you some reading material.

465
00:28:04,482 --> 00:28:06,814
What do you get for the man
who's about to have nothing?

466
00:28:06,918 --> 00:28:09,352
- No, no, no, no.
- Speech, speech.

467
00:28:12,657 --> 00:28:14,181
I'm very touched by this party.

468
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:15,259
That's the whole point.

469
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,759
You're not going to be touched.

470
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:20,463
I got it, Paul. Knock it off.

471
00:28:20,565 --> 00:28:23,625
I want to toast all of you.

472
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:27,102
And let's hope when this baby comes
that he likes Luckys.

473
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:30,106
Here's to the little one,
whatever it may be.

474
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:32,335
- Cheers.
- Salut.

475
00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:38,512
I just wanted to say Happy Birthday.

476
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,353
What's this?

477
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:49,324
Tiffany's?

478
00:28:49,427 --> 00:28:51,520
Who's it from?

479
00:28:51,629 --> 00:28:52,891
From Jane.

480
00:28:52,997 --> 00:28:55,022
And Roger, I'm sure.

481
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:59,835
Will you cut the cake, dear?

482
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:04,166
Mr. Draper.

483
00:29:04,275 --> 00:29:05,503
I wasn't expecting you till tomorrow.

484
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:06,599
How is everything?

485
00:29:06,711 --> 00:29:09,509
About how those things are.

486
00:29:09,614 --> 00:29:12,447
Joan, if you don't mind,
can I borrow you for a moment?

487
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:14,074
- Of course.
- Thank you.

488
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:24,519
Thank you.

489
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:28,933
And you have your meeting
with Mr. Odino at 10 tomorrow.

490
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:32,332
And then Lee Garner, Jr.
And the TV department at 3.

491
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:33,734
Cancel everything.

492
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:35,635
Yes, of course.

493
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:36,968
Reschedule for Friday?

494
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:39,805
No. Clear the week.

495
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:44,575
So. How was your family emergency?

496
00:29:44,682 --> 00:29:46,843
Memorable. Thank you.

497
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:49,112
I assume that means everything's okay?

498
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:53,622
I'm leaving for California tomorrow
for the Rocket Fair.

499
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:55,488
Good for you.

500
00:29:55,593 --> 00:29:57,618
Sunshine, bikinis.

501
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:01,994
But didn't we already send a couple men?

502
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,159
Campbell and Kinsey?

503
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:05,793
Not yet.

504
00:30:07,705 --> 00:30:10,469
Well, Campbell has got to go.

505
00:30:10,575 --> 00:30:12,770
I've held his hand through 30 phone calls.

506
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:16,639
Very good, Don.
Bring me a bag of oranges.

507
00:30:16,748 --> 00:30:19,774
I'm sure Joan here can hold down the fort.

508
00:30:19,884 --> 00:30:21,784
She's been doing it so far.

509
00:30:21,886 --> 00:30:25,083
Told you you'd be in good hands
with Miss Holloway.

510
00:30:32,463 --> 00:30:37,093
I'll need you to send a memo to Mr. Kinsey
explaining this change in plans.

511
00:30:37,202 --> 00:30:40,171
I'll take care of it.

512
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:42,762
You look like you didn't
get any sleep last night.

513
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:45,742
I did.

514
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,505
Go ahead. Lay down.

515
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:49,512
I'll keep the drunks away.

516
00:30:56,554 --> 00:30:58,488
I heard it's very hard
to get anything done there

517
00:30:58,590 --> 00:30:59,818
because of the weather, you know?

518
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:00,891
People don't work.

519
00:31:00,992 --> 00:31:02,425
Sounds good to me.

520
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:05,121
I'm sure I'll be going sometime
in the next few months.

521
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:06,288
All the networks keep saying

522
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:08,865
how I need to come out
and shave my face.

523
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:11,060
I mean show.

524
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:12,761
What's in this?

525
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:15,806
You're just gonna fly off
and leave your wife and newborn?

526
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:25,077
I just want to say
that I am so happy for you

527
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:28,084
and that you're gonna be the best father

528
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:30,347
and that I'm really happy for you.

529
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:32,355
Thank you.

530
00:31:43,635 --> 00:31:45,330
- Mr. Kinsey?
- Yes, Joan.

531
00:31:45,436 --> 00:31:48,462
Mr. Draper wanted you to be informed
that he will be going to Los Angeles

532
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:49,801
for the convention.

533
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:52,240
Great. We won't have to fly tourist.

534
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:55,039
No. It's just he and Mr. Campbell going.

535
00:31:55,146 --> 00:31:56,613
What?

536
00:31:56,714 --> 00:31:58,204
Don's going with Pete?

537
00:31:58,316 --> 00:32:00,682
He can't do that.

538
00:32:01,953 --> 00:32:03,921
I'm sure it must be disappointing.

539
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:05,387
I'll need your tickets and your badges.

540
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:08,323
That's not right. Why can't we all go?

541
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:10,519
I really need everything right away.

542
00:32:10,628 --> 00:32:12,255
Or are they at home?

543
00:32:19,737 --> 00:32:21,398
Is there any cake left?

544
00:32:21,506 --> 00:32:23,997
Hey, Sheila. It's me.

545
00:32:25,576 --> 00:32:27,100
No, I know that.

546
00:32:27,211 --> 00:32:29,702
And I want you to know
I've thought about it...

547
00:32:29,814 --> 00:32:31,873
Let me finish.

548
00:32:31,983 --> 00:32:34,679
I'm going to stand there
arm-in-arm with you

549
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,481
and make a stand.

550
00:32:38,823 --> 00:32:40,518
It's not just about you and me.

551
00:32:42,927 --> 00:32:44,155
I know that.

552
00:32:46,998 --> 00:32:49,933
No one's been shot lately. Okay?

553
00:32:52,403 --> 00:32:54,268
I love you, too, baby.

554
00:33:06,617 --> 00:33:07,584
Peggy.

555
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,651
May I speak with you?

556
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:17,658
Heck of a party.

557
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:19,855
Yes.

558
00:33:19,964 --> 00:33:21,591
I'm going away, you know.

559
00:33:21,699 --> 00:33:23,326
Of course.

560
00:33:23,434 --> 00:33:25,959
On a plane.

561
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,298
What do you want me to say?

562
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:28,770
That I wish I was going?

563
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:30,966
Everybody does.

564
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:33,066
I've never even been on a plane.

565
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:35,702
Well, I have.

566
00:33:35,813 --> 00:33:37,678
But not since my father died.

567
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:43,050
I'm sorry.

568
00:33:43,154 --> 00:33:45,145
I'm not scared.

569
00:33:45,256 --> 00:33:47,121
It just seems significant, is all.

570
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:49,090
Statistically speaking,

571
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:50,956
it's very unlikely that it will happen

572
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:53,394
to two people in one family.

573
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:57,024
That's true.

574
00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:00,200
Besides, it wouldn't be the worst thing.

575
00:34:00,304 --> 00:34:02,135
Excuse me?

576
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,765
I hate my mother.

577
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:06,537
What do you think of that?

578
00:34:08,112 --> 00:34:09,636
Come on, you must have an opinion.

579
00:34:09,747 --> 00:34:12,341
I don't know the circumstances.

580
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:14,850
I don't know what I should expect from her.

581
00:34:14,952 --> 00:34:15,884
I don't know her.

582
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:17,784
Like Bud and I turned out so great.

583
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:22,516
Who's to say it wouldn't be better?

584
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:24,652
So it's not yours. That could be good.

585
00:34:24,762 --> 00:34:28,095
I don't know what you're talking about.

586
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:30,667
But I think your flight will be fine.

587
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:34,331
You should go home.

588
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:39,073
Everything's so easy for you.

589
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:42,708
It's not easy for anyone, Pete.

590
00:34:48,052 --> 00:34:50,020
Have a great trip.

591
00:35:40,238 --> 00:35:42,297
What's there?

592
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:50,705
Glen?

593
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:54,275
What are you doing?

594
00:35:54,385 --> 00:35:57,183
Nothing.

595
00:35:57,288 --> 00:36:00,724
How long have you been out here?

596
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:02,793
I don't know.

597
00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:04,486
A few days.

598
00:36:08,065 --> 00:36:09,828
What happened?

599
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:16,565
I didn't know if I was
going to see you again.

600
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:19,142
And then you weren't even home.

601
00:36:21,245 --> 00:36:22,735
Did you run away?

602
00:36:24,815 --> 00:36:27,010
So?

603
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:40,155
I think you should tell me what happened.

604
00:36:40,264 --> 00:36:43,392
My dad wants Charlotte
and me to live with him.

605
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:44,593
My mom doesn't care.

606
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:46,932
I'm sure that's not true.

607
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:50,371
She just wants to be with her boyfriends.

608
00:36:50,474 --> 00:36:53,466
Does she have a lot of boyfriends?

609
00:36:53,578 --> 00:36:55,876
I guess.

610
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,971
They give me things.

611
00:37:00,184 --> 00:37:04,120
I haven't seen you in so long,
except driving down the street.

612
00:37:05,656 --> 00:37:08,784
I know. I know.

613
00:37:10,861 --> 00:37:12,385
Can I use the bathroom?

614
00:37:13,864 --> 00:37:15,661
Do you want me to wash your clothes?

615
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:41,354
Is that shirt okay?

616
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:43,450
That almost fits you.

617
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:55,436
Go ahead.

618
00:38:01,646 --> 00:38:04,513
Why are you alone here?

619
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:07,015
It's the middle of the day.

620
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:09,382
It's lousy.

621
00:38:12,156 --> 00:38:14,920
You understand why your mother
was mad at me, I hope.

622
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:17,153
Yeah.

623
00:38:17,261 --> 00:38:19,559
Because she doesn't understand.

624
00:38:21,866 --> 00:38:23,925
That's true.

625
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:30,232
I'm not going home.

626
00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:32,400
Because I know I'm a problem for them.

627
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:34,000
Glen.

628
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:36,841
I know I am because
they keep saying I'm not.

629
00:38:36,947 --> 00:38:39,040
Did you do something?

630
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,515
No.

631
00:38:40,618 --> 00:38:43,587
But my mom is never home.

632
00:38:43,688 --> 00:38:45,918
My dad has another baby.

633
00:38:46,023 --> 00:38:47,786
His wife is pretty mean.

634
00:38:49,293 --> 00:38:51,124
Where's your mother?

635
00:38:51,228 --> 00:38:53,628
I don't know.

636
00:38:53,731 --> 00:38:55,665
Writing pamphlets and handing them out.

637
00:38:57,868 --> 00:38:59,802
I'm pretty responsible.

638
00:38:59,904 --> 00:39:02,668
I brush my sister's teeth
and put us both to bed.

639
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:05,435
That's very sweet of you.

640
00:39:10,448 --> 00:39:12,143
Aren't you going to eat?

641
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:39,365
Can I tell you something?

642
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:41,445
Of course.

643
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:43,012
I don't like ham.

644
00:39:43,114 --> 00:39:46,379
I don't like meat at all, actually.

645
00:39:48,853 --> 00:39:50,081
I'm sorry.

646
00:39:50,187 --> 00:39:53,350
Do you want me to make you
some macaroni and cheese?

647
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:21,981
I came to rescue you.

648
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:25,683
Did you bring your cape?

649
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:28,418
I'm not joking.

650
00:40:28,526 --> 00:40:30,721
We can go anywhere. I have money.

651
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:36,399
Glen...

652
00:40:44,508 --> 00:40:47,443
- Mommy! I missed you!
- Mommy!

653
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:50,378
I missed you, too.

654
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:52,312
How is he?

655
00:40:52,416 --> 00:40:54,145
- Who?
- Your father.

656
00:40:54,251 --> 00:40:56,811
He's not good.

657
00:40:56,921 --> 00:40:58,718
Carla, this is Glen Bishop.

658
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:02,649
Sally, Bobby, you remember
Glen from down the street.

659
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,159
Hi, Glen.

660
00:41:04,261 --> 00:41:05,228
Hi.

661
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:09,060
Why don't you take Glen upstairs
and show him the trains Daddy got you?

662
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:11,293
You can use the controls.

663
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:15,230
Go ahead. It's okay.

664
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,909
What's he doing here?

665
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:36,157
You're really bad.

666
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,818
You think you can do any better?

667
00:41:37,928 --> 00:41:40,590
If I couldn't, I'd give up trying.

668
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:46,297
What don't you like
about the speed shear?

669
00:41:53,577 --> 00:41:55,238
Glen, can you come in here?

670
00:42:01,752 --> 00:42:03,879
Glen, get over here now.

671
00:42:03,988 --> 00:42:05,922
I was worried sick.

672
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:08,321
Glen, you have to go home.

673
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:22,430
You can't do things like this.

674
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,468
Let's go. Your father's on his way.

675
00:42:27,745 --> 00:42:28,973
I hate you.

676
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:30,444
Apologize right this minute.

677
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,345
No, it's true.

678
00:42:32,449 --> 00:42:34,383
I hate you.

679
00:42:36,153 --> 00:42:37,177
I know.

680
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:43,326
I'm sorry.

681
00:43:01,845 --> 00:43:03,972
Come on. Let's wash up for dinner.

682
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:10,319
Advertising, if anything,
helps bring on change.

683
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:13,652
The market... and I'm talking
in a purely Marxist sense...

684
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:16,726
dictates that we must include everyone.

685
00:43:16,827 --> 00:43:19,557
The consumer has no color.

686
00:43:33,677 --> 00:43:37,306
Betty, I'm sorry, but we really need to talk.

687
00:43:41,685 --> 00:43:43,516
There's nothing to talk about.

688
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:47,455
I don't know why he was over here,
but this has to stop.

689
00:43:53,097 --> 00:43:54,792
Nothing's going on.

690
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,325
Except that Glen feels alone.

691
00:43:59,436 --> 00:44:01,836
Honestly, I don't blame him.

692
00:44:01,939 --> 00:44:04,066
What did he say?

693
00:44:05,242 --> 00:44:06,903
Nothing.

694
00:44:07,011 --> 00:44:10,208
But it's obvious.

695
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:12,407
He depends on you for everything.

696
00:44:13,917 --> 00:44:15,942
You're supposed to be taking care of him.

697
00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:17,748
You're his mother.

698
00:44:17,855 --> 00:44:19,447
And he gets nothing.

699
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:25,621
I thought with Dan out of our lives,
it would be different.

700
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:30,694
Glen's right.

701
00:44:30,801 --> 00:44:33,201
I'm not a very good mother anymore.

702
00:44:44,448 --> 00:44:46,507
Don isn't living here.

703
00:44:51,555 --> 00:44:54,285
I'm sorry.

704
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:58,828
We haven't told the children.

705
00:44:58,929 --> 00:45:01,989
Is it over?

706
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:06,565
I don't even know.

707
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:09,696
That's the worst.

708
00:45:09,807 --> 00:45:11,502
Do they see him?

709
00:45:11,608 --> 00:45:14,304
He takes them to dinner.

710
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:20,506
They don't know what made them
so special all of the sudden.

711
00:45:20,617 --> 00:45:22,881
I don't know.

712
00:45:22,986 --> 00:45:26,888
For me, it wasn't that different
without him there.

713
00:45:31,428 --> 00:45:34,420
Sometimes I feel like I'll float away

714
00:45:34,531 --> 00:45:37,261
if Don isn't holding me down.

715
00:45:42,673 --> 00:45:48,077
The hardest part
is realizing you're in charge.

716
00:46:00,557 --> 00:46:03,924
As you can see, the pilot has turned off
the "No Smoking" sign.

717
00:46:04,027 --> 00:46:08,054
We're expecting clear skies
en route to Los Angeles today.

718
00:46:08,165 --> 00:46:09,564
It should be a pleasant day,

719
00:46:09,666 --> 00:46:13,830
82 degrees and clear,
with a light Santa Ana wind.

720
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:16,929
Trans World Airlines...
