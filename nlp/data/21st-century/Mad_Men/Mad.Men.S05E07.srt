1
00:00:10,773 --> 00:00:12,410
Previously on Mad Men...

2
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:14,166
We're going to take
LSD with them.

3
00:00:15,256 --> 00:00:16,419
You don't want to see
each other any more?

4
00:00:16,573 --> 00:00:18,654
You always want to push the
button on the whole thing.

5
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:21,308
Grandma Pauline is still here
and I hate her.

6
00:00:21,429 --> 00:00:22,551
Stay out of her way.

7
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:23,724
Are you leaving me?

8
00:00:23,841 --> 00:00:25,584
We're leaving each other,
just like you said.

9
00:00:25,676 --> 00:00:27,621
I'm not a word person
like you, people.

10
00:00:27,729 --> 00:00:29,320
Your words are always
"I don't like it".

11
00:00:29,493 --> 00:00:31,678
Don, you're gonna call back
the American Cancer Society.

12
00:00:31,972 --> 00:00:33,914
What made you
suddenly write that?

13
00:00:34,016 --> 00:00:35,504
It was an impulse.

14
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:37,222
I'll be able to drive
in a few years.

15
00:00:37,488 --> 00:00:38,613
I can come and visit.

17
00:01:27,982 --> 00:01:29,816
Hello.

18
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:32,353
Hey, it's your dad.

19
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:38,126
- Yeah?
- Hi, it's me.

20
00:01:38,161 --> 00:01:40,564
Weeknight, nice.

21
00:01:40,598 --> 00:01:43,431
Is Mrs. Francis
out with the mayor?

22
00:01:43,465 --> 00:01:45,700
They went to Michigan
and they took baby gene

23
00:01:45,734 --> 00:01:47,469
and left me here with Bluto.

24
00:01:47,504 --> 00:01:49,271
She still smell like a toilet?

25
00:01:49,306 --> 00:01:50,773
Yeah.

26
00:01:50,808 --> 00:01:53,009
<i>How's it going?</i>

27
00:01:53,043 --> 00:01:54,845
I'm supposed to be
studying for trig,

28
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:57,146
but, uh, I'm not in the mood.

29
00:01:57,181 --> 00:01:59,282
Oh, come on.
Her again?

30
00:01:59,317 --> 00:02:01,919
You'll see when you break up.
It hurts.

31
00:02:01,953 --> 00:02:04,689
- Not for the girl.
- Shut up.

32
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:07,759
Aren't you going back to
the same camp next summer?

33
00:02:07,793 --> 00:02:09,793
Did you go get
the spoonful album?

34
00:02:09,828 --> 00:02:11,795
<i>Hey, bishop, who
you talking to?</i>

35
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:14,766
Your sister.
Just figuring out when we can ball.

36
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,868
It's on the radio all the time.

37
00:02:16,902 --> 00:02:20,305
Sally, get your brother
and set the table.

38
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,007
Did you hear that?

39
00:02:22,042 --> 00:02:24,475
- We're like her slaves.
- <i>Sally!</i>

40
00:02:24,509 --> 00:02:27,012
Yeah, well, at least you don't
have to change gene's diapers.

41
00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:28,247
No.

42
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:30,149
Fine, I'll eat by myself.

43
00:02:30,184 --> 00:02:32,918
Oh! Ah!

44
00:02:35,089 --> 00:02:37,823
- What happened?
- Oh, lord.

45
00:02:37,858 --> 00:02:39,959
- What happened?
- Can you move?

46
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,995
- Are you okay?
- Oh, my ankle!

47
00:02:43,765 --> 00:02:46,533
Okay, go get her some water.
I'm gonna call for help.

48
00:02:48,202 --> 00:02:50,138
Bobby, go.

49
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:55,375
Why do you insist on carrying
everything yourself?

50
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:57,311
- The doorman offered.
- Why bother him?

51
00:02:57,345 --> 00:03:00,149
- It's not that much.
- No, it is absurd.

52
00:03:00,183 --> 00:03:03,619
- I see you brought work with you.
- It is my book.

53
00:03:03,654 --> 00:03:06,286
I make an excuse of New York
to try and publish again.

54
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,688
Megan's excited about it.

55
00:03:07,722 --> 00:03:09,556
My daughter pretends
to find interesting

56
00:03:09,591 --> 00:03:11,426
what I find interesting
because she loves me.

57
00:03:18,303 --> 00:03:20,835
Why are you carrying the bags?
Is Jonesy drunk again?

58
00:03:27,644 --> 00:03:30,414
- So...
- Please speak English.

59
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:33,917
You like it?

60
00:03:33,951 --> 00:03:37,287
I don't know.
It's exquisitely decadent.

61
00:03:37,321 --> 00:03:39,722
- Well, it kind of came this way.
- No, it didn't.

62
00:03:39,756 --> 00:03:41,391
Emile is confused.

63
00:03:41,426 --> 00:03:44,196
His eyes and his politics
are having a fight.

64
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,464
Well, daddy, I want
you to sit down.

65
00:03:46,498 --> 00:03:49,233
I'll fix you a drink.

66
00:03:49,267 --> 00:03:50,969
I have a beautiful Dover Sole.

67
00:03:51,003 --> 00:03:52,602
And I want you
to be on vacation.

68
00:03:52,637 --> 00:03:54,873
<i>Formidable.</i>

69
00:04:00,047 --> 00:04:01,745
<i>Merci.</i>

70
00:04:01,779 --> 00:04:03,748
Save yourself.

71
00:04:03,782 --> 00:04:05,918
Got a nice bottle
of cognac for later.

72
00:04:05,953 --> 00:04:07,919
You remembered.

73
00:04:07,954 --> 00:04:10,723
I see she's convinced you
that she's particular.

74
00:04:11,992 --> 00:04:13,727
I'm the proof she is not.

75
00:04:13,761 --> 00:04:17,029
Hello?

76
00:04:17,064 --> 00:04:19,165
Sit.
I insist.

77
00:04:20,735 --> 00:04:23,103
Now tell me all about
your adventures today.

78
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:26,073
Hold on, sweetheart.
It's Sally.

79
00:04:26,107 --> 00:04:27,843
She's okay, but you
should talk to her.

80
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:32,145
So Uncle Arnold, huh?

81
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:35,917
No one went to the funeral, but
I knew you always liked him.

82
00:04:35,951 --> 00:04:38,721
Has Margaret stopped
dancing on Jane's grave?

83
00:04:38,756 --> 00:04:42,425
Well, she
hardly hid her feelings.

84
00:04:42,459 --> 00:04:44,625
You didn't react that way.

85
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:47,228
No, but I have to admit

86
00:04:47,263 --> 00:04:49,766
I'm surprised that you're
in such a good mood.

87
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,967
It's unsatisfying, actually.

88
00:04:52,002 --> 00:04:53,737
I always thought
she'd leave you.

89
00:04:53,772 --> 00:04:55,672
I've been wondering lately
if she was just an excuse

90
00:04:55,707 --> 00:04:57,508
to blow up my life.

91
00:04:57,542 --> 00:04:59,908
Are you seeing a psychiatrist?

92
00:04:59,942 --> 00:05:02,144
No.

93
00:05:02,178 --> 00:05:05,015
But I did have a, um...

94
00:05:05,049 --> 00:05:08,219
Well, I had
a life-altering experience.

95
00:05:09,221 --> 00:05:10,889
I'll bite.

96
00:05:10,923 --> 00:05:14,056
Mona, I took LSD.

97
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:15,992
I went on a trip.

98
00:05:17,862 --> 00:05:19,363
Of course you did.

99
00:05:19,398 --> 00:05:21,633
You should really try it.
You have to.

100
00:05:21,667 --> 00:05:23,302
You'd love it, actually.

101
00:05:23,336 --> 00:05:25,571
So what's it like?

102
00:05:25,605 --> 00:05:28,239
Euphoria and insight

103
00:05:28,273 --> 00:05:30,007
and-- I don't know.

104
00:05:30,042 --> 00:05:31,643
My whole life, people
have been telling me

105
00:05:31,677 --> 00:05:33,478
I don't understand
how other people think.

106
00:05:33,512 --> 00:05:34,980
And it turns out it's true.

107
00:05:35,014 --> 00:05:37,984
Maybe I should try it.

108
00:05:39,718 --> 00:05:42,822
So, these...

109
00:05:42,856 --> 00:05:45,524
Are four members of
the American cancer society.

110
00:05:45,559 --> 00:05:48,595
They're honoring Don for kicking lucky
strike in the balls with that letter.

111
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:51,397
Incredible.

112
00:05:51,432 --> 00:05:55,033
And what am I supposed
to do with these names?

113
00:05:55,068 --> 00:05:57,704
You remember when
we were first married

114
00:05:57,738 --> 00:05:59,640
and you used to go to luncheons

115
00:05:59,675 --> 00:06:02,609
and tell me about these
powerful men that I could meet?

116
00:06:02,643 --> 00:06:04,345
And you ignored me.

117
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:07,649
When I was in the deepest
part of the trip,

118
00:06:07,682 --> 00:06:09,616
the farthest away,

119
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:13,087
I was sitting in my bathtub
and I saw myself

120
00:06:13,121 --> 00:06:16,024
at the 1919 World Series.
I was playing.

121
00:06:16,058 --> 00:06:18,694
Aw, you finally got
to be a baseball player.

122
00:06:18,728 --> 00:06:22,262
Yeah, but why that game?
Why that series?

123
00:06:22,297 --> 00:06:24,164
Because that's when
it went bad.

124
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:26,067
I just realized

125
00:06:26,102 --> 00:06:29,071
nothing I had was mine
because the game was thrown.

126
00:06:29,106 --> 00:06:32,476
Oh, Roger, please don't feel
guilty about your advantages.

127
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:35,077
I, for one, am not gonna let
a bunch of dirty teenagers

128
00:06:35,112 --> 00:06:37,112
in the paper disrupt
the order of things.

129
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:39,916
I'm not.
I'm trying to meet with Firestone.

130
00:06:41,218 --> 00:06:42,986
It's a huge favor, I know.

131
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,923
But I lost everything
when we lost Lucky Strike.

132
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,895
I thought you married Jane
because I had gotten old.

133
00:06:53,531 --> 00:06:57,234
And then I realized
it was because you had.

134
00:06:57,268 --> 00:07:00,939
I haven't had
a heart attack since.

135
00:07:00,973 --> 00:07:03,275
Well, I don't see
what the harm could be.

136
00:07:03,309 --> 00:07:05,943
You are still
supporting all of us.

137
00:07:07,211 --> 00:07:09,548
Thank you.

138
00:07:09,582 --> 00:07:12,283
Whatever you can
find out by Friday.

139
00:07:13,554 --> 00:07:15,988
You'd be surprised.

140
00:07:36,944 --> 00:07:39,212
<i>- Hello?</i>
- We're in here.

141
00:07:43,886 --> 00:07:47,520
Sally, Bobby, this is
Dr. and Mrs. Calvet.

142
00:07:47,555 --> 00:07:49,389
- Marie.
- Emile.

143
00:07:49,423 --> 00:07:50,959
- <i>Un plaisir.</i>
- Hello.

144
00:07:50,993 --> 00:07:52,926
Hi.

145
00:07:52,961 --> 00:07:54,829
Henry's mother broke her ankle.

146
00:07:54,863 --> 00:07:56,397
- Oh, my goodness.
- That's terrible.

147
00:07:56,431 --> 00:07:58,200
It could have been a lot worse.

148
00:07:58,234 --> 00:07:59,933
Sally, you want to
tell them what happened?

149
00:07:59,968 --> 00:08:02,536
She tripped over
one of gene's toys.

150
00:08:02,571 --> 00:08:05,007
No, not that.

151
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:08,111
Sally called the police,
who called an ambulance.

152
00:08:08,145 --> 00:08:09,812
<i>And while they were waiting...</i>

153
00:08:09,846 --> 00:08:11,982
Sally, go on.

154
00:08:12,016 --> 00:08:15,684
I put her foot on a pillow and
put ice on it and kept her calm.

155
00:08:15,719 --> 00:08:18,654
- Oh, what a big girl.
- This is wonderful.

156
00:08:18,688 --> 00:08:20,456
Sally doesn't like fish.

157
00:08:20,491 --> 00:08:22,994
Well, as a reward,
I made spaghetti.

158
00:08:24,695 --> 00:08:27,264
I always made Megan spaghetti.

159
00:08:28,498 --> 00:08:31,234
That was her very favorite.

160
00:08:32,536 --> 00:08:35,372
So, you two

161
00:08:35,406 --> 00:08:37,041
will stay in the boys' room.

162
00:08:37,075 --> 00:08:39,410
We can't put Emile
and Marie in the bunk beds.

163
00:08:42,312 --> 00:08:45,315
I apologize,

164
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:47,718
but we had a long voyage.

165
00:08:47,753 --> 00:08:49,254
Good night, everyone.

166
00:08:56,728 --> 00:08:58,095
Do you give a lot of shots?

167
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:00,999
Oh, I am not a medical doctor.

168
00:09:01,034 --> 00:09:02,701
I am a professor.

169
00:09:04,138 --> 00:09:06,039
When you have a high
degree in any field,

170
00:09:06,073 --> 00:09:08,809
they call you a doctor.
It's from the middle ages.

171
00:09:08,843 --> 00:09:11,844
That's right.

172
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:14,947
Let me just make sure
mom got settled in.

173
00:09:52,422 --> 00:09:54,189
So, is Mr. Heinz
a down-to-earth,

174
00:09:54,224 --> 00:09:56,092
kind of steel-town,
German-Polish,

175
00:09:56,126 --> 00:09:57,860
drinks-beer-out-of-a-can
kind of guy?

176
00:09:57,894 --> 00:10:00,931
No, he's boring.
He's got a daughter.

177
00:10:00,965 --> 00:10:03,434
I think that's where he
gets all his shitty ideas.

178
00:10:04,936 --> 00:10:06,469
Oh, who finished the shrimp?

179
00:10:06,503 --> 00:10:08,538
- I asked.
- You still hungry?

180
00:10:08,572 --> 00:10:10,473
She's got to watch herself.

181
00:10:10,507 --> 00:10:13,010
Too much Chinese and we'll
have to go up a cup size.

182
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:15,446
- Shut up.
- What are you talking about?

183
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,515
We've been working on playtex.

184
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,917
Peggy's got a way
with the equipment.

185
00:10:20,318 --> 00:10:21,685
I'd love your opinion
on this, Abe.

186
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,823
Peggy, a traditionalist
in the bosom arena,

187
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:27,860
believes that we should sell
sexy bras to old ladies,

188
00:10:27,894 --> 00:10:30,595
whereas I think we should sell
adult bras to young girls.

189
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,932
Abe agrees with me.
So does Don.

190
00:10:32,967 --> 00:10:36,668
Well, it's not fair that just because
you're a boob-carrying consumer

191
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:38,638
that your opinion means more.

192
00:10:38,672 --> 00:10:41,674
You know what? I should take off.
I've got a deadline.

193
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:44,210
And, honestly, I didn't
have enough dinner.

194
00:10:44,245 --> 00:10:46,546
- I should go home.
- Oh, okay.

195
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:51,317
- I'll call you in the morning.
- Good night.

196
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:53,387
Mm-hmm.

197
00:10:57,426 --> 00:10:59,794
He's too good-looking
for you.

198
00:11:04,933 --> 00:11:08,403
My father won't care if he
finds out you read James Bond.

199
00:11:09,705 --> 00:11:12,208
You know what?
This is a good book.

200
00:11:12,242 --> 00:11:14,742
You should read it.

201
00:11:16,744 --> 00:11:19,414
Your father said they'll sightsee
with the kids during the day

202
00:11:19,448 --> 00:11:22,384
and watch them when we go out
with Heinz tomorrow night.

203
00:11:22,419 --> 00:11:24,586
You'll have to give
me some cash.

204
00:11:24,621 --> 00:11:26,523
He won't even buy
himself a pretzel.

205
00:11:28,693 --> 00:11:32,828
And they can watch them the
night of the cancer dinner.

206
00:11:32,862 --> 00:11:35,597
That's the whole reason
they came down,

207
00:11:35,632 --> 00:11:38,702
- to see you get the award.
- They came to see you.

208
00:11:38,736 --> 00:11:41,339
And your father's got a
meeting with some publishers.

209
00:11:41,373 --> 00:11:44,273
One publisher.
We'll call the sitter.

210
00:11:45,443 --> 00:11:47,376
Francis the talking mule?

211
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:49,479
Don't you want them to come?

212
00:11:53,418 --> 00:11:56,021
I don't think anything's
gonna make him like me.

213
00:11:56,056 --> 00:11:58,421
Because I'm his favorite.

214
00:11:58,456 --> 00:12:01,292
Why do you think my mother
is so competitive?

215
00:12:01,327 --> 00:12:02,760
I didn't see that.

216
00:12:02,794 --> 00:12:04,863
Didn't you notice
she touched you

217
00:12:04,897 --> 00:12:06,866
six times in an hour?

218
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,968
She's French.

219
00:12:09,002 --> 00:12:12,436
No, that's not what that is.

220
00:12:15,441 --> 00:12:18,043
Well...

221
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:20,346
Goodnight.

222
00:12:21,548 --> 00:12:23,416
They'll be gone on Sunday.

223
00:12:40,114 --> 00:12:42,115
Do you have a minute?

224
00:12:42,116 --> 00:12:45,117
Lock that and get Dawn to hold
my calls so you can have five.

225
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,422
No, pervert.
This is about work.

226
00:12:48,656 --> 00:12:50,491
I think it is, anyway.

227
00:12:50,526 --> 00:12:52,560
I think I have an idea.

228
00:12:52,595 --> 00:12:54,995
It might be really good.

229
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:57,231
But it might be terrible.

230
00:12:57,265 --> 00:13:01,704
Well, you've established
a firm bed of insecurity.

231
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:03,805
Okay.

232
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,209
Last night when I was
feeding the kids spaghetti,

233
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:08,844
I realized that my mother
had made it for me

234
00:13:08,878 --> 00:13:11,312
and that her mother
had made it for her.

235
00:13:11,347 --> 00:13:15,284
And I got this picture
in my head of her becoming me

236
00:13:15,318 --> 00:13:18,255
<i>like with one of those</i>
<i>movie dissolves.</i>

237
00:13:18,289 --> 00:13:21,191
And then this morning
in the shower,

238
00:13:21,226 --> 00:13:23,358
I realized you could
take it all the way back

239
00:13:23,392 --> 00:13:25,795
to cavemen and then
do the middle ages,

240
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:27,765
the renaissance,
all the way up to now

241
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:31,602
and then the future,
like a colony

242
00:13:31,637 --> 00:13:34,874
on the moon and you see
earth out the window.

243
00:13:34,908 --> 00:13:37,006
That's very good.

244
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,109
But we don't sell spaghetti.

245
00:13:39,144 --> 00:13:42,480
No, Heinz baked beans.

246
00:13:42,514 --> 00:13:44,215
Oh.

247
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,819
It solves a lot
of problems, doesn't it?

248
00:13:50,256 --> 00:13:52,122
My God.

249
00:13:52,157 --> 00:13:53,691
Get over here.

250
00:13:53,725 --> 00:13:56,695
No, I don't want
to change the subject.

251
00:13:56,729 --> 00:13:59,832
I'm not changing the subject.

252
00:14:01,335 --> 00:14:03,103
What are we showing tomorrow?

253
00:14:03,137 --> 00:14:04,736
Human cannonball.

254
00:14:04,771 --> 00:14:06,806
I mean, it's funny
and I loved it,

255
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,240
but...

256
00:14:09,943 --> 00:14:12,478
Dawn, get Stan and Ginsberg
in here right away.

257
00:14:12,513 --> 00:14:15,516
Oh, they're gonna hate me.
Tell them it was your idea.

258
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:18,017
You don't really want me
to do that, do you?

259
00:14:18,051 --> 00:14:19,485
No.

260
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,656
"Kids want beans
and they have forever."

261
00:14:22,691 --> 00:14:25,425
Oh, I had something like,

262
00:14:25,459 --> 00:14:28,996
"Heinz beans,
some things never change."

263
00:14:29,031 --> 00:14:31,664
Jesus, I think that's better.

264
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:37,139
- You rang?
- I'm gonna need both of you on Surrette.

265
00:14:37,173 --> 00:14:39,274
We're changing Heinz.

266
00:14:41,177 --> 00:14:43,411
<i>Mr. Drexler for you.</i>

267
00:14:44,414 --> 00:14:47,081
Thank you, Patricia.

268
00:14:47,115 --> 00:14:50,252
- Hello?
- How's Minetta tavern sound for dinner?

269
00:14:50,286 --> 00:14:52,288
It's Thursday.
Not good.

270
00:14:52,323 --> 00:14:55,124
- You're gonna eat anyway.
- Well, come by.

271
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:58,694
I'm not coming by. I can't talk to
you there and I don't want to wait.

272
00:15:00,363 --> 00:15:02,231
Oh, okay.

273
00:15:02,265 --> 00:15:04,600
I could meet you early
if I come back.

274
00:15:04,634 --> 00:15:06,102
6:00?

275
00:15:06,136 --> 00:15:08,305
7:00.
I'll see you there.

276
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:11,209
She couldn't have been
struck by lightning a week ago?

277
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,542
You think that's her idea?

278
00:15:15,812 --> 00:15:17,281
What happened?

279
00:15:17,315 --> 00:15:19,449
Boss's wife had an idea.

280
00:15:19,484 --> 00:15:22,754
- Is it any good?
- It's better than what we had.

281
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:25,591
Good for her.

282
00:15:27,725 --> 00:15:29,826
<i>Come in.</i>

283
00:15:31,696 --> 00:15:33,865
I'm supposed to be in the
final mix for Vicks tonight

284
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,903
and I need to switch it.
It's very important.

285
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:39,706
Who scheduled it.

286
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:42,040
I have something else to do.

287
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:45,176
Well, that almost never
happens, so don't feel bad.

288
00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:47,447
It doesn't, does it?

289
00:15:48,682 --> 00:15:50,451
Can I have a cigarette?

290
00:15:50,485 --> 00:15:52,486
<i>Joan?</i>

291
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:57,792
Do you want to close the door?

292
00:16:06,268 --> 00:16:09,238
I thought everything
was going great, but...

293
00:16:11,673 --> 00:16:14,075
Now I have this terrible
feeling about Abe.

294
00:16:15,979 --> 00:16:17,512
I think he's gonna end it.

295
00:16:17,547 --> 00:16:19,047
Why?

296
00:16:19,081 --> 00:16:21,083
He wants to have dinner

297
00:16:21,117 --> 00:16:23,052
and he knows
weeknights are hard.

298
00:16:23,086 --> 00:16:25,352
And we just saw
each other last night.

299
00:16:25,386 --> 00:16:27,756
And he wouldn't
take no for an answer.

300
00:16:32,763 --> 00:16:35,632
Well, it's been my experience

301
00:16:35,667 --> 00:16:39,534
that when a man insists on a meal,
he has something important to say.

302
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:43,272
It's usually a proposal.

303
00:16:44,675 --> 00:16:46,510
Really?

304
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,114
Well, that's you.

305
00:16:50,148 --> 00:16:52,482
Men don't take
the time to end things.

306
00:16:52,516 --> 00:16:54,351
They ignore you

307
00:16:54,385 --> 00:16:57,387
until you insist on
a declaration of hate.

308
00:16:57,421 --> 00:16:59,490
Someone dumped you?

309
00:16:59,524 --> 00:17:01,626
Peggy, I'm just like
everybody else.

310
00:17:03,562 --> 00:17:05,662
If he's going to end it,
which I doubt,

311
00:17:05,697 --> 00:17:07,665
you'll know what to do.

312
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,902
If he's going to propose, you'd
better have your answer prepared,

313
00:17:10,936 --> 00:17:13,170
especially if it's no.

314
00:17:15,074 --> 00:17:17,109
Gosh.

315
00:17:21,547 --> 00:17:24,550
I should go home
and change, shouldn't I?

316
00:17:24,584 --> 00:17:26,786
Or better yet,

317
00:17:26,821 --> 00:17:28,487
go shopping.

318
00:17:37,899 --> 00:17:40,033
So the mom's wearing
the glass space helmet

319
00:17:40,067 --> 00:17:42,169
and the kid took his off
and put it on the table?

320
00:17:42,203 --> 00:17:44,071
That way, the kid
can eat the beans.

321
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:45,740
And I thought you
could do the whole thing

322
00:17:45,774 --> 00:17:48,107
with the same actors
playing mother and child.

323
00:17:48,142 --> 00:17:50,376
<i>Mr. Sterling's here to see you.</i>

324
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:57,052
Oh, you two
are actually working.

325
00:17:57,086 --> 00:17:59,155
Go break it into frames
and have Stan draw it up.

326
00:18:03,825 --> 00:18:06,662
I've been working
this morning, too.

327
00:18:06,696 --> 00:18:08,830
You mean you finished yours,
you're moving onto mine?

328
00:18:08,865 --> 00:18:11,668
No, I've been in
the war room, Don,

329
00:18:11,702 --> 00:18:14,171
preparing for the American
Cancer dinner.

330
00:18:14,205 --> 00:18:17,573
Caroline went to the library and
got me pictures of these guys.

331
00:18:17,607 --> 00:18:20,275
I'm $50 away
from a seating chart.

332
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:21,678
Look, I don't take
this honor lightly.

333
00:18:21,712 --> 00:18:23,179
Good.
Say something like that.

334
00:18:23,213 --> 00:18:25,883
Titans of industry
are giving you an award.

335
00:18:25,917 --> 00:18:28,553
We are being lowered in a
bucket into a gold mine.

336
00:18:28,588 --> 00:18:31,187
I'm gonna bring my pick and
crack something off the wall.

337
00:18:31,221 --> 00:18:33,456
I don't think it's
that kind of atmosphere.

338
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:36,259
You actually saying that
with a straight face?

339
00:18:36,294 --> 00:18:38,328
You forget why
you wrote that letter?

340
00:18:38,362 --> 00:18:40,164
Are you forgetting you said
it would kill our business?

341
00:18:40,199 --> 00:18:41,499
So you think cigarettes are bad

342
00:18:41,533 --> 00:18:42,701
and so are the people
who sell them?

343
00:18:42,736 --> 00:18:44,334
It's what they think.

344
00:18:44,368 --> 00:18:46,838
Mary Lasker and the rest of
them know it as the truth.

345
00:18:46,872 --> 00:18:48,438
It doesn't matter
why I wrote it.

346
00:18:48,473 --> 00:18:50,007
You're right.

347
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:52,110
Who knows why people
in history did good things?

348
00:18:52,144 --> 00:18:55,147
For all we know, Jesus was trying to
get the loaves and fishes account.

349
00:18:55,181 --> 00:18:58,783
I'll do what I can, but I'm
not gonna go overboard.

350
00:18:58,818 --> 00:19:00,485
My in-laws don't think
I'm Jesus.

351
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:01,954
They'll be clapping
and cheering.

352
00:19:01,989 --> 00:19:03,122
They don't know
you're a hypocrite.

353
00:19:03,156 --> 00:19:04,924
Megan's father is a communist.

354
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:07,292
- What?
- He's a socialist

355
00:19:07,327 --> 00:19:09,329
or a maoist or some ideology

356
00:19:11,931 --> 00:19:14,634
plus, you know, I'm
sleeping with his daughter.

357
00:19:14,668 --> 00:19:16,069
So he'll see you shaking hands.

358
00:19:16,104 --> 00:19:17,604
You know,
it's very interesting,

359
00:19:17,639 --> 00:19:19,840
but a lot of times you think
people are looking at you,

360
00:19:19,874 --> 00:19:22,208
but they're not.
Their mind's elsewhere.

361
00:19:22,243 --> 00:19:25,312
Lots of people that haven't taken LSD.
Already know that, Roger.

362
00:19:25,347 --> 00:19:26,980
You're gonna be like
an Italian bride--

363
00:19:27,015 --> 00:19:29,716
People lining up
to give you envelopes.

364
00:19:43,071 --> 00:19:45,340
- You look good.
- Thank you.

365
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,790
The steak is supposed
to be good here.

366
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:02,191
The menu's huge.

367
00:20:02,226 --> 00:20:05,630
The service is incredible, but I told
them to leave us alone a second.

368
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,697
Can I get a drink?

369
00:20:08,732 --> 00:20:10,533
Yeah, sure.

370
00:20:10,567 --> 00:20:12,201
I guess I can get
somebody's attention.

371
00:20:14,038 --> 00:20:15,773
No.

372
00:20:15,808 --> 00:20:17,341
Forget it.

373
00:20:20,447 --> 00:20:22,379
What do you want to say?

374
00:20:22,414 --> 00:20:24,081
Okay.

375
00:20:26,384 --> 00:20:28,786
I've been thinking about this.

376
00:20:28,821 --> 00:20:32,023
We're at a place where
we love being together.

377
00:20:32,058 --> 00:20:34,494
It always seems to be
some kind of pain in the ass

378
00:20:34,528 --> 00:20:36,528
to be in the same place
when the lights go out.

379
00:20:37,697 --> 00:20:40,098
Oh, my God.

380
00:20:40,132 --> 00:20:42,468
Yeah, well,

381
00:20:42,502 --> 00:20:46,072
I think we should
move in together.

382
00:20:47,742 --> 00:20:50,542
I mean, how would
we ever do that?

383
00:20:50,577 --> 00:20:52,178
Well, however you want.

384
00:20:52,212 --> 00:20:54,514
I mean, I think your place
would be better.

385
00:20:56,984 --> 00:20:58,451
It's because that's how I feel.

386
00:20:58,486 --> 00:21:00,087
I just like the idea
of the two of us

387
00:21:00,121 --> 00:21:02,457
waking up in the same
place every day.

388
00:21:02,492 --> 00:21:04,491
The two of us writing
together in the same room,

389
00:21:04,525 --> 00:21:07,060
looking at each other
every once in a while.

390
00:21:07,095 --> 00:21:08,996
Grocery shopping.

391
00:21:12,134 --> 00:21:13,969
Look,

392
00:21:14,003 --> 00:21:15,804
I know it's a big decision.

393
00:21:15,838 --> 00:21:19,039
So you don't have to say
yes or no right now.

394
00:21:21,677 --> 00:21:23,912
Maybe we should order.

395
00:21:28,819 --> 00:21:30,553
Oh, excuse me.

396
00:21:31,854 --> 00:21:34,255
Yes.

397
00:21:37,828 --> 00:21:40,330
You've made me so happy.

398
00:21:40,364 --> 00:21:42,767
Me, too.

399
00:21:45,501 --> 00:21:47,870
You still want to eat?

400
00:21:48,872 --> 00:21:50,574
I do.

401
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:57,048
Actually, my father is on the board
of the American cancer society.

402
00:21:57,082 --> 00:21:59,449
Although he said the voting
was unanimous for Don.

403
00:21:59,483 --> 00:22:01,151
Well, that is quite an honor.

404
00:22:01,185 --> 00:22:03,654
And as much as we
appreciate the invitation,

405
00:22:03,688 --> 00:22:05,222
we're heading back
to Pittsburgh

406
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:07,425
the minute I leave
your office smiling.

407
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:09,394
You're really gonna rush off?

408
00:22:09,429 --> 00:22:11,729
I think Ken got you tickets to the new
Edward Albee play.

409
00:22:11,764 --> 00:22:14,798
- Oh, we saw it on Tuesday.
- You did?

410
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:19,572
Yeah, we came in
a couple days early.

411
00:22:19,606 --> 00:22:22,775
Alice loves the city.
Did I not mention that?

412
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:25,244
No reason to, I guess.

413
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:26,780
Raymond, would you
order me a sanka?

414
00:22:26,814 --> 00:22:28,313
I'm gonna freshen up.

415
00:22:29,715 --> 00:22:31,817
And some dessert.

416
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:33,486
Come on, why not?

417
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:36,823
You know, I've always
wanted to eat here.

418
00:22:36,857 --> 00:22:39,026
I thought it was just
for time life employees.

419
00:22:45,533 --> 00:22:48,603
You know, I really enjoy
spending time with you.

420
00:22:48,637 --> 00:22:51,306
I feel the same way, Alice.

421
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:55,111
I'm only saying this because Raymond's
putting on such a good show.

422
00:22:55,145 --> 00:22:57,077
He didn't want to go to dinner.

423
00:22:57,112 --> 00:22:59,246
He just wanted to
do it in your office.

424
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,549
He's a good man, I swear.

425
00:23:01,584 --> 00:23:03,486
Of course he is.

426
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,521
I was really prepared
to not like you,

427
00:23:05,555 --> 00:23:07,724
but you're so good
for that man.

428
00:23:07,758 --> 00:23:10,959
- And you're so lively.
- Thank you, Alice.

429
00:23:10,994 --> 00:23:14,061
I'm just saying I hope we
can continue to be friends.

430
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:21,905
No, see, the truth in packaging
bill they wanted to pass

431
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:24,940
would hit everybody hard,
but now there's no teeth.

432
00:23:24,974 --> 00:23:26,909
So nothing should change.

433
00:23:30,248 --> 00:23:32,382
We're getting fired.

434
00:23:37,855 --> 00:23:41,125
Sorry, but we ended up getting more
dessert than we bargained for.

435
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,960
Who's up for a nightcap?

436
00:23:42,994 --> 00:23:44,595
That's okay.
I think we're gonna turn in.

437
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:47,165
Do me the favor, Raymond.

438
00:23:47,199 --> 00:23:49,000
You don't know this,
but you've rescued me

439
00:23:49,035 --> 00:23:50,935
from a house full
of in-laws and children.

440
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:53,171
Can we get a bottle of
sauternes and six glasses?

441
00:23:53,205 --> 00:23:57,075
I don't know. We have the early
meeting tomorrow and the flight back.

442
00:23:57,109 --> 00:23:59,945
You know, Don jokes about
having a house full of people,

443
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:03,316
but he loves it.
Don?

444
00:24:04,918 --> 00:24:07,952
Don, tell him about last night.

445
00:24:13,728 --> 00:24:16,663
Oh, well,

446
00:24:16,698 --> 00:24:18,932
we had three generations
under one roof--

447
00:24:18,966 --> 00:24:21,234
Megan, her mother
and my 12-year-old Sally.

448
00:24:21,268 --> 00:24:23,936
Sally won't eat anything,
as you might imagine.

449
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:26,740
Except beans, of course.

450
00:24:26,774 --> 00:24:28,142
It's true.

451
00:24:28,177 --> 00:24:29,777
They do like them.

452
00:24:29,812 --> 00:24:31,414
Never had any worries
about that.

453
00:24:31,448 --> 00:24:34,314
You should have seen it--
Megan bringing the pot in,

454
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:36,450
spooning them out on the plate,
her mother was smiling.

455
00:24:36,484 --> 00:24:38,519
- What a darling scene.
- Actually, I didn't know

456
00:24:38,553 --> 00:24:41,456
if I had done something wrong
because Don was staring at us.

457
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:44,960
But apparently
I'd given him this idea.

458
00:24:44,994 --> 00:24:47,130
She did.

459
00:24:47,164 --> 00:24:50,031
Don, you sure you want
to talk about this now?

460
00:24:50,065 --> 00:24:51,666
Let him talk.

461
00:24:53,269 --> 00:24:55,838
Obviously there's more to it,
but I think it would be

462
00:24:55,872 --> 00:24:58,508
a series of one-shot
little movies.

463
00:24:58,543 --> 00:25:01,644
One mother starting
in the prehistoric caves

464
00:25:01,678 --> 00:25:04,680
serving beans to a shaggy
little boy by the fire.

465
00:25:04,715 --> 00:25:06,949
Then a Greek woman

466
00:25:06,983 --> 00:25:09,786
in a toga with
a little shepherd boy.

467
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:12,056
Then Marie Antoinette
to a little prince.

468
00:25:12,057 --> 00:25:14,057
Mary Jane to a pioneer boy.

469
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,093
All the way through
the gay '90s to today

470
00:25:17,128 --> 00:25:19,497
in a kitchen like yours.

471
00:25:19,531 --> 00:25:21,931
Would it all be the same
mother and child?

472
00:25:23,636 --> 00:25:26,271
We hadn't thought of that,
but that might work.

473
00:25:26,305 --> 00:25:28,807
Tell him the rest of it.

474
00:25:28,841 --> 00:25:31,509
Well, it goes past
present day to the future

475
00:25:31,543 --> 00:25:34,613
to a little lunar kitchen with
the earth off in the window.

476
00:25:34,648 --> 00:25:38,150
You know, futuristic
clothing, interesting bowls.

477
00:25:38,184 --> 00:25:40,886
The kid has just taken off
his space helmet

478
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,855
as he takes a warm bite.

479
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:44,823
Oh, that's clever.

480
00:25:44,857 --> 00:25:46,258
That was Megan's idea.

481
00:25:46,293 --> 00:25:48,193
When Don told me, I thought,

482
00:25:48,227 --> 00:25:50,163
we're all so busy
and we rush around

483
00:25:50,197 --> 00:25:52,266
and it will probably
always be like that.

484
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:55,335
But a mother and child

485
00:25:55,369 --> 00:25:58,470
and dinner--
That'll never change.

486
00:26:00,207 --> 00:26:02,175
"Heinz beans,

487
00:26:02,209 --> 00:26:04,445
some things never change."

488
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:06,614
- Can I get some more coffee?
- Shh!

489
00:26:08,983 --> 00:26:11,119
I don't know what to say.

490
00:26:13,421 --> 00:26:16,056
Let me think about it.
See the pictures.

491
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:17,959
Raymond, really?
It's beautiful.

492
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:20,429
And it's exactly--

493
00:26:20,463 --> 00:26:22,832
I don't know.
Can I get the cream, please?

494
00:26:25,434 --> 00:26:28,669
Well, we were dancing around
a few other things, too.

495
00:26:28,704 --> 00:26:31,473
No, we weren't.
This is what you're gonna see tomorrow.

496
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:33,476
It's a once-in-a-lifetime idea.

497
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:36,179
Raymond, you could save yourself
a trip to the office tomorrow

498
00:26:36,214 --> 00:26:39,216
or we can get in the
elevator, go down 11 floors

499
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:41,383
and show you
the work right now.

500
00:26:43,353 --> 00:26:45,888
It's the future.

501
00:26:45,922 --> 00:26:48,291
That's all I ever wanted.

502
00:26:49,828 --> 00:26:52,831
Should we change that
sauternes to champagne?

503
00:26:54,632 --> 00:26:56,966
Sure, why the hell not?

504
00:27:05,545 --> 00:27:07,478
72nd and Park.

505
00:27:13,586 --> 00:27:15,854
Do you know you're good
at all of it?

506
00:27:15,888 --> 00:27:17,956
You had the idea

507
00:27:17,991 --> 00:27:21,626
feeding me the pitch, knowing to
pull the trigger at that moment.

508
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:24,463
I was just gonna scream
in his stupid face.

509
00:27:24,498 --> 00:27:26,565
I'm glad you didn't.

510
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,768
I love the way you sold that.

511
00:27:28,802 --> 00:27:30,770
Oh, my God.

512
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:33,874
I want you.

513
00:27:35,642 --> 00:27:37,976
But we have to go
back to the house

514
00:27:38,011 --> 00:27:40,647
with the kids and your parents.

515
00:27:42,082 --> 00:27:45,051
We can go back to the office.

516
00:27:45,085 --> 00:27:47,955
Change of plans.
Back to time life, please.

517
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:11,012
There's champagne
in the conference room.

518
00:28:11,047 --> 00:28:14,150
Don and Megan sold Heinz
last night over dinner.

519
00:28:16,087 --> 00:28:18,853
But, by looking
at your fingers,

520
00:28:18,887 --> 00:28:20,989
maybe you're not
in the mood to celebrate.

521
00:28:21,023 --> 00:28:23,460
No, of course.

522
00:28:25,463 --> 00:28:27,631
It was better than that.

523
00:28:27,666 --> 00:28:29,467
Really?

524
00:28:29,501 --> 00:28:31,668
We're moving in together.

525
00:28:31,702 --> 00:28:33,703
He asked me.

526
00:28:33,737 --> 00:28:35,839
Shacking up?

527
00:28:35,873 --> 00:28:37,508
My goodness.

528
00:28:37,542 --> 00:28:39,743
I know, but--

529
00:28:39,778 --> 00:28:41,279
No, Peggy.

530
00:28:42,949 --> 00:28:44,650
Good for you.

531
00:28:44,685 --> 00:28:46,784
Really?

532
00:28:46,818 --> 00:28:49,186
You're not just saying that?

533
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:52,924
No.
I don't know.

534
00:28:52,959 --> 00:28:56,529
Sounds like he wants to be
with you no matter what.

535
00:28:58,264 --> 00:29:01,232
I thought you were going
to be disappointed for me.

536
00:29:01,266 --> 00:29:03,268
I think it's very romantic.

537
00:29:03,303 --> 00:29:05,570
It is, isn't it?

538
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:10,310
We don't need a piece of paper.

539
00:29:10,344 --> 00:29:12,846
I mean, not that marriage
is wrong or anything.

540
00:29:12,881 --> 00:29:15,047
Greg has a piece of paper
with the US Army

541
00:29:15,081 --> 00:29:17,851
that's more important
than the one he has with me.

542
00:29:17,886 --> 00:29:20,720
Oh, I'm sorry.

543
00:29:20,754 --> 00:29:23,123
It is what it is.

544
00:29:23,157 --> 00:29:25,426
I think you're brave.

545
00:29:26,996 --> 00:29:28,929
I think it's
a beautiful statement.

546
00:29:28,963 --> 00:29:31,364
Congratulations.

547
00:29:36,672 --> 00:29:40,108
So Megan comes out and does a double
secret reverse to Don that it's over.

548
00:29:40,143 --> 00:29:42,743
Then they just passed it back and
forth like a couple of pros.

549
00:29:42,777 --> 00:29:45,647
- You weren't even there.
- Way to go.

550
00:29:45,681 --> 00:29:47,416
You should be shaking her hand.

551
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:50,687
- It's just beginner's luck.
- Oh.

552
00:29:50,721 --> 00:29:54,658
- I'm gonna go tell Peggy.
- Tell everybody.

553
00:29:54,692 --> 00:29:56,691
<i>You want the
pleasure of telling Lane?</i>

554
00:29:56,725 --> 00:29:58,160
<i>No, you earned it.</i>

555
00:29:58,194 --> 00:30:00,495
Besides, we're still
at least 15 grand

556
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:02,398
out of pocket on the account.

557
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:10,272
Megan!
Congratulations.

558
00:30:10,306 --> 00:30:12,041
- Oh, you heard.
- Yeah.

559
00:30:12,075 --> 00:30:14,044
Joan told me Harry said
you signed Heinz.

560
00:30:15,546 --> 00:30:16,981
I don't want to take
all the credit.

561
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:19,684
Why aren't you
jumping up and down?

562
00:30:19,718 --> 00:30:21,653
I don't know what the Canadian
equivalent of baseball is,

563
00:30:21,688 --> 00:30:23,254
but this is a home run.

564
00:30:23,287 --> 00:30:26,389
- We have baseball.
- Well, this is a home run.

565
00:30:26,423 --> 00:30:29,259
I know what you did
and it is a big deal.

566
00:30:29,294 --> 00:30:32,197
And when it happened to me, they
acted like it happens all the time.

567
00:30:32,231 --> 00:30:35,034
It doesn't.

568
00:30:35,069 --> 00:30:37,003
I tried to crack that nut.

569
00:30:37,037 --> 00:30:39,571
I mean, if anything,
I should be jealous.

570
00:30:39,606 --> 00:30:43,174
But I look at you
and I feel like,

571
00:30:43,209 --> 00:30:45,010
I don't know,

572
00:30:45,044 --> 00:30:47,313
I'm getting to experience
my first time again.

573
00:30:48,548 --> 00:30:51,018
It's a good day for me.

574
00:30:52,619 --> 00:30:55,521
This is as good
as this job gets.

575
00:30:56,523 --> 00:30:58,324
Savor it.

576
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,862
You're right.

577
00:31:01,896 --> 00:31:03,664
I will.

578
00:31:11,923 --> 00:31:15,326
Good morning, Emile.
Where is everyone?

579
00:31:15,361 --> 00:31:17,828
The girls went out
and Bobby is helping me

580
00:31:17,863 --> 00:31:19,829
fill my fountain pen.

581
00:31:22,501 --> 00:31:24,835
Thanks, Emile.

582
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:27,306
Hello.

583
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,809
<i>Bonjour.</i>

584
00:31:29,843 --> 00:31:31,109
Uh-oh.

585
00:31:31,144 --> 00:31:32,511
It's not as bad as you think,

586
00:31:32,546 --> 00:31:34,245
but it's pretty bad.

587
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,648
- Sally.
- Go ahead.

588
00:31:36,682 --> 00:31:39,685
Papa, can I come with you to see
you get your award tonight?

589
00:31:39,719 --> 00:31:41,454
Papa?

590
00:31:41,489 --> 00:31:44,357
I don't know.

591
00:31:44,392 --> 00:31:47,060
I got a dress.
Please?

592
00:31:47,094 --> 00:31:49,961
Every daughter should get
to see her father as a success.

593
00:32:02,676 --> 00:32:04,644
It's fine.

594
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:06,179
Sweetheart, of course
you can go.

595
00:32:06,214 --> 00:32:09,217
Thank you, daddy.
Can I show you my dress?

596
00:32:12,788 --> 00:32:15,523
Bobby, put that away.
You two watch TV or something.

597
00:32:21,297 --> 00:32:23,131
What was that about?

598
00:32:27,204 --> 00:32:29,238
My father went to his
publisher this morning

599
00:32:29,272 --> 00:32:31,707
and was back within the hour.

600
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:34,343
And then he got on
the phone with claudette,

601
00:32:34,377 --> 00:32:36,446
his latest grad student.

602
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,117
My mother walked in.
He was crying, apparently.

603
00:32:40,151 --> 00:32:43,221
Well, he's got a lot
wrapped up in that book.

604
00:32:43,254 --> 00:32:45,655
He should be crying
to my mother, Don.

605
00:32:47,058 --> 00:32:49,627
Oh, right.

606
00:32:51,496 --> 00:32:53,930
What about tonight?

607
00:32:53,965 --> 00:32:56,468
They do this all the time.

608
00:32:56,502 --> 00:32:58,802
They'll recover.
They always do.

609
00:33:06,945 --> 00:33:08,914
Hurry, it's really hot.

610
00:33:15,688 --> 00:33:17,423
Wait.

611
00:33:28,735 --> 00:33:30,837
Hi, ma.
Come in.

612
00:33:30,872 --> 00:33:32,773
Hello, peaches.

613
00:33:32,808 --> 00:33:34,609
Abraham.

614
00:33:34,643 --> 00:33:36,577
Hello, Katherine.

615
00:33:36,612 --> 00:33:39,245
Oh, you brought dessert.

616
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,080
Just leave it in the box.
I'll take it out.

617
00:33:41,115 --> 00:33:42,749
It's very delicate.

618
00:33:44,019 --> 00:33:45,821
You want some sherry?

619
00:33:45,855 --> 00:33:47,488
Sure.

620
00:33:50,294 --> 00:33:51,928
Smells good in here.

621
00:33:51,962 --> 00:33:54,162
Peggy made a ham.
It's my favorite.

622
00:33:54,197 --> 00:33:55,830
Really?

623
00:34:02,505 --> 00:34:05,042
- Are you babysitting?
- No.

624
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:08,610
- Hello.
- Hello.

625
00:34:08,645 --> 00:34:13,282
Roger Sterling, this is Dr.
Emile and Marie Calvet.

626
00:34:13,317 --> 00:34:15,319
You ladies look ravishing.

627
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:17,420
- Thank you.
<i>- Can I get you a drink?</i>

628
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:19,423
Uh, no.
I mean, yes.

629
00:34:19,458 --> 00:34:21,623
But does anyone know
how to tie this thing?

630
00:34:21,658 --> 00:34:23,827
- Here.
- I'm stag tonight

631
00:34:23,862 --> 00:34:25,829
and my doorman
wears a clip-on.

632
00:34:27,198 --> 00:34:29,233
I am surprised.

633
00:34:30,602 --> 00:34:32,803
You seem like you were
born in a bow tie.

634
00:34:32,838 --> 00:34:34,806
I didn't tie that one either.

635
00:34:37,276 --> 00:34:39,443
<i>Good evening, everyone.</i>

636
00:34:39,478 --> 00:34:41,113
My God.

637
00:34:45,852 --> 00:34:47,753
Sally, you look so beautiful.

638
00:34:47,787 --> 00:34:51,455
You're beautiful, sweetheart.

639
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:53,692
<i>Don, there is
nothing you can do.</i>

640
00:34:53,726 --> 00:34:55,862
No matter what, one day
your little girl

641
00:34:55,897 --> 00:34:58,164
will spread her legs
and fly away.

642
00:34:59,934 --> 00:35:02,468
- What? It's true.
- Wings, daddy.

643
00:35:04,971 --> 00:35:06,739
Take off the makeup
and the boots.

644
00:35:06,774 --> 00:35:08,875
What? No.

645
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:11,345
Or you can stay home.

646
00:35:12,547 --> 00:35:15,216
Fine.

647
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,795
This is the ballroom?

648
00:35:26,829 --> 00:35:28,831
There's no staircase.

649
00:35:28,865 --> 00:35:30,499
But here's a handsome prince.

650
00:35:31,967 --> 00:35:34,068
Nah.

651
00:35:34,102 --> 00:35:36,238
Hello, all.
Don't you look lovely?

652
00:35:36,272 --> 00:35:38,706
I hope you don't mind if I steal
your father for a moment.

653
00:35:38,741 --> 00:35:40,643
I'd love for you
to meet Ed Baxter.

654
00:35:40,677 --> 00:35:42,678
- Ken's father-in-law.
- No, of course.

655
00:35:42,712 --> 00:35:45,149
Megan, could you join us?

656
00:35:45,181 --> 00:35:47,149
I got 'em.

657
00:35:50,153 --> 00:35:52,488
Ed, Don Draper, his wife Megan.

658
00:35:52,522 --> 00:35:55,692
Pleased to meet you.
Both of you.

659
00:35:55,726 --> 00:35:57,461
I guess I should
thank you for this.

660
00:35:57,495 --> 00:36:01,097
No, don't thank me.
I had to recuse myself.

661
00:36:01,131 --> 00:36:03,466
But you write
some stirring copy.

662
00:36:05,103 --> 00:36:07,004
Actually, Megan's a hell
of a copywriter as well.

663
00:36:07,038 --> 00:36:09,574
Well, I should lie,
but Cynthia told me

664
00:36:09,608 --> 00:36:11,542
all about your dinner.

665
00:36:11,577 --> 00:36:14,911
- She's a natural.
- Thank you.

666
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:22,753
- Who's he?
- His name is Ed. He's at dow corning.

667
00:36:22,788 --> 00:36:26,292
They make beautiful dishes,
glassware, napalm.

668
00:36:26,326 --> 00:36:28,393
- Peter Campbell.
- Emile.

669
00:36:28,427 --> 00:36:30,161
And his wife's name is Lillian.

670
00:36:30,196 --> 00:36:32,631
- Don't forget that.
- I won't.

671
00:36:32,665 --> 00:36:36,535
And those two over there, the
balding guy with Margaret Dumont,

672
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:39,072
he's at GM.
Where's your purse?

673
00:36:40,641 --> 00:36:42,574
You're gonna be my date.

674
00:36:42,609 --> 00:36:44,843
Every business card
I bring back,

675
00:36:44,878 --> 00:36:47,547
you're gonna put it in your purse
and say "go get 'em, tiger."

676
00:36:49,318 --> 00:36:52,285
- So I manage those accounts.
- I don't understand.

677
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,454
What do you do every day?

678
00:36:55,489 --> 00:36:57,457
Well, what do you do?

679
00:36:57,492 --> 00:37:00,094
You're a scholar
and an intellectual, right?

680
00:37:00,095 --> 00:37:01,830
Yes.

681
00:37:01,864 --> 00:37:04,567
Actually, from what I hear,
you're a bit of a trailblazer.

682
00:37:04,601 --> 00:37:08,103
I don't know if that's true.

683
00:37:08,138 --> 00:37:11,072
I bet the world would be better off if
they knew about the work you're doing.

684
00:37:12,675 --> 00:37:14,709
You are very kind.

685
00:37:16,046 --> 00:37:17,980
That, Emile,

686
00:37:18,015 --> 00:37:20,417
is what I do every day.

687
00:37:20,451 --> 00:37:23,885
Ah.

688
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,088
Shit.
I've got to beat the entree.

689
00:37:26,122 --> 00:37:28,891
Cover me.

690
00:37:28,926 --> 00:37:32,429
Your dad is very resourceful.

691
00:37:53,955 --> 00:37:56,124
Please.
I got this.

692
00:37:59,429 --> 00:38:01,763
I'm sorry, honey.
I wasn't gonna leave before dessert,

693
00:38:01,798 --> 00:38:03,666
but this is taking a little
longer than I thought.

694
00:38:08,871 --> 00:38:10,672
Well...

695
00:38:14,111 --> 00:38:16,779
We have something
we want to tell you.

696
00:38:16,814 --> 00:38:18,682
Really?

697
00:38:18,717 --> 00:38:22,052
Abe and I are very
serious about each other

698
00:38:22,086 --> 00:38:25,922
and we've decided we're
going to live together.

699
00:38:25,957 --> 00:38:28,125
What?

700
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,794
Listen. I know
you may not approve,

701
00:38:30,829 --> 00:38:34,364
but it's important to me
that you understand

702
00:38:34,398 --> 00:38:36,834
what we're doing.

703
00:38:36,869 --> 00:38:39,371
I will take
very good care of her.

704
00:38:42,307 --> 00:38:44,776
You know what?

705
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:46,411
I'm gonna go.

706
00:38:46,445 --> 00:38:48,612
What?

707
00:38:48,646 --> 00:38:50,682
I'm gonna go.

708
00:38:50,716 --> 00:38:52,817
I need my cake.

709
00:38:52,852 --> 00:38:54,187
Why?

710
00:38:54,221 --> 00:38:56,155
Because I'm not
giving you a cake

711
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:58,657
to celebrate youse
living in sin.

712
00:39:00,127 --> 00:39:01,826
Would you rather
I not tell you?

713
00:39:01,861 --> 00:39:04,429
Yeah. You want to
stick it in my face?

714
00:39:04,463 --> 00:39:07,633
Just lie. You think you're the
first ones ever to do this?

715
00:39:10,538 --> 00:39:13,540
- Ma.
- What do you want from me?

716
00:39:13,574 --> 00:39:17,076
I'm gonna get you a cab.

717
00:39:19,046 --> 00:39:21,315
I invited you here as an adult

718
00:39:21,349 --> 00:39:24,452
because I didn't want to lie
and I want you in my life.

719
00:39:24,486 --> 00:39:27,323
Well, if you're an adult,
why do you care what I think?

720
00:39:27,357 --> 00:39:29,688
I thought you'd be relieved
I wasn't marrying the Jew.

721
00:39:29,723 --> 00:39:32,359
It has nothing to do with that!

722
00:39:32,394 --> 00:39:34,262
It's my fault.

723
00:39:34,297 --> 00:39:37,032
Because once your father died, there
was no one to set you straight.

724
00:39:37,066 --> 00:39:38,867
I know what I'm doing.

725
00:39:38,902 --> 00:39:40,970
And I think daddy would
want me to be happy.

726
00:39:41,004 --> 00:39:44,505
No. He'd be mad at you
the same way I am

727
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:47,075
because you are selling
yourself short.

728
00:39:47,109 --> 00:39:50,847
This boy, he will
use you for practice

729
00:39:50,881 --> 00:39:53,818
until he decides to get
married and have a family.

730
00:39:53,852 --> 00:39:56,421
And he will, believe me.

731
00:39:58,055 --> 00:40:00,123
You want me to be alone?

732
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:06,564
You know what
your aunt used to say?

733
00:40:09,769 --> 00:40:12,503
You're lonely, get a cat.

734
00:40:13,538 --> 00:40:15,474
They live 13 years,

735
00:40:15,508 --> 00:40:18,477
then you get another one and
another one after that.

736
00:40:18,511 --> 00:40:20,545
Then you're done.

737
00:40:21,983 --> 00:40:23,816
Thank you for dinner.

738
00:40:29,323 --> 00:40:32,058
<i>All of us here appreciate
your years of service.</i>

739
00:40:32,093 --> 00:40:35,261
Ooh, baked Alaska.
It's flaming, but they probably don't want

740
00:40:35,296 --> 00:40:37,664
- to wreck the speeches.
- You're wrecking the speeches.

741
00:40:37,699 --> 00:40:41,101
You're a mean drunk. You know that?

742
00:40:41,135 --> 00:40:44,705
<i>From the Sterling Cooper Draper
Pryce advertising firm...</i>

743
00:40:44,739 --> 00:40:46,907
- Oh, your daddy's next.
- <i>Mr. Donald Draper.</i>

744
00:40:49,445 --> 00:40:51,746
Thank you.

745
00:40:54,648 --> 00:40:56,884
Shouldn't I be at his side?

746
00:40:56,918 --> 00:40:58,720
Go get 'em, tiger.

747
00:41:10,033 --> 00:41:11,866
Can I see it?

748
00:41:19,144 --> 00:41:21,046
Do you want it?

749
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:24,380
No, you should keep it because
it makes you really happy.

750
00:41:27,217 --> 00:41:29,186
You know what makes me happy?

751
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:31,155
A beautiful young lady
who will someday

752
00:41:31,189 --> 00:41:33,258
be wearing makeup,
but not today.

753
00:41:39,531 --> 00:41:41,198
I got you a shirley temple.

754
00:41:41,232 --> 00:41:43,401
It's time to start
tapering off.

755
00:41:43,436 --> 00:41:45,570
And, Don, I promised Frank
from Ford over there

756
00:41:45,604 --> 00:41:47,339
you'd come and say hi.

757
00:42:05,625 --> 00:42:08,895
I'd buy you a drink, but I
think they're still free.

758
00:42:10,297 --> 00:42:12,899
I have been watching
you all night.

759
00:42:15,303 --> 00:42:18,504
You're so full of life
and ambition.

760
00:42:18,538 --> 00:42:20,073
Well, I've gotten
a lot of rejection,

761
00:42:20,108 --> 00:42:21,774
so who knows what I'm full of?

762
00:42:21,809 --> 00:42:25,079
When I was younger,

763
00:42:25,114 --> 00:42:28,449
it was my spirit
to try everything,

764
00:42:28,484 --> 00:42:30,452
get a taste,
know what was what,

765
00:42:30,487 --> 00:42:33,353
and never be sorry
for making the mistakes.

766
00:42:33,387 --> 00:42:35,689
And then one day,

767
00:42:35,724 --> 00:42:38,427
I made too many mistakes.

768
00:42:38,461 --> 00:42:40,462
Where was I that day?

769
00:42:40,497 --> 00:42:43,698
Inside you is a little boy.

770
00:42:43,733 --> 00:42:45,766
Well, Marie, I woke up one day

771
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:50,172
and I realized at what point
should you ever stop trying?

772
00:42:52,108 --> 00:42:55,077
I agree.

773
00:42:55,112 --> 00:42:57,314
We should have
everything we want.

774
00:43:01,018 --> 00:43:03,754
I'm going to the ladies' room.
Can you watch the award?

775
00:43:03,788 --> 00:43:05,421
I got it.

776
00:43:13,931 --> 00:43:16,566
Daddy, I'm glad you came.

777
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,936
Then why do you look so sad?

778
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:22,141
I'm not.
I'm just tired.

779
00:43:22,175 --> 00:43:24,576
It's been a busy week.

780
00:43:24,610 --> 00:43:27,578
Yes, you have
a big beans success.

781
00:43:27,612 --> 00:43:30,848
Don't make fun, papa.
I know you don't approve.

782
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:34,086
Is this your passion?

783
00:43:36,724 --> 00:43:39,959
Because you have changed.

784
00:43:39,994 --> 00:43:41,927
I always thought
you were very single-minded

785
00:43:41,961 --> 00:43:44,931
about your dreams and that that
would help you through life.

786
00:43:44,965 --> 00:43:48,034
But now I see that you
skipped the struggle

787
00:43:48,069 --> 00:43:50,336
and went right to the end.

788
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:53,273
It's not the end.
It's the beginning.

789
00:43:53,308 --> 00:43:56,876
This apartment, this wealth
that someone handed to you,

790
00:43:56,911 --> 00:43:59,279
this was what Karl Marx
was talking about.

791
00:43:59,314 --> 00:44:01,816
And it's not because
someone else deserves it,

792
00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:04,819
it's because it is
bad for your soul.

793
00:44:04,853 --> 00:44:06,722
Don't beat me
with your politics

794
00:44:06,756 --> 00:44:09,054
because you hate
that I love Don.

795
00:44:09,089 --> 00:44:12,092
No, I hate that you gave up.

796
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:15,395
Don't let your love
for this man

797
00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:17,532
stop you from doing
what you wanted to do.

798
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:55,438
- Excuse me.
<i>- I've been telling Ken</i>

799
00:44:55,473 --> 00:44:57,775
you should get out of
your business altogether.

800
00:44:57,809 --> 00:44:59,643
Why is that?

801
00:45:04,885 --> 00:45:06,549
I'd introduce you to him,

802
00:45:06,584 --> 00:45:08,619
but I don't want you
to waste your time.

803
00:45:08,654 --> 00:45:10,588
He's on the board.

804
00:45:10,622 --> 00:45:12,891
- He obviously likes my work.
- He loves your work.

805
00:45:12,925 --> 00:45:15,294
They all do.

806
00:45:15,328 --> 00:45:17,397
But they don't like you.

807
00:45:17,431 --> 00:45:19,864
- What?
- This crowd,

808
00:45:19,899 --> 00:45:22,434
they'll bury
your desk in awards,

809
00:45:22,468 --> 00:45:24,937
but they'll never
work with you,

810
00:45:24,971 --> 00:45:27,107
not after that letter.

811
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:28,908
I mean, how could
they trust you

812
00:45:28,942 --> 00:45:30,577
after the way you bit the hand?

813
00:45:34,415 --> 00:45:37,383
Oh, sorry about that.

814
00:45:37,418 --> 00:45:39,286
You want another?

815
00:45:42,692 --> 00:45:44,625
Yeah, sure.

816
00:45:44,659 --> 00:45:46,160
Two.

817
00:46:14,091 --> 00:46:16,826
- Excuse me, miss. Are you
finished with that? - Yes.

818
00:46:25,872 --> 00:46:28,439
<i>- Yeah?</i>
- Did I wake you?

819
00:46:28,474 --> 00:46:29,974
<i>Yeah, but it's okay.</i>

820
00:46:30,008 --> 00:46:32,142
I get a lot of attention
every time you call.

821
00:46:32,177 --> 00:46:34,478
People think
you're my girlfriend.

822
00:46:34,512 --> 00:46:36,681
I'm not.

823
00:46:36,715 --> 00:46:38,616
Why are you whispering?

824
00:46:38,650 --> 00:46:41,020
I'm in Manhattan at my dad's.

825
00:46:41,054 --> 00:46:43,087
Bluto broke her foot.

826
00:46:43,121 --> 00:46:45,190
Spectacular.

827
00:46:45,224 --> 00:46:47,260
Yeah.

828
00:46:47,294 --> 00:46:49,961
How's the city?

829
00:46:49,996 --> 00:46:52,598
Dirty.

830
