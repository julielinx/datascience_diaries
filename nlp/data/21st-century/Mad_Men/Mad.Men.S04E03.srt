1
00:00:00,573 --> 00:00:01,257
Don't.

00:00:01,433 --> 00:00:03,394
<i>Previously on
AMC's Mad Men...</i>

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:04,673
Don't what?

4
00:00:05,809 --> 00:00:06,875
This is the one.

5
00:00:07,129 --> 00:00:08,169
Who is she?

6
00:00:08,426 --> 00:00:09,986
She's the soul of the world.

7
00:00:10,706 --> 00:00:11,977
What does it mean?

8
00:00:12,162 --> 00:00:13,594
The only thing keeping
you from being happy

9
00:00:13,721 --> 00:00:15,451
is the belief that
you are alone.

10
00:00:18,331 --> 00:00:19,233
Do you miss London?

11
00:00:19,331 --> 00:00:20,042
God, yes.

12
00:00:20,498 --> 00:00:22,169
Stop telling what to do,
I know what you want.

13
00:00:22,283 --> 00:00:23,707
So do it.

14
00:00:25,505 --> 00:00:26,794
I joined the army, Joanie.

15
00:00:26,947 --> 00:00:28,323
You're gonna be taken care of

16
00:00:28,466 --> 00:00:30,089
and I'm gonna be a surgeon.

18
00:01:09,609 --> 00:01:12,446
Remind me...
when did you stop
taking the pills?

19
00:01:12,514 --> 00:01:14,149
They ran out on the 2nd.

20
00:01:14,217 --> 00:01:16,553
I'd say I would
expect to be fertile again
at the end of the cycle,

21
00:01:16,621 --> 00:01:18,690
Although from my experience
it's more likely a month.

22
00:01:18,757 --> 00:01:20,893
All this time
I've been afraid to skip one

23
00:01:20,961 --> 00:01:24,634
- But it could take a month?
- Why don't you join him
for basic training?

24
00:01:24,702 --> 00:01:26,405
It would boost
the men's morale.

25
00:01:28,108 --> 00:01:30,974
From what I remember,
San Antonio is lovely
this time of year.

26
00:01:31,042 --> 00:01:32,610
We don't know when he's going.

27
00:01:32,678 --> 00:01:34,913
You've been married
two years, Joan?

28
00:01:34,981 --> 00:01:36,549
Most gals your age don't wait.

29
00:01:38,019 --> 00:01:40,188
We have a plan.

30
00:01:42,024 --> 00:01:43,993
Jojo, I know it's none
of my business,

31
00:01:44,061 --> 00:01:46,731
But I only went to Korea
because they made me.

32
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,168
I didn't have
a choice or a wife.

33
00:01:49,236 --> 00:01:51,838
All I want to know is
if my husband and I
can start a family...

34
00:01:51,906 --> 00:01:53,574
<i>When my husband
and I can start a family.</i>

35
00:01:55,978 --> 00:01:57,012
Go get 'em.

36
00:01:59,216 --> 00:02:00,917
- Walter.
- Yes?

37
00:02:00,985 --> 00:02:02,586
I just want
to make sure that...

38
00:02:03,956 --> 00:02:05,890
You know I've had
a couple of procedures.

39
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:08,093
I just want to make sure
they don't affect anything.

40
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:11,130
A couple?
I only remember one.

41
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:13,234
There was one before that.

42
00:02:13,301 --> 00:02:14,569
Should I be worried?

43
00:02:16,839 --> 00:02:18,807
Was the other performed
by a physician?

44
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,811
She said she was a midwife.

45
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:24,915
Well, you got pregnant
subsequently,

46
00:02:24,983 --> 00:02:26,851
And I know everything
went fine here

47
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:28,520
And, physically,
everything looks fine.

48
00:02:30,524 --> 00:02:32,759
Like the song says,
"whatever will be will be."

49
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:35,195
Happy new year.

50
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:49,013
Good morning,
Mr. Draper.

51
00:02:49,081 --> 00:02:51,584
Good morning, Allison.

52
00:02:51,652 --> 00:02:54,220
- Coffee?
- Yes please.

53
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,602
Ah. I'm glad
I caught you
before you left.

54
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,671
The flight's
not until 12:30.

55
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:11,475
Well, still you've got
to fight the tourists
for a taxi,

56
00:03:11,542 --> 00:03:13,711
Then if you hit traffic...
Triborough bridge,

57
00:03:13,778 --> 00:03:16,447
Somebody's always
running out of gas
and I think you know who.

58
00:03:18,684 --> 00:03:22,921
So I saw on your way
to Acapulco you have
24 hours in Los Angeles.

59
00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:24,823
- What do you want?
- The brown derby,

60
00:03:24,891 --> 00:03:26,826
Bill asher...
he'll probably
try to cast you.

61
00:03:26,893 --> 00:03:28,962
- Morning, don, Harry.
- Hello.

62
00:03:29,029 --> 00:03:30,698
- Am I interrupting?
- No.

63
00:03:30,765 --> 00:03:33,301
I'll see you
at the traffic meeting
this afternoon.

64
00:03:33,369 --> 00:03:34,903
We're still
doing that? Why?

65
00:03:34,971 --> 00:03:36,939
Just go to England already.
Stop feeling guilty.

66
00:03:37,007 --> 00:03:38,642
Take two weeks...
you'll be twice as happy.

67
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:41,178
I'm happy when I'm working.

68
00:03:41,247 --> 00:03:43,248
I'm sure another day
and a half of work

69
00:03:43,316 --> 00:03:44,750
Will not come close
to the amount

70
00:03:44,818 --> 00:03:47,252
Of fiddling about you did
in Los Angeles this year.

71
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,553
Okay.
Happy new year, don.

72
00:03:53,257 --> 00:03:56,692
Oh, there you are.
Please make sure
he signs these.

73
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,762
If I don't see you,
happy new year.

74
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:01,196
Enjoy your family.

75
00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:04,533
Would you like
to sign these now?

76
00:04:04,601 --> 00:04:06,268
Might as well.

77
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:13,209
So what will you be doing?

78
00:04:13,277 --> 00:04:15,577
Don't worry.
I'll be here
till the bitter end.

79
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:19,010
No, I mean for new year's.

80
00:04:19,078 --> 00:04:22,177
I'm gonna go see
my sister in Patterson
over the weekend and...

81
00:04:22,245 --> 00:04:24,410
I don't know...
probably Times Square.

82
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:26,077
I always wondered who did that.

83
00:04:27,444 --> 00:04:29,111
It was a little
scary last year,

84
00:04:29,179 --> 00:04:31,814
But I think we'll
have a whole bunch
of girls this time.

85
00:04:31,881 --> 00:04:34,983
- And sailors.
- I'm sure.

86
00:04:35,051 --> 00:04:37,285
<i>- but for the rest
of the week,</i>

87
00:04:37,353 --> 00:04:40,287
If you want me
or someone else on your desk
for West coast hours,

88
00:04:40,354 --> 00:04:41,955
- I can arrange that.
- I'll be fine.

89
00:04:42,022 --> 00:04:44,423
Well, I'll let you know
when you should leave.

90
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:46,057
Thank you.

91
00:04:52,665 --> 00:04:54,866
- Why is the door shut?
- I don't like pipe smoke.

92
00:04:54,934 --> 00:04:57,135
- He's very considerate.
- Could you tell him I'm here?

93
00:04:57,203 --> 00:04:59,371
What is this regarding?

94
00:05:02,508 --> 00:05:04,875
Sorry to bother you,
but since Roger's not here,

95
00:05:04,943 --> 00:05:06,611
I am sending Caroline
uptown to get me

96
00:05:06,678 --> 00:05:08,980
Some fried chicken for lunch
and I know you like it.

97
00:05:09,048 --> 00:05:10,982
- Interested?
- I am.

98
00:05:11,049 --> 00:05:14,218
- Breast? Thigh?
- One of each.

99
00:05:15,687 --> 00:05:18,088
Oh, I wanted to ask you...

100
00:05:18,155 --> 00:05:19,956
I would like
to put in a request now

101
00:05:20,023 --> 00:05:21,890
For a few days off
the second week of January.

102
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:23,791
You have new year's off.

103
00:05:23,859 --> 00:05:26,760
My husband's a doctor.
His schedule's not flexible.

104
00:05:28,797 --> 00:05:30,999
Why don't you
go home and ask him
how he would feel

105
00:05:31,067 --> 00:05:33,601
About some nurse asking
for a holiday immediately
following a holiday?

106
00:05:35,137 --> 00:05:36,837
I would be happy with two days.

107
00:05:36,905 --> 00:05:39,873
Our financial planning
and expense budgets
for next year...

108
00:05:39,941 --> 00:05:42,009
- I'll need you
to assist me.
- We can do it now.

109
00:05:42,076 --> 00:05:43,543
No one knows why
we're here anyway.

110
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:46,512
Because there's work to do.

111
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,715
And I understand
that all men are dizzy
and powerless to refuse you,

112
00:05:49,783 --> 00:05:51,817
But consider me
the incorruptible exception.

113
00:05:51,885 --> 00:05:53,185
Fried chicken indeed.

114
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:57,022
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have asked.

115
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,290
Don't go and cry about it.

116
00:05:58,357 --> 00:05:59,691
Excuse me?

117
00:06:01,026 --> 00:06:03,327
I said don't go
and cry about it.

118
00:06:41,691 --> 00:06:42,891
Hey.

119
00:06:44,694 --> 00:06:48,162
- Get off my porch.
- You actually came.

120
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,135
- What the hell
happened to your leg?
- It's broken.

121
00:06:55,202 --> 00:06:57,103
It didn't work that well
to begin with.

122
00:07:00,774 --> 00:07:02,007
How are you?

123
00:07:04,043 --> 00:07:06,644
Aw. You just need
a little r&r.

124
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:15,986
What happened?

125
00:07:16,053 --> 00:07:17,587
Don't fry eggs in bare feet.

126
00:07:17,655 --> 00:07:19,989
Sit down.

127
00:07:20,057 --> 00:07:22,591
- What do you want?
- Half of what you have.

128
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:27,361
- You've got a leak.
- I fixed the roof.

129
00:07:27,429 --> 00:07:29,129
It just needs a little makeup.

130
00:07:29,197 --> 00:07:32,331
- Call a painter.
- I don't know.

131
00:07:32,398 --> 00:07:35,233
Once it stopped smelling,
I kind of forgot about it.

132
00:07:40,703 --> 00:07:42,770
I wondered whose car that was.

133
00:07:42,838 --> 00:07:44,705
- Hello, dick.
- Hello, patty.

134
00:07:44,773 --> 00:07:46,906
- It's been too long.
- Stephanie.

135
00:07:46,974 --> 00:07:48,775
Stephanie.

136
00:07:48,842 --> 00:07:50,542
Last time I saw you,
you didn't have front teeth.

137
00:07:52,111 --> 00:07:54,178
They're helping me while
I'm in my fragile state,

138
00:07:54,246 --> 00:07:55,846
Although no one asked them too.

139
00:07:55,913 --> 00:07:59,181
- Can I get you something?
- No, we live in South Pasadena.

140
00:07:59,249 --> 00:08:01,482
It's a long drive.
Are you staying?

141
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,784
- Just for the night.
- Here?

142
00:08:03,851 --> 00:08:07,219
Patty, remember you
told me to tell you
if you were intruding?

143
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:09,720
Try to keep her off her feet.

144
00:08:09,788 --> 00:08:12,423
The cast isn't stable
and we don't need
any more accidents.

145
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:15,994
Aunt Anna, I just left
everything on the bed.

146
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:17,431
I don't know where things go.

147
00:08:17,499 --> 00:08:18,867
You can tell by looking.

148
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:28,515
She's never gotten over
me flunking home-EC.

149
00:08:28,582 --> 00:08:30,249
dick, fix her a drink.

150
00:08:30,317 --> 00:08:33,385
- Are you drinking age?
- Yes, but don't bother.

151
00:08:33,453 --> 00:08:35,621
Stephanie is studying
poly-sci at cal.

152
00:08:35,688 --> 00:08:37,256
She should be studying music.

153
00:08:37,324 --> 00:08:40,826
Berkeley?
Are you sitting in?

154
00:08:40,894 --> 00:08:43,095
I agree with what
they're doing,

155
00:08:43,162 --> 00:08:46,031
But somebody's
gotta go to class.

156
00:08:48,066 --> 00:08:50,734
- Steph, are you ready?
- Why don't you two
stay for dinner?

157
00:08:50,802 --> 00:08:52,802
Glenn and I have
a bridge game
at the Dickson's

158
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,637
And he's expecting
a dinner of his own.

159
00:08:54,705 --> 00:08:56,239
Good, 'cause I only
want her her to stay.

160
00:08:56,306 --> 00:08:59,472
- How will she get home?
- I have a car.

161
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,572
Or she'll spend the night.
You can get her
in the morning.

162
00:09:04,575 --> 00:09:07,810
Okay, you figure it out.
Good night, sweetheart.

163
00:09:09,612 --> 00:09:12,246
You know I'm very grateful.

164
00:09:12,314 --> 00:09:14,748
If I don't see you,
dick, happy new year.

165
00:09:14,816 --> 00:09:15,983
Happy new year.

166
00:09:20,788 --> 00:09:22,889
I'm going to wash
the road off me,

167
00:09:22,957 --> 00:09:25,425
And then we are
going to that place
with the beer and abalone.

168
00:09:25,493 --> 00:09:27,627
Perfect.
Sounds like there's
towels all over the bed.

169
00:09:30,331 --> 00:09:32,865
- Why am I staying?
- I wanted him to meet you

170
00:09:32,933 --> 00:09:34,833
And I know you've got grass.

171
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:41,770
Hello.

172
00:09:41,838 --> 00:09:45,139
Ah. Come over here.

173
00:09:46,775 --> 00:09:49,177
- Is that your dinner?
- I love your chicken.

174
00:09:51,813 --> 00:09:54,981
- How was the doctor?
- Everything's good.

175
00:09:55,049 --> 00:09:58,185
Good.
I have to go.

176
00:09:58,252 --> 00:10:00,153
Let me at least heat it up.

177
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,687
You can take it with you.

178
00:10:03,723 --> 00:10:06,090
Peabody's offered
his place in the Poconos
for the 14th and 15th.

179
00:10:06,157 --> 00:10:08,824
Greg, I can't
get away, not then.

180
00:10:08,891 --> 00:10:10,692
Joanie, I have
to work new year's.

181
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:12,360
I had to trade it for January.

182
00:10:12,428 --> 00:10:14,462
Then get one of
the Jewish docs to do it.

183
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,630
- You worked
on their holiday.
- Joanie...

184
00:10:16,698 --> 00:10:19,400
You don't think
I'd rather be smelling
perfume than Lysol?

185
00:10:19,467 --> 00:10:20,901
Tell me what you want me to do.

186
00:10:20,969 --> 00:10:22,870
I guess it's not
your problem too.

187
00:10:25,107 --> 00:10:27,340
Why don't you just not show up?

188
00:10:27,408 --> 00:10:29,709
- I'll lose my job.
- We'll make it.

189
00:10:29,776 --> 00:10:32,210
- Until when?
- Until I leave for basic,

190
00:10:32,278 --> 00:10:34,413
And then it's just
a couple of weeks
and then I'll be home.

191
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,582
And then you're
going to Vietnam.

192
00:10:36,649 --> 00:10:39,718
- We don't know that.
- Oh, that makes me
feel better.

193
00:10:39,786 --> 00:10:41,886
Just keep marking off
the days on the calendar

194
00:10:41,954 --> 00:10:43,921
While keep planning
for our future.

195
00:10:43,989 --> 00:10:46,356
I'll see you tomorrow
when you're on your way out.

196
00:10:50,327 --> 00:10:52,895
- You don't even know
when you're going!
- Soon.

197
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:59,767
<i>- so I'd say Laura was
the worst roommate.</i>

198
00:10:59,835 --> 00:11:02,736
She had a nervous breakdown.

199
00:11:02,804 --> 00:11:05,972
One morning she's
reading the bible

200
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,507
<i>Instead
of her psych book.</i>

201
00:11:07,575 --> 00:11:09,975
The next morning
she woke me up,

202
00:11:10,043 --> 00:11:12,877
Leaning over me
with this crazy smile,

203
00:11:12,945 --> 00:11:15,446
And said, "morning, Stephanie.

204
00:11:15,514 --> 00:11:17,148
Have you heard
the good news?"

205
00:11:17,215 --> 00:11:18,982
There are worse things.

206
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:21,518
No, there aren't.

207
00:11:21,585 --> 00:11:24,253
Where did you go
to school, dick?

208
00:11:24,321 --> 00:11:25,888
<i>♪ when you first try

209
00:11:25,956 --> 00:11:29,191

00:11:29,258 --> 00:11:31,693
In night school, city college.

211
00:11:31,761 --> 00:11:34,095
A self-made man.

212
00:11:34,163 --> 00:11:38,232
What's it like
taking off your suit
and returning to the wild?

213
00:11:38,299 --> 00:11:40,734
I really don't
like how political
you're getting.

214
00:11:40,802 --> 00:11:42,502
I'm not political.

215
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:45,338
I just don't understand
who's in charge.

216
00:11:45,406 --> 00:11:47,374
You're in charge.

217
00:11:47,441 --> 00:11:49,342
Trust me.
I work in advertising.

218
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:52,444
You're kidding me.
It's pollution.

219
00:11:52,512 --> 00:11:54,279
So stop buying things.

220
00:11:55,647 --> 00:11:57,815
Don't think
that's not possible.

221
00:12:01,018 --> 00:12:03,319
I'll say this in terms

222
00:12:03,387 --> 00:12:05,722
I will be right back

223
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:07,557

243
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:57,859

no surfing at all.

I hate it.

00:15:18,321 --> 00:15:19,821
I do it all the time.

288
00:15:19,889 --> 00:15:21,356
You'll get picked up

00:15:23,059 --> 00:15:24,626
I guess this is safer.

290
00:15:32,728 --> 00:15:35,695
So are you married or divorced?

291
00:15:36,964 --> 00:15:38,564
Couldn't I just be single?

292
00:15:38,631 --> 00:15:40,899
no.

293
00:15:40,967 --> 00:15:43,668
I mean I'd be surprised.

294
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,603
I'm divorced.

295
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:50,974
Do you go on those dates
where you sit there

296
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:53,842
And ask each other questions?

297
00:15:56,712 --> 00:15:58,746
It's a means to an end.

298
00:15:58,814 --> 00:16:00,647
But nobody knows

299
00:16:00,715 --> 00:16:02,015
What's wrong with themselves...

300
00:16:03,684 --> 00:16:07,920
And everyone else
can see it right away.

301
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:21,773
thank you very much.

302
00:16:21,841 --> 00:16:23,710
It was my pleasure.

303
00:16:23,777 --> 00:16:26,012
So what time's
your flight tomorrow?

304
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,280
Noon.

305
00:16:28,348 --> 00:16:30,682
Unless you think
I should change it.

306
00:16:35,921 --> 00:16:37,254
What are you doing?

307
00:16:38,523 --> 00:16:40,356
I don't know.

308
00:16:42,326 --> 00:16:45,327
You're so beautiful and young.

309
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,634
Anna and I never had

310
00:16:54,702 --> 00:16:56,703
A romantic relationship.

311
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:58,337
But you love her.

312
00:16:59,806 --> 00:17:01,672
For lots of reasons...

313
00:17:04,608 --> 00:17:06,575
And in a very different way.

314
00:17:08,744 --> 00:17:10,444
I have to tell you something

315
00:17:10,511 --> 00:17:13,513
And I probably shouldn't.

316
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:15,714
I promised...

317
00:17:17,383 --> 00:17:18,717
I wouldn't,

318
00:17:18,785 --> 00:17:22,687
But I see you two together

319
00:17:22,755 --> 00:17:24,789
And I know I have to.

320
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:27,723
Okay.

321
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:30,058
Anna is...

322
00:17:32,894 --> 00:17:34,861
She has cancer.

323
00:17:39,365 --> 00:17:43,001
- What?
- It's why
she broke her leg.

324
00:17:43,069 --> 00:17:46,171
It's in her bones.
It's all over her body.

325
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,740
I'm sorry.

326
00:17:52,178 --> 00:17:56,350
Cancer. Shit.

327
00:17:56,418 --> 00:17:58,218
I'm so sorry.

328
00:17:59,987 --> 00:18:01,821
Of course she's not
gonna say a damn thing.

329
00:18:02,989 --> 00:18:04,723
She doesn't know.

330
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:08,995
- What?
- The doctors said

331
00:18:09,063 --> 00:18:12,432
She doesn't have long,
so there's no reason
to tell her.

332
00:18:12,499 --> 00:18:16,202
Some quacks out in Pedro?
What are you going
to do about it?

333
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:18,604
My mom got a consultation.

334
00:18:18,672 --> 00:18:21,139
Your mother does not
get to decide that.

335
00:18:21,207 --> 00:18:24,408
Please don't make me sorry
that I told you.

336
00:18:27,712 --> 00:18:29,746
I didn't want you to leave here

337
00:18:29,814 --> 00:18:31,547
And not know.

338
00:20:34,682 --> 00:20:36,116
Good morning.

339
00:20:36,183 --> 00:20:37,650
I woke up in a panic

340
00:20:37,719 --> 00:20:39,719
Because I thought
I might've missed you.

341
00:20:39,787 --> 00:20:42,389
But it doesn't look
like you're ready to go.

342
00:20:42,456 --> 00:20:44,991
I thought I'd stay
a little longer
if it's okay.

343
00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:47,293
Hell yes.
Stay as long
as you want.

344
00:20:47,361 --> 00:20:49,461
We'll see.

345
00:20:50,796 --> 00:20:52,962
If I had rolled over on this,

346
00:20:53,029 --> 00:20:55,395
I would've had
to smoke the dress.

347
00:21:05,935 --> 00:21:07,903
How'd you sleep?

348
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:12,173
I was feeling no pain,
as they say.

349
00:21:12,241 --> 00:21:14,308
In fact, I don't know
if I would've woken up

350
00:21:14,376 --> 00:21:16,210
If I hadn't heard
that jet fly by.

351
00:21:16,278 --> 00:21:18,378
And I thought, "oh my god.
Dick left already."

352
00:21:21,415 --> 00:21:23,716
There's all kinds
of aircraft here, you know.

353
00:21:23,784 --> 00:21:26,552
If we stay up tonight
and we get lucky,

354
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:29,021
We'll see something
you'll remember.

355
00:21:29,089 --> 00:21:31,790
if we keep smoking that.

356
00:21:34,227 --> 00:21:36,328
I've seen u.F.O.S.

357
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:38,796
There was a lot going on
during the missile scare,

358
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:40,665
But it was different.

359
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:42,800
You saw a u.F.O.?

360
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:45,568
Mm-hmm. You don't have
to do that, you know.

361
00:21:45,636 --> 00:21:48,204
I want to.

362
00:21:48,272 --> 00:21:50,573
I'm not gonna fight
watching dick Whitman

363
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,541
Paint my living room
in his shorts.

364
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,081
I'm so damn proud of you.

365
00:22:01,384 --> 00:22:03,017
I count on that.

366
00:22:04,286 --> 00:22:08,588
Does that scare you?

367
00:22:08,656 --> 00:22:10,923
The idea
of another civilization
on another planet

368
00:22:10,991 --> 00:22:12,691
Smart enough to find
a way to get here?

369
00:22:12,759 --> 00:22:14,259
It doesn't scare me,

370
00:22:15,628 --> 00:22:17,228
But the odds are against it.

371
00:22:17,295 --> 00:22:19,363
<i>Well, I saw
something once</i>

372
00:22:19,431 --> 00:22:21,832
And I'm telling you
it knocked me sideways.

373
00:22:23,734 --> 00:22:26,035
I started thinking
of everything I was
sure was true

374
00:22:28,071 --> 00:22:30,673
And how flimsy it all might be.

375
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,975
You don't need to see
a u.F.O. To know that.

376
00:22:34,677 --> 00:22:36,677
That's not a great way
to think about things.

377
00:22:46,252 --> 00:22:48,486
<i>I know everything
about you</i>

378
00:22:48,554 --> 00:22:51,155
And I still love you.

379
00:22:55,092 --> 00:22:57,160
Are you just gonna
paint that corner?

380
00:22:57,227 --> 00:22:59,461
'cause a patch
of new paint is just
as bad as a stain.

381
00:23:07,168 --> 00:23:09,636
<i>What the hell
is going on?</i>

382
00:23:09,704 --> 00:23:12,471
- You're gonna get arrested.
- No, you are.

383
00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:14,907
- That's breaking and entering.
- I thought you had
a flight to catch.

384
00:23:14,975 --> 00:23:16,775
I changed my plans.

385
00:23:16,843 --> 00:23:19,845
You just can't keep
your pants on, can you?

386
00:23:25,618 --> 00:23:28,319
You never know what's
gonna set her off.

387
00:23:33,992 --> 00:23:36,794
- I need to talk to you.
- I bet.

388
00:23:36,861 --> 00:23:38,262
I heard you car
pull up at 2:30.

389
00:23:38,329 --> 00:23:41,297
- She's half your age.
- What's your plan?

390
00:23:41,365 --> 00:23:44,666
Just gonna let her
wake up one day in agony
and you tell her it's over?

391
00:23:47,703 --> 00:23:50,538
<i>I'm going to assume
that you've done everything</i>

392
00:23:50,606 --> 00:23:52,840
In your limited means,
but I'm here now.

393
00:23:52,908 --> 00:23:54,575
She's gonna see
some real doctors

394
00:23:54,643 --> 00:23:56,310
And she's not gonna
live in the dark.

395
00:23:56,378 --> 00:23:59,279
We showed the x-rays
to specialists... everybody.

396
00:24:00,682 --> 00:24:03,249
- It's very advanced.
- Specialists?

397
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:05,885
- You don't think she knows
something's going on?
- She had polio.

398
00:24:05,953 --> 00:24:07,586
She's been going to doctors
since she was eight.

399
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:09,721
Maybe... I don't know.

400
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:14,124
She hasn't let on,
so this is the way
it's gonna be.

401
00:24:14,192 --> 00:24:16,860
I understand
you feel guilty,
but don't.

402
00:24:16,927 --> 00:24:19,162
Go to Acapulco.
There's nothing
for you to do here.

403
00:24:19,229 --> 00:24:21,497
<i>She is very
important to me.</i>

404
00:24:21,565 --> 00:24:23,599
I'm gonna do what I have to.

405
00:24:23,667 --> 00:24:26,334
You have no say
in the affairs
of this family.

406
00:24:27,769 --> 00:24:29,369
You're just a man in a room

407
00:24:29,437 --> 00:24:31,104
With a checkbook.
I'm sorry.

408
00:24:42,048 --> 00:24:43,848
Please do the decent thing.

409
00:24:45,017 --> 00:24:46,351
The longer you're here,

410
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:47,953
The more likely you are
to say something.

411
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:02,309
She thinks you brought
the pot, I bet.

412
00:25:02,377 --> 00:25:04,144
If it wasn't for my niece,

413
00:25:04,212 --> 00:25:06,247
We'd have killed
each other by now.

414
00:25:07,949 --> 00:25:10,051
She means well
and she's family.

415
00:25:10,118 --> 00:25:11,719
I wouldn't have picked her.

416
00:25:12,888 --> 00:25:14,723
I'm just saying

417
00:25:16,258 --> 00:25:18,260
Not everybody has that.

418
00:25:19,595 --> 00:25:21,230
You have your kids.

419
00:25:21,297 --> 00:25:22,865
I bet that's better.

420
00:25:22,932 --> 00:25:24,933
It's different.

421
00:25:32,941 --> 00:25:35,609
I have to tell you something.

422
00:25:35,676 --> 00:25:37,344
What's wrong?

423
00:25:46,486 --> 00:25:48,119
I have to go.

424
00:25:50,756 --> 00:25:52,557
I'm sorry.

425
00:25:57,462 --> 00:26:00,063
I... I thought
I could stay,
but I can't.

426
00:26:00,131 --> 00:26:01,898
Oh, I don't care.

427
00:26:01,966 --> 00:26:04,001
I want you to.

428
00:26:04,068 --> 00:26:06,703
I want you
to do everything
you want to do.

429
00:26:08,873 --> 00:26:10,607
I'll bring the kids
out at Easter.

430
00:26:10,675 --> 00:26:13,443
We'll go to Catalina,
see the bison.

431
00:26:22,685 --> 00:26:24,152
Acapulco.

432
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,253
Do you think
there's more Mexicans
here or there?

433
00:26:34,076 --> 00:26:35,710
<i>Joan.</i>

434
00:26:35,778 --> 00:26:37,278
Open it.

435
00:26:46,953 --> 00:26:48,053
They're beautiful.

436
00:26:50,256 --> 00:26:53,592
It's so encouraging
to see someone happily
married around here.

437
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,694
Peggy, why don't you go home?

438
00:26:55,762 --> 00:26:58,029
- I'll tell everyone you have
something important to do.
- Really?

439
00:26:58,096 --> 00:26:59,396
- I have to buy a dress.
- Oh.

440
00:26:59,464 --> 00:27:01,198
New year's eve,
big group of girls,

441
00:27:01,266 --> 00:27:04,167
- You'll want to stand out.
- No, I'm spending it with mark.

442
00:27:04,234 --> 00:27:06,535
My boyfriend?

443
00:27:06,603 --> 00:27:07,969
happy new year.

444
00:27:10,505 --> 00:27:11,672
Excuse me.

445
00:27:12,942 --> 00:27:14,275
"darling, I've been an ass.

446
00:27:14,343 --> 00:27:16,011
- Kisses, lane"?
- What?

447
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:18,449
I am not your darling
and I don't want your kisses.

448
00:27:18,517 --> 00:27:20,686
- What?
- I thought American men
were bad enough,

449
00:27:20,754 --> 00:27:22,922
But none of them has
ever so consistently

450
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:24,857
Made me feel
like a helpless,
stupid little girl.

451
00:27:24,925 --> 00:27:27,192
Calm down.
I did send you flowers,

452
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:29,794
But I also sent flowers
to my wife in London.

453
00:27:29,861 --> 00:27:32,162
The sentiments
were very different,
I assure you. Sandy!

454
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,634
Um, is everything okay?

455
00:27:37,701 --> 00:27:39,135
- Yes.
- Just get back to work.

456
00:27:39,203 --> 00:27:40,369
Sandy!

457
00:27:42,672 --> 00:27:45,539
Did it ever occur
to you how sensitive
these deliveries were?

458
00:27:45,607 --> 00:27:47,541
How often do I send flowers?

459
00:27:47,608 --> 00:27:50,276
I ordered the flowers
from Rhinelander's.

460
00:27:50,344 --> 00:27:53,779
They assured me
they were going to contact
your florist in London,

461
00:27:53,847 --> 00:27:56,381
And somehow
they mixed them up.
It's not my fault.

462
00:27:56,449 --> 00:27:58,750
Sandra,
everyone makes mistakes,

463
00:27:58,817 --> 00:28:01,385
But the fact that you're
the kind of person who cannot
accept blame is egregious.

464
00:28:04,388 --> 00:28:06,121
I don't know what that means.

465
00:28:06,189 --> 00:28:08,087
It means I can't believe
I hired you.

466
00:28:08,155 --> 00:28:10,792
<i>You had one simple task.</i>

467
00:28:10,859 --> 00:28:13,761
I don't even know
if I can call to apologize.

468
00:28:13,829 --> 00:28:15,863
What exactly did
Mrs. Harris's note say?

469
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:20,133
It said, "Joan,
forgive me. Lane."

470
00:28:22,369 --> 00:28:24,070
You're fired.
Go get your things.

471
00:28:24,137 --> 00:28:25,604
You'll be paid through
the end of the year.

472
00:28:28,107 --> 00:28:29,974
Those instructions
you understood!

473
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,244
I'll have Megan clean this up.

474
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:42,651
- What are you doing?
- You inspired me.

475
00:28:44,053 --> 00:28:45,320
Would you like
to sign your work?

476
00:28:46,856 --> 00:28:48,756
- Really?
- Pick a spot on the wall.

477
00:28:57,131 --> 00:28:59,199
You should swim as much
as you can there.

478
00:28:59,266 --> 00:29:01,200
It'll clear your head.

479
00:29:01,268 --> 00:29:02,868
And no cliff diving.

480
00:29:21,289 --> 00:29:24,491
Hey.
You'll be fine.

481
00:29:26,294 --> 00:29:28,128
You'll make the best of it.

482
00:29:28,195 --> 00:29:29,495
You always do.

483
00:29:32,899 --> 00:29:35,467
You know you can call me
if you need anything.

484
00:29:45,678 --> 00:29:47,845
- Goodbye, Anna.
- Goodbye, dick.

485
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,154
<i>Mr. Draper?</i>

486
00:29:56,221 --> 00:29:57,955
Mr. Draper?

487
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:03,393
Happy new year.

488
00:30:04,562 --> 00:30:06,062
Happy new year.

489
00:30:15,036 --> 00:30:18,272
hey, what are you doing up?

490
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:20,374
I figured since
we missed it here,

491
00:30:20,441 --> 00:30:22,376
We could celebrate it
in Hawaii.

492
00:30:25,246 --> 00:30:27,680
Oh, look at that.

493
00:30:27,748 --> 00:30:31,683
I'm sorry.
I ate dinner at 3:00.

494
00:30:31,751 --> 00:30:34,185
A bowl of cottage cheese
in the cafeteria?

495
00:30:36,821 --> 00:30:39,756
How about a glass
of fresh-squeezed
orange juice?

496
00:30:39,824 --> 00:30:43,261
Sure. The nurses
spent five minutes

497
00:30:43,329 --> 00:30:45,530
Trying to get this girl's
contact lenses out.

498
00:30:45,598 --> 00:30:47,999
She was screaming.
It turns out

499
00:30:48,067 --> 00:30:50,201
Her friend was the one
with the contact lenses.

500
00:30:50,269 --> 00:30:52,135
Oh! God!

501
00:30:53,471 --> 00:30:55,038
Oh God.

502
00:30:55,106 --> 00:30:56,973
- Let me see.
- I cut it really bad, Greg.

503
00:30:57,041 --> 00:30:57,941
- It really hurts.
- Jesus.

504
00:31:01,511 --> 00:31:03,878
Hold this.

505
00:31:05,714 --> 00:31:07,346
Just take me to the hospital.

506
00:31:07,414 --> 00:31:08,878
Sit down.

507
00:31:15,681 --> 00:31:18,649
- Greg, you don't
have to do this.
- Would you stop?

508
00:31:22,787 --> 00:31:24,754
Isn't there some
medical ethical law

509
00:31:24,822 --> 00:31:27,089
- Against operating
on your wife?

510
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:39,066
I want you to calm down.

511
00:31:39,134 --> 00:31:43,469
For me, this is like...

512
00:31:43,537 --> 00:31:46,839
I don't know...
filing some papers
is for you.

513
00:31:46,907 --> 00:31:48,173
I do it all the time.

514
00:31:48,241 --> 00:31:50,409
I don't do that anymore.
I have other people do that.

515
00:31:50,476 --> 00:31:52,744
It's really throbbing.
Let me get my coat.

516
00:31:52,812 --> 00:31:56,380
Hey, since when have
we had that bird's
nest on the ceiling?

517
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:00,884
I usually save that for kids.

518
00:32:03,787 --> 00:32:05,488
Now don't move.

519
00:32:08,194 --> 00:32:10,728
One hillbilly says
to the other,

520
00:32:10,796 --> 00:32:13,597
"you wanna play
20 questions?"

521
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:18,001
The other hillbilly says,
"what is that?"

522
00:32:18,068 --> 00:32:20,903
He says, "I write something

523
00:32:20,971 --> 00:32:22,972
On a piece of paper,

524
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:26,174
"And you get 20 questions
to guess what it be."

525
00:32:27,777 --> 00:32:29,511
So he takes out
a piece of paper

526
00:32:29,578 --> 00:32:31,346
And writes "donkey damn" on it.

527
00:32:31,413 --> 00:32:35,416
The other hillbilly takes
a second to think and asks,

528
00:32:35,483 --> 00:32:37,384
"can you eat it?"

529
00:32:38,852 --> 00:32:40,620
The other hillbilly says,

530
00:32:40,688 --> 00:32:42,221
"I might reckon
you could."

531
00:32:42,289 --> 00:32:45,357
The other one says,

532
00:32:45,424 --> 00:32:47,225
"is it donkey damn?"

533
00:32:50,562 --> 00:32:52,463
Cohen told me that.

534
00:32:57,401 --> 00:33:00,370
Aw, come on. It's fine.

535
00:33:01,705 --> 00:33:03,838
I'm not crying 'cause it hurts.

536
00:33:03,906 --> 00:33:05,940
Everything's gonna be okay.

537
00:33:06,007 --> 00:33:07,808
When?

538
00:33:11,312 --> 00:33:12,845
Joanie.

539
00:33:20,852 --> 00:33:23,786
I can't fix anything else,

540
00:33:25,055 --> 00:33:26,856
But I can fix this.

541
00:33:44,171 --> 00:33:46,072
Hello?

542
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,640
<i>Hello?</i>

543
00:33:50,543 --> 00:33:52,776
I thought you were in Acapulco.

544
00:33:54,946 --> 00:33:56,714
I didn't feel like it.

545
00:33:56,782 --> 00:33:58,649
You should be in England
with your family.

546
00:33:58,717 --> 00:34:00,885
Oh, too much to do.

547
00:34:00,953 --> 00:34:02,453
They'll be back soon enough.

548
00:34:02,521 --> 00:34:04,822
I have a sandwich
in the refrigerator.

549
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:06,257
It's very large.

550
00:34:06,324 --> 00:34:07,825
No thank you.

551
00:34:09,628 --> 00:34:11,194
- Do you mind?
- Help yourself.

552
00:34:18,369 --> 00:34:22,004
<i>- I received something</i>

553
00:34:22,071 --> 00:34:25,907
Rather special
from my father
for my birthday.

554
00:34:25,975 --> 00:34:28,042
- What is it?
- Who knows?

555
00:34:30,045 --> 00:34:31,946
He's one of those alcoholics

556
00:34:32,013 --> 00:34:33,547
Who thinks
that he's collecting.

557
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:39,051
Chin-chin.

558
00:34:45,121 --> 00:34:47,355
- There's no...
- no bite at all.

559
00:34:50,592 --> 00:34:52,126
<i>- well...</i>

560
00:34:55,362 --> 00:34:57,029
<i>- ...I will let you get back
to your business.</i>

561
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,302
- Ah.
- I made a discovery

562
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:07,175
As I slowly pulled back
from the records.

563
00:35:07,243 --> 00:35:10,115
I can't take
any more bad news, lane.

564
00:35:12,352 --> 00:35:15,153
Although things are
precarious financially,

565
00:35:17,956 --> 00:35:20,123
It's been a magnificent year.

566
00:35:30,398 --> 00:35:31,632
<i>lane!</i>

567
00:35:33,834 --> 00:35:35,467
what?

568
00:35:35,535 --> 00:35:37,068
<i>Come here.</i>

569
00:35:43,408 --> 00:35:45,209
We're going to the movies.

570
00:35:46,912 --> 00:35:48,647
Do you think we should?

571
00:35:48,714 --> 00:35:50,682
Does howdy doody
have a wooden dick?

572
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:55,353
"Zorba the Greek"...
seen it, but would
see it again.

573
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,722
"it's a mad mad mad world."

574
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:00,223
No kidding.

575
00:36:02,226 --> 00:36:04,327
- "send me no flowers."
- no.

576
00:36:06,429 --> 00:36:07,929
<i>"the guns of August."</i>

577
00:36:07,997 --> 00:36:10,831
I hate guns and I hate August.

578
00:36:13,734 --> 00:36:15,601
It's all over the rug.

579
00:36:15,669 --> 00:36:17,669
We'll have to smoke the dress.

580
00:36:17,737 --> 00:36:20,405
I don't know that one.

581
00:36:22,174 --> 00:36:24,041
"the umbrellas
of Cherbourg."

582
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:28,377
Catherine Deneuve.

583
00:36:28,445 --> 00:36:31,512
Apparently it's for
all the young lovers
of the world.

584
00:36:38,352 --> 00:36:40,953
This movie is very good.

585
00:36:44,891 --> 00:36:46,758
You know what's
going on here, don't you?

586
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:51,595
- Handjobs.
- Is that right?

587
00:36:53,764 --> 00:36:55,631
What percentage do you think?

588
00:36:55,699 --> 00:36:57,232
Do you mind?

589
00:37:00,268 --> 00:37:02,435
Monster!

590
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,709
You like it here.

591
00:37:06,777 --> 00:37:09,377
I do. I do.

592
00:37:09,444 --> 00:37:11,411
Even alone.

593
00:37:13,816 --> 00:37:16,417
You remind me of a chap
I knew in school.

594
00:37:17,752 --> 00:37:19,888
We followed him around
in a pack

595
00:37:19,956 --> 00:37:22,190
And he didn't notice
we were there.

596
00:37:24,593 --> 00:37:26,794
He died in a motorcycle crash.

597
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:32,332
Mmm.
Rebecca convinced me

598
00:37:32,399 --> 00:37:34,367
That you were all
on holiday together...

599
00:37:34,434 --> 00:37:36,635
Without me.

600
00:37:37,937 --> 00:37:40,371
I suppose we haven't
been very welcoming.

601
00:37:40,439 --> 00:37:42,206
Campbell's friendly,

602
00:37:42,274 --> 00:37:45,342
Although I believe
unintentionally.

603
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:49,645
But my wife is
quite severe with people,

604
00:37:49,713 --> 00:37:51,180
Including me.

605
00:37:53,116 --> 00:37:54,482
I'm sorry to hear that.

606
00:37:56,651 --> 00:37:58,152
I, um...

607
00:37:59,621 --> 00:38:01,321
I wanted to bring our families

608
00:38:01,389 --> 00:38:03,790
To New York for the holidays,

609
00:38:03,858 --> 00:38:06,225
But she was terribly homesick.

610
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,628
We had an argument...

611
00:38:09,695 --> 00:38:11,729
A series of arguments...

612
00:38:11,797 --> 00:38:14,531
And she left.

613
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:17,933
I then weakened
and sent her flowers.

614
00:38:18,001 --> 00:38:20,135
Huh.
Tried to, anyway.

615
00:38:22,003 --> 00:38:24,037
Then we had a rather
solemn phone call

616
00:38:24,105 --> 00:38:28,039
In which she told me
she was not returning.

617
00:38:31,909 --> 00:38:34,276
Then she put
my son on the phone.

618
00:38:37,612 --> 00:38:39,079
That's tough.

619
00:38:41,148 --> 00:38:43,583
How did you know
when you were done?

620
00:38:45,752 --> 00:38:47,687
It wasn't my decision.

621
00:38:50,057 --> 00:38:51,526
And I've learned the hard way

622
00:38:51,593 --> 00:38:54,097
Not to give advice
in these situations.

623
00:38:55,902 --> 00:38:58,337
You were
supposed to tell me
to get on a plane.

624
00:39:00,073 --> 00:39:02,107
Is that what you want?

625
00:39:02,174 --> 00:39:04,542
Or is that what
people expect of you?

626
00:39:07,379 --> 00:39:09,713
I want my beef.

627
00:39:09,781 --> 00:39:12,182
Ah. Here it is.

628
00:39:20,324 --> 00:39:23,526
I, uh,

629
00:39:23,594 --> 00:39:25,827
Was going to call
a lady friend of mine.

630
00:39:25,895 --> 00:39:27,361
I'm supposed
to meet her downtown.

631
00:39:28,963 --> 00:39:32,164
Do you want her
to bring a friend?

632
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,101
Oh, no no.
No thank you.

633
00:39:36,169 --> 00:39:37,635
What are you gonna do?

634
00:39:39,338 --> 00:39:41,172
We can pretend it's new year's.

635
00:39:41,239 --> 00:39:43,440
It actually is.

636
00:39:52,182 --> 00:39:54,082
If you don't mind.

637
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:55,684
It's the least I can do.

638
00:40:03,258 --> 00:40:06,894
- I'm not hungry.
- What? Not hungry

639
00:40:06,962 --> 00:40:08,829
For this...

640
00:40:08,897 --> 00:40:11,565
- Beautiful piece
of American meat?

641
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:19,539
I got a big Texas belt buckle!

642
00:40:19,606 --> 00:40:22,707
<i>- Yeehaw!

643
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:27,912
I'm thinking,
"did my mother get suspicious
and call the fuzz?"

644
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:30,414
"we know you're
practicing self-abuse.

645
00:40:30,482 --> 00:40:32,349
Please come out
with your hand up."

646
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:40,055
Aw. I see we have
an anniversary
here tonight.

647
00:40:42,859 --> 00:40:45,160
Look at these two...
George and Martha.

648
00:40:47,529 --> 00:40:50,598
Tell me, what's it like
when your eyes meet across
a crowded men's room?

649
00:40:53,301 --> 00:40:55,903
Wall street,
does it bother your parents
that he's so ugly?

650
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:01,241
At the end of the night

651
00:41:01,309 --> 00:41:03,744
When it's just
the two of you,
who picks up the check?

652
00:41:03,811 --> 00:41:07,914
We're not homosexuals!
We're divorced!

653
00:41:07,982 --> 00:41:09,783
don't.

654
00:41:09,851 --> 00:41:13,287
Oh man. Now they're
gonna fight in the car
all the way home.

655
00:41:13,355 --> 00:41:15,556
"honey, why'd you provoke
the comedian?"

656
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:20,928
Okay, now welcome
a talented young musician

657
00:41:20,995 --> 00:41:23,630
Whose mother says
he's the next Bob Dylan.

658
00:41:25,499 --> 00:41:27,967
Yeah.

659
00:41:32,339 --> 00:41:34,440
Candice, this is lane.

660
00:41:34,508 --> 00:41:35,842
And this is my friend Janine.

661
00:41:35,909 --> 00:41:37,076
- Hello.
- A pleasure.

662
00:41:37,144 --> 00:41:39,245
I guess I was wrong.
You're not queers.

663
00:41:39,313 --> 00:41:41,781
You're rich.

664
00:41:41,848 --> 00:41:43,449
<i>A warm welcome
for Rudy Jenson.</i>

665
00:41:52,726 --> 00:41:54,794
- You ladies look lovely.
- Why thank you.

666
00:41:54,862 --> 00:41:56,696
It's true.

667
00:41:58,632 --> 00:41:59,932
I love this song.

668
00:41:59,999 --> 00:42:01,800
Really?
He wrote it.

669
00:42:01,868 --> 00:42:03,568
Don't.
She'll believe anything.

670
00:42:03,636 --> 00:42:05,737
<i>- What?

671
00:42:05,804 --> 00:42:07,271
Let's get out of here.

672
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:17,347
You have no mixers
at all and no food.

673
00:42:17,415 --> 00:42:19,849
I love your apartment.

674
00:42:19,916 --> 00:42:21,550
It's very manly.

675
00:42:21,617 --> 00:42:24,518
It came this way.

676
00:42:24,586 --> 00:42:26,820
I think Norman mailer
shot a deer over there.

677
00:42:29,256 --> 00:42:31,023
I love deer.

678
00:42:31,091 --> 00:42:32,891
Get your tail
in here and help me.

679
00:42:39,398 --> 00:42:41,899
she seems to know her way
around in your kitchen.

680
00:42:41,967 --> 00:42:43,934
What's that like?

681
00:42:44,002 --> 00:42:45,502
I told you I don't like

682
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:46,937
Giving advice
in these situations.

683
00:42:51,942 --> 00:42:53,509
Why don't you show me around?

684
00:42:55,412 --> 00:42:57,280
I suppose I am
a bit curious myself.

685
00:43:01,584 --> 00:43:03,419
Not in there.

686
00:43:59,581 --> 00:44:01,815
What happened to Acapulco?

687
00:44:04,985 --> 00:44:06,918
She does not go to Barnard.

688
00:44:10,094 --> 00:44:11,897
Guys like him like that.

689
00:44:14,073 --> 00:44:16,811
Come on. Let's go
in the other room.

690
00:44:16,879 --> 00:44:19,549
No. Here.

691
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:40,864
- Morning.
- Morning.

692
00:44:42,332 --> 00:44:44,399
I'm terribly thirsty.

693
00:44:44,466 --> 00:44:46,801
We'll have coffee in a minute.

694
00:44:46,868 --> 00:44:48,601
Just a glass of water, please.

695
00:44:56,107 --> 00:44:57,541
What do I owe you
for the evening?

696
00:45:00,379 --> 00:45:02,647
- Don't worry about it.
- I should pay.

697
00:45:03,949 --> 00:45:06,750
The girl...
how much was she?

698
00:45:06,818 --> 00:45:08,685
$25.

699
00:45:10,454 --> 00:45:14,021
Fascinating.

700
00:45:14,089 --> 00:45:16,356
Here's $30.

701
00:45:25,564 --> 00:45:28,365
Well, I shall be running along.

702
00:45:42,178 --> 00:45:45,747
<i>Thank you for
the welcome distraction.</i>

703
00:46:17,105 --> 00:46:18,906
sorry.

704
00:46:28,650 --> 00:46:32,151
All right. Gentlemen,
shall we begin 1965?
