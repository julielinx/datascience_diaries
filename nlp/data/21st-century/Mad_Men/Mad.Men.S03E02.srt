1
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:43,226
Is there more? I love her.

2
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:46,396
I saw Susan Watson do it on Broadway,
and she was great,

3
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:49,498
- but she didn't have that.
- Well, it's not going to be her,

4
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:52,271
but they want that scene
"frame for frame," as they say.

5
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:55,541
So, something about how desperate she is
for a Pepsi?

6
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:59,846
It's for Pepsi, but it's not for Pepsi.
It's called Patio,

7
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:03,389
and it's a dieter's kind of Pepsi
to help women reduce.

8
00:02:03,756 --> 00:02:05,781
It's Pepsi's diet-right cola,

9
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:09,919
and there's claims that their lawyers
went over calories, etcetera.

10
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:12,190
If we do it right, we land Patio.

11
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:15,233
And if we land Patio,
I'll be at lunch with Pepsi.

12
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:19,362
- I think Pete Campbell just broke a sweat.
- I'm coming to casting.

13
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:23,369
- We're going right to casting?
- You don't have to if you don't want to.

14
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:26,172
I understand why you like this,
but it's not for you.

15
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:29,976
- I'm the one who'd be buying Patio.
- You're not fat anymore.

16
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:31,680
Thank you.

17
00:02:32,685 --> 00:02:34,710
Let's assume we can't talk them out
of the name,

18
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,415
and let's assume we can get a girl
who can match Ann-Margret's ability

19
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:40,789
- to be 25 and act 14.
- Is that what she's doing?

20
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:45,995
Is it just a knockoff?
Are we allowed to make fun of it, at least?

21
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:50,627
- She's fun and sexy. Don't be a prude.
- Would you say that to me?

22
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:56,366
- It's sexy, and it's what they want.
- Clients don't always know what's best.

23
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:00,675
When we land them,
you can start talking to them that way.

24
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:04,982
Pick it up.
Bobby, back away from the stove.

25
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:12,191
We're out of Melba Toast.

26
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:15,987
Jesus, Betts, have some oatmeal.
That baby's gonna weigh a pound.

27
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:20,191
Carla must have had some,
because I would have thrown the box away.

28
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:23,597
Are we gonna collect the whole set?

29
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,534
I thought you didn't mind her
doing the legwork.

30
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:29,802
You didn't need a decorator last time.
I'd like to feel like I'm paying for something.

31
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:34,209
- These are $3 apiece, you know.
- And I can't really judge by a picture.

32
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:36,576
I'm late.

33
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,645
We should really spend a day in Tarrytown.
It'd be so easy.

34
00:03:40,753 --> 00:03:43,119
- No.
- Those stores smell bad.

35
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:45,314
We are going to Tarrytown.

36
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:49,323
And you're gonna stare
at some antique chair for so long

37
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:53,559
the buttons are gonna seem interesting,
and then we'll go to Carvel.

38
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,460
See you tonight.

39
00:03:58,938 --> 00:03:59,996
What are you doing?

40
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,568
I hope you received the package
showing our campaign

41
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:06,804
to ease the way
for the Ravenswood nuclear power facility.

42
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,676
Kinsey was responsible for that.

43
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:11,375
Almost a year,
and nary a peep of opposition.

44
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:13,042
It was very impressive.

45
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:16,713
I've told Paul that you're facing
an onslaught of negative public opinion

46
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:20,953
in your attempt to demolish
the Pennsylvania Railroad Station this year

47
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,290
and replace it
with the new Madison Square Garden.

48
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:26,160
We should have torn the damn thing down
during the newspaper strike.

49
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,257
No one would have noticed.

50
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:31,633
Now, let's take a look at the landscape,
as it were.

51
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:54,120
"How to kill a city.
Architects' inhumanity to architects

52
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:58,254
"surpasses understanding.
The new design is also ambitious,

53
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:00,355
"pedestrian and dull. "

54
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:03,560
Ada Louise Huxtable
is as green as that folder.

55
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,264
People know that she's an angry woman
with a big mouth.

56
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:07,896
<i>Who writes for The New York Times.</i>

57
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:10,032
I don't care if she wrote
for the Ten Commandments.

58
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:14,273
She's trying to sell papers doing what
they always do. Making people miserable.

59
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:17,713
My great-great-grandfather, Silus Dikeman,
would have turned his boat around

60
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:22,049
if he had known that this city
would one day be filled with crybabies.

61
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,689
So what's your best weapon
against lunatics?

62
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:30,159
Fifteen stories, vaulted ceilings,
pink Milford granite columns.

63
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:34,029
I don't think it's crazy to be attached
to a beaux-arts masterpiece

64
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:36,260
through which Teddy Roosevelt
came and went.

65
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:39,099
I've met the opposition. I know crazy.

66
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:43,532
Do you know where
the greatest Roman ruins are?

67
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:48,144
They're in Greece, Spain,
because the Romans tore theirs all down.

68
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:51,410
They took apart the Colosseum
to build their outhouses.

69
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:54,384
This is the Colosseum.
Have you seen the plans?

70
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:56,318
<i>In The New York Times.</i>

71
00:05:56,989 --> 00:06:00,584
- Do you have a problem, buddy?
- He's looking for an angle.

72
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,323
You know those snide ad men
you see in the movies?

73
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,529
Right here.

74
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:10,796
Well, I've got a mailbox full of death threats
from beatniks like him

75
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:12,393
who'd rather live in a teepee.

76
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:16,635
This is the greatest city in the world.
If you don't like it, leave.

77
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,015
Well, we'll let you know.

78
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:28,710
You have no problems
with an atom plant on the East River,

79
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:33,815
- but this bothers you?
- It's Penn Station. This city has no memory.

80
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:36,394
Out with the old, in with the new.
Who says that's a good idea?

81
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:39,397
I'm going to have to talk to Don about this.

82
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:42,634
Don't do that.

83
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:48,636
Look, now they'll trust me more
when I help them.

84
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:52,073
Do you ever listen to yourself?

85
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:56,039
I hate you, you know that.
Other than Wilma Flintstone,

86
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:58,117
I haven't seen anyone carry so well.

87
00:06:58,217 --> 00:07:01,482
It's smoke and mirrors.
I've busted plenty of seams.

88
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:04,082
Well, it makes me optimistic.

89
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:06,848
Greg has made it perfectly clear
that come July 1

90
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:09,393
and he's chief resident,
I'd better watch out.

91
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:12,987
- Hello, Mrs. Draper.
- Can you get Mrs. Draper a glass of water?

92
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,829
Why don't you tell me first
how long I'm going to be here?

93
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:20,163
What's so urgent?
London Bridge falling down?

94
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,207
In a manner of speaking.

95
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:27,470
- I appreciate you stopping by.
- Didn't you just call us into your office?

96
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,879
Well, yes.
I thought it best if I told you in person.

97
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:32,245
I just heard from London.

98
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,876
We've been sacked
by Campbell Soup, Great Britain.

99
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:38,423
I don't want to have to walk down here
every time we lose an account.

100
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:42,392
This is an advertising agency.
I'll wear out the carpet.

101
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:52,504
It's not so much the account we lost
as the account we failed to gain.

102
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:56,775
- So now BBDO has all of Campbell's Soup?
- Why didn't we have a meeting with them?

103
00:07:56,876 --> 00:08:00,471
Perhaps I should drag Burt Peterson in
and fire him again?

104
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:05,142
- Obviously Don would've loved a shot.
- How did this slip through the cracks?

105
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:07,418
I don't usually set meetings, I attend them.

106
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,650
Well, if this is where we wanted to end up,
we all did everything perfectly.

107
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:15,454
You ever get three sheets to the wind
and try that thing on?

108
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:17,990
<i>Mrs. Pryce is here.</i>

109
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:22,829
Nothing to fret about, as long
as there's new business. Five minutes?

110
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:34,002
- It's definitely side to side.
- Is that a boy or a girl?

111
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:36,543
I'll call my mother.

112
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:40,449
Look. Princess Grace
just swallowed a basketball.

113
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:45,083
- How are you, Roger?
- It's not hard to adjust to happiness.

114
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,419
Shall we?

115
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,909
Good night, Mrs. Harris.

116
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:09,508
I'm in a foul mood.

117
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:17,084
Château Lafite Rothschild, '49.
I'm very impressed that you have this.

118
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:19,315
Not bad at that.

119
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:26,191
- Where are you living?
- We have a furnished flat in Sutton Place.

120
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:28,995
Three bedrooms,
spectacular view of the river.

121
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:32,434
And we're near the UN,
so there's plenty of Africans.

122
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:40,069
Like the Bordeaux grape,
may we all get better with time.

123
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:45,944
This is delicious.

124
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:50,822
Rebecca was curious
if you knew anything about schools.

125
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:53,719
In the city, I'm a little out of touch.

126
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:56,558
How long have you been together?

127
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:58,527
- Ten years.
- Nine years.

128
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:01,823
Fifteen for us.

129
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:07,505
- Do you miss London?
- God, yes.

130
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:11,567
But what we lost in London
we gained in insects.

131
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:19,008
J. Walter Thompson
is opening an office in Caracas.

132
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,518
I don't know if the ladies
want to talk about that.

133
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,316
No, of course not.

134
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:28,016
The coquilles. Brilliant.

135
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:34,595
Look, I didn't want to be there
any more than you did.

136
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,567
It was just the cherry on top of my sundae.

137
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:42,932
What?

138
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:47,902
Tell me now,
and not three seconds after I've dozed off.

139
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:52,841
I've been trying to get my father
on the phone.

140
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:59,882
Of course I called William and, again,
something's wrong.

141
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:02,617
Another stroke?

142
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:06,463
- Gloria left him.
- Can you blame her?

143
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:10,626
Yes, I can blame her. She came into his life,

144
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,801
he suddenly takes ill
and she abandons him.

145
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:17,871
Maybe she realized he's a son of a bitch.

146
00:11:19,912 --> 00:11:21,880
Don, I'm worried about him.

147
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:26,314
He doesn't sound right,
and I can't take a car trip now.

148
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:33,051
I think William and Judy
should bring him up this weekend.

149
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:37,926
- Great, more antiques.
- It's spring break. It'll be nice for the kids.

150
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:42,664
- Those girls are a nightmare.
- They'll leave by Saturday at the latest.

151
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:50,073
Why did you even bother asking me?

152
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:54,675
She's really kicking.

153
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:07,214
<i>- Mr. Sterling, your family is here.
- Send them in.</i>

154
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:12,628
If it isn't fall bride.

155
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:18,297
- Where's Brooks?
- He'll be along.

156
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:21,805
- Would anyone like anything? Coffee or...
- It's 10:30.

157
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,477
Sherry, if you have it.

158
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:31,576
I told Brooks to come late.
I don't want him to be embarrassed.

159
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:37,589
By what? That I'm paying for everything?
You just tell him that's the way it's done.

160
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:40,750
No, Roger, it's about Jane.

161
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,387
What about her?
It was her idea to take you to Dior.

162
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:49,100
Why haven't you returned her calls?
You're hurting her feelings.

163
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,601
I know what you think.

164
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,638
You think it's so uncomfortable
that I won't even bring it up.

165
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:58,369
Well, you're being very dramatic
for a girl who didn't want a wedding at all.

166
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:00,775
Do you want me to say it?
Do I have to say it?

167
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,245
Say what, exactly?

168
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:06,682
I've suggested to Margaret a compromise.
You and June host your own table,

169
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:11,314
- and I'll be at the Hargroves'.
- So, you get the in-laws and I get Siberia?

170
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:16,185
Are you worried about an odd number?
Because I'll get your mother a date.

171
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,024
- I have a date.
- Who?

172
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:21,462
- Bruce Pike.
- What does that old saddlebag want?

173
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:24,536
I didn't want to go to her wedding,
but I did.

174
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:28,072
- The least she can do is not come to mine.
- Not come?

175
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:32,076
- That's why I suggested a compromise.
- You're not even giving Jane a chance.

176
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:35,147
Seeing her on my wedding day
is gonna ruin it.

177
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:38,680
She's young enough to be my sister.
How does it look?

178
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,452
- Sweetheart.
- Brooks! Thank God.

179
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:43,045
Mom.

180
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:48,786
- How are you, sir?
- Not great, Brooks. Not great.

181
00:13:50,262 --> 00:13:51,661
Can I get you something?

182
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:54,198
- No.
- That's okay. I'll have yours.

183
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,301
- Roger.
- We're not married anymore, you know.

184
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,635
I like the silver and the bells.

185
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:09,780
Go with the bells. November 23rd.
I'll tell Jane.

186
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:18,182
<i>Mr. Pryce is here to see you.</i>

187
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:23,693
Send him in.

188
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,461
Your wife is charming.

189
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:33,533
- She lifted Rebecca's spirits inestimably.
- I'm glad to hear it. They really hit it off.

190
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:39,499
I hate to send you into the lion's den,
but I think it best you take the gentleman

191
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:42,547
from Madison Square Garden
to a nice lunch today.

192
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:45,742
Peter and Paul rubbed him
very much the wrong way.

193
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:49,719
- I told you before, Roger's the lion tamer.
- Roger will join as well.

194
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:51,915
It will help if you tell me
who these people are.

195
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:54,686
All I could secure was Edgar Raffit,

196
00:14:54,793 --> 00:14:58,285
vice president of Madison Square Garden,
and he's irate.

197
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:00,831
What does he want?

198
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:04,630
A Cyrano de Bergerac
to make New York fall in love with him.

199
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:08,329
- Today?
- Do you have plans?

200
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,379
Have Campbell send over the folder.

201
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,352
They're wild Indians.

202
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:28,220
They've been cooped up since Woodbridge.

203
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:30,189
I fixed some lunch.

204
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:36,227
- Cold roast chicken, or I have cold cuts.
- We went to Pat's Steaks.

205
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:38,928
I got you a half.

206
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:42,438
- Have you all already eaten?
- No, we waited.

207
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:49,979
- I even got Gloria a chicken parmesan.
- Well, great. We'll mail it to her.

208
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:55,015
She's in Boca Raton.
She's not coming back.

209
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:02,122
He understands completely.
He's just playing it up.

210
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:06,360
- How was the drive, Daddy?
- In the Lincoln?

211
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:11,895
You should take your Coumadin
with your sandwich.

212
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:23,473
So I said to them, "It's so crowded in here,
I feel like I'm on the subway. "

213
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:26,043
I've never seen anyone like you on the train.

214
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:29,086
Well, my husband won't let me.
It's a figure of speech.

215
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:32,783
Have a seat,
and I'll let Mr. Pryce know that you're here.

216
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:50,775
Sorry about that. I got tied up.

217
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:53,970
What else do you have to do today?
What else do you have to do all week?

218
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,910
I barely made it here.

219
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:59,047
Ginger presses the buzzer,
says, "Your family's here. "

220
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:03,110
Sounded silly. Gibson, up.
That's gonna help.

221
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:08,020
To my knees, Don.
They're bringing me to my knees.

222
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:12,795
- Sorry to hear that.
- I made my bed, I should lie in it, right?

223
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,129
Your words, not mine.

224
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:23,368
Like it's not hard enough
losing my little girl to that kid.

225
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:27,008
I've got her mother
pouring poison in her ear.

226
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:29,273
There's a land grab going on.

227
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:37,287
I blame Mona.

228
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:41,887
All of a sudden,
I could give two craps about that wedding.

229
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:44,485
- All I want to do is win.
- Gentlemen.

230
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,730
- A pleasure to meet you. Roger Sterling.
- Edgar Raffit.

231
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:53,498
- Our creative director Don Draper.
- Edgar.

232
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:56,506
Have a seat, please. Let's get you fixed up.

233
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,276
I only have a minute.

234
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:03,576
Edgar, please.
Eat our sweetmeats, drink our wine.

235
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:11,988
I understand one of our copywriters
took a Yetta Wallenda-sized misstep.

236
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:16,727
The girl, the tightrope walker.

237
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:19,957
They got her off the sidewalk
with a hose last week.

238
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:23,262
The point is,
we completely understand your problem.

239
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:27,566
- All we want to know is how we can help.
- You're supposed to tell me.

240
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:30,637
Well, I've done all I can. Don?

241
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,603
In the interest of time,
you want to demolish Penn Station

242
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:39,582
- and New York hates it.
- Not all of New York. A vocal minority.

243
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,143
Can they stop it?

244
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:44,188
Well, I think all the hubbub
is making it unpleasant for...

245
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,655
But they can't stop it, can they?

246
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,225
Why do you people insist
on making us sound like villains?

247
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,993
Your concern over public opinion
shows a guilty conscience.

248
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:59,962
Now what good is that serving you
if what is to be done is already underway?

249
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:01,437
Leave those.

250
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:05,840
Bring a couple of iceberg wedges,
blue cheese, bacon.

251
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,714
So let's say
I don't have a guilty conscience.

252
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:16,152
Good. And let's also say that change
is neither good or bad, it simply is.

253
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:19,020
It can be greeted with terror or joy.

254
00:19:19,124 --> 00:19:22,287
A tantrum that says,
"I want it the way it was,"

255
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:26,056
or a dance that says,
"Look. It's something new. "

256
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:31,602
- Would you draw the line at 50%?
- I'm not drawing a line at all.

257
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:35,034
PR people understand this,
but they can never execute it.

258
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:39,668
If you don't like what is being said,
change the conversation.

259
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:51,479
What is that conversation?

260
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:58,559
I was in California.
Everything is new, and it's clean.

261
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:03,632
The people are filled with hope.
New York City is in decay.

262
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:10,965
But Madison Square Garden...
It's the beginning of a new city on a hill.

263
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:15,104
- Just like that?
- It's true, isn't it?

264
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:20,815
If I were to come to you,
I don't want that kid on my account.

265
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:25,351
- The communist, the radical.
- I will handle it personally.

266
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,753
Grandpa Gene is going
to watch his program now.

267
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:35,862
I just want to catch the end of the game.

268
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:41,702
<i>- Move.
- And the first pitch of the ball, outside.</i>

269
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:57,486
- Daddy seems well. He has an appetite.
- He eats constantly.

270
00:20:58,223 --> 00:21:01,818
When I found out Gloria was gone,
I was hoping he ate her.

271
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:06,095
- How could you not know about that?
- I went by, but he lied to me.

272
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:09,065
Then, finally, when I let myself in,
he went bananas.

273
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:10,600
He's ashamed.

274
00:21:11,703 --> 00:21:12,897
Judy can get through to him.

275
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:16,634
He's down in the dumps,
but he seems very clearheaded.

276
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:21,111
That's not true, Judy, and you know it.
He's angry, and he's in and out.

277
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:30,615
There is this place, the Parker Home.
It's midway between us, in New Brunswick.

278
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:34,022
And what happens there?

279
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:37,658
He lives there.
It's got everything, plus doctors.

280
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:42,194
It's expensive, but I thought
maybe we could sell our house.

281
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:45,866
You know.
That would give him enough to live on.

282
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,734
That's very generous.

283
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:55,038
- Do you think he belongs in a home?
- Betty, I know I don't get a vote.

284
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:58,412
- Neither does Don.
- All you care about is the house.

285
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:02,052
You want to walk in there,
see Daddy on the bottom of the stairs,

286
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:05,055
and have his last words be,
"Take the house. "

287
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:14,060
Fine, Betts. What's the solution?

288
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:17,224
Those homes are for people
who don't have families, William.

289
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:21,670
- He's a lonely old man and he's not well.
- He's your father.

290
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:48,729
- Gene.
- Thanks for the ritzy accommodations.

291
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:54,265
You're an army man, Gene.
Drop your socks and grab something.

292
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,754
Lights out at 8:15. I'm impressed.

293
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:16,089
I wish you would hang your coat up
downstairs. It's covered with soot.

294
00:23:23,468 --> 00:23:26,562
- How bad is he?
- He's not the problem.

295
00:23:27,672 --> 00:23:32,666
What am I saying? He's the whole problem.
That, and William's never-ending bullshit.

296
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:37,010
- What now?
- He wants to put him in an old folks' home.

297
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:41,211
Well, I understand it's not ideal,
but it is the next logical step.

298
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,545
Don, he just wants the house.

299
00:23:44,222 --> 00:23:48,682
He keeps nailing himself to the cross.
For all I know, Judy's pushing him.

300
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,261
Cut it out!

301
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:01,536
What do you want to do?

302
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:06,344
How can he talk that way to me
in the condition I'm in?

303
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:11,705
- Do you want anything?
- Just throw it on the chair and stay here.

304
00:24:20,091 --> 00:24:21,422
Be careful.

305
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:24,256
I'm fine.

306
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:43,608
It's so funny how she is.
My father and her fought constantly.

307
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:46,778
She never remembers that part.

308
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:50,582
- Family is important to her.
- I care about family.

309
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:55,384
You know, Don had nobody
at their wedding. Nobody at all.

310
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:03,126
Why can't we just move in with him?
I'll take care of him.

311
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:06,726
It's bad enough to work for him.
I'm a 30-year-old man.

312
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:11,706
I don't want to have somebody tell me
I have the wrong tie on.

313
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:29,780
Raffit is sending over every piece of paper
they have on the new Garden.

314
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:33,824
<i>He wants you to see these new drawings.
Apparently they're right out of Metropolis.</i>

315
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:36,553
- He talk about television?
- I have a meeting on the books.

316
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:39,357
He talked a lot about radio. And Kinsey.

317
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:41,188
You're gonna have
to keep a low profile on this,

318
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:45,599
<i>- but it doesn't mean you're not working.
- Mr. Pryce is here to see you.</i>

319
00:26:48,807 --> 00:26:50,570
I didn't realize
you were in the middle of something.

320
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:53,644
Did you come to treat us
to a little new-business lunch?

321
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:56,305
May I speak with you in private, Don?

322
00:27:02,854 --> 00:27:05,550
- Can I get you anything?
- No, thank you.

323
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:10,955
Bad news, I'm afraid.
I just got off the phone with London.

324
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:14,063
There's a problem
with Madison Square Garden.

325
00:27:14,332 --> 00:27:18,063
- Did their check bounce already?
- Unfortunately, there's a conflict.

326
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:21,263
Did you tell them it's a stadium
in the middle of New York City?

327
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:24,342
- It's one of a kind.
- They know exactly what it is, a project,

328
00:27:24,442 --> 00:27:26,808
and they told us to turn it down.

329
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:31,281
- I'm confused.
- It's a question of economics.

330
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:35,080
Servicing Madison Square Garden
will require an account man,

331
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:37,782
at least two copywriters, two artists,

332
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:41,586
an ombudsman for City Hall,
all against 200,000 in billings.

333
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:42,760
That's for right now.

334
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:46,319
Precisely. From what I understand,
groundbreaking is at least two years away.

335
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:49,491
Madison Square Garden
is our way into the World's Fair,

336
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:51,796
the largest trade show in history.

337
00:27:51,903 --> 00:27:56,067
Plus, there's the Garden itself.
Hotels, concerts, sports.

338
00:27:56,675 --> 00:28:01,476
- This could mean 30 years of business.
- They're not interested. I'm sorry.

339
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:08,015
You told me to go out and get this account.
I did. I did my job,

340
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:09,347
and now you're telling me
it's all for nothing

341
00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:13,015
because you forgot to check with
your boss first? Who's running this place?

342
00:28:13,124 --> 00:28:16,821
I know this is difficult.
I take full responsibility.

343
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:20,054
Why the hell did you buy us
in the first place?

344
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,533
I don't know.

345
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:38,774
Tell Mr. Campbell
Madison Square Garden is dead.

346
00:28:39,284 --> 00:28:41,650
- Do you have a second?
- Can it wait?

347
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:42,742
No.

348
00:28:47,959 --> 00:28:50,052
Sal sent up the storyboards.

349
00:28:51,863 --> 00:28:54,923
- What is this?
- It's Patio, the diet drink for Pepsi.

350
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:58,366
Yes. Everyone wants a drink
that sounds like a floor.

351
00:28:59,537 --> 00:29:00,629
This is Chinese.

352
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:03,572
<i>It's all one shot,
like the beginning of Bye Bye Birdie.</i>

353
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:07,111
- I haven't seen it.
- Well, this is an Ann-Margret type.

354
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:08,970
Fine.

355
00:29:09,814 --> 00:29:11,975
You really haven't seen it?
You see everything.

356
00:29:34,205 --> 00:29:36,571
We have a few versions of a song,

357
00:29:36,841 --> 00:29:39,708
and the boys are very excited
about finding this girl.

358
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:41,039
I'm sure.

359
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:44,144
Don't you find her voice shrill?

360
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:49,053
She's throwing herself at the camera.
It's pure.

361
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,381
It makes your heart hurt.

362
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:57,393
No one seems to care that it speaks to men,
not the people that drink diet drinks.

363
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:01,098
What do the geniuses at Patio want?

364
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:06,699
Maybe we should be talking about how
this is better than coffee or Dexedrine.

365
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:09,137
It's not about making women feel fat.

366
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,971
This is, "Look how happy I am
that I drink Patio.

367
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:17,439
"I'm young and excited
and desperate for a man. "

368
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:21,509
I don't mind fantasies,
but shouldn't it be a female one?

369
00:30:21,686 --> 00:30:23,415
Peggy, I know you understand
how this works.

370
00:30:23,521 --> 00:30:25,853
Men want her. Women want to be her.

371
00:30:25,957 --> 00:30:28,152
- Even if that's true...
- It is.

372
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:32,459
I'm sorry if that makes you uncomfortable.

373
00:30:33,932 --> 00:30:35,729
Well, you know,
if we were making a movie or a play,

374
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:38,701
we'd be embarrassed to do this. It's phony.

375
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:43,565
You're not an artist, Peggy.
You solve problems.

376
00:30:46,711 --> 00:30:49,077
Leave some tools in your toolbox.

377
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,249
Could you hold that?

378
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,795
- Heading home?
- Yes.

379
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,165
Let me ask you something.
You're a young girl.

380
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:19,573
Excuse me?

381
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:24,513
You're the only one around here who
doesn't have that stupid look on her face.

382
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:26,345
What does that mean?

383
00:31:26,584 --> 00:31:31,044
What would your father have to do
for you to not want him at your wedding?

384
00:31:31,923 --> 00:31:36,656
- My father passed away.
- There you go. You'd do anything.

385
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:20,797
Hello.

386
00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:40,257
It's so crowded in here,
I feel like I'm on the subway.

387
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:44,856
Where's your drink?

388
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:03,671
Don. Don't worry about this.
It's under control.

389
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:18,785
- Hey, where's Mom?
- She's upstairs.

390
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:35,973
- I'm going out for a bucket of chicken.
- What's the matter?

391
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:39,278
- I'm a horrible daughter.
- No, you're not.

392
00:33:39,984 --> 00:33:43,511
William says these are the options.
We put him in a home,

393
00:33:43,621 --> 00:33:47,682
or they move in with him
and Judy is his nurse. Judy.

394
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:49,692
William says?

395
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:52,791
He's probably right.

396
00:33:53,731 --> 00:33:55,494
- William!
- Yeah, Don?

397
00:33:57,135 --> 00:33:59,399
Go get the chicken in a minute.

398
00:34:02,306 --> 00:34:04,399
Can I speak to you a minute?

399
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:19,280
- Jesus. What year is this from?
- I don't care.

400
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:25,457
Look, Don, we're all upset.

401
00:34:26,497 --> 00:34:29,557
One thing I've learned from this,
don't get old.

402
00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:33,002
- About your father...
- Man's a real jackpot.

403
00:34:33,204 --> 00:34:37,004
He always said he didn't want
to be a burden, yet here we are.

404
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:41,374
This is what's going to happen.

405
00:34:42,013 --> 00:34:44,413
You're gonna explain to your sister
and your wife

406
00:34:44,515 --> 00:34:47,109
that we have reached an understanding.

407
00:34:47,952 --> 00:34:50,921
You are going to support
your father financially,

408
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:56,460
and I am going to take him into my house.
His house will remain untouched.

409
00:34:57,028 --> 00:35:00,964
I appreciate the advice, Don.
I'll take it under consideration.

410
00:35:01,065 --> 00:35:03,056
You're gonna go out there
and you're gonna tell your sister

411
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:05,226
that this is what you want.

412
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:08,030
We'll pretend that you did the right thing
on your own.

413
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:10,699
- He's my father!
- And he's in my home.

414
00:35:12,477 --> 00:35:14,877
I want you to leave tonight,
and I want you to leave the Lincoln.

415
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:18,574
- I can't have him here without a car.
- Are you kidding me?

416
00:35:20,518 --> 00:35:22,816
How are we supposed to get home?

417
00:35:24,388 --> 00:35:27,721
New York Central.
Broadway Limited from Penn Station.

418
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,725
It leaves in two hours.

419
00:35:32,396 --> 00:35:35,297
You want him? You got him.

420
00:36:28,819 --> 00:36:31,720
- Dad, we have to talk.
- I could eat.

421
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:35,857
No. Daddy, William has something to say.

422
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:42,992
All of us, we've been trying to figure out
a way we can help you live better.

423
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:46,160
I'd be doing all right if people left me alone.

424
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:47,830
Daddy,

425
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:52,632
- Don and I want you to live here with us.
- Elizabeth.

426
00:36:54,278 --> 00:36:55,973
Honey, I'm not that blue.

427
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:59,516
Just for a while.
I think you need a little vacation.

428
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,850
So the animals are running the zoo?

429
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:10,655
We're not selling the house,
and you're gonna have your car.

430
00:37:12,163 --> 00:37:15,360
The plans, the plans, the plans you make.

431
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:25,105
You know you want to get out of town.
You'll be with the kids.

432
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:29,545
Betty is a better cook. You always say that.

433
00:37:34,952 --> 00:37:40,254
- Well, I should've been the first to go.
- Daddy, don't talk like that.

434
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:47,595
We should go pack.
Girls, start getting your things together.

435
00:37:57,441 --> 00:38:00,205
It's nice, right? It's called a stinger.

436
00:38:01,178 --> 00:38:04,045
- I don't know what's in it.
- It's delicious.

437
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,821
I'm graduating from Brooklyn College
next month.

438
00:38:12,923 --> 00:38:15,084
- What are you studying?
- What?

439
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:18,486
- What are you studying?
- Do you want one?

440
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:22,927
- I'm afraid you're gonna bite my hand.
- I'm sorry.

441
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:28,766
I just need to eat.
My mom says I'm still growing.

442
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:34,035
I gotta work on my manners.

443
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:38,774
I started pre-law,
but switched to engineering. More jobs.

444
00:38:39,216 --> 00:38:41,946
Really? Those are so different.

445
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,220
You've gotta figure,
if we're all gonna be replaced by machines,

446
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,348
might as well be a guy
that makes them, right?

447
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:49,824
Or you could just become a robot.

448
00:38:51,195 --> 00:38:55,154
- Are you in school?
- I work at an ad agency, Manhattan.

449
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:59,298
Wow. I don't know how you girls
do all that typing.

450
00:39:02,106 --> 00:39:06,133
- And I work for a jerk.
- We're hitting the road. You got cab fare?

451
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:09,669
What are you talking about?
I live around the corner.

452
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,645
That's right. He does.

453
00:39:25,463 --> 00:39:26,896
You're funny.

454
00:39:51,522 --> 00:39:53,456
Do you have... You know.

455
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,725
- What?
- A Trojan?

456
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:03,757
No.

457
00:40:17,815 --> 00:40:19,009
I can't.

458
00:40:21,318 --> 00:40:22,512
I can't.

459
00:40:32,229 --> 00:40:36,063
Jeez. It's getting pretty late.

460
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,195
Well,

461
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:44,407
there are other things we could do.

462
00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:15,398
Did you hear that?

463
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:27,608
Gene.

464
00:41:29,019 --> 00:41:32,079
The heat is on.
We got to get rid of this stuff.

465
00:41:37,528 --> 00:41:40,326
You got anything else around, go flush it.

466
00:42:25,843 --> 00:42:28,676
- You're leaving?
- I have to work tomorrow.

467
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:33,375
- You want to get breakfast?
- It's the middle of the night.

468
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:37,983
- Where do you work again?
- Madison Avenue.

469
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:39,848
Right.

470
00:42:41,825 --> 00:42:45,317
Well, you know,
I hang out at that place a lot.

471
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,292
Okay.

472
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,142
It's the bottom one.

473
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:07,744
Thanks.

474
00:43:10,621 --> 00:43:12,054
This was fun.

475
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:24,397
Parents, friends, and family,
I'd like to welcome you all to field day.

476
00:43:25,669 --> 00:43:29,435
I hope you can appreciate
how hard the children have prepared

477
00:43:29,807 --> 00:43:31,741
in all kinds of weather.

478
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:34,570
Scott?

479
00:43:38,148 --> 00:43:42,050
"The tradition of the maypole
dates back over 500 years,

480
00:43:42,486 --> 00:43:45,080
"and is celebrated all over the world.

481
00:43:45,322 --> 00:43:51,283
"We erected our maypole
for Ossining's sesquicentennial.

482
00:43:52,196 --> 00:43:55,632
"We dance around the pole
