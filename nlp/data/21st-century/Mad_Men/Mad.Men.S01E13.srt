1
00:00:00,121 --> 00:00:01,631
Do you know how hard it is

2
00:00:01,843 --> 00:00:03,091
to see you walking around here?

3
00:00:03,757 --> 00:00:05,413
<i>Previously on</i> Mad Men.

4
00:00:05,589 --> 00:00:08,795
Glen! Young man, what is wrong with you?
This room is occupied!

5
00:00:08,924 --> 00:00:10,239
I'm getting another account?

6
00:00:10,432 --> 00:00:12,058
It's an assignment, not an account.

7
00:00:12,428 --> 00:00:14,685
I've never really
seen your eyes before.

8
00:00:15,698 --> 00:00:17,535
Herman Phillips, Bert Cooper.

9
00:00:17,711 --> 00:00:20,212
Actually, "Herman" goes on
my checks. People call me Duck.

10
00:00:20,405 --> 00:00:21,603
Want something a little
stronger there Carlton?

11
00:00:21,744 --> 00:00:23,798
I Don't want you telling Francine
that I suggested

12
00:00:23,928 --> 00:00:24,938
something that I didn't.

13
00:00:25,091 --> 00:00:26,155
It's $5000.

14
00:00:26,397 --> 00:00:27,568
I want you to leave New York,

15
00:00:27,774 --> 00:00:29,905
and I don't want to see or hear
from you ever again.

16
00:01:05,937 --> 00:01:07,211
Season 1 Episode 13
<i>The Wheel</i>

17
00:01:07,382 --> 00:01:09,998
I like this for the powder room,
but definitely not the bedroom.

18
00:01:10,127 --> 00:01:12,100
- It's a little busy.
- I'm not sure.

19
00:01:12,485 --> 00:01:15,185
It's not the curtains I'm worried
about, but the cabinets.

20
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:17,533
Nixon didn't stand a chance.

22
00:01:17,937 --> 00:01:20,778
The Browns trounced the Redskins,
31-10.

24
00:01:21,808 --> 00:01:23,428
The result of that last home game

25
00:01:23,634 --> 00:01:26,464
has correctly predicted
the last six elections.

26
00:01:27,272 --> 00:01:29,585
I wish someone would have
told me that.

27
00:01:30,161 --> 00:01:33,806
Of course, it's really
a 50/50 chance of being right.

28
00:01:38,249 --> 00:01:39,692
I want to treat you like a son

29
00:01:39,872 --> 00:01:42,918
because...
I feel that way towards you.

30
00:01:46,313 --> 00:01:48,279
Trudy told us that you were up for

31
00:01:48,521 --> 00:01:51,157
a promotion and
you didn't get it or something.

32
00:01:51,971 --> 00:01:54,989
- I wish she hadn't.
- Now, she loves you.

33
00:01:56,092 --> 00:01:59,920
And honestly, I think you need
to take a little focus off your work.

34
00:02:00,555 --> 00:02:03,076
This from one of the top salesmen
at <i>Vicks Chemical</i>.

35
00:02:03,641 --> 00:02:06,797
When you started talking about that
<i>Clearasil</i> company you bought...

36
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:08,769
Now, that was kind of worth
bragging about.

37
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,049
Did you know that there's a surge
in adolescents right now?

38
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:13,930
I'll tell you, <i>Sterling Cooper</i>

39
00:02:14,185 --> 00:02:17,496
and yours truly would love
to help you deliver that message.

40
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:20,033
See? Now that's what
I'm talking about.

41
00:02:20,292 --> 00:02:24,440
The only family and business you should
be mixing is the production of a child.

42
00:02:24,909 --> 00:02:26,551
And what did Trudy say about that?

43
00:02:26,727 --> 00:02:27,735
About what?

44
00:02:28,533 --> 00:02:31,181
Tom, loose lips sink ships.

45
00:02:31,334 --> 00:02:33,712
I was just saying that work
isn't everything, you know.

46
00:02:33,865 --> 00:02:36,994
It's like that song says:
tend your own garden.

47
00:02:37,236 --> 00:02:38,482
What song is that, Daddy?

48
00:02:39,029 --> 00:02:40,022
I don't know.

49
00:02:40,216 --> 00:02:42,235
- People say it. It's true.
- It is true.

50
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,759
Tend to your own garden.
That means...

51
00:02:45,334 --> 00:02:47,463
you know, start growing things.

52
00:02:47,705 --> 00:02:48,715
Daddy!

53
00:02:49,165 --> 00:02:50,216
You're embarrassing us.

54
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:52,843
It'll be the best Christmas present
this one ever had.

55
00:02:53,085 --> 00:02:55,177
And hell, Thanksgiving's Thursday.

56
00:03:00,511 --> 00:03:02,601
And I guess I should
go to Keppler Farm

57
00:03:02,767 --> 00:03:04,474
to get some acorn squash.

58
00:03:05,656 --> 00:03:07,961
What am I doing?
They have squash there.

59
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:09,819
Very good squash, actually.

60
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:15,423
I wish you would come.

61
00:03:16,457 --> 00:03:18,002
Birdie, I'm a partner.

62
00:03:18,892 --> 00:03:21,011
80% of my business rolls
out next week.

63
00:03:21,168 --> 00:03:23,410
It just seems silly for me
to go down there

64
00:03:23,539 --> 00:03:25,348
for a 12-hour Thanksgiving.

65
00:03:25,952 --> 00:03:27,021
What about...

66
00:03:28,146 --> 00:03:30,454
Sally and Bobby's
childhood memories?

67
00:03:32,582 --> 00:03:35,261
There was no reason
you couldn't have it up here.

68
00:03:35,778 --> 00:03:37,562
You know my brother's children
are animals.

69
00:03:37,692 --> 00:03:39,065
They can't make the trip up here,

70
00:03:39,182 --> 00:03:41,600
and I don't want my dad to be alone.

71
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:44,144
I'll take a cab to the train...

72
00:03:46,013 --> 00:03:47,505
and William will pick us up,

73
00:03:47,706 --> 00:03:49,472
probably in some new car.

74
00:03:55,249 --> 00:03:56,646
You know what? I...

75
00:03:58,232 --> 00:03:59,864
I don't think you want to go.

76
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,873
I'm sorry. Was I unclear about that?

77
00:04:10,096 --> 00:04:13,290
I don't understand why you can't
make my family your family.

78
00:04:22,483 --> 00:04:24,914
Ken is perfectly happy
to have me here.

79
00:04:27,298 --> 00:04:30,327
What do you think it's like?
He's a bachelor. It's dirty.

80
00:04:31,444 --> 00:04:32,806
I'm not complaing.

81
00:04:35,719 --> 00:04:38,913
I don't think it's a good idea
to spend money on a hotel right now.

82
00:04:39,149 --> 00:04:42,331
If you're so worried about
my well-being, let me come home.

83
00:04:44,954 --> 00:04:46,520
That's not what I meant.

84
00:04:48,787 --> 00:04:50,877
I mean, I know how it sounded.

85
00:04:55,051 --> 00:04:56,079
Jennifer.

86
00:05:08,064 --> 00:05:08,896
Yes.

87
00:05:09,813 --> 00:05:11,874
I'll quit if you want me come home.

88
00:05:16,447 --> 00:05:17,738
I miss you...

89
00:05:19,249 --> 00:05:20,249
...so much.

90
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,214
Those the legendary

91
00:05:35,456 --> 00:05:36,985
secret files of Bert Cooper?

92
00:05:37,247 --> 00:05:38,247
No.

93
00:05:39,251 --> 00:05:41,115
I got a call from Abraham Menken.

94
00:05:41,287 --> 00:05:43,055
I'm sure you know that
his daughter will be

95
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:44,887
unavailable for
the next three months.

96
00:05:45,051 --> 00:05:47,752
Taking some sort of
ocean voyage to Paris

97
00:05:47,939 --> 00:05:49,620
and what not.

98
00:05:50,285 --> 00:05:51,741
I hadn't heard that.

99
00:05:54,651 --> 00:05:56,360
- But otherwise?
- There is no otherwise.

100
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,199
Why is this man calling me?

101
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:05,161
I don't know. Is he unhappy?

102
00:06:05,582 --> 00:06:08,365
As a partner, I do not expect
your personal preferences

103
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,708
to interfere with our business.

104
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,418
Who says they have?

105
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,308
It was the tone of his voice.
He's her father.

106
00:06:16,089 --> 00:06:17,131
That's it, cowboy.

107
00:06:26,499 --> 00:06:27,499
Francine.

108
00:06:27,744 --> 00:06:29,740
I'm coming in. I'm freezing.

109
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:34,004
You're in your slippers.

110
00:06:34,274 --> 00:06:36,223
I've been outside waiting
for you to come home,

111
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,018
just sitting in the car hoping
no one would see me.

112
00:06:39,311 --> 00:06:40,457
What's going on?

113
00:06:40,662 --> 00:06:41,848
Are your kids home?

114
00:06:42,095 --> 00:06:43,645
No. What happened?

115
00:06:45,686 --> 00:06:46,896
I'm so stupid.

116
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,758
So damn stupid.

117
00:06:51,559 --> 00:06:53,069
You're not, Francine.

118
00:06:54,436 --> 00:06:56,638
Whatever happened,
you're not stupid.

119
00:06:57,749 --> 00:07:00,090
My mind hasn't been so sharp
since I had the baby.

120
00:07:01,105 --> 00:07:02,549
And Carlton gave me a stack of mail,

121
00:07:02,725 --> 00:07:05,054
and honestly I think
I just threw it away.

122
00:07:05,296 --> 00:07:07,068
And four days later,
the phone was cut off,

123
00:07:07,197 --> 00:07:09,064
so I had to go to the phone company

124
00:07:09,421 --> 00:07:11,578
and pay it, or, you know,
he'd have a fit.

125
00:07:11,906 --> 00:07:14,525
And I had to do all
this without him knowing.

126
00:07:15,037 --> 00:07:16,124
How perfect.

127
00:07:18,837 --> 00:07:20,199
I don't understand.

128
00:07:21,854 --> 00:07:23,351
They gave me the bill.

129
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,268
It was close to $18.

130
00:07:30,068 --> 00:07:32,933
There were all these calls:
long distance.

131
00:07:33,951 --> 00:07:36,523
MH. MH? Manhattan?

132
00:07:40,186 --> 00:07:41,696
So I called one.

133
00:07:43,695 --> 00:07:45,163
A woman answered.

134
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,001
I had just...

135
00:07:49,075 --> 00:07:52,481
I said, "I'm calling from
Carlton Hanson's office. "

136
00:07:52,829 --> 00:07:54,101
She said, "Really?"

137
00:07:54,571 --> 00:07:57,797
I said, "He wants to have dinner
tonight at the usual place."

138
00:07:58,569 --> 00:08:00,289
What made you say that?

139
00:08:06,183 --> 00:08:09,424
What woman would
he be calling in Manhattan

140
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:13,053
who answers her own phone?

141
00:08:15,241 --> 00:08:16,411
Married women.

142
00:08:16,728 --> 00:08:19,006
Lots of women answer
their own phones.

143
00:08:20,576 --> 00:08:23,299
So he's calling some married woman
from my house

144
00:08:24,182 --> 00:08:26,552
while I'm upstairs sleeping?

145
00:08:27,514 --> 00:08:28,824
Maybe it's a cater.

146
00:08:28,953 --> 00:08:31,302
Maybe he's throwing
you a surprise party.

147
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:40,625
Do you know he spends two nights
a week at the Waldorf?

148
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,253
I'm so stupid.

149
00:08:44,937 --> 00:08:46,442
Assuming the worst...

150
00:08:48,719 --> 00:08:50,809
The worst is that I'll poison him.

151
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:54,171
He's so stupid, he'd drink anything.

152
00:08:57,553 --> 00:09:00,030
I'm gonna have
a house full of people.

153
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:02,293
I'll poison them all:

154
00:09:02,457 --> 00:09:03,573
his parents,

155
00:09:04,189 --> 00:09:05,287
my parents...

156
00:09:07,117 --> 00:09:08,127
my kids.

157
00:09:08,408 --> 00:09:09,436
Stop it.

158
00:09:10,344 --> 00:09:11,639
Stop that, Francine.

159
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:14,252
You're emotional.

160
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:16,567
- It doesn't mean...
- Damn it, Betty.

161
00:09:17,061 --> 00:09:18,562
I know everything.

162
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,491
What am I gonna do?

163
00:09:21,011 --> 00:09:22,654
I've been sitting outside in the car.

164
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:25,152
What do I do?
I thought you'd know what to do.

165
00:09:27,065 --> 00:09:29,197
Me? I... Why?

166
00:09:33,564 --> 00:09:34,651
I don't know.

167
00:09:45,109 --> 00:09:45,920
I'm s...

168
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:48,016
so embarrassed.

169
00:09:51,778 --> 00:09:53,410
He doesn't know you know.

170
00:09:53,938 --> 00:09:55,119
I know that.

171
00:09:59,304 --> 00:10:00,379
I should go.

172
00:10:03,557 --> 00:10:04,628
No. Don't.

173
00:10:05,643 --> 00:10:06,801
You'll be okay.

174
00:10:07,706 --> 00:10:08,529
Mrs. Draper?

175
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:10,322
Sorry I'm late.

176
00:10:12,131 --> 00:10:13,915
It's okay, Carla. You can go.

177
00:10:14,051 --> 00:10:16,987
- You want me to unpack the groceries?
- I'll do it. Just go.

178
00:10:18,548 --> 00:10:19,548
Good-bye.

179
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,522
First things first.

180
00:11:10,647 --> 00:11:12,760
When I call a meeting,
if you arrive after me,

181
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:14,281
you are late.

182
00:11:15,922 --> 00:11:17,636
Boys, the stock in our stable:

183
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,350
Lucky Strike, Bethlehem Steel, Maytag.

184
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:24,729
No automobile, airline,
pharmaceuticals.

185
00:11:25,369 --> 00:11:26,707
Tobacco *** list.

186
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:29,067
You're Cosgrove, right?

187
00:11:29,834 --> 00:11:33,071
"The power health
behind the Rejuvenator".

188
00:11:33,697 --> 00:11:36,351
Actually,
it's called The Relax-a-Cizor.

189
00:11:37,149 --> 00:11:39,203
- What the hell is it?
- It's weight lost device.

190
00:11:39,626 --> 00:11:41,747
With a female pleasure payload.

191
00:11:43,113 --> 00:11:43,946
Really?

192
00:11:45,712 --> 00:11:47,438
I'm offering a $100 bonus
to the first man

193
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,431
who brings me a meeting
with a decision maker.

194
00:11:51,329 --> 00:11:54,718
Gentlemen, here's a list of people
you should be having lunch with.

195
00:11:55,358 --> 00:11:57,805
I want you to run into people,
go through old year books.

196
00:11:58,047 --> 00:11:59,097
This means everybody.

197
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:00,722
Writers, too.

198
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:03,869
Bringing in business is the key
to your salary, your status,

199
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:05,020
and your self-worth.

200
00:12:05,262 --> 00:12:06,944
I went to the Athletic Club today,

201
00:12:07,217 --> 00:12:09,542
and I sat in the steam
for an hour and a half.

202
00:12:09,764 --> 00:12:11,235
In that time, I lost 4 pounds

203
00:12:11,477 --> 00:12:13,005
and learned that <i>Kodak</i>
still isn't happy

204
00:12:13,146 --> 00:12:15,030
with the campaign for
the new slide projector.

205
00:12:15,909 --> 00:12:17,324
Is any of this sinking in?

206
00:12:22,021 --> 00:12:24,287
"It's true that
while simply relaxing,"

207
00:12:24,533 --> 00:12:27,177
"I can get all the benefits
of calisthenics."

208
00:12:27,409 --> 00:12:30,809
"A simple regimen of
three 20-minute sessions per week,"

209
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:34,742
"combined with a sensible diet,
will restore your youthful glow."

210
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,396
"I love the way it makes me feel."

211
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,216
"The Relax-a-Cizor."

212
00:12:39,503 --> 00:12:41,444
"It's my little secret."

213
00:12:43,683 --> 00:12:44,939
Thank you, Annie.

214
00:12:46,248 --> 00:12:48,420
One more time... Rita.

215
00:12:50,426 --> 00:12:52,186
"I never thought
it would happen to me,"

216
00:12:52,347 --> 00:12:54,792
"but I regained my youth
and my happiness."

217
00:12:55,412 --> 00:12:56,987
- Todd?
- "Just ask my husband--"

218
00:12:57,141 --> 00:12:58,907
I think we're both going
to agree on Annie.

219
00:12:59,242 --> 00:13:00,242
Which one is Annie?

220
00:13:02,758 --> 00:13:04,037
Believe it or not, I like Rita.

221
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,003
She's got that voice:

222
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,126
randy and knowing.
Like the Relax-a-Cizor.

223
00:13:09,853 --> 00:13:12,629
Annie belongs on TV with
Rita's voice dubbed in.

224
00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:16,926
Norma, thank you. You can go.

225
00:13:20,127 --> 00:13:21,285
Whatever the...

226
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,166
special properties
of the Relax-a-Cizor are,

227
00:13:25,043 --> 00:13:27,154
what we are selling is confidence,

228
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:29,004
a better you.

229
00:13:29,394 --> 00:13:31,301
That woman isn't a better anything.

230
00:13:31,662 --> 00:13:34,359
Annie is a confident,
beautiful woman,

231
00:13:34,601 --> 00:13:36,561
and you can hear it in her voice.

232
00:13:36,744 --> 00:13:38,697
I can't believe
I'm in this argument.

233
00:13:39,161 --> 00:13:40,540
Sorry about that, Rita.

234
00:13:40,994 --> 00:13:42,618
Hi, Annie. We'll do this tomorrow.

235
00:13:43,035 --> 00:13:45,412
<i>Check with Peggy here
for your session.</i>

236
00:13:47,597 --> 00:13:50,497
If I get a hard time about this,
I'm telling people it was your idea.

237
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:51,857
It was my idea.

238
00:14:06,091 --> 00:14:08,379
Just a minute, I'll be right back.

239
00:14:12,673 --> 00:14:14,140
Do you have to ?

240
00:14:17,581 --> 00:14:19,553
That's... risky business.

241
00:14:21,464 --> 00:14:22,732
It is, isn't it ?

242
00:14:28,108 --> 00:14:29,352
What darling?

243
00:14:30,092 --> 00:14:31,583
You can say anything to me.

244
00:14:39,233 --> 00:14:42,039
I can't provide for a child

245
00:14:43,225 --> 00:14:44,505
on what I make.

246
00:14:46,006 --> 00:14:47,558
Don't worry about that.

247
00:14:51,441 --> 00:14:52,815
How can I know?

248
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,257
You can't.

249
00:14:57,089 --> 00:14:57,911
Really?

250
00:14:59,452 --> 00:15:01,143
You can't worry about that.

251
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:12,957
So stay here.

252
00:15:41,293 --> 00:15:42,154
Hi, Birdie.

253
00:15:47,487 --> 00:15:49,988
It's 9:30. Why didn't you
just stay in the city?

254
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:53,081
I have work to do here as well.

255
00:15:54,232 --> 00:15:56,572
Do you know where
the slide projector is?

256
00:15:57,555 --> 00:15:59,026
So you're not going to
see us for four days,

257
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:00,646
and you're not going to see us now.

258
00:16:01,373 --> 00:16:02,841
Right when I walk in the door?

259
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:07,721
I'm sorry.

260
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:10,432
I'm sorry. I just...

261
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,291
I had a terrible day.

262
00:16:15,918 --> 00:16:17,017
Sit with me.

263
00:16:26,471 --> 00:16:27,365
What happened?

264
00:16:31,794 --> 00:16:34,539
Francine told me Carlton has been
having an affair.

265
00:16:37,732 --> 00:16:38,732
Really.

266
00:16:40,591 --> 00:16:42,923
She was in pieces, Don.
I didn't know what to say to her.

267
00:16:43,455 --> 00:16:45,005
Well, what couldyou say?

268
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:47,636
I'm surprised she told you.

269
00:16:48,482 --> 00:16:49,482
Why?

270
00:16:50,043 --> 00:16:51,640
She's like a sister to me.

271
00:16:52,724 --> 00:16:53,858
Of course she is.

272
00:16:59,475 --> 00:17:00,966
I never liked Carlton.

273
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:03,597
He was never my favorite.

274
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:06,567
She should poison him.

275
00:17:07,982 --> 00:17:09,741
Now you think she should kill him?

276
00:17:09,983 --> 00:17:13,161
How could someone do that
to the person that they love?

277
00:17:14,535 --> 00:17:16,648
That they have children with?

278
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,766
Doesn't this all mean anything?

279
00:17:23,683 --> 00:17:26,133
Who knows why people
do what they do?

280
00:17:38,088 --> 00:17:39,234
Come on.

281
00:17:40,204 --> 00:17:41,495
Bring the wine.

282
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:56,509
It's actually, a hell of a gadget.

283
00:17:56,798 --> 00:17:58,623
Continuous, doesn't jam.

284
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:01,084
They call it the Doughnut
or the Wheel.

285
00:18:01,326 --> 00:18:03,420
They're expecting something
along those lines.

286
00:18:03,662 --> 00:18:06,631
<i>Kodak</i> reinvented the wheel.
They're going to hear that 10 times.

287
00:18:06,873 --> 00:18:09,038
They actually want you to use
the words "Research"

288
00:18:09,214 --> 00:18:10,844
and "development" in the ads.

289
00:18:11,524 --> 00:18:13,931
But if you could find a way
to put the Wheel and the Future

290
00:18:14,061 --> 00:18:15,505
into something with some legs,

291
00:18:15,776 --> 00:18:17,809
you could make me look good
my first month here.

292
00:18:29,581 --> 00:18:31,312
"I never thought
it would happen to me,"

293
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:34,056
"but I regained my youth
and my happiness."

294
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:36,494
"Just ask my husband."

295
00:18:37,098 --> 00:18:40,999
"I swear, he looks at me
like the night we met."

296
00:18:41,241 --> 00:18:42,975
"It's true that while
simply relaxing"

297
00:18:43,128 --> 00:18:44,613
"I can get all the benefits of"...

298
00:18:44,754 --> 00:18:46,644
<i>Annie, I'm sorry.
We have to get a level here.</i>

299
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:47,929
No, we don't.

300
00:18:48,954 --> 00:18:50,949
She doesn't sound very confident.

301
00:18:52,202 --> 00:18:53,453
She just started.

302
00:18:54,202 --> 00:18:55,677
Give her a direction.

303
00:18:59,015 --> 00:19:00,015
Okay, Annie.

304
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:02,760
Confidence.

305
00:19:04,887 --> 00:19:05,887
Okay.

306
00:19:06,323 --> 00:19:08,160
"I never thought
it would happen to me,"

307
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:11,001
"but I regained my youth
and my happiness."

308
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:12,987
"Just ask my husband."

309
00:19:13,203 --> 00:19:16,524
"I swear, he looks at me
like the night we met."

310
00:19:16,887 --> 00:19:17,887
<i>Annie.</i>

311
00:19:18,188 --> 00:19:19,913
- Yes?
- <i>Are you married?</i>

312
00:19:20,514 --> 00:19:21,487
No.

313
00:19:21,675 --> 00:19:23,408
I could have told you that.

314
00:19:25,451 --> 00:19:28,497
Well, try and imagine
you're you, Annie,

315
00:19:28,888 --> 00:19:30,182
and now you have everything.

316
00:19:30,342 --> 00:19:31,868
You're beautiful, you're slim,

317
00:19:32,032 --> 00:19:34,921
you're the beloved prize
of a handsome man,

318
00:19:35,677 --> 00:19:39,057
and you have everything
when you use the Relax-a-Cizor.

319
00:19:41,427 --> 00:19:43,716
It's too bad your voice
is so annoying.

320
00:19:44,753 --> 00:19:46,648
"I never thought
it would happen to me,"

321
00:19:47,014 --> 00:19:50,035
"but I regained my youth
and my happiness."

322
00:19:50,453 --> 00:19:51,820
"Just ask my husband."

323
00:19:52,062 --> 00:19:55,365
<i>Hold on, Annie. We have a problem
with the tape recorder.</i>

324
00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:59,014
Say something to her.

325
00:19:59,453 --> 00:20:01,055
Make her feel beautiful.

326
00:20:01,431 --> 00:20:03,533
You know, the confidence
that comes with beauty.

327
00:20:03,714 --> 00:20:06,210
Pegs, a woman who looks like that
will never sound confident

328
00:20:06,351 --> 00:20:07,877
because she never is confident.

329
00:20:08,253 --> 00:20:09,274
*******

330
00:20:09,462 --> 00:20:10,930
Annie has guts to give the bachelor.

331
00:20:11,088 --> 00:20:13,319
The juiciest gazelle
is the easiest to catch.

332
00:20:13,918 --> 00:20:16,748
Can I... I have a bit of
a cold in my throat.

333
00:20:17,087 --> 00:20:18,847
Can I get some pineapple juice?

334
00:20:19,515 --> 00:20:21,303
<i>There's a glass of water
in the corner.<i>

335
00:20:21,443 --> 00:20:22,767
<i>It's great for your throat.</i>

336
00:20:24,035 --> 00:20:25,925
I didn't believe that, either.

337
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:29,109
<i>Let's try it again, Annie.</i>

338
00:20:29,956 --> 00:20:32,492
<i>Happy, confident, beautiful.</i>

339
00:20:35,063 --> 00:20:36,716
"I never thought
it would happen to me,"

340
00:20:36,948 --> 00:20:39,801
"but I regained my youth
and my happiness."

341
00:20:40,211 --> 00:20:41,521
"Just ask my husband."

342
00:20:41,756 --> 00:20:43,883
"I swear, he looks at me
like the night"...

343
00:20:43,985 --> 00:20:44,785
Annie.

344
00:20:46,525 --> 00:20:47,542
<i>You're married.</i>

345
00:20:48,275 --> 00:20:50,682
Maybe you put on a few pounds,

346
00:20:50,989 --> 00:20:52,676
but then you got the Relax-a-Cizor,

347
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,874
and you're back to being you,

348
00:20:55,586 --> 00:20:56,586
right now.

349
00:20:58,317 --> 00:21:00,219
I don't know that I understand.

350
00:21:01,689 --> 00:21:03,815
<i>Annie, what don't you understand?</i>

351
00:21:06,037 --> 00:21:07,446
l am being me.

352
00:21:10,577 --> 00:21:13,536
Just give me a second.
I'll get it the way you want it.

353
00:21:16,562 --> 00:21:19,262
"I never thought
it would happen to me, but"...

354
00:21:22,653 --> 00:21:25,788
"I never thought
this would happen to me, but... "

355
00:21:29,603 --> 00:21:32,209
"I never thought
it would happen to me, but"...

356
00:21:33,747 --> 00:21:34,589
Look Pegs,

357
00:21:34,831 --> 00:21:36,859
******* in front of me

358
00:21:37,305 --> 00:21:38,585
Don't do that to me.

359
00:21:38,814 --> 00:21:40,845
Kenny, be professionnel would you.

360
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:44,849
This is not working out.
We're going to have to let you go.

361
00:21:46,857 --> 00:21:49,472
You could have gone
in there and said that.

362
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:56,861
In this order,

363
00:21:57,242 --> 00:22:00,354
I want you to go after her
and console her.

364
00:22:01,509 --> 00:22:03,494
And after you make plans

365
00:22:03,705 --> 00:22:06,389
or whatever you need to do,
call Rita.

366
00:22:06,741 --> 00:22:08,044
The older lady you liked?

367
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:11,273
She's probably home with
the Relax-a-Cizor right now.

368
00:23:07,132 --> 00:23:08,815
Can you get me the...

369
00:23:09,695 --> 00:23:11,895
Brighton Hotel, Times Square?

370
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:17,029
- Brighton.
- <i>Yes.</i>

371
00:23:17,932 --> 00:23:20,320
<i>Sorry to bother you so late.
I'm looking for someone.</i>

372
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,253
A tenant of yours some...

373
00:23:23,545 --> 00:23:24,532
some months back.

374
00:23:24,773 --> 00:23:25,773
A guest.

375
00:23:27,193 --> 00:23:29,708
I'd love to know if he left
a forwarding address.

376
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,499
His name is... Adam Whitman.

377
00:23:32,741 --> 00:23:34,743
Right. Can I ask what you want?

378
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:37,063
Just a forwarding address.

379
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:38,952
I'm trying to contact him.

380
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,948
He has red hair...

381
00:23:41,923 --> 00:23:43,180
over 6 feet.

382
00:23:43,564 --> 00:23:46,221
<i>Now, listen.
I know who you're talking about.</i>

383
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:48,964
Jesus, I...

384
00:23:50,274 --> 00:23:53,061
hate to be the one to tell you this,
but he hung himself.

385
00:23:54,773 --> 00:23:55,773
What?

386
00:23:59,208 --> 00:24:00,342
Adam Whitman.

387
00:24:01,211 --> 00:24:02,153
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

388
00:24:03,118 --> 00:24:05,490
Left the building a bunch of money.
The city took it.

389
00:24:06,047 --> 00:24:07,397
It was in the Post.

390
00:24:10,723 --> 00:24:12,914
I hate to be the one
to give that news.

391
00:25:58,955 --> 00:25:59,955
<i>Hello.</i>

392
00:26:01,959 --> 00:26:03,903
Yes. Hello.

393
00:26:06,488 --> 00:26:07,704
<i>Who is this?</i>

394
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,353
Who is this?

395
00:26:13,234 --> 00:26:14,577
This is Dr. Arnold Wayne.

396
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,339
Mrs. Albertson, I have warned you,
this is inappropriate.

397
00:26:57,278 --> 00:26:58,329
Are we on fire?

398
00:27:00,144 --> 00:27:01,144
Don.

399
00:27:02,589 --> 00:27:03,653
No. I...

400
00:27:04,524 --> 00:27:06,587
dropped a cigarette
in my waste basket.

401
00:27:07,266 --> 00:27:09,591
Harry, come here.
I want to talk to you.

402
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:31,521
Harry, I want to talk to you.

403
00:27:32,807 --> 00:27:34,157
I can explain.

404
00:27:36,605 --> 00:27:38,578
What is the benefit of that thing?

405
00:27:44,649 --> 00:27:46,878
it sells projectors to people
who already have them.

406
00:27:47,585 --> 00:27:48,860
Yeah, the Wheel.

407
00:27:49,775 --> 00:27:52,190
Stacks, you store your slides in it,

408
00:27:52,958 --> 00:27:54,198
and it's ready to go.

409
00:27:54,379 --> 00:27:56,429
I took pictures for the paper
at Wisconsin.

410
00:27:56,671 --> 00:27:58,771
The machinery is definitely
part of the fun.

411
00:27:58,980 --> 00:27:59,932
It's mechanical.

412
00:28:00,426 --> 00:28:01,851
What did you take pictures of?

413
00:28:02,333 --> 00:28:04,061
Girls, mostly.

414
00:28:04,517 --> 00:28:07,026
You could go up and ask them
their names afterwards

415
00:28:07,207 --> 00:28:09,699
like you were going to
put it in the paper.

416
00:28:10,465 --> 00:28:12,961
And some other stuff.
Artsy-craftsy stuff.

417
00:28:13,934 --> 00:28:15,072
Think of it hell about it.

418
00:28:15,636 --> 00:28:16,904
Artsy, like what?

419
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:20,309
Like the reflection of a tree in a pond?

420
00:28:20,882 --> 00:28:22,115
Worse.

421
00:28:22,336 --> 00:28:25,741
I did a whole series that was just

422
00:28:26,024 --> 00:28:27,816
handprints on glass.

423
00:28:29,503 --> 00:28:31,534
You know, the way it fogs up
around your heat.

424
00:28:31,722 --> 00:28:33,319
And take it off, take a picture.

425
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:35,630
Black and white, I suppose.

426
00:28:35,782 --> 00:28:36,636
Of course.

427
00:28:38,743 --> 00:28:42,066
I was always fascinated by the cave
paintings of Lascaux.

428
00:28:42,411 --> 00:28:44,685
They're, like, 17,000 years old.

429
00:28:45,914 --> 00:28:48,198
The bison get all the attention,

430
00:28:48,762 --> 00:28:51,146
but there are also
all of these handprints,

431
00:28:51,351 --> 00:28:52,820
tiny by today's standards,

432
00:28:52,976 --> 00:28:55,571
with paint blown all around them.

433
00:28:56,466 --> 00:28:58,079
Signature of the artist.

434
00:29:00,718 --> 00:29:03,031
But I thought it was like someone...

435
00:29:04,028 --> 00:29:07,104
reaching through the stone
and right to us.

436
00:29:09,697 --> 00:29:10,885
"I was here."

437
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:19,136
Are you okay?

438
00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:21,619
That'll be all.

439
00:30:24,263 --> 00:30:25,257
Glen?

440
00:30:26,691 --> 00:30:28,581
I'm not supposed to talk to you.

441
00:30:31,611 --> 00:30:32,793
Who says... Who said that?

442
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,451
My mother and my father.

443
00:30:37,541 --> 00:30:38,628
I don't care.

444
00:30:42,387 --> 00:30:44,406
My mother's going to come out.

445
00:30:46,931 --> 00:30:48,065
I don't care.

446
00:30:54,818 --> 00:30:55,818
Glen...

447
00:30:57,894 --> 00:30:59,456
I can't talk to anyone.

448
00:31:02,447 --> 00:31:03,785
It's so horrible.

449
00:31:08,952 --> 00:31:10,074
I'm so sad.

450
00:31:25,395 --> 00:31:26,506
Don't cry.

451
00:31:31,442 --> 00:31:32,442
Please...

452
00:31:36,257 --> 00:31:38,138
Please tell me I'll be okay.

453
00:31:41,147 --> 00:31:42,316
I don't know.

454
00:31:44,846 --> 00:31:46,232
I wish I was older.

455
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:50,313
Adults don't know anything, Glen.

456
00:31:55,233 --> 00:31:58,254
I don't really
know how long 20 minutes is.

457
00:32:01,727 --> 00:32:03,131
Of course, dear.

458
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:16,848
Don, I hope I'm not bothering you.

459
00:32:18,215 --> 00:32:22,148
I just wanted to let you know
I took Duck's talk very seriously.

460
00:32:22,812 --> 00:32:25,281
And without having to crack
my Deerfield yearbook,

461
00:32:25,845 --> 00:32:27,408
I've brought in an account.

462
00:32:28,435 --> 00:32:29,691
Good for you.

463
00:32:30,523 --> 00:32:32,367
It's a piece of
Vicks Chemical Company.

464
00:32:32,656 --> 00:32:33,497
Clearasil.

465
00:32:34,692 --> 00:32:37,710
Better potential than any traditional
pharmaceutical, I believe.

466
00:32:38,098 --> 00:32:40,012
That's a real account, Campbell.

467
00:32:41,067 --> 00:32:42,339
How'd that happen?

468
00:32:42,651 --> 00:32:44,541
I'm not embarrassed to say
my father-in-law's

469
00:32:44,698 --> 00:32:46,886
a former salesman,
now executive there.

470
00:32:47,577 --> 00:32:48,721
That's generous.

471
00:32:50,146 --> 00:32:52,037
He's interested in my future.

472
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:55,008
Congratulations. I'm sure,
with a little bit of lawyering,

473
00:32:55,826 --> 00:32:57,451
you're entitled to that bonus.

474
00:32:57,615 --> 00:32:58,814
I got the bonus.

475
00:32:59,056 --> 00:33:01,484
And Cooper gave me
some book by <i>Ayn Rand</i>*.

476
00:33:02,509 --> 00:33:04,361
He seemed assured,
as I hope you are,

477
00:33:04,603 --> 00:33:07,031
that I have a significant investment
in this company.

478
00:33:09,569 --> 00:33:11,452
Well, you do now, don't you?

479
00:33:12,866 --> 00:33:15,144
It matters to me that
you're impressed.

480
00:33:17,886 --> 00:33:18,886
I am.

481
00:33:22,326 --> 00:33:23,911
Self-worth and status.

482
00:33:25,996 --> 00:33:27,009
You said it.

483
00:34:11,195 --> 00:34:12,294
Thanksgiving.

484
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:18,570
It's very n-nerve-wracking,
having to deal with getting

485
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:20,461
the family together.

486
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:23,924
My mother didn't...

487
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:28,129
cook last year
because she was so sick.

488
00:34:30,202 --> 00:34:32,961
And now I'm going to have
to deal with Gloria.

489
00:34:37,942 --> 00:34:40,208
But it is Thanksgiving, and...

490
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:43,043
I'm grateful for things.

491
00:34:47,034 --> 00:34:48,133
Like this.

492
00:34:48,968 --> 00:34:51,140
This... has helped.

493
00:34:53,301 --> 00:34:55,333
Don doesn't think so, but it has.

494
00:35:01,603 --> 00:35:02,929
Being able to talk.

495
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:07,610
Just... Just me and you
and your little pad.

496
00:35:09,706 --> 00:35:10,951
It has helped.

497
00:35:13,608 --> 00:35:14,742
Still, I...

498
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:19,074
I can't help but think
that I would be happy

499
00:35:21,088 --> 00:35:23,495
if my husband was faithful to me.

500
00:35:34,056 --> 00:35:37,773
My brother's children are
very badly behaved, and...

501
00:35:38,634 --> 00:35:39,558
he spanks them.

502
00:35:41,272 --> 00:35:43,604
Don has never laid
a hand on the kids.

503
00:35:44,272 --> 00:35:45,811
He's kind inside.

504
00:35:49,769 --> 00:35:51,073
But outside, it...

505
00:35:54,532 --> 00:35:57,044
...it's all there in my face every day.

506
00:35:59,481 --> 00:36:00,890
The hotel rooms.

507
00:36:04,367 --> 00:36:05,853
Sometimes perfume.

508
00:36:09,118 --> 00:36:10,118
Or worse.

509
00:36:13,717 --> 00:36:15,344
He doesn't know what family is.

510
00:36:17,369 --> 00:36:18,994
He doesn't even have one.

511
00:36:21,015 --> 00:36:22,882
It makes me sorry for him...

512
00:36:27,855 --> 00:36:29,252
...when in fact I...

513
00:36:30,245 --> 00:36:31,626
I should be angry...

514
00:36:33,118 --> 00:36:34,663
very angry. You know?

515
00:36:36,877 --> 00:36:40,513
But I put up with it
like some ostrich.

516
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:48,407
It's interesting, isn't it?

517
00:37:14,684 --> 00:37:15,842
The way he m...

518
00:37:16,557 --> 00:37:17,726
he makes love?

519
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:23,134
Sometimes it's what I want.

520
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:30,694
But sometimes it's obviously
what someone else wants.

521
00:37:47,422 --> 00:37:49,958
I suppose it means I'm not enough.

522
00:37:58,681 --> 00:37:59,938
But maybe it...

523
00:38:01,997 --> 00:38:03,307
...it's just him.

524
00:38:15,579 --> 00:38:17,007
Don Draper and Salvatore Romano,

525
00:38:17,249 --> 00:38:19,177
this is Joe Harriman
and Lynn Taylor.

526
00:38:20,085 --> 00:38:22,721
No Eastmans today, unfortunately.
They're all back in the lab.

527
00:38:23,156 --> 00:38:25,974
It's a wonderful facility,
but they don't take vacations.

528
00:38:26,216 --> 00:38:28,102
What do they show,
slides of them working?

529
00:38:31,374 --> 00:38:33,923
So, have you figured out a way
to work the Wheel into it?

530
00:38:34,115 --> 00:38:36,968
We know it's hard because wheels
aren't really seen as exciting

531
00:38:37,137 --> 00:38:39,196
technology, even though
they are the original.

532
00:38:41,434 --> 00:38:44,663
Technology is a glittering lure,

533
00:38:45,666 --> 00:38:49,024
but there's the rare occasion
when the public can be engaged

534
00:38:49,189 --> 00:38:50,874
on the level beyond flash,

535
00:38:51,876 --> 00:38:54,621
if they have a sentimental bond
with the product.

536
00:38:56,506 --> 00:38:57,339
My first job,

537
00:38:58,058 --> 00:39:00,175
I was in-house at a fur company
with this old pro

538
00:39:01,249 --> 00:39:03,326
copyrighter, a Greek named Teddy.

539
00:39:04,319 --> 00:39:08,058
And Teddy told me the most
important idea in advertising

540
00:39:08,606 --> 00:39:10,191
is "New".

541
00:39:11,523 --> 00:39:12,764
Creates an itch.

542
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:15,625
You simply put your product
in there as a kind of...

543
00:39:15,784 --> 00:39:17,025
calamine lotion.

544
00:39:18,234 --> 00:39:19,653
But he also talked about

545
00:39:20,047 --> 00:39:22,558
a deeper bond with the product.

546
00:39:23,932 --> 00:39:24,996
Nostalgia.

547
00:39:26,307 --> 00:39:27,540
It's delicate...

548
00:39:29,482 --> 00:39:30,557
...but potent.

549
00:39:32,122 --> 00:39:33,122
Sweetheart.

550
00:39:44,151 --> 00:39:45,948
Teddy told me that in Greek.

551
00:39:46,339 --> 00:39:50,476
"Nostalgia" literally means
the pain from an old wound.

552
00:39:56,140 --> 00:40:00,974
It's a twinge in your heart far
more powerful than memory alone.

553
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:05,869
This device...

554
00:40:06,885 --> 00:40:08,259
isn't a space ship.

555
00:40:09,827 --> 00:40:11,400
It's a time machine.

556
00:40:15,903 --> 00:40:18,416
It goes backwards, forwards.

557
00:40:23,786 --> 00:40:28,424
It takes us to a place where
we ache to go again.

558
00:40:35,337 --> 00:40:36,981
It's not called the Wheel.

559
00:40:39,308 --> 00:40:41,068
It's called the Carousel.

560
00:40:45,439 --> 00:40:48,632
It lets us travel
the way a child travels.

561
00:40:51,216 --> 00:40:53,663
Around and around
and back home again...

562
00:40:59,319 --> 00:41:02,043
...to a place where
we know we are loved.

563
00:41:37,867 --> 00:41:39,626
Good luck at your next meeting.

564
00:41:44,482 --> 00:41:46,678
Don, I have to warn you,
I'm not alone.

565
00:41:46,984 --> 00:41:48,106
It was beautiful.

566
00:41:48,309 --> 00:41:50,053
Congratulations, <i>mein Kommandant</i>.

567
00:41:51,036 --> 00:41:52,262
They called from the lobby.

568
00:41:52,485 --> 00:41:54,587
They cancelled their other meetings,
including DDB.

569
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:57,603
Not just a victory for us.
It's a victory for civilization.

570
00:41:58,528 --> 00:41:59,985
There's also more celebrating.

571
00:42:00,517 --> 00:42:03,034
Mr. Campbell, here.
Your father-in-law called.

572
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:04,901
He'll be in before Christmas.

573
00:42:05,287 --> 00:42:06,778
I've got to get married.

574
00:42:08,272 --> 00:42:09,852
No, thank you. I'm good.

575
00:42:15,737 --> 00:42:17,623
- Here's how.
- Cheers.

576
00:42:21,173 --> 00:42:22,691
You know what, Pete?

577
00:42:23,546 --> 00:42:26,757
I've got a way for you to turn
this account into a home run.

578
00:42:26,999 --> 00:42:27,919
He's on a roll.

579
00:42:29,501 --> 00:42:30,417
<i>Clearasil</i>.

580
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:32,608
You know who buys that?

581
00:42:33,348 --> 00:42:34,470
Young girls.

582
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:37,809
What a difference it makes
in their lives to be blemish-free.

583
00:42:38,285 --> 00:42:39,686
I believe it does.

584
00:42:40,036 --> 00:42:42,251
We have the perfect writer for that.

585
00:42:43,649 --> 00:42:44,691
Peggy Olsen.

586
00:42:46,537 --> 00:42:47,765
That's funny.

587
00:42:48,364 --> 00:42:51,365
Freddy Rumsen and I were both
very impressed with her insight.

588
00:42:51,607 --> 00:42:53,263
- Freddy Rumsen.
- If I can weigh in...

589
00:42:54,026 --> 00:42:55,585
Come on. That <i>Belle Jolie</i> thing.

590
00:42:55,742 --> 00:42:57,682
Plus you should have seen her
in that booth yesterday.

591
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,208
She was like Kinsey but with balls.

592
00:43:00,409 --> 00:43:01,833
Stop joking already, will you, Don?

593
00:43:02,075 --> 00:43:03,103
Excuse me?

594
00:43:04,228 --> 00:43:05,829
This is my father-in-law.

595
00:43:06,539 --> 00:43:09,733
He's expecting the very best.
I'm expecting the very best,

596
00:43:10,479 --> 00:43:13,762
not some little girl
who'll walk away.

597
00:43:14,768 --> 00:43:17,224
You'll have to give back
that copy of <i>Ayn Rand</i>.

598
00:43:17,424 --> 00:43:19,477
Do you know how hard I worked
to get this account?

599
00:43:19,635 --> 00:43:21,398
- Who the hell is she?
- Peggy is not even

600
00:43:21,906 --> 00:43:23,647
a copywriter.
She's a... a secretary.

601
00:43:23,889 --> 00:43:24,915
Peggy!

602
00:43:25,516 --> 00:43:26,702
Yes, Mr. Draper?

603
00:43:26,964 --> 00:43:27,859
Miss Olsen,

604
00:43:28,479 --> 00:43:30,654
you are now a junior copywriter.

605
00:43:30,914 --> 00:43:32,030
Your first account

606
00:43:32,272 --> 00:43:35,104
will be delivering <i>Clearasil</i>
to the spotted masses.

607
00:43:35,567 --> 00:43:36,374
What?

608
00:43:36,777 --> 00:43:38,286
Don't act surprised.

609
00:43:39,363 --> 00:43:40,789
Is this really happening?

610
00:43:42,849 --> 00:43:43,792
Yes, it is.

611
00:43:45,383 --> 00:43:46,541
My goodness.

612
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:51,120
I will do my sincere best.

613
00:43:54,353 --> 00:43:55,353
Good to hear.

614
00:43:56,112 --> 00:43:59,230
Mr. Campbell, here,
will brief you after the holiday.

615
00:44:03,915 --> 00:44:04,915
Of course.

616
00:44:06,301 --> 00:44:07,399
That'll be all.

617
00:44:08,294 --> 00:44:09,804
Thank you, Mr. Draper.

618
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:16,895
I said congratulations, didn't I?

619
00:44:18,166 --> 00:44:20,531
Although sometimes when
people get what they want,

620
00:44:20,779 --> 00:44:22,800
they realize how
limited their goals were.

621
00:44:23,084 --> 00:44:25,132
So I guess I'll put you in
with Victor Manning.

622
00:44:25,261 --> 00:44:26,235
David Steuben got fired.

623
00:44:27,541 --> 00:44:28,541
Fired?

624
00:44:28,729 --> 00:44:30,415
People hated his work.

625
00:44:31,583 --> 00:44:32,758
Will I get business cards?

626
00:44:34,925 --> 00:44:37,438
Please make all your requests
through Bridget.

627
00:44:37,730 --> 00:44:38,539
Of course.

628
00:44:38,679 --> 00:44:39,886
Peggy, I know you know it all.

629
00:44:40,129 --> 00:44:42,617
Remember, just because
you now have a door,

630
00:44:42,766 --> 00:44:44,832
don't forget that once you didn't.

631
00:44:45,543 --> 00:44:47,773
Think of the other girls,
or they won't think of you.

632
00:44:50,211 --> 00:44:52,591
Vic Manning, I'd like you
to meet Peggy Olsen.

633
00:44:52,756 --> 00:44:54,445
She'll be taking Mr. Steuben's desk.

634
00:44:54,603 --> 00:44:55,890
Nice to meet you.

635
00:44:57,676 --> 00:44:59,244
I don't feel so swell.

636
00:45:00,096 --> 00:45:01,427
I think I should go home.

637
00:45:01,667 --> 00:45:03,366
I have to stop eating off the cart.

638
00:45:03,516 --> 00:45:05,770
If you're trying to find a way
to go out and celebrate,

639
00:45:05,931 --> 00:45:07,599
you should ask your secretary
to cover for you.

640
00:45:07,751 --> 00:45:08,795
Very funny.

641
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:13,089
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- You, too, Joan.

642
00:45:14,121 --> 00:45:15,554
David and I have a deal.

643
00:45:15,706 --> 00:45:18,303
No meetings in here, okay.
And no music.

644
00:45:33,303 --> 00:45:34,702
What can we do for you today?

645
00:45:34,856 --> 00:45:36,670
My stomach hurts really bad.

646
00:45:37,935 --> 00:45:39,805
I think I had a bad sandwich.

647
00:45:40,627 --> 00:45:42,047
Let's take a look.

648
00:45:50,818 --> 00:45:52,039
My God.

649
00:45:52,990 --> 00:45:55,620
Honey, you didn't mention
that you were expecting.

650
00:45:57,259 --> 00:45:58,259
What?

651
00:45:58,824 --> 00:46:00,669
You're going to be a mother.

652
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:05,259
That's impossible.

653
00:46:05,377 --> 00:46:06,833
You want us to call your husband

654
00:46:07,093 --> 00:46:08,558
or your boyfriend?

655
00:46:11,457 --> 00:46:13,673
- I don't understand.
- Stop talking.

656
00:46:17,531 --> 00:46:20,115
Now, listen, we're going
to get you up to Maternity.

657
00:46:20,276 --> 00:46:22,601
No. No, that's not possible.

658
00:46:30,657 --> 00:46:32,019
Do you feel that?

659
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:48,155
- My God!
- We need a wheelchair.

660
00:46:48,355 --> 00:46:49,429
It hurts!

661
00:46:49,950 --> 00:46:51,733
It's going to be okay. All right?

662
00:46:51,921 --> 00:46:53,894
- We just want you to calm down.
- You don't understand.

663
00:46:54,047 --> 00:46:55,503
We need a wheelchair!

664
00:46:59,711 --> 00:47:01,649
Have Dr. Wilson in Psychiatry

665
00:47:14,447 --> 00:47:15,797
Hello, darling.

666
00:47:21,706 --> 00:47:23,583
Were they having a party
at the office?

667
00:47:23,735 --> 00:47:24,545
Yes.

668
00:47:26,476 --> 00:47:27,826
I think I should...

669
00:47:28,639 --> 00:47:29,667
lie down.

670
00:47:30,637 --> 00:47:32,299
That's a good idea.

671
00:47:32,551 --> 00:47:34,136
Sure. Rest up.

672
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:36,723
But make sure you're awake later.

673
00:47:37,326 --> 00:47:38,326
Daddy!

674
00:48:04,453 --> 00:48:05,839
Would you like to try to feed him?

675
00:48:10,410 --> 00:48:12,547
Don't you want to hold him,
sweetheart?

676
00:49:01,890 --> 00:49:02,890
Hello?

677
00:49:12,383 --> 00:49:13,522
What are you doing here?

678
00:49:13,639 --> 00:49:15,400
Daddy! Are you coming with us?

679
00:49:16,652 --> 00:49:17,458
No, he isn't.

680
00:49:17,937 --> 00:49:19,288
Daddy has to work.

681
00:49:20,065 --> 00:49:23,122
But you can drive us to the station.
I haven't called the taxi yet.

682
00:49:23,372 --> 00:49:24,753
I'm coming with you.

683
00:49:26,842 --> 00:49:27,882
Really?

684
00:49:29,562 --> 00:49:30,562
You are?

685
00:49:31,173 --> 00:49:34,225
I'll pack the car.
We'll be there before noon.

686
00:49:41,765 --> 00:49:43,564
- Daddy's coming with you.
- Daddy!

687
00:49:56,986 --> 00:49:57,986
Hello?

688
00:50:01,423 --> 00:50:02,423
Hello.

689
00:50:30,469 --> 00:50:33,146
<i>T H E    E N D</i>
