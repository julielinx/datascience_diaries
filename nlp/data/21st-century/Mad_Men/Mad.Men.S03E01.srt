1
00:01:14,674 --> 00:01:19,270
Do you know how hard I've prayed?
Why does he make me suffer?

2
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,143
- God will give you a child.
- Let me see her.

3
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:41,961
- So you killed another one.
- 'Cause you had nothing to do with this.

4
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:44,396
Maybe you ought to stay off her
once in a while.

5
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:46,199
Get out, you witch!

6
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:55,175
<i>I've got 85, and my boots are off.</i>

7
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:58,011
You don't have a sheath.

8
00:01:58,151 --> 00:02:03,521
I'll get one, but that'll be another quarter,
and this is all I have.

9
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:08,351
Go wash yourself.

10
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:18,230
You get me in trouble and I'm gonna
cut your dick off and boil it in hog fat.

11
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:21,701
<i>I'm gonna cut his dick off...</i>

12
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:27,540
I'm gonna cut his dick off
and boil it in hog fat.

13
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:30,405
<i>What was that, sweetheart?</i>

14
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:32,846
I'm cold.

15
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:41,860
Do you want to hold him?

16
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:45,987
I'm gonna cut his dick off
and boil it in hog fat.

17
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:11,423
- It's midnight. What do you want?
- I told you God would give you a child.

18
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,227
Whose is it?

19
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:20,828
Is your husband home?

20
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:27,496
God is giving you a child.

21
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:36,073
His name is Dick, after a wish
his mother should've lived to see.

22
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,320
Come on. Drink this.

23
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:26,263
You know, there's no point
in both of us not sleeping.

24
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:34,035
- She wakes up at night when I drop off.
- You so sure it's a girl?

25
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:37,505
Well, believe me,
she knows what she wants.

26
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:42,910
I packed your valise.

27
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:47,784
- I could have done that.
- Well, you'll get a chance.

28
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:49,650
The clasp is broken.

29
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,953
Carla said she saw Sally hitting it
with a hammer.

30
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:57,621
She's taken to your tools
like a little lesbian.

31
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:16,678
Am I ever going to sleep again?

32
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,513
At least you don't look tired.

33
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:23,947
I just want everything to be perfect.

34
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:27,892
I want her to come into our home
at its best.

35
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:32,455
Close your eyes.

36
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:43,470
- You're on a warm, sandy beach...
- Because I'm a whale.

37
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:50,212
You're on a warm, sandy beach.

38
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:55,453
You can smell the faint scent
of coconut oil.

39
00:05:58,257 --> 00:06:00,316
And as you slide your hands

40
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:05,887
through that cold patch of sand
underneath the shadow of your deck chair...

41
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:07,727
You're good at this.

42
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:13,963
Lola?

43
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,818
Lola. Hello?

44
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,854
Yes, but on occasion,

45
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:33,016
you have to resign yourself
to sleeping where you are.

46
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:35,924
That's why they sell subway tokens, silly.

47
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:38,922
Lola.

48
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:44,226
- You're looking lovely today.
- Thank you. Are you here to see me?

49
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:49,102
No, I'm just verifying some information.
Thank you, Lola.

50
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:57,805
He just always stops by
concerning the strangest things.

51
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:01,516
- Yesterday it was my engagement ring.
- Enough, Lola.

52
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:04,345
You know there's something
about the way he talks.

53
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:06,823
I could listen to him read the phonebook.

54
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:11,056
Well, when he gets to "S,"
I need Howard Sullivan at Lever Brothers.

55
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:17,900
Remarkable.

56
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:22,940
I picked it for its sensuality,
but it also, in some way,

57
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,911
reminds me of our business.

58
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:31,372
Who is the man who imagined her ecstasy?

59
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:34,216
Who indeed?

60
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:42,191
- We were just talking about you.
- Burt's on his way. Where's Roger?

61
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:46,357
Probably taking another Grecian treasure
out of its crate.

62
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:49,835
I apologize for Baltimore. It has to be done.

63
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:52,364
It's a sales call.
Isn't there more I can do here?

64
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,908
It's not a sales call.
You're the face of our business.

65
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:59,343
They need someone they can trust.

66
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:03,746
London Fog. How ludicrous.

67
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,145
- Really? I have one.
- So do I.

68
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,048
No, of course. It's just the name.

69
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:14,155
There is no fog in London.
There is no London fog.

70
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:18,428
- Are you sure about that?
- Quite. Never was.

71
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:23,525
It was the coal dust from the industrial era.
Charles Dickens and whatnot.

72
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,071
<i>Mr. Cooper, Mr. Peterson is here to see you.</i>

73
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:33,838
- Come on in, Burt.
- Hey, Don. Bert, Lane.

74
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:39,275
- We need you to have a seat, Burt.
- Okay.

75
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,491
You got a blindfold, too?

76
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:50,686
This isn't easy.

77
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:56,099
- It really isn't.
- Oh, God.

78
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,198
I really thought I'd made it.

79
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:03,938
I know it's unkind,
but it's generous and it's fair.

80
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,215
- Well, why the hell did you wait so long?
- It was brought to our attention

81
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:14,548
that your wife was undergoing radiation.
We thought it decent to wait.

82
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:17,313
That was decent.

83
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:21,149
Sorry I'm late. Did I miss anything?

84
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:28,494
Sad meeting. Sorry about that.

85
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:32,771
It wasn't easy.

86
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:36,137
- We'll see how you do without my Rolodex.
- We're going to take that risk.

87
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,734
You make me sick. You're the dying empire.

88
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:42,671
- We're the future.
- Burt, control yourself.

89
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:48,084
- No, I'm the head of accounts, damn it!
- I'm sure we'll regret it. I'm serious.

90
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,590
See you on the breadlines, fellas.

91
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,629
Is that the last of it?

92
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,563
Because I don't like how much
I'm getting used to these.

93
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:05,228
I don't know anything you don't know.

94
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,201
You understand there's no point ever
in making over $40,000

95
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:13,369
when you'll be taxed 69%?
You're working for them.

96
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:16,539
And God forbid you really make it.
Everything over 70 grand is 81%.

97
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:19,709
- Even if you're married?
- Fellow comrades in mediocrity,

98
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:24,415
I want you to listen very carefully.
You can all go straight to hell.

99
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:38,063
I heard he's going in-house at Nabisco.

100
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:41,899
- You're sure it's not starting again?
- Mr. Campbell's office.

101
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:43,270
- What?
- I'll let him know.

102
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:46,868
- The firings.
- Mr. Campbell, Mr. Pryce wants to see you.

103
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:51,550
- I'm at lunch.
- I'll bring you a doggy bag.

104
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,785
Holy crap.

105
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:01,354
You couldn't have pulled me aside
to say that?

106
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,859
I'm sure it's nothing.

107
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:05,863
How the hell am I supposed
to live like this?

108
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,828
Drop dead, you limey vulture!

109
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:13,961
Son of a bitch!

110
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:18,572
I assume you can continue
to handle this beautifully

111
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:21,579
while I dispense psychotherapy
to the girls in the pool.

112
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:24,241
You Americans don't know
how to handle your emotions.

113
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,783
It's unbecoming.

114
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:29,946
His wife is sick. And if you had talked
to his girl, she would've informed him.

115
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:32,820
So he would've had a longer walk
to Mr. Cooper's?

116
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:34,324
And if you had talked to me,

117
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:37,362
I would have been waiting
with his coat and his Rolodex.

118
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:39,226
While we're on the topic of decorum,

119
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:42,300
I'd like to speak with you
about the way I'm being addressed.

120
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:43,993
Could you be more specific?

121
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:47,834
The switchboard. I'm not John.
I'm Mr. Hooker.

122
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:51,871
That's the way they've been taught
to address the secretaries.

123
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:55,435
Yes, well, as I've explained,
in Great Britain...

124
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:59,780
A truck is a lorry and an elevator is a lift.
I've got it, Mr. Hooker.

125
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:03,053
Despite your title, you are not a secretary.

126
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:07,917
- I'm Mr. Pryce's right arm. I'm not his typist.
- Of course.

127
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:10,528
Good luck, everybody. Good luck!

128
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:15,630
I assume you will let him know
when Mr. Peterson has left the building.

129
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:26,038
- How are we today?
- Very well, thank you.

130
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:31,344
- Burt Peterson's left the agency.
- Really?

131
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:38,388
Yes. I can't speak for everyone here,
but I like you.

132
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:43,955
- And I like you.
- But you don't know me.

133
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:47,364
But I will make that effort,
if given the opportunity.

134
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:48,626
Pardon?

135
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:53,535
I apologize that I haven't been
more welcoming, socially.

136
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:56,130
It seemed until your wife arrives...

137
00:12:57,343 --> 00:13:00,506
I didn't want to make it awkward
with a threesome.

138
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:02,609
Although, now that I think of it,
perhaps your being alone

139
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:04,910
is all the more reason
I should've offered my hospitality.

140
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:07,451
- Do have a seat.
- Why?

141
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:10,349
Is something wrong?

142
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,949
I don't know. You just removed
the head of my department,

143
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:15,390
and now you're offering me a chair.

144
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:20,261
How cruel of me. I wanted to inform you
that you're now head of accounts.

145
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:26,398
- Excuse me?
- It seemed like the right thing to do,

146
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:29,038
despite your lack of hospitality.

147
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:33,772
The specifics are pending,
as is the announcement.

148
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:38,315
Is this really happening?
I need to know it's certain.

149
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,350
Yes, but...

150
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:50,159
- Wonderful. Thank you.
- Splendid.

151
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:04,232
- Well, it turns out things are splendid.
- That's good.

152
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:07,068
Could you get my wife on the phone?

153
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:27,558
<i>I have Mrs. Campbell for you.</i>

154
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:33,203
<i>- How are you, sweetheart?
- What are you doing?</i>

155
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:36,497
I know I told you this morning.
I'm having luncheon,

156
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:38,668
with the Docents' committee from the Met.

157
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:41,371
- How are they?
- Since when do you care?

158
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,581
Since I was made head of accounts.

159
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:46,307
- No!
- Yes.

160
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:50,147
Oh, my goodness! Peter, that's wonderful!

161
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:54,024
It really is.
I knew it would happen one day for real.

162
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,257
- I love the sound of your voice right now.
- That's because I'm already drunk.

163
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:02,767
Good for you. Just one more minute.
My husband got some good news.

164
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:07,271
- Make a reservation. Surprise me.
- Okay.

165
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:12,035
- I should call my mother.
- Peter.

166
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:15,947
Don't go to the well. There's no water there.

167
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:21,117
I don't even know if I'm getting a raise.
I didn't ask. I forgot.

168
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:25,156
That's very noble. You see?
One doesn't need money to be fulfilled.

169
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:28,351
Don't let those ladies from the Met
hear you say that.

170
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:31,258
- I should go.
- Bye.

171
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:39,036
Sorry to interrupt your lunch.

172
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:42,539
I heard you wanted to see me,
so I grabbed a sandwich.

173
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:47,769
- What can I do for you?
- Mr. Peterson's left the agency.

174
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:51,241
If that's your news,
I think you've been scooped.

175
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,749
So you've heard?

176
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:56,514
Let's just say he did not
"go gentle into that good night. "

177
00:15:57,189 --> 00:16:00,420
So you're probably wondering
where that leaves you.

178
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:05,291
- Should I be worried?
- No, I should say not.

179
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:08,798
We're making you head of accounts.

180
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:13,770
Spectacular. Thanks a lot.

181
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,703
We're charting the course
of transition right now.

182
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:20,140
There are many details to come.

183
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:25,272
I wouldn't be much of an account man
if I didn't ask what it pays.

184
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:29,878
I wouldn't be much of a financial officer
if I wasn't prepared to disappoint you.

185
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:33,891
It's 21, but we'll reevaluate this year.

186
00:16:35,627 --> 00:16:39,859
Ken, this is not for broadcast.
There'll be a formal announcement.

187
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:41,725
Great.

188
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:05,150
You believe this?
What is the world coming to?

189
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:09,257
- That is a big bottle.
- That's not a bottle. That's his date.

190
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:14,191
- "My, oh, my, what a big bottle you have. "
- "I'm sorry, honey, but I'm taken.

191
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:19,161
"I just pawned my typewriter
so we could be together all weekend. "

192
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:23,171
The captain's about to announce
our descent into Friendship. Quick refill?

193
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:26,767
I don't know.
Don't you need something to run the plane?

194
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:30,338
- And what about you, Mr. Hofstadt?
- Excuse me?

195
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:34,719
I took a look at your luggage.
You're William Hofstadt?

196
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:41,323
Bill. Call me Bill.
And this is my associate, Mr. Fleischmann.

197
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:44,126
- Sam.
- Shelley.

198
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:49,330
- Are you headed to Baltimore or DC?
- Baltimore.

199
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:52,635
Well, how about that?
We're heading to Hausner's for dinner.

200
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,730
You should've been in line two hours ago
if you want to eat by 8:00.

201
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:59,174
Lorelei has made some inroads
with the maitre d'.

202
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:02,345
Well, we have to check in,
and we have an early meeting.

203
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:05,042
- Where are you staying?
- The Belvedere.

204
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:07,850
Well, this is too much. Us, too.

205
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:14,589
7:30. It'll be a hoot and a half.

206
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:20,926
Now you have to take
someone else's luggage. Bill Hoffman's.

207
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:25,159
Hofstadt. My brother-in-law.

208
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:28,306
He borrowed a suitcase
to go to Puerto Rico,

209
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:32,343
but he never tires of putting his name
on other people's things.

210
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:38,374
I've flown a few times, but I've never
actually seen a stewardess that game.

211
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:40,311
Really?

212
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:44,611
<i>This is your captain...</i>

213
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:49,450
Hello, Kenny. Any plans tonight?

214
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:55,295
All I know is to avoid Grand Central.
I heard Burt Peterson's still at the bar.

215
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:59,367
Oh, no. It had to happen, I guess.

216
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:04,470
He didn't put up much of a fight.
Not counting today, I mean.

217
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:07,807
- It's a tough job.
- No doubt about that.

218
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:29,528
I just want to let you know,
I've always been a big fan of your work,

219
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,402
and I've been very vocal about it.

220
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:35,567
I appreciate that.

221
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:40,040
Maybe now things will finally settle down.

222
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,745
That's true.

223
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:50,413
Listen, I just want to say
that through all of this,

224
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:55,324
I know that you were there reminding me
that I can do this job.

225
00:19:56,628 --> 00:20:00,291
Well, you're welcome.
I guess it's because I think you can.

226
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:05,662
- Have a good night.
- You, too.

227
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:11,741
And my friend and I were listening
to some radio program,

228
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:14,641
and we had this huge bag of Fritos...

229
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:17,545
We're not allowed in uniform...

230
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:21,642
So, at some point my friend stops eating,
but I can't.

231
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:30,026
And I ate all of them and I got so...
It was quite unladylike.

232
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:37,662
- And I still can't eat them to today.
- Too much of a good thing. It happens.

233
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,468
I think accounting sounds fascinating.

234
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:44,235
Going through other people's
bank accounts? It sounds sexy.

235
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:49,404
Jesus, Lorelei, how deep
did you have to dig to come up with that?

236
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:53,179
Why would you insult a man's profession?

237
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,946
No, it's okay. I don't usually tell people
I'm an accountant.

238
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:03,818
Listen, Billy, Sam,
I didn't mean to insult your profession.

239
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:06,053
Don't sweat it.

240
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:12,069
Of course, you do know
there are different kinds of accountants.

241
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:13,601
Are there?

242
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:19,136
- Tell them what we do.
- I don't know, Bill.

243
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:27,081
- I'm gonna have to swear you all to secrecy.
- You can't guarantee that.

244
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:30,620
You're right.

245
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:36,353
Well, someone just brought everything
to a screeching halt.

246
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:37,951
We'll be good.

247
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:46,499
You ever heard of James Hoffa?

248
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:51,008
You know, I don't just throw away
newspapers every day, I also read them.

249
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:54,574
There is a lot of money missing.

250
00:21:55,747 --> 00:21:58,238
And they don't really keep receipts.

251
00:21:59,384 --> 00:22:02,911
- So you're a couple of G-men?
- No, we're accountants.

252
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:12,824
Isn't the service exquisite?
I'm based in New York.

253
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:17,364
I'd always rather be there,
but it's my job to be out of town.

254
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:25,165
I don't know. I keep going to a lot of places

255
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:28,041
and ending up somewhere
I've already been.

256
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:36,120
- How about a nightcap?
- Well, I don't know.

257
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:40,149
Your face is red.

258
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:46,696
Order for us.

259
00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:15,688
Felt self-conscious there for a moment.
We're the only ones without a uniform.

260
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:21,928
- Good night, Bill.
- Sam.

261
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:25,262
Shelley, it's been swelly.

262
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:40,717
- Well, this is me.
- Let me see if it's different than my floor.

263
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:13,977
What are we doing?

264
00:24:16,254 --> 00:24:17,687
I don't know.

265
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:30,666
I'm engaged.

266
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:38,669
On the other hand,
you might be my last chance.

267
00:24:44,282 --> 00:24:48,776
I've been married a long time.
You get plenty of chances.

268
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:01,859
It's my birthday.

269
00:25:04,936 --> 00:25:07,564
Really? Is it?

270
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:11,474
It really is.

271
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:16,445
Let me see your driver's license.

272
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,348
That's not gonna help.

273
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:26,847
Happy birthday.

274
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:10,329
Hello. My air conditioner does not work.
It is stagnant in here.

275
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:15,796
Take your hand out. I can't breathe.

276
00:26:21,813 --> 00:26:23,041
Stand up.

277
00:26:26,117 --> 00:26:30,520
Lorelei thinks you look like Ty Power.
Remember him?

278
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:38,488
Go on.

279
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:53,574
And while you're distracted,
I'm gonna take off my shoes. Is that okay?

280
00:27:04,589 --> 00:27:05,886
Your turn.

281
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:09,020
Not yet.

282
00:27:26,845 --> 00:27:28,210
Do you like?

283
00:27:30,615 --> 00:27:35,018
Everyone's always asking me
if I was a model, but I wasn't.

284
00:27:41,292 --> 00:27:44,989
The one I have at home is different.
Hope I didn't break it.

285
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:50,465
No, it's fine. Just a minute.

286
00:27:53,371 --> 00:27:54,668
Thank you.

287
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:37,275
Airplane.

288
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:52,223
Oh, God.

289
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:09,940
Jesus.

290
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:16,244
- What is that?
- Fire alarm.

291
00:29:19,724 --> 00:29:21,351
Come on, let's go.

292
00:29:27,832 --> 00:29:30,801
Come on. Forget your shoes.
Let's go. Come on.

293
00:29:48,052 --> 00:29:49,246
Come on.

294
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:16,173
Do you have another cigarette?

295
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:25,279
Everything's okay, folks.

296
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:44,668
- Morning.
- Morning.

297
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:49,105
You ever get nervous
wearing that on the subway?

298
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:53,173
I don't ride the subway.
I do worry about being followed, though.

299
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:58,748
I think Lola takes a horse and buggy.
She's never on time.

300
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:02,692
- I'm not at work yet.
- I don't want to sit in my office

301
00:31:02,794 --> 00:31:05,627
and listen to someone
talk about their water retention.

302
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:10,258
- Peggy, brides are very self-conscious.
- If she's so worried about getting married,

303
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:13,860
then why is she shamelessly flirting
with Moneypenny all the time?

304
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:17,840
- Don't call him that. He hates that.
- Are you defending him?

305
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:21,773
He's repellant. Reminds me of a doorman.

306
00:31:23,481 --> 00:31:25,608
And the typing she does for him?

307
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:28,785
Oh, God, I'm so glad
I'm gonna be out of here soon.

308
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:32,414
- That's very comforting, Joan.
- There's nothing I can do.

309
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:38,953
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

310
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:43,426
Mr. Pryce just called. There's a meeting
for the heads of accounts immediately.

311
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:44,558
Excuse me?

312
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:48,161
Mr. Pryce called a big meeting
for you and Mr. Cosgrove.

313
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,499
What are you talking about?

314
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:57,180
Whatever the circumstances,
it's nice to see you.

315
00:31:57,282 --> 00:32:00,115
I'm just here to show you
the continuity of our service.

316
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:03,449
That with or without Burt Peterson,
you are on our mind.

317
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:14,095
- I apologize.
- Morris, you remember Salvatore Romano.

318
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,890
I don't know how,
but I left my plane ticket at the hotel.

319
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:21,461
He's the guy with the marker who always
does what I say. Words, pictures.

320
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:24,137
- Sal, this is Howard.
- Pleasure.

321
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:30,979
- I don't remember... Do you have a family?
- Not yet. I have a wife.

322
00:32:32,517 --> 00:32:36,044
Well, Howard is my son.
He's gonna be part of this from now on,

323
00:32:36,154 --> 00:32:39,282
starting with taking you two gentlemen
on a tour.

324
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:44,323
That's it? You're not gonna say anything?

325
00:32:46,664 --> 00:32:50,293
My father is extremely concerned
about the business right now.

326
00:32:50,401 --> 00:32:52,062
Well, is it about our work?

327
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:54,502
I mean, we don't want
to take credit for everything,

328
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:57,472
but two of every three raincoats
sold last year

329
00:32:57,575 --> 00:32:59,770
had "London Fog"
stitched on the inside pocket.

330
00:32:59,877 --> 00:33:03,711
Dad is worried that everyone who's ever
going to buy a raincoat already has one.

331
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:07,945
Because a business has to get bigger
every year. That's capitalism.

332
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:17,589
Well, our worst fears lie in anticipation.
That's not me, that's Balzac.

333
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:21,398
Balzac, huh? You are not Burt Peterson.

334
00:33:22,066 --> 00:33:24,864
I've been investigating umbrellas,
bags, hats.

335
00:33:24,969 --> 00:33:28,132
There are companies
that all they do is make hats.

336
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:33,909
London Fog is a 40-year-old brand
that sounds like it's existed forever.

337
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:38,711
You've established, with our help,
that it means one thing, raincoats.

338
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:43,520
New products aside, there will be fat years
and there will be lean years,

339
00:33:43,721 --> 00:33:45,655
but it is going to rain.

340
00:33:49,627 --> 00:33:50,992
That's true.

341
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:56,398
Let's see if we can find you some earplugs.

342
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:04,903
Bacardi, Belle Jolie, Birds Eye,
Cadbury, Campbell Soup International,

343
00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:09,109
Cartwright double-sided aluminum,
Chevron oil, Dunkin' Donuts,

344
00:34:09,313 --> 00:34:14,376
General Foods Europe, Kodak,
Lever Brothers, Martinsons, Popsicle,

345
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,882
Relaxacisor, Rio De Janeiro,
which is dormant,

346
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:20,751
United Fruit, Warner Brothers.

347
00:34:22,293 --> 00:34:26,354
And now for Mr. Campbell.
Admiral Television, Alpine Real Estate,

348
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:32,367
Bethlehem Steel, Con Ed, Gillette, Gorton's,
Liberty Capital Savings, Lucky Strike,

349
00:34:32,503 --> 00:34:37,998
Maytag, North American Aviation,
P&G Pampers, Playtex, Samsonite,

350
00:34:38,142 --> 00:34:40,736
Secor Laxatives, Snyder's Ketchup, Utz.

351
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:43,643
- Why does he have Utz?
- Some of this was done based on accounts,

352
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,978
and some of this was done
based on relationships,

353
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,917
and you figure out what happened with Utz.

354
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,279
So you decided all of this?

355
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:53,287
Forty-two cents of every dollar
at this agency

356
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:56,792
is spent in the television department,
but no, we did.

357
00:34:59,363 --> 00:35:01,627
- What are these "O's" for?
- Olson.

358
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:04,324
- She's all over the place.
- You know that's not true.

359
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:06,926
You're each taking half the company.

360
00:35:08,406 --> 00:35:11,341
Of course it's possible
someone could distinguish themselves.

361
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:13,410
Would be easier that way.

362
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:28,315
- Can you believe this?
- If you're upset, you seem to be hiding it.

363
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:31,960
I'm excited.
I mean, I feel badly about Burt Peterson.

364
00:35:32,163 --> 00:35:34,131
Three kids, wife with cancer.

365
00:35:34,232 --> 00:35:37,497
But you greased up the chute
and shoved him down it.

366
00:35:38,169 --> 00:35:40,160
What could possibly be the matter?

367
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:43,798
Why did you even accept this?
You have no interest in this.

368
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:47,139
- Why wouldn't I want this?
- Because you're no good.

369
00:35:48,246 --> 00:35:52,205
They want us to hate each other.
I refuse to participate in that.

370
00:35:53,117 --> 00:35:56,416
Very nice. Very, very nice.

371
00:35:57,822 --> 00:36:00,222
Look at you. Never break a sweat.

372
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:05,091
You're right, I should just lay down and we
should run together, holding hands.

373
00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:23,706
- What time is it?
- 1:15.

374
00:36:25,316 --> 00:36:29,776
- We should be back in the office by 3:00.
- We're going back to the office?

375
00:36:39,664 --> 00:36:41,029
I'm going to ask you something,

376
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:44,158
and I want you
to be completely honest with me.

377
00:36:50,741 --> 00:36:52,072
London Fog.

378
00:36:56,314 --> 00:37:00,410
It's a subway car,
and there's a commuter looking up.

379
00:37:01,452 --> 00:37:06,185
There's a girl with her back to us.
She's wearing one of those short tan ones,

380
00:37:06,324 --> 00:37:08,724
but it's open. Her legs are bare.

381
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:12,196
We know what he's seeing.

382
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:16,628
"Limit your exposure. "

383
00:37:21,105 --> 00:37:22,402
That's it.

384
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:28,436
Good.

385
00:37:41,826 --> 00:37:44,192
Mr. Hooker, may I speak with you?

386
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:52,994
I thought it was a good idea that PPL
had an office for when visitors come.

387
00:37:53,137 --> 00:37:54,570
Of course,
it would make sense for someone

388
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:57,140
to be occupying it in the meantime.

389
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:00,744
I rustled up an office for you.

390
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:03,609
I hope you find it appropriate
to your status.

391
00:38:03,714 --> 00:38:05,079
My position.

392
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,384
It's near Mr. Pryce.
It's not exactly in the thick of things,

393
00:38:08,486 --> 00:38:10,317
but you will have someone
to attend to your typing,

394
00:38:10,421 --> 00:38:12,912
to avoid you siphoning off the man-hours.

395
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:17,017
- My own girl? Of my choosing?
- I will have a lineup.

396
00:38:18,562 --> 00:38:19,927
Did he take the ant farm?

397
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:23,296
No, it's actually Mr. Cooper's.
It just lives there.

398
00:38:28,572 --> 00:38:33,566
Hello, sweetheart. Now, don't be cross.
I'll only be a minute.

399
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:39,016
- Do you have a fever?
- No.

400
00:38:48,859 --> 00:38:52,022
"The buck stops here,"
unless it stops over there.

401
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:54,123
What's the matter?

402
00:38:54,231 --> 00:38:58,327
There's two heads of accounts.
Kenny Cosgrove and I are sharing it.

403
00:39:00,738 --> 00:39:05,402
- I'm so sorry.
- I was sitting there and they just read off

404
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:09,639
a list of names, a list of companies.
That's my life.

405
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:21,287
I know you won't like hearing this,
but you're a lot like my father.

406
00:39:22,593 --> 00:39:23,890
You're an ambitious man,

407
00:39:23,994 --> 00:39:27,122
and an ambitious man is never happy
with what he has.

408
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:31,759
Why does it always have to be like this?
Why can't I get anything good all at once?

409
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:36,966
This is an amazing opportunity.
They believe in you. Don't turn it sour.

410
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:41,042
It's a test. Why not just cut it short
and tell them I want it?

411
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:45,081
You can do whatever you want,
but they do not want to hear your outrage.

412
00:39:45,182 --> 00:39:48,845
- They want you to beat Ken.
- I know what they want, Trudy.

413
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:53,954
And honestly, I don't know.
I can't live with this!

414
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:01,721
But you'll try.

415
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:13,237
It's great. It's a great ad.
So, how was everything in Baltimore?

416
00:40:14,011 --> 00:40:15,945
Out of town. Don Draper.

417
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,439
- It was first class.
- Go on.

418
00:40:18,883 --> 00:40:20,544
Two old married men.

419
00:40:20,651 --> 00:40:23,051
There was a fire in the hotel,
but no casualties.

420
00:40:23,154 --> 00:40:24,553
That's too bad.

421
00:40:24,655 --> 00:40:28,216
For casting this lucky fellow in the subway,
what's he look like?

422
00:40:28,325 --> 00:40:32,455
I don't know. A little excited.
A little shocked.

423
00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:36,329
- No, what's he look like?
- Handsome.

424
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:47,870
Your girl's gone.
I have Stolichnaya and Cuban cigars.

425
00:40:48,212 --> 00:40:51,909
I sent them from Greece.
I should've tried a pound of opium.

426
00:40:54,718 --> 00:40:59,314
Help yourself.
So, Cosgrove versus Campbell.

427
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:03,349
Is Cooper playing God or Darwin?

428
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:06,487
I know it sounds Japanese,
but it's not Cooper.

429
00:41:07,431 --> 00:41:09,922
Lane read about it
in some management book?

430
00:41:10,034 --> 00:41:12,594
I think it came from the home office.

431
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:16,832
When he told me about it,
I thought he was joking.

432
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:21,401
I told him it was a stupid idea,
but they don't always get our inflection.

433
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:26,882
- Can I speak with you for a moment?
- Come in.

434
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:34,949
What?

435
00:41:35,192 --> 00:41:36,159
I...

436
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:43,899
I just wanted to let you both know
how honored I am with this promotion.

437
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:49,500
Help yourself. Not the Stoli.

438
00:41:51,475 --> 00:41:56,344
Hello. Mr. Campbell, I was going to tell Don,

439
00:41:56,447 --> 00:41:58,779
but I can tell you myself.

440
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:06,585
I have an old pal at the mayor's office
that wants to do a small campaign for...

441
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:11,050
I don't know,
something about Penn Station.

442
00:42:12,563 --> 00:42:14,554
It'd be my pleasure. Bert?

443
00:42:16,233 --> 00:42:17,962
Is there any brandy?

444
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:21,231
Any glass will do.

445
00:42:23,841 --> 00:42:27,242
I told him that despite life
under British rule,

446
00:42:28,145 --> 00:42:30,841
we still had a real Yankee.

447
00:42:34,351 --> 00:42:40,153
I don't care what they say.
London Fog is a great name.

448
00:42:51,502 --> 00:42:55,768
I like the ants.
There's no shortage of distractions here.

449
00:42:56,607 --> 00:43:00,099
Now, if we can find a proper pub,
we'll have everything.

450
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:05,772
Why do you have this office?

451
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:10,286
I thought it was necessary that we have
a place for when superiors visit.

452
00:43:11,288 --> 00:43:15,054
Of course, it would make sense
for someone to occupy it in the meantime.

453
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:17,150
It's a harebrained idea.

454
00:43:18,662 --> 00:43:21,460
We just fired one third of their workforce.

455
00:43:21,565 --> 00:43:24,728
It's unseemly
to go through their pockets as well.

456
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:29,099
A visitor's office is good,
but you sit out front.

457
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,871
Of course. It was presumptuous.

458
00:43:38,048 --> 00:43:41,814
- This place is a gynocracy.
- Hadn't noticed.

459
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:49,218
My only point is,
if you decide to take the train tomorrow

460
00:43:49,326 --> 00:43:52,557
and you run into Carlton,
I told them we were busy.

461
00:43:53,731 --> 00:43:55,699
Our stories are straight.

462
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:59,228
Sally has something to tell you. Sally!

463
00:44:00,437 --> 00:44:03,338
I got it out of her. Out.

464
00:44:10,614 --> 00:44:11,842
Go ahead.

465
00:44:13,917 --> 00:44:16,215
I'm sorry I broke your suitcase.

466
00:44:17,521 --> 00:44:21,355
Find out how much it is to repair,
and it'll come out of your allowance.

467
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:24,791
- I don't have an allowance.
- Then don't break things.

468
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:30,057
I just thought... I just didn't want you to go.

469
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:34,968
Come here.

470
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:43,802
I will always come home,
and you'll always be my girl.

471
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:04,223
- Your eyes look tired.
- I don't sleep well when I'm not here.

472
00:45:05,969 --> 00:45:09,268
You squint too much.
You need reading glasses.

473
00:45:10,641 --> 00:45:14,372
Daddy, Daddy! Are these for me?

474
00:45:16,747 --> 00:45:19,978
- Yes.
- Give me that. It's a stickpin.

475
00:45:27,991 --> 00:45:29,424
There you go.

476
00:45:31,528 --> 00:45:34,088
- Was I really in there?
- Nine months.

477
00:45:36,033 --> 00:45:38,399
Tell me about the day I was born.

478
00:45:45,876 --> 00:45:50,836
Well, it was the middle of the night,

479
00:45:52,549 --> 00:45:55,882
and it was raining very hard.

480
00:45:58,956 --> 00:46:01,424
And I had just come home from work.

481
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:12,694
He did not feel like getting back in the car,
but he did.

482
00:46:13,804 --> 00:46:17,331
He took my suitcase
and my little stuffed Eeyore

483
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:19,932
that I knew I was going to give you.
