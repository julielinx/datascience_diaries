<i>Previously on</i> Mad Men.

2
00:00:07,252 --> 00:00:08,754
Your girl full of surprises.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,491
She really stood out,
brainstorming wise.

4
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:13,293
Here's your basket of kisses.

5
00:00:13,603 --> 00:00:15,611
What size Cadillac do you take?

6
00:00:17,482 --> 00:00:19,807
You know the rules.
I don't make plans.

7
00:00:20,067 --> 00:00:21,850
My neighbor posed for that.
Believe me,

8
00:00:22,591 --> 00:00:24,269
he always looks very relaxed.

9
00:00:24,763 --> 00:00:26,146
Don's in advertising.

10
00:00:26,406 --> 00:00:27,581
How do you sleep at night?

11
00:00:27,745 --> 00:00:29,316
You must think I'm a creep.

12
00:00:29,576 --> 00:00:30,651
Why are you here?

13
00:00:30,911 --> 00:00:32,182
I had to see you.

14
00:00:32,508 --> 00:00:35,132
I thought take you up on
your offer to look at my work,

Season 1 Episode 8
<i>The Hobo Code</i>

16
00:01:21,817 --> 00:01:23,349
Hold the doors, please!

17
00:01:25,067 --> 00:01:26,504
Thank you. Good morning.

18
00:01:27,008 --> 00:01:28,032
Good morning.

19
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:30,240
Draper has you in early, huh?

20
00:01:30,566 --> 00:01:31,566
What's he up to?

22
00:01:32,018 --> 00:01:34,507
I don't know. I kind of
came in for myself.

24
00:01:35,316 --> 00:01:36,316
Okay.

25
00:01:36,957 --> 00:01:39,261
Honestly, I couldn't sleep.
I'm just filled with nerves.

26
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,571
The service elevator is out.

27
00:01:41,816 --> 00:01:43,067
Do you mind?

28
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:52,357
I'm moving today.

29
00:01:52,692 --> 00:01:55,901
I'm supposed to go byat lunch
and supervise the movers.

30
00:01:56,754 --> 00:01:59,525
Probably lose the rest of the day
watching other people work.

31
00:01:59,878 --> 00:02:01,510
Well, that is a big day.

32
00:02:02,548 --> 00:02:04,077
What do you have
to be nervous about?

33
00:02:04,337 --> 00:02:05,138
Nothing.

34
00:02:05,324 --> 00:02:07,662
Just, I think, Mr. Rumsen
is presenting my copy today

35
00:02:07,863 --> 00:02:09,249
to the Belle Jolie people.

36
00:02:10,082 --> 00:02:11,503
A thing like that.

37
00:02:17,148 --> 00:02:20,238
We really took the local, didn't we?
It's 7 in the morning.

38
00:02:20,578 --> 00:02:22,064
I'm very sorry, sir.

39
00:02:23,206 --> 00:02:24,206
Here we are.

40
00:02:37,993 --> 00:02:40,295
I'm going to hop down for a coffee.
Would you like some?

41
00:02:40,516 --> 00:02:41,448
No.

42
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:42,777
Are you sure?

43
00:02:44,015 --> 00:02:45,443
Come in here, please.

44
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:55,879
Close the door.

45
00:02:56,957 --> 00:02:58,340
There's no one here.

46
00:02:59,017 --> 00:03:00,445
Close the door.

47
00:03:15,842 --> 00:03:17,509
Do you know how hard it is

48
00:03:17,814 --> 00:03:20,174
to see you walking
around here every day?

49
00:04:01,288 --> 00:04:03,655
- Your skirt. It's tight.
- Just pull it up.

50
00:04:10,381 --> 00:04:11,426
Be careful.

51
00:04:35,076 --> 00:04:36,255
Listen,

52
00:04:37,346 --> 00:04:39,441
maybe this isn't the right time
to mention this,

53
00:04:40,037 --> 00:04:41,610
but I want to clear the air.

54
00:04:42,289 --> 00:04:44,863
I know I told you I would read
the copy that you wrote, but...

55
00:04:46,974 --> 00:04:48,033
I haven't.

56
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:50,975
I'm glad.

57
00:04:51,915 --> 00:04:54,014
I thought you just didn't like it.

58
00:04:58,355 --> 00:04:59,689
That's too bad.

59
00:05:04,433 --> 00:05:06,218
I know what you're going to say.

60
00:05:06,482 --> 00:05:07,514
No.

61
00:05:08,665 --> 00:05:09,665
You don't.

62
00:05:10,228 --> 00:05:12,038
You haven't been right once.

63
00:05:21,276 --> 00:05:24,861
I have all these things going on
in my head, and I can't say them.

64
00:05:26,665 --> 00:05:28,175
Do you think about me?

65
00:05:31,727 --> 00:05:33,014
I'll be honest.

66
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,289
A few times.

67
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:39,367
You're only 20 yards away.

68
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:41,576
Not right now.

69
00:05:46,107 --> 00:05:49,830
I wake up in the morning, and
I look into Trudy's eyes, and I think,

70
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:53,211
"We're supposed to be one person. "

71
00:05:56,847 --> 00:05:58,824
But whatever I try...

72
00:05:59,698 --> 00:06:02,232
there are all these things
going on in my head.

73
00:06:04,725 --> 00:06:06,970
She's just another stranger.

74
00:06:16,534 --> 00:06:18,159
You're not alone in this.

75
00:06:32,288 --> 00:06:34,055
I'm sorry I ripped your blouse.

76
00:06:35,409 --> 00:06:36,543
It's okay.

77
00:06:49,957 --> 00:06:53,734
Look who's off the clock again.

78
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:03,942
He's speaking Italian to his mother.

79
00:07:13,164 --> 00:07:14,387
My stars.

80
00:07:14,647 --> 00:07:16,714
Two weeks in, and
she's already a goner.

81
00:07:17,442 --> 00:07:18,875
He talks to his mother a lot.

82
00:07:19,196 --> 00:07:20,825
Mr. Crane? I'll connect you.

83
00:07:20,993 --> 00:07:22,172
Because he's not married.

84
00:07:23,315 --> 00:07:25,682
Well, he's in the Art Department?
What does he look like?

85
00:07:25,911 --> 00:07:27,965
Did you see that movie
<i>Marty</i> with Ernest Borgnine?

86
00:07:28,339 --> 00:07:29,466
He lived with his mother.

87
00:07:29,714 --> 00:07:30,829
Stop teasing her.

88
00:07:31,064 --> 00:07:32,215
Yes, right away.

89
00:07:32,413 --> 00:07:34,251
My guess is tall, dark,
and handsome,

90
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:36,376
but I'm a glass-half-full
kind of gal.

91
00:07:38,098 --> 00:07:39,191
She is so thoughtful.

92
00:07:39,343 --> 00:07:40,789
- Let me get my purse.
- Forget it.

93
00:07:41,376 --> 00:07:43,595
Mrs. Sterling will be calling
before lunch time today.

94
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,332
Please put her through
directly to me.

95
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,406
- Done.
- Ask her. She'll know.

96
00:07:49,224 --> 00:07:51,648
Salvatore Romano
in the Art Department.

97
00:07:51,815 --> 00:07:52,778
Do you know him?

98
00:07:53,154 --> 00:07:55,204
Handsome. Very debonair.

99
00:07:56,286 --> 00:07:57,870
Cologne, but not the cheap stuff.

100
00:07:58,143 --> 00:07:59,635
Something European, maybe.

101
00:07:59,956 --> 00:08:01,306
You're so specific.

102
00:08:01,536 --> 00:08:03,551
You have voices.
I have other things.

103
00:08:05,436 --> 00:08:06,690
Thank you so much for holding.

104
00:08:09,237 --> 00:08:10,852
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

105
00:08:11,847 --> 00:08:14,008
Mr. Cooper wanted
to see you in his office.

106
00:08:14,246 --> 00:08:15,819
Tell Mr. Sterling
I'll be right there.

107
00:08:16,007 --> 00:08:17,357
No, it's just Mr. Cooper.

108
00:08:20,412 --> 00:08:21,675
Thank you, Peggy.

109
00:08:22,261 --> 00:08:23,290
What happened there?

110
00:08:23,553 --> 00:08:25,160
I caught it on something.

111
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:27,121
I might start keeping a spare.

112
00:08:41,161 --> 00:08:42,283
Come on in.

113
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:52,569
I'd prefer you didn't
smoke in here right now.

114
00:08:54,663 --> 00:08:56,948
Don, I am appreciative

115
00:08:57,208 --> 00:09:00,296
of your talents, and although
that cannot be measured,

116
00:09:00,715 --> 00:09:03,956
I have made an effort to quantify.

117
00:09:14,602 --> 00:09:15,865
$2,500.

118
00:09:17,649 --> 00:09:18,470
I...

119
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:19,737
Thank you.

120
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,444
That's what you say.

121
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:26,853
Have you read her?

122
00:09:27,912 --> 00:09:28,912
Rand.

123
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,746
<i>Atlas Shrugged</i>*.

124
00:09:32,668 --> 00:09:34,124
That's the one.

125
00:09:35,381 --> 00:09:36,873
Yes. Yes, it is.

126
00:09:37,183 --> 00:09:39,249
See, I know you haven't read it.

127
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:44,105
When you hit 40, you realize
you've met or seen

128
00:09:44,616 --> 00:09:47,258
every kind of person there is,

129
00:09:47,528 --> 00:09:50,001
and I know what kind you are.

130
00:09:51,321 --> 00:09:52,331
Because I believe

131
00:09:53,987 --> 00:09:55,372
we are alike.

132
00:09:56,977 --> 00:09:58,248
I assume that's flattering.

133
00:09:58,531 --> 00:09:59,719
By that I mean

134
00:09:59,979 --> 00:10:02,582
you are a productive and
reasonable man and in the end

135
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,719
completely self-interested.

136
00:10:06,486 --> 00:10:07,674
It's strength.

137
00:10:08,319 --> 00:10:09,704
We are different...

138
00:10:10,431 --> 00:10:12,463
unsentimental about all the people

139
00:10:12,706 --> 00:10:14,679
who depend on our hard work.

140
00:10:17,414 --> 00:10:21,007
Take $1.99 out of that $2,500

141
00:10:22,264 --> 00:10:24,154
and buy yourself a copy.

142
00:10:27,979 --> 00:10:28,979
I will.

143
00:10:40,812 --> 00:10:41,886
Hello, there.

144
00:10:42,354 --> 00:10:43,354
Hello.

145
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,433
Are you Traffic, or are you
here for casting?

146
00:10:46,693 --> 00:10:49,032
I'm... I'm not a model. I'm new.

147
00:10:49,246 --> 00:10:50,311
Excuse me, Marty,

148
00:10:50,571 --> 00:10:52,521
who's doing the Firestone comps,
you or Frank?

149
00:10:52,862 --> 00:10:55,095
Neither of us. Sal,
we were talking to Miss...

150
00:10:55,973 --> 00:10:57,605
Lois. Lois Sadler.

151
00:10:57,949 --> 00:10:59,593
I'm new here. Switchboard.

152
00:11:00,121 --> 00:11:01,322
Marty Faraday.

153
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:04,367
- Why would they hide you?
- Hi, Lois.

154
00:11:05,117 --> 00:11:06,397
Duane Davis.

155
00:11:06,729 --> 00:11:07,579
Salvatore Romano.

156
00:11:08,756 --> 00:11:09,867
Sorry about the mess.

157
00:11:10,466 --> 00:11:11,593
No, it's divine.

158
00:11:11,855 --> 00:11:13,898
I work in a closet all day,
so just to come out

159
00:11:14,145 --> 00:11:15,420
and walk around is wonderful.

160
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:17,797
Is there anything I can do for you?

161
00:11:18,104 --> 00:11:19,521
I'm such a featherhead.

162
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:22,594
I need to get my paperwork
in to Accounting, then

163
00:11:22,854 --> 00:11:24,636
find my way back
to the switchboard room.

164
00:11:24,788 --> 00:11:25,664
Am I close?

165
00:11:26,167 --> 00:11:29,044
No. You're not even
on the right floor.

166
00:11:29,618 --> 00:11:30,663
I'll walk you there.

167
00:11:30,841 --> 00:11:32,380
No. Just point me there. I'm fine.

168
00:11:32,544 --> 00:11:33,730
Go upstairs,

169
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:36,166
make a left outside of
the stairwell, follow the wall

170
00:11:36,331 --> 00:11:37,609
past the ladies' room.

171
00:11:39,392 --> 00:11:40,195
Nice to meet you.

172
00:11:51,019 --> 00:11:52,522
That ate up some time.

173
00:11:53,051 --> 00:11:54,501
I like when they flirt with me.

174
00:11:55,327 --> 00:11:56,715
She was flirting with him.

175
00:11:56,952 --> 00:11:58,409
You know, I had the salesman

176
00:11:58,609 --> 00:12:00,173
pushing this tie on me
for 20 minutes.

177
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,590
I'd have bought it right away
if I knew it worked.

178
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:04,953
It's not the ties.

179
00:12:05,094 --> 00:12:06,095
They always talk to you.

180
00:12:06,604 --> 00:12:07,978
They can tell you make money.

181
00:12:08,215 --> 00:12:09,015
I told you,

182
00:12:09,275 --> 00:12:12,545
you don't need money to dress better
than you do, Duane.

183
00:12:16,518 --> 00:12:18,045
Mr. Campbell, I have your wife.

184
00:12:22,132 --> 00:12:23,306
What line?

185
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:24,883
Light up a line, will you?

186
00:12:25,692 --> 00:12:28,240
<i>No, she's right here, in person.</i>

187
00:12:31,841 --> 00:12:32,945
Send her in.

188
00:12:35,778 --> 00:12:36,788
Hello, my love.

189
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,326
Hello, homeowner.

190
00:12:39,043 --> 00:12:40,034
What are you doing here, lovely?

191
00:12:40,187 --> 00:12:41,869
I thought I'd come get you
and we could go together.

192
00:12:42,025 --> 00:12:43,270
We could even walk.

193
00:12:43,649 --> 00:12:44,649
It's 30 blocks.

194
00:12:44,802 --> 00:12:46,352
It's beautiful outside.

195
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,349
I have a busier day

196
00:12:51,609 --> 00:12:52,737
than I thought.

197
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:57,173
Well, then let's do this here.

198
00:13:01,417 --> 00:13:04,195
I said I'd meet you there if
my schedule allowed,

199
00:13:04,462 --> 00:13:06,786
and now it doesn't look so good.

200
00:13:07,274 --> 00:13:09,445
No, you didn't, and I'm here now.

201
00:13:09,739 --> 00:13:10,549
What does it matter?

202
00:13:10,782 --> 00:13:12,203
This is my office.

203
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,207
How do you think it looks?

204
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:19,878
Like you are beloved by your wife.

205
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:26,146
You see what happens when
you just show up like this?

206
00:13:26,463 --> 00:13:27,515
We fight.

207
00:13:28,149 --> 00:13:30,179
I came to celebrate us
having our apartment,

208
00:13:30,586 --> 00:13:32,417
which I for one am happy about.

209
00:13:33,398 --> 00:13:34,683
And you have ruined it.

210
00:13:35,024 --> 00:13:36,024
I'm sorry.

211
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:39,510
I'm just busier than I thought.

212
00:13:41,461 --> 00:13:43,409
Let's have a glass of Champagne.

213
00:13:46,335 --> 00:13:47,493
I'm sorry.

214
00:13:49,024 --> 00:13:51,155
We're going to live
there a long time.

215
00:13:51,587 --> 00:13:53,858
There's no point in
being superstitious.

216
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:58,641
It's as simple as <i>E Pluribus Unum</i>*:

217
00:13:58,899 --> 00:14:00,150
from many, one.

218
00:14:00,651 --> 00:14:02,179
From many shades of lipstick,

219
00:14:02,427 --> 00:14:04,306
one that belongs to her.

220
00:14:05,961 --> 00:14:08,343
From a basket of kisses,
she picks one.

221
00:14:09,086 --> 00:14:10,845
It makes her unique.
It colors her kiss.

222
00:14:11,902 --> 00:14:14,896
And her kiss, well,
it colors her man.

223
00:14:16,149 --> 00:14:17,600
Belle Jolie lipstick.

224
00:14:18,087 --> 00:14:19,362
"Mark Your Man".

225
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:22,482
I only see one lipstick
in your drawing.

226
00:14:23,337 --> 00:14:24,859
Women want colors,

227
00:14:25,265 --> 00:14:27,132
lots and lots of colors.

228
00:14:27,716 --> 00:14:30,237
"Mark Your Man". It's pretty cute.

229
00:14:30,777 --> 00:14:32,075
You like this?

230
00:14:32,777 --> 00:14:36,162
Well, maybe we should cut down
to five shades, or one.

231
00:14:36,515 --> 00:14:38,247
I'm not telling you
to listen to anyone,

232
00:14:38,507 --> 00:14:39,962
but this is a very fresh approach.

233
00:14:40,148 --> 00:14:41,084
It's okay, Kenny.

234
00:14:41,344 --> 00:14:44,765
I don't think there's much else
to do here but call it a day.

235
00:14:45,441 --> 00:14:46,881
Gentlemen, thank you for your time.

236
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,008
Is that all?

237
00:14:50,148 --> 00:14:51,493
You're a nonbeliever.

238
00:14:52,521 --> 00:14:54,555
Why should we waste time on <i>Kabuki</i>*?

239
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:56,974
I don't know what that means.

240
00:14:57,401 --> 00:15:00,664
It means that you've already tried
your plan, and you're number 4.

241
00:15:01,657 --> 00:15:04,464
You've enlisted my expertise, and
you've rejected it to go on the way

242
00:15:04,652 --> 00:15:05,685
you've been going.

243
00:15:05,834 --> 00:15:07,061
I'm not interested in that.

244
00:15:07,275 --> 00:15:08,515
You can understand.

245
00:15:08,897 --> 00:15:10,141
I don't think your three months

246
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:12,116
or however many thousands of dollars

247
00:15:12,267 --> 00:15:14,962
entitles you to refocus
the core of our business.

248
00:15:15,185 --> 00:15:17,375
Listen, I'm not here
to tell you about Jesus.

249
00:15:17,961 --> 00:15:21,082
You already know about Jesus. Either
he lives in your heart, or He doesn't.

250
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:25,059
Every woman wants choices,

251
00:15:26,239 --> 00:15:29,322
but in the end, none wants to be
one of a hundred in a box.

252
00:15:30,522 --> 00:15:31,656
She's unique.

253
00:15:32,087 --> 00:15:34,883
She makes the choices,
and she's chosen him.

254
00:15:35,773 --> 00:15:37,951
She wants to tell
the world "He's mine".

255
00:15:38,838 --> 00:15:40,312
He belongs to me, not you.

256
00:15:40,805 --> 00:15:43,731
"She marks her man with her lips."

257
00:15:44,398 --> 00:15:45,673
He is her possession.

258
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,563
You've given every girl
that wears your lipstick

259
00:15:49,023 --> 00:15:51,174
the gift of total ownership.

260
00:15:58,024 --> 00:15:59,078
Sit down.

261
00:15:59,338 --> 00:16:00,338
No.

262
00:16:01,898 --> 00:16:04,203
Not until I know I'm not wasting
my time.

263
00:16:05,522 --> 00:16:06,522
Sit down.

264
00:16:08,848 --> 00:16:10,811
You know how to get back
to the Roosevelt?

265
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:15,183
We could have someone walk you over,
or just meet you, if you're interested.

266
00:16:15,636 --> 00:16:16,857
You're a troublemaker.

267
00:16:17,481 --> 00:16:19,359
Although it is a place
to get into trouble.

268
00:16:19,641 --> 00:16:21,355
They just did this incredible
renovation.

269
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,760
It reminds me a little
of a steamship.

270
00:16:24,322 --> 00:16:26,731
And the people...
I was in the lounge last night,

271
00:16:26,963 --> 00:16:29,317
and I end up having a drink
with Robert Mitchum.

272
00:16:30,734 --> 00:16:31,861
Actually, many drinks.

273
00:16:32,418 --> 00:16:34,325
Now you know we wouldn't
steer you wrong.

274
00:16:35,777 --> 00:16:38,159
Nice work. I think you may be
right about this.

275
00:16:38,862 --> 00:16:40,036
We'll never know, will we?

276
00:16:40,694 --> 00:16:41,496
What?

277
00:16:41,756 --> 00:16:44,332
It's not a science, Hugh.
We'll do our best.

278
00:16:48,909 --> 00:16:50,184
That Jesus thing.

279
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:52,063
I don't know what to say.

280
00:16:52,724 --> 00:16:55,299
Probably better than dangling him
out the window by his ankles.

281
00:16:55,635 --> 00:16:57,009
That's just a story.

282
00:16:57,346 --> 00:16:58,931
Don's never actually done that.

283
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,945
Ken, you will realize
in your private life

284
00:17:01,097 --> 00:17:02,782
that at a certain point
seduction is over

285
00:17:02,964 --> 00:17:04,807
and force is actually
being requested.

286
00:17:05,033 --> 00:17:07,413
He's a kid. He thinks
it's the other way around.

287
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,471
<i>Peggy, ice!</i>

288
00:17:20,757 --> 00:17:21,978
<i>We'll need some.</i>

289
00:17:26,863 --> 00:17:27,917
Should I just put it down?

290
00:17:34,033 --> 00:17:35,091
How much ice?

291
00:17:35,731 --> 00:17:36,759
How do you take it?

292
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,387
Home run, ballerina.

293
00:17:41,107 --> 00:17:43,432
Go ahead, before Joan Holloway sees.

294
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:49,105
You call that celebrating?

295
00:17:55,469 --> 00:17:57,306
The meeting was so long,
I was worried.

296
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,892
We barely finished the presentation,
and he bought it.

297
00:18:00,103 --> 00:18:01,480
No, he's bring modest.

298
00:18:01,969 --> 00:18:03,924
Donald walked around
the village three times

299
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:05,538
and then set it on fire.

300
00:18:06,537 --> 00:18:08,374
Oh, my God. Can I see it?

301
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:13,429
It's marvelous.

302
00:18:14,341 --> 00:18:15,515
I thought it was going to say

303
00:18:15,691 --> 00:18:17,216
"It's the mark you make
on your man".

304
00:18:18,134 --> 00:18:19,191
Was it, now?

305
00:18:19,596 --> 00:18:21,053
You may be a writer, honey.

306
00:18:21,438 --> 00:18:22,263
Really?

307
00:18:22,848 --> 00:18:24,098
You're arrogant.

308
00:18:25,901 --> 00:18:27,101
You want another drink?

309
00:18:27,361 --> 00:18:28,394
I don't know.

310
00:18:28,654 --> 00:18:29,673
Not a writer.

311
00:18:33,173 --> 00:18:34,400
Can I keep it?

312
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:35,693
No.

313
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:44,359
What are you doing?

314
00:18:44,526 --> 00:18:45,982
Don't ever put your name on a list.

315
00:18:46,211 --> 00:18:48,035
They keep track of everything
we do here.

316
00:18:48,297 --> 00:18:50,166
Have you never heard
of Joseph McCarthy?

317
00:18:50,483 --> 00:18:51,664
It's the bowling team.

318
00:18:52,136 --> 00:18:53,663
My God. It happened.

319
00:18:53,805 --> 00:18:55,354
- They loved it.
- What are you talking about?

320
00:18:55,507 --> 00:18:56,942
I'm heading out. Don't look for me.

321
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:58,316
I have errands to run.

322
00:18:58,482 --> 00:19:00,180
My Belle Jolie copy. They loved it.

323
00:19:00,853 --> 00:19:02,720
- Congratulations.
- That's so fascinating!

324
00:19:03,052 --> 00:19:05,181
I'm glad your other work
was suffering for a reason.

325
00:19:05,546 --> 00:19:06,593
They poured me a drink.

326
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:08,351
- Who?
- Mr. Draper,

327
00:19:08,921 --> 00:19:10,729
Mr. Rumsen, Mr. Romano, and...

328
00:19:10,923 --> 00:19:11,882
I'm so jealous.

329
00:19:12,046 --> 00:19:14,394
Don't be. I was just...
I shouldn't be bragging.

330
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:15,780
They sold Peggy's copy.

331
00:19:15,927 --> 00:19:16,937
My word.

332
00:19:17,107 --> 00:19:19,312
Actually, they changed it
a little bit, but it worked.

333
00:19:19,486 --> 00:19:20,987
- We're celebrating.
- How about it?

334
00:19:21,139 --> 00:19:23,450
Five minutes to 5,
we head to P.J. Clarke's.

335
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:24,742
Perfect!

336
00:19:34,596 --> 00:19:37,194
It's going to be a hell of
an afternoon traffic meeting.

337
00:19:37,372 --> 00:19:38,372
Champagne.

338
00:19:38,564 --> 00:19:39,573
When did that happen?

339
00:19:39,934 --> 00:19:41,407
Another grateful client stopped by.

340
00:19:41,624 --> 00:19:43,078
I thought you were moving today.

341
00:19:43,219 --> 00:19:45,227
I was looking forward
to seeing you in coveralls.

342
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:46,708
Yes, well, I managed to explain

343
00:19:46,908 --> 00:19:49,402
to the concerned party
that I already have a job.

344
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:51,894
Do they ever stop asking for things?

345
00:19:57,502 --> 00:19:58,502
Hello.

346
00:19:58,781 --> 00:19:59,786
Hello.

347
00:19:59,945 --> 00:20:02,200
Hildy, she must have gone to
lunch already.

348
00:20:02,831 --> 00:20:04,073
- Congratulations.
- Yes.

349
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:06,445
I hear you're quite
the little scribe.

350
00:20:06,842 --> 00:20:09,223
You can trust Ken's opinion here.
He's a published author.

351
00:20:09,421 --> 00:20:10,621
But he can't write copy.

352
00:20:11,385 --> 00:20:13,249
I don't like to limit
my words that much.

353
00:20:13,686 --> 00:20:15,042
I also hate puns.

354
00:20:15,302 --> 00:20:16,303
Come on.

355
00:20:16,432 --> 00:20:17,354
Admiral: the television

356
00:20:17,499 --> 00:20:19,547
that won't go down the tubes.

357
00:20:20,682 --> 00:20:21,757
Shut up.

358
00:20:23,212 --> 00:20:24,367
So you going to celebrate?

359
00:20:24,498 --> 00:20:25,538
Well, yes, actually.

360
00:20:25,749 --> 00:20:27,435
A bunch of us...
just the girls so far...

361
00:20:27,564 --> 00:20:28,973
are going to P.J. Clarke's tonight.

362
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:30,125
Forget tonight.

363
00:20:30,324 --> 00:20:32,414
I heard Cooper, Sterling,
and Draper already left.

364
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:33,623
Am I wrong?

365
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:35,023
What about Mr. Rumsen?

366
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:38,274
Freddie Rumsen's at P.J.'s right now,
and he doesn't know there's a party.

367
00:20:38,734 --> 00:20:40,801
3:00, after the traffic meeting.

368
00:20:41,134 --> 00:20:42,153
Joan's a tattletale.

369
00:20:44,081 --> 00:20:44,966
I don't know, Peggy.

370
00:20:45,142 --> 00:20:47,972
I'm kind of senior ranking when
those other men are gone.

371
00:20:48,962 --> 00:20:50,852
Speaker of the House.
He'll be there.

372
00:20:53,374 --> 00:20:56,024
I should probably go home, actually.

373
00:20:57,193 --> 00:20:59,048
If we're starting at 3,
you can go home at 5.

374
00:20:59,238 --> 00:21:00,369
It'll still be after work.

375
00:21:01,624 --> 00:21:03,799
We all work so hard,
I think we all need it.

376
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:09,580
Why not?

377
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:12,583
Toodle-oo.

378
00:21:26,874 --> 00:21:27,907
Mr. Romano,

379
00:21:28,167 --> 00:21:31,202
I was headed out to lunch,
but I have a phone call for you.

380
00:21:32,195 --> 00:21:33,496
I'm glad I stayed in.

381
00:21:37,426 --> 00:21:38,834
It's disconnected.

382
00:21:40,959 --> 00:21:43,047
<i>Everybody's talking
about the meeting.</i>

383
00:21:43,307 --> 00:21:46,384
Miss Olsen said your artwork
was spectacular.

384
00:21:46,644 --> 00:21:47,963
She did, did she?

385
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:51,653
<i>Anyway, a bunch of us are taking her
out to drinks. P.J. Clarke's?</i>

386
00:21:52,408 --> 00:21:53,536
<i>She deserves it.</i>

387
00:21:54,269 --> 00:21:55,708
You have to come.

388
00:21:56,519 --> 00:21:58,562
This is Lois Sadler, by the way.

389
00:21:59,269 --> 00:22:00,314
I know that.

390
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:02,208
<i>I'll be there.</i>

391
00:22:03,704 --> 00:22:04,768
Good.

392
00:22:18,908 --> 00:22:19,848
Can I help you?

393
00:22:22,129 --> 00:22:23,510
Can I help you, sir?

394
00:22:24,401 --> 00:22:25,223
It's Don.

395
00:22:26,467 --> 00:22:27,771
The ad man.

396
00:22:28,569 --> 00:22:29,802
He's okay.

397
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:32,103
Excuse me, fellas.

398
00:22:38,522 --> 00:22:41,798
Just because I can't call you
doesn't mean you can't call me.

399
00:22:49,543 --> 00:22:51,691
Pack a bag. We're going to Paris.

400
00:22:52,881 --> 00:22:54,195
- What?
- Paris.

401
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:56,072
Now?

402
00:22:58,317 --> 00:22:59,317
Yeesh.

403
00:22:59,817 --> 00:23:00,916
Where'd you get that?

404
00:23:01,258 --> 00:23:02,451
It's a bonus.

405
00:23:03,567 --> 00:23:04,638
I'm not sure what for.

406
00:23:04,819 --> 00:23:05,819
I bet.

407
00:23:07,307 --> 00:23:08,382
What do you say?

408
00:23:09,078 --> 00:23:10,376
I called Idyllwild.

409
00:23:11,243 --> 00:23:13,004
We can have breakfast at Versailles.

410
00:23:15,571 --> 00:23:16,658
I'm sorry.

411
00:23:17,448 --> 00:23:18,976
I have a special night planned.

412
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,899
I thought you didn't make plans.

413
00:23:25,159 --> 00:23:26,442
Is he joing us?

414
00:23:27,438 --> 00:23:28,444
Yes. He has to.

415
00:23:29,082 --> 00:23:30,762
He looks kind of square.

416
00:23:31,694 --> 00:23:34,192
Kibby just came four days
straight from Juarez.

417
00:23:34,516 --> 00:23:35,326
May I?

418
00:23:36,196 --> 00:23:38,537
I've been thinking about
this since Port Authority.

419
00:23:41,258 --> 00:23:42,944
Stay. You'll love it.

420
00:23:43,736 --> 00:23:45,815
We're going to get high
and listen to Miles.

421
00:23:47,947 --> 00:23:48,947
That's your plan?

422
00:23:49,468 --> 00:23:51,295
We can do this first and then do that.

423
00:23:52,992 --> 00:23:54,260
It'll be a lot more fun.

424
00:23:55,189 --> 00:23:57,008
Sit down. Relax.

425
00:23:59,806 --> 00:24:01,101
Next to me, Icky.

426
00:24:03,363 --> 00:24:04,691
Where did you find him?

427
00:24:05,792 --> 00:24:08,526
You know you need to leave the Village
for a decent screw.

428
00:24:11,443 --> 00:24:12,800
I'll take care of him.

429
00:24:24,069 --> 00:24:25,320
Do you like it?

430
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:35,530
I feel like Dorothy.

431
00:24:36,281 --> 00:24:37,783
Everything just turned to color.

432
00:24:39,069 --> 00:24:40,133
The words.

433
00:24:41,192 --> 00:24:43,359
You are good with the words, man.

434
00:24:45,382 --> 00:24:46,382
Well put.

435
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:50,681
Kibby, why don't you make
yourself useful

436
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:53,007
and get me a glass of water?

437
00:24:59,461 --> 00:25:01,863
My word, I need to get one of those.

438
00:25:08,005 --> 00:25:09,005
No, thanks.

439
00:25:14,033 --> 00:25:15,132
Maybe.

440
00:25:17,624 --> 00:25:20,278
We realize there's no music playing.

441
00:25:21,444 --> 00:25:22,498
Just the...

442
00:26:03,631 --> 00:26:04,864
Good afternoon, ma'am.

443
00:26:05,528 --> 00:26:07,548
I'm embarrassed to ask,
seeing as we all have it

444
00:26:07,701 --> 00:26:09,510
hard right now, but is there any way

445
00:26:09,696 --> 00:26:11,130
I can trouble you for a meal?

446
00:26:11,491 --> 00:26:12,623
I'm willing to work for it.

447
00:26:12,792 --> 00:26:14,109
Look around you.

448
00:26:14,369 --> 00:26:15,778
We're not Christians here no more.

449
00:26:17,132 --> 00:26:18,254
That is not true.

450
00:26:19,882 --> 00:26:20,993
Fine, fine.

451
00:26:21,884 --> 00:26:25,123
Work will feed your soul, but
there's no work left here today.

452
00:26:25,821 --> 00:26:27,166
Come back tomorrow?

453
00:26:32,198 --> 00:26:33,379
Nonsense.

454
00:26:33,639 --> 00:26:35,381
You'll stay with us and eat with us,

455
00:26:36,131 --> 00:26:37,476
and work tomorrow.

456
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,149
I will have to boil
those clothes, though,

457
00:26:40,337 --> 00:26:41,911
if you're going to sit at my table.

458
00:26:42,348 --> 00:26:43,358
I'm not offended.

459
00:26:43,634 --> 00:26:45,556
It would be a relief to me as well.

460
00:26:46,397 --> 00:26:47,418
Dick Whitman,

461
00:26:48,487 --> 00:26:50,213
stop digging holes.

462
00:26:51,382 --> 00:26:53,232
Build a fire under the cauldron.

463
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:54,608
Hiya, kid.

464
00:26:58,693 --> 00:27:00,196
What did I say to you?

465
00:27:01,538 --> 00:27:03,117
Reminds me of myself.

466
00:27:04,488 --> 00:27:06,226
That doesn't surprise me at all.

467
00:27:08,423 --> 00:27:09,932
So we thank you, Lord,

468
00:27:10,132 --> 00:27:11,904
for this bounty we are
about to receive

469
00:27:12,071 --> 00:27:13,990
that we may share it
with those in need.

470
00:27:14,884 --> 00:27:15,884
Amen.

471
00:27:16,197 --> 00:27:17,798
Amen. Amen.

472
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:20,914
Thank you again.

473
00:27:21,134 --> 00:27:23,137
Thank you so much.
This smells delicious.

474
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:25,347
Where are those manners from?

475
00:27:25,948 --> 00:27:27,791
Let him eat and be on with it.

476
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:29,704
I'm from just east.

477
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,451
About New York, originally,

478
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:32,811
some other places.

479
00:27:34,161 --> 00:27:35,218
New York.

480
00:27:36,244 --> 00:27:38,475
It's how you took to being
on the bum so easy.

481
00:27:38,954 --> 00:27:40,821
Archie, no one takes to charity easy.

482
00:27:42,321 --> 00:27:44,993
I'm just saying I bet he don't know
which end of a weed to pull.

483
00:27:45,633 --> 00:27:46,744
That's the truth, sir.

484
00:27:47,135 --> 00:27:50,878
I only know some farm work, but I've
seen mills and docks and factories.

485
00:27:51,093 --> 00:27:52,466
I've been a worker.

486
00:27:53,074 --> 00:27:54,443
Are you a communist?

487
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:55,820
No.

488
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:58,775
Yeah, I imagine they're
different, all right.

489
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:01,175
They take a club to the jaw
like anyone else.

490
00:28:02,073 --> 00:28:03,276
They are souls,

491
00:28:03,854 --> 00:28:05,304
but they can't be saved.

492
00:28:06,822 --> 00:28:07,822
That's true.

493
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:11,363
My mom always said that life
is like a horseshoe.

494
00:28:13,133 --> 00:28:14,146
It's fat in the middle,

495
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:18,264
open on both ends, and
hard all the way through.

496
00:28:34,281 --> 00:28:35,167
Tomorrow...

497
00:28:36,567 --> 00:28:38,317
when you've finished some work.

498
00:28:41,698 --> 00:28:42,698
Bless you.

499
00:29:02,624 --> 00:29:04,067
I had to see this place for myself.

500
00:29:04,244 --> 00:29:05,244
Good.

501
00:29:05,433 --> 00:29:06,919
It's something, huh?

502
00:29:07,183 --> 00:29:08,270
No Bob Mitchum?

503
00:29:09,436 --> 00:29:12,004
- What are you drinking?
- Campari with a twist.

504
00:29:13,256 --> 00:29:15,108
You know, when I mentioned
the renovation,

505
00:29:15,307 --> 00:29:16,625
I didn't know if you heard me.

506
00:29:17,131 --> 00:29:19,209
I've been curious about
seeing this place.

507
00:29:19,506 --> 00:29:22,270
I'm actually involved with architects
on this department store.

508
00:29:22,751 --> 00:29:24,174
Signage, mostly.

509
00:29:25,062 --> 00:29:26,964
I like this room, although I am

510
00:29:27,183 --> 00:29:29,526
its prime target: traveling salesman.

511
00:29:30,051 --> 00:29:31,061
In that suit?

512
00:29:31,244 --> 00:29:32,244
I should say not.

513
00:29:33,748 --> 00:29:36,862
No, I'm not one of those boys who
looks forward to a business trip

514
00:29:37,074 --> 00:29:38,647
to escape the wife and kids.

515
00:29:39,249 --> 00:29:40,583
I'm really a homebody.

516
00:29:40,999 --> 00:29:42,180
But New York?

517
00:29:42,684 --> 00:29:46,913
When you arrive, and that train starts
slowing down and it gets all dark,

518
00:29:47,865 --> 00:29:49,580
my heart pounds, and I think,

519
00:29:50,233 --> 00:29:52,695
"I'm going to climb that staircase
and be in New York."

520
00:29:54,309 --> 00:29:55,725
I take it for granted.

521
00:29:56,495 --> 00:29:58,525
It is a masterpiece of some kind.

522
00:29:59,016 --> 00:30:01,128
Wherever I'm staying,
I always demand a view.

523
00:30:02,282 --> 00:30:03,751
It's building after building.

524
00:30:04,078 --> 00:30:06,708
Little compartments filled
with possibilities.

525
00:30:07,624 --> 00:30:08,624
What's that from?

526
00:30:09,311 --> 00:30:10,262
42nd Street?

527
00:30:11,247 --> 00:30:12,247
What?

528
00:30:13,371 --> 00:30:16,964
No. I'm just saying it's...
it's like you can do anything.

529
00:30:20,553 --> 00:30:23,551
I'm two ahead of you. I have to eat
something, or I'm going to continue

530
00:30:23,728 --> 00:30:25,043
to rhapsodize.

531
00:30:26,935 --> 00:30:28,280
What time is it?

532
00:30:29,937 --> 00:30:32,361
I bet you don't have
an expense account.

533
00:31:00,057 --> 00:31:02,284
I'm not saying Peggy doesn't
have something upstairs.

534
00:31:02,472 --> 00:31:05,591
I'm just saying at <i>Sterling Cooper</i>
things are usually happening downstairs.

535
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:07,015
I didn't know that.

536
00:31:08,563 --> 00:31:10,453
God, the whole office is here.

537
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:12,908
I don't see the Art Department.

538
00:31:13,562 --> 00:31:14,872
What about those two?

539
00:31:21,098 --> 00:31:22,834
I think I had too much to drink.

540
00:31:23,455 --> 00:31:24,946
You are very <i>petite</i>.

541
00:31:59,489 --> 00:32:01,250
Going back to the well. Interested?

542
00:32:57,367 --> 00:32:58,729
Dance with me.

543
00:33:02,882 --> 00:33:04,490
I don't like you like this.

544
00:33:59,691 --> 00:34:00,691
Literally,

545
00:34:01,377 --> 00:34:02,702
"With flies."

546
00:34:03,597 --> 00:34:07,165
The espresso beans mean health,
wealth, and happiness.

547
00:34:08,424 --> 00:34:11,711
Seems redundant, I mean, if you
already have health and wealth.

548
00:34:11,971 --> 00:34:13,587
So, are you happy?

549
00:34:15,171 --> 00:34:17,578
I'm one of those people who thinks
the minute you ask that,

550
00:34:17,707 --> 00:34:18,916
you're not happy, so...

551
00:34:21,024 --> 00:34:22,024
no.

552
00:34:23,536 --> 00:34:25,499
You're loud, but you're shy.

553
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:28,598
I feel like I'm getting
my fortune told.

554
00:34:29,095 --> 00:34:30,095
I'm sorry.

555
00:34:30,534 --> 00:34:31,534
It's fine.

556
00:34:34,404 --> 00:34:36,153
So what do you want to do?

557
00:34:37,906 --> 00:34:38,906
I don't know.

558
00:34:39,595 --> 00:34:41,521
Let me break off with
one of the writers,

559
00:34:41,769 --> 00:34:45,167
have my own little shop
where copy follows art

560
00:34:45,543 --> 00:34:47,351
and not the other way around.

561
00:34:48,075 --> 00:34:49,508
No, I mean my view.

562
00:34:50,082 --> 00:34:51,185
You have to see it.

563
00:34:51,372 --> 00:34:52,993
It's all the way to the park.

564
00:34:53,532 --> 00:34:54,993
Of course it's dark now.

565
00:34:56,461 --> 00:34:57,595
I don't know.

566
00:35:02,593 --> 00:35:03,593
May I?

567
00:35:16,972 --> 00:35:17,972
I...

568
00:35:19,345 --> 00:35:20,947
don't know what to say.

569
00:35:22,033 --> 00:35:23,238
It's Elliot.

570
00:35:23,675 --> 00:35:25,827
And, Salvatore, you don't
have to say anything.

571
00:35:26,087 --> 00:35:27,346
No, I... I just...

572
00:35:29,907 --> 00:35:30,907
No.

573
00:35:32,256 --> 00:35:33,736
Have another drink.

574
00:35:34,046 --> 00:35:35,212
Think about it.

575
00:35:39,784 --> 00:35:41,534
Elliot, I have thought about it.

576
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:44,750
I know what I want.

577
00:35:47,283 --> 00:35:49,272
I know what I want to do.

578
00:35:51,728 --> 00:35:53,689
I know what you're thinking.

579
00:35:54,909 --> 00:35:56,466
I'll show you.

580
00:36:05,348 --> 00:36:06,993
What are you afraid of?

581
00:36:08,783 --> 00:36:10,128
Are you joking?

582
00:36:17,159 --> 00:36:18,159
This...

583
00:36:18,909 --> 00:36:20,372
has been a pleasure.

584
00:36:40,569 --> 00:36:42,028
Don, are you all right?

585
00:36:43,348 --> 00:36:44,506
I don't know.

586
00:36:53,182 --> 00:36:54,756
Probably the guy in 2F.

587
00:36:55,812 --> 00:36:57,919
He uses his wife like a speed bag.

588
00:36:58,203 --> 00:36:59,282
Man.

589
00:36:59,888 --> 00:37:02,257
I was going to truck down
for some carrot juice.

590
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:09,665
Wait, wait.

591
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,786
Thank you.

592
00:37:33,464 --> 00:37:34,829
- Smoke?
- No.

593
00:37:37,224 --> 00:37:38,264
He speaks.

594
00:37:39,223 --> 00:37:41,880
I'm supposed to tell you
to say your prayers.

595
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:44,696
Praying won't help you
from this place, kid.

596
00:37:45,282 --> 00:37:48,428
Best keep your mind on your mother.
She'll probably look after you.

597
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,529
She ain't my momma.

598
00:37:51,162 --> 00:37:52,954
We all wish we were from
someplace else,

599
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:54,187
believe me.

600
00:37:54,661 --> 00:37:55,901
Ain't you heard?

601
00:37:56,696 --> 00:37:58,228
I'm a whore child.

602
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:02,690
No. I hadn't heard
anything about that.

603
00:38:05,099 --> 00:38:07,697
- You don't talk like a bum.
- I'm not.

604
00:38:08,852 --> 00:38:12,268
I'm a gentleman of the rails.
For me, every day is brand-new.

605
00:38:13,038 --> 00:38:15,410
Every day's a brand-new place,

606
00:38:15,852 --> 00:38:17,472
people, what have you.

607
00:38:18,714 --> 00:38:21,097
So you got no home.

608
00:38:22,787 --> 00:38:23,787
That's sad.

609
00:38:24,161 --> 00:38:25,256
What's at home?

610
00:38:25,939 --> 00:38:27,888
I had a family once: a wife,

611
00:38:28,849 --> 00:38:30,312
a job, a mortgage.

612
00:38:30,661 --> 00:38:33,370
I couldn't sleep at night tied
to all those things.

613
00:38:34,164 --> 00:38:36,101
Then death came to find me.

614
00:38:37,246 --> 00:38:38,702
Did you see him?

615
00:38:39,309 --> 00:38:40,659
Only every night.

616
00:38:41,475 --> 00:38:44,622
So one morning, I freed myself
with the clothes on my back.

617
00:38:45,598 --> 00:38:46,598
Good-bye.

618
00:38:47,539 --> 00:38:51,781
Now I sleep like a stone: sometimes
under the stars, the rain.

619
00:38:52,286 --> 00:38:53,702
the roof of a barn.

620
00:38:54,082 --> 00:38:55,578
But I sleep like a stone.

621
00:38:56,397 --> 00:38:58,048
So where do you go?

622
00:38:58,675 --> 00:39:01,277
Tomorrow I'll be leaving
this place, that's for certain.

623
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,332
If death was coming
anyplace, it's here, kid,

624
00:39:04,586 --> 00:39:05,964
creeping around every corner.

625
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:10,150
Here.

626
00:39:12,398 --> 00:39:13,638
You're an honorary.

627
00:39:14,713 --> 00:39:16,577
This is how we talk to each other.

628
00:39:17,339 --> 00:39:19,040
On the front gate of every house,

629
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:20,349
there's a mark.

630
00:39:20,584 --> 00:39:23,472
It's a code, just like
you heard on the radio.

631
00:39:24,189 --> 00:39:25,234
See...

632
00:39:27,958 --> 00:39:28,987
That's a pie.

633
00:39:29,338 --> 00:39:30,845
It means the food here is good.

634
00:39:31,033 --> 00:39:31,865
This one...

635
00:39:33,526 --> 00:39:35,844
That means watch out
for the nasty dog.

636
00:39:36,696 --> 00:39:38,058
This one here...

637
00:39:39,889 --> 00:39:42,229
That means a dishonest
man lives here.

638
00:39:44,063 --> 00:39:45,150
And this one...

639
00:39:50,451 --> 00:39:52,389
That means tell a sad story.

640
00:39:53,648 --> 00:39:54,648
Here.

641
00:39:57,024 --> 00:39:58,428
Don't be scared, kid.

642
00:39:59,585 --> 00:40:01,107
You ain't a man yet.

643
00:40:31,774 --> 00:40:32,967
Of course.

644
00:40:34,086 --> 00:40:35,086
What?

645
00:40:36,399 --> 00:40:37,399
You two.

646
00:40:39,086 --> 00:40:40,058
You're in love.

647
00:40:41,303 --> 00:40:42,310
What?

648
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:45,085
That's ridiculous.

649
00:40:46,663 --> 00:40:49,833
Every day I make pictures where
people appear to be in love.

650
00:40:51,448 --> 00:40:52,779
I know what it looks like.

651
00:40:57,715 --> 00:40:58,952
Looks like a magazine.

652
00:40:59,399 --> 00:41:01,412
Love is <i>bourgeois</i>.

653
00:41:03,402 --> 00:41:04,958
You're breaking my heart.

654
00:41:05,218 --> 00:41:07,753
Dig. Ad man's got a heart.

655
00:41:09,214 --> 00:41:10,755
The grownups are talking.

656
00:41:11,026 --> 00:41:12,395
Don't defend him.

657
00:41:13,903 --> 00:41:15,802
Toothpaste doesn't solve anything.

658
00:41:16,651 --> 00:41:20,383
Dacron sure as hell won't bring back
those ten dead kids in Biloxi.

659
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:25,239
Neither will buying some Tokaj wine
and leaning up against a wall

660
00:41:25,498 --> 00:41:27,397
in Grand Central pretending
you're a vagrant.

661
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:31,300
You know what it's like to watch
all you ants go into your hive?

662
00:41:33,902 --> 00:41:35,780
I wipe my ass with
the Wall Street Journal.

663
00:41:37,082 --> 00:41:38,815
How come every time we have a party,

664
00:41:39,026 --> 00:41:41,360
the ladies have to sit and
listen to the men talk?

665
00:41:41,567 --> 00:41:42,495
Look at you...

666
00:41:43,215 --> 00:41:45,665
satisfied, dreaming up jingles

667
00:41:46,386 --> 00:41:48,993
for soap flakes and spot remover,

668
00:41:49,479 --> 00:41:50,837
telling yourself you're free.

669
00:41:51,411 --> 00:41:53,383
My God. Stop talking.

670
00:41:55,183 --> 00:41:56,426
Make something of yourself.

671
00:41:58,501 --> 00:41:59,512
Like you?

672
00:42:05,964 --> 00:42:07,579
You make the lie.

673
00:42:08,993 --> 00:42:11,283
You invent want.

674
00:42:13,589 --> 00:42:14,934
You're for them...

675
00:42:16,219 --> 00:42:17,236
not us.

676
00:42:18,666 --> 00:42:21,714
Well, I hate to break it to you,
but there is no big lie.

677
00:42:23,331 --> 00:42:24,822
There is no system.

678
00:42:26,207 --> 00:42:28,791
The universe is indifferent.

679
00:42:31,501 --> 00:42:32,378
Man,

680
00:42:33,168 --> 00:42:35,214
why'd you have to say that?

681
00:42:43,548 --> 00:42:44,557
Paris.

682
00:42:45,278 --> 00:42:46,494
Now. Let's go.

683
00:42:51,341 --> 00:42:52,639
No, I can't.

684
00:43:08,667 --> 00:43:10,006
Buy yourself a car.

685
00:43:16,002 --> 00:43:17,089
The cops.

686
00:43:18,342 --> 00:43:19,967
You can't go out there.

687
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:23,090
You can't.

688
00:43:34,599 --> 00:43:36,402
- Sir.
- Good evening.

689
00:44:09,951 --> 00:44:11,325
Wake up, Bobby.

690
00:44:14,842 --> 00:44:16,140
Come on, kiddo.

691
00:44:18,653 --> 00:44:19,655
Daddy.

692
00:44:21,475 --> 00:44:23,065
Your sister's sleeping.

693
00:44:26,593 --> 00:44:27,880
Ask me anything.

694
00:44:28,236 --> 00:44:29,405
What?

695
00:44:30,130 --> 00:44:30,997
Anything.

696
00:44:31,927 --> 00:44:33,418
I'm tired.

697
00:44:35,969 --> 00:44:36,974
Ask me.

698
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:41,856
Why do lightning bugs light up?

699
00:44:50,406 --> 00:44:51,540
I don't know.

700
00:44:55,388 --> 00:44:57,917
But I will never lie to you.

701
00:45:15,731 --> 00:45:17,210
Well, sir,

702
00:45:17,470 --> 00:45:20,282
I believe that does it.
I'll be on my way.

703
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:24,634
Thank you, again,
for sharing your home.

704
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:27,876
Good luck to you.

705
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:46,072
Be on your way already.

706
00:48:07,341 --> 00:48:10,135
- Good morning, Peggy.
- Good morning, Mr. Draper.
