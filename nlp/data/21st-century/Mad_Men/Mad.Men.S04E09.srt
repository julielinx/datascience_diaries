00:00:00,363 --> 00:00:02,839
Previously on AMC's Mad Men...

2
00:00:02,984 --> 00:00:04,407
Sally needs to see a psychiatrist.

3
00:00:04,584 --> 00:00:05,809
Why? Because she couldn't hear.

4
00:00:05,976 --> 00:00:08,513
She's out of control.
I thought you'd be concerned.

5
00:00:08,632 --> 00:00:11,344
You've crossed the border
from lubricated to morose.

6
00:00:12,552 --> 00:00:13,809
Ken has accounts.

7
00:00:13,961 --> 00:00:16,640
Fillmore Auto Parts because
entered the nation arena.

8
00:00:16,831 --> 00:00:18,632
Abe. Are you with Joyce?

9
00:00:18,778 --> 00:00:19,592
Are you?

10
00:00:19,817 --> 00:00:21,857
It's basic training. I'll be back.

11
00:00:21,992 --> 00:00:24,656
What am I gonna do?
Who I'm gonna talk to?

12
00:00:24,777 --> 00:00:26,119
I'm just gonna take you to your door.

13
00:00:26,233 --> 00:00:27,167
Why is that?

14
00:00:27,281 --> 00:00:29,744
Because that's as far as
I can go right now.

15

16
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:10,330
I'm interested in today.
That was Friday.

17
00:01:10,397 --> 00:01:14,200
Look, I'll clear lunch plus one hour

18
00:01:14,268 --> 00:01:16,503
and we'll grab a sandwich
and discuss this face to face.

19
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:18,872
I'm hanging up.

20
00:01:35,422 --> 00:01:37,524
Is it broken?

21
00:01:39,326 --> 00:01:41,060
The lamp?

22
00:01:44,398 --> 00:01:45,498
What are you doing all the way over there?

23
00:01:45,566 --> 00:01:47,033
It's too hot.

24
00:01:47,101 --> 00:01:49,569
Would you settle for a leg?

25
00:01:49,637 --> 00:01:51,171
I'd be grateful.

26
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,308
It's cold

27
00:01:55,376 --> 00:01:57,343
and soft.

28
00:01:57,411 --> 00:01:59,312
I'm the softest.

29
00:02:13,627 --> 00:02:15,695
So which one of us is gonna
look at the clock first?

30
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,601
I caught it when I was picking up the lamp.

31
00:02:21,669 --> 00:02:23,469
I'm already late.

32
00:02:23,537 --> 00:02:25,471
For what?

33
00:02:25,539 --> 00:02:27,440
Secor laxatives.

34
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:31,578
Did I spoil the mood?

35
00:02:31,645 --> 00:02:33,680
What do you have to do?

36
00:02:33,747 --> 00:02:37,283
I have a 4:00 at Erwin Wasey.

37
00:02:37,351 --> 00:02:39,385
Doing what?

38
00:02:39,453 --> 00:02:41,321
I can't tell you that, Mr. Bond.

39
00:02:41,388 --> 00:02:43,790
I told you.

40
00:02:43,857 --> 00:02:46,226
What are you working on over there?

41
00:02:46,293 --> 00:02:47,961
I don't tell 'em what I'm doing for you.

42
00:02:50,297 --> 00:02:52,165
You're not lying in bed
with them right now either.

43
00:02:54,101 --> 00:02:55,568
Do you know what a Chinese wall is?

44
00:02:59,707 --> 00:03:01,140
I really should go.

45
00:03:04,545 --> 00:03:06,079
Can I get in the bathroom first?

46
00:03:06,146 --> 00:03:08,214
Just take your time.

47
00:03:13,988 --> 00:03:16,055
Let yourself out.

48
00:03:16,123 --> 00:03:19,525
Lock the door behind you as a courtesy.

49
00:03:19,593 --> 00:03:21,761
You wanna leave me here?

50
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:23,997
You sure?

51
00:03:25,866 --> 00:03:28,101
I'm taking everything interesting with me.

52
00:03:36,777 --> 00:03:38,244
I don't understand. Do you honestly think

53
00:03:38,312 --> 00:03:39,512
my book isn't better than Ogilvy's?

54
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,180
Mine's got a story.

55
00:03:41,248 --> 00:03:44,117
It's got mystery, intrigue, romance.

56
00:03:44,184 --> 00:03:45,818
I tell you what else it's got:
It's got examples

57
00:03:45,886 --> 00:03:47,720
of how to sell things.

58
00:03:47,788 --> 00:03:49,589
Hold on.

59
00:03:51,191 --> 00:03:52,859
I'm on the phone.

60
00:03:52,926 --> 00:03:54,761
It's Mrs. sterling.

61
00:03:54,828 --> 00:03:56,663
She's leaving for the weekend.

62
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:00,300
It's only Wednesday.
They have phones in Southampton.

63
00:04:00,367 --> 00:04:03,069
Ira, I don't want to sound ungrateful.
I just think...

64
00:04:03,137 --> 00:04:05,605
Hello? Hello?

65
00:04:05,673 --> 00:04:07,674
Shit.

66
00:04:09,576 --> 00:04:11,411
Come in.

67
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,448
These need signatures, not initials.

68
00:04:15,516 --> 00:04:18,418
Caroline said you refused?

69
00:04:18,485 --> 00:04:19,952
It's just so much more work.

70
00:04:23,023 --> 00:04:24,857
I was just giving her a hard time.

71
00:04:24,925 --> 00:04:28,061
Can I interest you in the same?

72
00:04:28,128 --> 00:04:30,563
And I'm supposed to tell you in person

73
00:04:30,631 --> 00:04:31,931
that Mr. Pryce will be taking off

74
00:04:31,999 --> 00:04:33,933
the last two weeks
of August for his son's visit.

75
00:04:34,001 --> 00:04:36,002
You had to tell me that in person?

76
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:39,339
- So depressing.
- He doesn't want a memo circulating.

77
00:04:39,406 --> 00:04:41,240
He's afraid people will stop working.

78
00:04:41,308 --> 00:04:43,543
What are you doing in August?

79
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:45,478
I'm not sure.

80
00:04:45,546 --> 00:04:48,448
Well, what are you doing this afternoon?

81
00:04:48,515 --> 00:04:51,351
The same thing I do
every afternoon... Working...

82
00:04:51,418 --> 00:04:53,820
Which is what I'm trying to do right now.

83
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,388
It's not cute.

84
00:04:56,924 --> 00:04:58,591
Joanie.

85
00:04:58,659 --> 00:05:00,560
Jesus. I'm sorry.

86
00:05:00,627 --> 00:05:02,995
What did you say to her?

87
00:05:03,063 --> 00:05:04,397
What does that have to do with you?

88
00:05:06,066 --> 00:05:08,101
Her husband got called up.

89
00:05:08,168 --> 00:05:10,136
He's going to Vietnam right after basic.

90
00:05:10,204 --> 00:05:12,171
Vietnam.

91
00:05:12,239 --> 00:05:14,407
That's not good.

92
00:05:14,475 --> 00:05:17,110
It's okay. We've all been
walking on eggshells.

93
00:05:23,183 --> 00:05:24,784
Good afternoon, all.

94
00:05:24,852 --> 00:05:26,786
I know you don't like to be bombarded

95
00:05:26,854 --> 00:05:28,354
the moment you walk in,
but Fillmore and Secor

96
00:05:28,422 --> 00:05:29,822
are both coming in tomorrow.

97
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:31,290
I can't move forward
with either until you sign off

98
00:05:31,358 --> 00:05:32,992
on what I worked through lunch to finish.

99
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,795
I'm sorry. I had a long lunch,
went for a swim.

100
00:05:35,863 --> 00:05:37,630
Come back in an hour. I'm taking a nap.

101
00:05:42,069 --> 00:05:44,670
It's a business of sadists and masochists,

102
00:05:44,738 --> 00:05:46,472
and you know which one you are.

103
00:05:51,712 --> 00:05:54,414
- Oh hi.
- Peggy, your boyfriend's here.

104
00:05:54,481 --> 00:05:57,350
Satisfaction guaranteed.

105
00:05:57,418 --> 00:05:59,285
- Why are you here?
- Thought we could get a drink,

106
00:05:59,353 --> 00:06:00,787
- shoot the bull.
- Sure.

107
00:06:00,854 --> 00:06:02,822
- What time? Where?
- * When you're alone *

108
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:05,057
* and life is making you lonely *

109
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:08,428
- * you can always go... *
- 7:00, P.J. Clarke's.

110
00:06:08,495 --> 00:06:10,363
* midtown *

111
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:12,331
I'll meet you in the lobby.

112
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:14,667
Ooh, down below.

113
00:06:14,735 --> 00:06:16,369
Give it a break, jughead.

114
00:06:18,238 --> 00:06:20,840
Oh, I'm not shocked
by your lesbian hijinks.

115
00:06:20,908 --> 00:06:23,309
I just hope you know you can never do

116
00:06:23,377 --> 00:06:25,077
what a man can do.

117
00:06:25,145 --> 00:06:27,880
That's true.

118
00:06:34,922 --> 00:06:37,890
Bad news. Don showed up. We're on at 4:00.

119
00:06:42,863 --> 00:06:45,364
How was your siesta? Are you refreshed?

120
00:06:45,432 --> 00:06:48,534
- Yes.
- Dr. Miller returned your call.

121
00:06:48,602 --> 00:06:50,069
She said not to wake you

122
00:06:50,137 --> 00:06:51,904
and you needn't return.

123
00:06:51,972 --> 00:06:54,407
But she got the message
and you're gonna have to wait.

124
00:06:57,277 --> 00:06:59,679
- Thank you.
- Are you going to the toilet?

125
00:07:02,082 --> 00:07:03,716
I have to hire more copywriters,

126
00:07:03,784 --> 00:07:05,618
but these men come in and I know

127
00:07:05,686 --> 00:07:07,954
the better they are,
the more my job is in danger.

128
00:07:08,021 --> 00:07:10,756
Oh my.

129
00:07:12,426 --> 00:07:15,628
Look who's here... Abe.

130
00:07:15,696 --> 00:07:19,031
Peggy, I don't know if you remember
Abe Drexler from Kellogg's loft party.

131
00:07:19,099 --> 00:07:21,834
- Hi, I'm Peggy.
- I remember.

132
00:07:21,902 --> 00:07:24,403
Abe, you want to join us for a drink?

133
00:07:24,471 --> 00:07:26,639
Yes, please do.

134
00:07:26,707 --> 00:07:28,307
Oh, stay. I'll just stand here.

135
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:31,344
Can I get a Johnny Walker with ice?

136
00:07:31,411 --> 00:07:33,813
Ah, he didn't hear me.

137
00:07:36,049 --> 00:07:37,550
You know what? I'm gonna go play darts.

138
00:07:37,618 --> 00:07:39,452
- Take my seat.
- Are you sure?

139
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,088
Pay for that. See you kids later.

140
00:07:47,361 --> 00:07:49,529
I'm sorry. She's...

141
00:07:49,596 --> 00:07:51,564
Always so damn self-amused.

142
00:07:51,632 --> 00:07:53,933
What are you talking about?

143
00:07:54,001 --> 00:07:57,537
I was gonna stop by your office,
but I didn't want to get you in trouble.

144
00:07:57,604 --> 00:08:00,373
Then I thought about finding out
where you live, but that's weird.

145
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,875
So anyway,

146
00:08:02,943 --> 00:08:06,345
- it's nice running into you.
- I don't know what to say.

147
00:08:06,413 --> 00:08:09,282
That's very flattering.

148
00:08:09,349 --> 00:08:11,183
Well, that's how I meant it.

149
00:08:15,422 --> 00:08:17,456
Johnny Walker. Rocks.

150
00:08:17,524 --> 00:08:19,725
The bartender here listens to me.

151
00:08:33,073 --> 00:08:36,409
- May I help you?
- Are you Joan Harris?

152
00:08:36,476 --> 00:08:40,046
- I am.
- We're from madam Inga's.

153
00:08:40,113 --> 00:08:44,050
You are to receive massage,
manicure and pedicure.

154
00:08:44,117 --> 00:08:47,687
- Can we?
- I didn't order this.

155
00:08:47,754 --> 00:08:50,823
It's a gift from a friend, tip included.

156
00:08:50,891 --> 00:08:54,694
- What friend?
- I'm not allowed to say this.

157
00:09:03,537 --> 00:09:05,972
In Greece right now? Make no mistake,

158
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:08,608
that's a revolution.We are a hair away

159
00:09:08,675 --> 00:09:11,644
from everything falling apart
in every society. It's so tenuous.

160
00:09:11,712 --> 00:09:14,146
All these corporations just throw
their money at everyone

161
00:09:14,214 --> 00:09:16,549
to keep the status quo intact
'cause the people outnumber them.

162
00:09:16,617 --> 00:09:20,519
But in the blink of an eye,
they could overturn everything.

163
00:09:20,587 --> 00:09:23,122
It's an illusion that
America's so organized

164
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,624
that it could never happen over here.

165
00:09:28,962 --> 00:09:31,297
- Are you from Brooklyn?
- I am.

166
00:09:31,365 --> 00:09:33,199
- Me too.
- I don't hear it.

167
00:09:33,266 --> 00:09:35,201
One more drink and it'll come out.

168
00:09:36,436 --> 00:09:37,970
Okay.

169
00:09:39,973 --> 00:09:42,675
What am I talking to you
about corporations for?

170
00:09:42,743 --> 00:09:45,511
- You must deal with them all the time.
- I guess.

171
00:09:45,579 --> 00:09:47,847
Vick chemical, American tobacco,

172
00:09:47,914 --> 00:09:49,949
but most of them are family businesses...

173
00:09:50,017 --> 00:09:52,518
Samsonite, Fillmore Auto Parts,

174
00:09:52,586 --> 00:09:55,321
- sugarberry...
- Fillmore Auto Parts is worse than a corporation,

175
00:09:55,389 --> 00:09:57,356
- what with the boycott and all.
- What boycott?

176
00:09:57,424 --> 00:09:59,592
The southern stores won't hire negroes.

177
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,894
Says who?

178
00:10:01,962 --> 00:10:04,130
It was in "The voice."
It was in a couple of places.

179
00:10:04,197 --> 00:10:06,932
I don't think that's true.
I would've heard that.

180
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,701
It is true.

181
00:10:08,769 --> 00:10:11,404
That doesn't seem like them.

182
00:10:11,471 --> 00:10:14,707
I'm sure they're perfectly nice
for racists, you know,

183
00:10:14,775 --> 00:10:18,110
and obviously your company has
an investment in looking the other way.

184
00:10:20,047 --> 00:10:22,515
Well, it's a complicated idea,

185
00:10:22,582 --> 00:10:24,750
but in advertising,

186
00:10:24,818 --> 00:10:26,452
we don't really judge people.

187
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,387
We try and help them
out of these situations.

188
00:10:28,455 --> 00:10:30,856
Certainly we would try and stop this.

189
00:10:30,924 --> 00:10:32,925
If it's true, it's not good
for their business.

190
00:10:32,993 --> 00:10:35,795
Jesus, I don't even know where to start.

191
00:10:35,862 --> 00:10:37,830
You would've done a campaign for Goldwater?

192
00:10:37,898 --> 00:10:40,232
You kidding?
That would've been spectacular.

193
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:43,235
- Did you vote for him?
- Of course not.

194
00:10:43,303 --> 00:10:45,337
Wha... civil rights isn't a situation

195
00:10:45,405 --> 00:10:47,907
to be fixed with some P.R. campaign.

196
00:10:47,974 --> 00:10:50,576
It's an inequality that
the world has its eyes on.

197
00:10:50,644 --> 00:10:52,344
I know.

198
00:10:54,548 --> 00:10:56,582
But I have to say

199
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:58,651
most of the things negroes can't do

200
00:10:58,719 --> 00:11:00,486
I can't do either

201
00:11:00,554 --> 00:11:02,455
and nobody seems to care.

202
00:11:02,522 --> 00:11:04,390
What are you talking about?

203
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:06,692
Half of the meetings
take place over golf, tennis,

204
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,829
in a bunch of clubs where
I'm not allowed to be a member

205
00:11:09,896 --> 00:11:11,731
or even enter.

206
00:11:11,798 --> 00:11:14,667
The university club said the only way
I could eat dinner there

207
00:11:14,735 --> 00:11:15,835
was if I arrived in a cake.

208
00:11:15,902 --> 00:11:18,904
There's no negro copywriters, you know.

209
00:11:18,972 --> 00:11:21,440
I'm sure they could fight
their way in like I did.

210
00:11:21,508 --> 00:11:24,043
Believe me, nobody wanted me there.

211
00:11:25,178 --> 00:11:26,779
All right, Peggy.

212
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,314
We'll have a civil rights march for women.

213
00:11:34,321 --> 00:11:36,021
I have a really early day.

214
00:11:36,089 --> 00:11:37,389
It was nice to see you again.

215
00:11:37,457 --> 00:11:39,625
Wait. Hey hey hey. I'm just saying

216
00:11:39,693 --> 00:11:41,927
they're not shooting women
to keep 'em from voting. That's all.

217
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:45,664
Oh, Jesus. I'm really sorry.

218
00:11:45,732 --> 00:11:47,867
I'm much better on paper.

219
00:11:47,934 --> 00:11:51,470
You're opinionated
and you're criticizing me.

220
00:11:51,538 --> 00:11:53,305
That's not what I'm doing.
This is discourse.

221
00:11:53,373 --> 00:11:55,975
I knew I shouldn't have let Joyce leave.

222
00:11:56,042 --> 00:11:57,977
Have a good night.

223
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:09,375
A three-letter word for a flightless bird.

224
00:12:09,443 --> 00:12:11,010
Emu.

225
00:12:11,078 --> 00:12:12,778
Nope. It starts with an "l."

226
00:12:12,846 --> 00:12:14,547
The hell it does.

227
00:12:15,816 --> 00:12:17,917
Good morning, Mr. Draper.

228
00:12:17,985 --> 00:12:19,885
Could I get some coffee?
And let me know when Dr. Miller arrives.

229
00:12:19,953 --> 00:12:22,588
It's hard... The way she breezes past me.

230
00:12:28,395 --> 00:12:30,629
She's pushy, that one.

231
00:12:30,697 --> 00:12:32,698
I guess that's what it takes.

232
00:12:35,502 --> 00:12:37,403
- Morning.
- Good morning.

233
00:12:37,471 --> 00:12:39,839
- And thank you.
- For what?

234
00:12:39,906 --> 00:12:41,674
That was very thoughtful.

235
00:12:41,742 --> 00:12:44,844
I knew I was rubbing you the wrong way,

236
00:12:44,911 --> 00:12:48,214
so I thought, why not have
someone rub you the right way?

237
00:12:48,281 --> 00:12:51,283
- I brought you bear claws.
- Caroline won't let me have one

238
00:12:51,351 --> 00:12:53,252
unless it's on the end of a real bear.

239
00:12:54,821 --> 00:12:56,522
- Well, anyway.
- Joanie.

240
00:12:58,325 --> 00:13:01,193
- It'll be okay.
- People love to say that.

241
00:13:01,261 --> 00:13:03,996
Look, I know you're having a tough run.

242
00:13:05,365 --> 00:13:07,600
Let me get you a meal, hmm?

243
00:13:07,667 --> 00:13:09,201
Take your mind off things?

244
00:13:09,269 --> 00:13:11,404
Of course.

245
00:13:13,407 --> 00:13:15,941
I forgot for a second that you're
incapable of doing something nice

246
00:13:16,009 --> 00:13:17,877
without expecting something
nicer in return.

247
00:13:17,944 --> 00:13:19,712
I didn't mean anything by it.

248
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,414
Honest.

249
00:13:21,481 --> 00:13:23,115
Just thought you could use a night out.

250
00:13:23,183 --> 00:13:25,785
- Thank you. I'm fine.
- Good.

251
00:13:35,328 --> 00:13:37,329
- What are you doing here?
- I wrote something.

252
00:13:37,397 --> 00:13:39,231
I kind of wrote it for you.

253
00:13:40,834 --> 00:13:42,601
I would love it if you read it.

254
00:13:45,205 --> 00:13:46,906
"Nuremberg on Madison Avenue"?

255
00:13:49,176 --> 00:13:51,911
- What is this?
- It's what I was trying to say last night,

256
00:13:51,978 --> 00:13:54,380
but without, I don't know,
my abrasive tone.

257
00:13:54,448 --> 00:13:56,749
- Read it.
- Right now in front of you?

258
00:13:56,817 --> 00:13:59,118
Nah. Take your time.
I'll wait over here.

259
00:13:59,186 --> 00:14:01,620
I have a lot to do.

260
00:14:01,688 --> 00:14:03,989
I came all the way up here. I want
to know what you think, okay?

261
00:14:11,298 --> 00:14:13,365
These domesticated suburbanites

262
00:14:13,433 --> 00:14:15,868
still have a primitive desire
to get their hands dirty,

263
00:14:15,936 --> 00:14:19,405
but have they have become so
removed from nature that they can't.

264
00:14:19,473 --> 00:14:21,373
They don't know how to hunt
or swing a hammer

265
00:14:21,441 --> 00:14:23,709
- or fix their cars.
- You mean like these two.

266
00:14:25,312 --> 00:14:26,912
Actually, no. I'm from Vermont

267
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:29,982
and Don's a competitive fly fisherman.

268
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:33,185
What our findings show
is that this demographic

269
00:14:33,253 --> 00:14:35,321
will spend a good amount of money

270
00:14:35,388 --> 00:14:37,289
for the satisfaction of being useful
with their hands.

271
00:14:37,357 --> 00:14:40,659
Ladies love a man
who's good with his hands.

272
00:14:42,329 --> 00:14:44,096
You think a mechanic
comes in and sees these jokers

273
00:14:44,164 --> 00:14:45,798
looking at fan belts,
he's gonna stick around?

274
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,102
- No offense.
- What's the difference?

275
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:51,470
Our inventory's the same.

276
00:14:51,538 --> 00:14:53,772
I think if they see
a coat and tie on aisle 4,

277
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,342
they'll think our prices went up.
I know I would.

278
00:14:56,409 --> 00:14:59,745
Listen, salt of the earth, we need
more than mechanics to survive.

279
00:14:59,813 --> 00:15:01,747
You ever hear of Sears?
They'll kill us.

280
00:15:01,815 --> 00:15:03,582
We agreed we all had to agree.

281
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:05,618
Don't we have enough problems
with the boycott?

282
00:15:07,187 --> 00:15:08,854
Look, I don't want to get involved

283
00:15:08,922 --> 00:15:10,990
in a family squabble,
but I can't move forward

284
00:15:11,057 --> 00:15:12,491
until you agree on a strategy.

285
00:15:14,628 --> 00:15:16,395
What if there were a way
to market to both groups?

286
00:15:16,463 --> 00:15:18,464
"Fillmore Auto Parts.

287
00:15:18,532 --> 00:15:21,367
Where the pros go and everyone's welcome."

288
00:15:21,434 --> 00:15:24,670
- It's a little corny.
- It's great and you know it.

289
00:15:24,738 --> 00:15:27,206
That's not a strategy.
That's two strategies

290
00:15:27,274 --> 00:15:28,474
connected by the word "and."

291
00:15:28,542 --> 00:15:30,509
I can do "where the pros go"

292
00:15:30,577 --> 00:15:32,545
or I can do "everyone's welcome,"

293
00:15:32,612 --> 00:15:34,880
- but not both.
- Sure you can.

294
00:15:41,555 --> 00:15:43,422
Someone has to make a decision.
There are three of you.

295
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:45,858
Vote.

296
00:15:45,926 --> 00:15:47,159
Sean, what do you think?

297
00:15:47,227 --> 00:15:50,162
I d-d-d-d...

298
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:53,832
D-d-d-don't know.

299
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,367
What?

300
00:15:55,435 --> 00:15:57,336
You'll have to excuse me for a moment.

301
00:15:57,404 --> 00:15:59,238
Continue, please.

302
00:16:03,643 --> 00:16:06,345
Why d-d-do we

303
00:16:06,413 --> 00:16:08,080
have to c-c-convince him?

304
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:12,017
What are you doing here?

305
00:16:14,554 --> 00:16:16,722
I wanted to see you.

306
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:19,091
I am so sorry. Who are you?

307
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:21,660
My name is Vivian Winters

308
00:16:21,728 --> 00:16:23,696
and I'm going to assume you're her father

309
00:16:23,763 --> 00:16:25,264
since that's what she's led me to believe.

310
00:16:25,332 --> 00:16:27,266
Don. What exactly is going on?

311
00:16:27,334 --> 00:16:29,602
I found her on the train between carriages

312
00:16:29,669 --> 00:16:31,637
trying to avoid the conductor.

313
00:16:31,705 --> 00:16:33,772
I didn't have enough money.

314
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:37,109
Megan, could you take her to my office?

315
00:16:38,278 --> 00:16:39,411
Go.

316
00:16:44,217 --> 00:16:46,318
Thank you.

317
00:16:46,386 --> 00:16:48,087
Can I pay you for the ticket and your time?

318
00:16:48,154 --> 00:16:50,055
You're just very lucky I ran into her

319
00:16:50,123 --> 00:16:51,890
before someone else did.

320
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:54,827
The types on that train?
Someone should keep track of her.

321
00:16:54,894 --> 00:16:57,196
You're right. I didn't know.

322
00:16:57,264 --> 00:17:00,032
Men never know what's going on.

323
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:03,235
I offered you money and I said thank you.

324
00:17:10,377 --> 00:17:12,444
She looks so chubby in the pictures.

325
00:17:12,512 --> 00:17:14,113
Get her mother on the phone now.

326
00:17:20,086 --> 00:17:21,754
What do you think you're doing?

327
00:17:21,821 --> 00:17:25,090
I wanted to see you and I didn't
want to wait two weekends.

328
00:17:25,158 --> 00:17:29,161
Well, you can't do this.
This is very serious.

329
00:17:29,229 --> 00:17:31,230
Mrs. Francis on the line.

330
00:17:34,434 --> 00:17:37,636
- Guess who's sitting on my couch right now.
- What are you talking about?

331
00:17:37,704 --> 00:17:40,606
I'm talking about a stranger
bringing Sally to my office

332
00:17:40,674 --> 00:17:43,108
- because she got on the train with no money.
- You're kidding.

333
00:17:43,176 --> 00:17:45,210
Carla was supposed to pick her up
after the doctor.

334
00:17:45,278 --> 00:17:48,280
- How the hell did this happen?
- Dr. Keener thought it would be good for her

335
00:17:48,348 --> 00:17:50,316
to walk from camp to her
appointment by herself.

336
00:17:50,383 --> 00:17:52,851
Great idea. Thank you, psychiatry.

337
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:55,554
Don't yell at me.
She needs to learn responsibility.

338
00:17:55,622 --> 00:17:57,756
You need to learn responsibility.

339
00:17:57,824 --> 00:17:59,692
Now come get her.
I've got a business to run here.

340
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:02,695
Because it's so easy.
It's so much fun to take care of her.

341
00:18:02,762 --> 00:18:04,296
Enjoy.

342
00:18:04,364 --> 00:18:06,365
- What?
- Enjoy, Don.

343
00:18:06,433 --> 00:18:08,901
I'm meeting Henry in the city
tomorrow night. I'll get her then.

344
00:18:14,908 --> 00:18:17,009
Don't move and don't touch anything.

345
00:18:20,213 --> 00:18:22,247
I don't want to hear it. Just make sure
she doesn't leave that room.

346
00:18:34,811 --> 00:18:37,480
Hey.
Are you serious with this?

347
00:18:42,953 --> 00:18:45,288
Everyone knows who represents
Fillmore Auto Parts.

348
00:18:45,355 --> 00:18:47,924
- We're the agency of record.
- But I was defending you.

349
00:18:47,991 --> 00:18:49,992
We have a religion in this country

350
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,861
and it's business. You're not a priest.

351
00:18:51,929 --> 00:18:52,962
You're just another congregant.

352
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,830
So I'm not a war criminal.

353
00:18:54,898 --> 00:18:57,733
Look, why should someone nice
like you have to do this?

354
00:18:57,801 --> 00:18:59,468
Why should you be a part
of that corruption?

355
00:18:59,536 --> 00:19:02,038
It's a waste of your
and a million other artists' gifts.

356
00:19:02,105 --> 00:19:04,340
If you publish this, I'll lose my job.

357
00:19:04,408 --> 00:19:05,741
Maybe you're better than this.

358
00:19:07,778 --> 00:19:09,178
I'm not a political person.

359
00:19:09,246 --> 00:19:11,047
I don't have to defend myself.

360
00:19:12,849 --> 00:19:14,917
You're political whether you like it or not.

361
00:19:14,985 --> 00:19:17,787
And you're not supposed to be insulted.

362
00:19:17,854 --> 00:19:20,089
- You're supposed to be flattered.
- Are you crazy?

363
00:19:20,157 --> 00:19:23,626
You inspired me. I wrote this for you.

364
00:19:23,694 --> 00:19:25,761
I guess I read you wrong.

365
00:19:27,664 --> 00:19:30,066
You look so earnest.

366
00:19:30,133 --> 00:19:32,368
I need your word that you'll destroy that.

367
00:19:32,436 --> 00:19:34,604
Sure.

368
00:19:34,671 --> 00:19:36,772
I won't bother you again.

369
00:19:46,917 --> 00:19:48,251
Miss Blankenship.

370
00:19:53,657 --> 00:19:55,758
Miss Blankenship, are you all right?

371
00:19:58,862 --> 00:20:00,563
Miss Blankenship.

372
00:20:02,199 --> 00:20:03,699
Miss Blankenship.

373
00:20:06,303 --> 00:20:08,971
Caroline. Oh God. Caroline!

374
00:20:13,977 --> 00:20:16,379
- Oh. Do not come out of there.
- I know!

375
00:20:19,349 --> 00:20:23,152
- What now?
- Excuse me, Mr. Draper.

376
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,621
I'm really sorry to bother you again.

377
00:20:28,592 --> 00:20:30,493
Are you sure?

378
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,662
- I'm afraid so.
- What happened?

379
00:20:39,069 --> 00:20:40,436
Jesus.

380
00:20:41,972 --> 00:20:43,606
Poor thing.

381
00:20:43,674 --> 00:20:45,641
Should we call an ambulance?

382
00:20:47,577 --> 00:20:49,612
The coroner.

383
00:20:50,814 --> 00:20:52,081
What about them?

384
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:57,386
- I'll attend to this.
- Sally's in there.

385
00:20:57,454 --> 00:21:00,056
- Why?
- She's visiting.

386
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,001
Megan, get a man, and we'll need a blanket.

387
00:21:13,537 --> 00:21:15,137
There's an afghan on Mr. Crane's couch.

388
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,142
She seemed fine just a minute ago.

389
00:21:29,286 --> 00:21:33,022
So where are we?

390
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:36,659
- Have we agreed on a strategy?
- I'm not sure.

391
00:21:36,727 --> 00:21:39,095
This is where we are.

392
00:21:39,162 --> 00:21:41,731
Correct me if I'm wrong, gentlemen,

393
00:21:41,798 --> 00:21:44,967
but we believe by holding onto
Fillmore's reputation

394
00:21:45,035 --> 00:21:47,403
as a place for professional mechanics,

395
00:21:47,471 --> 00:21:50,272
we can actually attract men of all types.

396
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,608
So it's something like

397
00:21:52,676 --> 00:21:55,378
"Fillmore Auto Parts.

398
00:21:55,445 --> 00:21:57,446
For the mechanic in every man."

399
00:21:57,514 --> 00:22:00,082
And although it seems immaterial to you,

400
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:03,753
- the Fillmore brothers like it.
- Unanimously.

401
00:22:07,257 --> 00:22:08,524
What was that again?

402
00:22:09,826 --> 00:22:11,794
Fillmore Auto Parts.

403
00:22:11,862 --> 00:22:13,529
"For the mechanic in every man."

404
00:22:28,812 --> 00:22:30,413
My mother made that.

405
00:22:34,684 --> 00:22:36,886
Can we get your signature?

406
00:22:36,953 --> 00:22:38,687
I'm the president.

407
00:22:53,203 --> 00:22:55,237
I think this is a winner.

408
00:22:55,305 --> 00:22:58,140
Gentlemen, always a pleasure.

409
00:22:59,342 --> 00:23:00,976
Ken, can you show them out?

410
00:23:01,044 --> 00:23:02,244
Of course. This way.

411
00:23:11,988 --> 00:23:14,156
My goodness. I was just talking to her.

412
00:23:16,326 --> 00:23:19,495
Listen, my daughter
is sitting in my office.

413
00:23:19,563 --> 00:23:22,097
- What?
- She decided to run away today.

414
00:23:22,165 --> 00:23:24,166
- Sally?
- I'd really appreciate it

415
00:23:24,234 --> 00:23:26,669
if you could go in my bag,
get my keys, take her to my apartment

416
00:23:26,736 --> 00:23:28,404
and just... Sit with her.

417
00:23:28,472 --> 00:23:30,105
Are you sure?

418
00:23:30,173 --> 00:23:32,708
I would have my secretary do it,
but she's dead.

419
00:23:32,776 --> 00:23:34,710
No, of course.

420
00:23:34,778 --> 00:23:37,279
Okay, do you want to introduce me?

421
00:23:37,347 --> 00:23:39,281
I mean, what do I say to her?

422
00:23:39,349 --> 00:23:41,283
Do we really have to have
this discussion right now?

423
00:23:41,351 --> 00:23:42,485
You're Faye.

424
00:23:44,955 --> 00:23:47,423
Find Cooper and Roger at lunch

425
00:23:47,491 --> 00:23:49,425
and stop them from bringing
Secor back here.

426
00:23:52,496 --> 00:23:54,096
Sally, this is my friend Faye.

427
00:23:54,164 --> 00:23:55,931
She's going to take you to my apartment.

428
00:23:55,999 --> 00:23:58,501
- Why?
- You don't want this to get worse, believe me.

429
00:24:06,276 --> 00:24:09,211
Hello. My name is Faye.

430
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:12,314
I know. My dad just said that.

431
00:24:22,993 --> 00:24:24,593
Stop.

432
00:24:24,661 --> 00:24:27,363
- Where are they taking her?
- She's going to the morgue.

433
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:29,465
No, she's not.
She's going to Frank E. Campbell.

434
00:24:36,072 --> 00:24:38,641
Anyone track down her family?

435
00:24:38,708 --> 00:24:41,410
She has a niece. I'll call her.

436
00:24:41,478 --> 00:24:43,245
I'm sorry, Bert.

437
00:24:51,121 --> 00:24:52,788
Roger.

438
00:24:58,495 --> 00:25:00,262
You should go home.

439
00:25:04,234 --> 00:25:06,368
Yes. Take all my calls up here.

440
00:25:06,436 --> 00:25:07,670
Okay.

441
00:25:10,674 --> 00:25:13,208
So Fitzgerald says, "I promised to pour

442
00:25:13,276 --> 00:25:15,044
this whiskey over your grave
earlier, but do you mind

443
00:25:15,111 --> 00:25:17,846
if I pass it through me kidneys first?"

444
00:25:25,021 --> 00:25:27,122
- Are you all right?
- Oh, damn it,

445
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:28,657
I don't want to die in this office.

446
00:25:28,725 --> 00:25:30,893
I almost have twice.

447
00:25:30,961 --> 00:25:32,761
Stop it.

448
00:25:32,829 --> 00:25:34,597
If it looks like I'm going, open a window.

449
00:25:34,664 --> 00:25:36,332
I'd rather flatten the top of a cab.

450
00:25:38,635 --> 00:25:40,536
You are not going to die in this office.

451
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,641
Poor Ida.

452
00:25:45,709 --> 00:25:47,676
She died like she lived...

453
00:25:47,744 --> 00:25:50,212
Surrounded by the people
she answered phones for.

454
00:25:55,085 --> 00:25:57,386
I'm gonna go to my favorite restaurant

455
00:25:57,454 --> 00:25:58,921
and have a glass of cyanide.

456
00:26:01,157 --> 00:26:02,825
Or you could join me.

457
00:26:02,892 --> 00:26:05,494
I don't know.

458
00:26:05,562 --> 00:26:09,498
- I'm gonna kill myself, Joanie.
- No, you're not.

459
00:26:09,566 --> 00:26:12,034
Go get your things.
I'll meet you in the lobby.

460
00:26:15,972 --> 00:26:17,239
I got it.

461
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:26,115
- Hello, daddy.
- Don't "hello, daddy" me.

462
00:26:26,182 --> 00:26:27,516
Go sit down.

463
00:26:32,322 --> 00:26:34,623
- How was it?
- Great.

464
00:26:34,691 --> 00:26:37,993
We watched a little TV,
one of us took a nap.

465
00:26:38,061 --> 00:26:41,130
You want to stay? You're gonna need to eat.

466
00:26:41,197 --> 00:26:43,666
I know, but I have dinner plans.

467
00:26:50,607 --> 00:26:52,374
Thank you.

468
00:26:52,442 --> 00:26:54,777
Glad I could help.

469
00:26:54,844 --> 00:26:57,513
- Good night, Sally.
- Good night.

470
00:27:07,257 --> 00:27:09,158
Can we order a pizza?

471
00:27:11,628 --> 00:27:15,064
I want you to promise me
you're never going to do this again.

472
00:27:16,299 --> 00:27:17,833
I promise.

473
00:27:29,011 --> 00:27:30,345
Why did you always pick this place?

474
00:27:30,412 --> 00:27:32,647
No chance of running into anyone

475
00:27:32,715 --> 00:27:35,383
and, of course, cherry cheesecake.

476
00:27:35,451 --> 00:27:38,419
Well, the clientele
is older than I remember.

477
00:27:38,487 --> 00:27:40,288
But not us.

478
00:27:45,361 --> 00:27:47,195
I wish you would talk to me about things.

479
00:27:48,497 --> 00:27:50,531
My husband doesn't like it.

480
00:27:50,599 --> 00:27:52,567
I know it's tough,

481
00:27:52,635 --> 00:27:55,803
but he must've known about
the possibilities when he signed up.

482
00:27:56,972 --> 00:27:58,406
I wasn't consulted.

483
00:27:58,474 --> 00:27:59,874
You're kidding.

484
00:28:01,777 --> 00:28:04,612
Because you always tell Jane
about all of your decisions?

485
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,848
She's the woman behind the man, isn't she?

486
00:28:09,585 --> 00:28:11,519
Did you listen to my memoirs?

487
00:28:11,587 --> 00:28:13,821
I just have them transcribed

488
00:28:13,889 --> 00:28:16,057
and recycle the tapes.

489
00:28:16,125 --> 00:28:18,459
And you're not a little curious
if there's a chapter called "Joan"?

490
00:28:18,527 --> 00:28:20,662
There'd better not be.

491
00:28:22,231 --> 00:28:25,466
I know. That's the problem.

492
00:28:25,534 --> 00:28:27,201
And every time I think back,

493
00:28:27,269 --> 00:28:28,503
all the good stuff was with you.

494
00:28:30,706 --> 00:28:34,409
And I'm sorry I keep pestering you.

495
00:28:34,476 --> 00:28:36,711
I just can't help myself.

496
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,480
I don't expect anything to happen.

497
00:28:39,548 --> 00:28:41,783
I appreciate that.

498
00:28:51,794 --> 00:28:53,795
Can I ask you something?

499
00:28:53,862 --> 00:28:56,331
Yes, I'm still mad at you.

500
00:28:56,398 --> 00:28:58,299
Are you going to marry Faye?

501
00:28:59,601 --> 00:29:01,803
What? No.

502
00:29:03,005 --> 00:29:04,639
Is she your girlfriend?

503
00:29:04,707 --> 00:29:08,042
- No.
- She had your keys.

504
00:29:09,545 --> 00:29:11,312
I gave her my keys.

505
00:29:13,582 --> 00:29:15,550
She knew you had peanut butter.

506
00:29:18,087 --> 00:29:19,721
Everyone has peanut butter.

507
00:29:21,156 --> 00:29:23,291
Well, she said she wanted to meet me.

508
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:25,059
Why would she want to meet me?

509
00:29:30,432 --> 00:29:32,800
Look, I do like her,

510
00:29:32,868 --> 00:29:35,336
but we just work together
and I talk about you a lot.

511
00:29:36,739 --> 00:29:38,539
Do you like her?

512
00:29:38,607 --> 00:29:41,275
- She seems nice.
- Well, good.

513
00:29:41,343 --> 00:29:43,478
Maybe you'll get to see her again sometime.

514
00:29:43,545 --> 00:29:45,813
Oh.

515
00:29:56,392 --> 00:29:58,793
Get out some plates.

516
00:29:58,861 --> 00:30:02,130
'Cause I didn't want to take a cab
on Broadway. It's a beautiful night.

517
00:30:02,197 --> 00:30:04,399
I don't like this neighborhood anymore.

518
00:30:04,466 --> 00:30:05,967
What happened to it?

519
00:30:06,034 --> 00:30:08,002
Miss Blankenship,
you're not missing anything.

520
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:10,538
- Do you know what time it is?
- I do.

521
00:30:10,606 --> 00:30:11,873
Oh God.

522
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,508
You know what to do.

523
00:30:13,575 --> 00:30:16,778
- Rog...
- Yes. Yes, we do.

524
00:30:16,845 --> 00:30:19,514
Look down. Everything's going to be fine.

525
00:30:30,426 --> 00:30:32,160
- There you go.
- What about her?

526
00:30:33,362 --> 00:30:34,862
Give me your bag.

527
00:30:36,665 --> 00:30:37,999
Rings.

528
00:30:43,672 --> 00:30:46,174
That's everything.
We haven't seen anything.

529
00:30:51,313 --> 00:30:53,581
I can't breathe.

530
00:30:53,649 --> 00:30:56,818
- I want to scream.
- Don't. Come over here.

531
00:30:58,754 --> 00:31:01,756
- You have to calm down.
- My ring. My ring.

532
00:31:01,824 --> 00:31:03,624
Stop it. Everything can be replaced.

533
00:31:03,692 --> 00:31:05,393
You're fine.

534
00:31:26,014 --> 00:31:27,849
Don't stop.

535
00:31:37,626 --> 00:31:40,228
Are you sure you don't want
to call your mother or your brothers?

536
00:31:41,663 --> 00:31:44,465
It's 9:30. They're asleep.

537
00:31:51,306 --> 00:31:54,275
Daddy, I love you so much.

538
00:31:54,343 --> 00:31:56,344
I love you too.

539
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:00,114
Did you brush your hair?

540
00:32:00,182 --> 00:32:01,916
I want to live with you all the time.

541
00:32:04,786 --> 00:32:06,754
You can't do that, honey.

542
00:32:06,822 --> 00:32:09,357
Why not? I'll be good.

543
00:32:11,026 --> 00:32:13,361
Where are you gonna go to school down here?

544
00:32:13,428 --> 00:32:15,496
What about your friends?
What about your brothers?

545
00:32:17,866 --> 00:32:21,068
They could live here too. I'll watch them.

546
00:32:21,136 --> 00:32:22,503
Sally.

547
00:32:23,805 --> 00:32:25,406
Go to sleep.

548
00:33:31,473 --> 00:33:34,342
- Sally?
- I made French toast.

549
00:33:36,311 --> 00:33:38,212
You know I don't like you using the stove.

550
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,481
Oh, daddy, I do it all the time.

551
00:33:40,549 --> 00:33:42,149
And there's no shells in it.

552
00:33:44,086 --> 00:33:45,753
Do you want me to turn on the TV?

553
00:33:45,821 --> 00:33:47,288
We can watch "The today show."

554
00:33:47,356 --> 00:33:49,056
No.

555
00:33:49,124 --> 00:33:50,725
Where'd you learn how to do this?

556
00:33:50,792 --> 00:33:52,293
Carla taught me.

557
00:33:54,096 --> 00:33:55,796
What's on this?

558
00:33:55,864 --> 00:33:57,798
Mrs. Butterworth's.

559
00:33:57,866 --> 00:33:59,166
Go get it.

560
00:34:06,041 --> 00:34:09,443
That's rum. Read labels.

561
00:34:09,511 --> 00:34:11,445
Is it bad?

562
00:34:12,781 --> 00:34:14,115
Not really.

563
00:34:16,652 --> 00:34:18,619
Get dressed and I'll get you
a bun at the office.

564
00:34:18,687 --> 00:34:20,287
Can't we do something?

565
00:34:26,461 --> 00:34:29,063
All right, here's the deal. No negotiating.

566
00:34:29,131 --> 00:34:31,399
I'm gonna call in, move everything to noon,

567
00:34:31,466 --> 00:34:33,067
and we're gonna go
to the Central Park Zoo.

568
00:34:33,135 --> 00:34:36,570
- And the dinosaur museum?
- One or the other.

569
00:34:36,638 --> 00:34:38,706
We only have till noon.

570
00:34:38,774 --> 00:34:40,408
You finish your breakfast.

571
00:34:40,475 --> 00:34:41,876
I'm going to get ready.

572
00:34:47,516 --> 00:34:49,984
You want me to get Don to do it?

573
00:34:50,052 --> 00:34:52,319
Of course, he didn't really know her.

574
00:34:53,722 --> 00:34:55,189
No, he didn't.

575
00:34:58,627 --> 00:35:00,227
Caroline, get Mrs. Harris.

576
00:35:00,295 --> 00:35:02,997
It's regarding Ida Blankenship's obit.

577
00:35:03,065 --> 00:35:05,366
That ought to get her in here.

578
00:35:05,434 --> 00:35:07,668
This is an insult to her.

579
00:35:07,736 --> 00:35:09,770
I can't think of anything.

580
00:35:09,838 --> 00:35:13,240
And I have no office in which to ruminate.

581
00:35:16,745 --> 00:35:18,913
Cooper's trying to write an obit...

582
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:21,482
Something sharp and sweet.

583
00:35:23,585 --> 00:35:25,886
Well, Mr. Cooper,

584
00:35:25,954 --> 00:35:27,788
shall we say,

585
00:35:27,856 --> 00:35:30,191
- "beloved friend..."
- Mmm.

586
00:35:30,258 --> 00:35:32,593
"...devoted caretaker..."

587
00:35:32,661 --> 00:35:35,096
Put "quietly in her sleep," of course.

588
00:35:35,163 --> 00:35:36,363
What's her profession... secretary?

589
00:35:36,431 --> 00:35:38,365
Executive secretary.

590
00:35:40,035 --> 00:35:42,636
She was born in 1898 in a barn.

591
00:35:42,704 --> 00:35:46,807
She died on the 37th floor of a skyscraper.

592
00:35:46,875 --> 00:35:49,410
She's an astronaut.

593
00:35:52,848 --> 00:35:54,415
Hey.

594
00:35:57,753 --> 00:35:59,820
Is this what it took to get you in here?

595
00:36:02,824 --> 00:36:04,258
Look, I'm sorry.

596
00:36:05,761 --> 00:36:07,661
It was in the heat of the moment.

597
00:36:09,231 --> 00:36:11,532
And there was a moment. You know that.

598
00:36:13,235 --> 00:36:15,069
I'm not sorry,

599
00:36:15,137 --> 00:36:16,971
but I'm married.

600
00:36:18,373 --> 00:36:19,740
And so are you.

601
00:36:19,808 --> 00:36:21,675
I feel something

602
00:36:22,844 --> 00:36:24,178
and I know you do.

603
00:36:36,146 --> 00:36:37,880
Good afternoon.

604
00:36:39,548 --> 00:36:42,483
- Hello.
- Sally, this is Megan.

605
00:36:42,551 --> 00:36:46,287
- Where's Miss Blankenship?
- She went away.

606
00:36:46,355 --> 00:36:47,689
I'm helping out for a little bit.

607
00:36:50,025 --> 00:36:52,427
Her mother should be by at 5:00.
Can you handle five minutes?

608
00:36:52,494 --> 00:36:54,362
Are you hungry?

609
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:56,497
She ate plenty.

610
00:36:56,565 --> 00:36:58,132
I'm gonna get coffee and check in.

611
00:37:05,174 --> 00:37:07,709
Shit. Now we can't leave.

612
00:37:07,776 --> 00:37:10,778
Huh. Harry said on the form
where it says "cause of death,"

613
00:37:10,846 --> 00:37:13,915
they wrote "Don Draper."

614
00:37:13,983 --> 00:37:16,251
How long do you think Yvette Mimieux's
gonna last on his desk?

615
00:37:16,318 --> 00:37:18,386
I say we start a pool

616
00:37:18,454 --> 00:37:20,922
on whether she's fired, quits or dies.

617
00:37:24,793 --> 00:37:27,629
Where's Dr. Miller?

618
00:37:27,696 --> 00:37:29,964
- I don't know if she's coming in.
- She is.

619
00:37:30,032 --> 00:37:32,734
Well, the Fillmores want a jingle,

620
00:37:32,801 --> 00:37:35,003
a c-c-c-catchy tune.

621
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:36,638
Don't do that.

622
00:37:38,807 --> 00:37:42,143
Harry says no rock 'n' roll
if we want middle-class men.

623
00:37:42,211 --> 00:37:44,879
He was pushing Perry Como.

624
00:37:44,947 --> 00:37:47,081
And we had Pat Boone, Roger Miller,

625
00:37:47,149 --> 00:37:49,284
Frankie Laine, Duane Eddy.

626
00:37:49,351 --> 00:37:50,852
I'm glad I came in for this.

627
00:37:52,554 --> 00:37:54,355
How about Harry Belafonte?

628
00:37:54,423 --> 00:37:56,090
Everyone likes him.

629
00:37:56,158 --> 00:37:59,427
I'll get you tickets to Harry Belafonte.

630
00:37:59,495 --> 00:38:02,330
Believe me, he ain't selling
auto parts for these guys.

631
00:38:02,398 --> 00:38:06,267
Well, maybe it'll help them
with their image in the South.

632
00:38:06,335 --> 00:38:09,237
They don't want help.
Have you ever been to the South?

633
00:38:09,305 --> 00:38:10,471
'Cause they have a way of doing things

634
00:38:10,539 --> 00:38:12,607
and it doesn't include Harry Belafonte.

635
00:38:12,675 --> 00:38:14,575
The Fillmore brothers are from Boston.

636
00:38:14,643 --> 00:38:16,311
Same thing.

637
00:38:16,378 --> 00:38:18,146
Well, why are we doing business

638
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:19,781
with someone that doesn't hire negroes?

639
00:38:24,553 --> 00:38:28,022
Our job is to make men like Fillmore Auto,

640
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:30,391
not make Fillmore Auto like negroes.

641
00:38:36,765 --> 00:38:39,267
Pick one, get it written and recorded

642
00:38:39,335 --> 00:38:41,602
and if they want to change it,
we will charge them to change it.

643
00:38:43,272 --> 00:38:45,039
How about dean Martin?

644
00:38:45,107 --> 00:38:47,241
He's friends with Sammy Davis Jr.

645
00:38:47,309 --> 00:38:49,277
Does that work for you, Peggy?

646
00:38:53,982 --> 00:38:56,784
Mrs. Francis is going to be
in the lobby any minute.

647
00:38:56,852 --> 00:38:58,786
I have to cover reception,
per Joan's orders.

648
00:38:58,854 --> 00:39:00,288
Go ahead.

649
00:39:04,226 --> 00:39:05,993
Your mother's going to be
downstairs in a minute.

650
00:39:06,061 --> 00:39:07,595
Get your things.

651
00:39:07,663 --> 00:39:09,230
I wanna stay.

652
00:39:09,298 --> 00:39:10,832
Well, you can't.

653
00:39:10,899 --> 00:39:13,234
I want to stay and
I don't know why I can't.

654
00:39:13,302 --> 00:39:15,303
Because you have to go home.

655
00:39:15,371 --> 00:39:17,972
I'll be good. I promise.

656
00:39:19,408 --> 00:39:21,175
- Come on.
- No.

657
00:39:21,243 --> 00:39:22,944
- Let's go.
- No! No!

658
00:39:23,011 --> 00:39:25,980
No no! I'm not going anywhere! Stop it!

659
00:39:26,048 --> 00:39:28,483
- Do you want me to carry you out of here?
- I'm not going.

660
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:30,518
I'm not leaving. I hate it there!

661
00:39:31,954 --> 00:39:33,721
Is everything okay?

662
00:39:37,092 --> 00:39:39,327
- Can you talk to her?
- What?

663
00:39:39,395 --> 00:39:40,728
Please. I can't bring her back

664
00:39:40,796 --> 00:39:42,497
kicking and screaming to her mother.

665
00:39:42,564 --> 00:39:44,265
I don't have much child psychology.

666
00:39:44,333 --> 00:39:46,267
Just talk to her.

667
00:39:50,706 --> 00:39:52,874
Dr. Faye wants to talk to you.

668
00:39:54,943 --> 00:39:56,944
Hi, Sally.

669
00:39:57,012 --> 00:39:58,713
Remember me from yesterday?

670
00:40:03,452 --> 00:40:06,320
I know you don't want to go,
but you have to.

671
00:40:06,388 --> 00:40:09,891
- Your mother came all the way out here.
- You don't know my mother.

672
00:40:09,958 --> 00:40:11,492
Sally.

673
00:40:13,862 --> 00:40:16,130
Sally,

674
00:40:16,198 --> 00:40:18,900
sometimes we have to do things
we don't want to do.

675
00:40:18,967 --> 00:40:21,402
- Shut up.
- What's gotten into you?

676
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:24,338
- I don't think I'm helping here.
- We don't want your help.

677
00:40:24,406 --> 00:40:28,509
- Let's go, now.
- Stop it! No! Stop it!

678
00:40:47,696 --> 00:40:49,397
It's gonna be all right.

679
00:40:49,465 --> 00:40:51,732
No, it's not.

680
00:40:56,705 --> 00:40:58,406
I fall all the time.

681
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:04,078
I was coming to get you.

682
00:41:04,146 --> 00:41:06,914
Mrs.... Your...

683
00:41:06,982 --> 00:41:08,783
Sally's mother is in reception.

684
00:41:10,552 --> 00:41:12,453
Thank you.

685
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:25,933
I was worried about you.

686
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:39,213
Come on, let's go.

687
00:41:39,281 --> 00:41:40,848
I was waiting in the lobby at 5:00.

688
00:41:40,916 --> 00:41:43,885
- We lost track of time.
- Well, now I'm late.

689
00:41:46,355 --> 00:41:48,256
Sally?

690
00:41:48,323 --> 00:41:51,459
- Say goodbye to your father.
- Goodbye.

691
00:41:54,863 --> 00:41:56,264
Excuse me.

692
00:41:59,635 --> 00:42:01,269
Thank you.

693
00:42:12,114 --> 00:42:15,416
Hi. Are you here to see Peggy?

694
00:42:23,992 --> 00:42:25,793
Can you make me one of those?

695
00:42:27,129 --> 00:42:29,797
No. No, I can't.

696
00:42:31,867 --> 00:42:34,936
- I can't do anything for you.
- Why are you upset?

697
00:42:35,003 --> 00:42:36,671
You shouldn't have put me in that position.

698
00:42:38,106 --> 00:42:39,941
Things happen. I didn't plan it.

699
00:42:40,008 --> 00:42:41,542
You asked me to go watch her.

700
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:43,411
There was no one else to do it.

701
00:42:43,478 --> 00:42:46,213
And just now? What the hell was that?

702
00:42:46,281 --> 00:42:48,583
I'm not good with kids.

703
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:50,785
That was not your fault.

704
00:42:50,852 --> 00:42:53,321
Well, it feels like there was
a test and I failed it.

705
00:42:56,425 --> 00:42:58,059
God knows I'd be lying

706
00:42:58,126 --> 00:42:59,794
if I said it didn't cross my mind:

707
00:42:59,861 --> 00:43:02,430
Would I meet your children?
When would I meet your children?

708
00:43:02,497 --> 00:43:04,732
But I don't have any.

709
00:43:16,311 --> 00:43:18,012
I'm sorry.

710
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:21,716
I love children, but I chose
to be where I am.

711
00:43:23,585 --> 00:43:25,453
I don't view it as a failure.

712
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,288
It doesn't matter.

713
00:43:30,425 --> 00:43:32,393
I mean it.

714
00:43:39,167 --> 00:43:41,302
Jesus. What a mess.

715
00:43:44,606 --> 00:43:46,440
Part of it's good, right?

716
00:43:50,345 --> 00:43:51,545
Yeah.

717
00:44:01,189 --> 00:44:04,225
I'm gonna go. I didn't really sleep.

718
00:44:08,163 --> 00:44:11,198
We can have dinner this weekend.
I'll pick a place.

719
00:44:11,266 --> 00:44:12,733
Good.

720
00:44:36,792 --> 00:44:39,026
Why are you drinking here?

721
00:44:39,094 --> 00:44:41,395
Come on.

722
00:44:41,463 --> 00:44:44,565
I don't know what kind of surprise
you're gonna spring on me.

723
00:44:46,935 --> 00:44:48,803
So Abe Drexler pulled a boner.

724
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:50,438
It's to be expected.

725
00:44:51,773 --> 00:44:53,340
He seemed so nice.

726
00:44:53,408 --> 00:44:57,144
He's a man. He won't be happy
until he turns you out.

727
00:44:57,212 --> 00:44:58,512
What's that supposed to mean?

728
00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:00,648
Gotta be their girl.

729
00:45:00,716 --> 00:45:04,285
It's the way they want it.
Maybe it's biology.

730
00:45:04,352 --> 00:45:07,221
It's like men are this vegetable soup

731
00:45:07,289 --> 00:45:10,357
and we can't put 'em on a plate
or eat 'em off the counter.

732
00:45:10,425 --> 00:45:13,260
So women are the pot. They heat 'em up.

733
00:45:13,328 --> 00:45:15,396
They hold 'em. They contain them.

734
00:45:17,499 --> 00:45:19,600
But who wants to be a pot?

735
00:45:19,668 --> 00:45:21,602
Who the hell said we're not soup?

736
00:45:22,938 --> 00:45:24,672
I don't think that's true.

737
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:26,741
It's been my experience.

738
00:45:28,543 --> 00:45:31,612
But you know, I wouldn't
have helped Abe out

739
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:34,348
if I didn't think he was
some very interesting soup.

740
00:45:37,819 --> 00:45:39,587
Listen, go ahead without me.

741
00:45:39,654 --> 00:45:41,722
Another time.

742
00:45:41,790 --> 00:45:43,824
Are you angry or lovesick?

743
00:45:45,093 --> 00:45:46,393
I don't know.

744
00:45:48,563 --> 00:45:49,997
Night, Peg.

745
00:46:29,004 --> 00:46:30,805
Could you hold that?

746
00:46:33,408 --> 00:46:34,942
Hello.

747
00:47:08,243 --> 00:47:10,200
