Season 1 Episode 1
<i>Smoke Gets In Your Eyes</i>

2
00:01:22,223 --> 00:01:23,223
Old Gold man, huh?

3
00:01:25,162 --> 00:01:26,162
Lucky Strike here.

4
00:01:28,283 --> 00:01:30,778
Can I ask you a question?
Why do you smoke Old Gold?

5
00:01:30,907 --> 00:01:33,153
I'm sorry, sir.
Is Sam here bothering you?

6
00:01:33,974 --> 00:01:35,342
He can be
a little chatty.

7
00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:38,830
No, we're actually just
having a conversation.

8
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:39,909
Is that okay?

9
00:01:40,912 --> 00:01:42,385
Can I get you
another drink?

10
00:01:42,601 --> 00:01:43,945
Yeah. Do this again.

11
00:01:44,347 --> 00:01:45,504
Old-fashioned, please.

12
00:01:47,849 --> 00:01:50,436
So you obviously need to relax
after working here all night.

13
00:01:50,784 --> 00:01:52,502
I guess.
I don't know.

14
00:01:52,794 --> 00:01:54,188
But what is it?
I mean, low-tar?

15
00:01:54,224 --> 00:01:56,464
Those new filters?
Why, I mean, why Old Gold?

16
00:01:57,286 --> 00:01:59,160
They gave 'em to us
in the service...

17
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:00,476
a carton a week
for free.

18
00:02:00,863 --> 00:02:02,613
So you're used to 'em,
is that it?

19
00:02:02,614 --> 00:02:03,614
Yeah.

20
00:02:04,113 --> 00:02:05,113
They're a habit.

21
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:07,237
I could never get you
to try another brand...

22
00:02:07,238 --> 00:02:08,718
say, my Luckies?

23
00:02:09,987 --> 00:02:11,164
I love my Old Golds.

24
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:14,255
All right, well,
let's just say tomorrow

25
00:02:14,256 --> 00:02:16,466
a tobacco weevil comes
and eats every last

26
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,230
Old Gold on the planet.

27
00:02:19,647 --> 00:02:20,647
That's a sad story.

28
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:22,458
It's a tragedy.

29
00:02:23,895 --> 00:02:25,368
Would you
just stop smoking?

30
00:02:26,832 --> 00:02:28,463
I think I could
find something.

31
00:02:29,085 --> 00:02:30,085
I love smoking.

32
00:02:31,394 --> 00:02:33,288
"I love smoking. "
That's very good.

33
00:02:33,582 --> 00:02:34,582
My wife hates it.

34
00:02:34,897 --> 00:02:36,897
Reader's Digest
says it will kill you.

35
00:02:38,268 --> 00:02:39,583
Yeah,
I heard about that.

36
00:02:40,835 --> 00:02:42,308
Ladies love
their magazines.

37
00:02:45,145 --> 00:02:46,145
Yes, they do.

38
00:03:17,393 --> 00:03:19,761
You weren't worried
about waking me, were you?

39
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:21,705
Am I interrupting anything?

40
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:22,843
Mmm, no.

41
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:27,819
You're lucky
I'm still up working

42
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,020
and I'm all alone.

43
00:03:30,957 --> 00:03:31,957
How's it going?

44
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:34,520
They invented
something called

45
00:03:34,521 --> 00:03:35,521
Grandmother's Day.

46
00:03:36,145 --> 00:03:38,355
That ought to keep me
busy drawing puppies

47
00:03:38,456 --> 00:03:39,456
for a few months.

48
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:43,087
Can I run a few ideas
past you?

49
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:44,705
Does that mean what I think it means?

50
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:47,044
Because I'm familiar
with most of your ideas.

51
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:50,661
I'm having a situation
with my cigarette account.

52
00:03:51,082 --> 00:03:52,555
You really are here
to talk.

53
00:03:54,082 --> 00:03:55,831
The Trade Commission
is cracking down

54
00:03:55,832 --> 00:03:57,305
on all of our health claims.

55
00:03:57,393 --> 00:03:58,498
I getReader's Digest.

56
00:03:59,331 --> 00:04:01,752
This is the same scare
you had five years ago.

57
00:04:02,084 --> 00:04:03,084
You dealt with it.

58
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,708
I know
I slept a lot better,

59
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:05,866
knowing doctors smoke.

60
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:07,948
Well, that's just it.

61
00:04:08,153 --> 00:04:10,146
The whole "safer cigarette"
thing is over.

62
00:04:10,956 --> 00:04:12,956
No more doctors,
no more testimonials,

63
00:04:13,085 --> 00:04:15,190
no more cough-free,
soothes your T-zone,

64
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:18,249
low-tar, low-nicotine,
filter tip.

65
00:04:18,521 --> 00:04:19,521
Nothing.

66
00:04:20,143 --> 00:04:21,774
All I have
is a crush-proof box

67
00:04:22,777 --> 00:04:25,566
and "four out of five
dead people smoke your brand. "

68
00:04:26,769 --> 00:04:28,295
Is this the part
where I say,

69
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:29,755
"Don Draper
is the greatest

70
00:04:30,082 --> 00:04:32,134
ad man ever,
"and his big, strong brain

71
00:04:33,705 --> 00:04:35,081
will find a way
to lead the sheep

72
00:04:35,082 --> 00:04:36,292
to the slaughterhouse"?

73
00:04:38,209 --> 00:04:40,209
I don't want to go
to school tomorrow.

74
00:04:42,144 --> 00:04:43,582
You gonna pitch to me
or not?

75
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,425
Midge, I'm serious.
I have nothing.

76
00:04:46,269 --> 00:04:48,304
I am over, and they're
finally gonna know it.

77
00:04:48,339 --> 00:04:49,359
Next time you see me,

78
00:04:49,395 --> 00:04:52,270
there'll be a bunch of young executives
picking meat off my ribs.

79
00:04:52,768 --> 00:04:54,031
That's a pretty picture.

80
00:04:56,956 --> 00:04:57,956
What's your secret?

81
00:05:00,584 --> 00:05:02,110
Nine different ways
to say...

82
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:05,543
"I love you, Grandma. "

83
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,857
We should get married.

84
00:05:29,765 --> 00:05:31,554
You think I'd make
a good ex-wife?

85
00:05:31,887 --> 00:05:32,887
I'm serious.

86
00:05:34,198 --> 00:05:35,619
You have your own business.

87
00:05:35,822 --> 00:05:37,506
You don't mind
when I come over.

88
00:05:39,512 --> 00:05:41,143
What size Cadillac
do you take?

89
00:05:43,325 --> 00:05:44,325
You know the rules.

90
00:05:44,515 --> 00:05:46,409
I don't make plans,
and I don't make

91
00:05:46,762 --> 00:05:47,762
breakfast.

92
00:05:52,763 --> 00:05:54,815
Sterling's having
the tobacco people in

93
00:05:54,827 --> 00:05:56,616
in nine hours,
and I have nothing.

94
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:00,902
People love smoking.

95
00:06:01,349 --> 00:06:03,822
There's nothing that you,
the Trade Commission,

96
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:06,455
orReader's Digest
can do to change that.

97
00:06:13,288 --> 00:06:15,919
There's this kid who comes
by my office every day,

98
00:06:16,349 --> 00:06:18,349
looks where he's gonna
put his plants.

99
00:06:19,411 --> 00:06:20,411
Is he handsome?

100
00:06:41,849 --> 00:06:42,849
23.

101
00:06:43,349 --> 00:06:44,349
Uh, not right away.

102
00:06:44,746 --> 00:06:46,223
Pal, could you take the long way up?

103
00:06:46,224 --> 00:06:48,066
I am really enjoying
the view here.

104
00:06:48,235 --> 00:06:49,910
You going to Campbell's
bachelor party?

105
00:06:49,911 --> 00:06:51,596
Yeah, I want to be there
before they tie

106
00:06:51,597 --> 00:06:54,228
an anchor around his neck
and drag him out to sea.

107
00:06:54,285 --> 00:06:55,537
I hear
she's a nice girl.

108
00:06:55,538 --> 00:06:56,538
Eh,
who wants that?

109
00:07:02,665 --> 00:07:03,972
What did you do that for?

110
00:07:03,973 --> 00:07:05,970
She'll probably be
assigned to one of us.

111
00:07:05,971 --> 00:07:07,471
Then she'll know
what she's in for.

112
00:07:07,472 --> 00:07:09,726
You got to let them know
what kind of guy you are.

113
00:07:09,727 --> 00:07:11,534
Then they'll know
what kind of girl to be.

114
00:07:11,535 --> 00:07:14,431
I have a feeling we won't be going
to your bachelor party soon.

115
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:17,038
Yeah, well, compared to Campbell,
I'm a Boy Scout.

116
00:07:17,849 --> 00:07:19,470
Excuse me.
Is he expecting you?

117
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:20,944
He's not expecting anything.

118
00:07:23,158 --> 00:07:25,203
Oh, honey, don't worry.
I'll get home safely.

119
00:07:26,703 --> 00:07:28,434
I have an important
appointment right now,

120
00:07:28,506 --> 00:07:30,526
so why don't you go
shopping or something?

121
00:07:30,881 --> 00:07:32,249
Take your mother to lunch.

122
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:33,515
Tell her it was my idea.

123
00:07:34,004 --> 00:07:35,004
Wow. He's good.

124
00:07:35,692 --> 00:07:37,428
It's just
a bachelor party, dear.

125
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:40,992
No, I really don't know
what they have planned,

126
00:07:41,283 --> 00:07:43,524
but judging from
the creative brain power around here,

127
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,395
we'll probably end up
seeing My Fair Lady.

128
00:07:47,894 --> 00:07:48,894
I'll tell you what.

129
00:07:49,334 --> 00:07:51,205
I'll drop by your place
on my way home.

130
00:07:51,206 --> 00:07:53,469
Your mother can check
under my fingernails.

131
00:07:54,643 --> 00:07:55,748
Of course I love you.

132
00:07:57,209 --> 00:07:59,682
I'm giving up my life
to be with you, aren't I?

133
00:08:03,728 --> 00:08:04,728
What a great gal.

134
00:08:06,535 --> 00:08:08,429
I tell ya, boys,
she stole my heart.

135
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:12,225
And her old man's
loaded.

136
00:08:15,159 --> 00:08:16,722
Now, this is
the executive floor.

137
00:08:16,723 --> 00:08:18,670
It should be organized,
but it's not,

138
00:08:18,848 --> 00:08:20,584
so you'll find
account executives

139
00:08:20,597 --> 00:08:23,018
and creative executives
all mixed in together.

140
00:08:23,305 --> 00:08:25,419
- Please don't ask me the difference.
- Great.

141
00:08:25,444 --> 00:08:28,222
Hopefully, if you follow my lead,
you can avoid some of the mistakes

142
00:08:28,223 --> 00:08:29,295
I've made here.

143
00:08:29,348 --> 00:08:31,163
- Hello, Joan.
- Like that one.

144
00:08:33,449 --> 00:08:36,511
- So how many trains did it take you?
- Only one, but I got up very early.

145
00:08:36,554 --> 00:08:38,333
In a couple of years,
with the right moves,

146
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:40,431
you'll be in the city
with the rest of us.

147
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:42,396
Of course,
if you really make the right moves,

148
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:45,353
you'll be out in the country,
and you won't be going to work at all.

149
00:08:46,345 --> 00:08:48,284
You'll be here
just across the aisle from me.

150
00:08:48,285 --> 00:08:50,574
We'll both take care of Mr. Draper
for the time being.

151
00:08:50,911 --> 00:08:52,409
I don't know what your goals are,

152
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:54,098
but don't overdo it with the perfume.

153
00:08:54,099 --> 00:08:56,284
Keep a fifth of something
in your desk.

154
00:08:56,347 --> 00:08:57,504
Mr. Draper drinks dry.

155
00:08:58,035 --> 00:09:00,738
Also, invest in some
aspirin, Band-Aids,

156
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,296
and a needle and thread.

157
00:09:03,038 --> 00:09:04,248
Rye is Canadian, right?

158
00:09:04,288 --> 00:09:05,340
You better find out.

159
00:09:07,035 --> 00:09:08,721
He may act like
he wants a secretary,

160
00:09:08,722 --> 00:09:10,838
but most of the time,
they're looking for something

161
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,288
between a mother and a waitress.

162
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:14,521
And the rest
of the time, well...

163
00:09:20,161 --> 00:09:21,470
Go home,
take a paper bag,

164
00:09:21,471 --> 00:09:23,155
and cut some eyeholes
out of it.

165
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:24,970
Put it over your head,
get undressed,

166
00:09:24,971 --> 00:09:26,813
and look at yourself
in the mirror.

167
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,724
Really evaluate
where your strengths

168
00:09:28,725 --> 00:09:30,514
and weaknesses are,
and be honest.

169
00:09:31,659 --> 00:09:33,027
I always try to be honest.

170
00:09:34,162 --> 00:09:35,162
Good for you.

171
00:09:36,766 --> 00:09:39,369
Now, try not to be overwhelmed
by all this technology.

172
00:09:39,409 --> 00:09:40,503
It looks complicated,

173
00:09:40,533 --> 00:09:43,354
but the men who designed it made it
simple enough for a woman to use.

174
00:09:43,376 --> 00:09:44,436
I sure hope so.

175
00:09:44,471 --> 00:09:46,471
At lunch, pick up
a box of chocolates,

176
00:09:46,785 --> 00:09:48,847
a dozen carnations,
and some bath salts.

177
00:09:48,848 --> 00:09:50,977
- I'll explain later.
- Thank you, Miss Holloway.

178
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:53,408
You're really wonderful for looking out
for me this way.

179
00:09:53,911 --> 00:09:54,911
It's Joan.

180
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:56,831
And listen,
don't take this

181
00:09:58,222 --> 00:09:59,974
the wrong way,
but a girl like you,

182
00:09:59,975 --> 00:10:01,711
with those darling
little ankles,

183
00:10:01,847 --> 00:10:03,531
I'd find a way
to make 'em sing.

184
00:10:05,536 --> 00:10:06,746
Also, men love scarves.

185
00:10:07,724 --> 00:10:09,039
Good morning, Mr. Draper.

186
00:10:10,604 --> 00:10:11,709
Oh! And Mr. Sterling.

187
00:10:11,973 --> 00:10:12,973
How are you?

188
00:10:12,974 --> 00:10:13,974
Morning, girls.

189
00:10:17,356 --> 00:10:19,472
You look like a hundred bucks.
Long night?

190
00:10:19,922 --> 00:10:21,764
It's not this
tobacco thing, is it?

191
00:10:21,847 --> 00:10:22,952
It's been on my mind.

192
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,686
Yeah, well,
I should hope so.

193
00:10:24,784 --> 00:10:27,222
Lee Garner, his father,
the whole Lucky Strike family

194
00:10:27,223 --> 00:10:28,223
will be here at 4.

195
00:10:29,483 --> 00:10:30,483
You worried?

196
00:10:31,276 --> 00:10:32,276
No.

197
00:10:32,569 --> 00:10:34,554
If I was worried,
I'd ask you what you've got,

198
00:10:34,586 --> 00:10:37,264
but I'm not, so I'm just going to assume
you've got something,

199
00:10:37,361 --> 00:10:39,044
which means you should be worried.

200
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:42,379
So you came here because you wanted
to watch me get dressed?

201
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:45,023
No, I wanted to make sure
you were here.

202
00:10:45,024 --> 00:10:46,813
In body. Give me
about a half hour

203
00:10:47,025 --> 00:10:48,025
for the rest of it.

204
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:49,898
Oh.

205
00:10:51,152 --> 00:10:52,152
How do I put this?

206
00:10:52,214 --> 00:10:53,687
Have we
ever hired any Jews?

207
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:55,839
Not on my watch.

208
00:10:56,464 --> 00:10:58,308
That's very funny.
It's not what I meant.

209
00:10:59,212 --> 00:11:00,317
We've got an Italian.

210
00:11:00,713 --> 00:11:02,134
Salvatore, my art director.

211
00:11:02,463 --> 00:11:03,673
That won't work.
Sorry.

212
00:11:04,641 --> 00:11:06,773
Most of the Jewish guys
work for the Jewish firms.

213
00:11:06,774 --> 00:11:07,774
Yeah, I know.

214
00:11:07,963 --> 00:11:09,776
Selling Jewish products
to Jewish people.

215
00:11:09,777 --> 00:11:10,777
That's very good.

216
00:11:10,939 --> 00:11:13,313
It's just that our 11:00
is with Menken's Department Store

217
00:11:13,378 --> 00:11:16,057
and I wish we had someone to make them
feel... comfortable.

218
00:11:16,525 --> 00:11:18,542
Want me to run to the deli
and grab somebody?

219
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,452
You missed a button.

220
00:12:09,792 --> 00:12:11,055
Ah. Look at you, Gidget.

221
00:12:12,057 --> 00:12:13,718
Still trying
to fill out that bikini?

222
00:12:13,851 --> 00:12:14,851
Summer's coming.

223
00:12:15,946 --> 00:12:19,593
Without the medical claims,
all we have is a white box

224
00:12:19,726 --> 00:12:21,545
with a red spot on it.

225
00:12:22,835 --> 00:12:24,463
My neighbor posed for that.

226
00:12:24,603 --> 00:12:27,138
Believe me, he always
looks very relaxed.

227
00:12:27,853 --> 00:12:29,326
Of course,
he doesn't smoke.

228
00:12:29,418 --> 00:12:30,575
Had him hold a pencil.

229
00:12:30,615 --> 00:12:33,288
If I know these guys, you're better off
with a little sex appeal.

230
00:12:33,289 --> 00:12:35,499
Can you give me a woman
in a bathing suit,

231
00:12:35,851 --> 00:12:36,977
put her next to your guy?

232
00:12:36,978 --> 00:12:37,978
A sexy girl?

233
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:39,229
I can do that.

234
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:40,795
Give you a chance to get a real model.

235
00:12:40,871 --> 00:12:42,598
Oh, I love my work.

236
00:12:43,119 --> 00:12:45,243
Speaking of sexy girls,
are you going to Pete's

237
00:12:45,244 --> 00:12:46,244
bachelor party?

238
00:12:46,496 --> 00:12:48,274
I'm not really big
on those things.

239
00:12:48,275 --> 00:12:49,275
Tell me about it.

240
00:12:49,586 --> 00:12:50,691
It's so embarrassing.

241
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:52,401
If a girl's gonna shake it in my face,

242
00:12:52,455 --> 00:12:54,494
I want to be alone
so I can do something.

243
00:12:56,088 --> 00:12:58,403
Should we drink before
the meeting or after?

244
00:12:58,961 --> 00:12:59,961
Or both?

245
00:13:01,335 --> 00:13:02,440
So... that's it, huh?

246
00:13:04,273 --> 00:13:05,273
Relax?

247
00:13:05,274 --> 00:13:06,484
Don't be short with me.

248
00:13:07,085 --> 00:13:08,085
You're the writer.

249
00:13:08,335 --> 00:13:09,861
I thought
it was worth a try.

250
00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:12,635
Greta Guttman
is here to see you.

251
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:14,476
- Send her in.
- Oh, great.

252
00:13:14,587 --> 00:13:16,902
Now we get to hear from
our man in research.

253
00:13:19,961 --> 00:13:23,304
Mr. Draper, Mr. Romano,
you both seemed more relaxed

254
00:13:23,463 --> 00:13:24,463
than I expected.

255
00:13:24,961 --> 00:13:27,372
Do you have some kind of surprise
for the tobacco people?

256
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,117
I'm doing
my own research.

257
00:13:29,118 --> 00:13:31,424
If you're planning to continue with
medical testimony,

258
00:13:31,489 --> 00:13:34,079
you'll only be inviting
further government interference.

259
00:13:34,682 --> 00:13:35,997
We must police ourselves.

260
00:13:36,056 --> 00:13:38,154
- There's your slogan.
- The medical thing is dead.

261
00:13:38,187 --> 00:13:39,681
- We understand that.
- Yes, dead.

262
00:13:39,682 --> 00:13:42,103
An apt choice of words,
considering the public

263
00:13:42,242 --> 00:13:44,475
is convinced
that cigarettes are poisonous.

264
00:13:44,676 --> 00:13:46,154
If we can't insist that they're not,

265
00:13:46,229 --> 00:13:48,604
I believe my most recent surveys
have provided a solution.

266
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,484
We can still suggest that cigarettes
are part of American life,

267
00:13:51,937 --> 00:13:53,437
or too good to give up,

268
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,910
or, most appealing,
an assertion of independence.

269
00:13:56,029 --> 00:13:58,608
So, basically, if you love danger,
you'll love smoking.

270
00:13:58,681 --> 00:14:00,868
We can put a skull
and crossbones on the label.

271
00:14:00,869 --> 00:14:01,869
I love it.

272
00:14:02,621 --> 00:14:04,181
Before the war,
when I studied

273
00:14:04,182 --> 00:14:05,991
with Adler in Vienna,
we postulated

274
00:14:05,992 --> 00:14:07,939
that what Freud called
the death wish

275
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:09,804
is as powerful a drive
as those for

276
00:14:09,805 --> 00:14:12,120
sexual reproduction
and physical sustenance.

277
00:14:12,305 --> 00:14:13,305
Freud, you say?

278
00:14:13,806 --> 00:14:15,016
What agency is he with?

279
00:14:15,368 --> 00:14:16,682
We're supposed
to believe

280
00:14:16,683 --> 00:14:18,472
that people are all
living one way

281
00:14:18,744 --> 00:14:20,901
and secretly thinking
the exact opposite?

282
00:14:21,429 --> 00:14:22,429
That's ridiculous.

283
00:14:23,147 --> 00:14:24,869
Let me tell you something,
Miss Guttman...

284
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:25,870
Doctor.

285
00:14:26,431 --> 00:14:27,431
Dr. Guttman.

286
00:14:27,993 --> 00:14:30,414
Psychology might be great
at cocktail parties,

287
00:14:31,181 --> 00:14:33,917
but it so happens that people
were buying cigarettes

288
00:14:34,056 --> 00:14:35,213
before Freud was born.

289
00:14:36,056 --> 00:14:38,368
The issue here isn't
why should people smoke.

290
00:14:38,369 --> 00:14:40,579
It's why should people
smoke Lucky Strike.

291
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:43,482
Suggesting
that our customers have a...

292
00:14:43,872 --> 00:14:44,977
What did you call it?

293
00:14:44,996 --> 00:14:45,996
A death wish?

294
00:14:46,807 --> 00:14:48,754
I just don't see that
on a billboard.

295
00:14:48,867 --> 00:14:51,305
So what ifReader's Digest
says they're dangerous?

296
00:14:51,306 --> 00:14:53,779
They also saidBambiwas
the book of the century.

297
00:14:54,121 --> 00:14:55,121
There's no proof.

298
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:57,056
There's conclusive proof
that none of these

299
00:14:57,057 --> 00:14:59,372
low-tar, low-nicotine,
or filtration systems

300
00:15:00,055 --> 00:15:01,429
have any effect
on the incidences

301
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:02,430
of lung cancer.

302
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:04,456
Just give me the damn report.

303
00:15:04,555 --> 00:15:06,607
I think you'll find it
very convincing.

304
00:15:06,619 --> 00:15:07,619
I'm sure I will.

305
00:15:07,974 --> 00:15:11,130
You're the one who found all of our
medical testimonials in the first place.

306
00:15:11,305 --> 00:15:13,996
- That's true, Mr. Drape but I...
- Has anyone else seen this?

307
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:15,429
Of course not.
It's your account.

308
00:15:15,431 --> 00:15:16,431
Good.

309
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:20,804
I don't want to hear
about it anymore.

310
00:15:20,805 --> 00:15:23,401
I'm sorry. I just find
your whole approach perverse.

311
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,935
Good luck at the meeting.

312
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,364
I'm sure it will be a quick one.

313
00:15:35,448 --> 00:15:37,026
Sal, I'll take that drink now.

314
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:17,690
Mr. Draper.

315
00:16:19,807 --> 00:16:20,807
Excuse me.

316
00:16:22,117 --> 00:16:23,117
Mr. Draper.

317
00:16:23,681 --> 00:16:26,365
I'm sorry to wake you,
but Mr. Campbell is outside.

318
00:16:28,524 --> 00:16:30,430
He doesn't know
I'm sleeping in here, does he?

319
00:16:30,532 --> 00:16:32,494
- No, sir.
- That's good.

320
00:16:34,096 --> 00:16:35,178
Who are you?

321
00:16:35,179 --> 00:16:37,120
I'm Peggy Olson.
The new girl.

322
00:16:41,996 --> 00:16:44,048
Can you go out there
and entertain him?

323
00:16:47,555 --> 00:16:48,747
I know it's my first day

324
00:16:48,834 --> 00:16:52,382
and I don't want to seem uncooperative,
but do I have to?

325
00:16:54,242 --> 00:16:55,242
I see your point.

326
00:16:56,368 --> 00:16:57,789
I brought you some aspirin.

327
00:17:02,746 --> 00:17:03,746
Send him in.

328
00:17:05,994 --> 00:17:07,572
You look like
a hundred bucks.

329
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:09,724
Ready to go sweet-talk
some retail Jews?

330
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:12,119
You are tough to take
first thing in the morning, Pete.

331
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,698
I've never
had any complaints.

332
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:16,508
Speaking of which,
who's your little friend here?

333
00:17:16,554 --> 00:17:17,554
She's the new girl.

334
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:19,342
You always
get the new girl.

335
00:17:19,682 --> 00:17:21,260
Management
gets all the perks.

336
00:17:22,305 --> 00:17:23,673
Where are you from,
honey?

337
00:17:23,983 --> 00:17:25,719
Miss Deaver's
Secretarial School.

338
00:17:25,982 --> 00:17:26,982
Top notch.

339
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:30,861
But I meant where are you from?
Are you Amish or something?

340
00:17:31,985 --> 00:17:33,977
No. I'm from Brooklyn.

341
00:17:35,111 --> 00:17:36,637
Well, you're in the city now.

342
00:17:36,672 --> 00:17:38,607
It wouldn't be a sin
for us to see your legs.

343
00:17:38,608 --> 00:17:41,296
If you pull your waist in,
you might look like a woman.

344
00:17:41,297 --> 00:17:42,560
Is that all, Mr. Draper?

345
00:17:42,671 --> 00:17:44,236
Hey, I'm not done here.

346
00:17:44,727 --> 00:17:46,018
I'm working my way up.

347
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:47,734
That will be all.

348
00:17:47,861 --> 00:17:48,861
Peggy, right?

349
00:17:49,295 --> 00:17:50,295
Yes.

350
00:17:50,296 --> 00:17:52,453
Oh, and it's time
for your 11:00 meeting.

351
00:17:52,777 --> 00:17:54,798
Oh, and sorry about
Mr. Campbell here.

352
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:57,377
He left his manners back
at the fraternity house.

353
00:18:01,062 --> 00:18:03,009
She's a little young
for you, Draper.

354
00:18:03,325 --> 00:18:05,500
The future Mrs. Pete Campbell
is a very lucky woman.

355
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,160
- When's the wedding again?
- Sunday.

356
00:18:07,196 --> 00:18:09,251
Did Ken tell you about the bachelor
party tonight?

357
00:18:09,252 --> 00:18:10,252
He sure did.

358
00:18:10,437 --> 00:18:12,068
So do I get
first crack at her?

359
00:18:12,186 --> 00:18:14,870
Word is she took down more
sailors thanThe Arizona.

360
00:18:15,252 --> 00:18:16,409
How old are you, Pete?

361
00:18:16,752 --> 00:18:17,752
I just turned 26.

362
00:18:18,189 --> 00:18:20,838
I bet the whole world looks like
one great big brassiere strap

363
00:18:21,062 --> 00:18:22,483
just waiting
to be snapped.

364
00:18:23,116 --> 00:18:24,800
You are good
with words, Draper.

365
00:18:25,086 --> 00:18:27,429
Campbell, we're both men here,
so I'm gonna be direct.

366
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:29,640
Christ, are you already
sleeping with her?

367
00:18:30,177 --> 00:18:31,966
Advertising is
a very small world,

368
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:34,555
and when you do something
like malign the reputation

369
00:18:34,556 --> 00:18:37,029
of a girl from the steno pool
on her first day,

370
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:38,805
you make it even smaller.

371
00:18:39,241 --> 00:18:41,451
Keep it up, and even
if you do get my job,

372
00:18:41,741 --> 00:18:43,214
you'll never run this place.

373
00:18:43,742 --> 00:18:45,429
You'll die
in that corner office,

374
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:47,617
a mid-level executive
with a little bit of hair

375
00:18:47,618 --> 00:18:49,460
who women go home with
out of pity.

376
00:18:50,927 --> 00:18:51,927
Want to know why?

377
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,706
Because
no one will like you.

378
00:19:01,929 --> 00:19:03,876
Oh! Here are our
miracle-workers now.

379
00:19:04,462 --> 00:19:05,867
You know Pete Campbell, of course,

380
00:19:05,868 --> 00:19:08,338
your account executive
if you choose to do business with us.

381
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:09,944
And this handsome fellow is Don Draper,

382
00:19:09,945 --> 00:19:11,756
the best creative director in New York.

383
00:19:11,757 --> 00:19:13,230
Well, at least the building.

384
00:19:13,271 --> 00:19:14,481
A pleasure to meet you.

385
00:19:15,136 --> 00:19:17,008
- Sorry about that.
- I'm Rachel Menken.

386
00:19:18,006 --> 00:19:20,564
Oh. Uh, sorry.
I was expecting...

387
00:19:20,756 --> 00:19:22,545
You were expecting me to be a man.

388
00:19:22,818 --> 00:19:23,818
My father was, too.

389
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:26,980
And you are?

390
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:30,707
Why, Don,
you remember David Cohen

391
00:19:31,229 --> 00:19:32,492
from the art department.

392
00:19:32,731 --> 00:19:34,181
Of course! David.

393
00:19:34,354 --> 00:19:36,880
One of the rising stars
here at Sterling Cooper.

394
00:19:37,466 --> 00:19:39,167
Why don't we make
ourselves comfortable?

395
00:19:39,168 --> 00:19:41,291
Miss Menken,
you can tell us what you have in mind.

396
00:19:41,292 --> 00:19:42,292
Wonderful.

397
00:19:44,729 --> 00:19:45,729
That's very subtle.

398
00:19:46,044 --> 00:19:47,201
Isn't that your shirt?

399
00:19:47,354 --> 00:19:49,732
Had to go all the way to the mailroom,
but I found one.

400
00:20:11,995 --> 00:20:13,416
So you must be Peggy Olson.

401
00:20:17,931 --> 00:20:19,309
Joan Holloway sent you over.

402
00:20:19,372 --> 00:20:20,863
She's a great girl.
How is Joan?

403
00:20:21,057 --> 00:20:22,214
She sends her regards.

404
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:23,621
She's a lot of fun.

405
00:20:24,182 --> 00:20:25,971
Must be a scream
to work with her.

406
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,928
Yes, it's pretty
terrific.

407
00:20:31,432 --> 00:20:33,168
Try to make yourself
comfortable.

408
00:20:33,182 --> 00:20:34,182
Relax.

409
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:44,171
I see from your chart,
and your finger,

410
00:20:45,794 --> 00:20:47,057
that you're not married.

411
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:48,479
That's right.

412
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:51,770
And yet you're interested
in the contraceptive pills.

413
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:53,918
Well, I was...

414
00:20:54,606 --> 00:20:55,855
No reason to be nervous.

415
00:20:55,856 --> 00:20:58,291
Joan sent you to me
because I'm not here to judge you.

416
00:20:58,292 --> 00:21:00,403
There's nothing wrong
with a woman being practical

417
00:21:00,456 --> 00:21:02,388
about the possibility
of sexual activity.

418
00:21:03,105 --> 00:21:04,105
Spread your knees.

419
00:21:05,293 --> 00:21:06,345
That's good to hear.

420
00:21:06,981 --> 00:21:09,042
Although, as a doctor,
I'd like to think

421
00:21:09,043 --> 00:21:11,043
that putting a woman
in this situation

422
00:21:11,106 --> 00:21:13,684
is not gonna turn her
into some kind of strumpet.

423
00:21:15,169 --> 00:21:17,167
Slide your fanny toward me.
I'm not gonna bite.

424
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:28,393
I'll warn you now,
I will take you off this

425
00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:30,569
medicine if you abuse it.

426
00:21:32,019 --> 00:21:33,650
It's for your own good,
really.

427
00:21:35,397 --> 00:21:37,397
The fact is,
even in our modern times,

428
00:21:38,585 --> 00:21:40,216
easy women
don't find husbands.

429
00:21:44,957 --> 00:21:46,325
I understand,
Dr. Emerson.

430
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:48,583
I really am a very
responsible person.

431
00:21:50,209 --> 00:21:52,209
I'm sure you're not
that kind of girl.

432
00:21:52,709 --> 00:21:53,709
Now, Joan...

433
00:21:54,773 --> 00:21:56,824
I'm just kidding along here.
You can get dressed.

434
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:02,504
I'm gonna write you
a prescription for Enovid.

435
00:22:03,645 --> 00:22:05,539
They're $11 a month,
but don't think

436
00:22:05,771 --> 00:22:08,034
you have to go out
and become the town pump

437
00:22:08,082 --> 00:22:09,713
just to get
your money's worth.

438
00:22:10,894 --> 00:22:11,894
Excuse my French.

439
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:18,018
So what Don is saying
is that through

440
00:22:18,019 --> 00:22:19,957
a variety of media,
including a spot during

441
00:22:19,958 --> 00:22:22,084
The Danny Thomas Show,
if you can afford it,

442
00:22:22,085 --> 00:22:23,644
we could really boost
awareness.

443
00:22:23,645 --> 00:22:26,276
Then, a 10% off coupon
in select ladies' magazines

444
00:22:26,956 --> 00:22:29,008
will increase your
first-time visitors.

445
00:22:29,082 --> 00:22:30,766
Once we get them
into the store,

446
00:22:30,895 --> 00:22:31,895
the rest...

447
00:22:33,145 --> 00:22:34,250
is kind of up to you.

448
00:22:34,894 --> 00:22:36,893
Mr. Draper, our store
is 60 years old.

449
00:22:36,894 --> 00:22:38,525
We share a wall
with Tiffany's.

450
00:22:39,459 --> 00:22:40,459
Honestly, a coupon?

451
00:22:42,707 --> 00:22:44,075
Miss Menken, coupons work.

452
00:22:44,876 --> 00:22:46,957
I think your father would
agree with the strategy.

453
00:22:46,958 --> 00:22:51,556
He might, but he's not here because
we just had our lowest sales year ever.

454
00:22:52,643 --> 00:22:53,958
So I suppose
what I think

455
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,490
matters most right now.

456
00:22:57,643 --> 00:22:59,485
Miss Menken,
why did you come here?

457
00:22:59,831 --> 00:23:01,268
There are a dozen
other agencies

458
00:23:01,269 --> 00:23:02,900
better suited
to your... needs.

459
00:23:05,205 --> 00:23:07,645
If I wanted some man
who happened to be from the same...

460
00:23:08,332 --> 00:23:10,542
village as my father
to manage my account,

461
00:23:10,894 --> 00:23:12,578
I could have stayed
where I was.

462
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:14,734
Their research favors
coupons, too.

463
00:23:16,392 --> 00:23:18,286
It's not just research,
Miss Menken.

464
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:19,596
Housewives love coupons.

465
00:23:20,286 --> 00:23:22,022
I'm not interested
in housewives.

466
00:23:22,206 --> 00:23:23,890
What kind of people
do you want?

467
00:23:24,144 --> 00:23:26,363
I want your kind of
people, Mr. Draper:

468
00:23:26,546 --> 00:23:29,460
people who don't care about coupons,
whether or not they can afford it.

469
00:23:29,461 --> 00:23:31,947
People who are coming to the store
because it is expensive.

470
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:35,018
We obviously have
very different ideas.

471
00:23:35,267 --> 00:23:38,041
Yes, like the customer
is always right.

472
00:23:39,579 --> 00:23:42,036
Gentlemen, I really thought
you could do better than this.

473
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:45,191
Sterling Cooper has a reputation
for being innovative.

474
00:23:45,394 --> 00:23:46,956
Miss, you are way out of line.

475
00:23:46,957 --> 00:23:49,540
Don, please. Let's
not get emotional here.

476
00:23:49,642 --> 00:23:51,393
There's no reason
we can't talk this out.

477
00:23:51,394 --> 00:23:54,267
Talk out what? This silly idea
that people are gonna come

478
00:23:54,268 --> 00:23:57,243
to some store they've never been to
because it's more expensive?

479
00:23:57,329 --> 00:23:58,579
It works for Chanel.

480
00:23:58,833 --> 00:24:00,284
Menken's is not Chanel.

481
00:24:00,579 --> 00:24:02,052
That's a vote of confidence.

482
00:24:02,081 --> 00:24:04,081
What Don's saying is,
Chanel is a very

483
00:24:04,457 --> 00:24:05,720
different kind of place.

484
00:24:05,896 --> 00:24:07,896
It's French,
it's continental, it's...

485
00:24:09,204 --> 00:24:11,268
Not just another
Jewish department store?

486
00:24:11,269 --> 00:24:12,269
Exactly.

487
00:24:13,269 --> 00:24:15,805
You were right, Roger.
This place really runs on charm.

488
00:24:16,668 --> 00:24:18,179
This is ridiculous.

489
00:24:18,767 --> 00:24:20,777
I'm not gonna let a woman
talk to me like this.

490
00:24:21,019 --> 00:24:23,164
This meeting is over.
Good luck, Miss Menken.

491
00:24:35,309 --> 00:24:36,930
Hey, Don,
I don't blame you.

492
00:24:37,122 --> 00:24:38,385
She was way out of line.

493
00:24:38,627 --> 00:24:39,684
Adding money and education

494
00:24:39,685 --> 00:24:41,496
doesn't take the rude
edge out of people.

495
00:24:41,497 --> 00:24:44,049
Roger's not gonna be happy,
so I guess that's good for you.

496
00:24:45,418 --> 00:24:47,309
I'm not gonna pretend
I don't want your job,

497
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:50,053
but you were right.
I'm not great with people,

498
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:54,269
and you are. I mean, not counting
that meeting we were just in.

499
00:24:54,436 --> 00:24:57,027
So I'm kind of counting
on you to help me out.

500
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,785
There's plenty of room at the top.

501
00:25:04,121 --> 00:25:06,436
Look, I'm sorry
I was so hard on you before.

502
00:25:06,622 --> 00:25:08,411
It's just this damn
tobacco thing.

503
00:25:09,249 --> 00:25:10,617
You'll think of something.

504
00:25:10,621 --> 00:25:13,131
A man like you
I'd follow into combat blindfolded,

505
00:25:13,591 --> 00:25:15,064
and I wouldn't be the first.

506
00:25:15,217 --> 00:25:16,217
Am I right, buddy?

507
00:25:18,466 --> 00:25:20,044
Let's take it a little slower.

508
00:25:20,281 --> 00:25:22,017
I don't want to wake up pregnant.

509
00:25:31,778 --> 00:25:33,462
Dr. Emerson's a dream, isn't he?

510
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:35,028
He seemed nice.

511
00:25:35,655 --> 00:25:37,213
He has a place
in South Hampton.

512
00:25:37,214 --> 00:25:38,950
I'm not saying
that I've seen it,

513
00:25:38,968 --> 00:25:39,968
but it's beautiful.

514
00:25:41,468 --> 00:25:43,257
Now, don't be nervous,
but this is

515
00:25:43,655 --> 00:25:45,286
the nerve center
of the office.

516
00:25:46,028 --> 00:25:48,185
You and your boss rely
on the willing and

517
00:25:48,276 --> 00:25:49,802
cheerful cooperation
of a few

518
00:25:49,918 --> 00:25:50,918
skilled employees.

519
00:25:51,528 --> 00:25:53,843
Never snap, yell, or be
sarcastic with them.

520
00:25:56,216 --> 00:25:58,216
And above all,
always be a supplicant.

521
00:26:05,339 --> 00:26:07,654
I know you girls are busy,
but we've got a new one.

522
00:26:07,655 --> 00:26:09,707
Peggy, this is Marge,
Nanette, and Ivy.

523
00:26:12,278 --> 00:26:13,646
I brought you some things.

524
00:26:13,653 --> 00:26:16,021
I guess a sort of
"getting to know you" gift.

525
00:26:17,404 --> 00:26:18,982
Well, aren't you
a sweetheart.

526
00:26:19,218 --> 00:26:21,060
If I know Joan,
the candy's for me.

527
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,437
Joan, you're not fair.

528
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:24,152
You know
she has to lose 8 pounds

529
00:26:24,153 --> 00:26:25,363
by the Christmas party.

530
00:26:25,714 --> 00:26:26,924
I think you look great.

531
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:28,774
That's because
I'm sitting down.

532
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,840
You can come back and visit
any time you want, honey.

533
00:26:31,841 --> 00:26:32,998
Who does she work for?

534
00:26:33,029 --> 00:26:34,029
Don Draper.

535
00:26:34,464 --> 00:26:35,727
They got rid
of Eleanor?

536
00:26:35,841 --> 00:26:36,841
She moved on.

537
00:26:37,091 --> 00:26:38,216
Draper wasn't interested.

538
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:40,838
Well, she couldn't
get a call through.

539
00:26:40,967 --> 00:26:42,123
Rude little thing.

540
00:26:42,589 --> 00:26:44,154
I see that you've got
your hands full.

541
00:26:44,155 --> 00:26:45,523
Don't want to be
a bother.

542
00:26:45,591 --> 00:26:46,591
Nice meeting you.

543
00:26:46,671 --> 00:26:47,967
Hey,
you have great legs.

544
00:26:47,968 --> 00:26:50,502
I bet you Mr. Draper would like them
if he could see them.

545
00:26:51,342 --> 00:26:53,511
Sterling Cooper.
How may I direct your call?

546
00:26:56,903 --> 00:26:58,466
I just don't know
what we have to do

547
00:26:58,467 --> 00:27:00,730
to make these government
interlopers happy.

548
00:27:01,029 --> 00:27:03,081
They tell us to make
a safer cigarette,

549
00:27:03,405 --> 00:27:04,826
we do it,
and then suddenly

550
00:27:05,717 --> 00:27:06,927
that's not good enough.

551
00:27:07,404 --> 00:27:09,193
Might as well be
living in Russia.

552
00:27:09,465 --> 00:27:10,465
Mm. Damn straight.

553
00:27:16,216 --> 00:27:18,058
You know, this morning
I got a call

554
00:27:18,529 --> 00:27:20,739
from my competitors
at Brown & Williamson,

555
00:27:20,967 --> 00:27:23,436
and they're getting sued
by the federal government

556
00:27:23,468 --> 00:27:25,347
because of the health claims they made.

557
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,987
Yeah, we're aware of that, Mr. Garner,

558
00:27:27,032 --> 00:27:30,172
but you have to realize that through
the manipulation of the mass media,

559
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:33,403
the public is under the impression
that your cigarettes are linked to...

560
00:27:35,216 --> 00:27:36,426
certain fatal diseases.

561
00:27:38,029 --> 00:27:39,342
Manipulation of the media?

562
00:27:39,343 --> 00:27:41,027
Hell,
that's what I pay you for.

563
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:42,642
Our product is fine.

564
00:27:43,215 --> 00:27:44,215
I smoke 'em myself.

565
00:27:44,592 --> 00:27:45,802
My granddad smoked 'em.

566
00:27:45,843 --> 00:27:47,106
He died at 95 years old.

567
00:27:47,717 --> 00:27:48,874
He was hit by a truck.

568
00:27:49,154 --> 00:27:51,165
I understand.
But our hands are tied.

569
00:27:51,278 --> 00:27:54,190
We're no longer allowed to advertise
that Lucky Strikes are safe.

570
00:27:54,404 --> 00:27:55,654
What the hell
are we gonna do?

571
00:27:55,655 --> 00:27:57,549
We've already funded
our own tobacco

572
00:27:57,589 --> 00:27:59,325
research center
to put this whole

573
00:27:59,527 --> 00:28:00,527
rumor to rest.

574
00:28:00,777 --> 00:28:02,303
And that's
a very good start.

575
00:28:02,777 --> 00:28:04,250
But it may not
affect sales.

576
00:28:06,277 --> 00:28:08,119
Don, I think maybe
that's your cue.

577
00:28:11,092 --> 00:28:12,092
Well, uh...

578
00:28:13,155 --> 00:28:14,155
I have been, uh...

579
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,964
thinking quite a bit
about this,

580
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:20,090
and, uh...

581
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,362
I mean, you know I'm a
Lucky Strike man from way back, so...

582
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,917
I might have a solution.

583
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:49,215
At Sterling Cooper,
we've been pioneering

584
00:28:49,216 --> 00:28:50,952
the burgeoning field
of research,

585
00:28:51,342 --> 00:28:53,657
and our analysis shows
that the health risks

586
00:28:53,715 --> 00:28:56,715
associated with your product
is not the end of the world.

587
00:28:57,716 --> 00:29:00,294
People get in their cars
every day to go to work,

588
00:29:00,653 --> 00:29:01,758
and some of them die.

589
00:29:02,716 --> 00:29:03,716
Cars are dangerous.

590
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,174
There's nothing
you can do about it.

591
00:29:08,091 --> 00:29:10,248
You still have to get
where you're going.

592
00:29:11,402 --> 00:29:13,517
Cigarettes are exactly the same,

593
00:29:13,814 --> 00:29:15,410
so why don't we simply say,

594
00:29:15,842 --> 00:29:17,605
"So what if cigarettes are dangerous?

595
00:29:18,557 --> 00:29:19,557
"You're a man.

596
00:29:20,029 --> 00:29:21,292
"The world is dangerous.

597
00:29:22,091 --> 00:29:23,248
"Smoke your cigarette.

598
00:29:23,776 --> 00:29:26,039
You still have to get
where you're going. "

599
00:29:27,731 --> 00:29:28,994
That's very interesting.

600
00:29:30,607 --> 00:29:33,263
I mean, if cigarettes
were dangerous,

601
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:35,917
- it would be interesting.
- Except they aren't.

602
00:29:36,672 --> 00:29:37,672
That's your slogan?

603
00:29:38,293 --> 00:29:40,608
"You're going to die anyway.
Die with us"?

604
00:29:41,107 --> 00:29:42,796
Actually, it's a fairly well-established

605
00:29:42,797 --> 00:29:47,315
psychological principle
that society has a death wish,

606
00:29:48,137 --> 00:29:49,979
and if we could
just tap into that,

607
00:29:50,576 --> 00:29:51,700
the market potential is...

608
00:29:51,701 --> 00:29:53,447
What the hell are you
talking about?

609
00:29:53,448 --> 00:29:54,448
Are you insane?

610
00:29:55,012 --> 00:29:56,387
I'm not
selling rifles here.

611
00:29:56,388 --> 00:29:57,861
I'm in the tobacco
business.

612
00:29:58,452 --> 00:29:59,609
We're selling America.

613
00:30:00,122 --> 00:30:02,227
The Indian gave it to us, for shit sake.

614
00:30:02,993 --> 00:30:03,993
Come on, Dad.

615
00:30:04,681 --> 00:30:05,838
Let's get out of here.

616
00:30:08,121 --> 00:30:10,015
The bright spot is,
at least we know

617
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:11,883
if we
have this problem,

618
00:30:11,932 --> 00:30:13,353
everybody
has this problem.

619
00:30:26,681 --> 00:30:29,523
Gentlemen, before you leave,
can I just say something?

620
00:30:29,556 --> 00:30:30,977
I don't know, Don. Can you?

621
00:30:35,021 --> 00:30:37,547
The Federal Trade Commission
and Reader's Digest

622
00:30:37,709 --> 00:30:38,866
have done you a favor.

623
00:30:39,335 --> 00:30:42,582
They've let you know that any ad
that brings up the concept of cigarettes

624
00:30:42,773 --> 00:30:43,992
and health together...

625
00:30:45,273 --> 00:30:47,904
well, it's just gonna
make people think of cancer.

626
00:30:48,772 --> 00:30:50,456
Yes, and we're
grateful to them.

627
00:30:52,522 --> 00:30:54,258
But what Lee, Jr.,
said is right.

628
00:30:57,335 --> 00:30:59,023
If you can't make
those health claims,

629
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:00,550
neither
can your competitors.

630
00:31:02,024 --> 00:31:03,497
So we've got
a lot of people

631
00:31:04,523 --> 00:31:06,733
not saying anything
that sells cigarettes.

632
00:31:07,708 --> 00:31:08,708
Not exactly.

633
00:31:09,708 --> 00:31:12,023
This is the greatest
advertising opportunity

634
00:31:12,146 --> 00:31:13,724
since the invention
of cereal.

635
00:31:14,835 --> 00:31:18,098
We have six identical companies
making six identical products.

636
00:31:20,146 --> 00:31:21,619
We can say anything we want.

637
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:24,083
How do you
make your cigarettes?

638
00:31:25,022 --> 00:31:26,022
I don't know.

639
00:31:26,957 --> 00:31:27,957
Shame on you.

640
00:31:29,584 --> 00:31:31,689
We breed insect-repellent
tobacco seeds,

641
00:31:32,085 --> 00:31:33,457
plant them in
the North Carolina

642
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:34,826
sunshine,
grow it, cut it,

643
00:31:35,582 --> 00:31:36,634
cure it, toast it...

644
00:31:37,649 --> 00:31:39,070
There you go. There you go.

645
00:31:48,458 --> 00:31:50,457
But everybody else's
tobacco is toasted.

646
00:31:50,458 --> 00:31:52,668
No. Everybody else's
tobacco is poisonous.

647
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:56,090
Lucky Strike...

648
00:31:56,833 --> 00:31:57,833
is toasted.

649
00:32:00,174 --> 00:32:01,971
Gentlemen,
I don't think I have to tell you

650
00:32:02,036 --> 00:32:03,396
what you just witnessed here.

651
00:32:05,148 --> 00:32:06,148
I think you do.

652
00:32:08,647 --> 00:32:10,933
Advertising
is based on one thing:

653
00:32:12,528 --> 00:32:13,528
happiness.

654
00:32:14,585 --> 00:32:16,216
And you know what happiness is?

655
00:32:16,397 --> 00:32:19,902
Happiness
is the smell of a new car.

656
00:32:20,958 --> 00:32:22,836
It's freedom from fear.

657
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:25,889
It's a billboard
on the side of the road

658
00:32:26,083 --> 00:32:29,188
that screams with reassurance
that whatever you're doing...

659
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:31,710
it's okay.

660
00:32:35,398 --> 00:32:36,398
You are okay.

661
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:46,210
It's toasted.

662
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:50,960
I get it.

663
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:03,147
You had me worried.

664
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,585
I don't know if you were drunk

665
00:33:05,586 --> 00:33:08,983
or not drunk,
but that was inspired.

666
00:33:09,603 --> 00:33:12,024
For the record,
I pulled it out of thin air,

667
00:33:12,085 --> 00:33:13,618
so thank you, up there.

668
00:33:13,959 --> 00:33:15,959
You're looking
in the wrong direction.

669
00:33:16,146 --> 00:33:18,619
So now that I've got you
in the afterglow here,

670
00:33:18,898 --> 00:33:21,494
what do you say you reconsider
this presidential campaign?

671
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:24,149
I don't know.
Bunting and babies?

672
00:33:24,835 --> 00:33:25,835
That's hard work.

673
00:33:26,274 --> 00:33:27,537
I would make hash of it.

674
00:33:28,149 --> 00:33:29,771
Modesty.
That's adorable.

675
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:32,209
Consider the product:
he's young, handsome,

676
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:33,210
Navy hero.

677
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:34,830
Honestly, it shouldn't be too difficult

678
00:33:34,841 --> 00:33:36,912
to convince America
Dick Nixon is a winner.

679
00:33:37,208 --> 00:33:38,892
Mr. Draper,
you've got visitors.

680
00:33:40,772 --> 00:33:43,035
Could you be a little
more specific, honey?

681
00:33:44,461 --> 00:33:45,882
We heard
you saved the day.

682
00:33:46,834 --> 00:33:47,886
Aw, thank you, boys.

683
00:33:48,024 --> 00:33:49,024
I appreciate it.

684
00:33:49,803 --> 00:33:51,427
I told them
how amazing you were.

685
00:33:51,428 --> 00:33:52,428
I'm still tingling.

686
00:33:53,177 --> 00:33:56,302
Looks like you're all going to engage
in a little mid-level camaraderie,

687
00:33:56,303 --> 00:33:58,804
so I'll be on my way.
Don, thanks again for the home run.

688
00:33:58,805 --> 00:34:00,015
I love to come through.

689
00:34:00,053 --> 00:34:02,943
Any chance you could patch things up
with Rachel Menken?

690
00:34:02,944 --> 00:34:05,119
Any way you can be as charming
as I said you were?

691
00:34:05,504 --> 00:34:07,508
Haven't you had enough of my magic
for one day?

692
00:34:08,194 --> 00:34:09,404
She's worth $3 million.

693
00:34:10,411 --> 00:34:11,411
You're a whore.

694
00:34:15,031 --> 00:34:16,153
Peggy...

695
00:34:16,222 --> 00:34:17,725
Could she get us a little more ice?

696
00:34:17,822 --> 00:34:18,848
Yes, Mr. Draper?

697
00:34:19,038 --> 00:34:20,200
Just a minute.

698
00:34:20,435 --> 00:34:22,808
Fellas, I think this party's gonna
have to move elsewhere.

699
00:34:22,974 --> 00:34:25,100
We'll move wherever you want,
but it's 5:15.

700
00:34:25,162 --> 00:34:26,740
The bachelor party's underway.

701
00:34:27,162 --> 00:34:28,162
I don't know.

702
00:34:28,227 --> 00:34:30,248
Oh, come on, Don.
All hands on deck.

703
00:34:30,249 --> 00:34:32,748
Aren't you gonna help
give Pete his big sendoff?

704
00:34:32,749 --> 00:34:33,749
Maybe next time.

705
00:34:37,187 --> 00:34:39,641
Come on, guys.
Don will join us later, right?

706
00:34:48,248 --> 00:34:49,686
If Greta's research
was any good,

707
00:34:49,687 --> 00:34:50,792
I would have used it.

708
00:34:52,578 --> 00:34:53,999
What are you
talking about?

709
00:34:54,203 --> 00:34:55,453
I'm saying
I had a report

710
00:34:55,454 --> 00:34:56,454
just like that.

711
00:34:56,767 --> 00:34:59,082
And it's not like there's
some magic machine

712
00:34:59,329 --> 00:35:01,329
that makes identical
copies of things.

713
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,613
I still think
she was right.

714
00:35:10,514 --> 00:35:11,829
Have a great night, Pete.

715
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:14,079
Congratulations.

716
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:25,995
I heard you were
amazing in the meeting.

717
00:35:26,828 --> 00:35:28,459
Fear stimulates
my imagination.

718
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:33,907
I just wanted to thank you
for a great first day,

719
00:35:35,642 --> 00:35:36,694
and for, you know...

720
00:35:38,515 --> 00:35:40,462
standing up for me
with Mr. Campbell.

721
00:35:56,142 --> 00:35:57,984
First of all, Peggy,
I'm your boss,

722
00:35:58,266 --> 00:35:59,266
not your boyfriend.

723
00:36:01,669 --> 00:36:03,452
Second of all,
you ever let Pete Campbell

724
00:36:03,453 --> 00:36:04,613
go through my trash again,

725
00:36:04,667 --> 00:36:07,945
and you won't be able to find a job
selling sandwiches in Penn Station.

726
00:36:10,703 --> 00:36:12,860
He said he left
his fountain pen in here.

727
00:36:13,721 --> 00:36:14,721
I didn't know.

728
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:21,258
I hope you don't think
I'm that kind of girl.

729
00:36:22,407 --> 00:36:23,407
Of course not.

730
00:36:25,093 --> 00:36:26,093
Go home.

731
00:36:26,158 --> 00:36:27,210
Put your curlers in.

732
00:36:27,468 --> 00:36:29,204
We'll get a fresh start
tomorrow.

733
00:36:31,156 --> 00:36:32,524
Oh. And, Peggy,
I need you

734
00:36:33,967 --> 00:36:34,967
to place a call.

735
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:59,467
I want to see you here every 15 minutes,
whether you have drinks or not.

736
00:36:59,544 --> 00:37:00,869
Uh, every five minutes.

737
00:37:03,284 --> 00:37:04,284
Let's live here.

738
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:07,206
Better do more
than look tonight.

739
00:37:07,344 --> 00:37:08,967
Do you have a girlfriend,
Salvatore?

740
00:37:08,968 --> 00:37:10,073
Come on. I'm Italian.

741
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:14,206
Is there some kind
of party here?

742
00:37:16,343 --> 00:37:17,448
How did you swing it?

743
00:37:17,658 --> 00:37:18,973
They work at the Automat.

744
00:37:19,217 --> 00:37:21,269
He pressed a button,
and they came out.

745
00:37:21,946 --> 00:37:23,867
I do hope we're not
interrupting anything.

746
00:37:23,932 --> 00:37:24,970
Definitely not.

747
00:37:25,084 --> 00:37:26,390
Well, I have the best seat.

748
00:37:26,449 --> 00:37:27,639
What are we drinking?

749
00:37:27,781 --> 00:37:29,970
More of whatever's making you
the way you are.

750
00:37:30,158 --> 00:37:31,158
I love this place.

751
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,614
It's hot, loud,
and filled with men.

752
00:37:35,157 --> 00:37:36,262
I know what you mean.

753
00:37:49,157 --> 00:37:50,893
Oh, my God. I can
hardly feel it.

754
00:37:51,967 --> 00:37:54,294
I have a feeling you're
like this all the time.

755
00:37:54,295 --> 00:37:55,295
I like to laugh.

756
00:37:55,592 --> 00:37:56,592
Is that right?

757
00:37:57,843 --> 00:37:58,843
Now,
you stop that.

758
00:37:59,344 --> 00:38:00,765
You said you like
to laugh.

759
00:38:01,733 --> 00:38:02,733
I mean it.

760
00:38:03,034 --> 00:38:04,034
It's... It's too...

761
00:38:04,284 --> 00:38:05,284
Too delicious.

762
00:38:06,406 --> 00:38:07,406
I said stop it.

763
00:38:07,514 --> 00:38:09,845
- What do you think you're doing?
- You know exactly.

764
00:38:11,568 --> 00:38:13,576
You know what, girls?
I think we should go.

765
00:38:13,676 --> 00:38:14,845
Oh, come on.

766
00:38:15,184 --> 00:38:16,407
You're hurting me.

767
00:38:19,407 --> 00:38:20,407
I'll be good.

768
00:38:22,845 --> 00:38:24,581
Buy the girls whatever they want.

769
00:38:31,531 --> 00:38:33,356
So, uh, what do you fellas do?

770
00:38:33,719 --> 00:38:35,843
You're looking at the finest
ad men in New York.

771
00:38:36,406 --> 00:38:37,564
Hell, the world.

772
00:39:03,783 --> 00:39:05,467
For the lady, a special Mai Tai,

773
00:39:06,716 --> 00:39:07,821
and one whiskey neat.

774
00:39:12,844 --> 00:39:16,962
So you're going
to ply me with drinks

775
00:39:17,033 --> 00:39:19,468
and convince me
what a terrible mistake I'm making.

776
00:39:21,095 --> 00:39:22,252
That is quite a drink.

777
00:39:23,266 --> 00:39:24,897
You got in trouble,
didn't you?

778
00:39:28,764 --> 00:39:30,448
I shouldn't
have lost my temper,

779
00:39:30,515 --> 00:39:32,639
and I certainly
shouldn't have treated you

780
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,015
like anything
less than a client.

781
00:39:34,016 --> 00:39:35,016
Apology accepted.

782
00:39:37,327 --> 00:39:38,327
So you understand.

783
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:40,830
Now I do.

784
00:39:41,764 --> 00:39:43,395
It was, uh,
refreshing, really.

785
00:39:45,765 --> 00:39:47,389
I mean, actually
hearing all the things

786
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:49,390
I always assumed
people were thinking.

787
00:39:52,266 --> 00:39:54,371
Well, I'm not really
as bad as all that.

788
00:39:56,828 --> 00:39:58,406
I was under
a lot of pressure.

789
00:39:59,078 --> 00:40:00,078
Another account.

790
00:40:03,139 --> 00:40:04,296
Doesn't really matter.

791
00:40:05,578 --> 00:40:06,578
No, it doesn't.

792
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:13,763
So, without
making things worse,

793
00:40:13,952 --> 00:40:15,577
can I ask you
a personal question?

794
00:40:15,578 --> 00:40:18,156
Don't you want to get
a second drink in me first?

795
00:40:18,888 --> 00:40:20,098
Why aren't you married?

796
00:40:22,328 --> 00:40:24,222
Are you asking
what's wrong with me?

797
00:40:24,418 --> 00:40:26,538
It's just that you're
a beautiful, educated woman.

798
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:28,079
Don't you think that getting married

799
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,823
and having a family
would make you happier

800
00:40:29,898 --> 00:40:31,776
than all the headaches
that go along with

801
00:40:32,164 --> 00:40:33,452
fighting people like me?

802
00:40:37,015 --> 00:40:38,513
If I weren't a woman,
I would be

803
00:40:38,514 --> 00:40:40,461
allowed to ask you
the same question,

804
00:40:41,807 --> 00:40:44,016
and if I weren't a woman,
I wouldn't have to choose

805
00:40:44,166 --> 00:40:46,669
between putting on an apron

806
00:40:46,828 --> 00:40:49,347
and the thrill
of making my father's store

807
00:40:49,453 --> 00:40:51,295
what I always thought it should be.

808
00:40:51,391 --> 00:40:53,953
So that's it.
You won't get married because

809
00:40:54,949 --> 00:40:56,830
you find business to be a thrill.

810
00:40:57,516 --> 00:40:58,516
That and...

811
00:41:02,892 --> 00:41:04,155
I've never been in love.

812
00:41:05,609 --> 00:41:08,202
She won't get married
because she's never been in love.

813
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:11,047
I think I wrote that
once to sell nylons.

814
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:14,500
For a lot of people,
love isn't just a slogan.

815
00:41:16,017 --> 00:41:17,018
Oh, you mean love.

816
00:41:17,093 --> 00:41:18,895
You mean the big
lightning bolt to the heart

817
00:41:18,896 --> 00:41:20,896
where you can't eat
and you can't work

818
00:41:21,078 --> 00:41:22,972
and you just run off
and get married

819
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:26,140
and make babies.

820
00:41:28,264 --> 00:41:29,842
The reason
you haven't felt it

821
00:41:30,265 --> 00:41:31,738
is because
it doesn't exist.

822
00:41:32,202 --> 00:41:34,675
What you call love
was invented by guys like me

823
00:41:35,705 --> 00:41:36,705
to sell nylons.

824
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:39,390
Is that right?

825
00:41:40,516 --> 00:41:41,831
I'm pretty sure
about it.

826
00:41:43,829 --> 00:41:45,454
You're born alone,
and you die alone,

827
00:41:45,455 --> 00:41:48,033
and this world just drops
a bunch of rules on you

828
00:41:48,077 --> 00:41:49,454
to make you
forget those facts,

829
00:41:49,455 --> 00:41:50,455
but I never forget.

830
00:41:53,014 --> 00:41:55,014
I'm living like there's
no tomorrow...

831
00:41:56,266 --> 00:41:57,529
because there isn't one.

832
00:42:00,266 --> 00:42:02,529
I don't think I realized
until this moment,

833
00:42:04,766 --> 00:42:06,713
but it must be hard
being a man, too.

834
00:42:10,514 --> 00:42:11,514
Excuse me?

835
00:42:13,573 --> 00:42:15,095
- Mr. Draper...
- Don.

836
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:18,447
Mr. Draper, I don't know
what it is you really believe in,

837
00:42:19,637 --> 00:42:23,045
but I do know
what it feels like to be out of place,

838
00:42:24,153 --> 00:42:25,848
to be disconnected,

839
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:29,363
to see the whole world
laid out in front of you

840
00:42:29,764 --> 00:42:31,290
the way other people
live it.

841
00:42:32,705 --> 00:42:34,178
There is something
about you

842
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,271
that tells me
you know it, too.

843
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:44,613
I don't know if that's true.

844
00:42:47,327 --> 00:42:48,537
You want another drink?

845
00:42:49,828 --> 00:42:50,828
No.

846
00:42:52,017 --> 00:42:54,490
But you can tell your boss
that you charmed me.

847
00:43:01,951 --> 00:43:04,266
So I guess we'll be
seeing each other again.

848
00:43:04,329 --> 00:43:07,109
I'll be back in the office
Monday morning, for a real meeting.

849
00:43:09,829 --> 00:43:10,829
I'd like that.

850
00:43:27,952 --> 00:43:29,320
We're not buying anything.

851
00:43:29,454 --> 00:43:31,296
Actually,
for the first time today,

852
00:43:32,016 --> 00:43:33,331
I'm not selling anything.

853
00:43:34,767 --> 00:43:35,872
Does Peggy live here?

854
00:43:36,703 --> 00:43:37,703
Hold on.

855
00:43:50,639 --> 00:43:51,639
Do you know him?

856
00:43:53,911 --> 00:43:55,644
It's okay, Marjorie.
We work together.

857
00:43:57,327 --> 00:43:58,327
He's really drunk.

858
00:43:58,578 --> 00:43:59,630
It's okay, Marjorie.

859
00:44:03,263 --> 00:44:04,263
So...

860
00:44:05,077 --> 00:44:06,077
what are you doing?

861
00:44:08,077 --> 00:44:11,271
Nothing. Just, uh, sitting in my room
listening to records.

862
00:44:11,764 --> 00:44:13,342
I'm getting married
on Sunday.

863
00:44:14,453 --> 00:44:15,453
I heard that.

864
00:44:18,702 --> 00:44:20,123
You must think I'm a creep.

865
00:44:23,453 --> 00:44:24,453
Why are you here?

866
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:36,928
I wanted to see you tonight.

867
00:44:41,952 --> 00:44:42,952
Me?

868
00:44:44,577 --> 00:44:45,577
I had to see you.

869
00:44:56,205 --> 00:44:57,205
Marjorie.

870
00:44:57,579 --> 00:44:58,579
Yeah, Peg?

871
00:45:00,013 --> 00:45:01,118
I'm going
to bed now.

872
00:46:29,169 --> 00:46:30,221
I called the office.

873
00:46:30,858 --> 00:46:31,963
They said you'd left.

874
00:46:36,548 --> 00:46:38,021
I didn't want
to bother you.

875
00:46:38,235 --> 00:46:39,235
It's no bother.

876
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:41,678
I just assumed
you were staying

877
00:46:41,921 --> 00:46:42,921

I'll be right back.

882
