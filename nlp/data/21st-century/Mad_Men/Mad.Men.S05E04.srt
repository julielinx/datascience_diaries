00:00:00,073 --> 00:00:01,826
Previously on Mad Men...

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:04,017
Just a minute.
Mr. Draper?

3
00:00:04,387 --> 00:00:05,347
Thank you, Dawn.

4
00:00:06,251 --> 00:00:07,763
She was the most qualified.

5
00:00:08,161 --> 00:00:10,201
What am I gonna do
when you go home?

6
00:00:10,395 --> 00:00:12,571
Are you really going
back to that office?

7
00:00:12,671 --> 00:00:16,294
Mohawk Airlines has chosen to
return to Starling Cooper Draper Pryce.

8
00:00:17,138 --> 00:00:19,364
Mr. Sterling will be handling
the day to day.

9
00:00:19,814 --> 00:00:22,927
My husband's been gone so long...
I feel alone.

10
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:26,217
- So I'm not getting the job.
- No! You start tomorrow.

12
00:01:13,309 --> 00:01:15,977
You sound terrible.

13
00:01:16,045 --> 00:01:18,447
You even look terrible.

14
00:01:18,515 --> 00:01:21,450
You don't.

15
00:01:21,518 --> 00:01:23,519
I'm going to stand over here.

16
00:01:23,586 --> 00:01:25,220
Fine, if you think
you'll be safe

17
00:01:25,288 --> 00:01:26,788
over there by yourself.

18
00:01:28,824 --> 00:01:31,659
- Going up.
- So am I. Thank you.

19
00:01:31,726 --> 00:01:34,462
My God, Don.

20
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:36,864
My bad penny.

21
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:40,535
Andrea, this is my wife Megan.

22
00:01:40,602 --> 00:01:42,036
Megan, this is Andrea.

23
00:01:42,103 --> 00:01:44,038
She's a freelance writer
for, you know,

24
00:01:44,105 --> 00:01:45,639
the firm.

25
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:47,740
Oh, nice to meet you.

26
00:01:47,808 --> 00:01:49,342
Yes, you as well.

27
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,614
<i>Well, goodbye.</i>

28
00:01:54,682 --> 00:01:57,484
It was nice meeting you.

29
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,920
<i>Incroyable.</i>

30
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:04,122
- Look--
- You look.

31
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:05,658
How many times is this
going to happen?

32
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:08,026
What? I worked
with her six years ago.

33
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:10,262
We're in midtown.
I'm going to run into people.

34
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,963
You know, there are
some parts of town

35
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:13,832
where we can run into
some people I worked with.

36
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:25,443
All they care about
is that they're see-through.

37
00:02:25,511 --> 00:02:28,479
Why is transparency
desirable in pantyhose?

38
00:02:28,547 --> 00:02:30,582
I can see fine.

39
00:02:30,649 --> 00:02:32,417
You want to get
in here with me?

40
00:02:32,484 --> 00:02:35,285
- Hello, Pegasus.
- Hey, you.

41
00:02:35,353 --> 00:02:37,354
- You have to let me announce you.
- Go ahead.

42
00:02:37,422 --> 00:02:39,456
Hello, Stanley, Ginso.

43
00:02:39,524 --> 00:02:42,025
I have amazing photos--

44
00:02:42,093 --> 00:02:46,029
Crime scene snaps from
Chicago's student nurse massacre.

45
00:02:46,097 --> 00:02:48,098
- Not suitable for publication.
- What?

46
00:02:53,002 --> 00:02:56,105
Oh, my God.

47
00:02:56,172 --> 00:02:58,407
I'm telling you,
you're upset over nothing.

48
00:02:58,475 --> 00:03:01,344
- You're making it worse. I'll get over it.
- Megan.

49
00:03:01,411 --> 00:03:03,279
I'm fine.

50
00:03:03,347 --> 00:03:05,180
You should be.

51
00:03:09,619 --> 00:03:12,454
- They look like rag dolls.
- Were they raped?

52
00:03:12,521 --> 00:03:14,422
They don't know, but a
couple of these are naked.

53
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:16,591
- It went on for hours.
- Ugh.

54
00:03:16,659 --> 00:03:19,461
- The rest just waited.
- They were tied up.

55
00:03:19,528 --> 00:03:21,662
I'm sorry I'm late.

56
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:24,097
Megan. I've got
some pictures.

57
00:03:24,165 --> 00:03:26,700
Ginsberg, you got to see these.

58
00:03:26,768 --> 00:03:29,202
I'll see you later.

59
00:03:29,271 --> 00:03:32,072
And I'll see you later.

60
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,974
The sex murders in Chicago.

61
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:35,976
- The student nurses.
- Really?

62
00:03:36,043 --> 00:03:37,810
Take it.

63
00:03:41,915 --> 00:03:44,717
- Oh, my God.
- Look at the bottom row.

64
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,656
I think this is going to make
the cover, not the riots.

65
00:03:49,723 --> 00:03:51,424
- Really?
- Yeah, we did the riots this week.

66
00:03:51,492 --> 00:03:53,058
Watts a year later.

67
00:03:53,126 --> 00:03:54,926
Plus, there have been
five riots this summer.

68
00:03:54,994 --> 00:03:56,861
I say it's better
than even money

69
00:03:56,929 --> 00:03:58,697
Mr. Luce finds a
tasteful way to do this.

70
00:03:58,765 --> 00:04:00,399
You know what-- Put it away.
It's disgusting.

71
00:04:00,466 --> 00:04:02,167
It's one of those things
I wish I didn't see.

72
00:04:02,234 --> 00:04:04,770
- And why are you laughing?
- We're not laughing.

73
00:04:04,837 --> 00:04:06,772
No, you're excited by it.

74
00:04:06,839 --> 00:04:08,674
Some girl trussed up
like a cut of meat?

75
00:04:08,741 --> 00:04:11,309
Eight girls, but nine
were kidnapped.

76
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,711
One survived.

77
00:04:13,779 --> 00:04:16,547
I only am escaped alone
to tell thee.

78
00:04:16,615 --> 00:04:18,549
How did she do that?

79
00:04:18,617 --> 00:04:22,320
She hid under the bed.
He lost count.

80
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,622
You know what?

81
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:26,289
You're sickos.

82
00:04:26,357 --> 00:04:28,024
Michael.

83
00:04:31,228 --> 00:04:33,763
He's right.

84
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,570
It's been 25 minutes.
It's not even set.

85
00:04:41,638 --> 00:04:43,305
I told you the jets
are clogged.

86
00:04:43,373 --> 00:04:44,940
Give me some money.
I'll go to the bakery.

87
00:04:45,007 --> 00:04:46,675
And we need to get beer.

88
00:04:46,743 --> 00:04:48,744
Greg likes Schaefer.
Do we have time?

89
00:04:48,812 --> 00:04:51,613
Not if you want me to get
the baby out of here by noon.

90
00:04:51,681 --> 00:04:54,182
Why? He's going to want
to see Kevin more than me.

91
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,851
That's what he's going to say,

92
00:04:55,918 --> 00:04:57,618
but he's going to
want you right away.

93
00:04:57,686 --> 00:04:59,253
Let me go get my purse.

94
00:04:59,321 --> 00:05:00,988
You're making me
very anxious right now.

95
00:05:01,056 --> 00:05:03,758
It's okay to be anxious.
It's normal.

96
00:05:03,826 --> 00:05:06,894
Everything's going to be
unfamiliar for both of you.

97
00:05:06,962 --> 00:05:09,731
And who knows what he's seen?
Who knows what he's done?

98
00:05:09,798 --> 00:05:11,932
He's a surgeon.
He wasn't in combat.

99
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,033
He saw the same things
there he saw here.

100
00:05:14,101 --> 00:05:16,570
Well, there are other things
that happen when men are away,

101
00:05:16,637 --> 00:05:18,071
- especially at war.
- Stop it.

102
00:05:18,138 --> 00:05:20,841
Stop talking
about men in general

103
00:05:20,908 --> 00:05:22,409
when I know
it's all about daddy.

104
00:05:22,477 --> 00:05:24,411
Even if there haven't
been other women,

105
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,146
he's not used to
listening to a woman.

106
00:05:27,214 --> 00:05:29,282
It's just the idea
of coming home

107
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:31,149
and finding a little
hole in his life

108
00:05:31,217 --> 00:05:33,018
and sticking his elbow through

109
00:05:33,086 --> 00:05:35,087
until he can walk
all the way in.

110
00:05:35,154 --> 00:05:38,123
I know.

111
00:05:38,191 --> 00:05:39,992
And that's why I want
to start with him

112
00:05:40,059 --> 00:05:42,194
seeing his son
for the first time.

113
00:05:42,262 --> 00:05:44,597
He'll know how to do that.

114
00:05:44,664 --> 00:05:46,964
You're right.

115
00:05:47,032 --> 00:05:48,800
Do you really want a cake?

116
00:05:48,868 --> 00:05:50,869
Because it's going to take
me a while to get dressed.

117
00:05:50,936 --> 00:05:52,771
Could you?

118
00:05:56,108 --> 00:05:58,276
<i>Your daughter's on line one.</i>

119
00:05:58,343 --> 00:06:01,012
Hello, sweetheart.
What's the matter?

120
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:04,014
Grandma Pauline is still here
and I hate her.

121
00:06:04,081 --> 00:06:05,982
Stay out of her way.

122
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:07,851
Your mother will be back
Friday morning.

123
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,020
It is Friday morning.

124
00:06:10,087 --> 00:06:12,322
Someone called on Henry's phone

125
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:14,458
and said that they couldn't
get an airplane flight,

126
00:06:14,526 --> 00:06:17,193
so someone's driving them back
from Buffalo tonight.

127
00:06:17,261 --> 00:06:19,529
You'd think Henry
could get a flight.

128
00:06:19,596 --> 00:06:22,198
I know.
He's so important.

129
00:06:22,266 --> 00:06:25,468
<i>They call Bobby all the time</i>
<i>in sleepaway camp.</i>

130
00:06:25,536 --> 00:06:28,405
I guess if I was peeing
in my pants, they might want to say hi.

131
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:30,173
That's not nice.

132
00:06:30,241 --> 00:06:32,909
<i>Grandma Pauline</i>
<i>wears so much perfume.</i>

133
00:06:32,977 --> 00:06:35,077
<i>Every time she comes near
me, I want to barf.</i>

134
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:37,179
And you know what else?

135
00:06:37,247 --> 00:06:39,415
She doesn't believe me,
that I'm allowed

136
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:42,517
to watch as much TV as I want
because it's the summer.

137
00:06:42,585 --> 00:06:44,420
Your mother lets you do that?

138
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,455
I'm on vacation.

139
00:06:46,522 --> 00:06:49,325
I think the best thing
is for you to go out

140
00:06:49,392 --> 00:06:51,492
in the fresh air
and get some sun.

141
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,661
I did.
It's really hot.

142
00:06:53,728 --> 00:06:55,796
Stop complaining.

143
00:06:55,864 --> 00:06:58,266
I don't want you to get rickets
in that haunted mansion.

144
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:00,601
I'll see you next weekend.

145
00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:02,937
How are you?

146
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:06,974
I have a cold, but you've
made me feel better.

147
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:08,475
Can't you come get me?

148
00:07:08,542 --> 00:07:10,944
No. And don't ask again.

149
00:07:11,012 --> 00:07:13,146
- <i>Okay, bye.</i>
- Bye.

150
00:07:16,584 --> 00:07:20,153
- Are you sick?
- I'm great. Let's go.

151
00:07:20,221 --> 00:07:22,455
So it starts with Ken Cosgrove

152
00:07:22,522 --> 00:07:24,523
climbing out of the muck
and walking on dry land.

153
00:07:24,591 --> 00:07:26,725
He says a bunch of nice stuff
about Ginsberg and you.

154
00:07:26,793 --> 00:07:29,795
I told him not to use the word
genius about either of us.

155
00:07:29,863 --> 00:07:32,831
Ahem, a woman
and her secrets--

156
00:07:32,899 --> 00:07:34,633
Oh, the things
she'll never tell,

157
00:07:34,701 --> 00:07:36,369
like how long
it took her to get ready

158
00:07:36,436 --> 00:07:38,103
or the reason she's smiling.

159
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:39,804
A good-looking woman
at a party.

160
00:07:39,872 --> 00:07:42,240
And where she got
the incredible shoes.

161
00:07:42,308 --> 00:07:43,741
Another woman, not too catty,

162
00:07:43,809 --> 00:07:46,311
says, "I love your shoes.
Where did you get them?"

163
00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:49,347
We hold on five seconds of her showing
off the shoe from the calf down,

164
00:07:49,415 --> 00:07:50,982
and this girl's legs
will be spectacular.

165
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:53,184
And, yes, you can
come to casting.

166
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:02,259
That's plenty.

167
00:08:02,327 --> 00:08:04,761
Are you kidding?
I'm ready to take off here.

168
00:08:04,829 --> 00:08:07,631
I just wanted to hear the tone
of your voice so I can make sure

169
00:08:07,698 --> 00:08:09,833
it's not as annoying
as it is in everyday life.

170
00:08:09,901 --> 00:08:11,234
It's called a regional accent.

171
00:08:11,301 --> 00:08:12,935
And believe it or not,
you've got one, too.

172
00:08:13,003 --> 00:08:14,470
We can't all sound
like Walter Cronkite.

173
00:08:14,538 --> 00:08:16,072
Do you like this?

174
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,007
I never saw boards
for the Cinderella thing.

175
00:08:18,075 --> 00:08:19,509
Well, you killed it,
and for good reason.

176
00:08:19,576 --> 00:08:21,010
Cinderella and shoes
is a cliche.

177
00:08:21,078 --> 00:08:22,978
- You could have TB.
- Sleeping beauty?

178
00:08:23,047 --> 00:08:24,613
Snow white?
Nothing worked?

179
00:08:24,681 --> 00:08:27,416
They're more about
necrophilia than shoes.

180
00:08:27,483 --> 00:08:29,884
It's footwear.
Don't make that mistake.

181
00:08:51,473 --> 00:08:55,076
- Oh, my God, you're so skinny.
- So are you.

182
00:08:55,143 --> 00:08:57,511
<i>Somebody wants to say hello.</i>

183
00:08:59,246 --> 00:09:00,613
Jesus, is that him?

184
00:09:05,619 --> 00:09:08,020
Holy crap, look at him.

185
00:09:10,023 --> 00:09:11,357
Joanie, I'll get that.

186
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,394
You have your hands full.

187
00:09:15,462 --> 00:09:18,163
We thought your flight might
be late because of the strike.

188
00:09:18,231 --> 00:09:21,066
Yeah, we picked up
some folks in Honolulu

189
00:09:21,134 --> 00:09:23,302
who had been stranded,
but everything was fine.

190
00:09:27,773 --> 00:09:30,041
Gail, go get the brownie.

191
00:09:30,109 --> 00:09:32,143
I don't think we have any film.

192
00:09:32,211 --> 00:09:34,178
You know what?

193
00:09:34,246 --> 00:09:36,581
I'll take Kevin
and go get some,

194
00:09:36,648 --> 00:09:38,849
so you two can visit a spell.

195
00:09:38,917 --> 00:09:42,320
Okay, that's a good idea.

196
00:09:42,387 --> 00:09:45,156
You have supplies in case you
have to be gone for a while?

197
00:09:45,224 --> 00:09:47,390
I have everything.

198
00:09:50,027 --> 00:09:52,562
And so do you, Greg.

199
00:10:03,006 --> 00:10:04,540
Get over here.

200
00:10:16,319 --> 00:10:18,886
Where have you been?

201
00:10:18,954 --> 00:10:21,189
Out in the wilderness, baby.

202
00:10:32,934 --> 00:10:35,870
- What are you doing?
- Looking for aspirin.

203
00:10:35,937 --> 00:10:38,639
- Why don't you have Dawn do it?
- I'm embarrassed.

204
00:10:38,707 --> 00:10:41,809
I've eaten up a bottle
since she's been here.

205
00:10:41,877 --> 00:10:43,710
My husband's an aspirin addict.

206
00:10:43,778 --> 00:10:46,212
I'm so ashamed.

207
00:10:50,284 --> 00:10:53,553
You're very warm.
I'm sending you home.

208
00:10:57,558 --> 00:10:59,092
I'm sorry about this morning.

209
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,593
It couldn't be avoided.

210
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:10,302
It was a long time ago
and I was unhappy.

211
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:13,772
Because you were married.

212
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,441
It's fine.
It's just embarrassing.

213
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:19,643
Why should you be embarrassed?

214
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:22,613
Seriously?

215
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:24,749
Because you're
married to me now.

216
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:28,152
And after Allison
and Faye Miller

217
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,287
and who knows how many more...

218
00:11:30,355 --> 00:11:32,222
I was divorced.

219
00:11:32,289 --> 00:11:34,791
And now you're not.

220
00:11:34,859 --> 00:11:39,262
And that kind
of careless appetite--

221
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:41,932
You can't blame that on Betty.

222
00:11:41,999 --> 00:11:43,767
I tell you, let it go.

223
00:11:43,835 --> 00:11:46,069
- You brought it up.
- No, I didn't.

224
00:11:46,137 --> 00:11:48,503
You did.

225
00:11:48,571 --> 00:11:50,606
And all I can think
is you feel guilty,

226
00:11:50,673 --> 00:11:53,508
which makes it worse
than I thought.

227
00:11:55,311 --> 00:11:57,913
I married you.

228
00:11:57,981 --> 00:12:00,082
And I'm going to be
with you until I die...

229
00:12:01,885 --> 00:12:03,985
Which could be this afternoon.

230
00:12:04,053 --> 00:12:07,722
Is this really how you want to
end my last hours on earth?

231
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,791
Sweetie, go home.

232
00:12:09,859 --> 00:12:12,861
I have to go to this meeting
so I can skip the next two.

233
00:12:16,098 --> 00:12:18,266
At least go lie down.

234
00:12:33,314 --> 00:12:34,748
Eat your sandwich.

235
00:12:34,816 --> 00:12:37,250
I'm not hungry.

236
00:12:37,317 --> 00:12:40,186
Oh, my lord.

237
00:12:40,254 --> 00:12:43,256
- Those poor souls.
- What?

238
00:12:43,323 --> 00:12:45,357
Nothing.

239
00:12:46,794 --> 00:12:48,027
Ow!

240
00:12:48,095 --> 00:12:50,830
Some things are not
for children.

241
00:12:50,898 --> 00:12:53,731
Mommy lets me watch the news.

242
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,168
You demanded tuna salad,

243
00:12:56,235 --> 00:12:58,536
so you're going to sit
there until you eat it.

244
00:12:58,604 --> 00:13:00,138
It has relish in it.

245
00:13:00,206 --> 00:13:02,174
You haven't even tasted it.

246
00:13:04,376 --> 00:13:06,211
You hurt my hand.

247
00:13:07,613 --> 00:13:09,513
Well, I shouldn't
have done that.

248
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,382
I'm sorry.
But you have to be respectful.

249
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:14,384
I know your mother
has other rules.

250
00:13:14,452 --> 00:13:18,588
- She doesn't have rules.
- I don't believe that,

251
00:13:18,656 --> 00:13:20,891
but I believe that
she may be distracted.

252
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,993
And I am sure she would be sick

253
00:13:23,061 --> 00:13:25,661
if she knew how
you were behaving.

254
00:13:25,729 --> 00:13:28,798
Now you're going to finish
that sandwich, crusts and all.

255
00:13:28,866 --> 00:13:30,700
I don't care
if it takes all day.

256
00:13:42,712 --> 00:13:44,213
How'd you sleep?

257
00:13:45,614 --> 00:13:47,649
Very well, thank you.

258
00:13:47,717 --> 00:13:49,251
What are you doing?

259
00:13:49,319 --> 00:13:51,386
He's making lunch.
He won't listen.

260
00:13:51,454 --> 00:13:54,789
Greg, honey, I have steak.
Mom bought a cake.

261
00:13:54,858 --> 00:13:56,790
Believe it or not,
I had steak in Vietnam.

262
00:13:56,859 --> 00:13:58,559
I did not have bologna.

263
00:13:58,626 --> 00:14:02,096
And I'll have veal
tonight with my folks.

264
00:14:02,164 --> 00:14:05,499
What are the three
of you up to?

265
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:08,269
I'm showing Kevin how good
I am with my hands.

266
00:14:08,337 --> 00:14:10,304
We were talking
about the riots.

267
00:14:10,372 --> 00:14:13,840
Plenty of negroes in Saigon
and they're plenty brave.

268
00:14:13,908 --> 00:14:15,976
I think we should have a rule

269
00:14:16,043 --> 00:14:17,477
that you have to wear
your uniform

270
00:14:17,544 --> 00:14:18,945
all the time when you're home.

271
00:14:20,781 --> 00:14:23,183
Gail, is there a chance
you could pick up more beer?

272
00:14:23,251 --> 00:14:25,018
Of course.

273
00:14:25,086 --> 00:14:27,887
I wanted to get
the afternoon paper anyway.

274
00:14:35,461 --> 00:14:36,996
Thank you so much, mom.

275
00:14:39,232 --> 00:14:41,233
We'll be back
in time for dinner.

276
00:14:47,606 --> 00:14:49,774
You look incredible, you know?

277
00:14:49,841 --> 00:14:53,244
Thank you.

278
00:14:53,312 --> 00:14:55,313
I need to tell you something.

279
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:00,183
Greg, if something
happened over there

280
00:15:00,251 --> 00:15:02,252
and you feel the need
to tell me, you shouldn't.

281
00:15:04,822 --> 00:15:07,857
And if you do, you certainly
shouldn't ask me to hold your hand.

282
00:15:07,926 --> 00:15:10,060
What? No.

283
00:15:10,128 --> 00:15:11,828
No, it's not that.

284
00:15:14,232 --> 00:15:17,566
Listen, Joanie, there's
been a change of plans.

285
00:15:17,634 --> 00:15:19,235
I have to go back.

286
00:15:19,303 --> 00:15:21,270
I know, for another 40 days.

287
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:24,106
No, for a year.

288
00:15:24,107 --> 00:15:24,140
What?

289
00:15:24,174 --> 00:15:25,474
No, for a year.

290
00:15:25,742 --> 00:15:27,676
It was one year here
and one year there.

291
00:15:27,744 --> 00:15:29,312
That's what they told you.

292
00:15:29,379 --> 00:15:30,846
Look, I know you're hearing
a lot of horrible things

293
00:15:30,914 --> 00:15:32,247
about what's going on
over there.

294
00:15:32,315 --> 00:15:33,915
It couldn't be further
from the truth.

295
00:15:33,983 --> 00:15:36,484
- You don't need to worry.
- You did your part.

296
00:15:36,552 --> 00:15:37,919
They're a bunch of liars.

297
00:15:37,987 --> 00:15:40,188
Nobody lied to anybody.

298
00:15:40,256 --> 00:15:43,258
It's more complicated.
It's war.

299
00:15:43,326 --> 00:15:45,526
It doesn't stop for our plans.

300
00:15:45,594 --> 00:15:47,829
And I've come
to terms with that.

301
00:15:47,896 --> 00:15:49,463
Now we have 10 days together.

302
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:51,498
Let's not waste it.

303
00:15:53,435 --> 00:15:56,870
I need to store up
as much of you as possible.

304
00:16:01,266 --> 00:16:04,534
And yes, you can
come to casting.

305
00:16:04,602 --> 00:16:05,803
<i>And you think it sounds good,</i>

306
00:16:05,871 --> 00:16:07,604
wait till you see it in print.

307
00:16:10,641 --> 00:16:14,410
"You'll never tell.
They'll never be able to."

308
00:16:16,213 --> 00:16:18,114
I don't know.
What do you think, Mr. Butler?

309
00:16:18,182 --> 00:16:20,483
I think Ken was right--
You're a genius.

310
00:16:24,454 --> 00:16:26,021
Square-on strategy.

311
00:16:26,089 --> 00:16:27,656
I think the boys
did a good job.

312
00:16:27,723 --> 00:16:30,025
The girl should be
European-looking.

313
00:16:30,093 --> 00:16:31,994
Maybe get a French girl.

314
00:16:32,061 --> 00:16:33,695
Great.

315
00:16:33,763 --> 00:16:35,297
So?

316
00:16:36,599 --> 00:16:38,066
Sold.

317
00:16:42,871 --> 00:16:45,973
I have to tell you, young
man, you really know women.

318
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:47,942
I've never heard that before.

319
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:50,812
This really gets
inside their heads.

320
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:52,479
Well, to tell you the truth,

321
00:16:52,547 --> 00:16:54,115
they confuse me.

322
00:16:54,183 --> 00:16:56,450
I mean, I keep thinking
about Cinderella.

323
00:16:56,518 --> 00:16:58,618
We were going to come in here
and talk about Cinderella,

324
00:16:58,686 --> 00:17:00,287
<i>but it's too dark.</i>

325
00:17:00,354 --> 00:17:01,955
Really?

326
00:17:02,023 --> 00:17:03,556
We were kind of hoping for it.

327
00:17:03,624 --> 00:17:06,158
Nah, I don't think so.

328
00:17:06,226 --> 00:17:08,328
I mean, she's running down
this dark side street.

329
00:17:08,395 --> 00:17:09,895
And it's outside a castle,

330
00:17:09,963 --> 00:17:12,799
so it's got those walls
and the cobblestones.

331
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:14,634
And she's running,
but she's only got

332
00:17:14,702 --> 00:17:16,936
this one incredible shoe
for her incredible gown,

333
00:17:17,003 --> 00:17:20,272
so she's hobbling,
wounded prey.

334
00:17:20,341 --> 00:17:22,073
She can hear him behind her,

335
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:24,976
<i>his measured footsteps</i>
<i>catching up.</i>

336
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:29,748
She turns a corner.
Those big shadows.

337
00:17:29,816 --> 00:17:32,116
And she's scared.

338
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:34,052
And then she feels
a hand on her shoulder

339
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:36,254
and she turns around.

340
00:17:36,322 --> 00:17:39,056
And it doesn't matter
what he looks like.

341
00:17:39,123 --> 00:17:43,961
He's handsome, at that moment
offering her her shoe.

342
00:17:44,028 --> 00:17:45,863
<i>She takes it.</i>

343
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:50,167
She knows she's not safe,
but she doesn't care.

344
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,536
I guess we know in the end

345
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:55,405
she wants to be caught.

346
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,074
See? It's too dark.

347
00:18:01,178 --> 00:18:03,747
Why don't we do that?

348
00:18:03,814 --> 00:18:05,548
The man said sold.

349
00:18:05,616 --> 00:18:07,183
You wanted Cinderella anyway.

350
00:18:07,251 --> 00:18:09,318
- You forgot that.
- No, I said it was a cliche.

351
00:18:09,386 --> 00:18:10,886
That's because you thought
they wouldn't like it,

352
00:18:10,953 --> 00:18:12,755
but in your heart
you knew it was good.

353
00:18:12,822 --> 00:18:15,290
In my heart I'm on the verge of
throwing you in front of a cab.

354
00:18:15,358 --> 00:18:17,158
Okay.

355
00:18:17,226 --> 00:18:19,561
So however proud of yourself
you're feeling right now,

356
00:18:19,629 --> 00:18:23,131
just know that everything I'm
saying has "or else" after it.

357
00:18:23,199 --> 00:18:25,367
Don't do that again.

358
00:18:25,435 --> 00:18:27,903
Think of those ideas
in front of me.

359
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:30,372
Don't do that again.

360
00:18:30,439 --> 00:18:32,440
I gotta make a call.

361
00:18:35,444 --> 00:18:37,245
He's such a decent guy.

362
00:18:38,714 --> 00:18:40,548
You know you almost
got fired just now.

363
00:18:40,616 --> 00:18:42,216
I don't think
you're right about that.

364
00:18:42,284 --> 00:18:44,751
I'm positive.

365
00:18:44,819 --> 00:18:48,022
<i>Mr. Draper is on line one.</i>

366
00:18:48,089 --> 00:18:50,291
Hello. How'd it go?

367
00:18:50,358 --> 00:18:52,492
Good.
What are you up to?

368
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,795
I'm keeping your chair warm.

369
00:18:54,862 --> 00:18:57,231
So I'll swing by
and get you in an hour?

370
00:18:57,299 --> 00:18:58,764
Well, why don't
you just go home,

371
00:18:58,832 --> 00:19:00,366
climb into bed?

372
00:19:00,434 --> 00:19:03,303
- Really?
- <i>Yes.</i>

373
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:05,204
I only need another
couple of hours.

374
00:19:05,272 --> 00:19:06,739
And, Don,

375
00:19:06,807 --> 00:19:08,707
<i>no smoking.</i>

376
00:19:40,738 --> 00:19:43,074
Mohawk says that LBJ is scared

377
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:44,976
of forcing the mechanics
to arbitration

378
00:19:45,043 --> 00:19:46,576
because he has
midterm elections

379
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:48,711
and he's worried about
losing the labor vote.

380
00:19:48,779 --> 00:19:51,714
- That's good news.
- Yes, it is.

381
00:19:51,782 --> 00:19:54,150
The strike's going to go on for
at least a couple more weeks

382
00:19:54,218 --> 00:19:56,319
and Mohawk can sop up
all the extra routes.

383
00:19:56,387 --> 00:19:58,989
So they want us to walk
them through the campaign

384
00:19:59,056 --> 00:20:00,690
first thing Monday morning.

385
00:20:00,757 --> 00:20:03,758
- A phone call will do.
- The campaign, of course.

386
00:20:03,826 --> 00:20:05,527
We're ready to go.

387
00:20:07,397 --> 00:20:09,264
Have a good weekend.

388
00:20:12,635 --> 00:20:15,104
Damn it.

389
00:20:19,574 --> 00:20:21,942
Good night everyone, Clara.

390
00:20:22,011 --> 00:20:23,711
<i>Good night,</i>
<i>Mr. Campbell.</i>

391
00:20:27,649 --> 00:20:29,650
Where's Ginsberg?

392
00:20:29,718 --> 00:20:32,753
He's probably everywhere after
Don scattered his ashes.

393
00:20:32,821 --> 00:20:36,056
Apparently he went haywire
in the presentation downstairs.

394
00:20:36,124 --> 00:20:37,491
I don't care.
Call him.

395
00:20:37,558 --> 00:20:39,159
I just did.
He's not home.

396
00:20:39,227 --> 00:20:41,495
- Is he coming back?
- You know what?

397
00:20:41,562 --> 00:20:43,963
I'm going to go
out there and find him.

398
00:20:44,032 --> 00:20:45,732
I'm going to start
the whole world

399
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:48,402
and then I'm going to
eventually check my apartment.

400
00:20:54,141 --> 00:20:55,674
What are you doing tonight?

401
00:20:55,742 --> 00:20:57,976
I don't know.
What did you have in mind?

402
00:20:58,045 --> 00:21:00,046
Are you drunk?
Get your feet off that desk.

403
00:21:02,449 --> 00:21:04,050
I need you to work up
something for Mohawk.

404
00:21:04,117 --> 00:21:05,518
Oh, I'm sorry.

405
00:21:05,585 --> 00:21:09,187
For Mohawk, your, quote,
"man" is Ginsberg.

406
00:21:09,255 --> 00:21:12,257
Let's say you were
to do this for me

407
00:21:12,324 --> 00:21:14,926
and on Monday you explain
to Ginsberg and Campbell

408
00:21:14,993 --> 00:21:16,494
that I asked you to...

409
00:21:16,562 --> 00:21:19,664
Only I asked you
sometime last week.

410
00:21:22,034 --> 00:21:24,368
Do you have a brief?

411
00:21:24,436 --> 00:21:27,871
- Did Ginsberg have a brief?
- I never told Ginsberg, okay?

412
00:21:27,939 --> 00:21:30,640
You have to remember that.

413
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:32,876
- You know about the airline strike, right?
- Yes.

414
00:21:32,944 --> 00:21:34,744
Why is Mohawk still flying?

415
00:21:34,812 --> 00:21:36,880
Because even though all the
other mechanics are on strike--

416
00:21:36,948 --> 00:21:38,647
Boo-hoo, they need more
wrenches or something--

417
00:21:38,715 --> 00:21:40,083
Mohawk's mechanics
have a side deal,

418
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:41,317
so they have to keep working.

419
00:21:41,385 --> 00:21:43,119
They must love that.

420
00:21:43,187 --> 00:21:44,687
Yeah, well, they're going
to love the overtime.

421
00:21:44,754 --> 00:21:46,289
American airlines
is taking everything big

422
00:21:46,356 --> 00:21:48,424
and giving their northeast
corridor to Mohawk.

423
00:21:48,492 --> 00:21:50,293
So what do you want?

424
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,860
How about something like

425
00:21:51,928 --> 00:21:54,930
"Mohawk, breaking the strike
one flight at a time"?

426
00:21:54,998 --> 00:21:58,567
Or maybe "Fly over
the picket line with Mohawk"?

427
00:21:58,635 --> 00:22:00,669
Hey, Trotsky,
you're in advertising.

428
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:03,772
Fine. So what's
the angle?

429
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,275
Campbell or I had this idea that
it would be something about,

430
00:22:07,343 --> 00:22:09,578
you know, how times are tough

431
00:22:09,646 --> 00:22:12,580
and you can't get anywhere.

432
00:22:12,648 --> 00:22:14,816
So thank God Mohawk is
offering emergency service.

433
00:22:14,883 --> 00:22:16,884
You don't want to use the word
emergency with an airplane.

434
00:22:16,952 --> 00:22:19,153
I don't want to do any of this.
I'll see you Monday.

435
00:22:19,221 --> 00:22:21,155
Hold on a second.

436
00:22:21,223 --> 00:22:24,592
You want me to work up an entire
corporate image campaign for $10?

437
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,793
I can make you do it for nothing.
I'm the boss.

438
00:22:26,894 --> 00:22:28,729
You're right

439
00:22:28,796 --> 00:22:31,732
the work is $10,
the lie is extra.

440
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:33,100
Incredible.

441
00:22:33,167 --> 00:22:34,768
What do you make
a week, sweetheart?

442
00:22:34,802 --> 00:22:37,704
Mm, you don't know, uh?
That's helpful.

443
00:22:37,772 --> 00:22:39,606
You know, I could fire you.

444
00:22:39,674 --> 00:22:43,009
Great, there are some
portfolios in Joan's office.

445
00:22:43,076 --> 00:22:44,644
Maybe you could find
somebody tonight.

446
00:22:44,711 --> 00:22:46,478
Why are you doing this to me?

447
00:22:46,546 --> 00:22:48,413
Because you're being
very demanding

448
00:22:48,448 --> 00:22:50,750
for someone who has
no other choice.

449
00:22:50,817 --> 00:22:52,885
Dazzle me.

450
00:22:52,986 --> 00:22:54,787
Fine.

451
00:22:54,821 --> 00:22:56,421
How much you want?

452
00:22:56,456 --> 00:22:57,790
How much you got?

453
00:23:04,296 --> 00:23:06,031
- $400.
- Give me all of it.

454
00:23:06,098 --> 00:23:09,000
Jesus!

455
00:23:09,068 --> 00:23:11,169
It better be good.

456
00:23:11,236 --> 00:23:13,171
You want me to take your watch?

457
00:23:17,108 --> 00:23:18,976
I'm on my way out.
Are you staying?

458
00:23:19,044 --> 00:23:21,211
Hello.
Good night.

459
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:23,313
Yeah. Something came up.

460
00:23:23,381 --> 00:23:24,915
Would you tell Patricia
she can go home?

461
00:23:24,983 --> 00:23:26,784
Okay.

462
00:23:48,327 --> 00:23:51,295
Get in here.

463
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:54,131
- What are you doing here?
- We didn't get to talk.

464
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:56,534
We've done all the talking
we're ever going to do.

465
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:58,935
Are you okay?

466
00:23:59,002 --> 00:24:01,037
How the hell
did you get in here?

467
00:24:01,105 --> 00:24:04,574
- I have a way with doormen.
- I have some bad news for you.

468
00:24:04,642 --> 00:24:07,043
You can either take the steps
or you can go off the balcony

469
00:24:07,111 --> 00:24:08,878
because if you run into my
wife on the way out of here,

470
00:24:08,946 --> 00:24:10,347
you're going to wish you had.

471
00:24:10,414 --> 00:24:12,782
Ooh, forceful.

472
00:24:14,083 --> 00:24:15,751
My, oh, my.

473
00:24:17,287 --> 00:24:18,920
Everybody probably thinks
that she did this,

474
00:24:18,988 --> 00:24:21,823
but I know it was you.

475
00:24:21,891 --> 00:24:24,059
You really should go.
I gotta lie down.

476
00:24:26,062 --> 00:24:28,764
I'll take the steps.

477
00:24:28,831 --> 00:24:31,132
You know what--
Take the service elevator.

478
00:24:36,705 --> 00:24:38,339
Goodbye.
I'm sorry.

479
00:24:38,407 --> 00:24:41,342
- You've gotta understand.
- Are you okay?

480
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:43,578
Please, you have to go.

481
00:24:43,646 --> 00:24:46,513
It was just sex.
It doesn't mean anything.

482
00:24:46,581 --> 00:24:48,948
I'm sorry.
I've gotta lie down.

483
00:25:12,606 --> 00:25:14,807
The girl under
the bed-- Oh!

484
00:25:14,874 --> 00:25:17,276
I'd be surprised if she
could ever talk again.

485
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,548
<i>That poor thing--</i>
<i>Paralyzed with fear</i>

486
00:25:23,616 --> 00:25:26,884
while he opened
that door eight times

487
00:25:26,952 --> 00:25:29,020
and dragged another one out?

488
00:25:29,087 --> 00:25:30,655
And that...

489
00:25:33,825 --> 00:25:36,293
No, as much as I'd love to
go, I can't make any plans

490
00:25:36,361 --> 00:25:38,729
until they waltz
through that door.

491
00:25:38,797 --> 00:25:40,130
Mm.

492
00:25:43,968 --> 00:25:46,236
You need to take out the trash.

493
00:25:46,304 --> 00:25:47,771
Right now?

494
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:54,677
Take out the trash or you
can go to bed right now,

495
00:25:54,745 --> 00:25:57,647
watch the sun set
from your bedroom window.

496
00:25:57,715 --> 00:26:00,049
It's the saddest thing
in the world.

497
00:26:00,116 --> 00:26:03,152
If I take out the trash, will
you tell me about the murder?

498
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:06,488
No. I will not
bargain with you.

499
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:09,558
How old are you?

500
00:26:09,625 --> 00:26:13,261
That's something we girls
keep to ourselves.

501
00:26:13,329 --> 00:26:15,664
Was your mom strict?

502
00:26:15,732 --> 00:26:19,000
No, but my father was and
I'm a better person for it.

503
00:26:19,068 --> 00:26:23,136
I know you don't think so,
but I'm a good person.

504
00:26:23,204 --> 00:26:26,340
Sally, I just think someone in
your world needs to discipline you

505
00:26:26,408 --> 00:26:28,743
so you can start
acting like an adult.

506
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:30,911
My fath-- My father.

507
00:26:30,979 --> 00:26:33,881
I remember one time he was
sleeping on the couch

508
00:26:33,948 --> 00:26:36,149
in the living room
and I walked by.

509
00:26:36,217 --> 00:26:38,217
And all of a sudden,
out of nowhere,

510
00:26:38,285 --> 00:26:42,021
he kicked me so hard that I
actually flew across the room

511
00:26:42,089 --> 00:26:44,624
and hit a piece of furniture.

512
00:26:44,692 --> 00:26:46,526
And then he looked
at me and he said,

513
00:26:46,594 --> 00:26:48,495
"That's for nothing,
so look out."

514
00:26:48,562 --> 00:26:50,963
That's not very nice.

515
00:26:51,031 --> 00:26:55,701
No, but it was valuable advice.

516
00:27:01,441 --> 00:27:04,777
When in doubt, go with the
most expensive, right, pops?

517
00:27:04,844 --> 00:27:07,345
I don't want any wine.

518
00:27:07,414 --> 00:27:10,080
Okay, can we all
cheer up, please?

519
00:27:10,148 --> 00:27:13,317
We're together,
I have a new baby boy,

520
00:27:13,385 --> 00:27:15,420
not to mention this place
costs a fortune.

521
00:27:15,487 --> 00:27:18,589
So how are we starting?
The lovely señora?

522
00:27:18,657 --> 00:27:21,225
- I'll have a gin fizz.
- Everybody else is having wine,

523
00:27:21,293 --> 00:27:22,794
but you have to
give me a second.

524
00:27:26,631 --> 00:27:28,932
- How are you doing?
- Can't complain.

525
00:27:28,999 --> 00:27:30,500
Enjoy yourself.

526
00:27:30,568 --> 00:27:32,803
Thank you.
You, too, sir.

527
00:27:35,372 --> 00:27:37,574
First Armored Division.
Fort Hood.

528
00:27:37,642 --> 00:27:39,175
Do you want me to come back?

529
00:27:39,243 --> 00:27:41,677
No, but you can
recommend something.

530
00:27:41,745 --> 00:27:44,680
- Are you in a rush?
- No, it's just that I got a bunch of tables.

531
00:27:44,748 --> 00:27:47,850
Well, I'm sorry if that little display
of respect is slowing you down,

532
00:27:47,918 --> 00:27:49,885
but a lot of kids your age
would be thrilled

533
00:27:49,953 --> 00:27:51,754
to be waiting tables tonight.

534
00:27:53,356 --> 00:27:55,658
I'm sorry, sir.
Of course.

535
00:27:58,894 --> 00:28:00,895
This is a nice one.

536
00:28:00,963 --> 00:28:03,932
Thank you.
That would be perfect.

537
00:28:03,999 --> 00:28:06,668
The scampi looks very good.

538
00:28:06,735 --> 00:28:09,871
I'm sorry, this is
a painful charade.

539
00:28:09,939 --> 00:28:12,206
- Mom, please.
- I just don't understand it.

540
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:14,040
Everyone else
is trying to come home.

541
00:28:14,108 --> 00:28:18,011
Ruth, Greg is facing this
with great bravery

542
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:19,880
and I'm proud of him.

543
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:21,682
He did his time.

544
00:28:21,749 --> 00:28:23,817
You've got to talk him
out of it.

545
00:28:23,885 --> 00:28:26,954
Mom, I don't want your grandson
hearing this argument.

546
00:28:27,021 --> 00:28:28,922
Joe, you were in the service.

547
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:30,623
Can't you write a letter
to your congressman

548
00:28:30,691 --> 00:28:32,358
and tell him he's got a family

549
00:28:32,425 --> 00:28:34,360
why?
Is some congressman

550
00:28:34,427 --> 00:28:36,061
going to talk him
out of going back?

551
00:28:36,129 --> 00:28:37,597
I don't understand.

552
00:28:37,664 --> 00:28:39,431
I'm putting a moratorium
on this conversation.

553
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,333
Now we are either
going to have this dinner

554
00:28:41,401 --> 00:28:43,235
that I've been
dreaming about for months

555
00:28:43,303 --> 00:28:45,070
or we can all go home.

556
00:28:45,138 --> 00:28:47,105
He didn't tell you about it.

557
00:28:47,172 --> 00:28:49,007
Of course not.

558
00:28:49,074 --> 00:28:51,510
What is she talking about?

559
00:28:51,577 --> 00:28:53,277
Did you have a say in this?

560
00:28:53,345 --> 00:28:55,480
You're a father now.

561
00:28:55,548 --> 00:28:58,316
- What?
- Joanie, calm down.

562
00:28:58,384 --> 00:29:00,652
You volunteered?

563
00:29:02,487 --> 00:29:04,722
They need me.

564
00:29:24,341 --> 00:29:27,010
You know, Joanie plays
the accordion.

565
00:29:44,293 --> 00:29:45,928
Hello?

566
00:29:57,906 --> 00:30:00,007
Hello?

567
00:30:16,423 --> 00:30:18,391
Is somebody here?

568
00:30:36,676 --> 00:30:38,110
What are you doing?

569
00:30:38,177 --> 00:30:39,911
I fell asleep.

570
00:30:39,979 --> 00:30:43,215
Well, it's time to go home.

571
00:30:43,282 --> 00:30:45,484
I will, in a bit.

572
00:30:45,551 --> 00:30:47,852
Come on, I don't want
to walk out alone.

573
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,722
I don't know.
I think I'll just stay here.

574
00:30:50,789 --> 00:30:52,491
You can hop in a cab.

575
00:30:52,558 --> 00:30:54,458
I happen to have
a lot of cash for once.

576
00:30:54,526 --> 00:30:56,893
Even if a cab
was going to take me,

577
00:30:56,961 --> 00:30:59,696
they're not going to
take me past 96th Street.

578
00:30:59,764 --> 00:31:01,798
Really?

579
00:31:01,866 --> 00:31:03,634
Well, then, take the subway.

580
00:31:03,701 --> 00:31:05,369
My brother won't let me--

581
00:31:05,437 --> 00:31:07,971
You know, with everything
that's happening in Chicago.

582
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:10,173
Well, you're not a nurse.

583
00:31:12,075 --> 00:31:14,310
Oh, right.

584
00:31:14,378 --> 00:31:16,412
Is there a riot in Harlem?

585
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,549
There was a thing
in Bed-Stuy.

586
00:31:19,617 --> 00:31:22,018
There's a lot of police.

587
00:31:22,085 --> 00:31:25,054
Well, I know that
doesn't make it safer.

588
00:31:25,122 --> 00:31:29,057
My boyfriend's in Chicago.
He's covering the riots.

589
00:31:29,125 --> 00:31:32,060
Is that right?

590
00:31:32,128 --> 00:31:34,296
Why don't you stay
with me tonight?

591
00:31:36,065 --> 00:31:38,733
I've stayed here before.
I'll be fine.

592
00:31:38,801 --> 00:31:41,036
Get your things.

593
00:31:49,532 --> 00:31:52,168
Are you asleep?

594
00:31:52,235 --> 00:31:54,436
Oh, you're home.

595
00:31:57,873 --> 00:31:59,473
You're mumbling.

596
00:32:01,677 --> 00:32:03,511
How the hell
did you get in here?

597
00:32:03,579 --> 00:32:05,413
I was worried about you.

598
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,782
You left the back door
unlocked.

599
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:10,384
- Why can't you leave me alone?
- I can't.

600
00:32:10,452 --> 00:32:12,586
You have to.

601
00:32:12,653 --> 00:32:15,989
We're alone.

602
00:32:16,057 --> 00:32:18,425
I just want it fast.

603
00:32:20,095 --> 00:32:22,062
No.

604
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:25,099
I know she's coming home.

605
00:32:25,166 --> 00:32:28,101
I'll be gone.
I promise.

606
00:32:28,168 --> 00:32:30,569
Andrea.

607
00:32:35,609 --> 00:32:37,944
I can feel you against me.

608
00:32:39,579 --> 00:32:41,480
Remember that night
at Lincoln Center

609
00:32:41,548 --> 00:32:44,315
when you took me back
to the loading dock?

610
00:32:44,383 --> 00:32:46,852
Your wife was waiting inside.

611
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:15,979
So it's just me,
my brother, who's 19,

612
00:33:16,046 --> 00:33:18,414
and my mother,
who says she's 39.

613
00:33:18,482 --> 00:33:21,184
Like Jack Benny.

614
00:33:21,252 --> 00:33:24,120
- Is your brother in school?
- No. He delivers furniture

615
00:33:24,188 --> 00:33:27,456
and argues with my mother
about joining the army.

616
00:33:27,524 --> 00:33:30,426
Mm.

617
00:33:30,494 --> 00:33:34,263
You were saying something in the
taxi about Don and I cut you off.

618
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:36,198
No, I was finished.

619
00:33:37,801 --> 00:33:41,103
You can talk to me.

620
00:33:41,171 --> 00:33:44,372
I was his secretary, you know?

621
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,175
You were?

622
00:33:46,242 --> 00:33:48,610
- So how did you--
- I didn't even ask for it.

623
00:33:48,678 --> 00:33:51,446
Sometimes they drag
the secretaries in

624
00:33:51,514 --> 00:33:53,481
for focus groups to try things

625
00:33:53,549 --> 00:33:56,484
and I was discovered...

626
00:33:56,552 --> 00:33:59,321
Like Esther Blodgett.

627
00:34:02,991 --> 00:34:05,091
Oh, God, I'm really drunk.

628
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:07,994
Y'all drink a lot.

629
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:16,236
So what were you going to say?

630
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:18,038
I was going to say--

631
00:34:18,105 --> 00:34:20,973
Go ahead.
You can talk.

632
00:34:21,041 --> 00:34:22,809
- I'm trying to.
- Oh.

633
00:34:22,876 --> 00:34:24,344
I'm sorry.

634
00:34:24,411 --> 00:34:26,379
I was going to say
I hope you won't

635
00:34:26,447 --> 00:34:28,981
tell Mr. Draper
about me sleeping there.

636
00:34:29,049 --> 00:34:31,050
You two talk sometimes.

637
00:34:32,753 --> 00:34:35,254
Nah.

638
00:34:35,322 --> 00:34:37,356
We have to stick together.

639
00:34:40,493 --> 00:34:43,228
I know we're not really
in the same situation,

640
00:34:43,295 --> 00:34:46,231
but I was the only one
like me there

641
00:34:46,298 --> 00:34:47,766
for a long time.

642
00:34:51,237 --> 00:34:53,838
I know it's hard.

643
00:34:53,905 --> 00:34:56,106
I appreciate that.

644
00:35:04,249 --> 00:35:06,550
Do you want to be a copywriter?

645
00:35:06,618 --> 00:35:09,786
No. I like my job.

646
00:35:10,988 --> 00:35:13,690
Yep.

647
00:35:13,758 --> 00:35:16,158
You're right.

648
00:35:16,226 --> 00:35:19,863
Copywriter's tough,

649
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:21,931
especially for a woman.

650
00:35:26,002 --> 00:35:28,003
Do you think I act like a man?

651
00:35:31,107 --> 00:35:33,241
I guess you have to a little.

652
00:35:36,045 --> 00:35:38,947
I try, but...

653
00:35:39,015 --> 00:35:41,282
I don't know
if I have it in me.

654
00:35:44,352 --> 00:35:46,587
I don't know if I want to.

655
00:36:10,144 --> 00:36:13,178
I'm sorry.
I can't sleep.

656
00:36:13,246 --> 00:36:16,114
Well, you cannot sneak up
on someone my age,

657
00:36:16,182 --> 00:36:17,917
especially in this house.

658
00:36:17,984 --> 00:36:20,653
I'm scared.

659
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,255
Can I sit with you?

660
00:36:23,323 --> 00:36:24,990
Only for a bit.

661
00:36:30,896 --> 00:36:33,297
What's that for?

662
00:36:33,365 --> 00:36:36,634
Why are you scared?

663
00:36:36,702 --> 00:36:38,402
I read the newspaper.

664
00:36:38,471 --> 00:36:39,971
Oh, honey.

665
00:36:40,038 --> 00:36:42,173
Did you pull it
out of the trash?

666
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,974
Why did that man do that?

667
00:36:44,041 --> 00:36:48,311
Well, probably because
he hates his mother.

668
00:36:48,379 --> 00:36:51,715
- I don't understand what happened.
- What happened?

669
00:36:51,783 --> 00:36:57,153
Those girls got ready for bed

670
00:36:57,221 --> 00:37:00,490
and there was
a knock on the door,

671
00:37:00,557 --> 00:37:02,959
and a handsome man was there.

672
00:37:03,026 --> 00:37:05,327
And maybe one of them knew him,

673
00:37:05,395 --> 00:37:07,396
but probably not

674
00:37:07,464 --> 00:37:13,068
<i>because he was probably</i>
<i>just watching them from afar.</i>

675
00:37:13,136 --> 00:37:17,672
All those young,
innocent nurses

676
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:20,542
in their short uniforms

677
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:22,811
stirring his desire.

678
00:37:22,879 --> 00:37:24,579
For what?

679
00:37:24,647 --> 00:37:26,481
What do you think?

680
00:37:26,549 --> 00:37:28,550
You're old enough to know.

681
00:37:28,618 --> 00:37:30,519
Why didn't they run away?

682
00:37:30,586 --> 00:37:32,653
Because they were scared.

683
00:37:32,721 --> 00:37:35,756
They probably thought,
"He can't rape nine of us."

684
00:37:35,824 --> 00:37:40,093
- Why not?
- You just can't.

685
00:37:40,161 --> 00:37:43,531
They didn't know it was going
to be worse than that.

686
00:37:45,901 --> 00:37:48,535
They didn't know what
was in store for them.

687
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:52,438
Now I'm really scared.

688
00:37:52,506 --> 00:37:54,774
It's not going to happen,

689
00:37:54,842 --> 00:37:58,077
not while I've got
my burglar alarm.

690
00:37:59,547 --> 00:38:02,114
How am I going to sleep?

691
00:38:04,617 --> 00:38:06,284
Get the water.

692
00:38:07,486 --> 00:38:09,120
What's that?

693
00:38:09,188 --> 00:38:10,722
It's Seconal.

694
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:18,997
Do you know how to take a pill?

695
00:38:22,834 --> 00:38:24,368
You two stop it.

696
00:38:24,436 --> 00:38:26,604
Damn it, Joanie!

697
00:38:26,672 --> 00:38:28,505
- Stop it.
- Gail, out!

698
00:38:28,574 --> 00:38:31,375
Take him out of here!

699
00:38:31,443 --> 00:38:33,143
<i>Open this door</i>

700
00:38:33,211 --> 00:38:35,946
or I will kick it down!

701
00:38:36,013 --> 00:38:37,480
Who goes back?

702
00:38:37,548 --> 00:38:41,150
I will throw a parade
for you every day

703
00:38:41,218 --> 00:38:44,153
- to thank you for preserving freedom.
- It's done.

704
00:38:44,221 --> 00:38:46,322
Well, you can't make a
decision like that without me

705
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:48,458
and you have never
understood that.

706
00:38:48,525 --> 00:38:50,460
If this was World War II and the
Japs were still attacking us,

707
00:38:50,527 --> 00:38:52,127
you'd say,
"Yes, of course!"

708
00:38:52,195 --> 00:38:55,464
Soldiers wanted to come home
from World War II also!

709
00:38:55,531 --> 00:38:58,634
I've got my orders,
you've got yours.

710
00:39:03,306 --> 00:39:07,076
- Where are you going?
- To meet the boys for a drink.

711
00:39:07,143 --> 00:39:09,243
He just needs
to blow off steam.

712
00:39:09,311 --> 00:39:10,678
Don't get involved, mother.

713
00:39:10,746 --> 00:39:13,615
You're a military wife.
You make sacrifices.

714
00:39:13,682 --> 00:39:16,717
Someone's Kevin is over there and he's
going to get hurt and Greg won't be there.

715
00:39:16,784 --> 00:39:19,686
But our Kevin is right in
there and he doesn't care.

716
00:39:19,754 --> 00:39:21,855
It's a year.
You can do it.

717
00:39:21,923 --> 00:39:24,591
- I'll help.
- No.

718
00:39:24,659 --> 00:39:26,192
Go lie down.

719
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:28,294
You don't even know
how tired you are.

720
00:39:38,127 --> 00:39:39,727
I hope you don't
mind the couch.

721
00:39:39,795 --> 00:39:41,662
Since my roommate moved
to the other room,

722
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:43,264
I just have a pile
of Abe's clothes.

723
00:39:43,332 --> 00:39:44,932
This is perfect.

724
00:39:46,168 --> 00:39:47,935
Well, good night, then.

725
00:40:00,482 --> 00:40:03,684
I-- I'll just--
I'll throw these out.

726
00:40:04,887 --> 00:40:06,586
Thanks.

727
00:40:11,592 --> 00:40:13,426
Good night.

728
00:40:23,202 --> 00:40:24,970
I'll see you later.

729
00:40:25,038 --> 00:40:26,972
No, you won't.

730
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,708
Don't argue with me.

731
00:40:29,776 --> 00:40:31,610
I have to get out of here.

732
00:40:31,678 --> 00:40:33,445
Hotel next time?

733
00:40:33,513 --> 00:40:35,648
No next time.

734
00:40:35,715 --> 00:40:37,615
That was a mistake.

735
00:40:37,683 --> 00:40:40,985
A mistake you love making.

736
00:40:43,188 --> 00:40:46,457
I'd better not see you again.

737
00:40:46,525 --> 00:40:48,726
You're not going to ruin this.

738
00:40:48,794 --> 00:40:50,862
You loved it.

739
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:52,430
And you'll love it again

740
00:40:52,497 --> 00:40:55,131
because you are
a sick, sick--

741
00:42:00,761 --> 00:42:03,830
<i>Hello? We're home.</i>

742
00:42:05,332 --> 00:42:07,066
Ma.

743
00:42:07,134 --> 00:42:08,868
Ma.

744
00:42:11,505 --> 00:42:13,272
What's going on?

745
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:15,140
Where's Sally?

746
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:18,376
Sally?

747
00:42:19,646 --> 00:42:21,346
<i>Sally?</i>

748
00:42:43,335 --> 00:42:45,236
How are you feeling?

749
00:43:03,787 --> 00:43:05,454
Where were you?

750
00:43:05,522 --> 00:43:07,390
I was right there.

751
00:43:09,393 --> 00:43:11,594
You're burning up.

752
00:43:13,597 --> 00:43:15,864
No, last night.

753
00:43:17,934 --> 00:43:20,068
I was waiting for you.

754
00:43:20,135 --> 00:43:22,103
I came right home.

755
00:43:22,171 --> 00:43:25,207
You were a mess.
I was really worried.

756
00:43:31,914 --> 00:43:33,981
You don't have
to worry about me.

757
00:43:38,986 --> 00:43:40,588
Okay.

758
00:43:55,703 --> 00:43:57,136
There are some scrambled
eggs in the bowl

759
00:43:57,204 --> 00:43:59,372
and I made flapjacks.

760
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,107
Just coffee.

761
00:44:01,174 --> 00:44:03,476
- Where's Kevin?
- You slept a long time.

762
00:44:03,544 --> 00:44:05,177
He was awake and went
back to bed already.

763
00:44:05,246 --> 00:44:07,246
I barely slept at all.

764
00:44:12,385 --> 00:44:16,221
I've been thinking
about it and...

765
00:44:16,289 --> 00:44:18,657
I want you to go.

766
00:44:18,725 --> 00:44:20,925
I'll put this away.

767
00:44:23,695 --> 00:44:26,597
I'm glad you came around.
It's only a year.

768
00:44:26,665 --> 00:44:31,335
No. I want you to go
and never come back.

769
00:44:31,403 --> 00:44:34,639
Damn it, Joanie.
They need me.

770
00:44:34,706 --> 00:44:37,775
Well, then, it works out,
because we don't.

771
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:40,710
I'm very important there.

772
00:44:40,778 --> 00:44:42,812
I have 20 docs and medics
who rely on me.

773
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,347
They look to me
for my skill and leadership.

774
00:44:45,415 --> 00:44:49,752
I'm glad the army
makes you feel like a man,

775
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:52,155
because I'm sick
of trying to do it.

776
00:44:52,222 --> 00:44:55,357
The army makes me feel
like a good man.

777
00:44:55,425 --> 00:44:58,928
You're not a good man.

778
00:44:58,996 --> 00:45:01,863
You never were,
even before we were married,

779
00:45:01,931 --> 00:45:04,666
and you know
what I'm talking about.

780
00:45:16,644 --> 00:45:19,146
If I walk out
that door, that's it.

781
00:45:23,151 --> 00:45:25,419
That's it.

782
00:45:43,871 --> 00:45:46,206
It's over.
