1
00:00:42,308 --> 00:00:46,506
I was expecting the Piersons as well,
but they're not coming. Please.

2
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:56,620
My goodness. Of course. Here, take mine.

3
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,862
I appreciate that both of you are here.

4
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:12,138
What happened?

5
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:15,173
The children were at the water fountain
during gym

6
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:19,143
and Sally told Becky Pierson
she should save some for the fish,

7
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:21,004
and Becky ignored her,

8
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:25,073
and Sally hit the back of her head
and her face went into the spigot.

9
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:29,554
And then Becky went after her...
Hair pulling, scratching.

10
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,287
She didn't need stitches in the end,
I understand?

11
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:39,127
This girl, this Becky Pierson,
Sally told me she's a bruiser.

12
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:40,964
She's heavy.

13
00:01:42,635 --> 00:01:45,103
The children poke pencils into her sides
when she's sitting

14
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:49,107
- because they think she can't feel it.
- Sally doesn't do that, does she?

15
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:50,198
No.

16
00:01:51,077 --> 00:01:53,978
But this bad behavior is new.

17
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:58,647
I know that you're expecting a child,
but she already has a little brother.

18
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:02,847
I guess what I'm asking is,
has anything changed at home recently?

19
00:02:05,658 --> 00:02:11,995
My... My father passed away. Last week.

20
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:18,401
The week before... Two weeks now.

21
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:27,278
- I feel terrible for bringing that up for you.
- Well, it has not been easy.

22
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:35,020
Is this Grandpa Gene we're talking about?
That poor thing.

23
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:40,716
- Sally didn't mention it?
- Why didn't you call us or send a note?

24
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:47,032
I don't think she missed a day.
Did she go to the funeral?

25
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:52,702
- Why would we put her through that?
- I don't think children belong in graveyards.

26
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:56,735
No, of course not.

27
00:02:58,144 --> 00:03:00,169
Now I realize why she was asking
all those questions

28
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,840
- about Medgar Evers' murder.
- She was?

29
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,647
I'm sorry.

30
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:10,115
- I have to use the ladies room again.
- We can talk about this another time.

31
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:13,386
No, I'm not as upset as I look.
I can't help this.

32
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:26,597
- I am mortified.
- It's not a good time.

33
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:30,342
No, and it really should be, shouldn't it?

34
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:35,575
Sally does need more attention.
She's grieving.

35
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:41,279
There is a very special pain
to losing someone at that age.

36
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:46,619
I don't know if you can understand that.

37
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:50,422
I can.

38
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:02,273
Mrs. Draper, I was just talking
to your husband and this really can wait.

39
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,676
Are you sure?

40
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:08,908
Because I just want to put it behind us.

41
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:13,315
I really just want everything to be okay
when the baby comes.

42
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:16,177
It's going to be a beautiful summer.

43
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:27,322
"Tipped a barman: 75 cents.
Hat-check tip at bar: 50 cents.

44
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:31,097
"Cab to restaurant: $1.12.
Tipped the cab driver: 38 cents.

45
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:33,832
"Dinner at Hausner's: $19.44."

46
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:39,434
It's better to have a bit of Don Draper
than no Don Draper at all.

47
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:41,513
I'd like that in writing.

48
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:46,340
It seems strange that the two of you
went on the same overnight trip

49
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:50,411
and you put in for $70 and he put in for $82.

50
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:53,559
If I were lying,
wouldn't I have made it a round number?

51
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:57,152
- Not that Don's lying.
- I signed his receipts, didn't I?

52
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:02,597
Which brings us to the undocumented
portion of my assessment.

53
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:08,130
The amount of pencils, pens, pads,
paper and postage

54
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:12,439
that are currently being consumed
suit a company four times our size.

55
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:20,518
It has also been brought to my attention
that a credenza has disappeared,

56
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,881
a theft that I believe
necessitates a conspiracy.

57
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:27,856
People forget that Karl Marx
was the greatest economist who ever lived,

58
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,929
and whatever you think of his solution,
the problem he posed

59
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,658
was about the catastrophic
up-and-down of the marketplace.

60
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:37,202
Tell the folks at Admiral
that Karl Marx says everything's okay.

61
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:40,397
Boom and bust. Bull and bear.
"I need a TV." "I have a TV."

62
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,906
Damn it, Paul,
someone helped Ken cherry-pick

63
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,876
all of Burt's successful accounts
and I've been left with the dogs.

64
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:49,573
- Admiral is not a dog.
- Sales are flat. It's all over their memos.

65
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:54,984
And now I have to look them in the eye
with nothing. Except maybe new creative.

66
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:57,750
Stop it.

67
00:05:58,624 --> 00:06:04,062
Now you're interested. There are some
areas of growth, and I mean literally, areas.

68
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:10,124
Atlanta, Oakland, Chicago,
Detroit, Newark, DC.

69
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:11,894
Great jazz cities.

70
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:15,440
And I left out St. Louis and Kansas City,
also growing.

71
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:20,010
- What does that mean?
- Great jazz musicians?

72
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:24,583
Seriously, is it possible that these Admirals
are being bought by negroes?

73
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:27,312
Lois caught her scarf
putting paper in the Xerox.

74
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,513
Maybe when Joan leaves
I can finally get rid of her.

75
00:06:29,622 --> 00:06:31,146
Can you pretend like you're back
in the media department

76
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:34,522
and tell me what this says to you?
Look at the cities.

77
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:37,494
Is it possible that negroes
are out-buying other people two-to-one?

78
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:40,498
You could jump to that conclusion,
I suppose.

79
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:45,099
Did you hear about Lois?
You got a winner there, Kinsey.

80
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:47,001
- Did you see it?
- I did.

81
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:52,837
So what's everybody doing tonight?
Baby. Married. Kinsey?

82
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:56,871
Do you want to go to the Mets game?
Tickets and a watch.

83
00:06:57,483 --> 00:07:01,510
- Why, thank you, Birds Eye.
- Does the watch say "Birds Eye" on it?

84
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:07,454
No, it says, "Hamilton Electric. "
What time is it? What time isn't it?

85
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:13,160
- Admiral is happy. We're happy.
- They're not happy!

86
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:17,926
"Morris, comma, in reference
to retooling the factory

87
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:21,063
"for London Fog children's
and young adults... "

88
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:27,839
I thought I'd bring you the minutes
to the meeting, since you had to run off.

89
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:34,983
You're wasting paper.

90
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:38,557
I'd have to make 1,000 to keep up
with your department.

91
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:42,486
They waste paper because
they throw out bad ideas.

92
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:46,395
They waste paper because they use it
to sop up spilled drinks,

93
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:48,330
right after their mid-afternoon naps.

94
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:50,299
You came here because
we do this better than you,

95
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:53,770
and part of that is letting our creatives
be unproductive until they are.

96
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:56,933
Pennies make pounds
and pounds make profits.

97
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:02,210
I don't want to talk to you this way.
I've tried it before and it never works.

98
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:07,247
- You're not usually this emotional.
- You want to make money?

99
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:14,759
Start getting your nails dirty
with Bert Cooper and Harry Crane.

100
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:19,329
Clients love to pay for media
and creative needs pencils.

101
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:22,159
I suppose I hadn't necessarily
thought of it that way.

102
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:24,600
And lay off of expense accounts.

103
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:27,605
Think of the men's morale,
not just your own.

104
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:30,772
<i>You've obviously seen
Bridge on the River Kwai.</i>

105
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:33,903
I've seen everything.
You have my ticket stubs.

106
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:50,422
<i>Your uncle Herman is on the line.
He won't leave a message.</i>

107
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:55,223
Uncle Herman?
My goodness, is Aunt Alice all right?

108
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:59,995
- Who is this?
- It's Peter. Dottie's boy. You called me.

109
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:02,730
- It's Duck. Duck Phillips.
- Duck.

110
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:06,770
Sorry for the cloak and dagger.
I didn't want to set off any alarm bells.

111
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:09,245
My name is Herman, you know that.

112
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,544
Except that I actually have an Uncle Herman
and he's 91.

113
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:16,053
That's a sick joke. I apologize.
It's been too long.

114
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:18,449
I don't know if you heard,
but I'm at Grey now.

115
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,984
What's that like?

116
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:23,991
People walking around the halls
all the time, laughing their heads off?

117
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:26,925
We're going to have lunch, you know.

118
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:30,460
I don't know, Duck.
It doesn't sound like a good idea.

119
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:32,830
Campbell, this is beyond
"No hard feelings. "

120
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:36,272
I won't waste your time.
Haven't I always been on your side?

121
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:41,708
<i>- When?
- I'll have my girl call your girl.</i>

122
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,571
I'll say it's Clorox.

123
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:56,318
Hello? Anyone home?

124
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:01,324
I'll get it. Hello?

125
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,530
<i>- Mr. Draper?
- Yes.</i>

126
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:09,704
This is Suzanne Farrell, Sally's teacher.
I'm not interrupting dinner, am I?

127
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:13,972
- No.
- I just felt I should call and apologize

128
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,980
about our meeting this morning.

129
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:18,274
Why?

130
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:23,652
Well, I...

131
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:30,722
What I mean is,
my father died when I was eight

132
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:36,358
and I might have overdone it,
relating to Sally in that way.

133
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,897
<i>I didn't mean to upset your wife, and...</i>

134
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:45,207
I guess I can get a little caught up in things
and lose perspective.

135
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:53,416
I don't know why I'm calling.
I'm embarrassing myself.

136
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:55,811
No, you're fine.

137
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:01,017
- If there's anything I can do...
- Don?

138
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:03,020
Betts!

139
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:06,860
Thanks for the call.

140
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:14,564
- It's time to go.
- Okay, we're going. Let me get my keys.

141
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,304
They're in your hand.

142
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:21,842
Francine took the kids. Who was that?

143
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:23,875
No one.

144
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,847
If you're parked in emergency,
you'll have to move soon.

145
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:31,354
First, let's make sure it's not a false alarm.

146
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:33,618
- This is my third time.
- We sent you home before?

147
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:35,216
No, third baby.

148
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:43,291
Your job's done.
The solarium's down the hall to the right.

149
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:45,165
Hang in there, Betts.

150
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,518
I came in early to cover for a friend,

151
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:04,055
so there's a chance I'll see you
the whole way through.

152
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:08,118
Daddy!

153
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,821
You can scream and yell
as much as you want in this hallway,

154
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:14,263
- but we're about to pass the nursery.
- Of course.

155
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,704
Excuse me.

156
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,870
I know it's silly, but I seem
to be having trouble with this pen.

157
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:28,378
- I believe it's empty.
- I gotta go.

158
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:35,850
Are you planning
to give the baby the breast?

159
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:38,185
- No.
- Last time you ate?

160
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:45,063
Lunch. Toast, cottage cheese, pineapple.

161
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:49,097
Pineapple? What were you thinking?
Anything else, sweetheart?

162
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:54,035
- Life Savers.
- Has your water broken?

163
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:59,303
My water never breaks.
When will Dr. Aldridge be here?

164
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:07,141
Joseph Waddell?

165
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:11,523
- I'm Dennis Hobart.
- That's good to know.

166
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:15,456
I haven't seen anybody in an hour.
What's going on?

167
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:20,227
- Well, we've had a shift change.
- My wife, Pam, Pamela Hobart.

168
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:24,100
She's fine. The baby's breech.
We're calling in a specialist.

169
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:27,001
- What?
- Didn't somebody get your permission?

170
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:29,768
Damn it, what is with you people?
I don't know a damn thing!

171
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,866
Please don't raise your voice.

172
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:34,810
Now, I apologize,
but we need your permission.

173
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:39,044
- Do whatever you have to do.
- We'll update you religiously. Promise.

174
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:52,662
This is not how I pictured it.
Where's all the backslapping?

175
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:58,499
You know, I brought this because
I thought it'd be a party in here.

176
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:02,997
- It's not, but I'll have one.
- Right now?

177
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:04,735
Whenever you want.

178
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:14,378
I left work this morning.
I've been here all day.

179
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:17,088
I am so bored.

180
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:24,660
I even called in.
Like the prison can't run without me.

181
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:41,474
- You done this before?
- Twice.

182
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:48,548
- And yet I never thought to bring a bottle.
- Well, what are we supposed to do?

183
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:56,723
My daughter took forever.
I remember being pretty worked up.

184
00:14:58,797 --> 00:15:01,061
And the nurse said, "Don't forget.

185
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:04,226
"Your wife's in the boat.
You're on the shore. "

186
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:09,796
- The other one a boy?
- Yes.

187
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:14,936
You throw the ball around?

188
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:18,314
Not enough.

189
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:41,168
All right, Mrs. Draper,
I'm going to need you to get on the bed

190
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:45,004
so I can prepare you for delivery.
This part should be familiar.

191
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:48,341
I'll shave you
and then give you a quick low enema.

192
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,723
Well, the good news is, time has stopped.

193
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:07,087
I'd like to have a gold watch one day,
but I can't, you know?

194
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,996
You don't want
to have anything on you like that.

195
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:10,932
Would they attack you?

196
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:16,373
I knew it was just a matter of time
before you started with the questions.

197
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:21,276
I bet you have a nightmare where you end
up in Sing Sing, right? Everybody does.

198
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:24,574
- I do.
- So what's it like?

199
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:30,210
You're outnumbered,
but you got the power.

200
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:32,551
Kind of like being a king.

201
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:37,393
- Except your subjects want to kill you.
- Maybe, but they don't,

202
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:41,826
'cause they know I'm dangerous,
and I got a badge, which they respect.

203
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:44,334
How do they know you're dangerous?

204
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:49,035
Well, they're not all bad. There's extremes.

205
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:52,171
We've got death row
and then we've got the baseball team.

206
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:54,575
In '29, they played the Yankees.

207
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:58,044
Everybody in stripes.

208
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,015
You're a funny one.

209
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:09,723
I tell a lot of jokes at work.
You hear some doozies.

210
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:16,900
I have to watch what I do when I leave work,
be careful not to bring it home.

211
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:19,564
Especially with a kid, right?

212
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:25,105
Just yesterday I was in A block

213
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:28,840
and I thought,
"Every single one of these animals,

214
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:32,112
"their mother had them, they were a baby. "

215
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:36,384
And I think, "There they are,
on the other side of the fence. "

216
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:41,050
And you know what? Every one of them
would blame their mom and dad.

217
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:45,262
- That's a bullshit excuse.
- That's true, Don.

218
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:58,232
You have little veins.
Breathe and think about the beauty parlor.

219
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:05,273
- Do you need to call someone else in?
- It's in.

220
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:10,051
The medication will help with the pain
and put you in a twilight sleep.

221
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:13,186
- Where is Dr. Aldridge?
- He's in the city.

222
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:17,084
He went to Mama Leone's
for his anniversary. Isn't that sweet?

223
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:18,686
Is he drinking?

224
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:20,998
'Cause my Aunt Emma,
her doctor was drunk,

225
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,590
and he ruined her bladder.

226
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:26,569
Dr. Mendelowitz, the obstetrician,
is on duty and will fill in.

227
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:30,600
- I don't want him. I don't know him.
- He's our top man.

228
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:32,176
I want Dr. Aldridge.

229
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,768
You have absolutely nothing
to worry about.

230
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,314
I don't want another doctor.
I want my doctor.

231
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:40,044
Sit back. You're at 5 centimeters.

232
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:43,688
That's halfway from here to the Hebrides
and other mountain ranges,

233
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:46,690
which we are currently studying
in chapter 12.

234
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,192
The doctor will be here and there.

235
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,698
The Hebrides are islands.

236
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:44,479
Try it now.

237
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,747
Thank you, Sister.

238
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:54,223
What do you make her for? Sixteen?

239
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:14,045
Pam was screaming at me in the car.

240
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:18,706
- I don't think that's unusual.
- That's my girl in there.

241
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:24,681
If something happens to her,

242
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:28,819
I just don't know what I'd do.

243
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:32,522
And then there'd be that baby.
How could I love that baby?

244
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:45,003
Our worst fears lie in anticipation.

245
00:20:47,212 --> 00:20:49,203
You're so sure about that?

246
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:55,311
- I want to go home, you bitch!
- Please relax!

247
00:20:55,921 --> 00:21:00,449
Let go of me! Get your hands off me!
Where's Don?

248
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,084
- He's in the waiting room.
- No, she can't hear you.

249
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:08,360
The hell I can't. Where is he? Where's Don?

250
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,991
- He's in the waiting room.
- Bullshit.

251
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:14,030
He's never where you expect him to be.

252
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:17,573
Have you seen him?
Have you been with him?

253
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:20,235
Seven centimeters. She's starting transition.

254
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:23,974
Someone call him. I don't want to be here.

255
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:27,281
Push the Demerol, 25 milligrams.

256
00:21:32,357 --> 00:21:36,384
I'm just a housewife.
Why are you doing this to me?

257
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:51,039
Mr. Hobart? Congratulations.
You have a little baby boy.

258
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:56,302
- Oh, my God.
- Your wife and your baby are doing fine.

259
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,445
Can I go in? Can I see her?

260
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:01,110
Not right now. She lost a lot of blood
and had a transfusion.

261
00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:06,122
- What? Please, I have to see her.
- Please, she's in recovery, resting.

262
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:10,694
But you can go to the nursery and look in
at your son. It's just down the hall.

263
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:12,093
Thank you.

264
00:22:18,403 --> 00:22:20,303
A baby boy.

265
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:27,072
- Congratulations.
- You're all right, Don.

266
00:22:30,315 --> 00:22:32,875
I'm sure yours is gonna be good, too.

267
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:39,145
You know what? I know it.

268
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,016
Thanks, Dennis.

269
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:51,263
You're an honest guy.
Believe me. I'm an expert.

270
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,464
Go see your baby.

271
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:59,436
Why do they put up with us?
You know, we don't deserve it.

272
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:07,208
This is a fresh start.
I don't know who's up there,

273
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:13,054
so I'm saying this to you.
I'm gonna be better.

274
00:23:15,093 --> 00:23:17,084
I'm gonna be a better man.

275
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:21,895
Tell me you heard me.

276
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:28,270
I heard you.

277
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:43,886
Don't fight the urge to bear down.

278
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:50,721
I can't. I can't. I can't do it.

279
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:55,794
Either you can do it or we will,
but it's going to come out some way.

280
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:34,965
Daddy?

281
00:24:36,374 --> 00:24:38,205
- Who are you?
- It's me.

282
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,871
I don't know you.

283
00:24:43,915 --> 00:24:45,610
It's me, Elizabeth.

284
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:52,646
You do know me.

285
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:58,361
- Okay, so it's me.
- What are you doing here?

286
00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:02,131
- I had to go away.
- Well, don't you miss me?

287
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:05,870
Of course. Listen.

288
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:10,066
Nobody knows I'm here, okay?

289
00:25:16,314 --> 00:25:17,645
Am I dying?

290
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:21,552
Ask your mother. Tell her, Ruthie.

291
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:26,624
Elizabeth, shut your mouth.
You'll catch flies.

292
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:37,166
I left my lunch pail on the bus
and I'm having a baby.

293
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:42,238
You see what happens to people
who speak up?

294
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:46,969
Be happy with what you have.

295
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:50,879
You'll be okay. You're a house cat.

296
00:25:50,982 --> 00:25:54,042
You're very important
and you have little to do.

297
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:40,288
- She's beautiful.
- It's a boy.

298
00:26:44,803 --> 00:26:46,430
You look terrible.

299
00:26:54,212 --> 00:26:58,080
- How do you feel?
- I need to put my face on.

300
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:01,619
You look beautiful, Betts.

301
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:06,919
- Gene.
- What did you say?

302
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:12,057
His name is Eugene.

303
00:27:14,165 --> 00:27:16,531
We don't have to decide that now.

304
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:19,795
Gene.

305
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,381
Did you get any sleep?

306
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:38,650
No, and I don't expect to
for the next six months.

307
00:27:43,962 --> 00:27:46,362
I wasn't sure where to put it all.

308
00:27:50,435 --> 00:27:55,429
Mr. Draper's office. Please hold.
It's Mr. Sterling. Are you in?

309
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,846
- Roger.
- Dada.

310
00:28:06,484 --> 00:28:08,679
- Where are you?
- Down the hall.

311
00:28:09,587 --> 00:28:11,054
How's Betty? She perform like a champ?

312
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:13,949
<i>- She did.
- I need his initials.</i>

313
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:17,293
Jane's gonna put them on the back
of her yacht or something for him.

314
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:18,789
No name yet.

315
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:21,232
There's a lot of guys
twiddling their thumbs down in art.

316
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:25,293
- Why were you in the art department?
- Lane was.

317
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:28,371
Apparently, we're all backed up. No one
will move forward without your approval.

318
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:31,602
- I missed half a day.
- Well, Betty had the baby, not you.

319
00:28:32,944 --> 00:28:35,139
- I'll see what I can do.
- Good.

320
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:38,710
That guy's a tick.
See you at the traffic meeting.

321
00:28:44,322 --> 00:28:46,153
Can I get some coffee?

322
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:52,954
You know what it's like in that office.
No one ever buys me lunch.

323
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:56,596
- I like the turtleneck.
- Really?

324
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:08,706
- Come. Join us.
- What is she doing here?

325
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:10,505
Don't worry about it. I know what I'm doing.

326
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:12,776
- No, you don't.
- Have a nosh.

327
00:29:14,552 --> 00:29:17,817
Two months at Grey
and you're already having a nosh?

328
00:29:25,396 --> 00:29:27,660
I didn't know until I got here.

329
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:32,803
Look, I woke up one day
and had a realization.

330
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:39,037
- You two have a secret relationship.
- What? That's ridiculous.

331
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:41,744
Come on. The way you handled
that Freddy Rumsen thing

332
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:43,575
so that she could move up?

333
00:29:43,681 --> 00:29:46,946
I've been doing this a long time.
I know what I saw.

334
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:50,387
- That's not what happened.
- You can be modest if you want to,

335
00:29:50,488 --> 00:29:54,015
but that kind of focused ambition
is rare in advertising.

336
00:29:54,325 --> 00:29:55,622
Thank you.

337
00:29:57,162 --> 00:29:59,995
I want to take you both with me
to the promised land.

338
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:03,261
At Grey,
an account man is expected to have ideas,

339
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:05,595
and creatives are expected to be geniuses.

340
00:30:05,703 --> 00:30:09,730
You'll be sitting on velvet pillows,
showered with riches, awards.

341
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:14,502
- We're not going anywhere. Well, she can.
- Do we have to go together?

342
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:21,815
Pete, I know you have ideas
and you're a risk-taker.

343
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,088
Sterling Cooper
is never going to reward that.

344
00:30:26,791 --> 00:30:30,124
Well, thank you. Anything else?

345
00:30:30,428 --> 00:30:33,659
Don't be a baby. You should be taking
meetings like this twice a week.

346
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:37,360
If you want to woo me,
you'll have to buy me my own lunch.

347
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:44,170
- Maybe I should leave, too.
- Why would you do that?

348
00:30:45,243 --> 00:30:48,940
You're so talented.
You should strike while the iron's hot.

349
00:30:49,414 --> 00:30:52,212
- What does that mean?
- It means the sky's the limit.

350
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:54,080
No mortgage, no family.

351
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:57,985
You're a freewheeling career gal
with great ideas. Am I wrong?

352
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:03,425
- I don't know.
- This is your time, Peggy.

353
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:29,450
Let me ask you something, Hollis.
What type of TV do you have?

354
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:31,784
- An RCA.
- Really?

355
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:36,185
Color? Why did you get it?

356
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:40,688
- To watch TV.
- But why an RCA specifically?

357
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,060
I didn't see any difference, I guess.

358
00:31:46,337 --> 00:31:49,306
Sixteen. Good afternoon, gentlemen.

359
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:57,173
A lot of negroes prefer Admiral.
I've done research.

360
00:31:58,016 --> 00:31:59,483
I have an RCA.

361
00:32:00,885 --> 00:32:05,185
- So, do your friends buy Admirals?
- I'm sorry, sir. I can't really say.

362
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:18,392
Look. This is important and I'd really like
to have an honest conversation with you.

363
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:20,428
I don't want to get into trouble.

364
00:32:20,538 --> 00:32:23,871
- It's just us. It's just Hollis and...
- Mr. Campbell.

365
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,746
Do you think I'm a bigot?

366
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:32,679
I just want to know
why you bought your TV.

367
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:39,690
- I don't know. I don't remember.
- It's your TV. It's a big purchase.

368
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:43,691
- I don't even watch the damn thing.
- Really? Why not?

369
00:32:43,928 --> 00:32:48,365
Why should I? We've got bigger problems
to worry about than TV, okay?

370
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:52,626
You're thinking about this
in a very narrow way.

371
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:56,173
The idea is that everyone is going
to have a house, a car, a television...

372
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:58,002
The American dream.

373
00:33:08,186 --> 00:33:11,485
- It's my job.
- Every job has its ups and downs.

374
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:18,028
You don't watch baseball?
I don't believe you.

375
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:56,897
- What are you doing out of bed?
- I smelled something.

376
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:00,933
- What are you making?
- A snack. You want some?

377
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:06,642
- I didn't know you could cook.
- Mommy's much better at it.

378
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:13,517
- Are you looking for a chick?
- I am.

379
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:20,248
Miss Farrell told us about that
when we went to the farm.

380
00:34:21,592 --> 00:34:24,686
But she says those eggs
can never become a chicken,

381
00:34:24,796 --> 00:34:28,493
- even though they come out of a chicken.
- Why's that?

382
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,364
Because they're from the store.

383
00:34:32,537 --> 00:34:36,303
And you know what else?
If you hold an egg up and it has veins in it,

384
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:39,399
- you can shake it, then eat it.
- Really?

385
00:34:40,611 --> 00:34:42,340
It's called addling.

386
00:34:47,351 --> 00:34:50,320
Is the baby gonna live
in Grandpa Gene's room?

387
00:34:55,626 --> 00:34:58,857
It's not Grandpa Gene's room.
It's the baby's room.

388
00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:09,131
- I thought it was gonna be a girl.
- Well, I thought you were gonna be a boy.

389
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:14,835
Not all surprises are bad.

390
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:26,584
- Everything's gonna be fine.
- That's what Miss Farrell said.

391
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:29,882
Well, then I guess it must be true.

392
00:35:54,018 --> 00:35:59,456
Burt Peterson's firing was undignified.
Building security. That's all I'll say.

393
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:04,351
Confirm a couple of rumors.
Did he throw a desk chair against a window

394
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:07,226
only to have it bounce back
and knock him over?

395
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:08,320
Not that I know of.

396
00:36:08,432 --> 00:36:11,333
Did he make a number two in a file cabinet?

397
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:18,473
Burt Peterson lived hard and loved hard.
So, Harry here is an expert in media.

398
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:24,406
- Television. The air, not the sets.
- Now, Admiral Television sales are flat.

399
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:27,048
- We know that.
- But as we studied your indices,

400
00:36:27,151 --> 00:36:29,745
we realized that they're not flat everywhere.

401
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:33,950
In fact, among negroes,
sales are actually growing.

402
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:36,986
- We know that, too.
- You do?

403
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:42,695
No, of course you do.

404
00:36:44,168 --> 00:36:48,798
These are your numbers, but I think
we've discovered an interesting strategy.

405
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:52,103
<i>This is Ebony.</i>

406
00:36:54,078 --> 00:36:56,205
By negroes, for negroes.

407
00:36:57,248 --> 00:37:03,312
<i>Jet. Space in these magazines costs far less
than what you currently spend.</i>

408
00:37:05,456 --> 00:37:09,756
Daily newspapers that go just to this market
for pennies on the dollar.

409
00:37:10,294 --> 00:37:11,318
And?

410
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:22,031
Shift a portion of the media budget
from lower-indexing white areas

411
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:23,902
to this market, where it can do more good.

412
00:37:24,008 --> 00:37:27,239
They already like it and we can make them
buy more by increasing the exposure.

413
00:37:27,345 --> 00:37:29,643
A 5% sales bump in Detroit alone

414
00:37:29,847 --> 00:37:33,544
would make you the same profit
as a 2% increase system-wide.

415
00:37:33,884 --> 00:37:36,819
And ads on television geared to this market
and white markets

416
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:40,448
- will have double the effect.
- A negro ad and a white ad?

417
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:44,888
So, Campbell,
you're making twice the ads for us now.

418
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:48,293
No, do them together. Integrate it.

419
00:37:48,866 --> 00:37:52,427
- I don't think that's legal.
- Of course it's legal.

420
00:37:53,671 --> 00:37:56,572
Look, this conversation is not worth having.

421
00:37:57,375 --> 00:38:00,469
Who's to say that negroes
aren't buying Admiral televisions

422
00:38:00,578 --> 00:38:03,342
because they think
white people want them?

423
00:38:09,353 --> 00:38:13,153
<i>- Miss Olson is here to see you.
- Send her in.</i>

424
00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:18,655
Sorry.

425
00:38:21,899 --> 00:38:25,198
I know he doesn't need clothes,
but don't return it.

426
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:28,204
I'm the youngest. I never had anything new.

427
00:38:28,506 --> 00:38:30,974
- You didn't have to do that.
- I did.

428
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:34,475
No one told me
they were all going in on it together.

429
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:40,648
I heard you were back at work,
but now I wonder if that's true.

430
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:42,343
I invited you in.

431
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:48,617
I don't know if this is the best time.
I don't know. It's kind of serious.

432
00:38:57,034 --> 00:38:59,901
I've been thinking about my situation here,

433
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:03,130
and I'm so grateful to you
for all you've done.

434
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:05,670
I just...

435
00:39:07,411 --> 00:39:10,278
Well, you know, I'm paid very little.

436
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:16,512
My secretary doesn't respect me because
I make $71 more a week than she does.

437
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:19,521
Maybe we need to get you
a cheaper secretary.

438
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:24,421
Paul Kinsey does the same work that I do,
and not as well sometimes.

439
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:28,623
And I don't know if you read it in the paper,
but they passed a law

440
00:39:28,733 --> 00:39:32,726
where women who do the same work
as men will get paid the same thing.

441
00:39:32,837 --> 00:39:34,134
Equal pay.

442
00:39:36,073 --> 00:39:37,665
It's not a good time.

443
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:41,973
It's not a good time for me, Don.
Do you know how expensive this city is?

444
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:46,812
It's not gonna happen, Peggy, not now.
I'm fighting for paperclips around here.

445
00:39:58,696 --> 00:40:02,188
Third time. It must be old hat.

446
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:21,108
- You're gonna be fine, Peggy.
- I look at you and I think,

447
00:40:23,387 --> 00:40:26,550
- "I want what he has. "
- Really?

448
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:34,587
You have everything, and so much of it.

449
00:40:39,703 --> 00:40:41,967
I suppose that's probably true.

450
00:40:52,483 --> 00:40:54,542
What do you want me to say?

451
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:02,091
I don't think I could have been any clearer.

452
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:07,162
You see what's been going on here
the last six months?

453
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:21,444
What if this is my time?

454
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:44,191
Hey.

455
00:41:46,403 --> 00:41:50,305
- Where are you going?
- To the ladies room. You want to join me?

456
00:41:51,141 --> 00:41:53,541
- Did you tell Don about Duck?
- That's none of your business.

457
00:41:53,644 --> 00:41:57,375
Sure, they hear you're shopping around,
they'll want you more, but me?

458
00:41:57,481 --> 00:42:00,314
I'm sharing my job with Kenny.
I'm already redundant.

459
00:42:00,417 --> 00:42:02,544
You have relationships with your clients.
That's leverage.

460
00:42:02,653 --> 00:42:05,622
- Did you say something?
- It's my decision, Pete.

461
00:42:05,723 --> 00:42:07,691
Your decisions affect me.

462
00:42:28,979 --> 00:42:33,075
If it isn't Martin Luther King.
I should dropkick you off the roof.

463
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:38,782
Admiral Television has no interest
in becoming a colored television company.

464
00:42:39,189 --> 00:42:41,919
But they are. It seems illogical to me

465
00:42:42,026 --> 00:42:45,553
that they would reject an opportunity
to make more money.

466
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:47,994
Then again, I'm in advertising.

467
00:42:48,098 --> 00:42:51,465
This is a sensitive issue.
Businesses hate that.

468
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:53,398
Let me put it in account terms.

469
00:42:53,504 --> 00:42:56,769
Are you aware of the number of hand jobs
I'm gonna have to give?

470
00:42:56,874 --> 00:42:58,205
Am I being taken off the account?

471
00:42:58,309 --> 00:43:00,470
I'm going to have to pretend
I had you killed!

472
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,273
Sales are flat. I had to do something.

473
00:43:02,379 --> 00:43:04,244
I don't know if anyone's ever told you
that half the time

474
00:43:04,348 --> 00:43:07,715
this business comes down to,
"I don't like that guy. "

475
00:43:10,154 --> 00:43:12,349
Are we done with the flogging?

476
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:17,122
Never as good as you think it's gonna be.

477
00:43:18,162 --> 00:43:20,494
If I may. Bert, Roger,

478
00:43:21,565 --> 00:43:25,695
it does seem as though there's money
to be made in the negro market.

479
00:43:25,903 --> 00:43:27,962
Obviously not with Admiral,

480
00:43:28,138 --> 00:43:32,234
but I don't think it would be wrong of us
to pursue it in some way.

481
00:43:32,676 --> 00:43:33,836
Really?

482
00:43:34,878 --> 00:43:39,110
I've just moved here.
I'm a stranger in a strange land,

483
00:43:40,417 --> 00:43:43,944
but I can tell you
there's definitely something going on.

484
00:43:45,556 --> 00:43:49,014
We'll look into it. You can go.

485
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:42,410
- We're here!
- She's here!

486
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:44,606
- Mommy! Daddy!
- Mommy! Mommy!

487
00:44:44,782 --> 00:44:46,374
Welcome, welcome!

488
00:44:47,918 --> 00:44:49,044
Mommy!

489
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:51,718
- Careful.
- Here, let me take him.

490
00:44:56,827 --> 00:44:58,590
I missed you so much.

491
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:02,559
Wait till you see your fridge.

492
00:45:03,133 --> 00:45:07,365
If there's a power outage,
you can feed the entire street for a month.

493
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:14,072
- Hi, baby. I'm your brother, Bobby.
- Remember, you have to be careful.

494
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:16,510
How was it?

495
00:45:17,247 --> 00:45:20,739
You know. It was all a fog.

496
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:25,782
You're making a mistake
not forcing Carla to stay.

497
00:45:26,256 --> 00:45:29,419
She's been away from her family.
And I can manage.

498
00:45:29,993 --> 00:45:33,224
- I know some girls.
- You want something to eat?

499
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:36,426
- Sure.
- I got it. Come on.
