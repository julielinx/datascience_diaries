1
00:01:27,687 --> 00:01:28,984
You're asking if I've seen these before?

2
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:31,684
They've been running this for ten years.

3
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:33,383
The Playtex people are jealous.

4
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:34,585
They shouldn't be.

5
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:37,128
Maidenform is a dream,
but Playtex is a bra.

6
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,460
I've never seen either brand go wrong.

7
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:40,828
I had four of these up in my dorm.

8
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,027
I didn't even know what advertising was.

9
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:45,331
Why now? Sales are strong.

10
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:47,372
Someone has a wife with an opinion.

11
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:49,442
They would like to do
what Maidenform is doing,

12
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:51,373
not what we're doing.

13
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:54,504
Why? Then they both
have the same campaign.

14
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,172
I love how they don't need a diagram.

15
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:57,715
Peggy, do you wear Playtex?

16
00:01:57,817 --> 00:01:59,444
And if so, why?

17
00:02:00,753 --> 00:02:02,414
I do,

18
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:05,389
and I agree with
the 95 women we surveyed

19
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:07,357
about how well it fits.

20
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,553
I find they both open easily.

21
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:11,892
I like a happy client,

22
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:13,693
although you'd think
someone would be able

23
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,199
to talk them out of jumping
onto a bandwagon

24
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:17,769
- as solid as this.
- Maybe they want us to raise the bar.

25
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:20,305
Why, because their share
of the market keeps increasing?

26
00:02:20,406 --> 00:02:21,532
You see them every four months.

27
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:22,608
Why not throw them a bone?

28
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:23,733
Let them see they're paying for creative.

29
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:26,073
Just wrinkle it a little.

30
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:27,510
I went to sleep in my bra,

31
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:29,411
and I thought I was so-and-so.

32
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:32,145
Thank you for that.

33
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:34,743
Just for fun, let's say
we're looking for new,

34
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:37,482
and by new I mean old Maidenform.

35
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:41,424
Peggy, you dig in around
Playtex's unique benefits.

36
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:42,688
Just the man to do it.

37
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:44,092
What do I tell them?

38
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:45,892
Tell them you couldn't get a hold of me.

39
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:53,005
Mr. Phillips, your ex...

40
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:54,630
your wife...

41
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:56,231
Mrs. Phillips...

42
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:58,310
Pauline. I see her.

43
00:02:58,411 --> 00:02:59,935
Thank you, Joyce.

44
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:04,873
Hey, fella.

45
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:07,782
Hey, Chauncey. Come here.

46
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:11,482
Someone made you
smell like a girl, yes.

47
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:13,948
Come on. This way.

48
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:17,320
Hey, slugger.

49
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,590
Hey, Dad.

50
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,131
- Precious.
- Hi, Daddy.

51
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:24,494
- You look well.
- So do you.

52
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:26,764
How's your mother?

53
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,433
Worse. She's very erratic.

54
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:32,634
Did you see the guy up at Brigham

55
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:33,939
that Bob Levinson recommended?

56
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,981
I don't want to talk
about this right now.

57
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:38,913
I can't leave right now.

58
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:40,280
I wish you would have told me

59
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:41,614
that you were going to be early.

60
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,484
Well, I know you're not
good in the afternoons.

61
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,785
That's not true anymore.
You know that.

62
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:48,121
Okay.

63
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,219
You two have a good time.

64
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:51,820
I will try and call you from Nana's.

65
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:53,330
Did you get a suite?

66
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:55,424
They opened up the room next door.

67
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:57,196
I even got a rollaway for Chauncey.

68
00:03:57,303 --> 00:04:00,170
'Cause he's a good boy. Yeah.

69
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:02,298
We're going to have
a wonderful time on the town.

70
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,638
I got tickets
for A Funny Thing Happened.

71
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,109
We saw it.

72
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:07,611
Not from these seats.

73
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:09,272
I should go.

74
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,920
So, you'll have to wait
a little while in my office,

75
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:18,923
do your studies, work up an appetite.

76
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:19,992
It's Memorial Day.

77
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,651
All I have is German vocabulary.

78
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,661
Hey, Duck. Sorry to bother you.

79
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,958
Nice dog.

80
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:27,293
Who are these?

81
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,698
This is my son Mark
and my daughter Patricia.

82
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:30,996
A handsome family.

83
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,072
And this is Chauncey.

84
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:35,640
I hope he can't smell cat on me.

85
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:37,471
Freddie and I work together.

86
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:39,135
Can I bend your ear a minute?

87
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:40,542
Spit it out, Freddie.

88
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:44,840
We're going to need
another box of brassieres.

89
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:48,382
Yes. Of course.

90
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:50,886
Enjoy your holiday.

91
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:53,657
Come on, Chauncey.

92
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:01,496
Her skin cleared up,
but she still looks unhappy.

93
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:02,693
She's a cheerleader.

94
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,793
For who, the University of Dour?

95
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,200
Does she have any cute friends?

96
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,538
These are the top three.

97
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:13,476
I'm sorry, but compared to the kids
on American Bandstand,

98
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:14,705
they look miserable.

99
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:15,940
Those kids are drunk.

100
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:16,947
Really?

101
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,278
I don't know.

102
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:21,319
What about the idea of them
going on a date?

103
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:25,119
Mr. And Mrs. Fresh Face.

104
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:26,885
We could do multiple panels in print,

105
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,961
but it would really translate to TV.

106
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:30,029
How?

107
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:31,494
Like a contest?

108
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:33,690
No, it's a story.

109
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,859
Anticipation as they get ready,

110
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:38,766
fixing their hair to look perfect.

111
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:41,135
Their skin, it's not even on their mind.

112
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,765
They're two kids
who used to have a problem.

113
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:46,276
Thanks, Clearasil.

114
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:49,280
Maybe, but it's prom night,

115
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:54,251
and it ends with him at the door
and her and a corsage,

116
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,481
the first moment
they see each other.

117
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:57,578
And Dad with the Brownie?

118
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,715
Clearasil...

119
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:01,794
and some kind of line.

120
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:05,323
What about "Thanks, Clearasil"?

121
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:07,558
I need to think about it.

122
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:09,464
I can work with that.

123
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:11,537
You want to run this
by your father-in-law?

124
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:13,400
Eventually.

125
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:18,203
Have a nice holiday.

126
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:33,821
So how the hell are you, Don?

127
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:34,950
Good. How are you, Crab?

128
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,585
Glad to be in shorts.

129
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:37,788
You don't play?

130
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,489
I don't mind watching.

131
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:40,861
Whenever it's this hot,

132
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:43,527
I think about that summer
they executed the Rosenbergs.

133
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:44,796
It was always about to rain.

134
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,235
I remember that.

135
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:47,806
We were still in Manhattan.

136
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,238
- I don't miss it.
- Yep.

137
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:51,810
We get them to close Sing Sing,
we'll be in Shangri-la.

138
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,435
I keep having this dream

139
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:55,309
that there's a power failure
and the gates open.

140
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,975
Hadn't thought of that.

141
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,551
Let's change the subject.

142
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:02,212
Eventually, I just said, "Fine.

143
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:05,722
"If Lem Jones Associates is falling apart,
maybe it's time to move on."

144
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:07,725
I hadn't heard about that.

145
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:10,057
I guess you PR men have the best PR.

146
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:13,064
Yeah, I went to Rogers & Cowan
and left it burning behind me.

147
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,497
What happened over there?

148
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:25,567
I was on the team that took the fall
for the Cuban Revolutionary Council.

149
00:07:25,678 --> 00:07:27,236
The Bay of Pigs?

150
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:29,940
The CIA hired us
to help inspire the Cuban people

151
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:33,246
to a coordinated wave
of sabotage and rebellion.

152
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:34,512
You handled that?

153
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,748
Not as badly as they did.

154
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:40,189
But I don't know when Don's going
to be able to get away.

155
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,022
High-class problems, my dear.

156
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:45,586
Marcie, we should say
hello to Chuck and Ann.

157
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:59,076
I didn't know you belonged here.

158
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:01,976
I've been coming here
since I was a kid.

159
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:03,742
We're guests of the Pattersons.

160
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:07,914
Where's Tara?

161
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,684
Over there, I think.

162
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,224
I haven't seen you riding.

163
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,692
I suppose that's true.

164
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:18,059
I know you changed your schedule,

165
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,758
and I'm afraid I had
something to do with that.

166
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:22,926
No. Don't be ridiculous.

167
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:28,740
All I wanted to say is
please ride when you want.

168
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,308
I'll stay out of your way.

169
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:33,401
It's very nice to see you.

170
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,981
Arthur, it's okay.

171
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:40,109
As we used to say in college,
let's be friends.

172
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:43,211
Good. Because I think
you would have enjoyed

173
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:45,381
seeing me get nosed
into the trough the other day.

174
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:46,651
No.

175
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:47,953
Yes.

176
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:51,692
Mommy! Mommy!

177
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:59,996
Well, it's nice to see you.

178
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:01,539
You as well.

179
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:06,667
It had nothing to do with Kennedy.

180
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:09,748
Still, all that vigor disappeared

181
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:12,317
when he found out
he couldn't get anything done.

182
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:14,147
It's Versailles.

183
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:16,187
Jackie's smiling all over the world.

184
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:17,950
He's chasing starlets.

185
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,490
Everybody's happy.

186
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:21,321
I'm building a bomb shelter.

187
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:22,451
Really?

188
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,087
If you see Petra, don't mention it.

189
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:26,664
She doesn't want people to know.

190
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:28,631
Good seeing you, Don.

191
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,201
Let me know if you need a reference.

192
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:31,463
We'd love to have you here.

193
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,937
If I could have everyone's attention
for a moment.

194
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,530
Please be seated.

195
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:38,334
It is a tradition

196
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:42,312
that we have our ribs and fashion show
on this day every year.

197
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:46,351
Well, this is not to dim
our resolute admiration

198
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:51,719
for the fortitude of those
who have so nobly served our country,

199
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:55,988
many of whom will not be
enjoying ribs this afternoon.

200
00:09:57,663 --> 00:10:00,826
If you could please stand,
all servicemen,

201
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:04,869
for a moment of our
insufficient appreciation.

202
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:07,030
Including Lester Aaron.

203
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:10,108
Lester was a Rough Rider.

204
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:13,110
Please, heroes, on your feet.

205
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:47,768
Can you close the door?

206
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,871
You're letting the air out.

207
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,506
Those look delicious.

208
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:53,244
It's not the club,

209
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:55,843
but at least you know
I washed my hands.

210
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:57,752
How are things in the circus?

211
00:10:57,857 --> 00:10:59,085
Damn serious.

212
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:02,091
What is this?

213
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:03,627
J&B.

214
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:05,162
The network sent me a case.

215
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:07,892
This is why I don't have a TV.

216
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,192
You want something else?

217
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:11,496
He'll suffer through it.

218
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:12,935
Do you know where you're summering?

219
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,904
We were thinking Point O'Woods.

220
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:17,236
I have to work, though.

221
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:20,244
Mother's going to expect you on Fishers.

222
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,610
I see her crossing the widow's walk
with an eye to the sea.

223
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:23,773
Peter.

224
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:25,578
I was on the phone
with her the other day,

225
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,482
and you were all she talked about.

226
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:30,077
- Really?
- No. I'm kidding.

227
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:34,090
I don't think I know
what's funny about that.

228
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,626
Judy, would you help me
with the corn?

229
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,129
Now, listen. Don't scrimp.

230
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:40,596
Take a vacation.

231
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,497
Don't Trudy's folks have
some incredible vacation spread?

232
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:45,035
It's not about the money, Bud.

233
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:47,128
I'm very important to the agency.

234
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:48,672
My absence is felt.

235
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:52,373
Yes. Well.

236
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,740
Let's see how
the Ottomanelli Brothers treated us.

237
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:03,582
And here's Annette Fogel
ready for the playa.

238
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:05,714
That's Spanish for beach, gentlemen,

239
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:07,622
and that's where you'll want to be.

240
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:12,492
If something sportier
is what you're looking for,

241
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:14,828
- check out...
- I have to go.

242
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:16,060
...last year's singles champion.

243
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:18,363
Really? You're really going?

244
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:21,133
I wouldn't think you'd want to leave this.

245
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,037
People will be working. I should stop by.

246
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:24,666
Okay.

247
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:28,008
You're going to miss the sparklers.

248
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:29,809
Call me from the emergency room.

249
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:32,509
Oh, and this delight, Judy Sawyer,

250
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:35,815
is ready for the beaches of California,

251
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:39,379
where she loves to do the Watusi.

252
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:51,497
Room 301.

253
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:56,634
Hello.

254
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:58,767
You're there. Good.

255
00:12:58,878 --> 00:12:59,867
Yes.

256
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:03,278
But there's been a change of plans.

257
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:05,145
I'm spending the day with my son.

258
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:06,582
We're going to the beach.

259
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:08,243
Your son?

260
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:09,753
He's 18.

261
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:14,720
I don't know why
I never brought him up.

262
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:20,591
Jimmy will be at the Beverly Hills
for the next ten days.

263
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:23,190
Los Angeles. That's far away.

264
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:26,601
No. It's some club in Kentucky.

265
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:28,172
Still far away.

266
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:32,870
I could stay out at the beach,
and you could join.

267
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,536
You never saw it.

268
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,080
Don't do that.

269
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:38,514
What? You never think about it?

270
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:40,551
No.

271
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,918
I do. All the time.

272
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:47,720
The car on its side,
your body crushing me.

273
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,352
I don't know why I think about it.

274
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:51,724
Maybe I do.

275
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:54,426
I'll call you.

276
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:56,398
I'd like that.

277
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,035
Morning.

278
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:07,335
Hello.

279
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:11,671
I ran that "Thanks, Clearasil" thing
by my father-in-law.

280
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:12,869
He loved it.

281
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:14,605
I'm glad.

282
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:17,944
The libraries were closed yesterday.

283
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,210
What did you do?

284
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:20,410
I was working,

285
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:21,747
and then there was a barbecue.

286
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:22,843
It was too hot.

287
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:24,286
It was too hot.

288
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,915
Trudy and I saw Liberty Valance.

289
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:28,425
It goes along for a while,

290
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:29,926
and then it takes a turn

291
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:31,894
and ends up exactly where
you thought it was going.

292
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:34,591
John Wayne shot him.

293
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,668
Have you seen it yet?

294
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,067
It's okay. You saved me 50 cents.

295
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:41,264
I'm sorry. I hate people who do that.

296
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:45,208
I know you don't like the line.

297
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:48,906
Look, it's all about keeping
your father-in-law happy.

298
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:51,278
I do my job, you do yours.

299
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:54,074
What's that supposed to mean?

300
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:56,177
Nothing.

301
00:15:57,656 --> 00:15:59,954
Just play with it.

302
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:01,048
Okay?

303
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:05,988
So you're still out there in Brooklyn?

304
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:07,190
Yes.

305
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,392
Where again?

306
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:10,991
Marine Park?

307
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:12,764
No, I moved a while ago.

308
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:15,203
I'm on my second apartment,
in Prospect Park.

309
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:17,468
East 83rd Street.

310
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:19,271
It's a ghost town.

311
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:21,972
But my brother came to my cookout.

312
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:23,412
Who were you with?

313
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:26,507
My family.

314
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:29,109
Pete, look, I really do
have a lot of work to do.

315
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:30,245
Of course.

316
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:34,124
Let me know where you land.

317
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:43,966
How was your day off?

318
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:45,866
Restful.

319
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:47,598
I went to the beach.

320
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:48,866
Too much, I see.

321
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:51,067
I got it behind my knees.

322
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:53,167
I couldn't sit down.

323
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:54,643
Morning.

324
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:56,715
Good morning, Mr. Sterling.

325
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:01,853
Has your wife seen that yet?

326
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:05,613
Do me a favor.
Let me be there when it happens.

327
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:06,850
Is that why you're here?

328
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,790
Concerned for my well-being?

329
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:11,454
Here's your cigarette. Be on your way.

330
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:13,360
But wait. There's more.

331
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:15,831
You are going to have lunch with Duck.

332
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:17,663
Perhaps on a train car,

333
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:20,068
because I want you to sign an armistice
on American Airlines.

334
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:22,072
What are you talking about?

335
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:23,698
I've been in the meetings.

336
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:27,040
Errol Flynn is gone,
and so is my taste for swordplay.

337
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:28,340
You two need to put them away.

338
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:30,415
I have.

339
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:31,778
I've been married for over 20 years.

340
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,682
I know the difference between a spat
and spending a month on the couch.

341
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:36,311
Don't go to bed angry.

342
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,498
Two hot chocolates.

343
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,266
I don't want it.

344
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:51,927
Sure you do.

345
00:17:52,037 --> 00:17:53,868
It's good when it's hot
to drink something hot.

346
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:56,770
If you continued with the Scouts,
you would have learned that.

347
00:17:56,875 --> 00:18:00,311
Patty, you can use the phone,
but Miss Morrison works for me, not you.

348
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:03,037
Daddy has a morning meeting.

349
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:05,708
There's a food cart.
It'll be here in 20 minutes.

350
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:07,979
No scraps for Chauncey.

351
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,453
I have money. I have $150.

352
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:11,648
Mark.

353
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:12,849
That's good.

354
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,823
How did you get that tidy sum?

355
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,895
Mr. Reeve gave it to me.

356
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:18,326
And why would he do that?

357
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,927
Because he wants us to be happy
when he marries Mom.

358
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:30,203
We all want you to be happy.

359
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:32,743
And whatever his intentions,
it's very generous.

360
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:34,904
He already asked her.

361
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:37,573
Well.

362
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,844
You must have known eventually

363
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:46,186
that your mother and I
might be starting new lives.

364
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,418
We understand. We don't care.

365
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:50,791
It's not easy for her.

366
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:54,195
With you away at St. Paul's now,
she's lost her man of the house.

367
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,890
Franklin Reeve is a good man.

368
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,035
Mom's going to stick you with Chauncey.

369
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,333
What?

370
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,601
We're supposed to say good-bye to him.

371
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:05,609
She can't make you do that.

372
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:07,178
Dad, he's your dog.

373
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:08,371
And I've learned to live without him

374
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,448
so you two kids
could have some consistency.

375
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:12,814
Frank's allergic.

376
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:27,830
Your mother will be here in a half an hour.

377
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,270
Where are we?

378
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:41,278
We had an interesting idea.

379
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:44,540
We?

380
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:45,810
Are you on Playtex?

381
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:48,182
He wants to get credit for his idea.

382
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:49,686
You sure about that?

383
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:54,088
Well, we went out the other night,
after the meeting...

384
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,388
you know, a little extra hours after hours...

385
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:57,894
and I looked around the bar.

386
00:19:57,996 --> 00:19:59,429
We all did.

387
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:00,555
From what I understand,

388
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:04,329
Playtex has an amazing bra,
but it doesn't take you anywhere.

389
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:05,528
Well put.

390
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:07,366
So I was thinking.

391
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:09,667
Women right now
already have a fantasy,

392
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:11,640
and it's not going up the Nile.

393
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:13,643
It's right here in America.

394
00:20:13,745 --> 00:20:16,839
Jackie Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe.

395
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:18,416
Every single woman is one of them.

396
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:19,848
Watch this.

397
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,516
Jackie.

398
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:29,355
Marilyn.

399
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:30,951
Jackie.

400
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,122
Marilyn...

401
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:36,258
Well, Marilyn's really a Joan,
not the other way around.

402
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:46,740
That is an idea
and an impressive presentation.

403
00:20:46,845 --> 00:20:49,939
Well, you always say
it's a 24-hour-a-day job.

404
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:52,209
Apparently, I've already signed off on it.

405
00:20:57,889 --> 00:21:01,290
I don't know if all women
are a Jackie or a Marilyn.

406
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:03,190
Maybe men see them that way.

407
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:05,024
Bras are for men.

408
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:07,894
Women want to see themselves
the way men see them.

409
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,195
You're a Jackie or a Marilyn...

410
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:11,667
a line and a curve.

411
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,237
Nothing goes better together.

412
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:15,033
Which do you think I am?

413
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,607
Gertrude Stein.

414
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,036
I would say you're more classical,

415
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:21,703
Hellenic.

416
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:23,212
Irene Dunne.

417
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:26,409
I love Irene Dunne.

418
00:21:26,518 --> 00:21:28,782
Peggy, you're going
to have company on this.

419
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:30,650
Congratulations, Kinsey.

420
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:33,190
You forced your way onto an account.

421
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:36,361
Mr. Phillips is here.

422
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:38,590
Sorry I'm late.

423
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:40,164
Get back. Out.

424
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:41,960
Who's the new account man?

425
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:44,763
It's Chauncey. Sorry about that.

426
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:48,101
Listen, any idea
when I can schedule Playtex?

427
00:21:48,206 --> 00:21:49,298
We're laying track.

428
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:51,239
I think you can bring
the train in tomorrow.

429
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:52,810
Something new, I hope.

430
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:55,175
Can I drop some crumbs, at least?

431
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,646
Two sides of one woman...

432
00:21:57,749 --> 00:22:00,479
Jackie by day, Marilyn by night.

433
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:02,450
Maybe it's two girls.

434
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:04,419
But definitely two flavors...

435
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:05,717
vanilla and cherry.

436
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,189
Sounds good.

437
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:08,987
Don, your girl says you're free for lunch.

438
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:10,823
She's in charge.

439
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:12,021
Come on, Chauncey.

440
00:22:13,198 --> 00:22:14,324
Come on.

441
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:18,066
Thought you all were listening.
Let's go.

442
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:20,805
Freddie.

443
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:22,373
What, sweetheart?

444
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:28,408
I wish you would have told me
you were going to work Tuesday night.

445
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:29,537
If you have something better,

446
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:30,979
I'll run it by Don.

447
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:32,880
He already likes that.

448
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:34,815
Yes, he does.

449
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,285
Isn't that our goal?

450
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:39,048
I'm not saying I had a better idea,

451
00:22:39,157 --> 00:22:41,148
but now I'm not even a part of it.

452
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:42,817
All I had to do was be in that bar.

453
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:45,726
Believe me,
you didn't want to be in that bar.

454
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:47,264
The work's done.

455
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,857
Now go write me some titillating copy.

456
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:04,481
Mr. Draper is here to see you.

457
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:05,845
Send him in.

458
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:11,184
Are you coming by to pick me up?

459
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:13,052
No.

460
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:16,889
It's just I wasn't really planning
on coming back after lunch.

461
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:19,395
Any way we can have
this conversation now?

462
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:20,897
Conversation?

463
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:23,559
Roger told me it was
just a friendly lunch.

464
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:26,463
I know.

465
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:27,799
People start giving you things.

466
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:29,339
They think it's cute.

467
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:31,500
I've got a crate of that crap somewhere.

468
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:37,071
That's quite a playing field you have there.

469
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:39,173
I don't like anything on it but ashes.

470
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:43,418
I thought maybe your secretary
was better than mine.

471
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:46,047
Nobody's secretary's better than yours.

472
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:48,524
You creative directors.

473
00:23:50,662 --> 00:23:54,325
All I can say is it's been hard
to figure things out around here.

474
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:56,492
Eighteen months in?

475
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:58,364
We can't be that unusual.

476
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:00,961
I'm doing the job you hired me to do.

477
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:03,700
I tell people that Sterling Cooper
is the only place to be.

478
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:06,710
You've been pitching more to me
than you have to clients.

479
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:08,211
What does that mean?

480
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:11,908
It means you've been
selling their ideas to me

481
00:24:12,017 --> 00:24:13,348
more than mine to them.

482
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:20,721
When I was in the Marine Corps,
I missed duty.

483
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:22,623
Fell down the steps or something.

484
00:24:22,727 --> 00:24:27,687
My squad leader covered,
but then I confessed to the men.

485
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:32,498
He laid down some rifle fire for me,
and I acted like I didn't need it.

486
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:34,765
That's not the situation
I want to be in here.

487
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:37,774
So what, you're covering for me?

488
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:39,639
Who am I in this story?

489
00:24:39,744 --> 00:24:41,177
I'm grateful, Don.

490
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,770
If you hadn't brought me in,
where would I be?

491
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:46,180
Some fifth wheel at McCann?

492
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:49,082
Look, I did everything I could
for you on American Airlines.

493
00:24:49,187 --> 00:24:51,121
It was a risk worth taking.

494
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:53,088
People think of us differently.

495
00:24:53,191 --> 00:24:55,056
What do you want me to say?

496
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,559
That we're on the same team?

497
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,253
That I love being in your unit?

498
00:24:58,363 --> 00:25:00,831
Sarge, I'm scared?

499
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:03,765
You have an "I told you so," okay?

500
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:05,894
Can we move forward?

501
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:08,029
I'm the one that looks bad.

502
00:25:08,139 --> 00:25:09,800
It hasn't hurt the company.

503
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:15,971
Yes.

504
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:17,275
Of course we can.

505
00:25:20,252 --> 00:25:22,379
And I will tell Roger we had lunch.

506
00:25:22,487 --> 00:25:24,978
Well. Good, then.

507
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:26,182
Okay.

508
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:45,910
Where did you come from?

509
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:49,637
You don't want to know.

510
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:00,615
Wait.

511
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:04,061
I love it.

512
00:26:04,162 --> 00:26:07,996
I'm warm and I'm cold.

513
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,426
What time is it?

514
00:26:17,876 --> 00:26:19,673
A little after 4.

515
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:22,841
I have to get ready.

516
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:25,880
Where are you going?

517
00:26:25,984 --> 00:26:27,542
My daughter's in a play.

518
00:26:27,652 --> 00:26:30,177
Daughter?

519
00:26:30,288 --> 00:26:31,721
Is that everyone?

520
00:26:33,491 --> 00:26:35,322
She's at Sarah Lawrence.

521
00:26:42,867 --> 00:26:44,391
How much preparation do you need?

522
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,737
You don't want me to go.

523
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:53,671
I took the afternoon off.

524
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:55,143
For me?

525
00:27:01,586 --> 00:27:04,487
You're a lion, aren't you?

526
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:07,715
Now I know what you like.

527
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:11,893
You can go.

528
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:14,488
I know I can.

529
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:19,531
Do you want to stay here?

530
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,435
Watch TV?

531
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:23,700
Go through my things?

532
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:29,271
I would never leave you alone in my place.

533
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:31,474
Yes, you would.

534
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:33,676
Stay.

535
00:27:33,785 --> 00:27:35,047
Relax.

536
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:39,248
Believe me, I'm the same way.

537
00:27:41,726 --> 00:27:44,752
It has to come out somewhere.

538
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:53,164
I'll get you out in time
for dinner, I promise.

539
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:54,738
What's going on?

540
00:27:57,375 --> 00:27:58,467
You here to audition?

541
00:27:58,576 --> 00:28:00,476
No one told me about this.

542
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:03,308
I'm taking pictures.
You can look at the pictures.

543
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:04,973
I didn't know you'd want to come.

544
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:07,415
Is Paul in there?

545
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,248
A lot of guys are in there.

546
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:10,821
You can come in if you want.

547
00:28:10,922 --> 00:28:14,653
No. I'm just surprised
because I have an eye for this.

548
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:16,192
Don't worry about Kinsey.

549
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:18,194
I won't let him put anything together
without you.

550
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:20,698
Who's next?

551
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,270
Hey, girl.

552
00:28:35,613 --> 00:28:37,240
You look lost.

553
00:28:37,348 --> 00:28:38,508
Chauncey.

554
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:39,844
Here he is.

555
00:28:39,951 --> 00:28:41,475
I apologize, Chauncey.

556
00:28:41,586 --> 00:28:43,577
I thought you were a girl.

557
00:28:43,688 --> 00:28:45,121
Beautiful dog.

558
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:46,121
Where have you been hiding him?

559
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:49,125
I made my wife give him back to me.

560
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:50,956
Missed him too much.

561
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:52,529
I like dogs.

562
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:53,892
Dogs are better than wives.

563
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:55,158
Never a problem communicating.

564
00:28:55,266 --> 00:28:58,292
I like having one in the office.

565
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,701
Makes us look more easygoing,

566
00:29:00,805 --> 00:29:03,433
friendly, you know, to clients.

567
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:04,838
Maybe I'll bring one in, too.

568
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:06,706
What breed do you have?

569
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:09,177
I don't have one.

570
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,111
I was going to get one for the office.

571
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,009
I don't think that's a good idea.

572
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:16,053
Good night, Campbell.

573
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:17,280
Come on, Chauncey.

574
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:43,437
What were you doing
in Sterling Cooper?

575
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:45,880
There was a casting call for Playtex.

576
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:47,110
Right.

577
00:29:47,218 --> 00:29:50,949
The fellas are calling it the bra-ditions.

578
00:29:51,055 --> 00:29:52,920
That's funny.

579
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:54,286
You work there?

580
00:29:54,392 --> 00:29:56,087
I do.

581
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:58,594
Want me to find out how it went?

582
00:29:58,696 --> 00:30:01,665
I already know. Not well.

583
00:30:01,766 --> 00:30:04,291
I find that hard to believe.

584
00:30:04,402 --> 00:30:06,370
Well, they fall in love
with a picture of you,

585
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:08,496
and then you come in,
and they're disappointed.

586
00:30:08,606 --> 00:30:12,736
But it doesn't make any sense
because all they need is a picture.

587
00:30:14,345 --> 00:30:16,313
I didn't bring my camera with me,

588
00:30:16,414 --> 00:30:19,076
but I can't imagine it
being better than this.

589
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:23,480
I don't know. Maybe I look tired.

590
00:30:23,588 --> 00:30:26,113
I just flew back from working in London.

591
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:27,953
London?

592
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:32,096
What's your name?

593
00:30:36,234 --> 00:30:37,667
Peter Campbell.

594
00:30:39,103 --> 00:30:41,469
Oh, my. Account executive.

595
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:02,083
I love the taste of Scotch.

596
00:31:07,065 --> 00:31:08,498
Thank you.

597
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,663
Stop. Turn around.

598
00:31:13,771 --> 00:31:14,965
Let me look at you.

599
00:31:19,777 --> 00:31:21,972
When I first saw you,

600
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,672
I thought you were foreign.

601
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:26,306
Really? Is that right?

602
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:29,876
Hold that.

603
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:34,481
I have company.

604
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,198
I'll be right back.

605
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:01,178
Who was that?

606
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:03,311
- My mother.
- Really?

607
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:05,048
What, you didn't think I had a mother?

608
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:07,647
It's okay.

609
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:20,763
Hold on.

610
00:32:28,546 --> 00:32:31,879
Up the long, delirious, burning blue,

611
00:32:31,983 --> 00:32:36,147
I topped the windswept
heights with easy grace

612
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:40,122
where never lark or even eagle flew.

613
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:45,996
And while with silent lifting mind

614
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:48,793
I strode the high untrespassed

615
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,926
sanctity of space,

616
00:32:52,036 --> 00:32:54,163
put out my hand,

617
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:58,368
and touched the face of God.

618
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:46,451
You want me to fix you something?

619
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:49,320
What's that?

620
00:33:49,427 --> 00:33:50,655
Cereal.

621
00:33:50,762 --> 00:33:52,127
No. That.

622
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:55,329
Do you like it?

623
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:57,594
I bought it at the auction.

624
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,897
Can I speak to you a minute?

625
00:34:05,843 --> 00:34:07,174
What? What's wrong?

626
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:08,768
Where are you going in that?

627
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,677
Swimming.

628
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:13,376
You asked me if I like it. I don't.

629
00:34:13,484 --> 00:34:15,008
What are you talking about?

630
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,952
I'm talking about
a 15-year-old lifeguard.

631
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,489
I'm talking about
a bunch of tennis pros,

632
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:22,218
not to mention all those loafing
millionaires taking the summer off.

633
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:24,317
- Do you want to be ogled?
- Oh, Don.

634
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:26,192
Everybody bought one at the auction.

635
00:34:26,297 --> 00:34:28,128
It's desperate.

636
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:33,498
I didn't know that.

637
00:34:35,606 --> 00:34:36,903
I have to go.

638
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:38,339
See you tonight.

639
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:52,051
Joan, there you are.

640
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:54,818
Are you aware that I'm
on the Playtex account?

641
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:55,950
What about it?

642
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:59,496
Please tell the girls
I am to be included in all the memos.

643
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:01,394
Sure. For a moment there,

644
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:04,195
I thought you were just another person
coming to ask me about my brassiere.

645
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:06,270
Why aren't I on the list?

646
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:08,902
I don't know what to tell you.

647
00:35:09,006 --> 00:35:10,871
I'm not involved in that.

648
00:35:10,975 --> 00:35:15,639
There's business going on,
and I'm not invited.

649
00:35:15,746 --> 00:35:17,043
I'm a good drinker.

650
00:35:17,148 --> 00:35:19,173
What are you asking me?

651
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:20,875
You know how this office works.

652
00:35:20,985 --> 00:35:22,577
Parts of it.

653
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:24,553
Forget it.

654
00:35:24,655 --> 00:35:26,850
I've never had your job.

655
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,721
I've never wanted it.

656
00:35:28,826 --> 00:35:30,555
You're in their country.

657
00:35:30,661 --> 00:35:32,424
Learn to speak the language.

658
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:34,361
You don't talk that way.

659
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:36,558
I don't need to.

660
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:39,135
And honestly,

661
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:41,102
you've never listened to a word I've said.

662
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:45,471
You want to be taken seriously?

663
00:35:45,576 --> 00:35:47,635
Stop dressing like a little girl.

664
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:55,076
Jacqueline Kennedy,
Marilyn Monroe.

665
00:35:55,186 --> 00:35:57,086
Women have feelings
about these women

666
00:35:57,188 --> 00:35:58,678
because men do.

667
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:02,452
Because we want both,
they want to be both.

668
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,757
It's about how they want
to be seen by us...

669
00:36:05,863 --> 00:36:07,888
their husbands, their boyfriends,

670
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,398
their friends' husbands.

671
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,060
Here's the idea, very simply.

672
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,138
The bra is called the Harlequin.

673
00:36:14,238 --> 00:36:17,264
In fit and form,
it should be your very best.

674
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:20,242
It comes in black and white.

675
00:36:24,615 --> 00:36:26,412
Jackie, Marilyn.

676
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,576
Same incredible fit,

677
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:30,813
two different women.

678
00:36:30,922 --> 00:36:33,083
And the beauty of it is
it's the same woman,

679
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:34,590
the same model.

680
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:36,159
Look at that. It is.

681
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,285
And even if you don't notice it,

682
00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:39,590
you still get a bit of an "Aha"

683
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:40,891
when you read the copy.

684
00:36:40,998 --> 00:36:42,795
"Nothing fits both sides of a woman

685
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,334
better than Playtex."

686
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:50,666
It's a very impressive idea, Don.

687
00:36:50,775 --> 00:36:51,867
I like the girl.

688
00:36:53,444 --> 00:36:55,241
So will your customers.

689
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:56,870
It's a very flattering mirror.

690
00:36:56,981 --> 00:36:59,449
This definitely moves you
into Maidenform's neighborhood.

691
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:03,687
But sales have been so good

692
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:06,222
when we talk about
how well our brassieres fit.

693
00:37:06,324 --> 00:37:09,589
I don't know what to say.

694
00:37:09,694 --> 00:37:12,390
We were talking in the cab
on the way over.

695
00:37:12,496 --> 00:37:16,523
Let Maidenform have
women's imaginations.

696
00:37:16,634 --> 00:37:18,693
We'll take their money.

697
00:37:20,471 --> 00:37:21,961
I couldn't have said it better myself.

698
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:24,906
Well, I apologize for the goose chase.

699
00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:27,940
We're very sorry.

700
00:37:28,045 --> 00:37:30,673
No one else can have
this campaign, right?

701
00:37:30,781 --> 00:37:32,305
It's yours.

702
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:33,781
We'll keep it on file for you.

703
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:36,747
A pleasure.

704
00:37:36,854 --> 00:37:38,412
- Thanks again.
- Thanks for coming in.

705
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:42,256
That was a waste of inspiration.

706
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,590
These people.

707
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:46,720
Don't worry. It's not your fault.

708
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:48,628
They made up their minds
on the way over.

709
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:50,360
Why put up a fight?

710
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:53,130
I think we bought
a couple years of security.

711
00:37:53,237 --> 00:37:54,727
If they ever decide
they want to go that way,

712
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:56,033
they know we can do it.

713
00:37:58,209 --> 00:38:01,007
Listen, we would love
to show our appreciation

714
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,602
by entertaining
you gentlemen tonight.

715
00:38:02,713 --> 00:38:04,772
And you can put it on our bill.

716
00:38:04,882 --> 00:38:07,248
Make sure Don knows he's invited.

717
00:38:07,351 --> 00:38:08,579
Where should we go?

718
00:38:08,686 --> 00:38:09,675
Surprise us.

719
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:12,722
If we were to take you
to see some girls in their underwear,

720
00:38:12,823 --> 00:38:14,415
would you feel like you're at work?

721
00:38:14,525 --> 00:38:16,254
No. That sounds good.

722
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,351
Well, let us clear the decks.

723
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:19,724
6:30 at the Tom-Tom.

724
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:21,764
That's on 44th and 8th.

725
00:38:21,866 --> 00:38:24,460
We will be there,
and the tab will be open.

726
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,560
I'm going to go tell Campbell.

727
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:28,730
Take care.

728
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:29,806
Good to see you.

729
00:38:29,907 --> 00:38:31,135
- See you there.
- Bye-bye.

730
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,084
Mr. Phillips.

731
00:38:50,194 --> 00:38:52,560
We have artwork
in the evening papers, son,

732
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:53,687
and I don't have them.

733
00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:55,288
Someone's supposed
to put them on my desk,

734
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:56,297
Friday or not.

735
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,594
Should I get some?

736
00:38:57,702 --> 00:38:59,169
What do you think?

737
00:39:00,938 --> 00:39:02,200
I'll be right back.

738
00:40:18,816 --> 00:40:22,684
It's flattering to be able
to keep you interested.

739
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:24,311
Stop talking.

740
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:50,708
Why don't you want me to talk?

741
00:40:50,815 --> 00:40:53,545
You know you want me to.

742
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:55,084
Do I?

743
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:56,813
You do.

744
00:41:10,067 --> 00:41:11,534
Touch me.

745
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:13,262
No.

746
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:23,370
Don't stop torturing me.

747
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:27,417
I want the full Don Draper treatment.

748
00:41:27,518 --> 00:41:28,917
You're spoiling the mood.

749
00:41:29,019 --> 00:41:31,078
I wanted it, and I got it,

750
00:41:31,188 --> 00:41:32,815
and it's better than they said.

751
00:41:34,091 --> 00:41:35,319
What?

752
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:39,786
Have no fear.

753
00:41:39,897 --> 00:41:42,297
You're known as a connoisseur.

754
00:41:43,901 --> 00:41:45,300
You have lots of fans.

755
00:41:45,402 --> 00:41:47,802
Are you talking about me?

756
00:41:47,905 --> 00:41:49,600
I wasn't, no.

757
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:50,901
Well, who was?

758
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:52,202
What?

759
00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:56,746
Who?

760
00:41:57,982 --> 00:42:00,542
Sarah Tierney at Random House.

761
00:42:05,389 --> 00:42:07,414
I don't know who you're talking about.

762
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:09,220
Stop.

763
00:42:10,561 --> 00:42:13,689
This is nobody's maiden voyage here,

764
00:42:13,797 --> 00:42:15,128
handsome.

765
00:42:17,735 --> 00:42:19,669
You have a reputation.

766
00:42:21,071 --> 00:42:22,436
Enjoy it.

767
00:42:30,848 --> 00:42:34,147
Does it make you feel better
to think that I'm like you?

768
00:42:45,095 --> 00:42:47,461
My goodness.

769
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,260
Gloves come off.

770
00:42:57,441 --> 00:42:58,965
I like this.

771
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:01,067
You want to blindfold me?

772
00:43:06,216 --> 00:43:08,184
What are you doing?

773
00:43:08,285 --> 00:43:09,547
Are you going?

774
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:16,123
I told you to stop talking.

775
00:43:27,538 --> 00:43:28,698
Thank you.

776
00:43:52,696 --> 00:43:54,721
People are going to think
you're the mayor.

777
00:44:10,547 --> 00:44:13,107
Hey, look, it's Peggy.

778
00:44:13,217 --> 00:44:14,844
What are you doing here?

779
00:44:14,952 --> 00:44:16,544
I don't know.
I heard we were celebrating.

780
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:17,985
I thought I'd stop by.

781
00:44:18,088 --> 00:44:19,453
Did you now?

782
00:44:19,556 --> 00:44:21,319
- Stay for one drink.
- Okay.

783
00:44:21,425 --> 00:44:24,292
You're staying all night, honey.

784
00:44:24,395 --> 00:44:26,329
Now you got the best seat
in the house.

785
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:28,660
Tell me what you want for Christmas.

786
00:44:35,873 --> 00:44:37,135
Yeah!

787
00:45:33,163 --> 00:45:35,529
What do you want for breakfast?

788
00:45:35,632 --> 00:45:36,929
Grapefruit.

789
00:45:49,179 --> 00:45:50,703
Hey, Daddy.

790
00:45:51,782 --> 00:45:52,771
Hey, you.

791
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:03,525
I'm not going to talk.

792
00:46:03,627 --> 00:46:05,891
I don't want you to cut yourself.

793
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:32,782
Are you okay, Daddy?

794
00:46:35,692 --> 00:46:36,681
You know what, Sally?

795
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:38,887
I think you better leave me alone.

796
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:17,797
