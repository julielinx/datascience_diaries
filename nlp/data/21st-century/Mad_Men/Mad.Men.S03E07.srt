1
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:07,083
Don?

2
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:11,389
What do you think?

3
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:16,201
Now, it may take a moment to get used to.
I told you, men don't like change.

4
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:19,897
Well, it's hard for me to judge
when I can't see a price tag.

5
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:22,474
A modern Chinoiserie breakfront,

6
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:25,567
a Dunbar, Japanese-influenced sofa,

7
00:02:25,678 --> 00:02:29,079
silk Dupioni drapes, Murano vases,

8
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:31,813
and a classic Drexel end table.

9
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:36,220
- And what goes here?
- Where?

10
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:38,915
Right where we're standing.

11
00:02:39,058 --> 00:02:42,994
Well, that's your hearth, darling.
That's the soul of your home.

12
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:46,628
People gather around a fire
even if there isn't one.

13
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,802
- So, Don?
- I think it's fine, Betts.

14
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,972
All you do at work all day
is evaluate objects.

15
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:56,633
I would like the benefit of your eye.

16
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:05,514
Move the end table and the lamp
to the other end of the couch.

17
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,553
I think he's right.

18
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,434
- Hot as hell already.
- Yes, it is.

19
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,802
I watched the sunrise today. Couldn't sleep.

20
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:29,670
- How was it?
- Average.

21
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,372
Ogilvy wrote a book. I got the galleys.

22
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,016
They want a quote or something.

23
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:39,607
Advertising's already up there with lawyers
as the most reviled.

24
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,710
This is not going to help.

25
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:44,679
It'll help him.

26
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:47,350
<i>It's called Confessions of an Ad Man.</i>

27
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,360
- I like the title.
- Please.

28
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:51,760
It's a book everybody writes,
only he got it published.

29
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:54,094
<i>It should be called
1,000 Reasons I'm So Great.</i>

30
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,668
- Is he publishing it himself?
- No, Atheneum.

31
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:59,237
I'll send it over. I don't want you to buy it.

32
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:03,036
I don't know where to put it, and you know
I wouldn't be able to tell you if...

33
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:04,234
There you are.

34
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:05,436
When do you want us
to move the meeting to?

35
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:08,343
- Mr. Draper?
- Move it? I'm 15 minutes late.

36
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:10,342
I told you I don't want them hovering.

37
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,247
If I'm late, send them away
and call them when I get here.

38
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:15,253
Mr. Draper, Conrad Hilton is in your office.

39
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,216
- Right now?
- He just walked right in.

40
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:21,657
- We were waiting and he blew right past us.
- Hold on.

41
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:23,593
Come back in 20 minutes.

42
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:26,460
- Did you offer him coffee?
- I did. He's all set.

43
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:28,431
You look great.

44
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:30,399
- Twenty minutes.
- You can take an hour if you need it.

45
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:32,801
- He wants to look busy.
- Move it.

46
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:40,136
Allison, hold all my calls.

47
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:44,416
Connie. What a great way to start the day.

48
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:49,846
- 9:30? It's practically lunch.
- Well, can I get you something?

49
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:54,957
I've got a personal matter.
It's not fit for the phone.

50
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:05,594
What can I do for you?

51
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:10,233
I don't know what I'm more disturbed by,
the fact that you don't have a Bible,

52
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:12,937
or that there's not a single family photo.

53
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:16,345
- I'm easily distracted.
- You should have those things.

54
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:19,543
They'll make you feel better
about what you do.

55
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:21,620
Start showing up on time.

56
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:26,283
Maybe I'm late because I was spending time
with my family reading the Bible.

57
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:31,128
Are you nervous, Don?
I'm finding you hard to talk to.

58
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:36,099
Well, you caught me by surprise, Connie.
I think you know that.

59
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:46,208
Now, you're a married man,
so you'll have to use your imagination,

60
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:48,239
but

61
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:52,413
I have this involvement.

62
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,253
I can't say it's perfect,
and my needs are being met,

63
00:05:57,557 --> 00:05:59,957
but I have significant needs, Don.

64
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:04,525
- Do you catch my drift?
- Yes.

65
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:09,633
So what do I do
when my eye starts to wander?

66
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:17,542
Don't you have a coterie of trusted advisors,
friends, kings,

67
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:19,873
that might counsel you better?

68
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:26,442
I want you to handle the Waldorf-Astoria,
the New York Hilton and the Statler Hilton.

69
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:31,113
It's just New York,
but my eye has definitely started to wander.

70
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:36,420
I think that's a good start.

71
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:42,995
Retainer, etcetera, that's for lawyers.
Everything else will be like this.

72
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:52,600
Having me in your life
is gonna change things.

73
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:55,613
- I look forward to it.
- They always say that.

74
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:01,312
- A happy bunch.
- If you say so.

75
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:04,288
Young people give us energy.
Don't forget that.

76
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,255
I'll take it from here.

77
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,649
It's not much to start with,

78
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:11,423
but I look forward
to sharing my dreams with you.

79
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:13,158
Speak to you soon.

80
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:29,114
I cannot believe you just had a baby
and you redid your house.

81
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:30,807
Are you suicidal?

82
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:33,883
They were not
supposed to be simultaneous,

83
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:37,581
and the baby wasn't the one
that couldn't keep a schedule.

84
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:39,554
I'm assuming this meeting
means you're interested

85
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:42,025
in replacing Francine as secretary?

86
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,527
- I am.
- Good.

87
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:47,121
Because we waited for you
for our most pressing business.

88
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:49,701
The proposed 3-million-gallon water tank

89
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:52,168
will not only drain
the Pleasantville Road Reservoir,

90
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:56,037
but also blemish the natural
and financial health of our community.

91
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,666
Well said.

92
00:07:57,777 --> 00:08:02,146
The Junior League needs to take over
this effort and explain the issues.

93
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:05,942
<i>Now, first, conservation. The Silent Spring?</i>

94
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:10,246
The majestic beauty
of the Hudson River valley.

95
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:14,486
Second, worthless real estate
on both sides of the river

96
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:18,325
because some industrial park
on Route 9 needs our water.

97
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,898
We need to go over
the Village Board's head,

98
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,766
appeal to the governor.
The Rockefellers own half the land here.

99
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:27,066
Real estate, that's scary.

100
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:33,243
I may know someone
in the governor's office.

101
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:34,970
Who?

102
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,313
His name is Henry.

103
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:40,942
You're gonna have to do better than that.

104
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:42,520
Henry Francis.

105
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:46,686
He's in the paper sometimes,
always right behind Rocky.

106
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:50,091
- What does he do?
- I'm not really sure.

107
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:54,621
- How do you know him?
- I met him at a party for Don's work.

108
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:58,227
Here he is. Oh, my, it just says "Advisor. "

109
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:02,066
Yes, I know who he is.

110
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:06,845
He used to be the Republican Party chair
for Westchester County.

111
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,846
- I know him.
- Well, call him, then.

112
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:14,743
I think we have a better chance
if Betty calls.

113
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,957
It's not adorable to pretend
like you're not adorable.

114
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,386
Call him. He's a big deal.

115
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,660
Miami is where we should start,
let it grow from there.

116
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,135
Ho-Ho wants it everywhere.

117
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:35,230
He just bought land in Seattle.
It's an indoor city.

118
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:37,842
As long as he keeps writing checks.

119
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:39,642
Look, do you want to
kill this thing in one blow

120
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,906
or do you want to
shear the sheep every year?

121
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:43,879
Whatever you want, Don.

122
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:49,311
You made it clear
you don't want to talk about it,

123
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:52,050
but at least tell us how you know him.

124
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,158
We ran into each other at a party.

125
00:09:57,663 --> 00:09:59,153
That'll be all.

126
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:10,804
I know Roger will be the face of this thing,
but I wouldn't mind doing the legwork.

127
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,673
Pete, I think you're supposed to
bring in the account,

128
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:15,269
and I'm supposed to beg to be on it.

129
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:18,210
What happened
with North American Aviation?

130
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:19,443
It's going well.

131
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:22,487
My friend Russ,
who deals with McNamara's office

132
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:23,953
said the orders are through the roof

133
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:27,617
for helicopters, carbines
and especially jets for Vietnam.

134
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:30,127
I think I've convinced North American
they're going to need to spend more

135
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:32,595
if they want to get out of NASA
and into the Pentagon.

136
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:36,629
When they do, we can talk about Hilton.

137
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,601
Understood.

138
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:45,340
Oh, no. Yes, of course.

139
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:47,335
He's busy.

140
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:50,210
It's Wilson 4-8038.

141
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:54,413
Betty Draper. He can call me anytime.

142
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:59,123
It's a civic matter regarding Ossining.
Thank you.

143
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:01,085
Lunch!

144
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,363
Wash your hands, Bobby.

145
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:12,963
Draper residence.

146
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,637
Mrs. Draper, it's Henry Francis.

147
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:17,975
Yes, of course.

148
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:21,103
I appreciate
you getting back to me so quickly.

149
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,474
Stop it.

150
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:26,250
Could you hold just a moment?
I'm going to get on the extension.

151
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:27,614
<i>Of course.</i>

152
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,518
I'm going in the study. Hang up the phone.

153
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:40,592
Damn it!

154
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:44,800
- What is wrong with you?
- You said to hang up the phone.

155
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:46,895
After I pick up the phone.

156
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:48,766
Freeze.

157
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:54,168
Draper residence.

158
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:56,738
It's Henry again. We were disconnected.

159
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:59,010
I'm sorry about that. My son.

160
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:04,785
I know how that goes. How are you?
You must have had your baby by now.

161
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:08,422
Yes, I did. You remembered.

162
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:11,360
<i>- What did you have?
- A little boy.</i>

163
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:14,459
Can you get him registered by November?

164
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:18,366
I just realized, everyone who calls you
must want something.

165
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:20,701
Actually, I've been doing
most of the calling lately.

166
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:24,765
- What can I do for you?
- Well, we were hoping

167
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:28,005
you could stop the destruction
of the Pleasantville Road Reservoir.

168
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:31,049
<i>- Who's we?
- I'm representing the Junior League</i>

169
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,583
of Tarrytown.

170
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:37,582
They want to build a 3-million-gallon
water tank, and it's a very scenic area.

171
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:38,884
<i>I know the area.</i>

172
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:41,687
Well, it's practically
the governor's backyard.

173
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:43,989
That's true, but I grew up there as well.

174
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,257
<i>- Really? Where?
- Mount Salem.</i>

175
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:52,632
I'm heading upstate tomorrow afternoon.
Maybe I could stop by and take a look.

176
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:55,431
Well, tomorrow is Saturday.

177
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:59,474
No, of course. I work every day,
I forget other people don't.

178
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:00,567
No.

179
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:06,078
This is very important to me.
I think I could find the time.

180
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:11,288
- Is Swenson's Bakery still there?
- It is. And it has an air conditioner.

181
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,988
I'll buy you a cup of coffee, and then
we can take a hike to the reservoir.

182
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:19,030
<i>- Is 3:00 too late for you?
- No, it's perfect. I'll make it work.</i>

183
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:22,125
<i>Well, I'll see you then, Mrs. Draper.</i>

184
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:40,448
I can save you the trouble.
It's from him and it's expensive.

185
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:42,448
I'm going to fire her.

186
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:44,819
- What did you promise him?
- Who?

187
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:48,985
You're thick, do you know that?
That present, it's from Duck.

188
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:52,894
- Hermès. Nice.
- I hope yours is a different color.

189
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:57,766
"Elegance and success. Duck. "
I wonder who wrote that for him.

190
00:13:58,237 --> 00:14:00,228
- I don't trust him.
- Why?

191
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:03,199
Because he wants us?

192
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:05,777
- We're very important here.
- Who is?

193
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:10,973
- Did he put you on Hilton?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

194
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:14,575
Stop barging in here
and infecting me with your anxiety.

195
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:17,784
This is really beautiful.

196
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:20,654
He sent me a box of Cuban cigars.

197
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:23,023
Although I'm starting to think
they're not that hard to come by.

198
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:26,689
- Hilton Hotels? Did we get that?
- Do you live in a cave?

199
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,295
Conrad Hilton
came to see Don this morning.

200
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:32,734
- He was right there.
- Really? What was he like?

201
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:36,938
I only got a quick look at him.
He was skinny, like a cowboy.

202
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:40,439
My mother gave me his book. He's Catholic.

203
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:45,238
- It's going to be a huge account.
- Not as big as Lucky Strike.

204
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:47,410
But it would be nice to be playing
a little offense for once

205
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,079
instead of hiding from the FTC.

206
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:52,657
- He has a book?
- I really like this.

207
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,724
Look, I'm keeping this.
Duck said we're not tied together.

208
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:02,564
I'll keep my mouth shut
and you do whatever you want.

209
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:06,236
Do you know why
Duck doesn't work here anymore?

210
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:09,239
Because Don squeezed him out
when the British took over.

211
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:11,502
So what? Don didn't like him.

212
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:15,137
It's the world against Don,
and now it's someone else.

213
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:19,149
True, but Duck
would love to hit Don where it hurts.

214
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:23,045
Well, I'm not going anywhere,
and I'm not going to tell Don.

215
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:26,318
I'm not worried about you.
I'm worried about Duck.

216
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:27,991
Send it back.

217
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:39,433
When were you going to tell us about this?

218
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:43,633
I thought I'd let it be
an incoming phone call,

219
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:46,643
and then wait and see who took credit for it.

220
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,945
This is very exciting.

221
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,243
Despite its modest billings,

222
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:57,549
London is thrilled with Hilton's potential
for international growth.

223
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:00,252
Finally.

224
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,127
Huzzah!

225
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:07,389
If you don't mind my asking,
how did you make this happen?

226
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:09,694
We travel in the same circles.

227
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:13,101
Well, I don't know
if we should celebrate yet.

228
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,605
His lawyers called,
and there's a little matter of the contract.

229
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:21,544
Well, don't be afraid to push back.
I agreed to the New York hotels,

230
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,639
but everything else
should be under our terms.

231
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:29,311
I don't think you understand.
This is regarding your contract.

232
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:31,179
Or lack thereof.

233
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:34,819
It may seem like a formality to you,

234
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:40,024
but to Mr. Hilton it's a necessity that
all the principals in the firm be secured.

235
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:43,766
And honestly, I can't blame him.

236
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:50,775
- I'll give him my word.
- And he'll take it, but his lawyers won't.

237
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:04,318
Obviously, you'll want
your attorney to look it over.

238
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:07,722
That's Ben Michelson. It's fairly standard.

239
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:12,162
Three years, a non-compete clause,
a healthy raise.

240
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:18,665
That's very generous. I'll think about it.

241
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:21,772
I'm confused.

242
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:26,270
If someone handed me that contract,
I'd be filled with glee.

243
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:30,508
A three-year guarantee,
a $5,000 signing bonus? I...

244
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:35,750
- I've never seen that before.
- Well, we want to take care of him.

245
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:41,488
Look, I've gotten to know
Conrad Hilton a little bit.

246
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:44,653
And I think he'll enjoy
something he can't have,

247
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:48,731
and you should tell him
that it matters to me.

248
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:50,461
It matters to him.

249
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:54,833
Still, I don't think anyone told him
that it matters to me.

250
00:17:57,776 --> 00:18:00,267
Well, this is the way it has to be.

251
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:04,008
And not just for Conrad Hilton,
but for Sterling Cooper.

252
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:09,679
I'd like you to take those papers home
for the weekend and think about that.

253
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,588
I'd be happy to.

254
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:29,237
I met him once.
He's a bit of an eccentric, isn't he?

255
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:34,970
Yes.

256
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:50,658
Oh, Jesus.

257
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:16,550
- Mrs. Draper.
- Mr. Francis.

258
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,953
I'm alone. I hope that's okay.

259
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:22,458
Oh, well. Actually,
my friend couldn't get away either.

260
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:29,198
- I appreciate your coming up.
- Please. I love coming back here.

261
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:33,761
- So much changes, so much doesn't.
- Like what? I'm interested.

262
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:36,068
Can I help you?

263
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,201
- Just an iced tea, please.
- That's fine for now.

264
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:50,017
- What was I saying?
- You were talking about coming back here.

265
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:53,725
Ossining has always been
a real mix of people.

266
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:56,289
Well, after living in Manhattan,
it wasn't my first choice,

267
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:58,158
but it's grown on me.

268
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:01,456
I lived in Manhattan when I was married.

269
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:05,697
It's okay for work, but I can't sleep
with all those people on top of me.

270
00:20:05,804 --> 00:20:09,706
Like in a skyscraper. May I have a straw?

271
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:14,879
So, you have your folder.

272
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:20,082
I thought I'd just give you the literature
and a copy of the petition.

273
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:22,915
I don't know that I'm a great spokesman.

274
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:25,546
You don't have to tell me
how beautiful the reservoir is.

275
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:29,093
- I used to do jackknives into it.
- We drink that water.

276
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:35,164
I've looked into this for you,
and I'm afraid it's underway.

277
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:38,628
Oh, no. We're too late.

278
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:42,636
Maybe if you knew somebody
with some clout.

279
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:47,505
I don't even know what you do.

280
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:51,645
I'm a classic strategist, fundraiser,
maybe campaign manager.

281
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:54,946
- I'm waiting on that.
- And how do you become that?

282
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,215
- Give a lot of money?
- No.

283
00:20:58,323 --> 00:21:01,087
No, I'm a lawyer, but I don't use it much.

284
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:07,259
We all have skills we don't use.
I was an anthropology major. Imagine that.

285
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:11,664
- Where?
- Bryn Mawr.

286
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:16,299
Well, you may be
saving your community right now.

287
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:19,276
I'm hungry. Do you mind?

288
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:22,237
- I don't know.
- Fine.

289
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:25,373
You can read from your folder
and watch me eat.

290
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:28,243
I'll have apple pie and...

291
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:31,147
Ice cream or cheddar cheese?

292
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:33,589
One of each.

293
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:38,425
Can we just get one thing out of the way?

294
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:44,426
I don't know what I can do
about the water tank.

295
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,076
Don't give up so easily.

296
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:57,746
What this really is, is a camera obscura.

297
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:00,744
We call it a sun scope.

298
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:04,948
And it allows us to look at the eclipse
without injury to our eyes.

299
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:08,455
- We didn't bring a scissor.
- I have scissors.

300
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:12,189
And squares of cardboard
that already have pinholes in them.

301
00:22:12,297 --> 00:22:16,256
And if you really need some help,
ask your dads.

302
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:21,428
The eclipse is 22 minutes away.
Gentlemen, start your engines.

303
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:26,542
I could have gone golfing.
I had no idea this is what we'd be in for.

304
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:28,909
Go ahead. I'll take Ernie home.

305
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:33,473
You know, Francine taught school
when we were first married.

306
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:37,021
I used to love seeing her
standing in the middle of those little kids

307
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:40,250
like a telephone pole. Hey.

308
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:43,760
There you go.

309
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,332
Sally has a crush on her.

310
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:51,835
Why can't you stare into the eclipse?

311
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:55,566
What's it going to do, really?
I stare at the sun every day.

312
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:59,440
- You stare at the sun every day?
- Well, you know, look at it.

313
00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:05,109
You know, I see her sometimes
when I'm out running in the morning.

314
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:08,243
- You run?
- Yeah, over by the high school track.

315
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,650
- Do you talk?
- No. No, there's an etiquette to it.

316
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:12,746
You keep to yourself.

317
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:17,386
And honestly, that's one of the things
I love about my run, is being alone.

318
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:20,095
That's hard to come by, you know?

319
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:29,703
Listen, I hate to disappoint you,
but I have to be on my way.

320
00:23:31,877 --> 00:23:35,108
- That's too bad.
- I have to be in Albany for dinner.

321
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:36,373
His master's voice.

322
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:38,416
The governor.

323
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:44,253
"His master's voice"? It's an old ad.

324
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:47,951
I know what it is.

325
00:23:58,503 --> 00:24:00,368
- What are you doing?
- It's the eclipse.

326
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:02,303
He made a contraption.

327
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,535
Don't look at it.

328
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:14,684
Are you okay?

329
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,086
I think so. I feel a little dizzy.

330
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:20,852
Take a deep breath.

331
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:26,153
Is that better?

332
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:33,030
So you never had time
to go to the reservoir anyway.

333
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:36,005
I only had an hour, but I figured...

334
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:38,701
That's what you need. A fainting couch.

335
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:41,009
What's that?

336
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:45,648
Victorian ladies would get overwhelmed
from corsets and things.

337
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:48,549
They'd need a place to lie down.

338
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:51,950
- How do you know that?
- I used to move furniture.

339
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:56,585
May I walk you to your car?

340
00:24:58,196 --> 00:25:02,758
- I don't know. This is still a small town.
- No, of course.

341
00:25:04,135 --> 00:25:05,898
- Mrs. Draper.
- Betty.

342
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,130
Henry.

343
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:12,741
So, that's a rain check for the hike.
I'll contact you as soon as I know anything.

344
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:23,643
You doing okay?

345
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:35,261
- You don't want to watch it?
- I will once it gets a little further along.

346
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:39,827
I don't know if you heard me before,
but it only happens once every 10 years.

347
00:25:39,938 --> 00:25:41,929
You don't want to miss it.

348
00:25:43,241 --> 00:25:46,005
- How's your summer going?
- It's good.

349
00:25:46,111 --> 00:25:50,571
- Are you gonna take a vacation?
- I don't think so. I'll get August off,

350
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:54,277
then September I'm back at it.
It's all fairly prescribed.

351
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,780
Have you been here in August?
It's a ghost town.

352
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:02,250
- Where are you going?
- We'll be here.

353
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:06,424
So now I know that.

354
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:10,661
Most just come right out
and ask if I'm going to be around.

355
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:15,606
I was just making conversation.
You can change it if you want to.

356
00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:18,972
You're all the same.
The drinking, the philandering.

357
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,220
They don't know that word.

358
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:33,147
Do you want me to leave you alone?
Just say so.

359
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:39,830
- It's hard because this happens a lot.
- Nothing is happening. We're just talking.

360
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:43,692
Okay.

361
00:26:45,403 --> 00:26:47,735
And where I come from,
schoolteachers, especially, used to say

362
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:50,330
you shouldn't judge a book by its cover.

363
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:53,934
- So you're different, huh?
- Is that impossible?

364
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,780
You're all wearing the same shirt.

365
00:27:05,156 --> 00:27:07,454
So how do people live elsewhere?

366
00:27:09,427 --> 00:27:12,624
They don't have as much.
They don't get as bored.

367
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:17,134
I'm not bored.

368
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:23,330
Miss Farrell. Miss Farrell. I can see it. Look!

369
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:30,711
Let me see it with you. Show me.

370
00:27:58,743 --> 00:28:00,506
Yes, is he in?

371
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:05,548
Tell him it's Peggy Olson regarding Clorox.

372
00:28:06,751 --> 00:28:08,048
Of course.

373
00:28:14,092 --> 00:28:15,684
Hello.

374
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:18,388
Miss Olson, what a pleasant surprise.

375
00:28:18,496 --> 00:28:22,694
I haven't changed my mind,
and I'd appreciate you not sending things.

376
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:26,060
- Things you want to keep?
- I'm sending it back.

377
00:28:26,438 --> 00:28:28,770
And I hope you take that
as a definitive answer.

378
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:30,898
I would if you already sent it.

379
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:34,877
Listen. I've been having meetings
at The Pierre all day, suite 600.

380
00:28:34,979 --> 00:28:38,107
At 4:30, Hermès comes by.
Give it back in person.

381
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:41,617
- Why are you meeting at The Pierre?
- Have you been to Grey?

382
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,780
It's a Penn Station toilet
with Venetian blinds.

383
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:47,447
I can't do that.

384
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:50,187
<i>You can and you will,
then I'll leave you alone.</i>

385
00:28:50,295 --> 00:28:53,196
Suite 600 at 4:30, not the other way around.

386
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:56,861
Please don't contact me again.

387
00:29:06,177 --> 00:29:09,112
- How was your weekend?
- Short.

388
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:15,853
- What did Michelson think of the contract?
- He hasn't gotten back to me.

389
00:29:16,554 --> 00:29:20,650
That's because he didn't get it. I called him.

390
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:25,725
Are you afraid you're going to have a boss?
You will, the client.

391
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:29,556
- It's not that.
- What is the problem?

392
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:31,828
You think you're more dangerous
without a contract?

393
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:34,769
You are, and it's affecting our business.

394
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:35,999
You're our David Ogilvy,

395
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:39,838
and if you let all the blokes at Putnam,
Powell & Lowe relax for three years,

396
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:44,972
maybe we could put your name out front.
After mine. And Cooper, probably.

397
00:29:48,853 --> 00:29:53,449
Well, I'll let you get back to work.
All I need is a letter of intent.

398
00:29:55,493 --> 00:30:00,430
Ben Michelson can rape us later.
Grunt once for "yes. "

399
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:10,370
The problem is, I don't know
if you don't want to do this here

400
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,943
or you don't want to do this at all.

401
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:17,708
Didn't we give you an office?

402
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:22,920
I just need a minute.
I need to send Martinson's to the printer.

403
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:24,352
Come on in.

404
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:36,027
So, do you know
who you're gonna put on Hilton yet?

405
00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:38,691
No.

406
00:30:38,803 --> 00:30:40,600
Well, I don't know
if they want a woman's point of view,

407
00:30:40,705 --> 00:30:42,798
- but I read his book, and...
- Who told you

408
00:30:42,907 --> 00:30:45,569
we were going to land Hilton?
Because we're not.

409
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:48,373
And I resent you bringing work
in here under pretense.

410
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:51,448
- I didn't.
- I didn't need to sign off on this.

411
00:30:51,916 --> 00:30:55,113
I'm sorry if... I was excited.

412
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,581
And I heard there was
an amazing assignment.

413
00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:01,318
And you thought you'd come in here
and ask for it because I never say no.

414
00:31:01,426 --> 00:31:03,257
You say no all the time.

415
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:06,262
What do I have to do for you?
Peggy, tell me.

416
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,892
You were my secretary,

417
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:14,836
and now you have an office and a job
that a lot of full-grown men would kill for.

418
00:31:15,573 --> 00:31:17,973
Every time I turn around,
you've got your hand in my pocket.

419
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:20,601
You want a raise. You want this account.

420
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:23,078
Put your nose down
and pay attention to your work,

421
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:25,206
because there's not one thing
that you've done here

422
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:27,477
that I couldn't live without.

423
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:33,488
I'm sorry, Don.

424
00:31:34,292 --> 00:31:38,422
You're good. Get better.
Stop asking for things.

425
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:44,524
Close the door.

426
00:31:49,974 --> 00:31:51,464
Draper residence.

427
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:54,044
Betty. Roger Sterling. How are you?

428
00:31:54,879 --> 00:31:57,347
<i>- I'm well, thank you.
- Is Don about?</i>

429
00:31:58,116 --> 00:32:00,277
No, he's not home yet. Shall I leave word?

430
00:32:00,385 --> 00:32:03,718
Actually, Betty, if I could be frank,
it's important.

431
00:32:04,355 --> 00:32:06,846
<i>- What's wrong?
- Well, it's a little touchy.</i>

432
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:09,927
I don't want to put you
in a strange position.

433
00:32:12,997 --> 00:32:16,330
- What's wrong, Roger?
- Well, it's about his contract.

434
00:32:17,035 --> 00:32:18,696
What about it?

435
00:32:18,803 --> 00:32:20,600
Look, I know you have to be
on the same page as him,

436
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:24,266
and he's your husband.
But it's a lot of money, Betty.

437
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:32,612
- Three years isn't that long, you know.
- I'm sorry. What do you want?

438
00:32:33,551 --> 00:32:36,748
I want you to see what you can do
to get him to sign it.

439
00:32:36,854 --> 00:32:39,015
I know you're the woman behind the man.

440
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:41,819
Don is going to do
whatever he's going to do.

441
00:32:41,926 --> 00:32:46,090
And honestly, I find it terribly disrespectful
that you would go behind his back.

442
00:32:46,197 --> 00:32:48,961
- Easy, Betty, that's not...
- I have to go.

443
00:32:52,236 --> 00:32:55,899
You missed Hermès.
I was going to give you 10 more minutes.

444
00:32:59,877 --> 00:33:02,368
You came all this way, have a drink.

445
00:33:08,786 --> 00:33:12,017
- What are you having?
- Whatever you're having.

446
00:33:12,757 --> 00:33:15,248
- I'm not having anything.
- A whiskey.

447
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:20,957
- You are Don's girl, aren't you?
- I was raised on whiskey.

448
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:24,632
Sit down.

449
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:28,263
A few minutes of adult conversation,
and we both go home.

450
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:37,475
Grey has Hermès, Macy's,

451
00:33:37,582 --> 00:33:39,880
H.J. Heinz baby food and Revlon.

452
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:43,487
- You need someone in a skirt.
- Everybody does.

453
00:33:44,889 --> 00:33:46,220
Copy chief?

454
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:50,688
Maybe once they get used to you,
but definitely more money.

455
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:54,693
- Would I get to go to Paris for Hermès?
- They come here,

456
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:58,767
but you're not going anywhere
where you are.

457
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,568
- I can't.
- Okay.

458
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:10,044
Just so you know,
that's what opportunity looks like.

459
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:18,212
I'm just sorry
I won't be seeing you every day.

460
00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:22,620
What are you doing?

461
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:28,127
I was just thinking about all the times
I've walked by you and didn't even notice.

462
00:34:31,502 --> 00:34:33,265
How is that possible?

463
00:34:44,549 --> 00:34:46,517
What do you want from me?

464
00:34:48,052 --> 00:34:51,215
I want to take you in that bedroom,
lock the door,

465
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:54,949
take your clothes off with my teeth,
throw you on the bed

466
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:58,085
and give you a go-around
like you've never had.

467
00:35:16,647 --> 00:35:19,616
Bobby, Sally, turn off the TV
and go upstairs.

468
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:28,218
- What's wrong?
- Roger Sterling called.

469
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:34,064
He pretended to be calling for you, and then
he started on me about your contract.

470
00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:37,100
- What?
- Your contract, Don.

471
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:40,427
It was very uncomfortable.

472
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:46,637
- What are you doing?
- What do you think?

473
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:48,644
- I'm calling him.
- Don't.

474
00:35:48,746 --> 00:35:51,044
Betts, don't worry about my job.

475
00:35:51,282 --> 00:35:54,149
Why would I?
I don't know anything about it.

476
00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:57,546
They offered you a contract
and you didn't say a damn thing to me.

477
00:35:57,655 --> 00:36:01,785
I had to hear about it from him.
And why the hell won't you sign it?

478
00:36:04,562 --> 00:36:07,793
It doesn't concern you. You're taken care of.

479
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:09,730
Why won't you sign it?

480
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:11,830
Let me explain something to you
about business,

481
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:15,565
since, as usual, you're turning this
into something about yourself.

482
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:20,508
No contract means I have all the power.
They want me, but they can't have me.

483
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:23,171
You're right.

484
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:26,444
Why would I think
that has anything to do with me?

485
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:30,450
It's three years, Don.

486
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:35,782
What's the matter? You don't know
where you're going to be in three years?

487
00:36:40,665 --> 00:36:41,996
Good night.

488
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:07,954
I love the taste of liquor on your breath.

489
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:25,099
- Where you headed?
- Niagara Falls.

490
00:37:25,209 --> 00:37:27,871
But we'll settle for the nearest motel.

491
00:37:28,312 --> 00:37:29,472
Hop in.

492
00:37:39,957 --> 00:37:41,254
Thank you.

493
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:46,930
- I'm Doug. This is Sandy.
- Nice to meet you.

494
00:37:48,499 --> 00:37:50,967
- How far are we?
- A couple of miles.

495
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:56,497
You wanna know
why we're going to Niagara Falls?

496
00:37:57,041 --> 00:38:00,772
- We're getting married.
- At Niagara Falls. Fancy that.

497
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:05,580
- People keep trying to talk us out of it.
- Why's that?

498
00:38:06,484 --> 00:38:09,351
Well, we don't really
know each other that well.

499
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:12,081
Well, we knew each other
a little bit in high school,

500
00:38:12,189 --> 00:38:14,953
and we're not really in love or anything.

501
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:18,988
I'm sure you have a good reason,
not that it's any of my business.

502
00:38:19,096 --> 00:38:20,495
I'm not knocked up.

503
00:38:20,598 --> 00:38:24,694
They're passing a law that if you're married,
they can't send you to Vietnam.

504
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:28,829
I don't know if you've served, mister.
I don't want to offend you.

505
00:38:29,507 --> 00:38:31,634
Again, none of my business.

506
00:38:31,742 --> 00:38:35,940
It's just I'm 1-A. I'm 22.
I can't get into school.

507
00:38:36,547 --> 00:38:39,675
I kind of have a target on my back,
and for what?

508
00:38:40,117 --> 00:38:43,280
I think they're really
gonna start sending people.

509
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:46,680
I have it on good authority that you're right.

510
00:38:46,891 --> 00:38:49,951
Good authority? Are you a spook?

511
00:38:54,365 --> 00:38:57,129
Nope. I'm in advertising.

512
00:38:59,537 --> 00:39:02,165
No way. Now that's priceless.

513
00:39:02,973 --> 00:39:06,204
- But you seem okay.
- Thank you.

514
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:13,540
It's a beautiful night. It smells good.

515
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:18,220
But everything smells good
when you're high.

516
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:24,292
That's true.

517
00:39:26,997 --> 00:39:28,760
Listen, Cadillac,

518
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:33,299
we don't have gas money, but...

519
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:37,101
Yeah.

520
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:40,439
- They're reds. You ever had them?
- What are they?

521
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,976
Phenobarbital. They're my dad's.

522
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:48,981
Give me one. Make it two.

523
00:40:16,547 --> 00:40:19,880
- Does he know how to dance?
- Who cares?

524
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:29,090
- How old are you?
- Nineteen.

525
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:31,685
How old are you?

526
00:40:37,968 --> 00:40:41,904
- Why can't you go to school?
- Because it's a waste of time, man.

527
00:40:43,207 --> 00:40:46,734
- You like to watch us dance?
- Yeah, you want to watch us?

528
00:41:00,991 --> 00:41:04,358
A hillbilly knocks on the door
of his new neighbor's house.

529
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,623
"Howdy, neighbor," he says.

530
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:10,461
"In honor of you moving into the holler,
I'm gonna throw a party.

531
00:41:10,568 --> 00:41:12,502
"There's gonna be a whole lot of drinking,

532
00:41:12,603 --> 00:41:15,936
"a whole lot of dancing
and a whole lot of screwing. "

533
00:41:17,575 --> 00:41:21,102
"Sounds like fun," the neighbor says.
"What can I bring?"

534
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:25,374
The hillbilly replies,
"You can bring anything you want.

535
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,781
"It's just gonna be you and me. "

536
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:36,626
What are you laughing at, Cadillac?

537
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:48,502
Look at you. Up to your old tricks.

538
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:51,834
You're a bum, you know that?

539
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:55,679
- No, I'm not.
- Conrad Hilton?

540
00:41:56,881 --> 00:41:59,372
You wouldn't expect him
to be taken so easily.

541
00:41:59,483 --> 00:42:02,714
- Shut up.
- You can't be tied down.

542
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,820
- That's right.
- Look at your hands.

543
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:08,651
They're as soft as a woman's.

544
00:42:10,327 --> 00:42:12,818
What do you do? What do you make?

545
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:16,692
You grow bullshit.

546
00:42:36,587 --> 00:42:39,784
- I gave him two.
- How the hell is he still awake?

547
00:43:19,063 --> 00:43:20,758
Everything okay?

548
00:43:20,864 --> 00:43:23,458
I'm worried that housekeeping
is going to come in.

549
00:43:23,567 --> 00:43:26,900
I put out the sign.
I'll call them when we're done.

550
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:33,137
- I don't know.
- Come on. I love the morning.

551
00:43:41,485 --> 00:43:43,885
What were you thinking? It's awful.

552
00:43:45,222 --> 00:43:47,486
- It's an antique.
- We discussed this for months,

553
00:43:47,591 --> 00:43:50,185
and we decided antiques were expected.

554
00:43:50,861 --> 00:43:53,728
Look around!
You have ruined the whole room.

555
00:43:55,399 --> 00:43:59,392
If you want to keep it,
please do not tell people I did this.

556
00:44:07,745 --> 00:44:09,906
- Good morning.
- Fender bender.

557
00:44:12,383 --> 00:44:14,544
I'm going to get coffee. Do you want some?

558
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:16,119
No, thank you.

559
00:44:20,758 --> 00:44:22,783
Good morning, Mr. Draper.

560
00:44:22,893 --> 00:44:26,420
- Fender bender.
- I'm sorry. Mr. Cooper's waiting for you.

561
00:44:27,231 --> 00:44:28,528
Thank you.

562
00:44:31,135 --> 00:44:34,434
- Good morning.
- Sit down.

563
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:39,967
What do you want?

564
00:44:40,577 --> 00:44:45,173
Sacajawea carried a baby on her back
all the way to the Pacific Ocean.

565
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:50,479
And somewhere,
that baby thinks he discovered America.

566
00:44:52,589 --> 00:44:55,854
You, Don, have been standing
on someone's shoulders.

567
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:59,219
We brought you in,
we nurtured you like family,

568
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:02,263
and now's the time to pay us back.

569
00:45:04,501 --> 00:45:07,299
You can't go any further on your own, Don.

570
00:45:15,979 --> 00:45:18,948
Would you say
I know something about you, Don?

571
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,514
I would.

572
00:45:32,362 --> 00:45:33,659
Then sign.

573
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:43,036
After all, when it comes down to it,
who is really signing this contract anyway?

574
00:46:01,892 --> 00:46:05,055
I don't want any more contact
with Roger Sterling.

575
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:19,232
Don?

576
00:46:23,347 --> 00:46:24,712
I signed it.
