00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,657
<i>Previously on
AMC's Mad Men...</i>

2
00:00:03,248 --> 00:00:04,570
Jesus. What a mess.

3
00:00:05,425 --> 00:00:06,554
Part of it it's good, right?

4
00:00:07,026 --> 00:00:08,417
You told me you
told her everything.

5
00:00:08,713 --> 00:00:10,114
You had to know she'd be hurt.

6
00:00:10,489 --> 00:00:12,882
After I told her
I felt relieved.

7
00:00:13,809 --> 00:00:15,690
I know that your
name is not Don Draper.

8
00:00:15,865 --> 00:00:16,506
Get out!

9
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:18,705
Mr. Pryce will be taking off
the last two weeks of August

10
00:00:18,809 --> 00:00:19,785
for his son's visit.

11
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:20,993
So depressing...

12
00:00:21,249 --> 00:00:23,042
I'm this close to
North American Aviation.

13
00:00:23,201 --> 00:00:24,073
Good work.

14
00:00:24,306 --> 00:00:27,315
I'm not sorry, but
I'm married. So are you.

15
00:00:27,738 --> 00:00:28,970
I feel something...

16
00:00:29,121 --> 00:00:30,305
And I know you do.

18
00:01:13,241 --> 00:01:14,742
I need to speak with you.

19
00:01:16,378 --> 00:01:17,912
Away from the neighbors, eh?

20
00:01:17,979 --> 00:01:19,313
Roger.

21
00:01:19,381 --> 00:01:22,650
So... Here we are.

22
00:01:22,718 --> 00:01:25,152
Weeks later, man out of town.

23
00:01:26,421 --> 00:01:27,588
Well, I know you, red.

24
00:01:27,656 --> 00:01:30,091
This is the tenderloin
of your distress.

25
00:01:30,158 --> 00:01:32,026
I'm late.

26
00:01:32,094 --> 00:01:34,829
- What?
- I'm very late.

27
00:01:37,366 --> 00:01:40,901
- Congratulations.
- I thought you should know.

28
00:01:40,969 --> 00:01:43,270
- Me?
- He's been gone
for seven weeks.

29
00:01:43,338 --> 00:01:44,505
It can't be his.

30
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,782
- Are you sure?
- There hasn't been
anyone else.

31
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:56,250
No no, are you sure you're...

32
00:01:56,318 --> 00:01:58,185
You know, are you sure
that's what's going on?

33
00:01:58,253 --> 00:02:00,087
Have you had a rabbit test?

34
00:02:01,757 --> 00:02:03,157
I can't go to my doctor.

35
00:02:03,225 --> 00:02:05,092
Hey, look at me.

36
00:02:06,728 --> 00:02:08,996
You're overreacting.

37
00:02:09,064 --> 00:02:10,698
One step at a time.

38
00:02:10,766 --> 00:02:12,266
Let me take care of this.

39
00:02:13,435 --> 00:02:15,069
I'm really sorry.

40
00:02:15,137 --> 00:02:17,905
These things happen, right?

41
00:02:19,408 --> 00:02:21,308
Will you stop being so upset?

42
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,088
Very well then.
I'll wait on your word.

43
00:02:34,156 --> 00:02:36,357
Buck up.
It's gonna be fine.

44
00:02:39,461 --> 00:02:41,061
<i>Get me an
outside line.</i>

45
00:02:48,503 --> 00:02:51,338
- Francis residence.
- It's me. Has Sally
left for camp yet?

46
00:02:51,406 --> 00:02:53,474
- No.
- Can I speak with her?

47
00:02:53,542 --> 00:02:57,077
You can try.
Sally, come in here.

48
00:02:59,815 --> 00:03:01,348
Your father is on the phone.

49
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,251
Talk to him.

50
00:03:07,622 --> 00:03:09,924
- Hello.
- I missed you
this weekend.

51
00:03:09,991 --> 00:03:12,026
And I have
a big surprise for you.

52
00:03:12,093 --> 00:03:13,093
Can you keep a secret?

53
00:03:14,696 --> 00:03:16,797
Do you think your friends
are going to be jealous

54
00:03:16,865 --> 00:03:18,666
When they find out
that you're going
to see the Beatles

55
00:03:18,733 --> 00:03:20,134
On Sunday at Shea stadium?

56
00:03:20,202 --> 00:03:22,470
- What?
- You heard me.

57
00:03:27,275 --> 00:03:29,009
Hello? Sally?

58
00:03:29,077 --> 00:03:31,111
What's going on?

59
00:03:31,179 --> 00:03:33,981
I'm gonna need her Sunday.
We're going to see
the Beatles.

60
00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:36,383
Oh. My goodness.

61
00:03:36,451 --> 00:03:39,353
- Sally, say thank you.
- Thank you, daddy.

62
00:03:39,421 --> 00:03:41,655
<i>Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.</i>

63
00:03:41,723 --> 00:03:43,457
You can't be mad at me
if I wear earplugs.

64
00:03:43,525 --> 00:03:45,259
I won't.
I promise.

65
00:03:45,327 --> 00:03:47,361
Okay. See you Sunday.

66
00:03:50,031 --> 00:03:52,399
<i>You have a guest
in reception.</i>

67
00:03:52,467 --> 00:03:54,268
I'm on my way.

68
00:04:12,387 --> 00:04:15,389
Oh. Hello.

69
00:04:15,457 --> 00:04:18,158
Lane, you're looking well.

70
00:04:18,226 --> 00:04:21,962
This is... Unexpected.

71
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:24,265
Um, have you brought Nigel?

72
00:04:24,332 --> 00:04:25,432
No, I haven't.

73
00:04:26,768 --> 00:04:28,469
Good morning, lane.

74
00:04:28,537 --> 00:04:30,738
That's quite a reception.

75
00:04:30,805 --> 00:04:34,542
John gibbons,
George Casey, this is
Robert Pryce my father.

76
00:04:34,609 --> 00:04:36,110
- Hello.
- Sir.

77
00:04:37,779 --> 00:04:39,914
- Laura will
show you inside.
- Pleasure to meet you.

78
00:04:41,516 --> 00:04:42,850
I'm here to bring you home.

79
00:04:42,918 --> 00:04:45,119
This was not the arrangement.

80
00:04:45,186 --> 00:04:47,688
Rebecca doesn't
want to see you
unless you're in London.

81
00:04:47,756 --> 00:04:51,292
- But Nigel does.
- I'm here to bring you home.

82
00:04:51,359 --> 00:04:54,261
I'll be at
the Warwick until Friday.
That should be ample time.

83
00:04:54,329 --> 00:04:56,397
Well, there's no reason
to stay then.

84
00:05:00,769 --> 00:05:02,970
I suppose we should
at least dine together.

85
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:06,473
Have you plans
for this evening?

86
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:08,309
I do now.

87
00:05:32,267 --> 00:05:34,702
I guess we're just
a little confused about
what it is we're selling.

88
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:37,037
Senator Murphy
would be appreciative

89
00:05:37,105 --> 00:05:39,707
If voters were
very aware of the hundreds
of millions of dollars

90
00:05:39,774 --> 00:05:41,542
<i>He's brought
to California.</i>

91
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:44,078
North American aviation
is a friend of Anaheim.

92
00:05:44,145 --> 00:05:46,113
Pork is only half of it.

93
00:05:46,181 --> 00:05:48,215
The guidance
and control systems

94
00:05:48,283 --> 00:05:49,450
In the minuteman ii

95
00:05:49,517 --> 00:05:51,418
Have significant
civilian potential.

96
00:05:51,486 --> 00:05:54,555
United, t.W.A., American...
they're gonna want this.

97
00:05:54,623 --> 00:05:56,357
So you never have to say
the word "bomb," right?

98
00:05:57,726 --> 00:05:59,293
That's good.

99
00:05:59,361 --> 00:06:01,595
Gentlemen.
Don't get up.

100
00:06:03,331 --> 00:06:06,100
How would you feel
about avoiding the idea
of defense altogether?

101
00:06:06,167 --> 00:06:08,035
If you think that's best.

102
00:06:08,103 --> 00:06:10,270
We'd prefer something
more comprehensive though...

103
00:06:10,338 --> 00:06:11,805
Defense,
cutting-edge technology

104
00:06:11,873 --> 00:06:13,707
And of course the moon.

105
00:06:13,775 --> 00:06:16,977
We've got a 60% bump
in our advertising budget

106
00:06:17,045 --> 00:06:20,514
- To $4 million.
- I assume this means
television.

107
00:06:20,582 --> 00:06:22,516
We're taking this
very seriously.

108
00:06:22,584 --> 00:06:25,019
And so are we.

109
00:06:25,086 --> 00:06:27,154
<i>We see this
as the beginning
of a new era</i>

110
00:06:27,222 --> 00:06:29,790
In the relationship between
north American aviation

111
00:06:29,858 --> 00:06:31,358
- And sterling Cooper
draper Pryce.
- Uh-huh.

112
00:06:31,426 --> 00:06:34,328
There'll be fewer black bars
as the process moves forward.

113
00:06:34,396 --> 00:06:35,462
Gibby.

114
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:37,031
<i>- Don.
- George.</i>

115
00:06:37,098 --> 00:06:38,599
- Good to see
you both again.
- Likewise.

116
00:06:40,735 --> 00:06:43,637
I should get on a plane
to the coast immediately.

117
00:06:43,705 --> 00:06:45,806
Why? I thought
we were talking about
"meet the press."

118
00:06:45,874 --> 00:06:48,042
I don't see minuteman missiles
breaking up the "hillbillies."

119
00:06:48,109 --> 00:06:51,111
- I have to go anyway.
- Give me those tickets
before you go anywhere.

120
00:06:51,179 --> 00:06:53,647
- Don't worry.
They're coming.
- I'm not worried.

121
00:06:53,715 --> 00:06:55,049
Not in the slightest.

122
00:06:58,753 --> 00:07:01,288
My father has come to visit.

123
00:07:01,356 --> 00:07:03,557
I wonder if you might
join us for dinner
this evening.

124
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:05,192
I may have plans.

125
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,494
I'd consider it
a personal favor.

126
00:07:38,793 --> 00:07:41,862
- So how long is
your visit?
- Too short.

127
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:45,265
So, father,
how have you found
your accommodations?

128
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:46,767
Adequate...
sixth floor.

129
00:07:46,835 --> 00:07:48,102
Father likes a view.

130
00:07:49,971 --> 00:07:51,572
I was quite impressed
with your office.

131
00:07:52,807 --> 00:07:54,842
I think the view's better here.

132
00:07:54,909 --> 00:07:57,277
Hello, gentlemen.
I'm your bunny... Judy.

133
00:07:57,345 --> 00:07:58,879
May I see your key please?

134
00:07:58,947 --> 00:08:00,781
Lane Pryce.

135
00:08:00,849 --> 00:08:03,417
Are you the keyholder
or is this a borrowed key?

136
00:08:03,485 --> 00:08:05,018
I am the keyholder.

137
00:08:05,086 --> 00:08:07,554
May I take your
cocktail order,
Mr. Pryce?

138
00:08:07,622 --> 00:08:09,690
Three whiskey sours would do.

139
00:08:09,758 --> 00:08:13,694
She's asking what you want,
not how many you've had.

140
00:08:13,762 --> 00:08:15,729
I'll have a nice bourbon.

141
00:08:17,565 --> 00:08:18,966
Whiskey sour sounds good.

142
00:08:19,033 --> 00:08:22,002
And, um, Judy,

143
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,637
Could you see

144
00:08:23,705 --> 00:08:25,606
If that lovely creature
could drop by?

145
00:08:27,842 --> 00:08:29,710
Of course.

146
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,384
So what's your line, Robert?

147
00:08:37,452 --> 00:08:39,987
Carrington surgical,
but I retired.

148
00:08:40,054 --> 00:08:41,855
Father was a salesman.

149
00:08:41,923 --> 00:08:43,724
And therefore no stranger

150
00:08:43,792 --> 00:08:45,726
To places such as these.

151
00:08:45,794 --> 00:08:48,862
Oh, hello. How are
you gentlemen this evening?

152
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:50,697
Oh, very good, thank you.

153
00:08:50,765 --> 00:08:54,034
Toni, I'd like
to introduce you to some
special guests of mine...

154
00:08:54,102 --> 00:08:56,670
My father Robert
and my colleague don.

155
00:08:58,439 --> 00:09:00,974
I tried to get us booked
in your section,

156
00:09:01,042 --> 00:09:03,811
But it seems
you're very popular.

157
00:09:03,878 --> 00:09:05,679
Mr. Pryce.

158
00:09:09,384 --> 00:09:11,485
I hope you gentlemen enjoy
your evening with us

159
00:09:11,553 --> 00:09:12,920
And let me know if there's
anything I can do.

160
00:09:12,987 --> 00:09:14,054
We will.

161
00:09:18,793 --> 00:09:20,160
She's the finest waitress.

162
00:09:23,364 --> 00:09:26,200
I'd be partial to anyone
who brings us our drinks.

163
00:09:30,939 --> 00:09:32,406
Hello, may I help you?

164
00:09:32,473 --> 00:09:33,841
Is this the Francis home?

165
00:09:33,908 --> 00:09:35,976
- It is.
- I'm special Agent Norris

166
00:09:36,044 --> 00:09:37,444
And this is
special Agent Landingham

167
00:09:37,512 --> 00:09:39,112
From the department of defense.

168
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,682
- May we come in?
- What is this regarding?

169
00:09:41,749 --> 00:09:44,451
I promise there's
no reason to be alarmed.

170
00:09:57,432 --> 00:10:00,601
I... well, I don't know
what this is regarding,

171
00:10:00,668 --> 00:10:02,402
But I'm sure you'd rather
speak with my husband

172
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:03,937
And he's not home, obviously.

173
00:10:04,005 --> 00:10:05,539
We need to speak with you.

174
00:10:05,607 --> 00:10:08,408
Your ex-husband
Donald draper has requested

175
00:10:08,476 --> 00:10:11,144
Security clearance
regarding business with
the United States government,

176
00:10:11,212 --> 00:10:14,081
And it's our job
to confirm his application.

177
00:10:14,148 --> 00:10:17,451
- Oh.
- It's a routine
background check

178
00:10:17,518 --> 00:10:19,386
So, you see,
there's no reason
to be nervous.

179
00:10:20,722 --> 00:10:22,189
No. Of course.

180
00:10:26,527 --> 00:10:28,428
Do you mind
if I get my cigarettes?

181
00:10:28,496 --> 00:10:29,830
Of course not.

182
00:10:42,243 --> 00:10:43,577
<i>So, Mrs. Francis,</i>

183
00:10:43,645 --> 00:10:45,646
You were married
to Donald draper
for how long?

184
00:10:45,713 --> 00:10:48,548
- 11 years.
- And in general

185
00:10:48,616 --> 00:10:50,450
Would you describe him
as a man of integrity?

186
00:10:50,518 --> 00:10:53,954
We divorced.
We obviously had
differences.

187
00:10:54,022 --> 00:10:56,223
No, of course.
Do you recall

188
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:58,058
Any of the magazines
or newspapers

189
00:10:58,126 --> 00:10:59,760
Mr. Draper read
when you were married?

190
00:10:59,827 --> 00:11:02,529
Anything that
struck you as radical
or subversive in nature?

191
00:11:02,597 --> 00:11:06,600
No. He read,
but mostly for work.

192
00:11:06,668 --> 00:11:08,835
Did he belong
to any clubs
or organizations?

193
00:11:11,005 --> 00:11:12,940
N-n-new York
athletic club.

194
00:11:13,007 --> 00:11:15,042
Would you
describe him as loyal?

195
00:11:15,109 --> 00:11:17,110
Excuse me?

196
00:11:17,178 --> 00:11:19,146
By that we mean
anything that might have

197
00:11:19,213 --> 00:11:22,449
Given you doubts about
Mr. Draper's allegiance
to the United States,

198
00:11:22,517 --> 00:11:24,818
<i>Any possible
ties or sympathies
to the communist party,</i>

199
00:11:24,886 --> 00:11:27,220
<i>- Or the soviet union.
- No, nothing like that.</i>

200
00:11:27,288 --> 00:11:29,156
So do you have
any reason to believe

201
00:11:29,223 --> 00:11:31,692
Mr. Draper isn't
who he says he is?

202
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:33,894
What was that?
I'm sorry.

203
00:11:33,962 --> 00:11:35,696
It's a standard question.

204
00:11:35,763 --> 00:11:37,130
I know it sounds funny.

205
00:11:37,198 --> 00:11:38,932
No.

206
00:11:40,735 --> 00:11:41,969
<i>It's Mrs. Francis.
Are you in?</i>

207
00:11:43,538 --> 00:11:46,073
I'll take it.

208
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,607
And, Megan,
can you check
on those tickets?

209
00:11:47,675 --> 00:11:49,076
<i>Of course.</i>

210
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:53,847
- Hello.
- I just spent 40 minutes

211
00:11:53,915 --> 00:11:56,383
- With two men
from the government.
- What?

212
00:11:56,451 --> 00:11:58,118
Couldn't you have at least
given me some warning?

213
00:11:58,186 --> 00:12:00,020
Betts, I don't know
what you're talking about.

214
00:12:00,088 --> 00:12:02,522
Well, you applied
for some security clearance.

215
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:04,791
They need to know
all about you and I've
been through hell, don.

216
00:12:04,859 --> 00:12:07,661
<i>- I'm sick to my stomach.
- Whoa. Hold on.</i>

217
00:12:07,729 --> 00:12:10,263
What exactly happened?

218
00:12:10,331 --> 00:12:12,532
- What?
- Who were they?

219
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,468
Two men from
the defense department,

220
00:12:14,535 --> 00:12:16,636
And they asked me all kinds
of questions about you.

221
00:12:16,704 --> 00:12:21,308
- About what?
- I don't remember everything.

222
00:12:21,376 --> 00:12:24,244
Your military service,
your politics,

223
00:12:24,312 --> 00:12:26,246
Your loyalty, your name.

224
00:12:26,314 --> 00:12:28,148
And what did you say?

225
00:12:28,216 --> 00:12:30,917
What do you think
I said? Nothing.

226
00:12:35,223 --> 00:12:36,690
<i>Hello?
Are you there?</i>

227
00:12:36,758 --> 00:12:38,458
I'm sorry. I, uh...

228
00:12:39,761 --> 00:12:41,128
Jesus.

229
00:12:42,563 --> 00:12:44,498
I didn't know
anything about this.

230
00:12:44,565 --> 00:12:47,234
I don't even know
if I should be talking
on the phone.

231
00:12:51,172 --> 00:12:54,307
Of course you should.

232
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:55,909
There's no problem
with any of that.

233
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:00,814
You know,
my husband works
for the governor.

234
00:13:00,882 --> 00:13:02,416
You should've told me
they were coming.

235
00:13:02,483 --> 00:13:04,584
You're right.

236
00:13:04,652 --> 00:13:06,987
I'm sorry
for inconveniencing you.

237
00:13:07,055 --> 00:13:10,123
Okay.
Well, goodbye then.

238
00:13:10,191 --> 00:13:12,359
- Betty.
- Yes?

239
00:13:13,694 --> 00:13:15,095
Thank you.

240
00:13:21,569 --> 00:13:23,603
Megan, have I been contacted

241
00:13:23,671 --> 00:13:25,038
By the department of defense?

242
00:13:25,106 --> 00:13:26,706
Yes, of course.

243
00:13:26,774 --> 00:13:29,576
There was a form...
I filled it out,
you signed it.

244
00:13:29,644 --> 00:13:31,645
- What?
- Two weeks ago.

245
00:13:31,712 --> 00:13:34,448
I have it. Did you want
to change something?

246
00:13:34,515 --> 00:13:36,716
- I never looked at it.
- But you signed it.

247
00:13:36,784 --> 00:13:39,686
- Why didn't you
tell me what it was?
- It's standard information.

248
00:13:39,754 --> 00:13:42,489
It's in your
employment records...
just your name,

249
00:13:42,557 --> 00:13:44,524
Social security number,
marital status.

250
00:13:44,592 --> 00:13:47,094
This is very serious, Megan.
I should have been consulted.

251
00:13:47,161 --> 00:13:49,996
We have a contact number.
I'm sure you can change
anything you need to.

252
00:13:50,064 --> 00:13:52,966
Oh God, I'm so embarrassed.

253
00:13:53,034 --> 00:13:54,634
You're right.
You're absolutely right.

254
00:13:54,702 --> 00:13:57,037
If you want to fire me,
I'd understand completely.

255
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,908
Is Mr. Campbell
still at lunch?

256
00:14:01,976 --> 00:14:04,244
- Yes.
- Let me know
the minute he returns.

257
00:14:22,749 --> 00:14:24,183
Bye.

258
00:14:27,087 --> 00:14:29,655
- How did you get in here?
- I paid someone.

259
00:14:31,091 --> 00:14:33,025
Nigel didn't come.
He's not coming.

260
00:14:33,093 --> 00:14:35,027
I'm sorry, baby,

261
00:14:35,095 --> 00:14:36,729
But you can't do
what you're doing

262
00:14:36,797 --> 00:14:38,831
And you can't do
what you did last night.

263
00:14:38,899 --> 00:14:41,200
- You're gonna
cost me my job.
- No, I know.

264
00:14:42,436 --> 00:14:43,870
I apologize.

265
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:50,343
You know that I love you,

266
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:52,178
My chocolate bunny.

267
00:14:53,347 --> 00:14:54,514
Stop it.

268
00:14:55,816 --> 00:14:57,216
I love you too.

269
00:14:57,284 --> 00:14:59,285
I just wanted
father to meet you.

270
00:14:59,353 --> 00:15:02,021
Well, that was
a silly way to do it.

271
00:15:02,089 --> 00:15:04,724
And I don't know why
you're asking for trouble.

272
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:06,993
No. You're in my life.

273
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:10,196
I want him to know
why I'm staying.

274
00:15:11,865 --> 00:15:14,267
Why do you have to be
so damn dashing?

275
00:15:15,636 --> 00:15:17,069
I'll ring you.

276
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:25,111
What kind of man are you?

277
00:15:25,179 --> 00:15:27,313
You've used this woman

278
00:15:27,381 --> 00:15:29,182
And you've ruined her.

279
00:15:29,249 --> 00:15:31,050
Hold on a second.

280
00:15:31,118 --> 00:15:34,787
A man of your age...
only slightly younger
than myself...

281
00:15:34,855 --> 00:15:37,456
That you could behave
with such selfishness,

282
00:15:37,524 --> 00:15:39,158
Such irresponsibility.

283
00:15:39,226 --> 00:15:42,728
We came here
for your discretion,
not your judgment.

284
00:15:42,796 --> 00:15:44,263
I know why you came here.

285
00:15:48,168 --> 00:15:49,969
There's a good man...

286
00:15:50,037 --> 00:15:52,805
He's not in the city.
He has a practice
in Morristown.

287
00:15:52,873 --> 00:15:54,740
It's $400.

288
00:15:54,808 --> 00:15:56,242
Here.

289
00:15:57,711 --> 00:15:59,345
I don't want it
in my handwriting.

290
00:16:03,951 --> 00:16:05,151
Shut the door.

291
00:16:14,328 --> 00:16:17,530
Were you aware
that we applied
for a security clearance

292
00:16:17,598 --> 00:16:18,931
To the department of defense?

293
00:16:20,267 --> 00:16:21,801
Did that go through already?

294
00:16:21,868 --> 00:16:23,169
Pete.

295
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:29,542
They interviewed Betty...

296
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:30,910
G-men.

297
00:16:33,013 --> 00:16:35,348
- Why did you
fill out the form?
- Megan did.

298
00:16:37,317 --> 00:16:39,518
And I signed it
without looking,
because that's what I do.

299
00:16:39,586 --> 00:16:41,520
What did Betty say?
You've been fine this long.

300
00:16:41,588 --> 00:16:45,324
There're three lies
in eight questions here.

301
00:16:45,392 --> 00:16:48,928
If they talk to his family...
he was an engineer.

302
00:16:48,996 --> 00:16:50,396
<i>My age is wrong.</i>

303
00:16:50,464 --> 00:16:53,666
Jesus. I didn't
even think about it.

304
00:16:55,702 --> 00:16:57,336
I remember
you mentioned once...

305
00:16:58,972 --> 00:17:00,973
Don't you have a friend there?

306
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:03,576
And what's he supposed to do?

307
00:17:03,644 --> 00:17:06,312
Stop it. Kill it.
At least find out
how far it's gone.

308
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,047
Calm down.

309
00:17:08,115 --> 00:17:09,615
Let me think.

310
00:17:11,318 --> 00:17:14,620
Look, this isn't your problem.

311
00:17:14,688 --> 00:17:16,489
I just want some warning.

312
00:17:16,556 --> 00:17:19,125
Why? What are
you gonna do?

313
00:17:19,192 --> 00:17:21,761
Whatever I have to.

314
00:17:21,828 --> 00:17:23,529
You can run
the agency without me.

315
00:17:23,597 --> 00:17:26,032
Are you kidding me?

316
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:29,068
I'll look into it...
Immediately, okay?

317
00:17:38,912 --> 00:17:41,080
I hate this.

318
00:17:43,617 --> 00:17:44,917
Not that I would
change anything,

319
00:17:44,985 --> 00:17:46,285
But I hate that it happened.

320
00:17:48,088 --> 00:17:50,089
You know,
not the first part
but this.

321
00:17:50,157 --> 00:17:51,490
I understand.

322
00:17:51,558 --> 00:17:53,326
Don't you feel the same way?

323
00:17:53,393 --> 00:17:54,894
I mean, what if this is a sign?

324
00:17:56,731 --> 00:17:58,799
I haven't stopped
thinking about you.

325
00:17:58,866 --> 00:18:00,734
Maybe I'm in love with you.

326
00:18:04,906 --> 00:18:06,773
So you want to keep it?

327
00:18:06,841 --> 00:18:11,411
No, of course not,
but it's just...

328
00:18:11,479 --> 00:18:13,280
I mean, if there's going
to be something between us,

329
00:18:13,348 --> 00:18:14,982
I don't want it
to start this way...

330
00:18:15,049 --> 00:18:16,817
Do you?
... With a scandal?

331
00:18:16,884 --> 00:18:18,752
I see.

332
00:18:20,088 --> 00:18:22,022
But I guess you could keep it.

333
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:25,025
I mean, when he comes home,
who's gonna know
the difference?

334
00:18:25,093 --> 00:18:28,061
Lots of g.I.S came home
to a little surprise.
No one did the math.

335
00:18:28,129 --> 00:18:30,230
It wouldn't be my child.

336
00:18:30,298 --> 00:18:31,932
Let's make that clear.

337
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,701
I mean if he comes home.

338
00:18:34,769 --> 00:18:36,803
Jesus.

339
00:18:36,871 --> 00:18:40,073
- Greg dying is not
a solution to this.
- Okay okay.

340
00:18:40,141 --> 00:18:41,942
I'm desperate.

341
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:44,011
I'm just trying to think
of what's best for you.

342
00:18:45,446 --> 00:18:47,347
I'm going to take care of it.

343
00:18:47,415 --> 00:18:49,449
Oh. Well...

344
00:18:49,517 --> 00:18:51,218
Whatever you want.

345
00:18:53,221 --> 00:18:55,322
I'll take care
of it, obviously.

346
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:58,625
- When?
- Immediately.

347
00:18:58,693 --> 00:19:00,294
And I don't want you to come.

348
00:19:00,361 --> 00:19:01,895
You sure?

349
00:19:01,963 --> 00:19:03,630
At least let me drive you.

350
00:19:03,698 --> 00:19:05,599
We shouldn't be seen together.

351
00:19:07,802 --> 00:19:09,803
I don't need you to come.

352
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:15,342
Look, I'm sorry
I missed dinner.

353
00:19:18,413 --> 00:19:20,113
It's fine, Henry.
I know that you're working.

354
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:24,418
Don't say it like that.

355
00:19:25,687 --> 00:19:28,355
I'm just tired.
It's late.

356
00:19:43,738 --> 00:19:45,305
I have to tell you something.

357
00:19:48,076 --> 00:19:51,044
Two men came
from the f.B.I. Today.

358
00:19:52,246 --> 00:19:53,447
What?

359
00:19:55,116 --> 00:19:57,617
They interviewed me
for 45 minutes about don.

360
00:19:57,685 --> 00:19:59,252
Why?

361
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,755
Some kind of
security clearance.

362
00:20:03,424 --> 00:20:05,058
Really?

363
00:20:06,728 --> 00:20:09,029
Well, that's what they do.

364
00:20:09,097 --> 00:20:10,797
Is that what
you're upset about?

365
00:20:10,865 --> 00:20:12,466
Please don't
make me feel silly.

366
00:20:12,533 --> 00:20:14,601
I didn't know if I was
allowed to say anything.

367
00:20:14,669 --> 00:20:16,703
You can always tell me.

368
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,675
And if everything goes
as I hope,

369
00:20:21,743 --> 00:20:24,811
One day you may
be talking to those
people on my behalf.

370
00:20:24,879 --> 00:20:27,381
I just wanted you
to know they were here,

371
00:20:27,448 --> 00:20:29,449
Because I don't...

372
00:20:32,186 --> 00:20:34,221
Well, I don't want any secrets.

373
00:20:35,823 --> 00:20:37,090
Okay.

374
00:20:43,998 --> 00:20:45,799
<i>- I've got it.</i>

375
00:20:50,705 --> 00:20:52,539
Take the next one.

376
00:20:58,746 --> 00:21:01,915
- He's looking into it.
- How many people does
he have to talk to?

377
00:21:01,983 --> 00:21:04,718
If you're asking if he knows
how to keep a secret,

378
00:21:04,786 --> 00:21:06,553
He works for
the department of defense.

379
00:21:06,621 --> 00:21:10,323
- But he talks to you?
- It's going to be okay.

380
00:21:10,391 --> 00:21:12,859
I was thinking
about this and I know
it'll be uncomfortable,

381
00:21:12,927 --> 00:21:14,661
But if we have to,
we can ride it out.

382
00:21:14,729 --> 00:21:16,930
- Are you crazy?
- This many years later?

383
00:21:16,998 --> 00:21:18,832
It must be past
the statute of limitations.

384
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,434
<i>It's desertion.</i>

385
00:21:20,501 --> 00:21:22,936
There's no statute
of limitations.

386
00:21:23,004 --> 00:21:26,006
I thought nobody cared
about these things.

387
00:21:26,073 --> 00:21:28,241
What am I supposed to do?

388
00:21:28,309 --> 00:21:30,177
I don't know.

389
00:21:30,244 --> 00:21:31,745
You've been doing it for years.

390
00:21:31,813 --> 00:21:34,080
I don't have to live
with your shit over my head.

391
00:21:38,152 --> 00:21:41,388
You know, I signed
this account after you
disappeared in California.

392
00:21:41,456 --> 00:21:43,390
It's taken three years,
but I've grown it

393
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:45,926
From cocktails to $4 million.

394
00:21:45,993 --> 00:21:47,527
Get rid of it.

395
00:21:54,902 --> 00:21:57,037
Good morning.
Mr. Keller is here.

396
00:21:57,104 --> 00:21:59,172
- Would you like some coffee?
- No, thank you.

397
00:22:01,275 --> 00:22:03,376
I appreciate you seeing me
on such short notice.

398
00:22:03,444 --> 00:22:05,879
Well, you said you couldn't
discuss it over the phone,

399
00:22:05,947 --> 00:22:07,581
So I assume it's serious.

400
00:22:07,648 --> 00:22:08,748
Well...

401
00:22:10,151 --> 00:22:11,985
I'm interested in setting up

402
00:22:12,053 --> 00:22:14,054
Some kind of trust for my kids.

403
00:22:14,121 --> 00:22:16,223
Oh. Well,
starting from when?

404
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:18,091
18 years old?

405
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,293
- 21 years old?
- Now.

406
00:22:22,263 --> 00:22:24,664
And I want it to be
the kind of account
their mother can access.

407
00:22:26,701 --> 00:22:29,135
Don, why would
she need anything?

408
00:22:29,203 --> 00:22:30,770
Look...

409
00:22:30,838 --> 00:22:32,439
If circumstances conspire,

410
00:22:32,507 --> 00:22:34,674
She'll know why.

411
00:22:35,877 --> 00:22:37,010
I don't like this.

412
00:22:37,078 --> 00:22:38,879
I don't like this at all.

413
00:22:38,946 --> 00:22:41,081
An emergency meeting and...
I'll be honest...

414
00:22:41,148 --> 00:22:43,950
You seem very edgy.
What's going on?

415
00:22:44,018 --> 00:22:46,586
Nothing. It just ran
through my mind

416
00:22:46,654 --> 00:22:49,089
That maybe I'm not prepared.

417
00:22:50,658 --> 00:22:52,959
I know this
has been hard on you...

418
00:22:53,027 --> 00:22:55,695
The divorce...
but don't go spinning.

419
00:22:55,763 --> 00:22:58,498
Everybody has bad dreams
every once in a while.

420
00:22:58,566 --> 00:23:01,201
The wound is still fresh.
It'll heal in time.

421
00:23:01,269 --> 00:23:04,738
Just... Tell me
that you'll do that
and I'll sleep better.

422
00:23:06,407 --> 00:23:08,708
Okay, but I'll tell you...

423
00:23:08,776 --> 00:23:11,211
I don't like hearing
that tone in your voice.

424
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:13,013
Don't worry.
I'm fine.

425
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,915
Now please tell me

426
00:23:14,982 --> 00:23:17,851
You're shut upping
that girl out there.

427
00:23:23,768 --> 00:23:25,336
<i>Hillary.</i>

428
00:23:29,374 --> 00:23:30,941
Are you sure
you don't want me
to come in?

429
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:13,617
Are you all right?

430
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:18,188
Yes.

431
00:24:18,256 --> 00:24:20,557
I'm sure I will be in a minute.

432
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:27,197
She's 17 years old.
What do I say to her?

433
00:24:30,168 --> 00:24:33,170
I had her when I was 15
and I don't regret it,

434
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:36,340
But she seems so much younger.

435
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:41,345
She's very beautiful.

436
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:42,980
Thank you.

437
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:45,549
She is.

438
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:51,255
I'm sorry.

439
00:24:52,857 --> 00:24:54,692
There's no one to talk to.

440
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:56,794
I understand.

441
00:24:58,263 --> 00:25:00,397
Thank you for being so sweet.

442
00:25:04,202 --> 00:25:06,136
How old is your daughter?

443
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:09,873
I'm sorry.

444
00:25:09,941 --> 00:25:11,976
I shouldn't pry.

445
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:16,547
15.

446
00:25:25,824 --> 00:25:28,125
<i>Dr. Miller is
here to see you.</i>

447
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:35,099
Send her in.

448
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:42,106
I owe you
a phone call, don't I?

449
00:25:42,173 --> 00:25:44,074
Yes you do.

450
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:46,243
Are you all right?
What happened?

451
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:48,812
I've been snowed under.

452
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,247
I should've called...
I should've called today.

453
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:51,615
I have to cancel.

454
00:25:52,817 --> 00:25:54,318
You look sick.

455
00:25:56,621 --> 00:25:59,456
- You have a fever.
- Yeah, I haven't been
feeling well.

456
00:25:59,524 --> 00:26:02,559
- Let me take you home.
- I'll be fine.

457
00:26:02,627 --> 00:26:05,729
Come on, get your coat.

458
00:26:15,673 --> 00:26:17,241
This pretty young thing,

459
00:26:17,308 --> 00:26:18,642
She didn't know
which way to turn

460
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,044
With my father
on one end of the hall

461
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:21,445
And my Uncle on the other.

462
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:23,747
Should've tried
that move at Gettysburg.

463
00:26:23,815 --> 00:26:26,316
My grandpa fought
in the civil war.

464
00:26:26,384 --> 00:26:29,053
Mmm, really?
Where did he surrender?

465
00:26:30,555 --> 00:26:32,156
He never surrendered.

466
00:26:32,223 --> 00:26:34,291
That man could turn
going to the shitter

467
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:36,060
Into a parade.

468
00:26:37,562 --> 00:26:39,630
- What are you doing?
- I'm getting this.

469
00:26:39,697 --> 00:26:42,766
- Why would you do that?
- Sometimes a fella's gotta
pick up the check.

470
00:26:42,834 --> 00:26:44,568
Since when?

471
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:51,809
You know that
I like you, Roger.

472
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:54,011
Hell, you a genuine character.

473
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:59,550
I'm sorry.

474
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:01,518
That's the long
and the short of it.

475
00:27:01,586 --> 00:27:03,487
What the hell is
that supposed to mean?

476
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:05,355
It's over.

477
00:27:06,891 --> 00:27:08,258
I'm sorry.

478
00:27:08,326 --> 00:27:10,227
Are you kidding me?

479
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:18,068
Are you trying to kill me?

480
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:20,471
Is that your plan?

481
00:27:20,538 --> 00:27:22,639
If you want to put us
through our paces,

482
00:27:22,707 --> 00:27:24,975
We will shake heaven
and earth for you.
You know that.

483
00:27:25,043 --> 00:27:26,743
Just tell me
it's for show beforehand

484
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,812
Because I swear
you're going to kill me.

485
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,849
Roger, it wasn't my decision.

486
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:35,686
Since daddy's...
Incapacitation

487
00:27:35,753 --> 00:27:37,654
The board has been
more aggressive,

488
00:27:37,722 --> 00:27:40,357
And that's never
been my bailiwick.
You know that.

489
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:42,559
But they want
to consolidate everything...

490
00:27:42,627 --> 00:27:44,495
One agency, one rate,

491
00:27:44,562 --> 00:27:47,598
All the ad work,
all the brands.

492
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:50,734
So fine, let's...
you know what?

493
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:53,270
Get draper
in a room with them
where do they want to go?

494
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:55,372
Where do you think?
B.B.D.O.

495
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,441
Do you think you'll
get the kind of attention
you get at sterling Cooper?

496
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,309
Well, you're not
sterling Cooper anymore.

497
00:27:59,377 --> 00:28:01,845
That's right. We're better
and we're devoted to you.

498
00:28:01,913 --> 00:28:04,248
Oh, hell.
I don't want you to think
this is for cause.

499
00:28:04,315 --> 00:28:06,850
There's no reason.
There's nothing you can do,

500
00:28:06,918 --> 00:28:10,120
<i>Nothing you could do.
It's just the way it is.</i>

501
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:13,657
Wait. This is
not happening.

502
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:16,093
You just don't end
business with people

503
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:18,228
After 25 yea...
30 years.

504
00:28:18,296 --> 00:28:20,164
We're family.

505
00:28:20,231 --> 00:28:23,500
I... I invited you
to my daughter's wedding.

506
00:28:23,568 --> 00:28:25,302
I don't know
why you didn't get
the invitation.

507
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,803
You should fire your secretary

508
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:28,372
Is what you should do,
not fire your agency.

509
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:34,978
We're dead.
You know that.

510
00:28:37,315 --> 00:28:40,150
- The question is when?
- We're gonna call for
the files on Monday.

511
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:42,452
No, you can't do that.

512
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,421
I'm begging you...
you can't do that.

513
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:45,822
You've gotta give me some time.

514
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,458
I told you, Roger.
It's done.

515
00:28:48,526 --> 00:28:50,294
You're not gonna win
these fellas over.

516
00:28:50,361 --> 00:28:52,863
- Give me 30 days.
- What's that gonna do?

517
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:56,400
After all the lies
I've told for you,
you owe me that!

518
00:28:59,637 --> 00:29:01,872
I don't owe you squat.

519
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,907
You inherited this account.

520
00:29:05,109 --> 00:29:07,010
30 days.

521
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:09,646
Keep it under your hat.

522
00:29:09,714 --> 00:29:12,216
Give me a chance to get
our affairs in order.

523
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:16,553
I'm begging you.

524
00:29:23,695 --> 00:29:26,330
Okay. I can do that.

525
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,267
Thank you.

526
00:29:44,382 --> 00:29:45,682
No hard feelings.

527
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:23,787
- Excuse me.
Yes?

528
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:25,422
I'm really sorry.

529
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,291
We're looking for the Vernons.

530
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:29,293
I don't know them.

531
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,062
Is this 110 Waverly?

532
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:35,666
- No.
- What I tell you?
Sorry about that.

533
00:30:43,474 --> 00:30:46,176
- Are you all right?
- Don't.

534
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:48,312
I'm gonna
get you a glass
of water. Sit down.

535
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:59,356
Are you all right?

536
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:01,358
I think I'm having
a heart attack.

537
00:31:01,426 --> 00:31:04,227
Are you in pain?
Is it in your chest?

538
00:31:04,295 --> 00:31:06,730
No, but I can't breathe.

539
00:31:13,171 --> 00:31:16,106
Stop it.
Please, don't touch me.

540
00:31:17,842 --> 00:31:20,277
If there's no pain,
you're not having
a heart attack.

541
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:22,946
You're not a real doctor.

542
00:31:23,014 --> 00:31:24,815
My father has
a heart condition.

543
00:31:24,882 --> 00:31:26,416
I've been through this, okay?

544
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:29,653
You should go.

545
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:32,456
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm not leaving
you like this.

546
00:31:57,932 --> 00:31:59,600
- Good evening.
- Good evening, father.
Do come in.

547
00:32:02,437 --> 00:32:04,705
Father, come with me.

548
00:32:04,772 --> 00:32:06,607
I'd like you to meet someone...

549
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:08,208
Properly this time.

550
00:32:08,276 --> 00:32:11,512
Toni Charles, this is
my father Robert Pryce.

551
00:32:11,579 --> 00:32:13,780
- How do you do?
- A pleasure to meet
you again.

552
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:17,351
How are you finding the city?
Are you enjoying yourself?

553
00:32:17,418 --> 00:32:21,054
- I am.
- Very well then.

554
00:32:21,122 --> 00:32:22,956
What do you say
we all head to dinner
and get acquainted?

555
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:25,192
As delightful as that sounds,

556
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,693
I'm afraid
I'm traveling tomorrow.

557
00:32:26,761 --> 00:32:28,695
I'm terribly sorry.

558
00:32:28,763 --> 00:32:31,932
Oh. Well,
that's too bad.

559
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,201
But please, go on ahead.

560
00:32:34,269 --> 00:32:35,802
I don't want
to ruin your evening.

561
00:32:40,074 --> 00:32:42,676
Uh, well, of course...

562
00:32:42,744 --> 00:32:44,611
Toni, why don't you
run along ahead

563
00:32:44,679 --> 00:32:47,014
And I'll join you
in a bit? Don't want
to lose our reservation.

564
00:32:47,081 --> 00:32:50,117
Well, it was
a pleasure to meet you.

565
00:32:50,184 --> 00:32:51,818
Lane said so many
nice things about you.

566
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:53,453
Yes.

567
00:33:04,032 --> 00:33:05,832
I'll be right along, darling.

568
00:33:11,873 --> 00:33:14,608
Come along.
Out with it.

569
00:33:14,676 --> 00:33:16,743
I see your face.

570
00:33:18,446 --> 00:33:21,114
Are you more distraught
that I found someone I love

571
00:33:21,182 --> 00:33:24,017
- Or that she's a Negro?
- You're coming home, lane.

572
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:25,519
I'm afraid I've moved on.

573
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:38,966
- Ah!
- Put your home in order

574
00:33:39,033 --> 00:33:41,568
Either there or here.

575
00:33:41,636 --> 00:33:43,236
You will not live in between.

576
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:49,109
Yes sir.

577
00:33:49,177 --> 00:33:50,944
What was that?

578
00:33:51,012 --> 00:33:52,713
Yes sir.

579
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,615
What was that?

580
00:33:56,751 --> 00:33:58,051
Yes sir.

581
00:34:23,578 --> 00:34:26,013
Darling, what's wrong?

582
00:34:32,253 --> 00:34:33,920
I can't tell you.

583
00:34:35,089 --> 00:34:37,257
Peter, look at me.

584
00:34:39,193 --> 00:34:41,294
Is there something
I should know?

585
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:46,099
Trudy, no.
It's nothing to do
with you. Come here.

586
00:34:56,144 --> 00:34:57,844
You should talk to me.

587
00:34:57,912 --> 00:34:59,446
You'll feel better.

588
00:35:04,786 --> 00:35:07,487
How is it that
some people just
walk through life,

589
00:35:07,555 --> 00:35:10,757
Dragging their lies
with them, destroying
everything they touch?

590
00:35:10,825 --> 00:35:13,326
- Who are
you talking about?
- I loathe it.

591
00:35:13,394 --> 00:35:15,395
No one ever knows...

592
00:35:17,598 --> 00:35:19,766
Except the honest people

593
00:35:19,834 --> 00:35:21,401
Who have to pick up the pieces.

594
00:35:24,472 --> 00:35:26,473
I don't know what
you're talking about

595
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:28,308
And I want to.

596
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:30,043
No, you don't.

597
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:32,813
And I don't want you to.

598
00:35:34,582 --> 00:35:36,483
You can tell me anything.

599
00:35:38,486 --> 00:35:40,554
- Ooh.
- What was that?

600
00:35:40,621 --> 00:35:43,056
Huh. Just a kick.

601
00:35:43,124 --> 00:35:44,458
He's turning over.

602
00:35:44,525 --> 00:35:45,525
Feel.

603
00:35:50,598 --> 00:35:53,934
Just remember
everything's good here.

604
00:36:09,517 --> 00:36:12,052
No, we don't go
to East Hampton anymore.
We go to Southampton.

605
00:36:13,855 --> 00:36:15,489
It's a rental,
but it's a beaut.

606
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:20,060
So listen, it's been
wonderful catching up,

607
00:36:20,128 --> 00:36:22,863
But I have
to admit I'm calling
for Larry, actually.

608
00:36:25,867 --> 00:36:27,400
What?

609
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:29,936
No.

610
00:36:31,639 --> 00:36:33,440
God, I'm so sorry to hear that.

611
00:36:33,508 --> 00:36:36,276
When did that happen?

612
00:36:36,344 --> 00:36:38,812
I mean, when did he go?

613
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,947
I mean, what happened?

614
00:36:48,156 --> 00:36:50,590
Oh, Louise,

615
00:36:50,658 --> 00:36:53,326
I'm... I'm so sorry.

616
00:36:53,394 --> 00:36:56,530
I obviously didn't know.
I must've been out of town.

617
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:07,474
Do you want something
to help you sleep?

618
00:37:07,542 --> 00:37:09,009
I might have a Valium.

619
00:37:09,076 --> 00:37:11,178
Why didn't you
tell me that two hours ago?

620
00:37:11,245 --> 00:37:13,914
I don't know.
I just thought of it.

621
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:15,849
I never take them.

622
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:28,995
Thank you for staying.

623
00:37:31,265 --> 00:37:33,500
I don't know what happened.

624
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:35,669
I think you do.

625
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:38,638
Those men...

626
00:37:40,107 --> 00:37:41,808
Who did you think they were?

627
00:37:41,876 --> 00:37:45,178
I'm so tired.

628
00:37:45,246 --> 00:37:47,514
Please tell me what's wrong.

629
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:50,517
It's me.

630
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,855
I'm tired of running.

631
00:37:56,424 --> 00:37:58,225
Running from what?

632
00:38:04,065 --> 00:38:05,932
In Korea I was wounded,

633
00:38:07,835 --> 00:38:10,503
But this other man was killed
and they mixed us up.

634
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:14,841
And I wanted them to.

635
00:38:20,514 --> 00:38:21,882
And I...

636
00:38:23,317 --> 00:38:25,986
Just kept living...

637
00:38:27,922 --> 00:38:29,522
As him.

638
00:38:31,893 --> 00:38:34,127
Oh my goodness.

639
00:38:34,195 --> 00:38:35,695
Yup.

640
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,001
But now I think that's over.

641
00:38:42,703 --> 00:38:44,371
What happened?

642
00:38:44,438 --> 00:38:47,340
North American aviation
told the government

643
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:48,842
They need to know who I am.

644
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:55,548
What are you gonna do?

645
00:38:55,616 --> 00:38:58,051
There's nothing to do.

646
00:38:58,119 --> 00:39:00,353
Well, can't you get a lawyer?

647
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:03,023
You were a kid.

648
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:06,326
Turn yourself in,
have someone plead
for clemency.

649
00:39:06,394 --> 00:39:09,462
It's not that simple.

650
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:11,998
There are things you can do.

651
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,268
I shouldn't have told you,

652
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,839
But I'm just
so damn tired
of all of it.

653
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:24,311
Hey.

654
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:29,049
I'm glad you told me.

655
00:39:55,864 --> 00:39:58,332
I don't want to talk at
the office and I don't want
to talk over the phone.

656
00:40:15,584 --> 00:40:16,951
Come in.

657
00:40:28,664 --> 00:40:29,897
I spoke to Russ

658
00:40:31,667 --> 00:40:33,134
And you haven't been flagged.

659
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:36,704
And if we end things
with n.A.A.,

660
00:40:36,772 --> 00:40:38,272
The investigation
will stop where it is.

661
00:40:40,709 --> 00:40:42,243
Thank God.

662
00:40:42,311 --> 00:40:45,079
So I walk away from $4 million

663
00:40:45,147 --> 00:40:47,582
And I just keep this
to myself because why?

664
00:40:47,649 --> 00:40:50,318
Because you can't
live in the open?

665
00:40:50,385 --> 00:40:52,753
You don't know any other way.

666
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:58,292
I come here unannounced
and there's another thing
I don't want to know.

667
00:40:59,795 --> 00:41:02,697
Tell n.A.A. We want
Martin Marietta or Hughes.

668
00:41:04,233 --> 00:41:06,200
And what do I tell
the partners?

669
00:41:35,931 --> 00:41:37,632
I called your house
100 times last night.

670
00:41:37,699 --> 00:41:40,568
I'm fine.
Everything went fine.

671
00:41:40,636 --> 00:41:42,637
Should you even be here?
Should you be on your feet?

672
00:41:42,704 --> 00:41:45,273
Roger.

673
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:47,308
Oh God.

674
00:41:47,376 --> 00:41:48,976
I wish I could
hold you right now.

675
00:41:49,044 --> 00:41:51,078
It's okay.

676
00:41:51,146 --> 00:41:52,880
I feel good.

677
00:41:52,948 --> 00:41:55,116
Ah.
I feel awful.

678
00:41:55,183 --> 00:41:57,418
We avoided a tragedy.

679
00:41:57,486 --> 00:41:58,953
What?

680
00:41:59,021 --> 00:42:00,655
Oh. Yeah.

681
00:42:02,524 --> 00:42:03,958
We have a partners meeting.

682
00:42:04,026 --> 00:42:06,093
Oh Christ.

683
00:42:06,161 --> 00:42:07,929
Really?

684
00:42:09,631 --> 00:42:12,166
Come on.
Life goes on.

685
00:42:14,770 --> 00:42:16,604
You're so beautiful.

686
00:42:28,583 --> 00:42:30,718
- Gentlemen.
- Morning.

687
00:42:43,165 --> 00:42:46,100
Let me call to order
a meeting of the partners.

688
00:42:46,168 --> 00:42:49,236
- In attendance...
- get on with it.

689
00:42:49,304 --> 00:42:53,107
I don't know
how to explain it,
but I have some serious news.

690
00:42:55,544 --> 00:42:57,278
North American aviation
is moving on.

691
00:43:00,315 --> 00:43:02,683
What happened?

692
00:43:02,751 --> 00:43:04,652
There was a misunderstanding.

693
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,854
Some names were left
off of a document.

694
00:43:06,922 --> 00:43:09,123
A general was insulted.

695
00:43:09,191 --> 00:43:11,959
I apologized,
but the damage was done.

696
00:43:12,027 --> 00:43:13,961
Well, that's just great.

697
00:43:14,029 --> 00:43:17,999
- What general?
- Unfortunately
this is irreparable

698
00:43:18,066 --> 00:43:19,600
How can that be?

699
00:43:21,903 --> 00:43:24,038
Because I didn't
pay enough attention.

700
00:43:24,106 --> 00:43:26,474
That's your only damn job.

701
00:43:26,541 --> 00:43:29,377
I swear, when I think
what we're trying to do here,

702
00:43:29,444 --> 00:43:32,947
When all you had to do
is hold their hands
and jerk 'em off...

703
00:43:33,015 --> 00:43:34,949
Is that so hard to do,
Campbell?

704
00:43:36,918 --> 00:43:39,387
<i>We have to come in here
and have this catastrophe</i>

705
00:43:39,454 --> 00:43:41,989
Dropped into our lap
because you don't know
what the hell you're doing,

706
00:43:42,057 --> 00:43:43,624
- Because you fucking up!
- Hey!

707
00:43:43,692 --> 00:43:46,861
- Roger.
- That's the business
we're in...

708
00:43:46,928 --> 00:43:48,662
Accounts come in,
accounts go out.

709
00:43:48,730 --> 00:43:52,933
Roger, I think
you should apologize.

710
00:43:56,738 --> 00:43:58,973
I'm sorry.

711
00:44:03,111 --> 00:44:05,212
I have an announcement.

712
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,314
I'm going to be taking
a leave of absence...

713
00:44:07,382 --> 00:44:09,283
Two weeks, perhaps a month,

714
00:44:09,351 --> 00:44:10,918
To return to London
and tend to my family.

715
00:44:12,287 --> 00:44:14,722
I shall be reachable
by telex and telephone.

716
00:44:14,790 --> 00:44:16,757
I can say with full confidence

717
00:44:16,825 --> 00:44:18,793
That the company
is in a state of stability

718
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:20,628
Even with this morning's news.

719
00:44:20,695 --> 00:44:23,197
All matters financial

720
00:44:23,265 --> 00:44:25,499
May be referred
to Mrs. Harris.

721
00:44:27,469 --> 00:44:28,803
Very well then.

722
00:44:40,582 --> 00:44:42,616
I'm sorry.

723
00:44:42,684 --> 00:44:44,885
Is there more business?

724
00:44:47,689 --> 00:44:50,491
Shall we go down
the current status
of accounts?

725
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:53,794
Lucky strike?

726
00:44:53,862 --> 00:44:56,130
Vick chemical?

727
00:44:56,198 --> 00:44:57,765
Send her in.

728
00:45:03,738 --> 00:45:06,507
- How are you?
- I didn't expect you
to stop by.

729
00:45:06,575 --> 00:45:08,676
Stop it.
I've been worried.

730
00:45:10,912 --> 00:45:13,714
I'm fine.
Everything's fine.

731
00:45:16,551 --> 00:45:17,885
Let's get something to eat.

732
00:45:19,754 --> 00:45:22,823
I think I'd better be
on my own tonight.

733
00:45:22,891 --> 00:45:24,925
Why don't we see
each other tomorrow?

734
00:45:24,993 --> 00:45:26,894
Okay.

735
00:45:30,232 --> 00:45:33,400
We'll figure out
what to do.
I promise.

736
00:45:35,003 --> 00:45:36,103
We'll see.

737
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:39,807
<i>- Mr. Draper?</i>

738
00:45:44,579 --> 00:45:46,113
- Saturday night?
- Yes.

739
00:45:48,984 --> 00:45:51,118
Very good then.
You can call me
with the details.

740
00:45:51,186 --> 00:45:52,453
Good night.

741
00:45:52,521 --> 00:45:54,021
<i>Good night.</i>

742
00:45:56,625 --> 00:45:58,759
I know I messed
so many things up

743
00:45:58,827 --> 00:46:02,062
And I... well,
I got Mr. Crane
to get these sent over.

744
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:03,631
It's the Beatles tickets.

745
00:46:03,698 --> 00:46:05,633
- I thought you'd
want them right away.
- Yes.

746
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:07,067
Thank you.

747
00:46:07,135 --> 00:46:09,370
You see?
Everything worked out.

748
00:46:09,437 --> 00:46:11,672
Yes.

749
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:14,041
- Thank you.
- I hope it's okay,

750
00:46:14,109 --> 00:46:17,011
But it's almost 8:00.
Do you need me?

751
00:46:17,078 --> 00:46:18,679
No.
You can go.

752
00:46:18,747 --> 00:46:20,447
Thank you.
