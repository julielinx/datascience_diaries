1
00:00:40,573 --> 00:00:42,973
- Butter.
- And the apples are good now,

2
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:44,373
but not from the market.

3
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:47,674
I can go to Rodney Farms on Sunday.
It's near church.

4
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:50,477
- Can't we go to Rodney Farms?
- We'll see.

5
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:54,951
- Why don't we go to church?
- We go to church.

6
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:57,815
On Christmas. Carla goes every Sunday.

7
00:00:59,592 --> 00:01:01,856
We don't need to go every week.

8
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:03,962
Anything else?

9
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:08,958
- It's early. Do you want a drink?
- Yes.

10
00:01:11,337 --> 00:01:13,464
- How was school today?
- Good.

11
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:16,598
How come you never ask me?

12
00:01:16,876 --> 00:01:21,870
I do. It's just your answer is always longer,
so I thought I would start with Sally.

13
00:01:22,615 --> 00:01:24,207
When's Halloween?

14
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:27,985
Before Thanksgiving.
Francine and Carlton have invited us,

15
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:31,524
but I think if we're going to be
selling Daddy's house,

16
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:35,424
I don't know, it might be nice
to have it there one last time.

17
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:41,289
Are you going to sleep here tonight?

18
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:42,924
No.

19
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,828
You're working too much.

20
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:49,898
- Betts, I don't have a choice.
- No, that's not what I mean. I just...

21
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:52,204
I see how hard you're working.

22
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:01,179
Hello.

23
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:04,349
Inside.

24
00:02:10,096 --> 00:02:12,997
- Were you grading papers?
- Why?

25
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:22,306
I don't know if you're hungry,
but I made date nut bread.

26
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:24,808
Actually, I made three. Bake sale.

27
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:32,114
Your service called.
Mr. Hilton was looking for you,

28
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:35,080
but he's probably in the air right now.

29
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:39,692
Thanks, Miss Farrell. That's good to know.

30
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,293
I thought so.

31
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:48,390
I want you to spend the whole night.

32
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,656
You couldn't possibly be asleep already.

33
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:25,427
This eight-year-old, Charlie,

34
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:29,571
looked up at me during art today and said,

35
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:35,170
"How do I know if what I see as blue
is the same as it is to you?"

36
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:41,244
What did you say?

37
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:44,446
The truth. I don't know.

38
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:47,759
I never have,

39
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:51,791
but I love that he made me
think about that again.

40
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:56,569
What would you have said?

41
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,430
I would have told Charlie

42
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:03,904
that my job is about

43
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:08,047
boiling down communication
to its essentials,

44
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:12,245
and that I know that there is a blue

45
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:17,019
that at least 45% of the population
sees as the same.

46
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:21,983
Maybe half those people think
they're looking at yellow.

47
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:26,894
Maybe, but the truth is,
people may see things differently,

48
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:30,763
but they don't really want to.

49
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:35,906
Do you feel bad about what you do?

50
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:40,973
Nobody feels as good about what they do
as you do.

51
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:45,516
That's sweet.

52
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:51,856
I wish I could've known you at eight.
I bet you were serious.

53
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:57,196
And I would've liked you.

54
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,725
Long curly hair.

55
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,302
No one has it anymore.

56
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:24,755
- Why don't you take her?
- Because I said no.

57
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:28,893
- You'd rather not go than go with me?
- What do you think Mr. Draper would say

58
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:32,761
if you showed up at the Sterling Cooper
40th with his secretary?

59
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:34,059
Good morning, Mr. Draper.

60
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,691
- Coffee?
- Morning, Don.

61
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:37,565
Morning, fellas. Yes.

62
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,328
- Aqua Net, 9:00.
- Get Peggy.

63
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,931
Don, if you could stand over there.

64
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:45,544
It's Paul Kinsey theater.

65
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:50,978
This was my thought.

66
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:54,315
Aqua Net is about hold,
but it's also about beauty.

67
00:05:56,522 --> 00:06:00,515
So, we're driving. Two couples.
I call it "Double Date. "

68
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:05,455
The woman in the back's scarf blows off
and her hair starts blowing.

69
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:08,363
- Her hairdo falls apart.
- Oh, no!

70
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:10,794
And then the woman in front
takes off her scarf

71
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:13,098
and hands it back to the woman in the back.

72
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:16,334
- Take mine.
- And he says, "Are you sure, Marcia?"

73
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:19,044
Marcia's hair is perfect.

74
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:23,645
And then her date gives her
a knowing smile of admiration

75
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,615
on her confident smile.

76
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:28,853
"Aqua Net. Arrive in style. "

77
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,390
Too much story.
Every time I hear, "And then,"

78
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:38,362
there's another chance
for the ladies at home to misunderstand.

79
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:42,367
What if it's just the two couples,
the wind is blowing,

80
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:44,593
the woman in the back
has to put on her kerchief

81
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:48,105
and she just looks longingly
at Miss Perfect in front?

82
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:51,068
- Okay.
- "Arrive in style" still works.

83
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:54,779
And at the end,
you could see the can with a kerchief,

84
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:56,348
like a see-through one over it

85
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:59,509
and the wind blows it off
to reveal the Aqua Net.

86
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:01,348
A kerchief in a can?

87
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:04,684
Don't use that, but very nice.

88
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,550
Well, great, then.

89
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:12,457
- What do you have for Western Union?
- We don't meet until next week.

90
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:14,392
Hilton takes precedence,

91
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,559
so I need you two to be ready for me
at a moment's notice.

92
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:19,194
And it has to be TV
to compete with the phone company.

93
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:22,365
I love getting telegrams,
but I never send them.

94
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:26,071
How is that supposed to help?

95
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,646
I've got it.

96
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:35,047
My goodness. This is where everyone is.

97
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:38,250
Allison, my dear, do you mind?

98
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,421
All the paperwork is through
on your contract.

99
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:47,192
It is my pleasure
to deliver your signing bonus personally.

100
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,500
You see, I don't just fire people.

101
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:54,262
So we finally have an answer
to the question,

102
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:59,003
"What makes Don Draper smile?"
$5,000 seems to be the number.

103
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:02,570
I don't know why it took two months.

104
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:06,080
<i>Will your amigo Connie Hilton
be attending the anniversary party Friday?</i>

105
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:08,676
- In his dressiest Stetson.
- Splendid.

106
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:13,252
You will be speaking last.
It's prime time. Please prepare.

107
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:17,625
I'm sorry to interrupt.
Mr. Pryce, your wife is here

108
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,698
and has requested
your attention immediately.

109
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:21,528
- Where?
- Your office.

110
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:26,061
- What's going on?
- I'll find out.

111
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,639
No, it's okay.

112
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:35,539
<i>- Mr. Kinsey to see you.
- What was that?</i>

113
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:37,873
Thank you, Olive. What?

114
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:41,078
I don't need you to put your little swirl
on top of my idea.

115
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,382
- No one's keeping score.
- I am.

116
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:45,816
And every time we work together,
it looks like you carried the load

117
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:47,825
because you're spontaneous,
and you're a girl,

118
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:50,327
and you're his favorite
and you use Aqua Net.

119
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:52,897
- Are you nuts? He hates me.
- That's rich.

120
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:56,093
Wearing a dress isn't gonna help you
with Western Union.

121
00:08:56,202 --> 00:09:00,229
You do your work. I'll do mine.
Let the chips fall where they may.

122
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:05,834
Mrs. Pryce, your water.

123
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:10,673
- Thank you ever so much, John.
- Will there be anything else?

124
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:22,523
- He's such a toad.
- He is. He is. Darling, please, sit down.

125
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:26,223
No. I'm not going to let you force me
to do anything anymore.

126
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:28,527
Am I to entertain
your ballad of dissatisfaction,

127
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:32,502
or has something actually happened?
Because I am at work, dear.

128
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:38,376
I'm so sorry.

129
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,971
I went to pick up my gown.

130
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:47,515
The queue for the taxi was 10 long
with those fat ladies in their furs.

131
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:50,713
Finally I think I'm en route,
but I see the park,

132
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:52,347
and I insist it's the wrong direction,

133
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:55,154
and he's obviously running up my fare,
which he was.

134
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,456
- I'm so sorry, darling.
- I had to stop here

135
00:09:57,563 --> 00:10:00,191
because I'd already taken
a $2.25 tour of Harlem

136
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:04,326
- and that was all the money I had.
- We'll get you home right away.

137
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:07,371
Do you have enough cash
to get me to London?

138
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:09,566
Because this is not my home.

139
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:13,069
- These things take time.
- Not for you.

140
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:18,079
If a superior demands that you be happy,
you say, "Yes, sir. Right away, sir. "

141
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:20,652
Go on. Let's have it all, shall we?

142
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:22,946
You like it here.

143
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:27,055
The smells and the noise
and the criminals at every level.

144
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,621
I have made the best of this.

145
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:32,490
My salary is good.
The company is flourishing.

146
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:34,759
My wife has a beautiful gown.

147
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:37,301
May I see it?

148
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,863
It's not London.

149
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:43,898
- It's not even England.
- That's true.

150
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,245
I've been here 10 months
and no one's ever asked me

151
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:49,211
where I went to school.

152
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:55,585
- I want to scream.
- Don't.

153
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,453
Roll over.

154
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:10,963
- Just a minute!
- Why did you answer?

155
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,972
I had to see you.

156
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:25,875
I called you from the bus station
in New Haven

157
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:28,545
before I started hitching.
You never answered.

158
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:31,851
I'm so sorry. Can you give me a minute?

159
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:41,798
- It's my brother.
- Get rid of him for 15 minutes. I'll run out.

160
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:44,700
No, it's okay, Don. Come outside.

161
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:48,904
No. So there's a man in here.
He doesn't need to know it's me.

162
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:52,374
I want you to meet him.

163
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:55,303
I don't want to ruin this.

164
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:58,446
It's okay.

165
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:01,082
I promise.

166
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:19,468
Danny, I'd like you to meet my friend Don.

167
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:23,400
- Sorry to interrupt.
- Danny, be polite.

168
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:25,570
I really am sorry.

169
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:30,211
- What happened there?
- Is it bad under there? Are you hungry?

170
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,780
- No.
- Well, I should be going.

171
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:41,282
Listen, I know what it looks like,
but I'm not a junkie.

172
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:48,266
Although apparently I'm too dangerous
to push a cart in a public library.

173
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:53,133
- He has fits.
- I'm sorry.

174
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:56,307
I interrupted you. It's a nice night.

175
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:59,309
- I'll see you in the morning, Suzy.
- Stop it.

176
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:06,351
- I wish you the best.
- You don't even know me.

177
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:15,921
- I'll call you.
- Tomorrow.

178
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:31,505
He could've just stayed
inside your bedroom.

179
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:35,842
I wanted you two to meet.
You're my baby brother.

180
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:41,318
Well, he knows how to leave a room.
Reminds me of Mom.

181
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:47,089
- He's just very private.
- He's arrogant. His plans were interrupted.

182
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:48,888
You don't know him.

183
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:56,560
I'm going to get you another job.
Someplace safe.

184
00:13:57,603 --> 00:13:58,661
Safe.

185
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:03,333
Other people are the problem.
Name such a place.

186
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:05,838
People are ignorant.

187
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:10,005
They're scared of things
they don't understand.

188
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:19,250
I'm really hungry.

189
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:25,889
1923. We were giddy.

190
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:29,935
We didn't know the soup
was gonna hit the fan,

191
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:33,662
- but we made it through.
- All these guys are dead.

192
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:37,272
Except you, of course.

193
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:43,514
And Doug Thompson, but I wish he were.
He let me eat a whole roll of Bolls Laxatives.

194
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:47,608
I thought they were candies.
I want him to show up and keel over.

195
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,680
Damn it.
I don't want to go to another funeral.

196
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:53,849
Well, I'm not really gonna kill him.
I just would like to, that's all.

197
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:57,554
Fortieth anniversary.
Forty would be an insignificant year

198
00:14:57,663 --> 00:15:01,326
were it not the average lifespan
of a man in this business.

199
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:06,262
I don't think it's a bad idea to have a chance
to out-drink your clientele.

200
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,000
Who am I kidding?
I don't want to go either.

201
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:14,705
Have to watch Don Draper
accept an award for his humanity?

202
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,906
- Don is important.
- You know, I found that guy

203
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:21,251
working in a fur company, night school.

204
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:24,551
And that girl, Betty.

205
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:29,218
I remember Mona said they looked like
they were on top of our wedding cake.

206
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:34,291
- Screw him.
- Have the party without me. I can't do it.

207
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:37,462
I won't.

208
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:40,636
Okay. Okay.

209
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:45,000
It's just a party. If you don't want to go,
you don't have to go.

210
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:48,079
It's not like
it's our company anymore anyway.

211
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,779
My God. Remember her?

212
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:59,721
<i>It's 100,000 bucks...</i>

213
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:04,320
- Can I?
- If you do it right.

214
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:12,236
Hello, Draper residence.

215
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:16,033
Hello?

216
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:20,169
There's nobody there. They hanged up.

217
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:22,744
Hang it up.

218
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,218
Why'd they hang up?

219
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,084
Probably a wrong number.
People do it all the time.

220
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,556
But I could hear somebody
and they heard me.

221
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:37,789
My goodness, Sally Draper,
try not to take everything so personally.

222
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:42,031
Jeez Louise.

223
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:08,884
The phone is cheap.
It's everyday, and you can't trust it.

224
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:17,792
The telegraph is honest and solid and clear.
It's old, but it's good.

225
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:21,470
Traditional.

226
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,311
Sorry about that, Olive.

227
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,346
Peggy.

228
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:47,853
- Peggy!
- Hello?

229
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:59,495
- Did you see a girl come through here?
- No, sir.

230
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:04,034
- I'm Paul, by the way.
- I'm Achilles.

231
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:07,370
Achilles. Well, hello, Achilles.

232
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:11,348
- Are you okay?
- Are you Greek?

233
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:15,182
- I'm an American citizen.
- No, of course.

234
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:18,512
It's just, that's a mighty big name.

235
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:24,524
- How did that happen?
- Well, it's been in my family for generations.

236
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:28,223
When we have a party
and someone says, "Achilles,"

237
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,494
all the men turn their heads.

238
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,967
- In fact, one Christmas...
- Hush.

239
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:39,842
I've got it.

240
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:42,204
You've got what?

241
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:46,106
Achilles, I have thought of something
very, very good.

242
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:50,449
- Glad to hear it.
- It's truly great news.

243
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:53,384
- Yeah, your whole face changed.
- Did it?

244
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:59,557
Well, I think I shall sleep
very soundly tonight. I wish you the same.

245
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:37,902
Is that taken?

246
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,263
Hey.

247
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:48,345
I'll only stay for a stop.
I tried to catch you on the platform.

248
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,911
- What are you doing here?
- I needed to talk to you.

249
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:03,025
Did you call my house last night?

250
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:06,027
No, I didn't.

251
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,963
- This was a mistake.
- Sit down.

252
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:15,169
I'm sorry.

253
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,715
You said you'd call me.

254
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,051
Your brother is there.

255
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:36,257
I don't care about your marriage
or your work or any of that,

256
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:39,328
as long as I know you're with me.

257
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:50,538
I'm sorry.

258
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,541
I got him a job
at the VA Hospital in Bedford.

259
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:04,816
He'll be pushing a broom,
but it has nice grounds.

260
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:11,792
You can come by tonight. He'll be gone.

261
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,197
- Are you sure?
- Stop it.

262
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:18,835
Scarborough! Briarcliff Manor!

263
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:23,468
Scarborough! Briarcliff Manor!

264
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,782
It was nice meeting you.

265
00:22:53,905 --> 00:22:55,236
Mr. Kinsey.

266
00:22:57,309 --> 00:22:58,367
Paul!

267
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:02,344
Sorry to wake you. It's 9:00 a. m.

268
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:07,251
- Good morning, Lois.
- Good morning.

269
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:12,813
I need you to type something for me.

270
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:27,531
- Were you in here before?
- No.

271
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:30,608
- So you haven't touched anything?
- No.

272
00:23:31,676 --> 00:23:33,507
You do that sometimes.

273
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:42,780
- What was it?
- Does it look like I know?

274
00:23:43,622 --> 00:23:45,180
I wrote it down.

275
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:47,989
I know I wrote it down.

276
00:23:49,394 --> 00:23:53,592
Did you find it?
It's always the last place you look.

277
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:59,362
My mother always said
to retrace your steps if you lost something.

278
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:01,564
Good God, would you shut up?

279
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:07,704
"In conclusion,
with the help of Sterling Cooper,

280
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:10,975
"its ingenuity and influence,

281
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:15,177
"America is teaching business
to the world. "

282
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:20,617
Very rousing, sir.

283
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,351
Churchill rousing or Hitler rousing?

284
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:32,130
Mr. Pryce's office.

285
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:35,236
Just a moment, please.

286
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:38,309
London calling. Mr. Ford.

287
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:44,304
- Harold.
- Just calling for a status report

288
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:45,906
on our little party.

289
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:50,044
All is well, although as of late,
Bert Cooper will be in absentia.

290
00:24:50,188 --> 00:24:51,485
Well, that won't do.

291
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:54,889
We're flying across the pond.
We expect all the flowers in the vase.

292
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:57,958
<i>- What does that mean?
- Look, Lane,</i>

293
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:00,562
we've had interest in the company
for some months

294
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:03,225
and this party is essential
to attracting a second suitor.

295
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:05,028
For what purpose?

296
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:09,030
Did we reach you at a bad time?
You seem foggy.

297
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:14,469
- Saint John here.
- Hello.

298
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:17,640
Lane, Sterling Cooper is for sale.

299
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,344
But why?

300
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:24,178
We've reduced the staff
and increased the revenue by 22%.

301
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:30,219
I think you've answered your own question.
We need this party to encourage interest.

302
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:34,031
- Do your best, lad.
- Yes, of course.

303
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:44,638
- Are you quite all right, sir?
- Yes. That'll be all.

304
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:03,388
Henry Francis, please. It's Betty Draper.

305
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,974
How are you? What a nice surprise.

306
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:21,836
I was wondering
if you called my home last night.

307
00:26:22,547 --> 00:26:24,742
No. No, I didn't.

308
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:29,481
Well, we had a hang-up.
I thought it might be you.

309
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:32,381
Really?

310
00:26:33,358 --> 00:26:35,326
I'm terribly embarrassed.

311
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:37,858
Do you want me to call you?

312
00:26:38,863 --> 00:26:41,491
<i>- No.
- But you thought it was me.</i>

313
00:26:45,737 --> 00:26:47,364
What are you laughing at?

314
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:51,673
I didn't call you and I'm not going to,
but if you're gonna call me, call me.

315
00:26:52,477 --> 00:26:54,308
<i>Don't make up excuses.</i>

316
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,547
I'm not playing a game here.

317
00:26:57,682 --> 00:26:59,980
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Betty.

318
00:27:06,324 --> 00:27:07,951
<i>Try to look at this
from Monica's point of view.</i>

319
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:10,619
- Do you mind? This is rather serious.
- Go ahead.

320
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:13,994
<i>Monica wants to get married
with or without Jimmy...</i>

321
00:27:16,701 --> 00:27:19,431
It has come to my attention

322
00:27:20,605 --> 00:27:23,972
that you're not attending
the Sterling Cooper 40th anniversary.

323
00:27:24,075 --> 00:27:28,034
I wouldn't have told Roger
if I planned on it remaining a secret.

324
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:34,509
In Great Britain

325
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:37,753
we have a good deal of testimonials,

326
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:41,019
and the senior members
are all equally unenthused.

327
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:45,756
It marks the passage of time.
It's painful, I imagine.

328
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:50,630
I didn't get to where I am
by dwelling on the past.

329
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:57,906
So think of the future,
all of our clients, all of our staff,

330
00:27:58,576 --> 00:28:01,477
the press, newspapers
and trade publications.

331
00:28:02,313 --> 00:28:04,713
Enjoy the fruit of your longevity.

332
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:09,181
You really pour the honey on,
then you lick it off.

333
00:28:11,556 --> 00:28:14,616
Well, if you care about
Sterling Cooper at all,

334
00:28:14,926 --> 00:28:19,693
remember that your absence
will make everyone think you are ill.

335
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:30,507
Who told you I was vain?

336
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:32,903
Please.

337
00:28:34,312 --> 00:28:35,745
It's obvious.

338
00:31:00,725 --> 00:31:03,694
I want to show Mommy. Mommy!

339
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:07,158
- Maybe she's not here.
- Carla.

340
00:31:09,234 --> 00:31:11,794
- Are you feeling all right?
- I'm fine.

341
00:31:12,737 --> 00:31:16,605
I want you to take the children to the park.
Don't come home...

342
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:21,809
Just... Dinnertime would be perfect.
Take them to the library.

343
00:31:28,753 --> 00:31:29,879
Hello.

344
00:31:37,095 --> 00:31:38,824
I'm glad to see you.

345
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:42,027
Sorry again.

346
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:46,695
We were gonna leave after school
and I am still here, obviously.

347
00:31:48,006 --> 00:31:51,498
You want to wait here for me?
He has to report tomorrow.

348
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:55,506
Let me do it. Let me drive him.

349
00:31:55,613 --> 00:31:57,877
- Where are you going again?
- Bedford, Mass.

350
00:31:57,982 --> 00:32:01,748
- It's a long drive, Don.
- And you'll have to come back alone.

351
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:05,153
Let me do this for you.

352
00:32:06,157 --> 00:32:10,355
I don't want to say goodbye up there.
It's gonna come out ungrateful.

353
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:22,006
There's $375 there, okay?

354
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:27,543
How many times have you done this?

355
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:53,337
Don't you need to gas up?

356
00:32:54,072 --> 00:32:56,870
- No, we're fine.
- So you're not gonna stop?

357
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:01,273
Do you need to stop?

358
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:06,279
I have some movie in my head
where I give you the slip,

359
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:09,820
but I might as well tell you.
I'm not going to Bedford.

360
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:15,116
Well, I am, so I guess you kind of have to.

361
00:33:17,862 --> 00:33:21,457
Why do you care?
You're just gonna go back and screw her.

362
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:28,329
I don't know
if you're capable of understanding,

363
00:33:28,806 --> 00:33:32,071
- but that job is important.
- Did you get me the job?

364
00:33:32,477 --> 00:33:34,274
- No.
- So shut up.

365
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:39,974
I'm not retarded.
Julius Caesar had epilepsy. He ran Rome.

366
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:42,242
Things didn't turn out so well for him.

367
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:46,380
I know what's waiting for me at that place.
I'm 25 years old, Don.

368
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:50,251
I don't want to be cleaning toilets
until I die.

369
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:56,656
Just pull over.

370
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:14,281
- Hold on.
- What?

371
00:34:16,654 --> 00:34:18,349
I'm older than you,

372
00:34:18,956 --> 00:34:22,357
and I'm telling you it seems bad now,
but you can still change things.

373
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:26,760
- Pull myself up by the bootstraps?
- Does that just sound stupid to you?

374
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,431
How do I explain this?

375
00:34:33,271 --> 00:34:35,762
I can't do anything that you can do.

376
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:41,544
Everyone knows, sooner or later,
that there's something wrong with me.

377
00:34:41,646 --> 00:34:43,637
They're kind and they try,

378
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:46,944
but then when I come to
with piss in my pants,

379
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:50,020
they stare at me
like I'm from another planet.

380
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:53,824
I am afflicted, okay?

381
00:34:55,693 --> 00:34:58,821
It's not a question of will.
I can't change that.

382
00:35:02,366 --> 00:35:04,596
- Do you need money?
- Always.

383
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:16,275
I swore to myself
I would try to do this right once.

384
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:17,775
Do what?

385
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:22,283
I want you to call me if you ever need to.

386
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:26,681
And I want you to remember,

387
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:31,655
if something happens to you,
your sister will never forgive herself.

388
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:37,801
You're not gonna tell her, are you?

389
00:35:38,002 --> 00:35:41,165
That I let you out
20 miles outside of Framingham?

390
00:35:50,348 --> 00:35:51,645
Take care.

391
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:46,565
I know he thought I was passing him off,
but he means the world to me.

392
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:50,440
He knows that.

393
00:36:57,615 --> 00:36:59,549
What was the place like?

394
00:37:01,118 --> 00:37:03,086
- Nice.
- Bullshit.

395
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:09,486
He'll be as good as he can be.

396
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:19,365
Don, I don't want to.

397
00:37:20,938 --> 00:37:22,132
I don't.

398
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:25,739
It's okay.

399
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:29,235
- Coffee?
- No.

400
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:33,207
Can you get my wife on the phone?

401
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:46,388
- Betty.
- Where were you last night?

402
00:38:47,892 --> 00:38:51,555
- I told you, I was with Hilton.
- Well, I must have forgotten.

403
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:53,855
Well, did you remember
to pick up my tuxedo?

404
00:38:53,964 --> 00:38:56,023
Yesterday. It's in the closet.

405
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:59,569
<i>I'll get home at 5:30.
We should leave within the hour.</i>

406
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:02,038
I don't know.
I don't know if I'm going to go.

407
00:39:02,973 --> 00:39:05,464
- What's wrong?
- "What's wrong?"

408
00:39:06,143 --> 00:39:07,633
"What's wrong?"

409
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:12,947
I don't feel well.

410
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:17,279
Get into bed and grab a hot water bottle.
You have seven hours.

411
00:39:17,922 --> 00:39:21,858
<i>It's all the clients and all the partners,
and they're all expecting me to show up</i>

412
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:25,224
with the glamorous, elegant,
stunning Betty Draper.

413
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,394
I want to show you off, Betts.

414
00:39:32,837 --> 00:39:33,895
Okay.

415
00:39:39,243 --> 00:39:41,473
You ready? Don's expecting us.

416
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,272
I've got nothing.

417
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:50,216
- What a relief. Mine's garbage, too.
- No, I had something,

418
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:53,584
something incredible, but I lost it.

419
00:39:56,961 --> 00:39:58,826
I didn't write it down.

420
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:05,166
- I hate that.
- It might've been the best idea I ever had.

421
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:08,998
I did everything. I talked to Achilles.

422
00:40:09,106 --> 00:40:11,666
I spent last night recreating
every detail of the evening,

423
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:13,767
hoping it would come back.

424
00:40:14,111 --> 00:40:17,080
You know how it is.
There was nothing and then there was it,

425
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:20,582
- and now it's nothing again.
- I'm so sorry.

426
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:27,614
- How do you talk to Achilles?
- He's a janitor with a very bad memory.

427
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:31,922
You know what the Chinese say?

428
00:40:32,997 --> 00:40:36,160
"The faintest ink is better
than the best memory. "

429
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:40,803
Come on. We've failed before.

430
00:40:54,518 --> 00:40:57,112
Okay, we really looked for advantages.

431
00:40:57,655 --> 00:41:00,556
One of them is,
phone calls happen every day.

432
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:05,027
A telegram's a big deal.
Something like, "She's getting married.

433
00:41:05,362 --> 00:41:07,853
"Are you really just going
to give her a call?"

434
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:12,800
Sounds like you're talking to her parents.
They should really be at that wedding.

435
00:41:13,537 --> 00:41:16,028
Also, old people love them.

436
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:22,107
- "When you care, send one there. "
- That's a slogan, not an idea. Paul?

437
00:41:22,913 --> 00:41:26,713
- Mine aren't any better.
- Damn it, Kinsey. What's your excuse?

438
00:41:27,384 --> 00:41:29,579
- Don't yell at him.
- Excuse me?

439
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:33,687
Tell him what happened.

440
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:35,481
No.

441
00:41:38,562 --> 00:41:42,157
The dog ate my homework.
I had a great idea and I lost it.

442
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,865
I didn't write it down.

443
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:51,141
I hate when that happens.

444
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:56,044
I keep thinking about that Chinese thing
you said. What was it?

445
00:41:56,146 --> 00:41:59,309
"The faintest ink is better
than the best memory. "

446
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:03,981
It just makes me think...
You call someone on the phone,

447
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:08,723
"Hello, I'm getting married"
or, "Congratulations on the baby,"

448
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:11,855
and then you hang up. It's gone.

449
00:42:14,632 --> 00:42:18,568
It's different if you send a telegram.
A telegram is permanent.

450
00:42:20,971 --> 00:42:24,463
Something like, "A telegram is forever. "

451
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:29,275
"You can't frame a phone call. "

452
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:35,678
My God.

453
00:42:38,122 --> 00:42:41,353
That's the way to go.
You two keep working on that.

454
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:45,456
When do you want it?

455
00:42:46,096 --> 00:42:48,690
The party's tonight. Monday.

456
00:42:52,603 --> 00:42:55,003
See? It all works out.

457
00:43:02,112 --> 00:43:03,875
Betts, are you ready?

458
00:43:04,715 --> 00:43:08,014
- The car's downstairs.
- The driver's Chinese.

459
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,153
Ready, Betts?

460
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:23,733
Look how pretty Mommy is.

461
00:43:27,538 --> 00:43:30,666
- Where are we going?
- The Waldorf Astoria, Mummy.

462
00:43:31,475 --> 00:43:33,466
Well, then we passed it.
It's on Fifth Avenue.

463
00:43:33,577 --> 00:43:35,772
It's on Park. Moved years ago.

464
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:40,175
That's right. That's right.
When did they ever do that?

465
00:43:42,753 --> 00:43:45,221
Enjoy the world as it is, Margaret.

466
00:43:45,589 --> 00:43:48,558
They'll change it
and never give you a reason.

467
00:43:49,059 --> 00:43:52,392
Mummy, she's not Margaret, she's Jane.
She's my wife.

468
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:57,233
- Does Mona know?
- Yes, she knows.

469
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:13,507
You seem surprised that there's traffic.
There's always traffic.

470
00:44:14,752 --> 00:44:17,619
Calm yourself. We'll arrive when we arrive.

471
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:21,716
- They're selling the company.
- What?

472
00:44:23,694 --> 00:44:26,026
They're selling Sterling Cooper.

473
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:28,594
- When?
- I have no idea.

474
00:44:30,067 --> 00:44:34,094
- What happens to the Americans?
- They'll go to the highest bidder.

475
00:44:38,142 --> 00:44:40,235
I know you hate uncertainty,

476
00:44:40,477 --> 00:44:44,072
but take comfort in the fact
that we'll return to England.

477
00:44:54,725 --> 00:44:58,161
<i>I'm gonna keep going on
and make Don Draper wait,</i>

478
00:44:58,262 --> 00:45:00,730
<i>because God knows
we've all waited for him.</i>

479
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:07,667
As if being decorated
for his service in Korea weren't enough,

480
00:45:08,138 --> 00:45:10,834
his career has yielded even more awards.

481
00:45:11,842 --> 00:45:16,074
The American Association of Advertising
Agencies' Arthur Kudner Award,

482
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:19,340
<i>Printers' Ink magazine's
advertising gold medal,</i>

483
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:24,451
the Advertising Writers Association
of New York... I'm not reading all of these.

484
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:32,120
He's loyal, charming, quiet but not modest.
Why should he be?

485
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:36,365
We have to thank his beautiful wife, Betty,

486
00:45:36,467 --> 00:45:39,527
and his three children,
for sharing him with us,

487
00:45:39,803 --> 00:45:44,502
because as we all know, sometimes
Sterling Cooper has gotten the lion's share.

488
00:45:45,375 --> 00:45:48,708
Bert Cooper and my father,
Roger Sterling Sr.,

489
00:45:49,113 --> 00:45:51,809
bravely set this in motion 40 years ago.

490
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,081
And now let me introduce the man

491
00:45:54,184 --> 00:45:57,176
who will stand alongside me
for the next 40 years,

492
00:45:57,287 --> 00:46:02,315
our creative director, partner,
father, husband

493
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:06,555
and friend, Donald Draper.

494
00:46:22,346 --> 00:46:24,746
Please. Please.

495
00:46:27,184 --> 00:46:28,344
Please.

496
00:46:30,354 --> 00:46:31,946
I'm very honored.
