1
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:49,513
I don't care if it's windy or rainy,

2
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:54,016
there's no reason for a shake roof to fail
if it's laid right.

3
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:56,012
Except that one.

4
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:59,959
No flashing around the chimney.
That's gonna cost them.

5
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:06,228
Go around!

6
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:17,241
Now, I'm gonna push it up
to 25 miles an hour.

7
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:21,871
That's what we're allowed to do here.
You've got to really pay attention.

8
00:01:33,526 --> 00:01:36,586
Fifteen minutes of news
and nothing about the Holy Father.

9
00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:38,425
He's still dead, Ma.

10
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:40,859
- The shower cap hold up?
- Yes.

11
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,236
Piece of junk.

12
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:48,340
If you want, I'll have Gerry come over
and fix your shower.

13
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:52,605
It was fixed, but I think Ronnie the super
sneaks in and breaks it.

14
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:55,147
For all I know
he's going through my things right now.

15
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:57,876
You don't like getting
a little bit of attention?

16
00:01:57,984 --> 00:02:00,646
Anita, this man does not look
the way you want him to.

17
00:02:00,753 --> 00:02:04,587
I'd offer you a room,
but since Mom moved in, I don't have it.

18
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:08,118
I want to move to Manhattan.

19
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:11,229
Really? It's so far away.

20
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:16,499
It is far, and I commute almost two hours
total every day, five days a week.

21
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:21,871
- That's an extra week of work each month.
- My goodness. I never thought of that.

22
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:24,443
Pegs, the rents there, they're outrageous.

23
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:27,980
I know, but I'm already spending a fortune
between subway fare,

24
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:29,673
cab fare on late nights,

25
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:34,481
pantyhose... If I can't find a newspaper,
the cane on the seats destroys them.

26
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:37,852
And it'll be easy with that savings
and a roommate.

27
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:40,983
Jeez Louise,
you've really been thinking about this.

28
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:43,426
Ma, it's not good for it!

29
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:49,858
Why don't you move in here
and we send her to Manhattan?

30
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:54,269
You gonna be one of those girls?

31
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:58,009
I am one of those girls.

32
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:03,877
Well, Ho-Ho, I observed your wishes
for secrecy, but now is the time.

33
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,483
Gentlemen.

34
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:14,358
Imagine the perfect mixture of athletics,
spectacle and speed.

35
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:17,557
Jai alai.

36
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:21,392
Jai alai is like handball,
only you fling the ball

37
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:24,163
and catch the ball with this basket thing.

38
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:27,330
It's more complicated than that.
And dangerous.

39
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:31,935
I'll leave the loose-leaf, but it shows
the way jai alai attendance is growing.

40
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,878
In seven years, it'll eclipse baseball.

41
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,710
Go ahead, you can laugh,

42
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:41,150
but it's got the same fingerprint as baseball,
only better.

43
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:43,722
A special stadium called a fronton,

44
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:49,021
and you can sit real close, which is a thrill
because the ball goes 175 miles an hour.

45
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:53,862
And it's got Patxi.
He's Babe Ruth, only handsome.

46
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,938
This is Patxi.

47
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:04,034
I was looking for boxers,
but I bought his contract instead.

48
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:07,374
- He's the greatest player in the world.
- Mel Ferrer.

49
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,540
I'm terrified of him catching balls
in the face.

50
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:16,755
So, let's say there's enough money.

51
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,615
How would you chop it up?

52
00:04:20,126 --> 00:04:22,686
Well, most of it's going
to end up in television.

53
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:24,660
Perfect, because I want a TV show.

54
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:27,494
- A sports show?
- Did you see Patxi?

55
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:32,797
You don't see him flying around the world,
solving crimes and banging broads?

56
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:36,770
Harry has excellent relationships
with the networks.

57
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:39,845
- Well, it'll probably have to be ABC.
- No, no.

58
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:45,380
I want to be on all the networks, like when
the President addresses the nation.

59
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:50,919
Tuesday night, 8:30 to 9:00,
all three networks, the same show.

60
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:56,026
- No one's ever done it.
- Because...

61
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:00,530
That's true.

62
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:07,804
How about a star-studded
big musical special with a jai alai match.

63
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:10,970
- Desi Arnaz.
- What else you got?

64
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:14,507
- Well, there's print.
- Women's magazines.

65
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:18,083
A glamorous night in Miami
with a free admission.

66
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:21,849
- Tuesday night is ladies' night.
- And, of course, newspapers are key,

67
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:24,752
but you can't limit yourself
to less than 10 markets.

68
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:26,552
This is impressive.

69
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:31,362
- Don't get up.
- Horace, this is Don Draper.

70
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:35,264
- I told you he'd be stopping by.
- Well, don't let me interrupt.

71
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:37,529
So far, for the jai alai campaign,

72
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:39,901
Sterling Cooper will produce
an adventure program

73
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:43,237
starring your handsome fellow,
a musical spectacular...

74
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:46,471
On all three networks,
and it has to be in color.

75
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:48,911
CBS doesn't have color.

76
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:54,245
Fine. I'd like to get
the ladies' magazines in color,

77
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:57,187
and maybe a color page
in the Sunday paper.

78
00:05:57,924 --> 00:06:01,621
- What about radio?
- You'll have to take radio the way it is.

79
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:08,366
I don't think it's worth anyone's time
unless you're willing to commit to at least

80
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:14,100
- $1 million, to start.
- Sure, but that's a third of my ad budget.

81
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:19,002
Well, as they used to say
at the freshmen mixer,

82
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:23,445
- "When you get a yes, you go home. "
- Only, Humps, you never got one.

83
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:31,657
Listen, Draper, I'd love to buy you dinner,
run some slogans by you.

84
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:34,459
Actually, Ho-Ho, we buy you dinner.

85
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,501
That was fun.

86
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:46,396
I'm going to have to buy Campbell
a case of something.

87
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:47,632
Patxi.

88
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:51,642
During the Depression, I saw somebody

89
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:54,144
throw a loaf of bread
off the back of a truck.

90
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,078
It was more dignified.

91
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:58,916
Are you going to have trouble
sleeping tonight?

92
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:02,044
I've seen clients
far more defenseless than he.

93
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:06,216
Well, as the Bible says,
"Enjoy your fatted calf. "

94
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:10,194
Campbell, did you tell him
who this idiot's father is?

95
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:13,296
He said he's a shipping magnate,
not a client.

96
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:16,459
Horace Sr. Is connected to Bert Cooper
in a million ways,

97
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:19,333
and I don't know if he would like
what just happened in there.

98
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,600
You want to run it by his daddy?

99
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:24,767
He's my age.
So he was born with a lot of money.

100
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:28,478
He has a dream,
and it's our job to make it come true.

101
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,884
Well, there you have it.

102
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:38,485
Nicely done, my boy.

103
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:45,253
Elizabeth. Get off your feet.
It's bad for the baby.

104
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:48,534
- As soon as I finish the dishes.
- Sit with me.

105
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:53,205
Cleaning up for the maid.
You're just like your mother.

106
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:05,349
I don't like watching you commit suicide.
Neither do your kids.

107
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:10,488
What do you want, Daddy?

108
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:16,692
It's all laid out in here,

109
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:21,027
my arrangements.
Just follow the directions.

110
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,027
I don't want to talk about this.

111
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:25,899
We talk about it now and then
we don't talk about it. That's the idea.

112
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:29,338
- Fine.
- Jesus. Smoke your cigarette.

113
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:37,047
Funerals are a dishonest business.

114
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,985
People don't want to think about it.
That's how they get you.

115
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:42,748
Remember what happened
with your mother?

116
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:47,817
The will's translucent or transparent
or something according to the lawyers.

117
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:49,519
You run the show.

118
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,597
- You took me in.
- Anything else?

119
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:58,463
I want you to have your mother's coats.

120
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:02,537
I gave Judy the Hudson seal,
but I want you to have the chinchilla

121
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:04,667
and obviously the mink.

122
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:09,778
They're in the cedar closet.
They key's in Gloria's end table.

123
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,315
Okay, Daddy.

124
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:18,920
You don't want to hear about it,
Scarlett O'Hara?

125
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:20,785
I have the folder.

126
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:27,127
You've always been sensitive.
That's my fault for shielding you

127
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:32,170
from all the dangers out there.
That's probably why you married this joker.

128
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,436
If you'd even known what was possible...

129
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:44,913
But that's that. I wrote it down.
We never have to talk about it again.

130
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:48,615
I don't understand
why you like talking about this

131
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:51,713
when you can see so clearly
that it upsets me.

132
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:55,193
You're being selfish and morbid.

133
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:58,726
I'm your little girl.

134
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:03,899
And I know it must be horrible
to be looking at whatever you're looking at,

135
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:06,403
but can't you keep it to yourself?

136
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:14,202
- What kind of mood is he in?
- I'm never right.

137
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,681
- Anybody been outside? Do I need a coat?
- I'd take it.

138
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:22,243
Don, George Caan dropped out of Patio
to direct a picture in LA.

139
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:24,619
I look forward to his average work.
Replace him.

140
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:26,851
There's no time and there's no talent.

141
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,291
What were you gonna do
if you had to fire him?

142
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:31,761
- Have Sal do it.
- Are you serious?

143
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:35,131
- Sal, do you want to do it?
- Of course I do.

144
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:39,303
It sounds good,
but it makes me very nervous.

145
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:41,870
<i>It's lifted straight from Bye Bye Birdie.
It's a single shot.</i>

146
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:45,102
Sal did the storyboards. I could go on,
but I don't think I should have to.

147
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:47,270
- Allison?
- Keens chophouse.

148
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,870
Thank you, Don.

149
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:52,940
Tag. You're it.

150
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:34,424
Hey. You don't want
to cut towards yourself.

151
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:43,158
There we go. Get down.
I've got some great things in here.

152
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:49,064
This is an exact imitation
of the Gettysburg Address.

153
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:53,178
- You know about Honest Abe?
- He learned to read by candlelight.

154
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,712
That's right.

155
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:57,882
Well, I'll be.

156
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:01,148
Don, look at this.

157
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:07,522
Victory medal, France.

158
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:11,728
I should have another for beating the clap.

159
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:17,867
Here we are.

160
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:21,299
Wow!

161
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:25,640
That spike, it's Prussian.

162
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:30,279
Germany's greatest soldiers.
You had to respect that.

163
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,616
That's where I got him.

164
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:38,452
- You see that? Dried blood.
- You shot him?

165
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:43,762
I think so. I shot lots of them.
They were trying to kill us.

166
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,628
- War is bad.
- Maybe,

167
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:49,565
but it makes a man out of you.

168
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:56,335
Living off the land, battling the elements,
standing alongside your brothers.

169
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:59,803
- Ask your pop.
- Gene.

170
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,709
- What?
- Gene, don't.

171
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:05,914
- Come on.
- Bobby, give it back.

172
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:08,747
Let him have it! That's why I got it!

173
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:12,051
- Can't I have it?
- There was a person in that helmet.

174
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:15,559
- An enemy.
- Bobby, it's a dead man's hat. Take it off.

175
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:18,458
Keep it on. It's yours.

176
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,313
There was this girl...

177
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,225
You like? It was on sale at A&S.

178
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:59,404
Looks like a lot more than 20% off.

179
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:08,973
Kitty.

180
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:13,210
Kitty.

181
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:17,119
I'm working.

182
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:28,797
- Something's wrong, isn't it?
- No.

183
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:33,994
No, no, no, don't say that. Don't say that.

184
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:41,370
- I'm not myself.
- What does that mean?

185
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:49,015
Why are men so embarrassed
to share their emotions?

186
00:14:56,762 --> 00:14:59,322
Please. Sal...

187
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,634
The past few months... Something's wrong.

188
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:08,773
- Well, that's not true.
- It is true.

189
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:13,539
You know, I don't need that much, but...

190
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:16,073
I do need tending.

191
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:25,155
- I'm so sorry.
- Well, what can I do?

192
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:28,390
You won't even tell me.

193
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:31,921
Make some excuse.

194
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:39,159
For the last six months, maybe a year, even,
I've watched my job disappear.

195
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:44,107
Nobody wants illustrations anymore.
It's all about photography.

196
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:47,874
And yes, I've been nervous.

197
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:51,175
And now I have this opportunity

198
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:54,309
to do something
that really does have a future.

199
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:58,852
So it's been building to this,
and tomorrow you will triumph

200
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,324
and come home a conquering hero.

201
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:07,959
- What's wrong with you?
- Well, I do have one horrible flaw.

202
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:10,499
I love you.

203
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,236
I don't want to fail.

204
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:21,573
Just... With a single mistake,
the entire shot is ruined.

205
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:26,707
So what? You've seen the movies.
Take two. Take three. Do it again. Action.

206
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,811
It's one shot, the whole thing.

207
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:34,887
<i>- It's the beginning of Bye Bye Birdie.
- I'm trying to remember.</i>

208
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,420
She starts singing
against a blue background,

209
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:39,019
and her voice is very girlish.

210
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:44,000
- Yes. Yes, I remember that.
- And she's offering us this can of Patio.

211
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:46,434
And she's on a treadmill,
but you can't see it.

212
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:50,338
- She's walking back and forth?
- No, no. She walks towards you.

213
00:16:52,077 --> 00:16:54,375
The wind is blowing in her hair,

214
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,907
and she sings about
how Patio is low in calories.

215
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:01,544
And then she extends her hand out
and she waves goodbye.

216
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:03,588
Then we move back, too,

217
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:06,749
but she stops,
and she takes her dress in her hands

218
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:11,626
and she runs forward as fast as she can.
But then she turns her back

219
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:17,429
and looks seductively over her shoulder.

220
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:21,973
The treadmill pulls her back again
and she comes towards you one last time,

221
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:26,204
dancing right up to the camera.
She sort of pushes her shoulders together

222
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:30,873
and leans over with the can
and she smiles. "Hello, Patio. "

223
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:37,316
Something like that.

224
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:40,322
Sound good?

225
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,725
You're gonna do great.

226
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:57,575
- You really think so?
- Yes.

227
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,680
Don, I'd like you to meet Horace Cook.

228
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:13,583
- We've met. Lincoln Center.
- Of course.

229
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:17,326
Have a seat.
Lane has brought it to my attention

230
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:20,193
that Mr. Cook's son
has approached us for work.

231
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:24,599
Actually, it was Don who thought it best,
out of deference, to include you.

232
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:28,867
We're not psychiatrists.
There is no confidentiality.

233
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:34,641
That's not strictly true, but you are family
and, well, it appears to be a lot of money.

234
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:39,444
Bert seemed alarmed.
What exactly happened in this meeting?

235
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,056
- Well, you know, your son has a dream.
- Yes, jai alai.

236
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:48,525
When he first mentioned it
I assumed he was gambling,

237
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:51,528
but he seems convinced
of its financial potential.

238
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,188
And there's no reason to doubt that.

239
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:58,497
Are you drunk? It's like Polish handball.
You can't even play it if you're left-handed.

240
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:00,299
There's no wall on that side.

241
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:03,135
Well, then, that's done with.
We needn't be involved.

242
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:06,734
Bert, you know that's not the way
the marketplace works.

243
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,370
A man comes through your door,

244
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:12,780
he knows what he wants,
he's got the money to back it up,

245
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:15,979
- you do your best.
- Perhaps I'm unclear

246
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:19,389
because I'm childless, but they're not.

247
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:24,657
Well, should you be lucky enough
to strike gold,

248
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:29,390
remember that your children weren't there
when you were swinging the pick.

249
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:33,066
I've seen his plan. It's gibberish.

250
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:37,838
But if you refuse him,
he'll only find someone else.

251
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:44,043
My son lives in a cloud of success,

252
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:46,748
but it's my success.

253
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:51,580
Perhaps when that evaporates
and his face is pressed

254
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:55,854
against the reality of the sidewalk,
he'll be of value to someone.

255
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:04,027
"Kill or be killed, eat or be eaten. "

256
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:07,171
That's how I was raised.

257
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,531
So you want us to proceed?

258
00:20:13,745 --> 00:20:17,340
When we put that money aside for him,
he was a little boy.

259
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:21,780
We didn't know
what kind of person we were making.

260
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,551
Don't be so hard on yourself.

261
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:31,587
Easy for you to say.
He doesn't have your name.

262
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:34,290
You'll stay for lunch. No discussion.

263
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,193
A pleasure to see you again.

264
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:39,031
Pleasure.

265
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:44,841
- I'll sign him tonight.
- Very good.

266
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,446
These are ideas.

267
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:54,315
You can skip some if you want to,
but do not go out of order.

268
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:04,094
Hello, this is Margaret.

269
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:07,290
Hello, my name is Elaine and I'm 22,

270
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:11,096
and I have a good job
and I'm interested in a roommate, too.

271
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:15,136
Well, it's nice to speak with you, Elaine.
Where do you work?

272
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,700
Well, I live in Teaneck, New Jersey,

273
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:20,801
so I want to be in this city
to be near my job.

274
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:26,009
<i>- I work in a tannery on the West Side.
- Really? They make leather?</i>

275
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,677
<i>I'm a secretary,</i>

276
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:32,388
but I am around animal skins and carcasses
most of the day,

277
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:36,052
so I don't keep pets.
The smell makes them go crazy.

278
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:42,491
I don't know if the West Side
is what I had in mind.

279
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:45,263
I need someplace near a major hospital.

280
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:48,297
<i>My face is very badly burned</i>

281
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:52,435
and I need frequent prescriptions
for unguents and salves.

282
00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:59,875
<i>- It would have to be two bedrooms.
- Two bedrooms is good.</i>

283
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,250
Now, about the bathroom,

284
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:08,024
<i>I'm going to need some help there.</i>

285
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:13,959
Who is this?
You know something? You're a jerk.

286
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:28,344
- Why do you do that?
- I've got a salt tooth.

287
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:33,377
- It's right here in the back of my mouth.
- Grandpa.

288
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:38,480
It's getting harder to fool you.
I got two spoons.

289
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:42,554
Mommy doesn't let us
have ice cream before dinner.

290
00:22:43,228 --> 00:22:46,391
Is she afraid you're going to be fat
like she was?

291
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:50,635
Your grandma Ruth used to
drive her to town to run errands

292
00:22:50,736 --> 00:22:54,035
and make her walk herself home.
That put a stop to it.

293
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:57,370
- You remember Grandma Ruth?
- She gave me a ukulele.

294
00:22:57,743 --> 00:22:59,335
- Did you learn it?
- No.

295
00:22:59,444 --> 00:23:01,742
You can, you know. You're smart.

296
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:06,580
You remind me of your grandma
more than your mother.

297
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:13,185
You know, she did drafting
in the 20s for this engineer.

298
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:18,126
- A little bald man. He wasn't a threat.
- That's good.

299
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:27,567
You can really do something.
Don't let your mother tell you otherwise.

300
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:35,537
You know, she won't let me eat this either,
and I don't want to be the only one,

301
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:38,844
so I'll tell you what.
I'm gonna keep a lookout.

302
00:23:41,953 --> 00:23:44,786
Okay. Go ahead. The coast is clear.

303
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:50,359
- She's coming! Quick, hide it!
- I knew you were gonna do that.

304
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:56,831
This tastes like chocolate,
but it smells like oranges. You smell that?

305
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:07,100
A year from now there'll be nothing
but rum and Mexican beer in this place.

306
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:10,306
- You ever have Mexican beer, Humps?
- I don't drink a lot of beer.

307
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:13,543
You have to when you're there.
Amoeba, dysentery.

308
00:24:13,885 --> 00:24:17,844
Patxi caught a bug, lost eight pounds.
That's a lot on his frame.

309
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:20,717
Ho-Ho was saying a photo of Jack Kennedy
enjoying jai alai

310
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:23,226
would be a tremendous endorsement.

311
00:24:23,728 --> 00:24:24,888
My father hates Kennedy,

312
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:27,487
'cause he knew Old Joe
when they were criminals together.

313
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:31,262
Plus, Dad's against integration.
He called Patxi a wetback.

314
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:36,664
Jack Kennedy certainly ended up
with a better job than his father.

315
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:40,807
I know this idea sounds crazy,
but read your history.

316
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:43,210
I've got a 50% chance, at least.

317
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:47,944
My father's dead,
but I know he'd be interested.

318
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,918
This is his kind of investment.

319
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:55,218
I think about the way
my father made his fortune,

320
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:58,955
renting ships for troop transport
during the war.

321
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:02,364
He didn't care about the Germans.

322
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:05,736
And then I think,
I could really do something.

323
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:11,198
I might not be president, but I could...
I could build something.

324
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:14,240
And people will like it,
and I'm going to be the father of this sport,

325
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:18,578
and people are gonna be dying
to do business with me, even my father.

326
00:25:21,386 --> 00:25:24,583
I have this image in my mind.

327
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:28,522
It's his 75th birthday,

328
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:32,586
and I give him a team.

329
00:25:40,805 --> 00:25:43,365
I want to give you a piece of advice.

330
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:47,606
I've been doing this a while,
and I applaud your enthusiasm,

331
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:52,183
but I think you should take this decision
a little more seriously.

332
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:55,549
- What are you saying, Don?
- Let him... Let him talk.

333
00:25:56,454 --> 00:26:00,754
You have a great fortune,
and that's not just money. That's the future.

334
00:26:02,661 --> 00:26:05,824
And we will take all of your money,
I promise you,

335
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:10,762
but I think you should reevaluate
this particular obsession.

336
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,864
You can do better.

337
00:26:26,952 --> 00:26:29,420
That's a sales technique, isn't it?

338
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:33,352
You zig away from me
and I zag back into your arms.

339
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:36,250
You know,
I've got the galleys of this book by Ogilvy.

340
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:38,659
Learned a lot about advertising.

341
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:42,498
Then why aren't you eating dinner
with Ogilvy?

342
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:45,126
'Cause Campbell talked me out of it.

343
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:50,605
Now let's get one thing straight.

344
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:54,904
If jai alai fails, it's your fault.

345
00:26:58,216 --> 00:26:59,740
I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.

346
00:26:59,851 --> 00:27:03,287
Don't apologize. Everybody thinks that.
Nobody says it.

347
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:18,632
Are you removing that or moving it?

348
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:21,467
Did everybody in Manhattan decide
I'm not allowed to live here?

349
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:26,033
No. Actually, I think the right girl
could have a very good effect on you.

350
00:27:27,245 --> 00:27:29,941
I do, however, find your ad unfortunate.

351
00:27:30,448 --> 00:27:33,042
It's perfect. I proofed it thoroughly.

352
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:36,650
"Clean, responsible, considerate.

353
00:27:36,755 --> 00:27:39,849
"I have some nice furniture
and a small television. "

354
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:43,359
It reads like the stage directions
from an Ibsen play.

355
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:46,256
So what, then? You'll give me some ideas,

356
00:27:46,364 --> 00:27:49,094
and I'll use them,
and you'll all have an even bigger laugh?

357
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,930
No, I thought I'd tell you
how to get a roommate.

358
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:53,766
This is not the way.

359
00:27:55,707 --> 00:27:56,765
Fine.

360
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:01,578
Please, Joan, tell me how to do it.

361
00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:07,547
- For one thing, why "Margaret"?
- It's my name and it's more adult.

362
00:28:08,153 --> 00:28:12,852
But this is about two young girls
in Manhattan. This is about an adventure.

363
00:28:13,992 --> 00:28:15,323
Am I wrong?

364
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:19,596
If this were me, I would say something like,

365
00:28:20,265 --> 00:28:23,564
"Fun-loving girl, responsible sometimes.

366
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:26,866
"Likes to laugh. Lives to love.

367
00:28:26,971 --> 00:28:30,498
"Seeks size six for city living
and general gallivanting.

368
00:28:30,608 --> 00:28:34,544
"No dull moments or dull men tolerated. "
Or something like that.

369
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:38,641
Well, thank you. That's very helpful.

370
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:42,148
And don't put it up there.
Everyone here knows you.

371
00:28:42,987 --> 00:28:44,318
Branch out.

372
00:28:45,857 --> 00:28:47,484
Good night, Peggy.

373
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:55,854
Don. There you are.

374
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:59,559
I was just on my way over to Lane.
I've got signatures.

375
00:29:59,664 --> 00:30:02,861
Horace Cook, Jr. Is all dressed
and ready for the oven.

376
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:04,559
In light of all of the trepidation,

377
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:07,797
perhaps you should deliver this
to Lane yourself.

378
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:17,781
- Are you following me?
- I spent two years at Dartmouth

379
00:30:17,882 --> 00:30:21,010
hiding him from shylocks.
Let me enjoy my payday.

380
00:30:25,857 --> 00:30:28,826
Mr. Hooker,
has Lane stopped by the clubhouse?

381
00:30:29,394 --> 00:30:31,123
I'll go and get him.

382
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:35,830
That's called a cesta.
It's made of reeds from the Pyrenees.

383
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:39,529
The ball is called a pelota.
They just sent all this over.

384
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:45,168
So did Horace have any more ideas?

385
00:30:45,276 --> 00:30:47,938
For one thing,
he wants us to call it the NJAA.

386
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:51,573
National Jai Alai Association?

387
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:55,983
He has no idea how confused
America's gonna be about that "J."

388
00:30:56,387 --> 00:30:58,412
Look at this camaraderie.

389
00:30:58,923 --> 00:31:01,585
Perhaps we've discovered
America's pastime after all.

390
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,285
Full steam ahead.

391
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:07,487
<i>- Bravo, boys.
- How about Patxi: The Motion Picture?</i>

392
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:09,891
God, I wish I was a part of this.

393
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:13,903
I've informed the home office.
There was a flutter of adding machines.

394
00:31:14,005 --> 00:31:15,495
Well, you heard him, boys.

395
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:17,973
Don't stop until you see the whites
of his pockets.

396
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:19,304
Cosgrove.

397
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,141
Good God.

398
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:29,881
Bill it to the kid.

399
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:41,661
- What the hell is that?
- It's an English muffin.

400
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:44,860
The hell it is. Put it away.
You can eat at school.

401
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:47,028
I already ate my breakfast.

402
00:31:49,607 --> 00:31:51,097
Well, don't keep me waiting this afternoon.

403
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:54,269
I want you dressed and ready for ballet
at 3:00 on the button.

404
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:56,074
- No dawdling.
- Okay.

405
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:01,484
I'm gonna buy fruit. What do you want?

406
00:32:02,053 --> 00:32:04,886
- Peaches, please.
- Peaches give me a rash.

407
00:32:05,189 --> 00:32:07,054
Your sister likes them.

408
00:32:10,828 --> 00:32:13,126
Are you Peggy?
They just sent me back from reception.

409
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:16,997
- I'm Karen Ericson.
- Yes, I am. How nice to finally meet you.

410
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:23,802
You have your own office.
Wowee! At the travel agency, it takes years,

411
00:32:23,908 --> 00:32:26,900
and Martha Winston's the only girl,
and she's married to the boss.

412
00:32:27,011 --> 00:32:28,876
Well, it's different up here.

413
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:32,211
Everyone on the first floor
loved your humorous ad.

414
00:32:33,051 --> 00:32:34,712
You seem like someone
I could really be friends with,

415
00:32:34,819 --> 00:32:36,684
not like the last girl.

416
00:32:37,088 --> 00:32:41,457
Well, I'm fun and I love to have fun.

417
00:32:42,727 --> 00:32:44,524
She was always keeping her door shut,

418
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:47,496
and I think you should only close your door
for one reason.

419
00:32:47,598 --> 00:32:48,963
What's that?

420
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:55,104
I just don't get along with women
like I do men,

421
00:32:55,206 --> 00:32:58,437
but she left to get married,
so I must be some kind of good-luck charm.

422
00:32:58,543 --> 00:33:02,035
- Do you have a steady?
- No, I'm still playing the field.

423
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:06,010
There are so many interesting men
out there. Except sailors.

424
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:09,812
I have a couple of rules.
One of them is I don't like sailors.

425
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:14,449
- No sailors. I agree.
- So, Peggy Olson, I have to ask,

426
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:18,560
- are you Swedish? Because I am.
- Norwegian.

427
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:23,863
Well, we won't tell my parents.

428
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:27,933
I'll make appointments and come by at 5:00.
Or do you want your girl to do it?

429
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:30,064
I finish up around 6:00.

430
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:32,472
- Well, then tomorrow?
- Most days.

431
00:33:33,478 --> 00:33:34,740
Can we look on Saturday?

432
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,939
- But not this Saturday...
- You work on Saturday?

433
00:33:37,048 --> 00:33:39,380
Not every Saturday.
And Saturday nights never.

434
00:33:39,484 --> 00:33:41,952
I'm out in the city, ready for fun.

435
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:45,048
Well, okay. I'll call you, roomie.

436
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:48,954
I got you a sandwich.

437
00:33:50,094 --> 00:33:53,825
- I'm gonna walk around the park.
- Well, have fun, roomie.

438
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:13,981
It's Mommy.

439
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:23,519
- Where's Grandpa Gene?
- It must've slipped his mind.

440
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:26,062
- Where is he?
- Probably at home.

441
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:29,329
I'm sure he'll be there when we get home.

442
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:50,981
<i>Bye, bye, sugar</i>

443
00:34:51,222 --> 00:34:54,055
<i>Hello, Patio</i>

444
00:34:57,128 --> 00:35:00,620
<i>When the cake
is on the plate</i>

445
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:04,458
<i>I'm afraid
to gain the weight</i>

446
00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:09,336
<i>But now I have
some extra room</i>

447
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:12,700
<i>Patio,
you make me swoon</i>

448
00:35:13,544 --> 00:35:15,478
<i>Diet cola tastes divine</i>

449
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:17,548
<i>Get your own,
'cause this one's mine</i>

450
00:35:17,648 --> 00:35:19,582
<i>It's the brand new
slender you</i>

451
00:35:19,684 --> 00:35:23,415
<i>Now we'll have you
singing too</i>

452
00:35:23,821 --> 00:35:27,848
<i>Bye, bye, sugar</i>

453
00:35:28,192 --> 00:35:31,355
<i>It's great
to see you go</i>

454
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:36,058
<i>So bye, bye, sugar</i>

455
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:39,996
<i>Hello, Patio</i>

456
00:35:40,505 --> 00:35:44,441
<i>Hello, Patio</i>

457
00:35:44,575 --> 00:35:48,443
<i>Hello, Patio</i>

458
00:35:56,888 --> 00:36:01,951
- I can't even tell you how thorough Sal was.
- Well, I appreciate that, but this is...

459
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:05,156
I don't know.
This is not what I thought it was gonna be.

460
00:36:05,263 --> 00:36:06,958
Glad I'm not alone.

461
00:36:07,598 --> 00:36:11,466
Look, I don't think there's any ambiguity
about this being exactly,

462
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:13,901
and I mean exactly, what you asked for.

463
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:17,133
I know,
but there's something not right about it.

464
00:36:18,075 --> 00:36:22,011
- What?
- I can't put my finger on it.

465
00:36:22,446 --> 00:36:26,542
- I wish I could, but I can't.
- It's an exact copy, frame for frame.

466
00:36:27,618 --> 00:36:31,315
I'll tell you what. Why don't we send a dupe
back to the office with you?

467
00:36:31,422 --> 00:36:33,117
No. I'm sorry.

468
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:37,022
I wish I could explain it,
but it's just not right.

469
00:36:38,296 --> 00:36:42,164
I'm gonna be magnanimous
and say it's our idea and our failure,

470
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:45,063
but it is a failure.

471
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:48,300
That is magnanimous.

472
00:36:50,608 --> 00:36:53,270
- I'm sorry about that.
- Maybe next time.

473
00:37:00,785 --> 00:37:04,721
It's true. It's not right.
It doesn't make any sense. It looks right,

474
00:37:04,822 --> 00:37:08,781
it sounds right, smells right.
Something's not right. What is it?

475
00:37:09,126 --> 00:37:10,889
It's not Ann-Margret.

476
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:30,212
Mommy, there's a policeman! Hurry!

477
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:38,651
Yes, may I help you?

478
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:42,453
- Are you related to Eugene Hofstadt?
- Yes, I am. What is it?

479
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:46,386
We regret to inform you
that he passed away.

480
00:37:46,497 --> 00:37:48,089
- Oh, God.
- No! No!

481
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:50,061
I'm fine.

482
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:55,898
- What happened?
- He collapsed in line at the A&P.

483
00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:58,203
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

484
00:38:01,178 --> 00:38:02,202
I...

485
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:04,938
I...

486
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:10,212
Well, we need to know
what you'd like to do with his body.

487
00:38:12,323 --> 00:38:13,813
Yes, of course.

488
00:38:34,779 --> 00:38:38,306
<i>- Mr. Romano's here to see you.
- Send him in.</i>

489
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:45,487
I figured I'd bring myself to the woodshed.

490
00:38:46,123 --> 00:38:48,182
It must be horrible
having a client insist on something

491
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:50,260
and then change their mind
once they've seen it.

492
00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:54,661
- I hope it never happens to me.
- I was the director and I let you down.

493
00:38:57,468 --> 00:39:00,335
- I'm in a meeting.
- I have Mrs. Draper on the line.

494
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:02,998
- It's urgent.
- I can go.

495
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:09,372
What's the matter?

496
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:18,146
I'm sorry, Betts.

497
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:20,416
I'm...

498
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:23,182
I'm very sorry.

499
00:39:25,229 --> 00:39:27,493
Do you want me to call William?

500
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:32,569
Just stay put. I'll be right there.

501
00:39:35,773 --> 00:39:38,173
- I have to go.
- Is everything okay?

502
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:41,736
There's nothing you can do.

503
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,706
Don't ruin the only good thing
to come of this.

504
00:39:46,484 --> 00:39:48,884
You are now a commercial director.

505
00:39:51,021 --> 00:39:54,047
How do I know you're not just saying that
to make me feel better?

506
00:39:54,158 --> 00:39:56,683
You'll know when I hire you again.

507
00:39:57,528 --> 00:39:59,792
Allison, I'm going for the day.

508
00:40:07,705 --> 00:40:08,933
Okay, Ma.

509
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:13,410
Oh, my goodness. It's beautiful.

510
00:40:14,545 --> 00:40:18,413
Is that all the noise that this was?
Why didn't you wait for Gerry to help?

511
00:40:18,516 --> 00:40:21,007
Because he's playing cards
and Peggy gets up early.

512
00:40:21,118 --> 00:40:23,916
- Say thank you, Ma.
- Thank you, sweetheart.

513
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:28,384
An Admiral. You must be doing well.

514
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:32,620
- I am.
- What's the matter, peaches?

515
00:40:34,732 --> 00:40:36,165
Sit down, Ma.

516
00:40:38,235 --> 00:40:39,862
What's this about?

517
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:43,304
Don't, Anita. Stay.

518
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:50,202
Ma, I'm having problems with my apartment,

519
00:40:50,815 --> 00:40:53,215
and my commute is very long and...

520
00:40:54,885 --> 00:40:57,786
It doesn't mean nothing
if you want to stay here with us.

521
00:40:57,888 --> 00:40:59,753
Your father and I lived
with grandma and grandpa for years.

522
00:40:59,857 --> 00:41:01,916
Your sister was born there.

523
00:41:04,161 --> 00:41:06,959
Ma, I'm getting an apartment in Manhattan.

524
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:15,664
- Well, that makes sense.
- It really does.

525
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:18,101
Yeah, I guess I'm the kind of mother

526
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:20,439
who'd rather have a new TV
than a daughter.

527
00:41:20,544 --> 00:41:23,012
I got you a new TV
because you needed one.

528
00:41:23,113 --> 00:41:26,082
You got me a new TV
'cause you think I was born yesterday.

529
00:41:26,183 --> 00:41:28,048
You belong in the city.

530
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:32,786
Do you see this, Anita?
This is what they do. Family is cheap.

531
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:34,715
Well, take it back, okay?

532
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:37,726
Because it's just going to remind me
of how stupid you think I am.

533
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:40,956
Ma! You knew she'd have
to move there eventually.

534
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:48,100
Now, someday both of you
are going to feel this,

535
00:41:48,205 --> 00:41:51,072
this... This broken heart I'm carrying.

536
00:41:55,613 --> 00:41:57,911
You'll get raped, you know that?

537
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:03,576
It's just as dangerous as here,
and I'm going to have a roommate.

538
00:42:03,754 --> 00:42:07,554
She's a nice girl. Her name
is Karen Ericson. She's Norwegian.

539
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:10,590
- There's a man, isn't there?
- No.

540
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:14,154
Why would I ever believe anything you say?

541
00:42:14,265 --> 00:42:16,563
Stop it, Ma. You're being cruel.

542
00:42:19,236 --> 00:42:20,726
Good night, Ma.

543
00:42:30,981 --> 00:42:33,415
- That wasn't so bad.
- Really?

544
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:37,283
She's been through a lot of change lately.

545
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:40,516
The Holy Father dying,
that was very hard on her.

546
00:42:42,593 --> 00:42:43,992
<i>It has become one country</i>

547
00:42:44,094 --> 00:42:47,154
<i>because all of us
and all the people who came here</i>

548
00:42:47,264 --> 00:42:49,698
<i>had an equal chance
to develop their talents.</i>

549
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:54,032
<i>We cannot say to 10% of the population
that you can't have that right,</i>

550
00:42:54,171 --> 00:42:56,571
<i>that your children can't have the chance
to develop whatever talent...</i>

551
00:42:56,674 --> 00:42:58,767
Eugene Hofstadt, number two.

552
00:43:00,678 --> 00:43:04,637
Eugene Hofstadt, number two.

553
00:43:07,051 --> 00:43:08,780
What does that mean?

554
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:12,487
There were two Eugene Hofstadts
at his bank,

555
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:16,121
so he had to be called Eugene Hofstadt,
number two.

556
00:43:17,695 --> 00:43:20,220
Well, he's with Ruth now.

557
00:43:22,299 --> 00:43:23,596
I hope so.

558
00:43:26,403 --> 00:43:27,870
Once he asked,

559
00:43:28,572 --> 00:43:32,508
"What's gonna happen when I get to heaven
and I have two wives?"

560
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:36,936
Knowing Gloria,
I don't think that's gonna be a problem.

561
00:43:44,355 --> 00:43:47,483
Betts, don't eat that.
It was in his car all day.

562
00:43:48,092 --> 00:43:49,525
I don't care.

563
00:43:51,862 --> 00:43:54,695
- Why are you laughing?
- Sally, sweetheart...

564
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:58,734
- We weren't laughing, honey.
- I heard you. I heard you laughing.

565
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:02,401
How can you be sitting there
like nothing's happening?

566
00:44:02,506 --> 00:44:05,839
Like he's not gone?
He was here, now he's not here.

567
00:44:06,076 --> 00:44:08,601
He's gone forever
and nobody even knows that.

568
00:44:08,712 --> 00:44:09,906
Stop it.

569
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:13,908
- You're being hysterical. Calm down.
- He's dead!

570
00:44:14,351 --> 00:44:18,685
He's dead and he's never coming back!
And nobody cares

571
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:23,119
- that he's really, really, really gone!
- Sally, go watch TV!

572
00:44:35,372 --> 00:44:38,967
<i>The United States army convoy
was delayed by soviet border guards,</i>

573
00:44:39,076 --> 00:44:41,943
<i>when the convoy commander
rejected commands that his troops</i>

574
00:44:42,046 --> 00:44:44,446
<i>leave their vehicles for a head count.</i>

575
00:44:44,548 --> 00:44:48,040
<i>The Russians finally allowed
the convoy to pass. Robert?</i>

576
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:51,484
<i>Dumbstruck police

577
00:44:51,588 --> 00:44:54,557
<i>as an elderly Buddhist monk
set fire to himself today,</i>

578
00:44:54,658 --> 00:44:58,094
<i>resulting in his death.
The bizarre act was a protest</i>

579
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:02,564
<i>against the mostly Catholic government
of Ngo Dinh Diem of South Vietnam</i>

580
00:45:02,666 --> 00:45:05,635
<i>and their supposed campaign
of discrimination.</i>

581
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:10,266
<i>The New York Stock Exchange today
saw slight gains in moderate trading</i>

582
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:14,003
<i>as the Dow Jones Industrial Average
rose nearly two points.</i>

583
