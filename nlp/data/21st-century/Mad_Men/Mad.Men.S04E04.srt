2
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:15,723
Uh-huh.

3
00:01:15,791 --> 00:01:19,092
Lee, Lee, Don doesn't think
there's a problem.

4
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:22,328
Lee, those restrictions
aren't going to affect Lucky Strike.

5
00:01:22,395 --> 00:01:24,763
Besides, Lee, your lawyers
came up with them.

6
00:01:24,831 --> 00:01:28,266
"No more smoking teenagers"...
We complied a year ago.

7
00:01:28,334 --> 00:01:30,468
"No more famous athletes"

8
00:01:30,535 --> 00:01:32,503
and we have to stop using certain angles.

9
00:01:34,038 --> 00:01:35,639
Uh-huh.

10
00:01:35,707 --> 00:01:37,307
Low angles, wide lenses...

11
00:01:37,374 --> 00:01:39,675
Anything that makes the smoker
appear superhuman.

12
00:01:43,113 --> 00:01:45,578
- Why is this empty?
- Because you drank it all.

13
00:01:45,645 --> 00:01:48,011
- He can't hear you.
- There's kind of a loophole

14
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:50,713
because even without athletes you
can still use sports.

15
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:53,315
Bowling, for example, seems a natural fit.

16
00:01:54,617 --> 00:01:56,350
Bowling is a sport, Lee.

17
00:01:56,418 --> 00:01:58,685
Well, how about horse-racing?

18
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:03,389
Lee. Lee, the jockey smokes the cigarette.

19
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:05,523
Did either of you ladies
bring any ice with you?

20
00:02:05,591 --> 00:02:07,358
We're sorting out
the focus group for Pond's

21
00:02:07,426 --> 00:02:08,926
and I haven't gotten the hypothesis...

22
00:02:08,993 --> 00:02:10,694
- In writing anyway.
- He said "Don."

23
00:02:12,797 --> 00:02:14,598
We'll do our best.

24
00:02:14,665 --> 00:02:17,467
- Peggy, write it up.
- You haven't okayed the brief.

25
00:02:17,535 --> 00:02:19,602
I liked your idea. I liked it a lot.

26
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:21,036
The mirror one or the cleansing one?

27
00:02:21,104 --> 00:02:22,571
What's the mirror one?

28
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:24,872
Well, I think it's about the ritual,

29
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:27,975
the multiple applications, indulgence.

30
00:02:28,043 --> 00:02:30,778
"Pond's is the only cold cream
that allows me

31
00:02:30,845 --> 00:02:33,080
to stare at myself in the mirror
for 20 minutes

32
00:02:33,147 --> 00:02:34,481
and feel good and not vain."

33
00:02:36,084 --> 00:02:37,851
That's very good.

34
00:02:40,655 --> 00:02:42,819
So we're talking about girls 18 to 25.

35
00:02:42,887 --> 00:02:44,286
Can I grab a few from around here?

36
00:02:44,354 --> 00:02:45,886
Yeah, help yourself.

37
00:02:45,954 --> 00:02:47,621
See, I would never buy a sailboat.

38
00:02:47,689 --> 00:02:50,023
I don't want to do things myself.

39
00:02:50,091 --> 00:02:52,625
For that price, that boat should
have a motor.

40
00:02:52,693 --> 00:02:55,527
A what?

41
00:02:55,595 --> 00:02:58,130
- One of those too.
- Anything else?

42
00:03:01,267 --> 00:03:04,766
I don't know.
Why don't you ask Don about that?

43
00:03:04,834 --> 00:03:06,702
I have to go to the little boys' room.

44
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:09,571
I'm sorry, Lee, can you go through that
one more time?

45
00:03:12,841 --> 00:03:16,109
That's the Lucky Strike call?
Why wasn't I told?

46
00:03:16,177 --> 00:03:18,077
Be happy. I saved you an ass-ache.

47
00:03:23,816 --> 00:03:25,683
So what's so bad he couldn't tell me?

48
00:03:25,751 --> 00:03:28,085
Cal Rutledge from Chesebrough-Pond's

49
00:03:28,153 --> 00:03:30,086
has a wild hair about Clearasil.

50
00:03:30,154 --> 00:03:31,888
He thinks they're in conflict.

51
00:03:31,955 --> 00:03:33,723
Pimple cream and cold cream?

52
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:36,958
- That's a rather broad definition.
- Does it matter?

53
00:03:37,026 --> 00:03:39,994
Look, Pete, we're going to have
to resign the Clearasil account.

54
00:03:41,463 --> 00:03:43,731
- Why?
- Lane.

55
00:03:43,798 --> 00:03:45,532
It can't be up for debate.

56
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,334
Clearasil is worth $1.25 million in billings

57
00:03:48,402 --> 00:03:51,003
- and Pond's over two.
- No.

58
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:53,171
Do you know what it took
to get my father-in-law

59
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:54,706
to join this new firm to begin with?

60
00:03:54,773 --> 00:03:57,874
15% of $750,000

61
00:03:57,942 --> 00:04:00,509
is near $113,000.

62
00:04:00,577 --> 00:04:03,412
Roger, I don't expect him
to understand this,

63
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,347
but do you have any idea  of what
I've had to do to keep that account?

64
00:04:06,415 --> 00:04:08,282
The personal toll I've paid?

65
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:10,783
I do, but you've been good to him...

66
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:12,551
Remember that... Saleswise.

67
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:15,220
- Mr. Sterling.
- I don't believe this.

68
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:18,723
- Roger.
- Throw yourself on the grenade.

69
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,792
Protect the agency. You're a partner now.

70
00:04:22,594 --> 00:04:24,094
This evening if you can.

71
00:04:28,099 --> 00:04:30,333
Over half this agency is
dedicated to your needs,

72
00:04:30,401 --> 00:04:32,468
but if you want to get
into the line-by-line

73
00:04:32,536 --> 00:04:34,136
of the costs we've billed for,

74
00:04:34,204 --> 00:04:36,538
I'll have Lane Pryce at the foot
of your bed in 20 minutes.

75
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,741
Oh my God, there's some kind of fire.

76
00:04:41,143 --> 00:04:42,543
Right down by Radio City.

77
00:04:42,611 --> 00:04:45,345
Roger, we should go. Sorry, Lee.

78
00:04:45,413 --> 00:04:49,047
We gotta go. Okay, bye-bye.

79
00:04:55,054 --> 00:04:56,955
Should I type all this up?

80
00:04:57,022 --> 00:05:00,791
Yes, and remind me to remind
Caroline to tell Lane

81
00:05:00,859 --> 00:05:03,094
that Lucky Strike noticed
that they're being billed

82
00:05:03,161 --> 00:05:05,497
for all the work we do for everybody
else at this agency.

83
00:05:05,564 --> 00:05:07,599
You know what?
I don't want that on paper.

84
00:05:13,137 --> 00:05:16,205
- Who is that?
- A dear friend.

85
00:05:16,273 --> 00:05:18,541
Is that the letter from California?

86
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:19,842
Yes.

87
00:05:31,118 --> 00:05:33,986
- I hate this office.
- You wanted to be close to Roger.

88
00:05:34,054 --> 00:05:36,655
Make yourself at home, why don't you?

89
00:05:36,723 --> 00:05:38,623
Did you see Sunday's paper?

90
00:05:38,691 --> 00:05:41,158
If this is about the Playtex ad
they keep complaining about,

91
00:05:41,225 --> 00:05:43,460
I've been told the printer swapped
paper stocks.

92
00:05:43,527 --> 00:05:45,597
And I don't care if she looks like
a Puerto Rican.

93
00:05:45,665 --> 00:05:47,265
Puerto Rican girls buy brassieres.

94
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:49,333
Not that they need to.

95
00:05:49,401 --> 00:05:50,935
I saw this one on the subway

96
00:05:51,002 --> 00:05:53,704
in one of those striped
Jean Seberg shirts,

97
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:56,239
red rag in her hair, nipples...

98
00:05:56,307 --> 00:05:58,741
I'm not in the mood. What do you want?

99
00:05:58,809 --> 00:06:01,777
- Cosgrove's getting married.
- So?

100
00:06:01,845 --> 00:06:03,679
He took us to the opera last month.

101
00:06:03,746 --> 00:06:05,647
Great seats and now I know why.

102
00:06:05,715 --> 00:06:08,583
- It turns out her father shits gold ingots.
- What does he do?

103
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:10,718
C.F.O. of corning.

104
00:06:10,785 --> 00:06:12,385
My father-in-law's a bus driver.

105
00:06:12,453 --> 00:06:14,353
The only place he can
take me is to the moon.

106
00:06:14,421 --> 00:06:17,055
Ken's the competition.
Why are you going to the opera with him?

107
00:06:17,123 --> 00:06:18,990
Geyer is twice our size,

108
00:06:19,058 --> 00:06:20,358
and we're friends, aren't we?

109
00:06:20,425 --> 00:06:22,159
Friends.

110
00:06:22,227 --> 00:06:24,661
Why are you always looking for a job?

111
00:06:24,729 --> 00:06:26,162
What?

112
00:06:28,332 --> 00:06:30,999
Look, Pete.

113
00:06:31,067 --> 00:06:33,701
There's a group of us,
we're all coming up together.

114
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:35,669
You don't think Kenny's a comer?

115
00:06:35,737 --> 00:06:37,704
You know he has mountain dew?
That's Pepsi.

116
00:06:39,506 --> 00:06:41,374
We're having lunch tomorrow.
Tag along.

117
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:44,112
- He always asks about you.
- Of course he does.

118
00:06:44,179 --> 00:06:47,014
Worst case, Kenny'll brag too much
and you can steal a client from him.

119
00:07:02,162 --> 00:07:03,629
Hello.

120
00:07:06,865 --> 00:07:09,333
I'm sorry. That looks like bad news.

121
00:07:09,401 --> 00:07:12,469
Oh, it's not mine. I'm Joyce.

122
00:07:12,537 --> 00:07:14,972
I work at "Life"...
Assistant photo editor.

123
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,840
Peggy Olson,

124
00:07:16,908 --> 00:07:19,309
Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce.
Copywriter.

125
00:07:19,377 --> 00:07:21,611
Really?

126
00:07:21,679 --> 00:07:23,913
"Life" magazine... I love your photos.

127
00:07:23,981 --> 00:07:26,282
Well, you'll never see these.

128
00:07:30,454 --> 00:07:32,621
I have to admit I'd be shocked.

129
00:07:32,689 --> 00:07:35,224
He's my friend and my boss hates nudes.

130
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:37,192
Who hates nudes?

131
00:07:39,528 --> 00:07:41,228
That's a beautiful one.

132
00:07:46,031 --> 00:07:49,231
I'm going to the mailroom.
Peggy, right? 37th floor?

133
00:08:07,311 --> 00:08:09,979
Tom, you're 15 minutes early.

134
00:08:10,046 --> 00:08:11,547
So are you. Sit down.

135
00:08:11,614 --> 00:08:14,049
We can eat anytime or not at all.

136
00:08:14,117 --> 00:08:15,884
Excuse me. Dewar's on the rocks.

137
00:08:17,486 --> 00:08:19,286
What's so important?

138
00:08:20,422 --> 00:08:22,423
Well, Tom,

139
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:24,458
how are you feeling?

140
00:08:24,525 --> 00:08:26,326
Couldn't be better.

141
00:08:28,862 --> 00:08:31,530
I hope you know I've always done
my best to make you happy.

142
00:08:31,597 --> 00:08:33,064
I do.

143
00:08:34,967 --> 00:08:37,602
And there's no reason,
as far as I'm concerned,

144
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:41,104
that there should be any change in the way
that we deal with each other.

145
00:08:41,172 --> 00:08:43,773
Tom, I...

146
00:08:43,841 --> 00:08:46,876
This is very hard for me to say.

147
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,478
I honestly don't know how
you're going to take this

148
00:08:49,545 --> 00:08:51,346
and it's been very hard to separate

149
00:08:51,414 --> 00:08:53,715
our business relationship
from the rest of our life,

150
00:08:53,782 --> 00:08:55,549
but they should be separate.

151
00:08:55,617 --> 00:08:58,385
You are some kind of high wasp, all right.

152
00:08:58,453 --> 00:09:01,087
- Look, I can't keep this up.
- Keep what up?

153
00:09:03,524 --> 00:09:06,058
- I heard.
- You know?

154
00:09:07,627 --> 00:09:09,628
You crazy kid.

155
00:09:13,633 --> 00:09:15,766
What are you talking about?

156
00:09:15,834 --> 00:09:18,269
Jeannie was with Trudy at the doctor.

157
00:09:18,336 --> 00:09:20,071
Congratulations!

158
00:09:21,239 --> 00:09:22,306
What?

159
00:09:24,342 --> 00:09:26,743
Oh, shit.

160
00:09:28,378 --> 00:09:30,713
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

161
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,881
It was Monday, for crying out loud.

162
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:35,283
Why hasn't she told you?

163
00:09:35,351 --> 00:09:37,285
I don't know.

164
00:09:37,352 --> 00:09:39,787
Well, it may be her news,
but it is good news.

165
00:09:39,854 --> 00:09:42,689
You can't tell her that
I told you. You can't.

166
00:09:46,493 --> 00:09:48,494
I'm going to be a father?

167
00:09:48,562 --> 00:09:51,463
- Can you believe it?
- Huh?

168
00:09:53,999 --> 00:09:56,467
- I'm going to be a father.
- Yeah.

169
00:09:58,403 --> 00:09:59,903
I feel like my heart's going to burst.

170
00:10:01,172 --> 00:10:03,039
Champagne right here. Bring a bottle.

171
00:10:03,107 --> 00:10:04,607
We're going to tie one on.

172
00:10:04,675 --> 00:10:06,709
If it's a boy, it's $1,000;

173
00:10:06,777 --> 00:10:08,510
a girl, $500.

174
00:10:08,578 --> 00:10:10,812
I'll do what I can do.

175
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,481
You really can't tell Trudy.

176
00:10:13,549 --> 00:10:15,516
I don't know how I let
the cat out of the bag.

177
00:10:15,584 --> 00:10:18,619
I thought you knew what I was talking about.

178
00:10:18,687 --> 00:10:20,854
What did you think I was talking about?

179
00:10:20,922 --> 00:10:23,189
- What?
- Why did you have to see me?

180
00:10:25,058 --> 00:10:27,593
I just wanted to...

181
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:30,262
We're putting new creative on Clearasil.

182
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:31,729
Oh fine. Who cares?

183
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:36,634
May you know this feeling many times.

184
00:10:39,137 --> 00:10:41,604
Mmm. I only had the one

185
00:10:41,672 --> 00:10:44,440
and I love her to death,
but I wish we'd had more.

186
00:10:46,009 --> 00:10:47,976
Jeannie had her uterus removed...

187
00:10:48,044 --> 00:10:49,778
Some kind of a cyst or something.

188
00:10:53,949 --> 00:10:55,616
Trudy.

189
00:11:02,055 --> 00:11:04,690
I'm sick, Peter. I'm so sick about this.

190
00:11:04,758 --> 00:11:07,592
Daddy just called me from a pay phone
drunk and in tears.

191
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:11,195
I know what you think. I just wanted
to wait till our anniversary to tell you.

192
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:14,264
I don't care, Trudy.

193
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:16,899
I don't care how I heard.

194
00:11:18,935 --> 00:11:20,568
Oh, Peter.

195
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,540
How did this happen?

196
00:11:27,608 --> 00:11:29,374
What did the doctor say?

197
00:11:29,442 --> 00:11:32,043
He said I was going to have a baby.

198
00:11:33,579 --> 00:11:35,712
I want to pick you up
and spin you around,

199
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,614
but I don't want
to damage anything in there.

200
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:41,818
I'm so happy you're happy.

201
00:11:41,885 --> 00:11:44,789
I don't know.
It feels much different than I expected.

202
00:11:44,857 --> 00:11:46,792
How would you know what this feels like?

203
00:11:49,497 --> 00:11:51,399
Come, get off your feet.

204
00:11:52,834 --> 00:11:55,002
- How are you feeling?
- Oh.

205
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:57,537
Tell me you'll forgive my father.

206
00:11:57,605 --> 00:11:58,938
They already think you hate them

207
00:11:59,006 --> 00:12:00,573
and, honestly, it's my fault.

208
00:12:00,641 --> 00:12:02,942
I don't hate them.

209
00:12:03,009 --> 00:12:06,144
I shouldn't have taken my mother
to the doctor... Not that doctor.

210
00:12:06,212 --> 00:12:08,413
It's just I thought something was going on,

211
00:12:08,481 --> 00:12:10,314
and I was so prepared to be disappointed

212
00:12:10,382 --> 00:12:12,550
or that, God forbid,
something was really wrong.

213
00:12:12,617 --> 00:12:15,218
Trudy, I had to talk to him

214
00:12:15,286 --> 00:12:17,687
because the agency has to drop Clearasil.

215
00:12:17,755 --> 00:12:20,890
- Why?
- There's another product that's similar

216
00:12:20,957 --> 00:12:23,025
- and we can't...
- A conflict.

217
00:12:23,093 --> 00:12:25,293
Peter, I'm familiar with the term.
You use it all the time.

218
00:12:25,361 --> 00:12:27,629
I invited him there

219
00:12:27,696 --> 00:12:29,430
and his good news
trumped my bad news.

220
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:31,732
And the funny thing is, that was
the moment to tell him.

221
00:12:32,867 --> 00:12:34,734
I was so bowled over.

222
00:12:38,605 --> 00:12:40,206
We did it.

223
00:12:44,377 --> 00:12:46,811
Why don't you let my father
hear this from me?

224
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:49,647
He's already so guilty,
he'll never feel the knife go in.

225
00:12:49,715 --> 00:12:51,649
I can't let you do that.

226
00:12:51,716 --> 00:12:55,118
But I'm the one who talked him
into returning to the agency to begin with.

227
00:12:55,186 --> 00:12:58,121
- We needed him.
- And now you don't.

228
00:12:58,188 --> 00:13:00,789
He'll be fine. Tomorrow night.

229
00:13:00,857 --> 00:13:03,125
Yankee pot roast.

230
00:13:11,466 --> 00:13:13,801
Let's go. Caroline will
be watching your desk.

231
00:13:13,869 --> 00:13:15,703
Why don't you have to do this?

232
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:17,704
You don't have to do this.
You're getting paid.

233
00:13:17,772 --> 00:13:21,107
We're old and we're married.
They don't want us.

234
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:23,909
But I use Pond's. I do.

235
00:13:23,977 --> 00:13:25,344
Come on.

236
00:13:30,149 --> 00:13:31,650
Girls, find your places.

237
00:13:31,717 --> 00:13:33,318
Megan, help me with the curtains.

238
00:13:44,261 --> 00:13:46,762
No matter how late I come,
I'm always waiting for someone.

239
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:52,534
I had to wait until the girls left
the ladies' room to change.

240
00:13:52,602 --> 00:13:54,969
You could've used my office,
but I don't have one.

241
00:13:58,374 --> 00:14:01,476
- This isn't right.
- I thought you wanted "Faye," not "Dr. Miller."

242
00:14:01,543 --> 00:14:04,644
Yes, but I told someone to leave
the "e" off of "Faye."

243
00:14:04,712 --> 00:14:08,046
I like to be able to correct it in front
of the girls. It makes them trust me.

244
00:14:08,114 --> 00:14:10,014
Because your name is spelled wrong?

245
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:13,084
Because I'm obviously not that important.
I don't need it.

246
00:14:16,454 --> 00:14:19,957
- I have to warn you. There's lots of perfume.
- There always is.

247
00:14:34,436 --> 00:14:36,236
Why, everyone has a nifty name tag.

248
00:14:36,304 --> 00:14:40,540
Very well then. I suppose I'll work
in Mr. Sterling's office.

249
00:14:40,608 --> 00:14:42,375
He won't be coming.

250
00:14:42,443 --> 00:14:44,444
As I said, my name is Faye.

251
00:14:47,247 --> 00:14:48,915
I don't have a name tag.

252
00:14:48,982 --> 00:14:50,449
I guess they forgot about me.

253
00:14:53,553 --> 00:14:55,120
Well, they got mine wrong.

254
00:14:55,188 --> 00:14:56,689
I'm Dotty.

255
00:14:56,757 --> 00:14:58,858
I mean I'm not a dotty person.

256
00:14:58,926 --> 00:15:01,727
That's my name.

257
00:15:01,795 --> 00:15:03,862
Hello, Dotty.

258
00:15:05,164 --> 00:15:08,000
So there's no reason to be anxious.

259
00:15:08,067 --> 00:15:11,802
We have to enjoy the fact that we're
all getting paid not to work for a little bit.

260
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:16,439
But don't worry, that's our little secret.

261
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,776
And I'd like you to think that this is

262
00:15:19,843 --> 00:15:21,277
just a bunch of your friends,

263
00:15:21,345 --> 00:15:24,714
as if maybe this is a sorority

264
00:15:24,782 --> 00:15:28,584
or a bridal shower... With tea.

265
00:15:28,652 --> 00:15:32,187
Or just a bunch of us celebrating, say,

266
00:15:32,255 --> 00:15:34,423
Allison's birthday at my apartment.

267
00:15:36,792 --> 00:15:39,460
You shouldn't be surprised,

268
00:15:39,528 --> 00:15:41,062
looking around the room,

269
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:44,199
that we're here to talk about

270
00:15:45,368 --> 00:15:46,501
beauty.

271
00:15:48,404 --> 00:15:50,806
What are the things we all do

272
00:15:50,873 --> 00:15:52,540
to keep ourselves beautiful

273
00:15:52,608 --> 00:15:54,909
or simply to enhance it?

274
00:15:54,977 --> 00:15:56,144
Please pass a Danish.

275
00:15:59,248 --> 00:16:01,249
You don't have to raise your hand.

276
00:16:01,317 --> 00:16:02,517
Anyone?

277
00:16:03,786 --> 00:16:05,587
I can say it.

278
00:16:05,655 --> 00:16:07,756
I have a routine.

279
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:11,259
I brush my hair 100 times

280
00:16:11,327 --> 00:16:13,895
just like I did when I was a little girl,

281
00:16:13,963 --> 00:16:16,164
but of course only the night before.

282
00:16:16,231 --> 00:16:18,632
I have it set.

283
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,902
- Very cute.
- Can you imagine?

284
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:24,004
Your financial future's in the hands

285
00:16:24,072 --> 00:16:26,207
of a roomful of 22-year-old girls.

286
00:16:26,274 --> 00:16:27,975
Not mine.

287
00:16:31,515 --> 00:16:32,916
Okay.

288
00:16:32,983 --> 00:16:34,684
Sometimes I watch my weight.

289
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:38,586
No one's hungry?

290
00:16:42,423 --> 00:16:44,523
I'd like a Danish.

291
00:16:44,591 --> 00:16:47,725
I don't use Pond's if
that's what you're asking.

292
00:16:47,793 --> 00:16:50,260
Mmm, that's okay.

293
00:16:50,328 --> 00:16:53,029
I'm of French extraction and
my mother has beautiful skin.

294
00:16:53,097 --> 00:16:55,165
She never washes her face.

295
00:16:55,232 --> 00:16:58,500
She's not dirty.
She uses water, but nothing else.

296
00:16:58,568 --> 00:17:01,202
And you do what she does?

297
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,137
What does she do?

298
00:17:04,972 --> 00:17:08,040
She stands at the sink
and she runs the water

299
00:17:08,108 --> 00:17:10,976
until it's just the perfect temperature.
Not too hot.

300
00:17:11,044 --> 00:17:12,745
And she splashes it on her face

301
00:17:12,813 --> 00:17:15,782
and she pats her cheeks
with her fingertips.

302
00:17:17,486 --> 00:17:19,355
And she looks at herself?

303
00:17:20,861 --> 00:17:22,466
Yes, she does.

304
00:17:26,074 --> 00:17:28,775
She's amazing.

305
00:17:28,842 --> 00:17:30,843
I sit at my vanity

306
00:17:30,911 --> 00:17:32,378
and I have this night cream...

307
00:17:32,446 --> 00:17:34,348
My boyfriend laughed at me.

308
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:36,587
What was so funny about it?

309
00:17:36,654 --> 00:17:39,763
It was just, you know, one time.

310
00:17:39,831 --> 00:17:41,703
At Christmas Eve
we were staying up late

311
00:17:41,771 --> 00:17:43,638
and we were playing house, I guess.

312
00:17:45,441 --> 00:17:48,776
You shouldn't do things for them.
They don't appreciate it.

313
00:17:48,843 --> 00:17:51,411
You don't think they appreciate
you being beautiful?

314
00:17:51,478 --> 00:17:53,612
We broke up a year ago.

315
00:17:56,449 --> 00:17:58,616
Actually, I don't know what he noticed,

316
00:17:58,684 --> 00:18:00,718
but it wasn't me, I guess.

317
00:18:00,786 --> 00:18:02,820
It's worse when they notice, sometimes.

318
00:18:04,255 --> 00:18:06,690
Allison, please continue.

319
00:18:08,426 --> 00:18:10,026
It... It's nothing.

320
00:18:18,966 --> 00:18:20,966
- Are you in there?
- Yes.

321
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:24,835
I asked your girl to
inform me of your arrival.

322
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:26,470
She's in that group.

323
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:28,673
Did you speak with Tom?

324
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,574
I'm sorry. It didn't happen.

325
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:32,309
The opportunity passed.

326
00:18:32,376 --> 00:18:34,544
Well, then we shall endeavor to recreate it.

327
00:18:34,611 --> 00:18:36,512
Perhaps lunch today?

328
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,914
I'm afraid Roger has
already informed pond's

329
00:18:38,982 --> 00:18:40,615
that this was attended to.

330
00:18:41,817 --> 00:18:43,518
That's sloppy.

331
00:18:43,585 --> 00:18:46,253
I have a lunch,
but I'm seeing him tonight.

332
00:18:46,321 --> 00:18:47,821
Damn it.

333
00:18:50,258 --> 00:18:51,658
Lane.

334
00:18:54,261 --> 00:18:56,562
I just found out I'm going to be a father.

335
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:59,131
Well now, that should
take the sting out of all of this.

336
00:19:00,366 --> 00:19:02,300
I suppose.

337
00:19:03,468 --> 00:19:06,404
Uh, I apologize.

338
00:19:07,773 --> 00:19:10,073
That's the very best news.

339
00:19:12,909 --> 00:19:15,176
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

340
00:19:26,751 --> 00:19:28,318
And I just kept thinking

341
00:19:28,386 --> 00:19:30,286
"why does he stare at other girls?"

342
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,721
Well, men do that, but...

343
00:19:34,789 --> 00:19:36,656
But does he look at me that way?

344
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:41,693
And we're not married, so who am I?

345
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,095
How the hell did this get so sad so fast?

346
00:19:44,163 --> 00:19:46,697
- Shh!
- I know I'm speaking

347
00:19:46,764 --> 00:19:48,832
for everyone here.

348
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,902
You can't think it has anything to do

349
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:52,338
with how you look, Dotty.

350
00:19:52,406 --> 00:19:54,006
You can only do your best

351
00:19:54,074 --> 00:19:55,541
with what God gave you.

352
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:58,944
What about makeup?

353
00:20:00,947 --> 00:20:03,515
I feel like it doesn't matter what I see.

354
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,984
It matters what he sees.

355
00:20:09,391 --> 00:20:11,327
I feel like I gave him everything

356
00:20:11,395 --> 00:20:13,030
and I got nothing.

357
00:20:13,098 --> 00:20:15,232
Oh.

358
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,467
I could see she was gonna crack.

359
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:19,469
Allison?

360
00:20:19,536 --> 00:20:21,170
Are you all right, dear?

361
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:29,577
- It's okay. She'll be all right.
- Should I...

362
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,412
If she wanted to be around us,
she would've stayed.

363
00:20:33,715 --> 00:20:38,051
Sarah, what do you do that makes
you feel good about the way you look?

364
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:39,852
I feel kind of responsible.
Do you mind?

365
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:46,091
Is there any kind of ritual?

366
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:48,559
I think my strategy was right.

367
00:20:48,627 --> 00:20:50,261
They just want to get married

368
00:20:50,329 --> 00:20:51,929
and they'll buy anything that'll help.

369
00:20:56,234 --> 00:20:59,936
- Are you all right?
- Oh, it's you.

370
00:21:00,004 --> 00:21:01,505
Come with me.

371
00:21:09,949 --> 00:21:13,518
People cry in these things
all the time... Grown men.

372
00:21:13,586 --> 00:21:15,853
I was in a bunch when I
first started working here.

373
00:21:15,921 --> 00:21:18,054
I'd say half the time somebody cries.

374
00:21:18,122 --> 00:21:20,556
Really?

375
00:21:20,624 --> 00:21:23,058
I think it just feels good to talk.

376
00:21:23,126 --> 00:21:24,759
I can't even say anything

377
00:21:24,827 --> 00:21:26,561
because I know he's right out there,

378
00:21:26,629 --> 00:21:27,929
right through the glass.

379
00:21:29,198 --> 00:21:30,431
Who?

380
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:33,065
I don't know how you stand it.

381
00:21:33,133 --> 00:21:36,034
The way he turns on the charm one minute

382
00:21:36,102 --> 00:21:37,669
and then yanks it away.

383
00:21:37,737 --> 00:21:39,137
How can you even talk to him?

384
00:21:39,205 --> 00:21:40,805
Don?

385
00:21:40,873 --> 00:21:42,640
Would you stop it?

386
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:46,410
I realize you must've gone through
everything I've gone through.

387
00:21:46,477 --> 00:21:49,112
But now I know.
It's just... he's a drunk.

388
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:52,282
And they get away with murder
because they forget everything.

389
00:21:53,651 --> 00:21:55,885
I don't know what you think.

390
00:21:58,354 --> 00:22:00,688
Forget it.

391
00:22:00,756 --> 00:22:03,624
Your problem is not my problem.

392
00:22:03,692 --> 00:22:06,660
- Fine.
- And honestly, you should get over it.

393
00:22:06,728 --> 00:22:08,662
Please leave me alone.

394
00:22:15,101 --> 00:22:16,969
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

395
00:22:17,036 --> 00:22:18,036
- Bye.
- Bye.

396
00:22:20,073 --> 00:22:23,573
- Did she go home?
- No, she's fine.

397
00:22:23,641 --> 00:22:25,675
Nothing else good happened.

398
00:22:25,743 --> 00:22:27,877
- Bye now.
- Bye-bye.

399
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,947
That went very well.

400
00:22:32,483 --> 00:22:33,916
You can stop the tape.

401
00:22:37,421 --> 00:22:39,021
Is she okay

402
00:22:39,089 --> 00:22:40,889
- Who?
- Yeah, she's fine.

403
00:22:43,959 --> 00:22:47,462
All right. Let's talk preliminary results.

404
00:22:47,529 --> 00:22:50,497
Is it all right if we put this back
the way it goes?

405
00:22:52,666 --> 00:22:55,701
- We can go to my office.
- Let's go in there.

406
00:23:07,172 --> 00:23:08,673
That's big big news.

407
00:23:08,741 --> 00:23:10,708
If you need any baby crap,
Jen and I have a closetful.

408
00:23:12,244 --> 00:23:14,479
- Hello, fellas.
- Good to see you, Kenny.

409
00:23:14,547 --> 00:23:16,014
- Pete.
- How are you, Ken?

410
00:23:19,117 --> 00:23:21,418
- Mr. Crane.
- Over here, Gil.

411
00:23:21,486 --> 00:23:23,120
There's a phone call for you.

412
00:23:23,187 --> 00:23:25,055
I've gotta get this.

413
00:23:25,122 --> 00:23:27,490
Those goniffs at C.B.S.
are screwing me again.

414
00:23:27,558 --> 00:23:30,392
- Those what?
- Order for me... Caesar salad, no dressing.

415
00:23:33,796 --> 00:23:35,096
- Ah.
- You want to take a look?

416
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:36,697
Sure.

417
00:23:44,839 --> 00:23:47,373
Listen. I've got to get this out of the way.

418
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,943
But I would appreciate it for the future

419
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:53,311
if you would not say shitty things
about me behind my back.

420
00:23:54,513 --> 00:23:55,980
What?

421
00:23:56,048 --> 00:23:58,349
Come on. Are you gonna
deny it and make it worse?

422
00:23:58,416 --> 00:24:00,517
I don't know what you've heard,
but it's not true.

423
00:24:00,585 --> 00:24:03,219
You didn't call me an all-american idiot

424
00:24:03,287 --> 00:24:04,620
who fell into everything?

425
00:24:05,989 --> 00:24:07,889
Whom did I supposedly say this to?

426
00:24:07,957 --> 00:24:09,357
Does it matter?

427
00:24:09,425 --> 00:24:12,293
Well, I'd like to defend myself.

428
00:24:12,361 --> 00:24:14,995
I heard that you told your wife
that I was driving the tractor

429
00:24:15,063 --> 00:24:17,263
- when the accident happened.
- What?

430
00:24:17,331 --> 00:24:19,232
I don't think so.

431
00:24:19,299 --> 00:24:21,868
What I probably said was
that you were involved...

432
00:24:21,936 --> 00:24:25,171
We all were...
And that it was your account.

433
00:24:25,239 --> 00:24:28,173
And Crane told me yesterday
you said I was marrying for money.

434
00:24:28,241 --> 00:24:30,742
I didn't say that. He did.

435
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:33,210
Well, he's like that and everybody
who knows him knows that.

436
00:24:33,278 --> 00:24:36,079
But when you say it... And especially
when it gets back to my fiancee...

437
00:24:36,147 --> 00:24:38,947
Trudy knows her, you know...
Some garden club.

438
00:24:40,749 --> 00:24:42,416
I was unaware of that.

439
00:24:42,483 --> 00:24:44,517
Look. You know what?

440
00:24:46,753 --> 00:24:49,220
I apologize... Mea culpa.

441
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:52,990
That's textbook Harry.

442
00:24:54,458 --> 00:24:56,158
You know what? He's buying lunch.

443
00:24:56,226 --> 00:24:59,929
I don't really care.
I'm just glad to be out of the office.

444
00:24:59,996 --> 00:25:02,632
Mmm, it is nice, especially without
having to listen

445
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:05,402
to some client yammering
about how dirty the city is.

446
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:08,472
- Huh.
- How's it going?

447
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,307
I've been floating along laterally,

448
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:12,409
but I don't know that it's a love affair.

449
00:25:12,476 --> 00:25:14,911
- It's better than McCann.
- What was that like?

450
00:25:14,979 --> 00:25:17,180
Are you kidding me?
It's the worst agency I've ever seen.

451
00:25:17,248 --> 00:25:18,681
The worst.

452
00:25:18,749 --> 00:25:21,184
My mother was a nurse at the
State Hospital in Vermont

453
00:25:21,252 --> 00:25:24,121
and that was the last time I saw
so many retarded people in one building.

454
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:32,896
So you're getting married.
Congratulations.

455
00:25:32,963 --> 00:25:34,731
It's all that really matters, right?

456
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,702
Actually, I have a bit of news of my own.

457
00:25:41,437 --> 00:25:42,871
Trudy is with child.

458
00:25:42,939 --> 00:25:46,042
Good for you. Good for you.

459
00:25:46,109 --> 00:25:48,246
I'll be honest... I can't wait.

460
00:25:48,314 --> 00:25:51,351
It's very good so far.

461
00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:54,389
Hmm. A new family, a new agency...

462
00:25:54,456 --> 00:25:55,690
It has to be exciting.

463
00:25:55,758 --> 00:25:57,959
Well, you know, wherever you do this job,

464
00:25:58,027 --> 00:25:59,627
you're doing this job.

465
00:25:59,695 --> 00:26:02,263
I know you're all slaves
to Draper over there,

466
00:26:02,331 --> 00:26:05,933
but I'd rather be a slave to creative
than some old fart.

467
00:26:06,001 --> 00:26:08,402
Whoever pours the last drink
gets all the credit

468
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:10,805
and you're spinning your wheels
half the time.

469
00:26:12,574 --> 00:26:14,508
Right now we're chasing Mountain dew.

470
00:26:14,576 --> 00:26:16,777
Supposedly we're going
to turn it into Pepsi,

471
00:26:16,845 --> 00:26:18,278
but the only reason Pepsi would do it

472
00:26:18,346 --> 00:26:20,047
is to make B.B.D.O. sweat.

473
00:26:20,114 --> 00:26:23,450
This whole idea that we'd get
the bigger company is a joke.

474
00:26:23,517 --> 00:26:26,319
We'd just end up with
a bunch of little pieces.

475
00:26:29,423 --> 00:26:32,692
Well, the grass is always greener.

476
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,794
Oh, who am I kidding?

477
00:26:34,862 --> 00:26:36,996
Look how lucky we are.

478
00:26:37,063 --> 00:26:39,498
Another Campbell...

479
00:26:39,565 --> 00:26:41,567
That's just what the world needs.

480
00:26:41,635 --> 00:26:42,902
Huh.

481
00:26:54,983 --> 00:26:58,052
- Can I come in?
- It's your office.

482
00:26:58,119 --> 00:26:59,920
Glad to see you're feeling better.

483
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:04,624
If you don't feel like working...

484
00:27:16,436 --> 00:27:17,770
What?

485
00:27:17,837 --> 00:27:20,873
I'm very embarrassed.

486
00:27:20,941 --> 00:27:23,442
People cry in those groups
all the time, Allison.

487
00:27:24,745 --> 00:27:26,812
That's not what I'm embarrassed about.

488
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:31,450
This actually happened.

489
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,020
I know.

490
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:38,324
I know.

491
00:27:38,392 --> 00:27:40,426
We made a mistake

492
00:27:41,695 --> 00:27:45,064
and I feel like it's awkward

493
00:27:45,132 --> 00:27:49,001
and it's better for both of us if I move on.

494
00:27:49,069 --> 00:27:51,904
I don't think that's necessary.
We're both adults.

495
00:27:51,972 --> 00:27:54,440
No, I really would feel better about it.

496
00:27:54,507 --> 00:27:58,476
A friend of mine told me
about a job at a magazine

497
00:27:58,544 --> 00:28:02,547
and I thought that might be interesting,
working for a woman.

498
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:05,750
Anyway, I...

499
00:28:07,753 --> 00:28:10,755
I would appreciate it if you could
write me a recommendation.

500
00:28:10,823 --> 00:28:13,491
Absolutely.
What would probably be even better

501
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:16,060
is if you type up whatever you want
and I'll sign it.

502
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:20,631
- What?
- You've been sparkling in your duties.

503
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:22,934
Just put it on my stationery,
put whatever you want and I'll sign it.

504
00:28:37,183 --> 00:28:39,317
I don't say this easily,

505
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:41,919
but you're not a good person.

506
00:28:45,291 --> 00:28:46,892
Allison, hold on.

507
00:29:03,911 --> 00:29:05,411
What's going on?

508
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,615
I'm gonna need a new secretary.

509
00:29:08,683 --> 00:29:11,385
And this cleaned up.

510
00:29:11,452 --> 00:29:15,688
Would you be open to Allison
returning in a couple of days?

511
00:29:15,756 --> 00:29:17,656
If that's what she wants.

512
00:29:17,724 --> 00:29:19,124
Really?

513
00:29:19,192 --> 00:29:21,059
No.

514
00:29:46,086 --> 00:29:49,055
There's a Joyce Ramsey
to see you at reception.

515
00:29:52,127 --> 00:29:55,095
So at this point you've
read everything out here?

516
00:29:55,163 --> 00:29:57,497
I don't even like magazines,

517
00:29:57,565 --> 00:30:00,233
but I brought in a book
and they told me it didn't look right.

518
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,502
Hi.

519
00:30:02,569 --> 00:30:04,771
Do you want to come back
and see my office?

520
00:30:04,838 --> 00:30:06,940
Another time.

521
00:30:07,007 --> 00:30:08,774
Listen, my friend the photographer,

522
00:30:08,842 --> 00:30:11,276
Mr. Reject, he's having a...

523
00:30:11,344 --> 00:30:14,145
I don't even know what to call it...
Downtown.

524
00:30:15,581 --> 00:30:16,714
Are you inviting me?

525
00:30:19,852 --> 00:30:21,919
- Are you afraid of the subway?
- Of course not.

526
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:24,889
Thanks, sweetheart.

527
00:30:24,957 --> 00:30:27,091
Washington market,

528
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:31,195
unless you have to work or have
plans that are more interesting.

529
00:30:31,263 --> 00:30:34,331
It starts at 9:00. I'll be there at 10:00.

530
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:41,004
She's kind of pretentious.

531
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:42,939
I know.

532
00:30:49,502 --> 00:30:52,771
Darling, we're so excited.

533
00:30:52,839 --> 00:30:55,308
Is that you, Peter?

534
00:30:55,375 --> 00:30:57,143
I'm gonna keep my mouth shut from now on.

535
00:30:59,946 --> 00:31:02,046
Well, hello there.

536
00:31:02,114 --> 00:31:03,982
How are you feeling?

537
00:31:04,049 --> 00:31:06,985
A little behind. Why don't you let me
fix my father and you a drink

538
00:31:07,052 --> 00:31:09,921
and you can show my mother what
we have planned for the maid's room.

539
00:31:09,988 --> 00:31:11,388
I'll make the drinks. I don't care.

540
00:31:11,456 --> 00:31:13,657
No, why don't you show
your mother the maid's room?

541
00:31:13,725 --> 00:31:15,258
I don't know that I'm an expert.

542
00:31:15,326 --> 00:31:16,794
Oh, okay.

543
00:31:16,861 --> 00:31:18,696
Come along, mother.

544
00:31:21,167 --> 00:31:22,867
We're a couple of lucky ducks, aren't we?

545
00:31:22,935 --> 00:31:25,302
We are. Tom, let me ask you something.

546
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:27,938
- What are you having?
- In a minute. Listen...

547
00:31:28,006 --> 00:31:31,275
Oh, I know what you're gonna say.

548
00:31:31,342 --> 00:31:33,576
You need a bigger apartment. I get it.

549
00:31:33,643 --> 00:31:36,808
Every time you jump to conclusions, Tom,
you make me respect you less.

550
00:31:36,876 --> 00:31:38,941
- What?
- Look.

551
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:41,342
You gave us Clearasil and
we're extremely grateful,

552
00:31:41,409 --> 00:31:43,443
but there's only so much business
it's going to do.

553
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:45,744
Yeah, well, that's kind
of in your hands, isn't it?

554
00:31:45,811 --> 00:31:47,379
I'm done auditioning.

555
00:31:49,414 --> 00:31:51,582
You gave us this under a certain pretext.

556
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:53,687
I've done well by you. And the idea was

557
00:31:53,755 --> 00:31:55,422
if we do well by this account,

558
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:57,490
you'll give us a shot at the big one,

559
00:31:57,558 --> 00:32:00,127
because right now I have
bigger business than Clearasil.

560
00:32:00,195 --> 00:32:02,063
Are you mad at me?

561
00:32:02,131 --> 00:32:06,167
No. Clearasil was conflicted out by
a bigger company

562
00:32:06,235 --> 00:32:08,569
and I'm trying to build a business here.

563
00:32:08,637 --> 00:32:10,437
Well, what do you want?

564
00:32:10,505 --> 00:32:12,339
Do you want the cough syrup?

565
00:32:12,406 --> 00:32:15,641
I want all of it. I want
the formula 44 mixture,

566
00:32:15,709 --> 00:32:19,780
the cough drops, the inhaler, Vaporub.

567
00:32:19,848 --> 00:32:22,482
Who's doing a better job
for you than I have?

568
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:26,318
Well, you've given me
something to think about.

569
00:32:27,453 --> 00:32:28,886
Really?

570
00:32:28,954 --> 00:32:30,521
I think it's pretty simple.

571
00:32:30,589 --> 00:32:31,722
What can I get you?

572
00:32:34,693 --> 00:32:37,028
Trudy, do we have any ice?

573
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:40,864
You son of a bitch.

574
00:32:44,167 --> 00:32:46,267
Tom, you have to come see this.

575
00:33:51,334 --> 00:33:52,334
Joyce!

576
00:33:54,304 --> 00:33:57,740
- I made it.
- You look so elegant.

577
00:33:57,808 --> 00:33:59,776
Okay.

578
00:33:59,843 --> 00:34:01,711
Peggy works in the same building.

579
00:34:01,779 --> 00:34:04,247
Sharon was one of Davey's models.

580
00:34:04,315 --> 00:34:06,049
What did your mother say?

581
00:34:06,117 --> 00:34:07,951
Oh, she doesn't know.

582
00:34:11,122 --> 00:34:14,558
- What is that?
- He screws around with movies too.

583
00:34:14,626 --> 00:34:16,694
He's not as good at it.

584
00:34:16,761 --> 00:34:18,962
I can't believe how big this place is.

585
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:21,098
I think it was a sweatshop.

586
00:34:21,166 --> 00:34:23,067
Is there beer or something?

587
00:34:23,135 --> 00:34:25,236
I thought I saw someone with a beer.

588
00:34:26,405 --> 00:34:28,206
Jesus.

589
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:29,942
I thought I needed a lot of attention.

590
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:34,914
Listen, I'm already high,

591
00:34:34,982 --> 00:34:37,784
but this is easier than finding a beer.

592
00:34:37,852 --> 00:34:39,152
If you'd like?

593
00:34:40,488 --> 00:34:42,155
I'd love it.

594
00:34:52,565 --> 00:34:54,299
Hey!

595
00:34:55,834 --> 00:34:56,968
I'm hungry.

596
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,642
I have a boyfriend.

597
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:04,044
He doesn't own your vagina.

598
00:35:05,446 --> 00:35:07,414
No, but he's renting it.

599
00:36:20,959 --> 00:36:23,626
This film is more interesting
than I thought.

600
00:36:23,693 --> 00:36:25,593
It's rhythmic.

601
00:36:25,661 --> 00:36:27,027
Yeah.

602
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:33,632
I thought I was gonna get to meet him.

603
00:36:36,101 --> 00:36:37,569
Abe!

604
00:36:39,939 --> 00:36:41,906
Where the hell's Kellogg?

605
00:36:44,177 --> 00:36:46,378
Hey. Abe.

606
00:36:46,446 --> 00:36:48,914
- Are you with Joyce?
- Are you?

607
00:36:48,982 --> 00:36:51,817
- I'm Peggy.
- Peggy's a writer.

608
00:36:51,885 --> 00:36:53,352
So am I. What do you write?

609
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,287
I'm a copywriter.

610
00:36:55,355 --> 00:36:56,922
But what do you write?

611
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:58,857
That is writing.

612
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:00,525
You're not working on something else?

613
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:04,830
Davey Kellogg, this is Peggy Olson.

614
00:37:04,897 --> 00:37:07,465
- She wanted to meet you.
- I'm catholic.

615
00:37:07,533 --> 00:37:09,301
So do you like it?

616
00:37:09,368 --> 00:37:12,003
I don't think I'm supposed to.

617
00:37:12,071 --> 00:37:14,972
I love your nudes.
We're looking for photographers.

618
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,208
I'm glad I was here to see this.

619
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:20,878
- Who's "we"?
- I work at Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce.

620
00:37:20,946 --> 00:37:24,148
- Advertising.
- Why would I ever do that?

621
00:37:24,216 --> 00:37:26,851
So you can get paid to practice your art.

622
00:37:26,919 --> 00:37:29,287
Art in advertising?

623
00:37:29,355 --> 00:37:31,723
Why would anyone do that after Warhol?

624
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:35,726
Sorry, for somebody to sell their soul,

625
00:37:35,794 --> 00:37:38,796
they've got to have one.

626
00:37:38,863 --> 00:37:41,164
- It's a raid!
- It's the N.Y.P.D.!

627
00:37:43,501 --> 00:37:45,035
This way.

628
00:37:45,103 --> 00:37:46,403
Wait wait.

629
00:37:53,411 --> 00:37:55,411
This is the N.Y.P.D.! Stop!

630
00:37:57,615 --> 00:37:59,181
Nobody move!

631
00:37:59,249 --> 00:38:02,485
You know, I've been arrested before.

632
00:38:02,552 --> 00:38:04,586
For what?

633
00:38:04,654 --> 00:38:07,823
I was writing about
this boycott in Harlem

634
00:38:07,891 --> 00:38:11,493
and they wouldn't leave,
so I didn't leave.

635
00:38:11,561 --> 00:38:13,495
Oh. Did you go to jail?

636
00:38:15,031 --> 00:38:17,198
No.

637
00:38:17,266 --> 00:38:19,067
My sister came and got me.

638
00:38:22,304 --> 00:38:24,371
I feel like I should kiss you.

639
00:38:39,586 --> 00:38:41,253
Come on.

640
00:38:45,124 --> 00:38:47,325
They chased everybody
down the fire escape.

641
00:38:50,896 --> 00:38:53,832
- Are they beating people?
- They took the film.

642
00:38:53,899 --> 00:38:56,034
I should see this. It could be a story.

643
00:38:56,101 --> 00:38:58,636
- How can I find you?
- I know where she is.

644
00:39:29,662 --> 00:39:31,061
Nice to see you, Miss Blankenship.

645
00:39:31,129 --> 00:39:33,795
I look forward to hearing that every day.

646
00:39:33,863 --> 00:39:36,330
There's coffee and a roll on your desk

647
00:39:36,398 --> 00:39:38,131
and Mr. Sterling would like to see you.

648
00:39:38,199 --> 00:39:40,399
Roger, he's here.

649
00:39:41,701 --> 00:39:42,901
Could you get the others?

650
00:39:48,706 --> 00:39:50,774
Blankenship? Boy.

651
00:39:50,842 --> 00:39:53,076
Hello? Could you fetch Campbell

652
00:39:53,144 --> 00:39:56,446
and Pryce, Lane... Misters.

653
00:39:56,514 --> 00:39:58,782
What did you do to make them
take her out of mothballs?

654
00:39:58,850 --> 00:40:00,550
She was working in Cooper's apartment.

655
00:40:00,618 --> 00:40:02,952
Allison found a better opportunity.

656
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:04,554
Do you know he works without pants?

657
00:40:04,622 --> 00:40:06,355
Morning, Don.

658
00:40:06,423 --> 00:40:08,257
- Don.
- Morning.

659
00:40:08,325 --> 00:40:10,826
I'd like to say in front of this
informal partners' meeting

660
00:40:10,893 --> 00:40:13,028
that I am in the midst
of signing Vicks chemical...

661
00:40:13,095 --> 00:40:16,031
The entire cough line.
It bills at around $6 million

662
00:40:16,098 --> 00:40:19,200
- and they love television.
- It's truly spectacular news.

663
00:40:19,268 --> 00:40:21,269
Congratulations. How'd you swing that?

664
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:22,937
I guess as the president would say,

665
00:40:23,005 --> 00:40:24,906
I turned chickenshit into chicken salad.

666
00:40:24,974 --> 00:40:26,842
I thought I'd kick Clearasil over to Geyer.

667
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:28,911
Anyone but Chaough.

668
00:40:28,979 --> 00:40:32,280
We're taking Philip Coakmeyer
and Tom Vogel to luncheon today.

669
00:40:32,348 --> 00:40:34,782
Don't worry, we already checked it
with your, uh, girl.

670
00:40:37,686 --> 00:40:39,586
- Keep it up.
- Thank you, Don.

671
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:47,328
Please reschedule Dr. Miller.

672
00:40:50,999 --> 00:40:53,201
They're not really pornography, per se.

673
00:40:53,269 --> 00:40:55,303
They're just nudes.

674
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:57,440
They're like renaissance paintings.

675
00:40:57,508 --> 00:41:00,912
The party sounds fun.
We had nude models in school.

676
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:03,915
You know right away whoever
has the best drawing is going to get her.

677
00:41:03,982 --> 00:41:06,450
Did you know Malcolm X
was shot last Sunday?

678
00:41:06,518 --> 00:41:08,218
Yes, Peggy.

679
00:41:08,286 --> 00:41:09,886
Did you know who he was?

680
00:41:09,954 --> 00:41:12,055
You ever read the stuff
between the ads?

681
00:41:12,122 --> 00:41:15,158
A few of us are sending a bottle
of champagne to the Campbells.

682
00:41:15,226 --> 00:41:17,193
I'll sign the card.

683
00:41:17,261 --> 00:41:19,995
- I was hoping for a contribution.
- No thank you.

684
00:41:29,272 --> 00:41:31,707
- Trudy's pregnant?
- Mm-hmm.

685
00:41:31,775 --> 00:41:33,876
I can't believe that guy's married to her.

686
00:41:38,584 --> 00:41:40,419
I would get her so pregnant.

687
00:41:52,275 --> 00:41:53,842
Hello.

688
00:41:53,909 --> 00:41:56,245
Congratulations.

689
00:41:56,313 --> 00:41:58,114
Yes.

690
00:41:58,181 --> 00:42:00,917
A $6-million account should
shut Lane up for a while.

691
00:42:00,985 --> 00:42:03,319
No, I mean about the baby.

692
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:09,493
Yes. I guess that's news.

693
00:42:09,561 --> 00:42:12,964
I just wanted to let you know
how happy I am for you...

694
00:42:13,032 --> 00:42:14,633
Both.

695
00:42:16,938 --> 00:42:18,607
Thank you.

696
00:42:49,529 --> 00:42:52,530
Dr. Miller is here to see you.

697
00:42:52,598 --> 00:42:54,699
It's a she.

698
00:42:56,502 --> 00:42:58,003
Send her in.

699
00:43:05,145 --> 00:43:07,913
- What do you want?
- Nothing. I moved the meeting.

700
00:43:07,981 --> 00:43:11,250
Oh, your secretary said you needed
to see me immediately.

701
00:43:14,588 --> 00:43:17,490
We're still working things out.

702
00:43:17,557 --> 00:43:19,959
Well, I've done everything
but finish the report.

703
00:43:20,026 --> 00:43:21,994
How'd we do?

704
00:43:22,061 --> 00:43:25,630
Well, it turns out
the hypothesis was rejected.

705
00:43:25,697 --> 00:43:28,032
I'd recommend a strategy that links

706
00:43:28,099 --> 00:43:30,034
Pnd's cold cream to matrimony...

707
00:43:30,102 --> 00:43:32,604
A veiled promise.

708
00:43:32,672 --> 00:43:34,339
Hello, 1925.

709
00:43:35,742 --> 00:43:37,443
I'm not gonna do that,

710
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:39,278
so what are we gonna tell the client?

711
00:43:40,747 --> 00:43:42,548
I can't change the truth.

712
00:43:42,615 --> 00:43:45,050
How do you know that's the truth?

713
00:43:45,118 --> 00:43:47,553
A new idea is something
they don't know yet,

714
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:50,022
so of course it's not gonna
come up as an option.

715
00:43:50,089 --> 00:43:51,923
Put my campaign on tv for a year,

716
00:43:51,991 --> 00:43:54,092
then hold your group again,
maybe it'll show up.

717
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,927
Well, I tried everything.

718
00:43:55,995 --> 00:43:58,063
I said "routine." I tried "ritual."

719
00:43:58,130 --> 00:43:59,798
All they care about is a husband.

720
00:43:59,865 --> 00:44:01,733
You were there.
I'll show you the transcripts.

721
00:44:01,801 --> 00:44:04,002
You can't tell how people
are going to behave

722
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:05,704
based on how they have behaved.

723
00:44:05,771 --> 00:44:07,372
Why are you being so hostile?

724
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,674
You think I've never had
this argument before?

725
00:44:09,742 --> 00:44:12,710
Because you go in there and you
stick your finger in people's brains

726
00:44:12,778 --> 00:44:15,213
and they just start talking...
Blah blah blah... Just to be heard.

727
00:44:17,049 --> 00:44:18,716
And you know what?
Not only does it have

728
00:44:18,784 --> 00:44:20,785
nothing to do with what I do,
but it's nobody's business.

729
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:24,288
Well, you're the client.

730
00:44:24,356 --> 00:44:25,556
That's right.

731
00:44:47,645 --> 00:44:48,946
- Hello.
- It's Joyce.

732
00:44:49,013 --> 00:44:50,647
Lunch, five minutes.

733
00:44:50,715 --> 00:44:52,849
Um, sure.

734
00:44:52,917 --> 00:44:55,752
- Meet you in the lobby?
- No, my friends want to see Megan.

735
00:45:01,225 --> 00:45:03,827
Pete, you remember Phil Coakmeyer.

736
00:45:03,895 --> 00:45:05,762
- A pleasure to see you again.
- Shall we?

737
00:45:05,830 --> 00:45:07,497
We're just waiting on Don.

738
00:45:16,374 --> 00:45:17,874
Hi.

739
00:45:17,942 --> 00:45:21,344
- You want to join us?
- I can't.

740
00:46:05,488 --> 00:46:07,189
Did you get pears?

741
00:46:10,727 --> 00:46:12,661
Did you get pears?

742
00:46:15,031 --> 00:46:17,099
Did you get pears?

743
00:46:17,167 --> 00:46:19,968
We'll discuss it inside.

744
00:47:04,089 --> 00:47:06,089
