1
00:01:31,524 --> 00:01:32,889
When did you get up?

2
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,721
I don't know.

3
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,390
Is it still Saturday?

4
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,594
I need you to fix
the outlet in the dining room.

5
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:45,500
I thought you were going
to call an electrician.

6
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:50,338
All you need to do is unscrew the fuse
and replace the plug, Don.

7
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:53,241
Sounds like you could do it.

8
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:57,208
I need to be able to plug in the hot plate.

9
00:01:57,317 --> 00:01:58,614
Okay.

10
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:00,652
Okay.

11
00:02:02,088 --> 00:02:03,282
Bets, come here.

12
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:11,989
Look, you've got a week before this party,

13
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:14,532
and it doesn't have to be a big deal.

14
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,465
Carla will help you.

15
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:18,400
We're going to have a house full of people.

16
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:21,303
I'd appreciate it if you'd take care
of the things on the list.

17
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:24,274
Birdie, I'll fix it.

18
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:26,368
Thank you.

19
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:33,250
Hello.

20
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:35,844
Perfect timing. Ma just left.

21
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:37,479
You two are on
your honeymoon, Mr. Seeger?

22
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,852
Yes.

23
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:41,290
And how did you meet
this lovely young lady?

24
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:42,918
At a New Year's Eve party.

25
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:45,998
I brought colored pencils for the boys.

26
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:48,397
They're out back throwing rocks
at my laundry.

27
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,901
How is he?

28
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,369
I don't know.

29
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:54,133
I told you about the chiropractor.

30
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,901
They're not doctors.

31
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,874
Did I tell you he cried?

32
00:02:57,977 --> 00:02:59,103
Anita...

33
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:01,305
Sometimes I think about Mike Ryan.
Remember him?

34
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:03,473
Stop it. Gerry has a job.

35
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:04,914
He hates it.

36
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,679
He told me he hated it,

37
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:08,617
and then a week later his back started.

38
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:11,554
His buddies from work
don't even come by anymore.

39
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:13,819
They think he's a malingerer.

40
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:17,829
And Ma, all she can talk
about are her bunions.

41
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:21,128
I checked out the next
Horatio Hornblower for him.

42
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:24,032
I was right. There is only
one book about Moby Dick.

43
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:25,798
Him with the books.

44
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:28,134
Who is it?

45
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:29,469
I don't know.

46
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:34,875
Oh, Lord.

47
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:38,782
Hello, Father.
What a pleasant surprise.

48
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,079
Well, I'm sorry for dropping in.

49
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:41,983
I just thought that he could use a visit.

50
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:43,055
Bless you.

51
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:44,054
How is he?

52
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:45,317
Much better, thanks.

53
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:46,392
Good, good. I'm glad.

54
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:49,619
- Hello, Peggy.
- Hello, Father.

55
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:50,753
Let me see if he's awake.

56
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:52,387
No, please don't disturb him.

57
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:54,591
Nonsense. He'll be thrilled.

58
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,465
It means a lot that you're visiting.

59
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,597
You as well, I'm sure.

60
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,300
Are you hungry?

61
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,741
I've already been fed a few times today.

62
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:07,437
It's a wonderful community, you know?

63
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:09,344
It is.

64
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:15,387
I see you at church,
but you don't seem very comfortable.

65
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:18,184
No. That's not true.

66
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:21,385
You don't participate.
You keep to yourself.

67
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:27,561
You know, there are
many ways to be involved.

68
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:30,932
There's a committee for the CYO dance.

69
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:32,334
And for selfish reasons,

70
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:35,168
I would love to take advantage
of your professional services again.

71
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,742
What do you mean?

72
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:37,935
Publicity.

73
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:42,378
Last year's poster was girls in garlands
dancing around a maypole.

74
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:44,541
I don't think that's what the kids want.

75
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:47,051
No. They don't.

76
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:49,553
I'm so busy right now, Father.

77
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:51,453
Think of it as pro bono.

78
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:52,819
Talk to your boss.

79
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:55,450
I really would like the kids to show up.

80
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:57,586
He's ready to see you, Father.

81
00:04:57,697 --> 00:04:59,631
I'll get you the specifics.

82
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:08,568
As of today, you are costing this company
more than you are making it.

83
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:10,040
Excuse me?

84
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,077
Tim Dunst called from Maytag.

85
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:15,079
Apparently, last night, their switchboard
lit up like a Christmas tree.

86
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:17,308
- I didn't hear...
- You're head of the television department,

87
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:19,078
so I know you can't watch everything.

88
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:20,743
But who exactly oversaw the placement

89
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:23,083
of Maytag in The ABC Sunday Night Movie?

90
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:28,585
Well, I take full responsibility.

91
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:30,788
There was a scene
with a murderous Russian spy

92
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:33,161
who was referred to
as an agitator repeatedly,

93
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:34,824
and this led into a Maytag spot,

94
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:37,801
the title of which is "The Amazing Agitator."

95
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:40,494
Really?

96
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:42,335
Is this all a big joke to you?

97
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:44,000
The Russians are still our enemy, you know.

98
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,010
This will not happen again.

99
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:48,205
Crane, we're eating this one.

100
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:49,838
Politics aside, you need to be aware

101
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:52,543
that a client will take
any excuse not to pay us.

102
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:55,280
You need to get
your department in line, or I'll gut it.

103
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:56,412
Yes, sir.

104
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:58,114
I'll get to the bottom of this.

105
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,234
Hey, Harry, what's the name
of that place we went to

106
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:11,667
with the wallpaper and the kebabs?

107
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:12,760
I don't remember.

108
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,362
Can one of you help me read TV scripts?

109
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:15,532
For money?

110
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:16,801
I don't think so.

111
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:18,809
There's too much to read,
and I have nobody.

112
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:21,175
There are things to do
that I didn't know were my job.

113
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,248
How could that be?
You made that job up.

114
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:27,551
I thought I would be a liaison
between the networks and the agency

115
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:28,950
and, I don't know, buy time.

116
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,319
That's what your job was before.

117
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:33,517
So now what? It's a whole 'nother job.

118
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:34,957
That's why we have juniors.

119
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,187
Someone to blame.

120
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:38,126
You need someone to lay down
on the barbed wire

121
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,858
so you can run over them.

122
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:50,174
Heineken was pleased but confused.

123
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:51,903
By the fact that you don't use their product?

124
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:54,206
That's why I brought Campbell.

125
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:56,247
So what's the problem?

126
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:57,873
They're set on competing at the tap.

127
00:06:57,984 --> 00:07:01,044
We just have to find a way
to excite your average tavern inhabitant,

128
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:02,382
and they'll be happy.

129
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:04,888
Did you explain to them that there's a market

130
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:07,221
that's actually excited
about Heineken being imported?

131
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:11,357
For women entertaining in the home,
Holland is Paris.

132
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:13,523
They can buy this sophisticated beer

133
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:16,363
and proudly walk it into the kitchen
instead of hiding it in the garage.

134
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:18,164
I'm just telling you I sensed resistance.

135
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,568
If you want to get some research,

136
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:21,333
I'll get them into a room with you again.

137
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,341
Okay.

138
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,001
We'll go up and down the Hudson,

139
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,636
northern New Jersey,
Connecticut, the cash belt...

140
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:29,908
set up a few end-aisle
displays at the A&Ps,

141
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:31,506
away from the other beer,

142
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:35,246
surrounded by cheese and crackers
and toothpicks with cellophane tips.

143
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:36,582
We can try that.

144
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:38,179
Maybe short, uneven stacks.

145
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,519
Make it look popular.

146
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,217
Plus, housewives love green.

147
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:42,692
We'll go make some calls.

148
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:45,958
You're still going to have to sit down
and sell this to them.

149
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,292
By the way,
I hate to disappoint your wife,

150
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:52,462
but I don't know about Sunday night.

151
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:53,903
I'd worry more about disappointing Roger.

152
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:57,237
He seemed to think it was important
that we sit down with Crab Colson.

153
00:07:57,343 --> 00:08:00,471
And believe me, I'm sure my wife
would rather go see a movie.

154
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,605
Who's Crab Colson?

155
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:04,615
Rogers & Cowan.

156
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:06,912
I'll get the time from your girl again.

157
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:20,587
Mr. Sterling is here to see you.

158
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:24,023
Send him in, please.

159
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:27,461
- Roger.
- Crane.

160
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:32,828
Mitch says you want
to expand your department.

161
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:34,736
Looks pretty big already.

162
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,866
Well, the way other television departments
have this set up...

163
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:39,069
and I've checked on this...

164
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:41,976
there should be a dedicated man
for Broadcast Operations.

165
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,639
And what is he dedicated to?

166
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:46,411
Reading scripts, meetings to discuss.

167
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:49,488
I'm really the face of the television
department for the clients.

168
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:50,613
Have you noticed we're full up?

169
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:51,985
Who's going to pay this person, you?

170
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,787
The money we save avoiding surprises
will make it worthwhile.

171
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:56,452
You smoke, Crane?

172
00:09:56,562 --> 00:09:57,688
Sometimes.

173
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:01,496
How do I know you're not just goldbricking?

174
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:02,727
Because that's what Mitch thinks.

175
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:06,661
I don't want to speak out of turn...

176
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,899
Warren, do you mind?

177
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:14,737
I don't think Mitch has been very happy
with my recent promotion.

178
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:15,814
Are you?

179
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:17,507
Yes, of course.

180
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:20,811
Figure out a way to do the job yourself.

181
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:27,617
You better not repeat any of that to Mitch.

182
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:37,928
Peggy Olson's office.

183
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:39,664
May I speak with Miss Olson?

184
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:41,569
This is Father John Gill calling.

185
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:47,071
Peggy Olson speaking.

186
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:49,545
Hello, Peggy.
This is Father John Gill.

187
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,843
Do you have a minute?

188
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,781
Yes. Did you get the flyer?

189
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:53,977
Yes.

190
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:57,453
It's good, but can you take
whatever this is

191
00:10:57,556 --> 00:11:00,218
and make it into a poster?

192
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,590
What do you mean, whatever this is?

193
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:05,289
Well, there's been some discussion.

194
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:07,691
Don't you like it?

195
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:12,328
The CYO committee is curious
about "A Night to Remember."

196
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:14,906
What's the problem?

197
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:18,841
Well, they feel it sends
the wrong message to the girls.

198
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:22,407
It's wholesome and romantic.

199
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:23,880
And you have to get the girls.

200
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:25,473
It's the only way the boys will come.

201
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:26,949
Well...

202
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:28,953
Tell them that this is the way it works,

203
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:30,283
and I know better than them.

204
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:34,482
Peggy, couldn't you just speak with them?

205
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:37,960
They just want to feel involved.

206
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:39,725
Of course.

207
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:42,096
I'd love to hear their thoughts.

208
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,566
Good-bye, Father.

209
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:44,931
Good-bye.

210
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:50,837
Unlike some deodorants,

211
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:53,605
Fresh doesn't promise you
eternal romance.

212
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,773
Mr. Crane, may I be of some assistance?

213
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,816
I'm sorry.

214
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:00,112
What?

215
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,881
I received a memo
from Mr. Sterling's office,

216
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:05,855
saying that you needed a girl
to help you with your workload.

217
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:09,416
No, that's not exactly what I asked for.

218
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:12,463
Well, I don't know what you had in mind,
but we are spread very thin.

219
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:14,959
Hello, Joan.

220
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,534
Hello, Warren.

221
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:19,661
You...

222
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:21,637
You look great today.

223
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,732
Thank you, Warren.

224
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:25,674
I need someone to run
our commercial scripts

225
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:28,406
past the networks for approval.

226
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:29,640
Can't you just use a messenger?

227
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,684
No. That person also has to read
the network scripts for me

228
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:34,810
and really make sure
our clients aren't misrepresented.

229
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,912
I don't feel comfortable
sending my girls out of the building,

230
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:39,888
but I will find someone to read the scripts.

231
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:41,721
My wife is pregnant.

232
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:44,091
I just want to get out of here
at a reasonable hour.

233
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:46,130
How many are there?

234
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,324
And what are they looking for?

235
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,733
We just want to nip
any problems in the bud.

236
00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:54,601
For example, if a kid's pushing away
his dinner in disgust,

237
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:57,039
just make sure it's not Gorton's fish sticks.

238
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:59,509
You know, people can't be
coughing and dying

239
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:00,738
right before a Lucky ad.

240
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:02,211
Things like that.
It's common sense, really.

241
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:03,542
It sounds interesting.

242
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:06,550
It is. For the first few.

243
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:08,586
And there's Maytag in there.

244
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:10,177
They're very sensitive to Communism.

245
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:17,226
Why can't I do that?

246
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:18,921
Because you already have a job.

247
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:21,556
No. I mean talk to her like that.

248
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:23,498
She's so much woman.

249
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:02,872
You are so graceful.

250
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:04,636
She is adorable.

251
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:06,267
They're doing Winnie the Pooh this year.

252
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:08,903
She's going to be Piglet.

253
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,345
It's all very professional-looking.

254
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:13,612
Cheryl's 14. She won't even waltz
on my feet anymore.

255
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:15,448
Ours is engaged.

256
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:17,647
Enjoy it while you can.

257
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:20,190
Crab, can I get you another one of those?

258
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:23,090
Like the song says, I'd be a fool to say no.

259
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,888
- Roger?
- Ladies first.

260
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:28,967
All right, the evening show is over.

261
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:31,662
Bedtime. Say good-bye to everybody.

262
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:32,668
Good night.

263
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:35,001
Good night.

264
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:37,468
- Good night, slugger.
- Good night.

265
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:39,737
Hello.

266
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:41,745
Hello, Mrs. Draper.

267
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:43,314
Betty.

268
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:44,905
These are beautiful.

269
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:47,315
I'm sorry I'm late. My date cancelled.

270
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:49,046
You should have called.

271
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:50,781
I might have been able to replace her.

272
00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:54,451
Carla, would you please
put these in water?

273
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,188
And our head count is now seven.

274
00:14:58,297 --> 00:14:59,764
What a lovely home.

275
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:01,457
Hello, Duck.

276
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,398
I remember you, Sally.

277
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:04,491
Hello.

278
00:15:04,603 --> 00:15:06,161
And who do we have here?

279
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:07,239
This is Bobby.

280
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:08,806
Bobby, shake Mr. Phillips' hand.

281
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,570
Do you like baseball, Bobby?

282
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,576
Come on. Let's go to bed.

283
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:19,612
Sorry I'm late.
I didn't want to come stag.

284
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:20,707
Nobody cares.

285
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:23,617
I don't know.
My wife hated odd numbers.

286
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,323
Well, hello, there.

287
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,860
Duck Phillips, you know Mona.

288
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:30,929
Of course.

289
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,520
Hello.

290
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:35,327
Of course this is Petra and Crab Colson.

291
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:39,698
Crab, Duck. Duck, Crab.

292
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:41,500
Can I get you something?

293
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:42,938
Tomato juice, if you have it.

294
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:44,373
Come on.

295
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:46,273
I'll have something with dinner.

296
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:48,073
Beautiful drive.

297
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,442
- Did you take the Sawmill?
- I did.

298
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:51,846
Found myself heading
to New Rochelle by accident.

299
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,316
I used to live there.

300
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:54,408
It's lovely there.

301
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,078
I'll tell you the way to go.

302
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:58,850
We're taking our sloop
from my folks' place in Old Lyme

303
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,721
all the way down to Larchmont
for Race Week.

304
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:01,952
We should get a boat.

305
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:04,359
My father had a boat. Almost killed him.

306
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,761
You might as well
cut a hole in your pocket.

307
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:09,095
The slip and the dry dock
and the yacht club.

308
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:10,896
Speaking of which, Don,

309
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:13,267
are you and Bets joining
Willow Oaks or not?

310
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:14,771
We're lonely.

311
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:17,803
If you wish, you can
leave your drinks here

312
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,309
and join us in the dining room.

313
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:21,345
Terrific.

314
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:22,573
So, Rogers & Cowan.

315
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:24,512
It's a good place to be right now.

316
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,713
He does everything
you need him to do, you know?

317
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,654
Well, we took the road that goes to...

318
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:36,718
How did that get there?

319
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:42,430
We're going to take a little trip
around the world,

320
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:44,934
starting in Spain with gazpacho,

321
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:47,335
followed by Japan... rumaki...

322
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:49,304
and then we'll stop by Duchess County

323
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:51,501
for a leg of lamb, mint jelly,

324
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:52,702
accompanied by egg noodles,

325
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:54,904
the way my grandmother
made them from Germany.

326
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,915
And we have a choice
of burgundy from France

327
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,952
or a frosted glass of beer from Holland.

328
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:04,278
Did you bring a case from work?

329
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:05,687
No.

330
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,758
Oh, please, Draper.

331
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,292
You'll do anything to win an argument.

332
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:09,986
I don't understand.

333
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:13,258
You went out and bought that?
At the store?

334
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:14,923
Carla did some of the marketing,

335
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,764
but no, I did. Why?

336
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:20,834
I'm not even allowed to pick where I sit.

337
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:25,604
What's so funny?

338
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,508
Crab, if you want to be in business

339
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:29,046
with someone who knows their stuff...

340
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:30,775
Heineken is one of our clients.

341
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:33,215
He said you were the market, and you are.

342
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:37,814
- That is funny.
- Incredible.

343
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:40,619
What an interesting experiment.

344
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:43,593
I have to sit down.

345
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:45,026
Please do.

346
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,529
Now who wants wine?

347
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,390
Please start.

348
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:00,669
The soup is delicious.

349
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:04,209
To our hosts.

350
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:07,417
And their idyllic country home,

351
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:09,350
and to new friends.

352
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:10,922
Hear, hear.

353
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:22,367
"A Night to Remember"
is every girl's dream.

354
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:25,232
It holds the wholesome promise
of the kind of hand-holding

355
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:27,032
that eventually leads to marriage.

356
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:31,576
I think it's exactly what we talked about.

357
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:34,009
I don't like the way they're dancing.

358
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,104
They're too close together.

359
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:39,378
Maybe leave some room
for the Holy Ghost.

360
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:42,386
Uh, maybe they're doing a box step.

361
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:45,590
Fine.

362
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:49,218
You're not worried about
having a dance full of girls only?

363
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:51,262
When the boys hear
that the girls are going...

364
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:52,694
The boys aren't going to hear nothing.

365
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,425
They don't go to school together.

366
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:56,467
They go to church together.

367
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:59,059
And this isn't the first CYO event.

368
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:00,729
That's true.

369
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:03,000
I'd never thought about that,
but you're right.

370
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:05,838
I'm just saying I'm not an expert,

371
00:19:05,944 --> 00:19:07,741
but there might be another slogan.

372
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:11,715
What do you want, two flyers?

373
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:14,786
No. We don't have to
throw this one away,

374
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:17,788
but maybe we can, um...

375
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:22,088
I think she's saying
maybe we should try something else.

376
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:30,560
Thank you very much.
I'll see what I can do.

377
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,261
You're such a doll.

378
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:36,704
Could I speak to you a minute?

379
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:40,073
Father, I wanted to talk to you, too.

380
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,807
We can speak tomorrow.

381
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:46,783
Thank you all for your
generosity and your time.

382
00:19:57,729 --> 00:20:00,027
Father, I don't mind working,

383
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:02,692
but this is completely unnecessary.

384
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:05,031
Well, I don't understand.

385
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:06,866
Did you agree with them?

386
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:08,997
The dancers could be farther apart,

387
00:20:09,107 --> 00:20:11,075
but you were very persuasive.

388
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:12,734
You don't have to agree with them.

389
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:14,539
In fact, you're not supposed to.

390
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:17,809
You asked me to do this
based on my expertise.

391
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,384
Well, I'm not really on the committee.

392
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:21,816
I'm more of a liaison.

393
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,286
You're supposed to tell them
that they should trust me.

394
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,084
That's your job.

395
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:27,556
They'll listen to you.

396
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:30,025
You're right.

397
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:32,221
I'm sorry this is so much work.

398
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:34,697
No, I can turn it around.

399
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,062
And the copy machine?

400
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:38,033
Yes, I cleared it.

401
00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:39,194
I'm sorry, Father.

402
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:41,135
I don't mean to be disrespectful.

403
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,867
I'm very tired.

404
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:44,840
We'll both be prepared next time.

405
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:46,069
Come on.

406
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:51,774
Good night, Peggy.

407
00:20:51,883 --> 00:20:53,350
I really am glad you're here.

408
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:54,817
Me, too.

409
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:08,097
You didn't set the table?

410
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,692
I'm sorry. You came back so fast.

411
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:13,395
I'll get plates.

412
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:18,641
You're not going to believe what happens
on As the World Turns.

413
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:20,075
You're right about that.

414
00:21:20,178 --> 00:21:21,873
Let me ask you something.

415
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,471
Is it possible for someone
to come out of a coma

416
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:27,143
and have no recollection of who they are?

417
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:29,550
Honestly, people don't
come out of comas much.

418
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:30,644
Really?

419
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:32,383
So it's also probably ridiculous

420
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:34,618
they would have an accent
they didn't have beforehand?

421
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:35,920
Yes.

422
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:37,586
Well, it must have happened to somebody.

423
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:39,425
I mean, they wouldn't
make it up completely, right?

424
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:42,193
Probably once. Makes a good story.

425
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,599
I'm going to get my drink.
Do you want something?

426
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:45,727
Water.

427
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:52,372
I didn't know you were such a reader.

428
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,001
It's part of my job.

429
00:21:54,112 --> 00:21:56,979
I thought you just walked around
with people staring at you.

430
00:21:57,082 --> 00:21:59,312
You.

431
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:04,750
What are you bothering with that for?

432
00:22:04,856 --> 00:22:07,086
You should be looking for a house.

433
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:10,025
What happened to your fascination
with Glen Cove?

434
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:11,891
You told me to stop looking.

435
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:15,899
Well, I just need to finish my training.

436
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:19,266
Joanie, you should be watching
those shows, not reading them,

437
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:23,102
with a box of bonbons on your lap
to soothe your cravings.

438
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:24,573
It's a hoot.

439
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,473
I guess that's okay.

440
00:22:26,578 --> 00:22:28,944
I'm glad you approve.

441
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,913
Were you going to get me
a glass of water, hon?

442
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,154
Of course.

443
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,858
Hey, Chuck, you're gonna have to
wear a tag on your shirt.

444
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:53,164
I won't know you...

445
00:22:53,271 --> 00:22:54,636
Carla, why don't you go home?

446
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,867
We can do all this in the morning.

447
00:22:56,975 --> 00:22:58,340
That jam will set.

448
00:22:58,443 --> 00:23:00,968
Let me at least put the dishes in the basin.

449
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:02,569
That's a good idea.

450
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:07,615
If you want, you can go to bed.

451
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:10,119
I'll show myself out,
call Louis to pick me up.

452
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:12,690
It's okay. We had a long day.

453
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:14,656
Thank you for all your help.

454
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,793
Good night, Mr. Draper.

455
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:22,992
Good night, Carla.

456
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:25,160
It was a great success.

457
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:35,404
Molly Horton is a paying customer
on this one.

458
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:37,448
I'm with you, Major.
Running a wagon train is a...

459
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:38,846
Hey.

460
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:42,678
You embarrassed me.

461
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,355
What are you talking about?

462
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:47,357
You embarrassed me.

463
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:49,983
What did I do?

464
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,757
You knew I would buy that beer.

465
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:54,695
So what?

466
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,893
Because you know me so well.

467
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:58,731
You know everything about me.

468
00:23:58,837 --> 00:24:02,398
Bets, I use our life all the time in my work.

469
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:03,735
They pay me for that.

470
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:05,537
And then you laughed.

471
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:08,044
You all laughed.

472
00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:10,774
Must be so funny being in on it.

473
00:24:10,882 --> 00:24:12,816
Come on.

474
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:16,184
You're taking this the wrong way.

475
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,552
You embarrassed me.

476
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:20,921
I'm sorry.

477
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:22,425
I didn't mean it.

478
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:23,858
You never mean it.

479
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:26,430
You just do whatever you want,

480
00:24:26,531 --> 00:24:28,362
and I put up with it because nobody knows.

481
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:30,025
No one is going to remember that.

482
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,659
You know what they're
going to remember?

483
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:34,170
Petra Colson missing her chair.

484
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:37,598
Come on. Leave this. You're tired.

485
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:39,643
Let's go upstairs.

486
00:24:39,744 --> 00:24:41,575
I'm not going to bed.

487
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:45,514
Not until you tell me
why you insist on humiliating me.

488
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:47,744
Betty, I can't talk to you
when you're like this.

489
00:24:47,853 --> 00:24:49,912
You're making a mountain out of a molehill.

490
00:24:52,123 --> 00:24:54,318
I know about you and that woman.

491
00:24:55,427 --> 00:24:56,451
What?

492
00:24:56,561 --> 00:24:58,859
Damn it, Don, I know you're having an affair.

493
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:04,658
You and Bobbie Barrett.

494
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:05,997
What?

495
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:09,665
How could you? She's so old.

496
00:25:09,774 --> 00:25:12,072
Betty, that's ridiculous.

497
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:15,109
I'm just telling you I know.

498
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:21,882
Fine, Bets.

499
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:23,978
What do you know?

500
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:28,990
Go ahead. Tell me.

501
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:30,789
Jimmy told me everything.

502
00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:34,024
Jimmy. He hates me.

503
00:25:34,132 --> 00:25:35,622
He told me everything.

504
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:37,326
Please. What the hell did he say?

505
00:25:37,435 --> 00:25:40,302
So you can pick it apart?
Twist all my words?

506
00:25:40,405 --> 00:25:42,930
I'm not going to dignify
Jimmy Barrett with a response.

507
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,872
He's a big mouth.

508
00:25:44,976 --> 00:25:46,807
And don't pretend I don't
know how he looks at you.

509
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:50,982
I saw you two together.

510
00:25:51,082 --> 00:25:53,312
You think you know me?

511
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:55,682
Well, I know what kind of a man you are.

512
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:58,221
You think I would sleep with that woman?

513
00:25:58,323 --> 00:26:00,052
You can't help yourself.

514
00:26:02,193 --> 00:26:03,490
Admit it.

515
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:05,620
There's nothing to admit.

516
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,493
You're lying.

517
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:10,600
I'm going to bed.

518
00:27:16,901 --> 00:27:17,890
Good morning.

519
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:19,231
Good morning, Daddy.

520
00:27:22,073 --> 00:27:23,870
Mommy said the party was fun.

521
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:26,136
Did she?

522
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:32,907
Okay.

523
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:34,110
Bye-bye.

524
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:35,117
Bye-bye.

525
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,778
Bye, Daddy.

526
00:27:44,295 --> 00:27:46,058
Aren't you going to be a daddy soon?

527
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:48,462
I've done my part. The rest is up to her.

528
00:27:48,566 --> 00:27:50,124
Don't pay attention to that due date.

529
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:51,133
It'll drive you nuts.

530
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:53,136
- D Day.
- Hello.

531
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:56,230
This is Mr. Pastern
and Mr. Kostis from Maytag.

532
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,172
- Are we all better now?
- Yes.

533
00:27:58,276 --> 00:28:00,369
Process seems to be streamlined.

534
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,440
Wait a minute. Is she the one
we spoke to on the phone?

535
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:07,416
Yes. Joan is handling
Broadcast Operations.

536
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,749
I had no idea.

537
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:12,015
I would have combed my hair
before I called you.

538
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:14,114
I've got next week's scripts.

539
00:28:14,225 --> 00:28:15,624
Don't hold anything back now.

540
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:16,853
She won't.

541
00:28:16,961 --> 00:28:20,089
Well, it was nice to meet
both of you in person.

542
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,222
Indeed.

543
00:28:23,134 --> 00:28:25,034
Hell of an operation you've got here, Crane.

544
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:26,728
I think so.

545
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:52,949
Gentlemen.

546
00:29:53,057 --> 00:29:55,116
Phil. Good to see you, as always.

547
00:29:55,226 --> 00:29:57,990
Francis. Can we get you something?

548
00:29:58,096 --> 00:30:00,291
We've got a fridge
full of Heineken out there.

549
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:02,992
No. It's 11 a.m., for Pete's sake.

550
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:04,568
Well, thanks for coming by.

551
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:06,034
We were just so excited,

552
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:08,230
I thought you should hear it
from the horse's mouth.

553
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:09,704
What exactly happened?

554
00:30:11,342 --> 00:30:12,502
Well...

555
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:16,740
We explained to you before
that research shows

556
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:18,179
that with the rise in commuters

557
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:20,547
and the relative scarcity
of suburban bars,

558
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,813
people are drinking more in the home.

559
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:24,115
Yes, we heard you.

560
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:27,248
Entertaining housewives, et cetera.

561
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:28,723
We're not against it.

562
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:32,388
We just think our money would
be spent better elsewhere.

563
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:34,522
And honestly, I agree with you,

564
00:30:34,632 --> 00:30:37,465
but, well, we ran a little test,

565
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:40,538
and the results were very enlightening.

566
00:30:40,638 --> 00:30:41,969
Don?

567
00:30:42,073 --> 00:30:44,871
We targeted
a few wealthy suburban markets

568
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:47,877
with woman-friendly end-aisle displays.

569
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:49,412
Was there a spike?

570
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:51,641
The sample was very small,

571
00:30:51,749 --> 00:30:53,683
but what we put out sold well.

572
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:57,016
More important was who it sold to.

573
00:30:57,121 --> 00:31:01,251
This is an untapped market
where you dictate the competition.

574
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:05,090
I think I can say this
because Don's being modest.

575
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:07,630
Don's wife, she's a peach of a girl.

576
00:31:07,732 --> 00:31:09,256
They had a dinner party.

577
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:10,664
We're talking days after placement,

578
00:31:10,768 --> 00:31:13,931
and she had this elaborate, elegant setup...

579
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:15,369
foods from around the globe.

580
00:31:15,473 --> 00:31:17,634
And sure enough,
there was your Heineken,

581
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:20,142
right next to the bone china
and the polished sterling.

582
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:21,644
It was incredible.

583
00:31:21,746 --> 00:31:24,146
Not exactly scientific.

584
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:27,241
Although it sounds like
you do know your wife.

585
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:29,115
She's exactly who we're after...

586
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:32,383
well-off, educated,
with plenty of time to shop.

587
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:34,185
And it's important for her

588
00:31:34,292 --> 00:31:37,591
that she's the perfect hostess,
the perfect wife.

589
00:31:37,695 --> 00:31:40,061
We even talked about
using her menu verbatim

590
00:31:40,164 --> 00:31:41,495
in selected ladies' magazines.

591
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:42,896
Really?

592
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:44,901
We haven't been there yet.

593
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:47,631
No, but it's what I've been pushing for.

594
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:50,037
And so I take your word on this?

595
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:51,438
Why would I lie?

596
00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:53,510
We're the ones who are
going to have to deliver.

597
00:31:56,514 --> 00:31:59,677
I guess we could throw it in the mix.

598
00:31:59,784 --> 00:32:01,752
Let's start regional.

599
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:04,686
See how some strangers' wives feel.

600
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:10,317
I would recommend
buying air time during Love of Life.

601
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:12,419
Women watching TV during the day

602
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:14,760
like to fantasize
about having active lifestyles.

603
00:32:14,866 --> 00:32:17,391
They like where they could
be going with Sea & Ski.

604
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:18,992
And they watch every day.

605
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:21,401
I know my daughter missed
a lot of classes in college

606
00:32:21,506 --> 00:32:22,666
for her stories.

607
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,571
My wife brought the TV home.

608
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:25,700
There you go.

609
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:29,075
Mr. Hansen, I don't know
how Mr. Crane feels about this,

610
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:31,307
but I've been reading the scripts,

611
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:32,883
and I just have to say

612
00:32:32,984 --> 00:32:35,214
As the World Turns
is about to become unmissable.

613
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,651
I don't want to give it away,

614
00:32:36,754 --> 00:32:40,884
but someone people think is dead is not.

615
00:32:41,926 --> 00:32:44,417
I'm glad you like it, but they all do
the same things, don't they?

616
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:45,587
No. Not at all.

617
00:32:45,697 --> 00:32:48,291
This is what they call
a special summer storyline,

618
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:50,458
and I've spoken
to Logan Reynolds over at CBS,

619
00:32:50,568 --> 00:32:52,695
and it's going to receive a lot of promotion.

620
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:53,896
Is it the same price?

621
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:55,472
Well, they're all close.

622
00:32:55,573 --> 00:32:57,040
This sounds better.

623
00:32:57,141 --> 00:33:01,009
Well, if you lock them in at this rating
and then they exceed it,

624
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:02,773
there's a bang
for your buck factor, isn't there?

625
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,177
I would say so.

626
00:33:04,282 --> 00:33:05,715
Then you should do that.

627
00:33:08,386 --> 00:33:10,251
I think you'll be pleased.

628
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:12,846
That's why I didn't want
to do this on the phone.

629
00:33:12,957 --> 00:33:16,393
I love what she says,
and I love the way she says it.

630
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:18,428
Let me walk you out.

631
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:33,043
Are you okay, Mommy?

632
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:39,044
I'm okay, sweetheart.

633
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:41,880
I'm just not feeling very well.

634
00:33:41,986 --> 00:33:44,216
Do you want some aspirin?

635
00:33:44,322 --> 00:33:46,415
No, Sally.

636
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:49,118
I'm just going to rest a little bit, okay?

637
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:52,162
Go play with your brother.

638
00:33:52,263 --> 00:33:53,730
Okay.

639
00:34:08,012 --> 00:34:09,070
Shit.

640
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,369
Crane, thanks for squeezing me in.

641
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:34,701
You said 4:30.

642
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:36,671
Hell, is it only 4:30?

643
00:34:36,774 --> 00:34:38,298
Sorry about that.

644
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:39,671
Listen, I'll be brief,

645
00:34:39,777 --> 00:34:41,745
since it appears I'm on my way out.

646
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:44,076
I've received a lot
of unsolicited phone calls.

647
00:34:44,182 --> 00:34:45,809
Simply put, the customers are satisfied,

648
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,214
and so is the accounting department.

649
00:34:47,318 --> 00:34:48,376
Keep up the good work.

650
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:50,147
Well, I'm not doing it on my own.

651
00:34:51,355 --> 00:34:52,447
Right. That's true, isn't it?

652
00:34:52,557 --> 00:34:55,151
Why don't we get those secretaries
back to their regular jobs?

653
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:56,886
It's just Joan Holloway, actually.

654
00:34:56,994 --> 00:34:59,462
So her attentions are divided at best.

655
00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:03,466
Make it a full-time position, 150 a week,
and he has to share an office.

656
00:35:03,568 --> 00:35:04,728
Sounds perfect.

657
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:25,315
Hello.

658
00:35:39,737 --> 00:35:40,897
Where are the kids?

659
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:43,405
Bed.

660
00:35:45,009 --> 00:35:48,536
What happened here?

661
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:50,978
Nothing.

662
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:52,811
Nothing happened here.

663
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:57,217
I went through every pocket
and every drawer,

664
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:58,481
and there's nothing.

665
00:35:58,589 --> 00:36:00,420
Would you stop?

666
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:02,083
How much have you had to drink?

667
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:04,252
I don't even know why I bother looking.

668
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:10,392
All I found were stacks of cocktail napkins
with stupid advertising on them.

669
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,196
What are you doing, Bets?

670
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:18,134
I would never do this to you.

671
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:22,639
How could you do this to me?

672
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:26,449
I didn't do anything.

673
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:00,241
Don.

674
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:06,847
What time is it?

675
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:13,628
I don't want it to be like this.

676
00:37:18,636 --> 00:37:21,196
Me, either.

677
00:37:22,873 --> 00:37:25,433
I don't know what to do.

678
00:37:28,212 --> 00:37:30,043
Don't.

679
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:37,717
Nothing happened.

680
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:41,383
Now you look me in the eye.

681
00:37:41,492 --> 00:37:43,756
You never do that.

682
00:37:44,862 --> 00:37:46,887
Yes, I do.

683
00:37:48,232 --> 00:37:49,995
You never say you love me.

684
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:55,035
Yes, I do.

685
00:37:55,139 --> 00:37:57,972
You know I do.

686
00:37:58,075 --> 00:38:00,202
I say it all the time.

687
00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:02,142
No, you don't.

688
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:09,982
Do you hate me?

689
00:38:10,087 --> 00:38:12,612
God, no.

690
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:16,718
I love you, Bets.

691
00:38:16,827 --> 00:38:19,853
I do.

692
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:21,625
And I love the children.

693
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:27,199
I don't want to lose all this.

694
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,519
This is a very impressive operation.

695
00:38:51,629 --> 00:38:53,426
It's Madison Avenue.

696
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:56,829
Look at this.

697
00:38:56,934 --> 00:38:58,925
Did we get Miracle Whip?

698
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:00,936
I don't know.

699
00:39:01,038 --> 00:39:02,471
Makes a lot of sense.

700
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:04,131
She's an undercover nun.

701
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:07,443
So, Turk doesn't know which way to turn,

702
00:39:07,545 --> 00:39:09,775
he's so drunk, so finally he stops.

703
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,177
We get out of the car,

704
00:39:11,282 --> 00:39:14,217
and the sign says "Bridge Out."

705
00:39:15,786 --> 00:39:17,811
- Hello, Joan.
- You wanted to see me?

706
00:39:17,922 --> 00:39:19,480
Joan, this is Danny Lindstrom.

707
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:20,784
Dan.

708
00:39:22,226 --> 00:39:24,820
He's going to be in charge
of Broadcast Operations.

709
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:26,829
Excuse me?

710
00:39:26,931 --> 00:39:28,558
I've really appreciated you filling in.

711
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:29,997
I couldn't have asked for more.

712
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:31,432
Joan knows everything about this.

713
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:33,560
Well, that makes one of us.

714
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:36,764
I've already given him next week's scripts.

715
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:39,468
It would be great if you
could fill him in on how it works.

716
00:39:39,577 --> 00:39:41,340
Right now?

717
00:39:41,445 --> 00:39:42,912
Why not? Are you busy?

718
00:39:44,281 --> 00:39:47,409
No. Not at all.

719
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:53,319
It's really just reading
the scripts, all of them,

720
00:39:53,424 --> 00:39:55,221
and looking through the storylines

721
00:39:55,326 --> 00:39:58,853
to see if there's any...

722
00:39:58,963 --> 00:40:02,091
possible benefits to our clients,

723
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:04,997
how their products
may be portrayed to their advantage,

724
00:40:05,102 --> 00:40:08,503
and, of course,
getting the cooperation of the networks.

725
00:40:08,606 --> 00:40:10,198
That's pretty much what I said.

726
00:40:11,275 --> 00:40:12,469
Not exactly.

727
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:16,342
Listen, you're going to be around
to help with the details, right?

728
00:40:18,115 --> 00:40:20,106
Yes, of course.

729
00:40:20,217 --> 00:40:21,206
Anything else?

730
00:40:21,318 --> 00:40:23,377
No, Joan. And thank you again.

731
00:40:33,798 --> 00:40:37,131
This is wonderful.
It's completely automatic.

732
00:40:37,234 --> 00:40:38,565
I just leave it.

733
00:40:38,669 --> 00:40:40,466
If you set the number.

734
00:40:43,974 --> 00:40:45,532
You know, don't think we don't know

735
00:40:45,643 --> 00:40:47,941
how lucky we are having
you do this for us.

736
00:40:48,045 --> 00:40:50,775
Thank you. It's nice to be included.

737
00:40:58,155 --> 00:41:01,556
Peggy, do you have something
you need to talk about?

738
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:03,559
Excuse me?

739
00:41:03,661 --> 00:41:05,822
Well, I've noticed that you
don't take Communion.

740
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:07,830
And I don't think it's too much of a leap

741
00:41:07,932 --> 00:41:11,698
to ask if there's something
you need to talk about.

742
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:14,094
No.

743
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:17,368
God already knows whatever it is, Peggy.

744
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:20,342
Well, then I don't need to talk.

745
00:41:20,444 --> 00:41:23,311
Well, I'm here right now.

746
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:29,278
Father, don't take this the wrong way,

747
00:41:29,386 --> 00:41:33,083
but I don't think you'd understand.

748
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:37,757
God is bigger than what we were raised on.

749
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:44,123
Father, you don't have to live life
like the rest of us.

750
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:45,293
Maybe you're lucky.

751
00:41:45,402 --> 00:41:47,131
I've lived life.

752
00:41:47,238 --> 00:41:48,933
I wasn't born a priest.

753
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:50,404
Of course not.

754
00:41:52,977 --> 00:41:55,036
You know, when you distance
yourself from the church,

755
00:41:55,145 --> 00:41:58,774
you are distancing
yourself from everything.

756
00:41:58,883 --> 00:42:01,215
That's why it's called Communion,
you know.

757
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:02,979
It's not just being with God.

758
00:42:03,087 --> 00:42:04,918
It's being with people.

759
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:07,286
I know that.

760
00:42:07,391 --> 00:42:11,054
Well, then, why are you
pushing everyone away?

761
00:42:11,161 --> 00:42:13,891
I'm not.

762
00:42:13,998 --> 00:42:18,594
There is no sin too great to bring to God.

763
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:23,670
You can reconcile yourself with him
and have a whole new start.

764
00:42:24,942 --> 00:42:27,706
You're a smart, beautiful young girl.

765
00:42:27,811 --> 00:42:29,836
You have so much to offer.

766
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:36,683
Do you feel you don't deserve his love?

767
00:42:47,631 --> 00:42:49,155
Your copies are done.

768
00:42:51,468 --> 00:42:53,834
I'll put them in a box for you.

769
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:07,142
There you go.

770
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:09,310
Thank you very much, Peggy.

771
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,682
I'll see you on Sunday?

772
00:43:10,788 --> 00:43:12,585
Yes, of course.

773
00:43:22,399 --> 00:43:23,889
Welcome to the club.

774
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:31,169
So I pulled Sylvia's hair
and treated her mean.

775
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:32,833
She ran after me all the time,

776
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:35,468
and every day she took me
down to the malt shop

777
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:36,910
to split a soda with her.

778
00:43:37,014 --> 00:43:40,506
And just like that, I lose her.

779
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:42,108
How do you know you lost her?

780
00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:44,016
Today I walked into the malt shop,

781
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:46,715
and there was another guy
at the end of my straw.

782
00:43:51,261 --> 00:43:54,355
Imagine my horror when
a night on the town turned ugly.

783
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:56,330
This is a nice place for nice people.

784
00:43:56,433 --> 00:43:59,459
And the jerk behind the bar,
he throws a bowl of nuts at me.

785
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:00,537
What am I, a squirrel?

786
00:44:02,373 --> 00:44:03,533
Lucky for him,

787
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,871
I carry my own wherever I go.

788
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:08,774
Am I crazy? I don't think so.

789
00:44:08,879 --> 00:44:11,746
Just you try and stick your face
into a can of nuts.

790
00:44:13,517 --> 00:44:14,711
Take it from a nut.

791
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:16,479
Utz are better than nuts.

792
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:25,251
We have chains in almost
every suburban market

793
00:44:25,362 --> 00:44:28,126
on the East Coast,
plus Chicago, Cleveland.

794
00:44:28,232 --> 00:44:29,859
It's a vote of confidence.

795
00:44:31,068 --> 00:44:32,501
Mrs. Draper is on the line.

796
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,104
I got to take this.

797
00:44:35,205 --> 00:44:36,695
Thank her again for me.

798
00:44:43,747 --> 00:44:45,146
Hello.

799
00:44:45,249 --> 00:44:47,376
Don't come home.

800
00:44:47,484 --> 00:44:49,042
What?

801
00:44:49,153 --> 00:44:50,484
I don't care what you do.

802
00:44:50,587 --> 00:44:52,452
I just don't want you here.

803
00:44:54,792 --> 00:44:58,387
- Betty.
- Don, I don't want to see you.

804
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:37,017
Well, early in the morning

805
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:39,391
About the break of day

806
00:46:39,496 --> 00:46:41,555
I asked the Lord

807
00:46:41,665 --> 00:46:43,724
Help me find the way

808
00:46:43,834 --> 00:46:46,132
Help me find the way

809
00:46:46,236 --> 00:46:48,363
To the Promised Land

810
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:52,704
This lonely body needs a helping hand

811
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:57,372
I asked the Lord to help me, please

812
00:46:57,481 --> 00:47:01,815
Find the way

813
00:47:01,919 --> 00:47:03,784
When a new day's a-dawning

814
00:47:03,887 --> 00:47:05,912
I bow my head in prayer

815
00:47:06,023 --> 00:47:07,752
I pray to the Lord

816
00:47:07,858 --> 00:47:10,292
Won't you lead me there?

817
00:47:10,394 --> 00:47:14,728
Won't you guide me safely
to the golden stair?

818
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:19,098
Won't you let this body Your burden share?

819
00:47:19,203 --> 00:47:21,296
I pray to the Lord

820
00:47:21,405 --> 00:47:23,635
Won't you lead me, please?

821
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:27,642
Lead me there

822
00:47:39,056 --> 00:47:42,025
