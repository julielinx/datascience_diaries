1
00:00:46,946 --> 00:00:48,573
I've prepared all of your correspondence,

2
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:51,673
and the summaries are here
for you to go over.

3
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:53,616
You can put them down.

4
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,351
Well, it's just... It's 5:00.

5
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:03,190
Sorry about that.
You probably want to be leaving.

6
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:06,659
What are you up to?

7
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:09,402
Well, some of the girls from here

8
00:01:09,502 --> 00:01:12,699
and the traveler's insurance
got a place in Saltaire.

9
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:14,774
- Mosquitoes.
- They don't bother me.

10
00:01:14,874 --> 00:01:16,865
Some people they bother,
some people they don't.

11
00:01:16,976 --> 00:01:19,968
- I'm just one of those people.
- A thing like that.

12
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,514
Is he making you work
because he's got no place to go?

13
00:01:22,615 --> 00:01:25,311
- No.
- Have a wonderful weekend, dear.

14
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:30,787
Why is it that a man on his own
is an object of pity

15
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,983
when she's really the one
you should feel sorry for?

16
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:36,460
I don't feel sorry for her.
Those girls do whatever they want.

17
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:39,396
Still working, Campbell?
There's no reason to show off.

18
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:42,161
Cooper's in Montana, Sterling's in Jane

19
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:44,937
- and Draper's on vacation.
- He's not on vacation.

20
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:49,998
He's been in Dallas or Denver or something.
Hilton sent him to every armpit he has.

21
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:53,009
I'd like to get out of town in August once,
even for work.

22
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,081
I love this time of year.

23
00:01:55,348 --> 00:01:59,375
It's quiet. It used to be like this
when I was a kid all the time.

24
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,918
I'd lie in bed at night, hear horses going by.

25
00:02:03,022 --> 00:02:06,651
New York in August?
It's like a great, big, melting wax museum.

26
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:08,590
Nothing but those fat girls
with the hairy armpits

27
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:09,923
putting their feet in the fountain.

28
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:13,192
You know what?
My weekend doesn't look so bad now.

29
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,234
I'll take anybody for a drink who wants one.

30
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:22,236
I poured you a beer.

31
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:27,739
If you were wondering,
there's a Hathaway in there.

32
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:32,079
- The hotel gave me someone else's shirt.
- Then you should complain to Mr. Hilton.

33
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:35,086
- They should be paying you for this.
- There's a hearing,

34
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:37,588
and I'm paid well enough already.

35
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:43,220
- What are they doing out there?
- Catching lightning bugs.

36
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:47,061
You should join them.

37
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:31,167
Yes, this is Elizabeth Draper
from the Junior League of Tarrytown

38
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:33,677
calling for Mrs. Howard Englewood.

39
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:37,480
We're trying to save
the Pleasantville Road Reservoir.

40
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:39,779
When do you expect them back?

41
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:43,517
Well, that's no good.

42
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:46,792
Yes, have a good evening.

43
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:02,300
Draper residence.

44
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:07,243
Just a minute. Don. Come on, Don.
It's for you.

45
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:10,305
It's Mr. Hilton's office.

46
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:20,357
This is Don.

47
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,293
Okay. When?

48
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:27,099
Tuesday night.

49
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:34,133
Pan Am? Sure, send it to my office.

50
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:38,441
You as well.

51
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:45,149
- Where are you going now?
- He wants me to fly out Tuesday night

52
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:47,651
- and join him in Rome.
- Rome?

53
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:52,614
- Well, that's a lot better than Dallas.
- Not for two days it isn't.

54
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:55,353
I'll see the Colosseum from a taxicab.

55
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:58,227
We should've gone to the beach
for the summer.

56
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:01,061
You've been gone the whole time, anyway.

57
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:04,361
First of all, that's not true.

58
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,997
Second, there's nothing stopping you
from coming with me.

59
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:12,177
- You have a passport.
- I guess our two-month-old isn't an issue.

60
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:17,812
We can stay at the Waldorf
anytime we want.

61
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:22,853
- Because that's just like Rome.
- Sorry, Birdie.

62
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:30,055
I gotta catch up on my sleep.

63
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:42,163
<i>- Okay, you're all set. Stand up.
- I am.</i>

64
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,302
Are you okay?

65
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:17,503
- Are you trying to get that in or out?
- It's stuck.

66
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:23,378
- You work for the Lawrences, right?
- I'm very sorry.

67
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:28,981
- You're their au pair, aren't you?
- Yes, but they will send me home.

68
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:33,718
First of all, let's take care of this.

69
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:40,329
- What happened?
- I can't tell you.

70
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:42,264
- Yes, you can.
- I can't.

71
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:46,898
What's your name?

72
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:50,570
- Gudrun.
- My name is Peter.

73
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:54,978
I'm in 14G.
And I'm not going to get you in trouble.

74
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:05,980
I have this party and I borrowed her dress
and this happened.

75
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:10,853
- No one can clean and she's coming home.
- So you thought you would throw it away?

76
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:15,957
They're just going to think you stole it.
Whoa, whoa, wait. Hold on.

77
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:19,730
I don't think you're thinking clearly.

78
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,535
You could put it back in the closet,
and when she takes it out,

79
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:26,476
blame it on the little kids.
They have a girl, right?

80
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:28,444
I would never do this.

81
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:33,050
- When are they coming home?
- Thursday.

82
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:38,148
- Give it to me.
- For what?

83
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,153
Just give it to me.

84
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:52,932
- Let me see what I can do.
- Are you sure?

85
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:56,936
- And people say New York's not friendly.
- Thank you.

86
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,935
Now, I'm not promising anything.
I'll do my best.

87
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,185
Good night.

88
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:24,727
We've read your statement, Mrs. Gumport,
and we appreciate your concern.

89
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,923
- So where is he? We're next.
- I don't know.

90
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:30,560
- Did he say he was coming?
- I didn't speak to him exactly.

91
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,230
Maybe he sent a letter,
a proclamation or something.

92
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:37,332
I believe that completes our old business.
Move onto the new business on the agenda.

93
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:42,403
We will begin with addressing the gas
station signs on South Water Street.

94
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:46,216
Excuse me. I believe there's been
a request for discussion

95
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:49,811
of the Pleasantville Road Reservoir.
It's on the agenda.

96
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:54,922
Somehow that got shifted
into new business.

97
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:57,591
That's definitely old business.

98
00:09:57,697 --> 00:10:01,656
- Who are you exactly?
- She's with me. I'm Mrs. Jack Farrelly,

99
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:05,168
and we're representing
the Junior League of Tarrytown.

100
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:09,970
- Would the trustees please locate the...
- There should be two petitions there.

101
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,071
- Am I late?
- No, you're just in time.

102
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:21,347
We have someone
who'd like to speak on our behalf.

103
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:22,711
Yes.

104
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:26,517
Yes. Mayor, trustees.

105
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:31,757
I'm Henry Francis, Governor Rockefeller's
director of public relations and research,

106
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:37,461
and I've been sent here to deliver this
request on behalf of the governor's office.

107
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:41,097
- Really?
- It's a request that further study is needed,

108
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:43,573
because, as you know,
this project was initiated

109
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:47,339
based on an assumption that
the water quality of the reservoir is lacking.

110
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:49,914
I don't think that was an assumption.
There was a study.

111
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:51,381
With all due respect,

112
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,146
the governor's office believes
that was not conclusive.

113
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:57,882
- May I see that letter?
- I've brought copies for everyone.

114
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:14,970
Very well, Mr. Francis.

115
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:18,572
We appreciate the governor's interest
in our hamlet,

116
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:22,314
and do hereby order the development
of the Pleasantville Road Reservoir

117
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:25,009
be suspended until further notice.

118
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:31,717
Calm down, ladies.
I believe that completes our old business.

119
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:33,586
Move onto the new business on the agenda.

120
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,320
I am so impressed.

121
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:38,491
- So how long will that report take?
- I have no idea,

122
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:42,624
but there's a saying in politics,
"When you have no power, delay. "

123
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:47,603
- Betty says you're from around here.
- Yeah, about 3 miles that way.

124
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,141
I have to get out of here
before Florence Esterhazi comes out

125
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:54,542
- and reiterates the financial report.
- I should be getting back as well.

126
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:56,911
- Are you driving to Albany?
- No.

127
00:11:58,017 --> 00:11:59,746
Well, I'm this way.

128
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:05,985
- They say you can't fight city hall.
- Good night, Francine.

129
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:13,790
Well, this is me.

130
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,400
No station wagon for you, I guess.

131
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:22,200
I have one. It's just, this was my father's.
I thought it would be good luck.

132
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:32,005
So.

133
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,147
So what?

134
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:37,414
Nothing.

135
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:41,983
I'd love to buy you some coffee,
but I don't think there's any place open.

136
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:46,528
I appreciate the offer,
but I should be getting home.

137
00:12:57,676 --> 00:12:59,837
I just want to say thank you.

138
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,513
You really...

139
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:08,914
You really did everything we wanted,
and I know how busy you must be.

140
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:11,581
Well, I think you'll find
that I put my heart into things

141
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:14,056
when something's important to me.

142
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:18,360
Or someone.

143
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:29,975
That is a beautiful car.

144
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,009
He loved it.

145
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,882
I saw how happy you were in there.

146
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:44,218
- I was. I am.
- And I thought, "Dear God.

147
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:48,619
"Did I have anything to do with that?"

148
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:52,428
Because that would make me happy.

149
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:56,595
You did.

150
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:26,120
- Good night.
- Drive safely now.

151
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:58,953
Do you know what happened
to the Hilton cufflinks?

152
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,725
They're little Stetsons, sterling silver.

153
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:04,963
They're in my top drawer.
Bobby was playing with them. They're fine.

154
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:09,640
- Look at that. How'd it go?
- It went very well. We won.

155
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:12,474
We won, we won, we won!

156
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:21,013
- What time are you leaving?
- Car comes at 5:45.

157
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,984
- You're leaving from work?
- Yes.

158
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:32,325
- So they just killed the whole development?
- Not exactly.

159
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:33,921
We had completely forgotten this,

160
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:36,968
but there's a man
from the governor's office,

161
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:38,828
and he pointed out
something we'd forgotten,

162
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,168
which was that the whole project
was based on the idea

163
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:44,800
that the water's no good up there anymore,
which is a lie.

164
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:48,607
It's not true at all, not even a little.
They just made it up.

165
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:53,344
So he ordered another study, you know,
like a chemical analysis of the water,

166
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:57,313
and that could take years,
so I think they'll move on.

167
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:03,660
They should just do it up in Newburgh.
It's already disgusting.

168
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:05,193
That's real politics.

169
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:09,666
Well, you know, when you don't
have any power, you have to delay things.

170
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:27,809
Don.

171
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:30,946
Don.

172
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:35,488
- I'm up. I'm up.
- No, it's not time to wake up.

173
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,859
I want to come with you. Is it too late?

174
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:43,729
What? No.

175
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:49,333
- I can buy you a ticket at the airport.
- Carla can watch them for a few days.

176
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,777
Sure, why not?

177
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:57,840
I know you'll be working the whole time,
but I just want to get on a plane.

178
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:12,763
Pardon me. Do you work here?

179
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,958
The men's room is exactly here,
one floor down.

180
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:17,627
No, I don't need the men's room. I...

181
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:27,905
I can't return this. It has this stain here.

182
00:17:28,013 --> 00:17:30,948
I spilled wine on it
and my wife hasn't forgiven me,

183
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,985
and I'd really appreciate
if you could get me out of the doghouse.

184
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:37,180
I'm sorry, but anyone
could've sewn a tag in this and...

185
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:40,224
Do I look like someone
who wants to steal a dress?

186
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:43,488
- I'll pay for it.
- And I was going to say if we did carry it,

187
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:47,326
it would be from last season,
and I don't know that we still have it.

188
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:50,960
- Let me speak to the manager.
- Of the entire store?

189
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:53,201
Of the republic of dresses.

190
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:57,002
Whoever can help me with this,
because you're falling short.

191
00:17:58,477 --> 00:17:59,944
Just a minute.

192
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:16,757
- May I help you?
- Yes, I...

193
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:20,162
Joan! Is that you?

194
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:24,631
Yes. Yes, it is. How are you?

195
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:27,567
I'm well. Thank you.

196
00:18:29,074 --> 00:18:31,941
I was asking for the manager. I had no idea.

197
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:35,480
Well, I'm just filling in.
They needed some extra help.

198
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:39,576
- I get my pick before they get put out.
- Isn't that smart?

199
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:44,082
- So how can I help you?
- Well, I don't mean to be a bother,

200
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:47,756
I was just hoping someone could.
It's this dress.

201
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:52,053
Trudy spilled wine on it.
She's beside herself.

202
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:54,264
I may have spilled the wine,

203
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:56,698
and I was hoping to exchange it
or replace it,

204
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,396
whichever will get me out
of the ladies dresses department.

205
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:00,631
May I?

206
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:04,405
It is our merchandise.

207
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:10,615
- This one's small. I don't see Trudy in a 10.
- It doesn't fit great, but she loves it.

208
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,551
- It's very...
- It's very summery.

209
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,212
Give me a moment.

210
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:29,490
Take this down to customer service.
They'll send someone to the stockroom.

211
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:32,967
- It'll be boxed up, but I'm sure we have it.
- I'm willing to pay for it, of course.

212
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:36,905
- It's all taken care of.
- Well, that's very generous.

213
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,911
Thank you. So how are you?

214
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,474
Never been better.
How are things at the office?

215
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,210
Moneypenny hasn't self-destructed,

216
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:49,378
but it's just a matter of time.
And how are you?

217
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:54,555
I think I told you already. I'm very well.
Greg is just finishing up his residency.

218
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,321
He's actually thinking about
a new specialty.

219
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:59,397
You know doctors.
Whatever's the latest thing.

220
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:01,596
And what would that be?

221
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:04,133
Psychiatry.

222
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,935
I'll take the dress and you take that.

223
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:12,469
Thank you so much
for getting me out of a scrape.

224
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:14,177
And I'd appreciate it

225
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:17,715
if you should happen to run into Trudy
that you be discreet.

226
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:19,943
The whole incident was fraught with drama.

227
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:22,747
Of course. This never happened.

228
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:27,088
Nice to see you again.

229
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:43,265
Wow.

230
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:46,066
It's beautiful.

231
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:53,415
- What is that smell?
- Which one?

232
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:57,546
It's like rubber or diesel.

233
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:02,221
I can barely stand up.
Let me see what's going on.

234
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:46,094
Sorry. I haven't changed my money yet.

235
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:49,571
<i>No, signore. Thank you.
American dollar is very good.</i>

236
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:51,305
Thank you.

237
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:58,316
$2, Don? That's what he makes in a week.

238
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,051
Don, look.

239
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:20,761
<i>- I'm sorry. Is this the Drapers' room?
- Yes, this is Mrs. Draper.</i>

240
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:24,606
Is it? Well, it's high time I got to meet you.

241
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:27,711
This must be Mr. Hilton.

242
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:30,281
<i>Connie. Please.</i>

243
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:34,544
- Welcome to Rome.
- Thank you. I'm happy to be here.

244
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:37,817
I want you to put my staff
through its traces.

245
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:41,116
No complaint's too small.
I'd kick you up to a suite,

246
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:43,751
but I want Don to see the way this works
for most people.

247
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,823
<i>- It's lovely.
- When I see you tonight,</i>

248
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:49,426
I want to hear all about it.

249
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:45,788
I so, so appreciate this.
It's an hour or two at the most.

250
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:48,018
The board is trying to jap us
with a sudden meeting.

251
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:49,889
Ernie, I'm leaving!

252
00:24:15,086 --> 00:24:18,852
You're drinking alone.
This is, in Rome, not in the law.

253
00:25:15,146 --> 00:25:16,613
Whiskey, neat.

254
00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:24,444
- May I join you?
- Yankee. Hey, go home.

255
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:27,484
It's an American millionaire.

256
00:25:32,397 --> 00:25:35,389
- Are they making fun of me?
- A little bit.

257
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:41,669
I'm only in Rome for one night.
I won't have my heart broken.

258
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:02,321
- Room 763.
- That's right near my room.

259
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:07,862
<i>Good night, signorina.</i>

260
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:17,239
- To whatever they were saying.
- They said you were ugly.

261
00:26:19,778 --> 00:26:21,541
Does that bother you?

262
00:26:22,647 --> 00:26:26,174
You think because of the way I'm dressed
that I'm shallow?

263
00:26:26,284 --> 00:26:28,616
I was just hoping you were easy.

264
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:33,391
- They said that, too.
- What brings you to Rome?

265
00:26:36,795 --> 00:26:38,786
Seen anything interesting?

266
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:48,129
- I could take it or leave it.
- Well, look at the lovebirds, will you?

267
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:52,305
Connie, this is my wife, Betty.

268
00:26:57,515 --> 00:27:00,416
By golly, you are an indecently lucky man.

269
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:09,088
By golly, he's nutty.

270
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:13,420
He's something.

271
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,867
He adores you.

272
00:27:20,905 --> 00:27:22,270
You're tiny.

273
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:24,902
He does.

274
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:28,103
Now I can see
what all the fuss has been about.

275
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:30,340
He sees great things in you.

276
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:55,627
- Where are we going?
- We're going for ice cream.

277
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,463
That's a grand idea.

278
00:28:57,602 --> 00:29:00,503
Close your window.
My hair is getting mussed.

279
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:03,373
- How was your day?
- Okay.

280
00:29:04,175 --> 00:29:06,575
- Do I look pretty?
- I guess so.

281
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:11,141
Hey, what are you doing?

282
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:14,309
Sally and Ernie sitting in a tree.

283
00:29:17,188 --> 00:29:19,281
K- I-S-S-I-N-G...

284
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:20,584
Shut up! I mean it!

285
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:21,784
First comes love...

286
00:29:21,893 --> 00:29:23,326
- Shut up!
- Then comes...

287
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:24,622
Stop it!

288
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:29,598
- I said shut up!
- Hey, hey, hey! That's enough!

289
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:34,433
- She hurt me.
- He hit me first.

290
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:37,239
- She was kissing Ernie.
- I was not!

291
00:29:37,342 --> 00:29:40,175
All right! Both of you, separate rooms.

292
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:44,142
I'm not gonna let Ernie and Jessica
visit anymore.

293
00:29:56,394 --> 00:30:01,161
Well, aren't you a lucky girl?
Go ahead, open it. Make sure it's right.

294
00:30:11,075 --> 00:30:12,303
It's like new!

295
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:15,311
They just exchanged it. No questions asked.

296
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:19,075
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Peter, from my heart.

297
00:30:20,018 --> 00:30:24,216
- I promise I never do this again.
- It's all right. It never happened.

298
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:26,285
We should celebrate.

299
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:29,858
- I don't know.
- What do you like to drink?

300
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:34,193
You're German, right?
I can get us some beer or a Riesling.

301
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:36,227
Schnapps?

302
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:39,794
You are so nice,

303
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:43,106
but I have my boyfriend.

304
00:30:46,077 --> 00:30:48,568
Thank you so much to do this for me.

305
00:30:50,481 --> 00:30:52,108
Glad I could help.

306
00:30:55,753 --> 00:30:57,084
Good night.

307
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:35,386
- I woke you.
- What do you want?

308
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:39,152
I went to a lot of trouble
to solve your dress problem,

309
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:42,324
and I think I at least deserve
to see it on you.

310
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:47,460
Okay, but you have to be very quiet.

311
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:02,978
- This is cozy.
- I'll go get the dress.

312
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:14,860
I'd like to kiss you.

313
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:44,687
- Hello?
- Did I wake you?

314
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:50,230
<i>- No. No, I'm up.
- Can I interest you two in some breakfast?</i>

315
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:54,868
Breakfast? Sure, let me just...

316
00:32:55,673 --> 00:32:56,731
Stay.

317
00:32:56,975 --> 00:33:01,912
You know, Connie, Betty's telling me she
already ordered breakfast up to the room.

318
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,512
<i>- Can I meet you afterwards?
- Of course.</i>

319
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:07,178
You let me know
how you like the room service.

320
00:33:12,223 --> 00:33:15,124
- Did you hear the bells this morning?
- I did.

321
00:33:17,128 --> 00:33:19,824
I like sleeping on this side of the bed.

322
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,072
I have to get up.

323
00:33:43,988 --> 00:33:46,923
Order something. He wants a full report.

324
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:21,148
Well, hello.

325
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:23,426
Welcome home.

326
00:34:24,662 --> 00:34:28,098
- How is everybody?
- Everyone's fine. How was your trip?

327
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:30,391
It was short but sweet.

328
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:33,897
Well, good. I'm going to get my things.

329
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:37,637
Just one more thing.

330
00:34:38,543 --> 00:34:41,137
- You might want to talk to Sally.
- Why?

331
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:44,280
- She'll tell you.
- Carla, you brought it up.

332
00:34:45,783 --> 00:34:48,479
I keep talking to her about that temper.

333
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:52,417
I'm gonna go check the mail.
Do you want anything?

334
00:34:54,459 --> 00:34:59,260
She kissed Ernie Hanson. Bobby was
teasing her, and she really went after him.

335
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,657
Okay. It's okay.

336
00:35:03,801 --> 00:35:07,328
- Thank you for telling me.
- I think they just missed you.

337
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:09,403
Wouldn't that be nice?

338
00:35:12,543 --> 00:35:14,977
Well, I missed you. You know that?

339
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:30,293
Mr. Campbell. Ed Lawrence, 14C.

340
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:34,161
Yes, of course. How are you, Ed?

341
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:38,200
- Is your wife at home?
- No.

342
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:42,772
- Can I come in for a minute?
- Of course.

343
00:35:48,613 --> 00:35:52,549
- What are you drinking, Ed?
- I have a martini waiting next door.

344
00:35:52,717 --> 00:35:53,979
Let me make this quick.

345
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:56,883
You know we have this German au pair
working for us?

346
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:59,513
- No, I didn't know that.
- Yes, you do.

347
00:36:01,792 --> 00:36:05,023
- I don't know what she said...
- Please, just relax.

348
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:08,999
I know it's August and all the cats are away,

349
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:13,264
but I just spent one of my precious
vacation days refilling the Kleenex boxes.

350
00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:16,033
- I don't understand.
- Would you drop it?

351
00:36:16,807 --> 00:36:21,210
I've had four months without any tears,
Mr. Campbell. Four quiet months.

352
00:36:21,379 --> 00:36:25,281
You know how hard it is to find someone
my wife can get along with?

353
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:26,816
And now this.

354
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:35,250
Look, there are plenty of nannies
in this neighborhood.

355
00:36:35,493 --> 00:36:39,725
Stay away from her.
In fact, be smart. Stay out of the building.

356
00:36:41,732 --> 00:36:44,098
- I'm very sorry.
- It'll be fine.

357
00:36:46,003 --> 00:36:48,233
Enjoy the rest of your summer.

358
00:36:57,248 --> 00:36:59,614
- Bobby, sit down.
- Mayday! Mayday!

359
00:37:06,924 --> 00:37:08,516
Daddy doesn't know,

360
00:37:08,626 --> 00:37:12,062
but Carla told me you were fighting
while we were gone.

361
00:37:13,965 --> 00:37:15,091
Sally.

362
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,492
- Carla was very upset.
- It's not fair. I didn't do anything.

363
00:37:19,604 --> 00:37:23,199
That's it. You apologize to Bobby
and you learn to control your temper,

364
00:37:23,307 --> 00:37:26,470
or I'm going to have
to start taking things away.

365
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:31,313
- I'm sorry I hit you.
- That's okay.

366
00:37:36,621 --> 00:37:40,614
I called the office. Hilton sent a packet over
before we even left.

367
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:42,022
I'm sorry.

368
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:45,127
- Going swimming?
- Are we?

369
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:47,788
Yes.

370
00:37:57,375 --> 00:37:58,933
See you tonight.

371
00:38:10,087 --> 00:38:11,748
Yes, but what you really would've enjoyed

372
00:38:11,856 --> 00:38:15,019
was watching my father struggle
with the sailboat.

373
00:38:17,261 --> 00:38:18,626
Well, hello.

374
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:21,090
Hello.

375
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:26,735
- Is everybody having a good summer?
- Very nice. Very hot.

376
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:40,917
I see Marta came.
Or did you keep it this way yourself?

377
00:38:46,857 --> 00:38:50,987
- I did my best.
- My little bachelor. Come over here.

378
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:08,511
I missed you.

379
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:12,941
I missed every part of you.

380
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:17,219
- Trudy, I have to get to work.
- I don't care.

381
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:24,587
Peter.

382
00:39:26,397 --> 00:39:30,800
You always get that guilty look
on your face when we see little children.

383
00:39:31,268 --> 00:39:32,633
I told you.

384
00:39:33,637 --> 00:39:35,070
I don't care.

385
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:39,639
You're my husband. I want what you want.

386
00:39:44,982 --> 00:39:47,007
Did you miss me? A little?

387
00:39:53,491 --> 00:39:54,924
What's wrong?

388
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:03,488
Peter. Look at me. Did something happen?

389
00:40:27,992 --> 00:40:31,257
- Sally, get down here.
- Coming.

390
00:40:47,411 --> 00:40:51,711
I want you to know that I think
Ernie Hanson is a very nice little boy,

391
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:55,984
but I don't want you running around
just kissing boys.

392
00:40:57,321 --> 00:41:00,848
- I wasn't.
- And you don't kiss boys. Boys kiss you.

393
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:06,495
The first kiss is very special.

394
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:10,127
But I already did it. It's over.

395
00:41:14,405 --> 00:41:17,272
You're going to have a lot of first kisses.

396
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:21,211
You're going to want it to be special,
so you remember.

397
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:28,812
It's where you go from being a stranger
to knowing someone,

398
00:41:29,787 --> 00:41:33,746
and every kiss with him after that
is a shadow of that kiss.

399
00:41:39,296 --> 00:41:40,923
Do you understand?

400
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:44,898
I think so.

401
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:49,199
Go play.

402
00:42:13,664 --> 00:42:15,825
- Hello.
- Hello.

403
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:20,462
I made some cold salads,
hearts of palm, tomatoes, olives.

404
00:42:21,171 --> 00:42:22,468
Wonderful.

405
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:24,841
- Do you want a drink?
- No.

406
00:42:28,512 --> 00:42:32,175
I walked down Lexington
and they opened a new fruit market,

407
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:34,578
but other than the melons,
most of it was unremarkable,

408
00:42:34,685 --> 00:42:37,119
so I stopped in Butterfield Market

409
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:41,018
and they had all of the stone fruits
and beautiful cherries and I thought...

410
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:44,458
- Trudy.
... maybe I'd make a fruit salad for dessert.

411
00:42:48,365 --> 00:42:49,423
What?

412
00:42:51,535 --> 00:42:54,561
I don't want you to go away anymore
without me.

413
00:43:07,217 --> 00:43:09,583
Good. I won't.

414
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,960
Tell me, what happened at work today?

415
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:31,131
Well, Kinsey invented some contraption

416
00:43:31,241 --> 00:43:33,732
that can shoot a water balloon
across the office.

417
00:43:33,844 --> 00:43:36,745
- We filled it with ketchup.
- Did you?

418
00:43:39,183 --> 00:43:42,710
I have $5 for Carla.
She watched the kids for me.

419
00:43:42,987 --> 00:43:45,979
The board called a secret meeting
about the reservoir.

420
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:48,524
- I think they reversed us.
- Really?

421
00:43:49,326 --> 00:43:50,623
We'll see.

422
00:43:51,695 --> 00:43:56,496
- So did you go to the catacombs?
- No.

423
00:43:58,002 --> 00:44:00,163
Throw a coin in the fountain?

424
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:05,766
- You did have a good time, didn't you?
- You want some?

425
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:09,438
The kids didn't eat it at all.
I put them to bed.

426
00:44:11,248 --> 00:44:15,207
Carlton and I went to Lake George
for a week after Jess was born.

427
00:44:16,587 --> 00:44:18,350
No problems, no kids.

428
00:44:20,457 --> 00:44:21,947
It was magical.

429
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:26,329
We have to do that again.

430
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:32,094
I'm afraid we may have to be vigilant
about the reservoir.

431
00:44:32,603 --> 00:44:37,472
Although, it'd be an excuse for you
to get more help from high places.

432
00:44:39,243 --> 00:44:42,041
I'm done with that. We made our stand.

433
00:44:43,614 --> 00:44:47,345
Sunny Madrid. Doesn't that sound
like it would do the trick?

434
00:44:48,819 --> 00:44:50,377
I've never been.

435
00:44:56,393 --> 00:44:58,953
- Welcome home.
- Hello, Francine.

436
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:03,394
Well, I should be going.

437
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:06,401
From what I hear,
you two must be very tired.

438
00:45:08,238 --> 00:45:10,001
Good night, Francine.

439
00:45:26,457 --> 00:45:28,425
- Hey.
- Don't.

440
00:45:31,161 --> 00:45:33,254
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong?

441
00:45:33,797 --> 00:45:36,391
I hate this place. I hate our friends.

442
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,825
- I hate this town.
- Betts.

443
00:45:41,105 --> 00:45:43,699
We'll go away again. You know we will.

444
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:49,504
Do me a favor. Look on your pillow.

445
00:45:57,688 --> 00:45:58,882
Open it.

446
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,587
I saw it in the gift shop,

447
00:46:04,695 --> 00:46:07,596
but we were leaving,
so I had Connie send it.

448
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:11,298
It's lovely.

449
00:46:13,003 --> 00:46:15,403
I'll have it put on your bracelet.

450
00:46:20,177 --> 00:46:21,906
Then I can have something to look at

451
00:46:22,012 --> 00:46:25,345
when I tell the story
about the time we went to Rome.
