1
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:54,480
Mrs. Draper, sorry about the chill in here,

2
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:56,782
but my wife took the oil heater upstairs.

3
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,482
I'm fine.

4
00:00:58,591 --> 00:01:00,149
So, as I thought last week,

5
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,660
the spotting was not caused
by your horseback riding,

6
00:01:02,762 --> 00:01:05,424
but rather, as I suspected,

7
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:07,022
you're going to have another baby.

8
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,362
Really?

9
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:12,836
Well, we've been here before.

10
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:15,169
You'll have to start
eating right, sleeping,

11
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:16,674
avoid strenuous activity,

12
00:01:16,776 --> 00:01:18,107
no riding.

13
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:19,701
Just take it easy.

14
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:22,407
That's what husbands are for.

15
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:24,676
I can't believe this.

16
00:01:24,784 --> 00:01:27,048
I understand this was a surprise,

17
00:01:27,153 --> 00:01:29,747
but blessings come that way.

18
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:32,086
Of course.

19
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:36,993
I'll need you to undress
so I can examine you.

20
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:42,932
Dr. Aldridge, are you sure?

21
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:46,472
Are you concerned
about your appearance?

22
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:50,304
You've been blessed
with a very resilient figure.

23
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:55,177
Dr. Aldridge, I can't
have a baby right now.

24
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:04,513
Mrs. Draper, if we're having
the conversation I think we're having,

25
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:08,025
there are alternatives, obviously.

26
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:11,863
But I find it hard to believe that,

27
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,330
as a married woman of means,

28
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:15,560
you would even be considering that.

29
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:21,231
That is an option for young girls
who have no other options.

30
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:27,011
I guarantee,

31
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:30,048
the minute you tell your husband,
your friends,

32
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,550
you'll stop worrying.

33
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,449
Get in the swing of things.

34
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:38,490
Let's see if I can wrestle
that heater from Charlene.

35
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,906
With love from Ken Cosgrove
and Pete Campbell.

36
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,142
Why'd you need it today?

37
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,912
Cooper wanted the ad
revenue projections early.

38
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,317
Why?

39
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:10,719
Great. Clearasil is missing.

40
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:12,120
Honestly, I don't know.

41
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:13,920
You don't think it's anything to do

42
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,018
with Draper being AWOL
in California, do you?

43
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:17,790
No, I figured that out.

44
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:20,832
Campbell says there's
an aerospace gold rush.

45
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:22,401
I bet Draper's landing a big one.

46
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:26,104
I haven't heard anything.

47
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:29,767
Or he's breaking off,
opening his own shop in L.A.

48
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:33,972
Or he's finding a good spot
for Sterling Cooper West.

49
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,014
I'd love to go to California.

50
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:37,241
I could get a convertible.

51
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,808
Whatever it is, they're evaluating us.

52
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,547
If Kennedy's speech goes past 8:30...

53
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:45,180
that's Lucy and then Danny Thomas
and then Andy Griffith...

54
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,350
I'll take it in the shorts.

55
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:50,020
Why am I sick to my stomach?

56
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:57,961
Good. You're here.

57
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:01,131
I'm waiting on a call
from North American Aviation.

58
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,606
It's 10:00 there.

59
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:04,040
They should just be getting into work.

60
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:06,976
I was just wondering if you told anybody
about Clearasil yet.

61
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,049
I guess it must have slipped my mind.

62
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:11,776
I don't know what's going on,
but Harry said

63
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:13,852
there's some kind of
emergency accounting.

64
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:15,921
Everybody had to turn in
their numbers early.

65
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:20,823
What am I gonna say to Duck?

66
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,952
That my father-in-law hates me?

67
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:25,929
Pete, just tell the truth.

68
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:27,499
Don't worry about the outcome.

69
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,431
People respect that.

70
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,194
Thank you.

71
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,973
I don't want you blaming Creative.

72
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:13,201
How long have you been here?

73
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,873
Half an hour.

74
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,347
I didn't want to bother you.

75
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,044
Where have you been?

76
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,814
You disappeared.

77
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:26,117
I had to have some time
to think about things.

78
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:28,887
Must be nice.

79
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,520
Needing time and just taking it,

80
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:33,462
all on your own terms,

81
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:35,033
not wondering what anybody thinks...

82
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:36,396
me, the children...

83
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:37,764
Bets.

84
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:43,366
I'd do anything I could
to undo what happened.

85
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:47,811
What happened?

86
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:52,375
I was not respectful to you.

87
00:05:57,457 --> 00:05:59,891
Well, now I know I'm not crazy.

88
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:01,619
That helps.

89
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:05,363
I can't walk away from this.

90
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:09,396
I want to be with you.

91
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:11,663
I want to be together again.

92
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:15,099
I don't know.

93
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,199
Honestly, things haven't been

94
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,709
that different without you.

95
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,818
I need to see the kids.

96
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:30,983
I can't deal with this right now, Don.

97
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:32,250
I'll call.

98
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:33,950
We'll make arrangements.

99
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,328
Thank you for seeing me.

100
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:46,268
What's your poison?

101
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:47,532
I don't know.

102
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,540
It's okay, Campbell.

103
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:51,166
Whatever you're having.

104
00:06:58,551 --> 00:06:59,711
Sit down.

105
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:10,521
Clearasil is pulling out.

106
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,530
Sales are strong, Creative is strong,

107
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:15,658
but we are not suited
for business together.

108
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:18,334
Your father-in-law.

109
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,030
Yes.

110
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:22,535
That's a sticky wicket.

111
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:24,439
Indeed.

112
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:26,535
I'm working on something to replace it.

113
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:31,307
Campbell, I'm counting
on your discretion here.

114
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:34,181
Okay.

115
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,687
The British agency
Putnam, Powell & Lowe

116
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:39,155
is taking a controlling share
of Sterling Cooper.

117
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:42,523
Clearasil is in conflict
with Lever Brothers.

118
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:43,595
We're merging...

119
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:46,130
well, being merged with.

120
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:49,065
Your loyalty and enthusiasm
during the American Airlines thing

121
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:50,362
showed real character.

122
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:52,829
Thank you.

123
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:55,430
I'd like you to replace me
as head of Accounts.

124
00:07:57,343 --> 00:07:58,970
I'm trusting you with this information

125
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:00,340
because I am going
to be the president

126
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:01,674
of the new Sterling Cooper.

127
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:07,544
Congratulations.

128
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,450
Congratulations to you.

129
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:14,693
I don't know what to say.

130
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:18,161
You say "Thank you,"
and then you don't say anything.

131
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:20,562
Such news has to be
broken in the right way.

132
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,765
Is Don on board with my promotion?

133
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:26,031
I'm the president.

134
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:28,197
I don't need his permission, do I?

135
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:29,433
Right.

136
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:31,373
If Don shows up, he'll fall in line.

137
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:33,172
He'll have to,
or find another profession.

138
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:38,410
That's why God put
non-compete clauses in contracts.

139
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,486
Well...

140
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:41,553
thank you.

141
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:50,088
Good evening, my fellow citizens.

142
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:53,165
This government, as promised,

143
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:56,565
has maintained the closest surveillance

144
00:08:56,669 --> 00:09:00,503
of the Soviet military buildup
on the island of Cuba.

145
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:03,200
Within the past week,

146
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:06,540
unmistakable evidence
has established the fact

147
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:09,706
that a series of offensive missile sites

148
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:11,976
is now in preparation

149
00:09:12,084 --> 00:09:14,245
on that imprisoned island.

150
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:17,880
The purpose of these bases
can be none other

151
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:21,050
than to provide
a nuclear strike capability

152
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,458
against the Western Hemisphere.

153
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,964
Upon receiving the first
preliminary hard information

154
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,658
of this nature,

155
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:31,601
last Tuesday morning at 9:00 a.m.,

156
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:35,003
I directed that our
surveillance be stepped up.

157
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:36,540
And having now confirmed...

158
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:37,870
...the Soviet Union

159
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:40,741
for supplying Cuba in this
new military buildup

160
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:44,407
and asked Russia to stop
arming Castro's Cuba.

161
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:47,008
The President did not order
a direct military action...

162
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:48,017
Welcome back.

163
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,451
Hildy.

164
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:50,487
...if we are prepared

165
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,887
to sink Russian ships carrying...

166
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:53,117
...Eastern Daylight Time,

167
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:54,692
the Armed Forces of the United States

168
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:57,126
are under instructions to stop...

169
00:09:57,229 --> 00:09:59,697
Mr. Draper, you're
a sight for sore eyes.

170
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:02,029
Hello, Joan. It's good to be back.

171
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:03,192
How are you?

172
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:05,668
Like everyone else today,
very distracted.

173
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,033
Don.

174
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:08,401
Hello, Peggy.

175
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:11,032
You look well. How was California?

176
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:12,542
Sunny.

177
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:14,078
Do I work for you now?

178
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,114
I hope it's okay.

179
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:17,842
Mr. Sterling gave me
permission to switch.

180
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:20,982
I landed the Popsicle account.

181
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:24,755
So, other than her office and haircut,

182
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:26,222
is there anything new
I need to know about?

183
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:27,952
After you.

184
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:37,903
The world continues without us.

185
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:40,472
There's no reason to take it personally.

186
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:43,041
Do you want to know
if you've been missed?

187
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:45,906
That's half your correspondence.

188
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:49,709
Mr. Sterling has been very anxious
to speak to you on a daily basis,

189
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,442
and Mr. Phillips, of course.

190
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,541
I'll need the copywriters
and Sal in here

191
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,018
to get me up to speed.

192
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:56,383
Call Roger in a half an hour

193
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,047
and tell him I'll meet him
in a half an hour.

194
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,125
And Mr. Phillips...

195
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:01,853
maybe I'll run into him
in the men's room.

196
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:03,326
I sent your paychecks home.

197
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:05,454
I assume you've spoken to Mrs. Draper.

198
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:07,225
Did she call?

199
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,164
Not today.

200
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:12,461
I think that's enough to start.

201
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:19,272
We have a safety protocol
for Civil Defense.

202
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:20,868
I don't want to start a panic,

203
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,971
but I think people
have the right to know.

204
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:25,380
Trust me. I don't think
there'll be a point

205
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:28,419
in taking those stairs
or diving under a desk.

206
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:31,751
So, you're back.

207
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:38,094
What happened?

208
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,427
One minute I'm standing
next to you in the carport,

209
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,865
and the next I'm tap dancing
for General Dynamics.

210
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:45,596
Sorry I missed that.

211
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,263
I can't drive, Don.

212
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:48,840
It's amazing I made any meetings at all.

213
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:49,999
But you did.

214
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:51,440
Of course I did.

215
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,670
Did you ever think I'd left you there

216
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:54,006
because I thought
you could handle it?

217
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:58,045
How did it go?

218
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:01,779
I'm this close
to North American Aviation.

219
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,718
Then I was right, wasn't I?

220
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:06,053
You handled it.

221
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:07,682
Good work.

222
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:14,032
I know you want everything
the minute you want it.

223
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:16,658
Sometimes it's better
to wait until you're ready.

224
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:19,329
So you think I'm ready?

225
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:20,803
Yes.

226
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,430
You proved it.

227
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:28,245
Now I have to play
a little catch-up ball.

228
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:30,212
Of course.

229
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,949
Welcome back, Don.

230
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:49,794
You wanted to see me?

231
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:51,893
About three weeks ago.

232
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:54,472
Hope you were looking
for a job in California,

233
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:56,438
because you're going to need one.

234
00:12:56,542 --> 00:13:00,000
I'll stack my absences
up against yours any day.

235
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:02,273
You can't just do that.

236
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:04,008
It was important.

237
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,778
And from what I can see,
the walls are still standing.

238
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:07,784
They are.

239
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:09,718
But we sold them

240
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:12,154
and the rest of the company
to Putnam, Powell & Lowe.

241
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:13,850
What?

242
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,051
It's done.

243
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:17,425
They're coming in Friday
to discuss strategy,

244
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,225
management structure, and logistics.

245
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:22,061
You'll find one of these
buried in a stack of crap on your desk.

246
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:25,466
So how much?

247
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:28,438
You'll clear a little
over half a million dollars.

248
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:32,604
Best vacation you ever took.

249
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,808
Look who suddenly
has nothing to say.

250
00:13:38,884 --> 00:13:40,909
Duck put it together.

251
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:43,679
Ran into them in a bar or something.

252
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:45,723
Duck was in a bar?

253
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,259
He doesn't have a wife.

254
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,123
Any conflicts?

255
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:53,198
Well, Mona hasn't been pleasant
since my engagement.

256
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:55,392
No. With the deal.

257
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,469
But congratulations.

258
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:58,832
Thank you.

259
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,468
Very few conflicts.

260
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:05,100
Coop and Alice jumped on it.

261
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:06,838
I wasn't going to make trouble.

262
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:10,745
Well, now you can go
back to your office

263
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,681
and figure out
how much I made on this.

264
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:16,313
I guess so.

265
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,490
Kennedy's daring them to bomb us,

266
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:25,189
right when I got a second chance.

267
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:27,955
We don't know what's really going on.

268
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:29,432
You know that.

269
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:36,366
As Mr. Khrushchev and Mr. Castro

270
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:40,434
push our leadership towards
the threat of nuclear war,

271
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:43,276
it is tempting to be angry.

272
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,577
But I urge all of you to remember

273
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:48,346
that even on the cross

274
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:50,945
Jesus forgave his transgressors.

275
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:55,789
And although we cannot control
these frightening events,

276
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:59,991
let us take charge of our own souls,

277
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:02,465
and let us prepare ourselves

278
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:05,901
for the most important
summit meeting of all.

279
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,772
And so we pray.

280
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:15,812
We are all sinners, every one of us,

281
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:20,978
but at least give us the courage

282
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:23,418
and the common sense

283
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:25,649
to admit it,

284
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:28,591
to confess it,

285
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:30,685
and to repair it.

286
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:34,361
And give us the assurance

287
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:39,494
that when this temporary
life on earth ends,

288
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:42,699
we will be welcomed
back into your arms

289
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:45,902
in your heavenly kingdom.

290
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:47,501
Amen.

291
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:05,561
She's awfully quiet.

292
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:08,326
I think I know what that's about.

293
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:10,527
She's terrified like the rest of us.

294
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,161
I think she's being smug
because she has a bomb shelter.

295
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:16,207
Really? I don't even like to go
in the subway.

296
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,536
There's no air.

297
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,736
I prefer you stop talking about this.

298
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:21,710
You're upsetting my daughter.

299
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,476
Well, The Times says you should tell
your children the truth.

300
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,574
You tell your children.

301
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:30,553
Carlton says he heard
the market crashed

302
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,886
because there are Russian
troops off Key West.

303
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,289
They're closing the Interstate.

304
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:35,724
They can't do that.

305
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,455
Marie, I'm about to leave.

306
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:39,656
I'm done, okay?

307
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:44,695
It's nice to feel the warmth
of the community in a time of crisis.

308
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:47,738
Mrs. Draper, I'll be with you in a minute.

309
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:52,842
I wish we had a shelter
so I could slam the door in her face.

310
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,171
Betty, you're wan.

311
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:00,477
Do you want a Miltown?

312
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:02,986
It's the only thing that's keeping me
from chewing my nails off.

313
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:04,578
No.

314
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,621
I'm pregnant.

315
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:19,268
Congratulations?

316
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:24,300
Jessica was an accident.

317
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,435
Look how happy I am now.

318
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:29,036
It's not a good time.

319
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:30,615
But is it ever?

320
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,775
Look at this world we live in.

321
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:37,788
I can't do it.

322
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:41,754
What am I going to do?

323
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,488
Well, what can you do?

324
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:48,191
I don't think you understand.

325
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,064
It's not a good time.

326
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:55,467
Are you serious?

327
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:58,338
Yes.

328
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:03,074
There's a doctor in Albany.

329
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:06,049
If you go to Puerto Rico,
they do it in a hospital.

330
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:08,483
Of course you don't want
to go down there right now.

331
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,145
No.

332
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,324
Sometimes the best thing

333
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,951
is just to do nothing and wait.

334
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:20,456
Mrs. Draper, I'm ready for you.

335
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:25,963
I'll come by and check on you.

336
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:28,904
No, I'm fine. You're probably right.

337
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:41,751
What are you doing in here?

338
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:43,048
And where's Virginia?

339
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:44,213
The Soviets fired on us,

340
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:46,188
or we fired on them
or something. Fix it.

341
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,225
I came in to get away
from this speculation.

342
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,997
Damn it. You see what you did?

343
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:58,831
I hope the Soviets got a guy like you
to build those missiles.

344
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:00,734
Everyone's looking
at each other in the street.

345
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:03,399
They're looking at you
because you've got Castro's beard.

346
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:08,108
Now they want a list of people
in all the departments.

347
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:10,875
So? That's you and Danny Lindstrom.

348
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,450
They're counting all the money.

349
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:14,109
They're counting all the people.

350
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:15,777
You said this was about an L.A. Office.

351
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:17,981
You told us it wasn't bad.

352
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,422
Someone knows what's going on.

353
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:22,494
I swear, if it wasn't important,

354
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:23,754
I wouldn't have asked.

355
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:29,062
We're doing what we can.

356
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,261
The phone company's
completely overloaded.

357
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:35,033
Actually, Lois,
this is more of a security issue.

358
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,404
Certain calls may have been made

359
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:39,841
using the code words "Los Angeles."

360
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:41,310
Lois, have you heard anything

361
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:43,108
about them opening
a West Coast office?

362
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:46,150
You know I'm not allowed
to talk about what I hear in there.

363
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:47,582
You can tell us.

364
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,085
It's not going to hurt you.

365
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,486
We'll really owe you.

366
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:54,517
Well...

367
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:01,559
Have you ever heard
of Putnam, Powell & Lowe?

368
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:03,225
London?

369
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:05,326
Yes. Trans-Atlantic.

370
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:09,840
Mr. Phillips has made a deal
for them to buy Sterling Cooper.

371
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:13,204
No.

372
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:14,279
No!

373
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:16,745
It's done.
They take the keys Friday.

374
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:18,713
Are they purchasing
Sterling Cooper,

375
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:22,184
or are they combining with them?

376
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,622
It's a merger.

377
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,624
From what we could put together,

378
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,284
they want a New York office,

379
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:31,624
and they want it filled with us,

380
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:37,032
but there's definitely
going to be some...

381
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:39,069
redundancies.

382
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:46,607
Thank you.

383
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:47,838
Wait a minute.

384
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:50,176
If any of you gets to stay,

385
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:53,445
one of you has to take me
off the switchboard.

386
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:55,315
Yeah. Of course.

387
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,751
Lf.

388
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:04,227
- Daddy!
- Daddy!

389
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:09,495
We missed you.

390
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:10,761
I missed you, too.

391
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:17,164
I like your hotel room.

392
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,870
There's a rollaway
there for you, Bobby.

393
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:23,414
We can go to the movies
or Chinese food.

394
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:25,483
I want you to behave yourselves,

395
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:26,642
and brush your teeth.

396
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:28,913
Do you want to join us?

397
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:30,215
Mommy doesn't like to eat.

398
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:33,485
No, I have plans.

399
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:36,425
Do you want to pick them up
in my office tomorrow?

400
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:38,519
No, drop them off in the morning.

401
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,428
I'm going riding. Carla will be there.

402
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:43,694
Okay.

403
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,326
Good night.

404
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:46,734
Good night.

405
00:21:46,838 --> 00:21:48,965
Good night, Mommy.

406
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:58,273
Can we order room service?

407
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:50,100
How can I help you?

408
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,726
Can I get a glass of water?

409
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:53,099
Sure.

410
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,909
What else?

411
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:03,503
I don't know.

412
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:05,583
A gimlet.

413
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:19,919
Thank you.

414
00:23:20,031 --> 00:23:23,432
The gentleman's taken care of it.

415
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:29,472
Tell him I said thank you.

416
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:30,939
I will,

417
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:33,602
but it means he's going
to come talk to you.

418
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:36,078
We'll see about that.

419
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:01,537
I think this is the place to be tonight.

420
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,801
I walked through Times Square.

421
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:04,933
Empty.

422
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:08,476
Doesn't seem real, does it?

423
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,673
That's true.

424
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:13,307
You don't look worried.

425
00:24:13,418 --> 00:24:15,886
I'm trying not to think about it.

426
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:19,354
To not thinking about things.

427
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:24,861
What's your name?

428
00:24:26,998 --> 00:24:29,899
Thank you so much for the drink.

429
00:24:30,001 --> 00:24:32,697
I'd just like to enjoy it,
if you don't mind.

430
00:24:33,905 --> 00:24:36,305
No. Of course.

431
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:37,966
Nice meeting you.

432
00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:40,010
...degrees for New York City.

433
00:24:40,111 --> 00:24:41,305
Cloudy skies.

434
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:43,278
Further action of an unspecified nature

435
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:44,575
is being considered to deal

436
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:47,151
with the continuing
Soviet missile buildup in Cuba.

437
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:49,652
That statement from
Department Press Officer Lincoln White,

438
00:24:49,754 --> 00:24:51,654
a revelation
that construction of missile sites

439
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:52,745
is continuing.

440
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:56,819
It's delicious.

441
00:24:56,928 --> 00:24:58,122
You're crazy.

442
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,925
Can I have a milk shake?

443
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:01,259
What's wrong with root beer?

444
00:25:01,366 --> 00:25:02,560
Daddy?

445
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:06,527
Lt'll take 45 minutes, you know.

446
00:25:06,638 --> 00:25:08,765
Daddy, knock-knock.

447
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:09,772
Who's there?

448
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:11,206
Dwayne.

449
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:12,435
Dwayne who?

450
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:16,002
Dwayne the bathtub.
Mama, I'm dwowning.

451
00:25:16,114 --> 00:25:18,480
Can we watch TV?

452
00:25:22,554 --> 00:25:24,988
Can you watch these for me, please?

453
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,141
What are you doing here?

454
00:25:57,022 --> 00:25:58,990
I'm waiting.

455
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:45,394
I'm married.

456
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:44,922
I was just about ready
to come by and pick you up.

457
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:48,329
I know, Wally, and I'm sick about it.

458
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:49,991
I could just die.

459
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:52,968
Yeah, well, before you go
and do something like that,

460
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:54,868
I got an idea.

461
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:57,271
What if I got Beaver to call your sister

462
00:27:57,375 --> 00:27:59,536
and see if he could
talk her into going?

463
00:27:59,644 --> 00:28:03,205
Say, maybe that would work.

464
00:28:06,551 --> 00:28:08,212
So what is your name?

465
00:28:12,924 --> 00:28:14,789
What are you doing in there?

466
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,993
We were just about to close.

467
00:28:24,102 --> 00:28:26,502
Anita wanted to come,
but she's with the children.

468
00:28:26,604 --> 00:28:28,367
That's where she should be.

469
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:30,168
My mother baked.

470
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:31,902
Thought we'd all
appreciate something fresh

471
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:33,477
if we get stuck in here.

472
00:28:33,578 --> 00:28:36,012
And how are you?

473
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:37,581
I don't know.

474
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,685
Nuclear war.

475
00:28:40,785 --> 00:28:42,514
We could be gone tomorrow.

476
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:46,215
Well, isn't that always the case?

477
00:28:46,324 --> 00:28:49,589
That's true.

478
00:28:49,694 --> 00:28:52,390
You believe in God.

479
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:54,727
I've seen that in you
from the moment we met.

480
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:02,005
Sometimes I feel

481
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:06,009
he called me to this parish
to reach you.

482
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:10,043
No. I didn't know that.

483
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:12,548
Well, it's true.

484
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:16,051
Hell is serious and very real,

485
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:17,815
and unless you unburden yourself,

486
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:19,082
you cannot know peace.

487
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:22,216
I understand that, Father,

488
00:29:22,327 --> 00:29:24,522
but you're upsetting me right now.

489
00:29:24,629 --> 00:29:27,120
That is your guilt, Peggy.

490
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:30,759
All that God wants is for you
to reconcile with him.

491
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:33,064
Don't you understand

492
00:29:33,171 --> 00:29:34,832
that this could be the end of the world

493
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:36,201
and you could go to hell?

494
00:29:37,742 --> 00:29:40,905
I can't believe that's the way God is.

495
00:29:44,482 --> 00:29:46,040
Good night, Father.

496
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:37,296
Really? The silver?

497
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:39,267
There could be looting.

498
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:40,496
A mob is going to come

499
00:30:40,605 --> 00:30:42,869
to the 14th floor
of this apartment building?

500
00:30:42,974 --> 00:30:45,807
I wish you would come with me right now.

501
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:47,468
What if something happens?

502
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:51,515
Rehoboth Beach
is 90 minutes from D.C.

503
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:53,481
You don't understand these bombs.

504
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:57,180
Your parents' deck chairs
will be on Fifth Avenue.

505
00:30:57,288 --> 00:30:59,620
Are you trying to make me more upset?

506
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:03,753
If for some reason
the train doesn't work,

507
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,454
just take a few hundred
dollars in cash

508
00:31:05,563 --> 00:31:07,326
and pay someone to drive you.

509
00:31:08,566 --> 00:31:09,692
This is ridiculous.

510
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:12,361
If I'm going to die,
I want to die in Manhattan.

511
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:14,665
Stop that kind of talk, Peter.

512
00:31:14,772 --> 00:31:15,932
There's no difference, Trudy.

513
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,064
And I want to be here,

514
00:31:17,175 --> 00:31:18,665
and you want to be with your parents.

515
00:31:18,776 --> 00:31:20,607
Why do you always
make it about that?

516
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:23,237
And yes, I love my parents,
and they love me.

517
00:31:23,348 --> 00:31:24,838
Do you?

518
00:31:24,949 --> 00:31:27,383
If you did, you'd want to be with me.

519
00:31:28,953 --> 00:31:30,443
You're right.

520
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:41,357
I'll help you pack the car.

521
00:31:43,468 --> 00:31:47,234
The first Russian ship
that proceeded through the area

522
00:31:47,338 --> 00:31:49,738
patrolled by our Navy forces...

523
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:51,570
Bad news.

524
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:52,836
What?

525
00:31:52,944 --> 00:31:54,912
The conference room's signed out all day.

526
00:31:55,013 --> 00:31:56,674
And I checked the fridge.

527
00:31:56,781 --> 00:31:58,715
There's canapés, really good ones.

528
00:31:58,816 --> 00:32:01,580
They shampooed
the carpets last night.

529
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:02,653
Campbell.

530
00:32:04,222 --> 00:32:06,213
PPL's coming in today.

531
00:32:06,324 --> 00:32:07,882
You told me she told you that.

532
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:09,619
You're not worried?
Why'd you come in?

533
00:32:09,727 --> 00:32:10,887
I don't know.

534
00:32:10,995 --> 00:32:12,929
I'm just waiting to see what happens.

535
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:14,828
I talked to my father-in-law about it.

536
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:17,026
Regime change is always tricky.

537
00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:18,864
You want to stay neutral.

538
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,961
The loyalists are always hung,

539
00:32:21,072 --> 00:32:23,040
and you don't want to get
caught in the fallout.

540
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:25,405
What's wrong with you?

541
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,341
Aren't you loyal to anyone?

542
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:29,310
They don't care about us.

543
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:31,279
We're just a bunch
of salaries on a ledger.

544
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:33,680
They'll draw a line
and get rid of everything below it.

545
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:36,549
I like this company the way it is.

546
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:48,356
Have a minute?

547
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:50,934
From the look of this,
that might be all I have.

548
00:32:51,035 --> 00:32:52,696
May I?

549
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:01,668
I'm coming to you anonymously, Don.

550
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:03,713
I know something
I think you should know.

551
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,283
What?

552
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:08,443
I know about the merger,

553
00:33:08,553 --> 00:33:12,887
and I know that Duck Phillips
is going to be the president.

554
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:15,391
How do you know that?

555
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:17,518
He told me.

556
00:33:17,628 --> 00:33:19,562
Why would he do that?

557
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,791
Picking sides, I guess.

558
00:33:23,701 --> 00:33:25,566
Why are you telling me this?

559
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:28,133
I don't know.

560
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:30,366
I just thought if I was you,

561
00:33:30,475 --> 00:33:32,409
I would want to know.

562
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:36,108
Thank you.

563
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:45,318
You know they stopped
a ship this morning.

564
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:50,618
I bet the Russians are reconsidering,
now that we made a stand.

565
00:34:07,945 --> 00:34:08,934
Carla, what's this?

566
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,446
That's from Mr. Draper.

567
00:34:20,858 --> 00:34:22,519
"Dear Betty,

568
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:24,026
"I'm sitting in the Roosevelt

569
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:25,891
"looking at the backs
of Bobby and Sally's heads

570
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:28,090
"as they watch TV.

571
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:30,167
"I'm not letting them
change the channel

572
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:31,826
"because watching
the news makes me sick,

573
00:34:31,936 --> 00:34:33,904
"and they can see it.

574
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:38,740
"I think about you
and how I behaved

575
00:34:38,843 --> 00:34:40,834
"and my regret.

576
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:43,743
"I know it's my fault
you are not here right now.

577
00:34:45,049 --> 00:34:46,209
"I understand why you feel

578
00:34:46,317 --> 00:34:47,944
"it's better to go on without me,

579
00:34:48,052 --> 00:34:51,749
"and I know that you won't
be alone for very long,

580
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:57,055
"but without you
I'll be alone forever.

581
00:34:57,161 --> 00:34:59,629
"I love you.

582
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:00,697
Don."

583
00:35:06,971 --> 00:35:10,099
Gentlemen, now that we've done
haggling over the dowry,

584
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:13,268
it's time to slip into the tent
and spend a night with the bride.

585
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:21,247
We imagine that Sterling Cooper
will remain somewhat autonomous.

586
00:35:21,352 --> 00:35:22,614
You bought us.

587
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,415
We don't expect autonomy,

588
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:30,017
but who's going to be minding the store
when you all fly back to England?

589
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,925
Since we've worked with him before

590
00:35:32,029 --> 00:35:33,929
and he knows both companies,

591
00:35:34,031 --> 00:35:37,194
Duck Phillips will be
President of Sterling Cooper.

592
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:39,462
My goodness.

593
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:41,595
Obviously, I accept.

594
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:44,741
That makes sense.

595
00:35:44,842 --> 00:35:46,742
Congratulations.

596
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:50,370
Well, I promise, in spite of this title,

597
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:52,676
I will treat the founders
of Sterling Cooper

598
00:35:52,783 --> 00:35:54,580
with the respect they deserve.

599
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:56,676
Duck, it has now become your meeting.

600
00:35:56,787 --> 00:35:58,721
Tell us what you see.

601
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,327
I find myself a little unprepared here,

602
00:36:03,427 --> 00:36:04,758
but I know this.

603
00:36:04,862 --> 00:36:07,592
I'd like to bring this company
into financial maturity.

604
00:36:07,698 --> 00:36:09,928
The last two years,
we've been held back.

605
00:36:10,034 --> 00:36:11,729
Good Creative is important,

606
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,804
but it can't be running the show.

607
00:36:13,905 --> 00:36:16,897
Our business is about
buying time and space,

608
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,771
and right now that means television.

609
00:36:18,876 --> 00:36:21,640
The bigger we are,
the cheaper we can get it.

610
00:36:21,746 --> 00:36:25,648
I don't think I heard
the word "client" once.

611
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,980
Well, Bert,
when the economy is good,

612
00:36:28,085 --> 00:36:29,279
people buy things,

613
00:36:29,387 --> 00:36:31,014
and when it's bad, they don't.

614
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:35,422
There's no reason for us to be tied
to Creative's fantasies of persuasion.

615
00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:41,621
It certainly is an ambitious way
of thinking about things.

616
00:36:44,468 --> 00:36:46,333
What?

617
00:36:46,437 --> 00:36:48,462
I think it sounds like a great agency,

618
00:36:48,573 --> 00:36:51,565
and I think Duck is the man to run it.

619
00:36:51,676 --> 00:36:54,474
I just don't think I'll be a part of it.

620
00:36:56,948 --> 00:36:58,609
You don't want to be a part of it?

621
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:01,184
If this is the agency you want,

622
00:37:01,285 --> 00:37:02,946
Duck is the man for the job.

623
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:05,682
This is what I'm talking about.

624
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:07,348
Artistic temperament.

625
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:09,619
Don, is this really necessary?

626
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:10,785
It is.

627
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:12,021
Because he loves this room

628
00:37:12,129 --> 00:37:13,824
and hearing his own voice
and saving the day.

629
00:37:13,931 --> 00:37:16,422
Except this time,
he's got to get with the team.

630
00:37:16,534 --> 00:37:18,832
Don, you can either honor your contract

631
00:37:18,936 --> 00:37:21,598
or walk out that door with nothing
and start selling insurance.

632
00:37:23,808 --> 00:37:25,833
I don't have a contract.

633
00:37:27,478 --> 00:37:28,843
We're close.

634
00:37:28,946 --> 00:37:30,675
We didn't think we needed one.

635
00:37:34,552 --> 00:37:35,519
Gentlemen.

636
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,554
I sell products, not advertising.

637
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:45,356
I can't see as far into the future as Duck,

638
00:37:45,463 --> 00:37:49,593
but if the world is still here on Monday,

639
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,031
we can talk.

640
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:55,936
Don, hold on.

641
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:01,737
Let him go.

642
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:03,370
It'll take a second to find some kid

643
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:05,676
who can write a prose poem
to a potato chip.

644
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:06,977
Calm down.

645
00:38:07,084 --> 00:38:08,312
Let him throw his tantrum.

646
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:09,886
The man disappeared
for three damn weeks,

647
00:38:09,987 --> 00:38:12,478
and I put this deal together.

648
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:14,251
What more do you need to know?

649
00:38:17,194 --> 00:38:20,186
Duck, would you
excuse us for a minute?

650
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:25,162
Of course.

651
00:38:36,113 --> 00:38:38,911
This doesn't affect the merger, does it?

652
00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:40,779
No.

653
00:38:40,885 --> 00:38:43,786
He never could hold his liquor.

654
00:38:45,756 --> 00:38:48,316
Mr. Draper, your wife called.

655
00:38:48,426 --> 00:38:49,825
She wants you to come home.

656
00:38:52,029 --> 00:38:53,724
You should go home as well.

657
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:55,594
I can't even think right now.

658
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:58,100
Greg says they put St. Luke's on alert.

659
00:39:09,714 --> 00:39:11,272
Your bag.

660
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:12,644
I don't need it.

661
00:39:13,951 --> 00:39:15,145
Good night.

662
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:16,480
...this correspondent

663
00:39:16,587 --> 00:39:18,111
that there is more
firepower now in Cuba

664
00:39:18,222 --> 00:39:20,122
than at any time during World War...

665
00:39:33,904 --> 00:39:35,098
Why are you smiling?

666
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,265
Because you're still here.

667
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,206
I was hoping
the train would be empty.

668
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:41,540
Have a drink with me.

669
00:39:41,645 --> 00:39:43,476
Okay.

670
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:56,952
Why are you still here?
Trudy must be worried.

671
00:39:58,262 --> 00:39:59,854
What is it with you?

672
00:39:59,964 --> 00:40:01,056
What?

673
00:40:02,466 --> 00:40:05,492
You never let me talk
about what I want to talk about.

674
00:40:07,037 --> 00:40:10,803
What do you want to talk about?

675
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:14,344
About what you said about the truth.

676
00:40:15,846 --> 00:40:17,404
Can I tell you the truth?

677
00:40:17,515 --> 00:40:19,710
Why wouldn't you?

678
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:22,047
You make it so hard.

679
00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:24,018
What are you talking about?

680
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:27,151
You.

681
00:40:31,195 --> 00:40:34,164
I've been thinking
about everything that's going on.

682
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,067
And I thought...

683
00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:40,501
who'd care if I was gone?

684
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:42,504
I mean, Trudy would care,

685
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:44,301
but she doesn't know me.

686
00:40:46,177 --> 00:40:47,735
But you do.

687
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,104
And I know you.

688
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:55,948
And I think you're perfect.

689
00:40:57,688 --> 00:41:00,213
I'm not perfect, Pete.

690
00:41:00,324 --> 00:41:02,383
Yes, you are.

691
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:06,627
And I wish I had picked you then.

692
00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:10,057
Pete.

693
00:41:14,572 --> 00:41:17,507
I love you.

694
00:41:17,608 --> 00:41:19,576
And I want to be with you.

695
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:26,077
What?

696
00:41:27,852 --> 00:41:29,410
Didn't you know that?

697
00:41:34,692 --> 00:41:36,922
Pete,

698
00:41:37,027 --> 00:41:42,431
I could have had you in my life forever
if I wanted to.

699
00:41:44,735 --> 00:41:46,168
What do you mean?

700
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:50,064
I could have had you.

701
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:53,405
I could have shamed you
into being with me.

702
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:57,670
But I didn't want to.

703
00:41:58,916 --> 00:42:02,079
I don't understand.

704
00:42:09,326 --> 00:42:11,351
You got me pregnant.

705
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:16,798
I had a baby,

706
00:42:16,901 --> 00:42:18,766
and I gave it away.

707
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:21,838
What?

708
00:42:24,074 --> 00:42:27,134
I had your baby,

709
00:42:27,244 --> 00:42:30,304
and I gave it away.

710
00:42:32,483 --> 00:42:34,178
Are you serious?

711
00:42:39,823 --> 00:42:42,189
You can't be serious.

712
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:46,491
I wanted other things.

713
00:42:46,597 --> 00:42:49,691
I don't understand.

714
00:42:54,371 --> 00:42:56,396
Well,

715
00:42:56,507 --> 00:43:00,409
one day you're there...

716
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:03,969
and then, all of a sudden...

717
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:07,107
there's less of you,

718
00:43:07,217 --> 00:43:09,845
and you wonder

719
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:13,617
where that part went,

720
00:43:13,724 --> 00:43:18,252
if it's living somewhere outside of you.

721
00:43:21,031 --> 00:43:24,831
And you keep thinking...

722
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:27,233
maybe you'll get it back.

723
00:43:31,408 --> 00:43:35,105
And then you realize...

724
00:43:35,212 --> 00:43:38,375
it's just gone.

725
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:43,812
Why would you tell me that?

726
00:43:47,758 --> 00:43:49,658
I'm sorry, Pete.

727
00:44:14,885 --> 00:44:16,250
- Daddy!
- Daddy!

728
00:44:16,353 --> 00:44:18,480
