1
00:00:51,684 --> 00:00:54,414
Mr. And Mrs. Campbell,

2
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:56,489
I'm Dr. Stone.

3
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,089
And how are we today?

4
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:01,217
We're so pleased to be here.

5
00:01:01,327 --> 00:01:02,692
My friend, Sara Driscoll,

6
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:05,356
her father is head of Obstetrics
at Lenox Hill.

7
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:07,092
She said you get results.

8
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,224
They got results.

9
00:01:08,334 --> 00:01:11,360
Sometimes all a young couple needs
is a good old-fashioned hand-holding.

10
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:14,338
Have a seat, Mr. Campbell.

11
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:19,902
Now, I am going to ask you
some questions together

12
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:22,811
and more intimate ones separately.

13
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:26,682
How long have you been
trying to conceive?

14
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:28,811
Eighteen months.

15
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,322
That sounds like a long time. Is it?

16
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,892
Let's not worry about what's normal.

17
00:01:33,993 --> 00:01:36,484
Everyone is different.

18
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:38,791
Are you two aware
of the principles of conception?

19
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:40,763
Of how the sperm meets the egg?

20
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:43,062
Yes.

21
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:45,899
Although if you'd like
to show us some films...

22
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:48,968
You'd be surprised.

23
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:52,602
Prior to the decision to conceive,
were you using birth control?

24
00:01:52,712 --> 00:01:54,976
- She was.
- I used a diaphragm.

25
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:57,242
Although it's possible I didn't need to.

26
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,113
Mrs. Campbell.

27
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:04,382
So we're walking in the park after lunch,

28
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:08,120
and he sees these birds
picking seeds out of some horse shit,

29
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:10,560
and he says, "Move over, fellows.
That's my job."

30
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,562
That sounds like a visit
from the stork or De Beers.

31
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:19,001
Or it could be just a new hairdo.

32
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:22,131
Mr. Rumsen, Mr. Draper.

33
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:23,766
How are you this morning?

34
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:25,242
Joan. Morning.

35
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,541
Well, there's your answer.

36
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:32,610
- Ever had mumps?
- Yes.

37
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:34,687
How old were you?

38
00:02:34,787 --> 00:02:36,982
Summer of '45...

39
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,421
11, 12.

40
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:40,755
Did your testicles descend normally?

41
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,420
Absolutely.

42
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,363
And have you ever fathered a child?

43
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:47,990
No.

44
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:50,763
Have you ever had difficulty
completing the sexual act?

45
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:55,898
Drinking doesn't help.

46
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:56,907
But no.

47
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,978
I always reach home base.

48
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:01,410
Do you have difficulties with arousal?

49
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,311
Jesus.

50
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:06,112
I'm a red-blooded American male, okay?

51
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:08,380
No one is questioning
your manhood, Mr. Campbell.

52
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:10,217
You could be a warrior,

53
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:12,883
an athlete, a bull of a man.

54
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:16,257
George Washington was sterile.

55
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,762
Fertility has nothing to do with manliness.

56
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:23,262
Do you want to have a child?

57
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:26,395
What kind of question is that?

58
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:28,565
Of course I do.

59
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:30,609
What man doesn't want a child?

60
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:37,813
Although you think
about the world right now.

61
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:40,112
The bomb...

62
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,814
Do you worry about the world?

63
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:44,719
Occasionally.

64
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:50,821
Do you work with X-rays,
radioactive material,

65
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,295
or toxic chemicals?

66
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,025
I'm in advertising.

67
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:58,331
We got a Xerox machine,
but I don't use it.

68
00:03:58,438 --> 00:03:59,462
Not personally.

69
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,233
Advertising?

70
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:02,467
Must be a lot of fun.

71
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,236
Are you kidding?

72
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:05,868
I'm an account man.

73
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:09,608
I spend half my day tiptoeing
around creative crybabies

74
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:11,877
and the other half drinking
with ungrateful turnips

75
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:14,112
who just fell off the truck.

76
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,780
I'm completely replaceable,

77
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:19,653
even though I just brought in
a huge account.

78
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:25,524
Then you throw this baby thing
on top of it,

79
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:28,931
the economy contracting, my in-laws...

80
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:30,866
Yes, it's a lot.

81
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,995
What about your parents?

82
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,074
My father just passed away.

83
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:38,575
I'm sorry to hear that.

84
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:40,839
Do you think that has
something to do with this?

85
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,414
It doesn't.

86
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:44,642
I mean...

87
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:46,981
I try not to think about it.

88
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:48,383
It's been a few months.

89
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:52,652
It is a difficult moment in the life cycle.

90
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:55,159
But we are part
of a continuum, aren't we?

91
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,857
So maybe I'm the end of the line.

92
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:06,227
Well, that'll do it, Mr. Campbell.

93
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,275
I think I feel better already.

94
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:10,899
Can you send in your wife?

95
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,069
And then I'd like you
to schedule a time with a nurse

96
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:14,703
for a semen analysis.

97
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:17,109
Whenever she's free.

98
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:24,049
Red and green are my colors,
so we're gonna do Christmas.

99
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,125
He doesn't know that yet.

100
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:28,022
I can cover Mr. Draper's desk for you.

101
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:29,321
I know you'll have your hands full.

102
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:30,487
You had your shot.

103
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:31,893
It's beautiful.

104
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,659
Miss Holloway,
those aren't wedding bells.

105
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:36,030
I'm so sorry, Mr. Draper.

106
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:38,103
Mr. Draper's office.

107
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:39,228
One moment, please.

108
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:46,009
Mr. Draper, Bobbie Barrett on line 1.

109
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:47,374
Thank you.

110
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:58,349
Don, I want you to ask me how I am.

111
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:01,086
How are you?

112
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,059
Where are you right now?

113
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:05,528
I'm in my office,

114
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:08,259
where you called me.

115
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,426
You sound a little tipsy.

116
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:10,729
We did it.

117
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:12,930
We sold Grin and Barrett.

118
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,473
Congratulations. You got an order?

119
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:18,373
No, but we're going to make a pilot.

120
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:20,241
I remember that because Jimmy said,

121
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:22,746
"Ask her. She's made
every pilot in town."

122
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:25,273
Come celebrate with me.

123
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:28,821
I'm at Sardi's, surrounded by clowns.

124
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:31,952
And why would I come?

125
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:35,858
I'm being ignored.
Come take up my time.

126
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,121
I'm working.

127
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,927
You provided key advice.

128
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:42,762
We can call it business.

129
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:45,997
No. Let's not confuse this.

130
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:48,437
I'm about to change my mind.

131
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:05,190
Thank you.

132
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,351
Was there even a party?

133
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:10,555
He'll have an old fashioned.

134
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:16,892
Buddy Hackett told Jimmy

135
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:18,470
that Gleason didn't have to make a pilot,

136
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:20,801
so Jimmy went home to sulk,

137
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:23,341
and the rest went out
to celebrate that they ruined his day.

138
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,967
So here we are.

139
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:28,779
I expect him to get this way
when it's bad,

140
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:31,509
but when it's good?

141
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:32,982
Maybe he doesn't understand
how big this is.

142
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:34,211
No, he does.

143
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,517
It's the big opportunity
he's bound to ruin.

144
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:50,869
Mr. Draper.

145
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,164
Miss Menken.

146
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:55,331
Actually, it's Mrs. Katz.

147
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:57,602
- This is my husband Tilden.
- Pleasure.

148
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:02,011
Mr. Draper's firm did some work
for us a while back.

149
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:03,206
Advertising.

150
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:09,586
I'm Bobbie Barrett.

151
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:10,951
I'm sorry.

152
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:14,493
Mrs. Barrett's husband
is a comedian who works with me.

153
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:16,323
Nice to meet you.

154
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:18,090
Tilden. I love comedians.

155
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,831
So, how are things at Grey?

156
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:23,595
Are they still taking credit
for everything we did?

157
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:25,728
He's all business, isn't he?

158
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,873
Now, Rach, we don't
want to miss the curtain.

159
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:31,341
We have seats for
A Funny Thing Happened.

160
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:33,139
Oh, it's wonderful.

161
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:36,477
Well, you two enjoy working together.

162
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:37,947
Nice to meet you.

163
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:51,552
So, I would like some really good chow.

164
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:53,222
Shall we go elsewhere?

165
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:55,129
We can.

166
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:57,964
Does feel a little cloudy in here right now.

167
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:00,595
No, it's fine.

168
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,202
So, tell me what I want.

169
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:07,942
Steak tartare.

170
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,982
Oh, my God, you're good.

171
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:14,348
Hearts of palm salad. Steak tartare.

172
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:16,785
I always order for Jimmy.

173
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,789
Watch the money.

174
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,883
Otherwise he ends up
sporting for people we don't know.

175
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:25,293
He doesn't realize that being a big shot
means you don't have to pay.

176
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,269
I think you're wrong about that.

177
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:32,860
In the end, we're
in different businesses, okay?

178
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:37,541
To a nice price on the pilot.

179
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:44,608
And I boxed them in for 39
on the air if they order.

180
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:46,685
You should have seen my neckline.

181
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:49,152
You really do his business, don't you?

182
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:52,690
If it wasn't for me,
it wouldn't be Grin and Barrett.

183
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:54,157
It'd be Grin and Brownstein.

184
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:57,127
This is America.

185
00:09:57,229 --> 00:10:00,392
Pick a job and then become
the person that does it.

186
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:04,430
Well, that's true.

187
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:06,767
Right after I met Jimmy,

188
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:10,035
I watched somebody's Uncle Morty

189
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:11,575
close a deal for him,

190
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:14,510
and I realized
I negotiate for everything...

191
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,276
the rent, the plumber, my hairdresser.

192
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:20,546
I even did it in a department store once.

193
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:23,213
It's touchy because
you're really telling somebody

194
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:25,017
they're not worth what they think.

195
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,989
But you can't hurt their feelings.

196
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:29,721
Negotiating is a bore.

197
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:31,888
It's hand-to-hand combat.

198
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:35,931
You don't like negotiating.

199
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:37,832
What the hell do you like?

200
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:39,700
What do you mean?

201
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,432
Doesn't have to be in business.

202
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,529
I'll take anything.

203
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,070
You can't even answer.

204
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:51,809
The answer is huge.

205
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,180
I don't think so.

206
00:10:56,722 --> 00:10:58,485
Do you like the ocean?

207
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,354
Yes.

208
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,552
Yes, I do.

209
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:08,100
I have a little place in Stony Brook,
right on the shore.

210
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:18,407
I want to have you on the beach.

211
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:24,541
Feel the cold sand on my back
with the surf pounding behind us.

212
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:38,188
I can smell the ocean.

213
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:45,468
I love bridges.

214
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:48,237
I don't know if it's the drop

215
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,365
or just because
you get to see something

216
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:53,309
disappearing behind you.

217
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:54,709
Do you like bridges?

218
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:57,280
I do.

219
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:02,048
That's two things you like.

220
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:04,145
What else?

221
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:07,819
Movies.

222
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:11,421
Yes. Spartacus?

223
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,631
You seen the foreign ones?

224
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,329
So sexy.

225
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:22,029
Yes.

226
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:26,802
Why is it so hard to just enjoy things?

227
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:33,710
God, I feel so good.

228
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:41,285
I don't feel a thing.

229
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:26,565
You all right?

230
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:28,196
Yeah.

231
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:30,172
I think so.

232
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:35,437
Are you okay in there?

233
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:54,531
Mr. Draper, your wife says
that the whiskey was hers.

234
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:57,534
But you did fail the sobriety test.

235
00:13:57,636 --> 00:13:59,604
You're at the legal limit...

236
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:02,139
. 15 percent.

237
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:05,142
The fine's $150.

238
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:08,574
May I?

239
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:29,558
I have $63 and some subway tokens.

240
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:31,135
I'll mail you the rest.

241
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:34,331
I need you to pay the fine tonight.

242
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,101
Or I can put you up.

243
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,242
Let me call a cab,
and I'll send an employee

244
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:42,576
out here with the $500
tomorrow morning.

245
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:45,172
I bet you would, too.

246
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:48,845
No, it's just 150.

247
00:14:48,954 --> 00:14:50,751
It's within my rights to detain you.

248
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:52,448
What is the problem?

249
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:56,358
People's kids are out on that road, sir.

250
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:58,259
Call somebody.

251
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,562
Or maybe your wife has a friend.

252
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:45,673
I have $110.

253
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,747
It's all I could get short notice.

254
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:09,799
If you're going to be sick,
please tell me.

255
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,836
This is my brother-in-law's car.

256
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,632
I put $2.00 worth of gas in it.

257
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:18,437
I don't want to have to clean it, too.

258
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:25,611
Mr. Draper, I think
you should keep her awake.

259
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:27,310
Bobbie, stay up!

260
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:37,027
What?

261
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:39,529
What do you think?

262
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:41,658
Are you feeling okay?

263
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:43,632
You can drop me off at Grand Central.

264
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:44,760
Bobbie, what do you want to do?

265
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:47,703
Jimmy can't see me this way.

266
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:49,433
I should check in somewhere,

267
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:50,565
see how the shiner does.

268
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:54,970
Peggy, do you have a roommate?

269
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,047
No.

270
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:57,240
I don't know.

271
00:16:57,349 --> 00:17:00,113
No, you should stay with me.

272
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:02,278
Just for the night, if you want.

273
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:06,154
Mr. Draper, you need to rent a car.

274
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:08,818
I can take you to LaGuardia.

275
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:10,155
Idlewild is better.

276
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:11,889
The Cross Island or the Belt Parkway.

277
00:17:11,997 --> 00:17:14,693
It's faster to take the Grand Central
to LaGuardia.

278
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:21,336
I don't have any clothes.

279
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,135
I wish I was your size.

280
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:25,540
Do you have any dry cleaning?

281
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:26,906
I'll pick it up.

282
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:28,570
In the city.

283
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,080
I'll go in and get it first thing.

284
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:32,650
Okay?

285
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,719
Hello.

286
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:39,450
Leave her alone.

287
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:47,056
No one in the office can know about this.

288
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,224
It's business.

289
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,206
You'll have to believe me
that I'll forget this.

290
00:17:57,042 --> 00:18:00,569
I don't want you treating me badly
because I remind you of it.

291
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:04,647
This can be fixed.

292
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:46,089
Where the hell were you?

293
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:47,715
I was in an accident.

294
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:53,060
What? Are you okay?

295
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:54,359
What happened?

296
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:57,924
By the time I could call,
I didn't want to wake you.

297
00:18:58,036 --> 00:18:59,469
Wake...

298
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:00,469
Wake me?

299
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:01,971
I've been awake all night.

300
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:04,673
I knew something was wrong.

301
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:06,334
I could feel it.

302
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:11,382
I went to the doctor a while ago,
and I have high blood pressure.

303
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,747
What the hell, Don?

304
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:15,820
It's fine, except...

305
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:16,979
he gave me a prescription,

306
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:21,890
and I think the pills
mixed with the drinks was too much.

307
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,962
I lost control of the car.

308
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:28,021
Jesus. How could you
not tell me about this?

309
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:29,760
I didn't want to worry you.

310
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:33,495
I've been up all night.

311
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:37,598
And now I find out you're sick
and you could have died?

312
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:40,200
What did you want me to do?

313
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:41,574
Have you come down there?

314
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,580
Ask Francine in the middle of the night
to watch the kids

315
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:44,910
because your husband's
in the drunk tank?

316
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:48,453
Who cares if I couldn't help you?

317
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:50,784
You should call me.

318
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:52,049
I'm your wife.

319
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:53,249
I was solving a problem, Bets.

320
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,724
I need a clear head.

321
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:57,818
You can't get all hysterical.

322
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,765
I didn't know you were waiting up.

323
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:08,670
You promised you wouldn't
disappear like that anymore.

324
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:16,704
I have to get changed and go in.

325
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:18,476
You're going to the office?

326
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:22,384
I don't want anyone to know about this.

327
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:23,954
I rented a car. I'll have to get my car.

328
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:27,753
I don't care about the car, Don.

329
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:29,656
My father has high blood pressure.

330
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,263
I'll swing by Dr. McLattery on the way in.

331
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,602
Just help me get dressed, okay?

332
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:53,781
You can fend without me.

333
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:58,584
I'm at a fat farm.

334
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:00,817
One of your friends
made a crack about my ass.

335
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,417
It doesn't matter who.

336
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:12,495
Well, we're gonna be
all over the television,

337
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:14,299
and the camera adds 10 pounds.

338
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:19,302
No. You look fine.

339
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:22,006
Jimmy, stop.

340
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,081
You and I both know

341
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:25,012
you should have behaved
yourself last night.

342
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:28,508
I will.

343
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:35,721
I couldn't find an ashtray.

344
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:40,220
What's all this?

345
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:41,560
I thought you might be hungry.

346
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:44,067
It'll ruin my alibi.

347
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:45,636
I need cottage cheese and champagne.

348
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,637
I'm joking.

349
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:51,899
Do you mind if I lay down
for a few minutes?

350
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,671
I'm not used to being up all night.

351
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:55,371
Of course, dear.

352
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,880
And I got this to keep me company.

353
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,245
I'll make up the couch for you.

354
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:00,545
You must be beat, too.

355
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:01,676
I'll make it.

356
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:03,652
- Where are the linens?
- Just a minute.

357
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:11,452
Oh, Marilyn.

358
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:14,088
The tragedy you live.

359
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:16,030
I'm sure glad I don't have problems.

360
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:20,903
I think most women
would love to have her problems.

361
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,304
Somebody said she's gonna
be at the fundraiser

362
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:25,774
at the Garden on Saturday night.

363
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:28,607
You know, the president's birthday?

364
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:30,773
I really don't want to miss it.

365
00:22:30,882 --> 00:22:32,406
Do you have a headache?

366
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:34,985
Because we had a little boy
in our neighborhood

367
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:36,918
who fell off a swing set and hit his head

368
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,319
and went to sleep.

369
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:39,822
And then he died.

370
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,294
Well, it's certainly
good to have company.

371
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:45,727
I'm sorry. I shouldn't talk that way.

372
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:51,700
I keep forgetting the accident.

373
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:53,668
It was terrible.

374
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:57,166
And it keeps getting stranger.

375
00:22:57,275 --> 00:23:00,039
If you're lucky, it will disappear.

376
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:02,613
I have to lie down.

377
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,181
Are you his secretary?

378
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,218
No, but we work together.

379
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,750
We'll both be handling
Mr. Draper for the time being.

380
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:12,983
Now, you're a college girl,

381
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:15,457
so I'm going to expect you
to jump in with haste.

382
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,120
I have a lot of arrangements
to make for my wedding.

383
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,562
Oh, my goodness. Congratulations.

384
00:23:20,665 --> 00:23:22,030
He's a doctor. He doesn't work here,

385
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:24,068
so don't worry about putting
your foot in your mouth.

386
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:25,636
Lucky you.

387
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:27,671
Let me see?

388
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:29,968
It's so lively.

389
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:33,238
You'd like to think it doesn't matter.

390
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:38,040
I've been offered a few,
and this is by far the best.

391
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,085
I'm a little bit clairvoyant,

392
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:46,384
and I think you two are going
to be very happy together.

393
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:55,566
I feel like I'm walking in tall cotton.

394
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:59,660
Aren't you darling?
You're gonna be gangbusters.

395
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:03,263
Mr. Draper is impatient.
Do not let it intimidate you.

396
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:07,675
If it isn't the welcome wagon.

397
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,474
Hello there.

398
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:11,378
I'm Ken Cosgrove, Accounts.

399
00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:13,417
Paul Kinsey, copywriter.

400
00:24:13,518 --> 00:24:15,509
Harry Crane, married.

401
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,588
Jane Siegel.

402
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:19,680
Anything I can help
you gentlemen with?

403
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:23,192
I actually need to see Mr. Draper.

404
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,195
Is he in?

405
00:24:26,565 --> 00:24:28,430
- Morning, Don.
- Morning.

406
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:30,899
Mr. Draper.

407
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:33,436
I'd like you to meet Jane, the new girl.

408
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:34,527
Morning.

409
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:38,404
Can I talk to you for a minute?

410
00:24:41,112 --> 00:24:43,012
I'm gonna help you hold onto this one.

411
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:46,948
I'm not paying attention anymore
until they're here a month.

412
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:49,350
What happened to your wing?

413
00:24:49,454 --> 00:24:51,285
I missed the bottom step.

414
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:55,426
It's an old house.

415
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:57,586
I got an urgent call from Jimmy Barrett.

416
00:24:57,696 --> 00:24:59,323
He wants to come in.

417
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:00,420
Why?

418
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:01,658
He wouldn't say.

419
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:04,394
Was he upset about something?

420
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:05,936
Who can tell?

421
00:25:10,876 --> 00:25:12,309
I want you to put him off a few days,

422
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:14,002
let him cool.

423
00:25:14,112 --> 00:25:15,101
He'll make more sense.

424
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:17,340
Good idea.
He probably wants a rubdown.

425
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:19,144
Paper says they ordered his pilot.

426
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:20,809
Friday.

427
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:24,378
Should I talk to your girl?

428
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:25,547
I'll handle it.

429
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:27,887
You bet.

430
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:29,790
Get the door.

431
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:43,899
Hello?

432
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:45,340
Is everything okay?

433
00:25:45,443 --> 00:25:47,274
Yes, I think so.

434
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,277
Is she awake?

435
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,847
She's fine.

436
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:53,279
Put her on.

437
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:55,182
Just a minute.

438
00:26:03,828 --> 00:26:04,988
I didn't think you'd call.

439
00:26:05,096 --> 00:26:06,256
Why not?

440
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:07,729
I don't know. I just...

441
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:09,756
How are you?

442
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:12,063
I don't know.

443
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:14,138
Jimmy called.
He wants to meet with me.

444
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,104
He does?

445
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:18,641
I called him, and everything went fine.

446
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,301
So you don't know
anything about this?

447
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,346
You think I'd be in Brooklyn
if I didn't have to be?

448
00:26:22,447 --> 00:26:24,972
I talked to him.
I'm covered. Believe me.

449
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,574
I do.

450
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:28,948
Are you okay?

451
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:31,818
I guess.

452
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:33,151
You?

453
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:36,289
It's going to be better.

454
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:38,760
Good.

455
00:26:38,863 --> 00:26:40,194
Take care.

456
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:52,976
Do you want to play cards or something?

457
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:54,010
I think I have some.

458
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:55,340
No.

459
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:06,054
I'm sorry, but it's killing me.

460
00:27:07,993 --> 00:27:09,756
Why are you doing this?

461
00:27:09,861 --> 00:27:11,328
I don't know.

462
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:12,657
He's my boss.

463
00:27:12,764 --> 00:27:14,629
Quite an example he's setting.

464
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:19,397
Are you seeing him?

465
00:27:20,538 --> 00:27:21,596
No.

466
00:27:23,074 --> 00:27:24,041
So what, then?

467
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:26,702
He's done a lot for me.

468
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,403
He made me a copywriter.

469
00:27:28,513 --> 00:27:31,107
I bet you made yourself a copywriter.

470
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:32,308
All these books.

471
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:36,849
He's a decent man, isn't he?

472
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:38,718
You wouldn't think he would be.

473
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:42,054
I never expect him to be
any other way than what he is.

474
00:27:54,639 --> 00:27:56,573
We'll keep her here for another few weeks.

475
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:59,542
She's still not in any condition
to make decisions for herself.

476
00:27:59,644 --> 00:28:01,111
She should be at home.

477
00:28:01,212 --> 00:28:03,703
Listen to the doctor, Mama.

478
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:06,306
In this kind
of psychoneurotic disorder...

479
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:08,943
Hello, Ma.

480
00:28:09,054 --> 00:28:10,180
Hello, dear.

481
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:15,288
I'm afraid you'll have to leave us alone.

482
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:20,060
I'm going, but I'm not leaving, Peaches.

483
00:28:31,342 --> 00:28:33,139
Hello, Peggy.

484
00:28:33,244 --> 00:28:35,235
How are you today?

485
00:28:35,346 --> 00:28:38,440
I still feel so tired.

486
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,017
Do you know what year it is?

487
00:28:42,353 --> 00:28:43,786
It's 1960.

488
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:46,618
Do you know who the president is?

489
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:49,523
Dwight D. Eisenhower.

490
00:28:49,627 --> 00:28:53,324
Good. Do you know
where you are, Peggy?

491
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:56,963
St. Mary's.

492
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,899
Do you know why you're here?

493
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:03,197
No.

494
00:29:03,308 --> 00:29:05,299
You know St. Mary's is a hospital?

495
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,877
Yes.

496
00:29:06,978 --> 00:29:09,503
Why do you think you're here?

497
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:14,251
I don't know.

498
00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:19,854
I don't feel like myself.

499
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:22,426
That's because we have you
on medication.

500
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:25,690
We want you to be relaxed
so you feel more like talking.

501
00:29:30,735 --> 00:29:33,533
I told you what happened.

502
00:29:33,638 --> 00:29:35,230
You had a baby.

503
00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:29,683
You know, you can hear that outside.

504
00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:31,785
Nobody knows what I'm doing.

505
00:30:31,896 --> 00:30:33,989
It's good for mystique.

506
00:30:37,101 --> 00:30:39,501
So, Joanie, I hear
congratulations are in order.

507
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:41,333
Yes.

508
00:30:41,439 --> 00:30:44,237
Marriage. Don't know why you'd want
to join that club, baby.

509
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:46,572
Hasn't stopped you
from having a good time.

510
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:48,236
How old is this guy?

511
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:49,973
He's 34.

512
00:30:50,081 --> 00:30:52,242
What's wrong with him?

513
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,874
Nothing.

514
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:57,819
Well, I think it's nice to hear the story
of relatively young love.

515
00:30:57,922 --> 00:31:00,652
Are you being a concerned daddy?

516
00:31:02,227 --> 00:31:04,752
I'll tell you the same thing
I told my daughter.

517
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:07,127
If you put a penny in a jar

518
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:10,030
every time you make love
in the first year of marriage,

519
00:31:10,134 --> 00:31:11,863
and then you take
a penny out of the jar

520
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:13,562
every time you make love
in the second year,

521
00:31:13,671 --> 00:31:14,797
you know what you have?

522
00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:16,464
A jar full of pennies.

523
00:31:16,574 --> 00:31:19,338
I envy that girl having you
to give her away.

524
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:25,472
I've always been faithful
to whomever I was with.

525
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:28,051
And despite your jokes,

526
00:31:28,152 --> 00:31:30,177
I always assumed you
were unhappy with Mona,

527
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:31,755
not the whole idea.

528
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:35,052
You aren't just another woman, Joanie.

529
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:38,219
Well, it doesn't matter now, does it?

530
00:31:38,329 --> 00:31:40,354
I fell in love.

531
00:31:42,533 --> 00:31:44,364
Makes me sad.

532
00:31:44,469 --> 00:31:46,733
Just another reason
not to come in to work.

533
00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:48,396
I'm not going anywhere.

534
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:50,167
Yes, you are.

535
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:52,175
You'll see.

536
00:31:54,178 --> 00:31:56,237
Can I give you a couple paddles
for good luck?

537
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:13,621
Coffee.

538
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:17,892
Thanks for buying milk.

539
00:32:18,002 --> 00:32:20,027
I live alone. It always goes bad.

540
00:32:20,138 --> 00:32:22,971
So this really must be a kick in the head.

541
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:26,240
Company is nice.

542
00:32:26,344 --> 00:32:27,572
Your eye's improved.

543
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,647
That's good.

544
00:32:29,747 --> 00:32:32,341
I can cover the purple
with some green eye shadow.

545
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,281
Complementary colors. We use that.

546
00:32:34,385 --> 00:32:35,943
Old trick.

547
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:37,146
I was a dancer.

548
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:40,383
I met a lot of interesting people.

549
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:44,287
You have a boyfriend?

550
00:32:44,395 --> 00:32:45,885
No, I don't.

551
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:50,567
So, are you in love with him?

552
00:32:50,668 --> 00:32:52,226
No.

553
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:55,636
It's not a ridiculous question.

554
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,207
Are you?

555
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:59,333
It's a personal question,

556
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:01,241
and I've already answered you.

557
00:33:03,181 --> 00:33:04,512
You're right.

558
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:13,449
Aren't you going to ask me
if I'm in love with him?

559
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:15,423
It's none of my business.

560
00:33:16,694 --> 00:33:18,685
You're right again.

561
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:23,429
You're so young and beautiful.

562
00:33:23,534 --> 00:33:25,661
I'm not your competition.

563
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:28,931
That's sweet.

564
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:31,999
Is there anything else I can get you?

565
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:34,601
No.

566
00:33:34,712 --> 00:33:36,179
I love your place.

567
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:39,982
I've been trying to fix it up.

568
00:33:40,084 --> 00:33:43,485
Well, I like it. It takes me back.

569
00:33:58,503 --> 00:34:01,666
Unless one of you needs help
finding a dead client file,

570
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:03,798
I suggest you pitch
your tents elsewhere.

571
00:34:09,747 --> 00:34:11,180
I see what you're doing,

572
00:34:11,282 --> 00:34:12,806
and I have to say I'm disappointed.

573
00:34:12,917 --> 00:34:14,544
I don't follow.

574
00:34:14,652 --> 00:34:16,950
Your décolletage is distracting.

575
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:19,819
This is an office that hinges
on professional decorum.

576
00:34:19,924 --> 00:34:22,825
I'm so sorry, Joan.

577
00:34:22,927 --> 00:34:24,656
I didn't realize.

578
00:34:24,762 --> 00:34:25,694
Better?

579
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:27,594
Go out and get a sweater at lunch.

580
00:34:27,698 --> 00:34:30,098
Be reasonable.

581
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:33,659
There's still plenty to see,
and you know that.

582
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:41,368
Jane.

583
00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:46,781
I have some very important talent
coming in tomorrow to see Don,

584
00:34:46,884 --> 00:34:48,511
somebody famous,

585
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:51,986
and I just want to make sure
you're aware of that.

586
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,524
What's your title here?

587
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:55,592
Title?

588
00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:58,686
I'm Ken.

589
00:34:59,964 --> 00:35:01,295
Cosgrove.

590
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,726
Accounts.

591
00:35:03,835 --> 00:35:06,395
Yes, you're here in the book
with Jimmy Barrett.

592
00:35:06,504 --> 00:35:08,404
Would you like to go see him sometime?

593
00:35:10,174 --> 00:35:12,142
Hey. Listen to this.

594
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:26,946
It's Mozart.

595
00:35:44,842 --> 00:35:47,072
You can use the mirror in the bedroom.

596
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:49,237
No.

597
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:53,044
Part of the process of learning
to live without your hospitality.

598
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:54,584
It's nothing.

599
00:35:57,121 --> 00:35:58,816
Not true.

600
00:36:07,965 --> 00:36:12,402
I was curious if you're aware
of the value of your service.

601
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:14,562
It's what you're supposed to do, isn't it?

602
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:16,770
I wouldn't say that.

603
00:36:16,874 --> 00:36:19,274
People will take advantage of you.

604
00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:20,844
I know what I'm doing.

605
00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:25,882
What do you want?

606
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:31,079
Are you just some busy little bee
building a hive out in Brooklyn?

607
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:33,714
Are you still trying to say thank you?

608
00:36:35,793 --> 00:36:38,557
You have to start living the life
of the person you want to be.

609
00:36:38,663 --> 00:36:41,291
Is that what you did?

610
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:49,302
You're never going to get that corner office

611
00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:52,205
until you start
treating Don as an equal.

612
00:36:53,644 --> 00:36:55,134
And no one will tell you this,

613
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:56,838
but you can't be a man.

614
00:36:56,948 --> 00:36:59,576
Don't even try.

615
00:36:59,684 --> 00:37:01,811
Be a woman.

616
00:37:03,421 --> 00:37:06,356
It's a powerful business
when done correctly.

617
00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:14,187
Do you understand
what I'm saying, dear?

618
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:18,294
I think so.

619
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:26,032
How do I get to Grand Central from here,
steam ship?

620
00:37:26,143 --> 00:37:27,735
I can walk you to the train.

621
00:37:27,845 --> 00:37:28,834
It's two blocks over.

622
00:37:28,946 --> 00:37:30,038
I'll call a car.

623
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,353
Hello?

624
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,086
How was your day?

625
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:45,560
Spectacular.

626
00:37:45,663 --> 00:37:48,723
Duck called Bert Peterson a mongoloid.

627
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:50,528
What a leader of men.

628
00:37:50,635 --> 00:37:52,068
Dr. Stone's office rang.

629
00:37:52,169 --> 00:37:54,399
How is Dr. Stone?

630
00:37:54,505 --> 00:38:00,034
I didn't ask, but the nurse said
that your sample was quite viable.

631
00:38:00,144 --> 00:38:02,078
Is that right?

632
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:05,376
Well. What do you know?

633
00:38:07,818 --> 00:38:11,686
That is a relief, I do say.

634
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:12,881
Yes.

635
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:17,591
Able to leap tall buildings
in a single bound, are they?

636
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:19,763
I suppose.

637
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:24,835
To viability.

638
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:28,696
What? This is good.

639
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:31,036
It is.

640
00:38:32,877 --> 00:38:34,435
This is what you wanted, isn't it?

641
00:38:34,545 --> 00:38:36,979
No, you're right. It's a relief.

642
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:38,241
Now we know it's me.

643
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:39,543
Right.

644
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:43,245
So Stone can blow up your ovaries
or do whatever his cutting-edge plan is.

645
00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:46,346
Peter, I can't believe you.

646
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:49,358
Wait a minute. You wanted to do this.

647
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,485
You had to know this
was a possible outcome.

648
00:38:52,563 --> 00:38:53,894
Get back here!

649
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,192
Trudy!

650
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:01,699
Sit down.

651
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:06,138
I'm sorry.

652
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:09,536
I didn't think it through.

653
00:39:10,581 --> 00:39:11,980
That's honest.

654
00:39:13,217 --> 00:39:14,809
I don't know what I thought.

655
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:18,148
Who says we have to do this?

656
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:19,347
Except for what,

657
00:39:19,457 --> 00:39:21,448
it's the next thing we're supposed to do?

658
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:23,459
But it is. It's natural.

659
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:24,858
Says who?

660
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:29,895
I was having a great time.

661
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,399
Weren't you?

662
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:34,733
Maybe this is the way
it's supposed to be.

663
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:37,672
I mean, you have a baby.

664
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:39,003
You can't travel.

665
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:41,601
You can't go to the movies
unless you have help,

666
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,077
and that's expensive.

667
00:39:44,482 --> 00:39:46,347
You're immature, Peter, you know that?

668
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:48,782
I just did a very private thing

669
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:50,820
in a very public place for you.

670
00:39:50,921 --> 00:39:54,789
And guess what.
You don't like the results.

671
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:56,450
What do you want me to do?

672
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,290
Express some concern.

673
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,262
And stop talking about
how you're going to miss

674
00:40:01,365 --> 00:40:03,731
seeing Cape Fear for the third time.

675
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:04,892
I know one thing.

676
00:40:05,002 --> 00:40:08,460
I sure as hell wouldn't want a kid here
watching this donnybrook.

677
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:10,733
Either you make it through this thing,

678
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:12,638
or you just keep it to yourself.

679
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:13,937
I'm giving you that option.

680
00:40:14,044 --> 00:40:15,341
Stop!

681
00:40:18,549 --> 00:40:21,074
I'm sorry.

682
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:22,618
I'm just...

683
00:40:25,189 --> 00:40:30,354
It's just I really do want a baby.

684
00:40:35,499 --> 00:40:37,967
What is all this for?

685
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,665
I don't know.

686
00:40:49,847 --> 00:40:51,906
Can we eat now?

687
00:40:53,984 --> 00:40:55,747
Not here.

688
00:40:55,853 --> 00:40:57,013
Get your coat.

689
00:41:33,557 --> 00:41:35,320
Is that you?

690
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:38,718
Are you really there?

691
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:41,127
Yes, I am.

692
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,392
What are you doing here?

693
00:41:46,303 --> 00:41:49,101
You got a promotion and disappeared.

694
00:41:50,241 --> 00:41:52,937
Your Christmas present
is sitting on your desk.

695
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,205
I called your house,

696
00:41:55,312 --> 00:41:57,940
and your roommate gave me
your mother's number.

697
00:41:58,048 --> 00:41:59,948
Oh, God.

698
00:42:03,487 --> 00:42:06,650
Your mother told me you were quarantined.

699
00:42:06,757 --> 00:42:08,315
TB.

700
00:42:08,425 --> 00:42:12,191
I guess that was supposed
to lessen my concern.

701
00:42:15,232 --> 00:42:16,597
I'm sorry.

702
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,429
What's wrong with you?

703
00:42:20,104 --> 00:42:21,594
I don't know.

704
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:24,606
What do they want you to do?

705
00:42:27,278 --> 00:42:29,542
I don't know.

706
00:42:29,647 --> 00:42:31,274
Yes, you do.

707
00:42:34,018 --> 00:42:35,508
Do it.

708
00:42:36,687 --> 00:42:39,349
Do whatever they say.

709
00:42:44,328 --> 00:42:46,125
Peggy, listen to me.

710
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:52,225
Get out of here and move forward.

711
00:42:54,305 --> 00:42:56,500
This never happened.

712
00:42:59,143 --> 00:43:03,239
It will shock you
how much it never happened.

713
00:43:14,024 --> 00:43:16,424
It's old work, and we're
meeting early next week.

714
00:43:16,527 --> 00:43:18,051
The artwork is new.

715
00:43:18,162 --> 00:43:20,824
I'm going to see my
father-in-law this weekend,

716
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:23,126
and he's going to ask me.

717
00:43:24,835 --> 00:43:27,303
Mr. Draper, Jimmy Barrett
is going to be early.

718
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,003
I'm sorry I'm late.

719
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:35,169
Don was asking where
we're going with this.

720
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:37,713
I need more time. I was sick.

721
00:43:37,815 --> 00:43:40,283
I did my work.

722
00:43:41,852 --> 00:43:43,444
Should we bring someone else in?

723
00:43:43,554 --> 00:43:44,987
Throw it at Kurt and Smitty?

724
00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:47,649
I don't know. Miss Olson,
do you need some help?

725
00:43:47,758 --> 00:43:49,248
No. I'll have it first thing Monday.

726
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,590
Yes, you will.

727
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:05,934
Yes?

728
00:44:06,043 --> 00:44:08,443
Mr. Draper, I'm sorry I was unprepared.

729
00:44:08,545 --> 00:44:10,274
Don't let it happen again.

730
00:44:11,715 --> 00:44:13,945
Well, it's... it's just that...

731
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:16,743
What?

732
00:44:17,921 --> 00:44:21,049
$110 is a lot of money for me.

733
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:22,284
Your bail.

734
00:44:26,764 --> 00:44:27,753
Right.

735
00:44:34,471 --> 00:44:35,961
Here.

736
00:44:36,073 --> 00:44:38,405
I'll give you 50 tomorrow.

737
00:44:40,444 --> 00:44:42,412
I guess when you try
to forget something,

738
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:44,242
you have to forget everything.

739
00:44:46,617 --> 00:44:48,141
Thank you, Don.

740
00:44:59,096 --> 00:45:01,496
Wow, Draper.

741
00:45:01,598 --> 00:45:03,361
Some kind of tomato farm you got here.

742
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:04,764
Window dressing's important.

743
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:06,392
Can I get you anything?

744
00:45:06,503 --> 00:45:08,835
I was going to ask you the same thing.

745
00:45:11,508 --> 00:45:13,635
Blondie, wait outside.

746
00:45:18,949 --> 00:45:22,578
Jimmy, Mrs. Barrett, you look good.

747
00:45:22,686 --> 00:45:24,517
You don't. What happened
to the flipper there?

748
00:45:24,621 --> 00:45:26,088
Old football injury.

749
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:28,420
Yeah. I get those, too.

750
00:45:28,525 --> 00:45:30,584
Have a seat.

751
00:45:30,694 --> 00:45:33,185
No need. I'll keep this short.

752
00:45:34,932 --> 00:45:36,900
I just want to thank you
for convincing the folks at Utz

753
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,661
to let me do the show.

754
00:45:40,504 --> 00:45:42,199
- My pleasure.
- Yeah.

755
00:45:42,306 --> 00:45:44,501
We all got what we wanted, didn't we?

756
00:45:44,608 --> 00:45:46,075
What I'm trying to say is,
the way I behaved,

757
00:45:46,176 --> 00:45:48,235
I wouldn't have been surprised
if you would have, you know,

758
00:45:48,345 --> 00:45:50,609
looked the other way
on this thing, blocked it up.

759
00:45:50,714 --> 00:45:52,045
Why would I do that?

760
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:54,412
This guy.

761
00:45:54,518 --> 00:45:56,748
I can't tell if he's being smug or not.

762
00:45:59,022 --> 00:46:01,252
I just wanted you to know
that I'm not a bad guy.

763
00:46:02,659 --> 00:46:04,718
You didn't have to come all
the way in here to say that.

764
00:46:04,828 --> 00:46:05,886
I know that.

765
00:46:05,996 --> 00:46:07,759
Nobody knows that.

766
00:46:09,867 --> 00:46:11,164
You're a cool cat, Donnie.

767
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:13,425
Okay.

768
00:46:13,537 --> 00:46:15,004
Bye, Mr. Draper.

769
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:32,751
- Daddy!
- Daddy!

770
00:46:37,027 --> 00:46:38,085
How was your day?

771
00:46:39,663 --> 00:46:40,755
I made it.

772
00:47:00,784 --> 00:47:02,251
Where's the salt?

773
00:47:05,022 --> 00:47:06,489
Oh, Bets. No salt?

774
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:09,687
You'll see. You'll get used to it.

775
00:47:09,793 --> 00:47:11,658
It's for your own good.

776
00:47:15,432 --> 00:47:17,263
What would we do without you?

777
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:20,826
Why can't Daddy have salt?

778
00:47:21,939 --> 00:47:23,236
Because we love him.
