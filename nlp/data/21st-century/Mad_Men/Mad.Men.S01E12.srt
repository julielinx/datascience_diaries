<I>Previously on</I> Mad Men.

2
00:00:11,689 --> 00:00:14,650
I hope you're aware that I'd love
to throw my hat in the ring.

3
00:00:14,791 --> 00:00:15,591
I am now.

4
00:00:15,695 --> 00:00:16,940
Hopefully, if you follow my lead,

5
00:00:17,069 --> 00:00:18,713
you can avoid some of
the mistakes I've made here.

6
00:00:18,818 --> 00:00:20,615
- Hello, Joan.
- Like that one.

7
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,441
Hildy, you should do something
with that sourpuss.

8
00:00:23,853 --> 00:00:25,390
You're very beautiful.

9
00:00:26,522 --> 00:00:27,865
You have a problem with Nixon?

10
00:00:28,107 --> 00:00:29,325
I Don't vote.

11
00:00:29,509 --> 00:00:30,410
Hear, hear.

12
00:00:30,652 --> 00:00:31,994
Can you mail this for me

13
00:00:32,236 --> 00:00:33,209
today?

14
00:00:33,655 --> 00:00:34,709
Mr. Draper?

00:01:16,008 --> 00:01:18,207
Season 1 Episode 12
<I>Nixon vs. Kennedy</I>

16
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:21,260
<I>America is still going
to the polls at 4:00.</I>

17
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:24,395
<I>With some precincts opening
as early as 12 this morning,</I>

18
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:26,598
voters across the country
are deciding

19
00:01:26,715 --> 00:01:28,801
who will hold the most
important office in the fr--

20
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:38,980
Herman Phillips,

22
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:40,209
Bert Cooper.

24
00:01:40,327 --> 00:01:43,189
Actually, "Herman" goes on
my checks. People call me Duck.

25
00:01:43,391 --> 00:01:45,217
My research says I was
not to call you duck.

26
00:01:45,334 --> 00:01:46,950
- You should have told me that.
- I Don't know.

27
00:01:47,091 --> 00:01:48,993
I like when you say Herman.

28
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,658
Herman was in London with Y&R.

29
00:01:53,169 --> 00:01:54,535
Isn't this a step down?

30
00:01:54,777 --> 00:01:57,789
I Don't know. Moving back to the power
center of the universe, New York,

31
00:01:58,544 --> 00:02:00,082
and the chance
to put on some weight.

32
00:02:00,589 --> 00:02:02,809
English food.
I actually ate a kidney.

33
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:05,544
He landed Amican Airlines.

34
00:02:05,788 --> 00:02:07,757
You could make something
like that happen here.

35
00:02:07,999 --> 00:02:09,759
You have to spend money
to make money.

36
00:02:10,001 --> 00:02:11,386
So you're not promising anything.

37
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:13,043
Why would I do that?

38
00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:15,973
My goodness, he does want this job.

39
00:02:17,675 --> 00:02:20,603
I hope you play your cards
close to the vest with clients.

40
00:02:21,231 --> 00:02:22,480
I will keep that in mind.

41
00:02:22,722 --> 00:02:24,357
Here's a test. O'd you vote for?

42
00:02:24,854 --> 00:02:27,443
If I say Nixon,
you'll think I'm buttering you.

43
00:02:27,933 --> 00:02:29,879
And if I say Kennedy,
you'll want to reform me.

44
00:02:30,043 --> 00:02:32,198
So I'll say Nixon.

45
00:02:34,232 --> 00:02:35,883
That's nice to see.

46
00:02:45,104 --> 00:02:47,130
Cooper has a smoker
at the Waldorf at 6:00.

47
00:02:47,481 --> 00:02:49,242
- Marge told me.
- 23 skidoo.

48
00:02:49,388 --> 00:02:51,050
At 6:15, we turn on the returns

49
00:02:51,292 --> 00:02:52,817
and send for some ice.

50
00:02:53,483 --> 00:02:54,762
Party at the in-laws'.

51
00:02:55,004 --> 00:02:56,472
Another ending to a perfect day.

52
00:02:56,855 --> 00:02:58,141
Jennifer and I were going to get

53
00:02:58,383 --> 00:03:00,135
tickets to can-can.
It's empty, you know.

54
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:03,125
She says apparently the phone company's
a war zone on election night.

55
00:03:03,254 --> 00:03:04,861
That's what I'm hoping
for around here.

56
00:03:04,977 --> 00:03:07,025
You'd better hope she's sitting
at her switchboard

57
00:03:07,182 --> 00:03:08,964
and not doing what we're doing.

58
00:03:09,233 --> 00:03:10,278
It's my wife.

59
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,360
Besides, what if Nixon loses? Won't that
put a damper on things around here?

60
00:03:15,645 --> 00:03:17,171
Who cares? They
didn't want our help.

61
00:03:17,422 --> 00:03:18,579
You should care.

62
00:03:18,861 --> 00:03:21,545
I do. It matters for the nation
and for <I>Sterling Coop'</I>.

63
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:23,469
But tonight, either way.

64
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:26,377
If Nixon wins, we win.
If Nixon loses--

65
00:03:28,294 --> 00:03:29,926
Let me console you.

66
00:03:38,046 --> 00:03:39,046
That's him.

67
00:03:39,911 --> 00:03:41,179
Duck Phillips.

68
00:03:41,309 --> 00:03:42,343
I know his name.

69
00:03:42,549 --> 00:03:44,103
Because it's Duck?

70
00:03:47,776 --> 00:03:50,671
I grew up with a tuck.
At least that has an air of dignity.

71
00:03:50,943 --> 00:03:52,129
Don took him to Cooper.

72
00:03:52,452 --> 00:03:53,252
That's a first.

73
00:03:53,354 --> 00:03:55,432
I heard he disintegrated in London.

74
00:03:55,567 --> 00:03:58,561
Got involved with some woman
he met at the british museum.

75
00:03:58,794 --> 00:04:00,696
Her name was Rosetta.

76
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,439
Rosetta Stone.

77
00:04:04,792 --> 00:04:06,751
He's divorced. Lives in a hotel.

78
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:10,421
So what's this? His last stop?

79
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,336
No. He's a killer, but he's--

80
00:04:12,469 --> 00:04:14,289
He's damaged goods.
They're bargain hunting.

81
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:16,404
He's the best one
Draper's paraded around.

82
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:19,555
Let's see if Cooper's smart
enough to know that.

83
00:04:24,031 --> 00:04:25,353
Can I help you?

84
00:04:26,156 --> 00:04:27,156
What?

85
00:04:27,613 --> 00:04:28,846
Can I help you?

86
00:04:30,594 --> 00:04:32,068
Mr. Campbell would like to see you.

87
00:04:34,344 --> 00:04:35,344
<I>Send him in.</I>

88
00:04:36,346 --> 00:04:37,856
Thank you, sweetheart.

89
00:04:47,217 --> 00:04:48,692
So that Duck fellow,

90
00:04:49,554 --> 00:04:51,087
I heard he fell a part in London.

91
00:04:51,538 --> 00:04:52,853
American Airlines.

92
00:04:53,468 --> 00:04:54,924
$7 million in billings.

93
00:04:55,474 --> 00:04:57,810
He's not going to bring
that with him.

94
00:05:01,016 --> 00:05:04,183
Listen, Don, I Don't feel you've taken
me seriously as a candidate.

95
00:05:05,852 --> 00:05:06,811
Candidate for what?

96
00:05:08,288 --> 00:05:10,378
For the head of account services.

97
00:05:11,173 --> 00:05:12,546
We may have had our differences,

98
00:05:12,669 --> 00:05:14,676
but Roger knows I've done
everything I could to emulate him.

99
00:05:14,817 --> 00:05:16,637
Roger's not involved in this.

100
00:05:17,011 --> 00:05:17,822
Anything else?

101
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:21,345
I have the loyalty of
our most important clients:

102
00:05:21,534 --> 00:05:22,785
Calvin Highland, Lee Garner.

103
00:05:23,033 --> 00:05:24,233
These men trust me.

104
00:05:24,397 --> 00:05:26,592
They invite me to their
grandchildren's christenings.

105
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,409
When Walter veidt need a urologist,

106
00:05:28,596 --> 00:05:30,042
he called me for a recommendation.

107
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:34,290
Look, you're good at your job.
Cooper loves you.

108
00:05:35,027 --> 00:05:36,031
What's the hurry?

109
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,431
It's been twand a half years.

110
00:05:37,572 --> 00:05:38,968
I could have jumped
ship a hundred times.

111
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,095
Is that supposed to persuade me?

112
00:05:44,101 --> 00:05:46,273
I have tremendous value
to this company.

113
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:47,504
I'm aware of that.

114
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:49,727
But I Don't think you are.

115
00:05:49,856 --> 00:05:53,072
I am. I just hope you realize
that, the way things stand,

116
00:05:53,225 --> 00:05:55,193
there will continue to be
someone senior to you.

117
00:05:55,613 --> 00:05:57,909
Why? What can they offer?

118
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,970
All I'm asking is that
you think about it.

119
00:06:05,408 --> 00:06:08,705
There are men younger than me
with his job at bigger firms.

120
00:06:10,769 --> 00:06:12,376
Cooper sign off on what's-his-name?

121
00:06:13,157 --> 00:06:14,053
Duck?

122
00:06:14,222 --> 00:06:15,463
I'll keep you posted.

123
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,783
He's got a big lead.

124
00:06:27,924 --> 00:06:29,744
See you at the victory
party in the morning.

125
00:06:29,897 --> 00:06:30,904
Absolutely.

126
00:06:31,218 --> 00:06:33,221
Well, good night, Don.

127
00:06:36,118 --> 00:06:38,548
- He's gone!
- Olly olly oxen free!

128
00:06:45,232 --> 00:06:48,982
<I>With early returns just coming in,
our NBC computer</I>

129
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:53,989
<I>putting senator Kennedy's odds
for victory at a grim-sounding 22-1.</I>

130
00:06:59,658 --> 00:07:01,215
This is not good.

131
00:07:01,374 --> 00:07:03,095
And liquor stores are
closed tonight.

132
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:05,408
Draper has plenty of booze.

133
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,078
We could ask her to join us.
That might soften her up a bit.

134
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:16,188
I have a bottle of absinthe
in my office.

135
00:07:16,364 --> 00:07:18,568
- Isn't that illegal?
- It's marvelous.

136
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:20,734
I become incantatory.

137
00:07:21,214 --> 00:07:22,200
And what does that mean?

138
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:24,020
It means he starts making up words.

139
00:07:24,157 --> 00:07:25,707
Can someone freshen this?

140
00:07:27,017 --> 00:07:29,307
We're no going to make it.

141
00:07:30,058 --> 00:07:31,080
Really?

142
00:07:34,349 --> 00:07:35,989
If I let you into
that supply closet,

143
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:37,837
it is not going to be
the sack of Rome.

144
00:07:38,536 --> 00:07:40,323
What do we have too much of?

145
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,597
Rhum, crème de menthe,

146
00:07:44,187 --> 00:07:45,261
dog biscuits.

147
00:07:52,821 --> 00:07:53,830
May the best man win.

148
00:07:53,948 --> 00:07:56,684
It matters national and... local.

149
00:08:05,808 --> 00:08:08,117
Stop that. You're going to break it.

150
00:08:08,604 --> 00:08:10,536
Look. They're doing math.

151
00:08:11,221 --> 00:08:12,538
What do the numbers say?

152
00:08:13,349 --> 00:08:14,957
Who the President is going to be.

153
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,734
- Hello.
- Daddy! Hi!

154
00:08:26,709 --> 00:08:28,251
I wasn't expecting you.

155
00:08:28,471 --> 00:08:30,515
I thought you were going to be
watching returns at the office.

156
00:08:30,757 --> 00:08:32,239
What are you doing up?

157
00:08:32,668 --> 00:08:35,286
Mommy said it was okay.
I'm watching the news.

158
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:39,357
Nixon definitely won our precinct.
You should have seen the line.

159
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,943
Mommy said to ask you. What's the...

160
00:08:42,966 --> 00:08:44,153
Electoral college.

161
00:08:45,534 --> 00:08:48,366
I Don't think that's a conversation
appropriate for children.

162
00:08:49,347 --> 00:08:50,347
Come here.

163
00:08:52,881 --> 00:08:54,607
Do you want something to eat?

164
00:08:54,946 --> 00:08:56,207
I'm going to fix a drink. You?

165
00:08:56,663 --> 00:08:57,663
I'm set.

166
00:09:00,094 --> 00:09:03,339
<I>Senator Kennedy seems to be closing
the gap on the vice president's</I>

167
00:09:03,581 --> 00:09:04,548
<I>early lead.</I>

168
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:06,714
<I>State-by-state, Ohio, Illinois--</I>

169
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:12,390
- Come here.
- What?

170
00:09:12,902 --> 00:09:14,358
You'd better run.

171
00:09:15,812 --> 00:09:16,978
Go, Allison!

172
00:09:19,021 --> 00:09:20,231
- White!
- Pink!

173
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,158
You can tell me, or I can find out.

174
00:09:30,576 --> 00:09:32,067
What color panties are you wearing?

175
00:09:32,183 --> 00:09:33,453
What? My g--

176
00:09:38,987 --> 00:09:39,987
Blue!

177
00:09:40,428 --> 00:09:41,633
Who had blue?

178
00:09:46,363 --> 00:09:47,967
Can I walk you home?

179
00:09:54,369 --> 00:09:56,264
I used to think
I'd find a husband here.

180
00:09:58,117 --> 00:09:59,538
I think I'm going to go home.

181
00:09:59,714 --> 00:10:01,910
No, Don't go. It's going to be fun.

182
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,179
What are you doing?

183
00:10:44,306 --> 00:10:45,302
Why aren't you asleep?

184
00:10:45,468 --> 00:10:46,595
What is that?

185
00:10:47,432 --> 00:10:48,465
Nothing.

186
00:10:50,489 --> 00:10:53,574
Myrna found it on the top of the closet,
and I didn't want to look at it.

187
00:10:57,987 --> 00:11:01,032
My father has a box like that,
and I looked at it

188
00:11:01,185 --> 00:11:03,167
when I was a little girl,
and it was a mistake.

189
00:11:04,053 --> 00:11:05,169
So you didn't open it?

190
00:11:05,784 --> 00:11:08,214
Peter, I Don't want secrets.

191
00:11:12,359 --> 00:11:13,364
I can't sleep.

192
00:11:13,737 --> 00:11:14,737
I know.

193
00:11:15,674 --> 00:11:17,706
I've seen it the last few weeks.

194
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:20,017
You're not very quiet,

195
00:11:20,616 --> 00:11:22,835
and every time I see the closet door
is open and that box is gone

196
00:11:22,966 --> 00:11:23,890
I know you're out here.

197
00:11:23,992 --> 00:11:25,982
And you never looked in the box?

198
00:11:28,882 --> 00:11:30,268
It's not yours.

199
00:11:31,042 --> 00:11:33,174
- What are you doing with it?
- I got it by mistake.

200
00:11:33,807 --> 00:11:35,032
So give back.

201
00:11:35,552 --> 00:11:36,886
It's peculiar.

202
00:11:38,426 --> 00:11:39,701
It's not yours.

203
00:11:45,807 --> 00:11:47,000
Come to bed.

204
00:11:53,334 --> 00:11:55,588
<I>Vice president Nixon seems
to have carried </I>

205
00:11:55,753 --> 00:11:57,760
<I>predominantly catholic hudson county--</I>

206
00:11:57,891 --> 00:11:59,553
Kinsey, yore a liar.

207
00:12:00,655 --> 00:12:02,212
I couldn't find any absinthe.

208
00:12:02,376 --> 00:12:03,853
Who said you could go in my office?

209
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,121
We were exploring.

210
00:12:06,581 --> 00:12:09,949
But all we found was a large
collection of mad magazines

211
00:12:10,219 --> 00:12:11,527
and this...

212
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:13,863
fascinating dramatic piece.

213
00:12:15,043 --> 00:12:16,593
Death is my client--

214
00:12:17,527 --> 00:12:18,451
A play in one act

215
00:12:18,814 --> 00:12:20,418
by Paul Kinsey.

216
00:12:20,595 --> 00:12:21,741
Give it to me.

217
00:12:22,989 --> 00:12:24,403
"Peter Tollifson"--

218
00:12:25,285 --> 00:12:27,919
"An animal in the board room
and the bedroom."

219
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:34,130
Now, rember, he's angry.

220
00:12:34,718 --> 00:12:36,173
Why do I have to play Tollifson?

221
00:12:36,326 --> 00:12:38,262
- I wanted to be galt.
- Tollifson is the hero.

222
00:12:39,052 --> 00:12:40,052
He thinks.

223
00:12:42,172 --> 00:12:44,268
Galt's a thug from the wrong side

224
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:46,924
of the tracks.
You Don't want to be galt.

225
00:12:49,991 --> 00:12:50,991
Go ahead.

226
00:12:52,034 --> 00:12:54,237
I'm sorry. I Don't have the pages.

227
00:12:59,687 --> 00:13:01,776
"I worked with Tollifson
for four years."

228
00:13:01,992 --> 00:13:04,038
"I shared everything,
but I never knew him."

229
00:13:04,677 --> 00:13:06,028
"I thought I knew him."

230
00:13:06,192 --> 00:13:08,000
"He used to talk to me."

231
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,866
"I can't control my genius."

232
00:13:10,046 --> 00:13:12,296
"I'm not some boorish natural
like that hack Cosgrove."

233
00:13:16,715 --> 00:13:18,411
That's crackerjack, kinsey.

234
00:13:20,219 --> 00:13:21,699
"Your genius beamned."

235
00:13:22,117 --> 00:13:23,117
"Perhaps."

236
00:13:23,611 --> 00:13:25,268
"You can make anyone buy anything."

237
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:27,785
"Anyone but me."

238
00:14:04,891 --> 00:14:05,892
Turn the music down.

239
00:14:06,624 --> 00:14:09,479
<I>...now have confirmation
that the state of Ioha</I>

240
00:14:09,721 --> 00:14:13,202
<I>has indeed gone
to vice president Richard Nixon.</I>

241
00:14:32,597 --> 00:14:34,675
I'm-- I'm really tipsy.

242
00:14:52,624 --> 00:14:53,892
I feel awful.

243
00:14:54,056 --> 00:14:54,870
No.

244
00:14:56,369 --> 00:14:57,363
It was me.

245
00:14:57,692 --> 00:15:00,005
I'm-- I'm drunk.

246
00:15:03,612 --> 00:15:04,450
I'm happy...

247
00:15:05,993 --> 00:15:07,291
But not myself.

248
00:15:11,242 --> 00:15:13,501
I've never really
seen your eyes before.

249
00:15:15,433 --> 00:15:16,825
There they are.

250
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,653
Just the two of them.

251
00:15:55,927 --> 00:15:57,183
What's going on?

252
00:15:57,428 --> 00:15:58,515
I Don't know.

253
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:01,632
It'll be all right in the morning.
He'll win california.

254
00:16:04,237 --> 00:16:05,384
Turn it off.

255
00:16:20,509 --> 00:16:21,611
Sit down.

256
00:16:23,123 --> 00:16:23,933
No.

257
00:16:25,389 --> 00:16:27,697
You can't sit down in that dress.

258
00:16:32,817 --> 00:16:35,196
You look so different
when you're drunk.

259
00:16:36,509 --> 00:16:38,435
You're not going to call me
Orson Welles again.

260
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:39,791
You loved that.

261
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:41,631
Who wouldn't like that?

262
00:16:47,447 --> 00:16:48,863
What did I do wrong?

263
00:16:51,696 --> 00:16:53,339
You have a big mouth.

264
00:16:54,032 --> 00:16:56,652
- Joan, I never said--
- You have a big mouth.

265
00:17:01,011 --> 00:17:02,011
I do.

266
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:04,580
I'm not proud of it.

267
00:17:07,698 --> 00:17:09,196
Did you like the play?

268
00:17:10,385 --> 00:17:11,190
No.

269
00:17:14,748 --> 00:17:17,414
The meaner you are,
the more I like you.

270
00:17:18,554 --> 00:17:19,669
I know.

271
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:32,324
Just like that?

272
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:34,934
I thought we could dance.

273
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:51,506
1, 2, cha-cha.

274
00:18:10,182 --> 00:18:12,032
Hildy, wake up.

275
00:18:12,813 --> 00:18:13,999
It's cold in here.

276
00:18:14,182 --> 00:18:16,367
It is. You have to get dressed.

277
00:18:29,804 --> 00:18:31,558
I can't find my glasses.

278
00:18:37,681 --> 00:18:38,991
That's too bad.

279
00:18:39,992 --> 00:18:40,992
Tremendous.

280
00:18:53,303 --> 00:18:54,222
Yes?

281
00:18:57,319 --> 00:18:59,163
I hope I didn't step on them.

282
00:19:05,246 --> 00:19:06,246
Damn it.

283
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,284
There's an optometrist on Lexington.

284
00:19:16,435 --> 00:19:18,067
Great. Of course.

285
00:19:30,126 --> 00:19:32,075
I Don't want you to be worried.

286
00:19:32,876 --> 00:19:34,801
It didn't mean anything, okay?

287
00:20:22,086 --> 00:20:24,998
You're not drinking for taste.
Don't be such babies.

288
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:29,559
Oh, God.

289
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:31,618
It's definitely not helping.

290
00:20:32,897 --> 00:20:35,022
I'm sorry. Does it offend you?

291
00:20:42,431 --> 00:20:43,431
My shirt.

292
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:45,291
And my mad money. Who did this?

293
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:47,389
I stole your blouse.

294
00:20:47,811 --> 00:20:49,948
I'm not joking. I had $3.00 in here.

295
00:20:50,127 --> 00:20:53,007
If I give you $3.00,
will you keep your voice down?

296
00:20:54,306 --> 00:20:55,471
You're animals.

297
00:20:56,058 --> 00:20:58,012
I'm reporting it
to building security.

298
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:01,124
Striking resemblance
to <I>Broderick Crawford</I>*.

299
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:04,183
Peggy Olsen, highway patrol.

300
00:21:15,377 --> 00:21:19,240
I've read three different newspapers
with three different results.

301
00:21:19,413 --> 00:21:21,021
I'm sure you know something I Don't.

302
00:21:22,242 --> 00:21:24,722
I just spent the night
literally in a smoke-filled

303
00:21:24,895 --> 00:21:28,089
room at the Waldorf with
every republican luminary

304
00:21:28,758 --> 00:21:30,742
save MacArthur and Jesus.

305
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,672
There's been widespread fraud.

306
00:21:33,665 --> 00:21:38,504
Daley gave Joe Kennedy
every corpse in cook county.

307
00:21:38,704 --> 00:21:40,559
Otherwise, Nixon wins.

308
00:21:42,096 --> 00:21:43,423
It shouldn't have been at close.

309
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:45,443
But it is. It always is.

310
00:21:46,511 --> 00:21:47,956
Those jingles.

311
00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:50,901
When they got Frank Sinatra,

312
00:21:51,829 --> 00:21:53,119
I knew they would close the gap.

313
00:21:53,432 --> 00:21:54,987
So what does he do now?

314
00:21:56,054 --> 00:21:57,059
Walk away? Concede?

315
00:21:57,435 --> 00:22:00,482
A recount in Illinois alone
means 30 days

316
00:22:00,658 --> 00:22:02,785
without a president.
You Don't want to win like at.

317
00:22:03,499 --> 00:22:04,903
But you want to win.

318
00:22:05,307 --> 00:22:07,480
He got 50% of the vote, maybe more.

319
00:22:07,682 --> 00:22:09,558
This way he lives
to see another day.

320
00:22:11,324 --> 00:22:14,473
- What happens?
- Neil from P&G said

321
00:22:14,617 --> 00:22:16,667
if Kennedy is willing
to buy an election,

322
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:19,927
he's probably willing
to play ball with us.

323
00:22:21,109 --> 00:22:23,306
The optimism of
the American corporation.

324
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:25,266
It's a football game to them.

325
00:22:25,598 --> 00:22:27,602
- Doesn't seem fair.
- Fair?

326
00:22:29,665 --> 00:22:30,665
Very good.

327
00:22:39,288 --> 00:22:41,331
Where do you think you're going?

328
00:22:41,998 --> 00:22:44,311
If I were you, I would be very,
very careful from now on

329
00:22:44,464 --> 00:22:45,703
about the way you speak to me.

330
00:22:51,164 --> 00:22:52,545
Can I help you?

331
00:22:55,979 --> 00:22:56,979
What's that?

332
00:22:57,329 --> 00:22:59,790
It's yours. It came to me
by mistake.

333
00:23:00,855 --> 00:23:01,966
Well, thanks.

334
00:23:03,727 --> 00:23:07,496
Have you reconsidered my qualifications
for the head of account services?

335
00:23:08,352 --> 00:23:11,062
Would it disappoint you if I told
you it hadn't crossed my mind?

336
00:23:28,104 --> 00:23:30,792
I feel strange having
to talk to you in this way.

337
00:23:33,792 --> 00:23:35,396
Spit it out, Campbell.

338
00:23:37,173 --> 00:23:39,697
I know that your name
is not Donald Draper.

339
00:23:40,607 --> 00:23:41,964
It's Dick Whitman.

340
00:23:49,191 --> 00:23:51,175
I Don't know who Donald Draper is,

341
00:23:51,607 --> 00:23:54,439
but according to my friend Russ
at the department of Defense,

342
00:23:54,955 --> 00:23:57,525
Dick Whitman died in korea in 1950,

343
00:23:58,029 --> 00:24:00,296
and Donald Draper
dropped off the map.

344
00:24:00,554 --> 00:24:02,832
Although he's 43 years old,
in which case

345
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:04,157
you look remarkably good.

346
00:24:06,045 --> 00:24:07,910
- That's kind of elaborate.
- Really?

347
00:24:09,908 --> 00:24:11,329
I wish I knew more.

348
00:24:12,487 --> 00:24:13,583
I bet a lot of people do.

349
00:24:17,459 --> 00:24:18,358
Get out.

350
00:24:19,173 --> 00:24:22,273
- You're making a fool of yourself.
- You can deny it.

351
00:24:23,398 --> 00:24:25,928
But I know it's true.
I can see from your face.

352
00:24:28,918 --> 00:24:30,016
You should leave.

353
00:24:32,524 --> 00:24:35,330
You should think about
how Bert Cooper will react

354
00:24:35,494 --> 00:24:36,814
when he hears this information.

355
00:24:37,479 --> 00:24:38,789
What information?

356
00:24:39,484 --> 00:24:41,340
You're not who you say you are,

357
00:24:41,544 --> 00:24:43,364
and there's obviously a reason.

358
00:24:44,911 --> 00:24:45,740
Come on.

359
00:24:46,978 --> 00:24:50,172
I would like you to reconsider
my qualifications.

360
00:25:06,107 --> 00:25:07,804
You said everything
except "or else."

361
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:14,281
Assuming this information
is true, which it isn't,

362
00:25:15,753 --> 00:25:17,972
it sounds to me like
you're blackmailing me.

363
00:25:18,168 --> 00:25:19,168
I'm not.

364
00:25:20,979 --> 00:25:22,686
I'm hoping you'll realize

365
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,956
that this all can be forgotten.

366
00:25:29,373 --> 00:25:31,536
It's not like you're
a deserter, is it?

367
00:25:32,272 --> 00:25:34,773
When you threaten someone
in this manner,

368
00:25:35,423 --> 00:25:37,990
you should be aware of the fact
that if your information

369
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:41,386
is powerful enough
to make them
do what you want...

370
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:45,091
What else can it make them do?

371
00:25:46,663 --> 00:25:50,103
It's very simple. And it's not a threat.
It's just a job.

372
00:25:53,983 --> 00:25:55,434
Think about it.

373
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:44,420
Whitman.

374
00:26:49,798 --> 00:26:50,798
Yes, Sergeant.

375
00:26:53,421 --> 00:26:54,543
What is this?

376
00:26:55,861 --> 00:26:56,861
This is it.

377
00:26:58,948 --> 00:27:00,941
One? I'm supposed to have 20.

378
00:27:01,068 --> 00:27:03,933
This is going to take a month,
and it should take 4 hours.

379
00:27:04,143 --> 00:27:06,562
Well, you're whining
to the wrong guy, sir.

380
00:27:24,902 --> 00:27:25,902
At ease.

381
00:27:28,541 --> 00:27:30,009
This is for officers.

382
00:27:30,785 --> 00:27:32,065
You can bunk next door.

383
00:27:32,235 --> 00:27:36,056
I'd introduce you to the men, but
you're looking at the complete company.

384
00:27:38,342 --> 00:27:39,650
Where is everybody, sir?

385
00:27:39,843 --> 00:27:41,666
They were gone when I got here.

386
00:27:42,565 --> 00:27:43,733
I'm an engineer.

387
00:27:43,909 --> 00:27:45,975
They're in some action
5 miles over that mountain.

388
00:27:46,104 --> 00:27:47,349
You want to go?

389
00:27:48,717 --> 00:27:50,133
The answer is no.

390
00:27:52,278 --> 00:27:54,133
The locals stopped
showing up three days ago,

391
00:27:54,286 --> 00:27:56,141
which, by the way, is not good.

392
00:27:56,596 --> 00:27:59,003
You're going to be
doing all the digging.

393
00:27:59,396 --> 00:28:02,937
- Digging what?
- Well, this unit-- That's you--

394
00:28:04,035 --> 00:28:07,158
Will be establishing
a field hospital, but first we're

395
00:28:07,406 --> 00:28:10,904
going to be digging fighting
positions on four sides.

396
00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:15,450
What are you doing here?

397
00:28:15,903 --> 00:28:17,025
Are you poor?

398
00:28:17,525 --> 00:28:19,716
- I volunteered.
- You're kidding me.

399
00:28:21,215 --> 00:28:23,258
Well, they got me with college.

400
00:28:25,484 --> 00:28:27,962
But I'm three years six months--
Nearly a civilian.

401
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:32,334
I'm supposed to be building
swimming pools, not latrines.

402
00:28:32,842 --> 00:28:34,340
You any good with that rifle?

403
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:36,929
I wouldn't want you
to mistake me for Chinese.

404
00:28:37,115 --> 00:28:39,721
Much practice as I've had, yes.

405
00:28:44,031 --> 00:28:47,976
What misconception traveled down
the road and made you want to be here?

406
00:28:48,307 --> 00:28:51,230
- A movie?
- No. I just wanted to leave.

407
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:55,385
I'll bet you're reconsidering
if this was a step up.

408
00:29:28,215 --> 00:29:29,215
<I>Miss Menken,</I>

409
00:29:29,649 --> 00:29:31,621
<I>Mr. Draper is here to see you.</I>

410
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,504
Please hold my calls.

411
00:29:49,318 --> 00:29:51,537
Did you run over? You're flushed.

412
00:30:03,714 --> 00:30:04,954
Let's go away.

413
00:30:06,092 --> 00:30:07,562
Really? Where?

414
00:30:08,218 --> 00:30:10,276
- Anywhere.
- Warmer weather?

415
00:30:11,214 --> 00:30:12,214
Sure.

416
00:30:13,408 --> 00:30:14,444
How about Los Angeles?

417
00:30:15,094 --> 00:30:16,698
Mexico? I have money.

418
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,782
I have money, but
I have a store to run.

419
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:25,361
Don, are you well?

420
00:30:27,342 --> 00:30:30,348
- No, I'm not.
- Did something else happen to roger?

421
00:30:31,902 --> 00:30:32,902
No.

422
00:30:34,276 --> 00:30:36,134
Something happened, and...

423
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,926
I want to go, and I want you
to come with me,

424
00:30:39,168 --> 00:30:41,375
and I Don't want to come back.

425
00:30:41,988 --> 00:30:43,737
- What happened?
- What does it matter?

426
00:30:43,903 --> 00:30:45,493
Isn't this what you want?

427
00:30:47,926 --> 00:30:50,392
Of course, I've thought about it.

428
00:30:51,592 --> 00:30:53,518
My God. We've talked about it.

429
00:30:54,163 --> 00:30:54,984
I just--

430
00:30:56,465 --> 00:31:00,000
I just didn't think it would happen--
I mean, especially this way.

431
00:31:02,607 --> 00:31:03,409
I just...

432
00:31:04,477 --> 00:31:07,288
Don't want to be without you,
and I Don't want to be here.

433
00:31:08,651 --> 00:31:10,313
I can't just leave.

434
00:31:16,169 --> 00:31:18,278
- Maybe this weekend--
- Rachel.

435
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,298
No. This isn't how
I thought it would be.

436
00:31:30,416 --> 00:31:31,437
What is the difference?

437
00:31:32,465 --> 00:31:35,691
We'll go somewhere else.
Well start over like Adam and Eve.

438
00:31:36,588 --> 00:31:38,596
What, are you 15 years old?

439
00:31:38,904 --> 00:31:39,904
My father--

440
00:31:41,154 --> 00:31:43,366
- Can't we be together here?
- There's nothing here.

441
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:46,661
What about your children?

442
00:31:48,594 --> 00:31:49,869
I'll provide for them.

443
00:31:50,027 --> 00:31:51,916
And live in Los Angeles?

444
00:31:53,345 --> 00:31:56,151
My God, you haven't
thought this through.

445
00:31:57,028 --> 00:31:58,209
I feel sick.

446
00:31:59,002 --> 00:32:01,233
You're wrong. I know
exactly what I want.

447
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:04,096
You want your children to go on without
a father? You know how that felt.

448
00:32:04,264 --> 00:32:06,851
Are you having an attack
of conscience after all this?

449
00:32:06,974 --> 00:32:10,059
No. I'm watching you talk
because I feel I Don'tnow you.

450
00:32:13,286 --> 00:32:15,940
You know more about me than anyone.

451
00:32:16,677 --> 00:32:18,767
You won't even tell me
what happened.

452
00:32:24,577 --> 00:32:26,329
Why are you doing th to me?

453
00:32:27,887 --> 00:32:29,617
What kind of man are you?

454
00:32:30,801 --> 00:32:33,877
Go away, drop everything,
leave your life?

455
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:36,554
People do it every day.

456
00:32:39,263 --> 00:32:41,007
This was a dalliance,

457
00:32:41,391 --> 00:32:42,988
- a cheap affair.
- Rachel, Don't.

458
00:32:43,094 --> 00:32:44,497
You Don't want to run away with me.

459
00:32:44,614 --> 00:32:46,526
You just want to run away.

460
00:32:47,887 --> 00:32:49,256
You're a coward.

461
00:32:54,134 --> 00:32:55,984
Please go now.

462
00:32:58,155 --> 00:32:59,155
Get out.

463
00:33:37,155 --> 00:33:39,816
Peggy, this is my office.
Does this door mean nothing to you?

464
00:33:40,589 --> 00:33:41,876
I'm sorry, Mr. Draper.

465
00:33:42,087 --> 00:33:44,623
I didn't know you were
coming back. I just--

466
00:33:47,754 --> 00:33:48,841
I just--

467
00:33:56,153 --> 00:33:57,153
Calm down.

468
00:34:01,964 --> 00:34:02,964
Stop it.

469
00:34:04,341 --> 00:34:06,196
I didn't mean to yell at you.

470
00:34:07,537 --> 00:34:09,679
Got to be some semblance
of privacy left here.

471
00:34:12,048 --> 00:34:14,183
I had to get away from them all
for a minute.

472
00:34:18,217 --> 00:34:19,217
Drink this.

473
00:34:29,279 --> 00:34:30,450
Sonny from the elevator

474
00:34:32,223 --> 00:34:34,201
and some janitor--
I Don't know his name--

475
00:34:35,027 --> 00:34:36,289
They got fired.

476
00:34:37,747 --> 00:34:39,097
That's why you're crying?

477
00:34:39,265 --> 00:34:40,650
It was my fault.

478
00:34:41,717 --> 00:34:43,109
I called security.

479
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:47,959
They weren't even here last night.

480
00:34:50,777 --> 00:34:52,644
Peggy, I need to be alone right now.

481
00:34:52,841 --> 00:34:53,841
I know.

482
00:34:57,318 --> 00:34:58,338
I know.

483
00:35:00,779 --> 00:35:02,089
I Don't understand.

484
00:35:03,472 --> 00:35:05,228
I try to do my job.

485
00:35:05,841 --> 00:35:07,398
I follow the rules,

486
00:35:08,342 --> 00:35:09,899
and people hate me.

487
00:35:11,089 --> 00:35:13,297
Innocent people get hurt, and--

488
00:35:14,655 --> 00:35:15,942
And other people--

489
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,916
People who are not good--

490
00:35:19,959 --> 00:35:22,601
Get to walk around
doing whatever they want.

491
00:35:24,841 --> 00:35:25,846
It's not fair.

492
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:30,408
Finish it.

493
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:17,722
I've thought about what you said.

494
00:36:18,138 --> 00:36:19,519
Glad to hear it.

495
00:36:20,326 --> 00:36:22,158
And then I thought about you

496
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,147
and what a deep lack
of character you have.

497
00:36:30,512 --> 00:36:32,638
I can understand
your frustation, Don.

498
00:36:32,858 --> 00:36:34,701
I'm not enjoying this
any more than you are.

499
00:36:34,819 --> 00:36:36,075
I'm hiring Duck Phillips.

500
00:36:40,629 --> 00:36:44,036
- Don't make me go to Cooper.
- I'm not making you do anything.

501
00:36:44,842 --> 00:36:46,328
You haven't thought this through.

502
00:36:46,585 --> 00:36:47,751
- I have.
- Really?

503
00:36:47,927 --> 00:36:50,785
You're just going to go up to
the office and tell Bert Cooper.

504
00:36:51,013 --> 00:36:52,194
If I have to.

505
00:36:52,529 --> 00:36:54,678
- I Don't want to.
- Let me ask you.

506
00:36:55,336 --> 00:36:58,471
How do you think he'll react when
you tell him this story of yours?

507
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,932
You expect him to promote you

508
00:37:00,822 --> 00:37:03,992
- after the way you've behave?
- I think he'll appreciate the loyalty.

509
00:37:04,195 --> 00:37:06,189
You haven't thought this through.

510
00:37:09,239 --> 00:37:10,326
I Don't know.

511
00:37:11,547 --> 00:37:13,780
But I'm pretty sure you won't be
working here anymore.

512
00:37:27,225 --> 00:37:28,651
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

513
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,212
I'm going to take care
of this right now.

514
00:37:30,356 --> 00:37:32,364
Is this like in the movies
where I have a gun

515
00:37:32,474 --> 00:37:34,104
and you Don't think
I'm going to shoot you?

516
00:37:34,222 --> 00:37:35,278
I will shoot you.

517
00:37:35,404 --> 00:37:36,825
I won't let you
hold this over my head.

518
00:37:36,942 --> 00:37:40,394
So you'd rather blow yourself up
than make me head of accounts.

519
00:37:51,485 --> 00:37:52,997
Why can't you give me what I want?

520
00:37:53,121 --> 00:37:54,800
I've earned this job. I deserve it.

521
00:37:54,911 --> 00:37:56,355
Why? Because your parents are rich?

522
00:37:57,277 --> 00:38:00,034
because you went to prep school
and have a $5.00 haircut?

523
00:38:00,499 --> 00:38:02,526
you've been given everything.
you've never worked

524
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:03,822
for anything in your life.

525
00:38:03,971 --> 00:38:06,942
For gosh sakes, Don't you realize
you're going to lose everything?

526
00:38:07,111 --> 00:38:08,767
I'm giving you a way out.

527
00:38:09,276 --> 00:38:12,338
Would it be so bad?
Why is this so hard for you?

528
00:38:24,993 --> 00:38:26,860
You' really going to do this?

529
00:38:33,068 --> 00:38:34,371
More bad news?

530
00:38:35,489 --> 00:38:37,110
If you came here
to drown your sorrows,

531
00:38:37,259 --> 00:38:39,408
I'm not really much of a drinker.

532
00:38:39,595 --> 00:38:41,310
No. I just wanted to say--

533
00:38:43,683 --> 00:38:47,034
I'm pulling the trigger on Duck Phillips
as new head of Account services.

534
00:38:47,252 --> 00:38:48,139
Good.

535
00:38:49,095 --> 00:38:49,917
Well done.

536
00:39:01,388 --> 00:39:02,388
what?

537
00:39:04,607 --> 00:39:06,520
I have to bring this up to you.

538
00:39:07,554 --> 00:39:10,172
Only because I believe
if I kept it from you

539
00:39:10,362 --> 00:39:12,710
in the end it would be
damaging to <I>Sterling-Cooper</I>.

540
00:39:13,859 --> 00:39:15,069
It has come to my attention,

541
00:39:15,654 --> 00:39:17,885
completely by accident,
that Donald Draper here

542
00:39:18,038 --> 00:39:19,655
is not who he says he is.

543
00:39:20,631 --> 00:39:22,521
His real name is Dick Whitman,

544
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:23,980
But...

545
00:39:24,708 --> 00:39:27,163
Dick Whitman died
in Korea ten years ago.

546
00:39:28,386 --> 00:39:29,999
It stands to reason that...

547
00:39:31,705 --> 00:39:34,629
he is a deserter at the very least
and who knows what else.

548
00:39:59,574 --> 00:40:00,696
Mr. Campbell,

549
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:02,451
who cares?

550
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:07,453
- What?
- Who cares?

551
00:40:08,013 --> 00:40:11,624
Mr. Cooper, he's a fraud a liar.
A criminal, even.

552
00:40:13,441 --> 00:40:15,503
Even if this were true, who cares?

553
00:40:15,964 --> 00:40:19,183
This country was built and run
by men with worse stories

554
00:40:19,324 --> 00:40:21,634
than whatever you've imagined here.

555
00:40:22,201 --> 00:40:23,462
I'm not imaging anything.

556
00:40:29,392 --> 00:40:31,212
the japanese have a saying:

557
00:40:31,394 --> 00:40:34,188
a man is whatever room he is in,

558
00:40:34,387 --> 00:40:36,726
and right now Donald Draper

559
00:40:37,076 --> 00:40:38,943
is in this room.

560
00:40:39,629 --> 00:40:40,763
I assure you,

561
00:40:41,985 --> 00:40:44,483
There's more profit
in forgetting this.

562
00:40:45,817 --> 00:40:48,411
I'd put your energy
into bringing in accounts.

563
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:02,802
Fire him if you want.

564
00:41:04,578 --> 00:41:06,645
But I'd keep an eye on him.

565
00:41:08,084 --> 00:41:10,714
One never knows how loyalty is born.

566
00:41:40,194 --> 00:41:41,920
- Sir, what do we do?
- Keep your head.

567
00:41:42,038 --> 00:41:44,384
Don't shoot at anything
unless it shoots at you first.

568
00:41:48,046 --> 00:41:48,857
What?

569
00:41:50,581 --> 00:41:52,143
Shut up! Just stay down!

570
00:41:53,155 --> 00:41:54,751
Do they know *** hospital?

571
00:41:55,037 --> 00:41:56,979
We're nuts if they know that.

572
00:42:08,224 --> 00:42:10,330
- Is it over?
- I Don't know.

573
00:42:25,915 --> 00:42:27,818
- You think they'll be back?
- I Don't know.

574
00:42:28,039 --> 00:42:29,804
We didn't shoot back. That helps.

575
00:42:36,014 --> 00:42:37,524
You pissed yourself.

576
00:42:38,652 --> 00:42:39,462
What?

577
00:42:40,916 --> 00:42:41,762
Did I?

578
00:43:12,348 --> 00:43:14,708
How are we doing, Lieutenant Draper?

579
00:43:23,583 --> 00:43:26,213
On behalf of the President
of the United States

580
00:43:27,291 --> 00:43:29,739
and the citizens of
the United States of America...

581
00:43:33,725 --> 00:43:36,238
I present you with this
purple heart medal.

582
00:43:37,472 --> 00:43:40,124
The concussion was minor.
You'll feel like yourself in a week.

583
00:43:46,665 --> 00:43:49,225
The Colonel here has
some good news for you.

584
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:52,553
We're releasing you to
the reserves for your last 80 days.

585
00:43:52,715 --> 00:43:54,253
You're going home.

586
00:44:02,169 --> 00:44:04,819
That's good news.
you're going to be okay.

587
00:44:12,144 --> 00:44:14,762
Lieutenant Draper, private Whitman.

588
00:44:15,741 --> 00:44:18,405
You were the last person who
knew him in his chain of command.

589
00:44:18,623 --> 00:44:20,584
We'd like you to take him home.

590
00:44:23,815 --> 00:44:25,882
I think it would mean something.

591
00:44:31,967 --> 00:44:34,233
Lieutenant Hayes, how are you doing?

592
00:44:38,687 --> 00:44:40,630
On behalf of the President
of the United States

593
00:44:40,759 --> 00:44:42,849
and the citizens of
the United States of America...

594
00:44:56,196 --> 00:44:57,741
This is us, Lieutenant.

595
00:45:27,225 --> 00:45:28,528
Lieutenant Draper?

596
00:45:31,676 --> 00:45:32,740
Just go.

597
00:45:35,239 --> 00:45:36,073
I can't.

598
00:45:52,175 --> 00:45:53,877
There he is! I see him!

599
00:45:54,158 --> 00:45:54,969
Who?

600
00:45:55,108 --> 00:45:57,315
Dick. He's on the train. I see him.

601
00:45:57,497 --> 00:45:59,018
No, he's right here.

602
00:45:59,865 --> 00:46:00,929
but I saw him.

603
00:46:01,164 --> 00:46:03,324
- I saw him in the window over there.
- Stop it.

604
00:46:03,472 --> 00:46:04,759
No more of that.

605
00:46:05,974 --> 00:46:07,054
It must be hard for you.

606
00:46:09,224 --> 00:46:10,346
Did you know him?

607
00:46:13,544 --> 00:46:14,346
A little.

608
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:17,030
you got your whole life
ahead of you.

609
00:46:17,262 --> 00:46:18,698
Forget that boy in the box.

610
00:46:23,148 --> 00:46:24,223
look at you.

611
00:46:25,999 --> 00:46:27,970
Let me buy a soldier a drink.

612
00:47:44,402 --> 00:47:45,938
<I>...my congratulations</I>

613
00:47:46,216 --> 00:47:48,682
<I>to senator Kennedy for his fine race</I>

614
00:47:48,842 --> 00:47:51,965
<I>in this campaign, and to all of you--</I>
