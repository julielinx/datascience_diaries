1
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:52,307
Sally! Bobby!

2
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:55,484
They sell it at Woolworths.

3
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:58,682
There's a section that says
"Halloween costumes. "

4
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:02,250
You'll wear it once.
Plus, it's made out of plastic and it's crap.

5
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:06,560
- I'm always gonna love Minnie Mouse.
- I'm gonna be an astronaut.

6
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,763
Didn't you hear me? The luggage.

7
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:13,862
- I'll go get it.
- That's not the point. They don't listen.

8
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:15,634
There's more? It's a week.

9
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,711
We're going for a week?
Are we gonna miss Halloween?

10
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:21,542
They have Halloween there.
You'll go with your cousins.

11
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:24,617
Say goodbye to your father,
then get the bags.

12
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,682
They have a Woolworths in Philly, too.

13
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:39,229
- I only have $40.
- Swing by the bank.

14
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:42,566
There should be at least $200
in your checking. That's plenty.

15
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:44,534
You have no more money?

16
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:48,771
Take care.

17
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:54,339
Roger, I think you remember...

18
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:58,042
- Annabelle.
- You look wonderful.

19
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:02,845
You look exactly the same.

20
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,927
- This is Annabelle... What is it again?
- Mathis.

21
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:12,054
I can't tell if you two
know each other or not.

22
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:13,860
- Don Draper.
- Hello.

23
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:16,969
Please, Mrs. Mathis, sit.

24
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:21,766
How the hell were you in town
and not look me up?

25
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:26,736
I wasn't sure about coming back here.
I'm running the company now.

26
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:30,040
- You divorced what's-his-name?
- No, David died,

27
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:34,249
and because of my father's will,
the company went back to me.

28
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:37,714
- I'm sorry.
- Fifty-one years old. Lung cancer.

29
00:02:42,028 --> 00:02:43,518
That's too bad.

30
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:48,628
- So...
- So, yes, if you're open to it.

31
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:52,198
Caldecott Farms, I'm sure you've heard,

32
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:56,202
had a public relations crisis
followed by disastrous sales.

33
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:59,810
<i>- I hadn't heard.
- The Misfits, the movie. Clark Gable.</i>

34
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:04,006
It was about horses
being turned into dog food.

35
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:08,283
- There was an exposé.
- We were singled out. I don't know why.

36
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:11,988
You don't know why? She owns
a horse farm that makes dog food.

37
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:14,218
We had a 15% share of the market,

38
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:17,228
but now Benton & Bowles
has dropped us for Gravy Train.

39
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,298
Well, that was a mistake.

40
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:23,267
People eat cow but they call it beef.
Chicken is poultry.

41
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,564
- Pig...
- We got it, sweetheart.

42
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:30,207
Well, there is no other word for horse meat.
I thought maybe you could invent one.

43
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:33,575
- What do you think, Don?
- I think it's a tall order.

44
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:37,446
- Do you have to use horse meat?
- All dog food is horse meat.

45
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,212
People eat it all over the world.
I've eaten it. It's delicious.

46
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,720
- It's like venison.
- I've eaten it.

47
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,885
Well, I'll tell you
what I'm telling the Avenue.

48
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:49,758
- Best idea gets my business.
- How long do we have?

49
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:54,129
I'm in town until Friday,
but only the big firms are rushing.

50
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:58,094
Well, I'm not gonna sit here
and brag about how big I am.

51
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,966
Roger.

52
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:08,278
Bert, I have two simple rules.

53
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:12,309
I don't want to change the recipe.
It's all meat.

54
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:15,285
And two,
my father named it Caldecott Farms.

55
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:18,114
Don't change the name.
Don't change the product.

56
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:20,419
- Got it.
- Walk me out?

57
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:30,368
We had their business before,
but her father was a son of a bitch.

58
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:35,101
You know, people spend more money
on dog food than baby food.

59
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,199
I'll put the fellas on it.

60
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:44,945
- Is that really necessary?
- You've never walked in high heels.

61
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:48,578
No, coming in here.
What are you doing here?

62
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:51,713
I wanted to see you,
and I need something new.

63
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:54,854
- I'll bet you do.
- For my business.

64
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,923
Besides, you're married, aren't you?

65
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:00,124
- I am.
- Still or again?

66
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:05,227
- You know it's again. Don't get cute.
- I heard she's a teenager.

67
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,503
Probably too jealous to let you
have a business dinner with me.

68
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:13,101
- Gonna need a reason.
- Because I know you're good at this.

69
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:15,077
Advertising, I mean.

70
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:19,777
<i>- Tomorrow night. Somewhere French.
- Avec plaisir.</i>

71
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:29,525
All the lights were on.
I figured you'd be home.

72
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:32,393
I knew you were coming over.
Thought it might be dark when I got home

73
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:35,433
and I didn't want the Mckays
to see you turning on the lights.

74
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:37,400
That's very thoughtful.

75
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:49,642
I'm making spaghetti with cream
and butter and cheese.

76
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,850
- And hot pepper?
- Yes.

77
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,679
I had it like that in Little Italy.
I love that place.

78
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:02,186
Believe it or not,
I get treated very well there.

79
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:08,093
I wish I could take you there.

80
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,363
I know.

81
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:19,311
Don, I swear I'm not talking
about our future.

82
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:24,474
- I entered into this with my eyes open.
- I pushed you.

83
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:28,315
What does it matter?

84
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:33,721
Here we are, and I look at your life,

85
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:38,029
and even if I remove myself
from the picture,

86
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:41,459
I see a man who is not happy.

87
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,872
I'm happy now.

88
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:53,603
What?

89
00:06:58,351 --> 00:06:59,409
Okay.

90
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,378
Okay.

91
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:08,421
I'm going to lie down.
Come get me when you want to.

92
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:18,363
Why did I decide to leave surgery?
These last few months have been difficult,

93
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:21,167
but I found a reserve of strength in myself
I didn't know I had,

94
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:25,904
and I realized there are other ways
to heal people besides cutting them open.

95
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:29,980
What experience
have you had with psychiatry?

96
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:34,185
- That's kind of personal.
- Greg, remember what Steve said.

97
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,983
This is a field about
the most intimate details in life.

98
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:38,886
More intimate than their organs?

99
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:41,152
You know, I'm curious
why you won't answer the question.

100
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,751
What is your experience with psychiatry?

101
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:46,627
None personally,
but my dad had a nervous breakdown.

102
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:49,360
- I didn't know that.
- Yeah, no one was buying furniture.

103
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,927
My mom ran away for two weeks
because he wouldn't get a Christmas tree.

104
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,906
A headshrinker got him through,
but we weren't allowed to talk about it.

105
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:57,873
Greg, that's wonderful.

106
00:07:58,344 --> 00:08:00,676
- It was a lot of things, Joanie.
- No.

107
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,806
Answer like that.
This is a talking profession.

108
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:09,081
The way you just were with me right now,
so open, he's gonna love you.

109
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:13,054
The most important thing
about an interview

110
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:16,060
is to express enthusiasm
in a believable way.

111
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:18,353
No self-deprecating humor.

112
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:22,266
You're smart. You're funny.
You're great to be around,

113
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:24,494
but you haven't decided
if they're the right one.

114
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:29,007
- This isn't a beauty pageant.
- Well, I've seen executives crash and burn.

115
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:37,842
I can't believe I never told you that.

116
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,429
I just

117
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,234
wanted more than I thought I would want.

118
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,867
But it'll pass.

119
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:10,605
Actually, I know for a fact it will.

120
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,489
I don't want it to pass.

121
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:27,122
One day I dropped the kids off at school
and I saw you in the yard.

122
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:31,101
I kept wishing you could get in the car
and drive away with me.

123
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:33,861
Just let it go.

124
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:39,477
I'll clear my schedule. We can go to Mystic
or something for the rest of the week.

125
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:41,673
Mystic?

126
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,983
- I can think of someplace if you're serious.
- I am.

127
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,017
Okay.

128
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:04,429
Damn it.

129
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,608
<i>- Hello?
- Roger, it's Joan.</i>

130
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:12,272
- Joan Harris.
- Jesus.

131
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:15,177
You're lucky I answered. Ginger's not in.

132
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:18,375
I know. She has a hair appointment
the last Tuesday of every month.

133
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:21,644
<i>- She does?
- And I know that your lunch canceled.</i>

134
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:23,121
What am I wearing?

135
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:27,691
So, how are things?

136
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:31,524
Mr. Hooker has rearranged
the secretaries in the pool

137
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,958
- alphabetically.
- By cup size?

138
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,302
<i>- Well, I know where you'd be sitting.
- You're making me sorry I called you.</i>

139
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,137
I need a favor. I need help finding work.

140
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:45,072
<i>- Something happen with Dr. Cut-Up?
- Not at all.</i>

141
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:47,372
He's pursuing his dream
of becoming a psychiatrist,

142
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,280
but that means more training and I just
don't want him moonlighting all the time.

143
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:54,751
- Why does it matter?
- It doesn't. None of my business.

144
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:58,346
- Why don't you come back here?
- Roger, I've been replaced,

145
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:01,949
and a secretary makes less money
than if I was working at a department store.

146
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:04,920
I'm so glad you called me.

147
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:08,828
<i>- I'm sorry it had to be for a favor.
- No.</i>

148
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:12,095
I like that you thought of me.
You know, to ask.

149
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:16,598
You want to be on some people's minds.
Some people's you don't.

150
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:20,569
- That's nice.
- So, do you miss it here?

151
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:23,074
Are you asking if I miss you?

152
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:27,244
Well, I guess I am,
because everything else is different.

153
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:30,748
- I should go.
- Well, how do I work this?

154
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:33,188
If I think of anybody.
Just give them your number?

155
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:36,493
Look at you,
figuring things out for yourself.

156
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,923
Bye-bye, Joanie.

157
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:49,431
Look who's here.

158
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:53,308
I'm sorry I missed the funeral.
My grandson was graduating.

159
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:55,178
It was beautiful.

160
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:57,340
Judy fixed lunch.
We don't have to talk right away.

161
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,509
I don't have a lot of time.

162
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:05,648
Betty wants to know
what the house is worth.

163
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:09,524
- I'm a lawyer. I'm not a real estate agent.
- Well, the house was left to both of us,

164
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:12,358
and I don't understand why I shouldn't
be able to buy it away from her

165
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:15,457
- at double what Dad paid for it.
- They bought it in the late '20s.

166
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:18,469
Dad always said
it was the top of the market.

167
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:22,167
Your father intended you
to get as much money for it as you could,

168
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:23,571
if you were going to sell it.

169
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:26,543
Otherwise, somebody
has to buy somebody out.

170
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:31,207
So, basically Dad gave it to Betty
because he knew I didn't have any money.

171
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,677
This is ugly. You know that?

172
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:43,494
Milton, I need to speak to you
in confidence.

173
00:12:57,376 --> 00:13:02,245
I need your advice.
I need complete confidentiality.

174
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:05,874
It's my husband.

175
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:12,286
I just found out some compromising facts.

176
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:19,262
He's been married before, and he...

177
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:25,895
Well, it's not even his real name,
and he bought her a house, his ex-wife.

178
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:30,165
I need to know what to do.

179
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:33,704
I don't know him, Betsy.
I met him at your wedding.

180
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,873
I know your father didn't want him
in the will.

181
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:39,075
- So?
- What do you want to do?

182
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:43,879
You want a divorce? In New York state,
you need to prove adultery. Can you?

183
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:48,619
- Maybe.
- I mean prove it in a court of law.

184
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:53,824
That's hard to do. Unless he wants out,
but you're not gonna get anything.

185
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:55,958
You won't even be able
to buy William out of the house.

186
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:57,933
You'll have to sell it.

187
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:01,099
And he can take the children.

188
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:06,342
That's my legal advice.
You want the rest of it?

189
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,309
- Are you afraid of him?
- No.

190
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,051
Is he a good provider?

191
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:20,555
He is, but that's not the point.

192
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:24,586
It's a lie so big, Milton.

193
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:30,767
I feel like I've been in some dream
since I found out.

194
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:35,337
Just saying it out loud to you...
This is the first time

195
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:39,010
I'm realizing it's true.

196
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:42,407
You have three small children together.

197
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,685
At least go home, give it a try.

198
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:51,815
That's what I'd tell my own daughter.

199
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:55,458
Damn it, Betts! This isn't right!

200
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:06,536
- Look, he waited.
- This is number three.

201
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:11,502
What do you want?

202
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:14,511
I'm going to have one of those lovely wines.

203
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:18,609
Why did you have two? Are you nervous?

204
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:23,015
- She'll have one of those lovely wines.
- Bordeaux.

205
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:27,459
Don wants to call in
a focus group right away.

206
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,626
That's enough business.

207
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:34,562
I want to know everything that's happened
in the last 20 years.

208
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:35,827
Longer.

209
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:39,104
It wasn't until years later that I realized

210
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:42,731
you were the only person
I could remember that time with.

211
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:46,008
What do you want to remember?

212
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:49,672
What I was like at that age.
Paris before the war.

213
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,679
Eating in cemeteries.

214
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:58,350
People were jumping out of windows
and we were on vacation.

215
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,288
I don't remember much.

216
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,955
<i>Are you trying to tell me
when you saw Casablanca</i>

217
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:07,226
- you didn't think about me?
- You mean Peter Lorre?

218
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:13,728
You seemed so happy to see me,
and now you're just being drunk.

219
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:17,538
<i>Look, Annabelle.
We were not in Casablanca.</i>

220
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:22,136
The only similarity
is that you left me for another man.

221
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:25,478
When she gets on the plane at the end?

222
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:28,280
That woman got on the plane with a man
who was going to end World War II,

223
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:31,015
not run her father's dog food company.

224
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:36,349
You were adrift.
You didn't do anything but spend money.

225
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:41,255
You walked around like you were hoping
to be a character in somebody else's novel.

226
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:42,698
The boxing.

227
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:46,129
I'm not gonna sit here
and listen to your reasons.

228
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:49,002
Believe it or not, I still remember them.

229
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:56,006
Jesus, where's the wine?
I don't like the way you're looking at me.

230
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:58,843
- How am I looking at you?
- With pity.

231
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:05,047
I finally found a beautiful, carefree girl,
unconcerned about the future.

232
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:08,191
- I was more serious than you.
- Well, I got mine.

233
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:10,591
I married Mona, joined the firm,

234
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:14,061
and then I got shipped off
to the Pacific for the duration.

235
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:18,535
<i>And when I came home, I went to work
while you were watching Casablanca,</i>

236
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:22,403
and I got blamed when we lost the account.

237
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:26,836
All I heard was my father said
Bert Cooper had a screw loose.

238
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:28,913
Look, you're rich.

239
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:32,846
Let someone else take your horse meat
and slap their label on it.

240
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:34,316
And do what?

241
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:40,452
- I don't want a whole bottle.
- I'll help.

242
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:48,389
And I told him
the closest we ever got to Hemingway

243
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:54,336
was sitting in a chair he once sat in.
And that was the '20s, not the '30s.

244
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:59,307
And then he said he remembered me
because I was the one

245
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:02,107
- who'd introduced him to peanut butter.
- Yeah, I never understood that.

246
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:05,741
They had peanuts in Europe.
No one ever thought of that?

247
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:13,384
- Look at us.
- Will you stop?

248
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:19,822
Roger, do I look like a widow?

249
00:18:23,335 --> 00:18:24,825
You look great.

250
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:29,834
You still want me.

251
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:32,570
So what?

252
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:35,545
I'm married.

253
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:38,715
Newlywed, honeymooning.

254
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:44,511
How could I have missed the window
between Mona and her?

255
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:47,617
There really wasn't much of a window.

256
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,994
- Kind of overlapped.
- I was there first.

257
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:55,222
We'll just take this and tack it onto that.

258
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:58,002
I'm gonna get you a cab.

259
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:02,102
Are you afraid I'll be disappointed?
You were always good drunk.

260
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:05,040
Annabelle, let me get you a cab.

261
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:09,607
It's different with this girl.

262
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,451
I'm sorry.

263
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:21,957
Good night.

264
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:34,703
How'd it go?

265
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:38,707
I screwed up all my answers
and I tried to talk about the articles,

266
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:42,610
but I couldn't remember anything.
I made a fool out of myself.

267
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:46,249
- I am sure that's not true.
- You weren't there.

268
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,911
Stop acting like you know everything.

269
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:53,351
- You'll have other interviews.
- I don't want them.

270
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:56,859
I don't want to be a psychiatrist.
It's not medicine.

271
00:19:58,163 --> 00:20:00,427
I might as well work at a bank.

272
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:05,435
I don't care what you do,
as long as you do something.

273
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:07,204
We need money.

274
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:11,541
I did everything I was supposed to do.
Everything they told me.

275
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:14,009
College, med school.

276
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:17,081
I wanted to be a surgeon
since I was that big.

277
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:18,907
I'm sorry, Greg.

278
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:23,153
- Maybe it's time to move on.
- You don't know!

279
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:26,780
You don't know what it's like
to want something your whole life,

280
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:30,521
and to plan for it,
and to count on it and not get it! Okay?

281
00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:39,433
Holy shit!

282
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:44,442
What the hell?
You're insane, you know that?

283
00:20:57,289 --> 00:21:00,884
Why isn't he wearing a white coat?
He looks like a dog food salesman.

284
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:02,620
Dogs don't like uniforms.

285
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:05,891
<i>Well, we're lucky.
Everyone has an appetite today.</i>

286
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:10,229
<i>They said we should bring them hungry,
but he does seem to like this.</i>

287
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,165
<i>How would you describe
your dog's temperament?</i>

288
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:17,208
<i>She's picky, and she's nervous sometimes,</i>

289
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:20,309
<i>- but she's very smart.
- And yours?</i>

290
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,539
<i>He's independent, you know?</i>

291
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:26,943
<i>He knows what he likes.
He's pretty hard to fool.</i>

292
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:31,188
- My God, they're describing themselves.
- This your first group?

293
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:34,719
<i>What if I told you your dogs
were enjoying Caldecott Farms?</i>

294
00:21:34,826 --> 00:21:36,521
<i>- What's it called?
- I wouldn't like it.</i>

295
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:39,188
<i>- Bingo, stop.
- I've never heard of it.</i>

296
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:41,559
<i>Well, you should.
They make it out of ponies.</i>

297
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:43,965
<i>Goodness gracious, that's this one?</i>

298
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:47,038
<i>This is the first I'm hearing of this.
I wish you would've told me.</i>

299
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:51,303
<i>- When people are protesting, I'm onboard.
- Well, what brand does your dog prefer?</i>

300
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:54,106
<i>- Why would you do this to us?
- It's inhumane.</i>

301
00:21:54,212 --> 00:21:55,736
<i>- Bingo looks sick.
- Turn it off.</i>

302
00:21:55,847 --> 00:21:57,781
<i>- Would you prefer beef...
- Could somebody get that?</i>

303
00:21:57,883 --> 00:22:02,013
- I can't turn it off. It's actually happening.
- Turn off the sound.

304
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:05,953
I already know how people feel.
It's your job to change that.

305
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:10,719
Any agency that does not change the name
is stealing your money.

306
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:13,127
The product is good.
It's high quality, dogs love it,

307
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:16,894
- but the name has been poisoned.
- That name got us where we are.

308
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:20,961
- Do you think that was just luck?
- I'm not saying a new name is easy to find,

309
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:25,032
and we will give you a lot of options,
but it's a label on a can.

310
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:31,442
And it will be true, because it will promise
the quality of the product that's inside.

311
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:34,377
Well, I'm gonna wait it out,

312
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,688
and not for these morons,
but for another agency

313
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:40,280
- to solve my problem.
- Jesus, Annabelle, let it go.

314
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:43,953
The name is done. It's unfair, but it's over.

315
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:51,803
- Annabelle!
- Are you ready for the next group?

316
00:22:59,077 --> 00:23:02,774
- I don't like the way you're speaking to me.
- Everybody out.

317
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:12,490
- Is this about last night?
- I don't even remember last night.

318
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:16,424
Well, you threw yourself at me
and I turned you down.

319
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:19,192
I'm right. You want to hurt me.

320
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:21,660
No. No, I don't.

321
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:26,862
You want to know if it was a great time?
It was.

322
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:32,036
Do you want to know
if you broke my heart? Obviously.

323
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:35,744
Well, it was a mistake.

324
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,784
It's nice to hear,
but it doesn't matter anymore.

325
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:42,353
It does to me.

326
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:45,516
When I was burying this man,

327
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:51,153
all I thought was, I'd have rather
had my heart broken every day by you.

328
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:55,424
You were the one.

329
00:23:57,636 --> 00:23:59,001
You weren't.

330
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:14,183
Well, you're lucky you found her.

331
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:19,112
Goodbye, Roger.

332
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:32,430
I think it's about four hours to Norwich,
but the Norwich Inn might be a little past it,

333
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:35,665
and we can check in till midnight.
We'll be fine.

334
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,948
I'll be right out.

335
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:12,168
Daddy?

336
00:25:16,414 --> 00:25:19,076
- I'll be right back, Salamander.
- Daddy!

337
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:25,283
- I left my hat in the car.
- Get it later.

338
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:28,789
I need to talk to you.

339
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:33,864
- Go upstairs.
- We want to say hi to Daddy.

340
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:35,327
Upstairs.

341
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,904
You're home early.
What did William do now?

342
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:46,705
Not right now, Don.

343
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,048
Why didn't you just call the office?

344
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:53,242
I came home to feed the dog
and change shirts.

345
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:57,447
- I have a client dinner in the city.
- I need to show you something.

346
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,778
- What's going on?
- Open this drawer.

347
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:24,912
Betts, that's my desk.

348
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:29,710
Open the drawer or I will.

349
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:33,982
Fine.

350
00:26:36,995 --> 00:26:39,657
Betty, this is my desk. It's private.

351
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:44,101
Where did you get these?

352
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:48,972
You left them in the pocket
of your bathrobe,

353
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:54,370
but I could have had a locksmith
in here anytime I wanted.

354
00:26:55,513 --> 00:26:59,108
I respected your privacy too long. Open it.

355
00:27:02,153 --> 00:27:03,142
No.

356
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:07,721
You know I know what's in there.

357
00:27:19,337 --> 00:27:20,804
I can explain.

358
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:28,103
You didn't have to look at my things.

359
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,307
Which things, Don?

360
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:35,777
The pictures covered
with other people's names?

361
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:41,490
Is that you? Dick? Is that your name?

362
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:46,495
People change their names, Betts.

363
00:27:47,632 --> 00:27:51,193
- You did.
- I did. I took your name.

364
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:56,303
And so did this Anna woman,
whoever she is.

365
00:27:58,309 --> 00:28:00,971
- I can explain.
- I know. I know you can.

366
00:28:01,746 --> 00:28:04,408
You're a very, very gifted storyteller.

367
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:07,849
Betts, I...

368
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:17,117
I need a drink.

369
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:03,936
Are you thinking of what to say
or are you just looking at that door?

370
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,609
I'm not going anywhere.

371
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:25,285
I'll get you a drink. Just sit down.

372
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:57,759
You bought her a house.

373
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,095
Where do you want me to start?

374
00:30:05,937 --> 00:30:08,667
- What's your name?
- Donald Draper.

375
00:30:12,377 --> 00:30:17,974
- But it used to be Dick Whitman.
- And who's that woman? Your other wife.

376
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:22,444
It wasn't romantic.

377
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:29,090
I ended up married to her
because I ran away to join the army.

378
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:42,736
There was an accident,

379
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:47,107
and this guy was killed and I was injured.

380
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:52,315
But they made a mistake.

381
00:30:55,386 --> 00:30:58,651
And all I had to do was be him
and I could leave Korea.

382
00:30:58,756 --> 00:30:59,916
Be who?

383
00:31:01,392 --> 00:31:04,589
- Donald Draper.
- You took his name?

384
00:31:06,764 --> 00:31:07,788
Yes.

385
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:18,066
Isn't that against the law?

386
00:31:23,147 --> 00:31:24,171
Yes.

387
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:31,215
I found out it was easier to be him

388
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:35,753
than to start over.

389
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:41,594
And it turned out he was married
to that woman, so I took care of her.

390
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:46,737
And then I divorced her
the minute I met you.

391
00:31:46,871 --> 00:31:50,898
You divorced her on Valentine's Day, 1953,

392
00:31:51,876 --> 00:31:55,744
three months before we got married.
Why didn't you tell me?

393
00:31:56,381 --> 00:32:00,147
- Why couldn't you tell me any of this?
- When? The day we met?

394
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:04,015
On our first date? On our wedding night?

395
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:08,891
- Why did you need to know?
- You don't get to ask any questions.

396
00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:17,594
You have a family.

397
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:22,336
No, I don't.

398
00:32:26,144 --> 00:32:30,547
All this time I thought you were
some football hero who hated his father.

399
00:32:30,982 --> 00:32:34,577
I knew you were poor.
I knew you were ashamed of it.

400
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:39,649
And I see how you are with money.
You don't understand it.

401
00:32:41,426 --> 00:32:42,984
I was very poor.

402
00:32:45,596 --> 00:32:48,463
Did you see her
when you were in California?

403
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:52,495
I did.

404
00:32:54,772 --> 00:32:57,332
And she reminded me that I loved you.

405
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:01,643
What would you do if you were me?

406
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:06,847
- Would you love you?
- I was surprised that you ever loved me.

407
00:33:08,186 --> 00:33:10,677
Am I supposed to feel sorry for you?

408
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,185
- I don't know.
- You obviously wanted me to know this

409
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:23,290
or you wouldn't have left your keys, you
wouldn't have kept all of this in my house.

410
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:27,838
Say something.

411
00:33:32,877 --> 00:33:35,072
I didn't think I had a choice.

412
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:41,079
And I don't know what the difference is.

413
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,047
This is our house.

414
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:49,284
- Those are our children.
- Well, there's a big difference.

415
00:33:50,461 --> 00:33:52,429
You lied to me every day.

416
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:59,035
I can't trust you. I don't know who you are.

417
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:02,437
Yes, you do.

418
00:34:11,482 --> 00:34:12,972
We're not done.

419
00:35:17,348 --> 00:35:19,043
Betts, I'm in here.

420
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:27,752
- How is he?
- He kicked his blankets off.

421
00:35:33,397 --> 00:35:34,762
Sit with me.

422
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:03,423
This was my father, Archibald.

423
00:36:06,364 --> 00:36:07,695
But this...

424
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,562
That's not my mother.

425
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:15,537
My mother was a 22-year-old prostitute
who died having me.

426
00:36:20,077 --> 00:36:21,408
This woman,

427
00:36:22,947 --> 00:36:24,812
Abigail, Archie's wife.

428
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,319
She raised me.

429
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:32,589
When I was 10,

430
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:36,883
Arch died and we moved.

431
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:41,963
And Abigail

432
00:36:45,002 --> 00:36:46,594
took up with him.

433
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:49,764
Mack.

434
00:36:51,842 --> 00:36:53,173
Uncle Mack.

435
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,107
He was nice to me.

436
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:04,384
What happened to them?

437
00:37:06,457 --> 00:37:08,049
They're all dead.

438
00:37:10,461 --> 00:37:11,758
Even Adam?

439
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:20,101
The little boy in all the pictures.
I assume he's your brother.

440
00:37:30,147 --> 00:37:32,012
He was my half-brother.

441
00:37:37,054 --> 00:37:38,419
And he died.

442
00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:48,024
He killed himself.

443
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:57,833
He came to me because he wanted help,

444
00:38:03,147 --> 00:38:04,978
and I turned him away.

445
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,778
He didn't even want help, he just...

446
00:38:14,258 --> 00:38:16,920
He just wanted to be a part of my life.

447
00:38:21,365 --> 00:38:23,663
And I couldn't risk all of this.

448
00:38:33,944 --> 00:38:35,502
He hung himself.

449
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:45,317
I'm sorry. I am.

450
00:39:00,905 --> 00:39:04,568
Bob, how are you?
Listen, I've got a favor to ask you.

451
00:39:05,309 --> 00:39:08,540
I know this girl. Actually, you met her once.

452
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:13,609
Joan Holloway. Well, Harris. Redhead?

453
00:39:15,886 --> 00:39:17,786
Yes, she's beautiful.

454
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:20,722
Anyway, she's expensive,
but you're always complaining

455
00:39:20,825 --> 00:39:23,794
about needing someone
to whip your place into shape,

456
00:39:23,894 --> 00:39:25,521
so think about it.

457
00:39:27,565 --> 00:39:30,557
I want to help her out.
She's important to me.

458
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:35,502
Jane's fine. Thanks for asking.

459
00:39:38,275 --> 00:39:40,004
Don't be a stranger.

460
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:03,059
I'm sorry, Joanie.

461
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:08,463
And I'm gonna buy you another vase
to put those in.

462
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:12,064
- I'm gonna buy you a lot of things.
- It's not about buying things.

463
00:40:12,176 --> 00:40:14,736
I know, I know, but I've been an ass,

464
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:18,178
feeling sorry for myself
because I couldn't solve this problem.

465
00:40:18,282 --> 00:40:22,218
And it was so easy, Joanie.
The answer was right in front of me.

466
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:27,981
I joined the army, Joanie.

467
00:40:28,325 --> 00:40:31,385
You're gonna be taken care of.
We're gonna be taken care of.

468
00:40:31,495 --> 00:40:35,192
And the best part is, I get to be a surgeon.
They need them.

469
00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:40,361
- You joined the army?
- I know I should've asked you,

470
00:40:40,471 --> 00:40:42,837
but I'll do six weeks of basic training.
That's it.

471
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,306
I'll do my residency in New York.

472
00:40:45,576 --> 00:40:49,103
- And then what?
- And then I might have to go somewhere.

473
00:40:49,213 --> 00:40:52,148
West Germany, maybe Vietnam,
if that's still going on,

474
00:40:52,249 --> 00:40:56,618
but a lot of docs don't have to go anywhere,
especially if they have families.

475
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:00,121
And I'll go in as a captain.
You know what that means?

476
00:41:00,558 --> 00:41:02,822
You don't have to work anymore.

477
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:07,525
- I don't know what to say.
- Joanie, please tell me

478
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:10,293
this will make you happy,
because it will make me happy

479
00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:12,733
to give you everything you want.

480
00:41:14,405 --> 00:41:16,168
It's wonderful, Greg.

481
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:27,943
And no more soup.
Get your coat. We're going out.

482
00:41:28,085 --> 00:41:30,144
- We should.
- That's my girl.

483
00:43:01,946 --> 00:43:03,777
Do you want something?

484
00:43:06,383 --> 00:43:08,544
Are you gonna have something?

485
00:43:09,453 --> 00:43:12,980
- Daddy, are you going to trick or treat?
- Yes, of course.

486
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:36,541
I'll see you tonight.

487
00:43:39,817 --> 00:43:42,718
- I didn't think you were coming in today.
- I canceled my plans.

488
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:46,847
Do you want me to reschedule your lunch
with Jeff Stansbury at United Fruit?

489
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:48,891
No, I have plenty to do.

490
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:01,298
- Hello?
- I stopped by earlier.

491
00:44:01,572 --> 00:44:04,473
- No one answered.
- I was running all morning.

492
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:10,102
- About last night...
- What happened? Did you get caught?

493
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:18,918
It's more complicated than that.

494
00:44:21,592 --> 00:44:24,561
So, I suppose I'm not going
to see you anymore?

495
00:44:26,797 --> 00:44:29,823
Not right now. No.

496
00:44:37,141 --> 00:44:38,574
Are you okay?

497
00:44:40,944 --> 00:44:43,538
Only you would ask about me right now.

498
00:44:46,283 --> 00:44:48,581
Do I have to worry about my job?

499
00:44:50,287 --> 00:44:51,276
No.

500
00:44:54,058 --> 00:44:55,116
Okay.

501
00:44:58,062 --> 00:44:59,427
I should go.

502
00:45:00,564 --> 00:45:01,758
Goodbye.

503
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:05,291
Goodbye, Suzanne.

504
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:18,272
- He's home! Let's go!
- You'll wake the baby.

505
00:45:27,257 --> 00:45:29,623
- Do I look like a gypsy?
- Yes.

506
00:45:31,095 --> 00:45:32,960
Let's go, let's go!

507
00:45:36,366 --> 00:45:38,493
- Do you want anything?
- No.

508
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:41,438
Should I take the carriage or just carry him?

509
00:45:41,538 --> 00:45:43,267
It's cold out there.

510
00:45:43,974 --> 00:45:46,738
You can stay here with him or I can.

511
00:45:49,213 --> 00:45:50,202
No.

512
00:45:53,217 --> 00:45:54,275
Good.

513
00:45:56,186 --> 00:45:58,017
What's taking so long?

514
00:46:16,707 --> 00:46:19,005
- Trick or treat!
- Trick or treat!

515
00:46:19,576 --> 00:46:21,635
Well, hello there. Look at this.

516
00:46:21,745 --> 00:46:25,203
We've got a gypsy and a hobo.

517
00:46:27,551 --> 00:46:29,815
And who are you supposed to be?
