<i>Previously on</i> Mad Men.

2
00:00:07,597 --> 00:00:09,918
You have any idea how unhappy
I was before I met you.

3
00:00:10,071 --> 00:00:11,621
I was thinking of leaving my wife.

4
00:00:11,785 --> 00:00:13,593
They call a girl like her a lobster,

5
00:00:13,785 --> 00:00:14,903
all the meat's in the tail.

6
00:00:19,024 --> 00:00:22,393
If it is kennedy, nixon will lower
himself to the occasion.

7
00:00:22,624 --> 00:00:23,961
It's going to be kennedy.

8
00:00:24,298 --> 00:00:27,739
My mother used to say,
"you're going to get stout."

9
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,217
Tell me more about that.

10
00:00:29,801 --> 00:00:30,801
I miss her.

11
00:00:31,243 --> 00:00:32,969
I'm living like there's no tomorrow,

12
00:00:33,455 --> 00:00:35,078
because there isn't one.

13
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,225
Season 1 Episode 10
<i>Long Weekend</i>

14
00:01:16,539 --> 00:01:17,959
Running in the house.

15
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:20,452
Grandpa's here, and his aunt Gloria.

16
00:01:22,988 --> 00:01:25,536
If I leave, can you keep
your mouth shut?

18
00:01:35,181 --> 00:01:37,760
Elizabeth, are you hiding
your sugar bowl from me?

20
00:01:38,268 --> 00:01:40,638
Gene, I think I have some packets
from the Howard Johnson.

21
00:01:42,254 --> 00:01:44,744
Daddy, have a saccharin or nothing.

22
00:01:45,778 --> 00:01:47,436
Where is your sugar bowl?

23
00:01:47,696 --> 00:01:50,105
Do you want to wake up with
a cold leg like grandpa herman?

24
00:01:51,163 --> 00:01:53,692
Diabetics don't live long, and
sometimes they lose their legs.

25
00:01:56,541 --> 00:01:57,738
Hey grandpa.

26
00:01:57,923 --> 00:01:58,739
Good morning.

27
00:02:00,351 --> 00:02:02,352
- Good to see you, Gene.
- Don.

28
00:02:04,067 --> 00:02:05,664
This is my friend Gloria.

29
00:02:05,868 --> 00:02:07,324
I heard you might be joining us.

30
00:02:07,514 --> 00:02:09,124
It's good to have another
woman around.

31
00:02:09,277 --> 00:02:10,417
Give betty a break.

32
00:02:10,683 --> 00:02:11,938
I live to serve.

33
00:02:12,161 --> 00:02:13,453
Hey, you heard that, right?

34
00:02:13,852 --> 00:02:15,005
I have a witness.

35
00:02:16,029 --> 00:02:17,716
She's a hell of a sport.

36
00:02:18,126 --> 00:02:20,193
Don, will you help me
with the suitcase?

37
00:02:20,509 --> 00:02:22,388
We're only going for the weekend.

38
00:02:22,641 --> 00:02:24,719
I can't get it out of the closet.

39
00:02:26,527 --> 00:02:28,229
Honestly, it's unseemly.

40
00:02:28,531 --> 00:02:30,081
I can imagine everyone at the club.

41
00:02:30,388 --> 00:02:31,750
Was she waiting at the funeral,

42
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:34,525
unbuttoning her top button like
at some sadie hawkins dance?

43
00:02:34,785 --> 00:02:36,935
She seems like a perfectly nice lady.

44
00:02:38,733 --> 00:02:40,908
What am I supposed to do with this?
Fill it with hay?

45
00:02:41,046 --> 00:02:42,493
How far do you want to go with this?

46
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,418
Oh, I'll say you talked me out of it.

47
00:02:44,721 --> 00:02:46,000
She's a vulture.

48
00:02:47,164 --> 00:02:48,846
Her husband was a failure.

49
00:02:49,665 --> 00:02:52,988
When he died they found out
he cheated on his income taxes.

50
00:02:53,318 --> 00:02:55,080
And her kids, louise never married.

51
00:02:55,247 --> 00:02:58,300
Two more years and she'll be hanging
out at funerals too.

52
00:02:59,102 --> 00:03:01,394
Huntley, he was my brother's age.

53
00:03:01,523 --> 00:03:03,220
- He was always funny.
- Birdy,

54
00:03:04,456 --> 00:03:06,593
your father was married
what, 40 years?

55
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,087
The man can hardly fix himself
a cup of tea, let alone do laundry.

56
00:03:10,445 --> 00:03:12,136
All he needs is a housekeeper.

57
00:03:12,339 --> 00:03:13,689
A housekeeper goes home at night.

58
00:03:15,133 --> 00:03:16,683
Let him have it.

59
00:03:17,961 --> 00:03:19,499
And that fake smile.

60
00:03:20,217 --> 00:03:22,154
You've been looking forward
to the beach.

61
00:03:22,624 --> 00:03:23,566
Let her cook.

62
00:03:23,718 --> 00:03:25,730
Let your father put some stones
by that wall

63
00:03:25,871 --> 00:03:28,419
so we stop getting water
underneath the deck.

64
00:03:28,706 --> 00:03:32,252
I guess I won't have to worry about
talking to her. She never stops.

65
00:03:33,084 --> 00:03:34,877
Just get through today.

66
00:03:35,279 --> 00:03:37,227
I'll be there tomorrow afternoon.

67
00:03:37,641 --> 00:03:39,532
We'll go to that place
with the lobster rolls.

68
00:03:39,783 --> 00:03:40,999
Just come now.

69
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,702
You hate the way I drive.

70
00:03:44,405 --> 00:03:45,970
Well, my father taught me.

71
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:48,491
Half the office has cleared out.

72
00:03:55,561 --> 00:03:57,399
<i>kennedy, kennedy, kennedy, kennedy,</i>

73
00:04:00,363 --> 00:04:02,758
<i>Do you like a man who
answers straight?</i>

74
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:04,739
<i>A man who's always fair?</i>

75
00:04:04,907 --> 00:04:06,907
<i>we'll measure him against the others</i>

76
00:04:07,115 --> 00:04:08,865
<i>and when you compare.</i>

77
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:11,129
Looks like a maple ad.

78
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:12,611
It's incredible.

79
00:04:12,967 --> 00:04:14,449
Happy days are here again.

80
00:04:14,725 --> 00:04:16,428
I'm just wild about Harry.

81
00:04:16,803 --> 00:04:18,752
It's light. It's fun.

82
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:20,850
Doesn't cloud the mind with,

83
00:04:21,727 --> 00:04:22,966
I don't know, issues.

84
00:04:23,313 --> 00:04:24,424
It's catchy.

85
00:04:24,591 --> 00:04:25,917
Catchy like it gets in your head

86
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:27,854
and makes you want to blow
your brains out.

87
00:04:31,301 --> 00:04:33,685
The president is a product.
Don't forget that.

88
00:04:37,821 --> 00:04:41,059
<i>I would like to talk to you for
a moment about dollars and cents.</i>

89
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:43,124
<i>Your dollars and cents.</i>

90
00:04:43,484 --> 00:04:46,198
<i>Now, my opponents want to
increase federal expenditures</i>

91
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:48,700
<i>as much as $18 billion a year.</i>

92
00:04:49,632 --> 00:04:51,328
<i>How will they pay for it?</i>

93
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,152
<i>There are only two ways.</i>

94
00:04:53,384 --> 00:04:54,873
<i>One is to raise your taxes.</i>

95
00:04:55,384 --> 00:04:56,291
Turn it off.

96
00:04:56,556 --> 00:04:57,572
<i>The other--</i>

97
00:05:00,209 --> 00:05:02,640
An ad made by a public
relations team.

98
00:05:03,883 --> 00:05:05,801
Message received and forgotten.

99
00:05:06,384 --> 00:05:09,028
We should give this
to Franz for some music.

100
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,314
Nixon's campaign song
in the key of E.

101
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:15,561
Ethal, go get the ice pick

102
00:05:17,062 --> 00:05:19,857
that nixon guy is on tv again.

103
00:05:20,633 --> 00:05:22,234
Should've never been this close.

104
00:05:24,507 --> 00:05:27,443
I'd say we could run them again, but
I don't think you want to see them.

105
00:05:27,568 --> 00:05:29,012
I've seen them, which reminds me,

106
00:05:29,153 --> 00:05:31,219
you people aren't watching
enough television.

107
00:05:31,447 --> 00:05:33,996
It is your job.
The shows and the ads.

108
00:05:34,385 --> 00:05:36,787
I was just wondering, there must
be any number of people

109
00:05:36,963 --> 00:05:38,834
harvesting mud on
Johnny kennedy right now.

110
00:05:39,094 --> 00:05:40,168
Have we heard anything?

111
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:43,421
We hear things. Nothing useful. He's a
womanizer. That's not gonna hurt him.

112
00:05:44,331 --> 00:05:46,579
Women find out about that
it'll push him up to the top.

113
00:05:46,685 --> 00:05:48,342
Nixon is still ahead in the polls.

114
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,150
Should've never been this close.

115
00:05:51,725 --> 00:05:54,673
Why do we need to attack
when there's a story to tell?

116
00:05:56,774 --> 00:05:58,770
Kennedy, <i>nouveau riche</i>.

117
00:05:59,017 --> 00:06:01,398
Recent immigrant who bought
his way into harvard,

118
00:06:01,658 --> 00:06:03,223
and now he's well bred?

119
00:06:03,687 --> 00:06:04,687
Great.

120
00:06:05,012 --> 00:06:06,891
Nixon is from nothing.

121
00:06:07,507 --> 00:06:10,437
Self-made man.
The abe lincoln of California

122
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:12,398
who was vice President
of the United States

123
00:06:12,551 --> 00:06:14,657
six years after getting out
of the Navy.

124
00:06:15,236 --> 00:06:17,502
Kennedy, I see a silver spoon.
Nixon,

125
00:06:18,935 --> 00:06:20,273
I see myself.

126
00:06:21,022 --> 00:06:24,098
If we were to run a critical ad,
there are obvious benefits.

127
00:06:24,401 --> 00:06:25,769
When you run an ad that's positive

128
00:06:25,871 --> 00:06:27,544
you're only convincing the people
who are already voting for you,

129
00:06:27,647 --> 00:06:28,787
but when you run an ad that's critical

130
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,638
you get a shot at the people
on the fence.

131
00:06:30,732 --> 00:06:32,346
There are a lot of people
on the fence.

132
00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:35,474
Gentlemen, whether the nixon
campaign wants it or not,

133
00:06:35,734 --> 00:06:38,894
we have to produce a spot that aims
a howitzer at kennedy's balls.

134
00:06:40,126 --> 00:06:41,670
I want to hear ideas...

135
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:43,649
after the long weekend.

136
00:06:44,228 --> 00:06:46,482
I agree. Let's go down swinging.

137
00:06:49,524 --> 00:06:51,814
If we can switch to a conversation
about paying clients,

138
00:06:51,962 --> 00:06:55,369
Mencken's is coming in today to sign off
on the roll out, father and daughter.

139
00:06:56,311 --> 00:06:59,368
I get the feeling old Abe Schminken
can kill this whole thing.

140
00:07:00,528 --> 00:07:03,288
Of course, the checks have
cleared already but-

141
00:07:03,887 --> 00:07:06,487
Don, I want you to go in and
ride bareback over Paul here.

142
00:07:06,731 --> 00:07:07,548
Done.

143
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,506
And, Don, I want you
on your best behavior.

144
00:07:15,019 --> 00:07:17,497
- Excuse me?
- I know she bothers you.

145
00:07:31,407 --> 00:07:33,222
Miss Holloway, may I?

146
00:07:37,828 --> 00:07:40,517
I really need to get to
the bottom of that.

147
00:07:42,473 --> 00:07:45,048
Yes, I would like to get
a look at those.

148
00:07:53,286 --> 00:07:55,637
Margaret and Mona are off
to block island for labor day.

149
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:58,652
Gone for the weekend along
with every other wife in town.

150
00:07:58,799 --> 00:08:01,594
We can go anywhere tonight.
We can see a Broadway show

151
00:08:01,882 --> 00:08:05,105
and sit at any table at the colony
with our clothes off if we want to.

152
00:08:05,949 --> 00:08:07,240
How about a movie?

153
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,086
Have you seen <i>The Apartment</i>*?

154
00:08:09,295 --> 00:08:11,236
I went last week with
Mona and Margaret.

155
00:08:11,496 --> 00:08:13,287
I hear Shirley MacLaine is good.

156
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:14,239
Please.

157
00:08:14,431 --> 00:08:16,133
A white elevator operator,

158
00:08:16,474 --> 00:08:18,660
and a girl at that?
I want to work at that place.

159
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:21,038
I bet you do.

160
00:08:21,273 --> 00:08:22,965
The way those men treated
that poor girl,

161
00:08:23,175 --> 00:08:25,042
handing her around like
a tray of canapes.

162
00:08:25,303 --> 00:08:26,752
She tried to commit suicide.

163
00:08:27,842 --> 00:08:29,421
So you saw it, huh?

164
00:08:30,966 --> 00:08:32,892
Red, that's not how it is.

165
00:08:33,393 --> 00:08:36,064
Look, it was crude. That's
the way pictures are now.

166
00:08:36,277 --> 00:08:38,538
Did you see that ridiculous <i>Psycho</i>*?

167
00:08:38,771 --> 00:08:40,933
Hollywood isn't happy unless
things are extreme.

168
00:08:41,342 --> 00:08:43,065
It didn't seem that extreme to me.

169
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,587
Are we actually gonna get
in a fight over a movie?

170
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:48,820
You know, Mona had a dream once
where I hit the dog with a car.

171
00:08:49,178 --> 00:08:50,833
She was mad at me all day,

172
00:08:51,069 --> 00:08:53,476
and I never hit the dog.
We don't even have a dog.

173
00:08:56,852 --> 00:08:58,325
Why don't I call you later?

174
00:09:00,652 --> 00:09:02,538
Call me soon because
we can go anywhere.

175
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,147
The new atrium will make the store
brighter and more vibrant.

176
00:09:06,357 --> 00:09:10,302
The aisles will be wider, spotlighting
these new chrome display cases.

177
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,476
Over here will be a new restaurant.

178
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:13,764
Elegant tea room.

179
00:09:14,006 --> 00:09:16,472
Modern classic signs and
champagne linens.

180
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,507
A tea room, nice,

181
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,306
but 30% of my ground floor

182
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:23,779
is devoted to the restaurant business?

183
00:09:24,031 --> 00:09:26,228
Lunch and shopping,
a day of indulgence.

184
00:09:26,488 --> 00:09:27,730
That's what ladies like.

185
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:30,336
Yes, I saw that in the chapter here.

186
00:09:30,844 --> 00:09:33,207
It's much longer than
the little schedule.

187
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:35,678
It says we have to close our doors

188
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:37,448
while it's getting nailed together.

189
00:09:38,539 --> 00:09:39,716
Three months of construction

190
00:09:39,868 --> 00:09:43,704
during which time we build
enormous anticipation.

191
00:09:44,109 --> 00:09:45,551
It's like a movie premiere.

192
00:09:45,841 --> 00:09:47,238
The new Mencken's.

193
00:09:47,633 --> 00:09:49,543
You will have a line the first day.

194
00:09:49,993 --> 00:09:52,435
Even if you have to pay
people to stand in it.

195
00:09:52,613 --> 00:09:53,714
We'll do whatever it takes.

196
00:09:54,413 --> 00:09:55,424
Mr. Draper,

197
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,016
my daughter's presence here
should let you know

198
00:09:58,192 --> 00:09:59,906
that I am not against change,

199
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:01,889
and let us assume that this is

200
00:10:02,149 --> 00:10:05,809
the most amazing idea in retail
since "Buy one, get one free."

201
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:08,228
I still don't understand

202
00:10:08,488 --> 00:10:11,992
why we have to throw out
the baby with the water.

203
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:15,060
Can't I keep what I have
and just build on it?

204
00:10:16,473 --> 00:10:19,021
Honestly, the unpleasant truth...

205
00:10:19,862 --> 00:10:21,741
Is you don't have anything.

206
00:10:22,851 --> 00:10:25,746
Your customers cannot
be depended on anymore.

207
00:10:26,621 --> 00:10:27,666
Their lives have changed.

208
00:10:28,006 --> 00:10:29,696
They're prosperous.

209
00:10:30,272 --> 00:10:33,055
Over the years they've
developed new tastes.

210
00:10:35,337 --> 00:10:36,465
They're like your daughter.

211
00:10:37,975 --> 00:10:39,999
Educated, sophisticated.

212
00:10:41,101 --> 00:10:43,479
They know full well
what they deserve

213
00:10:44,197 --> 00:10:45,958
and they're willing to pay for it.

214
00:10:46,153 --> 00:10:48,454
Why would I want to own a store

215
00:10:48,654 --> 00:10:50,187
that I wouldn't want to shop in?

216
00:10:50,447 --> 00:10:52,281
Mr. Mencken, I don't know
if that's true.

217
00:10:53,349 --> 00:10:55,791
You had no problem
abandoning that second

218
00:10:55,944 --> 00:10:58,612
floor hosiery store on 7th avenue
for your present location,

219
00:10:59,273 --> 00:11:01,907
and that's a story you'll be proud
to tell your grandchildren.

220
00:11:02,167 --> 00:11:04,245
The only problem is they won't care.

221
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,343
As much as grandpa likes
that marble palace,

222
00:11:09,165 --> 00:11:10,749
I can promise you they won't.

223
00:11:11,476 --> 00:11:13,219
They'll look at it and they'll say,

224
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:16,171
"Grandpa, it must've been hard
back in the olden days."

225
00:11:18,557 --> 00:11:19,754
And it was.

226
00:11:20,477 --> 00:11:22,094
Everybody's jumping to forget it.

227
00:11:22,538 --> 00:11:23,538
Excuse me.

228
00:11:23,913 --> 00:11:27,260
This is not some phony
story you people print

229
00:11:27,413 --> 00:11:28,913
in your fourth of july circulars.

230
00:11:29,067 --> 00:11:31,615
My father actually started
with nothing

231
00:11:32,364 --> 00:11:34,898
and he made it into everything
we're talking about.

232
00:11:35,289 --> 00:11:36,787
Who here can say that?

233
00:11:38,286 --> 00:11:39,862
I meant no disrespect, sir.

234
00:11:40,353 --> 00:11:41,530
None taken.

235
00:11:43,851 --> 00:11:45,242
This is the plan, daddy.

236
00:11:45,724 --> 00:11:47,672
As you can see, it wasn't
just thrown together.

237
00:11:47,836 --> 00:11:50,122
It does seem very well thought out.

238
00:11:50,382 --> 00:11:51,427
It is.

239
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,239
Pleasure to finally meet you.

240
00:11:58,392 --> 00:12:00,858
I hope you two know
what you're doing.

241
00:12:05,472 --> 00:12:08,008
Looks like we both get to keep
our jobs a little while longer.

242
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,391
Don't screw this up.

243
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:11,641
I think he likes me.

244
00:12:11,914 --> 00:12:15,034
I guarantee you there is nothing
about you he likes.

245
00:12:15,421 --> 00:12:16,602
What about you?

246
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:21,219
Daddy, can we?

247
00:12:23,612 --> 00:12:26,326
This place reminds of
a czarist ministry.

248
00:12:26,827 --> 00:12:30,173
No matter what the decision,
you don't feel it was yours.

249
00:12:30,414 --> 00:12:33,320
Fortunately, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

250
00:12:34,727 --> 00:12:36,655
He's very good. persuasive.

251
00:12:37,118 --> 00:12:38,163
Yes.

252
00:12:38,652 --> 00:12:41,118
A little dashing for my taste.

253
00:12:51,539 --> 00:12:52,539
Carol,

254
00:12:52,955 --> 00:12:55,127
it's 10:30. Did we have lunch?

255
00:12:55,287 --> 00:12:56,772
'Cause even I can't leave this early.

256
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,646
No- I need to talk to you.

257
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:00,498
Why aren't you at work?

258
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:04,481
Don't tell me you're late again.
Do you need to see Dr. Emerson?

259
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:07,027
- Good grief, Joan.
- Then what?

260
00:13:07,193 --> 00:13:08,867
You walked 12 blocks in a heat wave,

261
00:13:09,008 --> 00:13:11,412
and I see you didn't take my advice
about the dress heels.

262
00:13:13,274 --> 00:13:16,250
You know how mr. Aldridge has
had me reading the slush pile?

263
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:19,743
Yes, writing the rejection letters.
You told me. It's depressing.

264
00:13:20,374 --> 00:13:22,088
I'm so stupid!

265
00:13:25,321 --> 00:13:27,235
This morning in
the submissions meeting,

266
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:29,889
the editorial director asked
why we haven't responded

267
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:32,224
to this poet from Yale, Marlin Rice.

268
00:13:32,605 --> 00:13:35,205
Mr. Aldridge tells him
we never saw it.

269
00:13:35,667 --> 00:13:37,314
Then the director asks me,

270
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:39,339
and I cover for mr. Aldridge.

271
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:43,068
I said that I had read it
and rejected it.

272
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:46,196
Then they made mr. Aldridge fire me.

273
00:13:46,603 --> 00:13:47,740
Honey, that's awful.

274
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:49,545
He was really sorry about it.

275
00:13:49,793 --> 00:13:52,202
- Of course, that S.O.B. .
- I know.

276
00:13:52,918 --> 00:13:55,795
I'm going to have to ask
my dad for money again.

277
00:13:55,932 --> 00:13:56,832
It's humiliating.

278
00:13:57,315 --> 00:13:59,195
Stop it.
You shouldn't be embarrassed.

279
00:13:59,395 --> 00:14:00,753
There's never enough money.

280
00:14:01,013 --> 00:14:02,809
You always seem to manage.

281
00:14:03,561 --> 00:14:04,465
These men...

282
00:14:05,292 --> 00:14:07,902
Constantly building them up,
and for what?

283
00:14:08,172 --> 00:14:10,220
Dinner. Jewelry. Who cares?

284
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:13,755
We need to go out and shake
all this loneliness.

285
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:17,144
All I want to do is sit
in the movies and cry.

286
00:14:17,417 --> 00:14:18,610
No movies.

287
00:14:18,918 --> 00:14:21,065
Let's look for some
actual bachelors.

288
00:14:21,415 --> 00:14:22,561
Empty their wallets.

289
00:14:23,356 --> 00:14:25,989
- I hate Manhattan sometimes.
- Don't say that.

290
00:14:26,256 --> 00:14:27,935
This city's everything.

291
00:14:33,229 --> 00:14:34,761
Where's howdy dowdy at?

292
00:14:35,603 --> 00:14:36,702
What can I do for ya?

293
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:39,333
I just got off the phone with
Brett Rowley at <i>Dr. Scholl's</i>.

294
00:14:39,734 --> 00:14:43,245
Don't tell me they're coming in again
about the exercise sandals.

295
00:14:43,477 --> 00:14:44,801
Did you tell 'em summer's over?

296
00:14:45,012 --> 00:14:46,832
They're not coming in... ever.

297
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,092
- They're going to the <i>Leo Burnett</i>.
- What?

298
00:14:49,223 --> 00:14:50,242
Why didn't he call me?

299
00:14:50,917 --> 00:14:53,324
Probably because they were
disappointed with the creative.

300
00:14:53,477 --> 00:14:54,991
Rowley called it dull and humorless.

301
00:14:55,602 --> 00:14:57,476
- And what did you say?
- What could I say?

302
00:14:57,736 --> 00:14:59,150
I've never lost an account before,

303
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:01,240
especially one that was here
before I got here.

304
00:15:01,417 --> 00:15:02,731
So you really put up a fight?

305
00:15:03,294 --> 00:15:05,116
He had very strong feelings.

306
00:15:05,606 --> 00:15:07,069
He said some unpleasant things.

307
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,988
Which you don't remember
or I'm sure you'd tell me.

308
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:17,971
The day you sign a client is
the day you start losing them.

309
00:15:21,964 --> 00:15:23,964
Are you going to tell Sterling,
or should I?

310
00:15:24,138 --> 00:15:26,333
Unless you think it can wait
until after the weekend?

311
00:15:26,585 --> 00:15:28,048
I'll take care of it.

312
00:15:41,209 --> 00:15:44,215
Were you buzzing me? My intercom
was making a funny sound.

313
00:15:47,911 --> 00:15:48,891
Leave it.

314
00:15:50,629 --> 00:15:52,156
You wear <i>Dr. Scholl's</i> inserts?

315
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:53,558
I thought we all had to.

316
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:54,990
Take them out.

317
00:15:56,829 --> 00:15:57,870
Get rid of this, please.

318
00:16:09,048 --> 00:16:10,445
We lost <i>Dr. Scholl's</i>.

319
00:16:11,308 --> 00:16:12,313
Where?

320
00:16:13,434 --> 00:16:14,434
<i>Leo Burnett</i>.

321
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:18,152
Campbell enjoyed telling me it was
something to do with creative.

322
00:16:18,856 --> 00:16:21,552
Thought I should tell you. Make
sure the ink is dry on that raise.

323
00:16:21,739 --> 00:16:23,266
That fat piece of shit.

324
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,397
He's a cigarette ash.

325
00:16:26,122 --> 00:16:27,949
Chicago, what a joke.

326
00:16:28,185 --> 00:16:29,190
Small time.

327
00:16:30,058 --> 00:16:31,866
Sorry, maybe you're from there.

328
00:16:33,182 --> 00:16:35,401
I know I didn't drop
the ball on this.

329
00:16:35,818 --> 00:16:36,825
Sales are steady.

330
00:16:37,215 --> 00:16:38,495
Probably didn't help that

331
00:16:38,671 --> 00:16:40,791
our billings crept up
for no apparent reason.

332
00:16:41,558 --> 00:16:44,538
Eventually, an accountant
is gonna read the mail.

333
00:16:46,051 --> 00:16:47,669
If you're trying to cheer me up,
it's working.

334
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:50,877
The day you sign a client is
the day you start losing 'em.

335
00:16:51,248 --> 00:16:52,611
You don't really believe that.

336
00:16:52,794 --> 00:16:54,250
You know what my father used to say?

337
00:16:54,462 --> 00:16:56,446
Being with a client is like
being in a marriage.

338
00:16:56,753 --> 00:16:58,686
Sometimes you get into it
for the wrong reasons

339
00:16:58,863 --> 00:17:00,891
and eventually they hit you
in the face.

340
00:17:04,746 --> 00:17:05,746
Damn it.

341
00:17:06,615 --> 00:17:09,666
Are we supposed to cry about this?
So we lost an account.

342
00:17:09,853 --> 00:17:11,473
That means we'll just
have to cut back.

343
00:17:11,661 --> 00:17:12,778
Let's go fire somebody.

344
00:17:15,874 --> 00:17:17,167
Labor day weekend.

345
00:17:18,087 --> 00:17:19,625
Between now and monday

346
00:17:19,823 --> 00:17:22,121
we have to fall in love
a dozen times.

347
00:17:22,998 --> 00:17:25,241
Betty's at the shore.
I'm headed down tomorrow.

348
00:17:25,437 --> 00:17:26,754
What do we work so hard for?

349
00:17:26,933 --> 00:17:28,859
To have enough money
to buy fabulous vacations

350
00:17:29,058 --> 00:17:30,808
for our family so
we can live it up here.

351
00:17:31,007 --> 00:17:33,215
Give me tonight. You owe me that.

352
00:17:33,687 --> 00:17:35,220
I can use you as bait.

353
00:17:36,434 --> 00:17:38,826
There's a casting call at 4:00.

354
00:17:39,216 --> 00:17:40,989
Double-sided aluminum.

355
00:17:41,558 --> 00:17:43,090
If Freddy Rumson's brain works

356
00:17:43,243 --> 00:17:45,039
the way I think it works,
slow and obvious,

357
00:17:45,221 --> 00:17:47,913
I think we should go down to casting
and see who's on the couch.

358
00:17:48,099 --> 00:17:50,177
Remember, Don, when
God closes the door

359
00:17:50,452 --> 00:17:51,900
he opens a dress.

360
00:17:58,437 --> 00:18:00,321
What do you have there?
Precious cargo?

361
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,152
Mr. Rumson has me trafficking
the <i>Belle Jolie</i> patch.

362
00:18:03,435 --> 00:18:05,025
Aren't you a busy beaver?

363
00:18:05,575 --> 00:18:07,541
Hey, I'm talking to you.

364
00:18:11,216 --> 00:18:14,093
If you want to see the proofs, you'll
have to check with mr. Cosgrove.

365
00:18:14,241 --> 00:18:15,247
It's his account.

366
00:18:15,439 --> 00:18:17,747
Look at you. Minister of protocol.

367
00:18:18,687 --> 00:18:20,512
So, has Draper talked to
Sterling yet?

368
00:18:20,872 --> 00:18:21,969
You'll have to ask him.

369
00:18:22,188 --> 00:18:23,188
I'm asking you.

370
00:18:23,413 --> 00:18:24,962
You should talk to him.

371
00:18:26,012 --> 00:18:27,045
What's wrong with you?

372
00:18:27,748 --> 00:18:28,748
Excuse me?

373
00:18:29,372 --> 00:18:32,232
I'm just trying to do my job and
you're making it very difficult.

374
00:18:32,936 --> 00:18:35,150
Peggy dear, I think I understand
what this is about,

375
00:18:35,336 --> 00:18:37,826
but you're not being
professional right now.

376
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:40,324
I cannot believe
I am in this conversation.

377
00:18:40,937 --> 00:18:42,701
Think this is easy for me?

378
00:18:43,628 --> 00:18:44,859
I don't know.

379
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:49,017
I don't know if you like me
or if you don't like me.

380
00:18:50,185 --> 00:18:52,127
I'm just trying to get along here,

381
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,929
and every time I walk by I wonder

382
00:18:55,971 --> 00:18:57,321
are you going to be nice to me

383
00:18:59,623 --> 00:19:01,595
- or cruel.
- Cruel?

384
00:19:02,626 --> 00:19:05,066
What am I supposed to say?
I'm married.

385
00:19:06,435 --> 00:19:08,645
Yes, I know, and I heard all about how

386
00:19:08,844 --> 00:19:11,230
confusing that can be.

387
00:19:11,605 --> 00:19:13,260
Maybe you need me to lay
on your couch

388
00:19:13,448 --> 00:19:15,109
to clear that up for you again.

389
00:19:17,313 --> 00:19:19,693
That's some imagination you've got.

390
00:19:20,312 --> 00:19:21,932
Good thing you're a writer now.

391
00:19:22,126 --> 00:19:23,704
What do you need me for?

392
00:19:32,775 --> 00:19:33,891
It's incredible.

393
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:35,825
I mean, we're just hanging out
in the art department

394
00:19:35,954 --> 00:19:37,270
and you two wander in.

395
00:19:37,437 --> 00:19:40,019
- We thought it was casting.
- I wish it was.

396
00:19:40,686 --> 00:19:42,205
I'd definitely pick you two.

397
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:45,514
You have such an exquisite look,
the bones of your face.

398
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,251
And your sister, my goodness.

399
00:19:48,961 --> 00:19:50,405
You two look very different

400
00:19:50,602 --> 00:19:52,229
when you pay attention.

401
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,446
I have an older brother.

402
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:56,790
My neighbors growing up had a dairy

403
00:19:57,062 --> 00:19:59,293
and one of the cows gave
birth to two calves

404
00:19:59,502 --> 00:20:01,028
that were attached at the back,

405
00:20:01,278 --> 00:20:03,407
then they cut them apart
but they always

406
00:20:03,667 --> 00:20:05,179
wanted to be together.

407
00:20:05,646 --> 00:20:06,994
Is that what happened to you two?

408
00:20:09,937 --> 00:20:11,790
Do you like ukrainian food?

409
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,751
Let me ask you something, Draper.

410
00:20:14,011 --> 00:20:16,070
Do any of these men have
anything else to do?

411
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:19,006
I just wanted to make sure
the girls were, you know.

412
00:20:19,775 --> 00:20:20,799
Matching?

413
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,375
Exactly.

414
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:30,601
Well, there you have it.

415
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:34,480
Double-sided aluminum as
envisioned by <i>Sterling-Cooper</i>.

416
00:20:41,622 --> 00:20:42,862
Look at you.

417
00:20:43,819 --> 00:20:46,496
- Roger Sterling.
- Eleanor Ames.

418
00:20:49,437 --> 00:20:51,330
What a great God that
made two of you.

419
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,831
What a sweet thing to say.
Mirabelle.

420
00:20:57,312 --> 00:20:58,337
This is Donald Draper.

421
00:20:58,597 --> 00:20:59,983
He's our creative director here.

422
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,003
What a pleasure to meet you.

423
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,468
Well, honestly,

424
00:21:06,677 --> 00:21:08,597
I think we're going to send
everyone else home

425
00:21:09,108 --> 00:21:11,785
and use our authority to say
that you two are

426
00:21:11,996 --> 00:21:14,311
the new faces of Cartwright
double-sided aluminum!

427
00:21:14,571 --> 00:21:15,944
My god. thank you.

428
00:21:16,936 --> 00:21:18,692
I think this calls for a celebration.

429
00:21:18,999 --> 00:21:20,275
Come on upstairs with us.

430
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,544
One drink could be fun.

431
00:21:23,206 --> 00:21:24,186
One last question.

432
00:21:24,499 --> 00:21:25,956
How many birthdays have you had?

433
00:21:26,155 --> 00:21:27,165
Twenty.

434
00:21:28,481 --> 00:21:29,702
How about her?

435
00:21:35,052 --> 00:21:36,989
You're coming, aren't you, Don?

436
00:21:49,748 --> 00:21:51,788
Aren't you two a pair of bookends.

437
00:21:52,865 --> 00:21:53,872
What do you say, Draper?

438
00:21:54,027 --> 00:21:56,729
Shall we cast 'em in bronze and
mount them on the credenza?

439
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,857
Oh, my. Everything he says means
something else too.

440
00:22:02,939 --> 00:22:04,097
Did get warm in here.

441
00:22:04,313 --> 00:22:06,405
They shut the air off at five.
<i>Rochester</i>,

442
00:22:06,665 --> 00:22:08,574
get her an extra ice cube
or something.

443
00:22:13,822 --> 00:22:16,111
Mirabelle, what's
your special talent?

444
00:22:16,466 --> 00:22:18,751
Singing? Dancing?

445
00:22:19,312 --> 00:22:20,610
Baton twirling?

446
00:22:20,859 --> 00:22:22,763
I ride, mostly just dressage.

447
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:25,791
She has a wall full of blue ribbons
back home in Winchester.

448
00:22:26,935 --> 00:22:28,260
I have a few awards myself.

449
00:22:30,311 --> 00:22:32,361
Look at your skin. It's translucent.

450
00:22:34,171 --> 00:22:35,469
It's see through.

451
00:22:36,986 --> 00:22:38,214
Can I touch it?

452
00:22:40,548 --> 00:22:42,081
I don't see why not.

453
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,108
After all, I do work here now.

454
00:22:50,169 --> 00:22:51,362
That tickles.

455
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,966
Soft as a lamb's ear.

456
00:22:55,485 --> 00:22:56,889
You gotta feel this.

457
00:22:57,862 --> 00:22:59,649
I'm talking to you, Eleanor.

458
00:23:09,657 --> 00:23:10,636
Do you love your sister?

459
00:23:11,362 --> 00:23:12,362
Of course.

460
00:23:12,981 --> 00:23:15,557
Why don't you show her how much?
Give her a kiss.

461
00:23:16,075 --> 00:23:17,108
Right now.

462
00:23:22,421 --> 00:23:24,393
Why do people always ask us that?

463
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:27,258
My God, because it's a beautiful thing.

464
00:23:32,116 --> 00:23:33,409
I should be heading home.

465
00:23:33,854 --> 00:23:35,697
Wonder boy, have a great night.

466
00:23:36,038 --> 00:23:37,979
You know what?
I think we should go, too.

467
00:23:38,237 --> 00:23:39,058
Come on.

468
00:23:39,424 --> 00:23:41,037
Nobody's going anywhere.

469
00:23:42,098 --> 00:23:43,210
Do you want to dance?

470
00:23:43,986 --> 00:23:45,087
That's nice.

471
00:23:45,605 --> 00:23:46,650
Dance for us.

472
00:23:49,236 --> 00:23:50,593
I don't dance.

473
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:56,268
Sure you do. look at that.

474
00:23:59,403 --> 00:24:01,789
I feel like I'm stuck somewhere
between <i>Doris Day</i>

475
00:24:02,012 --> 00:24:04,278
in <i>Pillow Talk</i>* and <i>Midnight Lace</i>*,

476
00:24:05,045 --> 00:24:07,901
and what I need to be is <i>Kim Novak</i>
in just about anything.

477
00:24:08,455 --> 00:24:10,445
You're prettier than <i>Kim Novak</i>.

478
00:24:10,673 --> 00:24:11,780
What a rut.

479
00:24:12,487 --> 00:24:14,502
1960, I'm so over you.

480
00:24:15,116 --> 00:24:16,118
Zip.

481
00:24:22,228 --> 00:24:23,459
Shalimar?

482
00:24:24,071 --> 00:24:25,234
Too much?

483
00:24:26,427 --> 00:24:28,285
You never say die, do you?

484
00:24:28,612 --> 00:24:29,612
What's the point?

485
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:35,315
Carol, sweetie, it's not that bad.

486
00:24:36,363 --> 00:24:37,890
Tomorrow's another day.

487
00:24:38,553 --> 00:24:39,553
I know.

488
00:24:39,958 --> 00:24:42,770
- I'm okay actually.
- Good.

489
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:44,855
No water works. Mascara.

490
00:24:45,361 --> 00:24:47,066
I'm just so happy right now.

491
00:24:47,426 --> 00:24:49,026
Okay, are you on the Gilbey's already?

492
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:53,569
No. I just love this, you know,
being with you.

493
00:24:54,353 --> 00:24:56,537
We do know how
to have fun, don't we?

494
00:24:58,673 --> 00:24:59,673
Joan...

495
00:25:03,174 --> 00:25:04,296
I love you.

496
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:07,408
I really do.

497
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:08,754
You.

498
00:25:13,247 --> 00:25:16,476
That first week in college I saw you
walking on the commons

499
00:25:18,378 --> 00:25:19,650
and I thought,

500
00:25:21,386 --> 00:25:22,630
"Who is she?"

501
00:25:25,313 --> 00:25:28,171
Then college was over
and you came here,

502
00:25:29,297 --> 00:25:30,401
and I followed you.

503
00:25:33,314 --> 00:25:34,780
You need a roommate,

504
00:25:36,329 --> 00:25:37,515
I moved in...

505
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:42,223
Just to be near you.

506
00:25:44,986 --> 00:25:47,299
I did everything I could
to be near you,

507
00:25:48,011 --> 00:25:49,314
all with the hope

508
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:51,641
that one day

509
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:54,802
you would notice me.

510
00:25:59,563 --> 00:26:00,563
Joanie.

511
00:26:04,815 --> 00:26:06,548
Think of me as a boy.

512
00:26:16,563 --> 00:26:18,284
You've had a hard day.

513
00:26:20,504 --> 00:26:23,216
Let's go out and try
to forget about it, okay?

514
00:26:26,815 --> 00:26:27,973
Of course.

515
00:26:29,564 --> 00:26:32,208
Good, because I'm starving.

516
00:26:48,258 --> 00:26:50,560
They seem to be having a lot of fun.

517
00:26:51,386 --> 00:26:52,790
Down the road.

518
00:27:06,704 --> 00:27:07,831
Do you got any gum?

519
00:27:10,353 --> 00:27:11,353
No.

520
00:27:12,667 --> 00:27:13,629
No, I don't.

521
00:27:16,581 --> 00:27:18,495
Listen, I should get going.

522
00:27:19,538 --> 00:27:21,088
Over to the left there.

523
00:27:21,478 --> 00:27:23,480
There you go. Don't make me use
my spurs on ya.

524
00:27:23,668 --> 00:27:24,667
Easy.

525
00:27:27,083 --> 00:27:29,009
Right over there by the trough.

526
00:27:38,295 --> 00:27:39,687
I really should go.

527
00:27:43,296 --> 00:27:44,296
Eleanor?

528
00:27:45,112 --> 00:27:46,614
I'll be right outside.

529
00:27:48,234 --> 00:27:49,234
Let her go.

530
00:27:56,171 --> 00:27:57,251
Listen,

531
00:27:58,531 --> 00:28:01,603
- let me call you a car.
- I should wait for my sister.

532
00:28:02,547 --> 00:28:05,764
I mean, I've been around
the block a few times,

533
00:28:05,982 --> 00:28:06,982
but her...

534
00:28:09,048 --> 00:28:12,429
I bet all you're thinking about
is going around the block, huh?

535
00:28:14,351 --> 00:28:17,204
I don't even think I can get out
of the driveway.

536
00:28:18,669 --> 00:28:20,515
Please, just wait with me?

537
00:28:27,076 --> 00:28:29,577
I like your office.
It's really fancy.

538
00:28:30,296 --> 00:28:32,788
Mirabelle, love that name.

539
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:36,296
Listen to that.

540
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:38,589
I haven't heard Margaret laugh
since she was seven.

541
00:28:39,358 --> 00:28:41,612
- Who's Margaret?
- My daughter.

542
00:28:43,295 --> 00:28:46,125
I think I like Mirabelle
better than Margaret.

543
00:28:46,471 --> 00:28:48,855
I wanted to name
her Margo like the wine.

544
00:28:49,245 --> 00:28:50,649
I lost that battle.

545
00:28:51,043 --> 00:28:52,496
I'm sure she would've hated Margo

546
00:28:52,661 --> 00:28:54,363
almost as much as
she hates Margaret.

547
00:28:56,214 --> 00:28:57,787
Why is she so angry?

548
00:28:59,567 --> 00:29:01,862
You're only a little older than her.
You're not angry.

549
00:29:04,244 --> 00:29:05,571
Don't be sad.

550
00:29:08,054 --> 00:29:11,342
I just wish I could talk to
her without her rolling her eyes.

551
00:29:12,492 --> 00:29:15,292
Of course, she's right.
I have nothing to say to her.

552
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,248
I'm sure that's not so.

553
00:29:17,739 --> 00:29:19,387
Girls love their fathers.

554
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:24,520
You have such beautiful skin.
My God. I just want to eat it.

555
00:29:26,235 --> 00:29:27,844
I want to suck your blood
like Dracula.

556
00:29:55,256 --> 00:29:57,604
Aren't you two the sweetest
for walking us up.

557
00:29:57,769 --> 00:29:59,002
You should be roommates.

558
00:29:59,201 --> 00:30:01,303
He seems to be a delightful
young man.

559
00:30:01,612 --> 00:30:03,503
You don't teach at Fort Hermosa?

560
00:30:03,827 --> 00:30:06,035
No. We were just sitting next
to each other at the bar

561
00:30:06,164 --> 00:30:07,550
and it seemed to be working.

562
00:30:07,928 --> 00:30:09,678
Kelly, you know what we need? Ice.

563
00:30:10,454 --> 00:30:12,111
Now where is that Gin hiding?

564
00:30:13,735 --> 00:30:16,714
Just so we're clear about what's
what, the redhead is mine.

565
00:30:17,155 --> 00:30:19,565
So, Franklin, you're into language?

566
00:30:20,146 --> 00:30:21,900
Yes, well, it's kind of
hobby of mine.

567
00:30:22,274 --> 00:30:24,489
I do carpentry.
I'm building a dry sink.

568
00:30:24,685 --> 00:30:25,863
I love language.

569
00:30:26,521 --> 00:30:28,324
Words and their ways.

570
00:30:29,344 --> 00:30:31,325
Well, this is just bad speech.

571
00:30:31,661 --> 00:30:32,995
I collect it.

572
00:30:33,399 --> 00:30:36,123
There's this polish janitor
in our building.

573
00:30:36,588 --> 00:30:38,751
His name is Stash. Stanislov.

574
00:30:39,147 --> 00:30:42,265
He's locked me out of my office
on more than one occasion.

575
00:30:43,218 --> 00:30:45,716
One time, he described his bride

576
00:30:46,857 --> 00:30:50,075
as not speaking real good english.

577
00:30:53,257 --> 00:30:54,596
I cherish that gift.

578
00:30:54,921 --> 00:30:56,835
Put that in a book and sell it.

579
00:30:58,488 --> 00:31:00,433
Well, this is a party, isn't it?

580
00:31:03,764 --> 00:31:04,735
I was wondering

581
00:31:04,995 --> 00:31:08,848
if I could impose on the professor
for one more teeny favor.

582
00:31:10,236 --> 00:31:12,743
I never say no to a beautiful girl.

583
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:16,660
The light fixture in my room is out.
Could you change it for me?

584
00:31:17,544 --> 00:31:19,416
I'm up to that task.

585
00:31:21,624 --> 00:31:23,754
We don't have a lot of men
around here.

586
00:31:27,782 --> 00:31:29,461
It's not that dark.

587
00:31:37,247 --> 00:31:38,996
What are we gonna do?

588
00:31:50,277 --> 00:31:51,956
Whatever you want.

589
00:31:54,169 --> 00:31:55,978
You're married, aren't you?

590
00:31:59,536 --> 00:32:00,757
Yes. Yes, I am.

591
00:32:02,001 --> 00:32:04,628
You kiss like a married man.
Your own way.

592
00:32:05,066 --> 00:32:06,422
No talking you out of it.

593
00:32:07,371 --> 00:32:09,675
- Is that good or bad?
- It's good.

594
00:32:12,052 --> 00:32:14,224
Tell me what to do and I'll do it.

595
00:32:18,439 --> 00:32:20,024
Maybe it's this office,

596
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:23,230
but you are selling too hard.

597
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:27,885
Eleanor! Hello, Ellie!
Where are you?

598
00:32:28,481 --> 00:32:29,737
Something's wrong!

599
00:32:35,468 --> 00:32:36,960
Your friend, something's wrong.

600
00:32:37,139 --> 00:32:39,923
I knew I shouldn't have asked him
to do it a second time.

601
00:32:40,174 --> 00:32:41,174
Oh, jesus.

602
00:32:43,129 --> 00:32:45,383
I feel like there's a tank
on my chest.

603
00:32:48,906 --> 00:32:50,491
Call an ambulance and then leave.

604
00:32:50,676 --> 00:32:51,592
Is he okay?

605
00:32:53,862 --> 00:32:55,306
Leave. Right there.

606
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,139
Mirabelle.

607
00:33:20,702 --> 00:33:21,702
Mona.

608
00:33:22,526 --> 00:33:24,392
Your wife's name is Mona.

609
00:33:56,752 --> 00:33:57,921
How ya doin'?

610
00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:06,128
All these years I thought
it would be the ulcer.

611
00:34:09,504 --> 00:34:11,244
Did everything they told me.

612
00:34:11,477 --> 00:34:12,698
Drank the cream.

613
00:34:13,155 --> 00:34:14,376
Ate the butter.

614
00:34:14,964 --> 00:34:16,655
I get hit with a coronary.

615
00:34:22,376 --> 00:34:24,017
Son-of-a-bitch it hurts.

616
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:27,142
Well, you're talking, that's good.

617
00:34:28,095 --> 00:34:30,253
That's not what the doctors think.

618
00:34:36,156 --> 00:34:37,792
Do you believe in energy?

619
00:34:39,257 --> 00:34:40,513
What do you mean?

620
00:34:41,863 --> 00:34:45,039
Like the thing that
gives you get up and go?

621
00:34:46,145 --> 00:34:46,966
No.

622
00:34:48,157 --> 00:34:50,557
Like human, energy.

623
00:34:54,281 --> 00:34:55,638
I don't know a...

624
00:34:59,657 --> 00:35:00,662
A soul.

625
00:35:02,846 --> 00:35:04,767
What do you want to hear?

626
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,280
Jesus...

627
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:12,545
I've been living the last 20 years
like I'm on shore leave.

628
00:35:12,724 --> 00:35:13,933
What the hell is that about?

629
00:35:14,266 --> 00:35:17,029
It's living, just like you said.

630
00:35:18,595 --> 00:35:19,595
God...

631
00:35:23,906 --> 00:35:24,906
I wish...

632
00:35:25,533 --> 00:35:27,148
I was going somewhere.

633
00:35:38,156 --> 00:35:40,220
He's doing great. Mona.

634
00:35:44,944 --> 00:35:46,036
Mona.

635
00:35:49,534 --> 00:35:51,112
I love you so much, Mona.

636
00:35:51,854 --> 00:35:53,809
- God, I love you so much.
- I know.

637
00:35:54,091 --> 00:35:55,430
Sweetheart, I know.

638
00:36:10,034 --> 00:36:11,602
Listen to me, darling.

639
00:36:14,374 --> 00:36:16,046
Margaret is outside

640
00:36:16,269 --> 00:36:17,311
and she needs to see you.

641
00:36:17,487 --> 00:36:19,535
No. I can't let her
see me like this.

642
00:36:24,595 --> 00:36:25,617
Roger...

643
00:36:28,282 --> 00:36:29,627
I'm getting her.

644
00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:09,265
My goodness! All this from
selling toilet paper.

645
00:37:12,538 --> 00:37:13,807
Mr. Cooper, where is everyone?

646
00:37:13,974 --> 00:37:15,625
My roommate just gave me
the message.

647
00:37:16,507 --> 00:37:17,507
Out.

648
00:37:18,742 --> 00:37:21,419
It's the middle of the night.
I'm not leaving you here.

649
00:37:21,754 --> 00:37:22,835
You should go.

650
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:24,380
Thank you.

651
00:37:26,129 --> 00:37:27,618
Suit yourself.

652
00:37:30,944 --> 00:37:34,166
Miss holloway, Roger Sterling
has suffered a heart attack.

653
00:37:34,881 --> 00:37:35,881
What?

654
00:37:36,691 --> 00:37:39,421
He survived it and
he's currently being hospitalized.

655
00:37:40,878 --> 00:37:43,370
Now we need to immediately
send a telegram

656
00:37:43,565 --> 00:37:45,622
to every one of our clients

657
00:37:45,814 --> 00:37:49,144
assuring them that business
will not be interrupted.

658
00:37:49,378 --> 00:37:51,141
- Of course.
- This is

659
00:37:51,401 --> 00:37:52,727
the master client list,

660
00:37:53,101 --> 00:37:55,645
names, addresses, and
I'll read them out and you

661
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,565
compose the telegram, huh?

662
00:38:00,527 --> 00:38:02,088
"Kyle McElroy.

663
00:38:04,369 --> 00:38:07,245
"President, Alpine Real Estate."

664
00:38:13,754 --> 00:38:15,205
it's me, Bets.

665
00:38:15,567 --> 00:38:16,712
Were you sleeping?

666
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,168
<i>Not really.</i>

667
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:21,118
The kids are in bed with me.

668
00:38:21,378 --> 00:38:22,978
Gloria and my father made such

669
00:38:23,776 --> 00:38:26,254
a big deal about having
separate bedrooms.

670
00:38:26,807 --> 00:38:27,617
<i>Listen,</i>

671
00:38:28,228 --> 00:38:29,680
Roger had a heart attack.

672
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:30,879
What?

673
00:38:33,131 --> 00:38:34,101
Don, that's terrible.

674
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:36,457
<i>Is he going to be okay?</i>

675
00:38:36,754 --> 00:38:39,211
The doctors basically
say they don't know.

676
00:38:40,129 --> 00:38:41,392
Mona's with him.

677
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:43,610
<i>She must be a wreck.</i>

678
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,655
It's good that you're there.

679
00:38:46,498 --> 00:38:47,813
About tomorrow...

680
00:38:48,006 --> 00:38:49,398
<i>No, I understand.</i>

681
00:38:51,221 --> 00:38:52,745
Well, what happened?

682
00:38:54,441 --> 00:38:55,857
He was at work.

683
00:38:57,318 --> 00:38:58,792
He just keeled over.

684
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:01,387
<i>It was awful, actually.</i>

685
00:39:01,691 --> 00:39:05,543
Well, if the kids wouldn't be so
heartbroken I'd come home now.

686
00:39:07,004 --> 00:39:08,606
I don't want to be here.

687
00:39:09,818 --> 00:39:12,839
You should've seen the two
of them in the kitchen tonight.

688
00:39:13,137 --> 00:39:16,310
She was making
some pot roast with a ketchup.

689
00:39:17,381 --> 00:39:18,796
<i>My father started</i>

690
00:39:19,453 --> 00:39:22,942
<i>hovering behind her, watching,
like he used to do with my mother.</i>

691
00:39:24,661 --> 00:39:27,024
How can he pretend
that she never existed?

692
00:39:27,322 --> 00:39:30,152
I still pick up the phone
sometimes to call her.

693
00:39:30,442 --> 00:39:31,787
<i>I don't know, Bets.</i>

694
00:39:35,382 --> 00:39:37,752
I know people say life goes on...

695
00:39:38,506 --> 00:39:39,605
And it does.

696
00:39:41,818 --> 00:39:44,213
But no one tells you
that's not a good thing.

697
00:39:44,942 --> 00:39:46,111
<i>Why is that?</i>

698
00:39:48,193 --> 00:39:49,193
I don't know.

699
00:39:51,817 --> 00:39:53,606
Stop thinking about that.

700
00:39:54,543 --> 00:39:55,447
I can't.

701
00:39:56,962 --> 00:39:57,983
I try.

702
00:40:01,069 --> 00:40:03,099
<i>Do you want me to come up there?</i>

703
00:40:05,817 --> 00:40:07,683
No, there's nothing you can do.

704
00:40:09,694 --> 00:40:11,298
<i>Give mona my love.</i>

705
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:13,534
And, don,

706
00:40:14,546 --> 00:40:16,378
<i>make sure you eat something.</i>

707
00:40:22,633 --> 00:40:23,478
How's he doing?

708
00:40:24,363 --> 00:40:26,319
- Not great.
- What happened?

709
00:40:28,693 --> 00:40:29,768
I don't know.

710
00:40:31,755 --> 00:40:33,815
<i>Public and politician
wants you to believe</i>

711
00:40:34,003 --> 00:40:36,817
<i>that richard nixon is quote,
experienced.</i>

712
00:40:37,943 --> 00:40:39,340
<i>They even want you to believe</i>

713
00:40:39,493 --> 00:40:42,479
<i>that he has actually been making
decisions in the white house.</i>

714
00:40:42,943 --> 00:40:44,977
<i>But listen to the man
who should know best,</i>

715
00:40:45,213 --> 00:40:47,338
<i>the President of the United States.</i>

716
00:40:47,547 --> 00:40:49,472
<i>I just wondered if you could
give us an example</i>

717
00:40:49,574 --> 00:40:51,447
<i>of a major idea of his
that you had adopted</i>

718
00:40:51,707 --> 00:40:53,249
<i>in that role as the decider?</i>

719
00:40:54,983 --> 00:40:58,116
<i>If you give me a week, I might think
of one. I don't remember.</i>

720
00:40:58,374 --> 00:40:59,654
<i>At the same press conference,</i>

721
00:40:59,817 --> 00:41:01,089
<i>President Eisenhower said...</i>

722
00:41:01,243 --> 00:41:03,959
<i>No one can make
a decision except me.</i>

723
00:41:17,222 --> 00:41:19,042
I know it's late-- I'm sorry.

724
00:41:19,819 --> 00:41:21,352
I got the telegram.

725
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,372
Let me in.

726
00:41:27,254 --> 00:41:28,217
Are you okay?

727
00:41:29,756 --> 00:41:30,756
No.

728
00:41:37,696 --> 00:41:39,041
You look terrible.

729
00:41:41,131 --> 00:41:43,320
- Can I get a drink?
- Of course.

730
00:41:52,069 --> 00:41:53,959
Are you happy with the doctors?

731
00:41:55,196 --> 00:41:57,238
I can have my father make a call.

732
00:41:59,556 --> 00:42:00,641
I don't know-- he's rich.

733
00:42:00,907 --> 00:42:02,773
They seem to be taking care of him.

734
00:42:03,010 --> 00:42:04,027
Is he okay?

735
00:42:08,256 --> 00:42:10,317
You can tell me,
I'm not moving the account.

736
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,029
He's gray and weak.

737
00:42:18,444 --> 00:42:19,743
His skin looks like paper.

738
00:42:20,945 --> 00:42:21,945
I'm sorry.

739
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,791
He's your friend, isn't he?

740
00:42:27,257 --> 00:42:28,502
What's the difference?

741
00:42:29,197 --> 00:42:30,671
You don't want to lose him.

742
00:42:36,257 --> 00:42:37,415
Don, don't!

743
00:42:37,757 --> 00:42:39,054
What good is that gonna do?

744
00:42:39,803 --> 00:42:41,932
Is this like some solar eclipse?

745
00:42:42,803 --> 00:42:45,087
It's the end of the world,
just do whatever you want?

746
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,799
- I don't know.
- You do.

747
00:42:47,492 --> 00:42:50,232
You're exhausted.
You need sleep, that's all.

748
00:42:51,114 --> 00:42:52,763
I just need to sit down.

749
00:43:01,364 --> 00:43:02,578
Sit with me.

750
00:43:02,838 --> 00:43:03,746
Why?

751
00:43:04,169 --> 00:43:06,740
Because I feel like you're looking
right through me over there.

752
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:07,804
I'm not.

753
00:43:21,407 --> 00:43:23,450
I don't like feeling like this.

754
00:43:24,564 --> 00:43:25,820
No one does.

755
00:43:31,635 --> 00:43:35,181
I remember the first time
I was a pallbearer.

756
00:43:38,301 --> 00:43:41,354
I'd seen dead bodies before.
I must've been 15-- my aunt.

757
00:43:44,493 --> 00:43:45,850
I remember thinking

758
00:43:48,096 --> 00:43:50,045
"They're letting me carry the box."

759
00:43:50,304 --> 00:43:52,105
"They're letting me be
this close to it."

760
00:43:52,241 --> 00:43:55,134
"No one is hiding anything
from me now."

761
00:43:56,866 --> 00:44:00,491
and then I looked over and
I saw all the old people

762
00:44:02,305 --> 00:44:04,181
waiting together by the grave,

763
00:44:05,741 --> 00:44:07,575
and I remember thinking I...

764
00:44:10,866 --> 00:44:12,783
"I just moved up a notch."

765
00:44:15,181 --> 00:44:17,512
Never heard you talk
that much before.

766
00:44:19,304 --> 00:44:21,689
- Rachel--
- What do you want from me?

767
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:25,470
You know. I know you do.

768
00:44:25,623 --> 00:44:27,243
You know everything about me.

769
00:44:27,367 --> 00:44:28,367
I don't!

770
00:44:36,490 --> 00:44:37,618
You don't want to do this.

771
00:44:37,747 --> 00:44:39,590
You have a wife.
You should go to her.

772
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:40,741
Jesus, Rachel.

773
00:44:42,117 --> 00:44:43,117
This is it.

774
00:44:44,366 --> 00:44:45,628
This is all there is,

775
00:44:45,804 --> 00:44:48,034
and I feel like it's slipping
through my fingers

776
00:44:48,198 --> 00:44:49,936
like a handful of sand.

777
00:44:52,429 --> 00:44:53,429
This is it.

778
00:44:55,867 --> 00:44:56,823
This is all there is.

779
00:44:57,093 --> 00:44:59,784
That's just an excuse
for bad behavior.

780
00:45:01,868 --> 00:45:03,758
You don't really believe that.

781
00:45:28,372 --> 00:45:29,183
No.

782
00:45:29,924 --> 00:45:32,396
Not unless you tell me
you want this.

783
00:45:37,736 --> 00:45:38,976
Yes, please.

784
00:46:00,177 --> 00:46:03,805
Miss Holloway, I know
it's none of my business,

785
00:46:04,736 --> 00:46:06,345
but you could do a lot better.

786
00:46:07,677 --> 00:46:09,069
He's just a friend.

787
00:46:09,483 --> 00:46:11,764
That's not what
I'm talking about, my dear.

788
00:46:12,094 --> 00:46:14,829
Don't waste your youth on age.

789
00:46:22,963 --> 00:46:24,513
Could you-- lobby.

790
00:46:39,303 --> 00:46:40,571
Do you want one?

791
00:46:41,862 --> 00:46:42,862
No.

792
00:46:54,738 --> 00:46:57,418
You told me your mother
died in childbirth.

793
00:46:59,925 --> 00:47:01,235
Mine did too.

794
00:47:04,926 --> 00:47:06,612
She was a prostitute.

795
00:47:11,298 --> 00:47:14,914
I don't know what my father paid her,
but when she died they...

796
00:47:16,863 --> 00:47:18,870
Brought me to him and his wife.

797
00:47:22,553 --> 00:47:24,443
And when I was ten-years-old...

798
00:47:25,678 --> 00:47:26,678
He died.

799
00:47:29,802 --> 00:47:31,485
He was a drunk who got...

800
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:34,058
kicked in the face by a horse.

801
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:44,572
She buried him and took up
with some other man

802
00:47:47,096 --> 00:47:51,008
and I was raised by
those two sorry people.
