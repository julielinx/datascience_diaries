1
00:00:40,907 --> 00:00:42,898
It's smooth, it's brown.

2
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:46,137
Now, Sinatra drinks it.
Why shouldn't you?

3
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:50,341
This bulging?

4
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:51,917
No.

5
00:00:52,018 --> 00:00:54,009
Can you get somebody to clean up
the loose chips on the bar?

6
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,645
It's messy. And if I decide
I want to spill some during the bit,

7
00:00:56,756 --> 00:00:59,384
it's not going to be funny
if there's already some there.

8
00:00:59,492 --> 00:01:00,754
Going again.

9
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,794
Rolling. Sound, speed.

10
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:05,194
"Utz Are Better Than Nuts"
bar scene, take 6.

11
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:07,792
Action.

12
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:12,569
Imagine my horror when
a night on the town turned ugly.

13
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:14,731
This is a nice place for nice people,

14
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:18,208
and the jerk behind the bar,
he throws a bowl of nuts at me.

15
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:19,403
What am I, a squirrel?

16
00:01:20,847 --> 00:01:24,146
Well, lucky for him,
I bring my own wherever I go.

17
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,411
Am I crazy? I don't think so.

18
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:29,283
Just you try and stick your face
into a can of nuts.

19
00:01:31,357 --> 00:01:32,483
Take it from a nut.

20
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:34,150
Utz are better than nuts.

21
00:01:36,896 --> 00:01:38,830
Don't cut. No. I want to do that again.

22
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:42,527
Roll the camera over that way 5 feet
and come in around the lapels.

23
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:46,096
Quiet, please.

24
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:47,833
Still rolling.

25
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,603
Just try sticking your face
into a can of nuts.

26
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,916
Here we are in Lakehurst, New Jersey,

27
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,351
watching as the great airship Hindenburg

28
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:04,616
attempts to tie off its mooring mast and...

29
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:06,851
Oh, my God!
She suddenly burst into flames!

30
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,450
Oh, God! Look at the size of it!

31
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:11,257
It's horrible! Oh, the humanity!

32
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:13,025
Hey, get Sitting Bull on the phone.

33
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,600
We found the last buffalo.

34
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,198
Hey, get a wider lens, right?

35
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:19,566
We want to shoot her in CinemaFat.

36
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:21,731
Hey, Jimmy, what do you say
we take a little break?

37
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:23,308
Open your mouth, sweetheart.

38
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:25,741
I want to see if Gepetto's
building a fire in there.

39
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:28,609
That man is an animal.

40
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,775
Jesus, Jimmy.

41
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:35,320
Just for your information,
this guy's laughing over here.

42
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:53,570
Are you going right home?

43
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:56,907
No.

44
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,341
I have marketing.

45
00:02:58,444 --> 00:03:00,571
I have to pick up Don's watch.

46
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,046
- You bought Don a watch?
- I got it repaired.

47
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:04,776
He was bathing the kids with it.

48
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:06,784
I've been looking for one for Raymond.

49
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:09,753
- We're coming up on 10, you know.
- 10?

50
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:12,689
Poor man has to think of something
for the girl who has everything.

51
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:14,783
Did you make any suggestions?

52
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:16,725
I do love your car.

53
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:18,592
That's not romantic.

54
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:22,134
Did you hear the part
where I said 10 years?

55
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:24,226
I shouldn't be saying that.

56
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:30,003
He looks like a little boy.

57
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:31,371
I guess.

58
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:34,844
He reminds me of Monty Clift
in A Place in the Sun,

59
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:38,406
learning how to ride so he can
worm his way into the upper crust.

60
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:41,146
Somewhere there's a pregnant girl
floating in a lake.

61
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:44,155
I'm from the South.
There are such people.

62
00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:49,959
I think he needs a different horse.

63
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,463
He's on the worst one we have.

64
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:53,623
I apologize.

65
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:56,361
I knew it would be a challenge,
or I would have done it myself.

66
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:58,630
Thank you, Gertie.

67
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:01,571
You have to admit... he is handsome.

68
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:04,666
He's got that going for him.

69
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:06,608
Shall we?

70
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,173
I have to get my purse.

71
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:10,647
No. You're not going anywhere.

72
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,945
We have to meet her.

73
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:15,486
Mrs. Draper, Mrs. Carson,

74
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,453
this is Tara Montague, my fiancée.

75
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:19,388
Sarah Beth Carson.

76
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:20,481
Betty Draper.

77
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,493
You must be the ladies he rides with.

78
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,460
We're among them.

79
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:26,794
Artie, are you the rooster around here?

80
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:28,833
I think they make fun of me.

81
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:32,336
We don't. That would be cruel.

82
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:35,066
Well, I've done plenty of things for him.

83
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:37,734
And I'd love to continue doing so.

84
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:40,676
Pleased to meet you.

85
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:46,208
She's pretty.

86
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:47,786
Very pretty.

87
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:49,548
Prettier than I expected.

88
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:52,090
I think she's about right.

89
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:55,688
I spend too much time here.

90
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,660
I actually dreamt about him.

91
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:59,254
I think it was him,

92
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:01,230
or a version of him that could ride.

93
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:03,825
I'll see you Saturday.

94
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:06,200
No. You'll have him to yourself on Saturday.

95
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,297
Becky has a dance recital.

96
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:10,933
It's so horrible to put
girls that fat in a leotard.

97
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:13,376
Stop. She'll outgrow it.

98
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:14,844
She did.

99
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:25,952
Happy Thursday, Mr. Crane.

100
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:27,117
Thank you.

101
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:29,251
You've never opened
one of these, have you?

102
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:35,595
Hey, Todd.

103
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:39,803
Yes, Mr. Crane?

104
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:41,203
Nothing. Get the door, will you?

105
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:26,674
Damn it.

106
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,928
Whoa.

107
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:48,302
You in the middle of something?

108
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:54,808
We're going to the Oyster Bar.

109
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,973
Yeah. I'm not hungry.

110
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:11,363
Hello.

111
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:13,125
Good. You are home.

112
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:14,529
Never got any better.

113
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:16,124
I almost threw up waiting for our elevator

114
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:18,465
and then just came back
and got undressed.

115
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:20,198
Sorry.

116
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:23,503
But aren't you sweet to call
and check up on me.

117
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:26,269
Harry?

118
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,971
Harry?

119
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:30,378
What's wrong?

120
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:33,077
You told me you wanted me
to tell me if I was upset.

121
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:35,154
What did I do?

122
00:07:35,254 --> 00:07:36,346
Oh, no, honey.

123
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,855
No, it's nothing.

124
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:38,889
You do sound upset.

125
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:40,083
Something is wrong.

126
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:41,558
Harry, do I want to hear this?

127
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:43,856
Would you stop? Let me talk?

128
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,397
Okay. Were you fired?

129
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,396
I accidentally opened
Ken Cosgrove's paycheck.

130
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:52,061
So?

131
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:53,399
What's he gonna care?

132
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:54,871
Tampering with the U.S. Mail?

133
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,498
He makes 300 a week.

134
00:07:56,609 --> 00:08:00,409
What? That mannequin
makes $300 a week?

135
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:01,502
He's not married.

136
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:03,047
We have one on the way.

137
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,174
I hate this place.

138
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:06,410
I should quit.

139
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:07,781
That's your response?

140
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:09,252
The hours you work?

141
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:10,982
Forget about Kenny.

142
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,615
If they have that much money to spend,
they should spend it on you.

143
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:14,784
You're making that place.

144
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:17,692
I don't know about that.

145
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:19,594
What are you worth?

146
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:22,133
You go in there and ask for it.

147
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:23,429
Demand it.

148
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:26,937
Be polite, but think about
what you're worth to them.

149
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,735
No. No, I can't do that.

150
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:32,936
I didn't know this was about
you feeling sorry for yourself.

151
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:34,307
I'm hanging up.

152
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:36,745
Do you know where I can get
a number 10 envelope

153
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,010
with a windowpane
and a green stripe on the side?

154
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:41,586
No.

155
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,348
I need to lay down.

156
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:44,923
Yeah. Right.

157
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,787
Well, feel better.

158
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,872
Do you have a number 10 envelope
with a windowpane?

159
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:38,238
No. Why?

160
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:39,675
Can you make one?

161
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,611
No. Why?

162
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:48,711
Can you fix this one?

163
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:50,379
Make it so it can look unopened?

164
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:52,184
You need a fake passport, too?

165
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:55,488
I got Ken Cosgrove's paycheck by mistake.

166
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:56,584
I opened it.

167
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:58,357
How did that happen?

168
00:09:58,464 --> 00:10:00,125
A mistake.

169
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:02,632
Well, just throw it away.

170
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:04,703
He'll ask for it by the end of the day,

171
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:06,066
and they'll cut him a new one.

172
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:07,298
Don't throw it away here, though.

173
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:08,498
People go through the trash.

174
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,132
Of course.

175
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:13,109
Are you upset about getting caught?

176
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:16,748
Or are you upset about what you saw?

177
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:19,909
I don't know if this
would mean much to you.

178
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:21,680
It's 300 a week before taxes.

179
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:29,021
We're married.

180
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:32,097
I have a baby due in August.

181
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:33,187
You know what Jennifer said?

182
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,426
She thinks that I should just go in
and demand a raise.

183
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:37,161
You told your wife about this?

184
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:40,836
I know. I do that. I keep doing it.

185
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,170
- I didn't know what to do.
- There's nothing you can do.

186
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:45,766
That's why you don't tell your wife.

187
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:47,402
Wish you hadn't told me.

188
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:49,003
I think she's right.

189
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:51,208
But isn't Media a meritocracy?

190
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,306
You think that?

191
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:54,783
What's that supposed to mean, anyway?

192
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:56,047
I have plenty of merit.

193
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,919
Merit defined within reason.

194
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:01,755
As in this place can't run without you?

195
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,261
Well, how the hell do I do that?

196
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:08,356
Then you're worth every
penny they're paying you.

197
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:10,899
Thanks, Sal.

198
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:20,978
Mr. Draper, Mr. Sterling and Ben Cosgrove
are here to see you.

199
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,047
Ken.

200
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:23,410
Bad news.

201
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,916
So bad I don't feel like telling you.
Cosgrove.

202
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,981
We were shooting Jimmy Barrett
for Utz, and...

203
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:32,182
Don't pussyfoot around.
Just tell him.

204
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:34,156
I'm trying to tell him.

205
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,319
- Give me a cigarette.
- Yes, sir.

206
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:37,487
Why don't you get your own?

207
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:39,154
We have a whole storeroom full of Luckys.

208
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:41,028
Because I don't smoke.

209
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:43,966
Mr. And Mrs. Schilling
made a surprise visit to the set,

210
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,095
and they got the full
Jimmy Barrett treatment.

211
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,605
Mr. Rumsen's coming in.

212
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,073
I don't care that you drink, Freddie,

213
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:52,041
- but it's interfering with your job.
- Whoa.

214
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:54,408
Only an idiot would put
Jimmy Barrett in a room with her.

215
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:55,707
No visits.

216
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:57,043
How bad was it?

217
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,345
He called her the Hindenburg.

218
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:03,354
And he said something
about the whale in Pinocchio.

219
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:10,219
Did you laugh in front of the Schillings?

220
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:11,796
Of course not. I was mortified.

221
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,159
You know, my mother's heavyset.

222
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:14,527
I stopped it right away.

223
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:17,534
So what we're dealing with here
is you failed to control Jimmy Barrett,

224
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:19,263
and you failed to control Mr. And Mrs. Utz,

225
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:22,465
so maybe both of you
aren't suited for these tasks.

226
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:25,043
- Mr. Phillips is here.
- Perfect.

227
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:29,910
Utz is gonna lose Jimmy,
and we're going to lose Utz.

228
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:31,915
Oh, God. I miss the '50s.

229
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:35,316
Has anyone tried to save this yet
besides Leopold and Loeb over here?

230
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,888
Can't get the Schillings on the phone.

231
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:38,388
Someone needs to talk to Jimmy.

232
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:41,824
Well, I'm sure he'll feel real bad
about it tonight and give her a call.

233
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:43,861
Don, can you work him over?

234
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:46,056
Jimmy Barrett is a known quantity.

235
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:47,723
Don's going to fix it.

236
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:50,495
He knows what that nut means to Utz
and what Utz means to us.

237
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:51,968
Fix what, exactly?

238
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:54,335
Fix this mess that was made
because Freddie got him drunk.

239
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,307
Come on. Cosgrove should have
told me they were here.

240
00:12:57,409 --> 00:12:58,933
I would have never let her near that set.

241
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:00,705
I did. I told Lois.

242
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:02,440
I took them by here, but you were out.

243
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:11,479
I'm going to talk to the Schillings,

244
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:14,320
then I'm going to explain
the facts of life to Jimmy.

245
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:15,358
That'll work.

246
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,656
A guy like that must know
how to make a charming apology,

247
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:18,991
or he'd be dead.

248
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:28,431
Where were you?

249
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:31,203
At the printer's.

250
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:34,308
You should tell your girl that.

251
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:39,143
Lois.

252
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,747
Close the door.

253
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,950
Sit down.

254
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:52,030
No. Stand.

255
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:54,691
I'd like to find a way not to be cruel,

256
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,200
but I don't think it'd be serving
either one of us.

257
00:13:58,304 --> 00:13:59,396
Are you firing me?

258
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:02,537
Oh, no.

259
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:04,632
It's nice to see that you care
about something.

260
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:07,874
Are you trying to think
of what you can possibly say

261
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,277
to make up for what's happened here?

262
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:10,575
What happened?

263
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:15,449
I think you're not suited for this job.

264
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:18,248
What did I do?

265
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,086
In addition to being incompetent,

266
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,456
you threatened my reputation,
and not just today.

267
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:25,121
Mr. Draper, I try to cover
for you all the time.

268
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:27,665
You do not cover for me.

269
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:29,927
You manage people's expectations.

270
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,261
Can you be more specific?

271
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,464
You really want that?

272
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:37,474
No, I guess not.

273
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:39,203
You're not suited for this job.

274
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:42,371
It's not an insult. It's just the way it is.

275
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:48,386
Stick to the switchboard.

276
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:50,682
Please tell Miss Holloway on your way out.

277
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:52,984
Yes, Mr. Draper.

278
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:04,432
Is there something due
tomorrow I don't know about?

279
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:05,434
No.

280
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:13,643
Already finding ways
not to go home, are we?

281
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:23,386
Edgar Fladen, CBS, please.

282
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,890
- Hello.
- Flatty.

283
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:28,016
Harry Crane. How are you?

284
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:30,322
Still at work, same as you.

285
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,691
How you like it over there?

286
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:35,426
Did Sterling Coo lose
some of its drunken luster?

287
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:36,831
I don't know.

288
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,496
I was thinking maybe I have
to move out to move up.

289
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,539
Well, forget about here.
They're picking us off.

290
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,937
I'm one gone paleface.

291
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:45,067
Well, thought I'd ask.

292
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:46,872
Keep your ear to the ground
for me, will you?

293
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:49,675
- It doesn't have to be there.
- Hey, how about some concern?

294
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,716
I just lost Lever Brothers
and Kimberly Clark

295
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:52,943
from one of my biggest shows.

296
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:55,316
We're lousy with sponsors over here.
What do you need?

297
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:56,718
Don't get excited.

298
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:58,551
Sponsors drop out for a reason.

299
00:15:58,657 --> 00:16:00,056
Not always.

300
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:02,889
Okay. Try this on.

301
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:04,963
The Defenders. Top 20 show.

302
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:06,463
E.G. Marshall, Bob Reed.

303
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:08,430
Lawyers, but, you know, they really care.

304
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:11,435
So the writers turn in this script
about a cannibal.

305
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:13,471
A cannibal lawyer?

306
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:17,740
The director eats up all this time
refusing to do it,

307
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:19,936
like his résumé isn't filled with crap,

308
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:23,412
and surprise, the writers have
only one other script ready...

309
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:25,983
something we threw away last year

310
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:31,216
because they used the word "abortion"
30 times in 51 minutes.

311
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,551
Why?

312
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:35,058
Because they show one, opening scene.

313
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:37,755
Exactly.

314
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:39,922
The whole thing was a ploy
to get us to shoot it.

315
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:41,829
They think they're so clever.

316
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:43,765
I tell you, I miss the blacklist.

317
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:46,597
Send it over. I want to see it.

318
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:47,865
I'm sure.

319
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:49,406
It's going on the air, sponsor or no.

320
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:52,102
I'll watch it with you in the bar
where I'll be working.

321
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:54,145
Send it over.
Let me see what I can do.

322
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:55,304
All right.

323
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,214
Miss Holloway, good morning.

324
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:05,085
I will be taking care of you
while we search for a suitable candidate.

325
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,249
I am really sorry about that.

326
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,418
Did she leave everything
in a condition you can follow?

327
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:12,986
Perhaps if you were involved
in the selection.

328
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:14,292
What can I tell?

329
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,994
I'll just continue looking
for another Miss Olson.

330
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:19,468
No. I want someone
who'll be happy with that job.

331
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:22,199
Well, for the time being, that's me.

332
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:23,604
How about a cup of coffee?

333
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,267
I think I remember how you take it.

334
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:26,344
Sure.

335
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,146
Is Jimmy Barrett shooting today?

336
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:30,875
Yes. At EUE.

337
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:33,775
What time do they start?

338
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,114
They were supposed to start this morning,

339
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,687
but Mr. Barrett's been showing up around 4.

340
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:38,586
Wake me at 3:30.

341
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:41,386
We'll start with your correspondence.

342
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:45,660
Did you go to that office

343
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:48,460
for the purpose of obtaining
an illegal operation?

344
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,501
Yes.

345
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:52,160
Were you pregnant?

346
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:53,636
Yes.

347
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:56,674
Then you went to Dr. Montgomery
for an abortion.

348
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:57,764
Yes.

349
00:17:57,876 --> 00:17:59,605
Was the abortion performed?

350
00:17:59,711 --> 00:18:00,803
Just a moment.

351
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,677
Mr. Preston, aren't you going to object?

352
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:06,273
The witness is not
a qualified medical expert.

353
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:07,852
The defense is willing to concede

354
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:09,784
that an operation was performed
on Miss Stafford,

355
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:12,015
which resulted in the termination
of a pregnancy.

356
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:14,092
Very well. You may proceed.

357
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,563
Come here a lot, do you?

358
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:25,000
Not if everything's running smoothly.

359
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,731
So buy me a drink.

360
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:29,239
I think there's been plenty of drinking here.

361
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:31,036
Jimmy around?

362
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:34,271
He left early. Rehearsal at the Copa.

363
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:35,346
Forgot this.

364
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,005
Isn't that our tuxedo?

365
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,743
He likes it better.

366
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:41,718
Great. So let's go talk to him.

367
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,947
There's no reason for that.

368
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:46,650
Talk to his manager.

369
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:47,884
How can I help you?

370
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:51,589
I'm sorry.

371
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:54,029
In the pitch, you were
introduced as his wife.

372
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:57,500
Would you prefer I pretend to be his sister,
like I did in the old days?

373
00:18:57,603 --> 00:19:01,369
Wife, manager, someone should have
kept a lid on him yesterday.

374
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:04,465
I've seen the man sober.
He's not funny.

375
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:06,544
- Mrs. Barrett...
- Bobbie.

376
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:09,773
He can come in here with vomit
in his pockets for all I care,

377
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:12,510
but these people are his benefactors.

378
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:15,553
Like the Medicis of Florence,

379
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,519
they're patrons of his art.

380
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:19,591
Mr. And Mrs. Utz.

381
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:24,662
I want you to imagine something
that Jimmy obviously can't.

382
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:28,893
The Schillings were very excited
to see their favorite comedian.

383
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:32,061
Then they know that being picked on
by Jimmy Barrett is a compliment.

384
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,968
No one was laughing.

385
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:36,597
That's not what I heard.

386
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,198
I'll tell you what.

387
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,902
They're in the big city for the weekend.

388
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,572
Why don't they just go out
and buy a thicker skin?

389
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:49,354
You are aware that all of this
can go away.

390
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:52,750
No more free tuxedos?

391
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,019
We have a contract.

392
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:58,019
Tell Jimmy I need to talk to him.

393
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:00,030
You?

394
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,233
Jimmy doesn't have a lot
of patience for business

395
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:04,768
or for businessmen.

396
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,896
In fact, I'm pretty sure
he already hates you.

397
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:09,735
Really?

398
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:13,641
Some glib ad man in that suit,

399
00:20:13,745 --> 00:20:16,873
cigarette perfectly in hand,
not a hair out of place,

400
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:19,075
here to tell him he's been a bad boy?

401
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:21,584
Well, he has been.

402
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:23,678
So what do you suggest I do?

403
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,193
Well...

404
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:30,022
he has to know that you're a fan

405
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:33,620
and that he knows more than you

406
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,495
and that he's got a shot with your wife.

407
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:37,466
Girlfriend? Both?

408
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:39,832
Wife.

409
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:43,370
So who's gonna have
a talk with him, you or me?

410
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:45,033
Neither of us.

411
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:46,906
I have to go.

412
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:50,047
Let me drive you over.

413
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:52,816
Give up, will you?

414
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,784
It's raining.

415
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:30,946
What's that?

416
00:21:32,524 --> 00:21:33,786
Hail.

417
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:52,974
I don't want to do this.

418
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:58,309
Doesn't feel that way.

419
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,922
Hi, Daddy.

420
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:14,931
Hi, Daddy.

421
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:16,762
Hey, you.

422
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:17,926
How was work?

423
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:20,971
Fine.

424
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:25,437
Can I ask Daddy?

425
00:22:26,578 --> 00:22:27,909
What do you want?

426
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:34,741
I'm fine.

427
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:38,050
You can ask him, but he's not
gonna disagree with me.

428
00:22:39,157 --> 00:22:40,419
Ask me what?

429
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:44,962
Can we go riding
with Mommy on Saturday?

430
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:49,534
No.

431
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:53,396
There are just gonna be mommies there.

432
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:54,733
I'll need you to watch them.

433
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,570
- It's a couple of hours.
- Okay.

434
00:22:57,676 --> 00:22:59,109
But she promised.

435
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,008
"She"?

436
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:04,311
Not this Saturday. It didn't work out.

437
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:08,616
You can ride me around the den.

438
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,046
I picked up your watch. Good as new.

439
00:23:15,827 --> 00:23:16,794
Open it.

440
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:20,494
I got it monogrammed.

441
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:27,835
Wow, Bets.

442
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:31,333
Thank you.

443
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:19,052
What are you doing?

444
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:20,681
I think she's out of gas.

445
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,020
Thought I'd fill her up.

446
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,561
They feed them in the barn.

447
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:26,961
You're ruining that horse
for whoever has her next.

448
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:28,054
I want it on record.

449
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:30,760
She was ruined when I got to her.

450
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:33,064
Just pull up on the reins.
Straighten her out.

451
00:24:34,573 --> 00:24:36,165
You can't let her do that.

452
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:38,936
You don't for a minute think
you might be hurting her?

453
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:41,842
She needs to be told what to do.
Don't be afraid.

454
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:45,610
I'm not afraid, but I am curious
why I'm riding Nehi

455
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:47,878
and you've got Copenhagen.

456
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:50,045
Some horses have better names.

457
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:53,453
Where's your girl friend, Mrs. Carson?

458
00:24:53,558 --> 00:24:57,221
Her daughter has a ballet recital.

459
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,354
I'm really not afraid, you know?

460
00:24:59,464 --> 00:25:01,295
I've just always been more
comfortable with animals

461
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:03,424
when they were on
the other end of my rifle.

462
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:05,366
That's a terrible attitude.

463
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:09,236
It is, and I've tried to explain it to Tara,
but she won't listen.

464
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:12,572
All the men in her family ride like this.

465
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:16,477
They also don't work,
so maybe I'm wrong about it.

466
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:18,811
I should go warm him up.

467
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:20,077
Tally-ho.

468
00:25:32,597 --> 00:25:33,655
I'll be right back.

469
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:07,129
Hello.

470
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:10,332
Hello. It's Don Draper.

471
00:26:10,435 --> 00:26:11,629
Can you talk?

472
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:14,000
I'm glad you called.

473
00:26:15,106 --> 00:26:17,040
How are you?

474
00:26:17,142 --> 00:26:18,609
Weren't you afraid you'd get Jimmy?

475
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,871
No. I wanted to invite you both to dinner.

476
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:23,106
Monday night.

477
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:25,774
A command performance.

478
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:27,351
I was thinking Lutèce.

479
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:29,818
It will be formal. Can you get him there?

480
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:32,890
I told you. He does whatever I say.

481
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:33,958
Keep it small.

482
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:36,892
My wife, the Schillings, you.

483
00:26:36,995 --> 00:26:40,021
Okay. If that's what you want.

484
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:45,159
What do you want?

485
00:26:46,805 --> 00:26:48,272
So...

486
00:26:50,141 --> 00:26:52,871
it's that kind of phone call, is it?

487
00:26:52,978 --> 00:26:54,138
Where are you?

488
00:26:55,914 --> 00:26:57,541
In my home.

489
00:26:57,649 --> 00:26:59,776
With my children.

490
00:26:59,884 --> 00:27:01,374
Really?

491
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:06,348
I like being bad and then
going home and being good.

492
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:10,294
I'll see you Monday.

493
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,431
Have a wonderful weekend.

494
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,422
Did you have a nice ride?

495
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:46,390
Don't smoke in here. They hate it.

496
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:47,931
I don't know.

497
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:51,002
Place burns down, I could give this up.

498
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:53,593
I assume you're trying to be funny,
but most of the people who ride...

499
00:27:53,705 --> 00:27:54,672
Hold on.

500
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:58,231
Mrs. Draper, I'm so sorry.
That's not what I meant.

501
00:27:58,343 --> 00:27:59,776
Just because you don't know
what you're doing

502
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:01,311
doesn't mean the rest of us are silly.

503
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:03,942
I apologize.

504
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:07,083
Girls and their horses.

505
00:28:08,953 --> 00:28:09,942
I can't figure you out.

506
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:13,422
Why would you want to do that?

507
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:16,016
When Tara came to visit,
I could tell she was jealous.

508
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:20,459
Of your two old lady friends.

509
00:28:20,565 --> 00:28:22,590
She certainly seems like
a girl who has everything.

510
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,032
She does.

511
00:28:24,135 --> 00:28:25,159
When she was at Wellesley,

512
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:27,602
she came for a couple
of weekends to New Haven.

513
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:29,367
I remember those.

514
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:30,771
So exciting.

515
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:34,971
We got into a kind of pattern
where there'd be a warm reunion,

516
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:39,016
a football game, and some kind
of obscure argument.

517
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:42,678
You know, I would soothe
and she would pout.

518
00:28:42,787 --> 00:28:45,915
You know, Mr. Case,
having been married for some time,

519
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:48,185
I can tell you your fiancée
would be very unhappy

520
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:50,261
with you sharing this with a stranger.

521
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:52,259
Arthur.

522
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,463
I don't know why I brought that up.

523
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:01,266
I guess I just remembered going home
with her that first time.

524
00:29:01,372 --> 00:29:04,136
Pulling off the Merritt Parkway
and hitting this long, private road.

525
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:07,837
You know that Scott Fitzgerald story,
A Diamond as Big as the Ritz?

526
00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:09,345
No.

527
00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:13,508
Her house is a slightly smaller version
of my high school.

528
00:29:13,618 --> 00:29:16,212
And I realized why she was
so happy all the time

529
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:19,654
and why she was so angry
when she didn't get what she wanted.

530
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,749
All girls are like that.

531
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,021
- You aren't.
- You don't know that.

532
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:27,857
You are so beautiful.

533
00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:29,661
Thank you.

534
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,360
So different than Tara.

535
00:29:31,469 --> 00:29:33,664
Tara is very beautiful. You know that.

536
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:36,172
She doesn't need anything.

537
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:37,764
What she does need, anyone can get her.

538
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:42,011
You're nervous about getting married.

539
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:44,172
You'll see.

540
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:45,840
You don't know what she'll mean to you.

541
00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:48,250
But I think about you.

542
00:29:49,988 --> 00:29:51,546
Why would you do that?

543
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:56,385
Arthur, I like being around you.

544
00:29:56,494 --> 00:29:57,859
Don't say anything to ruin that.

545
00:30:03,668 --> 00:30:05,795
You're so profoundly sad.

546
00:30:06,838 --> 00:30:07,862
No.

547
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:10,406
It's just my people are Nordic.

548
00:30:12,944 --> 00:30:15,504
Don't do that.

549
00:30:15,613 --> 00:30:18,639
Don't tell me what to do.

550
00:30:24,956 --> 00:30:26,821
You're so profoundly sad.

551
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:31,852
You're wrong.

552
00:30:34,365 --> 00:30:36,060
I'm grateful.

553
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:10,933
Hey.

554
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:12,696
How was it?

555
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:14,533
I'm sorry I'm late.

556
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:16,266
Thank you for watching them.

557
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:17,841
Come in here.

558
00:31:17,942 --> 00:31:19,273
I should get cleaned up.

559
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:20,674
I don't care.

560
00:31:20,778 --> 00:31:22,211
Listen.

561
00:31:22,313 --> 00:31:24,907
How do you feel about
Lutèce Monday night?

562
00:31:28,453 --> 00:31:29,784
Lutèce?

563
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,114
Pleased, I guess.

564
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:35,590
And you get to meet Jimmy Barrett.

565
00:31:39,197 --> 00:31:40,425
Why?

566
00:31:40,531 --> 00:31:41,555
Business.

567
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:45,397
Hunt Schilling from
Utz Potato Chips and wives.

568
00:31:45,503 --> 00:31:48,870
Is this one where I talk or I don't talk?

569
00:31:48,973 --> 00:31:50,770
You need to charm him.

570
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:52,809
I need you to be shiny and bright.

571
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,242
I need a better half.

572
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:56,176
Monday night.

573
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:57,305
You have plans?

574
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:59,679
I'll have to find something to wear.

575
00:31:59,784 --> 00:32:02,048
It's no notice. No notice at all.

576
00:32:02,153 --> 00:32:05,884
Birdie, we'll go there alone another time.

577
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:19,493
What is it?

578
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:22,539
What is it?
What's this got to do with you?

579
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,910
"He helped me," says Sam.

580
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,878
Is this you?

581
00:32:31,983 --> 00:32:33,541
They're writing this about you?

582
00:32:33,651 --> 00:32:36,051
Answer me!
Are you mixed up in this?

583
00:32:36,154 --> 00:32:38,019
- Answer me!
- Mr. Mason.

584
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:40,590
You keep out of this!

585
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:42,660
Sandra Mason.

586
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,557
I was reading about this.

587
00:32:44,662 --> 00:32:47,426
I was thanking God that my daughter

588
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:49,397
wasn't the kind of a girl that was...

589
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,367
would be mixed up
in anything ugly like this.

590
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,335
Please, Daddy, don't.

591
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:58,273
I was even feeling sorry for the parents
of the girls who were involved.

592
00:32:58,376 --> 00:33:00,105
- Please. Please.
- Please?

593
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:02,372
18 years old!

594
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,913
You have to have an illegitimate child

595
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:07,280
taken away from you by some filthy doctor!

596
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:08,784
Mr. Mason!

597
00:33:08,886 --> 00:33:11,377
You get out of my house!

598
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:14,856
I do want to see the rest of this,
but I get the idea.

599
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:16,586
Then behave as though you...

600
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:22,763
Top 20 show, prime time,
for pennies on the dollar.

601
00:33:22,867 --> 00:33:25,233
And it's the perfect match
for Belle Jolie lipstick.

602
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:27,804
Really? How does that work?

603
00:33:27,905 --> 00:33:30,373
Controversy means viewers.

604
00:33:30,475 --> 00:33:33,342
Women will find a way to watch this.

605
00:33:33,444 --> 00:33:35,241
Maybe just because
they don't want to get left out.

606
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:36,643
Is that true?

607
00:33:39,217 --> 00:33:41,742
There's no doubt in my mind.

608
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,445
We can talk to them
about putting on a warning.

609
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:46,921
Research shows rules
are made to be broken.

610
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:49,118
Thanks, Ken. He has the research.

611
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:51,354
This discussion, it's uncomfortable.

612
00:33:51,462 --> 00:33:52,724
This show is troubling.

613
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:56,766
It's catharsis. That's hard to come by.

614
00:33:56,868 --> 00:34:00,998
What is better than tears to make a girl
ready to hear she can be beautiful?

615
00:34:01,105 --> 00:34:02,936
I'd love to see a spike.

616
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:06,602
But what do I do when Hugh Brody
asks what the hell this is?

617
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:09,009
Belle Jolie is a family company.

618
00:34:09,113 --> 00:34:10,978
This is not wholesome.

619
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:14,074
There are limits to what
you can get out of daytime.

620
00:34:14,185 --> 00:34:17,177
I don't want Belle Jolie
to be part of this debate.

621
00:34:17,288 --> 00:34:20,189
So you think girls who buy lipstick
aren't gonna be interested in this?

622
00:34:21,426 --> 00:34:23,860
I don't care where they stand.
So it's political.

623
00:34:23,961 --> 00:34:26,555
Politics are in.
Women will be watching.

624
00:34:26,664 --> 00:34:28,359
Young women.

625
00:34:28,466 --> 00:34:29,694
I'm sorry.

626
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:34,538
Well, we thought you should know about it.

627
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:40,868
I have to say I'm very impressed
you brought this to us.

628
00:34:40,978 --> 00:34:42,502
I wish we were
a different kind of company.

629
00:34:42,613 --> 00:34:44,513
We all work for someone.

630
00:34:47,218 --> 00:34:49,186
It was a pleasure.

631
00:34:50,721 --> 00:34:52,484
How's it going?

632
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,557
Very well, thank you.

633
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,036
You said you wanted to see me?

634
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:12,700
Yes, I did.

635
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,368
You're Harry Crane, right?

636
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:15,776
Yes, I am.

637
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,906
Certain things have come to my attention.

638
00:35:19,016 --> 00:35:20,415
Oh, no.

639
00:35:20,518 --> 00:35:22,884
I heard about it third-hand,
and I thought it sounded reckless,

640
00:35:22,987 --> 00:35:24,511
so I talked to Mr. Cooper.

641
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:26,214
Mr. Cooper knows about this?

642
00:35:26,324 --> 00:35:27,916
I think someone told on you.

643
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:30,016
And it backfired.

644
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,925
- Mitch.
- Doesn't matter.

645
00:35:32,029 --> 00:35:33,997
Cooper thought it showed initiative.

646
00:35:34,098 --> 00:35:35,929
So you're in here now.

647
00:35:36,033 --> 00:35:37,091
I'm smiling. What do you want?

648
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:42,973
Well...

649
00:35:43,074 --> 00:35:45,099
I guess, for one thing,

650
00:35:45,209 --> 00:35:46,836
I think that we should have
a television department.

651
00:35:46,944 --> 00:35:49,003
All the other agencies have them.

652
00:35:49,113 --> 00:35:50,546
And I think I should run it.

653
00:35:52,383 --> 00:35:54,112
You're now the head
of the Television Department,

654
00:35:54,218 --> 00:35:55,446
which is comprised solely of you.

655
00:35:55,553 --> 00:35:57,020
Anything else?

656
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:00,684
Well, actually...

657
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:02,281
I think I deserve a raise.

658
00:36:13,137 --> 00:36:15,105
And I think...

659
00:36:15,206 --> 00:36:17,572
you've already received a sizable reward.

660
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:19,404
Let's not get greedy.

661
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,499
I'm not being greedy.

662
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:22,511
Are you arguing with me?

663
00:36:24,248 --> 00:36:25,647
How much do you make?

664
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:28,116
- $200 a week.
- Plus drinks.

665
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:31,712
Give me a number.

666
00:36:34,225 --> 00:36:35,624
How about 310?

667
00:36:35,726 --> 00:36:38,456
No one makes that around here.
Not even close.

668
00:36:38,563 --> 00:36:40,793
How about two and a quarter? Say yes.

669
00:36:42,066 --> 00:36:43,624
Yes.

670
00:36:43,734 --> 00:36:44,826
I'll throw in new business cards.

671
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:46,494
You drive a hell of a bargain.

672
00:36:57,415 --> 00:36:59,940
So I finally told them
that we really enjoyed visiting,

673
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:02,110
but we'd rather stay in a hotel.

674
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,688
Made my daughter-in-law happier.

675
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:08,122
Luckily, we're a long way
from those problems.

676
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,660
Although, I do love the idea
of Bobby and Sally

677
00:37:10,761 --> 00:37:13,093
having apartments and families.

678
00:37:14,532 --> 00:37:15,521
Where is he?

679
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,626
Who?

680
00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:21,966
Jimmy Barrett.

681
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:24,837
I...

682
00:37:24,942 --> 00:37:26,739
No, Hunt.

683
00:37:26,844 --> 00:37:28,641
I don't think that would be a good idea.

684
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:30,213
Edith, please.

685
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:33,542
He wants to apologize.

686
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,720
Oh, dear.

687
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:40,290
Well, he certainly picked a nice place.

688
00:37:43,227 --> 00:37:44,854
Hello, everybody.
Sorry we're late,

689
00:37:44,962 --> 00:37:46,793
but one of us likes to make an entrance.

690
00:37:46,897 --> 00:37:48,797
Hello. Bobbie Barrett.

691
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:50,457
Pleasure.

692
00:37:50,568 --> 00:37:52,729
- We've met before.
- I remember.

693
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:54,031
Mr. Draper.

694
00:37:55,172 --> 00:37:57,037
This is my wife Betty.

695
00:37:57,141 --> 00:37:59,439
Betty, this is Bobbie and Jimmy Barrett.

696
00:38:01,646 --> 00:38:03,477
Oh, my. I am such a fan.

697
00:38:03,581 --> 00:38:05,708
You know, when you imagine
someone saying that to you,

698
00:38:05,816 --> 00:38:08,341
you always hope it's her.

699
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:10,852
And this one. My God.
Are you two sold separately?

700
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,183
Look, it's JFK.

701
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,622
And you're not Jackie,
but you're definitely his type.

702
00:38:14,725 --> 00:38:15,851
I've met him.

703
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,949
Nice to see you again, Jimmy.

704
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:19,052
You remember Hunt and Edith Schilling.

705
00:38:19,163 --> 00:38:20,892
How could I forget?
They bought me a car.

706
00:38:20,998 --> 00:38:22,124
A pleasure as always.

707
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:24,292
And the little lady.
Look at you, all dolled up.

708
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:31,334
So, what do you do, sweetheart?

709
00:38:31,442 --> 00:38:33,535
I want to know everything.

710
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:35,009
I'm a housewife.

711
00:38:35,112 --> 00:38:37,273
I bet little birds hang up your laundry.

712
00:38:37,381 --> 00:38:39,941
And we have a little boy and a little girl.

713
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:42,417
Is that everything? Or you want
to let my imagination run wild?

714
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,579
By the way, I loved you
in Gentleman's Agreement.

715
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:47,487
Good evening, mesdames et messieurs.

716
00:38:47,591 --> 00:38:50,560
The chef has prepared many spécialités

717
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:51,889
which I will have the pleasure of...

718
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:52,963
Just a minute, Monsieur Le Pew.

719
00:38:53,064 --> 00:38:54,497
Any chance we can get a drink order filled?

720
00:38:54,598 --> 00:38:56,429
Sorry, everybody,
but Jimmy's down a quart.

721
00:38:56,534 --> 00:38:58,832
Two Johnnie Walkers, rocks.
Bobbie, you want anything?

722
00:38:58,936 --> 00:39:00,699
Dubonnet with a twist.

723
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:03,236
And make it fast,
while this place is still French.

724
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:08,008
I hope you all like spit in your food.

725
00:39:08,112 --> 00:39:10,046
Come on. I come here all the time.

726
00:39:10,147 --> 00:39:13,514
Now, I have a few key
questions for Mrs. America.

727
00:39:13,617 --> 00:39:16,518
Remember, Betsy,
everything's riding on this.

728
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,588
So really, what fills your days?

729
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:20,088
Eating bonbons?

730
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,749
Hitting tennis balls with the needy?

731
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:25,722
Actually, I spend a lot
of my time riding horses.

732
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:27,457
It's really a passion for me.

733
00:39:27,565 --> 00:39:28,930
And for them, I bet.

734
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,797
So, big horses?
Give me an education.

735
00:39:31,902 --> 00:39:34,370
- You don't want to hear about this.
- No, I do.

736
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:36,804
Is it the beauty pageant thing
where they walk in little bitty steps?

737
00:39:36,907 --> 00:39:38,534
I'll be right back.

738
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,637
No. That's dressage.

739
00:39:42,747 --> 00:39:43,805
I knew that.

740
00:39:43,914 --> 00:39:46,508
It's the same kind of saddle,
but I do jumping.

741
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:48,878
You two do any jumping?

742
00:39:48,986 --> 00:39:49,975
I'm sorry.

743
00:39:50,087 --> 00:39:52,112
Can you excuse me a moment?

744
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,555
All this talk about horses?

745
00:40:02,366 --> 00:40:03,958
What, are you expecting a Chinese baby?

746
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:05,194
I don't know what it is,

747
00:40:05,302 --> 00:40:08,931
but one thing I know is it's not Chinese.

748
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:10,870
We're both very proud of you.

749
00:40:10,975 --> 00:40:12,203
Well, good.

750
00:40:12,309 --> 00:40:14,539
Because a 121/2% raise
is nothing to sneeze at.

751
00:40:14,645 --> 00:40:17,205
I don't care about the money.

752
00:40:17,314 --> 00:40:21,216
Well... the money's nice.

753
00:40:21,318 --> 00:40:24,310
I just can't wait to go
into the phone company tomorrow

754
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,083
and tell the girls that my husband

755
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:28,624
is the head of television
at Sterling Cooper.

756
00:40:28,726 --> 00:40:30,216
Do you feel well enough to go in?

757
00:40:30,327 --> 00:40:32,022
Because you don't have to.

758
00:40:32,129 --> 00:40:33,528
You're sweet.

759
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:39,102
What did you do?

760
00:40:39,203 --> 00:40:43,367
Well, I took this TV show
that no one wanted to sponsor,

761
00:40:43,474 --> 00:40:45,237
and I told one of our clients about it.

762
00:40:45,342 --> 00:40:46,775
And you sold it?

763
00:40:46,877 --> 00:40:51,473
No, but everyone was impressed
that I recognized the opportunity.

764
00:40:51,582 --> 00:40:53,311
What's the show?

765
00:40:53,417 --> 00:40:55,146
Just some show.

766
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:01,180
You wouldn't like it.

767
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:13,994
You look great.

768
00:41:14,104 --> 00:41:15,867
Do I?

769
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:17,497
I'm not feeling great.

770
00:41:17,608 --> 00:41:19,439
Why not?

771
00:41:19,543 --> 00:41:21,135
I'm gonna be brief

772
00:41:21,245 --> 00:41:23,543
because I don't like
leaving him alone out there.

773
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:25,114
They're loving it.

774
00:41:25,216 --> 00:41:27,946
They're being polite.

775
00:41:28,052 --> 00:41:31,317
The window for this apology is closing.

776
00:41:31,422 --> 00:41:34,585
It needs to happen before the appetizers,
or they will leave.

777
00:41:34,692 --> 00:41:36,853
Really?

778
00:41:36,961 --> 00:41:39,361
Because I was thinking about that,

779
00:41:39,463 --> 00:41:41,954
so I took a look at Jimmy's contract...

780
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:44,364
well, me and a lawyer...

781
00:41:44,468 --> 00:41:48,029
and I realized Jimmy doesn't
have to apologize at all.

782
00:41:48,138 --> 00:41:52,768
In fact, they're gonna have to pay him,
even if they fire him,

783
00:41:52,877 --> 00:41:56,040
especially because hurt feelings
isn't a very good reason.

784
00:41:57,748 --> 00:42:00,080
So what is this all about?

785
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:04,883
I think an apology,
and a public one like this one,

786
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:07,753
has to be worth $25,000.

787
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:09,621
And I want it in the paper.

788
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:12,218
Say it's a bonus.

789
00:42:25,242 --> 00:42:29,611
Believe me, I will ruin him.

790
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:35,077
Do what I say.

791
00:42:51,802 --> 00:42:54,430
- Don't get up.
- I wasn't gonna.

792
00:42:54,538 --> 00:42:56,768
But this one knows about horses.
Who knows?

793
00:42:56,874 --> 00:42:59,274
I've been spending the whole time
watching her lips move.

794
00:43:07,818 --> 00:43:10,378
Well, I hope we haven't ordered yet
because there really is something

795
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:12,148
that we need to get out of the way.

796
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:13,587
He's picking up the check.

797
00:43:13,691 --> 00:43:15,249
I mean, there's really no debate, is there?

798
00:43:18,395 --> 00:43:19,726
Mr. And Mrs. Schilling,

799
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:22,492
Jimmy has something
that he'd like to say to you.

800
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:34,567
Honestly, I'd rather eat your chips
than anything in this dump.

801
00:43:34,678 --> 00:43:36,043
They have snails here, you know.

802
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:39,915
That's nice to hear.

803
00:43:40,017 --> 00:43:42,815
Mrs. Schilling... Edith...

804
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,444
I was out of line the other day.

805
00:43:44,555 --> 00:43:47,251
I shouldn't have said it to you,
and not just 'cause you're married to him.

806
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:49,826
I shouldn't have said it to anybody,
not in that environment.

807
00:43:49,927 --> 00:43:52,088
Sweetheart, look at me.

808
00:43:52,196 --> 00:43:54,892
You, too, Hunt. Can I call you Hunt?

809
00:43:54,999 --> 00:43:57,263
There's the guy under the lights,
and there's me.

810
00:43:57,368 --> 00:44:01,065
He's made me rich,
but he hasn't made me very nice.

811
00:44:01,171 --> 00:44:03,662
I hope we can put it behind us.

812
00:44:05,275 --> 00:44:06,936
I know that's what you do.

813
00:44:07,044 --> 00:44:09,410
I guess I just don't have the stomach for it.

814
00:44:15,085 --> 00:44:17,679
Well, I'm famished.

815
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:26,463
Excuse me.

816
00:44:56,326 --> 00:44:57,816
Bets, you all right?

817
00:44:59,663 --> 00:45:00,630
Yes.

818
00:45:03,434 --> 00:45:05,026
What's wrong?

819
00:45:05,135 --> 00:45:06,898
Nothing.

820
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:09,502
Nothing's wrong.

821
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:13,904
I'm just so happy.

822
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:24,219
When I said I wanted to be
a part of your life...

823
00:45:26,156 --> 00:45:27,817
this is what I meant.

824
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:36,294
We make a great team.

825
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:08,898
