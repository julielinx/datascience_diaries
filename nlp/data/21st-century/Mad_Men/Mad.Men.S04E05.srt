Doctors must love that

00:00:09,683 --> 00:00:11,048
Jai Alai is leaving.

00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,529
- What?
- It's over.

7
00:00:12,624 --> 00:00:15,175
Debbie. In your
dorm, I know.

8
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,967
He's dad! And he's never
coming back! And nobody cares!

9
00:00:20,087 --> 00:00:20,608
Stop it.

10
00:00:20,831 --> 00:00:24,088
Look, Pete, we're gonna
resign the Clearasil account.

11
00:00:24,223 --> 00:00:25,528
<i>I hate it here.</i>

Smokers and cold sufferers,

22
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:48,598
You said not to buzz you

23

But I don't know
how else to do this.

24
00:01:50,334 --> 00:01:53,169
- You have a phone call.
- You can buzz me
for a phone call.

25
00:01:53,237 --> 00:01:55,138
Things like coffee
after I've said no,

26
00:01:55,206 --> 00:01:57,140
You don't have to ask again.

30
00:02:06,784 --> 00:02:08,985

I know who you are.
What can I do for you, Walter?

35
00:02:23,868 --> 00:02:25,401
I just wanted to know
if you'd heard

36
00:02:25,469 --> 00:02:27,370
That cutler, Gleason & Chaough
just signed clearasil.

37
00:02:30,474 --> 00:02:32,775
I don't keep track of accounts
once we resign them.

38
00:02:32,843 --> 00:02:35,578
I just think it's
kind of interesting
that first c.G.C.

39
00:02:35,646 --> 00:02:37,847
Takes the jai alai
association from you
and now this.

40

<i>- How do you explain it?
- I don't think about it.</i>

41
00:02:40,384 --> 00:02:43,052
Well, I talked to Ted Chaough

42
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,722
<i>And he said, "every time
don draper looks in his

- What's your point?
- Do you
have a response?

46
00:02:51,996 --> 00:02:54,564
- On the record?
- Please.

47
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:56,699
I've never heard of him.

48
00:02:56,767 --> 00:02:58,635

You still don't think
they need a civil rights law?

52
00:03:13,317 --> 00:03:15,451
They got what they wanted.
Why aren't they happy?

53
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,087
Because Lassie
stays at the Waldorf
and they can't.

54
00:03:18,155 --> 00:03:20,056
Please tell me
I missed everything.

55

00:03:34,872 --> 00:03:36,606
How'd you ease them into it?

62
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:39,075
Must've had to
loosen them up first.

63
00:03:39,143 --> 00:03:42,345
We've had that client
for 18 years, Roger.

64
00:03:42,413 --> 00:03:44,647
Pete has other news.

65
00:03:44,715 --> 00:03:47,984
A deerfield chum of mine
roped me into a dinner
for the Asia society,

66
00:03:48,052 --> 00:03:49,652
The result of which
was a series

67
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,988
Of interesting phone calls
and one lunch

68
00:03:52,056 --> 00:03:53,823
Regarding the Honda
motorcycle company.

69
00:03:53,891 --> 00:03:55,692
They control over 50%
of the U.S. Market.

70
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:58,061
I've seen them.
They're cute.

71
00:03:58,128 --> 00:04:00,196
They're miserable at Grey.

72
00:04:00,264 --> 00:04:02,398
Well, 50% of the market?
Who wouldn't be?

73
00:04:02,466 --> 00:04:04,467
"where's my other half?"

74
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:08,972
They're taking meetings
and as of 9:00 this morning,
we're on the books.

75
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:11,240
$3 million in
potential billings

76
00:04:11,308 --> 00:04:13,509
And they're venturing
into automobiles as well.

77
00:04:13,577 --> 00:04:14,911
When can you bring 'em in?

78
00:04:14,979 --> 00:04:17,080
Listen, let me spare you
the agony and the ecstasy

79
00:04:17,147 --> 00:04:19,082
<i>And tell you we are not
doing business with them.</i>

80
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:20,850
Excuse me?

81
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:22,852
Look, I don't expect you
to understand this

82
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,354
Because you were a little boy,

83
00:04:24,421 --> 00:04:26,322
<i>But I used to be a man
with a lot of friends.</i>

84
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:28,224
World war ii came

85
00:04:28,292 --> 00:04:30,226
And they were all killed
by your new yellow buddies.

86
00:04:34,365 --> 00:04:36,532
Look...

87
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,335
If Bernbach can do business
with Volkswagen, we can do
business with anybody.

88
00:04:39,403 --> 00:04:41,004
The war is over, Roger.

89
00:04:41,071 --> 00:04:42,972
Why don't we just bring
Dr. Lyle Evans in here?

90
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,340
That'll be enough of that.

91
00:04:47,177 --> 00:04:48,911
Lucky strike is great.
Meeting adjourned.

92
00:04:56,387 --> 00:04:58,287
We don't usually
put new business
to a vote, do we?

93
00:04:58,355 --> 00:05:01,624
Does anyone really
have a problem with this?

94
00:05:01,692 --> 00:05:03,393
No.
When can you
bring 'em in?

95
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,928
Immediately, if possible.
I don't want to lose our spot.

96
00:05:05,996 --> 00:05:07,730
So far I've been
advised to read

97
00:05:07,798 --> 00:05:09,599
The "the chrysanthemum
and the sword."

98
00:05:09,667 --> 00:05:12,935
From what I can tell,
they have their own way
of doing business.

99
00:05:13,003 --> 00:05:15,505
Bert,
I'm hoping you'll help us
navigate these waters?

100
00:05:15,572 --> 00:05:18,141
I'll prepare
a few salient points.

101
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:20,343
Keep Roger out of the loop.

102
00:05:20,411 --> 00:05:22,378
A rather exciting possibility.

103
00:05:22,446 --> 00:05:24,447
Good work.

104
00:05:24,515 --> 00:05:26,182
Joan, get everybody that book.

105
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,851
I at least want them
to see it on people's desks.

106
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:30,486
Who the hell
is Dr. Lyle Evans?

107
00:05:32,389 --> 00:05:35,124
I have no idea.

108
00:05:35,192 --> 00:05:37,627
The body of a 38-year-old
unitarian minister

109
00:05:37,695 --> 00:05:40,263
Was cremated within hours
of his death last night.

110
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:42,598
He had been clubbed
by white men who resented...

111
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:44,333
<i>- come in.</i>

112
00:05:46,603 --> 00:05:48,571
- Hi.
- Hi.

113
00:05:50,407 --> 00:05:52,809
- Sally?
- Hello.

114
00:05:52,876 --> 00:05:54,243
I brought my doctor Kit.

115
00:05:56,213 --> 00:05:57,847
Whoa.

116
00:05:59,249 --> 00:06:01,384
Okay, I'm gonna go.

117
00:06:01,452 --> 00:06:04,320
Enjoy yourself.
Which one is it?

118
00:06:04,388 --> 00:06:07,490
I mean, which restaurant
in case I need to reach you.

119
00:06:07,558 --> 00:06:09,125
Benihana's.

120
00:06:09,193 --> 00:06:10,760
You're going to see
a girl, aren't you?

121
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:12,628
Yes I am.

122
00:06:12,696 --> 00:06:15,031
- What's her name?
- Bethany.

123
00:06:15,099 --> 00:06:16,699
I don't like that.

124
00:06:16,767 --> 00:06:18,534
Well, you don't have to.

125
00:06:18,602 --> 00:06:20,436
Bed by 9:00?

126
00:06:24,174 --> 00:06:26,175
How do I love thee?

127
00:06:26,243 --> 00:06:29,011
Let me count the ways.

128
00:06:37,087 --> 00:06:38,688
Jesus.
What did you do?

129
00:06:38,756 --> 00:06:41,124
<i>she looks like a mongoloid.</i>

130
00:06:41,191 --> 00:06:43,426
- Is it that bad?
- Bobby, go to bed.

131
00:06:43,494 --> 00:06:45,528
- Sally, get over here.
- No.

132
00:06:45,596 --> 00:06:47,964
<i>- good night.</i>

133
00:06:48,031 --> 00:06:50,099
Come over here.

134
00:06:51,368 --> 00:06:53,603
I'm not mad.
Come on.

135
00:07:01,578 --> 00:07:03,913
Your dad is gonna kill me.

136
00:07:05,516 --> 00:07:08,217
He's actually gonna kill me.

137
00:07:08,285 --> 00:07:10,620
You have short hair
and daddy likes it.

138
00:07:10,687 --> 00:07:12,688
That doesn't matter.
You're not allowed
to do this

139
00:07:12,756 --> 00:07:14,323
And you know that.

140
00:07:14,391 --> 00:07:17,059
Are you and daddy doing it?

141
00:07:17,127 --> 00:07:19,996
- What?
- I know what it is.

142
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:22,765
I know that the man pees
inside the woman.

143
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:24,734
Where did you hear that?

144
00:07:24,802 --> 00:07:26,502
A girl at school.

145
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:29,105
You should talk to your mommy.

146
00:07:29,173 --> 00:07:30,773
I don't want to.

147
00:07:30,841 --> 00:07:32,241
Well, you don't need
to know right now,

148
00:07:32,309 --> 00:07:34,043
So stop changing the subject.

149
00:07:34,111 --> 00:07:36,746
I'm sorry.

150
00:07:36,814 --> 00:07:39,282
Do you understand
I'm in worse trouble
than you are?

151
00:07:40,784 --> 00:07:42,685
I just wanted to look pretty.

152
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:48,658
Come on.

153
00:07:48,725 --> 00:07:50,259
We're gonna try
and fix this, okay?

154
00:08:03,207 --> 00:08:04,907
You're not impressed.

155
00:08:04,975 --> 00:08:06,976
My hair smells like
I've been frying chicken.

156
00:08:08,679 --> 00:08:10,179
stop it.

157
00:08:10,247 --> 00:08:13,115
This place is very expensive.

158
00:08:13,183 --> 00:08:15,952
That's not it.
It's just not very intimate.

159
00:08:16,019 --> 00:08:17,687
Three dates in five months?

160
00:08:17,754 --> 00:08:18,988
Don't think I don't know why.

161
00:08:19,056 --> 00:08:21,424
If it isn't
the inscrutable don draper.

162
00:08:21,491 --> 00:08:23,392
Ted.

163
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:26,662
This is my wife Nan.

164
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:29,599
- This is my friend Bethany.
- Ted Chaough.

165
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:31,300
- Don draper.
- Pleasure.

166
00:08:31,368 --> 00:08:32,735
<i>Pleasure.</i>

167
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:34,804
We just booked Howard Moses
to shoot clearasil.

168
00:08:34,872 --> 00:08:37,807
- You ever work with him?
- Not yet.

169
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:40,643
I thought I was clever,
but it looks like you and I
had the same idea.

170
00:08:40,711 --> 00:08:43,045
- What are you talking about?
- What do you think?

171
00:08:43,113 --> 00:08:44,981
Honda?
You think the rest
of these tourists

172
00:08:45,048 --> 00:08:47,083
Are from j Walter Thompson?

173
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,618
I suppose it's possible.

174
00:08:48,685 --> 00:08:50,586
The good news is it's
gonna be between us.

175
00:08:50,654 --> 00:08:52,288
The bad news is
the best man's gonna win.

176
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:55,892
Enjoy your dinner.

177
00:08:55,959 --> 00:08:57,760
- We will.
- Nice to meet you.

178
00:09:01,198 --> 00:09:02,999
- What are you doing, Ted?
- Job.

179
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:10,106
- Who's he?
- He's a fly I keep
swatting away.

180
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:13,876
They haven't done half
of what we have.

181
00:09:13,944 --> 00:09:15,912
The minute he declared
himself the competition,

182
00:09:15,979 --> 00:09:18,114
Suddenly we were equal.

183
00:09:18,181 --> 00:09:20,783
Well, as far as I'm concerned,
he's no competition at all.

184
00:09:24,388 --> 00:09:26,389
Hello?

185
00:09:26,456 --> 00:09:28,391
We're not gonna let is
spoil our evening, are we?

186
00:09:30,961 --> 00:09:33,429
No.

187
00:09:33,497 --> 00:09:35,531
Do you know how to use those?

188
00:09:35,599 --> 00:09:37,633
Yes.

189
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:41,971
Think you could teach me?

190
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:55,351
What time did they go to bed?

191
00:09:55,419 --> 00:09:57,687
I'm really really sorry.

192
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:01,924
- They still up?
- No.

193
00:10:01,992 --> 00:10:04,961
It's just...
I was watching TV with Bobby

194
00:10:05,028 --> 00:10:06,195
And I turned around
for a second

195
00:10:06,263 --> 00:10:07,997
And Sally cut her hair.

196
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:09,432
What?

197
00:10:09,499 --> 00:10:11,968
It's pretty bad.

198
00:10:12,035 --> 00:10:13,970
I could've
just left them alone.

199
00:10:14,037 --> 00:10:16,672
She was in the bathroom.
I didn't know.

200
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,641
You were supposed
to watch them.

201
00:10:18,709 --> 00:10:22,445
Don't.
I finally got her to sleep.

202
00:10:22,512 --> 00:10:24,847
Do you know the River of Shit

203
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:26,215
I'm gonna get from her mother?

204
00:10:26,283 --> 00:10:28,851
I'm sorry about that.
I tried to fix it,

205
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,987
But you'll probably
need to take her to
the beauty parlor.

206
00:10:31,054 --> 00:10:33,389
Why the hell would she do that?

207
00:10:33,457 --> 00:10:36,625
She probably wanted to look
older like Hayley mills.

208
00:10:36,693 --> 00:10:38,694
I don't know.

209
00:10:38,762 --> 00:10:41,330
- I really shouldn't.
- Consider it severance.

210
00:10:46,436 --> 00:10:48,070
- Look...
- I don't want
your advice, okay?

211
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:54,777
Good night.

212
00:11:10,327 --> 00:11:11,827
it's probably
the kids.

213
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,101
- Hi, mom.
- Did you have
a nice time?

214
00:11:19,169 --> 00:11:20,136
Yeah.

215
00:11:25,509 --> 00:11:27,076
Take that hat off.

216
00:11:30,647 --> 00:11:32,748
Let me explain, okay?

217
00:11:32,816 --> 00:11:34,750
- What the hell
happened to you?
- Calm down.

218
00:11:34,818 --> 00:11:36,185
- You cut her hair?
- No.

219
00:11:36,253 --> 00:11:37,920
- I cut it.
I'm sorry.
- Hey!

220
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:39,789
Betty.

221
00:11:39,856 --> 00:11:42,091
- It was an accident.
- Jesus.

222
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,759
Betts, is that necessary?

223
00:11:43,827 --> 00:11:45,428
I'm really really sorry.

224
00:11:45,495 --> 00:11:47,263
Damn right you're sorry.
Get up to your room.

225
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:48,831
- Hold on.
- No, now.

226
00:11:49,966 --> 00:11:52,134
It'll be okay.

227
00:11:52,202 --> 00:11:54,770
Bobby, take your
little brother outside
and play.

228
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:02,478
- You didn't have to hit her.
- You're right,

229
00:12:02,546 --> 00:12:04,113
<i>Because it doesn't
do anything!</i>

230
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:07,116
You have picture day.

231
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:09,151
<i>- Forget about
your sleepover.
- Kids do this.</i>

232
00:12:09,219 --> 00:12:12,054
- You never did this?
- All I wanted was to
have long hair.

233
00:12:12,122 --> 00:12:13,923
In fact when my mother
was mad at me,

234
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:15,624
<i>She would threaten
to cut my hair.</i>

235
00:12:15,692 --> 00:12:17,993
- Where the hell were you?
- Look, it just happened.

236
00:12:18,061 --> 00:12:19,462
The sitter wasn't
paying attention.

237
00:12:19,529 --> 00:12:21,464
You know what?
I don't want to know
about your life.

238
00:12:21,531 --> 00:12:23,165
You can't even
watch them for a second.

239
00:12:23,233 --> 00:12:24,834
It's like leaving them
with nobody.

240
00:12:24,901 --> 00:12:27,036
Because you're
so good with them?

241
00:12:27,104 --> 00:12:29,271
Take her to the hairdresser.

242
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:30,840
Goodbye.

243
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:37,079
<i>- Betty.</i>

244
00:12:37,147 --> 00:12:38,447
Henry, I don't want to hear it.

245
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:41,984
I want him dead!

246
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:43,752
You don't think I feel that?

247
00:12:45,455 --> 00:12:47,556
I was divorced, Betty.

248
00:12:47,624 --> 00:12:50,593
My weekends with Ellie
were sacrosanct.

249
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,595
I probably paid for
a building in play land

250
00:12:52,662 --> 00:12:53,796
And he couldn't
take a night off?

251
00:12:53,864 --> 00:12:55,731
And who knows
who he had watching her?

252
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:57,967
Some secretary, another whore?

253
00:12:58,034 --> 00:13:00,035
But...

254
00:13:00,103 --> 00:13:04,306
That's him, not Sally.

255
00:13:04,374 --> 00:13:07,710
<i>Little girls do do this,</i>

256
00:13:07,777 --> 00:13:10,312
And not just ones
from broken homes.

257
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,683
I know.

258
00:13:17,487 --> 00:13:19,155
I was impulsive.

259
00:13:19,222 --> 00:13:22,458
I'll apologize.

260
00:13:22,526 --> 00:13:24,527
Having had a girl this age,

261
00:13:24,594 --> 00:13:26,762
I can tell you that punishment
will only make this worse.

262
00:13:28,798 --> 00:13:30,799
So when you're
up there apologizing,

263
00:13:30,867 --> 00:13:33,235
You let her know
that she's going to go
to the hairdresser

264
00:13:33,303 --> 00:13:35,437
And she can go
on her sleepover.

265
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,974
Reward her?

266
00:13:39,042 --> 00:13:41,043
- Really?
- Really.

267
00:13:49,686 --> 00:13:51,353
You're soft, you know that?

268
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,434
There you are.
The Honda meeting's today.

269
00:14:05,502 --> 00:14:06,969
And before
you bite my head off,

270
00:14:07,037 --> 00:14:09,205
I'm up to date on the protocol
with the help of Cooper.

271
00:14:09,272 --> 00:14:12,308
We don't have to do anything
but avoid criticizing them
or giving advice.

272
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:14,443
I ran into Ted Chaough.

273
00:14:14,511 --> 00:14:16,745
How are they in this thing
and how could you
not know that?

274
00:14:16,813 --> 00:14:18,480
This guy's drafting off of us.

275
00:14:18,548 --> 00:14:21,517
For the record,
it's j.W.T., c.G.C. And us.

276
00:14:21,551 --> 00:14:24,753
Now if you don't mind,
I have to get some gifts wrapped

277
00:14:24,821 --> 00:14:26,755
And get these chrysanthemums
out of the building.

278
00:14:26,823 --> 00:14:28,457
Apparently
they symbolize death.

279
00:14:28,525 --> 00:14:30,693
So much conflicting
information.

280
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,433
Allow me to show you around.

281
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:42,705
Our offices are probably more
modern than you've seen,

282
00:14:42,772 --> 00:14:44,974
But that's the kind
of company we are...
forward-thinking.

283
00:14:48,912 --> 00:14:51,413
This is what we call
the creative lounge.

284
00:14:51,481 --> 00:14:53,515
We can't tell you
how it happens,

285
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:55,150
<i>But it does
happen here.</i>

286
00:14:55,218 --> 00:14:56,952
This is too difficult.

287
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,521
Well, tell them something.

288
00:15:02,259 --> 00:15:04,693
This is Joan Harris,
our chief hostess.

289
00:15:04,761 --> 00:15:06,295
I'd like you to meet
Ichiro Kamura

290
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:08,297
And Hachi Saito.

291
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:11,500
Nice to meet you.
I hope no one's taken
you to Benihana.

292
00:15:11,568 --> 00:15:13,802
David Ogilvy.

293
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:16,639
I've got a very good list
of steakhouses.
Just ask.

294
00:15:24,114 --> 00:15:25,814
Not very subtle, aren't they?

295
00:15:25,882 --> 00:15:27,850
No, they are not.

296
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:33,589
We are most happily
looking forward

297
00:15:33,657 --> 00:15:35,591
To presentation.

298
00:15:35,659 --> 00:15:37,326
Not now, I hope.

299
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:42,998
We want more driver
for motorcycle.

300
00:15:43,066 --> 00:15:45,601
And we shall endeavor
to make that happen.

301
00:15:45,669 --> 00:15:48,437
And now that we are finished,

302
00:15:48,505 --> 00:15:51,307
Please accept our modest gifts.

303
00:15:52,709 --> 00:15:54,843
I cannot accept.

304
00:15:54,911 --> 00:15:56,712
A small token.

305
00:15:59,082 --> 00:16:01,717
No thank you.

306
00:16:01,785 --> 00:16:03,719
Please.
You are our guests.

307
00:16:03,787 --> 00:16:05,421
Thank you.

308
00:16:07,857 --> 00:16:11,493
- Open it.
- No. Later, of course.

309
00:16:13,296 --> 00:16:14,963
It's a cantaloupe.

310
00:16:17,901 --> 00:16:19,601
Johnny Walker red.

311
00:16:25,542 --> 00:16:27,309
<i>- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.</i>

312
00:16:30,513 --> 00:16:34,149
I'm sorry.
I didn't know
this meeting was happening.

313
00:16:34,217 --> 00:16:36,852
Then again,
I know how some people
love surprises.

314
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,221
I apologize, gentlemen,

315
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:42,091
But for some reason
I was not informed.

316
00:16:42,158 --> 00:16:44,393
In fact, someone set
a long lunch for me
with Randolph.

317
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:48,831
Well, it was last minute
and now, unfortunately,
drawn to a close.

318
00:16:48,898 --> 00:16:52,134
I have to warn you
they won't know it's over
until you drop the big one...

319
00:16:52,202 --> 00:16:53,836
Twice.

320
00:16:53,903 --> 00:16:55,404
The meeting is not over.

321
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:58,173
We have yet
to present the rules.

322
00:16:58,241 --> 00:17:00,075
So now you're dictating terms.

323
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:08,951
Mr. Kamura, Mr. Saito,
this is Roger sterling.

324
00:17:10,253 --> 00:17:12,988
This is their translator
Akira Takahashi.

325
00:17:14,657 --> 00:17:19,795
We give each firm $3,000

326
00:17:19,863 --> 00:17:23,699
For a competitive presentation.

327
00:17:23,767 --> 00:17:27,503
In this packet
are the conditions
for the competition.

328
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:30,038
We don't want any conditions.
We want it to be unconditional.

329
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:33,275
Akira, go ahead,
tell 'em what I said.

330
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:35,444
Roger, stop it.

331
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:37,813
- These men are our guests.
- I know exactly who
these men are.

332
00:17:37,881 --> 00:17:39,782
You think you can just
come in here and we'll
Fawn all over you?

333
00:17:39,849 --> 00:17:42,751
We beat you
and we'll beat you again.

334
00:17:42,819 --> 00:17:44,386
We don't want
any of your jap crap.

335
00:17:44,454 --> 00:17:48,023
<i>So sayonara.</i>

336
00:17:54,697 --> 00:17:58,100
If you could only know
my embarrassment.

337
00:18:00,603 --> 00:18:03,572
His wife's very sick.
He's been drinking a lot.

338
00:18:10,046 --> 00:18:11,814
You have our rules.

339
00:18:11,881 --> 00:18:14,016
We very much look forward
to your prestation.

340
00:18:27,664 --> 00:18:29,631
You don't get
to kill this account.

341
00:18:29,699 --> 00:18:32,034
- Well, you know how they are.
Maybe it'll kill itself.
- Enough.

342
00:18:32,101 --> 00:18:33,902
I'm not even talking
about money right now.

343
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:36,405
I'm talking about
the kind of work you
could do for those people.

344
00:18:36,473 --> 00:18:38,040
Have you seen
that motorcycle?
They love design.

345
00:18:38,107 --> 00:18:39,775
As long as my name's
in that lobby,

346
00:18:39,843 --> 00:18:42,010
I get to choose whom
I do business with.

347
00:18:42,078 --> 00:18:44,446
I've got a lot better reasons
than you had with Jantzen.

348
00:18:44,514 --> 00:18:46,281
Jantzen was over.

349
00:18:46,349 --> 00:18:48,217
I made a pledge
to a lot of men
you'll never meet

350
00:18:48,284 --> 00:18:50,185
Not to do business with them.

351
00:18:50,253 --> 00:18:52,788
Christ on a cracker,
where do you get off?

352
00:18:52,856 --> 00:18:55,257
You know what?
You weren't there.
You weren't anywhere.

353
00:18:55,325 --> 00:18:56,692
I'm sorry you can't understand.

354
00:18:56,759 --> 00:18:58,360
It's been almost 20 years.

355
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:00,796
Whether you like it or not,
the world has moved on.

356
00:19:00,864 --> 00:19:02,698
These are not the same people.

357
00:19:02,765 --> 00:19:04,566
How could that be?
I'm the same people!

358
00:19:04,634 --> 00:19:06,568
You don't think
I know what you're doing?

359
00:19:06,636 --> 00:19:08,804
You're wrapping yourself
in the flag

360
00:19:08,872 --> 00:19:10,806
So you can keep me
from bringing in an account

361
00:19:10,874 --> 00:19:12,741
Because you know
every chip I make,

362
00:19:12,809 --> 00:19:15,010
We become less dependent
on lucky strike

363
00:19:15,078 --> 00:19:17,045
And therefore
less dependent on you.

364
00:19:17,113 --> 00:19:19,181
- Why you little...
- Roger!

365
00:19:22,852 --> 00:19:24,353
Get him out of here.

366
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,588
The rest of us are trying
to build something.

367
00:19:32,862 --> 00:19:34,563
He's right.

368
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,234
Where would you hide a coin?

369
00:19:51,302 --> 00:19:53,437
You'd spend it, wouldn't you?

370
00:19:53,504 --> 00:19:55,973
Well, I do know where it is.
I'll tell you.

371
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,541
<i>Then tell me.</i>

372
00:19:57,608 --> 00:19:58,842
<i>I'll make
a bargain with you.</i>

373
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:01,912
Let these two go.
Keep me. I'll tell you.

374
00:20:04,649 --> 00:20:06,850
<i>- Promise.
- No.</i>

375
00:20:06,918 --> 00:20:08,685
<i>Then no deal.</i>

376
00:20:30,942 --> 00:20:33,310
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

377
00:20:33,378 --> 00:20:34,511
Laura.

378
00:20:36,547 --> 00:20:37,781
Go upstairs.

379
00:20:48,526 --> 00:20:50,894
Hold still.
I'll get it.

380
00:20:54,365 --> 00:20:57,067
What's the problem?
Is she sick?

381
00:20:57,135 --> 00:20:58,969
I would've come and gotten her.

382
00:20:59,037 --> 00:21:01,738
No.
The slumber party
ended early.

383
00:21:04,075 --> 00:21:05,308
I'd like to speak to Betty.

384
00:21:07,145 --> 00:21:09,079
Okay.
Honey?

385
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:14,818
Is everything all right?

386
00:21:14,886 --> 00:21:16,853
No, it's not.

387
00:21:16,921 --> 00:21:19,456
Could you leave us
alone for a moment?

388
00:21:25,196 --> 00:21:27,931
I found Sally behaving
inappropriately.

389
00:21:27,999 --> 00:21:30,200
What'd she do?

390
00:21:31,869 --> 00:21:33,837
She was in our den on the couch

391
00:21:33,905 --> 00:21:35,639
Playing with herself.

392
00:21:36,908 --> 00:21:38,575
What?

393
00:21:38,643 --> 00:21:41,311
I don't know what goes on here,

394
00:21:41,379 --> 00:21:43,313
But that kind of behavior
is not allowed in my house

395
00:21:43,381 --> 00:21:45,449
And certainly not
in the presence
of my daughter.

396
00:21:48,453 --> 00:21:51,254
I am...

397
00:21:52,957 --> 00:21:54,925
Very sorry for this behavior

398
00:21:54,992 --> 00:21:56,993
And so is Sally.

399
00:21:59,597 --> 00:22:01,465
I would've done the same thing.

400
00:22:04,502 --> 00:22:06,136
Well...

401
00:22:06,204 --> 00:22:08,138
I'm sorry about that.

402
00:22:10,675 --> 00:22:12,742
I should go.

403
00:22:23,688 --> 00:22:25,455
What is wrong with you?

404
00:22:27,925 --> 00:22:29,960
You don't do those things.

405
00:22:30,027 --> 00:22:32,696
<i>You don't do them in private
and you especially don't
do them in public.</i>

406
00:22:35,967 --> 00:22:37,934
- You have nothing to say?
- I didn't do anything.

407
00:22:38,002 --> 00:22:40,337
Don't you dare lie to me.
I'll cut your fingers off.

408
00:22:40,404 --> 00:22:43,306
Go to bed.
We'll deal with
this in the morning.

409
00:22:48,379 --> 00:22:49,980
What happened?

410
00:22:54,418 --> 00:22:56,453
I'm mortified.

411
00:22:56,521 --> 00:22:59,489
I'm so embarrassed.

412
00:22:59,557 --> 00:23:01,992
what happened?

413
00:23:03,961 --> 00:23:05,762
She caught Sally...

414
00:23:07,899 --> 00:23:09,533
Playing with herself.

415
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,041
What's wrong with her?

416
00:23:18,109 --> 00:23:20,043
That woman will tell everybody.

417
00:23:20,111 --> 00:23:24,347
why is she doing this?

418
00:23:24,415 --> 00:23:26,983
I told you if it got serious,

419
00:23:27,051 --> 00:23:29,085
Ere is a solution.

420
00:23:29,153 --> 00:23:31,888
I don't want to do that, Henry.

421
00:23:31,956 --> 00:23:34,024
It's one thing after another.

422
00:23:34,091 --> 00:23:36,059
What's wrong with her?

423
00:23:36,127 --> 00:23:39,763
Maybe it's time
we let a professional
answer that question.

424
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:41,865
Henry...

425
00:23:44,101 --> 00:23:45,735
I went to a psychiatrist once.

426
00:23:48,005 --> 00:23:50,040
What?
Why?

427
00:23:50,107 --> 00:23:52,776
Because I was unhappy.

428
00:23:52,843 --> 00:23:54,578
And I don't think
it helps anything.

429
00:23:58,015 --> 00:24:00,150
I hate to think how much worse

430
00:24:00,218 --> 00:24:01,918
It would have been
for Eleanor without one.

431
00:24:01,986 --> 00:24:04,354
They train them just for kids.

432
00:24:04,422 --> 00:24:06,356
We got ours from the school.

433
00:24:06,424 --> 00:24:09,459
I'm saying this
not because I'm so sure

434
00:24:09,527 --> 00:24:11,261
There's something
wrong with her,

435
00:24:11,329 --> 00:24:13,296
But I think this is
very hard on you two.

436
00:24:17,368 --> 00:24:19,536
- When did you go?
- Years ago.

437
00:24:19,604 --> 00:24:21,471
I was bored.

438
00:24:23,574 --> 00:24:25,942
- Can we leave it at that?
- Of course.

439
00:24:51,202 --> 00:24:53,403
Miss Blankenship,
any luck on that call
to California?

440
00:24:53,471 --> 00:24:55,572
<i>I'm sorry.
No answer.</i>

441
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:58,541
<i>Misters Peters and Pryce
to see you.</i>

442
00:24:58,609 --> 00:25:00,510
Send them in.

443
00:25:00,578 --> 00:25:04,848
I think we're okay,
but everything they do
is inside out.

444
00:25:04,915 --> 00:25:07,884
I got a call this morning
from my contact Masao

445
00:25:07,952 --> 00:25:10,720
Telling me that the meeting
was a Margaret Dumont-sized
disaster,

446
00:25:10,788 --> 00:25:13,356
But then... lane?

447
00:25:13,424 --> 00:25:15,558
Then nearly
20 minutes later
Masao called me

448
00:25:15,626 --> 00:25:18,228
And set a time
for our presentation.

449
00:25:18,296 --> 00:25:20,363
Look, there's probably
a guy like Roger
at every firm.

450
00:25:20,431 --> 00:25:22,632
They've outgrown it
and we haven't.

451
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:25,969
Roger has something to say.

452
00:25:26,037 --> 00:25:30,273
<i>Mr. Cooper
and Mr. Sterling.</i>

453
00:25:31,609 --> 00:25:33,276
I realize that I
should not at this point

454
00:25:33,344 --> 00:25:35,845
Limit our potential clients
in any way.

455
00:25:35,913 --> 00:25:38,715
Next account,
no matter what it is,
you'll have my full support.

456
00:25:38,783 --> 00:25:40,116
And?

457
00:25:42,453 --> 00:25:44,554
Look, I know it's an old one

458
00:25:44,622 --> 00:25:47,190
And I have to let it go
just for my health alone,

459
00:25:47,258 --> 00:25:50,527
And, uh...
well, hell, it's over.

460
00:25:50,594 --> 00:25:53,596
Your contrition wouldn't
have gotten you out of this,
but you're lucky.

461
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:56,099
They called and gave us
an appointment anyway.

462
00:25:56,167 --> 00:25:58,034
That means nothing.

463
00:25:58,102 --> 00:26:01,538
<i>- It's over.
- No, Bert, I said
we have a meeting.</i>

464
00:26:01,605 --> 00:26:06,276
It's most likely that
they are expecting us
to come in and resign.

465
00:26:06,344 --> 00:26:08,645
How do you get there from here?

466
00:26:10,715 --> 00:26:12,615
Have we received a gift?

467
00:26:14,452 --> 00:26:15,885
We should have
gotten one yesterday.

468
00:26:15,953 --> 00:26:17,887
I haven't.

469
00:26:17,955 --> 00:26:20,623
Miss Blankenship,
have I received any
packages today?

470
00:26:20,691 --> 00:26:22,025
<i>Yes.</i>

471
00:26:23,561 --> 00:26:24,861
Could you bring it in, please?

472
00:26:30,601 --> 00:26:33,603
It says "don" on it.

473
00:26:33,671 --> 00:26:35,338
Give it to him.

474
00:26:42,413 --> 00:26:45,782
"help me, Honda,
help help me, Honda.
Love, Teddy Chaouh."

475
00:26:48,252 --> 00:26:51,388
<i>- So there is no gift.
- That's how they work.</i>

476
00:26:51,455 --> 00:26:54,858
They want us to go in there,
bow down and beg them
to chop our heads off

477
00:26:54,925 --> 00:26:57,861
Because we disgraced ourselves.
How could you admire
these animals?

478
00:26:57,928 --> 00:26:59,529
Would you shut up?
They're businessmen

479
00:26:59,597 --> 00:27:01,030
And you insulted them
to their face.

480
00:27:01,098 --> 00:27:02,465
I'm expecting a child.

481
00:27:04,435 --> 00:27:07,203
Jai alai, clearasil, now Honda.

482
00:27:07,271 --> 00:27:09,339
Chaough wins another one
by default.

483
00:27:09,407 --> 00:27:12,442
- He's not going to win.
- I'm not wasting
that appointment.

484
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:14,144
We need to do something

485
00:27:14,211 --> 00:27:15,979
That will make them
notice us... fireworks.

486
00:27:16,046 --> 00:27:17,981
- Do you have a campaign?
- No.

487
00:27:18,048 --> 00:27:20,950
But I will
and we're gonna shoot
a whole commercial for it...

488
00:27:21,018 --> 00:27:23,119
Something outrageous,
something graphic.

489
00:27:23,187 --> 00:27:25,388
The rules limit us
to boards and copy.

490
00:27:25,456 --> 00:27:27,824
It specifically says
no finished work.

491
00:27:27,892 --> 00:27:30,126
Because no one's ever won
an account by breaking
the rules?

492
00:27:30,194 --> 00:27:33,296
- Not with the Japanese.
- You're trying to tell me

493
00:27:33,364 --> 00:27:35,665
If we put our backs into this,
we couldn't turn their heads?

494
00:27:35,733 --> 00:27:38,301
$3,000 is all we have.

495
00:27:38,369 --> 00:27:41,237
That should buy
about four seconds
of your commercial.

496
00:27:41,305 --> 00:27:43,072
You don't think it's worth
going out of pocket?

497
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,474
What pocket?

498
00:27:44,542 --> 00:27:47,143
A spec commercial
will eat up our ability

499
00:27:47,211 --> 00:27:49,012
To pitch anymore
new business this year.

500
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:50,747
It's only March.

501
00:27:50,815 --> 00:27:53,216
I would be willing to risk
bankrupting this place

502
00:27:53,284 --> 00:27:55,218
If I didn't think
we were already dead
in the water...

503
00:27:56,687 --> 00:27:58,588
But we are.

504
00:28:01,859 --> 00:28:03,259
Come on, Bert.

505
00:28:19,966 --> 00:28:22,434
- Hello?
- Am I catching you alone?

506
00:28:24,537 --> 00:28:26,071
What do you want?

507
00:28:26,139 --> 00:28:28,307
I prefer not to talk
about this on the phone,

508
00:28:28,374 --> 00:28:31,009
But it's our feeling
that Sally needs to see
a psychiatrist.

509
00:28:31,077 --> 00:28:32,444
<i>Our feeling.</i>

510
00:28:32,512 --> 00:28:35,314
Why, because she cut her hair?

511
00:28:35,381 --> 00:28:37,416
No, it's more
serious this time.

512
00:28:37,483 --> 00:28:39,518
I'm telling you
because I found someone
through the school...

513
00:28:39,585 --> 00:28:41,620
A children specialist.

514
00:28:41,688 --> 00:28:43,488
What exactly did she do?

515
00:28:43,556 --> 00:28:44,923
She set the house on fire?

516
00:28:44,991 --> 00:28:47,726
She was masturbating, don,
in front of a friend.

517
00:28:47,794 --> 00:28:49,261
Does that seem normal to you?

518
00:28:49,329 --> 00:28:52,397
Really?

519
00:28:52,465 --> 00:28:54,066
Boy or girl?

520
00:28:54,133 --> 00:28:56,368
Jesus.
What's the difference?

521
00:28:56,436 --> 00:28:58,970
The doctor needs
to speak with us,

522
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:00,839
Individually of course.

523
00:29:00,907 --> 00:29:03,275
So you've made up your mind.
Why are you even calling me?

524
00:29:03,343 --> 00:29:05,844
She's out of control.
I thought you'd be concerned.

525
00:29:05,912 --> 00:29:07,879
I am.
I just don't know
that she needs a doctor.

526
00:29:07,947 --> 00:29:09,381
<i>Can't you talk to her?</i>

527
00:29:09,449 --> 00:29:11,683
You think I want this?
I don't know what else to do.

528
00:29:11,751 --> 00:29:13,885
You know what kind
of little girls do that?

529
00:29:13,953 --> 00:29:16,321
- Fast ones.
- She's 10 years old.

530
00:29:16,389 --> 00:29:17,856
Well, don't think
she doesn't understand.

531
00:29:17,924 --> 00:29:19,624
She understands
a lot of things
thanks to you.

532
00:29:19,692 --> 00:29:22,294
- What?
- I don't care what you do,

533
00:29:22,362 --> 00:29:23,695
But just don't do it
with her there.

534
00:29:23,763 --> 00:29:25,964
You brought another man
into your bed,

535
00:29:26,032 --> 00:29:28,066
<i>Into her house.
You don't think she
noticed that?</i>

536
00:29:28,134 --> 00:29:31,670
One man, don.
How many have you had
in your bachelor pad?

537
00:29:31,738 --> 00:29:33,772
That girl you had
watching her?
Who's she?

538
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,742
- I'm married.
- Jesus. You ever
hear yourself?

539
00:29:36,809 --> 00:29:39,411
I'll give the information
to your secretary.

540
00:29:39,479 --> 00:29:41,146
<i>- Perfect.
- Good night.</i>

541
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:59,431
- Oh-ho!
- Yes!

542
00:30:02,435 --> 00:30:05,704
Have you seen these?
I'm trying to figure out
what makes it work.

543
00:30:05,772 --> 00:30:07,239
<i>I'm still wondering
what makes you work.</i>

544
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:09,841
Joan, Pete, Peggy.

545
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,947
Don't touch it.
I want to see how
long it goes.

546
00:30:24,257 --> 00:30:25,690
What's wrong?

547
00:30:28,795 --> 00:30:30,695
"a man is shamed"

548
00:30:30,763 --> 00:30:32,664
By being openly ridiculed
and rejected.

549
00:30:32,732 --> 00:30:34,332
"It requires an audience."

550
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,568
What is that?
Fortune cookie?

551
00:30:36,636 --> 00:30:38,336
It's from that book
you were all supposed to read.

552
00:30:38,404 --> 00:30:40,005
Oh.

553
00:30:40,072 --> 00:30:41,773
Apparently making a commercial
for the Honda pitch

554
00:30:41,841 --> 00:30:43,875
- Would bankrupt us.
- And it's against the rules.

555
00:30:43,943 --> 00:30:45,477
Forget the rules
for a second.

556
00:30:45,545 --> 00:30:47,245
C.G.C. Is
the same size as us.

557
00:30:47,313 --> 00:30:49,548
If we can't afford to do
anything, they can't.

558
00:30:49,615 --> 00:30:51,716
So everybody's bankrupt.

559
00:30:51,784 --> 00:30:53,418
Chaough said he's
in my rearview mirror.

560
00:30:53,486 --> 00:30:55,487
Guess what?

561
00:30:55,555 --> 00:30:57,489
I'm gonna make a left turn
right off a cliff.

562
00:30:59,826 --> 00:31:02,461
All I have to do
is let chaough think
I'm making a commercial

563
00:31:02,528 --> 00:31:04,529
And he'll make one.

564
00:31:04,597 --> 00:31:06,665
- So what's our campaign?
- We don't have a campaign.

565
00:31:06,732 --> 00:31:08,333
We're not doing anything.

566
00:31:08,401 --> 00:31:09,968
He just needs to think we are.

567
00:31:10,036 --> 00:31:12,637
So what?
He's going to
make a commercial.

568
00:31:12,705 --> 00:31:14,639
What if it's fantastic?
He'll win the account.

569
00:31:14,707 --> 00:31:18,777
Let me worry about that.

570
00:31:18,845 --> 00:31:22,247
I know she's the best rep
there is, but she told me
you were unavailable.

571
00:31:22,315 --> 00:31:24,916
I am.
Clearasil doesn't wrap
until Friday night,

572
00:31:24,984 --> 00:31:28,687
But maybe
you could push it.
It sounds interesting.

573
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:32,123
Well, Howard,
I'm going to insist

574
00:31:32,191 --> 00:31:34,159
- On your discretion
at this point.
- Of course.

575
00:31:35,761 --> 00:31:37,395
It's going to be
four to five days.

576
00:31:37,463 --> 00:31:39,397
<i>- just a minute.</i>

577
00:31:39,465 --> 00:31:40,866
<i>Could you get the door?</i>

578
00:31:46,439 --> 00:31:49,007
I'm sorry.
I thought we'd
put this in here.

579
00:31:49,075 --> 00:31:50,842
Later.

580
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:52,377
- Sorry about that.
- That's okay.

581
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:57,916
- You didn't see that.
- No, of course not.

582
00:31:57,984 --> 00:32:00,352
- That's draper, isn't it?
- Yes.

583
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:03,655
Anyway, it's 12 scenes.

584
00:32:03,723 --> 00:32:05,590
One of them obviously
has a crowd.

585
00:32:05,658 --> 00:32:08,026
You'll need to figure out
how to shoot on the Staten
island ferry,

586
00:32:08,094 --> 00:32:11,062
To it and from it
and how you're going
to close fifth Avenue.

587
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:14,299
I'll be honest.
I'd give anything to do this,

588
00:32:14,367 --> 00:32:16,968
But right now I'm too busy.

589
00:32:17,036 --> 00:32:19,738
Anyway, you know
I'd much rather shoot
your Honda commercial.

590
00:32:19,805 --> 00:32:21,973
I don't have one.

591
00:32:22,041 --> 00:32:24,910
Why the hell
did they call you in?

592
00:32:24,977 --> 00:32:27,746
- They know I've got you booked.
- How can they afford that?

593
00:32:27,813 --> 00:32:30,115
Get that kid in here
who worked for draper.

594
00:32:32,818 --> 00:32:34,319
Anticipation.

595
00:32:34,387 --> 00:32:36,154
Suspense.

596
00:32:41,994 --> 00:32:43,962
A Honda tears through
a subway tunnel,

597
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:45,931
The train nipping at its tire.

598
00:32:45,998 --> 00:32:48,433
he keeps looking back,

599
00:32:48,501 --> 00:32:51,002
The train roaring at him.

600
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:52,470
He's wearing a racing helmet.

601
00:32:52,538 --> 00:32:54,005
And then you see him
head up the steps.

602
00:32:54,073 --> 00:32:56,508
- Can they do that?
- Howard'll make them do that.

603
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:58,710
Then he gets out
on the sidewalk,

604
00:32:58,778 --> 00:33:01,346
Stops, kicks down
the kickstand,

605
00:33:01,414 --> 00:33:03,481
Takes off the helmet

606
00:33:03,549 --> 00:33:05,817
And he is a she...
California blonde.

607
00:33:05,885 --> 00:33:08,153
Hands down,
that's your best idea.

608
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,622
We'll bring
a guy to the pitch
in a racing helmet,

609
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:13,158
Have him take it off...
it's a sexy girl.

610
00:33:13,225 --> 00:33:15,894
- What?
- We only have $3,000.

611
00:33:15,962 --> 00:33:19,497
<i>- We're not shooting Shit.

612
00:33:19,565 --> 00:33:22,200
How long did you
work for draper?

613
00:33:22,268 --> 00:33:24,369
A little over two years.

614
00:33:24,437 --> 00:33:26,738
When you were in a bake-off,
he ever break the rules?

615
00:33:26,806 --> 00:33:29,341
I don't know.
He wouldn't have
shared it with me,

616
00:33:29,408 --> 00:33:31,776
But definitely
doesn't think the
rules apply to him.

617
00:33:31,844 --> 00:33:33,445
He once disappeared
for a month.

618
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:35,213
Does he like to play games?

619
00:33:35,281 --> 00:33:38,350
He's always thinking
on the edges of
where you are.

620
00:33:38,417 --> 00:33:42,053
I don't know.
He's... he's a genius.

621
00:33:42,121 --> 00:33:45,657
You ever talk that way
about me?

622
00:33:45,725 --> 00:33:47,692
Why don't you go work
for your boyfriend?
Get out.

623
00:33:49,362 --> 00:33:51,162
And give me 20 different words
for "pimples." out!

624
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:57,102
Call Barbara about
Howard here and contact
the city of New York.

625
00:33:57,169 --> 00:33:58,737
We need a subway.

626
00:34:22,762 --> 00:34:24,329
How are you doing?

627
00:34:25,998 --> 00:34:27,766
Excuse me.
Can I help you?

628
00:34:27,833 --> 00:34:29,868
We're, uh...
we're late.

629
00:34:29,935 --> 00:34:31,936
No you're not.
Closed set.

630
00:34:32,004 --> 00:34:33,505
Sorry.

631
00:35:00,191 --> 00:35:02,926
oh, you scared me.

632
00:35:04,596 --> 00:35:06,397
Who are you feeding today?

633
00:35:08,133 --> 00:35:10,434
Royal traveller Samsonite.

634
00:35:14,139 --> 00:35:15,606
This is like a coconut.

635
00:35:15,673 --> 00:35:17,541
Be careful.

636
00:35:20,078 --> 00:35:21,779
There was a trapeze artist.

637
00:35:21,846 --> 00:35:24,248
He made more in an hour here

638
00:35:24,315 --> 00:35:25,616
Than he makes in a week
at the circus.

639
00:35:28,353 --> 00:35:30,053
Have you ever had this?
Sake?

640
00:35:30,121 --> 00:35:31,889
No.

641
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,494
I don't know how people drink
the way you do around here.

642
00:35:37,562 --> 00:35:39,196
I'd fall asleep.

643
00:35:43,968 --> 00:35:45,969
What's it like being
a trapeze artist?

644
00:35:46,037 --> 00:35:48,305
Or did you just ask him
about his luggage?

645
00:35:50,241 --> 00:35:51,708
It's good.

646
00:35:53,411 --> 00:35:55,412
He was surprisingly modest.

647
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,881
His father does it
better than him.

648
00:35:57,949 --> 00:35:59,616
He actually said that?

649
00:35:59,684 --> 00:36:01,452
Best part of my job.

650
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:04,321
You'd be surprised
what people will say
to an interested stranger.

651
00:36:05,957 --> 00:36:08,025
Why does everybody need
to talk about everything?

652
00:36:08,092 --> 00:36:09,893
I don't know but they do.

653
00:36:09,961 --> 00:36:12,763
And no matter what happens
while they're talking,

654
00:36:12,831 --> 00:36:14,198
When they're done
they feel better.

655
00:36:17,101 --> 00:36:18,669
You have kids?

656
00:36:20,371 --> 00:36:22,005
No.

657
00:36:22,073 --> 00:36:23,974
Where's your husband?

658
00:36:27,612 --> 00:36:29,780
I'm not married.

659
00:36:29,848 --> 00:36:32,449
But you're wearing...
you're divorced?

660
00:36:32,517 --> 00:36:33,917
No.

661
00:36:35,553 --> 00:36:37,588
This is just a stop sign.

662
00:36:39,357 --> 00:36:40,991
I walk into a lot of offices

663
00:36:41,059 --> 00:36:44,027
And it's helped me avoid
a lot of distracting
conversations.

664
00:36:44,095 --> 00:36:45,696
But you told me.

665
00:36:48,967 --> 00:36:50,234
<i>Do you have children?</i>

666
00:36:50,301 --> 00:36:52,269
I do.

667
00:36:52,337 --> 00:36:53,637
Two boys and a girl...

668
00:36:53,705 --> 00:36:55,439
One and a half, seven and 10.

669
00:36:57,141 --> 00:36:59,209
I'm sure it must be hard
to be apart.

670
00:37:01,145 --> 00:37:02,479
I don't see them enough.

671
00:37:03,982 --> 00:37:05,482
And when I do,
I don't know what to do.

672
00:37:07,185 --> 00:37:09,286
When I drop them off
I feel relieved.

673
00:37:11,523 --> 00:37:13,156
And then I miss them.

674
00:37:15,326 --> 00:37:16,660
I'm sorry.

675
00:37:20,064 --> 00:37:21,865
It is not going well.

676
00:37:23,635 --> 00:37:27,271
My ex-wife thinks
my daughter needs
a psychiatrist.

677
00:37:29,874 --> 00:37:32,409
And I assume
you're against that.

678
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,814
I don't know.

679
00:37:37,882 --> 00:37:40,617
Well, I can't say there's
any evidence to support this,

680
00:37:40,685 --> 00:37:43,754
But I'm pretty sure
if you love her and
she knows it,

681
00:37:43,821 --> 00:37:45,389
She'll be fine.

682
00:37:52,964 --> 00:37:54,464
Well, thank you for the drink.

683
00:37:57,502 --> 00:37:59,102
I should be going.

684
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:01,705
Fake dinner plans
with your fake husband?

685
00:38:04,475 --> 00:38:05,842
Good night.

686
00:38:12,884 --> 00:38:14,384
Now from what you told me
on the phone

687
00:38:14,452 --> 00:38:16,486
This year s been quite
eventful for your family.

688
00:38:16,554 --> 00:38:19,256
I know it seems fast,

689
00:38:19,324 --> 00:38:22,526
But I felt children
had no concept of time

690
00:38:22,594 --> 00:38:24,428
And Henry's
really taken to them.

691
00:38:24,495 --> 00:38:27,731
He has a daughter
and she's such an
exceptional young woman.

692
00:38:29,867 --> 00:38:31,768
Well, if you choose
to have Sally work with me,

693
00:38:31,836 --> 00:38:33,403
I'd like to meet her

694
00:38:33,471 --> 00:38:35,706
And then interview you
and your ex-husband.

695
00:38:35,773 --> 00:38:37,474
Well, I doubt
you'll ever meet him.

696
00:38:37,542 --> 00:38:39,476
That's his level of interest.

697
00:38:42,013 --> 00:38:45,248
Is this most recent incident
of the most concern for you?

698
00:38:46,884 --> 00:38:48,852
Well, I know the divorce
is mostly to blame,

699
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:52,255
But she's been different
ever since my father died.

700
00:38:54,058 --> 00:38:55,525
He lived with us briefly.

701
00:38:57,328 --> 00:38:58,795
They were very close.

702
00:39:05,737 --> 00:39:07,204
I wish he had met Henry.

703
00:39:08,706 --> 00:39:09,940
That's my husband.

704
00:39:10,008 --> 00:39:12,275
They would've gotten along.

705
00:39:14,712 --> 00:39:16,713
My mother...
I don't know.

706
00:39:16,781 --> 00:39:18,915
My goodness, if I had done
what Sally did...

707
00:39:18,983 --> 00:39:21,084
My mother was
very strict about it.

708
00:39:21,152 --> 00:39:24,788
My brother, he saved his money

709
00:39:24,856 --> 00:39:26,523
And bought a nudist magazine

710
00:39:26,591 --> 00:39:29,126
And showed it to me.

711
00:39:29,193 --> 00:39:31,061
My mother found it
and she nailed it

712
00:39:31,129 --> 00:39:33,530
To his bedroom door.

713
00:39:33,598 --> 00:39:36,033
What about you?

714
00:39:40,972 --> 00:39:43,640
I was private
and mostly outgrew it.

715
00:39:43,708 --> 00:39:45,342
I see.

716
00:39:47,311 --> 00:39:49,346
- Dr. Keener...
- call me Dr. Edna.

717
00:39:49,414 --> 00:39:50,580
That's what the kids do.

718
00:39:53,785 --> 00:39:55,552
Of course I know
children do this...

719
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:57,821
But not in public.

720
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,027
I feel like Sally did this

721
00:40:04,095 --> 00:40:06,229
To punish me somehow
for everything.

722
00:40:08,466 --> 00:40:10,767
That must be
a terrible feeling.

723
00:40:10,835 --> 00:40:12,302
It is.

724
00:40:14,839 --> 00:40:16,773
You have to believe me.
I had to get divorced.

725
00:40:19,143 --> 00:40:22,212
I felt it best for them
to have some stability
in their life.

726
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:25,649
In the end,
she doesn't understand
that it'll be better.

727
00:40:28,352 --> 00:40:30,821
Sounds to me
like it wouldn't be bad
for you to talk to someone.

728
00:40:32,657 --> 00:40:34,324
No. No, I'm okay.

729
00:40:36,761 --> 00:40:40,831
Well, I think
it'd be helpful if you and I
were to meet once a month

730
00:40:40,898 --> 00:40:43,700
Just to keep up
with Sally's progress.

731
00:40:43,768 --> 00:40:47,237
Will you tell me what
she talks about in here?

732
00:40:47,305 --> 00:40:48,972
No.

733
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,474
And the other way
around as well.

734
00:40:50,541 --> 00:40:53,710
No, that's better.

735
00:40:53,778 --> 00:40:56,079
So I think we should start
at four days a week.

736
00:40:56,147 --> 00:40:58,415
Let me go get my date book.

737
00:41:29,776 --> 00:41:32,011
- Where's your film?
- What film?

738
00:41:32,078 --> 00:41:33,579
That's how you're shaking it?

739
00:41:33,647 --> 00:41:35,948
- I heard it stunk.
- We didn't make one.

740
00:41:36,016 --> 00:41:38,751
- It's too expensive.
- Well, then you're out
of luck, Donny.

741
00:41:38,819 --> 00:41:41,120
'cause I sure wouldn't
want to follow what
I showed them

742
00:41:41,188 --> 00:41:42,788
With a speech
and a couple of posters.

743
00:41:57,938 --> 00:42:00,806
Sterling Cooper draper Pryce.

744
00:42:00,874 --> 00:42:02,341
Donald draper.

745
00:42:03,777 --> 00:42:05,644
Where is Mr. Cooper

746
00:42:05,712 --> 00:42:07,547
And Mr. Campbell?

747
00:42:07,548 --> 00:42:08,548
And white hair.

748
00:42:08,949 --> 00:42:11,050
- And sterling?
- They couldn't make it.

749
00:42:13,053 --> 00:42:14,820
You created this set of rules

750
00:42:14,888 --> 00:42:16,856
To even the playing field.

751
00:42:16,923 --> 00:42:20,059
It says specifically
no finished work.

752
00:42:22,229 --> 00:42:25,297
I understand not everybody
has observed this.

753
00:42:25,365 --> 00:42:26,799
I don't really
want to be a part

754
00:42:26,867 --> 00:42:28,767
Of a competition like that

755
00:42:28,835 --> 00:42:30,369
So I'm withdrawing us.

756
00:42:31,908 --> 00:42:33,037
What'd he say?

757
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:36,438
He said he is resigning.

758
00:42:36,931 --> 00:42:38,388
You did not honor
your own rules.

759
00:42:47,888 --> 00:42:50,456
Thank you for thinking of us.

760
00:42:50,524 --> 00:42:52,258
Good afternoon.

761
00:43:03,370 --> 00:43:07,106
The voiceover announcer
for lucky has a severe case
of chest congestion.

762
00:43:07,173 --> 00:43:09,074
Get the boy wonder on it.

763
00:43:09,142 --> 00:43:11,410
- Greg, accounts?
- No, Pete.

764
00:43:11,478 --> 00:43:14,680
Have a drink.
It'll make me look younger.

765
00:43:14,748 --> 00:43:18,117
I'm not gonna watch you
feel sorry for yourself.

766
00:43:18,184 --> 00:43:20,152
I feel sorry for all of us.

767
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:22,588
Don's over there
surrendering right now.

768
00:43:22,656 --> 00:43:24,557
Would you stop?

769
00:43:26,993 --> 00:43:29,728
There was a kid
on the destroyer...

770
00:43:29,796 --> 00:43:31,897
P.F.C. Brycen...

771
00:43:31,965 --> 00:43:33,966
And he was
an honest-to-goodness poet.

772
00:43:34,034 --> 00:43:35,834
- And then during...
- Roger.

773
00:43:35,902 --> 00:43:37,603
I don't want to hear it.

774
00:43:37,671 --> 00:43:40,339
My husband's gonna be
in uniform any day now.

775
00:43:40,407 --> 00:43:42,474
How do you think
he's gonna feel

776
00:43:42,542 --> 00:43:46,178
When one day
some Pete Campbell goes
to some Vietnamese doctor?

777
00:43:48,582 --> 00:43:51,050
Since when is forgiveness
a better quality
than loyalty?

778
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:55,454
Roger, I know it was awful

779
00:43:55,522 --> 00:43:59,491
And I know it'll never seem
like it was that long ago,

780
00:43:59,559 --> 00:44:03,062
But you fought
to make the world
a safer place and you won

781
00:44:03,129 --> 00:44:05,130
And now it is.

782
00:44:05,198 --> 00:44:06,966
You think so?

783
00:44:07,033 --> 00:44:08,500
Really?

784
00:44:08,568 --> 00:44:10,002
I have to.

785
00:44:11,838 --> 00:44:13,672
- Anything else?
- No.

786
00:44:22,349 --> 00:44:25,184
Good afternoon.
Your daughter's
psychiatrist called.

787
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:29,421
Lower your voice, please.

788
00:44:41,768 --> 00:44:44,336
<i>- congratulations.</i>

789
00:44:44,404 --> 00:44:46,271
I just spoke
with Mr. Saito.

790
00:44:46,339 --> 00:44:49,208
It seems Honda was never
going to leave Grey,

791
00:44:49,275 --> 00:44:52,745
But of the three princes
invited to meet the princess,

792
00:44:52,812 --> 00:44:54,546
You were the most charming.

793
00:44:54,614 --> 00:44:57,249
We're first in the door
on their little car.

794
00:44:57,317 --> 00:45:00,185
- And c.G.C.?
- Out of the running.

795
00:45:00,253 --> 00:45:01,654
We killed him.

796
00:45:03,456 --> 00:45:06,725
That stunt you pulled
was unseemly.

797
00:45:08,695 --> 00:45:10,663
- The only reason
I let you continue...
- let me?

798
00:45:12,799 --> 00:45:15,267
Do you think Joan
can rent stage space
without talking to me?

799
00:45:17,037 --> 00:45:19,104
I let you

800
00:45:19,172 --> 00:45:21,106
Because I realized
that our financial future

801
00:45:21,174 --> 00:45:23,709
Was related to
Mr. Chaough's demise.

802
00:45:23,777 --> 00:45:25,811
So what is it?

803
00:45:25,879 --> 00:45:28,013
Are you thanking me
or reprimanding me?

804
00:45:28,081 --> 00:45:30,416
Let's not pretend
like this wasn't
a big risk.

805
00:45:30,483 --> 00:45:32,184
We're thanking you.

806
00:45:34,754 --> 00:45:36,488
Send over what
you have on the car.

807
00:45:36,556 --> 00:45:39,858
It redlines at 9,500rpm,

808
00:45:39,926 --> 00:45:42,361
But it only has 57 horsepower.

809
00:45:42,429 --> 00:45:45,864
- What?
- It's a motorcycle
with doors.

810
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,601
The nice thing is
it has windows

811
00:45:49,669 --> 00:45:53,038
So you can see your brains
spatter against it
when it crashes.

812
00:45:53,106 --> 00:45:54,673
They're working on it.

813
00:45:54,741 --> 00:45:56,241
Cheers.

814
00:46:09,155 --> 00:46:10,489
Hello, Sally.

815
00:46:12,759 --> 00:46:14,760
I'm Dr. Edna.

816
00:46:14,828 --> 00:46:16,161
Why don't you come inside?
