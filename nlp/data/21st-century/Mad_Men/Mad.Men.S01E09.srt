<i>Previously on</i> Mad Men.

2
00:00:02,137 --> 00:00:03,956
But you're the new girl and
you're not much

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:05,998
so you might as well
enjoy it while it lasts.

4
00:00:06,386 --> 00:00:07,236
Of course.

5
00:00:07,401 --> 00:00:09,131
You know who else
doesn't wear a hat?

6
00:00:09,324 --> 00:00:10,324
Elvis.

7
00:00:10,698 --> 00:00:12,001
That's what we're dealing with.

8
00:00:12,136 --> 00:00:13,801
Remind me to stop hiring
young people.

9
00:00:14,965 --> 00:00:17,337
My mother passed away, recently.

10
00:00:17,856 --> 00:00:19,096
I guess I already said that.

11
00:00:19,282 --> 00:00:21,266
I am appreciative of
your talents and

12
00:00:21,526 --> 00:00:24,304
I have made an effort to quantify.

13
00:00:24,578 --> 00:00:25,729
Twenty-five hundred dollars.

14
00:00:25,989 --> 00:00:26,990
Dance with me.

15
00:00:27,532 --> 00:00:28,884
I don't like you like this.

Season 1 Episode 9
<i>Shoot</i>

17
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:24,333
Mommy, look at that!

18
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,058
Don Draper!

19
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:05,389
How are you?

20
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:07,033
Probably about like you.

22
00:02:07,195 --> 00:02:09,062
Enduring the splendor of <i>Fiorello!</i>.

24
00:02:10,397 --> 00:02:13,224
You know, we got that
Israeli tourism thing, right?

25
00:02:13,713 --> 00:02:14,713
<i>Mazal tov</i>.

26
00:02:15,477 --> 00:02:17,855
I ran into Jim Jordan from
B.D.O. at the Athletic club

27
00:02:18,586 --> 00:02:21,277
with Frank from Y & R

28
00:02:22,063 --> 00:02:23,263
Your name came up.

29
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,443
Three millionaires in towels
in a steam room.

30
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:29,544
- I don't know how to take that.
- Take it as a compliment,

31
00:02:29,811 --> 00:02:32,406
a sign that you're destined
for greater things.

32
00:02:33,555 --> 00:02:35,776
I think Jesus over Rio was
the best tourist campaign

33
00:02:36,052 --> 00:02:37,485
I've seen in over 20 years.

34
00:02:37,631 --> 00:02:39,404
It wasn't good enough
to land the Israelis.

35
00:02:39,522 --> 00:02:40,530
That's not you.

36
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,943
That's the Tiny store you work in.

37
00:02:43,528 --> 00:02:46,416
Now, if you were with me at McCann,

38
00:02:46,586 --> 00:02:48,619
you'd have over 500 people
at your disposal,

39
00:02:48,873 --> 00:02:50,582
and that's just in New York.

40
00:02:50,842 --> 00:02:52,417
We can get a lot of things done.

41
00:02:52,677 --> 00:02:55,294
Can it get me out of the second half
of this show?

42
00:02:55,679 --> 00:02:58,547
All I'm saying is you've done
your time in the farm leagues.

43
00:02:59,184 --> 00:03:00,884
Yankee stadium is on the line.

44
00:03:01,491 --> 00:03:02,853
I changed my mind.

45
00:03:03,118 --> 00:03:05,114
I decided you deserve
a visit to the bar.

46
00:03:05,276 --> 00:03:07,074
Adele, this is Donald Draper.

47
00:03:07,251 --> 00:03:08,802
- How do you do?
- If we're being introduced,

48
00:03:08,965 --> 00:03:10,832
I assume that you're in advertising.

49
00:03:11,018 --> 00:03:13,031
Would you both like to talk
about that some more?

50
00:03:13,172 --> 00:03:14,498
Betty, my wife.

51
00:03:15,168 --> 00:03:16,413
Jim and Adele Hobart.

52
00:03:16,623 --> 00:03:18,332
Hello, Betty Draper.

53
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:19,558
Pleasure.

54
00:03:19,762 --> 00:03:21,306
Your husband here was about to prove

55
00:03:21,447 --> 00:03:24,124
that he can speak about things
other than advertising.

56
00:03:24,975 --> 00:03:26,159
He's very interesting.

57
00:03:26,567 --> 00:03:28,023
Well, then, come with me.

58
00:03:28,255 --> 00:03:29,675
Let's get those drinks.

59
00:03:29,935 --> 00:03:30,999
We'll be back.

60
00:03:31,206 --> 00:03:32,040
Champagne?

61
00:03:41,559 --> 00:03:44,089
Besides getting the handsome prince,
are you...

62
00:03:44,336 --> 00:03:45,757
an actress or something?

63
00:03:46,157 --> 00:03:47,919
No, I'm a housewife.

64
00:03:49,389 --> 00:03:51,843
I did do some modeling

65
00:03:52,835 --> 00:03:53,927
a lifetime ago.

66
00:03:54,309 --> 00:03:55,651
I'm not surprised.

67
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,970
That is some face you've got there.

68
00:03:58,309 --> 00:04:01,475
Anybody ever tell you you're
a dead ringer for Grace Kelly?

69
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,997
They used to.

70
00:04:04,102 --> 00:04:05,241
You know what?

71
00:04:06,697 --> 00:04:08,418
<i>Coca-Cola</i> is deep into this,

72
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,646
international campaign right now.

73
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,242
A european face like yours,
like Grace Kelly's,

74
00:04:14,525 --> 00:04:16,544
might be a road we could go down.

75
00:04:18,139 --> 00:04:20,881
We could put a call out for
a Grace Kelly type but...

76
00:04:21,141 --> 00:04:23,634
I don't think we'd come this close.

77
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:25,552
You say you've modeled?

78
00:04:26,286 --> 00:04:27,220
I'm retired.

79
00:04:30,055 --> 00:04:32,121
- This is silly.
- Think about it.

80
00:04:32,491 --> 00:04:35,274
Your coloring with a green bottle
and an irish setter.

81
00:04:37,517 --> 00:04:38,732
Drink up.

82
00:04:39,172 --> 00:04:40,901
It's back to <i>Tammany</i>* hall.

83
00:04:41,194 --> 00:04:42,521
I like this show.

84
00:04:42,811 --> 00:04:44,004
Very gay songs.

85
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:46,929
Well, we'd better get back in there...

86
00:04:47,152 --> 00:04:48,186
Or leave.

87
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:50,088
Come on.

88
00:04:50,605 --> 00:04:52,537
It was very nice meeting
both of you.

89
00:04:53,322 --> 00:04:54,374
Good evening.

90
00:05:12,373 --> 00:05:14,873
Why didn't you want to go to
dinner with Jim and Adele?

91
00:05:16,912 --> 00:05:18,978
People like Jim Hobart
always talk business

92
00:05:19,205 --> 00:05:21,670
because they have
nothing else to say.

93
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:24,573
I could see that.

94
00:05:25,572 --> 00:05:27,030
You know, he gave me his card.

95
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:28,561
Really?

96
00:05:28,936 --> 00:05:31,179
Tell you to put it under
my pillow or something?

97
00:05:31,685 --> 00:05:32,807
No, actually.

98
00:05:34,009 --> 00:05:35,747
He was talking to me about modeling.

99
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,250
Was he?

100
00:05:39,636 --> 00:05:41,441
I don't think it was like that.

101
00:05:41,738 --> 00:05:44,696
He said something about
Grace Kelly and <i>Coca-Cola</i>.

102
00:05:46,874 --> 00:05:50,555
Well, then there's no need
to doubt his interest then.

103
00:05:51,749 --> 00:05:53,071
I did model, Don.

104
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:56,768
Am I that wrong for <i>Coca-Cola</i>?

105
00:06:01,204 --> 00:06:02,566
You're not wrong for anything.

106
00:06:04,374 --> 00:06:06,417
So, are you going to go there?

107
00:06:18,312 --> 00:06:20,667
How was <i>Fiorello</i> exclamation point?

108
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,852
It'll be six months before

109
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,400
I can get Don back into
a broadway theater.

110
00:06:28,143 --> 00:06:30,327
We ran into this agency head.

111
00:06:31,315 --> 00:06:33,138
Apparently, he's courting Don.

112
00:06:33,627 --> 00:06:34,902
He gave me his card.

113
00:06:35,127 --> 00:06:36,945
Asked me if I wanted to
do any modeling.

114
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:39,099
That's a heck of a line.
what did Don say?

115
00:06:39,337 --> 00:06:41,826
He basically said the man was
trying to sleep with one of us,

116
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:43,564
and he didn't like
the idea of either.

117
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,151
I did do some modeling, you know.

118
00:06:49,395 --> 00:06:51,590
I did not know, but
I'm not surprised.

119
00:06:51,813 --> 00:06:53,867
Carlton calls you Grace Kelly.

120
00:06:54,564 --> 00:06:56,451
Yeah, I was a model when I met Don.

121
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,598
A model in Manhattan?

122
00:06:58,813 --> 00:06:59,813
Yes.

123
00:07:00,376 --> 00:07:01,792
It was exciting.

124
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,387
But when I got started,

125
00:07:05,184 --> 00:07:06,720
the summer after college in Italy.

126
00:07:06,966 --> 00:07:08,023
Italy?

127
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,081
There was this Italian designer.

128
00:07:10,374 --> 00:07:11,374
Giovanni.

129
00:07:13,253 --> 00:07:15,038
He wanted to be called Johnny.

130
00:07:15,532 --> 00:07:17,223
That's how much he loved Americans.

131
00:07:17,421 --> 00:07:19,184
Well, he loved American girls.

132
00:07:19,531 --> 00:07:22,161
It was more of an artist/muse
relationship.

133
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:36,294
So, he made you all this
and it was platonic?

134
00:07:37,313 --> 00:07:38,835
No petting? Nothing?

135
00:07:44,247 --> 00:07:46,067
Then put my hair up like this.

136
00:07:53,109 --> 00:07:55,079
And Salvatore said he had
the Menkens' artwork,

137
00:07:55,236 --> 00:07:56,288
but to meet him in
the Art department

138
00:07:56,425 --> 00:07:57,681
because you're' going to
need a red pencil.

139
00:07:57,796 --> 00:07:59,141
Any other good news?

140
00:07:59,987 --> 00:08:02,936
I think the mail boy dropped
that off for you last night.

141
00:08:22,217 --> 00:08:24,040
<i>Welcome to the club. Call me. Jim.</i>

142
00:08:27,123 --> 00:08:28,685
Peggy, can you get me
an outside line?

143
00:08:28,987 --> 00:08:29,987
<i>Right away.</i>

144
00:08:32,603 --> 00:08:34,718
Now, why would you call me
out of the blue?

145
00:08:35,797 --> 00:08:37,163
I appreciate the gesture.

146
00:08:37,425 --> 00:08:38,889
<i>It's not a gesture, Don.</i>

147
00:08:39,149 --> 00:08:40,469
It's an overture.

148
00:08:40,834 --> 00:08:43,518
Let me tell you, you're
a hard man to run into.

149
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:44,935
I don't know what to say.

150
00:08:45,113 --> 00:08:46,187
<i>Don't say anything.</i>

151
00:08:46,447 --> 00:08:48,154
The next step is a quiet rendezvous.

152
00:08:48,425 --> 00:08:49,608
The <i>Algonquin</i>?

153
00:08:49,922 --> 00:08:51,479
<i>There's a small hotel.</i>

154
00:08:51,778 --> 00:08:53,175
<i>Isn't that the song?</i>

155
00:08:54,924 --> 00:08:56,023
I don't know.

156
00:08:57,299 --> 00:08:59,242
I'm not ready to wave
the flag just yet.

157
00:08:59,611 --> 00:09:01,119
What about the details?

158
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:04,873
I'd rather do this face to face.

159
00:09:05,985 --> 00:09:08,093
But you already know
what you're gonna say.

160
00:09:12,987 --> 00:09:14,964
I don't have to tell you
the obvious limitations

161
00:09:15,161 --> 00:09:16,509
of <i>Sterling-Cooper</i>.

162
00:09:16,769 --> 00:09:17,964
But you're going to.

163
00:09:18,238 --> 00:09:19,472
<i>Do I need to be careful here?</i>

164
00:09:19,613 --> 00:09:20,764
<i>It's a mom and pop.</i>

165
00:09:21,487 --> 00:09:23,896
<i>McCann-Erickson</i> is
an international company.

166
00:09:24,175 --> 00:09:26,811
We have a network that extends
far beyond Madison avenue.

167
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:29,206
<i>Europe, south America.<i>

168
00:09:30,049 --> 00:09:32,099
<i>We're publicly traded.
We issue dividends.</i>

169
00:09:32,517 --> 00:09:33,797
Small is bad.

170
00:09:34,871 --> 00:09:37,264
Do you know the kind of
clients we attract?

171
00:09:37,567 --> 00:09:38,740
Pan Am, Coca-Cola,

172
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,809
<i>Esso.</i>

173
00:09:40,049 --> 00:09:41,235
<i>Can you imagine the lifestyle</i>

174
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,091
that goes with handling Pan Am?

175
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,746
It's a panty dropper.

176
00:09:45,425 --> 00:09:46,425
<i>Television?</i>

177
00:09:46,575 --> 00:09:48,760
<i>You could be in that in
a bigger way. You know that.</i>

178
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:51,628
<i>But you want to sell corn,
we do a show about Indians.</i>

179
00:09:52,173 --> 00:09:54,360
Imagine yourself in
a three year contract,

180
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,459
35 per antum, security set in stone.

181
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,455
Sterling probably hasn't let
you break 30 yet.

182
00:09:59,737 --> 00:10:00,737
No comment.

183
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:03,640
<i>I really don't like doing
this over the phone.</i>

184
00:10:04,845 --> 00:10:07,522
All I can say is eventually
you come up here

185
00:10:07,737 --> 00:10:09,312
or you die wondering.

186
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:18,029
He gave me his card
right in front of Don.

187
00:10:19,239 --> 00:10:22,185
Well, not right in
front of him, I guess.

188
00:10:22,795 --> 00:10:25,145
Well, I told Don about it.

189
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:28,928
I was a model, you know?

190
00:10:30,924 --> 00:10:33,304
In fact, I met Don on a photo shoot.

191
00:10:34,264 --> 00:10:37,666
I was wearing this
Russian blue fox coat.

192
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:42,512
He was just a copywriter
at the fur company.

193
00:10:44,737 --> 00:10:48,125
I remember he saw that
I didn't like giving the coat back.

194
00:10:49,241 --> 00:10:51,096
That's always the hardest part.

195
00:10:52,927 --> 00:10:54,284
He asked me out.

196
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:56,951
He wasn't shy.

197
00:10:57,175 --> 00:10:58,250
I liked that.

198
00:10:59,517 --> 00:11:00,551
I said no.

199
00:11:01,949 --> 00:11:04,485
Then, three weeks later
the coat arrived at my apartment.

200
00:11:06,587 --> 00:11:09,910
Who knows what kind of Indian
trading he had to do to get it.

201
00:11:11,239 --> 00:11:14,009
I think I only had two more jobs,

202
00:11:14,543 --> 00:11:17,256
maybe three, before we got engaged.

203
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:21,605
And then I got pregnant.

204
00:11:23,488 --> 00:11:26,371
It's always a nightmare raising
children in manhattan,

205
00:11:26,642 --> 00:11:28,521
so we moved to ossing.

206
00:11:32,176 --> 00:11:33,185
Suddenly,

207
00:11:34,665 --> 00:11:36,520
I really felt so old.

208
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:39,363
Tell me more about that.

209
00:11:39,864 --> 00:11:43,147
My mother was very concerned
about looks and weight.

210
00:11:45,928 --> 00:11:47,809
And I've always eaten a lot.

211
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,186
And I like hot dogs.

212
00:11:54,176 --> 00:11:55,394
My mother used to say,

213
00:11:56,403 --> 00:11:58,671
"you're going to get stout."

214
00:12:01,364 --> 00:12:02,951
and then I became a model,

215
00:12:03,808 --> 00:12:05,534
and she hated it.

216
00:12:06,554 --> 00:12:09,769
Even though Suzy Parker
made $100,000 that year,

217
00:12:11,028 --> 00:12:12,589
my mother hated it.

218
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:14,866
Manhattan.

219
00:12:19,301 --> 00:12:21,276
She called me a prostitute.

220
00:12:22,462 --> 00:12:23,696
You're angry at your mother.

221
00:12:25,669 --> 00:12:26,669
What?

222
00:12:27,923 --> 00:12:29,202
Are you going to talk now?

223
00:12:29,545 --> 00:12:31,246
You are angry at your mother.

224
00:12:31,457 --> 00:12:33,604
Of all the things I've said in here!

225
00:12:35,107 --> 00:12:36,501
You're sitting up.

226
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,497
You don't listen to me.

227
00:12:40,607 --> 00:12:41,946
You don't listen to what I say,

228
00:12:42,099 --> 00:12:43,716
and then out of nowhere
you provoke me.

229
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:47,788
Tell me more about that.

230
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:57,199
I miss her.

231
00:12:59,797 --> 00:13:01,401
I understand that.

232
00:13:04,609 --> 00:13:06,142
It's good and bad.

233
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:18,421
She wanted me to be beautiful
so I could find a man.

234
00:13:20,487 --> 00:13:22,341
There's nothing wrong with that.

235
00:13:26,171 --> 00:13:27,411
But then what?

236
00:13:29,111 --> 00:13:30,221
Just sit and

237
00:13:31,229 --> 00:13:32,532
smoke and...

238
00:13:33,673 --> 00:13:36,009
Let it go until you're in a box?

239
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:42,734
I don't care why
he gave me his card.

240
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,800
Where'd you get this?

241
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,750
Kurt teasdale over at Guild Bascom.

242
00:14:15,985 --> 00:14:18,375
It's already on the air. They wanted
to do it before she had the baby.

243
00:14:18,571 --> 00:14:19,655
Am I the alone?

244
00:14:19,927 --> 00:14:20,939
I don't understand it.

245
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:22,837
Because it's in Spanish.

246
00:14:23,925 --> 00:14:25,743
I recognize that finishing
school voice.

247
00:14:25,913 --> 00:14:27,737
You can't govern and
listen to that all day.

248
00:14:28,361 --> 00:14:31,064
I'm happy to give up any Spanish
speakers and hope this goes away.

249
00:14:31,217 --> 00:14:33,800
Well, Cooper thinks if Kennedy
creeps up any more in the polls,

250
00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:36,346
Nixon will panic and they'll get
desperate for our efforts.

251
00:14:36,486 --> 00:14:37,895
He wants everything in place.

252
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,110
More risk.

253
00:14:39,675 --> 00:14:41,876
Why are we doing this again,
and out of pocket?

254
00:14:42,136 --> 00:14:44,158
One don't question
the wishes of our clients.

255
00:14:44,371 --> 00:14:45,632
Clients come and go, Campbell.

256
00:14:45,773 --> 00:14:48,800
Sometimes it's best to rid them
of unrealistic expectations.

257
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,867
Are you trying to say
that we can't win?

258
00:14:51,078 --> 00:14:52,932
Nixon's got an eight point
lead in the polls.

259
00:14:53,193 --> 00:14:54,237
Not much.

260
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,851
And we still haven't figured
out a way to make an impact

261
00:14:55,974 --> 00:14:57,536
about the Nxon campaign's involvement.

262
00:14:57,659 --> 00:15:00,113
My marching orders were
undecided states.

263
00:15:00,424 --> 00:15:02,414
I think a plan of attack
would make Coop happy.

264
00:15:02,576 --> 00:15:04,599
The 50-50's. Texas,
New Jersey, and Illinois.

265
00:15:04,786 --> 00:15:07,006
No- it's easy to just
say that, isn't it?

266
00:15:07,236 --> 00:15:08,882
I think women will hate her.

267
00:15:09,111 --> 00:15:11,793
It's like their better looking sister
marries a handsome senator

268
00:15:11,988 --> 00:15:13,855
and she's going to live
in the White House.

269
00:15:14,051 --> 00:15:15,284
I'm practically jealous.

270
00:15:24,558 --> 00:15:25,580
Hi.

271
00:15:26,549 --> 00:15:27,624
I called.

272
00:15:27,905 --> 00:15:30,112
I assumed you were staying
in the city.

273
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,364
The girl.

274
00:15:32,051 --> 00:15:34,924
We gave her a little extra work
and now she's distracted.

275
00:15:36,147 --> 00:15:37,438
Look at that.

276
00:15:39,903 --> 00:15:41,185
It's raw, Don.

277
00:15:45,614 --> 00:15:47,233
Don, I realized something today.

278
00:15:50,927 --> 00:15:52,390
I miss modeling.

279
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:55,146
You always told me you hated it.

280
00:15:55,365 --> 00:15:58,953
Maybe the passing of time
has made me feel differently.

281
00:16:00,301 --> 00:16:01,748
Maybe it's Jim Hobart.

282
00:16:02,237 --> 00:16:03,237
So what?

283
00:16:03,986 --> 00:16:05,691
It's still an opportunity.

284
00:16:06,489 --> 00:16:07,818
You want to go back to work?

285
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,048
A few days. I mean, is that so bad?

286
00:16:10,551 --> 00:16:11,967
I get paid.

287
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:14,289
I can get ethel to watch the kids.

288
00:16:14,551 --> 00:16:16,471
She watches them half the time now.

289
00:16:16,731 --> 00:16:19,223
Well, that's three four-hour stretches.

290
00:16:20,676 --> 00:16:23,227
I think it would be fun to go in
and be that girl again.

291
00:16:24,115 --> 00:16:25,605
You're serious?

292
00:16:27,466 --> 00:16:29,051
There will still be ham.

293
00:16:29,549 --> 00:16:30,549
I promise.

294
00:16:32,537 --> 00:16:33,969
Are you resolved?

295
00:16:34,362 --> 00:16:36,243
Is this even worth arguing?

296
00:16:36,904 --> 00:16:38,630
No, it's not like that.

297
00:16:40,549 --> 00:16:43,493
It's just something I'd like to do.

298
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:51,089
Well, I can't stop you from
doing what you want to do.

299
00:17:07,951 --> 00:17:09,982
You have no idea how boring
it is around here.

300
00:17:10,325 --> 00:17:11,325
Really?

301
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:14,078
I would think one hour on
the <i>Sterling-Cooper</i> switchboard

302
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:15,300
would be a Russian novel.

303
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:18,923
They told me it would happen, but the
truth is you really just stop listening.

304
00:17:19,139 --> 00:17:20,618
And put ice on your wrists.

305
00:17:28,561 --> 00:17:30,522
Peggy, do you need to go home?

306
00:17:30,764 --> 00:17:31,764
What?

307
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,103
The sweater.

308
00:17:33,698 --> 00:17:35,053
Are you having one of those days?

309
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:36,364
It's not that.

310
00:17:36,665 --> 00:17:38,743
I'd like to go home,
but I just don't think I can.

311
00:17:39,014 --> 00:17:40,014
Then what is it?

312
00:17:40,578 --> 00:17:42,336
You're not helping your silhouette.

313
00:17:44,497 --> 00:17:45,941
I ripped my skirt.

314
00:17:46,452 --> 00:17:48,304
You don't have a needle and thread?

315
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:49,522
It's a big rip.

316
00:17:50,674 --> 00:17:51,484
Honey.

317
00:17:52,017 --> 00:17:54,776
I've got a spare outfit squirreled
away. You can borrow it.

318
00:18:06,493 --> 00:18:08,089
Not exactly dressed for that, are we?

319
00:18:08,264 --> 00:18:09,943
I've lost men like you before,

320
00:18:10,326 --> 00:18:13,481
and usually it had to do with
my unexpressed confidence.

321
00:18:13,775 --> 00:18:15,673
I think you're one in
a million, Draper.

322
00:18:17,906 --> 00:18:19,216
Those are nice clubs.

323
00:18:19,652 --> 00:18:22,070
That bonus from Cooper
must've made you happy.

324
00:18:22,438 --> 00:18:25,141
It was designed as a kind of an
armor against men like Jim Hobart.

325
00:18:28,158 --> 00:18:29,520
How'd you hear about it?

326
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:37,069
I saw those clubs going down the
hallway. I thought they were for me.

327
00:18:37,594 --> 00:18:39,243
They're from Jim Hobart.

328
00:18:41,722 --> 00:18:43,079
What did he offer?

329
00:18:45,344 --> 00:18:46,344
Bigger.

330
00:18:47,954 --> 00:18:49,769
The world, basically.

331
00:18:50,593 --> 00:18:54,045
It can't just be a number and a salary
because you know we're open to that.

332
00:18:54,452 --> 00:18:55,452
Pan Am.

333
00:18:55,766 --> 00:18:56,766
Pan Am?

334
00:18:59,203 --> 00:19:00,920
It is not McCann-Erickson.

335
00:19:02,535 --> 00:19:05,473
Big talent attracts big clients.
We can try and make that happen here.

336
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:07,405
That's true.

337
00:19:07,564 --> 00:19:09,877
But don't be fooled. You hear
Pan Am you imagine London,

338
00:19:10,009 --> 00:19:12,096
holed up at the <i>Dorchester</i>
with three stewardesses.

339
00:19:12,307 --> 00:19:15,219
The truth is it's more like
a 20-hour boomerang flight

340
00:19:15,395 --> 00:19:17,193
so you can make a coupon sing
in Spanish.

341
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:20,762
And when you have stockholders
like McCann does

342
00:19:20,998 --> 00:19:23,616
you can't fire clients,
I know you'll hate that.

343
00:19:28,207 --> 00:19:29,830
I thought about leaving once.

344
00:19:31,984 --> 00:19:33,053
But, you know,

345
00:19:34,638 --> 00:19:35,586
it's daunting.

346
00:19:36,393 --> 00:19:38,688
Why entertain the prospect
of failure?

347
00:19:38,955 --> 00:19:40,633
- That's a sad thought.
- No,

348
00:19:40,893 --> 00:19:42,608
made me look at this place.

349
00:19:43,972 --> 00:19:47,265
I don't want to sound sentimental,
but it's not just accounts.

350
00:19:48,022 --> 00:19:50,226
Look around here at what you have.

351
00:19:52,142 --> 00:19:53,562
You want to start over?

352
00:19:56,706 --> 00:19:58,482
I haven't made up my mind.

353
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:07,326
- I'm taking this very personally.
- Why?

354
00:20:08,391 --> 00:20:09,607
It's business.

355
00:20:10,269 --> 00:20:11,269
Is it?

356
00:20:17,079 --> 00:20:18,713
Mccann-Erickson is
the major leagues.

357
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:21,001
- Good. let him go.
- You're right.

358
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:24,124
- Maybe he'll take me with him.
- Can you imagine the money?

359
00:20:24,392 --> 00:20:26,262
I heard he's making 30 already.

360
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,556
He's not ten times better than me.

361
00:20:30,205 --> 00:20:31,374
You love him.

362
00:20:31,894 --> 00:20:33,102
Everybody loves him.

363
00:20:33,362 --> 00:20:35,403
Sure, his moods and
the way he talks.

364
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,575
I don't even know what
he's saying half the time.

365
00:20:37,704 --> 00:20:38,843
Clients do.

366
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:50,119
I'll admit, she crossed
my mind once.

367
00:20:51,207 --> 00:20:53,538
She's having a very bad
freshman year.

368
00:20:53,767 --> 00:20:55,117
They went nuts for her writing.

369
00:20:55,294 --> 00:20:56,834
Belle Jolie, she did that.

370
00:20:57,094 --> 00:21:00,138
Belle Jolie was okay.
She obviously let it go to her head,

371
00:21:00,393 --> 00:21:01,393
and other places.

372
00:21:01,769 --> 00:21:03,494
Naw, I don't think it's the job.

373
00:21:03,768 --> 00:21:05,134
I think we're seeing the real her.

374
00:21:05,568 --> 00:21:08,058
It's one of those girls who slimmed
down before she got here.

375
00:21:08,188 --> 00:21:10,765
Now she's here and there she is.

376
00:21:11,025 --> 00:21:12,303
Who thinks about her?

377
00:21:12,518 --> 00:21:14,060
Maybe she'll go with Draper too.

378
00:21:14,456 --> 00:21:15,895
It's a tragedy.

379
00:21:16,324 --> 00:21:18,191
A piece of fruit that went real bad

380
00:21:18,908 --> 00:21:19,917
real fast,

381
00:21:20,535 --> 00:21:22,151
and no one ever got to eat it.

382
00:21:23,394 --> 00:21:25,613
Well, I got some work to do.

383
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:28,427
Suddenly, upon news of other success

384
00:21:28,644 --> 00:21:30,576
a young man is filled with ambition.

385
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:31,977
Drop dead.

386
00:21:32,645 --> 00:21:34,872
Harry, you busy?

387
00:21:50,396 --> 00:21:52,206
Well, hello. I can't believe this.

388
00:21:54,668 --> 00:21:57,944
I'm sorry I overdid it.

389
00:21:58,956 --> 00:22:01,399
You're out of the business a
few years and things change.

390
00:22:01,956 --> 00:22:04,398
Please, I'm overwhelmed
with the style of you.

391
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:06,318
Betty draper meet Ronnie Gittridge.

392
00:22:06,584 --> 00:22:09,448
He handles the art for Coca-Cola.
He's also my brother-in-law.

393
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:12,284
- It is a pleasure.
- Look at her.

394
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,787
- What did I say?
- You ready to work?

395
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:18,290
- I'm excited.
- It's not that complicated.

396
00:22:18,581 --> 00:22:20,283
He's either gonna tell you
to think about

397
00:22:20,447 --> 00:22:21,868
something else or just stand there.

398
00:22:22,109 --> 00:22:24,445
Jim thinks everyone
else's job is easy.

399
00:22:25,398 --> 00:22:26,443
Shall we.

400
00:22:28,251 --> 00:22:29,742
It's just a tryout.

401
00:22:30,334 --> 00:22:31,339
No guarantees.

402
00:22:31,896 --> 00:22:33,848
I told you, I've done this before.

403
00:22:34,706 --> 00:22:37,051
Now, where did you get that dress?

404
00:22:38,779 --> 00:22:40,645
So, basically, whereas
<i>Secor</i> previously

405
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:42,700
spent their money on
local print and radio,

406
00:22:42,951 --> 00:22:46,360
we increase the network buy to 30%,
more points for each dollar.

407
00:22:46,645 --> 00:22:48,296
<i>Secor</i> laxatives.

408
00:22:49,771 --> 00:22:51,477
You know, I have to talk
to those people.

409
00:22:51,715 --> 00:22:53,089
They're not what you would expect.

410
00:22:53,253 --> 00:22:56,120
They have absolutely no sense
of humor about their product.

411
00:22:57,086 --> 00:23:00,867
Who knew that college was gonna get
me out of the army and into laxatives?

412
00:23:01,211 --> 00:23:02,875
College was the moment, wasn't it?

413
00:23:03,546 --> 00:23:04,595
Fun and games,

414
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:06,464
and girls.

415
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,285
Were you in a frat?

416
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,217
Alpha Delta Phi.

417
00:23:10,576 --> 00:23:13,323
Also known as cut ups.

418
00:23:14,209 --> 00:23:15,560
We were the cut ups.

419
00:23:16,856 --> 00:23:19,533
We had this stray dalmatian,

420
00:23:19,956 --> 00:23:21,377
our mascot, Mamie.

421
00:23:21,988 --> 00:23:25,983
So, it died, and in classic fraternity
manner we decided to throw a party.

422
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:27,542
Mamie's funeral.

423
00:23:28,021 --> 00:23:30,863
One of the pledges pipes
in that our rivals, si-u.

424
00:23:31,395 --> 00:23:32,611
They are so gung ho.

425
00:23:32,936 --> 00:23:35,190
Si-u is throwing a beauty pageant
parade on main street

426
00:23:35,355 --> 00:23:37,409
with the girl school down the road.

427
00:23:37,752 --> 00:23:40,006
Now, my friend, Chip,
he's a lawyer now, says,

428
00:23:40,194 --> 00:23:42,490
"why don't we go down there
and get a permit,"

429
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:46,253
"throw a grand funeral for Mamie,
and let the girls run away crying?"

430
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:48,592
that's great.

431
00:23:48,995 --> 00:23:50,099
Did you do it?

432
00:23:50,296 --> 00:23:53,466
We had police barricades and
30 brothers following that pledge

433
00:23:53,652 --> 00:23:55,888
who had the honor of pulling
Mamie in a radio flyer.

434
00:23:56,256 --> 00:23:57,611
That's beautiful.

435
00:23:58,657 --> 00:23:59,779
Idiots.

436
00:24:01,592 --> 00:24:02,714
Wait a minute.

437
00:24:06,714 --> 00:24:10,774
Nixon and Kennedy are both buying up
airtime in these undecided states.

438
00:24:12,342 --> 00:24:13,405
It's an arms race.

439
00:24:13,665 --> 00:24:15,632
Nixon buys, Kennedy matches.

440
00:24:15,877 --> 00:24:18,977
So, if we can't increase Nixon's
presence, we can decrease Kennedy's.

441
00:24:19,281 --> 00:24:20,490
How do we that?

442
00:24:20,978 --> 00:24:23,878
We make big buys in New Jersey,
Illinois, and wherever

443
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:25,780
for <i>Secor</i> laxatives.

444
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,706
Well, hold on.

445
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:31,257
- So, Nixon's selling laxatives?
- No.

446
00:24:32,391 --> 00:24:35,408
We're selling laxatives,
Nixon's selling Nixon,

447
00:24:35,842 --> 00:24:38,264
and Kennedy's watching
Mamie's funeral.

448
00:24:41,218 --> 00:24:42,059
This is scary.

449
00:24:43,735 --> 00:24:45,813
It is, isn't it?

450
00:25:03,243 --> 00:25:04,248
It was for me.

451
00:25:07,015 --> 00:25:08,015
Who was it?

452
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:12,256
I'm the girl, the girl with the Cola.

453
00:25:15,122 --> 00:25:16,718
It's only a couple of days work.

454
00:25:17,004 --> 00:25:20,306
You know, just a couple of photo shoots
and then some kind of testing.

455
00:25:20,566 --> 00:25:22,618
But I guess you know how it works.

456
00:25:23,004 --> 00:25:24,004
I do.

457
00:25:27,315 --> 00:25:29,546
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna ruin this.

458
00:25:30,068 --> 00:25:31,358
I'm very happy for you.

459
00:25:53,379 --> 00:25:55,027
I know you don't like it,

460
00:25:56,876 --> 00:26:00,058
but I know you're
a little bit proud of me.

461
00:26:07,331 --> 00:26:09,304
- Come upstairs.
- No.

462
00:26:11,564 --> 00:26:12,564
Right here.

463
00:26:16,877 --> 00:26:17,877
Okay.

464
00:26:48,259 --> 00:26:49,515
How are these open already?

465
00:26:49,757 --> 00:26:52,352
Well, Betty, we don't want life
to look difficult, now do we?

466
00:26:55,877 --> 00:26:56,877
You're too much.

467
00:27:22,447 --> 00:27:24,502
- Polly, no!
- Let her go.

468
00:27:31,755 --> 00:27:34,732
If I see that dog in my yard again,
I'm gonna shoot it.

469
00:27:49,568 --> 00:27:51,665
I see you got there and
back in one piece.

470
00:27:52,129 --> 00:27:53,129
Yes.

471
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:56,548
And even though I got lost,
I sent Ethel home at four.

472
00:27:58,881 --> 00:28:00,174
They went to the park

473
00:28:00,434 --> 00:28:01,842
and to visit Ernie at Francine's.

474
00:28:02,302 --> 00:28:04,219
All in all, everyone had a nice day.

475
00:28:05,178 --> 00:28:06,472
So, how was it?

476
00:28:06,732 --> 00:28:09,475
There was this man, Ronnie.
I don't even know what his job is.

477
00:28:10,115 --> 00:28:12,436
Ronnie Gittridge.
He's the art director... I met him.

478
00:28:12,706 --> 00:28:14,231
He is such a character.

479
00:28:14,488 --> 00:28:16,278
He tells funny stories.

480
00:28:16,666 --> 00:28:18,345
I brought the form home.

481
00:28:18,677 --> 00:28:21,487
I thought you could help me fill
it out so I can get paid.

482
00:28:22,613 --> 00:28:23,829
I'd love to.

483
00:28:39,115 --> 00:28:40,519
Sweetie pie?

484
00:28:41,117 --> 00:28:42,174
What happened?

485
00:28:42,428 --> 00:28:43,738
I had a bad dream.

486
00:28:46,147 --> 00:28:47,645
Get in bed with daddy.

487
00:28:55,338 --> 00:28:56,742
What was your dream?

488
00:28:57,025 --> 00:28:59,487
I don't want anyone to shoot Polly.

489
00:29:01,693 --> 00:29:03,310
No one's gonna do that, honey.

490
00:29:03,625 --> 00:29:07,199
Yes, mr. Ford said he would
because Polly ate

491
00:29:07,459 --> 00:29:08,709
one of his doves.

492
00:29:09,463 --> 00:29:10,867
They're pigeons.

493
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,542
He said this to you in your dream?

494
00:29:13,991 --> 00:29:16,917
No. He said it today when
Polly ate the birdie.

495
00:29:17,382 --> 00:29:20,212
He wasn't hurt that bad.
He could fly.

496
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,580
No one is gonna hurt Polly.

497
00:29:28,145 --> 00:29:29,150
Come here.

498
00:29:29,988 --> 00:29:31,087
Night-night.

499
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,859
Now they can't play in the yard?

500
00:29:48,654 --> 00:29:51,503
I'm gonna get my robe on and go over
there and find out what happened.

501
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:52,980
Two in the morning.

502
00:29:53,408 --> 00:29:55,732
He's our neighbor.
He'll make it worse.

503
00:29:56,651 --> 00:29:57,985
I'll talk to him.

504
00:29:58,718 --> 00:30:00,789
You should have Ethel talk to him.

505
00:30:01,763 --> 00:30:03,797
Don, they play in the yard
when I'm here too.

506
00:30:04,057 --> 00:30:05,403
And she didn't tell you?

507
00:30:05,632 --> 00:30:07,528
I'm sure they didn't tell her.

508
00:30:08,432 --> 00:30:11,004
They probably wouldn't
have told me either.

509
00:30:12,772 --> 00:30:15,726
They'll be over at Francine's
for the next shoot anyway.

510
00:30:15,986 --> 00:30:17,206
It's one day.

511
00:30:19,226 --> 00:30:20,987
I'm sure it wasn't that bad.

512
00:30:24,769 --> 00:30:25,769
Maybe not.

513
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,074
She's never slept well.

514
00:30:32,708 --> 00:30:34,053
That's not true.

515
00:30:37,646 --> 00:30:39,668
Did you see those big tears?

516
00:30:42,146 --> 00:30:45,064
I really want to get a picture
of her crying one day.

517
00:30:49,327 --> 00:30:53,347
I have to say, Don, <i>Lucky Strike</i> even
in this lawsuit is stronger than ever.

518
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:55,111
It was a brilliant campaign.

519
00:30:55,407 --> 00:30:58,644
Like some supersonic jet
flying right over the market.

520
00:31:04,949 --> 00:31:06,764
I was there. Great work.

521
00:31:08,763 --> 00:31:09,763
Thank you.

522
00:31:10,322 --> 00:31:12,511
Sorry to interrupt
who is responsible?

523
00:31:15,137 --> 00:31:17,217
We've made a significant
commitment for as yet

524
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:19,164
unproduced <i>Secor</i> laxative
commercials.

525
00:31:19,424 --> 00:31:20,449
This didn't go by me.

526
00:31:20,674 --> 00:31:23,543
No. It went by Bob Wilkins
in media right to me.

527
00:31:23,778 --> 00:31:25,587
Who is responsible?

528
00:31:28,422 --> 00:31:30,926
Mr. Cooper sir, it was me.

529
00:31:31,186 --> 00:31:32,683
You thought of this?

530
00:31:33,887 --> 00:31:34,887
Well...

531
00:31:35,449 --> 00:31:37,516
I bear some of
the responsibility as well.

532
00:31:37,776 --> 00:31:38,700
What did they do?

533
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:41,535
Every commercial block on air

534
00:31:42,683 --> 00:31:45,313
in the land of Lincoln is
clogged up with

535
00:31:46,051 --> 00:31:48,193
laxative buys.

536
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:51,734
And a little bit of Nixon time.

537
00:31:52,275 --> 00:31:56,290
The Kennedy people won't know
what to do with themselves.

538
00:31:56,949 --> 00:31:59,454
They're going to have
to put his pretty face

539
00:31:59,714 --> 00:32:01,081
on the radio,

540
00:32:01,575 --> 00:32:03,090
and with that accent.

541
00:32:03,894 --> 00:32:05,244
Nicely done.

542
00:32:05,662 --> 00:32:07,716
I didn't think you had it in you,
and I mean that.

543
00:32:08,165 --> 00:32:09,423
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

544
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,351
Inspired.

545
00:32:14,102 --> 00:32:15,512
Congratulations, boys.

546
00:32:16,913 --> 00:32:18,724
Peggy, you want to write that down?

547
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:21,693
Don said congratulations.

548
00:32:23,978 --> 00:32:24,978
Are we done here?

549
00:32:32,095 --> 00:32:34,266
I really thought it was gonna
go bad for a minute.

550
00:32:34,653 --> 00:32:36,158
- I was sure it would.
- No kidding.

551
00:32:36,418 --> 00:32:38,827
You almost let me detonate
1,000 feet from the ground.

552
00:32:39,619 --> 00:32:41,134
So much for camaraderie.

553
00:32:42,982 --> 00:32:44,560
Mr. Rumson sent this over.

554
00:32:46,127 --> 00:32:48,087
Unopened! Very nice.

555
00:32:48,887 --> 00:32:51,798
Hildi? Stay. Have a drink.
It's an order.

556
00:32:52,481 --> 00:32:55,344
No, thank you. I'm going to
my parents after work.

557
00:32:55,604 --> 00:32:58,930
You know, when something good
happens to me, it also happens to you.

558
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:02,501
I know that. I said congratulations.

559
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:06,772
You should do something with that
sourpuss. You're very beautiful.

560
00:33:09,685 --> 00:33:11,218
Just being honest.

561
00:33:11,813 --> 00:33:13,612
I love watching you walk.

562
00:33:15,376 --> 00:33:16,490
I should go.

563
00:33:17,941 --> 00:33:18,950
You should.

564
00:34:17,499 --> 00:34:18,551
is he in?

565
00:34:23,501 --> 00:34:24,516
Always nice to see you.

566
00:34:27,025 --> 00:34:28,883
I can give you my assurance
that nothing good

567
00:34:28,989 --> 00:34:30,010
will happen to that boy,

568
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:32,566
though I can't seem to keep my word
on that, hard as I try.

569
00:34:33,126 --> 00:34:35,235
I might ask you to take me with you.

570
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:38,905
I see no reason to leave.

571
00:34:42,254 --> 00:34:43,503
Or maybe I see a million.

572
00:34:43,753 --> 00:34:44,786
A million?

573
00:34:45,049 --> 00:34:46,456
Is that what it's gonna cost me?

574
00:34:46,627 --> 00:34:48,206
I was thinking more like 40.

575
00:34:49,191 --> 00:34:50,251
45 is good.

576
00:34:57,434 --> 00:35:00,211
I'm not gonna be a little girl and
ask you why you stayed.

577
00:35:00,567 --> 00:35:01,743
I know it's not money,

578
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:04,253
and I hope it's not to keep
your foot on Pete Campbell.

579
00:35:05,004 --> 00:35:06,558
I like the way you do business.

580
00:35:07,317 --> 00:35:09,352
Well, I try to be as civilized
as you can be.

581
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:11,690
No contract.

582
00:35:11,871 --> 00:35:13,691
45 and no security.

583
00:35:14,441 --> 00:35:15,692
Well, what's in it for me?

584
00:35:16,941 --> 00:35:19,395
If I leave this place one day,

585
00:35:21,128 --> 00:35:23,158
it will not be for more advertising.

586
00:35:23,418 --> 00:35:24,756
What else is there?

587
00:35:25,941 --> 00:35:28,286
I don't know. Life being lived.

588
00:35:29,567 --> 00:35:32,000
I'd like to stop talking about
it and get back to it.

589
00:35:32,596 --> 00:35:34,205
I've worked with
a lot of men like you,

590
00:35:34,357 --> 00:35:37,586
and if you had to choose a place to die
it would be in the middle of a pitch.

591
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,068
I've done that.

592
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,633
I want to do something else.

593
00:35:58,424 --> 00:36:00,021
Jim Hobart, McCann-Erickson.

594
00:36:01,194 --> 00:36:02,194
Of course.

595
00:36:04,636 --> 00:36:05,817
<i>Line one.</i>

596
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:12,565
Incredible pictures. Am I wrong?

597
00:36:12,882 --> 00:36:14,016
<i>No, you're not.</i>

598
00:36:14,203 --> 00:36:17,133
So, your wife's already here
with us. I know she's happy.

599
00:36:17,442 --> 00:36:18,546
Why don't you join her?

600
00:36:20,217 --> 00:36:23,058
- I don't know about that, Jim.
- <i>You can do better than that.</i>

601
00:36:23,254 --> 00:36:25,136
You know what I'm offering here?

602
00:36:25,401 --> 00:36:27,443
It's Yankee stadium. I know.

603
00:36:27,656 --> 00:36:29,922
<i>What? Did Sterling
come to the rescue?</i>

604
00:36:30,767 --> 00:36:34,031
Is it about money? I have to say
I might've judged you wrong.

605
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:35,647
It's not.

606
00:36:35,907 --> 00:36:37,100
I'm surprised.

607
00:36:37,478 --> 00:36:40,193
I thought your wife coming
here meant you were interested.

608
00:36:41,005 --> 00:36:42,445
No, that was her idea.

609
00:36:43,382 --> 00:36:44,823
Can't blame me for trying.

610
00:36:45,379 --> 00:36:47,075
Maybe not but...

611
00:36:49,442 --> 00:36:51,621
Can't exactly say that
was a big league move.

612
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:56,710
All's fair.
No stone unturned, right?

613
00:36:58,986 --> 00:37:01,502
<i>It's a pity to lose both of you.
You're a very lucky</i>

614
00:37:01,766 --> 00:37:03,404
man landing that woman.

615
00:37:15,247 --> 00:37:17,266
What's going on with mr. Draper?

616
00:37:17,686 --> 00:37:19,749
Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you.

617
00:37:20,493 --> 00:37:21,610
Very good.

618
00:37:22,614 --> 00:37:25,739
I've been meaning to give this back to
you. I had it completely dry cleaned.

619
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,687
Why don't you keep it?

620
00:37:28,845 --> 00:37:30,595
Have it taken in here
and let out there.

621
00:37:31,088 --> 00:37:32,333
It's your dress.

622
00:37:34,106 --> 00:37:35,498
Hot tea. That's a good idea.

623
00:37:36,937 --> 00:37:38,164
What are you talking about?

624
00:37:41,564 --> 00:37:44,966
You are falling prey to a very
common situation for new girls.

625
00:37:45,533 --> 00:37:48,011
- I'm not new anymore.
- Well, that's just it.

626
00:37:48,939 --> 00:37:50,597
Don't you want to do well here?

627
00:37:50,857 --> 00:37:54,025
I'm the first girl to do
any writing in this office

628
00:37:54,567 --> 00:37:55,689
since the war.

629
00:37:56,453 --> 00:37:57,354
Marge told me.

630
00:37:57,878 --> 00:37:59,000
Writing?

631
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:00,982
Is that what this is about?

632
00:38:01,182 --> 00:38:03,276
I thought you were doing
that to get close to Paul.

633
00:38:04,868 --> 00:38:06,404
Thank you again.

634
00:38:09,737 --> 00:38:11,775
I heard you were being
considered for an account

635
00:38:11,928 --> 00:38:13,701
because a client's wife
saw you and thought

636
00:38:13,865 --> 00:38:15,521
it would be okay if
he worked with you.

637
00:38:15,638 --> 00:38:16,812
You know, you're not a stick!

638
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:19,489
And yet I never wonder
what men think of me.

639
00:38:20,184 --> 00:38:22,582
You are hiding a very
attractive young girl

640
00:38:22,864 --> 00:38:24,047
with too much lunch.

641
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:26,203
I know what men think of you.

642
00:38:26,603 --> 00:38:29,245
That you're looking for a husband,
and you're fun,

643
00:38:30,513 --> 00:38:32,086
and not in that order.

644
00:38:33,648 --> 00:38:36,559
Peggy, this isn't China.
There's no money in virginity.

645
00:38:38,054 --> 00:38:39,334
I'm not a virgin.

646
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:44,331
No, of course not.

647
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,990
I just realized something.

648
00:38:52,003 --> 00:38:53,702
You think you're being helpful.

649
00:38:54,303 --> 00:38:56,264
Well, I am trying, dear.

650
00:39:00,472 --> 00:39:01,740
I'm going home.

651
00:39:14,197 --> 00:39:15,300
Did you have a good day?

652
00:39:15,458 --> 00:39:17,460
I did. It was splendid.

653
00:39:18,149 --> 00:39:20,854
Well, Betty, I have some good news
and some bad news.

654
00:39:22,534 --> 00:39:23,814
There's bad news?

655
00:39:24,143 --> 00:39:27,113
The client's moving the international
work to London.

656
00:39:29,148 --> 00:39:31,590
More Audrey Hepburn,
less Grace Kelly.

657
00:39:32,733 --> 00:39:33,533
I see.

658
00:39:33,925 --> 00:39:36,496
As for us, well, we're going back
to the malt shop.

659
00:39:36,862 --> 00:39:40,175
The good news is you have two
wonderful sets of pictures

660
00:39:40,347 --> 00:39:41,991
to start your book again.

661
00:39:42,499 --> 00:39:43,586
That's true.

662
00:39:43,823 --> 00:39:45,126
I really am sorry.

663
00:39:47,459 --> 00:39:48,756
This was fun.

664
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:51,384
You can keep the dress
and the hairstyle.

665
00:39:51,644 --> 00:39:53,420
I don't do that for everyone.

666
00:39:57,651 --> 00:40:00,894
Honey, it has nothing
to do with you.

667
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:04,834
Thank you.

668
00:40:24,517 --> 00:40:26,408
What do you think, Paul? Should
we move this whole thing

669
00:40:26,513 --> 00:40:27,629
down to MacDougal street?

670
00:40:27,798 --> 00:40:28,713
Doing great here.

671
00:40:35,966 --> 00:40:37,147
Good, she left.

672
00:40:37,741 --> 00:40:39,596
Probably wasn't gonna
happen for her tonight.

673
00:40:39,711 --> 00:40:40,759
Depends how much we drink.

674
00:40:42,142 --> 00:40:43,891
How drunk do you have to be?

675
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,448
My brother works at the exchange.

676
00:40:47,686 --> 00:40:49,635
They call a girl like her a lobster.

677
00:40:50,147 --> 00:40:51,319
All the meat's in the tail.

678
00:40:55,631 --> 00:40:56,969
Are they giving you guys a bonus?

679
00:41:04,258 --> 00:41:05,266
Will you calm down?

680
00:41:07,987 --> 00:41:09,020
Come on!

681
00:41:12,167 --> 00:41:13,647
Drop you at the station?

682
00:41:14,023 --> 00:41:15,103
Sure.

683
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,003
Campbell, you sucker punched me.

684
00:41:30,277 --> 00:41:31,359
What is wrong with you?

685
00:41:32,462 --> 00:41:33,624
Come on.

686
00:41:38,059 --> 00:41:41,570
You just had a fight and
I was not part of it.

687
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:43,942
Either you two make up,

688
00:41:44,273 --> 00:41:46,383
or I do not stand a chance tonight.

689
00:41:56,448 --> 00:41:57,657
Perfect timing.

690
00:41:59,293 --> 00:42:00,549
The children are down,

691
00:42:00,762 --> 00:42:03,107
but only because they were
running around all day.

692
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:05,560
They fell asleep in front of the TV.

693
00:42:06,091 --> 00:42:07,729
- How did it go today?
- Good.

694
00:42:08,973 --> 00:42:09,983
Fun.

695
00:42:10,674 --> 00:42:13,526
They were talking about a whole
string of other possibilities for me.

696
00:42:15,275 --> 00:42:16,343
But honestly,

697
00:42:17,928 --> 00:42:19,991
I don't think I want to
work anymore.

698
00:42:22,691 --> 00:42:24,669
I don't like you coming
home to some...

699
00:42:26,463 --> 00:42:29,716
Whipped together mess of
whatever's left in the fridge.

700
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:33,554
And frankly, I don't like

701
00:42:34,141 --> 00:42:35,773
Manhattan on my own.

702
00:42:37,606 --> 00:42:38,468
It's harsh.

703
00:42:42,249 --> 00:42:43,341
It can be.

704
00:42:44,822 --> 00:42:46,113
And what am I going to do?

705
00:42:46,402 --> 00:42:47,788
Run around the city with my book

706
00:42:48,891 --> 00:42:51,564
like some teenager
making a fool of myself?

707
00:42:54,016 --> 00:42:55,519
If that's what you want,

708
00:42:56,862 --> 00:42:58,863
and it's my job to give
you what you want.

709
00:42:59,123 --> 00:43:00,147
You do.

710
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:04,652
Look at all this.

711
00:43:06,951 --> 00:43:08,924
I don't know what I was thinking.

712
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:16,518
Birdie,

713
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:20,765
you know I don't care
about making my dinner

714
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:23,783
or taking in my shirts.

715
00:43:25,595 --> 00:43:27,016
You have a job.

716
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,221
You're a mother to those
two little people

717
00:43:31,385 --> 00:43:33,731
and you are better at it than
anyone else in the world.

718
00:43:38,988 --> 00:43:40,655
At least in the top 500.

719
00:43:47,563 --> 00:43:49,101
I would've given anything

720
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:51,374
to have had a mother like you.

721
00:43:53,147 --> 00:43:54,193
Beautiful, and kind,

722
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:58,228
and filled with love like an angel.

723
00:44:00,381 --> 00:44:01,539
You're sweet.

724
00:44:19,536 --> 00:44:20,945
And this does not taste whipped up.

725
00:44:22,038 --> 00:44:23,038
No.

726
00:44:23,288 --> 00:44:24,704
It's good, isn't it?

727
00:44:38,353 --> 00:44:40,664
- Have a good day, daddy.
- You, too.

728
00:44:41,473 --> 00:44:44,187
We're going to the community center
to watch them fill the pool.

729
00:44:44,349 --> 00:44:45,758
That sounds fun.

730
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,231
- Have a good day.
- I already am.

731
00:44:55,263 --> 00:44:56,883
Mommy, I'm eating.

732
00:45:13,451 --> 00:45:15,376
Be careful! Don't jump off the bed.

733
00:45:15,726 --> 00:45:16,726
Okay!

734
00:45:48,944 --> 00:45:50,071
mrs. Draper!

735
00:45:51,163 --> 00:45:52,578
What the hell are you doing?

736
00:45:54,415 --> 00:45:55,415
Mrs. Draper!
