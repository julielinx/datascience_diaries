00:46:14,506 --> 00:46:17,007
<i>( Horns honking )</i>

823
00:46:39,731 --> 00:46:42,200
<i>( Horns honking )</i>

824
00:47:10,465 --> 00:47:13,067
Excuse me.
Someone's left--

825
00:47:13,069 --> 00:47:16,004
There's a wallet here
from some previous passenger.

826
00:47:16,006 --> 00:47:18,974
Oh, I'll turn it in to dispatch.
They got a lost and found.

827
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:25,348
There's close to $100.

828
00:47:25,350 --> 00:47:27,650
Yeah, it happens all the time.

829
00:47:31,989 --> 00:47:34,691
I'd-- I'd feel better

830
00:47:34,693 --> 00:47:36,793
if I saw to its return.

831
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:40,730
You're putting me
in a jam here.

832
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:42,732
The guy's gonna call
looking for it.

833
00:47:48,338 --> 00:47:50,506
That's me.

834
00:47:52,943 --> 00:47:56,812
You know what?
You do what you got to do, mister.

835
00:47:56,814 --> 00:47:59,082
Oh, that's for you.

836
00:48:11,027 --> 00:48:12,495
Man on TV:
High tides and heavy surf

837
00:48:12,497 --> 00:48:14,596
<i>battered the coast</i>
<i>of North Carolina day.</i>

838
00:48:14,598 --> 00:48:17,499
Force 40 winds and heavy
<i>rain forced evacuation</i>

839
00:48:17,501 --> 00:48:20,535
<i>along the coast</i>
<i>as far inland as three miles.</i>

840
00:48:56,571 --> 00:48:58,472
That was quite a soiree.

841
00:48:58,474 --> 00:49:00,641
Did Masters and Johnson
come in yet?

842
00:49:00,643 --> 00:49:02,643
They haven't passed by.

843
00:49:02,645 --> 00:49:04,378
I should come and sit down,

844
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:08,148
so I can see them
slink in in shame.

845
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:10,017
You seem to be in fine spirits.

846
00:49:10,019 --> 00:49:12,453
Well, I didn't get into
too much trouble on Saturday.

847
00:49:12,455 --> 00:49:15,924
Plus, Mohawk called me
at home this morning.

848
00:49:15,926 --> 00:49:18,460
Ah.

849
00:49:18,462 --> 00:49:21,063
- <i>( Intercom buzzes )</i>
<i>- I hate to interrupt, Mr. Pryce,</i>

850
00:49:21,065 --> 00:49:22,531
<i>but I have your wife.</i>

851
00:49:22,533 --> 00:49:25,067
- Which line?
- <i>Three.</i>

852
00:49:25,069 --> 00:49:27,302
- <i>It's blinking.</i>
<i>- They're all blinking.</i>

853
00:49:27,304 --> 00:49:30,038
- <i>Three.</i>
<i>- If you don't mind.</i>

854
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:32,107
I've called
a partners' meeting.

855
00:49:36,011 --> 00:49:37,778
Hello, dearest.

856
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:40,047
Look, I know you were
upset when you left,

857
00:49:40,049 --> 00:49:42,382
and perhaps I'm overreacting.

858
00:49:42,384 --> 00:49:43,850
Becca, dear,

859
00:49:43,852 --> 00:49:47,121
this is why I don't like
you opening the mail.

860
00:49:47,123 --> 00:49:49,991
I only want to ensure that
Nigel is enrolled in the fall.

861
00:49:49,993 --> 00:49:51,793
Nigel's enrollment
isn't an issue

862
00:49:51,795 --> 00:49:53,929
whether we pay now or not.

863
00:49:53,931 --> 00:49:56,732
Then why would they attach such
a threatening letter to a bill?

864
00:49:56,734 --> 00:50:00,370
Wouldn't you rather have your money in
June than September if you were them?

865
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:03,840
Well, I worry about them
saving his spot for him,

866
00:50:03,842 --> 00:50:06,009
especially with his marks.

867
00:50:07,745 --> 00:50:09,546
I assure you that
St. Paul's is aware

868
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:11,114
that we plan on
having him return

869
00:50:11,116 --> 00:50:13,883
and simply wishes to earn
whatever interest they can

870
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:16,419
on the full amount
for the next three months.

871
00:50:16,421 --> 00:50:19,221
<i>Couldn't you spare</i>
<i>that interest</i>

872
00:50:19,223 --> 00:50:22,024
<i>in exchange</i>
<i>for my peace of mind?</i>

873
00:50:28,131 --> 00:50:29,565
<i>Lane, darling?</i>

874
00:50:29,567 --> 00:50:32,435
What? I'm sorry.
I didn't get that last bit.

875
00:50:32,437 --> 00:50:34,771
Nothing.
Don't forget

876
00:50:34,773 --> 00:50:36,973
to get the name of
Megan's real estate agent.

877
00:50:36,975 --> 00:50:38,375
Yes, dear.

878
00:50:38,377 --> 00:50:40,644
<i>And her decorator.</i>

879
00:50:42,246 --> 00:50:44,982
<i>( Gail laughing )</i>

880
00:50:47,852 --> 00:50:50,720
Oh, Apolo,
you're so good with him.

881
00:50:50,722 --> 00:50:53,823
Oh, I wasn't expecting
you back so soon.

882
00:50:55,125 --> 00:50:56,559
First in line
at the post office.

883
00:50:56,561 --> 00:50:59,261
- It wasn't that bad.
- Hello, Miss Joan.

884
00:50:59,263 --> 00:51:01,096
Sink is draining.

885
00:51:01,098 --> 00:51:03,931
Turns out it was a lemon peel.

886
00:51:03,933 --> 00:51:05,733
I'm sure you know
we're appreciative,

887
00:51:05,735 --> 00:51:07,968
but mother and I
have so much to do.

888
00:51:07,970 --> 00:51:10,071
I am busy, busy, too.

889
00:51:10,073 --> 00:51:11,639
Oh, you don't have to rush off.

890
00:51:11,641 --> 00:51:14,075
He doesn't have to
rush off, does he?

891
00:51:15,310 --> 00:51:17,679
When you need Apolo,
you call Apolo.

892
00:51:17,681 --> 00:51:19,547
( Chuckles )

893
00:51:23,252 --> 00:51:24,418
I want him to hear--

894
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:26,254
That was just rude.

895
00:51:26,256 --> 00:51:28,790
It is one thing
to have him work here,

896
00:51:28,792 --> 00:51:31,859
it is another thing to give
him cake and my baby.

897
00:51:31,861 --> 00:51:35,663
His fingers have been in every
toilet from here to the bowery.

898
00:51:35,665 --> 00:51:37,999
He brought the cookies.

899
00:51:38,001 --> 00:51:41,336
If you want to go on
a date with him, just ask.

900
00:51:41,338 --> 00:51:43,705
He's married
with four children.

901
00:51:43,707 --> 00:51:46,508
I'm just making sure this
apartment gets his attention.

902
00:51:46,510 --> 00:51:50,078
This apartment has never had any
trouble getting his attention.

903
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:52,781
Yes, Joanie.
Everyone's staring at you.

904
00:51:52,783 --> 00:51:55,250
You know you're not exactly
at your fighting weight.

905
00:51:55,252 --> 00:51:57,252
Try me.

906
00:51:57,254 --> 00:51:59,221
You asked me to come out here.

907
00:51:59,223 --> 00:52:01,690
You can go home
any time you want.

908
00:52:01,692 --> 00:52:03,892
You should think
before you say that.

909
00:52:03,894 --> 00:52:06,329
I got my money's worth.

910
00:52:06,331 --> 00:52:09,298
Well, I wasn't going
to show you this.

911
00:52:19,243 --> 00:52:21,711
That doesn't make any sense.

912
00:52:21,713 --> 00:52:25,615
Look, I'm sure it's not the way
anyone wants you to find out.

913
00:52:25,617 --> 00:52:27,483
No, it's not in the want ads.

914
00:52:27,485 --> 00:52:29,953
And, honestly, they don't have
the money for more people.

915
00:52:29,955 --> 00:52:32,389
It's not more people.
It's you.

916
00:52:32,391 --> 00:52:35,259
You love stirring the shit.

917
00:52:35,261 --> 00:52:39,831
I am telling you something
you don't want to hear.

918
00:52:39,833 --> 00:52:42,567
And you are making this
very painful for me.

919
00:52:42,569 --> 00:52:45,370
Megan Draper just invited
me to her party.

920
00:52:45,372 --> 00:52:46,838
At the very last minute.

921
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:49,107
Don't tell me that
girl's not conniving.

922
00:52:49,109 --> 00:52:51,776
You think she wants you
around her husband?

923
00:52:53,946 --> 00:52:56,882
I'm going to lie down.

924
00:52:56,884 --> 00:53:00,086
Sometimes life makes
decisions for you.

925
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:14,900
- Have a good day.
- Okay.

926
00:53:21,675 --> 00:53:24,277
- <i>Bonjour.</i>
<i>- I know your birthday was last week,</i>

927
00:53:24,279 --> 00:53:26,613
and I was told you don't celebrate
it and not to bring it up.

928
00:53:26,615 --> 00:53:28,748
Now I feel like I got
caught with my pants down,

929
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:31,518
so I got you
a little something.

930
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:33,019
It's a plant.

931
00:53:33,021 --> 00:53:36,256
I just wanted to say
Happy Birthday.

932
00:53:36,258 --> 00:53:38,359
Kiss-ass.

933
00:53:38,361 --> 00:53:40,094
Thank you.

934
00:53:43,365 --> 00:53:47,368
( Singing in French )

935
00:53:51,739 --> 00:53:54,273
I can get you some coffee, but
there's a partners' meeting.

936
00:53:54,275 --> 00:53:58,042
- Nobody's there.
- It's in Mr. Campbell's office.

937
00:53:58,044 --> 00:54:00,878
- You want to smile?
- Is it your obituary?

938
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:04,415
No, it's the little salt
we rubbed in Y&R's wound.

939
00:54:07,752 --> 00:54:09,719
- It's beautiful, no?
- <i>( Phone ringing )</i>

940
00:54:09,721 --> 00:54:12,422
- That's Mr. Campbell.
- Shall we?

941
00:54:16,794 --> 00:54:19,029
- Roger.
- What?

942
00:54:19,031 --> 00:54:22,133
We don't make fun of each
other's wives here. Understood?

943
00:54:22,135 --> 00:54:24,435
( Chuckles ) Come on, I
wasn't making fun of her.

944
00:54:24,437 --> 00:54:26,805
I was making fun of you.
You're happy.

945
00:54:26,807 --> 00:54:28,707
- I am.
- Well, I want you to be happy.

946
00:54:28,709 --> 00:54:31,009
Somebody should be.

947
00:54:32,611 --> 00:54:34,879
You know, two weeks ago,

948
00:54:34,881 --> 00:54:37,515
Jane asked me,
"Which one's Mussolini?"

949
00:54:37,517 --> 00:54:39,417
( Both laugh )

950
00:54:39,419 --> 00:54:41,620
No, it's good.
She's a great girl.

951
00:54:41,622 --> 00:54:45,323
They're all great girls.
At least until they want something.

952
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:49,128
Let's go.

953
00:54:49,130 --> 00:54:51,063
They're just leaving now.

954
00:54:51,065 --> 00:54:53,800
What, did they stop
for a drink?

955
00:54:53,802 --> 00:54:57,203
Well, why don't you get off your rear,
find them, and tell them I'm about--

956
00:54:57,205 --> 00:54:58,905
They're here.

957
00:55:01,609 --> 00:55:04,044
Gentlemen, if you
could slide over a bit.

958
00:55:04,046 --> 00:55:06,046
- A marvelous fete.
- Oh, yes.

959
00:55:06,048 --> 00:55:08,348
I have instructions from
Trudy to thank both of you.

960
00:55:10,818 --> 00:55:12,953
- Why are we meeting in here?
- Why are we here?

961
00:55:12,955 --> 00:55:15,955
Please don't smoke in here.
I spent the morning choking on the train.

962
00:55:22,362 --> 00:55:26,398
So, Mohawk is coming in.
I've brought them in.

963
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,999
- What do you know about that?
- That's great news.

964
00:55:28,001 --> 00:55:30,569
- When?
- I don't know.

965
00:55:30,571 --> 00:55:33,104
All I was thinking is that I
bring Henry and Jack in here

966
00:55:33,106 --> 00:55:36,241
to this very gathering of individuals,
but I have one question.

967
00:55:36,243 --> 00:55:39,110
Where are they going to sit?

968
00:55:39,112 --> 00:55:42,647
I mean, what kind of impression
does this space give you?

969
00:55:42,649 --> 00:55:44,649
Do you gaze upon the cement
column and think,

970
00:55:44,651 --> 00:55:48,220
"Yes, I believe success
for me and my company dwells here."

971
00:55:48,222 --> 00:55:50,656
( Laughing ) Why don't you take
them to the conference room?

972
00:55:50,658 --> 00:55:52,891
Because it's not that meeting.

973
00:55:52,893 --> 00:55:54,526
Fine, we'll have it
in my office.

974
00:55:54,528 --> 00:55:56,895
This does not
involve you, Roger.

975
00:55:56,897 --> 00:56:00,432
Nor does Vicks, Playtex,
Life Cereal, Samsonite,

976
00:56:00,434 --> 00:56:02,735
Sugarberry Ham, Secor Laxative.

977
00:56:02,737 --> 00:56:05,704
Need I go on?

978
00:56:05,706 --> 00:56:07,639
What are you suggesting?

979
00:56:07,641 --> 00:56:10,776
He's suggesting that you
give him your office.

980
00:56:10,778 --> 00:56:12,745
( Chuckles ) No, he's not.

981
00:56:12,747 --> 00:56:14,713
- Yes, I am.
- Well, forget it.

982
00:56:14,715 --> 00:56:17,150
Where am I supposed
to conduct business?

983
00:56:17,152 --> 00:56:18,952
In the crapper for all I care.

984
00:56:18,954 --> 00:56:20,453
I'm a full partner
and you're a junior.

985
00:56:20,455 --> 00:56:22,856
So sorry, Charlie,
but them's the breaks.

986
00:56:24,625 --> 00:56:27,794
Gentlemen, I'm sure we can find
an equitable solution to this.

987
00:56:27,796 --> 00:56:29,462
- There's no need for a row.
- You're right.

988
00:56:29,464 --> 00:56:31,631
I say we put it to a vote.

989
00:56:31,633 --> 00:56:33,532
I say we step outside.

990
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:43,342
I didn't think so.

991
00:56:47,947 --> 00:56:49,281
Good work on Mohawk.

992
00:56:49,283 --> 00:56:51,083
Thank you, but I'm dead
serious about this.

993
00:56:51,085 --> 00:56:54,320
I have too much responsibility
and too much business

994
00:56:54,322 --> 00:56:56,922
to apply my skills
in this environment.

995
00:56:58,658 --> 00:57:00,992
You all know it.

996
00:57:00,994 --> 00:57:02,494
We'll buy more space.

997
00:57:02,496 --> 00:57:05,263
- If we're handing out offices...
- Absolutely not.

998
00:57:05,265 --> 00:57:07,966
I can't extend our
credit line any further.

999
00:57:07,968 --> 00:57:10,635
It'll work itself out.

1000
00:57:12,605 --> 00:57:14,405
Congratulations.

1001
00:57:16,542 --> 00:57:18,910
When are they coming in?

1002
00:57:18,912 --> 00:57:20,845
I'm still not sure they should,

1003
00:57:20,847 --> 00:57:23,080
considering the situation.

1004
00:57:32,558 --> 00:57:34,658
Great party, Don.

1005
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:36,961
Absolutely.

1006
00:57:36,963 --> 00:57:38,896
I couldn't sleep.

1007
00:57:38,898 --> 00:57:41,966
Oh, those tits and that mouth.

1008
00:57:41,968 --> 00:57:43,901
She's such a sex kitten.

1009
00:57:43,903 --> 00:57:46,737
That whole dance--
How did he just sit there?

1010
00:57:46,739 --> 00:57:50,307
You can't stand up once
you get in that condition.

1011
00:57:50,309 --> 00:57:52,110
I would have.
I would just stood up

1012
00:57:52,112 --> 00:57:53,711
and grabbed her little
French behind

1013
00:57:53,713 --> 00:57:55,980
and pushed her through those
cheap post four walls.

1014
00:57:55,982 --> 00:57:57,749
- Hi, Megan.
- Very funny.

1015
00:57:57,751 --> 00:57:59,251
God, what I would do to her.

1016
00:57:59,253 --> 00:58:00,986
Like what, for example?

1017
00:58:00,988 --> 00:58:02,721
I'll tell you what.

1018
00:58:02,723 --> 00:58:04,824
I would love to see
those heels on my shoulder.

1019
00:58:04,826 --> 00:58:07,627
Ooh, <i>je voudrais mas</i> Harry.

1020
00:58:07,629 --> 00:58:10,029
Good morning.

1021
00:58:10,031 --> 00:58:13,066
Great party.
Thrilled to be included.

1022
00:58:13,068 --> 00:58:14,968
Jennifer was very jealous.

1023
00:58:16,270 --> 00:58:18,638
( Laughing )

1024
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:20,473
I think I'm gonna die.

1025
00:58:20,475 --> 00:58:22,375
- Oh!
- You could have warned me!

1026
00:58:22,377 --> 00:58:24,344
I did!

1027
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:33,007
<i>( Intercom buzzes )</i>

1028
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:35,643
I have the owner of the wallet
<i>returning your call.</i>

1029
00:58:35,645 --> 00:58:38,012
Thank you.

1030
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:40,849
- Hello.
- Woman: <i>Hello, Mr. Pryce.</i>

1031
00:58:40,851 --> 00:58:42,850
<i>I'm calling for Alex Polito.</i>

1032
00:58:42,852 --> 00:58:46,321
- And who is this?
- <i>This is his girl Delores.</i>

1033
00:58:46,323 --> 00:58:48,390
Oh.

1034
00:58:48,392 --> 00:58:51,994
Well, when he comes
into the office,

1035
00:58:51,996 --> 00:58:54,663
I think I should speak
with him personally.

1036
00:58:54,665 --> 00:58:56,965
Oh, I'm not his secretary.
<i>I'm his girl.</i>

1037
00:58:56,967 --> 00:58:59,868
<i>I'm like his wife,</i>
<i>but I can't call myself that.</i>

1038
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:02,070
Oh.

1039
00:59:03,906 --> 00:59:05,707
You don't sound
happy about that.

1040
00:59:05,709 --> 00:59:08,509
- <i>Excuse me?</i>
<i>- I'm married myself.</i>

1041
00:59:08,511 --> 00:59:10,545
<i>Oh, good for you.</i>
<i>What's her name?</i>

1042
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:12,613
Rebecca.
Rebecca Pryce.

1043
00:59:12,615 --> 00:59:14,849
Well, obviously.

1044
00:59:14,851 --> 00:59:17,486
- <i>That's a pretty name.</i>
<i>- I suppose so.</i>

1045
00:59:17,488 --> 00:59:20,790
She enjoys it.

1046
00:59:20,792 --> 00:59:23,025
<i>Do you think</i>
<i>she's home right now,</i>

1047
00:59:23,027 --> 00:59:25,261
<i>lying in bed,</i>
<i>talking to a stranger?</i>

1048
00:59:25,263 --> 00:59:28,565
Oh, I should hope not.

1049
00:59:28,567 --> 00:59:31,402
<i>So-- so you have</i>
<i>Alex's wallet?</i>

1050
00:59:31,404 --> 00:59:34,138
Yes, I do.

1051
00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:35,472
<i>And where are you?</i>

1052
00:59:35,474 --> 00:59:37,574
I'm at my offices in midtown.

1053
00:59:37,576 --> 00:59:40,310
<i>Oh, are you in big business?</i>

1054
00:59:40,312 --> 00:59:42,446
Excuse me?

1055
00:59:42,448 --> 00:59:44,648
<i>Are you in a big</i>
<i>office building?</i>

1056
00:59:44,650 --> 00:59:47,617
Uh, yes.

1057
00:59:49,353 --> 00:59:51,587
That's why I don't
have the luxury

1058
00:59:51,589 --> 00:59:54,857
of lying around at 11:00
in my underthings.

1059
00:59:54,859 --> 00:59:57,627
<i>I didn't tell you that part.</i>

1060
00:59:57,629 --> 01:00:01,465
You didn't say
I was incorrect, either.

1061
01:00:01,467 --> 01:00:03,701
<i>Where the hell are you from?</i>

1062
01:00:03,703 --> 01:00:05,937
You sound like Cary Grant.

1063
01:00:05,939 --> 01:00:08,739
I told you, midtown.

1064
01:00:08,741 --> 01:00:11,108
Why don't I--

1065
01:00:11,110 --> 01:00:15,513
Listen, I really
should return this--

1066
01:00:15,515 --> 01:00:17,015
You know, the wallet.

1067
01:00:17,017 --> 01:00:19,551
I could slip it
in the post or...

1068
01:00:19,553 --> 01:00:22,153
Of course, you know,
that has its disadvantages.

1069
01:00:22,155 --> 01:00:24,589
There's a bit of cash here.

1070
01:00:24,591 --> 01:00:27,459
Or I could
hand-deliver it.

1071
01:00:27,461 --> 01:00:30,129
Is this a current address?

1072
01:00:35,668 --> 01:00:37,402
<i>I don't know.</i>

1073
01:00:37,404 --> 01:00:40,038
<i>I don't know if that</i>
<i>would be proper.</i>

1074
01:00:42,075 --> 01:00:44,543
No, of course.

1075
01:00:44,545 --> 01:00:47,479
Why don't you meet me
at my place of business?

1076
01:00:47,481 --> 01:00:51,283
I'll give you the address
or have my secretary help you.

1077
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:55,688
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>Why don't we do that?</i>

1078
01:00:55,690 --> 01:00:57,523
<i>And I'll come by when I can.</i>

1079
01:00:57,525 --> 01:01:01,027
Well, I'll be here
the rest of my life.

1080
01:01:01,029 --> 01:01:03,429
( Laughs )

1081
01:01:03,431 --> 01:01:05,297
Uh, just a minute.

1082
01:01:08,935 --> 01:01:10,669
I look forward to it.

1083
01:01:10,671 --> 01:01:12,537
<i>Why not?</i>

1084
01:01:12,539 --> 01:01:14,005
Toodle-loo.

1085
01:01:14,007 --> 01:01:16,274
<i>That's cute.</i>

1086
01:01:19,145 --> 01:01:22,014
Scarlett, would you give this
woman directions to our office?

1087
01:01:22,016 --> 01:01:23,982
She's on line three.

1088
01:01:45,973 --> 01:01:47,407
- <i>( Intercom buzzes )</i>
<i>- Mr. Crane.</i>

1089
01:01:47,409 --> 01:01:49,076
Mr. Sterling has requested
<i>you in his office.</i>

1090
01:01:49,078 --> 01:01:52,112
- Is there a meeting?
- <i>He just--</i>

1091
01:01:52,114 --> 01:01:54,982
<i>He just came over here,</i>
<i>said he needed to see you</i>

1092
01:01:54,984 --> 01:01:56,884
<i>and walked away.</i>

1093
01:01:56,886 --> 01:01:59,253
- Why didn't he come in?
- <i>I don't know.</i>

1094
01:01:59,255 --> 01:02:01,422
He knows you're in there.

1095
01:02:01,424 --> 01:02:05,059
Okay. Okay. Did you see him
talking to Megan or Don?

1096
01:02:05,061 --> 01:02:07,395
<i>I've been working.</i>
<i>What did you do?</i>

1097
01:02:07,397 --> 01:02:09,630
Nothing!

1098
01:02:22,646 --> 01:02:24,647
You wanted to see me?

1099
01:02:24,649 --> 01:02:26,116
I did.

1100
01:02:26,118 --> 01:02:27,917
( Coughs )
Come in, have a seat.

1101
01:02:27,919 --> 01:02:30,020
No, that's okay.

1102
01:02:30,022 --> 01:02:32,156
I think you should have a seat.

1103
01:02:33,992 --> 01:02:35,692
Okay.

1104
01:02:38,696 --> 01:02:40,964
Now, I think you know

1105
01:02:40,966 --> 01:02:43,868
that we like to think
of this place as a family.

1106
01:02:43,870 --> 01:02:47,104
And there are certain ways
a family behaves.

1107
01:02:47,106 --> 01:02:49,540
What did she say?
You have to hear my side of it.

1108
01:02:49,542 --> 01:02:52,276
Your side of what?

1109
01:02:52,278 --> 01:02:54,212
What-- Nothing.

1110
01:02:54,214 --> 01:02:57,249
You're always up to something,
aren't you, Crane?

1111
01:02:57,251 --> 01:03:00,185
It was an honest mistake and I
consider myself reprimanded.

1112
01:03:00,187 --> 01:03:01,787
Great.

1113
01:03:01,789 --> 01:03:04,690
I was thinking Pete
could take your office.

1114
01:03:04,692 --> 01:03:06,592
Really?

1115
01:03:06,594 --> 01:03:08,862
Look, I will apologize
face to face,

1116
01:03:08,864 --> 01:03:10,697
as horrible as that will
be, but I think you're--

1117
01:03:10,699 --> 01:03:13,534
There's no reason to let me go.

1118
01:03:15,938 --> 01:03:17,604
You're not getting fired.

1119
01:03:17,606 --> 01:03:20,640
- Oh.
- And what the hell did you do?

1120
01:03:20,642 --> 01:03:22,776
I made fun of
"Zou Bisou."

1121
01:03:22,778 --> 01:03:25,945
So did I.
( Laughs )

1122
01:03:25,947 --> 01:03:27,613
Is that a crime?
No.

1123
01:03:27,615 --> 01:03:30,449
I tried to get Jane to
talk to me in that accent.

1124
01:03:30,451 --> 01:03:33,752
Nothing doing. She doesn't speak French.
She doesn't like me.

1125
01:03:33,754 --> 01:03:37,089
I went home after and Jennifer
didn't know what was coming.

1126
01:03:37,091 --> 01:03:39,091
- I was like--
- I don't want to hear that.

1127
01:03:39,093 --> 01:03:41,193
No, of course you don't.
Why would you?

1128
01:03:41,195 --> 01:03:45,531
Look, I think you can understand
that Pete needs a bigger office.

1129
01:03:45,533 --> 01:03:47,934
And just between you,
me, and the window washer,

1130
01:03:47,936 --> 01:03:51,204
it's been decided
that you should trade.

1131
01:03:51,206 --> 01:03:53,807
Who decided that?

1132
01:03:53,809 --> 01:03:57,310
- I did.
- I can't do that.

1133
01:03:57,312 --> 01:04:01,380
And I don't know that I
have to do it. Do I?

1134
01:04:01,382 --> 01:04:03,448
( Sighs )

1135
01:04:05,151 --> 01:04:07,019
Harry...

1136
01:04:07,021 --> 01:04:10,022
I'm asking you as a friend.

1137
01:04:10,024 --> 01:04:13,492
And I appreciate that, Roger, I
really do, but I need my office.

1138
01:04:13,494 --> 01:04:16,194
Look, first of all, Pete's
office isn't that different.

1139
01:04:16,196 --> 01:04:18,330
- I disagree.
- Fine.

1140
01:04:18,332 --> 01:04:21,566
Name the most important person you
could bring into this office.

1141
01:04:23,503 --> 01:04:25,370
William Paley.

1142
01:04:25,372 --> 01:04:27,806
Okay, so you shouldn't do that.

1143
01:04:27,808 --> 01:04:30,208
Trust me, network and
studio executives

1144
01:04:30,210 --> 01:04:31,876
want to think you're
out there jet-setting,

1145
01:04:31,878 --> 01:04:33,712
rubbing shoulders
with television stars

1146
01:04:33,714 --> 01:04:35,781
and chorus girls.

1147
01:04:35,783 --> 01:04:37,716
You should be talking
to clients ringside

1148
01:04:37,718 --> 01:04:40,253
or at a three-star
restaurant,

1149
01:04:40,255 --> 01:04:42,555
not coming into your
miserable little office.

1150
01:04:42,557 --> 01:04:44,858
But I do.
I come in here almost every day.

1151
01:04:44,860 --> 01:04:47,227
And Pete's office is a shit
hole with a support beam.

1152
01:04:49,197 --> 01:04:51,932
What if I were to
make it worth your while?

1153
01:04:51,934 --> 01:04:53,667
I'm already head
of my department.

1154
01:04:53,669 --> 01:04:56,169
What would be
an appropriate bonus?

1155
01:04:56,171 --> 01:04:58,438
There's no bonuses.
We have no money.

1156
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:00,306
How much would it take?

1157
01:05:00,308 --> 01:05:02,475
Well, first of all, it's more
than you could have on you.

1158
01:05:02,477 --> 01:05:04,376
Really?

1159
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:09,415
That's $1,100.

1160
01:05:09,417 --> 01:05:11,183
Why do you carry so much cash?

1161
01:05:11,185 --> 01:05:13,385
It's more than 1,000, Harry.

1162
01:05:16,323 --> 01:05:19,926
That is a month's salary

1163
01:05:19,928 --> 01:05:22,061
after taxes.

1164
01:05:25,634 --> 01:05:27,368
There's no window in there.

1165
01:05:27,370 --> 01:05:29,270
You could buy yourself
a very beautiful picture

1166
01:05:29,272 --> 01:05:31,272
of something to look at.

1167
01:05:34,010 --> 01:05:37,178
Well, okay.

1168
01:05:37,180 --> 01:05:39,147
- But you're gonna owe me.
- No, I'm not.

1169
01:05:39,149 --> 01:05:41,449
I just gave you a lot of money.

1170
01:05:41,451 --> 01:05:44,051
This is a transaction.
And if you don't like it,

1171
01:05:44,053 --> 01:05:47,321
we can have the conversation
you thought we were having.

1172
01:05:47,323 --> 01:05:49,389
So this is every month?

1173
01:05:49,391 --> 01:05:51,624
Get the hell out of my office.

1174
01:06:20,856 --> 01:06:22,423
Excuse me.
I'm sorry.

1175
01:06:22,425 --> 01:06:23,924
I'm Joan.

1176
01:06:23,926 --> 01:06:27,161
I'm Meredith.
Can I help you?

1177
01:06:27,163 --> 01:06:29,296
Joan Harris.

1178
01:06:30,365 --> 01:06:31,932
I work here.

1179
01:06:31,934 --> 01:06:34,034
Worked here.
I've been on leave.

1180
01:06:35,670 --> 01:06:38,138
Oh, Joan.

1181
01:06:38,140 --> 01:06:39,806
My goodness.

1182
01:06:39,808 --> 01:06:42,676
It's hard to believe
you just had a baby.

1183
01:06:42,678 --> 01:06:45,146
You don't know where I started.

1184
01:06:45,148 --> 01:06:46,614
Do you want me to announce you?

1185
01:06:46,616 --> 01:06:48,216
No, I'll let myself in.

1186
01:06:48,218 --> 01:06:51,386
- Are you sure?
- No one mentioned a new girl.

1187
01:06:51,388 --> 01:06:53,688
I guess they needed
someone up here

1188
01:06:53,690 --> 01:06:56,191
because Scarlett is now
covering Mr. Pryce,

1189
01:06:56,193 --> 01:06:59,227
so that she can
do the books with Clara.

1190
01:07:01,030 --> 01:07:03,765
Well, now I can understand
why I wasn't told.

1191
01:07:03,767 --> 01:07:06,468
Oh, my God.
My mouth.

1192
01:07:06,470 --> 01:07:09,171
Could you just
help me with the door?

1193
01:07:11,175 --> 01:07:13,275
Oh, he's adorable.

1194
01:07:14,678 --> 01:07:17,546
Please don't be mad at me
for telling you that.

1195
01:07:17,548 --> 01:07:20,216
I'm very happy
being nobody here.

1196
01:07:20,218 --> 01:07:24,286
I know a girl who had your job
who ended up with everything.

1197
01:07:27,490 --> 01:07:29,491
Where would you like
to visit first?

1198
01:07:29,493 --> 01:07:31,260
I suppose my office.

1199
01:07:31,262 --> 01:07:33,629
Yes, yes, absolutely.
Joan.

1200
01:07:33,631 --> 01:07:36,598
My goodness, you look radiant.

1201
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:40,136
- Can I see him?
- I don't see why not.

1202
01:07:40,138 --> 01:07:42,771
- Where's Scarlett?
- Go fetch Caroline.

1203
01:07:44,174 --> 01:07:46,375
Joanie.

1204
01:07:46,377 --> 01:07:48,978
Look at you out and about.

1205
01:07:48,980 --> 01:07:50,813
Yes, we're gonna stop
by the Copa later.

1206
01:07:50,815 --> 01:07:52,549
One of us badly needs a drink.

1207
01:07:52,551 --> 01:07:56,520
Lane made it very clear
we're not hiring anybody.

1208
01:07:56,522 --> 01:07:59,322
I don't care how buxom
his mother is.

1209
01:07:59,324 --> 01:08:01,057
Oh, Don.

1210
01:08:01,059 --> 01:08:04,427
- Look at that.
- He's okay.

1211
01:08:09,833 --> 01:08:11,867
Hello, Megan.

1212
01:08:11,869 --> 01:08:14,136
Oh, hello, Joan.

1213
01:08:18,474 --> 01:08:20,909
I'm sure I'm not ruining
any surprises at this point,

1214
01:08:20,911 --> 01:08:23,145
but how was your party?
I'm sorry I missed it.

1215
01:08:23,147 --> 01:08:26,449
Oh, he's adorable.

1216
01:08:26,451 --> 01:08:27,850
Are we welcoming you back?

1217
01:08:27,852 --> 01:08:29,886
- That was my impression.
- Today?

1218
01:08:29,888 --> 01:08:32,322
- Do you want to hold him?
- What?

1219
01:08:38,730 --> 01:08:40,865
He's a little cabbage.

1220
01:08:40,867 --> 01:08:43,234
<i>Mon petit chou.</i>

1221
01:08:43,236 --> 01:08:46,904
It's just a matter
of time, Don.

1222
01:08:46,906 --> 01:08:49,207
I should be getting
back to work.

1223
01:08:53,079 --> 01:08:55,214
I'm gonna quit while I'm ahead.

1224
01:08:55,216 --> 01:08:57,016
Joanie, I'll say what I
said when you left here--

1225
01:08:57,018 --> 01:08:58,818
This is not a good excuse.

1226
01:08:58,820 --> 01:09:00,988
Nice to see you.

1227
01:09:00,990 --> 01:09:04,024
- When are you coming back?
- I was planning on three weeks.

1228
01:09:04,026 --> 01:09:06,360
My mother's leaving any day,
so I was gonna hire a girl.

1229
01:09:06,362 --> 01:09:09,597
It's gonna be
terrible to leave him.

1230
01:09:09,599 --> 01:09:12,667
Joan.

1231
01:09:12,669 --> 01:09:14,903
I was wondering if you
were going to visit.

1232
01:09:17,207 --> 01:09:19,207
Oh, my hands are dirty.

1233
01:09:19,209 --> 01:09:21,309
Oh, my God.
He looks just like you.

1234
01:09:21,311 --> 01:09:24,779
I should get back to work.
I have more than ever, thanks to you, Joan.

1235
01:09:24,781 --> 01:09:26,447
Good.

1236
01:09:29,317 --> 01:09:31,251
So, how are you?

1237
01:09:31,253 --> 01:09:33,252
Roger:
<i>Well, well, well.</i>

1238
01:09:33,254 --> 01:09:35,221
There's my baby.

1239
01:09:35,223 --> 01:09:37,957
Now move that brat out
of the way so I can see her.

1240
01:09:37,959 --> 01:09:39,760
Hello, Roger.

1241
01:09:39,762 --> 01:09:41,562
Little dud like my present?

1242
01:09:41,564 --> 01:09:43,263
I'm sure you're aware

1243
01:09:43,265 --> 01:09:45,532
that a bicycle's not
useful yet, Uncle Roger.

1244
01:09:45,534 --> 01:09:47,101
Oh, no?
He's a loafer?

1245
01:09:47,103 --> 01:09:49,470
He's been keeping me awake.

1246
01:09:49,472 --> 01:09:51,406
He needs constant attention.

1247
01:09:51,408 --> 01:09:54,209
Is that right?
Let me see that.

1248
01:09:59,749 --> 01:10:02,718
Has anyone even seen this baby
with you walking next to him?

1249
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:04,119
<i>( Intercom buzzes )</i>

1250
01:10:04,121 --> 01:10:06,321
Lane: <i>Scarlett.</i>
<i>Scarlett, may I see you?</i>

1251
01:10:06,323 --> 01:10:07,956
I got it.

1252
01:10:10,259 --> 01:10:11,726
( High voice )
Mr. Pryce,

1253
01:10:11,728 --> 01:10:13,527
Mrs. Harris is here
to see you.

1254
01:10:13,529 --> 01:10:16,997
- <i>Oh, send her in.</i>
<i>- I've got him.</i>

1255
01:10:16,999 --> 01:10:20,434
Caroline, I need you to make
dinner reservations right away.

1256
01:10:22,070 --> 01:10:24,104
I'll be right back.

1257
01:10:29,578 --> 01:10:31,846
This really is
an unexpected pleasure.

1258
01:10:31,848 --> 01:10:33,682
Just stopping by.

1259
01:10:35,251 --> 01:10:37,152
Anything I should know about?

1260
01:10:37,154 --> 01:10:40,622
Uh, yes, actually.
Pressing business.

1261
01:10:42,525 --> 01:10:45,093
Would you mind?

1262
01:10:45,095 --> 01:10:47,862
No, not at all.

1263
01:10:52,802 --> 01:10:55,837
What are we supposed
to do with him?

1264
01:10:55,839 --> 01:10:57,805
Better than the steps
of a church, I guess.

1265
01:11:00,575 --> 01:11:02,109
Have either of you seen Clara?

1266
01:11:02,111 --> 01:11:04,512
No.

1267
01:11:04,514 --> 01:11:06,080
What's that?

1268
01:11:06,082 --> 01:11:08,282
Oh, it's Joan's little boy.

1269
01:11:10,652 --> 01:11:13,953
Oh, that's darling.

1270
01:11:13,955 --> 01:11:16,823
Would you please take him
and give him back to Joan?

1271
01:11:16,825 --> 01:11:19,826
Do I suddenly appear
to be wearing a skirt?

1272
01:11:19,828 --> 01:11:22,930
Spectacular party.

1273
01:11:22,932 --> 01:11:25,200
Just take him.
You should say hello to Joan anyways.

1274
01:11:33,176 --> 01:11:35,411
Clara?

1275
01:11:35,413 --> 01:11:37,179
She looks very good.

1276
01:11:37,181 --> 01:11:40,048
She does.
She looked good at nine months.

1277
01:11:40,050 --> 01:11:42,117
I don't know about that.

1278
01:11:44,453 --> 01:11:46,053
I'm surprised
you didn't tell her.

1279
01:11:46,055 --> 01:11:48,822
- Tell her what?
- That she looked terrible.

1280
01:11:48,824 --> 01:11:52,025
You seem to say
whatever's on your mind.

1281
01:11:52,027 --> 01:11:53,994
Is something wrong?

1282
01:11:55,162 --> 01:11:56,730
No.

1283
01:11:56,732 --> 01:11:59,933
I got the vicks coupons done.

1284
01:11:59,935 --> 01:12:03,104
I know you thought you were the
only one working this weekend.

1285
01:12:03,106 --> 01:12:05,706
No, I didn't.

1286
01:12:05,708 --> 01:12:08,943
Really?
That's what you said to Don.

1287
01:12:10,246 --> 01:12:12,447
I know.

1288
01:12:12,449 --> 01:12:14,983
I just-- I had too
much to drink and--

1289
01:12:14,985 --> 01:12:17,386
And you couldn't resist
saying something obnoxious?

1290
01:12:17,388 --> 01:12:19,688
Well, just so we're clear,

1291
01:12:19,690 --> 01:12:22,357
I put in a lot of work on Heinz.
So did you.

1292
01:12:22,359 --> 01:12:25,559
You can't even apologize.
None of you can.

1293
01:12:27,495 --> 01:12:31,164
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?

1294
01:12:31,166 --> 01:12:33,366
What is wrong with you people?

1295
01:12:33,368 --> 01:12:36,102
You're all so cynical.
You don't smile.

1296
01:12:36,104 --> 01:12:38,504
- You smirk.
- Is he mad at me?

1297
01:12:38,506 --> 01:12:40,773
I don't care.

1298
01:12:40,775 --> 01:12:42,908
Who wouldn't want
a surprise party?

1299
01:12:46,446 --> 01:12:48,213
I don't feel well.

1300
01:12:50,183 --> 01:12:54,618
- Megan...
- No, really, I don't-- I don't feel well.

1301
01:12:58,724 --> 01:13:01,358
Am I allowed to go home?

1302
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:03,427
Of course.

1303
01:13:05,897 --> 01:13:08,432
I'm so sorry.
You were right.

1304
01:13:08,434 --> 01:13:10,534
I apologize.

1305
01:13:12,103 --> 01:13:14,337
It's fine.

1306
01:13:25,145 --> 01:13:27,313
Lane: Heinz won't
sign off on the work.

1307
01:13:27,315 --> 01:13:29,515
So they won't be back in
for 30 days,

1308
01:13:29,517 --> 01:13:31,951
which means we won't get
paid for another 90.

1309
01:13:31,953 --> 01:13:33,787
And we're about
to shoot Christmas ads

1310
01:13:33,789 --> 01:13:35,656
for Sugarberry and Vicks.

1311
01:13:35,658 --> 01:13:37,658
But they won't run
until Christmas,

1312
01:13:37,660 --> 01:13:39,960
so we won't get paid
until easter.

1313
01:13:39,962 --> 01:13:43,596
Well, that explains why you're
asking me for all this free advice.

1314
01:13:43,598 --> 01:13:46,198
Oh, I'm just trying
to get things in order.

1315
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:48,233
So that you can
eliminate my job?

1316
01:13:48,235 --> 01:13:50,135
What?
Absolutely not.

1317
01:13:50,137 --> 01:13:53,105
- Then why did you run an ad?
- What ad?

1318
01:13:53,107 --> 01:13:56,075
- In this morning's Times.
- <i>Oh, that.</i>

1319
01:13:56,077 --> 01:13:58,277
That wasn't an ad.

1320
01:13:58,279 --> 01:14:00,513
Well, what the hell
was it, then?

1321
01:14:00,515 --> 01:14:04,083
It was some private
Barb directed at Y&R.

1322
01:14:07,587 --> 01:14:10,523
Mrs. Harris, the books
have practically

1323
01:14:10,525 --> 01:14:13,427
been held together
with spit in your absence.

1324
01:14:15,163 --> 01:14:18,098
What about Scarlett and Clara
splitting my work?

1325
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:20,233
Splitting?
The two of them together

1326
01:14:20,235 --> 01:14:23,203
couldn't operate a parking meter.
They're imbeciles.

1327
01:14:26,173 --> 01:14:29,241
Well, that was
a dumb thing to do.

1328
01:14:29,243 --> 01:14:31,944
Oh, there, there.

1329
01:14:34,780 --> 01:14:38,150
( Sobbing ) I'm sorry.

1330
01:14:38,152 --> 01:14:41,087
I've been like this
since the baby.

1331
01:14:41,089 --> 01:14:43,023
And it's not him.

1332
01:14:43,025 --> 01:14:45,759
I just...

1333
01:14:45,761 --> 01:14:48,829
Keep thinking about
what's going on here

1334
01:14:48,831 --> 01:14:51,099
and I missed it too much.

1335
01:14:51,101 --> 01:14:52,701
It's too embarrassing.

1336
01:14:52,703 --> 01:14:54,770
Nothing's happened.

1337
01:14:54,772 --> 01:14:57,473
Something always happens.
Things are different.

1338
01:14:57,475 --> 01:15:01,177
Somebody tells a joke and you don't
know what they're talking about.

1339
01:15:01,179 --> 01:15:05,214
There have been no jokes,
not without you.

1340
01:15:05,216 --> 01:15:07,249
Not even at my expense?

1341
01:15:07,251 --> 01:15:10,185
I'm terribly
adrift without you.

1342
01:15:10,187 --> 01:15:13,255
It's just a matter of time
before they find out I'm a sham.

1343
01:15:13,257 --> 01:15:15,991
( Sniffles )

1344
01:15:15,993 --> 01:15:18,594
Nobody came to visit me.

1345
01:15:18,596 --> 01:15:21,363
They sent flowers
with some stupid card

1346
01:15:21,365 --> 01:15:24,566
written by the florist.

1347
01:15:24,568 --> 01:15:27,569
There would have been a cake, but
you weren't here to arrange it.

1348
01:15:27,571 --> 01:15:29,738
( Laughs )

1349
01:15:31,373 --> 01:15:33,607
It's just--

1350
01:15:35,143 --> 01:15:37,678
And I don't expect you
to understand this--

1351
01:15:39,480 --> 01:15:42,482
but my husband's
been gone so long.

1352
01:15:42,484 --> 01:15:44,585
And I know he's coming
home soon.

1353
01:15:47,755 --> 01:15:49,989
And even with my baby
there and my mother...

1354
01:15:52,192 --> 01:15:54,226
I feel alone.

1355
01:15:55,796 --> 01:15:57,963
It's home, but
it's not everything.

1356
01:15:59,433 --> 01:16:01,334
I do understand.

1357
01:16:04,138 --> 01:16:08,508
Now, I won't have everyone
thinking I've made you cry.

1358
01:16:14,616 --> 01:16:16,650
Well, at least tell me
about the party.

1359
01:16:16,652 --> 01:16:19,019
Mrs. Draper put on
a bit of a burlesque.

1360
01:16:19,021 --> 01:16:21,187
- No.
- Oh, yes.

1361
01:16:21,189 --> 01:16:24,290
She danced and sang
in front of all of us.

1362
01:16:25,559 --> 01:16:27,359
She was quite the kickette.

1363
01:16:29,596 --> 01:16:32,263
( Laughs )

1364
01:16:33,866 --> 01:16:36,201
I can't do it justice.

1365
01:16:36,203 --> 01:16:38,537
And Don?

1366
01:16:38,539 --> 01:16:42,241
I saw his soul leave his body.

1367
01:16:42,243 --> 01:16:44,376
I can't even imagine

1368
01:16:44,378 --> 01:16:47,147
how handsome that man
must be blushing.

1369
01:16:47,149 --> 01:16:49,449
Yes.

1370
01:16:49,451 --> 01:16:51,318
<i>( Knocking )</i>

1371
01:16:58,460 --> 01:17:01,228
I don't know how I ended
up with him, but...

1372
01:17:01,230 --> 01:17:03,697
Thank you so much.

1373
01:17:07,701 --> 01:17:10,435
Mr. Pryce, I will
be speaking with you.

1374
01:17:10,437 --> 01:17:12,437
Let me take a look
at him at least.

1375
01:17:19,212 --> 01:17:21,213
Handsome little blackheart.

1376
01:17:22,616 --> 01:17:23,883
- ( Chuckles )
- ( Passes gas )

1377
01:17:23,885 --> 01:17:25,618
- Ah!
- ( Laughs )

1378
01:17:25,620 --> 01:17:29,322
Oops.
I think...

1379
01:17:29,324 --> 01:17:31,324
Have you seen Clara?

1380
01:17:31,326 --> 01:17:34,526
Clara: <i>Congratulations.
We're gonna be right next to each other finally.</i>

1381
01:17:34,528 --> 01:17:36,895
What's going on?

1382
01:17:36,897 --> 01:17:38,730
Clara, could you excuse us?

1383
01:17:38,732 --> 01:17:40,366
Well, she obviously
already knows.

1384
01:17:40,368 --> 01:17:42,101
Please.

1385
01:17:44,004 --> 01:17:46,339
Uh, Roger, you know,
convinced me.

1386
01:17:46,341 --> 01:17:49,442
We all thought it was best for the
firm that you have a bigger office,

1387
01:17:49,444 --> 01:17:52,045
so I was asked to switch.

1388
01:17:52,047 --> 01:17:54,013
I'll be right back.

1389
01:17:57,851 --> 01:17:59,618
I appreciate your sacrifice,

1390
01:17:59,620 --> 01:18:01,521
but a bigger office
was not the point.

1391
01:18:01,523 --> 01:18:03,256
Well, fine, then.
I'll switch back.

1392
01:18:03,258 --> 01:18:05,826
Roger didn't say
I couldn't switch back.

1393
01:18:05,828 --> 01:18:08,161
I don't care what Roger says.
I am the head of accounts.

1394
01:18:08,163 --> 01:18:10,930
I am bringing in all the business.
I deserve the bigger office.

1395
01:18:10,932 --> 01:18:13,432
It's a great office, Pete.

1396
01:18:13,434 --> 01:18:15,568
It's very important.

1397
01:18:15,570 --> 01:18:18,538
It's got the windows.
God, I'm gonna miss them.

1398
01:18:18,540 --> 01:18:21,040
And you did this because
Roger told you to?

1399
01:18:21,042 --> 01:18:23,143
And also because
I respect you so much.

1400
01:18:23,145 --> 01:18:24,878
What do you want me to say?

1401
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:27,347
Look, I just need a place
to hide until Megan leaves.

1402
01:18:28,883 --> 01:18:31,085
Oh, God, unless she told Don.

1403
01:18:31,087 --> 01:18:33,154
She's not gonna
tell Don, is she?

1404
01:18:35,690 --> 01:18:37,891
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1405
01:18:39,693 --> 01:18:42,228
- <i>( Knocks )</i>
<i>- Come in.</i>

1406
01:18:49,869 --> 01:18:51,736
What's up?

1407
01:18:53,672 --> 01:18:57,074
At your party,
which was lovely,

1408
01:18:57,076 --> 01:18:59,276
I said something which
I shouldn't have said.

1409
01:18:59,278 --> 01:19:02,078
And I want to apologize

1410
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:04,114
if you had a bad
time because of it.

1411
01:19:04,116 --> 01:19:05,949
I had a wonderful time.

1412
01:19:05,951 --> 01:19:08,285
Well, good.

1413
01:19:08,287 --> 01:19:10,053
The only reason
I'm bringing it up

1414
01:19:10,055 --> 01:19:12,355
is Megan seemed kind of upset.

1415
01:19:15,026 --> 01:19:17,894
I'm very sorry.
I should not be allowed

1416
01:19:17,896 --> 01:19:21,065
to drink at work functions.
Or at all, honestly.

1417
01:19:21,067 --> 01:19:23,100
- What did she say?
- Nothing.

1418
01:19:23,102 --> 01:19:26,370
But she went home.
She wasn't feeling well.

1419
01:19:26,372 --> 01:19:29,372
I'm mortified if I had
something to do with it.

1420
01:19:29,374 --> 01:19:31,241
When did she leave?

1421
01:19:31,243 --> 01:19:33,076
I think she wants to be alone.

1422
01:19:33,078 --> 01:19:35,211
You don't know her at all.

1423
01:19:36,313 --> 01:19:37,881
Caroline.

1424
01:19:37,883 --> 01:19:40,050
I'm done for the day.

1425
01:19:47,119 --> 01:19:49,287
- <i>( Intercom buzzes )</i>
- <i>Mr. Pryce.</i>

1426
01:19:55,293 --> 01:19:57,594
- Yes, Scarlett?
- <i>There's a gentleman here,</i>

1427
01:19:57,629 --> 01:20:00,665
<i>the owner of the wallet--</i>
<i>Mr. Polito.</i>

1428
01:20:00,699 --> 01:20:02,766
<i>He's in reception.</i>
<i>Shall I bring him back?</i>

1429
01:20:02,801 --> 01:20:05,269
No, absolutely not.

1430
01:20:05,303 --> 01:20:06,870
<i>Well, do you want to see him?</i>

1431
01:20:06,905 --> 01:20:10,274
Yes, I'll be out in a moment.

1432
01:20:10,308 --> 01:20:12,243
<i>Of course, Mr. Pryce.</i>

1433
01:20:12,277 --> 01:20:14,345
Thank you, Delores.

1434
01:20:14,379 --> 01:20:17,181
- <i>Excuse me?</i>
- I said just a minute.

1435
01:20:34,567 --> 01:20:36,067
Hello.

1436
01:20:37,270 --> 01:20:38,903
Are you Mr. Polito?

1437
01:20:38,938 --> 01:20:42,474
I am. Although there's no
way for you to know that.

1438
01:20:42,508 --> 01:20:44,175
You got my wallet.

1439
01:20:44,210 --> 01:20:46,111
I contacted you.

1440
01:20:46,145 --> 01:20:48,547
Thank you.

1441
01:20:48,581 --> 01:20:50,916
Well, I'm glad this worked out.

1442
01:20:50,950 --> 01:20:52,317
Hold on.

1443
01:20:52,351 --> 01:20:53,818
Just hold on a second.

1444
01:20:59,325 --> 01:21:01,826
Everything's there.

1445
01:21:09,802 --> 01:21:11,503
So it is.

1446
01:21:14,741 --> 01:21:17,509
Well, you can't blame me.

1447
01:21:17,544 --> 01:21:20,146
My horse came in
and I lost my wallet.

1448
01:21:20,180 --> 01:21:21,747
Then it came in again.

1449
01:21:23,584 --> 01:21:26,420
- Here.
- No, that's not necessary.

1450
01:21:26,454 --> 01:21:29,523
- You've got to take a reward.
- I couldn't possibly.

1451
01:21:32,861 --> 01:21:34,595
My girl said
you were real polite.

1452
01:21:36,798 --> 01:21:39,532
Obviously from the accent,
you're not from around here.

1453
01:21:39,566 --> 01:21:42,535
No, I'm not.

1454
01:21:45,838 --> 01:21:47,572
This is the way we do things.

1455
01:21:51,310 --> 01:21:53,544
Thanks again.
I mean it.

1456
01:21:54,380 --> 01:21:55,813
You're a real gentleman.

1457
01:22:14,433 --> 01:22:17,235
Megan?
Where are you?

1458
01:22:19,973 --> 01:22:22,409
Oh, you're home.

1459
01:22:22,443 --> 01:22:24,578
So are you.
What happened?

1460
01:22:24,612 --> 01:22:26,046
Nothing.

1461
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:28,249
You just left without me?

1462
01:22:28,283 --> 01:22:31,352
- I was upset.
- That's clear.

1463
01:22:31,386 --> 01:22:33,020
About what?

1464
01:22:33,055 --> 01:22:35,456
Because my apartment is filthy.

1465
01:22:35,491 --> 01:22:37,925
Where's the girl?

1466
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:40,128
I sent her home.

1467
01:22:48,970 --> 01:22:51,404
What are you doing?

1468
01:22:51,439 --> 01:22:54,041
I'm cleaning up.
I don't want to get sweaty.

1469
01:22:54,075 --> 01:22:57,844
- Like that?
- Don't you look at me.

1470
01:22:57,878 --> 01:22:59,746
I'm talking to you.

1471
01:23:01,481 --> 01:23:03,282
I'm cleaning up.

1472
01:23:03,316 --> 01:23:04,917
Really?

1473
01:23:04,951 --> 01:23:08,353
Stop looking at me.
You aren't allowed to look at me.

1474
01:23:08,388 --> 01:23:10,022
Then put some clothes on.

1475
01:23:10,056 --> 01:23:13,092
I said stop it.
You don't deserve it.

1476
01:23:13,126 --> 01:23:15,427
Come on.

1477
01:23:15,462 --> 01:23:18,531
You don't like presents.
You don't like nice things.

1478
01:23:27,174 --> 01:23:30,142
Besides, you're too old.

1479
01:23:30,177 --> 01:23:32,311
I don't need an old person.

1480
01:23:32,346 --> 01:23:34,013
You probably couldn't
do it anyway.

1481
01:23:34,047 --> 01:23:36,182
Don't.

1482
01:23:36,216 --> 01:23:37,817
- Get up.
- No.

1483
01:23:37,851 --> 01:23:40,052
I don't want people to
think you're getting this.

1484
01:23:41,421 --> 01:23:43,723
- You want it so badly.
- I don't want it.

1485
01:23:43,757 --> 01:23:45,992
I don't want you.

1486
01:23:46,026 --> 01:23:48,428
You don't get to have this.
Go sit over there.

1487
01:23:48,462 --> 01:23:50,797
All you get to do is watch.

1488
01:23:53,500 --> 01:23:55,268
( Gasps )

1489
01:24:18,224 --> 01:24:20,057
Where's Harry?

1490
01:24:20,092 --> 01:24:22,827
Who cares?

1491
01:24:22,861 --> 01:24:25,195
Oh, I'm sorry.
Do you need to see Mr. Campbell?

1492
01:24:25,230 --> 01:24:26,763
No.

1493
01:24:28,533 --> 01:24:30,901
Is Roger Sterling still here?

1494
01:24:30,935 --> 01:24:32,603
Yes.

1495
01:24:32,637 --> 01:24:34,872
I want you to let him do
whatever he wants.

1496
01:24:34,906 --> 01:24:37,041
And I want you to pencil in
an appointment tomorrow

1497
01:24:37,075 --> 01:24:40,078
at the coffee shop in the ferry
building in Staten Island.

1498
01:24:40,112 --> 01:24:42,147
6:00 A.M.

1499
01:24:42,181 --> 01:24:45,551
With Coca-Cola.

1500
01:24:45,585 --> 01:24:47,753
Okay.

1501
01:24:49,223 --> 01:24:50,790
That'll be all.

1502
01:25:16,114 --> 01:25:18,616
I don't think
those people like me.

1503
01:25:20,252 --> 01:25:22,486
That's not true.

1504
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:26,656
Well, I'm not sure I like them.

1505
01:25:32,330 --> 01:25:35,466
The reason I didn't want
you to have that party is

1506
01:25:35,501 --> 01:25:39,004
I didn't want them in our home.

1507
01:25:39,038 --> 01:25:41,940
You've only been in the
creative end of this business

1508
01:25:41,974 --> 01:25:43,575
for three months.

1509
01:25:43,610 --> 01:25:46,979
And being a secretary,
you don't know what goes on.

1510
01:25:47,014 --> 01:25:51,017
There isn't one problem that Peggy
or anybody in that office has

1511
01:25:51,051 --> 01:25:53,686
that wasn't there before you.

1512
01:25:58,459 --> 01:26:00,760
You think you're a splinter?

1513
01:26:00,794 --> 01:26:02,528
You're not.

1514
01:26:02,562 --> 01:26:05,797
The whole foot's been
infected for years.

1515
01:26:10,369 --> 01:26:12,671
I love going to work with you

1516
01:26:12,705 --> 01:26:17,009
because you love work
and you love me.

1517
01:26:17,043 --> 01:26:20,312
But I wonder if

1518
01:26:20,346 --> 01:26:22,748
maybe it's not a good idea.

1519
01:26:25,451 --> 01:26:28,052
I don't really care about work.

1520
01:26:28,087 --> 01:26:30,388
I want you at work

1521
01:26:30,422 --> 01:26:32,657
because I want you.

1522
01:26:43,067 --> 01:26:45,735
I think we have to
replace the rug.

1523
01:26:49,240 --> 01:26:52,175
Just because you see white carpet in a
magazine doesn't mean it's practical.

1524
01:26:52,209 --> 01:26:53,877
It's beautiful.

1525
01:26:53,911 --> 01:26:57,314
Well, I've taken a lot of
pictures of white carpets.

1526
01:26:57,348 --> 01:27:00,585
You have to have
four or five on hand.

1527
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:03,789
I thought you wanted it.

1528
01:27:05,625 --> 01:27:08,294
I just wanted you
to have what you want.

1529
01:27:47,435 --> 01:27:48,936
What are you doing?

1530
01:27:48,970 --> 01:27:51,071
I've got to go
to Staten Island.

1531
01:27:51,106 --> 01:27:53,674
- What time is it?
- Shut up.

1532
01:27:57,947 --> 01:27:59,981
An aboveground pool?

1533
01:28:00,015 --> 01:28:02,783
No, no, in the ground.
With deck chairs.

1534
01:28:02,818 --> 01:28:05,619
That costs a fortune.
You gonna dig it yourself?

1535
01:28:05,654 --> 01:28:08,122
We'll see what happens
at Christmas.

1536
01:28:08,156 --> 01:28:10,157
I never count on a bonus.

1537
01:28:10,192 --> 01:28:12,993
I'm not talking to you.

1538
01:28:13,028 --> 01:28:15,162
I hope to be dead by Christmas.

1539
01:28:15,197 --> 01:28:17,799
( All laugh )

1540
01:28:23,974 --> 01:28:26,408
Do you have any money
for the grocer?

1541
01:28:26,443 --> 01:28:28,277
You told me not
to write any checks.

1542
01:28:28,311 --> 01:28:30,379
No, of course.

1543
01:28:41,725 --> 01:28:44,327
Shh.

1544
01:28:49,633 --> 01:28:51,100
Shh.

1545
01:28:51,135 --> 01:28:53,403
He's finally gone to sleep.

1546
01:29:06,550 --> 01:29:08,584
<i>( Elevator dings )</i>

1547
01:29:31,676 --> 01:29:34,178
We cannot call security.
They are applicants.

1548
01:29:35,781 --> 01:29:37,948
What's going on out there?

1549
01:29:37,983 --> 01:29:41,419
They're all here responding to
your hilarious advertisement.

1550
01:29:41,453 --> 01:29:43,454
Oh.

1551
01:29:45,190 --> 01:29:47,991
Is it just me, or is the
lobby full of negroes?

1552
01:29:48,026 --> 01:29:50,694
- They saw the Y&R ad.
- ( Laughs )

1553
01:29:50,728 --> 01:29:52,629
The humor was lost on them.

1554
01:29:52,663 --> 01:29:55,532
- Not on me.
- It was a childish prank.

1555
01:29:55,567 --> 01:29:57,835
Because you're
above that, right?

1556
01:29:57,869 --> 01:29:59,236
What are we gonna do?

1557
01:29:59,271 --> 01:30:00,972
Would you leave us be, dear?

1558
01:30:02,442 --> 01:30:04,409
Tell them the position's
been filled.

1559
01:30:04,444 --> 01:30:07,713
There's the possibility that we
could be the subject of a protest.

1560
01:30:07,747 --> 01:30:09,849
Then we interview them.
Forever. They'll go away.

1561
01:30:09,883 --> 01:30:11,784
That is not a solution.

1562
01:30:11,818 --> 01:30:13,919
And who's to say there's
not a reporter out there?

1563
01:30:13,954 --> 01:30:15,287
I don't know why
we can't just hire one.

1564
01:30:15,322 --> 01:30:17,756
Because we're not
hiring anyone.

1565
01:30:17,791 --> 01:30:19,058
Just fire that receptionist.

1566
01:30:19,092 --> 01:30:20,793
We can't have one out there.

1567
01:30:26,433 --> 01:30:29,402
- What is that?
- It's from Young & Rubicam.

1568
01:30:32,139 --> 01:30:33,907
It's a resume.

1569

01:30:33,941 --> 01:30:36,076
"1960 to '65,

1570
01:30:36,110 --> 01:30:39,046
toted dat barge,
lifted dat bale."

1571
01:30:39,081 --> 01:30:40,949
( Laughs )

1572
01:30:40,983 --> 01:30:43,051
Did those people out there

1573
01:30:43,085 --> 01:30:45,921
see that artifact come in here?

1574
01:30:45,955 --> 01:30:49,091
Yes.
I'm positive.

1575
01:30:59,969 --> 01:31:01,703
Good morning.

1576
01:31:01,737 --> 01:31:03,838
I'd like to thank
you all for coming.

1577
01:31:03,872 --> 01:31:07,474
First of all, we're only
looking for secretaries.

1578
01:31:07,509 --> 01:31:10,310
So, gentlemen,
you are free to leave.

1579
01:31:10,345 --> 01:31:12,713
I mean, you are
welcome to leave.

1580
01:31:12,747 --> 01:31:16,117
I mean, you may go.
( Clears throat )

1581
01:31:18,554 --> 01:31:20,622
I will be collecting resumes.

1582
01:31:20,656 --> 01:31:23,425
And then those of you
who meet the qualifications

1583
01:31:23,459 --> 01:31:26,862
will receive a call
to schedule an interview.

1584
01:31:26,897 --> 01:31:28,397
