00:00:05,893 --> 00:00:07,501
<I>Previously on "Mad Men"...</I>

2
00:00:08,489 --> 00:00:09,734
Who's your little friend here?

3
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:11,104
She's the new girl.

4
00:00:11,413 --> 00:00:12,613
Management gets all the perks.

5
00:00:12,715 --> 00:00:13,760
Why are you here?

6
00:00:13,936 --> 00:00:15,228
I'm gettin' married on sunday.

7
00:00:16,665 --> 00:00:18,782
I'm your boss, not your boyfriend.

8
00:00:19,035 --> 00:00:20,409
We can say anything we want.

9
00:00:20,561 --> 00:00:21,571
I get it.

10
00:00:21,665 --> 00:00:23,037
Don thanks again for the home run.

11
00:00:23,215 --> 00:00:24,495
I love to come through.

12
00:00:24,853 --> 00:00:25,853
I Don't make plans...

13
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:27,119
And I Don't make breakfast.

14
00:00:28,665 --> 00:00:29,785
There's a plate in the oven.

15
00:00:31,789 --> 00:00:33,309
I'm living like there's no tomorrow...

16
00:00:34,037 --> 00:00:35,037
Because there isn't one.

17
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:14,216
Season 1 Episode 2
<i>Ladies Room</i>

18
00:01:27,656 --> 00:01:29,518
You should get him
to put another egg in it.

19
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:31,807
- Roger.
- Darling, one egg is good...

20
00:01:31,989 --> 00:01:33,445
Two eggs are better.

23
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:36,015
Tell the, uh, lieutenant, please,

24
00:01:36,215 --> 00:01:38,974
that things are getting
a little dry around code 29.

25
00:01:39,331 --> 00:01:40,364
Am I wrong?

26
00:01:40,575 --> 00:01:42,101
All clear in no man's land.

27
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:45,592
Roger, you've expressed
your desire for another drink,

28
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:47,158
no need to take the orders.

29
00:01:47,384 --> 00:01:48,410
Right away, sir.

30
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:49,691
Wine list?

31
00:01:49,702 --> 00:01:52,579
And I'll have another one of these
while I'm waiting for the list.

32
00:01:53,261 --> 00:01:54,515
Another egg.

33
00:01:55,139 --> 00:01:56,419
Well, I am having fried chicken.

34
00:01:57,077 --> 00:01:58,317
As long as the egg comes first.

35
00:01:58,638 --> 00:02:00,078
My nanny, belva, made fried chicken.

36
00:02:00,201 --> 00:02:02,819
I used to take it to school
wrapped in wax paper.

37
00:02:03,891 --> 00:02:06,449
His sweet belvedere,
he really loved that woman.

38
00:02:07,014 --> 00:02:08,849
Had another nanny
originally, german girl,

39
00:02:09,203 --> 00:02:10,283
round face, enormous bosom.

40
00:02:11,519 --> 00:02:14,117
My parents got rid of her
after the Lindbergh baby.

41
00:02:14,829 --> 00:02:16,149
We thought about getting a nanny.

42
00:02:16,577 --> 00:02:19,496
We have a girl that comes in
as sort of a house keeper

43
00:02:19,956 --> 00:02:20,956
and sometimes babysitter.

44
00:02:21,314 --> 00:02:23,058
I let her take the children
to play group,

45
00:02:23,269 --> 00:02:24,514
sometimes the park.

46
00:02:24,925 --> 00:02:26,052
Belva raised me.

47
00:02:26,252 --> 00:02:27,639
I turned out just fine.

48
00:02:28,141 --> 00:02:29,541
Didn't have to go to a psychiatrist

49
00:02:29,655 --> 00:02:30,665
like some people's kids.

50
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:31,830
Oh, what's the big deal?

51
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,060
Margaret is practically the last girl

52
00:02:34,267 --> 00:02:35,267
in our building to go.

53
00:02:35,578 --> 00:02:37,634
Sixteen-years-old,
wouldn't get out of bed.

54
00:02:37,864 --> 00:02:40,175
I tell ya, I can not wait
until that girl

55
00:02:40,455 --> 00:02:41,455
is another man's problem.

56
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:43,946
What about you, Don,
did you have a nanny?

57
00:02:45,767 --> 00:02:47,207
I can't tell you about my childhood,

58
00:02:47,582 --> 00:02:49,102
it'll ruin the first half of my novel.

59
00:02:49,768 --> 00:02:51,328
Don doesn't like to talk about himself.

60
00:02:51,889 --> 00:02:52,929
I know better than to ask.

61
00:02:53,085 --> 00:02:55,230
An add man who doesn't like
to talk about himself...

62
00:02:55,335 --> 00:02:56,455
I think I may cry.

63
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:58,690
It's not that interesting a story,

64
00:02:59,705 --> 00:03:00,745
just think of me as moses.

65
00:03:03,018 --> 00:03:04,018
I was a baby in a basket.

66
00:03:05,267 --> 00:03:06,307
To moses and Don Draper...

67
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,580
Couple of princes.

68
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,460
If the gentleman will be patient.

69
00:03:14,831 --> 00:03:15,831
I'll join you.

70
00:03:25,518 --> 00:03:27,078
I think I may know more about your wife

71
00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:28,329
than I do about my own.

72
00:03:28,934 --> 00:03:30,970
Maybe your wife is just
a better drinker.

73
00:03:31,205 --> 00:03:32,205
Entirely possible.

74
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:48,913
Mona, can you help me here.

75
00:03:49,143 --> 00:03:50,503
I've seem to grow a set of thumbs.

76
00:03:51,997 --> 00:03:54,831
Do you ever have that
when your hands go numb?

77
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:59,133
Want me to touch you up?

78
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,093
I think you'll have to.

79
00:04:03,765 --> 00:04:05,594
Look at those lips.

80
00:04:06,756 --> 00:04:07,836
I bet it's not hard for you

81
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:09,830
to hold on to a man like that.

82
00:04:11,128 --> 00:04:12,488
Don't smile, it'll make it harder.

83
00:04:15,607 --> 00:04:18,220
It's hard to hold on
to anything right now

84
00:04:18,542 --> 00:04:21,336
with the children and running the house.

85
00:04:21,878 --> 00:04:22,958
I Don't know if I told you,

86
00:04:23,004 --> 00:04:24,444
but my mother died three months ago.

87
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,256
I'm sorry...

88
00:04:30,006 --> 00:04:32,966
There are other ladies
waiting to use the mirror.

89
00:04:40,819 --> 00:04:41,979
Those purses get any smaller,

90
00:04:42,316 --> 00:04:43,316
we're gonna starve.

91
00:04:50,004 --> 00:04:51,164
I loved seeing you like that.

92
00:04:53,004 --> 00:04:54,564
Well, you were sitting on my good side.

93
00:04:55,353 --> 00:04:59,152
No, I mean, the way
other people see you.

94
00:05:00,557 --> 00:05:03,853
When you're with strangers
you know exactly what you want.

95
00:05:04,318 --> 00:05:06,695
Well, I'd like to think
I always know what I want.

96
00:05:07,568 --> 00:05:08,568
Um, slow down.

97
00:05:10,504 --> 00:05:11,744
I have to put that in my diary.

98
00:05:12,207 --> 00:05:14,483
Lobster, Newberg, and Gimlets
should get a divorce.

99
00:05:15,193 --> 00:05:16,633
They're not getting along very well.

100
00:05:17,466 --> 00:05:19,251
Once you rounded the corner
on number two,

101
00:05:19,441 --> 00:05:21,156
I took it for a case of nerves.

102
00:05:21,692 --> 00:05:22,692
He's your boss.

103
00:05:24,692 --> 00:05:25,692
He likes you.

104
00:05:27,381 --> 00:05:28,421
Toujour means he likes me.

105
00:05:30,818 --> 00:05:32,258
When he gets us to the four seasons,

106
00:05:32,755 --> 00:05:33,915
then we'll know he trusts me.

107
00:05:35,442 --> 00:05:36,562
He seemed very forth coming.

108
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:39,669
He was stoned on martinis.

109
00:05:41,129 --> 00:05:42,129
I Don't know...

110
00:05:42,713 --> 00:05:47,094
It all seemed like
an invitation to-to confide.

111
00:05:49,131 --> 00:05:50,331
Well, maybe it's just manners,

112
00:05:51,192 --> 00:05:54,394
but I was raised to see it
as a sin of pride

113
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:56,852
to go on like that about yourself.

114
00:05:57,568 --> 00:05:58,568
You're so reverent.

115
00:06:13,133 --> 00:06:14,133
Did you have a nanny?

116
00:06:15,193 --> 00:06:16,233
I've never asked you that.

117
00:06:16,794 --> 00:06:18,925
Why? What difference does it make?

118
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:22,405
I Don't know.
We've never talked about it.

119
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,130
Did you?

120
00:06:27,651 --> 00:06:29,005
No, of course not.

121
00:06:30,878 --> 00:06:33,133
So your mother and
your father are responsible

122
00:06:33,507 --> 00:06:34,507
for all this?

123
00:06:36,133 --> 00:06:37,413
I'll have to thank them someday.

124
00:06:38,069 --> 00:06:42,129
Jesus, bets, it's like politics,
religion,

125
00:06:42,758 --> 00:06:43,758
or sex...

126
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:46,571
Why talk about it?

127
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:51,809
I see your point.

128
00:07:19,433 --> 00:07:20,433
Who's in there?

129
00:07:30,133 --> 00:07:32,786
Peggy, next step is accessories.

130
00:07:34,113 --> 00:07:37,807
$35 a week minus 6.75 for fica.

131
00:07:38,109 --> 00:07:39,455
Can you believe it?

132
00:07:39,797 --> 00:07:42,603
Maybe it's the fumes from
the rubber cement on that envelope,

133
00:07:42,942 --> 00:07:44,771
but there's nothing to be
happy about here.

134
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:47,462
Although, you never forget your worth.

135
00:07:47,727 --> 00:07:49,312
For two weeks, I've been telling people

136
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:51,056
I have a job in manhattan.

137
00:07:51,684 --> 00:07:52,964
Look at you, you're indomitable.

138
00:07:53,749 --> 00:07:57,187
You'd never know you were
the very bottom of the food chain.

139
00:07:58,807 --> 00:07:59,807
Bridget, are you okay?

140
00:08:06,741 --> 00:08:08,636
Thanks to the precision
valve corporation

141
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:10,032
for the next 18 months,

142
00:08:10,193 --> 00:08:12,203
Gillette is the only company on earth

143
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:14,266
that can spray deodorant out of a can.

144
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:16,717
Modern deodorant for a modern man.

145
00:08:17,558 --> 00:08:19,078
He prefers jet travel to train travel,

146
00:08:20,121 --> 00:08:21,121
vodka scotch,

147
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:23,742
and likes to get his news
from the radio, not the paper.

148
00:08:24,023 --> 00:08:25,491
Harold hill, give it a rest.

149
00:08:25,795 --> 00:08:27,845
Oh, do not puncture or incinerate...

150
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:29,317
Sounds dangerous.

151
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,935
Hey, I got a dud.

152
00:08:36,345 --> 00:08:38,300
How is it a guy as big as you, Ken,

153
00:08:38,662 --> 00:08:40,390
has no basketball skills?

154
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:42,579
I'm sure more research is need.

155
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:45,591
You should try it out.

156
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:47,839
Who smells bad in here?

157
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:51,339
Oh no, come on.

158
00:08:51,645 --> 00:08:52,652
Come on, Kenny.

159
00:08:52,777 --> 00:08:53,779
Knock it off!

160
00:08:53,819 --> 00:08:55,025
Just pretend it's prom night.

161
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:56,097
You can be the girl.

162
00:08:56,255 --> 00:08:57,338
Stop!

163
00:08:57,339 --> 00:08:58,419
All right, close your eyes.

164
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,665
Mr. Draper, I was buzzing you.

165
00:09:04,105 --> 00:09:05,841
Mr. Cooper is waiting.

166
00:09:07,389 --> 00:09:10,107
I always thought it was Sterling
who was responsible

167
00:09:10,779 --> 00:09:12,379
for the navy attitude around this place.

168
00:09:12,675 --> 00:09:13,901
Brazerre account...

169
00:09:14,223 --> 00:09:16,520
Just figured out
we can't sell 'em to men.

170
00:09:16,997 --> 00:09:19,992
So much yarn, so little time.

171
00:09:26,178 --> 00:09:27,618
So roger mentioned this nixon thing?

172
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:30,802
Yeah, he mentioned it.

173
00:09:30,864 --> 00:09:31,984
I just assumed it went away.

174
00:09:32,366 --> 00:09:33,366
It didn't.

175
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,951
The last I read, Nixon was running
without an agency.

176
00:09:36,091 --> 00:09:37,491
Make no mistake,

177
00:09:37,496 --> 00:09:39,056
we know better what dick nixon needs...

178
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,180
Better than dick nixon.

179
00:09:41,486 --> 00:09:43,491
And what does Dick Nixon think he needs?

180
00:09:43,492 --> 00:09:44,852
What he already has... Ted rogers,

181
00:09:45,992 --> 00:09:47,512
brains behind that checkers broadcast.

182
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:48,930
See the problem?

183
00:09:49,219 --> 00:09:51,611
He dodged a financial
scandal by standing

184
00:09:51,812 --> 00:09:53,455
with his wife and begging for his dog.

185
00:09:53,584 --> 00:09:55,240
An admission wrapped
in a distraction...

186
00:09:55,241 --> 00:09:56,491
I'd say they know what they're doing.

187
00:09:56,492 --> 00:09:57,502
Dogs are winners.

188
00:09:57,554 --> 00:09:58,743
Well, they think they're set without us.

189
00:09:58,744 --> 00:10:00,051
Why chase a girl that
doesn't want to get caught.

190
00:10:00,052 --> 00:10:01,252
You have a problem with Nixon?

191
00:10:02,303 --> 00:10:03,303
I Don't vote.

192
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:04,803
Hear-hear,

193
00:10:05,288 --> 00:10:07,448
but politics aside
these last eight years

194
00:10:07,589 --> 00:10:09,478
have been good to us
because they've been good

195
00:10:09,659 --> 00:10:12,809
to Proctor and Gamble and
united fruit company, etcetera.

196
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,819
So whether Dick Nixon likes it or not...

197
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:18,558
We will give our people
what they want, agreed?

198
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:20,892
<I>I said cut it out!</I>

199
00:10:21,336 --> 00:10:22,542
Be my pleasure.

200
00:10:22,944 --> 00:10:24,049
Goodie.

201
00:10:26,275 --> 00:10:28,930
Assemble a team.
Start files on contenders.

202
00:10:29,177 --> 00:10:30,431
Simington, Kennedy...

203
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:32,368
Who knows, maybe
Eleanor Roosevelt will throw

204
00:10:32,408 --> 00:10:34,177
her feed bag into the ring.

205
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:35,610
Don, you still on for lunch?

206
00:10:36,804 --> 00:10:37,804
No.

207
00:10:42,598 --> 00:10:44,072
Don't tell me that's lunch?

208
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,886
I've got a lot of work to catch up on.

209
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:50,045
I do that sometimes. Saunter over to
the pie cart, egg salad,

210
00:10:50,206 --> 00:10:51,975
and the worst cup of coffee
in the world...

211
00:10:52,179 --> 00:10:53,179
Thirty-five cents.

212
00:10:53,724 --> 00:10:55,308
I've been meaning to try it.

213
00:10:55,589 --> 00:10:57,384
It's okay if you like
ptomaine poisoning.

214
00:10:59,938 --> 00:11:01,554
Well, too-da-loo.

215
00:11:03,909 --> 00:11:05,243
Secretary, one.

216
00:11:05,479 --> 00:11:06,706
Copy-writer, zero.

217
00:11:07,015 --> 00:11:08,282
It wasn't that.

218
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:09,568
I bring my lunch,

219
00:11:09,689 --> 00:11:11,498
at least until after
the first of the month.

220
00:11:11,676 --> 00:11:12,869
Get your things.

221
00:11:13,597 --> 00:11:15,232
That sandwich is making me sad.

222
00:11:18,825 --> 00:11:21,001
It's a postcard from Campbell
on his honeymoon.

223
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,305
Niagara falls.

224
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:25,946
"Greetings from the wettest place
on earth."

225
00:11:27,694 --> 00:11:29,362
I say we skip lunch all together

226
00:11:29,554 --> 00:11:30,994
and try on those narrow sweater sets

227
00:11:31,055 --> 00:11:32,055
I saw at lord and taylor.

228
00:11:32,406 --> 00:11:34,479
Do you want me to sit outside
the dressing room

229
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,480
and hold your purse?

230
00:11:35,873 --> 00:11:38,250
What he's trying to say is,
can we buy you lunch?

231
00:11:39,978 --> 00:11:41,767
I Don't know,
we hadn't planned on eating.

232
00:11:41,981 --> 00:11:43,195
Come on, three on two.

233
00:11:43,326 --> 00:11:46,363
I know you all like to be out numbered.
It's two on two, I'm married.

234
00:11:47,076 --> 00:11:48,973
You still have to eat lunch.

235
00:11:49,392 --> 00:11:51,047
What do you say, change of plans?

236
00:11:51,462 --> 00:11:52,854
They do smell nice.

237
00:11:54,216 --> 00:11:55,362
What's that?

238
00:11:55,623 --> 00:11:57,285
Postcard from Pete Campbell.

239
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:58,375
He's on a honeymoon, right?

240
00:11:58,516 --> 00:11:59,541
Niagara falls.

241
00:11:59,682 --> 00:12:01,310
He hasn't left the room, apparently.

242
00:12:08,788 --> 00:12:10,215
Shall we?

243
00:12:15,687 --> 00:12:19,184
so, Peggs, you part of
our nations' military-

244
00:12:19,426 --> 00:12:21,858
industrial boyfriend-
girlfriend complex?

245
00:12:22,363 --> 00:12:23,368
Excuse me?

246
00:12:23,569 --> 00:12:26,223
He wants to know are
you taken, you kept,

247
00:12:26,263 --> 00:12:27,352
or merely browsing?

248
00:12:27,353 --> 00:12:28,353
She's browsing,

249
00:12:28,604 --> 00:12:30,124
and like most of us she's disappointed

250
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,776
with the selection of merchandise.

251
00:12:32,823 --> 00:12:34,939
Perhaps, I can interest you
in a 42 long.

252
00:12:35,729 --> 00:12:36,729
That's not his suit size.

253
00:12:38,978 --> 00:12:39,978
She blushes.

254
00:12:39,979 --> 00:12:40,980
No I Don't.

255
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,830
You know, maybe
I shouldn't tell you this,

256
00:12:42,924 --> 00:12:44,673
but you are the subject of much debate.

257
00:12:44,853 --> 00:12:46,587
Money riding on the outcome.

258
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:47,916
Money for me?

259
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:49,726
Now there's even a third possibility...

260
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:51,416
Paying you.

261
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:53,770
We should be getting back.

262
00:12:54,978 --> 00:12:55,978
I'll get the check.

263
00:12:56,104 --> 00:12:57,664
My goodness, thank you for lunch, boys.

264
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,480
Yes, thank you.

265
00:13:03,104 --> 00:13:04,704
Hmm, take the rest of the afternoon off.

266
00:13:05,481 --> 00:13:06,481
We could go to the zoo,

267
00:13:07,731 --> 00:13:08,971
see what the animals are up to.

268
00:13:10,417 --> 00:13:11,417
Um...

269
00:13:12,231 --> 00:13:13,231
I should get back to work

270
00:13:13,981 --> 00:13:14,981
or shopping.

271
00:13:16,745 --> 00:13:19,016
Guess you Don't seeing
any money changing hands, Kenny.

272
00:13:19,157 --> 00:13:21,651
You'll see...
My persistence is my charm.

273
00:13:22,442 --> 00:13:23,917
That was delicious.

274
00:13:29,868 --> 00:13:31,737
You enjoy yourself with
the hitler youth?

275
00:13:31,917 --> 00:13:34,129
Oh, well it was kind of last minute...

276
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:36,279
Easy... See that Draper takes
a look at these?

277
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,794
Certainly.

278
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:40,542
You can look too.

279
00:13:46,355 --> 00:13:47,635
Three of the last pta presidents

280
00:13:48,346 --> 00:13:49,793
are from the kindergarten class,

281
00:13:50,034 --> 00:13:52,110
I say you go in there and
lay some ground work.

282
00:13:52,481 --> 00:13:54,737
I will not have
Marilyn Keckner dictate the agenda.

283
00:13:54,973 --> 00:13:56,648
The woman is obsessed with nutrition.

284
00:13:57,006 --> 00:13:58,967
Although, you wouldn't know it
to look at her.

285
00:13:59,155 --> 00:14:00,895
Francine, you're terrible.

286
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:04,745
I ran into Juanita cabet
at square dancing

287
00:14:04,905 --> 00:14:06,251
and I found out who's moving into

288
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:08,201
that little dutch colonial
down the street.

289
00:14:08,539 --> 00:14:09,544
Who?

290
00:14:09,856 --> 00:14:10,856
Her name is helen bishop.

291
00:14:11,929 --> 00:14:12,929
Is she an old lady?

292
00:14:13,232 --> 00:14:14,232
Divorced.

293
00:14:14,733 --> 00:14:15,733
Really?

294
00:14:17,045 --> 00:14:18,205
Nine-year-old boy and a baby.

295
00:14:20,304 --> 00:14:21,606
That's awful.

296
00:14:21,607 --> 00:14:22,607
I know.

297
00:14:22,647 --> 00:14:23,668
All on her own?

298
00:14:23,669 --> 00:14:24,669
I know.

299
00:14:25,855 --> 00:14:27,295
Can you imagine worrying about money

300
00:14:27,732 --> 00:14:28,812
at this point in our lives.

301
00:14:30,154 --> 00:14:32,176
Well, obviously,
that's not the worst of it.

302
00:14:32,417 --> 00:14:33,731
No.

303
00:14:34,447 --> 00:14:35,919
No, it isn't.

304
00:14:36,781 --> 00:14:38,356
It is too quiet in there.

305
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:39,800
Ernie?

306
00:14:40,001 --> 00:14:41,006
Sally?

307
00:14:41,227 --> 00:14:43,277
We're playing space man.

308
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,817
Sally Draper come over here this minute.

309
00:14:50,134 --> 00:14:51,974
If the clothes from
that dry cleaning bag

310
00:14:52,092 --> 00:14:53,172
are on the floor my closet,

311
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:55,086
you're going to be
a very sorry young lady.

312
00:14:57,654 --> 00:15:00,379
Make sure your brother
hasn't climbed out of the play yard.

313
00:15:00,591 --> 00:15:02,600
Juanita it might be bad
for real estate value

314
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:03,839
and she'll mark...

315
00:15:04,149 --> 00:15:05,528
One divorcee?

316
00:15:19,346 --> 00:15:20,758
Bobby!

317
00:16:06,386 --> 00:16:07,386
oh my God!

318
00:16:07,952 --> 00:16:08,952
Are you okay?

319
00:16:40,618 --> 00:16:41,801
what's that?

320
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:44,093
What?

321
00:16:44,233 --> 00:16:45,452
That.

322
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,341
Oh, that's a television.

323
00:16:48,494 --> 00:16:50,284
Since when do you have a television?

324
00:16:50,904 --> 00:16:51,904
I Don't know.

325
00:16:52,032 --> 00:16:53,352
I think it's been about ten days.

326
00:16:54,335 --> 00:16:56,396
It's been so amazing
I sort of lost track.

327
00:16:57,363 --> 00:16:58,569
I seem to remember a woman

328
00:16:58,743 --> 00:17:00,704
wasting a good piece
of a beautiful afternoon

329
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:03,055
reciting this diatrave
against television

330
00:17:03,797 --> 00:17:06,398
that should've ended with her banging
her shoe on the table.

331
00:17:08,604 --> 00:17:10,590
Don darling if
you wanna ask the question,

332
00:17:11,392 --> 00:17:12,437
just ask it.

333
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:13,905
Where'd you get the tv?

334
00:17:14,282 --> 00:17:15,717
I got it.

335
00:17:16,312 --> 00:17:17,900
Same place you got that wig?

336
00:17:18,182 --> 00:17:19,408
Someone gave it to me.

337
00:17:21,725 --> 00:17:23,033
And you took it?

338
00:17:23,555 --> 00:17:25,946
Have you seen this thing
called "people are funny?"

339
00:17:30,962 --> 00:17:32,155
oh jesus, Don.

340
00:17:40,327 --> 00:17:41,842
All better?

341
00:17:43,972 --> 00:17:45,098
Yes.

342
00:17:57,497 --> 00:17:59,012
Sit at your places.

343
00:18:15,109 --> 00:18:16,154
Daddy!

344
00:18:16,404 --> 00:18:17,570
We went to the hospital.

345
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:19,325
We got lollipops.

346
00:18:24,159 --> 00:18:25,513
They're fine, Don.

347
00:18:28,202 --> 00:18:29,576
What about you?

348
00:18:30,296 --> 00:18:31,327
A little sore,

349
00:18:32,399 --> 00:18:33,704
a little embarrassed.

350
00:18:34,451 --> 00:18:36,140
Sorry they couldn't get ahold of me,

351
00:18:36,265 --> 00:18:38,752
we had to carry Freddy Rumsen
out of ratazys.

352
00:18:39,337 --> 00:18:41,263
Oh there was nothing you could've done.

353
00:18:46,882 --> 00:18:48,452
Daddy, use a fork.

354
00:18:50,252 --> 00:18:51,637
How's the car?

355
00:18:52,542 --> 00:18:53,887
Not bad.

356
00:18:54,138 --> 00:18:55,698
Uh, thank God I was only going 25-tops.

357
00:18:56,973 --> 00:18:58,790
I hate the way you drive, you know?

358
00:18:59,645 --> 00:19:02,245
I'm finished. Can I go watch
Shirley Temple story book?

359
00:19:02,507 --> 00:19:03,828
Yes, both of you.

360
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,640
So what happened?

361
00:19:15,211 --> 00:19:16,514
I Don't know really.

362
00:19:17,387 --> 00:19:20,291
It all happened so fast.

363
00:19:21,934 --> 00:19:24,713
At 20 an hour, it's not that fast.

364
00:19:27,106 --> 00:19:28,130
It's stupid.

365
00:19:28,992 --> 00:19:30,729
Was it Sally playing
with the radio again?

366
00:19:30,851 --> 00:19:32,211
I've warned her. no, she was fine.

367
00:19:32,663 --> 00:19:33,863
She was just sitting there-no.

368
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:38,290
It was my hands.

369
00:19:38,539 --> 00:19:39,539
It happened again.

370
00:19:43,355 --> 00:19:44,665
Jesus.

371
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:47,931
Betty you have to get
this taken care of.

372
00:19:49,177 --> 00:19:51,376
That doctor patterson is not through.

373
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:53,436
I swear when we walk down park avenue,

374
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,580
I could hear the quacking.

375
00:19:54,663 --> 00:19:55,663
I know you said that.

376
00:19:56,055 --> 00:19:57,351
This doctor was nice.

377
00:19:58,318 --> 00:19:59,728
He was older actually.

378
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,040
He was from rochester.

379
00:20:02,251 --> 00:20:04,096
Has two children that
are ten years apart.

380
00:20:04,238 --> 00:20:05,758
Okay, you've given me his credentials.

381
00:20:06,194 --> 00:20:07,208
What did he say?

382
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:09,105
Well he said I could go to New-York

383
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:11,358
and run the di tests.

384
00:20:11,626 --> 00:20:13,260
And I said that I already had

385
00:20:13,489 --> 00:20:14,849
and that the results were negative

386
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:16,606
and he even called doctor patterson.

387
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:21,306
So?

388
00:20:22,172 --> 00:20:24,669
They said there was nothing
physically wrong with me.

389
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:29,078
Then I told him what happened

390
00:20:29,322 --> 00:20:31,278
and he said that
I should see a psychiatrist.

391
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:40,842
Doctors must love that
they now have an answer

392
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,430
for I Don't know what's wrong.

393
00:20:42,739 --> 00:20:44,516
He said it could be a nervous condition.

394
00:20:44,726 --> 00:20:45,926
Nervous about what... Driving?

395
00:20:46,352 --> 00:20:48,399
So we'll go down to
he grand union parking lot.

396
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,958
We'll practice your 10:00 and 2:00.

397
00:20:50,043 --> 00:20:51,808
He seemed very concerned
if you wanna know.

398
00:20:51,921 --> 00:20:53,048
But that's their solution.

399
00:20:53,255 --> 00:20:55,368
Why not open the hood and poke around.

400
00:20:57,841 --> 00:20:58,855
So?

401
00:20:58,986 --> 00:21:01,003
So... I left.

402
00:21:02,479 --> 00:21:03,990
What else am I supposed to do?

403
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:06,280
Well go to a doctor,
another doctor-a good one!

404
00:21:06,543 --> 00:21:08,628
I'll get a specialist from Burt Cooper.

405
00:21:08,863 --> 00:21:10,738
His name's on a wall over
at Saint Vincents.

406
00:21:11,264 --> 00:21:12,287
Okay.

407
00:21:13,017 --> 00:21:14,965
And leave the dishes for the girl.

408
00:21:18,931 --> 00:21:19,931
Seven...

409
00:21:20,702 --> 00:21:21,749
Eight...

410
00:21:22,439 --> 00:21:23,683
Nine...

411
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:25,369
Ten...

412
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:27,005
Eleven...

413
00:21:27,378 --> 00:21:28,494
Twelve...

414
00:21:29,726 --> 00:21:31,058
Ninety-eight...

415
00:21:31,744 --> 00:21:32,744
Ninety-nine...

416
00:21:33,728 --> 00:21:34,994
One hundred.

417
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,350
You know I do worry about you, burty.

418
00:21:52,493 --> 00:21:53,810
I know.

419
00:21:58,906 --> 00:22:00,914
When you brought it up I was shocked.

420
00:22:02,943 --> 00:22:04,267
Although I realized that

421
00:22:04,784 --> 00:22:06,821
that's what Doctor Patterson

422
00:22:07,013 --> 00:22:09,407
was trying to say in his own way and...

423
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:16,156
It doesn't have as much
of a sigma today.

424
00:22:19,972 --> 00:22:22,371
I just Don't know what
they can possibly tell you.

425
00:22:26,871 --> 00:22:28,191
Doyouthink I need a psychiatrist?

426
00:22:36,841 --> 00:22:39,113
I always thought
people saw psychiatrists

427
00:22:39,401 --> 00:22:40,746
when they were unhappy...

428
00:22:43,132 --> 00:22:44,496
But I look at you...

429
00:22:46,711 --> 00:22:47,934
And this...

430
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:51,186
And them...

431
00:22:56,684 --> 00:22:57,684
And that...

432
00:23:01,309 --> 00:23:02,469
And I think, are you unhappy?

433
00:23:06,848 --> 00:23:08,184
Of course I'm happy.

434
00:23:09,693 --> 00:23:11,861
Well that'll be 35 dollars...
You're welcome.

435
00:23:14,933 --> 00:23:16,295
Whatever you think is best.

436
00:23:17,201 --> 00:23:18,309
Good.

437
00:23:47,485 --> 00:23:49,082
Act of God... Sorry.

438
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:51,815
Someone threw themselves
in front of the train.

439
00:23:52,498 --> 00:23:53,665
Ah, suicide.

440
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,559
Okay, boys...

441
00:23:58,744 --> 00:23:59,998
What do we have?

442
00:24:01,182 --> 00:24:05,004
Gentlemen, the aerosol can is
nothing less than space age.

443
00:24:05,872 --> 00:24:07,032
It's steel, it has exhaust...

444
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:08,799
It's even shaped like a rocket.

445
00:24:09,122 --> 00:24:10,402
Certainly an engineering marvel.

446
00:24:12,191 --> 00:24:13,196
Right guard.

447
00:24:13,515 --> 00:24:15,524
"It works in my suit... Or yours."

448
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:18,730
we'll punch the yellow of
the moon so it pops behind him.

449
00:24:24,661 --> 00:24:26,116
We're looking for new worlds,

450
00:24:26,313 --> 00:24:28,661
and with that search comes
any number of gadgets.

451
00:24:28,914 --> 00:24:30,583
It's not just some random association.

452
00:24:30,821 --> 00:24:31,998
This thing is shiny.

453
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:33,199
It's explosive.

454
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:35,783
It's from the future...
A place so close to us now,

455
00:24:36,138 --> 00:24:37,659
filled with wonder and ease.

456
00:24:39,893 --> 00:24:41,414
Except some people think of the future

457
00:24:41,498 --> 00:24:42,498
and it upsets them.

458
00:24:43,889 --> 00:24:46,227
They see a rocket, they start
building a bomb shelter.

459
00:24:46,452 --> 00:24:48,120
What? How do you get there?

460
00:24:48,291 --> 00:24:49,878
I Don't think it's ridiculous to assume

461
00:24:50,063 --> 00:24:51,622
we're looking for other planets

462
00:24:51,859 --> 00:24:53,296
because this one will end.

463
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,093
I thought we had something here.

464
00:24:56,324 --> 00:24:58,117
Who is this moron flying around space?

465
00:24:58,293 --> 00:25:00,199
I mean, he pees in his pants.

466
00:25:03,351 --> 00:25:04,973
Brass tacks... who buys this?

467
00:25:06,543 --> 00:25:07,813
Some woman.

468
00:25:08,399 --> 00:25:11,366
Your girl or your mother
will pick this up

469
00:25:11,897 --> 00:25:14,249
walking through
the grocery store or the druggist.

470
00:25:14,929 --> 00:25:17,320
We should be asking ourselves
"what do women want?"

471
00:25:17,844 --> 00:25:20,013
I Don't know, but I wish I had it.

472
00:25:22,294 --> 00:25:23,294
Maybe a chesty alien girl

473
00:25:23,867 --> 00:25:25,147
also wants to get into his suit.

474
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,740
I'm not asking what do women want

475
00:25:26,855 --> 00:25:29,019
in some bull crap
research psychology way.

476
00:25:29,169 --> 00:25:31,368
I'm asking, what would
make a woman look

477
00:25:31,518 --> 00:25:34,112
at this man's deodorant
and say, "I want that"?

478
00:25:34,292 --> 00:25:36,593
Well, I've stopped trying
to figure out what they think.

479
00:25:36,734 --> 00:25:38,286
Maybe I should stop paying you.

480
00:25:42,788 --> 00:25:45,312
Well, I always thought women
liked the way we smell.

481
00:25:45,549 --> 00:25:46,573
That explains a lot.

482
00:25:47,095 --> 00:25:48,485
I feel like we're close here.

483
00:25:48,644 --> 00:25:49,983
I mean, this one?

484
00:25:50,184 --> 00:25:52,418
The can's right-side up but
the guy's upside down.

485
00:25:53,393 --> 00:25:54,407
No.

486
00:25:54,578 --> 00:25:55,893
Let's bring it down to earth.

487
00:25:59,732 --> 00:26:00,892
You think they want a cowboy.

488
00:26:02,918 --> 00:26:03,918
He's quiet and strong.

489
00:26:05,987 --> 00:26:09,273
He always bring the cattle home safe.

490
00:26:14,234 --> 00:26:15,234
You watch tv.

491
00:26:17,669 --> 00:26:18,989
What if they want something else?

492
00:26:21,234 --> 00:26:22,234
Inside, some...

493
00:26:24,735 --> 00:26:26,175
Mysterious wish that we're ignoring.

494
00:26:48,421 --> 00:26:49,421
How'd it go?

495
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,110
I've still got my novel.

496
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:53,919
I'm sorry.

497
00:26:55,594 --> 00:26:56,920
Buy me lunch?

498
00:26:59,923 --> 00:27:03,416
Samuel, that drape, man,
it's sadder than a map.

499
00:27:04,017 --> 00:27:06,523
Well, it's lightweight and
it tells me I'm at work,

500
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:09,030
but you sure can talk, mr. Kensey.

501
00:27:09,798 --> 00:27:10,798
Sixty cents.

502
00:27:10,925 --> 00:27:11,925
What are you doing?

503
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,645
Keep the change.

504
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,382
You figure the place out yet?

505
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,514
What do you mean?

506
00:27:18,631 --> 00:27:19,921
How it runs.

507
00:27:20,112 --> 00:27:22,522
I know the copywriters tell
the art department what to do.

508
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:25,517
And I know the account executives
tell the copywriters what to do.

509
00:27:25,649 --> 00:27:26,923
What?

510
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,574
No one tells the writers what to do

511
00:27:28,668 --> 00:27:30,527
except for the head of creative...
Your boss.

512
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:31,858
It's all on Draper.

513
00:27:32,485 --> 00:27:34,419
Don't think that
just 'cause he's good looking

514
00:27:34,545 --> 00:27:35,545
he's not a writer.

515
00:27:36,031 --> 00:27:37,054
Dig.

516
00:27:37,317 --> 00:27:38,770
This is the media department.

517
00:27:38,924 --> 00:27:41,212
They're where 90% of where
the client's check goes.

518
00:27:41,298 --> 00:27:43,860
They buy space...
Newspapers, billboards, television,

519
00:27:44,114 --> 00:27:46,086
and my favorite aging whore, radio.

520
00:27:47,048 --> 00:27:50,051
That's the whole shakedown, actually.

521
00:27:50,492 --> 00:27:51,918
All you really need to know.

522
00:27:52,107 --> 00:27:54,708
They Don't sell ideas
or campaigns or jingles,

523
00:27:54,924 --> 00:27:57,065
they sell media... at a 15% markup.

524
00:27:57,237 --> 00:27:59,622
Creative is just window dressing.
It's thrown in for free.

525
00:27:59,785 --> 00:28:00,789
Really?

526
00:28:00,939 --> 00:28:03,230
Accounting... They keep track of
how much we're spending

527
00:28:03,315 --> 00:28:04,676
versus how much we're taking in.

528
00:28:04,761 --> 00:28:06,141
And since we're buying futures,

529
00:28:06,357 --> 00:28:08,132
if you ever, ever see, um,

530
00:28:08,883 --> 00:28:10,592
the man upstairs go in there,

531
00:28:11,108 --> 00:28:13,285
grab the lifeboats, baby...
We're going down.

532
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,800
Account management.

533
00:28:18,555 --> 00:28:20,987
Where prep schoolers skip arm-in-arm,

534
00:28:21,128 --> 00:28:23,203
"wizard of oz" style, joined together

535
00:28:23,419 --> 00:28:26,670
by their lack of skill and
their love of mirrors.

536
00:28:27,863 --> 00:28:29,825
Account executives are
all good at something,

537
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:32,905
although it's never advertising.

538
00:28:34,341 --> 00:28:35,909
Submitted for your approval,

539
00:28:36,604 --> 00:28:37,923
one peter campbell.

540
00:28:38,735 --> 00:28:40,235
A man who recently discovered

541
00:28:40,414 --> 00:28:42,047
that the only place for his hand

542
00:28:42,648 --> 00:28:44,047
is in your pocket.

543
00:28:45,309 --> 00:28:46,436
You watch it?

544
00:28:46,999 --> 00:28:48,897
Have you seen it... "the twilight zone"?

545
00:28:49,703 --> 00:28:51,689
I Don't think so.
I Don't like science fiction.

546
00:28:52,102 --> 00:28:54,014
I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that.

547
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:56,309
Mitch in media says CBS
might pull the plug.

548
00:28:56,584 --> 00:28:57,798
I'll kill myself.

549
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:06,176
And here we have
the creative department.

550
00:29:06,518 --> 00:29:08,312
The talent. Home sweet home.

551
00:29:08,852 --> 00:29:10,572
Like the art department downstairs,

552
00:29:10,863 --> 00:29:12,927
they put us far enough
away from the elevator

553
00:29:13,298 --> 00:29:14,408
so we can't sneak out.

554
00:29:20,372 --> 00:29:23,818
You know, there are women copywriters.

555
00:29:25,232 --> 00:29:26,622
- Good ones?
- Sure.

556
00:29:26,998 --> 00:29:28,386
I mean, you...

557
00:29:28,568 --> 00:29:30,558
you can always tell
when a woman's writing copy,

558
00:29:30,717 --> 00:29:34,370
but sometimes she just might be
the right man, for the job, you know?

559
00:29:35,886 --> 00:29:37,406
You must be very creatively satisfied.

560
00:29:38,197 --> 00:29:39,197
Let's not lose our heads.

561
00:29:40,929 --> 00:29:43,361
Sterling coop is positively cro-magnon.

562
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:46,073
I have a friend... I'm not even
gonna say what agency...

563
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,262
But all they do is smoke
mary jane and play darts,

564
00:29:48,356 --> 00:29:51,097
and honestly, I think they're
the best store on the street.

565
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,323
You like ukrainian food?

566
00:29:56,156 --> 00:29:57,510
Oxtail dumplings?

567
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:00,530
We still have a lot of work to do.

568
00:30:01,137 --> 00:30:02,257
I think he's still in there.

569
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:03,509
Ah, got it.

570
00:30:04,945 --> 00:30:06,044
Thanks for lunch.

571
00:30:06,391 --> 00:30:07,697
Sorry about your copy.

572
00:30:08,697 --> 00:30:09,697
Thanks for reminding me.

573
00:30:28,956 --> 00:30:30,441
I can never get used to the fact that

574
00:30:30,649 --> 00:30:32,816
most of the time it looks like
you're doing nothing.

575
00:30:34,088 --> 00:30:35,088
Fix you something?

576
00:30:35,777 --> 00:30:36,777
4:30?

577
00:30:37,589 --> 00:30:38,589
Close enough.

578
00:30:39,711 --> 00:30:40,791
Coop is gonna want a carbon

579
00:30:40,971 --> 00:30:42,747
with your hand-picked
team for Nixon on it,

580
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,785
and I warn you right now,
it includes pete campbell.

581
00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:48,725
I should go to Niagara falls
for two weeks.

582
00:30:48,878 --> 00:30:50,275
It does wonders for your career.

583
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,524
Niagara falls.

584
00:30:52,149 --> 00:30:54,469
Boy, redefines lack of imagination.

585
00:30:58,086 --> 00:30:59,286
Ahh, that's where you've been.

586
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:02,276
Let me ask you something.

587
00:31:04,403 --> 00:31:05,403
What do women want?

588
00:31:06,464 --> 00:31:07,464
Who cares?

589
00:31:09,586 --> 00:31:10,746
You mentioned the other night

590
00:31:11,715 --> 00:31:14,338
that your daughter had been
to a psychiatrist.

591
00:31:16,473 --> 00:31:18,291
I'm sure you must be
mistaken about that.

592
00:31:22,449 --> 00:31:23,449
You know what?

593
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,100
I am very comfortable with my mind.

594
00:31:26,138 --> 00:31:28,250
Thoughts clean and
unclean, loving and...

595
00:31:28,888 --> 00:31:29,888
The opposite of that.

596
00:31:31,204 --> 00:31:32,573
But I am not a woman.

597
00:31:33,637 --> 00:31:35,321
And I think it behooves any man to toss

598
00:31:35,544 --> 00:31:37,904
all female troubles into
the hands of a stranger.

599
00:31:39,198 --> 00:31:40,866
We had one head shrinker in the army.

600
00:31:41,512 --> 00:31:42,512
A gossip.

601
00:31:42,823 --> 00:31:44,303
Busting with other people's thoughts.

602
00:31:44,886 --> 00:31:46,366
Hasn't changed much, just costs more.

603
00:31:46,762 --> 00:31:47,762
You can't shoot at them.

604
00:31:48,389 --> 00:31:49,469
We live in troubling times.

605
00:31:49,888 --> 00:31:50,888
We do?

606
00:31:52,701 --> 00:31:54,301
Who could not be happy with all of this.

607
00:31:55,638 --> 00:31:56,878
Jesus, you know what they want?

608
00:31:57,198 --> 00:31:58,198
Everything.

609
00:31:58,511 --> 00:32:00,031
Especially if the other girls have it.

610
00:32:01,335 --> 00:32:05,290
Trust me, psychiatry is just
this year's candy pink stove.

611
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,640
It's just more happiness.

612
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:22,950
People...

613
00:32:24,327 --> 00:32:25,327
Are...

614
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:28,078
Funny!

615
00:32:30,139 --> 00:32:31,139
Beauty and the beast.

616
00:32:31,515 --> 00:32:32,515
Hey, daddy.

617
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:34,731
Hey there, cold lamb sound good?

618
00:32:36,826 --> 00:32:37,826
Yeah.

619
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,720
Someone started on a train.

620
00:32:46,014 --> 00:32:47,014
In the office.

621
00:32:48,204 --> 00:32:49,604
Because of a good day or a bad day?

622
00:32:51,637 --> 00:32:54,996
You know, when I told you
you had everything...

623
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:58,016
I was wrong.

624
00:33:02,953 --> 00:33:03,953
Oh my God!

625
00:33:06,388 --> 00:33:07,561
White gold,

626
00:33:08,628 --> 00:33:12,409
it's got one of those tiny little faces
that you have to be young to see.

627
00:33:12,718 --> 00:33:14,678
Oh, Don its beautiful.

628
00:33:17,425 --> 00:33:18,775
The guy at the store set the time

629
00:33:18,939 --> 00:33:21,710
but he was english so
it might be six hours off.

630
00:33:22,684 --> 00:33:24,222
Did you look at Sally's face?

631
00:33:25,517 --> 00:33:26,517
I think she has a bruise.

632
00:33:26,757 --> 00:33:27,826
I didn't see it.

633
00:33:28,156 --> 00:33:29,606
On her cheek bone under her eye.

634
00:33:30,891 --> 00:33:31,971
I thought that was ketchup.

635
00:33:33,327 --> 00:33:36,019
What if she had gotten a scar...
Something permanent?

636
00:33:36,643 --> 00:33:37,803
I Don't wanna play "what if."

637
00:33:37,963 --> 00:33:38,973
I'm just saying,

638
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:41,098
if it had happened to Bobby
it would've been okay

639
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,736
because a boy with a scar is nothing

640
00:33:42,829 --> 00:33:44,426
but a girl... so much worse.

641
00:33:44,649 --> 00:33:45,702
Nothing happened!

642
00:33:46,264 --> 00:33:47,264
I keep

643
00:33:47,962 --> 00:33:48,983
thinking...

644
00:33:51,454 --> 00:33:54,249
Not that I could've
killed the kids but...

645
00:33:56,766 --> 00:33:57,766
Worse.

646
00:33:59,642 --> 00:34:01,597
Sally could've survived

647
00:34:03,571 --> 00:34:05,074
and gone on living with this

648
00:34:05,802 --> 00:34:08,327
horrible scar on her face and...

649
00:34:10,578 --> 00:34:14,311
Some long, lonely,

650
00:34:16,178 --> 00:34:17,681
miserable life.

651
00:34:21,265 --> 00:34:22,265
Don...

652
00:34:33,264 --> 00:34:35,020
What's happening to me?

653
00:34:38,829 --> 00:34:41,079
Do I need to see someone?

654
00:34:48,578 --> 00:34:49,578
I Don't know.

655
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:52,956
I guess so.

656
00:34:55,266 --> 00:34:56,266
Whatever you want.

657
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:09,450
11:00 am, did you get fired?

658
00:35:12,831 --> 00:35:15,379
Brought Betty into the city
to see the doctor but, uh,

659
00:35:16,444 --> 00:35:20,307
honestly I think I'm the one
not feeling so great.

660
00:35:22,519 --> 00:35:23,519
I called in sick.

661
00:35:24,545 --> 00:35:25,642
Don't bring that here.

662
00:35:27,301 --> 00:35:29,858
I'm serious, Don.
Don't talk to me about her.

663
00:35:31,893 --> 00:35:33,544
That makes me feel cruel.

664
00:35:41,487 --> 00:35:42,645
You're right.

665
00:35:44,307 --> 00:35:45,394
Sometimes.

666
00:35:48,333 --> 00:35:49,933
I can't decide if you have everything...

667
00:35:53,645 --> 00:35:54,645
Or nothing.

668
00:35:55,767 --> 00:35:56,767
I live in the moment.

669
00:36:03,267 --> 00:36:04,267
Nothing is everything.

670
00:36:06,877 --> 00:36:09,143
It sounds more like you
live in the village.

671
00:36:09,861 --> 00:36:11,541
Actually I live in the hall.

672
00:36:12,298 --> 00:36:13,444
I lost my key.

673
00:36:13,872 --> 00:36:14,942
I had to, um...

674
00:36:16,003 --> 00:36:17,003
Spend the night abroad.

675
00:36:17,455 --> 00:36:18,841
Could you be a gentlemen

676
00:36:19,022 --> 00:36:20,396
and break into the fire escape

677
00:36:20,681 --> 00:36:21,815
so I Don't have to.

678
00:36:32,146 --> 00:36:33,256
Is Draper in yet?

679
00:36:33,378 --> 00:36:35,371
He's not coming in today.
He's not feeling well.

680
00:36:35,605 --> 00:36:38,113
I'm leaving.
Don't tell anyone I was here.

681
00:36:50,129 --> 00:36:51,129
No it's, peggy!

682
00:36:53,503 --> 00:36:54,503
Hello?

683
00:36:56,816 --> 00:36:58,577
I Don't think I can go out
to lunch today.

684
00:36:58,753 --> 00:37:00,091
Mr. Draper's not coming in.

685
00:37:00,321 --> 00:37:01,977
That means you can go out to lunch.

686
00:37:02,627 --> 00:37:04,377
Have you never worked
in an office before?

687
00:37:04,925 --> 00:37:06,170
He could call.

688
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:08,450
It's my second week-another time?

689
00:37:09,735 --> 00:37:11,280
I did enjoy the tour the other day.

690
00:37:11,598 --> 00:37:12,756
It was eye opening.

691
00:37:12,944 --> 00:37:15,222
I didn't think your eyes
could be any wider.

692
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:17,943
That's clever.

693
00:37:22,004 --> 00:37:24,708
I guess I'll go to the cart.
You want something?

694
00:37:27,634 --> 00:37:28,659
What?

695
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,461
The office is gonna empty
out any second,

696
00:37:31,614 --> 00:37:33,469
we could push the couch
in front of the door.

697
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:34,568
Paul!

698
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:37,579
Do you belong to someone else?

699
00:37:39,444 --> 00:37:40,444
Shit!

700
00:37:42,319 --> 00:37:43,879
I Don't even like to sit in dons chair.

701
00:37:44,443 --> 00:37:46,003
I think we've misunderstood each other.

702
00:37:49,569 --> 00:37:50,729
There is someone else, right?

703
00:37:52,945 --> 00:37:53,945
Yes.

704
00:38:15,457 --> 00:38:17,385
I hope you know that
covering your typewriter's

705
00:38:17,562 --> 00:38:19,464
office code for I'm done for the day.

706
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:21,005
I'm not feeling so swell.

707
00:38:21,291 --> 00:38:23,911
Neither am I. Look at these letters
you typed after lunch.

708
00:38:24,907 --> 00:38:26,446
Taraho indiana has two "r's"

709
00:38:27,232 --> 00:38:29,733
and an "a" and an "e" at the end?

710
00:38:30,179 --> 00:38:31,764
I gather you missed homerow by a hand

711
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:34,426
or you were out drinking with
the junior account boys again.

712
00:38:34,551 --> 00:38:35,565
I wasn't drinking.

713
00:38:35,676 --> 00:38:36,676
I Don't like your tone.

714
00:38:38,937 --> 00:38:40,017
I'll redo these right away.

715
00:38:40,928 --> 00:38:41,968
Look at you all in a snip.

716
00:38:45,238 --> 00:38:46,238
Are you gonna watch me?

717
00:38:46,553 --> 00:38:47,553
What is wrong with you?

718
00:38:48,738 --> 00:38:49,738
Honestly?

719
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:51,820
Why is it that every time

720
00:38:52,453 --> 00:38:54,897
a man takes you out to lunch
around here you're...

721
00:38:55,182 --> 00:38:56,259
You're the desert!

722
00:38:56,412 --> 00:38:57,433
That's terrible.

723
00:38:57,586 --> 00:38:59,077
It's constant from every corner.

724
00:38:59,576 --> 00:39:00,576
I'm from bay ridge.

725
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,140
We have manners.

726
00:39:02,484 --> 00:39:03,916
Why can't they just leave it alone?

727
00:39:04,034 --> 00:39:06,065
Because men always
bother you all the time-

728
00:39:06,202 --> 00:39:07,734
they follow you down the street.

729
00:39:09,156 --> 00:39:10,454
Well, not exactly.

730
00:39:10,953 --> 00:39:12,433
Look dear, I Don't know you that well

731
00:39:13,269 --> 00:39:15,127
but you're the new girl
and you're not much

732
00:39:15,328 --> 00:39:17,602
so you might as well
enjoy it while it lasts.

733
00:39:18,142 --> 00:39:19,142
Of course.

734
00:39:19,636 --> 00:39:20,705
Don't be that way,

735
00:39:20,891 --> 00:39:23,067
I'm just offering some
perspective that's all.

736
00:39:25,448 --> 00:39:26,469
Thank you, joan.

737
00:39:26,785 --> 00:39:27,954
I'll save my thank you's

738
00:39:28,097 --> 00:39:30,199
till you correct that correspondence.

739
00:40:51,752 --> 00:40:53,470
I Don't know why I'm here.

740
00:40:55,859 --> 00:40:58,258
I'm... I mean I do. I'm...

741
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,020
Nervous I guess-

742
00:41:03,899 --> 00:41:05,038
anxious.

743
00:41:07,566 --> 00:41:09,311
I Don't sleep that well.

744
00:41:11,504 --> 00:41:12,732
And my hands...

745
00:41:15,502 --> 00:41:16,824
Well they're fine now.

746
00:41:20,192 --> 00:41:22,518
It's like when you have
a problem with your car

747
00:41:22,817 --> 00:41:25,960
and you go to the mechanic
and it's not doing it anymore.

748
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:29,962
Not that you are a mechanic.

749
00:41:37,378 --> 00:41:40,613
I guess a lot of people must come here
worried about the bum.

750
00:41:41,005 --> 00:41:42,005
Is that true?

751
00:41:46,568 --> 00:41:47,968
It's a common nightmare people say.

752
00:41:48,815 --> 00:41:49,815
I read it in a magazine.

753
00:41:58,754 --> 00:41:59,759
My mother always told me

754
00:42:00,003 --> 00:42:02,852
that it wasn't polite
to talk about yourself.

755
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:08,316
She passed away recently.

756
00:42:13,504 --> 00:42:14,624
I guess I already said that.

757
00:42:20,942 --> 00:42:21,942
Can I smoke in here?

758
00:42:49,445 --> 00:42:50,645
We're all so lucky to be here.

759
00:42:54,256 --> 00:42:55,256
It's 7:30.

760
00:42:56,566 --> 00:42:57,726
I have to go to roys reading.

761
00:42:58,507 --> 00:43:02,108
I have to be there to acted surprised
when Jack Kerouac doesn't show.

762
00:43:05,442 --> 00:43:06,602
Lock the door when you leave.

763
00:43:14,256 --> 00:43:15,256
If you're gonna go home,

764
00:43:15,756 --> 00:43:16,756
take a shower you stink.

765
00:43:18,693 --> 00:43:19,693
It's cause I'm the man.

766
00:43:20,692 --> 00:43:22,052
You seem to forget that sometimes.

767
00:43:22,696 --> 00:43:24,096
I'm lucky they aren't all like you.

768
00:43:24,257 --> 00:43:25,377
I take that as a compliment.

769
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:31,130
What do women want?

770
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:33,973
Well one of the things has to be

771
00:43:34,631 --> 00:43:36,071
not being asked something like that.

772
00:43:37,382 --> 00:43:38,382
What do women want?

773
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:40,250
You know better then to ask.

774
00:43:45,944 --> 00:43:46,944
Give me a pen.

775
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:48,570
Jesus.

776
00:43:56,134 --> 00:43:57,134
What do women want?

777
00:44:00,381 --> 00:44:01,381
Any excuse to get closer.

778
00:44:03,944 --> 00:44:04,944
Thank God.

779
00:44:06,634 --> 00:44:08,034
There's that ego people pay to see.

780
00:44:18,624 --> 00:44:20,021
I'll have the filet of sole.

781
00:44:20,256 --> 00:44:21,259
Excellent.

782
00:44:22,009 --> 00:44:23,452
Cream spinach or cream corn?

783
00:44:23,673 --> 00:44:24,693
Spinach.

784
00:44:24,831 --> 00:44:26,287
Fried potatoes or au gratin?

785
00:44:26,445 --> 00:44:28,443
Au gratin... With tomato juice to start.

786
00:44:29,103 --> 00:44:30,183
I'll have the goulash.

787
00:44:30,324 --> 00:44:31,428
Very good, sir.

788
00:44:35,068 --> 00:44:36,068
Vodka gimlet.

789
00:44:37,444 --> 00:44:38,444
Old fashioned.

790
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:49,319
How was your day?

791
00:44:51,445 --> 00:44:52,445
Fine.

792
00:44:53,196 --> 00:44:54,356
You know I work with doctors,

793
00:44:54,821 --> 00:44:56,358
they'll say anything you pay them to.

794
00:44:56,511 --> 00:44:57,591
Of course dear

795
00:44:58,812 --> 00:45:00,162
but dinner in the city...

796
00:45:01,025 --> 00:45:02,159
I'm glad I'm hungry.

797
00:45:04,041 --> 00:45:06,153
I saw an interesting thing
in the journal american.

798
00:45:06,733 --> 00:45:08,882
Apparently the phone company
wants to start

799
00:45:09,414 --> 00:45:10,894
charging people for unlisted numbers.

800
00:45:11,989 --> 00:45:13,262
Well, that doesn't seem fair.

801
00:45:13,569 --> 00:45:14,626
Some people agree with you

802
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,258
and they're giving aliases to ma bell,

803
00:45:16,467 --> 00:45:18,369
they call it anom-de phone.

804
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:20,091
Isn't that smart?

805
00:45:20,715 --> 00:45:23,194
Of course most of them are pornographic.

806
00:45:24,903 --> 00:45:25,903
The best one...

807
00:45:26,653 --> 00:45:27,653
Pat magroin.

808
00:45:27,903 --> 00:45:28,903
Oh my God!

809
00:45:29,747 --> 00:45:32,072
I'd believe they would print
that in the journal american

810
00:45:32,248 --> 00:45:33,974
let alone in the phone book.

811
00:45:45,529 --> 00:45:46,529
This is nice.

812
00:46:03,842 --> 00:46:04,842
I'll be right up.

813
00:46:26,154 --> 00:46:27,154
Hello?

814
00:46:28,093 --> 00:46:29,213
Sorry to bother you so late,

815
00:46:29,470 --> 00:46:30,470
it's Don Draper.

816
00:46:30,717 --> 00:46:31,717
Oh hello, mr. Draper.

817
00:46:32,093 --> 00:46:33,333
No, no it's not to late at all.

818
00:46:34,407 --> 00:46:35,407
Glad to hear that.

819
00:46:36,904 --> 00:46:37,904
Well?

820
00:46:38,342 --> 00:46:39,742
Well, I had a very interesting hour

821
00:46:41,283 --> 00:46:42,483
with your wife this afternoon.

822
00:46:44,029 --> 00:46:45,349
She's a very anxious young woman.

823
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:48,260
I think you're doing the right thing.

824
00:47:35,594 --> 00:47:36,916
<I>On the next "Mad Men"...</I>

825
00:47:37,158 --> 00:47:40,688
Peggy, when I came over
that night, you know?

826
00:47:41,346 --> 00:47:42,346
I was there.

827
00:47:43,471 --> 00:47:45,599
Miss Mankel, no one at this table

828
00:47:45,844 --> 00:47:47,249
has ever been to your store.

829
00:47:47,658 --> 00:47:50,153
A wrong I will personally
correct this afternoon.

830
00:47:50,457 --> 00:47:52,441
Draper, who knows anything
about that guy?

831
00:47:52,665 --> 00:47:53,933
No one's ever lifted that rock.

832
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:57,036
Interesting crowd in there.

833
00:47:57,932 --> 00:47:59,030
Betty?

834
00:47:59,194 --> 00:48:00,204
What?
