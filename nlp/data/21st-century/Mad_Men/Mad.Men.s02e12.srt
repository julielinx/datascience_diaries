1
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,804
Sally, those go in your room!

2
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:44,740
And, Bobby,
put your trucks in the toy box.

3
00:00:44,844 --> 00:00:46,209
I'm not your maid.

4
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:28,149
What do you think you're doing?

5
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:30,647
Nothing.

6
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:31,883
Get over here.

7
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:34,118
You could burn the house down.

8
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:35,285
You're hurting me.

9
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:36,453
Good.

10
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:38,861
I can't believe you were smoking.

11
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:39,989
I wasn't.

12
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,795
Go upstairs.

13
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:43,459
You're not going to be
watching television.

14
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,299
You're not going to be
playing with your friends.

15
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:46,599
I'm taking away Barbie.

16
00:01:46,706 --> 00:01:48,071
- You're mean.
- You bet.

17
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:49,402
Get in there.

18
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,305
I'm telling Daddy when he gets home.

19
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:53,674
Go ahead.

20
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,011
He left because
you're stupid and mean.

21
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,051
You want to sleep in there?

22
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:02,349
Why won't you let him come home?

23
00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:10,225
Is that what you think?

24
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,992
His suitcase is here, and he's not.

25
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:20,932
Daddy's on a trip.

26
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,008
I told you.

27
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:24,906
It's for business.

28
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:27,878
Can we call him on the phone?

29
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:30,643
It's long distance.

30
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:34,584
And I know he'd be very upset
about you doing what you just did.

31
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:36,518
Please don't tell.

32
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:39,592
Take your school books upstairs.

33
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:41,455
As soon as Carla gets here,

34
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:43,756
I'm going riding,
and I want a good report.

35
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:08,116
Who wants a Popsicle
when it's snowing?

36
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:10,086
Don't they sell enough
during the summer?

37
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,021
Obviously not.

38
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:15,091
I love Popsicles.

39
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:19,090
I can't think in here!

40
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,292
It's a storage closet, not an office.

41
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:22,925
I called the meeting.

42
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,663
So where are the refreshments?

43
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:28,201
Why do moms give treats?

44
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:29,935
There's no good reason.

45
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,238
My mom would come out
to the truck with us.

46
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:34,313
She'd break the Popsicles in half,

47
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:38,373
then give it to us
like Jesus at the Last Supper.

48
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:40,008
Sounds cheap.

49
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:41,746
No. My mother did it, too.

50
00:03:41,854 --> 00:03:43,287
It was great.

51
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:44,981
In Vermont, we made our own ice cream.

52
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:47,525
It was a pain in the ass.

53
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,963
Everyone breaks Popsicles in half.

54
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,331
So?

55
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:59,598
You can do it all year 'round.

56
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:04,905
It's a ritual. It's like Communion.

57
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:07,343
It's kind of Catholic, isn't it?

58
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:08,937
It's Christian...

59
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:12,211
as in behavior, not religion.

60
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:14,081
Let me tell you something.

61
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:16,451
The Catholic Church
knows how to sell things.

62
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:20,758
Any calls?

63
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:24,557
Mr. Peterson had some question
about your expenses regarding...

64
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:26,325
Why doesn't he just die already?

65
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:27,899
Lutèce.

66
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:30,993
Christ. It's IBM.

67
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,332
Myopic.

68
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:33,405
What else?

69
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:37,738
And you have an appointment
with Spence-Chapin on Thursday.

70
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:39,004
Who's that?

71
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,603
Spence-Chapin, the adoption agency.

72
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:43,511
I'm sorry. What?

73
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:44,742
Mrs. Campbell set it,

74
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:47,479
and, well, I'm sorry,
I have to say something.

75
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:49,077
Good luck.

76
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:54,423
Yes, of course.

77
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:55,585
Thank you.

78
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:57,856
I think it's one of the most blessed things

79
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,489
that a person would give
a home to an abandoned child.

80
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:04,263
Shall I get Mrs. Campbell on the line?

81
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:07,899
Just get me Bert Peterson.

82
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:14,413
Well, hello there.

83
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:15,913
Hello, Bertram.

84
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:18,577
Is Florence with you?

85
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:20,983
No. She's taking care of her mother.

86
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:22,349
Then we were thinking

87
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:24,787
about going to the Breakers
through New Year's.

88
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:27,382
She's a good companion, isn't she?

89
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:30,291
She's moody.

90
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:33,832
Damn it, Alice. I don't ask much of you...

91
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:36,424
My stockings cost more
than your carpeting.

92
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:40,530
Have you looked everything over?

93
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,471
It's a very generous offer.

94
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:46,106
I always say it's
the smartest thing I ever did,

95
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:48,305
helping you out.

96
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:51,577
22.50 per share per year
for the next 10 years?

97
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:54,244
To think that Mother
thought you were a failure.

98
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,686
She made me who I am.

99
00:05:58,858 --> 00:05:59,916
Do you mind if I have a drink?

100
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,586
Sweet vermouth, please.

101
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:07,256
You can trust Cleveland.

102
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:10,530
You said on the telephone
you were undecided.

103
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:12,365
What's your hesitation?

104
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:15,669
I promised to take care of Roger.

105
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:19,233
Let Roger Sterling
have what he always wanted...

106
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:22,178
to die in the arms of a 20-year-old.

107
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:25,011
The truth is you don't want to retire.

108
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:27,348
And I hate to say this, Bertram,

109
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:29,284
but you are old...

110
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,050
older than me.

111
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:33,785
I can't even imagine
what that must be like.

112
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,986
Charming.

113
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:38,996
Please. You're not well.

114
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:41,498
This is what I do.

115
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:44,195
It's a merger.
You can continue to do it.

116
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:46,828
I'll be as useful
as the Queen of England.

117
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:49,533
Don't you want to go to Montana?

118
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:52,202
You ruined that poor architect's life.

119
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:54,438
Go visit your cattle.

120
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:57,249
I do love them.

121
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:02,476
But you can't trust the Brits.

122
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:24,403
I've left a letter on my bureau.

123
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:27,172
If I'm not back in two days,
the police will be here.

124
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,339
Why would you bring that up?

125
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,212
Because I don't want you to hurt me.

126
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:34,748
I just want to know
where my husband is.

127
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:36,685
It's a simple misunderstanding.

128
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,381
There's a lot of men with my name.

129
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:40,789
Well, you're the only one
who used my husband's serial number

130
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:42,690
to get a driver's license.

131
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,888
Car title. Apartment lease.

132
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:46,862
Do you have a birth certificate?

133
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,025
In a safe deposit box.

134
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,159
Will you stop?

135
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,029
I saw the look on your face.

136
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,572
I don't know what to say.

137
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:56,073
There's been a mistake.

138
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:58,700
Can't you be a human being?

139
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,836
I'm his wife.

140
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:02,812
I don't care what he asked you to do.

141
00:08:02,915 --> 00:08:03,904
I need to know.

142
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:05,916
I have to get back to work.

143
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:07,576
Stop lying.

144
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:09,655
You've been caught.

145
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:11,985
Don't make me do something
I don't want to do.

146
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:20,728
He died.

147
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,460
I'm sorry.

148
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:24,365
What?

149
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:27,868
I'm sorry.

150
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:30,272
Are you sure?

151
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:46,981
He never said he had a wife.

152
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,291
Seven years.

153
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:03,737
I'm very, very sorry.

154
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:05,572
What happened?

155
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:08,169
He was killed in combat.

156
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:10,839
So, who are you?

157
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:15,386
They thought I was him and he was me.

158
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:17,353
I didn't think I was hurting anyone.

159
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:20,348
I can't believe it.

160
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,052
I just had to get out of there.

161
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:29,161
What are you going to do to me?

162
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:32,368
He never mentioned me?

163
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,966
I didn't know him long.

164
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,337
Maybe...

165
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:38,705
What's your name?

166
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:41,075
Anna.

167
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:45,206
I don't know what to say.

168
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:47,684
I'm making good money, if that's...

169
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:50,517
I know I owe you more than money.

170
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:54,057
I have his purple heart

171
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,060
and his dog tags, if you want them.

172
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,727
He wanted to marry my sister.

173
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:03,495
She looks just like me,
with two good legs.

174
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:09,802
What is your name?

175
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:12,241
Dick Whitman.

176
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:18,181
Well, Dick, what do I do with you?

177
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:31,261
Well, this is a welcome surprise.

178
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:36,099
I can come back.

179
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:37,533
No. Come.

180
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,264
See this.

181
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,494
I guess all you needed was an audience.

182
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:06,895
Are you next?

183
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,796
I don't play.

184
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:10,630
Teddy, this is my friend Dick.

185
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:11,998
Hi.

186
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:14,868
It's called "In The Hall
of the Mountain King."

187
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:16,566
It's scary.

188
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,803
I know.

189
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:21,311
Take a lollipop. I'll see you next week.

190
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,118
Bye, Mrs. Draper.

191
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,824
You're tan.

192
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:35,917
Are you here on vacation?

193
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,757
No.

194
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,763
Business.

195
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:46,230
You look good.

196
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:48,363
Where are your things?

197
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:51,409
Or are you just here for the day?

198
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,307
I didn't even think about it.

199
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:58,441
I didn't mean to intrude. I can...

200
00:11:58,551 --> 00:11:59,540
Are you in trouble?

201
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:01,381
No.

202
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:03,546
Well, then, what?

203
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:08,788
Can I take a shower and lie down?

204
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,452
Of course.

205
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:18,895
Trudy!

206
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:20,335
You're late.

207
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:22,907
Spence-Chapin. How did that happen?

208
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:24,236
I put us on the list.

209
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:26,903
And, I don't know,
we went right to the top.

210
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:29,173
Well, I'm not going, and neither are you.

211
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:30,509
Peter, you're shouting.

212
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:32,140
Don't do that.

213
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:35,049
Listen to me very carefully.

214
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:39,591
We are not adopting a child.

215
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,023
That's final.

216
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:42,651
Will you calm down, and we can talk...

217
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,753
Hell's bells, Trudy! That is final!

218
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:47,264
You don't speak to me that way!

219
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:55,231
You have lost your mind!

220
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:15,884
I'm glad you're not tired anymore.

221
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:19,487
I am, but my autopilot's working.

222
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,406
What are you doing?

223
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:36,538
You're tired. Let me do the driving.

224
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,879
It's okay.

225
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:39,973
Joanie.

226
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:42,543
Stop.

227
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:43,917
Honey.

228
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:49,017
You know what? I am tired.

229
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:50,652
Okay.

230
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:05,701
Is something wrong?

231
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:08,939
Where'd you pick that up?

232
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:10,015
Greg, stop that.

233
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:13,414
You know there is no before.

234
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,884
Right.

235
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:22,855
I'm sorry that I don't know
all the things you want.

236
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:25,157
But you do.

237
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:29,400
I'm on call again on Wednesday.

238
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:34,656
These pants have a 38 inseam.

239
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,998
Harold.

240
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,128
I would like to meet him.

241
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:42,036
I kicked him out.

242
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:44,405
Even though old ladies shouldn't be picky.

243
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:50,840
It's beautiful here.

244
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,976
You like the porch?

245
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:56,418
You paid for it.

246
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:03,251
I think about you.

247
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,791
Just in passing, I'll wonder.

248
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,535
They were making
a commercial on the pier.

249
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:16,165
And then you called me.
How about that?

250
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:18,106
You've been in California too long.

251
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,748
How old are your children now?

252
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:28,010
Sally is 8.

253
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,519
Bobby is 5.

254
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:37,592
If you don't want to talk
about what happened,

255
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:40,824
that's fine.

256
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:43,197
But you can, you know.

257
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:47,136
I always felt that we met
so that both of our lives could be better.

258
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:52,069
That's just how it is between us.

259
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:55,010
I ruined everything.

260
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:02,343
My family, my wife,

261
00:17:02,454 --> 00:17:04,149
my kids.

262
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:06,622
I'm sure that's not true.

263
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:12,092
My brother came to find me.

264
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,324
I told him to go away.

265
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:16,663
I didn't know you had a brother.

266
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:23,367
I've told you things I've never told Betty.

267
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:29,777
Why does it have to be that way?

268
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,316
You love her.

269
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:38,848
You don't have to tell her everything.

270
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:41,482
I'm sure there are things
about her you don't know.

271
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:46,054
Do you want to call?

272
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:47,223
No.

273
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:52,035
That would just confuse things.

274
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,771
So, what are you going to do?

275
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:57,967
I don't know.

276
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:06,216
I have been watching my life.

277
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:07,808
It's right there.

278
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:14,991
I keep scratching at it,
trying to get into it.

279
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:21,059
I can't.

280
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:25,703
I'm sorry.

281
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:41,517
Did you get the same thing
in your stocking last night that I did?

282
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,417
What are you talking about?

283
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:46,082
Putnam, Powell & Lowe has offered

284
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:48,386
to put a lot of marmalade on your toast.

285
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:51,026
Sit, Roger.

286
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:55,430
There's no rush. We have 72 hours.

287
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:57,001
Yes. Well,

288
00:18:57,102 --> 00:19:00,868
I don't like being in the position
of having to sell off my life's work

289
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,737
because you have
an increase in overhead.

290
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:06,709
So Mona's crying
on your shoulder now?

291
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,372
The late Mrs. Cooper introduced you.

292
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,472
Well, let her know it didn't work out.

293
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,278
Bert,

294
00:19:13,385 --> 00:19:15,546
I know you don't think
I got my hands dirty.

295
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,952
I'm sorry I missed the Great Depression.

296
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:20,581
Still, I have served this
place for the last 20 years.

297
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:22,819
It's a merger.

298
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:24,054
We can still come to work in our building,

299
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,425
in our offices,

300
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:28,193
only there will be diamonds
on the doorknobs.

301
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,970
So we'll have a meeting of the partners.

302
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:45,881
And for your information,
Jane makes me very happy.

303
00:19:45,984 --> 00:19:48,316
That's good to know.

304
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:54,421
As Don illuminated,

305
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,824
advertising is essential for aerospace,

306
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:58,726
especially in reaching out to the public

307
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:01,390
to see that congressmen vote

308
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,435
for the spending bills
which bring new jobs.

309
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:07,266
Actual advertising, not public relations.

310
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:11,008
I have your father-in-law on line 1.

311
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,352
Tom. How are you?

312
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:29,826
Well, Peter, to be honest,

313
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:31,793
I don't like having
to make this phone call.

314
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:34,395
Why not?

315
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:36,558
Well, we've been thinking
about things over here,

316
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:39,398
and we're going to have to
put Clearasil up for review.

317
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:43,873
Really? That's a shock, Tom.

318
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:46,171
Now, why would you do that?

319
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:47,939
Sales have been spectacular.

320
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:49,274
All right, calm down.

321
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:53,044
I said review, not that we're moving.

322
00:20:53,151 --> 00:20:54,880
You'll have 90 days to turn it around.

323
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:56,477
Turn what around?

324
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,453
You're distracted.

325
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:00,684
What are we talking about, Tom?

326
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:03,283
Look, son...

327
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:05,022
Every good businessman knows

328
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:08,395
that if his wife's unhappy,
his work suffers.

329
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,936
Yes, they seem very directly related
in this case.

330
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:13,504
Don't they, Tom?

331
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:16,233
Trudy's happiness should
be your first priority.

332
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:20,109
I think you should pull
Clearasil right now.

333
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:22,146
I don't think you're going
to get what you want.

334
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:23,908
What about my daughter?

335
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:26,348
She's my wife. That's between us.

336
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,112
You know what?

337
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,188
I was in love with Trudy when I met her.

338
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,756
And then you stuck your nose in,

339
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:34,382
put these ideas in her mind,
and made her unhappy.

340
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:36,723
What do you mean,
you "were" in love with her?

341
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:39,296
That's not what I meant,
and you know it.

342
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:44,097
Yes. Perhaps it is best
if we just give notice.

343
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:45,533
Good-bye, Tom.

344
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:54,837
I bought you some clothes.

345
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,698
Tomorrow morning.

346
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,167
There's something else.

347
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:25,743
What?

348
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:28,335
I met a girl.

349
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:30,347
Another one?

350
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:35,751
She's so beautiful and happy.

351
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:36,946
She's a model.

352
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:40,149
And she's from a good family,

353
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:41,452
and she's educated.

354
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,050
What's her name?

355
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:45,391
Elizabeth. Betty.

356
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:46,930
I want you to meet her.

357
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:49,193
Look at you.

358
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:51,667
You're in the lavender haze.

359
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:57,203
I just like the way she laughs

360
00:22:57,309 --> 00:22:58,867
and the way she looks at me.

361
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:01,138
Yes.

362
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:03,009
You are very hard to look at.

363
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:08,647
I want to ask her to marry me.

364
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:11,018
Dick, that's wonderful.

365
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:18,490
Well, I need you to give me a divorce.

366
00:23:20,198 --> 00:23:21,563
Well, of course.

367
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:23,691
I never thought of that.

368
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:25,360
You should hire a lawyer out here.

369
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,370
I'll pay for it.

370
00:23:27,472 --> 00:23:30,600
And I want you to know that I'm
going to take care of you forever.

371
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:33,405
You don't have to do that.

372
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:35,844
I do.

373
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:37,881
You don't owe me anything.

374
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:43,619
This whole life.

375
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:44,814
If it wasn't for Don,

376
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:46,584
- if it wasn't...
- Stop that.

377
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:51,054
So...

378
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:56,262
there'll be another Mrs. Draper.

379
00:23:58,069 --> 00:24:00,435
I guess so.

380
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:04,373
You'll have a family.

381
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:06,444
That'll be good for you.

382
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:09,946
I want to.

383
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:13,575
This will probably be
our last Christmas together.

384
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:15,084
Why?

385
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:20,246
You can be my cousin.

386
00:24:20,358 --> 00:24:21,950
No.

387
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:27,156
This is a chance at a whole new life.

388
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:35,667
Thank you, Anna.

389
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:44,273
So, where's Don?

390
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:48,078
I'm sure you remember Peggy Olson.

391
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:50,950
She'll be walking you through this.

392
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:52,921
And when Don climbs out
from under the weather...

393
00:24:55,126 --> 00:24:57,321
Don has signed off on all of this.

394
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:01,096
When I was little,

395
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:03,326
my mother would take a twin pop

396
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:04,959
and break it in half

397
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:08,733
and give one to me
and one to my sister.

398
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,570
We were completely equal in her eyes.

399
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:13,007
Beloved.

400
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:15,079
Everyone does this with Popsicles,

401
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,478
but they may not
realize what it means.

402
00:25:17,582 --> 00:25:20,608
It has nothing to do
with an ice cream truck

403
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:22,311
on a hot summer day,

404
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,444
or the flavor,

405
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:25,352
or the color.

406
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:28,620
It's a ritual.

407
00:25:28,727 --> 00:25:32,128
You take it, break it,
share it, and love it.

408
00:25:36,434 --> 00:25:38,402
People do do that.

409
00:25:42,507 --> 00:25:46,102
This act of sharing,
it's what a Popsicle is.

410
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:49,703
It's the same treat from the freezer
as it is from the truck.

411
00:25:49,814 --> 00:25:51,577
I don't care if it's snowing or hailing

412
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:53,708
or 100 degrees.

413
00:25:53,818 --> 00:25:56,981
You can still take it, break it, share it,

414
00:25:57,088 --> 00:25:58,521
and love it.

415
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,053
I like the way
she's handing out the pops.

416
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:06,654
The kids are excited, but...

417
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:08,528
the mom reminds me of something.

418
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:11,761
No, this is original.

419
00:26:15,807 --> 00:26:17,069
Well, I can tell you this now,

420
00:26:17,175 --> 00:26:19,769
but we wanted something
with the word "love" in it.

421
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:22,346
When asked, the first thing
people say is,

422
00:26:22,447 --> 00:26:23,880
"I love Popsicles."

423
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:41,690
Carson residence.

424
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,667
Sarah Beth, it's Betty Draper.

425
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:47,863
Hello, Betty.

426
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:48,905
I'm sorry.

427
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:51,373
I'm at my wit's end.

428
00:26:51,476 --> 00:26:54,912
Sally... I think she may
need private school.

429
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:57,481
How does Becky like
Rockland Country Day?

430
00:26:57,582 --> 00:27:00,779
Well, it's a drive,
but she seems more independent.

431
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:05,950
I haven't seen you at the stables.

432
00:27:06,057 --> 00:27:09,117
I saw it in the paper that Tara and Arthur
are getting married next weekend.

433
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:13,897
Yes, I heard that.

434
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:16,934
I hope they're very happy together.

435
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:22,433
Are you there?

436
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:29,106
Betty, I'm sick about it.

437
00:27:30,682 --> 00:27:32,946
I'm sorry.

438
00:27:33,051 --> 00:27:35,110
That's why they call them crushes.

439
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,688
It was more than that.

440
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:40,383
Really?

441
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,960
I'm telling you,
I haven't been able to sleep.

442
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:45,086
I keep thinking about him.

443
00:27:47,132 --> 00:27:49,600
I think Raymond knows.

444
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:51,566
I can't even look at Becky.

445
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,695
What did you do?

446
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:57,104
Betty, I made a terrible mistake.

447
00:27:58,977 --> 00:28:00,535
You did?

448
00:28:00,645 --> 00:28:01,703
Don't act surprised.

449
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:03,474
He told me all the things
you said about me.

450
00:28:03,581 --> 00:28:04,809
I was grateful.

451
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:07,316
Why would you do that?

452
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:09,853
What?

453
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:12,013
You wanted him, too. You know you did.

454
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:14,887
There's a difference
between wanting and having.

455
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:17,393
You did everything you could
to encourage me.

456
00:28:17,495 --> 00:28:19,588
I didn't make you do anything.

457
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,222
My God, you're an awful woman,

458
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:22,492
you know that?

459
00:28:23,902 --> 00:28:25,961
No one made you sleep with him!

460
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,444
I'm going to tell you this,

461
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,643
and you can tell all your little friends.

462
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:42,845
This is a delicate piece of machinery.

463
00:28:42,954 --> 00:28:44,717
You don't just shove paper in it.

464
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:46,222
You don't bang on the buttons.

465
00:28:46,324 --> 00:28:48,155
You don't sit on the glass.

466
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:49,283
If you want it to work,

467
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:51,555
you have to treat it with respect.

468
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:03,533
What do you want?

469
00:29:03,641 --> 00:29:05,973
I need to speak with you.

470
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:08,045
Honey, I have a 6:30 dinner reservation,

471
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:09,170
and unless you want to pull
me there in a rickshaw,

472
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,304
I have to get going.

473
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:13,384
Well, I'm a copywriter.

474
00:29:13,485 --> 00:29:14,850
Why, did I call you something else?

475
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:17,581
No. I don't know if you're aware,

476
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:20,089
but I brought in
the Popsicle account today.

477
00:29:20,191 --> 00:29:21,158
On my own.

478
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:23,250
Hey, Ginger, did you hear about this?

479
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:25,556
I gotta go. Wait.

480
00:29:25,663 --> 00:29:27,597
I need my own office.

481
00:29:27,699 --> 00:29:31,692
It's hard to do business and be credible
when I'm sharing with a Xerox machine.

482
00:29:31,803 --> 00:29:36,103
Freddie Rumsen's office
has been vacant for some time.

483
00:29:36,207 --> 00:29:37,435
I think I should have it.

484
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:39,533
It's yours.

485
00:29:39,644 --> 00:29:41,407
Really?

486
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:43,242
You young women are very aggressive.

487
00:29:43,348 --> 00:29:45,248
I didn't mean to be impolite.

488
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,612
No, it's cute.

489
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:49,619
There are 30 men out there
who didn't have the balls to ask me.

490
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:51,780
There you are. Mr. Sterling, Miss Olson,

491
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:54,518
this is my fiancé, Dr. Greg Harris.

492
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,355
So you're the one who got our Joanie?

493
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:57,928
Yes, I am.

494
00:29:58,029 --> 00:29:59,929
You're a lucky man.

495
00:30:00,031 --> 00:30:03,489
So nice to meet you. Congratulations.

496
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:05,034
And thank you again, Mr. Sterling.

497
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:08,129
It's a pleasure to meet you.

498
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:11,606
I have a dinner reservation,
and I don't think I'm going to make it.

499
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:13,370
Well, we do as well.

500
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:14,706
We're going to La Côte Basque.

501
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,474
I thought you hated French food.

502
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:18,071
There's a new chef.

503
00:30:19,784 --> 00:30:21,718
Good night, Ginger.
Pleasure to meet you, Greg.

504
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:28,652
Let me get my purse.

505
00:30:30,695 --> 00:30:33,061
Fix me a drink, will you?

506
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:34,927
I don't know.

507
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:37,194
Isn't that what these guys do all day?

508
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:39,133
I've seen the movies.

509
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:40,329
Pretend like I'm your boss.

510
00:30:40,438 --> 00:30:43,601
Donald Draper.

511
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:45,005
Okay, one drink.

512
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:03,288
Dr. Harris, are you trying to examine me?

513
00:31:03,394 --> 00:31:05,294
Maybe.

514
00:31:05,396 --> 00:31:08,490
Not in here.

515
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,694
That Sterling guy knows
an awful lot about you.

516
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:13,771
I've been working here for nine years.

517
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:19,870
Greg, don't. It isn't my office.

518
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:27,382
It's okay.

519
00:31:27,485 --> 00:31:28,884
No, I mean it.

520
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:35,615
Come on.

521
00:31:40,598 --> 00:31:43,396
Greg, this isn't fun.

522
00:31:43,501 --> 00:31:45,901
This is what you want, right?

523
00:31:46,004 --> 00:31:47,528
Stop.

524
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:48,571
It's okay.

525
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:50,038
Greg, no!

526
00:32:21,172 --> 00:32:22,867
Are you ready to go?

527
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:27,644
I don't want to miss our reservation.

528
00:32:27,745 --> 00:32:29,303
No, of course not.

529
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:46,192
They're changing the guard
at Buckingham Palace.

530
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:48,765
Christopher Robin went down with Alice.

531
00:32:48,866 --> 00:32:50,595
Very good.

532
00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:52,135
You look well, Roger.

533
00:32:52,236 --> 00:32:53,498
Best baby-sitter in the world.

534
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:58,438
So.

535
00:32:58,543 --> 00:33:00,909
I call to order a meeting of the partners

536
00:33:01,012 --> 00:33:04,743
in the presence of our attorney,
Mr. Whitehouse.

537
00:33:04,849 --> 00:33:06,180
Members attending...

538
00:33:06,284 --> 00:33:07,911
Bertram Cooper, senior partner,

539
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:11,386
Roger Sterling, senior partner,

540
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:13,923
and Alice Cooper, secretary-treasurer.

541
00:33:14,025 --> 00:33:16,687
And Donald Draper, absent.

542
00:33:16,794 --> 00:33:22,289
We are meeting to discuss the merger
with Putnam, Powell & Lowe,

543
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:27,030
the details of which
we've all had time to examine,

544
00:33:27,138 --> 00:33:28,696
including Mr. Whitehouse.

545
00:33:28,806 --> 00:33:30,273
Where's Mr. Draper?

546
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:32,843
Do you want me to go get
a picture of him so you can stare at it?

547
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:34,935
His 12% makes him

548
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:37,913
mathematically insignificant.

549
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:41,747
Still, I would like to know
what he thinks, wouldn't you?

550
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,650
He's very sawy.

551
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:44,881
Alice...

552
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:48,721
I'm sorry, I don't know
whose eyes to look at.

553
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:52,160
Where is Draper?

554
00:33:52,263 --> 00:33:55,664
He took a business trip to California.

555
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:57,530
He's taking some time.

556
00:33:57,635 --> 00:33:58,602
Marital troubles.

557
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,466
Don't write that down.

558
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:02,471
He stands to make over
half a million dollars.

559
00:34:02,573 --> 00:34:03,801
Let's proceed, shall we?

560
00:34:21,626 --> 00:34:23,025
That a '34 Sedan?

561
00:34:23,127 --> 00:34:25,027
Mostly.

562
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:27,461
What'd you do to it?

563
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:30,295
Made some improvements.

564
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:33,393
It's got a '60 Nailhead,
backed up '39 LaSalle transmission,

565
00:34:33,504 --> 00:34:34,971
and a '40 banjo rear end.

566
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:38,600
Two Fords and a Buick.

567
00:34:38,709 --> 00:34:39,835
What happened here?

568
00:34:39,944 --> 00:34:42,276
Dropped the spindle 4 inches.

569
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,438
You know anything about hot rods?

570
00:34:44,816 --> 00:34:47,376
No, but I remember these.

571
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:49,976
I used to sell them. Used.

572
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,919
All motor, no weight.

573
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:54,048
How fast does it go?

574
00:34:54,158 --> 00:34:57,355
Well, that one does
a quarter in 11 seconds.

575
00:34:57,462 --> 00:34:59,430
This one's going to scare people.

576
00:35:02,066 --> 00:35:03,533
Yeah, the color on that one,

577
00:35:03,634 --> 00:35:04,965
I've never seen anything like it.

578
00:35:05,069 --> 00:35:08,470
I'm Kess. That's my kid Doogie.

579
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:10,507
Dick.

580
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:13,771
The color is courtesy of Boy Wonder
of "Indian-no-place."

581
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:15,277
Walt. Indianapolis.

582
00:35:15,379 --> 00:35:17,745
You guys need any help?

583
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:19,077
I'm looking for work.

584
00:35:19,183 --> 00:35:20,810
Working on hot rods?

585
00:35:20,918 --> 00:35:22,408
I don't know. Don't people buy them?

586
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:25,978
There's a couple of custom shops,
and they do great,

587
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:29,025
but I came out here to get into it,
and I'm working at a bar.

588
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,253
He's an artist.

589
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:31,623
He could build a car, look just like you.

590
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:34,497
I'd love to see you race.

591
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:35,827
Sunday.

592
00:35:35,933 --> 00:35:37,366
Lions Drag Strip.

593
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:38,526
Long Beach.

594
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:44,068
I'll look into that.

595
00:35:58,356 --> 00:36:00,347
Mr. Sterling?

596
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:01,857
Yea.

597
00:36:01,959 --> 00:36:04,223
Miss Cooper?

598
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:05,761
Yea.

599
00:36:05,863 --> 00:36:08,423
Bertram Cooper?

600
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:12,831
Yea.

601
00:36:15,773 --> 00:36:17,673
So we'll proceed.

602
00:36:17,775 --> 00:36:22,235
Mr. Whitehouse
will prepare a counteroffer.

603
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:23,836
Wonderful.

604
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:25,040
Meeting adjourned.

605
00:36:25,149 --> 00:36:26,377
Well done.

606
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:29,510
Look who just got richer.

607
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:32,521
This is good for you, too.

608
00:36:32,623 --> 00:36:35,114
You have your children to think of.

609
00:36:35,226 --> 00:36:37,194
I just have the one.

610
00:36:37,295 --> 00:36:38,592
Really?

611
00:37:03,254 --> 00:37:04,346
Hello, Joan.

612
00:37:04,455 --> 00:37:05,922
Hello.

613
00:37:06,023 --> 00:37:07,422
Have you heard from him today?

614
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:08,822
No.

615
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,953
Do you think it's odd?

616
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:14,691
I don't think about it at all.

617
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,329
Congratulations.

618
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:19,528
Thank you.

619
00:37:19,637 --> 00:37:21,571
Your fiancé is so handsome.

620
00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:22,969
He is.

621
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:26,043
He's the doctor you hope to see
but only exists in the movies.

622
00:37:26,143 --> 00:37:27,838
Thank you.

623
00:37:30,214 --> 00:37:32,444
He's specializing in thoracic surgery.

624
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,108
It's very difficult.

625
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:36,277
And he volunteers
at Harlem Hospital Center,

626
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:37,979
stitching up Negro children.

627
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,920
Well, he's a keeper.

628
00:37:40,024 --> 00:37:40,991
When's the wedding again?

629
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,424
Look who I found protesting in the lobby.

630
00:37:43,527 --> 00:37:45,119
Our man from the evening news.

631
00:37:45,229 --> 00:37:46,992
Welcome back.

632
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,999
Look at you. What's different?

633
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:52,535
Nothing. How was Mississippi?

634
00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:54,605
I think we made a difference.

635
00:37:54,705 --> 00:37:56,764
And it was the adventure of a lifetime.

636
00:37:56,874 --> 00:37:59,399
Sheila dropped him three days into it.

637
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:02,579
There's a Bankers Box in the corner.

638
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,443
What the hell is this?

639
00:38:04,548 --> 00:38:05,480
My new office.

640
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:07,073
What?

641
00:38:07,184 --> 00:38:09,812
Why don't you just put on
Draper's pants while you're at it?

642
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,649
You have your own office? You?

643
00:38:11,756 --> 00:38:12,848
I'm the head of television,

644
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:16,051
and I spend the day
staring at an orangutan.

645
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,594
I have some unpacking to do.

646
00:38:18,696 --> 00:38:20,527
Has anyone heard from Don?

647
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:22,030
Yes. He called.

648
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,259
He wants you to get back to work.

649
00:38:25,736 --> 00:38:27,431
I'd get a new couch if I were you!

650
00:38:27,538 --> 00:38:29,233
Thank you!

651
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:34,074
Do you know who I talk to about this?

652
00:38:34,178 --> 00:38:37,113
I'll have it taken care of.

653
00:38:37,214 --> 00:38:38,112
Christmas.

654
00:38:38,215 --> 00:38:39,773
I'm getting married at Christmas.

655
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:42,284
That's wonderful.

656
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,155
Hello?

657
00:38:53,764 --> 00:38:55,891
Sally, can you come in here?

658
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,399
I'm in the living room.

659
00:39:00,604 --> 00:39:02,037
Hello, Mommy.

660
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:06,740
I want to talk to you.

661
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:08,141
Okay.

662
00:39:17,121 --> 00:39:21,922
I realize I haven't been
completely fair to you.

663
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:26,156
And if there is something you want,
I'd love to give it to you.

664
00:39:26,263 --> 00:39:29,255
You're getting to be a big girl.

665
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:34,361
Someday you'll want something,
and I won't be able to give it to you.

666
00:39:40,611 --> 00:39:42,704
Oh, Mommy,

667
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:44,178
they're beautiful.

668
00:39:44,281 --> 00:39:45,373
Thank you.

669
00:39:49,253 --> 00:39:50,481
You're welcome.

670
00:39:50,588 --> 00:39:53,148
Can we go now?

671
00:39:56,093 --> 00:39:57,492
Do you have homework?

672
00:39:57,595 --> 00:39:58,584
Arithmetic,

673
00:39:58,696 --> 00:40:00,664
but I can do it in the car.

674
00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:07,133
Sally, now that you're a big girl,

675
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:09,263
I'm going to tell you something.

676
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:16,813
Your father and I are
having a disagreement,

677
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:18,677
and he went away.

678
00:40:21,118 --> 00:40:22,244
Where did he go?

679
00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:26,055
I'm not sure.

680
00:40:26,157 --> 00:40:28,751
When is he coming home?

681
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:33,592
I don't know.

682
00:40:33,697 --> 00:40:36,825
I know it's hard to understand.

683
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:41,735
But I promise,
everything's going to be okay.

684
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:42,965
Okay.

685
00:40:47,711 --> 00:40:49,702
Mommy, you're bleeding.

686
00:40:51,982 --> 00:40:54,450
Go take those in the kitchen
and have a snack.

687
00:40:54,552 --> 00:40:57,020
I'm going to change.

688
00:41:06,163 --> 00:41:08,893
That's an ink blot.

689
00:41:08,999 --> 00:41:09,966
You see what you want to see.

690
00:41:10,067 --> 00:41:13,298
You don't have to pick them.
Just put your palm on the deck.

691
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:43,265
Did you read it?

692
00:41:43,367 --> 00:41:45,494
I did.

693
00:41:45,603 --> 00:41:48,197
Reminded me of New York.

694
00:41:48,305 --> 00:41:49,670
And it made me worry about you.

695
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,938
What about the cards?

696
00:41:56,046 --> 00:41:58,606
Should I be worried?

697
00:41:58,716 --> 00:42:01,150
It's all here.

698
00:42:01,252 --> 00:42:03,846
You're definitely in a strange place.

699
00:42:03,954 --> 00:42:05,785
But here is the sun.

700
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:10,717
That can't be good.

701
00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:12,022
It is.

702
00:42:12,129 --> 00:42:14,097
It's the end of the world.

703
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:16,098
It's the resurrection.

704
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,135
Do you want to know
what this means or not?

705
00:42:19,236 --> 00:42:20,897
No, I don't.

706
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:34,178
I can smell the ocean.

707
00:42:34,285 --> 00:42:35,912
This is the one.

708
00:42:36,954 --> 00:42:38,319
Who's she?

709
00:42:38,422 --> 00:42:42,085
She's the soul of the world.

710
00:42:42,192 --> 00:42:44,660
She's in a very important spot here.

711
00:42:44,762 --> 00:42:48,027
This is you,
what you are bringing to the reading.

712
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:51,597
She says you are part of the world.

713
00:42:51,702 --> 00:42:53,192
Air, water.

714
00:42:53,304 --> 00:42:56,899
Every living thing is connected to you.

715
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:01,340
It's a nice thought.

716
00:43:01,445 --> 00:43:03,037
It is.

717
00:43:04,315 --> 00:43:05,907
What does it mean?

718
00:43:07,484 --> 00:43:11,079
It means the only thing keeping you
from being happy

719
00:43:11,188 --> 00:43:13,349
is the belief that you are alone.

720
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:21,623
What if that's true?

721
00:43:23,734 --> 00:43:25,429
Then you can change.

722
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:29,138
People don't change.

723
00:43:33,177 --> 00:43:35,702
I think she stands for wisdom.

724
00:43:35,813 --> 00:43:38,611
As you live, you learn things.

725
00:43:59,036 --> 00:44:00,333
Come in.

726
00:44:02,906 --> 00:44:04,464
Hello.

727
00:44:04,575 --> 00:44:06,566
Look at you, celebrating.

728
00:44:06,677 --> 00:44:08,542
You getting a secretary?

729
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:10,238
Yes.

730
00:44:10,347 --> 00:44:12,645
Well, she's in for it.

731
00:44:15,386 --> 00:44:16,910
You should get some pictures in here

732
00:44:17,021 --> 00:44:20,548
of your family
or some people or something.

733
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:23,525
I want to put up my campaigns.

734
00:44:23,627 --> 00:44:25,060
Isn't that Freddie's bar?

735
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:26,288
He left it.

736
00:44:26,397 --> 00:44:28,456
How the hell did you swing this?

737
00:44:28,565 --> 00:44:31,261
I'm sleeping with Don.

738
00:44:31,368 --> 00:44:32,892
It's really working out.

739
00:44:37,908 --> 00:44:39,500
I haven't told anyone

740
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:41,805
because it's probably
a formality at this point,

741
00:44:41,912 --> 00:44:44,642
but Clearasil's pulled out.

742
00:44:44,748 --> 00:44:46,545
How did that happen?

743
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:48,811
Sales have been great.

744
00:44:48,919 --> 00:44:50,318
What about your father-in-law?

745
00:44:50,421 --> 00:44:53,117
I guess I'm not doing my job.

746
00:44:53,223 --> 00:44:54,986
I know that's not true.

747
00:44:55,092 --> 00:44:58,118
Don'll dance on my grave,
if he ever comes back.

748
00:44:59,797 --> 00:45:02,857
Did something happen in Los Angeles?

749
00:45:05,636 --> 00:45:07,160
Yes.

750
00:45:07,271 --> 00:45:09,000
He disappeared.

751
00:45:09,106 --> 00:45:10,300
He didn't even check out.

752
00:45:10,407 --> 00:45:12,272
I almost called the police.

753
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:14,276
Well, why didn't you?
Maybe something happened.

754
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:17,404
Well, it didn't surprise me.

755
00:45:17,514 --> 00:45:18,879
I know some things about him.

756
00:45:18,982 --> 00:45:21,712
I'm not interested in gossip, Pete.

757
00:45:21,819 --> 00:45:26,347
All I'm saying is
he may not be coming back.

758
00:45:26,457 --> 00:45:28,220
He's done it before.

759
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:33,687
Whatever Don does or doesn't do,

760
00:45:33,797 --> 00:45:35,992
I am sure it's with good reason.

761
00:45:40,938 --> 00:45:43,668
Guess I should probably go home.

762
00:45:47,711 --> 00:45:49,508
Congratulations.

763
00:45:51,048 --> 00:45:53,175
Good night.

764
00:47:39,423 --> 00:47:42,392
