1
00:01:17,917 --> 00:01:20,652
They say as soon as you have
to cut down on your drinking

2
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,387
you have a drinking problem.

3
00:01:25,691 --> 00:01:27,759
My mind is a jumble.

4
00:01:27,827 --> 00:01:29,828
I can't organize my thoughts

5
00:01:29,895 --> 00:01:32,497
and typing feels like work.

6
00:01:34,533 --> 00:01:36,901
I've never written more than 250 words,

7
00:01:36,969 --> 00:01:38,737
not even in High School...

8
00:01:38,804 --> 00:01:41,706
Five paragraphs, 50 words apiece.

9
00:01:41,774 --> 00:01:43,742
God, I was lazy.

10
00:01:45,611 --> 00:01:47,412
I should've finished High School.

11
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,547
Everything could have been different.

12
00:02:04,664 --> 00:02:06,464
Are you okay, sir?

13
00:02:59,351 --> 00:03:01,086
Summer's coming.

14
00:03:01,153 --> 00:03:03,254
I smelled it.

15
00:03:03,322 --> 00:03:05,957
I kind of thought I smelled corn,
which is impossible.

16
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,494
There it was again.

17
00:03:10,796 --> 00:03:12,063
Perfume.

18
00:03:26,011 --> 00:03:27,946
Morning, Miss Blankenship.

19
00:03:28,013 --> 00:03:29,848
How was your surgery?

20
00:03:29,915 --> 00:03:31,683
It was a nightmare...

21
00:03:31,751 --> 00:03:33,752
The ether and the blindness...

22
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:35,286
And then I got the goggles.

23
00:03:35,354 --> 00:03:36,955
So everything's good?

24
00:03:37,022 --> 00:03:39,257
I'll tell you... I was blind

25
00:03:39,325 --> 00:03:41,926
- and now I see.
- Well, good.

26
00:03:41,994 --> 00:03:43,928
- If you need more time...
- I'm fine, Roger.

27
00:03:45,531 --> 00:03:46,931
I'm kidding around here.

28
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,467
My book's at home.

29
00:03:49,535 --> 00:03:52,137
Can you give me the number
for a Bethany van Nuys?

30
00:03:57,843 --> 00:03:59,344
May... Maybe lift it up and drop it down.

31
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,881
I'm stronger than you,
but I'm not that strong.

32
00:04:02,948 --> 00:04:04,949
Stop, stop....

33
00:04:05,017 --> 00:04:07,285
- He's right.
- I feel like Margaret Mead.

34
00:04:07,353 --> 00:04:09,387
You know what, Harry?
I think this is a show.

35
00:04:09,455 --> 00:04:11,356
Okay, we're gonna do it.

36
00:04:11,423 --> 00:04:12,857
Harry, get out of the way.

37
00:04:19,965 --> 00:04:22,066
What is going on out here?

38
00:04:22,134 --> 00:04:24,068
I'll be honest, I don't know.

39
00:04:24,136 --> 00:04:26,037
I got blockaded on my way
back from the men's room.

40
00:04:26,105 --> 00:04:27,939
Thank you, gentlemen....

41
00:04:28,007 --> 00:04:30,909
- Everyone back to work.
- It took my watch.

42
00:04:30,976 --> 00:04:33,344
- What?
- Ken was buying a Clark bar...

43
00:04:33,412 --> 00:04:34,681
But it ate my change, and since

44
00:04:34,682 --> 00:04:36,114
Danny's not here, we went to Peggy.

45
00:04:36,182 --> 00:04:38,183
But it turns out Joey's
got the smallest hands.

46
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,651
No, I said I had done it before.

47
00:04:39,718 --> 00:04:41,820
Why don't you put another
dime in the machine

48
00:04:41,887 --> 00:04:43,655
- and pull again?
- Do you really think we didn't try that?

49
00:04:43,722 --> 00:04:45,023
- This thing is a bandit.
- Yeah.

50
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:46,457
Cut it out!

51
00:04:46,525 --> 00:04:48,026
Don't make me come out here again.

52
00:04:48,093 --> 00:04:49,661
Sorry, mom.

53
00:04:49,728 --> 00:04:51,329
Pardon?

54
00:04:51,397 --> 00:04:53,364
Okay. Hey, it's over.

55
00:04:53,432 --> 00:04:55,133
I'm trying to get my watch.
What am I supposed to do?

56
00:04:55,201 --> 00:04:58,036
Call the complaint number.
Have an adult solve this problem.

57
00:04:58,103 --> 00:04:59,771
What is going on out here?

58
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:01,739
I was in the midst of an extremely
important telephone call.

59
00:05:01,807 --> 00:05:04,242
Joan was just handing out demerits...

60
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:06,945
Joey, in my office.

61
00:05:07,012 --> 00:05:08,913
- Oh.
- Go easy on him.

62
00:05:08,981 --> 00:05:11,549
A private spanking... Just like my dream.

63
00:05:11,617 --> 00:05:13,618
When did we get a vending machine?

64
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:20,358
I know you're a freelancer and
you spend time in other offices,

65
00:05:20,426 --> 00:05:22,727
but you should know this
behavior is not tolerated here.

66
00:05:22,795 --> 00:05:24,762
- Yes, ma'am.
- I should let you know

67
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,331
there's a problem now between us.

68
00:05:26,398 --> 00:05:27,665
Why are you always on my case?

69
00:05:27,733 --> 00:05:29,901
Because you are particularly disrespectful.

70
00:05:29,969 --> 00:05:32,170
No, I'm not. Stan's worse.

71
00:05:32,238 --> 00:05:35,206
Maybe he's better at his job.

72
00:05:37,209 --> 00:05:38,776
I'm glad you're amused.

73
00:05:38,844 --> 00:05:41,379
You're so arrogant.

74
00:05:41,447 --> 00:05:43,982
Me? What do you do around here

75
00:05:44,049 --> 00:05:45,984
besides walking around like
you're trying to get raped?

76
00:05:46,051 --> 00:05:47,952
Excuse me?

77
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,954
I'm not some young girl off the bus.

78
00:05:50,022 --> 00:05:51,322
I don't need some
madam from a Shanghai

79
00:05:51,323 --> 00:05:52,390
whorehouse to show me the ropes.

80
00:05:58,697 --> 00:06:00,598
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't know you were in here.

81
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:03,001
Where the hell else would I be?
This is my office.

82
00:06:03,068 --> 00:06:05,470
And you all better stop
cutting through here.

83
00:06:05,537 --> 00:06:07,105
It's not a thoroughfare.

84
00:06:07,172 --> 00:06:09,741
Take the extra steps. You could use them.

85
00:06:11,076 --> 00:06:12,477
You're right.

86
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:17,282
Go ahead. I'm leaving anyway.

87
00:06:17,349 --> 00:06:18,650
I'm sorry.

88
00:06:29,628 --> 00:06:31,162
Oh no.

89
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:35,967
Oh, Miss Blankenship, good to see you.

90
00:06:36,035 --> 00:06:38,469
I mean, nice to see you.
I mean, welcome back.

91
00:06:38,537 --> 00:06:42,006
- Let me help you with those.
- Finally, someone offers.

92
00:06:42,074 --> 00:06:46,377
I told you I can see with the glasses.

93
00:06:46,445 --> 00:06:49,914
- I'm out of cigarettes.
- I've got your liquor.

94
00:06:49,982 --> 00:06:52,417
I only have two hands.

95
00:06:52,484 --> 00:06:56,587
- I'm set.
- And then you're not.

96
00:06:56,655 --> 00:06:58,256
Take those back to the storeroom,

97
00:06:58,324 --> 00:07:00,258
and while you're there
get me some cigarettes.

98
00:07:00,326 --> 00:07:02,160
Your wife called earlier.

99
00:07:02,227 --> 00:07:05,596
- She's not my wife.
- Mrs. Francis said to remind you

100
00:07:05,664 --> 00:07:08,366
that you can't have the kids this weekend.
It's very complicated.

101
00:07:08,434 --> 00:07:10,034
It's Bobby's birthday party Sunday.

102
00:07:10,102 --> 00:07:11,803
It's gene's birthday.

103
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:14,472
Did you want me to buy him or her a gift?

104
00:07:15,674 --> 00:07:16,741
No.

105
00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:38,997
What a pleasant surprise.

106
00:07:54,413 --> 00:07:56,381
You don't mind that I'm home early, do you?

107
00:07:56,448 --> 00:07:58,416
You said you didn't want watch me pack.

108
00:07:58,484 --> 00:08:00,952
You don't even want to say goodbye.

109
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,653
I don't.

110
00:08:04,256 --> 00:08:06,858
Joanie, it's basic training.
I'll be back.

111
00:08:06,925 --> 00:08:09,694
You said they use live ammunition.

112
00:08:12,264 --> 00:08:15,700
Come on. Come in here.

113
00:08:23,809 --> 00:08:25,877
Greg, that doesn't make everything better.

114
00:08:25,944 --> 00:08:28,513
- It makes it worse.
- It's eight weeks.

115
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,148
I'm gonna come back in uniform.

116
00:08:30,215 --> 00:08:31,549
You know you'll like that.

117
00:08:33,852 --> 00:08:36,721
What am I gonna do?
Who am I gonna talk to?

118
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:40,191
Well, you'll talk to your friends at work.

119
00:08:51,804 --> 00:08:54,906
Is this the way you want
to spend this time, crying?

120
00:09:04,817 --> 00:09:07,752
- I can't.
- Mmm, sure you can.

121
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:11,289
Just pretend we're in some midtown hotel

122
00:09:11,356 --> 00:09:14,692
and we both snuck away for the afternoon.

123
00:09:38,283 --> 00:09:40,818
More and more every day about Vietnam.

124
00:09:40,886 --> 00:09:43,654
I hope it's not another Korea.

125
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:46,624
I sound like a little girl,

126
00:09:46,692 --> 00:09:48,192
writing down what happened today.

127
00:09:52,564 --> 00:09:55,099
Sunday is gene's birthday party.

128
00:09:55,167 --> 00:09:58,136
I know I can't go.

129
00:09:58,203 --> 00:10:00,104
I keep thinking about him.

130
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,108
He was conceived in a moment of desperation

131
00:10:04,176 --> 00:10:06,644
and born into a mess.

132
00:10:23,778 --> 00:10:25,278
A list of things I'd like to do.

133
00:10:25,297 --> 00:10:27,165
One,

134
00:10:27,232 --> 00:10:29,300
climb mount Kilimanjaro...

135
00:10:29,368 --> 00:10:32,136
Go anywhere in Africa, actually;

136
00:10:32,204 --> 00:10:35,406
two, gain a modicum

137
00:10:35,474 --> 00:10:37,074
of control over the way I feel.

138
00:10:39,444 --> 00:10:41,045
I want to wake up

139
00:10:42,447 --> 00:10:44,115
and I want to be that man.

140
00:10:50,422 --> 00:10:52,256
Could you get that to el jefe?

141
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,197
So mountain dew... everything
kind of fell apart there.

142
00:10:59,264 --> 00:11:02,166
- They don't like the work.
- Too bad.

143
00:11:02,234 --> 00:11:04,168
Well, somebody showed a
couple of bottlers the work

144
00:11:04,236 --> 00:11:06,771
and they don't like witches brewing things.

145
00:11:06,838 --> 00:11:08,906
They don't like the occult in general.

146
00:11:08,974 --> 00:11:11,709
And you told them it's their
hillbilly working a still?

147
00:11:11,777 --> 00:11:13,611
I did, but the fact remains

148
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:15,379
that in the world of sodie pop

149
00:11:15,447 --> 00:11:17,682
Pepsi is the tail and the
bottlers are the dog.

150
00:11:17,749 --> 00:11:19,016
They just want us to change the drawing.

151
00:11:20,953 --> 00:11:22,587
Except it's damaged goods.

152
00:11:22,654 --> 00:11:24,055
They're never gonna want
to see that board again.

153
00:11:24,122 --> 00:11:26,657
- Start over.
- I did it with Joey.

154
00:11:26,725 --> 00:11:28,326
Do you want Stan to take over?

155
00:11:28,393 --> 00:11:31,162
You're spreading me awful thin.

156
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,830
Do you want me to tell
Joan to figure it out?

157
00:11:32,898 --> 00:11:35,766
"It"? You don't even know what "it" is.

158
00:11:35,834 --> 00:11:38,002
Miss Blankenship, get Joan in here.

159
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,937
She startles when you do that.

160
00:11:40,005 --> 00:11:43,975
I had an uncle who was blind.

161
00:11:44,042 --> 00:11:46,744
She's not blind. She's recovering
from cataract surgery.

162
00:12:15,641 --> 00:12:18,843
He would come in the room
and he would say...

163
00:12:23,081 --> 00:12:25,916
- What can I do for you?
- A redo on mountain dew.

164
00:12:25,984 --> 00:12:28,719
I want to make Joey full
time for a couple of weeks.

165
00:12:28,787 --> 00:12:32,390
I'd have to double-check
on his availability,

166
00:12:32,457 --> 00:12:34,158
but are you sure he's the right fit?

167
00:12:34,226 --> 00:12:37,595
- He did the first round.
- And we're redoing it.

168
00:12:37,663 --> 00:12:39,463
It's more complicated than that.

169
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,685
Well, this may not be the time or

170
00:12:43,686 --> 00:12:45,770
the place to bring this up but...

171
00:12:45,837 --> 00:12:48,339
- What now?
- I've been hearing complaints about him.

172
00:12:48,407 --> 00:12:52,209
- Really?
- He's not a gentleman with the girls.

173
00:12:52,277 --> 00:12:55,112
Okay. One juicy story?

174
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,348
I'll protect those concerned

175
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:59,917
but it involves an extremely blue joke.

176
00:12:59,985 --> 00:13:02,620
- When?
- It doesn't matter.

177
00:13:02,688 --> 00:13:05,255
Fine, you can tell it to me later.
Boys will be boys.

178
00:13:05,323 --> 00:13:06,524
Of course,

179
00:13:06,591 --> 00:13:09,727
but I'm going to call in other books.
There's too much to do.

180
00:13:12,658 --> 00:13:15,458
I know the joke.
This guy balls are so big...

181
00:13:15,967 --> 00:13:17,702
- Are we done?
- Sure.

182
00:13:23,608 --> 00:13:26,477
Can you tell Ray Charles to
come in here and clean this up?

183
00:13:29,114 --> 00:13:30,981
And as soon as you get to Hollywood,

184
00:13:31,049 --> 00:13:32,750
you find out that that myth is...

185
00:13:32,818 --> 00:13:34,585
Well, it had some truth to it.

186
00:13:34,653 --> 00:13:36,287
There is instant fame.

187
00:13:36,355 --> 00:13:38,456
What's this have to do with "Peyton place"?

188
00:13:38,523 --> 00:13:40,324
Well, we went down to the set

189
00:13:40,392 --> 00:13:42,860
and Ryan was doing this scene
against another rival...

190
00:13:42,928 --> 00:13:45,629
I can't tell you who...
And the guy was awful.

191
00:13:45,697 --> 00:13:48,165
I start to hear him talk
about a young fresh face,

192
00:13:48,233 --> 00:13:49,800
wholesome but a little mischievous.

193
00:13:49,868 --> 00:13:51,702
Am I crazy?

194
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:54,605
I don't understand.
You want to be an actor?

195
00:13:54,673 --> 00:13:57,708
Does that sound like me? That's you.
You could do it.

196
00:13:57,776 --> 00:14:00,077
I know the right people...
Maybe not the big screen,

197
00:14:00,145 --> 00:14:01,812
but the small screen definitely.

198
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,848
I'm kind of down to earth.

199
00:14:03,915 --> 00:14:07,685
You're so handsome.
I showed them a picture.

200
00:14:07,753 --> 00:14:09,987
How'd you get a picture?

201
00:14:10,055 --> 00:14:11,617
I sent one of those polaroids from the

202
00:14:11,618 --> 00:14:13,057
Christmas party to Bernie Kowalski.

203
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:15,526
Mr. Crane, I hate to interrupt you,

204
00:14:15,594 --> 00:14:18,429
but I have Peggy Olson out
here looking for Mr. Baird.

205
00:14:20,499 --> 00:14:22,933
Well, thank you for thinking of me.

206
00:14:23,001 --> 00:14:24,702
You're too modest, you know that?

207
00:14:28,707 --> 00:14:30,040
What were you doing in there?

208
00:14:30,108 --> 00:14:32,009
Everyplace I've worked
there's always some old fairy

209
00:14:32,077 --> 00:14:33,778
who comes onto me,
but that was the weirdest by far.

210
00:14:33,845 --> 00:14:35,813
Yes, everybody wants you, Joey.

211
00:14:35,881 --> 00:14:38,516
- It happens a lot.
- What did you do to Joan?

212
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:41,218
- I told her off.
- Well, you shouldn't have.

213
00:14:41,286 --> 00:14:43,026
- She's important around here.
- Let me

214
00:14:43,027 --> 00:14:44,722
tell you something about the big ragu.

215
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:48,025
We're creative, and she's
an overblown secretary.

216
00:14:48,093 --> 00:14:49,693
Fine, don't listen to me.

217
00:14:49,761 --> 00:14:51,629
There's a Joan in every company.

218
00:14:51,696 --> 00:14:53,464
My mother was a Joan,

219
00:14:53,532 --> 00:14:55,366
always telling everybody what to do.

220
00:14:55,434 --> 00:14:56,854
She even wore a pen around her neck

221
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:58,235
so people would stare at her tits.

222
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:02,206
She's not your mother, and she
and Lane basically run this place.

223
00:15:02,274 --> 00:15:04,775
Okay, message received.

224
00:15:06,278 --> 00:15:08,679
Ugh, is it time to go yet?

225
00:15:17,912 --> 00:15:19,780
Glad you could make it.

226
00:15:19,847 --> 00:15:22,182
Well, we were on our way
to the theater anyway.

227
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:25,218
Ralph Stuben, this is my wife Betty.

228
00:15:25,286 --> 00:15:27,754
- Pleased to meet you.
- I hope you don't mind.

229
00:15:27,822 --> 00:15:29,990
The Congressman wanted
me to do this immediately

230
00:15:30,057 --> 00:15:31,892
and he didn't want me
to do it over the phone.

231
00:15:31,959 --> 00:15:33,827
She doesn't mind,

232
00:15:33,895 --> 00:15:35,862
and she's very discreet.

233
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:37,931
That's the curse of a political wife...

234
00:15:37,999 --> 00:15:39,325
That and having to eat dinner with

235
00:15:39,326 --> 00:15:40,534
a lot of people you don't know.

236
00:15:40,601 --> 00:15:42,936
Betty's no stranger to public service.

237
00:15:43,004 --> 00:15:44,544
So what show did you see?

238
00:15:44,545 --> 00:15:46,039
Why don't we get a drink at the bar?

239
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:50,944
It'll only be a minute.

240
00:15:54,582 --> 00:15:55,749
Thank you.

241
00:15:58,753 --> 00:16:03,256
So are you a Felix or an Oscar?

242
00:16:03,324 --> 00:16:05,425
Like most men I'd rather be an Oscar,

243
00:16:05,493 --> 00:16:07,627
but I'm probably a Felix....

244
00:16:09,363 --> 00:16:11,731
Every date feels like
a first date with you.

245
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:13,733
Is that good or bad?

246
00:16:13,801 --> 00:16:16,369
It's just I know you must
be seeing someone else.

247
00:16:16,437 --> 00:16:18,772
And don't say no, because
it'll just hurt me more.

248
00:16:20,174 --> 00:16:23,310
Look, I'm here with you right now.

249
00:16:23,377 --> 00:16:25,445
We're on a date

250
00:16:25,513 --> 00:16:27,647
and I thought we were
getting to know each other.

251
00:16:27,715 --> 00:16:29,249
It doesn't just accumulate.

252
00:16:29,317 --> 00:16:32,552
It takes intense, prolonged contact.

253
00:16:34,422 --> 00:16:36,389
Don't you want to be close with anyone?

254
00:16:37,692 --> 00:16:39,226
I do.

255
00:16:40,995 --> 00:16:43,263
I know we're from different generations

256
00:16:43,331 --> 00:16:46,199
but I'm going to need more from you.

257
00:16:46,267 --> 00:16:48,635
We are from different generations,

258
00:16:48,703 --> 00:16:50,570
because I don't remember
women pushing this hard.

259
00:16:51,939 --> 00:16:53,573
And I'm not seeing anyone.

260
00:16:53,641 --> 00:16:55,508
I'm working.

261
00:16:55,576 --> 00:16:57,911
All the time.

262
00:16:57,979 --> 00:16:59,312
Well, I get excited when you call

263
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,615
and then I don't hear from you.

264
00:17:01,682 --> 00:17:03,359
We don't have to get married for me

265
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,085
to show you off at the country club.

266
00:17:05,152 --> 00:17:07,854
Don.

267
00:17:07,922 --> 00:17:09,522
How are you?

268
00:17:10,992 --> 00:17:12,859
I'm fine, Henry.

269
00:17:12,927 --> 00:17:16,029
Henry, Betty, this is Miss van Nuys.

270
00:17:16,097 --> 00:17:19,099
- Bethany.
- Enjoy your dinner.

271
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,675
My goodness, what was that?

272
00:17:28,743 --> 00:17:31,745
Well, that was actually my ex-wife

273
00:17:31,812 --> 00:17:34,748
and her husband

274
00:17:34,815 --> 00:17:37,150
and some slob who's about to have
the worst dinner of his life.

275
00:17:37,218 --> 00:17:39,152
What? Her?

276
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:55,035
Well, first of all, my official
capacity if anyone asks...

277
00:17:55,102 --> 00:17:56,403
I'm here to thank you for securing

278
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:58,772
the Governor's endorsement
for Congressman Lindsay.

279
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:01,274
That's no small feat, I'm sure.

280
00:18:01,342 --> 00:18:03,643
Well, rocky only hates him
because he's handsome.

281
00:18:03,711 --> 00:18:06,446
Well, not to worry.

282
00:18:06,514 --> 00:18:07,948
Lindsay just wants to be Mayor.

283
00:18:08,015 --> 00:18:10,283
Any talk of the White House is fiction.

284
00:18:10,351 --> 00:18:12,986
Huh. I guess he hasn't
seen the cover of "Life."

285
00:18:15,122 --> 00:18:16,156
Okay.

286
00:18:16,223 --> 00:18:19,359
Hypothetically,

287
00:18:19,427 --> 00:18:21,928
the Congressman is putting
together a team with his eye on '72

288
00:18:21,996 --> 00:18:26,633
and well, it would be built...

289
00:18:26,701 --> 00:18:29,569
If it were going to be built... Around you.

290
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,908
And yes, he doesn't want
rocky to have you either.

291
00:18:39,013 --> 00:18:41,381
Elizabeth, do you know what you want?

292
00:18:41,449 --> 00:18:43,483
Honey, this part is almost over.

293
00:18:43,551 --> 00:18:45,585
I'm sorry, you'll have to excuse me.

294
00:18:50,491 --> 00:18:53,159
One drink and she gets flushed.

295
00:18:53,227 --> 00:18:55,962
Yeah, my wife has the other problem.

296
00:19:04,305 --> 00:19:06,339
- Are you okay in there, ma'am?
- Yes, I'm fine.

297
00:19:10,711 --> 00:19:13,480
- You dropped your purse.
- I'll take it.

298
00:19:35,469 --> 00:19:37,404
What did you want me to do,
put you in a cab?

299
00:19:37,471 --> 00:19:39,572
That wouldn't be right.

300
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,641
I can't believe you made me
sit there and look at them.

301
00:19:41,709 --> 00:19:43,576
Nobody said you had to look at them.

302
00:19:43,644 --> 00:19:46,846
You need a drink?
Well, what are you, a wino?

303
00:19:46,914 --> 00:19:50,050
You need a drink? That is not
something you're allowed to say.

304
00:19:50,117 --> 00:19:52,419
Oh, now you decide what
I can and can't say?

305
00:19:52,486 --> 00:19:54,888
I was in a marriage like that before.

306
00:19:54,955 --> 00:19:57,524
You're gonna run into him.
It's a small town.

307
00:19:57,591 --> 00:20:00,927
- I hate him.
- Hate's a strong word, Betty.

308
00:20:00,995 --> 00:20:02,896
I hate Nazis.

309
00:20:02,963 --> 00:20:04,831
I have an ex-wife. She bothers me.

310
00:20:04,899 --> 00:20:07,100
I don't like seeing her. I don't hate her.

311
00:20:07,168 --> 00:20:09,202
- You're a saint.
- I'm an adult.

312
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:12,238
It was upsetting.
Can't you let me have that?

313
00:20:12,306 --> 00:20:14,674
Not when it ruins the whole evening.

314
00:20:14,742 --> 00:20:17,477
This man is asking me to
take Lindsay all the way.

315
00:20:17,545 --> 00:20:20,814
That could happen.
Don Draper doesn't have a say.

316
00:20:20,881 --> 00:20:25,251
- You're right. Who cares about him?
- You do.

317
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:27,187
He's taking up too much space in your life,

318
00:20:27,254 --> 00:20:29,489
maybe in your heart.

319
00:20:29,557 --> 00:20:31,958
That's ridiculous.

320
00:20:32,026 --> 00:20:34,627
Look,

321
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:37,397
maybe we rushed into this.

322
00:20:37,465 --> 00:20:38,798
"We"?

323
00:20:38,866 --> 00:20:41,267
I was six months pregnant when we met.

324
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:45,472
- Pull over.
- Are you kidding me?

325
00:20:45,539 --> 00:20:47,607
Let me out, Henry.

326
00:20:47,675 --> 00:20:49,742
No, you know what? Let me out at the house,

327
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:52,145
because you don't want
to live there anyway.

328
00:20:52,213 --> 00:20:56,449
You can stay at a hotel or
wherever you were when I met you.

329
00:20:56,517 --> 00:20:59,586
In your mansion with your servants.

330
00:20:59,653 --> 00:21:01,554
Shut up, Betty. You're drunk.

331
00:21:25,446 --> 00:21:27,313
What are you doing?

332
00:21:27,381 --> 00:21:29,349
Making you comfortable.

333
00:21:44,098 --> 00:21:46,065
She's a sweet girl

334
00:21:46,133 --> 00:21:48,668
and she wants me to know her,

335
00:21:48,736 --> 00:21:50,570
but I already do.

336
00:21:53,407 --> 00:21:55,375
People tell you who they are,
but we ignore it

337
00:21:55,442 --> 00:21:58,578
because we want them to
be who we want them to be.

338
00:22:05,419 --> 00:22:07,387
To be continued.

339
00:22:13,093 --> 00:22:14,894
I bet she was thinking
of that line all night.

340
00:22:18,465 --> 00:22:20,200
I looked up at the Barbizon

341
00:22:20,267 --> 00:22:22,001
and I thought of all the women in there...

342
00:22:22,069 --> 00:22:24,437
One in every room...

343
00:22:24,505 --> 00:22:26,940
Touching themselves to sleep.

344
00:22:30,578 --> 00:22:32,312
Waverly and 6th.

345
00:22:35,783 --> 00:22:37,383
I like sleeping alone,

346
00:22:37,451 --> 00:22:39,686
stretching out like a skydiver,

347
00:22:41,021 --> 00:22:42,855
cool patches to roll onto.

348
00:22:44,158 --> 00:22:45,625
I just appreciate it more.

349
00:22:50,075 --> 00:22:53,511
No. No! I'm talking now!

350
00:22:54,237 --> 00:22:57,740
I don't care where you go and
I don't care what you do!

351
00:22:57,808 --> 00:23:00,376
So in order...

352
00:23:00,444 --> 00:23:03,379
Would you let me talk? I want my key back,

353
00:23:03,447 --> 00:23:06,449
I don't want to see your shorts on my floor

354
00:23:06,516 --> 00:23:07,717
and I don't want you complaining

355
00:23:07,784 --> 00:23:09,218
that I don't cook 'cause I don't cook!

356
00:23:11,421 --> 00:23:14,123
You know what, David?
Go sitting in the ocean!

357
00:23:14,191 --> 00:23:15,424
Good morning.

358
00:23:20,664 --> 00:23:22,365
Are you leaving already?

359
00:23:26,637 --> 00:23:29,372
Were you going to say goodbye?

360
00:23:29,439 --> 00:23:31,774
I thought you could use the sleep.

361
00:23:34,444 --> 00:23:36,112
I'm sorry, Henry.

362
00:23:38,548 --> 00:23:40,249
Come over here.

363
00:23:52,562 --> 00:23:55,297
I don't want to have to
defend myself all the time.

364
00:23:55,365 --> 00:23:57,466
All the time?

365
00:23:57,534 --> 00:23:59,935
Henry, I'm really sorry.

366
00:24:01,538 --> 00:24:03,272
I know.

367
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,341
Get some sleep.

368
00:24:08,879 --> 00:24:10,579
Carla took the kids to school.

369
00:24:12,149 --> 00:24:15,184
Henry, he was the only
man I'd ever been with.

370
00:24:18,555 --> 00:24:20,089
I'll call you later.

371
00:25:09,973 --> 00:25:11,757
It tastes good, because it still

372
00:25:11,758 --> 00:25:13,709
basically tastes like mountain dew.

373
00:25:13,777 --> 00:25:16,879
And it's very simple to make.
I call it jet fuel.

374
00:25:16,947 --> 00:25:20,082
Rocket fuel, and I like the
simplicity of the idea.

375
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:23,285
- Young people, hillbillies.
- Xerox crapped out again.

376
00:25:23,353 --> 00:25:24,854
I think I killed it.

377
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:29,692
I'll run this specimen over to the lab.

378
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,160
It's delicious.

379
00:25:33,663 --> 00:25:36,766
Ah. You're a haircut, you know that?

380
00:25:36,833 --> 00:25:38,501
You need three ingredients for a cocktail.

381
00:25:38,568 --> 00:25:40,836
Vodka and mountain dew is an emergency.

382
00:25:46,977 --> 00:25:49,111
Don wants our freelance
art director Joey Baird

383
00:25:49,179 --> 00:25:50,846
put on full time for the next three weeks.

384
00:25:50,914 --> 00:25:52,715
None of my business I suppose.

385
00:25:59,956 --> 00:26:02,391
I really think this vending
machine is a troublemaker.

386
00:26:02,459 --> 00:26:04,827
I think it's been a great success.

387
00:26:04,895 --> 00:26:06,829
Revenue is climbing.

388
00:26:06,897 --> 00:26:10,633
I was gonna suggest we
get a sandwich machine.

389
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,201
We'd probably get 40% of the work force

390
00:26:12,202 --> 00:26:13,702
keeping busy through lunch.

391
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:16,138
Or we'd end up with a
bunch of fat secretaries

392
00:26:16,206 --> 00:26:17,873
who think the whole afternoon is lunchtime,

393
00:26:17,941 --> 00:26:20,242
because there's always another
sandwich around the corner.

394
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:22,778
There have been a lot of complaints.

395
00:26:24,214 --> 00:26:25,815
Did you tell them to call the number?

396
00:26:28,952 --> 00:26:31,153
What do you think they're doing
in there... Lane and Joan?

397
00:26:31,221 --> 00:26:34,190
It's an unholy alliance.

398
00:26:34,257 --> 00:26:35,925
I know exactly what they're doing in there.

399
00:26:37,427 --> 00:26:40,996
Joan's on the desk, boobs on the blotter.

400
00:26:41,064 --> 00:26:44,033
Lane's behind her,
probably has a bowler hat.

401
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,267
Am I wrong?

402
00:26:45,335 --> 00:26:47,203
Hey, don't do that.

403
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:49,138
I'm not doing anything. Joan's doing it.

404
00:26:52,809 --> 00:26:54,677
Mountain dew-dah.

405
00:26:54,744 --> 00:26:57,913
Give me three cocktails with at
least three ingredients each.

406
00:26:57,981 --> 00:26:59,849
Peggy Olson,

407
00:26:59,916 --> 00:27:02,852
pioneering the science of wet blanketry.

408
00:27:02,919 --> 00:27:04,720
You love her.

409
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:11,527
Holy Francis calling.

410
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:26,675
- This is Don.
- Hello, Don. Henry Francis.

411
00:27:26,743 --> 00:27:28,077
Sorry to bother you at work.

412
00:27:28,144 --> 00:27:30,112
I assume it's important.

413
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:32,047
It is but not dire.

414
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:37,653
Okay. What can I do for you?

415
00:27:37,721 --> 00:27:40,456
I bought a boat and I...

416
00:27:40,523 --> 00:27:41,924
Well, I'd like to put it in the garage

417
00:27:41,992 --> 00:27:43,826
and I don't have the clearance
with your things there.

418
00:27:44,995 --> 00:27:46,528
No, of course.

419
00:27:46,596 --> 00:27:48,931
I can probably have some movers take them,

420
00:27:48,999 --> 00:27:51,533
put them in storage somewhere.
I can take it off the rent.

421
00:27:51,601 --> 00:27:53,669
No. No, that's okay.

422
00:27:53,737 --> 00:27:55,304
I should probably come and get them myself.

423
00:27:57,507 --> 00:27:59,608
Gene's birthday party's on Sunday.

424
00:28:00,777 --> 00:28:02,144
I know.

425
00:28:02,212 --> 00:28:04,613
So I think Saturday
would be best, don't you?

426
00:28:07,817 --> 00:28:09,985
I see.

427
00:28:10,053 --> 00:28:11,887
The boat's coming next week so...

428
00:28:11,955 --> 00:28:13,656
Fine.

429
00:28:13,723 --> 00:28:15,190
I'll come at noon.

430
00:28:25,802 --> 00:28:27,569
Miss Blankenship, can I get some coffee?

431
00:28:32,487 --> 00:28:34,788
I just lost 30 cents in the machine.

432
00:28:34,856 --> 00:28:36,584
How is that possible?

433
00:28:36,585 --> 00:28:38,552
Well, I wanted a pack of life savers

434
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:40,354
so I put in a nickel and it didn't work.

435
00:28:40,422 --> 00:28:42,523
So I looked in my purse and
all I had was a quarter,

436
00:28:42,591 --> 00:28:43,724
so then I lost a quarter too.

437
00:28:43,792 --> 00:28:45,893
Was the exact-change light on?

438
00:28:45,961 --> 00:28:47,995
I started with the exact change.

439
00:28:48,063 --> 00:28:50,498
Oh, Peggy, it's a nickel.

440
00:28:50,565 --> 00:28:53,334
I'm not calling that number.
No one ever answers.

441
00:28:53,402 --> 00:28:54,935
I can't believe you.

442
00:28:55,003 --> 00:28:57,671
Fine, then give me some life savers.

443
00:29:11,586 --> 00:29:14,922
- Who did that?
- Did what?

444
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:17,425
That pornographic drawing.

445
00:29:17,492 --> 00:29:21,028
It's a very brave person

446
00:29:21,096 --> 00:29:22,763
that does something anonymously.

447
00:29:22,831 --> 00:29:24,565
It's a very brave person who does that.

448
00:29:24,633 --> 00:29:26,767
It's still illegal in many States you know.

449
00:29:33,809 --> 00:29:37,545
I can't wait until next year
when all of you are in Vietnam.

450
00:29:37,612 --> 00:29:39,647
You will be pining for the day

451
00:29:39,714 --> 00:29:41,682
when someone was trying
to make your life easier.

452
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:44,385
And when you're over there,

453
00:29:44,453 --> 00:29:46,987
you're in the jungle and
they're shooting at you,

454
00:29:47,055 --> 00:29:50,758
remember you're not dying for me,
because I never liked you.

455
00:29:57,933 --> 00:30:00,234
- Joan.
- Don't worry. I'm not going home.

456
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:03,971
Jesus. Scorched earth.

457
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:06,207
- What's wrong with her?
- I told you not to do that.

458
00:30:06,274 --> 00:30:08,209
- Come on, Peggy.
- It's a joke.

459
00:30:12,314 --> 00:30:14,348
She's still patting around
for the buzzer. I'm sorry.

460
00:30:14,416 --> 00:30:16,717
What do you want?

461
00:30:20,889 --> 00:30:22,523
Joey taped it to Joan's window.

462
00:30:22,591 --> 00:30:25,993
- Really?
- Yes, and it's disrespectful to Joan

463
00:30:26,061 --> 00:30:27,962
and it's disrespectful to me.

464
00:30:28,029 --> 00:30:30,464
Narrative, forced perspective...
Are you sure Joey did this?

465
00:30:30,532 --> 00:30:33,234
Yes, I told him not to.

466
00:30:33,301 --> 00:30:35,436
Well, I wouldn't tolerate
that if I were you.

467
00:30:35,504 --> 00:30:37,304
But you have no problem with it?

468
00:30:37,372 --> 00:30:39,807
I didn't say that.

469
00:30:39,875 --> 00:30:41,742
Look, Peggy, just go fire him.

470
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:44,078
Me?

471
00:30:44,146 --> 00:30:46,547
I thought you would go out
there and yell at him.

472
00:30:46,615 --> 00:30:48,649
Yell at him, fire him. Look, believe me...

473
00:30:48,717 --> 00:30:50,184
You do not want me involved in this.

474
00:30:50,252 --> 00:30:52,119
People will think you're a tattletale.

475
00:30:52,187 --> 00:30:54,555
Dr. Miller has arrived.

476
00:30:55,757 --> 00:30:57,858
Send her in.

477
00:30:57,926 --> 00:31:01,061
You want some respect?
Go out there and get it for yourself.

478
00:31:02,297 --> 00:31:05,166
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Have a seat.

479
00:31:09,237 --> 00:31:11,305
Is everything all right?

480
00:31:11,373 --> 00:31:12,640
Yes.

481
00:31:17,312 --> 00:31:18,946
Joey, can I speak to you for a minute?

482
00:31:19,014 --> 00:31:20,347
- You want one?
- No.

483
00:31:31,526 --> 00:31:33,160
I'm sorry, okay?

484
00:31:33,228 --> 00:31:36,030
Good. Now go apologize.

485
00:31:36,097 --> 00:31:37,631
What? Then she'll know I did it.

486
00:31:37,699 --> 00:31:39,867
You did do it. I told you not to.

487
00:31:39,935 --> 00:31:41,502
Come on. It's funny.

488
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:43,470
Really? Would you show it to Lane?

489
00:31:43,538 --> 00:31:44,805
He would think it's funny.

490
00:31:44,873 --> 00:31:46,840
What if it were Don on his knees?

491
00:31:47,277 --> 00:31:50,411
See? This is why I don't like working
with women. You have no sense of humor.

492
00:31:51,713 --> 00:31:53,380
You're fired.

493
00:31:55,217 --> 00:31:57,017
All right, all right.
I see the nostrils are flared.

494
00:31:57,085 --> 00:31:59,720
- I'll go apologize.
- No, get your things.

495
00:31:59,788 --> 00:32:01,622
- Are you serious?
- I am.

496
00:32:03,091 --> 00:32:05,025
We'll see what Don has to say about that.

497
00:32:05,093 --> 00:32:06,961
Don doesn't even know who you are.

498
00:32:08,997 --> 00:32:10,998
I'm sorry it didn't work out.

499
00:32:11,066 --> 00:32:13,934
Hang on. Come on. This is crazy.

500
00:32:14,002 --> 00:32:15,869
It's just a job, Joey.
You'll get another one.

501
00:32:22,811 --> 00:32:24,945
Well, I was wrong about you.

502
00:32:39,361 --> 00:32:40,794
What's going on?

503
00:32:40,862 --> 00:32:42,963
Watch out, fellas. The fun's over.

504
00:32:43,031 --> 00:32:45,933
- What?
- That's all, folks.

505
00:32:46,001 --> 00:32:48,435
- Are you serious?
- A little bug bit me.

506
00:32:48,503 --> 00:32:50,471
Well, I'll give you a call.
We'll have a drink.

507
00:32:54,109 --> 00:32:56,577
Stan, throw Vick Chemical
on the back burner.

508
00:32:56,645 --> 00:32:58,445
You're on mountain dew.

509
00:33:03,451 --> 00:33:05,519
You know, these guys may be embarrassed

510
00:33:05,587 --> 00:33:07,988
by having some professional
tell them what to do.

511
00:33:08,056 --> 00:33:10,090
He'll take advice from another man.

512
00:33:10,158 --> 00:33:13,227
Not if he knows more.

513
00:33:13,295 --> 00:33:15,963
You know I'm right about auto parts.
I used to sell cars.

514
00:33:16,031 --> 00:33:18,732
Yes, but we still have to do it.

515
00:33:20,635 --> 00:33:22,436
God, this is boring.

516
00:33:22,504 --> 00:33:26,507
I think I'm hungry. Do you want to eat?

517
00:33:26,574 --> 00:33:29,109
- You mean order in?
- I don't know.

518
00:33:29,177 --> 00:33:30,577
You seem kind of dressed up.

519
00:33:31,946 --> 00:33:33,814
We could take Fillmore
parts with us if you want.

520
00:33:36,052 --> 00:33:40,487
Just to clarify...
You'd like to have dinner with me?

521
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:45,592
Yes.

522
00:33:47,595 --> 00:33:50,130
You asked me out the first
time I came in here.

523
00:33:50,198 --> 00:33:52,466
Why would it be different for me now?

524
00:33:54,569 --> 00:33:56,737
It just felt like the timing is right.

525
00:33:59,874 --> 00:34:01,909
So why don't we do that?

526
00:34:01,976 --> 00:34:03,944
You could ask me out for dinner

527
00:34:04,012 --> 00:34:06,480
at some future date instead of...
I don't know...

528
00:34:06,548 --> 00:34:08,849
Tacking it onto a workday
like an afterthought...

529
00:34:10,819 --> 00:34:12,586
I could do that.

530
00:34:13,988 --> 00:34:15,989
Saturday night far enough in the future?

531
00:34:17,425 --> 00:34:19,693
Not normally, but you're in luck.

532
00:34:20,895 --> 00:34:22,696
Good.

533
00:34:22,764 --> 00:34:24,198
Okay then.

534
00:34:25,934 --> 00:34:27,468
I've got enough to go on here.

535
00:34:27,535 --> 00:34:29,169
Okay.

536
00:34:29,237 --> 00:34:30,804
- Good night.
- Good night.

537
00:34:39,255 --> 00:34:40,522
It's Francine.

538
00:34:40,589 --> 00:34:41,823
Come in.

539
00:34:44,026 --> 00:34:46,528
Whoa. I'm all bitten up.

540
00:34:46,811 --> 00:34:49,413
This is my potato salad bowl,
but this one's yours.

541
00:34:49,481 --> 00:34:51,749
Well, thank you.

542
00:34:51,816 --> 00:34:53,617
Henry was going to pick one
up on his way home from work,

543
00:34:53,685 --> 00:34:55,286
but he's been so busy.

544
00:34:55,353 --> 00:34:57,955
Oh, Betty, he's very ambitious.

545
00:34:59,157 --> 00:35:00,557
He's mad at me.

546
00:35:00,625 --> 00:35:02,426
Why would that be so?

547
00:35:03,795 --> 00:35:06,997
Oh God, if I can make it
through this weekend...

548
00:35:07,065 --> 00:35:08,999
It's a two-year-old's birthday party,

549
00:35:09,067 --> 00:35:12,303
you'll have help, and no one cares.

550
00:35:13,838 --> 00:35:15,205
Oh.

551
00:35:16,574 --> 00:35:18,075
Is he coming?

552
00:35:20,345 --> 00:35:22,346
I told him about it.

553
00:35:22,414 --> 00:35:24,381
Now I can only hope he
won't show up and ruin it.

554
00:35:24,449 --> 00:35:26,216
Well, he won't.

555
00:35:26,284 --> 00:35:28,152
We ran into him in the city...

556
00:35:28,219 --> 00:35:30,254
On a date.

557
00:35:30,322 --> 00:35:33,257
Bethany van Nuys...
She was all of 15.

558
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,528
I misbehaved.

559
00:35:37,595 --> 00:35:40,798
Henry didn't understand it for some reason.

560
00:35:40,865 --> 00:35:43,000
Why do you let him bother you?

561
00:35:43,068 --> 00:35:45,769
We see him walking out with
the kids some weekends.

562
00:35:45,837 --> 00:35:49,206
- Carlton calls him "that sad bastard."
- That's an act.

563
00:35:49,274 --> 00:35:51,675
He's living the life, let me tell you.

564
00:35:51,743 --> 00:35:54,978
He doesn't get to have
this family and that.

565
00:35:55,046 --> 00:35:57,314
Oh, Betty.

566
00:35:57,382 --> 00:35:59,683
You have terrible luck with entertaining.

567
00:36:08,059 --> 00:36:09,460
Just be careful.

568
00:36:09,527 --> 00:36:11,495
Don has nothing to lose,

569
00:36:11,563 --> 00:36:13,497
and you have everything.

570
00:36:30,248 --> 00:36:33,784
I don't know if you heard,
but I fired Joey.

571
00:36:33,852 --> 00:36:37,054
I did. Good for you.

572
00:36:38,957 --> 00:36:40,991
Excuse me?

573
00:36:41,059 --> 00:36:43,193
Now everybody in the office will know

574
00:36:43,261 --> 00:36:44,847
that you solved my problem and that you

575
00:36:44,848 --> 00:36:46,230
must be really important, I guess.

576
00:36:48,466 --> 00:36:51,435
What's wrong with you? I defended you.

577
00:36:51,503 --> 00:36:53,470
You defended yourself.

578
00:36:53,538 --> 00:36:54,972
Fine.

579
00:36:56,641 --> 00:36:58,642
That cartoon was disgusting.

580
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:00,244
I had already handled it

581
00:37:00,311 --> 00:37:02,045
and if I had wanted to go further,

582
00:37:02,113 --> 00:37:04,782
one dinner with Mr. Kreutzer
from Sugarberry ham

583
00:37:04,849 --> 00:37:07,284
and Joey would've been off it
and out of my hair.

584
00:37:07,352 --> 00:37:09,553
So? It's the same result.

585
00:37:10,922 --> 00:37:12,723
You want to be a big shot.

586
00:37:12,791 --> 00:37:16,093
Well, no matter how powerful
we get around here,

587
00:37:16,161 --> 00:37:18,562
they can still just draw a cartoon.

588
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:20,554
So all you've done is proved to them

589
00:37:20,555 --> 00:37:25,266
that I'm a meaningless secretary
and you're another humorless bitch.

590
00:37:28,139 --> 00:37:30,774
Have a nice weekend. Good night, Peggy.

591
00:37:39,684 --> 00:37:41,618
When a man walks into a room,

592
00:37:41,686 --> 00:37:43,787
he brings his whole life with him.

593
00:37:54,232 --> 00:37:56,733
He has a million reasons
for being anywhere.

594
00:37:56,801 --> 00:37:58,402
Just ask him.

595
00:38:03,074 --> 00:38:05,642
If you listen, he'll tell you
how he got there,

596
00:38:10,715 --> 00:38:12,749
how he forgot where he was going

597
00:38:12,817 --> 00:38:14,952
and then he woke up.

598
00:38:17,188 --> 00:38:20,090
If you listen, he'll tell you

599
00:38:20,158 --> 00:38:22,025
about the time he thought he was an angel

600
00:38:23,695 --> 00:38:25,429
or dreamt of being perfect.

601
00:38:28,733 --> 00:38:31,235
And then he'll smile with wisdom,

602
00:38:31,302 --> 00:38:32,970
content that he'd realized

603
00:38:33,037 --> 00:38:35,072
the world isn't perfect.

604
00:38:38,643 --> 00:38:42,012
We're flawed because we want so much more.

605
00:38:58,596 --> 00:39:00,564
We're ruined

606
00:39:00,632 --> 00:39:02,299
because we get these things

607
00:39:02,367 --> 00:39:04,434
and wish for what we had.

608
00:39:17,315 --> 00:39:20,284
- You smell nice.
- So do you,

609
00:39:20,351 --> 00:39:23,153
like chlorine.

610
00:39:23,221 --> 00:39:25,656
I've been swimming.

611
00:39:25,723 --> 00:39:27,391
Does it feel like summer?

612
00:39:27,458 --> 00:39:29,826
It clears my head.

613
00:39:29,894 --> 00:39:33,130
- For the creative process?
- For something.

614
00:39:34,499 --> 00:39:36,967
I've been a little out of sorts lately.

615
00:39:39,704 --> 00:39:41,672
It's an effort to get in the water,

616
00:39:41,739 --> 00:39:44,074
but when you do you're weightless
and you don't even sweat.

617
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:47,144
And in the end,

618
00:39:47,211 --> 00:39:49,179
you're wrung out.

619
00:39:52,817 --> 00:39:55,819
I've been looking forward to this.

620
00:39:55,887 --> 00:39:58,088
It's very hard to get a reservation here.

621
00:39:58,156 --> 00:40:02,626
You should've called me. I know a guy.

622
00:40:02,694 --> 00:40:04,628
Really?

623
00:40:04,696 --> 00:40:06,630
Who's your guy?

624
00:40:06,698 --> 00:40:08,398
My father.

625
00:40:10,234 --> 00:40:13,270
A lot of people who supply restaurants

626
00:40:13,338 --> 00:40:15,339
know a lot of the same
people who know my father.

627
00:40:17,775 --> 00:40:19,242
Like...?

628
00:40:20,545 --> 00:40:23,113
Not my father, just his friends.

629
00:40:23,181 --> 00:40:24,915
He owns a candy store

630
00:40:26,784 --> 00:40:29,252
and there are certain responsibilities

631
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,355
that go along with that.

632
00:40:31,422 --> 00:40:33,523
Interesting.

633
00:40:35,093 --> 00:40:36,393
What's he like?

634
00:40:38,229 --> 00:40:41,331
He's a handsome two-bit gangster like you.

635
00:40:44,068 --> 00:40:45,702
Two glasses of chianti.

636
00:40:51,376 --> 00:40:54,544
When I'm out of sorts,
I look at the calendar.

637
00:40:54,612 --> 00:40:58,148
There's usually something
significant on the horizon.

638
00:41:00,251 --> 00:41:02,352
I never noticed that.

639
00:41:06,357 --> 00:41:08,291
It's my two-year-old's birthday,

640
00:41:09,861 --> 00:41:11,361
but I'm not going.

641
00:41:13,331 --> 00:41:14,865
Why not?

642
00:41:16,701 --> 00:41:18,669
Because I'm not welcome there.

643
00:41:20,605 --> 00:41:23,240
He thinks that man's his father.

644
00:41:26,477 --> 00:41:27,844
Maybe that's okay.

645
00:41:29,147 --> 00:41:30,580
All he knows of the world

646
00:41:30,648 --> 00:41:32,082
is what you show him.

647
00:41:47,598 --> 00:41:49,399
Oh, that's nice.

648
00:41:58,576 --> 00:42:01,211
I know I've sometimes
behaved to the contrary,

649
00:42:01,279 --> 00:42:03,180
but I do admire your work.

650
00:42:03,247 --> 00:42:05,515
That's nice to hear.

651
00:42:05,583 --> 00:42:08,852
So tell me a trade secret.

652
00:42:10,588 --> 00:42:12,589
How do you get them to do
what you want them to do?

653
00:42:16,227 --> 00:42:18,929
Aesop has a fable about
the wind and the sun.

654
00:42:20,364 --> 00:42:23,233
The wind and the sun had this competition

655
00:42:23,301 --> 00:42:25,268
to see if they could get
a traveler's coat off.

656
00:42:25,336 --> 00:42:28,538
So the wind blows fiercely on him,

657
00:42:28,606 --> 00:42:32,142
but the traveler just
pulls his coat tighter.

658
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:34,811
But the sun shines down on him,

659
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:36,613
warmer and warmer,

660
00:42:36,681 --> 00:42:39,216
and the traveler just

661
00:42:39,283 --> 00:42:40,817
takes it off.

662
00:42:42,086 --> 00:42:43,820
And the moral is?

663
00:42:45,456 --> 00:42:48,825
Kindness, gentleness and persuasion win

664
00:42:48,893 --> 00:42:50,794
where force fails.

665
00:42:52,864 --> 00:42:55,899
You know, Aesop did that
in probably 10 lines.

666
00:42:55,967 --> 00:42:58,802
He's very economical.

667
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:01,104
So what you're saying is you want my coat.

668
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:21,825
72nd and Broadway.

669
00:43:21,893 --> 00:43:23,527
Thank you.

670
00:43:53,524 --> 00:43:55,258
Where do you live?

671
00:43:55,326 --> 00:43:57,360
Only around the corner.

672
00:43:57,428 --> 00:43:59,229
Really?

673
00:44:01,432 --> 00:44:02,732
Yes.

674
00:44:04,268 --> 00:44:06,169
But I'm just going
to take you to your door.

675
00:44:09,006 --> 00:44:11,107
And why is that?

676
00:44:14,512 --> 00:44:16,780
Because that's as far as I can go right now

677
00:44:18,182 --> 00:44:19,549
and I'm not ready to say good night.

678
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,654
That's not what I expected.

679
00:45:39,497 --> 00:45:41,831
- Hello, Francine.
- Hello, Don.

680
00:45:41,899 --> 00:45:42,899
Daddy!

681
00:45:46,604 --> 00:45:48,772
What's he doing here?

682
00:45:49,941 --> 00:45:51,174
It's okay.

683
00:46:01,419 --> 00:46:03,820
Here you go. Say hi to daddy.

684
00:46:03,888 --> 00:46:05,488
Happy Birthday.

685
00:46:11,362 --> 00:46:13,229
We have everything.

686
