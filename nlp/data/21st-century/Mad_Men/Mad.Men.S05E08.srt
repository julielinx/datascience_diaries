1
00:00:00,552 --> 00:00:01,904
Previously on Mad Men...

2
00:00:01,996 --> 00:00:04,009
Don and Megan sold Heinz
last night over dinner.

3
00:00:04,551 --> 00:00:05,530
Way to go!

4
00:00:05,658 --> 00:00:06,814
You should be shaking her hand.

5
00:00:07,683 --> 00:00:08,984
It's just beginner's luck.

6
00:00:09,108 --> 00:00:10,788
Mr. Sterling will be handling
the day to day,

7
00:00:10,909 --> 00:00:13,370
but everything he knows,
I'll know.

8
00:00:15,605 --> 00:00:18,390
Do you know you're
good at all of it?

9
00:00:18,817 --> 00:00:20,457
I have nothing, Don.

10
00:00:21,384 --> 00:00:23,777
Megan!
Congratulations!

11
00:00:24,799 --> 00:00:28,701
There's a point when you go from
going home on the 5:25 to the 7:05.

12
00:01:12,486 --> 00:01:14,854
I didn't want
to play cards anyway.

13
00:01:14,888 --> 00:01:18,257
I was supposed to talk to
Dunphy, but he's sick again.

14
00:01:18,291 --> 00:01:20,192
You know, the other top
salesman in my department,

15
00:01:20,226 --> 00:01:22,261
he reads all day long

16
00:01:22,295 --> 00:01:25,264
and I'm out here on
the train hustling people.

17
00:01:25,298 --> 00:01:28,700
I'm really having a lean month.

18
00:01:29,836 --> 00:01:33,805
Okay, Howard, I knew
this day would come.

19
00:01:35,074 --> 00:01:37,275
Look, I already have
life insurance.

20
00:01:37,309 --> 00:01:39,243
It came with
my junior partnership.

21
00:01:39,278 --> 00:01:40,878
And it's six times
my annual salary,

22
00:01:40,912 --> 00:01:42,646
and after two years,
it covers suicide.

23
00:01:42,681 --> 00:01:44,382
So make your pitch brief.

24
00:01:44,416 --> 00:01:46,451
Are you kidding me?

25
00:01:46,485 --> 00:01:48,586
What?

26
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,520
Look, I wasn't gonna
put the arm into you,

27
00:01:50,554 --> 00:01:52,555
but you have a kid.

28
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:55,692
I guarantee you that policy
pays the company and not you.

29
00:01:55,726 --> 00:01:57,760
Imagine everything you have
just stopped short

30
00:01:57,795 --> 00:01:59,329
the minute they put you
in the ground.

31
00:01:59,364 --> 00:02:01,298
I don't think
you're right about that.

32
00:02:01,332 --> 00:02:02,932
Oh, I'm positive.

33
00:02:04,702 --> 00:02:06,435
Forget it.

34
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:09,005
I'll leave that to you
and your sleepless nights.

35
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:11,573
I'm surprised
you're not doing better.

36
00:02:13,377 --> 00:02:15,644
- You like my new tie?
- Yes.

37
00:02:15,678 --> 00:02:17,713
You know what a new tie means?

38
00:02:17,747 --> 00:02:21,450
It means I have a spectacular
new side dish in the city.

39
00:02:21,485 --> 00:02:24,752
Strawberry blonde.
Tiny thing with huge tits.

40
00:02:24,786 --> 00:02:28,390
24th floor, 24 years old.

41
00:02:28,424 --> 00:02:30,091
I got an apartment.

42
00:02:30,126 --> 00:02:31,893
What's your wife say?

43
00:02:31,927 --> 00:02:33,861
She's happy because
I provide for her.

44
00:02:33,896 --> 00:02:35,796
She's not worried about
what might happen to her

45
00:02:35,831 --> 00:02:37,365
if something happens to me.

46
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,599
Aren't you worried
you're going to get caught?

47
00:02:41,336 --> 00:02:42,869
I'll be right back.

48
00:02:51,646 --> 00:02:54,947
<i>I have a Jack shapiro calling for you.</i>

49
00:02:54,981 --> 00:02:57,716
<i>Well, for Megan Calvet.</i>

50
00:03:02,022 --> 00:03:03,489
Thank you so much, Dawn.

51
00:03:11,497 --> 00:03:13,932
So shot for shot,
it's "A hard day's night"

52
00:03:16,202 --> 00:03:18,437
until our mop-top
in the white leather jacket

53
00:03:18,471 --> 00:03:20,772
ducks into
the Chevalier Blanc Pub.

54
00:03:20,806 --> 00:03:22,307
Notice the white chess piece.

55
00:03:22,341 --> 00:03:25,210
Then we're inside
and we're in color,

56
00:03:25,244 --> 00:03:27,445
<i>but there's even more girls.</i>

57
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:29,813
The music cuts
and they stare at him

58
00:03:29,847 --> 00:03:32,216
like at the end of The Birds.

59
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:35,152
"You may have second thoughts
about wearing Chevalier Blanc.

60
00:03:35,187 --> 00:03:37,088
It's more trouble
than it's worth."

61
00:03:53,437 --> 00:03:55,472
So we've been looking
for a piece of music.

62
00:03:55,506 --> 00:03:58,440
It really has to have that
sound that the movie has.

63
00:03:58,475 --> 00:03:59,908
Well, that sound
is The Beatles,

64
00:03:59,942 --> 00:04:01,376
who you said
are impossible to get.

65
00:04:01,411 --> 00:04:02,711
Oh, don't worry.

66
00:04:02,745 --> 00:04:04,213
There's a million bands
that sound like that.

67
00:04:04,247 --> 00:04:05,514
Or we'll make our own.

68
00:04:05,548 --> 00:04:08,083
All we want is the
chaos and the fun,

69
00:04:08,118 --> 00:04:10,919
that sort of, um,
adolescent joy.

70
00:04:10,953 --> 00:04:12,654
We know what
The Beatles sound like.

71
00:04:12,688 --> 00:04:14,655
We'll do our best.

72
00:04:14,689 --> 00:04:16,056
Great.

73
00:04:16,091 --> 00:04:18,659
Well, we'll get back to you
on that and the schedule.

74
00:04:18,693 --> 00:04:21,229
Great seeing you both.

75
00:04:21,263 --> 00:04:22,997
You, too.

76
00:04:26,901 --> 00:04:28,869
Make sure in the casting

77
00:04:28,903 --> 00:04:31,938
that this guy is more
like Calvin than Rick.

78
00:04:31,972 --> 00:04:34,774
Usually you have to go to one
of your finer men's rooms

79
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:37,010
to find a man like Rick.

80
00:04:37,044 --> 00:04:39,246
So nothing about the applause?

81
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,181
It was their idea.

82
00:04:41,215 --> 00:04:42,682
Now what about the song?

83
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:44,184
Like I said,
there's a million of them.

84
00:04:44,218 --> 00:04:46,585
Herman's Hermits,
Chad & Jeremy,

85
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,354
The Merseybeats, The Zombies.

86
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:50,956
Eh, you really think The Zombies are right?
It's gotta be right.

87
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:55,060
You know what--
I'll ask Megan. She'll know.

88
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,731
You wanted to see me?

89
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:02,067
See anything you like?

90
00:05:03,735 --> 00:05:06,638
- Are you asking if I ski?
- <i>No.</i>

91
00:05:06,672 --> 00:05:08,406
I want to know
which skis you want.

92
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,907
Or take them both.

93
00:05:09,941 --> 00:05:12,410
Do they explode or something?

94
00:05:12,444 --> 00:05:14,546
Yes, Allen Funt sent them over.

95
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,381
Do you want them or not?
Because they want you.

96
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:19,583
- The skis do?
- Roger O'Hara took it upon himself

97
00:05:19,617 --> 00:05:21,918
as head of the head ski company

98
00:05:21,952 --> 00:05:24,888
to demand your handling
of his account over my lunch.

99
00:05:24,922 --> 00:05:28,559
- Really? - Yes. You're making
quite a name for yourself.

100
00:05:29,894 --> 00:05:31,562
Why are you telling me this?

101
00:05:31,596 --> 00:05:33,263
Relax. It's good.

102
00:05:33,298 --> 00:05:34,963
<i>It's what</i>
<i>I've always wanted--</i>

103
00:05:34,998 --> 00:05:37,066
Sit back, let the business
roll in while you pass the jug

104
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,768
with some schmoe from
Lutherville, Maryland.

105
00:05:39,803 --> 00:05:41,103
Huh.

106
00:05:41,137 --> 00:05:43,372
Go on, take them.

107
00:05:43,407 --> 00:05:45,274
Yes.

108
00:05:45,309 --> 00:05:47,943
I suppose I will.

109
00:06:00,989 --> 00:06:02,857
And I got to see that.

110
00:06:05,894 --> 00:06:08,629
Where have you been hiding all day?
I was about to leave.

111
00:06:08,663 --> 00:06:11,365
I've been working.
I thought you were, too.

112
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:12,733
Nope.

113
00:06:14,001 --> 00:06:16,470
Why don't you come with me,

114
00:06:16,504 --> 00:06:18,439
dress up another
drab client dinner?

115
00:06:18,473 --> 00:06:20,774
- Don--
- Hey, let me ask you something--

116
00:06:20,808 --> 00:06:23,276
When did music
become so important?

117
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,910
It's always been important.

118
00:06:24,945 --> 00:06:26,879
I mean jingles, yeah.

119
00:06:26,913 --> 00:06:30,650
But now everybody keeps coming
in, looking for some song.

120
00:06:30,684 --> 00:06:32,285
And they're so specific.

121
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:33,986
You love specific.

122
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,021
But I have no idea what's
going on out there.

123
00:06:36,056 --> 00:06:39,057
Well, no one can keep up.
It's always changing.

124
00:06:40,593 --> 00:06:42,093
We're going
to Danny's Hideaway.

125
00:06:42,128 --> 00:06:44,529
You have to go
and I have to work.

126
00:06:50,503 --> 00:06:53,171
See you at home?

127
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:54,838
I promise.

128
00:07:11,656 --> 00:07:13,523
You're leaving late.

129
00:07:13,557 --> 00:07:14,991
Is it snowing out there?

130
00:07:15,025 --> 00:07:17,827
No. Sporting goods
account.

131
00:07:17,861 --> 00:07:20,129
And they're already giving us presents.
That's good.

132
00:07:20,164 --> 00:07:22,599
They're giving me presents
and I've never even met them.

133
00:07:22,633 --> 00:07:25,602
Are you a really good skier?
Like famous?

134
00:07:25,636 --> 00:07:29,104
Heh.
Well, good night.

135
00:07:39,349 --> 00:07:41,016
I thought we were working.

136
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:43,584
Don just called.
I have to meet him for dinner.

137
00:07:43,619 --> 00:07:45,787
Nothing I can do
about that, I guess.

138
00:07:45,821 --> 00:07:47,888
You can go home, too.

139
00:07:47,923 --> 00:07:50,558
I don't know.
They're not right.

140
00:07:50,592 --> 00:07:53,093
They're exactly
as you dictated them to me.

141
00:07:53,128 --> 00:07:55,196
They're exactly like
they're supposed to be,

142
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:57,765
but they're not <i>it.</i>

143
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,766
Maybe they are.

144
00:08:00,868 --> 00:08:02,703
Go ahead.

145
00:08:02,737 --> 00:08:05,038
Thanks.
Good night.

146
00:08:10,445 --> 00:08:12,813
- I'm sorry.
- Excuse me?

147
00:08:12,847 --> 00:08:15,581
You didn't happen to see
Howard Dawes on the train?

148
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:17,316
Are you Beth?

149
00:08:17,351 --> 00:08:19,151
Um, yes.

150
00:08:19,185 --> 00:08:21,487
He talks about you often.

151
00:08:21,521 --> 00:08:24,957
I'm sorry, he doesn't
talk about anyone to me.

152
00:08:24,991 --> 00:08:27,893
Peter Campbell.

153
00:08:27,927 --> 00:08:29,595
We should switch cars.

154
00:08:29,629 --> 00:08:31,429
I don't know how I'm gonna
get these in there.

155
00:08:31,464 --> 00:08:33,832
Except I locked my keys inside.

156
00:08:33,866 --> 00:08:35,367
He should have been home by now

157
00:08:35,401 --> 00:08:37,635
and I'm afraid maybe he
fell asleep on the train.

158
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:39,337
He's done that before.

159
00:08:39,372 --> 00:08:42,006
Oh, uh, now that I think of it,

160
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,476
I saw some fellow corner him
in the oyster bar.

161
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:45,943
He may be a while.

162
00:08:45,978 --> 00:08:48,445
I can notify a Locksmith
for the car and the house.

163
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,314
Can you just drive me home?

164
00:08:51,349 --> 00:08:53,751
The house is open.
I'll deal with this in the morning.

165
00:08:58,055 --> 00:09:00,591
Next time we turn,
I'll warn you.

166
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:03,426
When's the next train?

167
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:07,029
You know what?
I'll give you my number.

168
00:09:07,063 --> 00:09:08,564
And when Howard calls
from the station,

169
00:09:08,599 --> 00:09:10,065
I'll shuttle him home.

170
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,469
He' not coming home.
He's staying in the city.

171
00:09:13,504 --> 00:09:15,304
We got an apartment.

172
00:09:15,338 --> 00:09:17,273
"We."

173
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:18,840
<i>Oh.</i>

174
00:09:23,579 --> 00:09:26,214
You're enough of a stranger that
I've never heard your name,

175
00:09:26,248 --> 00:09:28,950
yet you know where he is
and I don't.

176
00:09:28,984 --> 00:09:31,019
I don't know anything.

177
00:09:32,354 --> 00:09:34,088
Did you know
that was a stop sign?

178
00:09:34,123 --> 00:09:35,989
You're an awful driver.

179
00:09:36,024 --> 00:09:37,491
Are you from Manhattan?

180
00:09:37,526 --> 00:09:40,528
Yes.
And I just learned.

181
00:09:42,096 --> 00:09:43,898
I could never live in the city.

182
00:09:43,932 --> 00:09:45,499
What's wrong with it?

183
00:09:45,534 --> 00:09:50,070
Well, I love it, but all the
hobos and the panhandlers...

184
00:09:50,104 --> 00:09:51,704
There aren't that many.

185
00:09:51,739 --> 00:09:54,073
Well, they always accost me.

186
00:09:54,107 --> 00:09:56,576
I think it's because
I make eye contact.

187
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:58,244
And then I always
give them money

188
00:09:58,278 --> 00:10:00,647
and I can't stop thinking about
them for the rest of the day...

189
00:10:01,816 --> 00:10:06,185
Wandering around,
sleeping in doorways.

190
00:10:07,854 --> 00:10:10,021
When I was little,
I tried to make my father

191
00:10:10,056 --> 00:10:11,723
<i>give one money and he wouldn't.</i>

192
00:10:11,758 --> 00:10:15,527
He said, "We couldn't
take care of everybody."

193
00:10:15,562 --> 00:10:18,863
I guess we're supposed to
get used to not seeing them.

194
00:10:18,897 --> 00:10:21,732
Yes.

195
00:10:21,767 --> 00:10:24,869
That's exactly what happens.

196
00:10:25,871 --> 00:10:29,406
Hello?

197
00:10:29,441 --> 00:10:32,609
- It's me. Is Megan there?
- Isn't she with you?

198
00:10:32,643 --> 00:10:36,145
Yes, we're
playing a hilarious joke on you.

199
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,682
She left a while ago
to meet you at the restaurant.

200
00:10:38,716 --> 00:10:40,484
<i>When?</i>

201
00:10:40,518 --> 00:10:42,218
I don't know--
after you called.

202
00:10:42,252 --> 00:10:44,821
I didn't call.

203
00:10:44,856 --> 00:10:46,823
Oh.

204
00:10:46,858 --> 00:10:48,491
She must be at home.

205
00:10:48,525 --> 00:10:50,025
I'm at home.

206
00:10:51,561 --> 00:10:53,362
Maybe she went
to the restaurant

207
00:10:53,396 --> 00:10:55,163
and missed you
and now she's on her way home.

208
00:10:55,198 --> 00:10:57,165
I don't know where she is.
Do you know where Abe is?

209
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,167
Goodbye, Peggy.

210
00:11:07,009 --> 00:11:08,643
It's a lovely house.

211
00:11:09,912 --> 00:11:12,446
Is it harder to lie to me
now that you know me?

212
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:16,450
Howard is working,
I'm sure of it.

213
00:11:18,186 --> 00:11:21,989
I don't even think he'd care
if I was alive or dead.

214
00:11:37,404 --> 00:11:39,705
I'm sorry, but you're
being very dramatic.

215
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,274
You drove me home.
Now leave me alone.

216
00:11:42,308 --> 00:11:44,610
I'm not leaving until I'm sure

217
00:11:44,645 --> 00:11:47,179
you're not hysterical.

218
00:11:52,352 --> 00:11:54,118
You don't know
what you're doing.

219
00:11:54,153 --> 00:11:56,755
You just want
to get back at him.

220
00:12:02,995 --> 00:12:06,130
Don't you want me?

221
00:12:06,165 --> 00:12:07,966
You can have me.

222
00:12:10,301 --> 00:12:12,903
Are you really worried
that Howard's coming home?

223
00:12:44,701 --> 00:12:46,401
<i>Hello?</i>

224
00:12:46,435 --> 00:12:49,471
Hello? Peggy?

225
00:12:49,505 --> 00:12:51,473
Pizza House.

226
00:13:20,434 --> 00:13:22,936
I used to be like this.

227
00:13:24,204 --> 00:13:25,705
What do you mean?

228
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:29,341
Just reckless.

229
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:39,484
I can't believe that happened.

230
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:45,089
Say something.

231
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,092
I've had men paying
attention to me

232
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:50,762
since before
it was appropriate.

233
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:53,264
They don't care what I say.

234
00:13:53,298 --> 00:13:55,933
They just watch my lips move.

235
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:59,771
I'm listening
to every word you say.

236
00:14:01,505 --> 00:14:04,741
Your irises
are so blue and round.

237
00:14:06,644 --> 00:14:09,046
Have you seen those pictures
of the earth from space?

238
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,581
I have.

239
00:14:11,615 --> 00:14:13,984
I'll take that as a compliment.

240
00:14:14,018 --> 00:14:18,788
It didn't bother you to see the
earth tiny and unprotected,

241
00:14:18,822 --> 00:14:21,757
surrounded by darkness?

242
00:14:21,792 --> 00:14:23,759
So you don't like my eyes?

243
00:14:26,163 --> 00:14:28,297
This can never happen again.

244
00:14:28,331 --> 00:14:29,899
What?

245
00:14:29,933 --> 00:14:32,101
No, of course. I--

246
00:14:36,405 --> 00:14:38,606
No, I mean it.

247
00:14:40,142 --> 00:14:43,511
- Okay.
- You should get home.

248
00:14:53,855 --> 00:14:55,555
I don't want to leave you here.

249
00:14:56,825 --> 00:15:00,327
Why not?
I'm fine now.

250
00:15:00,361 --> 00:15:02,963
I'm going to have a
snack and go to bed.

251
00:15:02,997 --> 00:15:05,564
I don't want to leave you.

252
00:15:05,599 --> 00:15:08,134
Thank you for the ride home.

253
00:15:33,993 --> 00:15:36,128
- Hello.
- Hi.

254
00:15:37,295 --> 00:15:38,729
Where were you?

255
00:15:38,764 --> 00:15:41,598
Peggy said I called you and
you were going to meet me?

256
00:15:41,633 --> 00:15:44,635
Oh, I went out for a drink
with Joey and Troy.

257
00:15:44,669 --> 00:15:46,436
Had to lie to Peggy
to get out of there.

258
00:15:46,471 --> 00:15:48,572
I've done that.

259
00:15:50,142 --> 00:15:52,643
I'm hungry. I'm going to get
some crackers or something.

260
00:15:52,677 --> 00:15:55,444
- You want anything?
- No.

261
00:16:05,011 --> 00:16:06,979
- Good morning.
- Morning.

262
00:16:31,269 --> 00:16:33,937
I'm sorry.
I had no idea he was gonna call.

263
00:16:33,972 --> 00:16:35,405
It's not what you think.

264
00:16:35,439 --> 00:16:37,908
Don't put me
in that position again.

265
00:16:37,942 --> 00:16:39,610
I cannot lie to him.

266
00:16:39,644 --> 00:16:42,579
- I lost a night's work. I couldn't sleep--
- Would you stop?

267
00:16:42,614 --> 00:16:46,016
A friend of mine knows somebody doing
an off-off-Broadway show.

268
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:47,817
I read on the weekend

269
00:16:47,851 --> 00:16:49,318
and then I got
a callback last night

270
00:16:49,352 --> 00:16:50,887
and I didn't want to miss it.

271
00:16:50,921 --> 00:16:54,089
But I didn't get it,
so that's it; it's done.

272
00:16:54,124 --> 00:16:56,291
Why can't you tell Don?

273
00:16:56,326 --> 00:16:58,693
Tell Don I still want
to be an actress?

274
00:16:58,728 --> 00:17:00,429
Do you?

275
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,835
I know copywriting's hard,

276
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:09,604
but you're doing great.

277
00:17:09,639 --> 00:17:11,539
You shouldn't give up.

278
00:17:11,573 --> 00:17:14,742
I wouldn't tell you this if I
didn't think you had talent.

279
00:17:16,645 --> 00:17:19,547
The other day they asked me to take
Stan's originals down to the printer,

280
00:17:19,581 --> 00:17:21,782
and I thought all I have to do

281
00:17:21,816 --> 00:17:24,585
is throw these in the trash
and they'll fire me

282
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:26,521
or at least they'd yell at me

283
00:17:26,555 --> 00:17:29,923
and I could
cry enough and quit.

284
00:17:29,957 --> 00:17:34,361
And then I realized
they'll never fire me.

285
00:17:35,696 --> 00:17:37,230
You want to quit?

286
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:40,633
I don't know.
What do I do?

287
00:17:40,668 --> 00:17:44,170
You know there are people
killing to get this job.

288
00:17:44,204 --> 00:17:46,605
You're taking up a spot and
you don't even wanna do it?

289
00:17:46,639 --> 00:17:48,907
I'm sorry I told you.

290
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:51,677
You didn't.
I caught you.

291
00:17:51,711 --> 00:17:53,312
And then you act
like you want advice,

292
00:17:53,346 --> 00:17:55,114
but you've obviously
already made up your mind.

293
00:17:55,148 --> 00:17:58,016
Because he's so easy
to talk to?

294
00:17:58,051 --> 00:18:00,918
Well, you can't
keep lying to him.

295
00:18:02,955 --> 00:18:06,157
It's so simple when it's
someone else's life, isn't it?

296
00:18:07,993 --> 00:18:11,629
You're right.
I don't care what you do.

297
00:18:19,637 --> 00:18:23,039
Phil Beachum is not just the
boss, he's the head of desserts.

298
00:18:23,074 --> 00:18:25,842
Head of desserts?
Please tell me he's 300 pounds.

299
00:18:28,246 --> 00:18:30,880
He's big, just not
as big as you'd like.

300
00:18:30,915 --> 00:18:33,749
Anyway, pat Wallace loved
the way you and Megan--

301
00:18:33,783 --> 00:18:35,218
You know, your banter.

302
00:18:35,252 --> 00:18:37,686
- Dawn, where's Megan?
- She's not coming.

303
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:42,825
I'm sorry.

304
00:18:42,859 --> 00:18:44,994
<i>I was just
saying how Pat Wallace</i>

305
00:18:45,028 --> 00:18:46,362
<i>loved the Mr.</i>
<i>And Mrs. Draper bit.</i>

306
00:18:46,396 --> 00:18:48,163
And you're gonna go
to the test kitchen,

307
00:18:48,197 --> 00:18:50,798
taste a couple of different
formulations of Cool Whip,

308
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:53,335
and maybe put on
a little show to his boss,

309
00:18:53,369 --> 00:18:54,802
you know, as a courtesy.

310
00:18:54,837 --> 00:18:57,339
So, Don, if you could
bring everybody up to speed.

311
00:18:57,373 --> 00:19:00,475
Well, I don't know what anybody
knows about Cool Whip.

312
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:02,544
I read a 30-page dossier

313
00:19:02,578 --> 00:19:05,045
that fails to use the words
"fake whipped cream."

314
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:07,981
Because it's a nondairy
whipped topping

315
00:19:08,016 --> 00:19:11,152
that comes frozen and then
melts into this miracle.

316
00:19:11,186 --> 00:19:12,486
Just do the bit.

317
00:19:14,722 --> 00:19:16,357
Okay.

318
00:19:20,093 --> 00:19:22,629
Honey, I don't even
think I want dessert.

319
00:19:22,663 --> 00:19:24,497
- You love dessert.
- You love dessert

320
00:19:24,532 --> 00:19:26,799
and you just want me to have
some so you can have some.

321
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,368
I made two.

322
00:19:28,402 --> 00:19:30,870
<i>- What is it?</i>
<i>- It's Cool Whip.</i>

323
00:19:30,904 --> 00:19:32,605
<i>- It looks like whipped cream.</i>
<i>- Just taste it.</i>

324
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,474
- Is it a topping? - Well, you can
have it on ice cream like this

325
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:37,509
on fruit or cake

326
00:19:37,544 --> 00:19:40,479
or just by itself.

327
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:42,447
- Just taste it.
- So it's a dessert?

328
00:19:42,482 --> 00:19:43,882
- Just taste it.
- Is it sweet?

329
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:46,185
Just taste it.

330
00:19:46,219 --> 00:19:47,919
That's it.
That's the line-- "Just taste it."

331
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:49,721
People are gonna be
yelling it at the TV set.

332
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:51,722
- It's adorable, right?
- It's a nice twist

333
00:19:51,756 --> 00:19:53,224
on the stupid husband
and pushy wife

334
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:54,725
because they actually
like each other.

335
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:57,295
Are you going to be in the ads?

336
00:19:57,329 --> 00:20:00,665
No. I tried.
They're not interested.

337
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:03,267
Cool Whip's not interested
or Don and Megan aren't interested?

338
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:04,702
We're not interested.

339
00:20:08,206 --> 00:20:11,007
- Don't you like it?
- No, I do.

340
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:12,875
Just absorbing it.

341
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,553
<i>Hello?</i>

342
00:20:24,588 --> 00:20:26,088
Beth?

343
00:20:27,824 --> 00:20:29,391
It's Peter.

344
00:20:29,426 --> 00:20:31,560
I know who it is.

345
00:20:31,595 --> 00:20:34,162
I want you to get on a train
and meet me in the city.

346
00:20:34,197 --> 00:20:36,465
- Anywhere.
- No.

347
00:20:36,499 --> 00:20:39,234
- Okay.
- Just a minute.

348
00:20:41,437 --> 00:20:43,271
What do you want?

349
00:20:43,305 --> 00:20:45,139
Nothing.
You came over to me.

350
00:20:45,173 --> 00:20:47,141
You opened the door.

351
00:20:50,812 --> 00:20:52,347
Are you still there?

352
00:20:52,381 --> 00:20:54,081
Was your secretary on the line?

353
00:20:54,116 --> 00:20:56,717
No.
I'm at a pay phone.

354
00:20:56,751 --> 00:20:59,185
You're taking away
all my fears.

355
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,987
I mean, suddenly I don't
think about the fact

356
00:21:01,021 --> 00:21:03,423
that you ride with my husband

357
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:06,293
<i>on the train twice a day and
that you live 20 minutes away</i>

358
00:21:06,327 --> 00:21:09,162
and I'd see your wife
at the market, if I ever went.

359
00:21:10,398 --> 00:21:12,798
I know, I know.

360
00:21:14,033 --> 00:21:15,635
Are you sorry I called?

361
00:21:15,669 --> 00:21:19,505
Just... stop.

362
00:21:19,539 --> 00:21:21,907
Enjoy the memory.
Leave it alone.

363
00:21:21,941 --> 00:21:25,043
I mean, fantasize about it.
I will, too.

364
00:21:25,078 --> 00:21:29,148
But... don't call me again.

365
00:21:52,155 --> 00:21:53,655
Don.

366
00:21:54,924 --> 00:21:56,491
Don.

367
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,861
What's the matter?

368
00:21:59,896 --> 00:22:02,597
I have to talk to you.

369
00:22:06,736 --> 00:22:08,202
What's wrong?

370
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:13,173
I, uh-- I lied
to you last night.

371
00:22:16,545 --> 00:22:18,211
Okay.

372
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:25,752
I told you that I went
for a drink, but I didn't.

373
00:22:25,786 --> 00:22:28,688
I had a callback for a play.

374
00:22:29,857 --> 00:22:31,691
Okay. So?

375
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:34,393
I feel really bad
about lying to you.

376
00:22:34,428 --> 00:22:36,729
And now you're telling me.

377
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:43,101
- You do that a lot?
- Audition?

378
00:22:43,135 --> 00:22:45,537
- No, lie to me.
- No.

379
00:22:46,639 --> 00:22:49,407
- Did you get it?
- What?

380
00:22:49,442 --> 00:22:52,778
No. No, I didn't.

381
00:22:52,812 --> 00:22:55,981
But it was incredible, Don.

382
00:22:56,015 --> 00:22:58,683
I think I was pretty close.

383
00:22:58,717 --> 00:23:00,751
My heart was racing.

384
00:23:00,786 --> 00:23:02,386
I mean, I'm rusty.

385
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:04,721
I need to go back to class,

386
00:23:04,755 --> 00:23:07,557
but I realized something.

387
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:12,261
- What?
- I miss acting.

388
00:23:12,296 --> 00:23:14,430
I think I gave up too easy

389
00:23:14,465 --> 00:23:18,301
and I don't even know
how I stopped.

390
00:23:18,335 --> 00:23:20,503
I never made a decision,
that's for sure.

391
00:23:20,537 --> 00:23:22,204
We can't be
in the Cool Whip ad.

392
00:23:22,238 --> 00:23:23,873
It's bad for business.

393
00:23:23,907 --> 00:23:27,977
No. I just
keep thinking

394
00:23:28,011 --> 00:23:30,045
I could be on Broadway

395
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:33,015
or off Broadway

396
00:23:33,049 --> 00:23:35,984
or-- I don't know--
films, even.

397
00:23:39,688 --> 00:23:42,390
Sweetheart...

398
00:23:42,424 --> 00:23:44,058
Sometimes we don't
get to choose

399
00:23:44,092 --> 00:23:45,994
where our talents lie.

400
00:23:47,963 --> 00:23:50,765
I mean, what you did
with Heinz--

401
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:54,034
It took me years to be able
to think that way.

402
00:23:54,068 --> 00:23:58,271
Well, I can't explain it,

403
00:23:58,305 --> 00:24:02,609
but I felt better
failing in that audition

404
00:24:02,644 --> 00:24:05,679
than I did when I was
succeeding at Heinz.

405
00:24:05,713 --> 00:24:09,015
Because that was about
making the client happy.

406
00:24:09,049 --> 00:24:10,516
Wait till you walk
down the street

407
00:24:10,551 --> 00:24:14,053
and see the work
on a wall or on TV,

408
00:24:14,087 --> 00:24:15,588
that's when you feel something.

409
00:24:15,622 --> 00:24:17,823
Do you know that
I can't even stand

410
00:24:17,858 --> 00:24:22,327
going to the theater anymore
because all I feel is envy?

411
00:24:22,362 --> 00:24:24,963
And I know the next
thing is bitterness,

412
00:24:24,997 --> 00:24:27,098
and I don't want to feel that.

413
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:30,569
Okay. So what
do you want to do?

414
00:24:30,603 --> 00:24:34,105
I mean, there's no guarantee.

415
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:37,108
And I'm so grateful.

416
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:41,211
This gave me
so much confidence.

417
00:24:41,245 --> 00:24:44,247
But I never tried
as hard at acting

418
00:24:44,282 --> 00:24:46,383
as I did at advertising.

419
00:24:46,417 --> 00:24:50,654
And it'll never be for me
what it is for you.

420
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:55,292
Look, I know it's uncomfortable
for you with me there.

421
00:24:55,326 --> 00:24:57,259
There's a shadow
over everything.

422
00:24:57,294 --> 00:24:59,696
I put you
in a terrible position.

423
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:02,699
There are 20 firms that
would be glad to have you.

424
00:25:02,733 --> 00:25:06,569
I don't want to do it, Don.

425
00:25:09,506 --> 00:25:11,474
You don't want to do it?

426
00:25:12,909 --> 00:25:16,111
I'm sorry.

427
00:25:16,145 --> 00:25:19,280
Since I was a little girl,
it's all I ever dreamed about.

428
00:25:22,719 --> 00:25:24,552
I understand.

429
00:25:26,188 --> 00:25:28,823
I don't want to keep you
om your dream.

430
00:25:28,857 --> 00:25:31,458
You're so good to me.

431
00:25:33,194 --> 00:25:36,063
So what do you want to do?

432
00:25:36,098 --> 00:25:38,165
I mean, you woke me up
in the middle of the night.

433
00:25:38,199 --> 00:25:40,134
It's obviously
some sort of emergency.

434
00:25:40,168 --> 00:25:43,670
Well, I can finish up my work

435
00:25:43,704 --> 00:25:46,539
and then help train
the new person.

436
00:25:46,573 --> 00:25:49,109
You want to
train somebody? No.

437
00:25:50,945 --> 00:25:53,346
We'll go in tomorrow

438
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:55,915
and you'll say goodbye
to everybody

439
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:57,851
and we'll get you on your way.

440
00:25:57,885 --> 00:26:00,085
Really?

441
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,454
It's what you want.

442
00:26:05,659 --> 00:26:07,693
I don't know what to say.

443
00:26:09,863 --> 00:26:12,131
I love you.

444
00:26:16,035 --> 00:26:18,002
I love you, too.

445
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,816
- Morning.
- Morning.

446
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:22,329
- Megan's quitting.
- Oh.

447
00:27:22,363 --> 00:27:25,432
Yes. So I think today's
going to be her last day.

448
00:27:25,466 --> 00:27:27,367
Okay.

449
00:27:27,401 --> 00:27:29,236
How do you do this?

450
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:31,238
Do you want to have a seat?

451
00:27:31,272 --> 00:27:33,473
It's not like that, Joan.

452
00:27:33,507 --> 00:27:36,275
She's up for a part in a play,
and even if she doesn't get it,

453
00:27:36,309 --> 00:27:38,410
she's decided to go back
to acting full time.

454
00:27:38,445 --> 00:27:40,512
Well, I'm sure
she'll be wonderful.

455
00:27:40,547 --> 00:27:43,082
Do we make an announcement?
Do we have a party?

456
00:27:43,117 --> 00:27:44,583
What's the protocol?

457
00:27:44,618 --> 00:27:48,520
Why don't we have the girls
take her to lunch?

458
00:27:48,555 --> 00:27:51,657
I mean, she's not
disappearing, is she?

459
00:27:51,691 --> 00:27:54,459
No, she's not.

460
00:27:58,564 --> 00:28:02,067
Don, I'll take care of it.

461
00:28:08,606 --> 00:28:10,274
There you are.

462
00:28:10,308 --> 00:28:12,943
Yep, been here for a while.

463
00:28:12,978 --> 00:28:15,512
Well, I wanted to
tell everyone, actually.

464
00:28:24,388 --> 00:28:26,555
Megan, are you okay?

465
00:28:29,493 --> 00:28:31,727
I'm not going to be
working here anymore

466
00:28:31,762 --> 00:28:34,330
and it's really hard
to tell everybody.

467
00:28:37,168 --> 00:28:40,435
Hey! Megan's
talking to you.

468
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:42,971
Go ahead.

469
00:28:44,174 --> 00:28:46,675
I'm so sorry.

470
00:28:46,709 --> 00:28:48,343
I'm not going to
work here anymore.

471
00:28:48,377 --> 00:28:51,013
Did he fire you?
That son of a bitch!

472
00:28:51,047 --> 00:28:53,015
No.

473
00:28:53,049 --> 00:28:55,284
No, I'm going back
to try acting again.

474
00:28:55,318 --> 00:28:57,985
- Are you kidding me?
- Stan.

475
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:01,655
- No, I'd better get used to it.
- Oh, I was...

476
00:29:02,958 --> 00:29:04,926
- Gonna miss you.
- Me, too.

477
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,461
Acting is fascinating.
It's probably easier for girls.

478
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:09,430
But let me ask you, do they
always give you clothes

479
00:29:09,464 --> 00:29:11,432
or do you have to do it
in your own clothes?

480
00:29:11,466 --> 00:29:15,401
I-- I don't know.
Yes, they give you a costume.

481
00:29:15,436 --> 00:29:17,370
- Shoes, too?
- Yes.

482
00:29:18,739 --> 00:29:20,440
Break a leg.

483
00:29:21,709 --> 00:29:23,043
See you around.

484
00:29:27,014 --> 00:29:31,317
I think I'm in the middle
of a lot of things,

485
00:29:31,351 --> 00:29:35,221
but Don told me that I was
just supposed to hand it over.

486
00:29:38,258 --> 00:29:40,692
Are you sure about this?

487
00:29:40,727 --> 00:29:43,595
Peggy...

488
00:29:43,629 --> 00:29:46,430
I've always appreciated
what you've done for me,

489
00:29:46,465 --> 00:29:48,233
not just yesterday.

490
00:29:53,339 --> 00:29:55,206
I should see Joan.

491
00:30:01,746 --> 00:30:03,380
That takes a lot of guts.

492
00:30:03,414 --> 00:30:05,148
I'll tell you
what takes guts--

493
00:30:05,183 --> 00:30:06,884
Never having money for lunch.

494
00:30:06,918 --> 00:30:08,685
She owes me, like,
$15 at this point.

495
00:30:08,719 --> 00:30:11,355
What am I gonna do,
ask Don? Call her?

496
00:30:11,389 --> 00:30:13,223
I think it's clear
why she left.

497
00:30:13,258 --> 00:30:15,859
- That's not why.
- Well, why?

498
00:30:15,893 --> 00:30:18,160
Come on, reality got her.

499
00:30:18,195 --> 00:30:19,795
You work your ass off
for months,

500
00:30:19,829 --> 00:30:21,597
bite your nails, for what?

501
00:30:21,631 --> 00:30:24,566
Heinz baked beans.

502
00:30:29,488 --> 00:30:31,389
Why are you so late?

503
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:33,691
I missed the early train.

504
00:30:33,725 --> 00:30:37,127
Megan's gone. She quit.
She's gonna be an actress.

505
00:30:37,161 --> 00:30:38,795
Joan just told me,
like, five minutes ago.

506
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:40,564
Is that so?

507
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:42,065
It doesn't shock you?

508
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:44,235
No, not really.

509
00:30:44,269 --> 00:30:45,536
What about Don?

510
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:49,839
Please. They do whatever
they want, even to Draper.

511
00:30:49,873 --> 00:30:52,342
Well, the good news is

512
00:30:52,376 --> 00:30:53,843
we don't have to look
over our shoulders anymore,

513
00:30:53,877 --> 00:30:55,811
wondering what
she's gonna tell him.

514
00:30:55,846 --> 00:30:57,747
They work it over
in their minds,

515
00:30:57,781 --> 00:30:59,582
turn it off and on
when they feel like it,

516
00:30:59,617 --> 00:31:02,719
and we're just there,
waiting at attention.

517
00:31:02,753 --> 00:31:05,654
It's not the way
it's supposed to be.

518
00:31:05,688 --> 00:31:07,856
Trudy pregnant again?

519
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:10,825
Have you seen those pictures
of earth from space?

520
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:15,364
- Of course. - Do they make
you feel small and insignificant?

521
00:31:15,398 --> 00:31:18,099
No, Jennifer does that.
And I'm not small, Pete.

522
00:31:18,134 --> 00:31:19,735
Don't know if you've ever
heard that about me.

523
00:31:19,769 --> 00:31:21,970
Save it for your
convention whores.

524
00:31:22,004 --> 00:31:23,504
Hey, keep it down.

525
00:31:23,538 --> 00:31:26,141
I'm asking you
a serious question.

526
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:28,076
I like the pictures
of the earth.

527
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:29,878
I find them to be majestic.

528
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,914
Why do they give you
a glimmer of hope

529
00:31:32,948 --> 00:31:34,582
in the midst of rejection?

530
00:31:34,616 --> 00:31:36,951
A little thread
to hang on to--

531
00:31:36,986 --> 00:31:41,088
A misplaced word,
a suggestion of the future.

532
00:31:41,122 --> 00:31:43,390
Under a court of law, it
would look like an accident,

533
00:31:43,424 --> 00:31:44,925
but it's not.

534
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,828
So we're not talking
about Megan

535
00:31:47,862 --> 00:31:49,396
and we're not
talking about Trudy.

536
00:31:51,332 --> 00:31:54,834
Why do they get to decide
what's going to happen?

537
00:31:54,868 --> 00:31:57,503
They just do.

538
00:32:08,882 --> 00:32:10,916
So enjoy your lunch.

539
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:13,686
I'll see you after.
I have to get my box.

540
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:17,556
Do you really wanna come
back here and do this again?

541
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:19,858
I'll bring it home.

542
00:32:21,461 --> 00:32:23,895
Thank you.

543
00:32:28,967 --> 00:32:30,401
I'll see you at home.

544
00:32:30,436 --> 00:32:32,470
You will.

545
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:37,931
Hey, chief, good news.

546
00:33:37,965 --> 00:33:39,733
Rick from chevalier
found a song they like

547
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:42,202
for the "hard day's
night" spot.

548
00:33:42,236 --> 00:33:44,405
Bet it's his
boyfriend's favorite.

549
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,439
Help yourself.

550
00:33:46,473 --> 00:33:47,907
I think it works pretty well.

551
00:33:47,941 --> 00:33:51,577
Not that it matters when
they send it over, right?

552
00:33:59,453 --> 00:34:03,354
<i>♪ The leaves of brown</i>
<i>came tumbling down ♪</i>

553
00:34:03,389 --> 00:34:08,326
<i>♪ remember</i>
<i>in September... ♪</i>

554
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:11,262
- Are you kidding me?
- Why am I listening to this?

555
00:34:11,297 --> 00:34:13,865
- You know we can't get The Beatles.
- It's not The Beatles.

556
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,867
This song's, like,
30 years old.

557
00:34:15,902 --> 00:34:17,335
But it's happy and it's fun.

558
00:34:17,369 --> 00:34:18,636
And Don thought
it was The Beatles.

559
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:20,638
- And they like it.
- Turn it off.

560
00:34:20,672 --> 00:34:23,441
It's stabbing me
in the fucking heart.

561
00:34:23,475 --> 00:34:25,943
Why are you cursing?

562
00:34:25,977 --> 00:34:28,612
- Can you excuse us?
<i>- Sure.</i>

563
00:34:35,653 --> 00:34:37,520
We're due at the test
kitchen tomorrow.

564
00:34:37,555 --> 00:34:39,956
And they're expecting, uh...

565
00:34:41,158 --> 00:34:43,125
What do you want to do?
We can just cancel it.

566
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:46,028
We're not canceling. Tell them Megan's sick.
Peggy will do it.

567
00:34:46,063 --> 00:34:49,031
Sure.
I'll let her know.

568
00:34:57,073 --> 00:34:58,774
I wasn't expecting to see you.

569
00:34:58,808 --> 00:35:00,275
Yeah, well, tonight I go home,

570
00:35:00,309 --> 00:35:03,512
have dinner with the wife,
everything's in balance.

571
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:11,953
You know, Howard,
I talked to my office

572
00:35:11,987 --> 00:35:13,955
and it turns out you were
right about my policy,

573
00:35:13,989 --> 00:35:16,123
so I let them set me up
with a broker.

574
00:35:16,157 --> 00:35:17,592
Oh, well, why'd you do that?

575
00:35:17,626 --> 00:35:19,093
You didn't even
give me a chance.

576
00:35:19,127 --> 00:35:20,661
I'm telling you, aren't I?

577
00:35:20,696 --> 00:35:22,329
I got all the paperwork
at my house.

578
00:35:22,364 --> 00:35:24,931
I can go home, have some
supper, and stop by later.

579
00:35:24,966 --> 00:35:26,766
Well, our baby's been sick.

580
00:35:26,801 --> 00:35:30,837
You know, I could
just stop by right now.

581
00:35:30,872 --> 00:35:33,373
- Beth's a great cook.
- Is she?

582
00:35:36,076 --> 00:35:38,211
We missed you at Megan's lunch.

583
00:35:38,245 --> 00:35:39,945
I guess you have
some extra work.

584
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:42,882
No. I told her I'd rather go
to my own lunch with her.

585
00:35:42,916 --> 00:35:46,118
I'm not gonna lie--
I did not see it coming.

586
00:35:46,152 --> 00:35:47,620
I thought she would fail here.

587
00:35:47,654 --> 00:35:49,622
I feel bad.

588
00:35:49,656 --> 00:35:52,625
I think maybe
I was harder on her,

589
00:35:52,659 --> 00:35:54,792
scared her away.

590
00:35:56,094 --> 00:35:58,830
Second wives-- It's like
they have a playbook.

591
00:35:58,864 --> 00:36:01,165
I don't think she's like that.

592
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:05,102
Peggy, she's going to be a failing
actress with a rich husband.

593
00:36:05,137 --> 00:36:08,573
No, I think she's good
at everything.

594
00:36:08,607 --> 00:36:11,008
I think she's just
one of those girls.

595
00:36:11,042 --> 00:36:14,210
Then you had every right
to be hard on her.

596
00:36:14,245 --> 00:36:17,714
Did you know that he met Betty
Draper doing a print ad?

597
00:36:17,749 --> 00:36:20,517
Did you know she was a model?

598
00:36:20,552 --> 00:36:23,153
That's the kind of girl
don marries.

599
00:36:25,222 --> 00:36:27,056
Good night.

600
00:36:30,027 --> 00:36:31,994
Beth? Honey?

601
00:36:36,199 --> 00:36:38,034
I don't know where the
hell my kids are.

602
00:36:40,737 --> 00:36:42,971
Hello.

603
00:36:43,005 --> 00:36:44,472
You have a lovely home.

604
00:36:44,506 --> 00:36:46,340
<i>This is my friend
Pete from the train.</i>

605
00:36:46,375 --> 00:36:49,110
He has, believe it or not,
an insurance emergency.

606
00:36:49,144 --> 00:36:51,512
Oh.

607
00:36:51,547 --> 00:36:54,716
- I really don't want to be an intrusion.
- It's fine.

608
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:57,085
We've always got
room for one more.

609
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:59,453
<i>- Where are the kids?</i>
<i>- At my mother's.</i>

610
00:36:59,487 --> 00:37:03,924
Now, don't tell me--
You're... 32.

611
00:37:08,262 --> 00:37:11,131
I'll be at the hotel
Pennsylvania at 12:30.

612
00:37:11,165 --> 00:37:12,700
No.

613
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:18,972
I don't want that.

614
00:37:19,006 --> 00:37:20,940
Then throw it out.

615
00:37:25,178 --> 00:37:27,413
Your old man died young,
but in a plane crash, right?

616
00:37:27,447 --> 00:37:29,415
That's right.

617
00:37:31,417 --> 00:37:33,384
Howard, may I speak with you?

618
00:37:40,727 --> 00:37:42,594
Where are you going?

619
00:37:42,629 --> 00:37:44,730
She's got a migraine.

620
00:37:44,764 --> 00:37:46,231
It's baked chicken.

621
00:37:46,265 --> 00:37:48,499
- I can set a table.
- I don't know.

622
00:37:48,533 --> 00:37:52,369
You've got me
in a little trouble here.

623
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:53,871
Don't run away.

624
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,473
Okay.

625
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:16,484
You shouldn't cook
in bare feet.

626
00:38:23,858 --> 00:38:25,792
Hello.

627
00:38:25,827 --> 00:38:27,828
Don't get used to this
because there is going to be

628
00:38:27,862 --> 00:38:29,396
a lot of crying from rejection.

629
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:32,165
No, I'll try and hold it together.

630
00:38:34,736 --> 00:38:37,337
Beef bourguignon.
Taste.

631
00:38:39,072 --> 00:38:40,940
It's hot as hell.

632
00:38:42,709 --> 00:38:45,044
I thought for sure
you'd come home drunk.

633
00:38:45,078 --> 00:38:47,813
Megan...

634
00:38:47,848 --> 00:38:49,582
It's okay.

635
00:38:51,919 --> 00:38:53,452
Do you wanna
fix yourself a drink?

636
00:38:57,322 --> 00:38:59,290
Don...

637
00:39:01,027 --> 00:39:03,428
I love you.

638
00:39:03,462 --> 00:39:06,164
You're everything
I had hoped you'd be.

639
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,267
You, too.

640
00:39:15,473 --> 00:39:17,307
<i>They're arranged in
varying degrees of sweetness,</i>

641
00:39:17,341 --> 00:39:19,009
<i>the sweetest at the end.</i>

642
00:39:19,044 --> 00:39:20,477
<i>It's like cheese.</i>

643
00:39:20,511 --> 00:39:23,413
You have to try the camembert
before the gorgonzola.

644
00:39:23,414 --> 00:39:24,882
And we have to use clear bowls

645
00:39:24,916 --> 00:39:27,416
because everybody
used to pick the blue one.

646
00:39:27,451 --> 00:39:29,619
Go ahead, start
and we'll take notes.

647
00:39:35,425 --> 00:39:36,926
- Mm.
- Mm.

648
00:39:36,961 --> 00:39:38,527
We'll start with
your thoughts, Ken.

649
00:39:38,562 --> 00:39:41,698
Well, I can't imagine it
tasting any better than that.

650
00:39:41,732 --> 00:39:45,067
Welcome to the creative
cookery kitchen.

651
00:39:45,101 --> 00:39:47,569
You know, I always like to
say you're in for a treat,

652
00:39:47,604 --> 00:39:49,972
but today
it sounds like we are.

653
00:39:51,608 --> 00:39:52,808
How's it going?
Did I miss anything?

654
00:39:52,842 --> 00:39:54,910
- They just sampled "A."
- And?

655
00:39:54,944 --> 00:39:58,713
It's not whipped cream, but
it's delicious on its own.

656
00:40:00,682 --> 00:40:03,350
- Now you answer your wife, right?
- What?

657
00:40:03,384 --> 00:40:05,886
Listen, Phil,
don's wife is sick.

658
00:40:05,921 --> 00:40:08,322
This is Peggy.
She's the copywriter.

659
00:40:08,356 --> 00:40:11,258
- Aw, really?
- It'll be just as good.

660
00:40:11,292 --> 00:40:12,760
Go ahead.

661
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:19,099
- Honey.
- Yes, dear?

662
00:40:21,969 --> 00:40:23,703
I was just going to say

663
00:40:23,738 --> 00:40:25,204
I don't even think
I want dessert.

664
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:28,574
Well, I made two.

665
00:40:28,609 --> 00:40:29,643
Don't do that.

666
00:40:32,545 --> 00:40:34,813
Don't you wanna
know what it is?

667
00:40:34,848 --> 00:40:37,783
- It's Cool Whip.
- That's right, it's Cool Whip.

668
00:40:37,817 --> 00:40:39,051
Just try it.

669
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:42,154
Honey, is that
really what you want?

670
00:40:42,188 --> 00:40:43,889
Yes, I want you to try it.

671
00:40:43,923 --> 00:40:45,423
Don't you want me to taste it?

672
00:40:45,458 --> 00:40:48,126
Yes, just taste it.

673
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,361
Why? Is it a topping?

674
00:40:50,395 --> 00:40:53,497
Yes, and you can
put it on ice cream

675
00:40:53,532 --> 00:40:57,035
and cake
and-- and fruit.

676
00:40:57,069 --> 00:40:59,137
So it's a dessert, then?

677
00:40:59,171 --> 00:41:01,906
Just try it already.

678
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:03,273
Just taste it.

679
00:41:03,307 --> 00:41:05,241
Well...

680
00:41:05,276 --> 00:41:06,910
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

681
00:41:06,944 --> 00:41:08,211
- Thank you.
- A pleasure.

682
00:41:08,245 --> 00:41:10,346
- Mm-hmm.
- We'll talk soon.

683
00:41:14,052 --> 00:41:15,719
I'll be right back.

684
00:41:19,823 --> 00:41:22,158
I am so thirsty.

685
00:41:22,192 --> 00:41:23,525
Look, I think you did great.

686
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,794
It wasn't what
it was about anyway.

687
00:41:24,828 --> 00:41:26,162
They know we're
going to cast it.

688
00:41:26,196 --> 00:41:28,330
You think the actress can
remember to say, "Just taste it"?

689
00:41:28,364 --> 00:41:29,832
You didn't want to rehearse.

690
00:41:29,866 --> 00:41:31,333
You ran it through
one time half-assed.

691
00:41:31,367 --> 00:41:34,236
Look, I've done it a bunch.
I knew my lines.

692
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:36,537
Do you think Megan would come
back and do it in the office?

693
00:41:36,572 --> 00:41:39,607
- Megan is not the problem.
- You didn't want her there!

694
00:41:39,641 --> 00:41:41,375
You were threatened
by everything about her.

695
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:43,244
I spent more time
training her than you did

696
00:41:43,278 --> 00:41:45,246
and eight months defending her.

697
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,948
Defending her?
She was great at it!

698
00:41:46,982 --> 00:41:48,783
She thinks advertising
is stupid.

699
00:41:48,818 --> 00:41:50,585
No, she thinks
the people she worked with

700
00:41:50,619 --> 00:41:52,086
are cynical and petty.

701
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:54,021
- Listen--
- I did everything right,

702
00:41:54,055 --> 00:41:56,156
and I am still
getting it from you.

703
00:41:56,191 --> 00:41:59,126
You know what?
You are not mad at me, so shut up!

704
00:42:04,099 --> 00:42:06,633
I'm sorry, you can't
smoke in here.

705
00:42:30,189 --> 00:42:32,624
- For God's sake, are you avoiding me?
- Yes.

706
00:42:32,658 --> 00:42:34,659
What happened?

707
00:42:35,728 --> 00:42:37,295
She's following her dream.

708
00:42:37,329 --> 00:42:39,797
That's admirable.

709
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:44,401
I gotta say, I can see
her as an actress.

710
00:42:44,435 --> 00:42:46,737
Not that she's insincere,
but, you know.

711
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:49,606
She's very sincere.

712
00:42:49,641 --> 00:42:51,976
I sure as hell didn't get to
choose what I wanted to do.

713
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:54,844
- My father told me.
- I was raised in the '30s.

714
00:42:54,879 --> 00:42:57,280
My dream was indoor plumbing.

715
00:42:57,314 --> 00:42:59,582
You know what?
She wants to have a baby.

716
00:42:59,616 --> 00:43:01,818
- This is just the beginning of
her process. - <i>I don't know.</i>

717
00:43:01,852 --> 00:43:04,620
I suggested that path
on our honeymoon.

718
00:43:04,655 --> 00:43:06,756
She said my kids were enough.

719
00:43:06,791 --> 00:43:08,291
Jane wanted a baby,

720
00:43:08,325 --> 00:43:09,793
but I thought,
"why do that to somebody?"

721
00:43:14,831 --> 00:43:18,400
Why shouldn't
she do what she wants?

722
00:43:18,434 --> 00:43:20,368
I don't want her
to end up like Betty.

723
00:43:20,403 --> 00:43:22,070
Or her mother.

724
00:43:28,877 --> 00:43:30,544
You gotta go home,

725
00:43:30,578 --> 00:43:32,713
let her know
that there's a routine.

726
00:43:32,747 --> 00:43:35,016
It'll keep you both
out of trouble.

727
00:43:36,251 --> 00:43:38,485
Mona's dad told me that.

728
00:43:44,992 --> 00:43:48,094
I was afraid I was going to
leave for class and miss you.

729
00:43:54,601 --> 00:43:56,469
Oh.

730
00:43:56,503 --> 00:43:58,904
You said you didn't know
what was going on.

731
00:43:58,939 --> 00:44:01,040
I bought you
the latest Beatles album.

732
00:44:02,575 --> 00:44:04,576
Start with this one.

733
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,048
Have fun.
