00:00:01,926 --> 00:00:03,910
I'm not gonna pretend
I don't want your job, but

3
00:00:04,175 --> 00:00:05,667
There's plenty of room at the top.

4
00:00:08,198 --> 00:00:11,172
I found out who's moving into that
little dutch colonial down the street.

5
00:00:11,607 --> 00:00:13,662
- Who?
- Her name is Helen Bishop.

6
00:00:13,863 --> 00:00:14,884
She's divorced.

7
00:00:15,507 --> 00:00:16,511
Really?

8
00:00:16,814 --> 00:00:18,659
What do you do, just kiss
women all the time?

9
00:00:18,762 --> 00:00:19,889
Women you aren't married to?

10
00:00:20,393 --> 00:00:21,403
Of course not.

11
00:00:23,078 --> 00:00:25,562
When I came over that night,
you know,

12
00:00:25,822 --> 00:00:27,147
I was there.

13
00:00:27,407 --> 00:00:28,409
I'm married now.

It's not <i>Lenny Bruce</i>...

00:01:36,188 --> 00:01:37,764
But this is better, it's funny.

26
00:01:37,964 --> 00:01:40,136
This guy used to be an accountant,
did you know that?

27
00:01:40,396 --> 00:01:41,512
Really?

28
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,972
He's not anymore, is he?

29
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:46,475
Your wife is here, Mr. Campbell.

30
00:01:47,581 --> 00:01:48,786
Thank you, Hildi.

31
00:01:48,948 --> 00:01:50,639
Lunch date, good idea.

32
00:01:51,893 --> 00:01:52,893
You married folks,

33
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,150
must be nice to spend
some time together.

34
00:01:58,213 --> 00:01:59,213
Hello lovely.

35
00:01:59,821 --> 00:02:01,365
You can do better than that.

36
00:02:02,151 --> 00:02:05,160
Trudy, you know the fellas,
Ken, Paul, and Harry, of course.

37
00:02:05,564 --> 00:02:07,336
You'll notice only men
coming out of there.

38
00:02:07,548 --> 00:02:09,356
I know, you all work so hard.

39
00:02:09,523 --> 00:02:10,958
- How's Jennifer?
- Good,

40
00:02:11,218 --> 00:02:12,366
swell actually, considering

41
00:02:12,542 --> 00:02:14,920
she's still at the phone company,
nothing I can do.

42
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,969
That's not true, you could
give her a baby.

43
00:02:18,399 --> 00:02:19,675
You're all in on it together.

44
00:02:20,715 --> 00:02:22,397
Nice to see you all again.

45
00:02:23,839 --> 00:02:25,008
Do we have a lunch date?

46
00:02:25,214 --> 00:02:26,983
Because Hildi, she can
show you the book.

47
00:02:27,171 --> 00:02:28,744
No, but I'm taking you away.

48
00:02:30,314 --> 00:02:32,475
I don't think taking you
to lunch is part of my job.

49
00:02:32,721 --> 00:02:33,855
Do you have something today?

50
00:02:34,712 --> 00:02:35,712
No.

51
00:02:35,945 --> 00:02:37,495
I thought you'd be happy to see me,

52
00:02:37,775 --> 00:02:40,135
I called Hildi and
asked if you were free,

53
00:02:40,523 --> 00:02:42,460
it will only take a minute,
I promise.

54
00:02:43,211 --> 00:02:44,807
I'm sorry, that's great,

55
00:02:45,022 --> 00:02:46,034
where are we going?

56
00:02:47,055 --> 00:02:48,324
It's a surprise.

57
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:50,916
Don, I'd like you to meet my wife,

58
00:02:51,124 --> 00:02:52,124
Trudy Campbell.

59
00:02:52,384 --> 00:02:53,875
Don Draper, nice to meet you.

60
00:02:54,135 --> 00:02:55,900
Congratulations, you're
a very lucky girl.

61
00:02:56,211 --> 00:02:58,689
I know, most of my friends
can't find a good man.

62
00:02:58,924 --> 00:03:00,966
Believe me, I'm the lucky one.

63
00:03:01,647 --> 00:03:02,840
Yes you are.

64
00:03:07,232 --> 00:03:08,953
He's essential to the process
around here,

65
00:03:09,093 --> 00:03:11,254
I think we're almost as happy
to have him as you are.

66
00:03:11,528 --> 00:03:13,297
I don't think that's possible.

67
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,541
Well, maybe you're right,

68
00:03:16,104 --> 00:03:17,107
nice to meet you.

69
00:03:20,253 --> 00:03:21,511
He's so nice,

70
00:03:22,014 --> 00:03:23,780
not at all like imagined.

71
00:03:35,002 --> 00:03:37,804
1500 square feet, two nice bedrooms,

72
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:40,739
I don't know if that includes
that maid's room.

73
00:03:41,235 --> 00:03:42,597
Have to be a pretty small maid.

74
00:03:42,773 --> 00:03:44,336
...and it's on the market for 32,

75
00:03:44,582 --> 00:03:47,342
but Elaine, the realtor, says
we can get it for 30.

76
00:03:48,398 --> 00:03:49,578
Lovely...

77
00:03:50,687 --> 00:03:53,200
you know that I want to
give you everything.

78
00:03:53,435 --> 00:03:55,458
We don't have to pay
for the whole thing at once,

79
00:03:55,618 --> 00:03:56,945
we can get a mortgage.

80
00:03:58,614 --> 00:04:00,320
I make $75.00 a week, now,

81
00:04:00,576 --> 00:04:02,328
I know you're not good at math,

82
00:04:02,598 --> 00:04:04,360
but that's $3500 a year.

83
00:04:05,462 --> 00:04:06,739
You'll make more.

84
00:04:07,584 --> 00:04:08,584
Eventually,

85
00:04:08,984 --> 00:04:11,953
but if we put ten percent down,
that's an entire years salary.

86
00:04:12,213 --> 00:04:14,713
Sweetheart, we're not in this alone,

87
00:04:15,183 --> 00:04:18,318
we're a young couple
that needs a little help.

88
00:04:24,329 --> 00:04:26,489
Did you see the sink
in the master bathroom?

89
00:04:26,977 --> 00:04:28,949
It's the same one they have
in the pierre.

90
00:04:46,945 --> 00:04:47,950
Hello.

91
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:50,357
Mr. Draper... didn't expect
to see you back here.

92
00:04:52,272 --> 00:04:54,898
Well, we're, uh, screening
a television commercial,

93
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:57,913
it will probably look better
when it's breaking up "<i>Bonanza</i>".

94
00:04:59,524 --> 00:05:02,324
His work is wonderful,
he's perfect for Menken's.

95
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:04,447
So he keeps telling me.

96
00:05:06,586 --> 00:05:08,897
Well, I'll let you see
Miss Menken out.

97
00:05:16,147 --> 00:05:17,150
How are you?

98
00:05:18,523 --> 00:05:19,643
I'm fine,

99
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:23,232
my family is fine, the weather
has been spectacular.

100
00:05:23,837 --> 00:05:24,900
Rachel, listen...

101
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,276
What are you doing?

102
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:28,900
I don't know,

103
00:05:31,337 --> 00:05:32,783
I don't want it to be like this.

104
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:34,399
Yes, well...

105
00:05:35,837 --> 00:05:37,834
We both know how we'd like it to be.

106
00:05:39,275 --> 00:05:40,916
Can we at least have lunch sometime?

107
00:05:41,917 --> 00:05:44,159
I really can't see a reason for that.

108
00:05:50,665 --> 00:05:51,879
"Church bells rang out,"

109
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:54,468
"and the air was filled
with flying birds,"

110
00:05:55,165 --> 00:05:57,702
"what a joyous parade
it was back at the palace,"

111
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:00,501
"no king could command
anything finer."

112
00:06:02,072 --> 00:06:03,188
"The end."

113
00:06:03,628 --> 00:06:04,717
The end.

114
00:06:08,732 --> 00:06:09,732
Again?

115
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,976
Daddy ll see you in the morning.

116
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:25,502
Helen, come on,
I know you're in there!

117
00:06:28,148 --> 00:06:29,366
Damn it, Helen,

118
00:06:29,923 --> 00:06:31,007
Open the door!

119
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,440
Excuse me, miss...

120
00:06:38,812 --> 00:06:40,451
I know you can hear me, miss!

121
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:45,772
Look, can- can I use your phone?

122
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:48,233
I'm her husband,

123
00:06:48,493 --> 00:06:51,207
I'm supposed to see my kids,
and I- I know she's in there,

124
00:06:51,443 --> 00:06:52,941
I just called from the gas station.

125
00:06:54,373 --> 00:06:55,373
No, I'm sorry.

126
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:57,792
Are you serious?

127
00:06:58,743 --> 00:07:00,283
I'm sure you are who
you say you are,

128
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:02,997
but I don't let strange men
into my home.

129
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:26,935
Can I come in?

130
00:07:27,186 --> 00:07:28,189
Of course.

131
00:07:36,431 --> 00:07:39,575
I'm really sorry, I'm so embarrassed.

132
00:07:42,932 --> 00:07:44,872
I don't know what
you're talking about.

133
00:07:46,369 --> 00:07:47,369
Yes you do...

134
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:48,990
I was at the window.

135
00:07:51,372 --> 00:07:52,372
Did you let him in?

136
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:56,175
Yes.

137
00:07:59,871 --> 00:08:01,319
He's not a bad man.

138
00:08:05,368 --> 00:08:06,910
Do you want some coffee?

139
00:08:11,746 --> 00:08:13,119
It's a joke really,

140
00:08:13,495 --> 00:08:15,645
Dan hardly saw the kids at
all when we were married,

141
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,945
he works in Manhattan,

142
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:18,231
life insurance,

143
00:08:18,907 --> 00:08:21,016
now all of a sudden,
he can't live without them.

144
00:08:21,685 --> 00:08:23,953
Of course, if he does die, I'm set.

145
00:08:27,119 --> 00:08:28,119
I'm joking.

146
00:08:32,057 --> 00:08:33,057
What happened?

147
00:08:35,185 --> 00:08:36,185
I'll tell you exactly,

148
00:08:37,371 --> 00:08:38,811
he had a lot of friends in the city,

149
00:08:39,683 --> 00:08:41,712
there was poker, and tennis,

150
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,165
drinks at the river club,

151
00:08:44,405 --> 00:08:46,224
turned out none of them were men.

152
00:08:48,359 --> 00:08:49,457
I'm.. I'm sorry...

153
00:08:50,121 --> 00:08:52,606
I really just meant tonight,
what happened...

154
00:08:53,046 --> 00:08:54,692
Please, I figure I might
as well say it,

155
00:08:54,805 --> 00:08:56,890
that's what you've all been
guessing anyway, right?

156
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:59,098
We haven't all been doing anything.

157
00:09:01,246 --> 00:09:02,246
Okay...

158
00:09:04,122 --> 00:09:05,693
The strangest part of it is that,

159
00:09:05,995 --> 00:09:08,180
I think he's angrier at me
than I am at him,

160
00:09:08,497 --> 00:09:09,934
of course, my father got a lawyer,

161
00:09:10,094 --> 00:09:12,250
an army buddy who just
hammered the hell out of him.

162
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:16,437
I've always loved that house.

163
00:09:23,686 --> 00:09:24,686
Hello.

164
00:09:31,062 --> 00:09:32,161
He has to go right upstairs

165
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:34,602
and have complete quiet for a while,

166
00:09:35,316 --> 00:09:36,499
he works so hard.

167
00:09:37,617 --> 00:09:38,837
I should get back,

168
00:09:39,241 --> 00:09:40,612
my kids are asleep.

169
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:03,244
Boat's in the water,

170
00:10:07,563 --> 00:10:09,335
and your cousin sarah, had her baby,

171
00:10:09,688 --> 00:10:11,893
named it after your uncle Skip,
I think that's nice.

172
00:10:14,938 --> 00:10:17,000
Everything's already in the trunks,

173
00:10:19,187 --> 00:10:20,276
I do hope you and Trudy

174
00:10:20,501 --> 00:10:22,987
will be making it out to
the house this summer.

175
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,003
We'll try, I'm not sure I'll be able

176
00:10:26,187 --> 00:10:27,513
to take the time off from work.

177
00:10:27,682 --> 00:10:28,701
Work?

178
00:10:30,419 --> 00:10:31,968
I still don't understand what you do.

179
00:10:32,124 --> 00:10:33,875
I'd hate for you to
miss the Blackberry's.

180
00:10:34,087 --> 00:10:35,833
Run into you at the club,
you're working,

181
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:37,839
at a restaurant, you're working,

182
00:10:38,081 --> 00:10:39,587
taking people out to dinner,

183
00:10:39,942 --> 00:10:41,332
wining and whoring,

184
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:43,674
no job for a white man.

185
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,768
She's made such a nice
addition to the table,

186
00:10:48,355 --> 00:10:50,056
so nice and appreciative.

187
00:10:51,452 --> 00:10:52,852
There's a lot more to it than that.

188
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,427
Advertising, really?

189
00:10:56,296 --> 00:10:57,544
See, if someone were to tell me

190
00:10:57,704 --> 00:11:00,542
there's a lot more to the law,
I'd believe them.

191
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,310
I can't explain how
business works to you.

192
00:11:07,705 --> 00:11:10,211
Trudy found, an apartment
that she likes.

193
00:11:10,766 --> 00:11:12,393
Did she, where abouts?

194
00:11:12,891 --> 00:11:14,255
83rd and park, very nice.

195
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:16,415
Are you sure you want
to be that far uptown?

196
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:18,167
It's not that far, dad.

197
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:19,792
It falls off after 79th.

198
00:11:20,017 --> 00:11:21,253
No darling,

199
00:11:21,513 --> 00:11:22,883
they fall off after 86th,

200
00:11:23,868 --> 00:11:24,965
it's a very nice area.

201
00:11:25,828 --> 00:11:26,828
It is...

202
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:30,008
And well...

203
00:11:31,331 --> 00:11:33,257
It's actually kind of expensive,

204
00:11:34,142 --> 00:11:35,142
so...

205
00:11:35,827 --> 00:11:38,366
we're going to need help
with the down payment.

206
00:11:39,705 --> 00:11:40,705
Really?

207
00:11:41,268 --> 00:11:42,268
Yes.

208
00:11:46,082 --> 00:11:48,249
No, I don't think that's a good idea.

209
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:51,079
And why is that?

210
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,456
I just don't think it's a good idea.

211
00:11:57,331 --> 00:11:59,357
You thought it was a good
idea to help Bud, when

212
00:11:59,704 --> 00:12:01,911
he hit that girl on her bike in
montauk last summer,

213
00:12:02,127 --> 00:12:03,336
what did that cost?

214
00:12:12,766 --> 00:12:14,270
I presume it's your profession

215
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:16,641
that is responsible for
this lapse in your manners?

216
00:12:18,579 --> 00:12:19,579
I'll pay you back.

217
00:12:21,268 --> 00:12:23,148
It's not about the money, Peter,

218
00:12:24,404 --> 00:12:25,483
you know that.

219
00:12:29,747 --> 00:12:32,198
Why is it so hard for you
people to give me anything?

220
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:33,950
We gave you everything,

221
00:12:34,822 --> 00:12:36,430
we gave you your name,

222
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,956
and what have you done with it?

223
00:12:54,392 --> 00:12:56,074
Did you have a nice visit?

224
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:58,252
They're very keen on us coming out

225
00:12:58,446 --> 00:12:59,961
to Fisher's island this summer.

226
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,767
Can they help with the apartment?

227
00:13:03,456 --> 00:13:04,895
I didn't bring it up,

228
00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:07,734
my dad's been having
some health problems.

229
00:13:08,917 --> 00:13:09,998
Sweetheart,

230
00:13:11,301 --> 00:13:12,781
what's wrong with him?

231
00:13:15,831 --> 00:13:16,831
Nobody knows.

232
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:27,403
Walter, how's it going?

233
00:13:27,646 --> 00:13:28,884
Never had much luck,

234
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,845
unless I'm playing
against Campbell here.

235
00:13:32,226 --> 00:13:33,759
He's known for losing gracefully.

236
00:13:35,207 --> 00:13:37,013
You know our director,
Salvatore Romano.

237
00:13:38,365 --> 00:13:39,803
Did you have a good time
in the city last night?

238
00:13:40,067 --> 00:13:41,067
When I come into town,

239
00:13:41,191 --> 00:13:42,935
I like to just do my business
and go home.

240
00:13:43,195 --> 00:13:44,353
Unwind with the psalms.

241
00:13:44,613 --> 00:13:46,491
No man should have to
live out of a suitcase.

242
00:13:48,111 --> 00:13:49,837
What do you fellows have for me?

243
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,270
Well...

244
00:13:52,788 --> 00:13:53,977
We take for granted

245
00:13:54,646 --> 00:13:57,852
the things we need the most,
water, oil, electricity,

246
00:13:59,063 --> 00:14:00,119
steel,

247
00:14:00,601 --> 00:14:02,621
I was thinking about
the last time you were here,

248
00:14:02,894 --> 00:14:04,631
looking out this window at this

249
00:14:05,206 --> 00:14:07,601
incredible city and saying...

250
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,378
"It's all steel."

251
00:14:12,145 --> 00:14:13,299
New York city,

252
00:14:13,948 --> 00:14:16,237
brought to you by <i>Bethlehem Steel</i>,

253
00:14:17,646 --> 00:14:18,846
city of Pittsburgh,

254
00:14:19,476 --> 00:14:20,944
brought to you by <i>Bethlehem Steel</i>,

255
00:14:21,348 --> 00:14:23,309
city of Chicago, Detroit,

256
00:14:23,521 --> 00:14:24,694
St. Louis,

257
00:14:25,271 --> 00:14:27,372
full page ads in targeted markets,

258
00:14:27,661 --> 00:14:29,739
newspapers, trade publications,

259
00:14:30,112 --> 00:14:31,156
throw in a few billboards

260
00:14:31,356 --> 00:14:33,411
so your employees can brag
to their girlfriends.

261
00:14:38,394 --> 00:14:40,159
They're kind of plain, aren't they?

262
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:44,163
Reminds of those W.P.A. ads
before the war.

263
00:14:45,381 --> 00:14:47,154
Walter, you've been
doing this long enough,

264
00:14:47,366 --> 00:14:49,918
you know we could throw
this artwork away in a minute,

265
00:14:50,585 --> 00:14:52,921
but the sentiment, the idea,

266
00:14:53,181 --> 00:14:55,798
it's so basic, you feel like
you already know it,

267
00:14:56,059 --> 00:14:57,843
you just haven't thought
of it lately.

268
00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:01,780
Cities... are made of steel.

269
00:15:02,585 --> 00:15:03,932
<i>Bethlehem Steel</i>!

270
00:15:04,585 --> 00:15:06,099
I might be wrong, but these

271
00:15:06,361 --> 00:15:08,014
feel like ads for cities!

272
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,813
You're making our company look like

273
00:15:11,048 --> 00:15:12,340
a middleman for another product.

274
00:15:13,553 --> 00:15:14,609
Well, would you prefer

275
00:15:14,869 --> 00:15:16,589
an I-beam on a plate,

276
00:15:16,801 --> 00:15:17,893
with a pat of butter on it?

277
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,862
No need to get cute, Don.

278
00:15:21,084 --> 00:15:22,284
... Just making a point!

279
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:23,710
Steel is not something

280
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,453
that you can buy at the supermarket.

281
00:15:25,713 --> 00:15:27,622
But it is a commodity.

282
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:30,127
I'm surprised,

283
00:15:30,642 --> 00:15:33,060
I believe this is fairly close
to what we had talked about.

284
00:15:33,283 --> 00:15:34,713
We talked about a national strategy

285
00:15:34,973 --> 00:15:38,174
that would involve the virtues
of this essential commodity.

286
00:15:38,434 --> 00:15:39,748
I believe it was more specific.

287
00:15:41,075 --> 00:15:43,165
Walter has expressed himself...
Now walter,

288
00:15:43,411 --> 00:15:45,067
if this does not meet
your expectations,

289
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,016
I'm sure Don can find
something that does,

290
00:15:47,272 --> 00:15:48,272
right Don?

291
00:15:48,564 --> 00:15:49,811
I hate to be a pain in the ass,

292
00:15:50,071 --> 00:15:52,439
but, if they didn't just
lay there so flat,

293
00:15:53,646 --> 00:15:54,899
I don't know maybe it's because

294
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:56,567
I'm not from a city,

295
00:15:56,882 --> 00:15:58,107
they... just...

296
00:15:59,105 --> 00:16:00,113
bother me!

297
00:16:00,632 --> 00:16:03,838
Look, if we can persuade you
to stay in town another 24 hours,

298
00:16:04,132 --> 00:16:05,723
back at the <i>Saint Regis</i> of course,

299
00:16:06,017 --> 00:16:08,830
it would give us a chance to come up
with something with more impact,

300
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:10,595
get you tickets to a broadway show,

301
00:16:11,382 --> 00:16:13,250
there's a new one, "<i>Bye-bye Birdie</i>".

302
00:16:13,819 --> 00:16:15,454
I don't like birds either.

303
00:16:15,993 --> 00:16:17,203
Well, something else then.

304
00:16:17,513 --> 00:16:20,758
Pete, I think Sal can show
Mr. Blythe out... Walt.

305
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:26,415
Sorry about that,
they are good drawings.

306
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:29,362
No, the W.P.A. was a very
respected style...

307
00:16:30,216 --> 00:16:31,449
20 years ago.

308
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:39,172
What the hell was that?

309
00:16:39,462 --> 00:16:40,690
Come on, Don,

310
00:16:41,338 --> 00:16:44,121
that's not the first time someone's
been unhappy,

311
00:16:44,408 --> 00:16:45,416
give it a haircut,

312
00:16:45,592 --> 00:16:47,611
he's a second time guy anyway,
I could feel that.

313
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:49,988
And I could feel he was
sentences away,

314
00:16:50,493 --> 00:16:51,949
I'm that kind of guy.

315
00:16:52,408 --> 00:16:53,457
He didn't like the idea.

316
00:16:53,717 --> 00:16:55,768
Someone hadn't prepared him
to like the idea,

317
00:16:55,971 --> 00:16:59,258
an idea he was extremely
enthusiastic about three months ago.

318
00:17:00,157 --> 00:17:02,840
I'm sorry I didn't lower
his expectations enough.

319
00:17:04,129 --> 00:17:06,349
You do your job, take him sailing,

320
00:17:06,635 --> 00:17:09,265
get him in a bathing suit,
leave the ideas to me.

321
00:17:09,846 --> 00:17:10,846
I have ideas.

322
00:17:12,345 --> 00:17:13,345
I'm sure you do,

323
00:17:13,611 --> 00:17:15,232
<i>Sterling Cooper</i> has
more failed artists

324
00:17:15,431 --> 00:17:17,064
and intellectuals
than the third Reich.

325
00:17:17,656 --> 00:17:20,040
You know what, I have good ideas.

326
00:17:20,577 --> 00:17:23,529
In fact, I used to carry around a
notebook and a pen just to keep track.

327
00:17:23,789 --> 00:17:25,973
Direct marketing, I thought of that,

328
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:29,343
turned out it already existed,
but I arrived at it independently,

329
00:17:29,795 --> 00:17:31,015
and then I come to this place,

330
00:17:31,215 --> 00:17:34,162
and you people tell me that I'm good
with people, which is strange,

331
00:17:34,722 --> 00:17:36,792
because I'd never heard that before.

332
00:17:49,099 --> 00:17:50,099
Draper residence.

333
00:17:50,992 --> 00:17:53,352
<i>Betty? Helen Bishop, are you busy? </i>

334
00:17:54,869 --> 00:17:57,771
No, I'm just finishing up dinner.

335
00:17:59,409 --> 00:18:00,409
Of course.

336
00:18:00,977 --> 00:18:03,237
Listen, this may be truly rude, but

337
00:18:03,774 --> 00:18:05,007
I was wondering,

338
00:18:05,787 --> 00:18:08,798
I'm supposed to be stuffing envelopes
at Kennedy headquarters tonight

339
00:18:09,035 --> 00:18:11,370
and my sitter just canceled, and

340
00:18:11,628 --> 00:18:13,169
I hate to back out because, well,

341
00:18:13,361 --> 00:18:15,275
you know, New York state
is so important.

342
00:18:17,788 --> 00:18:18,834
I didn't know that.

343
00:18:19,094 --> 00:18:20,991
Anyway, I was wondering
if you could come over

344
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,546
and watch the kids for a few hours.

345
00:18:23,098 --> 00:18:24,098
Right now?

346
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:29,104
You know what, I shouldn't of asked.

347
00:18:32,853 --> 00:18:36,056
Well, let me just get dinner
on the table,

348
00:18:36,787 --> 00:18:38,881
I guess Don can watch the kids.

349
00:18:39,478 --> 00:18:40,480
<i>Really?</i>

350
00:18:41,113 --> 00:18:43,320
Gosh, that would be
wonderful, take your time.

351
00:18:55,855 --> 00:18:57,616
You're a lifesaver, truly,

352
00:18:57,867 --> 00:19:00,080
I can't tell you how much
I appreciate this.

353
00:19:00,418 --> 00:19:01,540
Hiroshima, I know.

354
00:19:01,803 --> 00:19:03,594
Cleaning lady and
babysitter are one.

355
00:19:04,539 --> 00:19:05,539
Stop.

356
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,228
It's charming.

357
00:19:10,538 --> 00:19:11,803
That's beautiful, Glen.

358
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:14,389
Except he could wake the baby.
Glen, stop that now!

359
00:19:15,356 --> 00:19:16,390
You remember Mrs. Draper?

360
00:19:16,601 --> 00:19:18,309
She's going to take care of you
while I'm gone,

361
00:19:18,843 --> 00:19:19,852
no ironing.

362
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:21,541
Ironing?

363
00:19:21,774 --> 00:19:23,898
I give him five cents a piece,
he loves doing it.

364
00:19:24,699 --> 00:19:26,025
There you are!

365
00:19:26,717 --> 00:19:28,162
I swear to god, I am so exhausted

366
00:19:28,373 --> 00:19:30,439
when I get home from
the jewelry store that I just

367
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:32,699
kick these off, and I never
know where they end up.

368
00:19:33,084 --> 00:19:36,195
You, Glen Bishop, in bed after
"<i>The real McCoys</i>", no discussions.

369
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:42,750
You look very nice.

370
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,657
I keep the place poorly lit.

371
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:50,676
I guess there'll be
a lot of nice men there.

372
00:19:51,742 --> 00:19:54,647
Yes, I guess so,
although it's mostly women.

373
00:19:55,114 --> 00:19:56,597
Have you seen the candidate?

374
00:19:57,243 --> 00:19:59,402
On the news, he's handsome,

375
00:20:00,178 --> 00:20:01,894
but I'm not sure who
we're voting for.

376
00:20:03,088 --> 00:20:04,861
I'll bring you back some literature,

377
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:06,914
I'll be back before 10:00,
I promise.

378
00:20:27,689 --> 00:20:30,870
You gotta get that lux soap campaign
over to <i>Sterling Cooper</i>,

379
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:33,230
Janet Leigh and Natalie Wood,

380
00:20:33,479 --> 00:20:34,891
now there's a day at the office.

381
00:20:35,491 --> 00:20:36,625
Is that an orange?

382
00:20:37,961 --> 00:20:40,191
I'm telling you- you boys,
you've got it made,

383
00:20:40,403 --> 00:20:41,433
martini lunches,

384
00:20:41,693 --> 00:20:43,419
gorgeous women parading through,

385
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:45,521
in my next life, I'm coming back
as an ad man.

386
00:20:46,362 --> 00:20:48,616
Well, there's slightly
more to it than that.

387
00:20:49,159 --> 00:20:50,577
I'd keep that to yourself.

388
00:20:50,813 --> 00:20:52,152
I met his boss yesterday,

389
00:20:52,412 --> 00:20:54,029
you should of heard
the nice things he said.

390
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,698
He's not my boss.

391
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:57,658
Well isn't that nice,

392
00:20:57,918 --> 00:20:59,785
to be appreciated for what you do.

393
00:21:02,104 --> 00:21:03,642
We have some great news.

394
00:21:04,723 --> 00:21:05,892
Already?

395
00:21:06,196 --> 00:21:08,587
Honestly you two, it's not that,

396
00:21:09,516 --> 00:21:10,837
we found an apartment.

397
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,953
Well that's exciting too.

398
00:21:14,423 --> 00:21:15,926
Yes, well, unfortunately it's

399
00:21:16,186 --> 00:21:17,794
a bit out of our price
range right now.

400
00:21:17,947 --> 00:21:19,179
I've been looking in the neighborhood,

401
00:21:19,434 --> 00:21:21,164
- and it seems very well priced to me.
- What's it going for?

402
00:21:21,337 --> 00:21:23,437
32, but the realtor says
we can get it for 30.

403
00:21:23,693 --> 00:21:24,976
- Around here?
- 83rd.

404
00:21:25,236 --> 00:21:26,322
- But...
- How many rooms?

405
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:28,647
Five, two bedrooms,
two baths, a terrace...

406
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:31,733
I don't know,

407
00:21:32,338 --> 00:21:33,853
I'd have to look at it first.

408
00:21:40,835 --> 00:21:41,534
Thank you!

409
00:21:42,173 --> 00:21:43,178
Sir!

410
00:21:43,796 --> 00:21:45,622
I'll take Tom or dad, you got me?

411
00:21:48,971 --> 00:21:51,586
It's very generous for you
to even consider it,

412
00:21:51,846 --> 00:21:54,547
but I think we'd rather wait.

413
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:57,550
For what?

414
00:21:57,834 --> 00:21:58,843
Start your life already,

415
00:21:59,103 --> 00:22:00,858
you're gonna be a rich bastard
on your own someday,

416
00:22:00,952 --> 00:22:02,168
waiting's a bunch of bullshit.

417
00:22:02,398 --> 00:22:03,841
- Tom cat!
- It is!

418
00:22:04,084 --> 00:22:05,266
Your confidence is really...

419
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:07,302
well, it's swell,

420
00:22:07,798 --> 00:22:10,163
but honestly, I'm not sure
it's a good idea.

421
00:22:10,304 --> 00:22:11,304
I am!

422
00:22:12,851 --> 00:22:16,119
Pete, this is an investment
for me and you,

423
00:22:17,371 --> 00:22:19,170
And my jellybean
over here, of course.

424
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:29,410
Thank you!

425
00:22:29,595 --> 00:22:30,776
You're gonna love it,

426
00:22:31,003 --> 00:22:32,670
we'll be so happy there.

427
00:22:47,473 --> 00:22:48,696
I knew they'd help us.

428
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:50,285
I know you did.

429
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:52,427
Come on,

430
00:22:53,225 --> 00:22:55,387
you can't possibly be angry with me.

431
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:00,415
I'm just not sure taking that
kind of money is a good idea.

432
00:23:01,036 --> 00:23:02,601
He's not paying for the whole thing!

433
00:23:03,127 --> 00:23:04,594
It's still a lot of money,

434
00:23:04,785 --> 00:23:06,134
and I'm not sure what it means.

435
00:23:07,222 --> 00:23:09,226
It means we get the apartment.

436
00:23:11,285 --> 00:23:13,458
Do they get to tell us
where to put the furniture?

437
00:23:13,647 --> 00:23:14,849
They're not like that,

438
00:23:16,608 --> 00:23:18,383
you would of taken money
from your parents.

439
00:23:18,537 --> 00:23:20,107
- That's different!
- Why?

440
00:23:20,348 --> 00:23:21,353
Because,

441
00:23:21,787 --> 00:23:23,777
that's my money,
I'll get it eventually.

442
00:23:24,134 --> 00:23:25,721
So this is my money.

443
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,860
Sweetheart,

444
00:23:28,244 --> 00:23:30,733
he wants to help,
it makes him feel good.

445
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,204
Well what about me?

446
00:23:32,664 --> 00:23:33,678
Well, what about me?

447
00:23:36,536 --> 00:23:38,663
You always get what you want,
don't you?

448
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:40,679
I got you,

449
00:23:41,825 --> 00:23:43,655
that's all I really wanted.

450
00:23:47,362 --> 00:23:49,240
Excuse me, can we turn on park?

451
00:23:50,099 --> 00:23:51,680
I need to meet a client downtown.

452
00:23:51,913 --> 00:23:53,597
Hush, it will only take a sec.

453
00:23:55,285 --> 00:23:56,285
The armory...

454
00:23:57,536 --> 00:23:59,600
When are they gonna tear
that dinosaur down?

455
00:24:22,852 --> 00:24:23,852
I'll be right back.

456
00:25:28,352 --> 00:25:29,427
I'm in here!

457
00:25:31,668 --> 00:25:33,348
Glen, I said get out!

458
00:25:36,802 --> 00:25:38,191
Young man, what is wrong with you?

459
00:25:38,332 --> 00:25:39,771
This room is occupied!

460
00:25:54,898 --> 00:25:56,454
What do you have to say for yourself?

461
00:25:59,716 --> 00:26:00,748
Look at me,

462
00:26:01,656 --> 00:26:02,980
that was very bad!

463
00:26:06,646 --> 00:26:08,950
You know better than to walk
in on someone like that-

464
00:26:10,022 --> 00:26:11,761
that room is private,

465
00:26:12,271 --> 00:26:13,531
extremely private,

466
00:26:16,397 --> 00:26:18,150
well that's all I'm trying to say.

467
00:26:20,352 --> 00:26:21,584
Now look at me.

468
00:26:25,087 --> 00:26:26,901
Don't you think you owe me
an apology?

469
00:26:29,958 --> 00:26:30,958
Well?

470
00:26:31,334 --> 00:26:32,334
I'm sorry.

471
00:26:34,834 --> 00:26:35,834
Well good,

472
00:26:36,585 --> 00:26:39,026
that's not the way to behave, okay?

473
00:26:46,212 --> 00:26:48,808
Now, it's all right,

474
00:26:50,183 --> 00:26:51,997
I'm not angry anymore.

475
00:27:03,021 --> 00:27:04,432
You're pretty.

476
00:27:08,542 --> 00:27:09,568
Well, thank you dear.

477
00:27:10,882 --> 00:27:11,882
Really pretty.

478
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:14,819
That's sweet of you to say.

479
00:27:16,946 --> 00:27:18,216
How old are you?

480
00:27:19,695 --> 00:27:22,699
Well, I'm the same age as your mother,

481
00:27:24,758 --> 00:27:25,838
how old is your mother?

482
00:27:26,071 --> 00:27:27,071
She's 32.

483
00:27:27,822 --> 00:27:28,822
I'm 28.

484
00:27:32,321 --> 00:27:35,094
Your hair is so beautiful,
you look like a princess.

485
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,534
Well, I don't know about that.

486
00:27:39,322 --> 00:27:40,322
Can I have some?

487
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:42,623
What?

488
00:27:43,632 --> 00:27:45,342
Can I have some of your hair?

489
00:27:48,329 --> 00:27:49,858
Glen... no!

490
00:27:50,118 --> 00:27:51,126
Just a little piece?

491
00:27:52,662 --> 00:27:54,059
You won't even miss it.

492
00:28:19,259 --> 00:28:20,763
Now off to bed with you,

493
00:28:22,733 --> 00:28:24,100
and no radio.

494
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:48,958
Good evening gentlemen.

495
00:28:49,927 --> 00:28:51,210
Walter, I'd like you to meet

496
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:52,996
my cousins, Charlotte and Wendy.

497
00:28:53,369 --> 00:28:55,454
Ladies, it's a pleasure.

498
00:28:56,429 --> 00:28:58,124
We were hoping you were
Pete's friends.

499
00:28:58,894 --> 00:29:00,619
You must be the man of steel.

500
00:29:00,993 --> 00:29:02,179
Will you look at that,

501
00:29:02,804 --> 00:29:05,216
you could lose a nickel
in those dimples.

502
00:29:08,665 --> 00:29:10,479
I thought your cousin Wendy
was a redhead.

503
00:29:11,239 --> 00:29:12,623
No, that's my cousin Doris,

504
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,817
she wasn't available this evening.

505
00:29:15,436 --> 00:29:18,154
Well, I think we can make do
with this branch of the family.

506
00:29:20,605 --> 00:29:22,217
I'm glad you decided to stay over.

507
00:29:22,426 --> 00:29:23,426
So am I.

508
00:29:24,549 --> 00:29:27,079
Bottle of champagne for the table,
and another round of these,

509
00:29:27,615 --> 00:29:28,619
plus one.

510
00:29:35,954 --> 00:29:38,113
You know, I had some thoughts

511
00:29:38,311 --> 00:29:39,383
about your campaign today.

512
00:29:39,936 --> 00:29:40,936
Did you?

513
00:29:41,509 --> 00:29:44,185
Well, I was trying to express

514
00:29:44,392 --> 00:29:45,973
the essentialness of steel,

515
00:29:46,233 --> 00:29:47,246
and I thought,

516
00:29:48,135 --> 00:29:49,535
"<i>Bethlehem Steel</i>",

517
00:29:50,415 --> 00:29:52,604
" the backbone of america",

518
00:29:53,203 --> 00:29:54,527
what do you think?

519
00:29:54,997 --> 00:29:55,997
Unbelievable!

520
00:29:56,173 --> 00:29:58,777
Did Draper tell you to try
and sneak this one by me?

521
00:29:59,037 --> 00:30:00,043
No, I was...

522
00:30:00,164 --> 00:30:01,822
Campbell, get off the clock.

523
00:30:02,907 --> 00:30:05,085
We have two lovely ladies here,

524
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,610
the only backbone
I'm interested in now

525
00:30:09,014 --> 00:30:10,506
is right here.

526
00:30:12,434 --> 00:30:14,042
So... tell me, Wendy,

527
00:30:14,624 --> 00:30:16,253
what do you do when you're not

528
00:30:16,515 --> 00:30:18,144
lighting up rooms with your smile?

529
00:30:19,641 --> 00:30:20,789
I'm an actress,

530
00:30:20,981 --> 00:30:22,509
and I take some classes at hunter.

531
00:30:23,001 --> 00:30:24,001
Do you?

532
00:30:24,435 --> 00:30:27,680
I would of thought you slept
all day and bathed in milk.

533
00:30:43,625 --> 00:30:44,625
How was it?

534
00:30:45,751 --> 00:30:47,577
It was nice, very quiet.

535
00:30:49,374 --> 00:30:51,021
In case you're interested.

536
00:30:52,952 --> 00:30:53,957
Thank you.

537
00:30:54,437 --> 00:30:55,610
I'll be sure to look at it.

538
00:30:56,309 --> 00:30:57,596
I can't thank you enough.

539
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,915
I hope that I can return
the favor sometime.

540
00:31:00,583 --> 00:31:02,687
Please, don't even think about it.

541
00:31:46,485 --> 00:31:47,662
Looks pretty familiar.

542
00:31:49,668 --> 00:31:52,636
Well, I wanted to maintain
our original strategy,

543
00:31:52,836 --> 00:31:55,407
but I think the word play
achieves what you're looking for,

544
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,733
the idea that from the acorn,
that is <i>Bethlehem Steel</i>,

545
00:31:59,114 --> 00:32:00,793
comes america's great cities.

546
00:32:01,469 --> 00:32:03,395
I know this isn't the idea
you want to sell me,

547
00:32:03,559 --> 00:32:04,886
so don't sell it so damn well.

548
00:32:07,996 --> 00:32:08,996
Excuse me?

549
00:32:09,808 --> 00:32:10,808
The backbone idea,

550
00:32:11,684 --> 00:32:13,365
Campbell pitched it to me last night.

551
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,060
I like it.

552
00:32:16,498 --> 00:32:18,337
What backbone idea?

553
00:32:18,633 --> 00:32:21,122
"<i>Bethlehem Steel</i>,
the backbone of America,"

554
00:32:21,979 --> 00:32:23,013
wasn't that it?

555
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,293
Right.

556
00:32:28,486 --> 00:32:30,864
It's concise, strong, and frankly,

557
00:32:31,177 --> 00:32:33,190
I like that you were so
enthusiastic about it,

558
00:32:33,378 --> 00:32:34,753
you couldn't wait to tell me.

559
00:32:40,786 --> 00:32:41,807
Thanks again, boys.

560
00:32:41,934 --> 00:32:43,434
Pleasure to make you happy, Walt.

561
00:32:43,809 --> 00:32:45,763
Hope your visit to New York
was productive.

562
00:32:46,061 --> 00:32:47,733
I'm warming to the place.

563
00:32:55,559 --> 00:32:56,559
Nice work.

564
00:32:57,621 --> 00:32:58,894
I told you I had ideas.

565
00:32:59,246 --> 00:33:00,246
Yes you did.

566
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,560
Good one,

567
00:33:03,058 --> 00:33:04,080
enjoy it.

568
00:33:06,308 --> 00:33:07,745
You know what I think?

569
00:33:08,499 --> 00:33:11,557
I think I did something good,
and you got the compliment for it.

570
00:33:14,622 --> 00:33:15,622
Listen Pete...

571
00:33:16,622 --> 00:33:19,411
I need you to go get
a cardboard box,

572
00:33:22,061 --> 00:33:23,333
put your things in it,

573
00:33:24,153 --> 00:33:25,163
okay?

574
00:33:35,711 --> 00:33:37,860
You picked the wrong time
to buy an apartment.

575
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,875
Everybody out...

576
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:01,700
now!

577
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:25,167
Remember Pete Campbell's last day?

578
00:34:26,375 --> 00:34:27,375
It's today.

579
00:34:27,873 --> 00:34:28,873
What happened?

580
00:34:29,061 --> 00:34:31,919
While I was breaking my neck trying
to fix the hash he made yesterday,

581
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:34,115
he was out at the St. Regis
pitching copy...

582
00:34:35,748 --> 00:34:36,748
His copy!

583
00:34:38,376 --> 00:34:39,376
That little shit.

584
00:35:11,186 --> 00:35:13,186
It was hard to see her,

585
00:35:13,759 --> 00:35:15,333
all alone like that,

586
00:35:16,936 --> 00:35:20,761
supporting herself with that
sad little job at the jewelry store,

587
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:23,750
frozen food.

588
00:35:25,939 --> 00:35:28,126
I mean I know she gets
some kind of help, but

589
00:35:28,895 --> 00:35:31,454
still, she looks so exhausted.

590
00:35:33,377 --> 00:35:35,454
She tries to put on a brave face.

591
00:35:51,437 --> 00:35:53,615
Honestly, I think she's jealous of me.

592
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:58,020
I've seen it before,
I was in a sority.

593
00:36:01,128 --> 00:36:04,243
I mean, seeing happy
families all around,

594
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:10,074
but I don't know what I can do, I mean,
I can't just disappear, I live there.

595
00:36:14,942 --> 00:36:17,760
Of course, my real concern
is those children.

596
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:23,231
I mean, the baby won't know the
difference but that poor little boy.

597
00:36:29,689 --> 00:36:32,697
The person taking care of him
isn't giving him what he needs.

598
00:36:36,125 --> 00:36:37,125
You know?

599
00:36:59,172 --> 00:37:00,635
Gentlemen, please.

600
00:37:06,238 --> 00:37:07,465
You really love that thing.

601
00:37:08,051 --> 00:37:09,993
You were cute back then.

602
00:37:16,675 --> 00:37:17,675
Pete Campbell?

603
00:37:19,676 --> 00:37:20,676
On his way out.

604
00:37:21,111 --> 00:37:22,398
Sorry to hear that.

605
00:37:22,996 --> 00:37:24,406
Well, can't be avoided, I'm afraid.

606
00:37:24,588 --> 00:37:26,332
I wish I could agree with that.

607
00:37:27,927 --> 00:37:29,476
He's a junior account executive

608
00:37:29,799 --> 00:37:31,935
who brought his own idea
to a client,

609
00:37:32,229 --> 00:37:33,233
in a bar!

610
00:37:34,802 --> 00:37:35,802
There are rules.

611
00:37:36,548 --> 00:37:38,098
There are other rules.

612
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:41,490
What's the problem?

613
00:37:44,036 --> 00:37:47,054
New York city is a marvelous machine,

614
00:37:47,397 --> 00:37:49,391
filled with a mesh of levers

615
00:37:49,719 --> 00:37:51,598
and gears and springs,

616
00:37:51,798 --> 00:37:54,793
like a fine watch wound tight,

617
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:57,846
always ticking.

618
00:37:58,238 --> 00:37:59,581
Sounds more like a bomb.

619
00:37:59,929 --> 00:38:01,789
How much do you know
about Pete's family?

620
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:05,206
Nothing, except they put out
a mediocre product.

621
00:38:05,436 --> 00:38:08,078
His mother is
Dorothy Dikeman Campbell,

622
00:38:08,739 --> 00:38:12,917
the Dikemans owned pretty much
everything north of 125th street,

623
00:38:13,116 --> 00:38:15,300
which I don't know how good
your geography is,

624
00:38:15,487 --> 00:38:17,548
but that's a fair chunk of the island.

625
00:38:17,965 --> 00:38:19,867
So they're rich, so what?

626
00:38:20,174 --> 00:38:21,174
Well, no...

627
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:25,463
His grandfather dropped it
all in '29... panicked.

628
00:38:27,113 --> 00:38:30,013
Some people have
no confidence in this country.

629
00:38:32,738 --> 00:38:33,874
What's your concern then?

630
00:38:34,323 --> 00:38:37,352
Well, I don't want
Dorothy Dikeman Campbell

631
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:40,281
standing on the dock at
Fisher's island this summer,

632
00:38:40,481 --> 00:38:43,789
talking about how badly
<i>Sterling Cooper</i> treated her son.

633
00:38:44,925 --> 00:38:46,470
I don't think any of us want that.

634
00:38:46,926 --> 00:38:47,926
We lose him,

635
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:50,576
we lose our entree to

636
00:38:50,787 --> 00:38:53,722
Buckley deak, the Maid stone club,

637
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:56,469
the Century club, dartmouth,

638
00:38:58,113 --> 00:38:59,808
Gracie mansion sometimes.

639
00:39:01,241 --> 00:39:02,981
It's a marquee issue for us.

640
00:39:04,927 --> 00:39:05,927
See my point?

641
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:08,239
Absolutely.

642
00:39:09,425 --> 00:39:11,379
He's more valuable
to the agency than I am.

643
00:39:11,804 --> 00:39:12,807
Don't fool yourself,

644
00:39:13,006 --> 00:39:15,965
there's a Pete Campbell
at every agency out there.

645
00:39:16,515 --> 00:39:18,159
Well, let's get one
of the other ones.

646
00:39:18,454 --> 00:39:20,121
You're going to need
a stronger stomach,

647
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:21,972
if you're going to be
back in the kitchen

648
00:39:22,137 --> 00:39:24,133
seeing how the sausage is made.

649
00:39:27,177 --> 00:39:28,635
Thought it was a big watch.

650
00:39:31,427 --> 00:39:33,254
You handle the words,

651
00:39:34,488 --> 00:39:37,766
you know how much
we want you here with us.

652
00:39:38,489 --> 00:39:39,489
No doubt about that.

653
00:39:41,178 --> 00:39:42,639
Don's a big boy, Burt...

654
00:39:44,239 --> 00:39:45,239
Aren't you Don?

655
00:39:51,992 --> 00:39:53,831
Well, thank you, sir.

656
00:39:56,428 --> 00:39:57,428
There you go!

657
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:04,149
I'm glad we're all better now.

658
00:40:28,302 --> 00:40:31,231
what you did...
is totally unacceptable.

659
00:40:31,518 --> 00:40:32,528
I realize that.

660
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:35,178
I want you to be very clear
about this, you were fired.

661
00:40:35,427 --> 00:40:37,757
I wanted you out,
Cooper wanted you out,

662
00:40:38,366 --> 00:40:40,998
and you would be
if it weren't for this man.

663
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,512
He thought you deserved
another chance.

664
00:40:45,774 --> 00:40:46,807
That's right,

665
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:48,627
he fought for you.

666
00:40:48,886 --> 00:40:49,896
I don't know what to say.

667
00:40:50,214 --> 00:40:51,729
Say nothing. You're here,

668
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:54,488
because of Don Draper's largess.

669
00:40:54,929 --> 00:40:56,293
Thank you- thank you so much.

670
00:40:56,709 --> 00:40:58,708
Now, I know that your generation
went to college

671
00:40:58,872 --> 00:41:00,645
instead of serving,
so I'll illuminate you,

672
00:41:00,762 --> 00:41:02,509
this man is your commanding officer,

673
00:41:03,064 --> 00:41:06,117
you live and die in his shadow,
understood?

674
00:41:10,305 --> 00:41:12,680
- I won't let you down, Don.
- Jesus, Campbell!

675
00:41:14,554 --> 00:41:15,852
Don't ever say that.

676
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:33,503
I bet daily friendship
with that bottle

677
00:41:33,682 --> 00:41:35,428
attracts more people to advertising

678
00:41:35,682 --> 00:41:37,272
than any salary you could dream of.

679
00:41:37,929 --> 00:41:38,929
That's why I got in.

680
00:41:40,058 --> 00:41:41,058
So enjoy it.

681
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:43,620
Doing my best here.

682
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,120
Enough!

683
00:41:45,318 --> 00:41:47,420
You don't know how to drink,
your whole generation.

684
00:41:47,631 --> 00:41:49,134
You drink for the wrong reasons.

685
00:41:49,619 --> 00:41:50,937
My generation,

686
00:41:51,724 --> 00:41:53,274
we drink because it's good,

687
00:41:53,828 --> 00:41:56,141
because it feels better than
unbuttoning your collar,

688
00:41:56,388 --> 00:41:58,302
because we deserve it.

689
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:01,089
We drink because it's what men do.

690
00:42:01,728 --> 00:42:02,773
What about shaky hands?

691
00:42:02,974 --> 00:42:04,542
I see a lot of that too
with you boys.

692
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:05,702
No joke.

693
00:42:06,006 --> 00:42:08,989
Your kind, with your gloomy
thoughts and your worries,

694
00:42:09,414 --> 00:42:12,268
you're all busy licking
some imaginary wound.

695
00:42:13,103 --> 00:42:14,319
Not all imaginary.

696
00:42:14,788 --> 00:42:15,788
Yeah, boo hoo.

697
00:42:18,603 --> 00:42:21,121
Maybe I'm not as comfortable
being powerless as you are.

698
00:42:25,103 --> 00:42:26,103
Pardon?

699
00:42:30,061 --> 00:42:32,221
You know, you shouldn't compete
with Pete Campbell.

700
00:42:32,409 --> 00:42:33,780
- I'm not.
- Yeah, you are.

701
00:42:35,416 --> 00:42:37,849
Not on a personal level,
but for the world.

702
00:42:45,477 --> 00:42:46,976
I don't know, maybe every generation

703
00:42:47,171 --> 00:42:49,034
thinks the next one
is the end of it all.

704
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:00,176
I bet there were people in the bible

705
00:43:00,916 --> 00:43:02,916
walking around complaining
about kids today.

706
00:43:06,541 --> 00:43:08,586
Kids today, they have
no one to look up to...

707
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:12,199
Cause they're looking up to us.

708
00:43:19,470 --> 00:43:21,595
Of course, if you're not going to
have live-in help,

709
00:43:21,665 --> 00:43:23,849
that back room can be used
for any number of things.

710
00:43:23,931 --> 00:43:25,364
I don't think we'll be having
live-in help

711
00:43:25,464 --> 00:43:26,602
just yet, do you sweetheart?

712
00:43:26,789 --> 00:43:29,278
No, I think we'll be managing
on our own for now.

713
00:43:33,338 --> 00:43:35,675
I'm so glad you could come.

714
00:43:36,105 --> 00:43:37,968
I'd like you to meet
Mrs. Clifford Lyman,

715
00:43:38,063 --> 00:43:39,507
she'll be one of your new neighbors,

716
00:43:39,654 --> 00:43:40,998
and she's on the co-op board.

717
00:43:41,355 --> 00:43:42,846
Of course, you know these two.

718
00:43:43,399 --> 00:43:44,512
Where's the nursery at?

719
00:43:44,646 --> 00:43:45,656
Thank you, Tom.

720
00:43:45,726 --> 00:43:47,218
Now, I don't want to hear that again.

721
00:43:47,347 --> 00:43:49,912
Mrs. Lyman, Trudy Campbell,
so nice to meet you.

722
00:43:50,356 --> 00:43:52,932
Well aren't you darling,
the two of you.

723
00:43:53,274 --> 00:43:54,296
A pleasure.

724
00:43:54,543 --> 00:43:56,753
Now, I know I shouldn't ask,
but I have to,

725
00:43:57,042 --> 00:43:58,621
your mother in-law
was just telling me

726
00:43:58,793 --> 00:44:00,611
that your great-great grandfather

727
00:44:00,791 --> 00:44:03,442
was a farmer with Isaac Roosevelt,
is that right?

728
00:44:04,648 --> 00:44:05,775
Yes, that's true.

729
00:44:06,886 --> 00:44:09,257
That was Nicholas Dikeman, right?

730
00:44:09,678 --> 00:44:10,918
On his mother's side.

731
00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:14,131
Can you imagine, orchards
on 204th street?

732
00:44:15,061 --> 00:44:17,445
He's buried at the church
of the intersession.

733
00:44:17,731 --> 00:44:18,731
My goodness,

734
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:20,193
wait until I tell my husband

735
00:44:20,356 --> 00:44:23,950
there's going to be a Dikeman living
in the building, he'll be so thrilled.

736
00:44:24,729 --> 00:44:26,520
Sweetheart, tell
Mrs. Lyman the story

737
00:44:26,673 --> 00:44:28,223
about your great-great aunt

738
00:44:28,416 --> 00:44:31,044
getting in that fight with
the british soldier and the hessians.

739
00:44:31,435 --> 00:44:32,480
You tell it dear,

740
00:44:32,668 --> 00:44:34,284
you tell it so much better than I do.

741
00:44:35,168 --> 00:44:38,306
Well, I think it was
his great-great aunt, or

742
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:40,023
great-great-great, I'm not sure,

743
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:42,478
but it was before
the revolutionary war,

744
00:44:42,667 --> 00:44:44,956
and the Dikemans owned
a large tract of land...
