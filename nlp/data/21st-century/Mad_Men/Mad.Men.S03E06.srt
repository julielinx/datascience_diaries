1
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:49,911
Daddy, don't.

2
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:56,454
It's 10:30. Why aren't you asleep?

3
00:00:56,923 --> 00:00:59,221
- I'm afraid.
- Sally.

4
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:02,353
I know. You're not Thomas Edison.

5
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:05,628
What are you afraid of?

6
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:09,759
I'm afraid of what's going to happen
when you turn off the lights.

7
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,340
I'm home now.

8
00:01:17,444 --> 00:01:19,207
Nothing can hurt you.

9
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:23,813
Except maybe this mess.

10
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,549
Pick up your room,
we'll get you a nightlight.

11
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:28,712
Okay.

12
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:32,856
Go to sleep.

13
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:49,608
- What did you find out?
- Nothing.

14
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:51,802
I bet they're gonna make us work
over the holiday.

15
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:56,871
- And Cosgrove's late.
- Can we have everyone's attention, please?

16
00:01:58,184 --> 00:02:01,711
This will only take a moment,
and it will not be repeated.

17
00:02:01,821 --> 00:02:03,914
That's not true, Mr. Hooker.

18
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:07,618
We've just been informed
that there will be a visit

19
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:11,925
from the director and chairman of the board
of Putnam, Powell & Lowe,

20
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,934
the purpose of which is both friendly

21
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:18,970
and, of course,
to evaluate our performance.

22
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:23,166
- Mr. Hooker.
- The visit will commence tomorrow,

23
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:27,474
that is Tuesday, at 10:00
and will continue into the next day.

24
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:31,878
We apologize. We realize we were
to be closed Wednesday, July 3rd, but...

25
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,213
Come on.

26
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,522
They were unaware of the holiday.

27
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:43,758
Now we merely need
that everyone continue to operate

28
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:47,094
at the height of their productivity
and to make sure

29
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,330
that their desks and offices
are shipshape and Bristol fashion.

30
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:55,039
And by no means
should these preparations

31
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:58,440
interfere with our work today.
Very good, then.

32
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:01,980
Don, may we have a word?

33
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:11,857
Well, isn't this perfect?

34
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:17,324
Well, we'll just move it from lunch
to the end of the day.

35
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:20,422
I'm having a cake delivered.
How's that going to look?

36
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:22,091
A cake for what?

37
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:24,293
Tomorrow is Joan's last day. I told you that.

38
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:27,032
But if we're working on Wednesday,
wouldn't that be her last day?

39
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,505
I don't know why she'd come in.

40
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:31,873
Greg finds out about his residency
today or tomorrow. I'm not sure.

41
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:33,878
I think they're going away to celebrate.

42
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,471
I'm going to get some money.
We should buy her something.

43
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:41,743
Harry and Pete, we will need presentations
for Wednesday morning

44
00:03:41,854 --> 00:03:44,880
on the state of television,
and, of course, account updates.

45
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:47,289
- Just a few minutes each.
- On each account?

46
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,793
No, a few minutes for each of you.

47
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,665
And Mr. Kinsey,
you might want to shave your beard.

48
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:56,166
What? Who the hell are you people?

49
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,795
That was a joke.

50
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,236
There's no need for panic.

51
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:08,781
Just think of this as the same
as any major client visit.

52
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:11,850
They're flying across the ocean
to have their knobs polished?

53
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:13,942
Fourth of July. Subtle.

54
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:17,882
- Get the door, will you?
- The British are coming.

55
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:24,088
I assume you know what this is about.

56
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:28,898
I have a theory.
I believe they're coming to see you.

57
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:30,324
Why?

58
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:32,597
They've shown a great deal
of interest in you.

59
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:36,300
Ever since you swung around your privates
in the boardroom with Duck last year.

60
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:39,674
They study and dissect your work,
trying to decipher

61
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:42,577
what is your particular American genius.

62
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:50,719
- What do you think it is? The presidency?
- No, I think it'll be a creative umbrella

63
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:53,690
with a dual position
in London and New York.

64
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:57,095
- London?
- Bye-bye, Don.

65
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,895
How congenial you two are.

66
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:05,300
I hope you can maintain this pretense
when they arrive.

67
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:06,702
Excuse me?

68
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:10,968
Kiss and make up
before you cost us all something.

69
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:14,807
- You're being melodramatic.
- Miss Blankenship,

70
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:19,983
please make an appointment at Angelo's
for Misters Sterling and Draper,

71
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:23,252
the soonest available.

72
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:25,722
- I have my own barber.
- That's not necessary.

73
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:28,988
Enough. Everyone wants Martin and Lewis.

74
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,227
Reconcile.

75
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:38,397
Damn it!

76
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:53,915
It's done! John Deere is done.
The 110 lawn and garden tractor

77
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,888
with snow thrower and transparent
vinyl enclosure, and a key.

78
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:02,826
Look at him. He just brought in a mastodon.

79
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:06,825
Sorry I'm late.

80
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,558
Big accounts move slowly,
but the John Deere doesn't.

81
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:13,537
Listen, Mr. Clampett. You might want to get
your iron horse out of reception.

82
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:15,402
I will, after everybody sees it.

83
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:18,102
- No, P.P.L. Is coming.
- When?

84
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:20,738
- Tomorrow morning.
- And we have to work Wednesday.

85
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:24,715
- We have to give presentations.
- You got that one just in time.

86
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:27,180
Yeah, I guess I did.

87
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,218
She's in here!

88
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:42,091
I'm resting,
and your little brother's sleeping.

89
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,331
All he does is sleep.

90
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:48,002
- What are you doing?
- I'm bored.

91
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:51,637
- Go bang your head against a wall.
- Mom.

92
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,905
Only boring people are bored.

93
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:57,744
- Can I pet him?
- Don't wake him.

94
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:04,379
Come over here.

95
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,620
Go play.

96
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:18,466
You can sleep all you want,
little pig in a blanket.

97
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:23,238
That is quite a shave.

98
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:27,637
I'm thinking about my toes right now.

99
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:30,107
- Go to town.
- He's next.

100
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:34,381
- I already had one.
- See, that's not true.

101
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,211
You think
there's something feminine about it?

102
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:41,259
My father was the tallest, handsomest,
vainest man in New York,

103
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,351
and he got his nails done.

104
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:51,029
He had his fourth coronary
behind the wheel and hit a tree.

105
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:53,732
The windshield severed his arm,

106
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:57,101
and he was dead,
so they never put it back on.

107
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:00,873
In the casket he had one hand.
The nails were perfect.

108
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:06,484
- I don't believe that story.
- Okay, so he hit another car and not a tree.

109
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:14,054
It's my company. Why should I be nervous?

110
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:16,356
Because you sold it.

111
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:19,961
So that's it? That's what I did to you?
I got you a half-million dollars?

112
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:23,763
- I'm really sorry about that.
- No one said you did anything.

113
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:26,672
You sound like Burl Ives.

114
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,670
Part of the problem with Mona

115
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:36,105
is that one day
she just started judging people.

116
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,340
Never gave a crap before.

117
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:43,383
I'll tell you right now, Don.
I don't like being judged.

118
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:47,320
Listen, Roger... I'm okay, Angelo.

119
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:54,229
We don't need to talk about this anymore.
I promise.

120
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,634
I was holding out for gratitude,
but I'll take that.

121
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,937
Thank you.

122
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:06,674
Well, maybe now you'll have the money
and the glory.

123
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:10,873
Call the photographers,
type service and vendors

124
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:13,451
and tell them all deliveries should come
between 9:30 and 11:00

125
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:17,080
so the British can see lots of activity
when they arrive.

126
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:18,314
Now.

127
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:22,285
Are you being short with me
because you think it'll make parting easier?

128
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,386
My mother used to do that.

129
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:28,122
I'm noticing for the first time
that the ladies out here are rather plain,

130
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:31,567
- present company excluded.
- Well, we could hire some prostitutes.

131
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:34,731
I know your prime minister
enjoys their company.

132
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:36,273
The secretary of war,

133
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,206
and you'd do best
not to bring that up tomorrow.

134
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:41,041
- I apologize.
- Well, I apologize that tomorrow's visit

135
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:43,240
will steal from your spotlight.

136
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:46,944
Perhaps we can reschedule
your surprise party till after the holiday?

137
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:48,816
Why did you do that?

138
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:53,586
Do what? Mrs. Harris knows everything.
I'm sure she was expecting it.

139
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:58,557
I'm going to go home and make
a celebratory dinner for my husband.

140
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:00,325
And when you wake up
in the middle of the night

141
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,300
and wonder what you forgot, don't call me.

142
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:17,677
- Well, that's smooth.
- I got a shave.

143
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:21,148
- Why?
- They ordered me to do it.

144
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:24,454
We have an inspection tomorrow.
The British.

145
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:26,821
Well, you look very successful.

146
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:31,489
Hot or cold?
Swedish meatballs or chicken salad?

147
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:34,199
Chicken salad.

148
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:37,835
Did you pick up a nightlight?

149
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:42,271
I did, and I read her to sleep.
She was still clingy.

150
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:46,203
I don't remember her being that resentful
of Bobby when he was born.

151
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:50,271
- I don't know that she resents him.
- Well, she won't go near him.

152
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:54,277
She won't even go in his room
unless I make her.

153
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:58,015
- Why are they visiting?
- We don't know.

154
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:01,826
Delayed everybody's vacation plans.

155
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:05,659
He was perfect today.

156
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,497
- Who?
- Gene.

157
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:14,665
Would you ever want to live in London?

158
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,208
I'm serious.

159
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:23,408
Of course.
I could get a pram and a real nanny.

160
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:28,145
- What do you know?
- Nothing.

161
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:55,580
Where the hell were you?

162
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:59,709
I told you I was going for drinks
with the docs.

163
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:02,387
You didn't tell me anything.
You didn't call me.

164
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:07,425
- I called you at work.
- That's a lie. I just ate dinner for two.

165
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:12,230
Get over here.

166
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:20,067
I know you're drunk. Come sit next to me.

167
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:33,776
So what happened?

168
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:36,812
I...

169
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:41,884
I didn't get it.

170
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:45,096
What happened?

171
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:54,561
It doesn't say anything

172
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:58,006
except that they made Doug Hutchinson
chief resident.

173
00:12:58,577 --> 00:13:01,171
And I felt the floor open up under me.

174
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:09,380
So you'll get it next year.
You knew it was possible.

175
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:15,256
I ran into Eddinger
about a half-hour before the letter came,

176
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:20,426
and I could tell something was wrong.
He wouldn't look me in the eye.

177
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:23,459
I figured he felt bad

178
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:26,697
and I'd at least find out
what the hell happened.

179
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:33,338
- But he didn't feel bad.
- What are you talking about? He loves you.

180
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:43,683
He sat me down in his office
and he poured a drink and he said...

181
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:55,692
He said I had no brains in my fingers.

182
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,969
But he wrote you
all those nice evaluations...

183
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:06,943
Damn it, Joan! Doctors don't write
bad things about each other.

184
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:14,949
- So you'll go to another hospital.
- Not in New York.

185
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:18,989
If I want to stay in surgery,
I can go to Alabama or something.

186
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:36,972
So what happens?
You're still a doctor, right?

187
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:38,334
I am.

188
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:44,849
I'm just not a surgeon,
and I will never be a surgeon.

189
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:52,046
- Did they fire you?
- I don't want to talk about it, Joanie, okay?

190
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,721
I was hoping you were asleep.

191
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:03,628
I have another year of residency.
You're not gonna be able to leave your job.

192
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:08,472
- Greg, that's done.
- Well, get another one.

193
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:11,702
Honey.

194
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:20,678
Listen.

195
00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:23,752
You are still a doctor.

196
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,859
I married you for your heart,
not your hands.

197
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:34,628
They all went out to celebrate.

198
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:38,998
I couldn't do it. I just couldn't do it.
I couldn't fake it.

199
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:43,267
I've been sitting in the Dublin House
since 2:00.

200
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:51,540
Go lay down. I'll undress you.
Just let me close the light.

201
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:28,083
Mr. Hooker, you neglected to tell me
that our guests have arrived.

202
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:29,279
To what do I owe the pleasure?

203
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:32,755
This is Mrs. Harris.
She was the office manager before me,

204
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:34,621
but she is off to greener pastures.

205
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:38,060
- Well, that's a shame. Guy MacKendrick.
- Joan Harris.

206
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:43,663
This is Mr. Harold Ford.
And you recall Saint John Powell.

207
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:46,427
- We've spoken on the phone.
- I believe that's true.

208
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:49,701
I just wanted to tell you,
I made a reservation at La Grenouille at 6:00

209
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:53,141
<i>and got you two tickets to Oliver!
It's a wonderful show.</i>

210
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:56,214
I've heard that.
A tragedy with a happy ending.

211
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:57,907
My favorite kind.

212
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:01,619
Thank you, Joan.
Shall I give you the threepenny tour?

213
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:08,486
Please let everyone know that they're here.

214
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:11,791
We have you scheduled to meet
with Sterling, Cooper and Draper,

215
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:13,364
and then with Mr. Pryce, of course,

216
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:15,729
and then a light lunch
in the conference room

217
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:17,768
with the personnel you requested.

218
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,930
Tomorrow, the presentations
and client meetings.

219
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:26,336
- Saint John, good to see you again.
- Peter Campbell. This is Guy MacKendrick.

220
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:29,676
I know everything about you.
You're a very impressive fellow.

221
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:34,151
- I wish I could return the compliment.
- Well, perhaps one day you shall.

222
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:42,259
Good morning, gentlemen.

223
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:45,897
- Hello.
- Miss Olson, one of our copywriters.

224
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:49,225
I know everything about you.
You are a very impressive young woman.

225
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:52,167
Why, thank you. I was just writing copy.

226
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,540
- As you were.
- I hope we chat later.

227
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:02,508
Mr. Draper is waiting for you
in Mr. Cooper's office.

228
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:03,911
This way.

229
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:10,280
That is a very handsome man.

230
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:22,996
- Good to see all of you.
- It's a pleasure.

231
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:26,496
Don, no worse for wear, I see.

232
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:29,506
What a delightful custom.
From the Far East, I assume?

233
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,599
- Japan.
- How was your trip?

234
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:36,674
Gentlemen, I'd like you to meet Harold Ford,
and this young man is Guy MacKendrick.

235
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,113
Mr. Cooper.

236
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:42,216
- Mr. Sterling, what an honor.
- Call me Roger.

237
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:44,721
- And you must be Don Draper.
- I am.

238
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:47,753
I can't tell you how exciting it is
to finally meet you.

239
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,725
That's very flattering.

240
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:53,626
Guy here has done a study of your work,
which is quite a compliment.

241
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:56,860
You see,
in addition to his inestimable charm,

242
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,335
Guy here has degrees
from Cambridge University

243
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:01,065
and the London School of Economics.

244
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:02,640
Three years at the Bank,
two years at McCann,

245
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:05,437
and his most recent coup, Mercedes-Benz.

246
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,079
- That's very impressive.
- I apologize.

247
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:12,276
I didn't realize he was going to recite
my entire curriculum vitae.

248
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:16,511
- You left out modest.
- Well, we're going to debrief Mr. Pryce,

249
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:18,590
and the plan is for you
to join us for luncheon.

250
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:23,127
- In the conference room at 1:00.
- Sounds like Agatha Christie.

251
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:26,493
Well, apparently our tour continues.

252
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:29,032
I look forward to... How do you say?
Catching up?

253
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:30,431
I as well.

254
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:35,504
Well, that was strange.

255
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:42,776
Look at that. The suspense is killing him.

256
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:49,411
Yes?

257
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:58,361
Mr. Powell and Mr. Ford are here to see you.

258
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:04,496
- Spectacles.
- Right.

259
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,974
Send them in.

260
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:16,239
- Gentlemen.
- Greetings, Saint John.

261
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:18,883
Harold, what a pleasure.

262
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:21,179
Please see to it
that Guy has a space to prepare.

263
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:25,052
- Right away.
- Gentlemen. There's coffee and cake.

264
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:38,032
We're very impressed, Lane.
Very, very impressed indeed.

265
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:42,538
In nine months,
you've trimmed every bit of excess,

266
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:46,077
increased billings,
and we haven't heard a word of complaint.

267
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:48,646
<i>Yes, well, Pax Romana and all that.</i>

268
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:51,147
Bravo. We've decided
to offer you something

269
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,583
that we hope you'll view
as a reward and a challenge.

270
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:58,855
- Is it in the box?
- In a manner of speaking.

271
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:03,488
Open it.

272
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:13,531
What is that? It looks like a snake.

273
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:17,205
Fancy that.

274
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,840
- Is it real?
- It was.

275
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:32,045
It's for our snake charmer.
We're sending you to Bombay.

276
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:35,553
Bombay? What would I do there?

277
00:21:36,261 --> 00:21:39,594
Well, hopefully the same thing
you accomplished here.

278
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,837
Where shall I put this?

279
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,813
I guess I needn't find a spot for it
if I'm simply moving again.

280
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,978
Don't pout.

281
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:06,546
One of your greatest qualities
is you always do as you're told.

282
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:09,126
No, it's just the logistics.

283
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:12,660
My wife just settled,
my son just accepted to school,

284
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:16,165
- and now we're moving on?
- Nonsense. You're moving up.

285
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:23,834
That's the spirit.

286
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:36,644
So, without further ado,
I will give the floor to Guy MacKendrick.

287
00:22:38,056 --> 00:22:40,718
Let me begin by offering
my warmest wishes and admiration

288
00:22:40,826 --> 00:22:44,785
for Lane Pryce and his exemplary work.
It'll be hard to lose him,

289
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:48,127
but there's no doubt
that our loss is India's gain.

290
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:00,775
Now, let me say
there's no cause for anxiety.

291
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:04,007
There will be no further reductions
in the ranks.

292
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,214
Yes, that's good news.

293
00:23:07,185 --> 00:23:11,315
If I might, I'd like to walk you through
this slight reorganization.

294
00:23:15,827 --> 00:23:19,024
As before,
P.P.L. London will be the head of this body,

295
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:22,999
and Sterling Cooper, now more than ever,
our American presence.

296
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:26,237
Our business maturity
with your creative edge.

297
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:31,705
A triumvirate of Don and myself
and Mr. Cooper, our chairman emeritus,

298
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:36,240
will oversee three streamlined departments.
Creative, art and copy.

299
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:42,277
Account management, that's Mr. Cosgrove,
Mr. Campbell for the present,

300
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:46,255
and a combined televisionlmedia
department headed by Mr. Crane.

301
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:49,827
Mr. Sterling's not on that chart at all.

302
00:23:53,231 --> 00:23:56,029
- That's true.
- Well, that was an oversight.

303
00:23:58,036 --> 00:24:00,334
As you can see,
nothing much has really changed.

304
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:04,535
Frankly, my presence here
is just to ensure thorough communication,

305
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:07,872
that we help each other
on both sides of the pond.

306
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,147
Whether it be a sharing of creative genius,

307
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,284
media savvy,

308
00:24:16,321 --> 00:24:19,222
or the unbridled acquisition
of new business.

309
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:22,252
I'm sure you all have a thousand questions.

310
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:26,855
But for the time being,
I say we inform the troops,

311
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:29,934
so that the transition
can begin immediately after the holiday.

312
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:32,799
- Shall I have Mr. Hooker prepare a memo?
- No. Nonsense.

313
00:24:32,904 --> 00:24:36,704
I don't want this to be the kind of place
where such news is delivered that way.

314
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,036
Shall we?

315
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,711
Gosh, we're really going to miss you.

316
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,326
- What the hell just happened?
- They reorganized us,

317
00:24:57,429 --> 00:25:00,091
and you're the only one in this room
who got a promotion.

318
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:02,962
- Really?
- Yes, really.

319
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:09,201
I apologize for my wild imagination.

320
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:18,273
See? It's clean.

321
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:24,053
That's not what I want to talk to you about.

322
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:34,162
What's this?

323
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,235
It's for you.

324
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:41,432
"For my new big sister,
the best in the world. "

325
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,100
And my goodness, it's from baby Gene.

326
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:48,236
Look.

327
00:25:57,188 --> 00:25:59,019
Baby Gene can't write.

328
00:26:01,026 --> 00:26:04,086
Babies get fairies to do things.
You know that.

329
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:10,792
It's really from him. I'm not kidding.
I think you should open it.

330
00:26:27,652 --> 00:26:29,882
- What is it?
- It's a Barbie.

331
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:42,496
I think he wants you to know
that he wants to be your friend.

332
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:49,666
And you are very important to me, too.

333
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:15,158
I'm sure you all have a thousand questions,

334
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:18,960
but before I raise a glass
to Sterling Cooper's future,

335
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:21,561
I should like to recognize its past.

336
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:26,869
Most recently,
the inspired stewardship of Lane Pryce.

337
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:28,376
Hear! Hear!

338
00:27:30,615 --> 00:27:33,743
I'm also aware
of a rather significant milestone.

339
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:39,847
Mrs. Harris,
from those who've known you only hours

340
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:43,655
to those who have cherished
your nearly 10 years of service,

341
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:51,134
I wish you caviar and children
and all that is good in your new life.

342
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:56,868
There, there. That wasn't my intention.

343
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:05,010
Mrs. Harris, please.

344
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:19,586
We'll have our presentations tomorrow.
Let this afternoon be a fete worthy of Joan.

345
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:22,098
Enjoy the liquor and delicatessen.

346
00:28:27,572 --> 00:28:30,006
Thank you. Thank you all.

347
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:35,138
- This is completely unnecessary.
- You'll be sorely missed.

348
00:28:36,147 --> 00:28:37,876
We got you the cake.

349
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,210
Well...

350
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:51,219
So, what now?
They keep adding people above us.

351
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:56,092
One more promotion
and we're gonna be answering phones.

352
00:28:59,971 --> 00:29:01,700
We should go say hi.

353
00:29:07,378 --> 00:29:11,041
- This is good champagne.
- I don't think so.

354
00:29:14,152 --> 00:29:16,552
I'm going to get something to eat.

355
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:29,193
Mr. Draper,
Conrad Hilton's office is on the line.

356
00:29:30,635 --> 00:29:33,661
- What?
- Conrad Hilton, the hotel owner.

357
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:36,432
Yeah, I know what he does.
Why is he calling?

358
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:37,940
I don't know.

359
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:41,307
- And he's calling for me?
- Yes. Well, his office is.

360
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:44,672
Put him through.

361
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:54,186
<i>- Donald Draper.
- Mr. Draper, this is Miss Wakeman.</i>

362
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:57,485
<i>Mr. Hilton has expressed a desire
to meet with you.</i>

363
00:29:57,595 --> 00:29:58,857
May I ask what this is regarding?

364
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:02,023
<i>I just set his schedule.
When are you available?</i>

365
00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:08,330
<i>- How about right now?
- Right now? Please hold.</i>

366
00:30:12,577 --> 00:30:16,946
<i>- How far are you from the Waldorf Astoria?
- Fifteen minutes.</i>

367
00:30:17,515 --> 00:30:19,608
<i>It's the presidential suite.</i>

368
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:22,776
I'm on my way.

369
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:39,859
- Where's Miss Blankenship?
- She's down there saluting Union Jack.

370
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:43,669
- What is that?
- Chocolate pudding.

371
00:30:47,378 --> 00:30:51,075
I wasn't even on the chart.
My name's on the wall out there.

372
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:54,476
- You want some?
- No.

373
00:30:55,553 --> 00:30:58,681
I like to think, "I'm rich. They can't hurt me. "

374
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:03,185
That's a mistake.

375
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:07,221
I'm being punished
for making my job look easy.

376
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:14,102
Although that kid, Guy, he has a spark.
He is a pure account man.

377
00:31:15,073 --> 00:31:17,337
And what is that job all about?

378
00:31:19,477 --> 00:31:22,071
I don't know. It's about listening to people

379
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:24,671
and never saying
what's really on your mind.

380
00:31:24,782 --> 00:31:28,616
No. It's about letting things go
so you can get what you want.

381
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:36,722
Have a nice holiday. Enjoy the fireworks.

382
00:31:37,795 --> 00:31:40,958
We took their money.
We have to do what they say.

383
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:57,247
My dad keeps talking about Vietnam.
I think he wants me to get drafted.

384
00:31:58,016 --> 00:32:02,646
First of all, they're hardly drafting anybody.
Second of all, you're too old.

385
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:09,390
Third of all, I have a friend in the army,
and if you're smart, you're set.

386
00:32:09,494 --> 00:32:13,453
He sits behind a desk at Fort Dix
and screws secretaries all day.

387
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:18,329
- Does he shoot the peoples?
- I don't know. I gotta take a piss.

388
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:24,802
- Joan.
- Yes?

389
00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:27,275
- May I speak with you?
- Thank you.

390
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:34,445
I just...
I wanted to get you a card or a present.

391
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,615
It'd be nice if I gave you a gift for once

392
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:40,282
and you didn't wonder
if I wanted something.

393
00:32:40,391 --> 00:32:42,086
Knock yourself out.

394
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:46,221
I don't want you to think
I never listen to you.

395
00:32:46,998 --> 00:32:49,125
It's just we can't all be you.

396
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:53,101
Be that as it may,
I do take some credit for your success here.

397
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:06,045
- Hey, put that back.
- I'm going home!

398
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:12,812
I can't believe I'm gonna miss this!

399
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:22,633
I'm really happy
that you got what you wanted.

400
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,266
I remember on my first day
you said that could happen to me

401
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:28,965
- if I played my cards right.
- Are you getting sentimental?

402
00:33:31,442 --> 00:33:32,773
Oh, my God.

403
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:37,346
Don't worry.
I'm sure we'll see each other all the time.

404
00:33:37,448 --> 00:33:39,939
If we don't, I just have to say...

405
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:52,424
- For the love of Christ!
- Oh, my God.

406
00:33:53,831 --> 00:33:54,798
My foot!

407
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:57,094
- Call an ambulance!
- Holy crap!

408
00:33:57,735 --> 00:33:58,861
Jesus!

409
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:06,309
There's a tourniquet in the first aid kit.
You're gonna be okay.

410
00:34:08,346 --> 00:34:09,335
Good God.

411
00:34:10,815 --> 00:34:11,782
I can't feel a thing.

412
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:16,877
- God! What did I do?
- Get her out of here!

413
00:34:18,756 --> 00:34:20,849
The ambulance is on its way.

414
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:36,565
- I'm Donald Draper.
- We've met before.

415
00:34:37,275 --> 00:34:40,335
- We have, haven't we?
- Yellow Rock Country Club.

416
00:34:40,611 --> 00:34:45,708
- We had a drink. Of course.
- You fixed it for me. Let me return the favor.

417
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:49,178
I can't believe you're Conrad Hilton.

418
00:34:49,287 --> 00:34:51,517
- Connie.
- Don.

419
00:34:53,224 --> 00:34:56,819
Food? Best kitchen in the world.
Got a salad named after it.

420
00:34:56,928 --> 00:35:00,091
I'm fine. I really should have known that.

421
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:02,959
I don't know. Now...

422
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:08,700
After this comes out next week...

423
00:35:10,741 --> 00:35:13,335
Well, they don't do that for everyone.

424
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:18,540
I think I look like an Arab.

425
00:35:19,984 --> 00:35:21,246
How did you find me?

426
00:35:21,352 --> 00:35:23,479
I called around,
told people I had a long chat

427
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:25,715
with a handsome fellow
from Sterling Cooper,

428
00:35:25,823 --> 00:35:27,916
and your name never came up.

429
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:31,028
Apparently you don't have long chats
with people.

430
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:33,893
Well, here I am. What can I do for you?

431
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:39,095
What do you think?

432
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:45,503
I think you wouldn't be
in the presidential suite right now

433
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:48,909
- if you worked for free.
- Don, this is friendly.

434
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:53,408
Connie, this is my profession.
What do you want me to do?

435
00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:57,420
I want you to give me one for free.

436
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:17,304
I don't think anybody wants to think
about a mouse in a hotel.

437
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:33,482
Well, that was my idea.
You got something better?

438
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:35,986
I might.

439
00:36:39,163 --> 00:36:42,098
So, what do you want?

440
00:36:45,436 --> 00:36:48,837
I'm not gonna lie.
I'd love a chance at your business.

441
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:52,200
Okay.

442
00:36:53,811 --> 00:36:57,770
But the next time somebody like me
asks you a question like that,

443
00:36:58,482 --> 00:37:00,450
you need to think bigger.

444
00:37:03,287 --> 00:37:04,845
Well, Connie,

445
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:09,726
there are snakes
that go months without eating,

446
00:37:09,827 --> 00:37:12,295
and then they finally catch something,

447
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:16,264
but they're so hungry
that they suffocate while they're eating.

448
00:37:19,203 --> 00:37:21,194
One opportunity at a time.

449
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:27,237
Sorry to interrupt.
Mr. Draper, you have an emergency call.

450
00:37:28,312 --> 00:37:29,779
Home or office?

451
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,678
Do you understand what's happened here?
That we're not to be trusted?

452
00:37:32,783 --> 00:37:35,183
She's an idiot.
I didn't know she couldn't drive.

453
00:37:35,286 --> 00:37:36,310
But you took the machine out.

454
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,183
You have to have respect
for that equipment.

455
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:41,918
- It's very safe when operated correctly.
- We had the world handed to us on a plate,

456
00:37:42,026 --> 00:37:46,053
and then you swing in on a chandelier,
drop your pants and crap on it.

457
00:37:46,163 --> 00:37:48,654
Jesus, it's like Iwo Jima out there.

458
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:51,063
We should put a rubber mat down
so Cooper can get around.

459
00:37:51,168 --> 00:37:53,363
They're changing the carpeting.

460
00:37:53,471 --> 00:37:55,871
- Any news?
- He might lose his foot.

461
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:59,307
Right when he got it in the door.

462
00:38:02,146 --> 00:38:05,309
- Oh, God.
- Sit down, Sissy Mary. You're pale.

463
00:38:08,853 --> 00:38:10,946
I take full responsibility.

464
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:15,282
Believe me, somewhere in this business,
this has happened before.

465
00:38:28,406 --> 00:38:30,374
Joan. My God.

466
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:34,672
- I know. It's ruined.
- How is he?

467
00:38:35,346 --> 00:38:37,940
I didn't expect you to come over.
I just thought you should know.

468
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:40,483
Honestly, when I called you,
I thought he might die.

469
00:38:40,584 --> 00:38:44,918
- But he's not going to?
- No. He's lost the foot.

470
00:38:45,923 --> 00:38:47,220
Jesus, that's awful.

471
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,555
Lane went to retrieve Powell and Ford
from dinner.

472
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:52,220
They've already talked to the doctor.

473
00:38:54,365 --> 00:38:55,662
I'll wait.

474
00:39:07,111 --> 00:39:09,136
Despite the circus today,

475
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:13,541
I hope you know
that you are going to be terribly missed.

476
00:39:13,951 --> 00:39:17,284
That's nice to hear,
especially from you, Don.

477
00:39:29,967 --> 00:39:33,095
I bet he felt great
when he woke up this morning.

478
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:36,870
I'm sure you're right.

479
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:42,107
But that's life.
One minute, you're on top of the world,

480
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:46,445
the next minute, some secretary
is running you over with a lawn mower.

481
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:49,610
Don.

482
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,448
I'm heartbroken.

483
00:39:55,459 --> 00:39:58,394
- It's a terrible tragedy.
- One that surely could have been avoided,

484
00:39:58,496 --> 00:40:01,021
although, Mrs. Harris,
thank you for your quick thinking.

485
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:04,033
- You may have saved his life.
- Such as it is.

486
00:40:05,002 --> 00:40:09,735
He was a great account man. A prodigy.
He could talk a Scotsman out of a penny.

487
00:40:11,108 --> 00:40:14,839
- Now that's all over.
- I don't know if that's true.

488
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:19,205
The man is missing a foot.
How is he going to work? He can't walk.

489
00:40:19,316 --> 00:40:21,716
The doctor said he'll never golf again.

490
00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:25,152
I'm afraid we have to reevaluate
our entire strategy.

491
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:31,759
- Lane will remain here indefinitely.
- We'll close the office tomorrow, obviously.

492
00:40:32,029 --> 00:40:35,055
Mrs. Harris, please allow the company
to reimburse you for that dress,

493
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:37,031
just as a token of our gratitude.

494
00:40:37,134 --> 00:40:39,694
I think Saint John and I
should see him if we can.

495
00:40:39,804 --> 00:40:41,135
Of course.

496
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:53,013
You should get home
to that lucky husband.

497
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,141
Yes.

498
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:23,071
- Can I get you one?
- Sure.

499
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:32,387
I've been reading a lot
of American literature lately.

500
00:41:36,894 --> 00:41:39,158
<i>- Tom Sawyer.
- That's a good one.</i>

501
00:41:41,031 --> 00:41:45,900
I feel like I just went to my own funeral.
I didn't like the eulogy.

502
00:42:45,529 --> 00:42:47,463
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

503
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:52,502
- Daddy!
- Hey. Hey, I got you. I got you. Just breathe.

504
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:03,509
Get him out, Daddy!
Please, Daddy, save me.

505
00:43:06,283 --> 00:43:08,478
I don't even know what to say.

506
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:16,219
Daddy.

507
00:43:21,865 --> 00:43:24,766
Calm down and tell me what's going on.

508
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:29,139
Grandpa Gene.
He's not supposed to be here anymore.

509
00:43:29,707 --> 00:43:30,935
He's not.

510
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:34,943
He's called Gene, he sleeps in his room,
he looks just like him,

511
00:43:35,045 --> 00:43:39,243
and I bet when he starts talking,
he's gonna sound just like him, too.

512
00:43:40,751 --> 00:43:43,549
He's a baby. That's it.

513
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:51,493
I want you to go to sleep.
There's no such thing as ghosts.

514
00:44:10,914 --> 00:44:12,848
Betts, this has to stop.

515
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:16,449
There's nothing I can do.
She's jealous of her little brother.

516
00:44:16,553 --> 00:44:20,011
No, she's not jealous, she's scared,
and it's all because he has that name.

517
00:44:20,124 --> 00:44:21,489
"That name. "

518
00:44:21,925 --> 00:44:23,517
You've never liked it
and you haven't hidden it well,

519
00:44:23,627 --> 00:44:27,859
- and now you're bringing her into this.
- That's ridiculous. Let's talk about Sally.

520
00:44:27,965 --> 00:44:31,594
She's a child. She'll get over it.
Now you have to.

521
00:44:32,302 --> 00:44:34,964
He was my father and that was his name.

522
00:44:35,139 --> 00:44:39,007
It's what people do, Don.
It's how they keep the memory alive.

523
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:42,277
He hated me and I hated him.
That's the memory.

524
00:44:42,379 --> 00:44:43,937
That's his name!

525
00:44:49,887 --> 00:44:53,653
I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to wake him.

526
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:59,454
That's okay, honey. Everything's fine.

527
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:04,497
Come on. Let's get you to sleep.

528
00:45:32,629 --> 00:45:34,119
Come over here.

529
00:45:47,845 --> 00:45:50,439
You see? It's all right.

530
00:45:58,789 --> 00:46:00,882
This is your little brother,

531
00:46:03,127 --> 00:46:04,924
and he's only a baby.

532
00:46:07,164 --> 00:46:09,291
We don't know who he is yet,

533
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,368
or who he's going to be.

534
00:46:15,873 --> 00:46:18,103
And that is a wonderful thing.
