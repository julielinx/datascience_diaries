    "This was thrown into *[Applied Predictive Modeling](https://www.amazon.com/Applied-Predictive-Modeling-Max-Kuhn-ebook/dp/B00K15TZU0)* as an example of a non-accuracy based criteria.  It allocates a gain from TP and costs for FP and FN to assign a dollar amount. The example in the book was for a direct mail campaign. `x` amount was expected to be gained by customers that responded to the mailer, `y` was spent on each mailer, and `z` was the amount lost for mailers not sent to customers that would have responded.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same basic equation can be used from a savings perspective in use cases such as fraud. `x` would be the expected savings for each case of fraud sucessfully identified and stopped, `y` would be costs like customers lost due to increased inconvenience, and `z` would be the amount lost for each fraudulent case gone undetected.\n",
