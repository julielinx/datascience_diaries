    "\n",
    "In <font color='red'>Entry 24</font> I used the default threshold to determine the classification (negative or positive). As discussed in the Precision / recall tradeoff section of <font color='red'>Entry 23</font> this isn't what I always want. In addition, as noted in *[Introduction to Machine Learning with Python](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Machine-Learning-Python-Scientists/dp/1449369413)* not all models provide a realistic representation of uncertainity. I need a way to determine the best threshold for my purposes for the specific model I'm looking at."

    "This was thrown into *Applied Predictive Modeling* as an example of a non-accuracy based criteria.  It allocates a gain from TP and costs to FP and FN to assign a dollar amount. The example in the book was for a direct mail campaign. `x` amount was expected to be gained by customers that responded to the mailer, `y` was spent on each mailer, and `z` was the amount lost for mailers not sent to customers that would have responded.\n",

    "The same basic equation can be used from a savings perspective in use cases such as fraud. `x` would be the expected savings for each case of fraud sucessfully identified and stopped, `y` would be costs like customers lost due to increased inconvenience, and `z` would be the amount lost for each fraudulent case gone undetected.\n",
