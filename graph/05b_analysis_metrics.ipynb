    "I am 100% adding this entry retroactively. And yes, I dated it wrong so it would show up in the right order in the Post list. That's the nice thing about digital diaries: you can insert things in after the fact. It wasn't until I was working on entries G12 and G13 that I realized I hadn't posted all the analysis metrics I plan to address.\n",
