    "This is essentially a redo of the unweighted degree metrics from [Entry G10](https://julielinx.github.io/blog/g10_local_metrics/). I ran the same metrics and queries from that entry, except I used the multigraph as created in [Entry G11](https://julielinx.github.io/blog/g11_create_multigraphdb_desktop/). The switch to the multigraph allowed me to compare metrics across graph models. This will be a crucial aspect once I start comparing runtimes of the different queries.\n",

So if I leave the `Comic` label out of the Bimodal Graph Model's `nodeProjection` then none of the nodes have any relationships. This is because the `Hero` nodes are only connected to the `Comic` nodes. By excluding them, we essentially isolate all of our `Hero` nodes.\n",
