    "I need to understand graph structure better and the reprecussions of using the different model types. Specifically, I'm interested in memory use, processing speed, and index optimization for the ~50 different graph metrics and algorithms I've explored for machine learning features.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in [Entry G2](https://julielinx.github.io/blog/g02_create_graphdb_desktop/) I'm using the [Marvel Universe Social Network](https://www.kaggle.com/csanhueza/the-marvel-universe-social-network) as a jumping in point. This data is handy because:\n",

    "- It's public\n",

    "The bimodal graph structure is the one that I work with for my job (technically it's multimodal, but I tend to think of it as bimodal). During the course of my work, I've started to wonder several things:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Is it necessary to project a bimodal graph to a unimodal graph to run the graph algorithms?\n",
    "- Is it easier to use a projected unimodal graph when looking to engineer features for machine learning?\n",
    "- Is it faster to use a bimodal or unimodal structure (historically I have trouble with timeout errors)?\n",
    "- Can a unimodal and bimodal version of the graph exist in the same space and still be usable?\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to really explore the rammifications of the different graph models (see [Entry G3](https://julielinx.github.io/blog/g03_graph_model/) for more on graph modeling), I created three versions of the Marvel Universe Social Network. The three versions are:  \n",

    "1. Bimodal\n",
    "2. Weighted projected unimodal\n",
    "3. Mixed bimodal and projected unimodal\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Why create three different versions? Why not just use the mixed graph and have it all? There are a couple reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I frequently get a mismatch between what I expect and the actual results. As such, I tend to test things from multiple angles before trusting my results.\n",
    "\n",
    "During these tests, I've found that not all functions do what I think they will. For example, I ran the `gds.alpha.degree.stream()` function from the Graph Data Science Library. The [Degree Centrality](https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/algorithms/degree-centrality/) doc page states \"Degree centrality measures the number of incoming and outgoing relationships from a node.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "I used the `count()` function (which allowed me to easily hone in on different relationship populations: hero-to-comic or hero-to-hero or the combination of both - correct results below) to double check the results and found that the number of relationships wasn't accurately reflected in the numbers the function returned. \n",

    "Second, I want multiple versions of the graph to see if it's easier and faster to structure it one way vs another. One of the major road blocks I've encountered at work is that it takes forever to run some of the queries and algorithms I want. These problem queries end up timing out or temporarily crashing the graph. As would be expected, our developers and software engineers get rather testy when that happens."

    "# Unimodal Projection\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of projecting a bimodal graph to a unimodal structure is to directly connect nodes of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a reminder from [Entry G3](https://julielinx.github.io/blog/g03_graph_model/), here's what it looks like when we take a bimodal graph and project it to a unimodal graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bimodal Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='images/model_bimodal.png' width=650>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Projected Unimodal Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='images/model_unimodal.png' width=650>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cliques Caveat\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to keep in mind when projecting a bimodal network into a unimodal structure is that you'll get a lot of *cliques*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Clique**: a subset of nodes where every distinct node is connected to every other distinct node.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four cliques from our example above.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='images/model_unimodal_cliques.png' width=650>\n",
    "\n",
    "To make this concept clearer, let's look at an example from a single comic.\n",
    "\n",
    "I pulled the comic W2 50 and the heroes in it. Some statistics about this subgraph:\n",
    "\n",
    "- There is 1 comic\n",
    "- There are 9 heroes\n",
    "- Total of 10 nodes\n",
    "- There are 9 relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='images/clique1.png' width=650>\n",
    "\n",
    "When we project this to a unimodal structure, the number of relationships multiples significantly. The statistics for the projected version:\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are 0 comics (we removed it so we could connect heroes directly)\n",
    "- There are 9 heroes\n",
    "- Total of 9 nodes\n",
    "- There are 36 relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='images/clique2.png' width=650>\n",
    "\n",
    "Another caveat to this method is that projecting the relationships makes certain assumptions about the connectivity of the other nodes. For example, in the W2 50 comic example, Silver Fox may not have actually met some of the other characters. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Fox_(comics)) says she is the former love interest for Wolverine. The only X-man she interacted with could have been Wolverine, but in projecting the bimodal graph to a unimodal graph we are making the assumption that all nodes (heroes) interacted with each other because they were in the same comics.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm not quite sure what the repercussions of these caveats are for the metrics I want and the populations I'm trying to find, but that's one of the questions I'm trying to answer in this series of entries."
