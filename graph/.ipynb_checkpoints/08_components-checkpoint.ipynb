    "- There are strongly connected components (i.e, cliques, which I talked about in [Entry G5](https://julielinx.github.io/blog/g05_project_bimodal/)) and weakly connected components (any single path between nodes)"

However, when looking at the metrics for the bimodal model of the graph, the 18 isolates are no longer isolated because those heroes are connected to the comic they appear in. As such, I'd need to include them in the components.\n",
