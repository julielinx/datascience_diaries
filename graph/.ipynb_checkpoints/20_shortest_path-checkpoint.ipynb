    "Based on the results from the [Entry G19c notebook](), most nodes will have a villain connection within one or two steps. But I wanted to see how far you *have* to travel before encountering a villain node - are there any more than two steps away? Also, I want to have this metric for future reference because other graphs may have longer distances to other nodes of interest.\n",

    "The quirk to the Marvel Universe Social Network is that there is almost always a villain in a given comic. With the way the bimodal network is projected to a unimodal network this means that pretty much every person node will be connected to a villain, as discussed in [Entry G5: Projecting Bimodal to Unimodal](https://julielinx.github.io/blog/g05_project_bimodal/).\n",
