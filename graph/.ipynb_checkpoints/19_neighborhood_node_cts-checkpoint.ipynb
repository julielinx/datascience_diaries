    "My original thought was to use the shortest path algorithm, but on the advice of Neo4j's Andrew Bowman I used `apoc.path.spanningTree`. The benefits of using this algorithm are that it uses breadth first search, has node filters that allows for easily counting villains while still expanding past those villians to find the next nearest villains, and relationship filters that make translating the query to work on the mix graph a cinch.\n",
