If you need a reminder as to what weighted relationships are see [Entry G4: Modeling Relationships](https://julielinx.github.io/blog/g04_graph_model_rels/).\n",

    "Unlike Entry G12, I only needed one notebook to examine the weighted degrees. It can be found in the [G13 notebook](https://github.com/julielinx/datascience_diaries/blob/master/graph/13a_nb_weighted_degree_comparison.ipynb).\n",

    "\n",
    "- Used a multigraph instead of three separate graph instances\n",

    "## Used a Multigraph\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like with [Entry G12](https://julielinx.github.io/blog/g12_degree_comparison/), using the multigraph allowed me to query the same information against each of my graph models and easily compare the results. This allowed me to discover that my Mixed Model loaded incorrectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "There were over 100 relationships that were unaccounted for in the Mixed Model once I summed the weighted relationships. Since the Mixed Model is a stepping stone to the Unimodal Model, I knew that some of the relationships must have errored out. I cleared out the Mixed Modal graph with `MATCH (n) DETACH DELETE n` and reloaded the graph. This fixed the discrepancy. It also fixed the discrepancy noted in [Entry G12](https://julielinx.github.io/blog/g12_degree_comparison/) for the number of `KNOWS` relationships in the Unimodal and Mixed Models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, just because I can run a query against all three models doesn't mean I should. If you look in the G13 notebook, you'll notice that I ran Hero to Hero relationships for all three models, but only ran Comic to Comic relationships for the Bimodal and Mixed Models. This is because all Comic informaiton was removed from the Unimodal Model when we projected it.\n",

    "Just as explained in [Entry G12](https://julielinx.github.io/blog/g12_degree_comparison/) and earlier in [Entry G10](https://julielinx.github.io/blog/g10_local_metrics/), using `OPTIONAL MATCH` instead of the more restrictive `MATCH` allows the query to find isolate nodes (nodes that have no relationships to other nodes). This gives a more complete picture when examining the summary statistics and distrubution charts."
