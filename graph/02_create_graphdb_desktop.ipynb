For the graph project I'm going to start with the [Marvel Universe Social Network](https://www.kaggle.com/csanhueza/the-marvel-universe-social-network) available on Kaggle. I picked this because it's publically available, stored as .csv files, and easily fits into both bimodal and unimodal graph models.\n",
