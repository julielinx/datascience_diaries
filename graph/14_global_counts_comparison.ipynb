While we are projecting relationships based on the original Bimodal Model, we end up with a lot more connections in the projected version. If we include the weights we get a total relationship count of 579,191 for Hero to Hero relationships (which we know from the [Entry G13 notebook](https://github.com/julielinx/datascience_diaries/blob/master/graph/13a_nb_weighted_degree_comparison.ipynb)).
