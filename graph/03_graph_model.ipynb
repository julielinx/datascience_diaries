    "\n",
    "In a unimodal graph, there is only one kind of node. For the first database I'll be working with, the [Marvel Universe Social Network](https://www.kaggle.com/csanhueza/the-marvel-universe-social-network), this means we'd only have hero nodes. We wouldn't include the comics that the heroes were featured in.\n",

For a more realistic view of what this would look like, I created a small subset of the Marvel Universe Social Network centering around heroes and comics connected to Dark Crawler. I pulled these into Gephi and after a little finagling got this:\n",

    "The Marvel Universe Social Network example naturally lends itself to a bimodal structure because there are 'hero' nodes and 'comic' nodes. Heroes are in comics and we can tell what heroes appear together by connecting them through the comics they're in together. Heroes aren't connected to other heroes, they're only connected to the comics they appear in. Comics also aren't connected to each other, only to the heroes that appear in their pages.\n",

To do this we have to add more information, like planets the characters have visited. In this case we now have 'hero' nodes, 'comic' nodes, and 'planet' nodes.\n",

This is because the more complex graph model is projected onto the more simplified unimodal representation.\n",
