    "# Entry 46 - Overfitting, Underfitting, and Data Sensitivity\n",
    "\n",
    "I wanted to point a co-worker to information about overfitting the other day. While I've discussed it in entries [17](https://julielinx.github.io/blog/17_resampling/) and [30](https://julielinx.github.io/blog/30_learning_curves_imp_perform/), I realized I haven't covered it in its own entry. Since overfitting is such a big problem with Decision Trees, this feels like the perfect time to stop and remedy that oversight.\n",

    "## The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting, underfitting, and data sensitivity can cause huge headaches after you've gotten through all the hard work of pre-processing, training, and deploying a model because the accuracy of your results won't be anywhere near what you expect."

    "Decision trees are very prone to overfitting. As a reminder from [Entry 17](https://julielinx.github.io/blog/17_resampling/) here are the definitions of overfitting and underfitting from [Introduction to Machine Learning with Python](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Machine-Learning-Python-Scientists/dp/1449369413/ref=sr_1_15?keywords=scikit+learn&qid=1583195970&s=books&sr=1-15) by Andreas Muller and Sarah Guido.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Overfitting**: when a model is fit too closely to the training set, but is not able to generalize to new data, it is *overfit*.\n",
    "- **Underfitting**: when a model is fit too loosely / simply, causing it to predict poorly on training and test data, it is *underfit*.\n",

The code for this chart can be found in Geron's GitHub [notebook for Chapter 6](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2/blob/master/06_decision_trees.ipynb).\n",

    "Jake VanderPlas has a great example of the propensity of classification tree-based models to overfit in his book [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) on page 424. Using a synthetic dataset created using the `make_blots()` function, he trained two models using different subsets of half the data. His full explaination and the code can be found in his accompanying [Github notebook](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook/blob/master/notebooks/05.08-Random-Forests.ipynb).\n",

Aurelien Geron recommends using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to help overcome this challenge. He covers PCA in chapter 8, I'll get to it eventually in this blog."
