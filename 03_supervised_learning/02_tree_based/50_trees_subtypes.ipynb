They perform this task recursively by splitting subgroups into smaller and smaller units until the Tree is finished (stopped by certain criteria).\n",

    "\n",
    "According to the Seminar Paper available in Michael Dorner's [Decision Trees repo](https://github.com/michaeldorner/DecisionTrees), CHAID was proposed in 1979 by Gordon Kass as a modification to the Automatic Interaction Detection (AID) algorithm developed by John Sonquist and James Morgan in 1964. This makes the the oldest (and certainly based on the oldest) algorithm that I'll discuss. *The Complete Guilde to Decision Trees* states that CHAID is one of the oldest Decision Tree algorithms that produces multiway splits and is suitable for classification and regression tasks.\n",

    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "According to [Decision Trees Explained](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2020/01/decision-tree-algorithm-explained.html) CHAID finds the statistical significance of the differences between child and parent nodes. These differences are measured using Chi-squared independence tests for classification tasks and the F-test for regression tasks. The higher the value, the more statistically significant the difference is between the child and parent nodes.\n",

    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "According to [thefreedictionary.com](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/dichotomisation#:~:text=Noun,act%20or%20process%20of%20dividing), \"dichotomisation\" is \"the act of dividing into two sharply different categories.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, it makes sense that one of the early Decision Tree algoriths used this term in its name. However, since ID3 uses multiway splits and can have more than two children nodes per parent node, the name is a bit of a \"gotcha\" unless you ignore the \"two\" part of the definition.\n",

    "### Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "*1.10.6. Tree algorithms: ID3, C4.5, C5.0 and CART* has the following information about ID3:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The algorithm creates a multiway tree, finding for each node (i.e. in a greedy manner) the categorical feature that will yield the largest information gain for categorical targets. Trees are grown to their maximum size and then a pruning step is usually applied to improve the ability of the tree to generalise to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Decision Trees Explained* lists out the steps of the algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It begins with the original set S as the root node\n",
    "2. On each iteration of the algorithm, it iterates through every unused attribute of the set S and calculates Entropy(H) and Information gain(IG) of this attribute\n",
    "3. It then selects the attribute which has the smallest Entropy or Largest Information gain\n",
    "4. The set S is then split by the selected attribute to produce a subset of the data\n",
    "5. The algorithm continues to recur on each subset, considering only attributes never selected before\n",
    "\n",
    "The tendency to state that ID3 uses both Entropy and Information Gain as the impurity measures can be confusing. *Decision Trees Explained* eloquently resolves this confusion by explicitly stating that\n",
    "\n",
    "> Information gain is a decrease in entropy. It computes the difference between entropy before split and average entropy after split of the dataset based on given attribute values.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, whether the programatic implementation uses Entropy or Information Gain, it's looking at the same basic information. The major difference is whether the algorithm is optimized to find the lowest Entropy or the highest Information Gain.\n",

    "- When pruning is applied, it's generally as a post-pruning process\n",
