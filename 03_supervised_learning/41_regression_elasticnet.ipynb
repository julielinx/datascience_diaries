    "## Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "In `scikit-learn`, the ratio of how the Lasso (L1) and Ridge (L2) terms are applied is controled by the `l1_ratio` parameter. In other words, the `l1_ratio` parameter specifies how much Lasso is used. A value of 0 would mean the Elastic Net would be the same as Ridge Regression, a value of 0.5 would be half Lasso and half Ridge, and a value of 1 would be the same as Lasso Regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "The outcome of keeping the coefficients as small as possible helps reduce the complexity of the model (i.e., makes it more generalized and reduces overfitting). The complexity of the model is controlled through the parameter `alpha`. Larger `alpha` values force the coefficients closer to 0 (reducing complexity), smaller values are less restricting (allowing for more complexity)."
